The 1st time experience during oir Durga Puja visit was rxcellent but my recent experience on my last visit was awful.

Visited this place a few days back. The place is really small but the graphiti on the wall are nice but we had to wait long for the food. But i must say it was worth the wait. The food was lip smacking. The pomfret was the best. Delhi styled tengri kebab was different but good, mutton biriyani was great, stuffed kulcha was good and mutton bhuna was amazing. I must say a must visit place because the price is very reasonable

So we visited here today.. We ordered bharwan tangri kabab and murgh deg biryani.. The kabab was too tasty.. Havnt tasted such a yummy juicy kabab before.. The biryani we ordered was half plate.. But it was enough for one I would say.. Less oily and less spicy with that perfect biryani taste.. Would love to visit again and personally recommend all the biryani lovers to visit here atleast once.. Staff was quite friendly as they only suggested us to order bharwan tangri.. Price is pretty cheap.. Only one drawback.. The space of the resto is a quite small..

I had been to this place more than once and it has never failed to disappointment me.
Located: in Purna Das Road beside Wise Owl cafe , Feast Street has been an all time favourite.
We had ordered Hazar-wi-murgh tikka, Husanabadi Boti kebab, Murg begam bahar, Lasooni Naan, Butter naan, Gajar ka halwa(winter special) and Firni.
Quality: The quality of the dishes were very nice. The food was fresh and good. The kebabs were tender and juicy and melted in the mouth. No complains about the naan.
*Murg begam bahar was a chicken red base gravy with bones. The taste was good but could be improved.
*Husanabadi Boti Kebab was a mutton kebab, soft and juicy with a perfect blend of spices.
*Hazarwi Murg tikka was a typical chicken tandoori tikka but had a special aroma and flavor to it.
* Firni was a perfect end to the meal.
*Gajar ka halwa was a big disappointment. It had no taste at all. It lacked sweetness,aroma and flavor.
Ambience: The restaurant is a small one with very few seating arrangement. The ambience is ok with music at the background. But the awesome food makes up for it.
Highly recommended: Kebabs
Our total bill was Rs 1035. Overall a very good dining.
The kebabs were definitely the star of the meal.

Overall it's a nice place to dine with friends and family. Interiors are pretty good. And so are the food!
Ahaaa!
We ordered Afghani hazari kabab which was the best thing we had today! It's texture was pretty soft and was sizzlingly delicious! 
Next we ordered 6 tandoori roti, half chicken bharta and chicken afghani malai kabab. The chicken bharta was awesome and it had enough of butter and cream to satisfy your fantasies. 🔥 
But... The malai kabab... Although the texture if the kabab was pretty awesome, we did not like the malai gravy of that dish... IDK how it got under the 'khaas' list in the menu card!
Overall Rs 713 in total was our bill for 3 peeps and we were satisfied!

I was eager to visit this new joint which, I was told, offers lip-smacking fare. When the birthday of a cousin came up, we thought of celebrating it here. My cousin is a biryani-buff, so we ordered both the chicken and mutton version. Murgh Surgh Angar (chicken) and Husnabadi (mutton) kebabs were the accompaniments to the biryani, along with burhani. We also tried out their Keema Pulao and Murgh Begum Bahar…I liked these two the best, in particular the chicken gravy dish which had a distinct taste of its own.

Once you get down at Highland Park...it's just at a walking distance of 3 mons from there... It was pitch perfect to have year ending lunch over there.. The starters of Afghani tangri and Husanbadi boti kebab were finger licking.... The pudina rumali and butter tamdoori roti were average...but the cheese kulcha is yummy... then The Murg  badaami  and Gosht biriyani was delicious...its a pocket pinch..and perfect if you wanna chillax with your group

This place is the one where you go when you are hungry​ and nearly broke. And if you do have a little money to splurge, then voila! Often people find themselves in a tug of war; costly good food vs. cheap food whose tastes are questionable. But not anymore! With The Feast Street, delicious food respecting value for money is what you get. I had fried chicken wings which come at a price of 149 for 6 pieces(quite big) evenly fried, crispy with chaat masala and green chutney. Next was tandoori roti with butter chicken. And to seal the deal, I had Firni. The roti was a perfect balance between tender and crisp, the chicken was delicious. Though the Firni could have been better. If you haven't been to this fantastic place yet, do hurry!
P.S. the only concern is that the place is quite small.

The dal and naan was ok nothing extraordinary but the tandoori was top notch.Soft and juicy the tandoori was heavenly.Will be back to try the other kebabs in their menu.
Just a suggestion- Kindly arrange better seating arrangements for your guests

The Feast Street is one of those rare food joints which not only fills your tummy and warms your heart but is also easy on your pocket. This particular outlet at Hindustan Park is located just beside The Wise Owl. I was there with my friends for lunch and we ordered-

1. Bharwan Tangri- I absolutely loved this one. There were four chicken leg pieces stuffed with an yummy chicken keema masala made in some Indian spices. The meat was tender and juicy. 

2. Malai Kalmi Kebab- This one was good too. Taste was somewhat similar to normal Chicken Tandoori but we all love Chicken Tandoori don't we? 😂

3. Mutton Biriyani- Now their Biriyani is a bit different from the normal Kolkata Biriyani in terms of the masala used. Here they used tamarind and sauteed onions as the masala so the Biriyani had that hint of sour and sweet and was less oily 👍 Mutton was tender and of course if had a potato and an egg too 😂 They also offered raita with the Biriyani in small glass tea cups, not one of the very good raitas I've had though. 

4. Chicken Biriyani- The Chicken piece in the Biriyani was really dry and chewy. My friend had to throw the whole thing away. Not recommended at all. 

5. Afghani Murgh- The gravy was creamy and sweet. It'll go well with naan or other breads. 

There is not much space in the seating area. At a time around 30 people can be accommodated. They have a wall painted vibrantly with some funny Hindi dialogues and is perfect for your insta clicks😛. The furniture looks cozy and bright. The staff is really courteous however service was a bit delayed. Overall a good experience. I would surely visit one more time to try their combos and Lebanese food.

A small and cozy corner located near wise owl. went here two days ago with my friends as the place was a bit crowded we have to wait a few minutes to get a table for four. We ordered butter chicken,bhuna ghost keema kulcha and pudina roomali.But we have to settle down for plain rumali rotis as the ordered one was not available.Coming to the taste butter chicken was lipsmacking with nice textured gravy and roasted chicken pieces, bhuna ghost was flavourful for mutton lovers and those who love their food spicy, roomali rooti was fine, keema kulcha was again a flavourful addition to the taste buds.
A must visit for North Indian foodies. Eager to try their other dishes.Good job guys , hoping to visit again.

But the biriyani was really awesome.. The two most important things for me in a biriyani is the potato and meat. The potato was perfectly cooked and so was the meat.. The place is pocket friendly too and the food is awesome.. Will surely visit the place again.. Keep the standards high like this..

The only problem is the lack of space as it is a tiny restaurant but other than that there is nothing one can complain about. The chicken cheese kebab is a must try and the mutton biryani is delicious. Another thing that I must mention about this place is the behavior of the staff, they are really well behaved.

Their Gosht Bhuna gives a gastronomic pleasure and Afghani murgh is absolutely outstanding. Jhinga Anarkali which is prawn kebabs are the best in town. In dessert do try their moong dal ka halwa it's an absolute delight. Service is excellent. I love visiting this place because of the food and their colourful ambience. Cheers to The Feast Street. Keep rocking.

This little gem is located at the heart of South Kolkata at Purna Das Road. It's relatively new but can say that this is one of the best North Indian and Mughlai restaurant in the city.  They serve authentic North Indian cuisine and their biriyani can give competition to any of the well know mughlai restaurants in the city. Their Butter Chicken is one of a kind and it's a total bliss. Their kebabs are uniquely prepared and absolutely succulent which melts in the mouth. Try their lasooni kebab, bharwan tangri and yes CSB tandoori. Their fish kebabs (mahi-e-gulfam) are little pieces of joy. Once you are there do not forget to try their shahi tukda it's outstanding. All in all this is one restaurant that I can vouch for and I am sure they will go miles ahead. Kudos to the team.

Pathetic food and service, the lesser said the better. First of all the small seating place will have 4-5 employees sitting and staring at you. Next, most of the food items are not available. And the quality is also pathetic.

Last sunday had a visit to this place...its a tiny cool place ...basically a north indian joint. Prices are pocket-friendly . The food tastes good but not best but they offer a variety of starters. They have for a change servings in half/quarter/full,i like this idea a lot because its convenient for eaters like me who are low in consumption. Good place for a try!

We ordered food from here a few days back finally. This place was in my bucket list for a long time. So, we had murg deg biryani and anda deg biryani, with chicken cheese kebab and firni.. The biryani was well cooked, standard, chicken pieces were soft and juicy.. To sum up nice biryani.. Standard quantity. I loved the cheese kebab the most! It literally melts in your mouth. The firni was again an awesome one I had in a long time.. I would love to try their other dishes as well soon enough.

The kebabs are a must try. Wall decor is amazing. The staff behavior is friendly. Only objection is the space, which is too small and if you're ordering something smoky like a sizzler, you might get suffocated. Not a good place for hanging out with a large group but certainly recommended for small groups. Prices are reasonable.

This place will be my favourite forever❤❤. I mean such nice food omg😍. The no. of seats is the only thing that needs to improve like the space isn't very large. But the decor was really quirky amd funky with all the "cool" graffiti walls and good styled wooden chairs and tables. And their service is also very good👌👍.But the food is the best part😍❤. We had ordered hazar-wi-murgh tikka in starters...butter nun, butter murgh in delhi style, peas pulao and murgh changezi in the main course, and, firni in dessert. The hazar-wi-murgh tikka was sizzler kind and is served hot😀 and it's very soft from the inside and the taste is like heaven😍❤. The butter nun was very soft which you do not get in every restaurant's nun, it melted as soon as you put it in your mouth. The butter murgh in delhi style was my favourite❤ the flavours, the chicken, the gravy, the masala, the tadka...everything was on point and yumm❤😍❤. The peas pulao was amazing too👌❣. The murgh changezi was damn delicious, it had that indian tadka flavour in it❤💟. And the firni was yumm too😍😍. I would definitely recommend this place to all❤. Go there as soon as possible if you are a north-indian or mughlai foodie❣.
Food - 5/5
Service - 4.5/5
Place - 4/5 (no. of seats needs to be increased)

It's located just beside Wise Owl in Purna Das Road.. we were 4 people and we wanted the wraps but to our surprise it was not available. The time was 6pm and this is the time for wraps but anyways we have to settle for kebabs and I won't complain as the chicken pieces were soft and served beautifully..the waiting time was also low...I could have rated it 4 stars if I would have got what I wanted and was determined to rate it 2 stars but again the kebabs made me rethink and rate it 3.5

Kebabs were awesome.
The mutton in the mutton biryani combo was a little undercooked.
The place is on the smaller side, and hence kinda cramped. I went during the Pujo, so usually, should not be a problem.

On our bucket list for quite some time now, The Feast Street is pretty as a picture. A 22 seater restaurant to be precise, the place adheres to yellow coated walls and black scribblings maintaining uniformity. Located in South Kolkata's Food Hub aka Hindustan Park, you will find this place right next to Wise Owl. 

Plying their trade in quirky themes relatable to those of Tea Junction giving it a Kolkata-esque vibe. We went in there early and started off with Lasooni Kesar Malai Tikka. Apart from the wonderfully crafted name, the size of the kebabs were monstrous if exaggerated. Honestly, we haven't had such wholesome kebabs for a long time. The presentation was unique and will remind you more of Sizzlers. Shame that we couldn't try out the other starters, but moved onto the mains. 

The Delhi styled butter chicken has finally broken the clichés of the overhyped Butter Chicken community. The curry makes the difference here. Next up was the Murgh Badami, a lot on the sweeter side this is quite heavy and half plate would suffice for three given the humongous pieces. In the breads section, the Keema Kulcha was excellent and can be devoured with the Pudina Chutney as well. Laccha Paratha and Butter Naan were up to the mark, but we made a mistake by taking Laccha Paratha with Murgh Badami (try not to have that combo because of its overwhelming sweetness). Tried their Burhani, and was a little disappointed and could not end the day on a higher note. 

All in all, The Feast Street is the perfect place for anyone looking for affordable Indian, Mughlai and North Indian cuisine. Extremely courteouss staff and humongous pieces (can't get over the fact) are their Mojo.

Okay so it in a very locatable place.


Food: every food was lip smacking. The prices were pretty reasonable.
We ordered pompret preparation(pomfret tandoor) , gosht briyani , gosht bhuna and masala kulcha.

We wanted to order firni as rest desserts were unable but later the waiter told that the firni too is not available. That was dissapointing.

Hospitality: The waiters were not that eminent. Had to wait for the food a long period of time.

Ambience: The place is really very small but for a space crunched place there is a amazing colorful graffiti wall.



Overall if you love Indian food specially mughal food you can give it a shot...!

The quality, quantity and the taste of fish n chicken items both are also very good in pocket friendly price.

So, overall I am very much satisfied with this name The Feast Street.  Will be back soon.

Located in Hindustan Park, just beside The Wise Owl, this is a small place serving delicious food for some time now.

AMBIENCE - A small neatly done space, accomodating around 16-18 souls at a time, gives you a cosy feel.

FOOD- Coming to food we have tried their murgh achari kebab, tandoori roti, butter chicken delhi style, murgh deg biriyani. They serve complimentary burhani with every plate of biriyani. What should I say about the taste?! Every dish is spot on. My favorite is definitely the butter chicken delhi style, lip-smacking good.

SERVICE - Service is okay, the waiters seem a little laid back, as we had to call them a few times everytime we wanted water or spoons.

POCKET PINCH - Extremely pocket friendly.

The Feast Street is a delight for that hungry soul always searching for mind-bogglingly delicious north indian food. This tiny place situated right beside The Wise Owl Coffee Shop is a biriyani and kebab lovers' paradise. They hardly have a seating arrangement for a score of people but boy the special gosht biriyani that my friend and I shared brought tears to my eyes. I was so happy to find after a long time, alu bukhara in my biriyani. It was heavenly! With it we had butter murgh. It was super creamy and the chicken pieces were so tender that it melted in the mouth. The staff were very helpful and attentive. They provided us with complimentary burhani which helps digest a heavy meal. Overall a delectable experience and I'm sure I will be back here soon.

Visited on a recommendation from a school friend who happen to know the owners. 
Nice cozy place. 22 seater in 7 tables. What’s more interesting is the interior. Very nearly made. The graffiti on the wall is very very interesting. The inside has a very vibrant look which will make you feel good. The chairs are little small ... understandably to fit in max people as per space available.
Coming to the food I just tried 2 types of kebabs : Kasoori Murg Malai Tikka and Hazar-Wi-Murgh Tikka. The first one is non spicy and the second one is spicy. I purposefully ordered 2 different kind. 
The presentation of the kebabs are real treat. It will give u a feel that u r having sizzlers. The smoky part will make u pleasantly surprise. The chicken were extremely tender. Quality wise too good. Both the types has its own uniqueness and tasted really good. I will surely go back to this place to try their other items in the menu.

Here, we tried laal tandoori chicken, Raan-e-sikandari, pudina rumali, masala kulcha, lasooni naan, murgh deg biriyani, Delhi fried tangri, chicken tikka wrap, firni and Rabri. 
You all must try this place out once.

This place blew my mind. Tucked inside an alley near Hindustan Park, this small eatery has a very hip and colorful vibe.
The service is quite slow. We waited more than 30 mins for the starter CSB Afghani Murg.- creamy, salty, buttery as promised and oh-so-soft.
The main course starter off with a bang, the Delhi style butter murgh was finger-licking by itself. With the soft, slightly minty pudina roti wrapped about the pieces, it was like a fire-work going off in my mouth.
I am not a huge fan of biriyani but the mutton biriyani here is just heavenly, not oily, with the just right amount of spices, and the mutton was tender and falling off the bones. Forget Aminia, Arsalan, tbh the biriyani here is a lot better than the nearby Oudh's which charges twice the money. I was so busy gobbling up that I forgot to take pictures.
The quantities are huge and everything is very reasonably priced. I know I'm coming back.

We had ordered Lasooni Kesar Malai Tikka, Chicken Delhi Style, Butter Tandoori Rotis and Lachha Rotis. The quality of the food items was good. Needless to mention, we relished them. And not to forget, the cost is not too high. Rather, the pricing of most of the items is relatively cheap. And their service is decent as well. A good place to re-visit.

I've been here many times. The food is sooo good! Their presentation of food is nice. The Indian breads are really soft and in perfect size. I ordered a pudina rumali which wasn't that good.
 I'll recommend you guys to try out Feast street Dal Bukhara. It literally stole my heart. 
Coming to tandooris, they are soft , tender and full of flavours in the right amount. I've tried the Afghani murgh, a cheese kebab and the tangri kebab. 
Their desserts are really really good. I've tried the phirni and I'm in love with it. 

The place is small and cozy. It's situated beside Wise owl cafe. The price is not that high but for that quality of food it's totally worth it.

Though it was fully crowded and we had to wait for a long time , I would like to go again and again at this place just for the good and hygienic food..a big thumbs up👍

We came here on diwali night expecting the same old boring vegetarian food as i couldn't have non veg. I was presently surprised by the equally good vegetarian food this place had to offer. 
We ordered dal makhani, paneer butter masala, chicken butter masala. I was informed by my friends that chicken was also good.
The restaurant is pretty small and congested tho the food makes up for it. 
The staff was polite and the owner was friendly. 
Overall a nice place to go if you have average amount of money to spend.

To be honest i had lots of expectation from this place, but i was dissapointed with some little things over here. Firstly, they dont have a washroom inside the restaurant; one needs to walk a bit to go to the washroom which is not at all well mantained. Secondly, it is a small sweet place but very much congested. Infact the smoke coming from kitchen was very much irritant to eyes. Anyway, service was not satisfactory, there were only two people for serving and both of them were so busy that they hardly had the time to attend us. We had to call them twice or thrice for order!
Now coming to food, we order Full Peas pulao, butter tandoori roti and chicken reshmi tikka masala. And another drawback is that they hardly have any option of boneless chicken preperation in their menu. Anyway the peas pualo was good, so as the reshmi tikka masala but there was not even a tinge of butter in Butter tandoori roti. It was too dry on mouth and by the time the roti was served to us it already became fibrous! It was a big let down!
The only thing i have given three points to this place is for peas pulao, reshmi tikka masala and the price. It is a pocket friendly place and we were billed only Rs 430 for two! For me i dont think i would ever visit this place, but yeah if you r looking for very cheap north indian cuisine then only you can give this place a try.

The feast street was suggested by a friend. And the Zomato reviews were satisfactory.
Honestly I am pleased with their service.
We odered special gost biriyani, plain nan and butter nan.
Now come to the taste... boriyani tastes good enough. 
As we take prcel. They packed two aloos and the two pieces of gost and the egg separately in a container. And the give all the rice in a box. So their is no complain about the quantity.

Feast Street is a place I found on Zomato while searching for good North Indian food...and Zomato never disappoints me. I found very nice reviews and went here on 18th November..it was my friends birthday and we both were extremely hungry.
We were at Rabindra sarobar metro station from there we had to hire an uber I guess it will be easier to reach here from golpark.
It is a small outlet but very artisticly decorated.they have small seating area but very comfortable so no complaints about that.
The only thing I didn't like here was lack of management... everything seemed very unprofessional and specially the serving staffs...like one of them served us the starter without salad and sauce and after we finished 2 pieces of chicken tikka they served sauce and salad..that was ridiculous plus we have to wait too long for 2 plates of biriyani.
We ordered 2 chicken biryani and one lasooni malai chicken starter that tasted really awesome and biriyani too was freshly cooked and extremely satisfying so the food compaintiated for all the mismanagement we experienced... overall we enjoyed the food to the fullest.
Whenever you have cravings for north Indian food visit here 🍜

The food was too good. The biryani is cooked lightly but its richness gives you the nawabi taste definitely. The chicken cheese kebabs were so succulent that you wont hesitate to gobble down a number of them even though 2 3 pieces will fill up your stomach because of the massive sizes. The mutton side dish was equally good with the gravy being creamy and fluffy and delicious. Altogether it was a wow experience.

Located very close to home I decided to give this a try and thought to get food for the entire family from them… I read up on zomato and seeing the reviews I thought it should be worth a shot… boy was I wrong… 

Getting to the place no one wanted to serve us… we called the fellow like a couple of times and then finally he did listen and we asked him for our take away… they have 2 kinds of black daal and no one in the place could inform me of the difference…. I believe even the owner or manager got involved at a point with complete indifference and had no clue what was the difference…. Anyway…

We ordered for daal Makhani, paneer tikka butter masala, malai kofta, jeera aloo and in rotis we called for masala kulcha and rumali rotis for all… we even ordered for a rice…

Coming to the taste… the daal tasted stale and we were completely disappointed… the paneer tikka butter masala seems like some one had sautéed the paneer in a normal pan and made it look like a tikka… the paneer was hard and I was fearful that it could be like very old or something… the jeera aloo was a mess… when we opened it it looked like prison food gopped together… 

the rotis was the major part of me getting angry… if you are not running a sigri… or not being able to make something please do let us know instead of trying to do some jugaad… the rotis were all not done.. they were kaccha and half done… it was so bad to see that and in front of my family it was so embarrassing…  in the end we had the food with the rice mainly and broke parts of the roti which looked like it was done…

I think the reviews all mention that the non veg food out here is amazing and have given it some rave reviews… but I am sorry the veg food is not good out here or maybe my experience was not good with it…

I was really expecting a lot from this place as it is close to my house and their combos and dishes always sound interesting…. But then I was really let down…

We went their during pujas. We ordered chk lasuni kesari malai tikka which was too good. The biriyani is oil free but tastes better than arsalan. The butter ckicken is awesome. I am falling in short of words to describe about this small cosy place.

It was an interesting visit to this place. I like the interior but my co-foodie friend  does not. So his expectation of food was not so higher. But after having the sizzling Lasooni Kesar Malai Murgh Tikka his expectation increased. After that we had Lucknowi Paratha, Butter Nan and Butter Murgh Delhi Style. The food were delicious. I would love to visit here again... The shop might be more specious, but that's not that big issue for a foodie like us....

I new gem in Kolkata. Awesome food. Great quality. Good quantity. 
We had 5 items: 
1 Murgh lasooni kesar malai kabab it was very soft,less baked,white in colour with flakes of kesar. 
2 Lal murgh tandoori,the usual chicken tandoori this was awesome
3 Special gosht deg biriyani.. the biriyani here is superb..huge quantity awesome quality mind blowing taste. 
4 Mutton Bhuna.. this is another great preparation.. mainly cooked with black peper. One of the best mutton dishes I have ever had. Best in taste. 
& at last phirni.

Feast Street is absolutely more then expectations. Perfect value for money. A true new gem & their ambiance is also very different & innovative. 

Will visit it again & again.

Located beside the wise owl cafe in Hindustan Park,it is a very small yet cozy restaurant. The decor is very colorful & quirky. It serves great food at pocket friendly prices. Staffs are well behaved & polite. Service is very fast. We ordered murgh surgh angar, murgh achari, chhole bhature, gosht qorma, lachha paratha,chicken tikka wrap (tortilla) & murgh biriyani. Food was really delicious & of generous amount.

The eatery is very small,which makes it difficult to get tables in the first place. The interiors are colorful, with wall art. The waiters are polite, and service fast.
We ordered chicken cheese kebabs, pahari kebabs,mutton burrah kebabs, washed down with fresh lime soda and masala cold drink. Tasted average.

All the dishes we had were lipsmacking and awesome especially the Lasooni Kesar Malai Tikka,Husanabadi Boti kebab, butter chicken delhi style and cheese kulcha.
Hope to visit again soon enough to try the rest of their kebabs!

A culinary delight , par excellence ! You visit TFS solely for the food and nothing else !!! 

The cramped outlet is heaven for meat lovers - all the meat offerings are insanely priced and VFM at the prices they quote. 

The kebabs are almost always done right , the curries are loaded in richness and smothered with love. 

The sizzler is an interesting twist on the typical Mexican and Chinese offerings you get in Bombay. 

When I visit Kolkata and friends and I jam up ,  we usually order in the kebabs , the rotis (mostly atta and not the usual maida fare you get elsewhere), the curries ( and we ordered the veg options too) and the black dal. 

Unlike a lot of other joints , all food is FRESH and hot when it gets to your table or delivered to your home. 

The service can range from the pathetic (when they are super busy) to awesome when you are their only customer but the tables are always clean and their attention to hygiene is stupendous so I quite enjoy visiting them for the occasional meal. 

They have/had a combo that’s super value for money if you want to eat light. 

The owners are hands on , ensuring every customer is attended to. 

I hear they opened up a new joint at lake gardens and I hope they open up all over the city soon.

This Feast street outlet of Hindusthan Park located just opposite to the Azad Hind Dhaba. We were there at 5 pm and we have waited for around 10 minutes because it was full of people.

Decor was funky and cool. Place was very small and cozy.

After 4-5 times of asking finally a guy came to us and we ordered Murgh Angar, Lasuni Kesar malai Tikka and Murgh Cheese Kebab. All of the item was very good, but for these 3 items took above 25 mins to reach us.

Service needs an improvement definitely.

The name says it all.  Go there to FEAST on some tastiest north Indian food. 

Thumbs up - Small restaurant but really colorful and well arranged. Food is top notch be it quality,  taste, flavors and aroma,  it checks every box in one bowl. Must try is the butter chicken,  keema kulcha and dal bukhara ( simply wow,  according to me it's the best bukhara I've had after ITC Peshawari). 

Thumbs down - it's a small restaurant not much of room if u in a group of more than 4. Service might take a toll on rush hours. 

All in all a real good place and awesome experience.  Special thanks to the owner for giving a bowl of bukhara on the house, that made us order another bowl of the same. 

Cost for 2 -  600-700 ( awesome)

We need more places like this in the city.
This place has amaaazing food, which is both innovative and tasty (BONUS) and, the best part is that all the food items are quite affordable. So, you don't need to think twice before stopping by to grab something on the go. The place is itself not too big, but the utilisation of place is quite good. Not like any other tacky, cheap eatery. The look of the place and the quality of its food both have good standards. I would definitely recommend this place and if you do drop by someday, you just have to try their chicken reshmi kebab roll (and get ready to put on some extra calories).

Located beside the wise owl cafe in Hindustan park.small place but a classy decoration,wall paintings are really nice.good hospitality.
So,comming to the food.we were very much confused when we looked over their menu card.we thought "what should we order???" Their very much popular Biriyani combo??/others.so atlast we select 
1.Lasooni Kesar malai tikka(half)-comes with 4pieces.it was so soft and I couldn't found where was the malai????they just burned our orderd lasooni malai.. Really very disappointed.

After these experience we little much scared that what comes after that????
2.Tandoori roti- what is this???first off all they didn't know how tandoori roti make... Cause they totally burned roti and it was hard and taste just like a normall roti.too much disappointed.
3.Butter murgh Delhi style(full)-Really it was too good.. I very much recommend plzz try it.you surely fall in love with butter murgh. Just too good.

And tax(exclusive)
I recomend that go once/more but taste their Biriyani and don't forget to order "BUTTER MURGH DELHI STYLE".

This place has gained a crazy popularity in a short span of time. So I went there one not so fine afternoon (it was raining cats n dogs) with a friend. It is located just beside the famous "Wise Owl" cafe. Was surprised to see the place totally full and almost 6-7 people waiting outside. The staff were polite and friendly. They asked us to wait outside. Finally got a seat after almost 20-25 minutes. The place is too small with only around 5-6 tables kept so close to each other that it is hard to walk around without knocking anything down. The decor is interesting inspite of the size of the place but the tables too are very small. Plus, the place was too noisy for us to sit and dine peacefully. Anyways we ordered a "Hazar-wi murg tikka" and two "murg biriyani". The food came after a wait of another 10-15 minutes. The tikka was served over a sizzling pan on a wooden plate kinda thing with a green chutney. The tikka tasted heavenly. It was soft, succulent, juicy, well cooked and full of flavours. The tangy minty chutney totally complemented it. Next came the biriyani. It contained a big piece each of chicken and potato. It tasted too good. Well cooked rice with beautifully balanced flavours. One of the best biriyanis I have had. The quantity was generous. It was served with a complementary "burhani" which I did not like much as I don't like curd based drinks but my friend had it and said it could be had with biriyani in place of raita. Staff were courteous, nothing to complain. And the greatest surprise, no GST!! Cherry on top.
So, affordable place with great food. Will visit again.

Having heard a lot about their food, my friends and I visited this restaurant a few days back.. It is a small space located in Hindustan Park, just beside Wise Owl. The decor is quirky having colourful graffitis all over the walls. There is nothing much about the ambience, but both service and food are astounding. The staff was courteous and had thorough knowledge about their menu. We had the Lasuni Malai Kebab and Bharwan Tangri for starters. The former was quite nice but the latter was simply excellent. We had Mutton Biryani for main course which I feel could have been better, although the quantity was ample and the meat was literally falling off the bone.. For dessert, we tried the Firni which was delectable.. We loved the food and will be back soon to try out some more of their sumptuous grub!!

A gem of a place, this one serves delicious north Indian food without making a hole in the pocket. All the dishes we had were lipsmacking, especially the chicken cheese kabab, murgh tangri kabab, butter chicken delhi style and cheese kulcha. Murgh badami, full of nuts, was unconventional but yummy. The food served was hot and fresh and will make you crave for more! The interior is kinda stuffy though, the only negative point.

Finally visited this restaurant for biryani and was amazed with taste and quantity of biryani, mutton biryani was out of the world, but was little disappointed as they take a lot of time for the food to serve. Maybe we visited early that could be a reason. 
The food was served and that just brought a big smile on our hungry and starved faces. The serving is very generous and the mutton cooked really well, the rice is flavorful. The paneer item was also a good call, and tasted heavenly.

Coming to the mutton biriyani, we were happy souls at the end of the fulfilling meal.
We were full to capacity which did not let us even consider the desserts!

A decently priced menu, with generous amounts of serving. This place should be visited once.
Gst charged separately. And parking available. Pls  visit this place without a doubt.

On a Sunday I was planning for a dinner and expected to explore some new one and suddenly came across this place.So, The place is just five minutes away from Hindusthan Park and easily locatable. The restaurant was not very large. It can accomodate maximum 20 people but ambiance and decoration was decent.

So, we ordered Sugandhi aloo, Special Chiken Biryani, 
Murg Reshmi Butter Masala and Firni.

Sugandhi aloo was completely a new dish to us. So, we were so excited to try it out. The presentation of sugandhi aloo was just awesome and taste was really delicious. 
Chiken biryani was also decent and the best part was chickens were soft. It was sufficient for two people.
Murg Reshmi Butter masala was also decent and perfectly served for two people.
Firni was also good.

The restaurant is pocket friendly. So we would like to visit this place again.

Visited The Feast Street outlet in Hindustan Park..very easy to locate.When we entered this place we found it quite small but luckily we didnot have to wait.We ordered hazarwi-murgh tikka for starters,afghani murgh,butter tandoori rotis,rumali roti and keema kulcha.While waiting for our order we did enjoy those wall painting and the decor..
Let's come to the food:-
HAZAR-WI-MURGH TIKKA : it was very delicious,served on a sizzler tray.chicken was juicy,soft and felt like it melted in your mouth 😛..loved it.
AFGHANI CHICKEN: the gravy along with the chicken with rotis were very good.
KEEMA KULCHA: I didnot like this because this was supposed to be mutton stuffing but I found very less of it..
Overall, alot of tikkas are yet to be explored..

Hindustan Park and its adjoining areas are laden with uncountable cafes and restaurants serving different cuisines. In this context , I must say that among them some renowned restaurants serve good food while some new comers (having very simple ambience)serve outstanding food. The Feast Street is one of them(the latter ones). It deals in Awadhi,North Indian and even Lebanese(only wraps).
I bookmarked this one when it had 34-35 reviews only. Now reaching 1000 almost !
Today when I checked in , I felt quite annoyed because there were noise,loud chattering of people( although there were 10-11 people dining) and I found that the place is not that sort where you can sit quietly and enjoy a long chat in private. I had to raise my voice while talking to my friend sitting opposite (sharing the same table obviously). BUT when we tasted the food I felt revived .. Dishes were just Outstanding. Scrumptious..
We ordered Kasoori Murgh Kebabs, Fresh Lime Soda, Chicken tikka Wraps and Firni . The kebabs came in piping hot. Those were soft,mouthwatering. The wrap was packed with veggies and decent amount of chicken which had a nice smoky flavor. Now the firni ! It was too good... Just great.. We wanted to order their biriyani,butter chicken bt we had no space to stuff ourselves any more. Probably,next time.

Conclusion: I would like to recommend this restaurant if you want to focus on the food only and not on a soothing ambience to chat over a drink and tidbits. If you are a foodie, you must come at least once. And I assure you will revisit. As it is a budget friendly restaurant, students can enjoy delectable dishes without bothering even with a shallow pocket. Rs.750 will be enough for two.

Pros: 
My first visit experience to this place is pretty good. Approx 24 people sitting arrangements is there..  Food lovers must order Bharwan tangri, firni and masala cold drinks.. Bharwan tangri n firni is out of the world.. 

Cons:
As they serve most of the dishes in sizzler way, the only problem is the entire place becomes extremely smoky.  They must look into this by fitting some exhaust.. 

Else the place is really good!!
Enjoy 😊

The tandoori rotis were really soft... Perfect haunt for your north indian cravings.. The staff are really sincere.. We had left behind a pair of shades on the table by mistake.. One of the staff members came running behind us a long way to hand it over... Keep it up...

So, yesterday I had The Feast Street's Biryani for the second time. First time I couldn't write a review, but this time I can't contain myself.
I ordered 2 half gosht deg Biryani from swiggy, for ₹356. And swiggy delivered it in record time, so Biryani was really hot.
First comes quantity, their half Biryani was same as any other's full Biryani. Their Biryani box is one and a half times bigger than normal Biryani box. When I saw it for the first time, I was like really!? So if you feel like ordering full Biryani for 169+gst(half is for 139+gst) be sure to have a lot of space in your tummy.
Next and most important thing is taste, and it was awesomiciously delicious. Perfectly spiced, cooked to perfection, not oily at all but wasn't dry either. I was falling in love with it with every Bite. My feeling after having it was, 'ahhh, after long long time'. Yes believe me, for some time my Biryani was not going very well. Famous and well known Biryani restaurants are losing their flavour, it's really hard to find a good Biryani these days. Their Biryani will restore your faith in Biryani again.
Now enough about Biryani, now comes to other parts of it. Egg, aloo and meat, egg was absent, like in most of other restaurants. Aloo, it was good in size and flavour at same time. It didn't have that slightly sour taste from marination, which I really liked. The center of attraction mutton, was it good? No, it was awesomiciously tender, flavourful and a reminder of deliciousness. It's size big, not large or huge, but big enough to satisfy your mouth, tummy and heart. They use best quality of mutton, you can tell this just by looking at it. My piece had right amount of fat on it, was well seasoned and perfectly cooked.
Now that said, I'll stop myself before I make turn review into a love story, between me and their Biryani.
I'm planning on visiting The Feast Street next time, instead of ordering online.

Located right beside the Wise Owl cafe in Hindustan Park, the Feast Street is a welcome break from the typical North Indian restaurants around. I went in for a quick dine to try the much heard about kebabs, and I was totally satisfied. We tried the Lasooni Kesar Malai Tikka and one plate of their Special Mutton Biriyani. I loved both of them! The most important thing is that their biriyani is light, the meat is soft and one is enough to serve nearly two people. 

Although the place lacks space and becomes clumsy with too many diners, it's one of the student-friendly hangout zones. Hope to visit again soon enough to try the rest of their kebabs!

Now here comes another hidden gems from the streets of South Kolkata . On a Sunday evening I was planning for dinner and was excited to explore a new place and suddenly came across this place. 
This place is having a sitting capacity of 16-20 people . The food is really delicious specially the Briyani, the Murg Afgani and the kebabs . The stuffs are very friendly nd the owner is a really nice person . He personally tries to attend each and every customer so that they can serve their customers at their best . Waiting to visit their newly opened branch in near future...

Foods are ok.. but, takes an era to serve the foods, even tells that the ordered food is not available after 1 hour  of taking order.. ambiences is not so good. Its good to order online from this restaurant .. but not to come here for a dine out.

Starters are awesome... Best part is that they have the menu to order a dish in half (if you eat less) and the price is also comparable ... 1000 bucks for two (with a happy tummy)
😊😊

Pros:
1. Cheap and Best
2. Friendly People
3. Good for Moghlai dishes and their starter

Cons.
1. Bit noisy
2. Small place
3.May face queues

Food is great, the ambiance is too much congested... could have been better specially in peak hours.. Masala kulcha was tender, bharwan tangri was too good, tikka masala could have a little less tangy..all over it's good..

Located in a lane which houses two of my favourite restaurants, Feast Street is a gem which fills your tummy without burning a hole in your pocket. 

Starters- Lasooni Murgh Malai Tikka Kebab. The dish was spot on with soft, succulent chicken which melts with the first bite! 

Mains- 1) Gosht Deg Biryani- The Biryani was good, accompanied by a Burhanni which was quite bland. Of course, one must have had better Biryani but this was light enough considering I was not in the best of health during this visit. 
2) Delhi Style Butter Chicken- of course, this one had to be ordered going by the innumerable Zomato reviews. Did not let us down especially with way too many pieces than we could finish and had to pack the rest. 

Definitely a must try place in terms of food! 

In terms of hygiene though, this place has a long way to go. Hoping for some improvement in my next visit. Thank you.

Went there during pujas. So had to wait for an hour to get a table. Well the place was nice . . .bit small but okish sort. Now coming to the food me and my friend ordered lasooni Kesar malai tikka for starters . . that tasted good . . The gosht biryani was okish sort . .a bit dry and the Burhani which came with the biryani as a complimentary drink was awful . . . I hated it completely and lastly we had masala cola . And then for takeaway I ordered butter tandoori roti with butter murgh Delhi style  . . .the rotis were completely burnt and so we couldn't had it  . . . butter murgh was okish. So to sum it up I'll just say it was a decent place . . you can give it a try here otherwise you can find much better and affordable food joints than this.

Coming to the food, I liked the kababs and Biryani that we ordered. It's a little noisy if there are too many diners. Plan to visit again and try their other dishes.

We went in for a quick bite over here on a rainy evening post Diwali. The place is cozy with just 5-6 tables to relax upon just beside wise Owl. Interior is just okayish with a few artistic pieces on the wall. Amongst all this, the food out here outstands the norms. We went in for bharwan tangri(stuffed chicken legs) and firni; collectively mind-blowing to taste and satisfying in price and amount. Though the service was slow but we enjoyed chatting so it didn't matter much. I'll definitely like to visit again to try their other specialities.
Mean while this place is a must visit folks.

The food was served hot. The pankhai kebabs were juicy, tender and full of flavours. The lasooni nun and bhuna gosht tastes exotic and were fresh from the oven. Do give a visit and explore more.

A note to all, this place allows you to order half a plate of any dishes.

It has been a wonderful day today. All thanks to this amazing little place called The Feast Street. It is located at Hindustan Park, just beside The Wise Owl. The place is not very big and at most 25 people can sit. The decor is quite quirky with wall art and everything. But the best thing about this place is its food. We ordered Lasooni Malai Tikka Kebab, one mutton biriyani, stuffed and keema kulche and Delhi style butter chicken with soft drinks. The food was top notch, both in quality and quantity. The kebab was the best item no doubt. The chicken was extremely soft and it literally melted in our mouths. The portions were pretty decent. The service was a bit slow but the staffs were polite and well behaved.
Definitely recommended.

After a long wait I visited The Feast Street. We were greeted like as if we are their relatives by which I meant to say that their interaction with the customers is too good which is rare. The space is too less in this branch so about ambience I must say that its just good.
Speaking about the food I took #Murgh_Surg_Ansar, #Pomfret_Tandoor, #Butter_Murgh_Delhi_Style, #Mutton_Biriyani, #Rabri.
All the foods were awesome but especially I loved their Pomfret Tandoor and the Rabri,there was a uniqueness in both of their taste.

This outlet provides a soothing environment for foodies who are in a mood to try mughlai and Afghani dishes. The food is class apart and could be rated among the best restaurants in south Calcutta vying for  recognition as providers of mouth watering "Biriyani". The staff are also well-behaved and provide for a good hangout option for people looking for good Adda and food. However, space constraint is  definitely a "con" and a restaurant without a restroom is also not quite attractive attribute. The service is also bit slow and basic facilities after food such as "finger-bowl" are also not provided. That apart, if you are looking for a sumptuous Biriyani meal...do try out this outlet!

And I thought it couldn't get any better than Arsalan Biryani.
Have been longing to go to the Feast Street ever since I heard about this place from a friend. And so I did, this Diwali/Kali Pujo with my brother. Standing dully on the Purna Das Road, Ballygunge, The Feast Street, Hindustan Park has unequivocally once and for all settled the decade long debate & proved that Kolkata Biryani is better its Hyderabadi counterparts. The interior isn't very spacious but has been very tastefully decorated with graffiti on one wall and very unique Street food photos hanging from the opposite making the place very interesting and way out of the box. The art on the menu is captivating as well. Normally I would just jump to the food section but I spent 3 minutes looking at the front page. We ordered Fresh lime soda, Gosht Degh Biryani (Mutton) , Mixed raita and Firni. The Biryani wasn't too spicy or dry. It maintained the perfect balance between all the parameters, the Mutton was effortlessly coming off the bones and melt in our mouths. Honestly, it couldn't get any better. The only reason why I've deducted 0.5 from the rating is because the Raita was too sour and the Firni could've been better. Anyways, had a great time. Hoping to come back soon.

Though the first time when i ordered food from this place i was pissed off with the quality of the food, but the second time they proved me wrong in every sense.
Now i can say that The Feast Street provides good quality food that satisfies our taste buds to great extent. The delhi stlye butter chicken has now became my favourite. And yeah one will never regret their pholko luchi with kosha manghso (that is mutton cooked in spices). The mutton biriyani with the perfect flavours in it was indeed great in taste.
Once i was so pissed off that i promised not to visit this place again, but now i would say, i am looking forward to visit this place again and again.
The place is a budget friendly one with good food in both quality and quantity wise. And they provide great hospitality.

In one word great. How much you eat it will never make a hole in your pocket. In this amount or budget it will serve you the best mutton. Specially the biriyani is not at all oily and the mutton pieces are just Wow! So succulent so soft. The space is just the negative thing that works against them though they have worked regarding that and have opened a new bigger outlet near prince anwar shah road

Quite a small resturant with young people. Well rating has been given purely on the basis of food only. Ambience is good but only one ac was on and it was not that cool inside the restro. I was feeling hot in there. Coming to the food part its a magical place for non vegetarian people. Its pocket friendly and delicious at the same time. Veg items were less and starters on veg was very ordinary. Main course is also less but delicious. A must place to visit coz its pocket friendly and delicious at d same time

The Feast Street has another outlet in Lake Gardens. This seems to be the main outlet. Ironically I liked the food served in the other outlet more. 

We took a Murgh Surg Angar, a Special chicken Biryani and a mutton side dish. Everything was lacking the special aroma that comes with Biryani and mutton. 

Even the kebabs were just regular and had no distinct taste.!

Would I go again? I would rather go to their Lord's More outlet.

Lovely place with very courteous staff.
Visited this place few hours back and it was buzzing with people.
They have small seating arrangements due to lack of space but the food makes up for it!
The lady who took our orders was very polite and she interacted with all the customers very nicely. She's great at recommending food and will give you honest feedbacks if the food is gonna take a lot of time.
Now coming to the food!
We ordered,
•Kasoori murgh malai tikka- 6/5
Moist and soft chicken which were cooked to perfection!!! Tasted really nice.Definitely recommended and also they serve good sized pieces.
• Butter naan- 5/5
I've had naan at almost all the Indian eateries and seldom what happens is that the naan is either very chewy or burnt in the middle. But this place serves damn good naans! It was smothered with perfect amount of butter and there was no charring.
•Butter chicken Delhi style- agaaain. This was amazing. 5/5. They served such a big portion that it was more than enough for two of us. They cooked the chicken really good and the gravy was so very nice!

Now coming to the small bits
The tables have tissue stands which is a big plus!
The staff service is quick.
Food takes some time but it's worth the wait.
Very, very affordable and will not burn a hole in your pocket.

Will definitely visit this place again. Although I've tried only three items but those were the better than I've had anywhere else before!

After visiting their outlet at Lake Gardens and falling in love with their Murgh Cheese Kebab, I decided on indulging into another plate in this outlet. I highly recommend this dish to each and everyone who plans to visit this place. If you are a cheese lover like me, you are sure to drool over this dish. Other than this, I love their Biriyani too. This place has delicious food at reasonable rates and you will find it crowded even on weekdays in the afternoons. Their service is a bit slow, may be coz they do not have enough staff, but other than that I have absolutely no complaint from Feast Street. I absolutely love this place and will surely come here again! 😃

The LASOONI KESAR MURGH MALAI TIKKA was so tender & juciy

And of course the desserts... FIRNI & SAHI TUKDA were  just perfect.

We planned for this place before and visited on Choturthi evening. Luckily we didn't have to wait to get a seat.. This is small cosy place with around 20 persons seating.
We ordered :

Pomfret Tandoor which was good but not great..However my wife, being a fish lover liked it.

Fried chicken -- Not sure about the name. Chicken pieces were soft and juicy and the tangy sauce with it was lip-smacking. Haven't found it in Zomato menu. It was priced around 150 for 6 pcs which is pretty cheap!!!!

Murgh deg Biriyani --  It was very much oily although taste wise good.

Service: The starters were served within 15-20 minutes however the biriyani was served after almost an hour... It seemed they have served our order to some other tables...

Overall the bill was less than 700 which was value for money for 2 persons...

Biriyani is good,could have been better and the quantity of the biriyani is good.chicken gravy item was spicy and hot. The main drawback is the accommodation. Very less number of table,so if you like to go in weekend you might be wait in queue. overall good experience, pocket friendly.

Coming to the best part , the food , we ordered Afghani kebab for starters , for main course we took butter nan Murgh Reshmi butter masala (BEST) , Anda deg biriyani and Dhaniya murgh. We loved all the food items equally. I did not like the Dhaniya Murgh much , but my friends liked it. Overall , this is a really nice hidden outlet , everyone should pay a visit atleast once.

The accommodation is quite small and the service is very slow. By the time the side dishes had arrived, our biryani had gone cold. Extremely poor service although the food was alright.

A small restaurant only in terms of space. They have one of the most enticing moghlai cuisine menu.
Bharwan Tangri kebab-One of the best kebabs we've ever had. Creamy afghani kebab-oh the cream.. delicious. Cheese kulcha was soft and mutton rarha was the perfect maincourse. The dessert section is also pleasing.
We also had their Afgaan tangri kebab and Delhi style butter chicken. Any words in their would be less. So go and try it for yourselves. The food is surely overwhelming. 
Surely the best tandoors and moghlai food in this city.

I had an awful experience. Half the things in the menu were not available. We had to wait for ages for the food though only two tables with five people were occupied. The water glasses remained unfilled. The food was mediocre. Not even a toothpick or mint was served at the end of the meal. The only good thing was that it was pocket friendly. I will never go back to the place.

The Feast Street has been there in my bucket list for so long and finally made it to this little food joint during Puja along with my two friends. we went there at 1:30am and it was crowded by then ofcourse. We waited for 1 hour. Finally when I entered I realised that I made mistake by asking a table for 4 intsead of 3. but the owner was so kind that he managed a table for us somehow. Entering the restaurant the quirky decor and the warm reception of the owner absolutely changed our mind. He was so attentive and he helped us to select from the menu, all the dishes are absolutely recommended. We had CSB AFGHANI MURGH, RUMALI ROTI AND CHICKEN MIRCH MASALA. As the name suggests CSB Afghani Murgh was totally cheesy and our minds were blown away by it. it was the winner dish of the day. Then came Rumali Roti and Chicken Mirch Masala- the gravy was spicy and tangy-completely loved it. Quantity is very good and price is very reasonable. It was a great experience...definitely going to visit it again. :)

Visited during puja with friends and family...a good place to hangout. It is located jst beside wise owl in puja das road but it is not very spacious and specially during the puja' s since the crowd was more it was clumsy. But nevertheless the food was delicious specially the kebab and the quantity is also satisfying. The staff is also good and take proper care in hospitality. Hope to visit it again soon and satisfy my taste buds with those amazing dishes.😊

This food joint has been one of my favorites off late. As it is in close proximity to our office, we order quite frequently from here. So far whatever we have ordered has been extremely good in taste. The best part is that the rates are very reasonable. I will recommend the Delhi style Butter Chicken which is excellent.
                    

We ordered Chole Bhaturey. Delivery time was quick. The food was neatly packed in a very nicely designed tray. The bhatura was quite big and filling. It was well balanced, neither very deep fried nor too soggy. Chole was tasty, but the quantity was little less. I would suggest them to use two compartments for choley and the third one for onion+chili+lemon.
                    

Today I ordered 4 pieces of Chicken Changezi but received only 2 pieces. We also ordered for Keema Pulao but got normal biriyani instead of that. Sorry but need to pull down the rating because of this.

This place is just beside Wise owl @purna das road.
This is a small joint considering it's capacity.Among the newly opened places this has a great rating! It was a takeaway so can't say much about the ambience but the decor was pretty ordinary with plastic chairs as seating arrangements!the place was dimly lit, oveall it was not at all appealing for a dine out!
We had a special mutton biryani, murg begum bahar & awadhi dum gosht! The biryani was excellent both taste & quantity wise!The mutton was very spicy & the chicken a bit less but spicey enough! Though the price is on the higher side but the portion they serve is quite fulfilling. But I personally don't like such punjab influenced heavy spiced Delhi style mughlai, so except the biryani I don't have plans for a 2nd visit!

It was a good decision to eat at The Feast Street today. I was a bit apprehensive as the place looked slightly unkept but the food and service more than made up for it.

We ordered the biriyani combo, which came with chicken chaap and reshmi tikka. The food tasted very good and service was prompt. It was pocket friendly as well.

I wish they add more items to the dessert section in the days to come. But overall, a good lunch!

Cozy and nice decorated food joint!
We ordered Hazar-wi Tikka Murg as starter which came with all guns blazing.. Soft, tender, delicious chicken pieces smoked perfectly and delicately...
Tasted very nice...
Then, we had Special Gosht Deg Biriyani, which is originally Mutton Biriyani with 2 pcs of mutton & aloo & one boiled egg.. With this, we ordered badami Murg which is buttery and soft gravy.. But should have taken a bit more spicy options, such as achari murg or Tikka Butter Masala.. Both of the dish tasted so good (looked great as well), that we forgot about taking snap of it.. 😜
Ended with strong and tingy Burhani & Masala Cola which tasted really great after all those spicy food!!

The Feast Street - This name just not justify when you will see the restaurant, but let's have your food there, you will relaize it could not have a better name than this. Reason - the place is really small , you will not ever think you can have a feast there. But the X factor is the food, which makes you relaize you are having a feast enjoy a quite large amount and different ( like long Street , never ending) food.

Yes, it is already a quite a popular name, and had a plan also to be there long back. So, at last we are here.

Location: 
______________

It's in the Purnadas Road , Hindustan Park. Just beside the Wise Owl, very near to Hindustan Park fab India.

Decoration:
______________

Very small outlet, so a bit congested. But the small place is fine decorated. But having the sitting arrangement only for 14 people maximum. So that is just a drawback there.

Food:
___________

As I already mentioned, the food is the main USP here.

✓ Afgani Tengri Half : the half one comes in 4 pieces and Full in 6 pieces. This items was tengri kebab but present in the sizzler plate. And the taste was just owssum. The chicken was that juicy and soft. Excellent one.

Now we thought of tried some of their combos. But as they told that are not available in weekend. But fortunately we got one.

✓Hing kochuri with keema Ghugni - the hung kochuri was just superb. Properly made. There was just no scope in grievance. Not oily even. And the keema ghuni tasted also superb. Proper amount of keema cooked with perfection.

✓ Mutton Kasa -  actually we thought of tried their combo of luchi and mutton kasa. It was not available. So, we took it seperately. And thankfully we took it. It was owsum in taste. We tried it with Hing er kochuri even. That combo was just mouthwatering. Took full plate of it, comes with 4 pieces.

✓ Special Ghost Biriyani - owssum in taste. Well cooked less oily rice with just soft tender mutton pieces. It comes with 2 pieces of mutton, 2 pieces of Aloo and 1 piece of egg. More than enough for two. 

✓ Special Chicken Biriyani : if you love mutton the ghost biriyani is best for you otherwise go for this one. Owssum one again. With 2 pieces of well cooked chicken, 2 pieces of Aloo and one piece of egg.

✓ Butter Murg Delhi style half - it comes with four pieces of chicken. The gravy need a special mention here. The taste is just superb. Do note : it is not boneless. Excellent one.

✓ Mixed Raita - coming in a big ball. If you are fond of it , you will love it for sure. Very very nice. Sufficient for 4 to 6 people.

✓ Green Salad - it was just not needed :P but one of my health conscious friend opted for it. And it came with a twist, when it came we found it has onion, carrots, tomato- but no greenery was there. So, I asked my friend- what salad you ordered? The answer was green salad. We asked the person then who took the order, came to know Cucumber is not there :P so, it is a " Not a Green Salad" you can say.

✓ last but not the least ordered 3 bottle of thumbs up. 300 ml.


The experience is just superb. The quality and quantity of food is just mind blowing.

Only two things : the staff need a bit experience, which I am sure just a few days matter. And as you guys growing hope to see you guys in a bigger outlet with more sitting arrangement. Best luck to you :)

So, all that came 1607 INR for 4 people. And we were just stomach full.

To All : hopefully now you can understand why I mentioned that we had a feast there. It's a experience for food lovers. So, go there - experience it.

Writing my 50th Review on zomato today . ❤😍

Visited this place a week ago . It was full as the place is very small and can accommodate not more than 20 people at a time .

We took our seats after waiting for 20-25 mins . The interiors are funky with quotes about food and photo frames of food items . Ambience is kind of ok. 3/5

We ordered :

Delhi Style Fried Tangdi - I was blown away after having this .I have never had a better Fried Chicken in my life . Very crispy on the outside and tender inside . 5/5

Murgh Mirch Masala - This gravy dish was good . Four pieces of chicken in a spicy gravy is what you get . Could have been better though . 4/5

Butter Tandoori Roti - Nice . Soft and went very well with the Chicken dish . 4/5

Gosht Deg Biryani - Ordered this with a lot of expectations . But was disappointed with it . The biryani was missing the flavour . I hope it was an off day because have heard good things about their biryani . The mutton piece was tender and tasted good . 3/5

Service - Quick . They managed everything quite well given the rush . We only had to wait for water a couple of times and it's understandable . 4/5

Pocket Pinch : Reasonable . A full course meal for two won't cost more than 800 bucks .

I really loved this place!
The seating is too clustered together though; but the food fills up the negative part. 
The chicken was too succulent and soft. I tried the bharwan tangri which had a very small piece of bone and the rest of it was full of flesh and had a filling inside too. Totally worth the price.
The main course we had was of murgh reshmi butter masala and rumali roti.
The reshmi butter masala was heavenly. Full of butter and creamy dreamy! The chicken melted in our mouths. But one minus point was that the roti was undercooked and stiff.
Will have to go back for the mutton dishes this place has to offer.
The pocket pinch is not at all a lot. All over this is a nice place to dine out now and then since it is light on the pocket and heavy in the belly. 
Food is a 4.5/5 will give this place a 5 for sure if the roti wasn't undercooked.

Visited this place today evening after getting positive reviews from a colleague. The management needs to do something about the door. The restaurant has the most inconvenient point of entry. But apart from that every other aspect was nothing but positive. This eatery is located right next to the Wise Owl Cafe or opposite to the Azad Hind Hindustan Park outlet(whichever is convenient). The place specializes in North Indian cuisine especially kebabs. The range of items will surely confuse anybody no matter how big an expert you are. If in doubt about any dish, make sure to ask the person serving you. They are more than happy to help you out. We had ordered masala kulcha, cheese kulcha and butter murgh delhi style. While the cheese kulcha and butter murgh were clear yorkers that caught us off guard, the masala kulcha wasn't exactly what we were expecting. It's just a normal kulcha with some herbs sprinkled on top brushed up with oil.
The cheese kulcha was really really good with molten cheese and herbs making up the top layer of the kulcha. The dough was also very soft. 5/5 Make sure to try out this kulcha from a long list of ever confusing kulchas and rotis.
The butter murgh delhi style was butter chicken with cream sprinkled on top of it. The chicken was tender, well marinated and perfectly seasoned. The gravy was just perfect. Full marks for the composition of the gravy and the colour was just beautiful. Again 5/5. That creaminess in the gravy was pretty evident. Portions served are also pretty decent. Looking forward to my next visit. Also do try out their recently opened Lake Gardens outlet.

Went there on a friend's suggestion. Very easy to locate the place was open at mid night during the durga puja. The dining area is small and has a modern urban décor. Place has been utilised well and the wall arts are funky. 
We were two , we ordered 1 mutton biriyani, 1 chicken chap, 1 mutton bhuna , tandoori roti , 1 full plate Kabab, 1 rabri, roomali roti. 
The chicken lashuni kabab was had a charcoal crisp outside but the chicken was very juicy seasoned perfectly and tasted awesome. The mutton bhuna had loads of black pepper , the mutton pieces were moist and perfectly cooked, the chicken chap was also well cooked and well seasoned and light on spice scale. The biriyani was however bit dry, the mutton was bit chewy  and had almost no spice on the mutton. The tandoori roti was also a turn down. The nan on the other table looked awesome. But the tandoori roti I ordered was not up to the mark. 
The winner was the Rabri, the owner insisted for a bowl of rabri. After much thought we ordered , and thank God we ordered it . It was soul touching..

The bill was around Rs 1200. With roomali roti and one mutton bhuna for parcel. 
It's a good place to have a friend get together over some kabab , chap and off course Rabri.

I went with my friends on Asthami. As you know by the day, the restaurant was crowded like hell. We waited for about one and a half hours. My friends were shouting at me as this was my plan to have our lunch over here.

But they all thanked me after the lunch. The food was sooooo good 😍. We ordered butter naan and butter chicken (which was their speciality). It was worth the wait. 

We also order murgh mirch masala which I didnt like much (maybe it was the after effect of having butter chicken 😜). My friend ordered murgh biriyani which was good as well. But I didnt like it quantity wise. 

Overall the food was yummy in respect to their prices. Its cheap for college going students like me. I will definitely recommend everyone to try their butter chicken. I'm sure you wont regret.

It was a planned visit as I'd read some amazing reviews of this place on some food blogs. Located in the quiet and serene bylanes of Hindustan park, it's not very difficult to locate, just adjacent to wise owl.
We went on a weekday afternoon, yet there was a decent crowd there.
Now I wanna start straight with the food before talking about anything else, because that's the USB of this place. One word : EXCELLENT!
I mean if the review was solely based on quality and quantity of food , I would have rated it straight 5
The food served here is just amazing. The menu is very desi and traditional, exactly how the majority common mass likes it. The best thing about the menu is that, almost every item comes in two size proportions, small and large, right from the starters to all the main course items. So you can customise your options and try out more items with less pocket pinch .
Prices are amazingly reasonable according to food quality and quantity. Our bill for two was only ₹450 for a wholesome lunch.
Service is more or less okay.
The -0.5 is only due to the fact that the place is a little too cramped. Already the no. Of seats are very less, and those that are there ,are also not very spaciously arranged.If u go in a big group, be sure to occupy almost 70% of the restaurant 😂
The place gives a tough competition to the best restaurants in town in terms of food. Way to go 👏

'The Feast Street' is located in Hidusthan Park next to 'The Wise Owl'. We enter here for our Nabami lunch.

The restaurant was not spacious enough. Pujo lunch includes waiting time, but one would not really like it if the person managing inside was talking to some customers for a long time leading to waste of more time. Differential treatment leding to problem of other customer's should be avoided at all costs.They did use two big umbrellas outside . They could have easily used two tables and 8 chairs outside leading to effective time management. However,they have kept free water bottles for everyone waiting outside. Brownie points for that.

After waiting for over 1 hour 15 minutes we got two seats. We order two combos of Mutton biryani and chicken chap. The wait time for the food was unbearble . It was the Pujas,understandable. However, a wait time of nearly 30 minutes is not appreciated.

Our food came finally . The rice was not piping hot but was delicious. The mutton was soft,juicy and delicious. The Chicken chap was also delicious. The Chicken piece was thankully a leg piece. The leg piece was juicy and tender. The food was served with complimentary salad.

We expect better time maangement and better coordination between the staff the next time. When we asked for a spoon to eat, they gave us serving spoons. This is unacceptable in everyway. Hoping for a better service next time.

Incredible food, enormous portions, friendly vibe. All good things, and the CSB Afghani murgh is my latest love. Must have! The lady overseeing things was considerate enough to stall the main course (murgh biryani and gosht chaap) while my friend and I were still munching on the fried chicken wings (that sauce, though, was something else), and then we had to pack the biryani anyway because we were too full. Do visit The Feast Street to have amazing food at even more amazing prices! So pocket-friendly!

Amazing food. Great quality and great quantity. The best was the CSB Chicken Afghani Kebab as it was really non spicy and was served with white gravy. We also tried the stuffed kulcha and butter nun which were really soft. You guys can also try the Special Ghosht Biriyani and the Chicken Butter Masala cooked in Delhi Style which were also less oily. And last but not the least the Firni. Oh My God, too yummy. Guys, you can also try the Dhaniya Chicken and the Lachha Paratha which I had on my second visit to this amazing place. I am hitting this place real soon and would be continuing as it is really serves amazing food and off course it is pocket friendly. Guys, you all must must must visit this tiny little place.

After pandal hopping when you are hell hungry, you deserve good food. My friend suggested this place. The space is small but the interior is uber cool. Food was also good. May be because of the puja rush, there are certain things this place needs to have, like regular cold drinking water or serving finger bowl.  We ordered Murg Surg Angaar and Chiken Biriyani and it was tasty. They need to increase the size of the place or shorten the number of tables as while serving both the parties were facing problems.

Visited for the first time on Shoshti. The place is small and it was crowded (for obvious reason). It was really nice of them to hand out bottle of water (kinley)to each customer waiting outside.

We ordered (for 2 people)-

Butter Murgh Delhi style (4pc): it was awesome. Gravy was rich and flavourful without sinking under a layer of fat/oil....chicken pieces (bone in) were well cooked and succulent.

Butter naan: it was good. soft....not too thick. With a good amount of butter.

Murgh Deg Biryani (half portion): it was good. Flavourful.

Burhani: complimentary with the biryani (yay.....!!!) it tasted really good.

What I loved about the place is that the owners make sure they try to offer their best service to the customers. They have a really polite staff. kept their cool even during the puja rush. Highly recommend this place.

A small food joint located beside the wise owl. Went on nabami 2017 after seeing the ratings on zomato with great expectations for lunch. Had to wait very long for getting seats and then for placing orders. Orderd biriani combos. Murg biriani with mutton chap and masala cola.
The biriani was cold and the quantity was less.   The taste was also average. Didn't like much. The chicken in the biriani was very chewy.
Coming to the the mutton it was smelly. The typical smell that comes from the meat if not washed or prepared well. Comparatively the mutton biriani with chicken chanp was better. I totally think the ratings are not worth.

After a lot of research the night before we decided to try this food stop for ashtami lunch. We reached there at around 3:30pm nd it was the peak hr so we were told to wait fr atleast an hr. There was a long queue nd the place had less seatings compared to the  crowd. Finally after waiting for an hr nd 15 mins we got our call. There was two of us . As we entered, the ambience was pretty good . Good music was playing! The staffs were very courteous.
Now coming to the food ,
We ordered 
1. Murgh surg angar full (kebab) as starter 
It was just as we wanted, perfectly grilled, crispy from outside nd soft from inside .
2. Rumali roti 
Normal chapatis 
3. Bhuna gosht 
It was a mixture of spices,flavours nd the mutton was well cooked.
4. Biriyani combo
(Gosht biriyani,murgh chaap,salad)
The rice was nice, flavoured,well cooked nd oily so that you dont chock. They serve it with half a piece of alu nd a good piece of mutton. Though the mutton was nicely boiled still I found it quite tough nd dry . That was a con .
They also served a cup of burhani with the platter ( a digestive drink made with curd nd necessary spices)
The chaap was tasty as well.
5. Soft drinks ( thumsup 300ml each)
The portions of every dish were sufficient enough !
Its was quite a good experience overall nd they made our ashtami ! 
I will definitely say that the long wait was worth it ! :)
Will definitely love to visit again !

Visited this new joint on the occasion of Durga Pujo.
Ofcourse they had a new festive season menu to meet the huge footfall but they didn't fail to meet iur expectations with the amazing food and courteous service.

Coming to food we ordered few items which are:
●lasooni kesar malai tikka-this is an amazing choice for a starter and the kebabs had been made to perfection with great flavours. This comes in two variants,4&6 pieces.

●Ghosht Biryani-Ordered the full biryani which comes with aloo. If one wants the typical kolkata biryani with egg then the special biryani is to go for.Also,this comes with a complementary burhani.

●Butter Naan: This could be made a little more softer. Other than that it was nice.

●Chicken Bharta- Ordered this go to with the Butter nun and I completely digged this item. It was totally buttery with huge amount of shreded chicken. Loved this dish.

Service:
Coming to the service it was absolutely great. Amazing work on part of the management. To meet and manage the huge crowd they even provided cars to take the ones waiting for a seat to their lake gardens branch which was amazing. Because such things aren't really common in Kolkata.
Definitely looking forward to trying the other items aS this place deserves multiple visits.

Went there on nabami night during 2017 durga puja,  after seeing 4.5 review along with my girlfriend.  Very much dissatisfied. First of all had to wait long for my order to come.  I ordered a fried chicken wings and a chicken biryani and mutton chaap combo and she ordered a chicken chaap and butter tandoori roti. 
 First of all we liked the chickn wings better than rest of the food,  even though the fried wings didnt have any sign of a little spiciness.  The chicken chaap was totally tasteless along with hard rotis. The chicken biryani was   good, being a mild one.  Mutton chaap was horrible. Totally filled with salt. I couldn't eat the gravy as it was entirely burnt with salt.  Except for the chickn wings it was totally a disheartening experience for us. Could have been much better

It was really good..  we had the biriyani combo.. seriously it was enough for one person.. the most important thing was the price. It was comparatively low with respect to other restuarants and quality of food... Already suggested my other frnz. Will love to visit again. 

One cons- as the place was small it was too crowdy and too much noise.. 

Maybe you can look after this . Otherwise 5star...👌👌

I went to this place with my parents for a hearty lunch. The place is quite small with hardly 10-12peoples to accomodate. Everything was quite good except for the service- it was quite slow. Ambience was good. Coming to the food, we ordered chicken biryani,chickem reshmi butter masala, tandoori roti and paneer pulao. Though we initially ordered peas pulao but they told us after 20mins that they can serve paneer pulao instead of peas pulao and so we agreed to it. The biryani was very good; it was full of flavour. The reshmi butter masala was good too and was great when accompanied with tandoori roti and paneer pulao. As i have mentioned already the service was slow.  Everything else was good.

Now coming to the food. We ordered CSB Afghani Murgh, Butter Murgh Delhi Style and Butter Naan. The food quality was very nice. They took a bit long to serve the food. But that's okay. I would like to visit again to try out other dishes.

After waiting for more than an hour on Sashti, the food was definitely disappointing and not worth the wait. We ordered Chicken Biryani and Butter Murg Delhi Style. The chicken in Biryani tasted awful. Also, two of the chicken pieces from the side dish were slightly underdone. However, the complimentary Burhani did taste good.

Chicken biriany : very tasty item having good quantity of rice a big aloo and a big chicken piece....very light and comes with a cup of burani....2 full plate of biriany is sufficient for 3 big foodies like us....169 rs for full plate....

Delhi style butter murgh : super delicious dish with 6 pieces chicken and buttery gravy.....lovely dish....259 rs for 6 pieces....

Ambience : near about 150 square foot place nicely decorated....

Management : it is the best thing and deserves 10 rating out of 5....everyone have so nice behavior and helpful....

Price : reasonable....easily comparable with taste....

It will come in the top 5 restaurants of kolkata according to me.there is another outlet is now in laketown....wishing them big success in future...

Located near Hindustan park mainly near Azad Hind Dhaba ...
It is saptami and we made a plan to have some kebabs nd north indian food..so I chose the place..
My first big disaapointment was that we had to wait for a very lonh time...mainly when we placed our order , we were served after 45min approx..so for me..during puja time.service rate is 2/5.
I just gave 4.5 as a whole just because of the food quality and the decor..though the place was cozy but soothing ambiance.
Now come to the food..we ordered.
CSB CHICKEN TANDOOR MURGH (Kebab)
BUTTER NUN
STUFFED KULCHA
BHUNNA MUTTON
MASALA COLD DRINKS
I hv tasted such kebab for the very first time..the tandoor was well cooked with loaded gravy..
Butter nun is always favourite for me..The stuffed kulcha was really good in taste..one myst try it..
Bhunna mutton is well cooked...much much much spicyyyy ..The masala cold drink was too refshing..
I loved the food..i would like to visit here again..but not during pujasss...it's just.....hope all can understand☺

After hearing a lot about this cheap yet good little food joint on one fine evening we decided to give it a try .. 
firstly delivery was prompt.. food reached within 45 minutes 
Now the food .. 
pudina rumali roti: was a bit sceptical about this one but turned out to be really good (4.5/5)

Lucknowi paratha: fine but could be better (3/5) 

Delhi fried chicken tangdi: big leg pieces of chicken deep fried in a kfc-ish batter (4/5) 

Chicken lehsuni kesar malai tikka: nice soft succulent.. could taste both the lehsun and malai 
(4.5/5) 

Sigree paneer tikka: usual paneer tikka with rather big pieces (4/5) 

Delhi style butter chicken: it was quite good actually .. can compete with the  biggies (4.5/5) 

Chicken bharta: quite nicely cooked and they served it with 4 egg pieces(4.5/5) 

Paneer butter masala: soft pieces of paneer in a nicely prepared gravy(4.5/5) 

Shahi tukra: tasted good but the consistency was more like a halwa (3.5/5) 

Phirni: again this item can compete with aminia, arsalan and all the big names in the business (4.5/5)

Now this big order for 8 people cost only 2498 rs .. not even 350 per person :D found my new North Indian food heaven :D

I must have to say,not up to the mark according to the rating..they behave in a very well manner but they need to give more importance to the quality of food nd they can do lot better..the biryani was below average with chicken kasha without any similarity to it's average test like in all reastaurant....the space is too small for a restaurant to rise to the top favourite list of foodies...the whole management team can be more professional,skilled nd in good harmony...

A very good ambience with good food. Friendly service.  Snacks and kebabs are a must try. And the best part they give they are giving 10% discount coupons for their new outlet. So why not? 😍

In this festive season found a cozy restaurant.... We waited outside for about half an hour.. But soon after tasting the food we realized the wait was worth it... Odered Lasoni Malai Tikka kebab as starter ... It tastes out of the world... Murgh deg Biryani and butter murgh Delhi style are also worth mentioning...

Barely 500sqft, but this will undisputedly serve you one thing... QUALITY FOOD!

And, as for these festive days, quality along with quantity is one of rarer things u find...

We ordered Zeenat-e-Aab, pure and succulent fish kebabs; such a protein  punch it was...

Next came, the royal combination of Mutton Deg Biriyani and Butter Murg Delhi Style

Biriyani needs a special mention... From the aroma to the soft mutton, and obviously to go with that Burhani.. One of the best & unique Biriyanis I have ever had

Lastly, from the owner to the service, one of the friendliest people serving for you in this town!!!!

The food is good. I ate a mutton biriyani combo according to the price the quantity of the food is good as well as the taste of the food. But the service is not that good I think its because of durga puja

This is one gem of a restaurant . I'm usually never satisfied with North Indian foods in other restaurant but this one filled me with satisfaction on the first bite . Cool decor with moderate ambience , located beside Wise Owl . There is Television so you can watch sports . They sure do take their time with the orders . We ordered Malai Kabab , Fish tawa masala, Murgh Biriyani . The Kabab was okayish , I've had better , but the Biriyani was one of the best I had in Kolkata . Same goes for the Fish tawa masala .

First of all let's clear one thing, if you are gonna have a full course meal i.e. starter, main course and dessert, then only it will cost you around Rs. 700 here. If  you look at the menu you will realise that it's a very affordable restaurant and as the rating says, the food is really good. It has a north Indian cuisine. We ordered chicken butter masala and tandoori roti and I must say, the chicken blew me away. It was very nicely cooked. The chicken almost melted in the mouth. The people working there are really nice and a pleasure to talk to. Overall I had a very nice experience at an affordable price, hence I am coming back to this place very soon.

Awesome service. Today I went there with a small gang of 6 people around 4pm at the evening near Hindustan park. They told us to wait for 30mins. We all were very hungry & frustrated due to our spontenuous pandle hopping. After waiting for around 30min the owner of the shop personally came to us & said ' we are unable to give you seats but we have our new brunch at lord's more near Rabindra sarobar metro station'. They offered us car 😂😂 . Yea u are actually reading the right thing. They drove us by their own car. I am really touched by this gesture. Take a bow! 🙌 Atleast we have our meal. Chicken biryani special with kebabs. Borhani was as a compliment. Biriyani was really good! Chicken piece was tender & quantity was really incredible. I want to suggest everyone to go there .

Ordered Bhuna Gosht and Chicken Bharta with Tandoori Roti. The taste was awesome and definitely value for money. I would definitely recommend the Bharta to anyone who goes there. Even though it doesn't taste like the traditional bharta, it's lip-smacking. Definitely give it a try. 
We went there amidst pandal-hopping. The ambience was amazing. We order half-plates of both the gravies. Food was quite a lot for two people to eat.
I'm surely going back for another "feast".

This small joint just besides the wise owl cafe is one gem of a north indian restaurant. The space is an issue but the foods are to die for. The quantity, quality is too good and that too with dirt cheap pocket pinch. Three of us went there yesterday and it costed us 971 including taxes and we were gasping for our breath as we were full to our teeth. Definitely recomdable and must try. Only issue is the place is too small . It just accomodates around20 people although they have opened a branch near lake gardens with larger acoomodation. A must try.

​Nouvelle Cuisine!

As everything around us is evolving day by day, therefore, it's just a normal aspiration for food as well. Thus, chose The Feast Street to fulfill our current hunger. 

And indeed this place is so modern. Loaded with young flocks and even decorated with current imaginative scribbles. Nevertheless as we were famished, so ordered quick for Kasoori Murgh Malai Tikka as starter, which was indeed a mouth watering dish by looks and its taste. And for main course our choice were: Gosht Bhuna, Keema Polao with Masala Cold Drink. Meat was sapid, Polao was a real delish and about that drink, I would say it was so real. I have tasted many places this same drink but none had so real taste like this. Just loved it. 

Although stewards were bit slow, and the reasons behind that were the full House of it and the occasion we're celebrating now.

Nonetheless, food, ambience, behavior and service were just stunning. Go for it guys. It's pocket friendly and a absolute stunning place to feast.

A small place just beside Wise owl. Only a few tables but the decor is nice with graffitis. Food is the main highlight of this place. Loved each and every item. Lasooni kesari malai tikka, bhuna mutton and biryani were fabulous. Laccha paratha was soft and went very well with the bhuna. Rumali roti could have been better it was not soft. The masala cold drinks is refreshing. The burhani served with biryani compliments very well. Pricing is very reasonable and also half portions available is a big Plus. Service was good enough. Will go again to try their Butter chicken.

I went here along with my friend . Loved the amazing doodles in the interior. We ordered bharwan tangri... Which was a kabab sort with a unique filling inside. Innovative kind. For main course we ordered biryani (that's usually what I do when I can't choose between too many options 😜) and murgh tikka masala. Tikka masala was amazing. Quality and quantity of food is satisfactory. Biryani could be improved.
PS- I was too hungry to click a pic that day 😭

This is a newly opened foodies joint in Kolkata. Situated just beside wise owl, the location is easily accessible and locatable.

The outlet is small , really small and not good enough for dining in.. honestly after seeing the reviews and photos i thought it would be a bit bigger.

Coming to the interiors, each wall is painted with different images with people cooking food..They were hand painted which really looked nice and unique. 

Now coming to the food.. we ordered tandoori chicken half plate. Having seen all the pictures from zomato.. we knew it would arrive like a sizzler and it did😁 . The chicken was perfectly cooked with the spices , juicy(not dry), had smoky flavour. It did came in the sizzler plate with salads and chutney. 

Next we ordered 2 full plate mutton biriyani. 
And never imagined that the quantity would be that great. Tasted good too. Mutton was delicious, soft, perfectly cooked. We were 2 people but we ate 1 plate of biriyani and had to pack the rest. There is also a special biriyani option for 2people and i guess that would have been great for us too. 

Better than any other joint. Pricing is super affordable. Being newly opened they take care of their customers which was a plus for us as they suggested best dishes at their joint and helped us choose our dishes. 

In this market where  GST is making things expensive.. this outlet is not yet charging any GST as of now.. 😃😃😃

Will definitely visit again to try other dishes available.

Was in the mood for North Indian food and wanted to try something new.

This restaurant came up with a 4.5 star rating, so decided to order.

I had ordered
1) Sigree Paneer Tikka 
2) The Feast Street Dak Bukhara
3) Rumali Rotu.(I'm a big fan of Rumali roti)

Food arrived on time. Earlier than the estimate on the app. And it arrived hot. So that's a thumbs up. 

Packaging was good.

To start with Paneer Tikka. It was fresh. And served with the green chutney and onions. So a big thumbs up on that.

But sadly. That was it.

The dal was below par but okay. I wouldn't order it again.and the "not so Rumali" roti was a pain to eat. It was not at all rumani. It was just a giant roti. If I compare it with Jai Hind Dhaba. The Rumali roti was 5 times thicker that theirs. I can easily eat 3 Rumali roti at Jai Hind. But here even one was hardly going down the throat. So just remove it from the menu.

So. It wasn't. A good evening for me. I should have stuck to Jai Hind Dhaba.

This outlet of The Feast Street which is the original one is located in the Hindusthan Park area and boasts of a very nice and beautiful decor. The staff are very courteous and helpful. The place is a bit small and boasts of a single six people table, a couple of four people tables and a couple of two people tables. The kitchen of the place is also small which is why food may take some time if the place is full. We ordered Murgh Malai Tikka Masala and Lucknowi Paratha. The Murgh Malai Tikka Masala tasted delightful and was wonderfully prepared. The Lucknowi Paratha is a value-for dish item as the pieces were quite large and would suffice a couple of people easily. To finish off the wonderful food, the staff handed us a couple of 10% discount vouchers of the new opened outlet at Lake Gardens. Incredible hospitality and great food!

Well, I obviously will not coil up much with my explanations regarding the food. So lets start with  the experience directly.(forgive for the scattered nature of the photos).
We started with the Murg Surgh Angar, which was itself awesome. A bit on the dry side, yet had the hint of a juicy-sense ; a tandoor dish to be precise.
Next was the Delhi Fried Tangri. The pieces were huge, the chat masala flavour of the chutney also appeared unique to me. Though two or three were undercooked😩😩😩.
The laccha roti was also quite good and was procured with a butter-layer to add some taste to it.
Then was the delhi style butter chicken, which was really wonderful and some unique flavours hit my taste buds everytime I had it with my piece of roti. "Recommended"
Finally it was the time of Bhuna Mutton, which I virtually pounced upon, after I tested it for the first time. Just the right combination of flavours in the right proportions. "Highly recommended" (for mutton lovers)
So, to sum up, good small place, with limited seats (12-15 at a time). Not a place for enjoying privacy. Good for a small- group hangout. Dish-diameter seemed essentially small. Specially small for people to have biryani-dishes. Had one starter more to our retaining-ability though 😄😄😊. You will also have a gift coupon of 10% off for your visit to the lake gardens outlet😀😀.
Thanks for the right guidance( madam😊😁)

This restaurant has already generated a lot of buzz in the market.
They serve very delicious and aromatic mughlai dishes.  It's worth the hype. 
✓Bharwan Tangree is delicate and tasty chunk of leg piece. It is spicy and lends that smoky flavour.
✓Afghani Chicken Tandoori is good. Chicken is marinated with different herbs and spices in bulk. pieces are normal sized. 
✓ Chicken Begum Bahar - tender pieces of chicken in a creamy, spice-infused orange gravy. It has a very distinct flavour. *Must try
✓Gosht Biryani deserves a special mention. It's amazing. The flavour will fill your heart and the huge quantity will definitely fill your stomach. Mutton is very well cooked. You get complimentary burhani with it. *SlowClaps*

Overall experience is definitely good. They are struggling to accommodate such a huge rush because of the space crunch though. The only weak point that I found is the serving time. We became restless because of the slow pace, scenario changed after the food was served! 😂

I went to this restaurant for the first time after witnessing all the buzz in zomato. The restaurant, located close to gariahat 4-point crossing is pretty accessible. The ambiance was nice, probably not the best, yet there's much to complain about since there isn't much room there. Overall the seating felt quite compact. For the food, I ordered half a plate of chicken biriyani, along with two tandoori rotis and a plate of chicken kosha. The order arrived a bit delayed, and was good, yet not very good. The biriyani felt a bit undercooked, but the koasha and tandoori roti were pretty good, indeed. The reason I opted for a budget meal was that I wanted to see that whether the restaurant really was budget friendly. And indeed it was. The half plate of biriyani was quite fulfilling and the chicken kosha, at that price was quite ample. They even served bhurani, complementary to the biriyani. One could easily be contended by a meal of ₹250, easily. The service was really nice as well. There's no complain about it. Overall a good restaurant foe tight budgets, quick meals, and for small hangouts as well.

The perfect example of Value for Money. We tried 2 types of kababs, Afghan Tengri is worth mentioning. The chicken was very tender and juicy. Then we had Mutton Biryani, which came with a big potato and a chunky piece of mutton. The biryani was also good. As a side dish, we took Delhi ka Butter Chicken, which was awesome. Drawbacks: the place is congested and the firni could have been better, but overall it is very good and worth visiting again.

It's a small new restro near Hindustan park. Located just beside The Wise Owl. Been there couple of times. Mutton bhuna khichri is a must try and their Biriyani & Delhi style butter chicken. Only on suggestion the plate you're providing for biriyani is too small. Hard to accommodate all the items in a single plate. Best of luck young entrepreneurs. 👍
P.S. Don't stop providing that small glass of butter milk along with biriyani. It's amazing.

This new hole in the wall joint next to wise owl is a great find . Did it live up to its Zomato rating and the surrounding hype ? It's actually too early to say . Let's start with what we ordered in through swiggy last night -tandoori chicken good and traditional no twist here. Mutton degh biriyani which is really good. One portion with two pieces of mutton , 2 potatoes and egg is enough for 2 diners. Love how it came packed with the rise and the accompaniments in separate boxes. The mutton was really soft too. Comes with its own burrani and biriyani +burrani =👌
The bhuna mutton is a speciality here and understandably so. It packs a punch of flavour though the mutton was chewy. Ordered 2 plates =4 pudina rumali rotis and apart from it being green the change in the taste was too subtle for my human palette to decipher. So no go here . Also received only two instead of 4 which was bothersome. Swiggy was quick to refund which is good service on their part.
However it took 1.5 hours to actually receive the food that is excluding the swiggy travel time. I am guessing new restaurant , lot of hype, good food and fast service just doesn't go together. Maybe expanding the kitchen to handle the footfall might help till then wait or wait it out.

অনেক প্রত্যাশা  ছিল।

কিন্তু সিংহের  মূষিক প্রসব।

দোকানের পরিসর  কম। দেওয়াল জুড়ে নানা চিত্র ।  চা- 
ওয়ালা, ভেলপুরি ওয়ালা.. নানারকমের ছবি। 

১৫-২০ জনের বসার জায়গা।

রান্নাঘরে ঠাসাঠাসি  করে ৮- ৯ জন কাজ করছে।


 প্রথমত  দোকানে ঢোকার আগে ৩০ মিনিট দাঁড়ানো।

তারপর খাবার অর্ডার   দেবার পর আর ও ১ ঘণ্টা  অন্তহীন 

অপেক্ষা।

খাবারের তালিকায় ছিল- ক্রিমি আফগানি চিকেন,  আলু 

সুগন্ধি,  লচ্চা পরোটা, লচ্চা রুটি, তাওয়া ফিস, মুর্গ দেগ 

বিরিয়ানি, দিল্লি স্টাইল বাটার চিকেন।

ক্রিমি আফগানি চিকেন (৪.৫/৫) - ম্যারিনেট করা চিকেন এর 

নরম গা বেয়ে ক্রিমের আস্তরন। ৪ পিস বেশ বড় বড় চিকেন। 

ঘন ক্রিম আর সুসিদ্ধ  চিকেন একসাথে মিশে বেশ এক অদ্ভুত

  মুগ্ধতা  সৃষ্টি করেছে। 

আলু সুগন্ধি (৪.৫/৫) - আলুর বুক থেকে অতিরিক্ত স্নেহজাত 

পদার্থ  বের করে নারকেল ও নানা মশলার পুর দেওয়া।

আলুর বাইরের অংশটা মুচমুচে..  কিন্ত ভেতরে হালকা টক।

স্বাদের তারতম্য মনে তৃপ্তি  আনে।

লচ্চা পরোটা (৫/৫)- 

" তুমি না থাকলে খাবারটা এত মিষ্টি  হত না..

তুমি না থাকলে মেঘ করে যেত.. বৃষ্টি  হত না"

কি দারুন খেতে।  সাদা ধবধবে মেঘের মত বিন্যাস ।  মন 

ভরিয়ে দেয়। খেলে আবেশে চোখ  বুজে আসে। এত ভাল 

লাচ্চা পরোটা খাবার সৌভাগ্য  হয়নি।

লাচ্চা রুটি (৩.৫/৫)- লচ্চা পরোটার স্বাদ নিতে চান অথচ 

তেলে অনীহা,  তবে এটা টেস্ট করতে পারেন। 

দিল্লি  স্টাইল বাটার চিকেন (৩/৫) - চিকেন ভাল ছিল। কিন্ত 

টমেটো পচা। স্বাদের সেই জাদুমন্ত্র  হারিয়ে গেছে। একদম 

হতাশ।

তাওয়া ফিশ (৩/৫) - বাটার চিকেনের গ্রেভি এখানেও ব্যবহার 

করা হয়েছে। মাছের অংশ ফ্রেস হলেও স্বাদের জন্য "লুচিহীন 

অষ্টমী   হয়ে গেছে পুরো ব্যাপারটা।

মুর্গ  দেগ বিরিয়ানি (২/৫)- ভারি ধরনের। বেশ তেলের পরিমাণ

  বেশি। বিরিয়ানির সেই স্বাদ আর গন্ধ  কোথায়??।

একদম ডাহা ফেল।

শেষ পাতের ফিরনি  আর রাবড়ি বেশ ভাল।

সমস্যা - হোম ডেলিভারি নেওয়া গ্রাহকদের নিয়ে বেশি ব্যস্ত।

সমস্ত ব্যাপারটার মধ্যেই একটা খাপছাড়া  ভাব।

ভেবেছিলাম একটা কবিতা লিখব। কিন্তু ছন্দ  এল না। খাবারে 

পেট ভরল কিন্ত মন ভরল না।

The only thing I didn't like about this place was that it's a little too small to accommodate the crowd. Everything else is great about the feast street! :)
We ordered the lasooni Kesar malai tikka! It tasted amazing! ❤❤
Then we opted for Delhi style butter chicken with lachha paratha. Loved every bite of it. The paratha wasn't too oily but perfectly crispy. The butter chicken is a must try!
Easy on the pocket, this restaurant is worth multiple visits.
P.S. Loved the grafitti on the wall!

This had been in my bucket list since a long time. Accidentally happened to visit it today. Ordered their famous gosht deg mutton biryani. It was light but tasty! The only complaint I have is that mutton piece was hard to chew. Murgh malai tikka masala was fabulous! Even after finishing the biryani, I was having the gravy of murgh malai :D ... Tandoori roti was normal.. They gave a complimentary burhani , which was good.
Ambience is quirky! Service is fast! The best part about this eatery is their pocket friendly prices!

Gone are those days when Biriyani only meant a few handful places in Kolkata. This new kid in the block is damn good with everything they serve. A Saturday lunch at work is always something I look forward to and today we decided to order from Feast Street. It was Mutton Biriyani, Paneer Kulcha and Dal Tadka that we ordered for delivery. Each and every dish was served hot and fresh. The Biriyani is a must try- the mutton was so soft that it almost melted in your mouth, the rice was cooked to perfection and at the same time it was light on the stomach. The kulcha was tender even after quite a while and the Dal too impressed us. We relished the food to the last morsel even risking over-eating. I would highly recommend this place to all Biriyani and North Indian food friends. Eat Repeat and you would never repent!!!

With 4.5 rating this joint is becoming very popular among food lovers of kolkata. After hearing so much about this restaurant I decided to try it out myself. And, well, the experience was mixed. 

We ordered the non-veg kabab platter, lehsuni naan, Lucknowy paratha, mutton rogan josh, murg hundi korma. My review is based upon only these dishes. 

Kabab platter was good. Both chicken kabab was juicy tender and very flavorful, fish kabab was also good, mutton kabab was ordinary.

I liked the hundi korma, it was rich and flavorful and quite calorically dense. The portion size was also quite big.

The Lucknowy paratha is nothing but glorified lachha paratha. The star of all dishes was the garlic naan. It was perfect.

Now the disappointing parts....... The mutton rogan josh...... Mutton was tough and very gamey to my tastebuds. And the gravy wasn't as great as i hoped to be. And the servise was slow. We had to ask for water every time the glasses were empty.....which was annoying. 
I've heard they serve very good biriany. May be next time I will try that....and update my review.🙂

So the people who have an extra heart for North Indian food like me, must visit this place. 👍 a cozy & funky please to to call your group n enjoy the lovely dishes, or just a cool place to go on a date with your foodie bae! It's locate on purnadas road just beside the wise owl cafe. I went there with my group on my birthday and it was totally worthy...food was amazing, we have ordered tandoori chicken, chicken cheese kebab (must try), malai chicken in gravy, butter chicken in delhi style, mutton shikandari and butter naan. But one thing I personally disliked about this place was the guy who was taking orders, was bit confused about the menu so we had to talk more than 2 people to confirm our order and then that same guy I don't know what was the hurry but he kept asking us whether to serve the main course or not, when we aren't done with our starters yet, except this rest of the people were nice and welcoming, and I loved the thing that the owner she herself came to our table and wished me as it was my birthday, lovely place definitely recommend 😊

Damn good restaurant with damn good food and very friendly staff. One of the best bhindi masala I have ever eaten there and the phulka was of top notch. My recommendation is before eating any food smell it. The smell alone transfers you to another world. AND All this at a very cheap price. Keep up the good work.

Isn't this place a bit overrated?

Went to gulp some kebabs in the evening and here goes my experience:

Situated right beside the Wise Owl in purna das road, this place is way too small. No need to eavesdrop,; every conversation in all the other tables will be loud and clear. You can even nudge them with your elbows. Oh! I forgot to mention. The place has a sliding door, and one will require quite an effort to slide it and enter.

Asked the waiter about the kebabs that will be seeved in the platter. The answer was Chef's Special. What do the Chef generally includes. The Chef decides it as per his/her wish. We were suggested to go for individual kebab plates.

1. Lassoni Kesar Malai Murg Kebab- BLAND. NO SALT IN THE INSIDE. 4 pieces.
2. Mahi e Gulfam (Bhetki) - Salt on the higher side, but was not bad. 3 pieces
3. Mutton Tunday n Sheekh - NOT AVAILABLE
4. Mutton Boti Kebab - My jaws are still paining. Had to literally chew it like a gum and gulp it. Probably had been kept cooked a long time ago. My friend could not eat it. 4 Difficult pieces.
5. Sweet Lime Soda - NOT BAD.
6. Firni - GOOD Probably the best among all of the above. Though the best, according to me is served at India Restaurant.

BILL - 937/-

This particular food spot was on my bucket list for a long time. Had the chance to have lunch there a few days back. I must say I was a bit sceptical when I had entered the place. It had very limited seating arrangement and was actually clumsy. The staff was very friendly and very helpful. Although they took a considerable amount of time to serve us our food the food quality, quantity and taste overshadowed it.
Now coming to the food we had:

1. GOSHT DEG BIRIYANI: It was one of the tastiest biriyani dishes made in Kolkata. The preparation was unlike the other convention biriyanis made in various restaurants. The mutton piece was big enough and the quantity of the rice was more than sufficient. It was served fresh and hot and had an amazing smell to it. Also they had served a complimentary "ghol" with the biriyani.

2. MURGH MIRCH MASALA: Yet another chicken preparation that left us licking our fingers and wanting for more. The chicken was cooked to perfection and it was so soft and juicy from within.

3. KEBAB PLATTER: It consisted of two items of chicken kebabs (2 pcs), one item of mutton kebab (2 pcs) and another fish kebab (2 pcs). It was served with complimentary onion and lemon salad and green chutney. I loved their chicken reshmi kebab within the platter. It was indeed very tasty. The other chicken kebab was a bit too spicy but tasted pretty well. The mutton kebab was a disappointment though. It wasn't prepared well and was hard and will not satisfy your taste buds for sure. The fish kebab was soft and very tasty.

4. BUTTER CHICKEN DELHI STYLE: Once again they were successful in their attempts of breaking the conventional way of making butter chicken and could well satisfy their customers. An uncommon way of cooking an ordinary dish resulted in its extraordinary lip-smacking taste. A must try for everyone visiting this place for the first time.

5. PHIRNI: They did claim this special item in their dessert menu to be sugarfree. Well I am a big fan of phirnis and whenever I am to choose a dessert in dhabas or north indian restaurants I generally try to go for phirnis or shahi tukdas. This is the best phirni I have ever tasted. Unlike the hard texture of the phirnis found at various restaurants like Aminia, this was soft and smooth with no weird lumps at all.
6. BUTTER CHANGEZI: My recent visit to this place has helped me discover this absolutely lip-smacking dish. Also a very tasty butter chicken recipe which will go extremely well with kulchas and naans. The smooth texture of this dish will leave you craving for more. So yes I will actually recommend this over the Delhi style butter chicken.
7. MUTTON ROGAN JOSH: Well rogan josh is itself a very spicy and oily dish and kind of scares me every time. They made the dish well enough but not a recommended food item of theirs. Try to avoid this dish as it is not one of their best at all.
We took additional butter naan, cheese Kulcha and green salad as addons.Refer to my account for the pictures.

Pros- Foods are so tasteful, all the kababs are sizzlers, quantities are more than you expect, decoration is medium and the best part is every dishes are reasonable.
Cons- This place is so small and seats are few, so remain congested in weekends and holidays.

After hopping for a while and searching a place to satisfy our hunger in the lanes of hindustan park..  me n my friend, we ended up at the feast street which is located just beside the wise owl. A small and a cozy place with not more than 25 covers , the place seemed to be beautifully decorared with frames and paintings all around their wall.. we were given the menu and it mostly had the indian dishes on their menu with a lot of cpmbo offers too.. aftrer a discussion we ordered for a egg masala wrap which i specified to be with the extra chillies.. by the time we were just looking at the condiments placed on the table and we found the jars to become rusty.. its for them to change it i guess.. by the time the order came with a spicy mayo on the side. We thought it would have an omelete kind of stuff as a filling but it had boiled eggs to which we were a bit disappointed Nd moreover it didnt had any extra chillies too.. the taste didnt alter much though.. wrap was soft and hot too.. we wanted to try the sugar free phirni as well but unfortunately they didnt had it that day.. 
Hope, next time we get a chance to try it out..
Definately a recommendation for a foodie lover...
Cheers.. 💟😊

Their food lacks consistency.order a dish one day and the same item would taste different the next time if u repeat...they are doing roaring business but their staff is not equipped to manage the rush and neither is the management  interested to address issues reported by their patrons.simply go through their menu and ask the attending person about the dish,i guarantee the half hearted reply with their care a damn attitude will piss off  anyone...for them it's just loosing one client as there are many more waiting to try their food courtesy high ratings on zomato... Ironically,people are ready to compromise on food quality and service standards as long as its reasonable which unfortunately smacks off the local culture of the state..

The restaurant was beautiful, small but tidy. Ambience was joyful. Staffs wear courteous. 
The food... Well, we ordered a tandoori roti, a Rumali roti , a 6 pc chicken kadhai and a plate of green salad.
Although the rotis were a bit dry...
But the chicken was truly...LAZEEZ. I liked it very much. DELICIOUS.
And the green salad was fresh and sufficient.
So altogether it was a good experience dining there...
Looking forward to go again to try rice item with other side dishes...
Keep it up...All the best. 😃💙👍

The place is located right beside Wise Owl and opposite to Azad Hind Dhaba, Hindustan Park. Since they have a seating arrangement for only about 20 people and all the seats were occupied, we were asked to wait for half an hour. But it took 50 mins to get a table. Their service is very slow and we had to wait for 40 minutes more to get our ordered dishes on table. The place is nicely decked up with simple yet cute decorations. But the small place may seem claustrophobic at times.

We ordered Murgh Surgh Angar, Gosht Deg Biryani and Afghani Chicken. The starter i.e. Murgh Surgh Angar was marvellously delicious. The Special Gosht Biryani was yummy too. It had two pieces of mutton, two pieces of potato and an egg. But the mutton wasn't cooked well and was not at all soft. I literally had a very tough time having it. The side dish i.e. Afghani Chicken was extremely tasty and the gravy was just yummy. At the end of our meal, the lady who owns the restaurant, came to us to know our feedback. She and her staffs are all quite nice and courteous.

P.S. They have huge take-away/home delivery orders and that's why they tend to ignore/delay with their customers present in the restaurant for dine-in. Do not opt for this place if you're in a hurry. But to taste fine Mughlai dishes at a reasonable price, do visit them. 

Pocket pinch: 600 for two (approx.) (Excluding GST)

Went there in afternoon for lunch with friends. They made us sit on a corner table, which was very small for 3 people. Though we ordered our food right after we sat, still the waiter was coming and asking whether we've ordered or not. There was no coordination among them. Our starter arrived after 20 minutes may be, or more. It was pretty late. Then our main course came , consisting of biryani and a cheese kulcha. Kulcha was more of nan than kulcha, with no basic taste of cheese. They didn't know we had ordered a gravy as well. We had to remind them of that. And by the time our gravy came, kulcha got hardened. The chicken in the biryani was very dry, and tasteless. Though the aloo was good. Also, they have charged GST. Total bill came to Rs. 903. Way too much for the amount and quality. 
Not very happy with the experience.

Had heard a lot about it.
Decor wise it's amazing!! A tiny eatery with vibrant colors!! The Graphiti wall looks amazing.

The menu is so minimally priced. Budget friendly.
We tried the masala egg wrap.
We did ask for it to be extra spicy which wasn't taken into consideration. Leaving that aside, the wrap was tasty. Very fresh and filling! I wanted to try the phirni which was supposedly sugar free but they ddnt have it!!

Hoping to be able to taste it the next time I visit!

I went there with a friend of mine for lunch..
But we have to wait outside for around 10-15 mins..
But it ws worth it..
Staffs were friendly..
Food were awesome..
We ordered chicken doner kebab roll with mayo &  totally loved it..
Murgh surgh angar was ok
But creamy butter tandoori chicken was finger licking good.. thus I ordered creamy afghani chicken too..
They recommended us to have them with rumali roti..
Only drawback was there were no desserts except firni.. I'm expecting that next time  they gonna serve us desserts too..
Worth visiting this place.. I'll b back soon..!! ☺

Went to visit the much talked about The Feast Street two days back post some rigorous shopping session. Located just beside The Wise Owl coffee shop, this place provides some serious good food without burning any hole in your pocket (win-win). Whenever i passed by this restaurant, i would notice how it is always full and that day wasn't an exception. We were asked to wait for 20 minutes but it was worth it. We ordered Paneer Kulcha, Cheese Kulcha, Butter Chicken Delhi Style and Mutton Biryani. There was complementary Burhani with each plate of Mutton Biryani. The quantity of food was overwhelming. Taste wise, it was very good.I personally loved the Paneer Kulcha. The best i've had in fact. The Burhani really suited me. Loved that. We had also ordered Masala Cold Drinks and Fresh Lime Soda which were equally good. The staff were really cooperative. The ambience of the place is remarkable.All in all, The Feast Street is a hit.

menu - 1 Special Murgh Deg Biryani & 1 Plain Raita

review;
Special Murgh Deg Biryani Contains chicken (2 pcs), aloo (2 pcs), egg (1 pc). okish! nothing out of the box! ps the biryani is dry so a side dish is must! PS we also got peyaj lebu and lonka but the peyaj was smelling :/ also we didn't got the free drink when asked they replied that they have stopped it!
Plain Raita was too thick!

the packaging was awesome! .5 for that!

in total it was an average experience!

I visited The Feast Street on 9th Sept 2017. I tried their Mutton Biryani and Mutton Bhuna.The portions are really large.The Mutton Biriyani was exellent and the bhuna was the best I had in long time.The biryani is the best in town and the mutton was very succulent.The Feast Street is no doubt a feather in the cap for the food lovers of Kolkata!

Went there with high expectations.A very small joint with too much congestion.we ordered delhi style butter chicken,murgh malai tikka butter masala and butter tandoori roti.Both the side dishes were tasty but that was not tandoori roti at all,that was a normal roti with butter on it. Very slow service but the quantity was good.

P.S-They started to take the GST from monday,so all the prices are excluding taxes.

Well this place has been on my list for quite some time now...went there today for lunch with my bro and was overwhelmed.we did hv to wait for around 15 mins.but the wait was worth it.the place has limited seating capacity.For starters we had murgh surgh angar.the kebabs were awsome..perfectly cooked and the mix of spices diiferent from other kebabs we do hv usually like the tikka or reshmi.nxt up was the Delhi style butter chicken..this delicacy has always been my all time favourite and out here keeping upto my expectations the butter chicken tasted marvellous.we had lachha paratha lucknow style and lachha roti to have with the butter chicken.Both were crisp and good.i havent had lachha roti before this.anyways the staff is courteous..the service right on time..and it was really a nice and well appreciated gesture from the lady, i guess who runs this place, to go to each table at the end of meal and ask for their opinion.The experience has been satisfying..i definitely recommend this place to all those who havent been here..To the team of THE FEAST STREET..Do keep up the good stuff u r cooking and spreading happiness.

It is situated just beside wise owl near Hindustan park. We requested for donar kebab roll and malai kalmi kebab. But both of them were unavailable at that time. Instead we had lasoni Kesar Malai kebab and chicken tikka wrap in roomali roti. Good food at very much pocket friendly prices. Service is good and it has a foodie ambiance.
They have wide range of food from kebabs, biriyani,Lebanese,papad,mains, rotis, desserts and more. This one is perfect for student hangouts.

We visited this place a few days back. The place is small but the decor is nice. The food was delicious. We had ordered Lasooni Kesar Malai Tikka for starters. The Kebabs were soft and juicy. Then we ordered Gosht Deg Biriyani and Murgh Malai Tikka Masala. Both were yumm. The mutton was soft and the Biriyani was just perfect. They also serve complimentary Burhani with the Biriyani,which was nice. The service is a bit slow. But the prices are really cheap and they also don't any taxes. Overall the experience was good and we will surely revisit this place any time soon.

Went for a early evening munch on a weekday.It can be easily located which is good. Its just opp. To azad hind dhaba of hindustan park and beside Wise owl.

Ambiance: You can't expect much in term of ambiance out of this tiny restaurant which i think should have only one purpose of serving quick and delicious food. It can accomodate approx 20 persons max.

Food: we ordered kebab platter consisting of 2 types of chicken kebabs (4pcs) , 1 type mutton (2pcs) & 1 type fish (2pcs). The taste was nothing extraordinary and also the spice and salt was on lower side. Also, quanity wise the pcs served was very small.Not at all value for money. We also ordered burhani which is butter milk kind of a drink which was refreshing and nice also masala cold drinks which was kind of okay. 

Service: Service is what I thought which was a let down big time. It took them more than 1hr 10mins to bring kebab platter for us. We thought of leaving the place but since their nature was humble we kept ourselves grounded somehow. On giving feedback the service is very slow they tried defending that we prepare kebabs once we get the order not from before. That's a lame excuse knowing thats not a restaurant fumctions. Reality was they had bulk delivery ordered which was pending. And that complaints were raised from other tables too..

Verdict: cheap but not among the best and also not recommended when you are in hurry.

Well, heard of this place from a friend &  decided to visit here surely in the shopping spree for this season. So,  after office.. Gariahat shopping &  @10pm hungry we (me & hubby) visited this place today. It's a small & cozy  arrangement with interesting drawing in the wall. Coming to the food..  Heard of their biriyani.. So ordered half mutton biriyani, rumali roti, mutton rogan josh,  firni & rabri. Mutton in both was perfectly cooked & tender.  Even the half plate of biriyani was a lot! Desert items met the expectation.  True value for money as price includes GST.. Huh!! And Yea.. The lady in the shop came to ask how was the Food & if we were Enjoying.. Lovely gesture!

What a feast it was! Thanks a ton "The Feast Street" for serving the hungry souls with the delicious food! I went there with my friends post our last university examination.....all of us tired and hungry....and trust me the moment we took the first spoonful of the biriyani we just melted like butter on a hot pan!We ordered half plates of mutton and chicken biriyani and half chicken reshmi butter masala.(yes.half plate it is when you are low on cash and just about to enter a world of joblessness).But wait!when we saw the quantity and tasted the quality....we promptly decided....to give a second visit....as we had also scanned down the other people around us having wraps and sizzling kebabs(they serve kebabs on hot plates) which looked equally yum.Coming to the quality of food ,the mutton they served was too tender and well seasoned and the biriyani tasted perfect.The reshmi kebab was dunked in this super thick and delicious gravy that perfectly blended with the biriyani.And just when u think u need something to drink too.....we were served with complimentary burhani which simply made us feel so light on stomach and the taste was out of this world.And there was complimentary onion salad too.Our bill came to Rs 819 INR which was just right.
We simply could not thank the manager enough.I have tracked them down from the huge number of birthday parties that are celebrated here and posted on facebook.And yes even yesterday someone celebrated hers while we were present! One can easily guess the food served here is GOOD cause people are storming in to celebrate the most special day of their lives!
My experience was so satisfying that it prompted me to write a review after ages!
Keep the good food coming guys!

I went there today with my friend after seeing this great 4.7/5.0 rating here, it's like 15 or more kilometers away from my place still! For my welcome there was a 1 hour 20 mins waiting (no issues) and a horrific smell which was unbearable! Talking about food well I ordered Pomfret tandoori and one special chicken Biryani (with extra mutton)
Pomfret tandoori was not bad! SPECIAL Biryani was not at all special it was probably the worst Biryani I ever had, I wana ask you people what do we want in a briyani? Nice flavor ? A well cooked flavor full piece of chicken/mutton? Aloo and egg is more or less the same everywhere! Here rice was just flat I repeat FLAT no flavor what so ever, and talking chicken and mutton because I had both mutton was very small like it had nothing but whatever it had it was better than chicken, if you ever crave for a chew gum? Go have chicken here the Biryani one specially, I had to throw chicken first time in my life! Biryani chorna parr gaya yaar aur kya bolu?
There was a cute girl in the reception tho 4.7 for her hmmm nah I'll pass.

This was the second time I visited The feast treat. For the 1st tym we ordered chicken Lasooni Kesar Malai Tikka, Mahi-e-gulfan . It was too good. The chicken was succulent and yumm. There presentation is also gery nice. For the mains we ordered laccha paratha and mutton bhuna. This was the best laccha I ever had the mutton bhuna was was very nice. The only con of thus joint is it is too small and it can hardly accommodate 20 people and we have to wait for 45mins even on weekdays. Service was quite slow we had to wait for 30mins for the kebabs. But their food is quite worth waiting.

Visited this place for friend's farewell. Kebabs were good. Quantity was satisfactory. Service were prompt. They have a nice graphic printed wall. But the draw back of this eatery is their space. The number of tables are more compared to the total area. So it feels bit clumsy.

Food was delicious.. we ordered chicken tandoori which was yummm,chicken was soft and tender and the chutney that was served was one of the best that I had after many days. Ordered special mutton biriyani for main course which was both tasty and healthy and was enough for too people of normal appetite. Wish to visit you again #THE FEAST STREET

I ordered for home delivery based on the hyp on Zomato. I had very high hopes regarding the place as it is very near to my home. The egg tarka I ordered didnt seem to be fresh as it had a was stone cold in the middle of the container as if it was heated up just before sending. Although to be honest when I heated it up again as I hate cold food it tasted fine. The tandoori roti was crap. Had to throw that away. The roomali roti was under cooked. Had to throw that away too. Went out to get tawa roti at 11 PM at night. Last was the chicken chap. Since the order was through Zomato using my mother's account I chose the boneless one. Which to my surprise came with a bone. Although they made an adjustment to bill, but that is not the point. They should have informed me before changing my order. The gravy of the chap tasted fine but the chicken  piece was again a let down. It was stone cold in the middle and had blood. I dont understand how difficult it is to deliver hot food when the time it takes to deliver is less than 5 mins.

May be my experience would have been better if this was a dine in as per the "Ratings". But home delivery was an absolute disgust.

Hope the management listens to this and make every ordeer whether is dine-in or delivery a pleasant experience, atleast for your local customers. Also it seems that I am not the only bloke to complain about the delivery. Please look into this as what ever we ordered was almost wasted. 

Even a simple recipe like the egg tarka was a disaster. Please get a hold of your staff or the delivery.

Finally made it there today. After having foodgasms while reading those lovely reviews about this place coudnt wait any longer. The place is very easy to find. Just take the lane opposite to hatari and den the second left takes you there. Thankfully we dint have to wait. The reataurant was absolutely full.
Nice simple ambience. Place for college and school goers. 
The reason they have been trending all this while is because of their food. So coming to that heres what i had :-
LASOONI KESAR MALAI TIKKA - the pieces of chicken were so well cooked...soft tender juicy...only a bit lacking was the flavour...there was a mild flavour of kesar but lasoon was nowhere to be found...it had a dominating bt wonderful smoky flavour

AFGHANI TANGRI- again lovely cooked chicken legs...had a greast smoky flavour...very soft and tender and very similar to the above tikka 
All kebabs come as sizzlers

MASALA COLD DRINK- just like the normal masala colf drink available anywhere...nothing special here

DELHI STYLE BUTTER CHICKEN- they serve with bone pieces of chicken but the dish is heavenly...right from those large,soft and fleshy pieces of chicken to the beatiful gravy. This is a winner.

MASALA KULCHA AND BUTTER NAAN- both were very soft and slight crispy,had ample amount of butter on them and were a beatiful compliment to the butter chicken
Wanted to try their shahi tukda after hearing so much about it but it wasnt available

Now the SERVICE...this is one place where they have to put in a lot of effort...theres just one guy kept in servicing who does some help in cooking also...and so during rush hours the dishes come quite late and they even forgot one of my orders for which i had to ask them 3-4times after which it appeared. The owner however was very polite and enquired about how the food was.

The big SURPRISE though came in the bill. I had read in maximum of their reviews,and even in a review i saw yesterday,that they dont charge  GST and their menu also mentions that all prices are INCLUSIVE OF TAXES. However it is NOT so now. I dont know if it has suddenly been changed today i dint enquire. A GST of 18% was charged on my bill. So they are NO LONGER TAX FREE. 

Leaving that aside the prices are still very reasonable. But they do need to work on their servicing. Will surely visit again with high hopes.

Situated in a serene neighborhood, this small outlet is a paradise for foodies. If you have a small budget yet ypur heart desires great food, bingo; this is perfect for you. In the afternoon it's usually crowded and being a small restaurant a little bit of wait is what you have to tolerate. Apart from this it's all yours. We had ordered Lasooni Kesar malai tikka for the starters, it was served with an yummy green chutney and salads. And the taste was something devine. Coming to the main course we had ordered butter chicken (Delhi style), Afghan chicken and a plate of murgh mirch masala. 
And OMG, unimaginably wonderful in taste. The quantity was also too good. Two plates of peas pulao and a plate of zeera pulao and six cheese nuns were enough for us to gulp down to our throats. On the dessert section we had raita and firni. By the time we left, everyone of us was brimming upto the throats with food. And behold all these foods, yet the bill was less than 2000. Surprise isn't it. Yes initially we had it too. 
A special mention the service over there is excellent. Even the manager came up and was curious about our comforts and the quality of the food. We were let out with satisfaction and a big smile from the staffs and a promise to return again pretty soon.
Pros:- excellent food, pocket friendly, excellent service, healthy foods.
Cons:- space is a constraint, lack of a bigger dining area keeps large groups at a bay. Yet a small matter considering such big pros. 
Overall a perfect place to hang out. 
Ambience - 5/5
Location-4/5
Food -5/5
Service-4.5/5
Pocket pinch -4.5/5.

Strongly recommend to visit at least once.

Amazing ambience... Loved the interior of the restaurant... Small place but the food is lip smacking.. we ordered half plate biryanis which was enough for one person.. The quantity of the dishes are satisfying.. if you order biryani with that there is a combo drink basically butter milk which is so refreshing... Then we ordered sizzler kebabs.. if you go to this place and not order kebabs then it's waste going.. so do order kebabs...
This place is cheap nd pocket friendly.. I am sure this is gonna be the new hub for students addah!
So u must try this place coz I am going to visit it again and again..

Whoaaa what a place!!! Just wow foods....
Yes we had to wait for our turn! Yes there is a space constraint!! But worth the wait!
We ordered 
creamy Afghani murgh as starter,
Afghani murgh gravy and tandoori rooti as first round,
Mugh begum bahar and special chicken biriyani with a complementary drink as 2nd round.
Firni as dessert!
I am really confused which one to mark as best one! Coz all of them were superb! But the best of the lot was much Afghani gravy and tandoori roti combo!! Deadly taste! Just fatafati. 

Cherry on the top was sooo decent behaviour of the waiters and the owner! Sweet gestures and the best behaviour I have ever faced.

Finally!! The much awaited Feast Street. This was my second visit.. the first time i went there a few weeks backs the place was reserved for some birthday party. Anyways in the starters we had Murgh Surgh Angar and Bharwan Tangri. The kebabs were very soft and scrumptious. In the main course we had Gosht Biryani & Delhi style Chicken Butter Masala. Both the items were cooked just right. They also serve complimentary Burhani. The prices are very reasonable and they don't charge GST. The major con of this place is its sitting arrangements. The place can accomodate only around 20 people at a time so we had to wait for around 45 minutes even though we were at number 02 in the waiting list. The service was also quite slow. They took around half an hour to serve the kebabs. Nonetheless it was a pleasant experience and we will definitely revisit this place.

I went there with my friends. The place is very small and sometimes the wait can be very long. Very few seating available. I saw the high rating on zomato and decided to go there. But, I was dissapointed at a few levels. The service was very poor. This place is understaffed. As a result I had to tell them thrice to refill our water and then they went ahead and did so. I also found the behaviour of the authorities a little dissapointed. Now coming to the food, I had very high expectations from here reading the reviews. We had:
1: chicken fried wings( the wings were very good. But the dip they gave along with the wings was not at all going well with the wings. We ended up having the wings with tomato sauce.)(8/10)
2: Rumali Roti ( they served the main course way before we finished our starters. As a result by the time we had the Rumali rotis they had become a little hard)
3:butter chicken Delhi style: the chicken was very good. It had four pieces of chicken, and for its price, it was very good.
4: drogan Josh: this dish was a bit of a dissapointment. It didn't taste very good.
5: firni: the firni was good.
6: Shahi tukda: this sweet dish was also pretty good
All in all, I feel that this place doesnt deserver a 4.6 rating in zomato. It's a little overrated. The only good thing about this place is that it offers food at affordable prices. Other than that, as per the ratings, I was dissapointed both in terms of food and service of the staff.

Had planned to visit this place with my gf as she is utterly fond of north indian cuisine, but due to an unfortunate incident had to jump in all alone at the very last moment.:P
Situated beside wise owl, the interiors are arent so much attractive & the seating is also very less but dont get shoved off by these as the food served here is excellent.
Ordered delhi style tangri chicken in starters, delhi style butter chicken, panner butter masala, masala kulcha and keema pulao.
All these at just Rs 800.
Would you believe?
If not please visit this tiny gem you wouldnt be disappointed, i assure you.
The food was just awesome, loved it!

I don't know how come I didn't know about this awesome place!!! 

After this SUNDAY PUJA SHOPPING RUSH   really wanted a place where I could seat calmly nd could get some warmth, eat some nice refreshing food!! 
Must say this place is fulfilling all of the demands. 

That man standing always there with a smiling face and asking everyone whether the food is good or not, are u comfortable or not.. reminds me of my home where my brothers or parents ask our guests just lyk in the similar way.... 

Now the food! 
The presentation + the taste +the warmth of the environment = made it more than just perfect! 

It's my only request to them to extend their area so that many people can have the chance to experience the awesomeness! 

Highly recommended!

From where should I start?
Let's start with the food first :')....
Kebabs were fabulous and so was the presentation :')
Stuffed kucha were one of the best by far I have tasted :')
Now comes the Biriyani... The taste may improve a bit but the quantity was more than enough for two :')...
Now the side dishes.. Wanted to taste all but was already full with others.. But still the chicken butter masala was worth of a try...
Now their service... It was very wonderful and better than any other restaurants we visited.. They all were friendly and caring I must say....
Everything is fine good except the no of tables :')...
They should think about a broader place :')...
Definitely a worth visiting.. :)

From last 5 years I have not been in the place which is so nice with food and also highly pocket friendly.
Get into the place after reading reviews in Zomato.The restaurant is located at Purna Das road and can accommodate only 14 to 16 people at a time which made us wait for 45 minutes outside to get a table.
However the food made us forget this pain of waiting outside with a hungry stomach.
We ordered Afghani Chicken,Mutton Bhuna, keema Kulcha,Cheese Kulcha,sahi tukda,Lime soda and Masala Cold Drinks.
The Afghani Chicken was lip smacking,full with butter and tender Chicken.Mutton Bhuna was also delicious and the cheese kulcha was just superb.
The Sahi Tukra was there to complete our feast with perfect taste and texture.
Only Masala Cold Drinks was found to be over spicy.
But seriously this restaurant took our heart with billing amount of only 720 rs. In total.
The restaurant is small but it's worth visiting with friends again and again and they are thankfully up for home delivery so one can also enjoy these lip smacking food at home.
Hope to visit this place again and again and try other dishes.

Generally, I take time before writing a good review and this one was clearly one of them. A straight 5 on 5 is what this place deserves. I can write lengths about my experience here but i think it’s wiser to stick to the point. However, i would like to know one thing, which is, how can this place afford to serve such good stuff on such cheap prices?! Like how?!
                                                                ...

Worst food and service ! Invariably they will take unnecessarily longer time to deliver the food and then what they deliver is mostly undercooked food!

This is a newly opened restaurant situated in Purna Das Road next to the Wise Owl Cafe. Unfortunately it is a little small; as a result of which on a Sunday it was very crowded and we had to wait for around 1 hour before we got a place. It was a worth a wait as the food was tasty. Each dish had its own unique taste. We ordered all non vegetarian dishes such as the chicken chaap, mutton kebab, afghani tangri kebab and in the end we had firni. We also tried the burhani which was good too. I definitely recommend it

It must be a great a great place to get food delivered from but I had a casual dining experience here and it was not so fruitful. The place is small and congested. Although we reached late, the staff was not so efficient. Other tables food were delivered to us what was a mix up. The food was also served a tad bit late as the place is under staffed for a full house scenario. But the pros is the food quality and the pricing. 3-4 people can have a tight dinner for around Rs. 500. Overall I guess it could have been a better experience if we visited the place on a less busier day or time but my experience was quite average altogether.

The food is usually fresh and prepared well.  Although avoid ordering the breakfast menu in the evenings. Being a vegetarian,  this place was a treat for me. The menu includes all the basic vegetarian dishes served with well cooked chapattis.

The Feast Street is relatively a new kid on the block and have garnered enough likes in a short run. Going by the reviews, I chose this place for scheduling my birthday treat. Today, I went there along with two of my college mates. It is not so far from the Golpark crossing & can be spotted easily! The place was already full when we reached there. Thereafter, we were told to wait for few minutes. After half an hour, we got our designated table and we happily moved in. The interiors are done quite wisely and the ceilings are donned with caged lamps. The place is not so spacious and can become claustrophobic at times. One of their staffs attended us and handed over the menu.
We chose to order Mahi-E-Gulfam & Lasooni Kesar Malai Tikka as our starters. In our main course, we ordered Gosht & Murgh Deg Biriyani. As our side dish, we ordered Mutton Kosha and Delhi Style Butter Chicken.
The Mahi-E-Gulfam (fish preparation) was delicious and has the power to soothe your taste buds. On a rain drenched afternoon, the smoky outlook and the softness of the Mahi-E-Gulfam was no less than a nirvana.The Lasooni Kesar Malai Tikka failed to smack my taste buds and could have been better. The Deg Biriyani was plain and blatant. The Delhi style Butter Chicken also ignited nothing but disappointments. The complementary Burhani was tasty and worked like a reliever. I have got no idea about the taste of Mutton Kosha as it was solely for my friend. Well, she quoted it as a delicious escapade.
The service was not professional and should be improved extensively. The staff-in-charge missed one of our orders and we had to give him a reminder. We literally had to gulp down the starters after the main course for this above said reason. Quite weird and plightful! On top of this, the stern and rude looks from one of the staffs was quite a turn off. The glasses were also not refilled at frequent intervals. Fresh and clean spoons should accompany new dishes. Even, the mutton and chicken dishes were interchanged at one point. Although, the owner herself attended us and asked us about our ongoing experience.

I don't know what went wrong! This place has such high ratings but my visit was so terrible on so many levels. The Feast Street doesn't deserve 4.7 on Zomato and is absolutely overrated. My high expectations were shredded down to ashes..! Authority, are you listening?

A rain drenched evening made memorable by our impromptu, and somewhat impulsive decision to traverse more than 20kms from Rajarhat to the premises of this recently opened eatery on Purna Das Road,based on the extremely favorable reviews on Zomato. And voila, the reviews do not do justice enough! It's even better.

Starting off with a round of Kebab Platter - except for the chicken kebabs which was slightly underwhelming, the rest of the platter which included two fish kebabs & two Mutton seekh - were succulent and very good. However so, we weren't prepared for what was to come next - the Mahi - E-Gulfam and the Zeenat - E-Aab, kebabs of the freshest, juiciest Bhetkis. With just the right amount of garnishing, flavoring, sizzling (literally) presentation, these fish kebabs are one of the best we've tasted till date in the city. Especially the Zeenats were outstanding with their melt in the mouth quality and their slightly salty gingerly flavor - this was piece de resistance.
Our second favorite was the Burrah Kebabs - succulent Mutton pieces, slightly roasted - sumptuous - will remind you of the classic Mutton Adrak k Punje recipe.
We ended up ordering a second round of the Zeenats and Gulfams, they were so good.

Talking to one of the co owners, we came to know that the motivation behind the place was to replicate the Delhi style flavor of North Indian cuisine. By the sampling we did, Delhi's Chandni Chowk would be proud of a place like this. I can give no higher praise.

Two thumbs up to Feast Street - I hope it maintains its quality for us to return to it again, hopefully with a lesser waiting time for food (our only gripe with the service).

PS:No photos - which goes to show again how absorbed we were with only eating - totally forgot about it.

Located just beside Wise Owl Cafe...this place deserves 5 points no doubt.
I have been here two times and both times my stomach has been satisfied to the fullest.

Ambiance-- Yeah a very small place for sure with nice looking colourful walls..

Food-- We ordered Afghani Chicken for starters...and Chicken Biryani along with Delhi Style Butter Chicken for main course.
The next tym i had tandoori roti..butter nan...Awadhi Dum ka Gosht...and most probably Murgh Malai Tikka Masala...

Afghani Murg-- 4 huge chicken kebab pieces which were soft n juicy ...simply delicious...a must try

Chicken Biryani-- Was quite good as well...not very oily...light and sufficient enough for one person...Chicken and potato piece was soft and tasty as well...

Delhi Style Butter Chicken-- This dish is quite famous here...and it lived up to its hype...Was very tasty...went well with the biryani...thanks to the thick yummy gravy as well...

Now burhani was complimentary with biryani...now i don't lyk it so can't comment on that one..but according to my friends it was fine...

Now what was nice was that we were asked to give a review on zomato and check-in at fb and for that we got a complimentary firni which was also very tasty...

2nd visit

Tandoori Roti-- Perfect taste and quantity...

Butter Nan-- One f d best i have ever had for sure...yummyyy af...

Awadhi Dum Ka Gosht-- Oo Lala...Mama Mia...they not only make tasty chicken dishes...mutton dishes are equally tasty too...Soft n tender mutton pieces in thick tasty gravy...superb

Murgh Malai Tikka Masala-- The gravy of this one was just outstanding...me n my friend were literally licking the bowl off😂😂 Chicken were pieces were soft as expected...These people i tell you...are experts in gravy-making man...

Very good experience till now with this place...THUMBS UP...A MUST VISIT FOR ALL FOODIES OUT THERE...CHEERS!!!

I guess for the past week, Zomato has been chanting the name of this particular restaurant on Purna das road just a little times too many... So a foodie like me was inevitably attracted to this little eatery in town with expectations brimming... And hands down, as usual, a Zomato recommendation can never go wrong... The Feast Street simply blew me away and for a number of reasons. First of all, let me inform anyone reading my review that do have some time to spare if u r visiting this place. The eatery is crammed suffocatingly and it might not be the place for u if luxury dining is an imperative for a meal. It almost takes 30 minutes for them to spare a seat and it might border on irritation for some, but let me assure u people, the food is soooo worth the wait. Well to the food then,
For starters, we tried...
Delhi Fried Tangdi-- I guess all chicken lovers drool over the name of fried chicken and if it is cooked as perfectly as this dish, there is nothing more that one can ask for. The chicken was fried just perfectly... Not a bit over, not a bit under and the final touch of chaat masala sprinkled all over the chicken took the dish to a whole different level.
Murgh Surg Angar-- This is absolutely the starter I would recommend the most... Please do have a go at this dish... Six chunks of kebab sizzled and served over freshly cooked cabbage leaves would just take ur breath away.The meat was so soft that it almost melted off the cutlery and erupted into a foodgasm in our mouths.
To the mains then, we went for,
Chicken deg biriyani (Special)-- First of all I want to commend the quantity... They are really generous when it comes to that. Two pieces of chicken, the imperative of a bangali biriyani--Aloo and the heart thanks the good lord when u find two pieces of that in ur plate of rice and a boiled egg makes for a sumptuous and perfect meal.
Delhi style butter chicken -- The tangy tinge of tomato in the dish was really a treat to have... However sumhow I would have loved it if the pieces were boneless... But that's just because I'm aimlessly splitting hairs..😅
Bhuna mutton-- I would plead any one reading my review to have this... It was mutton at its best... I can still smell that aroma it seems... And the inevitable happened... I'm drooling over the memory of the dish again... Please taste it for urself to get amazed.
Laccha paratha and butter naan-- Both the types of mughlai bread were soft and light... No complaints whatsoever...
And although our stomachs vowed it can't take any more, we forced down a dessert and thank God we did...
Shahi tukda-- A piece of crisp bread covered in a cream and kesar malai paste was the perfect way to end the meal...
As for the staff, they are good enough and as for the pocket pinch... All this gluttonish devouring of ours cost just 1200 bucks... So definitely I recommend The Feast Street for all true foodies. Treat urselves to one of the best pocket friendly eateries in town.

Since the place is getting a good response, and it cannot accommodate too many people at a time, so it should extend its home delivery services at least till patuli or garia

So,after hearing a lot of good things about this place, i finally got the opportunity to be there.
And i wasn't disappointed one bit.
Though it's not a huge place,( it can accommodate about 15-20 people at a time) you won't be feeling claustrophobic. The place has a very good vibe about it.
Nicely decorated which adds to the feel good factor.
Coming to the food.
To put it in a simple way, it's delicious.
My personal favourites are chicken tandoori and  Afghani chicken.
Especially for any new visitor, the Afghani chicken is a must.
Soft, nicely cooked chicken in white creamy gravy.
A delight for all the mughlai food lovers.
The one negative point though is their dessert menu.
Though the firni was decent, Sahi tukda was not at all upto the mark.
I hope they work on it in the near future.
The service is pretty good.
And i had the opportunity to interact with the owner of the place.
An amiable person who was very keen to know about the feedbacks of all the dishes we ordered.
So i recommend all the food lovers of Kolkata to give a visit there and i can assure you, your taste buds will be in for a treat.☺️

Went there with a big gang. Interior is small. They can arrange for a maximum of 18-20 people at a time. But other than that, everything was marvelous!! We ordered a lot of dishes. Tandori, kulcha, makhani, paneer, raita, mttn nd chkn biryani, afgani chkn, tikka masala, resmi bttr masala, phirni, sahi tukda, rabri blah blah. Each and every item was perfect. They serve fast, They serve a huge amount of food at very low cost, their style of serving food is unique. I liked that sizzler styled chickn tandoor. I have never seen such servings before. A must go place. Thumbs high up!!

It's a small cosy restaurant near Triangular Park. It serves North Indian, Lebanese and Mughlai dishes (I didn't get the opportunity to taste the Lebanese food this time around, I surely will next time I'm there).

Food: IT WAS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL. We ordered tandoori chicken, butter chicken (Delhi style), Awadhi dum ka gosht, pudina rumali roti, peas pulao, khushka pulao. Apart from the pudina rumali all the items were very well prepared and tested really good. You would be surprised to know that all this costed just a little bit over ₹1000.

Service: As it is a small place we had to wait for a bit to get seats. The staff is very courteous​ although the service was very slow ( they were very busy with the online orders) but the owner was observant enough to notice our frustration (and offered us complimentary drinks).

Ambience: The place is quite small with only 20-22 seats. The walls are well covered with murals and lighting is fine too.

Overall, I liked the place very much and I hope to go there again very soon.
Great job guys, keep it up!

Another gem of a restaurant in the by lanes of Purna Das road. Quirky decor that's sure to catch your eyes, though the seating arrangement is not too good. 

Ordered Kebab platter, Butter chicken Delhi style, tandoori roti and chicken biriyani. The service is extremely slow. Had to nag a few tyms for our food. But the wait was totally worth it. The kebabs were served like a sizzler. But was disappointed with the mutton pieces. It was not well cooked. 
The butter chicken was outstanding, and went just WOW wd the roti. The chicken biriyani was good too - very light nd not too oily. Half portion is sufficient for a person.
Best thing - No extra taxes. So pocket pinch is not at all too much.
Also free parking. Drive, Eat, Repeat!!

Heard alot about this restaurant from one of my friends and was planning to try their delicacies since a long time. It is situated in Purna Das Road just beside Wise Owl Steakhouse ( a 5-7 mins walk from Hindustan Park more). A cosy but very small place so it is a bit difficult to get seats there as space is a bit issue. We had to wait for about a good 25-30mins to manage a seat there but as the bhukkar in me says- Ache khane ke liye kuch bhi :") And trust me the wait has been fruitful in all means as the food was really tasty, fresh and amazing. The restaurant is neat and clean with minimal decoration and with amazing wall paintings. Now let's come to the tasty part; Yes the FOOD--
We have ordered for-

1) Lahsooni murgh malai kebab ( It was a starter item and this kebab dish tasted just too good. There are 4 pieces of chicken for half plate and 6 pieces of chicken for full plate. The chicken kebab was served beautifully in a bed of shredded cabbage and it was sizzling hot and smokes were effing out from the dish and it tasted amazing. The chicken pieces were meaty and succulent. Totally loved this one. )

2) Butter chicken Delhi style ( Another amazing tasty dish which was also served hot and fresh and all of the chicken pieces were good and cooked to perfection. The chicken pieces will just melt in your mouth.)

3) Cheese Kulcha (Awesome in taste. If you are a lover of cheese and Indian breads then this one is the item to surely try along with some side dish)

4) Rumali Rotis ( Very soft and large in size. Good to go with any of the side dishes.)

5) Masala cold drinks ( Coke/ Pepsi with special ingredients. Good in taste )

Had a satisfying experience out there. Service is promt. Staffs are courteous. But space is a bit issue so better you drop in there early if you are visiting with a large group.

** All of the food items were inclusive of taxes. So no extra tax or GST. Yay! Economical and student friendly and surely a hidden gem.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ALL THE FOOD LOVERS. I am also gonna visit there soon.

This place amazed me. Such great food at such a price is like winning a jackpot. The people tending to customers are very courteous and they do enjoy seeing our happy faces. Must, must go. Not once not twice but till you try all their dishes. I had read the reviews and chose a few from the dishes which was already reviewd delicious.
So....Bharwan Tangri - soft, perfectly made kebabs with the right amount of juiciness. Lipsmacking good. The flavour and the taste will make you crave it again. Its a beautifully made dish.
Mutton Reshmi kebab - It's spicy as hell but not that it'll make you stop midway. This again is very well made dish. The mutton was a little tight but never the less the dish was awsome.
Lacha Paratha and Bhuna Mutton - This combo was suggested the person from the restaurant and the taste justified it. The sweet and spicy soft mutton complemented the Paratha beyond perfection. The mutton melts and gravy is finger licking.
Mutton Biriyani - Quite, quite good. Perfect aloo, Perfect Rice and melting mutton. What else do you need?
This place has a great cook working behind those doors!
Firni was okayish. Had the aroma, a little grainy. You can try the other deserts.
Now comes the best part. The total bill was 872. We were just two people and we ate so much because the food was amazingly good and then the bill comes to this. This has won my heart.
The place is small and you will find it occupied any time of the day and week. So better be early! But the people are super polite and always with a smile. I am definitely coming back with more people.

This place is really unique with its quality food.The ambiance and tasty food really makes one's mood better.I ordered a three course meal starting with Chicken fried wings followed by roti, Butter Chicken and Rogan Josh.The butter chicken is one of the best food I recommend you to have it.Shahi tukra is also okay but the firni lifted my mood.Everything is nice but servicing is poor.We waited a lot outside and they didn't even called us in so apart from that it's a pocket friendly restaurant to treat ourselves with Mughlai dishes.Try it out.

This place has recently been the talk of the town. On my visit to this place the first thing to catch my eyes was the graffiti on the walls. The interior is modern and fun.
Coming to the menu, it's pretty reasonable. We ordered keema kulchas, chicken bharta, chicken biriyani and phirni. The food tasted delicious. The bharta is a must try. The quantity is filling.

The only con is the serving time. You need to wait a while to taste such delicious food.

The food was average. Service was a wee bit sloppy. The decor was commendable, but they need to work up on the kitchen, the place where they clean their utensils are just next to the washroom. Its a cool place for "hey whats that new food joint, lets try it out" but not for... "Its been a long time haven't had good food lets go to this particular restaurant" Quality and service can be improved. Overall experience: 7/10

For the average cafe-goer, this place represents a change of world because it's not a cafe though the vibe is there.
Dropped by this place a couple of days back and here's what I felt-

Food- quite good. I ordered dal tadka and plain roti (don't judge, I am on diet -_-). I really felt the food was good. They take a little time to serve but I have no complain about the food.
My friend ordered a reshmi kebab tortilla wrap which was average.
We also ordered a plate of shahi tukra which was also quite good. 
So, definitely you can check it out if you want a little change of taste from your regular cafe food.

!! The Feast Street !!
A place to treat yourself with the beautifull menu they offer. Located at Purna Das Road near Golpark . Beautifully decorated.

◆ Appetizer
● Delhi Style Fried Tangri (5/5) : Something new which The Feast Street offers. Fried Chicken Tangri is not that uncommon but there is something different flavours in it. When you take a bite of the chrunchy part, you gate to taste succulent the juicy chicken inside. Strongly Recommended.

● Pomfret Tandoor (5/5) : Pomfret Tandoor a mouthwatering delicacy perfectly marinated and grilled and served as a Sizzler. The pomfrets are beautifully cooked with care and love. The spicy tandoor masala and sizzling flavours tastes delicious with the grilled fish.
Strongly Recommended.

● Afghani Chicken (4/5) : Chicken legs and breast pieces are perfectly marinated and cooked afghani style.. Served as sizzlers. The chicken pieces are decent size and can be shared by 2 or 4 as a appetizer.

● Alu Sugandhi (4.5/5) : Big size potatoes are perfectly boiled and cut into half sliced and stuffed with paneer, badam and tiny pieces of onions. Cooked nicely in low flame. First time to try this Alu Sugandhi and it was really good. One should try this.

◆ Main Course
● Laccha Roti (3.5/5) : Something innovative. This is something different they serve.. Laccha Roti a mixture of both Laccha Parantha and Tandoori Roti..

● Dal Makhani (3.5/5) : A Punjabi dish which is a mixture of Dal with cream and butter.

● Bhindi Zaiquedar (5/5) : This is something everyone must try. Really surprised to try this Bhindi Zaiquedar. I coudn't have imagined that a Bhindi Curry would be so delicious . Strongly Recommended.
● Delhi Style Butter Chicken (4/5) :

● Mutton Rezala (3/5) : A famous Bengali recipe. Mutton was perfectly cooked in yogurt stew. Can be eaten as a side dish.

● Mutton Bhuna (4.5/5) : It is ana exotic Indian recipe. The mutton is cooked in its own juices with indian spices and masala until it gives a beautiful dark brown colour. Tastes absolutely delicious and can be eaten with any type roti or parantha or rice. Strongly Recommended.

● Gosht Deg Biryani (5/5) : Here comes the Biryani. Ahh!! Laajawab. It is served with 2 pieces of alu, 2 pieces of mutton and 1 egg. The quantity of the biryani is enough to be shared by 2 people. The mutton pieces are decent in size and really soft and soothing. Cokked and served with love and care. ❤
Strongly Recommended. Must try.

Really honoured to be invited by Mr. Chitrasena Bhattacharya and Ritwika Banerjee for the brief explaination of the dishes.
Last but not the least

This was my second visit to this place and unlike the first visit, was lucky enough this time to get a table ( only after waiting for 30mins ). 

The place has a really nice and quirky decor. The space is small though. It can accommodate about 20 people at a time.

Coming to the food, we had ordered,
1. Lasooni Murgh Malai tikka kebab : The kebab pieces were considerably big and juicy as well. The taste was completely lip-smacking. The green chutney complimented it very well.

2. Badami Murgh: This had 6 pcs of chicken. The gravy was just extraordinary, I loved it. Highly recommended. It went well with both tandoori roti and biriyani.

3. Gosht deg biriyani : Considerable amount of the good old 'aloo' biriyani. The special platter was enough for 3 people. The mutton pieces were tender as well. The complementary Burhani with the Biriyani just made it even better.

4. Firni: Not something extraordinary but I liked it. It was not bad.

5. Shahi Tukda : I did not like this. It was too sweet and the bread was not soft at all, like it should have been. 

Staff was courteous and well mannered however they took an order wrong. But maybe there was some sort of miscommunication. That's still acceptable. 

The only reason why I cut that 0.5 points is the Shahi Tukda.

However, would like to visit the place again and try out their other dishes.

Immediately after having the very fast bite on the Murg Surg Angar (Chicken Kebab) I realized why this tinny place is rated 4.6 on Zomato.
In one word sexy food indeed. 😍😍
First come to the ambience, a very small place approximately eighteen people can be accommodated in a single time. Well decorated, very good modification of a street restaurant. Lampshades reminded me the old day home memories of mine. Walls are representing the various cultures of Kolkata. The only draw back in this beautiful ambience is the refrigerator. It could be shipped to the pantry.
Now come to service, trust me the behavior of the employees there is just heart touching. Not that much of show off. So much down to earth. They will feel you like you are having dinner in the place of any relative of yours.
Now come to the food, you will definitely find better food or the same quality food in other restaurants in Kolkata, but I bet you can't find it at this price anywhere except here. If any one wants a complete dinner or lunch including proper starter, main course and dessert then Half Biriyani will be enough for a average person. And it comes only on Rs.129/-. The best thing is the bill would not include any taxes.
It would theke Rs. 600/- only to make a foodie couple happy..

This place is surely a gem.. went there along with my friends.. we had mutton biryani and chicken malai tikka masala.. I'll definitely place the biryani among the top 5 biryani in Kolkata.. everything was so perfect about it.. the mutton was soft and not overcooked.. the rice was perfectly steamed and wasn't too greasy or spicy.. the chicken malai tikka masala was out of the world.. amazingly tasty and the chicken pieces were so soft.. would definitely visit again and will surely try out other various items in the menu.. 
PS: please take some time in your hand before you visit this place.. it's a small outlet and we (a group of 11) had to wait for almost an hour to get inside.. but the food 😍😍 definitely worth the wait..

One of the best finds of mine while searching for a place that serves biriyani without leaving a hole in the pocket. Very friendly staff, a lovely ambience makes it up for the small place that they are set up in. But the best part is the lovely food. Recommended are Gosht Biriyani and Butter Chicken Delhi style.

Newly listed and tremendously crowd puller. Just had a visit. One thing is pretty sure that you have to wait in queue until they call you.
Tiny food joint located beside wise owl steakhouse. Very much pocket friendly, student friendly to be more precise 😂. It did pique our curiosity when we noticed people waiting near feast Street being ignorant to other food places in that lane. Some waiting for half an hour but didn't bother to drop the plan and get into another place. It's worth though. Food quality is heavenly.
Stuffs are good and the entire management team is very courteous.
What more do you need! Cheaper price, good food, good stuffs pretty much sums up all.
And yes the Price mentioned is inclusive all the taxes.
We had afgani chicken, chicken butter masala with butter tandoori roti.
It'd probably grabbed 5 but yes the waiting time is really unbearable when you're hungry. And the tables are so close to each other i couldn't even listen to the person in front of me. Happening student friendly place, not for long uninterrupted conversations.

I am yet to visit this place, but i ordered food from here recently seeing the excellent rating on Zomato. Ordered Tangri kabab, Reshmi kabab, Chicken Bharta and Chicken Tikka Roll.. only 800/- bucks for the generous quantity of food that was delivered. The food quality was good, the kababs were succulent and the Bharta was tasty. The Tikka rolls were very filling. Would definitely give this one a thumbs up!

This is a small little place located at Purna das road in Hindustan Park. The place is rally small and can accommodate maximum of 15-20 people at a time. Definitely a nicely decorated place with decent ambience. We were really hungry and very excited for their dishes and ordered the following dishes :

 Bharwan Tangri kebab, Special Mutton Biryani, Chicken Mirch Masala and Masla cold drink.

# Bharwan tangri was out of the world. Soft succulent pieces of tangri stuffed with well cooked mutton keema and grilled with perfection. The pieces were almost boneless and the chicken was fresh and tasted delicious. Definitely a must try dish for everyone.

# Special Mutton Biryani was very light and had a great fragrance. Rice was well cooked and the flavours were spot on. Served with 2-3 big and well cooked tender pieces of mutton, two potatoes and one egg. This may not be the best biryani in Kolkata but surely it can give a tough competition to the leading biryani outlets of Kolkata.

# For the side dish we ordered Chicken Mirch Masala. The gravy was nicely made and had an unique flavour of chillies in it. served with 4 soft , juicy pieces of chicken. This is a good dish if you want something spicy with your Biiryani.

# Masala Cold drinks was great. It had Perfect amount of masala in it and helped us to wash down those dishes easily.

Overall a really value for money place. Staffs were very friendly so as the management but the service was very slow. Prices were very reasonable and everything was inclusive of GST.
A highly Recommended place for everyone.........

Am very disappointed with their service.I went there on a weekend and they gave our seat 1hour later..The place is too small.And the staffs are very slow.I heard a lot about this place but my luck was bad maybe that I had a bad experience.The lady managing there was also very confused..
The food was very good..The quantity is too good at a reasonable price.
But I would like to tell the managing team to look after the service matter as this is the most important thing a customer needs.

We went out to this wonderful place and we were delighted to get the smell of kababs from the moment we entered into the gastropub...there are varieties of kababs and all comes in sizzler plates..the starters are too good. We had the bharwa chicken tangri which was filled with keema stuffings..Main course was too good... Do taste the lucknowi paratha..bhurani is also a must try..lot to explore and most importantly the bill will not burn your pocket..The people are very friendly over there and the owner herself welcomes you with a warm smile and she can suggest you some good foods..

Feast Yeah …!! Really a feast… Located near Hindustan Park Area just adjacent to Gariahat and Traingular Park area at Purna Das Road.

The seating capacity is around 18-20. Now i come to the decor. It is very artistic. One side of the wall is being drawn and painted in a artistic way whereas the other side of the wall being framed with hindi letters. Loved that one. 4.5 out of 5 for decor from my side.

Now i come to the food matter.. Ufff… My goodness… Can’t get much better than this. Highly recommended from my side. No points to cut. Even the prices are very reasonable. Thumbs up to the quality and the quantity matter and even the taste. Too good.

Pomphet Tandoor– Till the best one. It will give you the feeling of goanese food. Its being cooked in such a way, can be said just “Phenomenal”. The taste was perfect and the preparation too. The must try one out over here.

Delhi Style fried Tengri Chicken– Chicken legs being marinated overnight and then being fried deeply. Trust me the chicken was really juicy and crispy. The preparation being served with a sauce.

Afghani Chicken – Oho..!! Mind blowing chicken pieces being marinated and then baked in a oven and being served on a sizzler plate, makes it a perfect kebab.

Alu Sugandhi– It is basically a stuffed potato where the stuffing is of paneer and other ingredients. This being served on a sizzler plate too. Perfect one for veg lovers.

Bhindi Zaiqedar– “A W E S O M E”… Means really awesome. Best ever bhindi preparation ever had. Its a must try item on the list. Both recommended for veg and non-vegetarians. Lovely.

Dal Makhani– Perfect in taste. Dal cooked with other ingredients and its perfect.

Mutton bhuna – Mutton keema being prepared and cooked with continuous stirring. Perfect in taste and the quality is good too.

Chicken Butter masala– This preparation of chicken is nice. Its little spicy along with creamy too. Quality is good along with the taste. Loved it.

Mutton Rezala– Perfect one with biryani. Less spicy. Little sweet in taste and the quality of mutton is good too.

Mutton Biryani–  Ooooooo… This is love… Last but not the least. Quantity is enough. Not much oily. Perfect in taste. If you are a biryani lover and health conscious too then must opt for this. Quality is much better. Mutton pieces are just too good. Thumbs up..!!

I don’t remember what we did last Wednesday morning (sleep, I think??) – my day started with lunch. And WHAT. A. LUNCH. Great place for some quality, pocket friendly North Indian dishes,  located near Hindusthan park on Purna Das Road. They say there are three things people remember about a Restaurant: the Food, the Ambiance, the Service. The majority seem to think that if there’s one thing you should splurge on when it comes to your Lunch or Dinner, it should be the food.
                                                                ...

Where do I even start?I absolutely love this place.I love the decor and cozy seating arrangements.Coming to their food,my favourites are:
1.Firni.Tastes heavenly.
2.Cheese kebab.Fresh and yum.
and last but not the least,Murgh and Gosht Biriyani.
And another plus is that the food is not the costlier side for the college students and so worth it for people who loves food,like myself.

It has become my favourite food joint of all times. On our first visit we ordered-
1. Murg deg biriyani (Biriyani was oil free and very very well cooked. The piece of chicken was huge!) - 5/5
2. Butter chicken in delhi style (cooked in authentic delhi style and very tasteful) - 4.7/5
3. Rumali roti with creamy Afghani chicken (It's a preparation of chicken in white gravy. THIS IS THE BEST PREPARATION I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. Everytime I visit this place, I make sure to have this dish atleast)- 10/5!
4. Raabri 👌

The restaurant, though small, serves quality food and the owners are very humble and generous.
Moreover, the food is tax inclusive and quite affordable.

Well it is located beside the wise owl coffee shop near hindustan park
Place is appeared to be small and it was almost full so had to wait outside for any people to leave 
One six seats table we got and the person from there requested us to share it with other couple becoz they were waiting too but anyhow we agreed becoz we were really hungry but soon after one seat was available and those two couple shifted there so we were cool with it 
Now if i come to food it was *delicious* we didnt ordered much as my Appetite is small we ordered just peas pulao chicken tikka masala and one masala cold drink 
Food was really awesome ambiance was aint bad though and pocket friendly too the staff's behaviour was also very sweet and yes i would like to visit here again just becoz of the food it was really yummyy😘❤

Nice posters all around and a T.V was there with the live cricket match going on fortunately. Now, the food was very good in that budget it was 5/5. Awesome taste nice service and gestures we got from the waiters too. We ordered murgh tikka masala(awesome taste), chicken biryani(for these type that was nice i.e 4.6/5), panner pulao, panner kadhai.All in one it was excellent place to visit for a quality food lovers in these budget.

Hidden gem of Hindustan Park

Ambience: Went to the “Cloakroom” for a late night dinner. However, found it closed and hence came to the opposite lane to visit “Wise Owl”. Located just beside the Wise Owl, this resto easily grabs the eyeball with its bright lights and décor. After much thinking, decided to give it a try. Even on a weekday, the eatery was fully packed and we had to wait for some time before a table was emptied. The entire place is very vividly coloured with graffiti all along the walls. And a bit of Bollywood dialogues in frames. The plates are innovative concentric circles and even the water bottles they placed in the table contained witty one liners. The idea of tissue roll on the table is also very innovative. Entire place was spick and span.

Food: We ordered a Pankhai Kebab, a Butter Changezi and Keema Kulcha. The kebabs were soft and juicy and had a filling inside them. With their heavenly taste the kebabs totally prepared us for the wonderful foodgasm we were going to have. The Butter Chengazi though was rich, but tasted so good that even knowing that the oil intake is going to be too much we even smacked the gravy clean from the bowl. The Keema kulcha was also filling. Finally we ordered a sugar free Firni, which was the perfect dessert to end the yummilicious dinner we had. Totally overwhelmed with their food quantity and quality.

Service: The service is pretty good. However, the serving time can be improved though. The owners stay in front of the restaurant and try their best to make the experience good for the customers, special mention to the elegant young lady who stood and made sure that our table was well cleaned before greeting us in and taking our helmets. The price is inclusive of all taxes and hence the pocket pinch is really really low. Cash and card is accepted. Parking is available. 

Overall: Definitely recommended for any foodie in Kolkata.

Well this new kid in the block is a rockstar i must say! Hope they will keep the same quality and quantity of food! 
A small place, but very well managed, around 25seats available, with very interesting decor in the wall, filled with foodie comics. 
One of the owner was herself present, and was managing the place extremely well i must say. 
Now coming to the food, we order afghani chicken, now this is a must try, its kind of the rashmi kebab flavoured tandoori, in tangdi, served on a sizzler platter! Just too good! 
Next we had the delhi style butter chicken with butter naan, and it was really delicious! The butter chicken had a unique taste, and it did taste like the street served butter chicken of delhi!(this is a compliment :D) At last we had the shahi tukra, which was really good, and was also huge in size, fully justifying the price. The cold drink over here is served at mrp+rs5 establishment charge, which is really appreciated! Other places rip off their customer. 
And the menu prices are inclusive of taxes. 
What else do you want! Like really the best place :D 
Cheers to the management!

Orders
Starters- chicken cheese kabab.
Juicy chicken kababs 4pieces for half plate with cheese toppings. Juicy served with salads and pudina chatney in a sizzling style.
Main course- we have ordered
1 keema polao which is good and has a burnt flavour. Although the amount of keema was less in that rice.
1 butter chicken delhi style full. 6 big big pieces of chicken were served and the gravy has its own aroma and different achari flavor which i never tasted before. Authentic dish
Then we had laccha roti where roti made of aata was served. Never tasted this lacha roti before. Good for health
Pocket pinch was 665.
P.s they had added an extra firni in our bill. We didn't noticed that then. Later when we noticed that we called them they promised us to adjust it in our next visit.
So here a good management with a proper combination of tasty food

I don't know from where should I start. I am just overwhelmed with everything. They serve great food. Simply great. The biriyani was too good. Beside that we ordered three side dishes; chicken Tikka masala, Afghani chicken and chicken reshmi butter masala. All of them were unique from each other Nd each of them tastes toooooooo gud.  I am a big fan of tandoori chicken and have tried tandoori from many many restaurants. But I must say here u will get one of the best tandoori chicken. Rightly cooked, still soft Nd tasty.. Nd to the top of it they impressed me more with the sweet part.. the rabri was awesome. I loved it  Nd I hope everyone will. We also tried the Sahi tukda. It was also good. 

Before I end I must say. The "full" plate of biriyani was indeed a bit too full for a foodie like me to finish. 

The complimentary burhani was also toooooooo good. I not only drank the one belonging to me but also three of others.

We went there on Monday, the 21st. Heard a lot about it from friends and well-wishers. We ordered Chicken Biriyani, Butter Chicken Delhi Style and Luchi with mutton. The quantity of the Biriyani was enough for the price. We enjoyed the butter chicken dish to our heart's content. Surprisingly, the luchis were felt good with the mutton too. However, we wished the table would be larger as it was pretty difficult the accommodate all the plates and bowls. As for the ambience, it was above average. Wallet payment was accepted. The best part, the prices of the dishes served were too good to be true. Looking forward to visit again.

The best part, the prices of the dishes served were too good to be true. Looking forward to visit again.

I am not really into writing reviews but this time it is definitely worth it. By far the best food that I had this year. The only thing that this place can improve upon is its seating capacity. Overall, a really nice place.

It's located near gariahat connector...a 5 min walk from basanti devi clge. 
It's a nyc place for foodies. It's pocket friendly. Staffs are very much cooperative and friendly. Ambience and decoration are attractive..service is prompt. 
We ordered chicken lasooni kebab..it was served with raita. It had a "smoky" appearance. Highly recommended preparation.
In the main course, we tried lucknowy paratha, butter nun, badam chicken. They provided 2 pcs of paratha in 1 plate. Nun was soft and buttery. Badam chicken was very tasty. Highly recommended for chicken lovers. 
Atlast we had burhani. It was a combo of cold pudina flavoured dahi (raita kind of). It was okayish in taste. A good experience. Want to visit it again😋

To start of with the owners are great people. Specially the beautiful lady, who cared enough for the beggar outside when we approached her to arrange some food for the old man staring from the outside. She did it and eventually came up to us to inform that his food has been arranged. Now coming to the food! Each and every item that we ordered, specially the kebabs are just little drops of heaven. The only thing that can tentatively be a little concerning is the fact that the orders do take up a lot of time. If that can be taken care of, I am sure this joint will definitely be one of the busiest prime joints in South Kolkata.

I'm in love with this place. It has become one of my favorite mughlai restros in the city. I had amazing mughlai dishes in many famous restaurants, but this little gem is something outstanding. I was extremely overwhelmed by the decor in such a tiny place, the beautiful wall painting, hanging lights and most importantly an amazing combination of black plate and colorful surface of the table. The warm welcome by the pretty lady out there and all the other stuffs was really appreciated . Now coming to the food, well the first sentence of my review is just a reflection of those heavenly good dishes. Kebabs were well cooked, juicy and succulent . We had lasooni and kasturi Murgh kebab. The lasooni nun was Ahhmaaziinng as well as the Murgh tikka butter masala, beautiful rich creamy gravy. The Delhi style butter masala was a bit different, I really liked that tangy flavor though. Last but not the least 'the Firni' was cherry on the cake. I would love to visit this place again and again cause it's pocket friendly too.

Loved the food. All the kebabs were serves in full sizzler style. Piping hot. Loved the decor. The staff were very courteous. The Biriyani was yummy.Loved the prawns and the shahi tukra.Just two points. They should increase the space a bit and the food takes huge time. We waited for about 45 minutes to get the first item delivered. Rest were fabulous.

This place is only 4 months old but the quality of food they serve would easily surpass that of decades-old super-expensive restaurants. We had the chicken reshmi wrap (which is somewhat like shawarma without the humus but with mayo), kebabs, biryani and butter chicken. They also served us complimentary onion salad and raita with the biryani. The kebab was very soft, the wrap was delicious, and the special biryani would be enough for two people. The food, like I said, is to die for. This is the only restaurant that I'd considered giving a 5-star rating if it weren't for the highly inefficient staff. They were VERY courteous, but inefficient all the same. But in terms of food, The Feast Street is hands down one of the best restaurants in town.

It's located exactly beside wise owl. Had to wait more than an hour because the place is extremely small. But the stuffs are very very humble. They said sorry to us many times because of the inconvenience caused. We were very hungry so ordered one half chicken biriyani , one full chicken biriyani and one half mutton biriyani. The quantity was perfect. And tasted very good. The complementary burhani was okaish. Firni was good but the shahi tukra couldn't meet up my expectation. The bread was very hard to eat. But overall nice ambiance nice food and pocket friendly as well.

Disgusting 😡 service
Food is not good at all...we ordered gosht deg biryani.
But they told ..it will take one hour to serve...
So we ordered special murgh biryani and it was worthless..
The chicken was not cooked properly...only boiled...no taste...rice was dry..
We also ordered delhi style butter chicken...the taste was good...but the leg piece was small..and other pieces were also not good...
Complimentary burhani was not available they gave us 300 ml coke bottle...
Decor is okey not that good...less spacious...and their serving plates were too small for biryani..
So it's an over rated restaurant..donno how it's been rated 4.7

Stuffed kulcha
Murgh mirchi masala

Visited this place today. The restaurant is too small and can accomodate only 16-18 people at a time. We had to wait for more than an hour because the place was overcrowded and the staffs were all busy to serve some celebrities like Rituparna Sengupta and her friends. But the stuffs were really nice. They apologized several times for the delay. They were helpless actually. So, if you are planning to visit the place, you should have enough time to spare.

Now let's come to the food. The food was really nice compared to the price. We ordered chicken and mutton biriyani, firni and sahi tukra.They even serve complemantary burhani with biriyani. Both quantity and quality were satisfying. The food was worth the wait. Moreover, they doesn't charge any extra GST on the price. So, it's quite pocket friendly you see.

I am writing this review after my third visit to this place and I must say that each time The Feast Steet has delivered nothing short of what I had expected. The Feast Treat offers delicious North Indian and Mughlai cuisine that will compel you to visit the place again and again. And the fact that their prices are so reasonable only adds to it. It might be a small place and if you visit it on the weekends chances are you have to wait outside because of the large crowds it has started to attract, but the food is worth the wait. And not to forget the service you get here. Overall I really like it and wish to try out as many of their dishes as possible.

Went to the feast street yesterday. Ordered chicken kebabs. I forgot the name but it is the first one in the menu. It was so good. 
Also ordered the special mutton biryani. Honestly it was quite average and very dry.
We also ordered fresh lime soda which was not chilled and too sweet although we asked for mixed. 
The major con is they take forever to serve the food. FOREVER. It's an okay place serving great kebabs.

My efforts to find this much-talked about place was entirely hassle-free and we were lucky to not have to wait to get a seat as it can accomodate maybe maximum 25 people at a time. Decor is funky.
We ordered the kebab platter which was absolutely delicious. We followed it with rumali roti and butter chicken Delhi style. It was a welcome change from the regular butter chicken with hints of tomato and cream. We washed it up with soft drinks. Price is very very reasonable.
The service staff are also courteous. Will come back soon for more. :)

Feast street is a new food place on Purna Das Road. While it's a very pocket friendly restaurant, and the food is really good they should improve their service. The staffs were not at all courteous and constantly were in a hurry to see us off. They didn't allow time between starters, main course and dessert. The waiters kept staring at us, indicating that we should leave. The bill was served before our food finished. The waiters were ready to pull the chairs away. Sorry, for the bad review but we paid for the food as well. @feaststreet

Went there on 17th of Aug.... we ordered Murgh tikka , Murg deg briyani , and Butter chicken in desi style their signature dish.... very disappointed with the service and the food... when i finished my starter .. the clearance was not done ... I need to call the server to clear my plate and refill water.... when they gave me main course plate they should have given fresh spoons as well for maincourse...  but they give me my used spoons .... again i call the server to give me fresh spoons... even my glass was empty for 30mins there is no one for refilling my glass with water... I had to serve food myself which was banged on the table. Their are only 6 tables which they can't handle....  I just went their because their ratings were good in zomato... They totally waste my time and mood.... when i complaint against this they offered me non-chargeable bill.... But I am not happy wid their service food and their staffs behaviour... Never ever go again....

First of all a kudos to the team of #TheFeastStreet the management and their staff were very cooperative and friendly they were very eager to help and serve us better which you won't find in most of the restaurants in Kolkata. 

Second the food, the food is just finger licking good. I actually have to admit, it was beyond my expectations, when it comes to food this restaurant is quite promising and the portion when compared to price is really good, though the took a bit of time to serve us but the taste made it up for it 

Third the ambiance of the restaurant is good and more of a cafe type but when comes to space it gets a bit congested, on talking to the management we got to know they will soon be opening at lords more, I wish them all the best and looking forward to it.

My over all experience was enough to rate it 4.5/5 0.5 remains just for the space. Had an amazing time and to achieve such popularity and hype in just 4 months from the opening is something which increases my expectation. This restaurant is quite promising for Kolkata

It's a pleasure to attend this resturant suddenly. The main plus point of this resturant is the ambience. The ambience is fabulous. This is a funky type ambience which is ideal for couple as well as for any group. Next is the food quality, that was awesome. First we ordered the kabab, that was delicious. Next was mutton and chiken biriyani. The quality of the mutton is just lovely, it was so soft and tasty also. The size of the picese of both mutton and chicken was very good. Next is the welcome behaviour of the resturant staff. It was unexpected, they treated us as a family member. I am appreciating their approach and taken care of their customer. I am satisfied with their behaviour, food quality.

It is a small and a beautiful food joint which is run by wonderful peoples. I loved the place first and foremost with beautiful art decors on the wall which was totally desi. We ordered the main course directly. We ordered a chicken biriyani and laccha Roti and I took murgh mirch masala as a side dish as suggested. And it was something. The chicken was grilled and the jalapeno and the tangy curry just made it more tasty. Yeah and Burhani (A Drink made of Dahi) was given as complimentary. And it was definitely good. 

P.S. no pictures as I was busy gorging in those tasty dishes.

The place is easy to locate. 
We ordered laccha paratha and plain nun along with chicken butter masala. The food was mouth watering.
The murgh malai tikka masala was also amazing. The Gosht Deg biryani was good too. Will definitely have it again in our next visit.
The staff were very courteous. A big thumbs up to them :)

Ordered for home delivery today and wasn't very satisfied with the food and service. I was told there would be a delay in receiving the food i.e one hour instead of 45 minutes. I received the food only after 1.5 hours and constant phone calls enquiring about the order. The tandoori chicken was undercooked and the food was cold. Didn't expect it to be so disappointing especially after reading  the reviews and ratings. Also, the lady who took the order wasn't very kind enough on the phone. Wouldn't recommend.

We finally ended up at this place after a really long time, of planning to visit it, looking at it's impressive rating !!
We were a bit disappointed upon entering it since it's pretty small and was literally cramped up. But somehow, we could adjust.(max.15-18 people at 1 time).
The ambience is just about decent and the decor is appealing, with some okayish pictures on one wall & a beautifully drawn, attractive painting on the other.Yellow bulbs decorated as lamps were hanging from the ceiling adding a sort of sparkle to the decor.
The waiters were well-mannered, specially the owner who was beautifully dressed(looked stunning) and extremely sweet in her talking & courteous in her approach.
Now coming to the food(for which the place is highly popular) -

1)Butter Chicken - Just delicious. Awesome taste and one of the best I've had in a while.But yes, it has bones. Still a MUST TRY !! (5/5)

2)Lachha Paratha - Was pretty light and smooth.Not at all heavy on the stomach.And tasty too along with decent presentation. (5/5)

3)Butter Naan - Soft, tasty and filling.If you're confused about the bread, just GO FOR THIS !! (5/5)

4)Gosht Deg Biryani(full) - Was nice.Nothing out of the world but good enough with sufficient quantity. (4/5)

5)Burhani - Was given along with the biryani(complimentary). Tasted very similar to Raita and was a nice combination with the biryani(4.5/5)

Overall,the place is really good if you're a foodie.The food is simply "Lajawab"... But yes the ambience could be improved & the chairs could be made a bit more comfortable. Otherwise a good place to go with friends for a filling meal at pretty cheap prices.
And the lady(probably the owner) is extremely polite and played an important part in our happy visit.
This STREET has a FEAST definitely worth trying !! :D

My 2nd visit was on 30th September, 2017...
Puja Special Menu was there.The food was awesome as before.. We tried -
1)Lasooni Kesar Murgh Kebab - With the green Indian dip, it was really delicious !! Give it a try. (5/5)
2)Murgh Bharta - Was utterly delicious. Boneless, with the right mix of masala & extremely tasty. (5/5)
3)Stuffed Kulcha - Was decent with the right amount of masala(4.5/5)

Another finger-licking food experience :D

Last Friday was my first time visit in this restaurant.The restaurant with its awesome food and interior won my heart completely. I again had to visit the next day to try out another dish.
Friday our order was mutton bara kebab and pomfret fry(can't exactly remember the dish) and firni.mutton bara kebab was too fresh and too good in taste 👌. Pomfret fry was the stealer.👌👌👌👌👌👍.Firni was perfectly tastes ,not too much sweet.

Next day I couldn't resist myself to try out another dish of them,I ordered for a chicken butter masala(delli style).
chicken butter masala was awesome neither too oily nor too spicy.
Location-just next to wise owl Purna das road
Ambience-good
Food-tooooooooo good.would definately recommend and visit infinity times.
Quality and quantity-very fresh and sufficient.

Final verdict-pocket friendly ,infinity time visit restaurant.
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍

Went there after hearing a lot about this place... It's a small food joint just beside wise owl... Though it's not a specious joint but the food is too good... We have ordered delhi style butter chicken,luknowi paratha n afgani chicken... That butter chicken was way too good n as it was less spicy, bliss to those people like me who don't like much spicy food... And the most important thing about this joint is it's very pocket friendly... Would love to visit there again...

Edit : came here for lunch today, opted for the mutton biriani combo with chicken chap and kabab 2pc.
As the Normal combo was not available. So as always the food was vry gd and tasty but the quantity was just half on the combo,i didn't think thats fair. Half pc of chap and Biriani rice was half. Little disappointed. Biriani should be full u cn make the salan half u knw. Took a rumali ruti to finish my meal. Again food was v. Gd but change the policy on quantity.hope u see this edit.

Popped by for a quick lunch as i was in the area for some work. Have been hearing good things about this place so gave it a try .

Its a small place just beside wise owl. Seating for around 18 people i think. A bit cramped when its full,and it's mostly full believe me. As this road is famous for food joints.
Wasted no time.orderd a mutton biriani full and bhuna gosht was recommended as a side dish.
Food came very quickly. The quantity of the biriani was enormous for 160 rs. The mutton piece was decent and soft,the aloo was big could be a little softer but ok. The taste was very good.long grains of rice subtle aroma. All good. Bhuna mutton has 2 pcs of mutton in a yummy gravy,well i have had bhuna mutton at many places, didn't taste familiar but it was very good. A glass of burhani was given complementary had a sip. As dont like yogurt based things.
Pocket pinch was 330. Had my belly and heart both full. Will be again to try some kababs.

P.s : found the staff and owners very courteous.

A sudden plan with my sister and a friend took me to this small yet creatively decorated food corner. Located in Hindustan Park, near Wise Owl, this food joint is not at all difficult to find. Coming to dishes, we had ordered #KushkaPolao, #ChickenChaap, #CheeseKulcha, #MalaiMurgTikkaMasala and #Phirni for dessert. The exquisite North Indian flavours were adequately felt in each and every dish. The food was too good to describe in words and the best part is that it is immensely pocket friendly. I would recommend this place to each and every person, whether foodie and non-foodie. Do visit #TheFeastStreet to give your taste buds the exotic experience of North Indian delicacies. Besides, you will be served with warm hospitality by the management. I wish them luck and will plan in the future to visit them soon! 😊

THE FEAST STREET- A tiny restaurant with few seating arrangement serves you the real good food you can ever ask for. From service to decor, food to its cost, it was just superb!!!
Location: In Hindustan Park, just next to Wise Owl. Very easy to locate. 

We ordered-
1. Lasooni Naan- This was soo soft with nice garlic flavor. 
2. Creamy Butter Tandoori Chicken- One of their signature dish. Perfectly cooked tandoori chicken tossed with creamy butter sauce was accompained with Lasooni Naan.
3. Awadhi Dum Ka Gosht- Another good dish of here. Mutton was so tender.
4. Masala Cold Drinks- Refreshing as always.

We were two and it costs us Rs.501/- (no extra GST they have charged). Worth every penny you spent.

Must Try- CREAMY BUTTER TANDOORI CHICKEN

P.S. I have never seen such a great service in a restaurant that made us feel like home. To all foodies, should try out this place, its a hidden gem. Can't wait to visit again!!!

Purna das road has a new address right beside the most popular overrated Wise owl. The food in The Feast Street is amazing. With its funky desi avataar it has kept the rich mughal taste intact.  The kebab platter, the mutton biryani and the mutton chaap was an absolute delight. And yes do not miss the buttermilk with the biryani!! Thats complimentary😊 You should most definitely try this outlet for good food and an amiable ambience👍

Feast street is the latest addition to the culinary list in kolkata. The outlet is around 4 months old and has won over the foodies of kolkata in such a short span on time with their lipsmacking food. The outlet is owned by Mr.Chitrasena who is doing a wonderful job in running the place.

The feast street offers both north indian and lebanese snackers but the one must gorge into their north indian to satiate their feast. This outlet is located in hindustan park just beside Wise Owl. The outlet has about sitting capacity of 20-22 people approx. So on the eve of Independence day my friends & I decided to have our lunch from here. Wary of the rush we decided to hit their as soon as possible but still had to wait for about 1 hour to get our seats.

The quirky decor & the whole ambience won us over. Really youthful and attractive to the eyes. Anyways we had the following array of items for our grand luncheon:-

1. Lasooni kesar malai tikka - 6pcs of tender juicy kebabs coated in kesar malai paste infused with garlic were presented to us along with condiments of mint chutney and onion salad. The quality of meat deserves a special mention, i have been to many places around kolkata but i hardly remember consuming such fine quality of meat. The coating of spices also tinkled our tastebuds highly. We were impressed with the dish. Taste & quality just stood out. Recommended!!

2. Murgh Surgh Angar - In simpler terms, this is basically chicken tikka kebab. Again this had 6pcs of chicken. As stated above the meat was again exemplary. The infusion of spices was just too good. We personally liked this kebab platter more than the previous one. Highly Recommended!!

3. Chicken Biryani - We had 2 plates of chicken biryani, one full & other one being the half. Half plate is good enough for non-heavy eaters while a full plate can easily suffice a heavy eater. Biryani comes with 1 soft piece of potato and 1 generous amount of chicken breast piece. The aroma and taste of the rice just took us to wonderland,so enticing to say the least. However the only flaw i found with the dish was chicken. It was overcooked due to which it had a bit rubbery texture & eventually tasted dry. All the biryanis were accompanied by a glass of complimentary burahni shots(curd based drink),the burahni was really well made & refreshing. But overall the biryani is worth the try.

4. Gosht Biryani - My friend had this. It came with 1 big chunk of delicious soft mutton and 1 potato. The mutton biryani is the dish one must should try here. The mutton was so tender that it could be cut & eaten with a spoon. The mutton also had no odd smell which insisted on the fact about the freshness and cooking of the meat. Recommended!!

5. Delhi style butter chicken - We had taken a full dish which consisted of 6pcs. This is considered as their in house speciality & oh boy it sure did lived up to its reputation. The gravy was rich,creamy & spicy as how it should be. This really complimented our biryani really well. The chicken pieces were generous in size & again the quality was just top notch. Highly recommended!!

6. Firni - We originally wanted to try the rabri but to our dismay it was not available. So instead we settled ourselves with the classic firni. The firni was more kesar malai based which i liked it personally topped with crushed pistachios. First spoonful we took and it was literally mouthgasm. Personally i can vouch that this is best firni i have had in terms of taste till date. However my only complain would be the texture i.e. the firni had not completely set and was rather runny beneath the upper layer. But still one must have this otherwise you would be missing one hell of a dessert.

We were left completely bamboozled with the flavours of the food. The final bill was also on the lower respectable side with per head costing coming to around Rs 405 per head. No extra GST/service charge is charged on the final bill. The service also deserves a special mention,very prompt & attentive. The serving of the food barely took time. Mr. Chitrasena was very interactive with all the diners constantly taking the reviews regarding the food which was a positive thing to watch. Also they are coming up with their new outlet near Lords more(opposite to Momo I am). So all in all just be here to experience some fine classic indian dishes with a modern twist. Happy Eating!!

A fact that will grab your attention is that they don't charge GST!

The Feast Street in short, is a very new and petite establishment which packs enough firepower to overthrow the denizens of Kolkata's Mughal and North Indian Empire. 

It was an absolute joy for me to visit this establishment with my friends and we all had a very gala time during our visit.

Getting there:

The Feast Street is located on Purna Das Road exactly diagonal to the Azad Hind Dhaba at Hindustan Park. For me, it was a brisk 5 min walk from Golpark while taking the lane beside the Petrol Pump.

First Impressions:

The Feast Street is a very petite establishment capable of seating around 20 odd people at a time which is why it's a good idea to either visit this place just ahead of lunch/dinner rush or to call and reserve a seat beforehand. Otherwise, you'll probably have to wait outside for an hour like me! (Though trust me on this, the experience inside is well worth the wait!)

Inside, there's a very modern vibe going on with framed posters and graffiti on the wall along with very trendy lights on the ceiling to put you in a Cafe kind of vibe. The owners are very warm and welcoming but also are very accommodating and apologetic if you face any unnecessary delay while getting your seat or otherwise. It was their behavior which was the ice breaker for me to know that I would like this place.

What we had ordered:

My eating troupe is usually me and two other people both of whom I've personally known for over two decades and are well known in my circle to heavyweights when it comes to sampling an entire menu if need be. Since we had stepped in to have lunch, we ordered a couple of things from the menu namely:

#1 Lasooni Kesar Malai Tikka 

#2 Murgh Surgh Angar

#3 Murgh Deg Biriyani

#4 Gosht Deg Biriyani

#5 Butter Chicken Delhi Style

#6 Firni

My experience:

We got our food within 5-10 mins of us ordering and it was served piping hot to us (you could literally see the steam emanating from the Kebabs) which is a big "+" for me especially considering it is such a new establishment.

Now coming to the food that we had ordered, I'll deal with it dish wise and provide my opinion. Right off the bat, I'll just point out something positive common to all dishes. The MEAT. The MEAT is quite literally the hero to every single dish we had. Be it the Kebab, be it my biriyani, the MEAT was the winner. It's soft, juicy, succulent and an absolute joy! I think this is the first time I've ever had this good meat at an establishment which wasn't inside a 5-star hotel.

Coming to the Kebabs, the Kesar Malai Tikka Kebab was an absolute delight. The flavor was spot on and the grilling was the exact right amount. No complaints there. Coming to the Surgh Angar which all of us in unison agreed to be more suited to our palettes than the Malai Kebab due to its slightly spicy and salty mix of flavours was a grilled a bit too much in my opinion since certain portions of the exterior had begun to char but astonishingly the inside was still soft, succulent and juicy which made me forget the tiny bits of charring on these kebabs.

Coming to the two types of Biriyani that we had ordered, I had personally gone for the Gosht while my companions had gone for the Murgh biriyani. According to them, the Murgh biriyani though exquisite in texture was a bit on the saltier side of things which I too personally felt for my Gosht Biriyani which had to be masked with the potato that accompanied it. Other than that, the Murgh biryani, as my companions tell me, was a delight to have. My Gosht Biriyani though was a different story. Though the textures of the biriyani were spot on and the mutton cooked so well that it literally melted in your mouth, it was hit by a major flaw for me which if not rectified, might cause some grave dissatisfaction for those who order it. The flaw I refer to is that, during my entire time gobbling down the entire plate of biriyani, more than thrice I had to pick out very tiny little bits of bone from biriyani rice. Now, this could be due to the fact that the mutton was cooked exquisitely well which led to a separation of the bone and the meat inside the rice but it is a major flaw that needs to be rectified asap or otherwise there would be grave dissatisfaction following this dish. Moving on, with respect to the Delhi Style Butter Chicken, I have just one thing to say. The flavors are exactly spot on. It made me reminisce of the several meals I've shared with friends while in Delhi at several Highway Dhabas and other reputed establishments and it an absolute delight to have. I just have one suggestion though which is that, IF possible, try to add a few rings of melted white butter on top of the gravy to give it a more authentic Delhi wala look and feel to it!

Finally, coming to the Firni, though again the taste was spot on, it is lacking in two areas which require improvement. The first being the fact that the firni which we'd been served hadn't fully set yet. The top portion of the firni had the texture it was supposed to whereas the bottom portion was all yoghurt-y'. Secondly, I felt that the Firni could use a bit more smoothness in terms of texture but other than that, taste wise, it was brilliant.

Price wise, I found the dishes to be very sensibly price and our final bill to be very reasonable (Rs. 1224/- for all the above) and so it is not much of a pocket pinch in comparison to other outlets which serve this cuisine.

In Conclusion:

The Feast Street, though was relatively new joint, has managed to woo me and my taste buds to come back again for a second shot hoping that the wrinkles I found today hopefully iron out by then. The management and staff of this establishment, I felt were very nice and genuine people and that they are doing due justice to this establishment and in such a short time of less than 4 months since opening, they've come a really long way and should be proud of their achievements. It is a worthy competitor to age old establishments such as Azad Hind Dhaba right across the street or even places like Aminia, Arsalan and several others that have been dominating at this particular cuisine of decades. The Feast Street, is a joint you should DEFINITELY try once in my personal opinion because I guarantee you that you'll be leaving that place with a content thought in your mind that you had a great meal today!

In a world dominated by aminia and arsalan to compete with a biriyani that is well priced but less seasoned...is a bit of a gamble..the biriyani offered by the feast street promises to satisfy your hunger and your taste buds pretty well but for the hardcore foodie obsessed with the minute flavour pops of an all time classic..i would recommend sticking to the heavyweights...but if you are looking for some above average biriyani at a reasonable price and a quick hassle free delivery thanks to the zomato helpline as well this os the place to be.

Absolutely bowled over by the food. Had such a delicious biriyani after ages ....The aroma, the perfect rice ,the melt in the mouth mutton, the berishta-aloo and most importantly the quantity was just perfect. 
Also ordered Dal Fry which tasted absolutely brilliant. The aroma was rich and the taste was mind blowing.

Special kudos to the packaging. 

Carry on making such amazing food .
Looking forward to try more of their delicious foods

LOVED IT.
I went there with a friend of mine , we ordered :-
1. Hazar wi murgh tikka 4pieces - They served them on a sizzler plate and it was really tasty. 
2. Laahasoni creamy murgh kebab- THE BEST. I LOVED IT. RECOMMENDED.
3. Cheese Kulcha- they were soft and cheesy and very tasty
4. Reshmi butter masala - Again, the best. 
5. Special gosht biriyani- The quantity was a lot and a lot. I loved their biriyani.Many restaurants serve bones in the name of mutton but they had served actually meat 😇 The biriyani was lightly scented which I love, flavours were perfect.
Also they give a free drink with special biriyani. ❤

One of my favourites now! And really budget a friendly place 😍

Easy to locate, on the Purna Das road, it is a very good restaurant. Prices are quite pocket friendly and might be a clever visit when you are short on some bucks at the tailend of the month. The interior might not be large and spacious but that north indian feel about it is enough to hang out with your buddies. Now when it comes to the food let me tell you this is one of the best at present. For the starters we wished to have pankhai kebab. Unfortunately it was unavailable and we went for bharwan tangri which was awesome. The juicy chickens tested perfect. The laccha rotis were good as well. Butter chicken delhi style had something unique about it which we relished. Gosht deg biriyani was also very good. The mutton was soft and juicy which is generally not the case in other reputed restaurants of the city. If it was just a food review i would have given it a 4.5. But the only reason for giving it a 4 is the waiting time. I hope that the management sees this. Please don't make us wait that long. Anyways all the best to the good brains working in here.

The Feast Street ! Still a hidden gem or a delivery specialist restaurant ! Whatever you call , they serves delicious food . 
I bookmarked this restaurant for a long time , but finally today I got the chance to taste the Feast . Started with Chicken tandoori , till the Sahi tukda their feast didn't disappoint me . I had there Chicken tandoori , chicken doner kebab , luchi mangsho combo , firni and Sahi tukda . 
All of these preparations were excellent , though I found the tandoori little burnt and the doner kebab outstandingly mouthwatering . 
The price is very reasonable . 
I loved the ambience , though you only get to watch Kolkata tv there . 
Service is little slow but overall impression was good . 
So foodies , dig in and a must try doner kebab from The Feast Street.

I have ordered food from this place three times now in the past one week and not once did they disappoint. The food arrives within an hour, piping hot and well packed. And boy does it taste good! 
The stand out dish has to be their Delhi style Butter chicken but the other very similar Butter chanegzi is a winner too with a subtle sourness differentiating the both of them. Also, I kind of took a leap of faith and ordered Pudina rumali roti the first time around and have been ordering the same ever since. It's a combination I never imagined would work but it does. The prices are surprisingly pocket friendly for the quality and quantity they offer and all of them are inclusive of taxes.
One happy feast this.

This one is the newest addition in the city' dine out destination. Convenient location, just opposite to Vicky's Garden at Purna Das Road near Hindustan Park. Easy to be spotted. Great ambience. Amazing hospitality. Simply mouthwatering food. We ordered Chicken Lasooni Malai Tikka which was served like sizzlers. Chicken Tikka wrap in Lebanese style tortilla. Kakori Kebabs, Mutton Biryani and Awadhi dum ka gosht. All dishes were simply superb and fabulous. 
Most striking fact is the price. It's what you see what you pay. No tax extra. Also it's pocket friendly.
Would love to visit again.

Located at Hindustan Park, Gariahat this restaurant is a small food junction with just 5 tables. The ambience is simple with foody paintings on the walls. But if you are looking for delicious food within your budget, you can definitely try out this restaurant. We ordered for Afghani Tangri,Special Chicken Biriyani,Fish Tawa Masala and cold drinks. The Afghani Tangri was damn good.The biriyani came with Burhani which they serve free of cost.The quantity of biriyani was more than enough with two  big chunks of chicken. The fish was also spicy and good. Overall it was a good experience. They also serve Lebanese items. What they can include is some Chinese and Tibetan items. I will definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends.

Extremely friendly staff here who take a proper interest in serving you good food and makes sure you have a good time. 
The prices are totally affordable and food is amazing.
We had Chicken Biryani, Delhi style chicken butter masala and they'll give you complimentary Burhani, which was a spicy curd based drink. 
Moreover, the menu prices are inclusive of taxes.

There were a lot more in the menu which is yet to try
 Hence, visiting again for sure.

This place is simply magnificent. Period. 
The place is a tat bit small, but the décor and food overall compensates for everything. The preparation is lip smacking. I went there with two of my friends. For starters we ordered, Afghani murg, wherein the chicken felt so tender and soft, and with the combination of pudina chatni onions, it was totally lip smacking. For the main course we ordered chicken biriyani and butter chicken(Delhi style). Now, the quantity of the chicken biriyani is mind boggling. It can easily satisfy anyone's appetite. The chicken piece was big as well. Butter chicken was very good as well, nothing so brag about. But it went very well will the biriyani. Customer service was quite satisfactory. They take a bit of time to make the preparations though, and serve them. The staff is well behaved. Except the fact that they play really horrible songs.! 
I am going there for more often from now on. Cheers.

Food quality is good...lots of half plate options. Very much pocket friendly. But the place is not that much spacious. I think they are more concerned about their take-away section, thats why you have to wait long time for your food. It really hurts when you see lots of foods are going out in front of your eyes and then the hungry you waiting at the empty table!

Butter naan 
Burhani
The chicken and naan taste just awesome infact the serving plates also looks good. I dont like the burhani taste i think it would be more better if its taste sweet.
Or else everything is nice and hope to go again and keep it up.

Ordered food from "The Feast Street" and I can safely tell you that this is one of the most pocket friendly restaurants in the area. 
Tried their Biriyani and Afghani chicken. Both of them were really good and even more than value for money. Even got a 10% discount by ordering online. However, I suggest you to cut down the delivery time as it took around an hour to get it delivered to less than a kilometre.
Thank you. See you again guys :)

The newly opened small but nice food joint situated just beside wise owl. 
We personally wanted to order Mutton galawati with lucknow paratha but it wasn't available so we opted for luchi and kosha mangsho. Then we ordered two half plate Murgh deg biriyani and a half plate ghosht deg biriyani. 
The plate of luchi with Kosha mangsho had 4pieces of luchis with 2pieces mutton and aloo. It was really delicious.
The biriyanis were normal and half plate was enough for one. The pieces of chicken and aloo was large. The plate of biriyani was accompanied by a glass of burhani and onion salad. 
We also had tandoori chicken . It was succulent and yummy. 
I would like to visit this place again for the mutton galawati and lucknow paratha.. 
Next time i also want to try their signature dish (Delhi style butter chicken)

P.S. They also have lebanese options.

Went yesterday . I found this place in zomato. I was very excited for this place because I love to visit cafes.  And the best part is they served mughal  and north indian dishes which is one of my favourite cuisine. The decor was really cute and eye-catching.
 The service was very impressive. We had order malai & chicken tikka with dal makhani and murh degi chicken. The tikkas were little under cooked but overall it was nice.. We found this place really happening, pocket friendly, loved to visit second time for sure.

Great place for people specially college going students looking for some great quality, pocket friendly North Indian dishes.

This restaurant is located in Hindusthan park.
All u need to do is get down at Hindusthan park bus stop, walk straight through the lane and take the 2nd left. It is just next to Wise Owl.

Ambience wise, really liked the place. Although this place is small but still there was a warmth in here.

Now, coming to the food.
We ordered:
1) HAZAR-WI-MURGH TIKKA- Well, this is one such dish which is surely gonna make u drool.
The pieces were big, beautifully roasted and the kababs were extremely juicy. Loved every bit of it.😍
Highly recommended!!👍
Then we took
2) GOSHT DEG BIRYANI: It looked quite ordinary with one piece of mutton and potato. They dont have egg with their biryani so we added two eggs ..
Although it looked ordinary, the biryani was DELICIOUS. The mutton was juicy and the rice was extremely well cooked with proper spices. Loved this dish to the core.

Service wise: The waiters were good. The owner was very soft spoken and when he came to know that we have a movie in the next 45 mins, he told the waiter to serve us quick and we got the food pretty fast.
Overall, loved this place in terms of quality of food, service and location and i m surely gonna visit this restaurant again..
Highly recommended!!

This friendship day we visited this new eatery in town, The Feast Street for the first time. It is located just beside Wise Owl and is a cozy joint. It was a Sunday and the place was quite crowded. After waiting for a few minutes they offered us to share a table with two others. We were damn hungry and that sounded fine. After we placed our order a few people cleared and we shifted to another table.
We ordered the Gosht Deg Biriyani which was really nice. The mutton is smaller than typical mutton pieces we find in biriyani but it was soft. Then we had the Butter Chicken Delhi style which I heard was special here. The pieces are large and are not boneless. It is tomato tangy in taste but has enough butter and is rich red in colour. It tasted better with the butter nun. Lastly, the fresh lime soda (sweet) was good. It was not too sweet and tasted refreshing.
The staff was polite and helpful. This place is awesome value for money.

Just came across this restaurant through Zomato, I must say the interior was good with quirky graphitis on the wall. The service was too good. I must specially mention about the host who was very friendly and very eager to suggest us some of their best dishes(and I just loved whatever he suggested). Now coming to the food(the main purpose to visit this place) I ordered a half of Creamy butter tandoori chicken(4 pcs) and lasooni naan, and a half of pankhai kabab. The chicken dishes were so well prepared it almost melted in my mouth. And to top it all its pocket friendly. I will definitely visit this place a few more times to try their other dishes specially their  kebabs.

A quaint little place in purna das road Feast Street is a delightful place offering delectable food. The atmosphere inside reminded me of a college canteen. It's a great joint for youngsters both in feel and pricing as well. We ordered a kebab platter which was delicious and mutton biriyani one plate of which is enough to feed two very hungry mouths! The quality of food is very good and quantity is enough to feed a garrison. Loved the whole experience, also it has a quirky concoction of having awadhi cuisine with rabindrasangeet playing in the background. Staff is very friendly and service is pretty prompt. Only one piece of suggestion - please expand the seating area  because with such a sumptuous spread at such a reasonable rate you are sure to get bombarded by foodies from all around Kolkata very soon.

Ordered from this restaurant and they delivered before time so was very happy with the service. Ordered Hazar-wi-murg tikka kebab, Murg Deg Biryani and the Chicken Reshmi wrap in a Rumali roti. Each and every dish was delicious. The kebabs were soft and juicy while the Biryani was light and quiet tasty. The wrap is a healthy version of Chicken roll and an Indian version of Shwarma roll so win-win for all. Another added bonus is that the price of the dishes are not exorbitant. I am truly looking forward to trying more dishes from their menu.

Went for a lunch with my friend in the afternoon. The place though small and can only accommodate few,the ambience makes up for it. The decor is unique with frames on the wall and lovely wall painting. It's brightened up with all yellow decor. Now coming to service and food- Service is quite good and friendly. Food is tasty enough and pocket friendly. The quantity is worth the price for sure. The best part is the kebabs were served on a sizzler which tasted yum!Though had to wait for the biryani to be served but the environment was quite warm enough to wait!Overall a nice experience and a polite behaviour of the people out there. Thumbs up for the cordiality!👍

Situated at a stone's throw distance from Hindustan Park,this place is surely a culinary treasure for those who love to eat North Indian and Mughlai dishes. It's vibrant ambience with peppy numbers and colourfully decorated walls is sure to lift up your mood for sometime. Then comes the most important point - food . Starter is the first item in our rule book to begin our meal with and so we ordered Sigree Paneer Tikka but it didn't meet the expectation of our tastebud. Next we ordered Rumali roti and Murgh Malai Tikka Masala , the creamy malai and the aroma of the chicken masala created the exact fusion of culinary arts. And last but not the least to make our dine out more memorable we had Shahi Tukda as dessert. Even after having a mouth full of dishes we love to have desserts and the reason is desserts do not necessarily fill our stomach but it fills our heart.

Unable to control my foodie nature due to all the great reviews of this place, I visited this food joint beside Wise Owl cafe with a lot of expectations and was totally satisfied.
I loved the decor and the food. We took Boti kebab, Keema pulao and Dhaniya murgh ( suggested by them) . All the three dishes were amazing and the quantity was huge. Each dish can suffice two people.
One of the graffiti on the wall read "Either pack or Overeat" . I chose to overeat. The Keema Pulao didn't go inside my stomache , it went to my heart. The staff were also very polite.
The only con of this place is it's lack of space but that shouldn't stop people from trying the amazing food that they serve.

Been there for lunch today. Firstly, the ambience was very pleasant. Soft music adds to the charm of the place.
Secondly, coming to foods, we ordered Lasooni Kesar Malai Tikka (6 pcs) for starter, for main course we tried Butter Chicken Delhi Style (boneless 6 pcs.), Butter Tandoori Rotis and Lachha Rotis. When our starter arrived, it was sizzling! And we loved it to bits ❤
Main course was equally delicious.. the Delhi Style Butter Chicken was a first try and it was finger-licking good 😍
What we felt is the prices are quite reasonable in terms of both quality and quantity.. If you are looking for a stomach-full meal within 500 bucks for two, The Feast Street definitely could be among your top choices. Lastly, we wanted to have the sugarless Firni as dessert but was not available. :(
Anyway, their service was great though! And we are looking forward to visiting the restro soon again.. Keep up with the good food and service. 😊

okay I really loved this place...it gave us a memorable friendship day lunch experience..we had to wait for fifteen minutes to get our seats..well a small joint with to 6 tables.nice decor and polite staffs. coming to food
we ordered special Murgh Deg biryani...it tasted very good.not too dry nor too oily..mutton pieces were good..
butter chicken Delhi style was good..chicken was tender but the gravy was lil too tangy..but it tasted good with butter naan
last but not the least ..sweet fresh lime soda..one thing which I loved about it was it's perfect taste..nether too sweet nor too sour..it had the perfect taste and not the limca flavour wch most places serve in the name of fresh lime soda.

ordered lasooni kesar malai tikka and chicken cheese kabab from them. both the items tasted very nice. chicken pieces were big and very soft. however, the price was a bit high as quantity was only 6 pieces per platter.

Great Food! With a good menu and tasty food feast street threatens to knock you off your feet, if only they could deliver the food on time. 
It is extremely disheartening that a restaurant that gives affordable and quality food takes over 2 hours for an order. Serious improvements in operations required if they intend to serve the loyal following that they have already seem to have gotten.

Went there for lunch on Friday and the restaurant was very much crowded. 
The decoration is very peppy but The seating arrangement is very less. Hardly can accommodate  15-16 people at a time. 
We ordered chicken special biriyani, mutton bhuna,  shahi tukra and raabri.  we also got two complementary drink and we chose burhani. 
The biriyani was delicious,  it came with two chicken pieces (one breast and one  leg piece),  two potatoes and one egg. Mutton bhuna was also finger licking good. All the desserts were luscious.
Found nothing to complain about.

An Utopia named The Feast Street.

A small eatery located just beside Wise Owl and opposite to Vicky Gardens(ceremonial house) on Purno Das Rd.

Décor : The interior is simple and quaint with graffiti walls and hanging lamps.

Now the food we ordered :-
Among starters we took Murgh Surgh Angar and Lasooni Malai Tikka. The former is on the spicier side while the latter is mildly flavoured. They arrive on our table in sizzler trays with much theatrics added to it.
Both were equally tasty and extremly delectable. In each plate there were 6 pieces of poultry that was soft juicy and succulent. Now coming to the Main course we ordered 1 spl. and 1 full portion Gosht deg biryani. The spl. one comes with 2 chunks of boti, 2 aloo and an egg that can easily be shared among 2 with good appetite. Biryani was to die for...best we had in long time. It was non-oily, full of flavours, perfectly cooked rice with big boti pieces. Now comes the dessert to end this beautiful meal. We had firni which was yummy!! Not over the top sweetened which I liked most. 
The food available here are reasonably priced without compromising the quality as well as quantity. From now on for me and my family it's a go- to restaurant whenever we have North- Indian cravings.
Recommended to all..indulge yourself to this happy food joint.

Mind. Blown.
This is at Hindustan Park, beside Wise Owl.
Went there with a few friends, one of them suggested this place. It's a 20-seater restaurant. Average-looking restaurant that every neighborhood has. That's until you taste the food.

There was a bearded man, probably the owner, who suggested what we should order. So that's what we did.
Creamy butter tandoori chicken and creamy Afghani chicken. And rumaali rotis and lasauni naans.
The first one is so good, we had all our rotis and naans with the creamy gravy. And the chicken had no fibre at all. Just smooth, delicious poultry covered in gravy.
And the lasauni naan. Equally good.

They do take some time (around 20mins) to bring the food to your table, but it's totally worth it.

Highly recommended.
I so wish they'd open somewhere in Lake Town or Salt Lake.

So another find using this great app... and to start with,  I dare not put a lesser rating than a full monty for this place... 
It was my 25th birthday and straightaway I had decided to have lunch here. I felt that I could have not made a better decision , right from the moment the first Kababs landed on my plate.
Tucked away inside Punyadas road about a 5 minutes walk from Triangular Park , this tiny outlet run by a charming young woman is ... well... help me with superlatives here. 
The Feast Street is a very little place having a table for 6 , one for 2 and I reckon two for 4 people... but the foodgasmic prowess of the place is in no measures little ... 

Started the deal off with a plate of Murgh Surgh Angar and some Husanbadi Boti kabab... 
Murgh Surgh Angar was suggested to me by the very helpfull and nice guy serving there when I asked for a spicy chicken Kabab...and I cant thank him enough for that..  
Husanbadi Boti kabab... well... I honestly haven't ever tried a better mutton kabab than that ever... yes it was a bit stiff but that much is totally okay when you consider a mutton kabab... 
That done  ... it was time for some oxygen for a Bengali foodie... BIRIYANI I mean. The half plate on the menu was totally "jothesto" for one... 
Honestly ... I would like my readers to treat the following sentence with some caution... 
I have had better biriyani... and that I say having tried biriyani at nearly every good place selling great biriyanis in the city.... please dont get misled by this... i dont mean to say this biriyani is anywhere near bad... this Biriyani is totally one of the best versions of the Kolkata Biriyani I have had ...but yes , I have had better biriyani here in Kolkata... 
But again, honestly ... i cannot think of any other place where i had a better and bigger piece of chicken in the biriyani ...the complimentary Burhani makes the experience a great one at the end ... 
Before leaving I have said to the lady there that it is my birthday and you people have totally made my day... I thoroughly meant that... 

And I have scored myself a discount here... and I wont say how....go visit... find out... there's a special discount going on... a secret one... a hint? Well... you need to talk to the lady there about something very obvious ...for an awesome outlet like this... that's it...wont let out anything more... 

I am definitely coming back for more... and people out here who are looking for a pocket friendly yet awesome Indian food experience... have a look ... 

And going by their Menu, they also sell some Lebanese  stuff... wont say anything about that for now cos I havent tried them ... maybe will add later to this...

The owner of the restaurant suggests dishes himself and all his suggestions were too good... Looking forward to visit this place again.. Though a bit small seating arrangement with only 4-5 tables, but totally worth it.. My friends who are always criticizing food at a restaurant, for the first time they said that "Had a great meal after a long time", after having the food at this place. Keep it up guys(Feast street)..!!!

Been here thrice in the last fortnight.. Easily among the top 3 North Indian cuisine restaurants in Kolkata.. Many unique dishes which you may not find anywhere else in the city.. Delhi style fried Tangdi, Creamy Butter Tandoori Chicken and Butter chicken are my personal favourites.. Excellent food and service.. Lastly, this place is unbelievably pocket friendly for the quality and quantity of food that they serve.. I think this place will be soon forced to serve food in vehicles just like some eateries on Harish Mukherjee Road..

Recently heard about this place and finally visited there yesterday evening.It is just beside Wise Owl Cafe.From outside it looks a small eatery with vibrant wall paintings inside.We ordered Lasooni Kesar Malai Tikka Half as a starter,Murg Deg Biriyani Special as the main courseand Firni as dessert.The Kebabs were juicy,soft and delicious.It melts inside the mouth within few seconds.It was awesome.The quantity of the Biriyani was sufficient more than enough for two peple.What really feels me amazing is that the less amount of oil used by them yet it was really very delicious.The chicken pieces in the Biriyani were also good.Even they gave a 300 ml coke as complimentary with Biriyani which is really admirable.Phirni was mouth watering and it doesn't lag behind any of the above mentioned items.Overall the bill was within Rs 500 which makes my smile even broader.Really had a very good time there.Hope we will be there soon:-)

Okay Now I am in love with this new joint in town. Discovered this place a few days back when I was passing by it by car. Visited this place today for lunch for a me time and I was 100% satisfied. Though the seating arrangement is limited but the decor is mesmerising. Coming to the food. North Indian and Mughlai cuisine at its best. The food quality and quantity is excellent. The prices of each dish are reasonably affordable. The services are quick and polite too.
A must visit for all foodies. Butter chicken masala in delhi style is a must try and also the rabdi.

Last day just visited this newly opened outlet for lunch with my food partner Priyanka Ghosh..At Hindustan Park this is at a very easy to find small outlet just beside Wise Owl cafe... A small home outlet with nice decor..obviously they manage it well.. Next coming to food.. We ordered 
•Lasooni murg tikka kabab
•Delhi style chicken butter masala
• Chicken biryani (full)
They took a little while to serve but which should be mentioned that us taste...that was too good. Kabab was soft.. Biryani was not dry & was not over smelled.. Butter masala was really tasty...they serve a complimentary drink with biryani... 
Overall last day lunch was a yum time.. Must try it. .

Today in a rainy afternoon visited this newly opened restaurant in Hindusthan Park which is situated just beside The Wise Owl cafe. The dining area is quite small but well arranged. We preferred a two seater and got comfortably seated. Our today's lunch menu includes,
*STARTER : Lasooni Murg Malai Tikka
*MAIN COURSE : Delhi style Butter Chicken Along with Full plate Murg Biryani
The food took more than 20 minutes to be served. The Kebab was served as sizzler which was quite innovative. Half plate of kebab contained 4 pieces of soft and succulent chicken which tasted decent. Chutney and onion salad was also served with the kebab. Next coming to the main course, Murg Biryani tasted very good with a decent portion of chicken leg piece served. It's really worth each and every penny. Biryani was not too much dry that I liked a lot. Delhi style chicken was just yummy with full of flavors. The gravy tasted just divine. 😋 They also served us complementary Burhani (a curd based drink).
Overall our experience was very much satisfying. Just one suggestion that their service needed to be more prompt. Menu is inclusive of taxes so it's very much affordable. Definitely coming back.

A rising winner..
This new restaurant near Hindustan park is quite cozy, the space inside is limited but this restaurant stands out with their food and pricing. At very affordable cost tasting such delicacies is nothing but wonderful.
We had chicken and mutton biryani with murgh malai tikka masala. The quantity of the full plate biryani is ample for anyone, whereas the taste was mouth-watering completely. They also served complimentary burhani with the biryani, a digestive drink kinda thing but goes well with biryani. On the other hand, murgh tikka malai masala was completely outstanding, we couldn't stop praising it once we tasted it, it was one of the best Indian side dish I ever had. The food was awesome, staffs were courteous but the restaurant is small and very tightly packed. This place worth a visit. Looking forward to visit the place again and have some kebabs.
P.S.- few days later I ordered food from here, same dishes, same taste, same everything.. Awesome. Moreover they gave me 10% extra discount on home delivery when I mentioned I have reviewed them in zomato. Great people, I guess.
All the prices shown in the menu are GST included. So, just go and Start feast at the feast street.

Really happy to have discovered this lovely restaurant quite recently. I've been here with my friends twice, and ordered online once. 
To start with, the place is quite small but the decor is beautiful. The bright yellow chairs, the wallpapers, wall art and quirky frames and decorative items here and there are quite pleasing to the eyes. The ambience of the place great, not noisy at all with good music playing. 
Now, coming to the food. I've had the Murg Surg Angar which is like a chicken tikka kebab on a bed of sizzling lettuce, accompanied with salad. The chicken was juicy. Not dry at all and spicy and had a depth of tandoori flavours. Even the shredded lettuce/cabbage whatever it was, turned out to be quite enjoyable! Presentation was a 10/10, and the price okay for a starter. 
We had Mutton Biriyani and Chicken Biriyani, which I believe was a Special one with two pieces of meat and aloo. Served with a fresh, crisp onion salad and Bhurrani to cleanse the palate, the biriyani here is absolutely amazing. I am a big fan of biriyani, and the biriyani at The Feast Treat really, really satisfied my taste buds. The rice, aloo, egg all perfect and the meat just falling off the bone. Not too spicy or rich, quite flavoursome and light. We got free coke too!
The Kesari Phirni was just yum. I have got a sweet tooth and I found this a well balanced dessert. I order this a lot. I would love to see some more and varied desserts added to the menu!
On my second visit, I just had the Non Veg Combo. One was almost more than enough for me and my friend. The rice was long grained and fluffy, the two rotis perfect. Every single, I swear, every single side dish and accompaniment in this combo was a delight. The dal, the paneer, the chicken, the two pieces of spicy kebabs- everything was yummy. Just one thing, the preparation of the paneer and the chicken could be a bit different. They were both cooked in a tomato based gravy, more on the sweet side. For Rs. 199/-, the combo is value for money and I look forward to trying the Veg Combo meal next.
Quality and quantity of food is very good. Recommendation worthy!
The place does not have a washroom yet, but a young lady there promised one to be available for customers soon.
Oh, the owners and the staff are such sweet people. They interacted with us, helped us order, gave suggestions, asked us how the food was, etc. They were very courteous and nice to us, and I'm sure, to everyone they are!
I wish The Feast Treat all success for the years to come! Thanks for serving! ❤

Well i wasn't planning to come over here.I was going for wise owl n i didn't get a place so i just saw this outlet just beside wise owl n considered to enter n sitting here i searched it on "zomato" n found that it already has 4.5 rating n trust me being there made me feel that the rating was worth it.

Small but nicely decorated with lights wall frames n arts,its kinda cute..staffs behaved well,good ambience with nice music n most importantly a place which will surely gonna give you positive vibes.I'm saying this cause i felt it,i'm very choosy n usually don't like every place that much the way i felt for this place,i loved being here..

Regarding the food i must say it's too tasty,i mean seriously yummy😋
Here are the ones which i tried:
1. Murgh surgh angar
2. Masala cold drink
3. Rabri(this was awesomest😍)
N i took one dish for home which was either 'creamy afghani chicken' or 'creamy butter tandoori chicken' which was yummy as well😃

I'm surely gonna come again to try out the other dishes cause i genuinely liked this place and it touched my heart,i'm more than satisfied.
Highly recommended 😃

When our stomach is obsessed to crave something different we headed to this place. We were in gariahat market for shopping. This outlet is less than a km distance from the market place. So Google map is our helper to reach this destination. We reached in poorna chandra road and it is in front of us. Soon we entered into this place the ambience is catchy. It is full of graffities. We ordered food without  making any delay.  We ordered lasooni Kesar Malai tikka and bharwan tangri. Can't explain here the feelings when it comes in to our table on a wooden plate. The taste is different for the lasooni tikka. Excellent! In main course we had butter chicken Delhi style and mutton bhoona with lachha roti. The chicken was again the champ aside mutton. We offered Sahi tookda and furniture in desert. Sahi tookda is  different on its own. Love to visit this place again.

Another new entrant in the already booming food scene in Kolkata, it is tucked away in a by-lane in Hindusthan Park just beside Wise Owl.
The birthday of a friend seemed a perfect excuse to pay a visit to the quaint and quirky restaurant.The place boasts of 4-5 tables with a total seating capacity of around 12-15.
Specializing in Mughlai we tried the Gosht Deg Biryani along with a full plate of chicken bharta.
Gosht Deg Biryani: Beautiful long fragrant rice with a piece of aloo and perfectly cooked succulent mutton pieces was an instant hit.Not overflowing with oil even health conscious people may gorge on it without any guilt( well to be honest a little amount guilt may be!!!)
Chicken Bharta: Flavorful chicken pieces with beautiful gravy topped with slices of boiled eggs complemented the biryani beautifully.
t
To top it all of a small glass of burhani was complementary which helped cleanse the plate.
The presentation of the dishes were very good though the service is a bit on the slower side but the quality of the food kind of makes up for it.
Another important thing is that they have not yet started applying the gst to the items which is a huge boon for perpetual broke people like us :P 
The friendly staff the beautiful decor and quality of food makes it a highly recommended place to drop in and enjoy!!!!

Today had my best Indian food ever in Kolkata :)
Finally after much await arrived at Kolkata and went straight to the restaurant..
The owner is courteous and friendly ..
The staff are equally courteous and advice giving in the choice of food..

So finally I tasted their Lasooni Kesar Malai tikka   with butter naan and their famous "Creamy butter tandoori chicken " and also "Butter chicken Delhi style "  and I must say each item was brilliant especially the kebab  and butter chicken..
 The butter chicken was equally tasty and reminded me of my Delhi stay :)

Last but not least the "Furni" which I can happily endorse as the best in Kolkata :)

Counting the days for my next visit in Kolkata :)

This was on my wishlist for quite sometime so when my friend hopped in from banglalore we went there. I liked the location the ambience and ofcourse the food. We had ordered mutton biriyani,  bhuna mutton, laccha roti, creamy tandoori chicken and for deserts sahi tukda. The mutton of both biriyani and bhuna mutton was tender the biriyani had the perfect spices and was not greasy the tandoori chicken was awesome too...the sahi tukda had rabdri coating in it and was not too sweet just the perfect  balance.. i was ao impressed by the food quality i ordered food home for a small party later one day and i was impressed with all the kebabs especially chicken cheese kebab ..the staff is quite courteous..do drop in here if you want amazing north indian cuisine with comfortable price

A cozy place with an interesting ambience(a wall full of graffiti) and most important great service, they kept on asking us about their food which i like the most.Now coming to the food i must say i WAS not a briyani fan but "the feast street" made me fall in love with their mutton briyani its very very light and damn tasty, if you are dessert person like me then u must, must n MUST try the firni its simply heavenly.
We also had  Laccha roti, Mutton bhunaa, Butter chicken Delhi style and Creamy tandoori chicken they were just yummmyyyyyyyyyylicious.
In short "the feast street" meets my expectation and surely i will pay a next visit soon :)

Thinking of this place since it's birth. My first visit it was great and I am overwhelmed with the taste of Hazarwi kebab. It's delicious. Ordered Murgh deg biriyani which made its pair with burhani. You know what jotting down the taste is a kind of torture to the memory of taste buds. After so long I had tasted a perfect blend of spices in biriyani. Last but not the least when I was full still encrypted a little space for Shahi tukra which is worth mentioning. Waiting to taste more of the mouth watering items soon.

I live very close to this restaurant. The first time I ordered food from this restaurant I was extremely delighted as the quantity of the food was perfect the food was tasty and they also gave us a mug to celebrate 100 days of feasting. since the experience was good I ordered a second time. In our order we asked for 2 plates of chicken kasa four romali rotis and 2 parathas the bill was fine they charged 5 bucks for packaging. but when the food arrived we were shocked to see that the chicken kasa had four small peices in one single container with barely any chicken in it.They packed 2 full plates of chicken kasa in a single container and 2 full plates contain 4 tiny pieces of chicken.This was ridiculous I checked the bill again to see if we ordered two plates of chicken kasa for the both of us or not and the bill said there were two plates. In the menu it says 4 pieces of chicken the entire two plates of chicken wasnt even suffecient for one person let alone two people.. what rubbish is this? is this some kind of a joke you people are playing with your customers? The money we spent was a complete waste with 4 tiny pieces of insufficient food the dinner was a disappointment. While majorly restaurants provide 4-8 piece in a single plate of chicken this restaurant serves 2 tiny pieces of chicken in a single plate. horrible experience if you value your money dont order from this place especially the chicken kasa and if they pull this trick again do take action..

Went to The Feast Street last Saturday.. The restaurant was cozy but the ambience and decor was quite nice.. Comes to the food, we ordered Murgh Surgh Angar as starter.. It was so yum.. Everything was just perfect about the dish.. Then we ordered Rumali Roti, Chicken Bharta and Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala as main course.. The main course was also quite good.. Specially the chicken bharta.. I must suggest this restaurant to all the mughlai lovers to try.. Last but not the least the hospitality of the staffs are also appreciable..

Located just next to Wise Owl, this new place will delight you for sure with the amazingly delicious food at extremely reasonable prices.

We had ordered Mahi-e-Gulfam kebab, Butter Naan, Butter Chicken, Mahi Tikka Makhanwala and Phirni. All the dishes were finger licking.

The point deduction is for the service which can be improved drastically. The management was courteous though.

Recommended!

Hungry for some Mughlai food? This should be your stop if your in the area. This is a new joint, small but cosy. 
My date of visit was on the 19.07.17.
What we ordered:-
Mutton Boti Kebab as starters,Special Mutton Biryani and Murgh Reshmi Butter Masala for main course. 
The Mutton Boti Kebab was fantastic, the meat was well cooked and it melted in your mouth. 
The Mutton Biryani had come with two mutton pieces, a piece of potato and an egg. The rice was more than sufficient for two people. You shouldn't compare it to any big biryani joint, this biryani has a taste of its own. 
The Murgh Reshmi Butter Masala was a let down, I didn't like it much, the gravy was too thick for my liking. 
What I loved was the warm welcome of the owners they make sure that your comfortable, the complimentary Burhani accompanying the biryani and the Hindi music which was playing in the background. 
They should improve the mains side dishes, the service should be prompt. All in all this place is recommended.

I am absolutely in love with this place.
I went there on a Sunday evening.
A very pretty place with an accommodation of 15-20 people.
The interior is very cute with graphitti on the walls.
They have a huge variety of menu. We had a doner kebab roll with mayonese, pudina rumali roti and chicken butter masala. They also provided burhani as complementary. 
The food was absolutely amazing. And the owner was very attentive and helpful. 
Pan masala at the end was something new and lovable. 
Pocket pinch-300 for 2 of us.

I came to this place for lunch on a Monday as suggested by a friend. I was famished & wanted to eat something filling. So I ordered for Luchi & Kosha Mangsho and Burhani to wash it down. I had to wait for sometime to get the food. But the wait was totally worth it. I'm a working exec & eat a lot outside, especially lunch. I can safely say that this was the best luchi & mangsho combo I have had in Kolkata. The mutton was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. It was rich but not oily or heavy. The Burhani was as close to authentic as you can imagine. I give this place 'a must visit' 4.5-Star. I would've liked the elbow room to be a little more. But as long as they serve me delicious food, I'm not complaining. Keep it up. I'm surely coming back again!

Let's just get it straight at the outset: Feast Street is probably the most delicious stretch of road in this city. Their Biriyani melts in mouth as quickly as their kebabs. Their hospitality is as delightful as their Chanps. As a certified glutton, I felt I had all the Mughlai dishes covered. But a walk down Feast Street changed by notions drastically. Not only have they given the gluttons like me a sanctum sanctorum, but have added a lot more dishes to salivate about. Dishes that were hitherto unknown to me, have now found a way to my stomach. Coming to the decor, it is, once again, a runaway hit. It's not a dingy, shabby joint, punctuated by a brave and bold fly trying its best to irritate you. The decor of Feast Street beckons you inside, and once they have you in their fold, rest assured that they will increase your appetite for Mughlai food forever. Being a foodie is no easy business. You have to worry so much. Can I eat this without affecting my digestive system, can I gobble without saturating myself towards a particular dish, can I put a hand on my heart and say that I got value  for the money I paid.. and so son. So far as Feast Street is concerned, the answers to all these questions are an emphatic yes! And to taste that yes, all you need to do is visit the most delicious stretch of road in Kolkata: The Feast Street! I am sure the owners of other Biriyani joints of Kolkata are a very worried lot now!

A small space is the first look feel but the innovative graffitis and Kolkata-depicting-wall hangers invite you to this cute eatery.
The Veg Kebab Platter was a delicacy with 4 varieties of Kebabs and the Masala Papad added to a good start.
Biryani and Mixed Raitha were good for main course. The Bhindi Zaiquedar was good too along with Butter Tandoori Roti.
Overall a good place that does not pinch your wallet much but does tickle your taste buds a lot!
P.S: The 0.5 deduction in rating is for the delayed service ;)

After going through the largely positive reviews, ordered Full Gosht Deg Biryani @ Rs 159/=, Chicken Kassa @ Rs 99/= and a Rabri @ Rs 79/=  Total damage, including packing etc, was Rs 342/= (with discount or whatever). Food was delivered before estimated delivery time. Flavorsome and light, no doubt. Now, Full Gosht Deg Biryani was supposed to contain 2 pieces of mutton and 1 potato. Mine had one piece of well cooked mutton, a shred of chicken breast and the usual potato!!

Wonders do not end here. Chicken Kassa was supposed to contain 2 pieces of chicken.. mine had 4. So what went wrong here? To be honest, I was not too keen on the complimentary chicken pieces. Missed the mutton in the biryani, which I was specially looking forward to. The Rabri was OK, no wonder of wonders, as described by some reviewers. No complimentary "burhani"  or whatever to help me with my digestion. 

Will I repeat? Probably not. I like to know I am getting what I am paying for.

We tried out their Murgh Malai Tikka Masala, which was finger-licking good! They also serve complimentary drinks with a plate of Biryani! The interiors are amazingly done!

Its had been a busy day my friends have been planning some new hangout area and enjoy some good piece of food ... One of my friend among us suggested the feast street ...a new one but having some amazing reviews
We soon reach the place around 8:00 pm ..located on 66/2c Purna Das road its a road side Resturant
The ambience is pretty cool with a wall full of graffiti...😉 
We ordered a few items and they were served really quick 
Among the starters we ordered were the lasooni kesar malai tikka ,creamy butter tandoori chicken .. both the items were good in taste, texture and delicious... I specifically like to comment about the Creamy butter tandoori chicken,its  quantitative in amount a full stuff is enough for four peoples....
We also ordered chicken biryani,roomali roti, cheese kulcha,chicken butter masala.. exceptionally good and delicious ..as a critic the chicken butter masala could have been a little better ..
The desert was also good for the first time i had like firni so much..
Thanks feast street for making our day...

The Feast Street ,the name says it all..Me nd my 2 friends had a grand feast at this small joint which located just beside Wise owl..
We ordered Lasuni kesar malai tikka,creamy butter tandoori chicken,roomali roti,cheese kulcha,murgh beg biriyani,chicken butter masala(delhi style) & firni..
Lasuni kesar malai tikka is too soft that within seconds it melts in my mouth nd it is delicious.. but the show stealer is the CREAMY TANDOORI BUTTER CHICKEN,it is too much fantastic i cant explain..its quantity is also humongous that we 3 are tired to complete one full plate(4 pcs)..but as the item is out of the world we finished with hurry..cheese kulcha is good..Biriyani is so light nd tasty nd it is served with complementary burhani which helps in digestion.. In one word biriyani is class apart..next delhi style butter chicken is average..And Last in" kuch muh mitha ho jaye" phase we ordered Phirni..I think the phirni is truly one of the top 3 phirni in whole kolkata nd it is fantabulastic 😊.
The price is very much pocket-friendly..so is the Owner who comes after each nd every item nd take@ the feedback..
We will surely come at this food joint near future..
Thanks for such hospitality 😊

I came upon to this place through Zomato & so decided to visit this place yesterday. It is located beside the Wise Owl cafe and so easy to locate. As we visited and it is a small restaurant, we have to wait outside for 10mins. When we entered I love the ambience of the place. We ordered for Murgh Surgh Angar & Jhinga Mehrunnisha for starters. But unfortunately the tiger prawns were not available & so we ordered Mahi-e-Gulfam(bhetki kabab). Both the kabab were good, soft and juicy.. In the main course we ordered a half plate Murgh deg Biriyani which was served with burhanii which was why quite good.. Also we ordered Lucknowi paratha, masala kulcha with Mutton Shahi Qormaa & masala cold drink. In the deserts we got Shahi Tudka free for promotion. It was just an overloaded of foods with cheap prices.. Itz pocket friendly and perfect  for all those foodies at a reasonable price. Just loved it !!!

This is a new addition of yet another amazing restaurant at Hindustan Park area.
We were wanting to visit this place since a couple of days and finally we made it today.
A perfect place,small yet cosy to have some wonderful sizzler kebabs or biryani on a rainy day.
We ordered for a cheese chicken kebab,Murg deg biryani,Murg Handi Korma,Butter Naan,Masala cold drinks and Phirni.

•Chicken cheese Kebab-4 big pieces of succulent chicken with cheese topped on it melting inside our mouth.It was one alluring kebab we had.Served on a bed of cabbages in sizzler style.Recommended.

•Murg deg biryani-A plate full is sufficient for two.Well cooked and very tasty.

•Murg handi Korma-4 pieces of chicken cooked in creamy white gravy served with eggs.It is an extremely delicious food and gravy tasted very good.Recommended.Goes well with butter naan,like we had.

•Firni-This is very tasty and recommended.

We got burhani as complimentary drink with biryani which went well with it.Also,the masala cold drink was refreshing.
Ambience is nice and service is prompt.
Just the waiters need to be more attentive and clean the table or fill the glasses at regular intervals.
We will surely come back here again to try more of their kebabs.

So I ordered a combo of luchu and mutton kosha from this place today for my lunch.  So my reviewes goes down there: 

1) The delivery was on time. 
2) The food was perfectly packed without any leakage. 
3) The mutton was of good quality and was soft.  However, the gravy was a bit more oily than regular (which didn't affect the taste though). It was not very spicy too!! 
4) Luchi was also soft and didn't get any hard due to the time taken for the delivery.  

Overall,  I liked the food and would give a 4.5 for them. 😊

I liked the place. The food was really tasty (Delhi style), the ambience was cool although too small and cramped. Since they are new, they are bound to make mistakes. They offered a free desert in the form of rabri, which was quite good. I paid the bill without noticing the amount for the first time. The next day I realized that they have charged me for the desert. I could understand that it was by mistake. Later I called them just to inform them about it and they  said that they would refund the amount. Although, I have not received the refund yet (i visited them on a Friday and today is a Tuesday) after giving them one reminder. But its okay. I don't mind. We all make mistakes.

Heard from a friend about the amazing biriyani they serve and even about the concept of half plate biriyani...so ordered once...had ordered for a special gosht deg biriyani,chicken chaap,butter chicken, firni...The mutton was extremely succulent and soft,rewaji mutton,big n soft potatoes full of flavour and the biriyani rice was extremely light n tasty and did not stick to the hand..non oily n non greasy N yummy...Im not a biriyani person atall,but after tasting this biriyani,I have become a fan.The pieces of the butter chicken are definitely worth mentioning n the taste is mind blowing...The chicken chaap was also very light n the piece was really big which was very pleasing to the heart,eyes n even pocket...last but not the least was the phirni...outstanding is not enough to describe it...n to sum up the entire experience, I LOVED IT n reordered...kindly keep up the good work n I am ur permanent customer now on...

Ordered from The Feast Street, Hindusthan Park to have a quick meal! Delivery took around 35 minutes.

I ordered half plate of gosht deg biriyani. Quality & quantity both were good. It wasn't something very delicious. But it was good with respect to its price. (Around 150 including the delivery charge). Moreover there were onions overflowing in their salad, which I really liked! Rating: 3.5/5

It wasn't a bad experience, looking for to try their other items.

Today I ordered mutton rogan josh with masala kulcha. They were average, rogan josh was very oily. Rating: 3.5/5

We chanced into the eatery on a rainy afternoon for lunch. The first thing that caught our attention was the lively decor. The grafitti was lively and represented the culture of bengal pretty well. 
My friend and i decided to try their combos.

The biryani was very light and non oily with a generous portion of chicken
 4.5/5

The bhature was a bit on the oily side but complimented well to the spicy chhole. 3.5/5

The nonveg thali combo had generous amounts of chickeb AND paneer. Definitely 5/5

Overall a splendid experience

I went to Feast Street on someone's recommendation. I was a bit apprehensive initially but they won me over with their food. They serve one of the best Indian Cuisines (excl. Biriyani) in Kolkata. If you are a non-vegitarian, you must pay a visit to The Feast Street.

This place is located just beside The Wise Owl, we had to wait for around 25 mins to get a table, as the place is pretty small, can accommodate 20 odd people only. So one might have to wait for a seat, but the wait was worth it. The owners apologised for the wait, they were very nice and courteous, now comes the main part, the food, each of the items we ordered were very good from starter to deserts, we ordered biryani and with that we got complimentary "burhani" (a digestive drink served with biryani), so all in all it was a good time spent with my family. The prices are also quite reasonable, it won't pinch ur pocket much.

Easy to locate @ Purna Das Road, small yet cozy, very friendly and courteous behaviour. Now coming to the food, we ordered mutton boti kebab, they served it within 10 mins, kebabs were really good, then we ordered garlic butter naan, butter chicken (Delhi style) and mutton biryani, all the items were nice, serving portion is good as well, got a big chunk of rewazi mutton, it was melting in the mouth, damn soft, in desert we had firni, it was creamy, not that sweet, very balanced.
And last thing would like to mention that the prices are really reasonable.
So would give it a 4 star. 👍👍👍👍

A cute eatery around Hindustan park.Nicely decorated and very friendly ambience.It can sat up to 20 people.Service is very warm and our order came extremely fast.We didn't have to wait for long for the food.
Chicken cheese kebab tasted delectable.There were six nicely portioned pieces of chicken morsels,they, were covered with thick cheese layer and were succulent in mouth.The seasoning was good,cheese tasted good and it was a complete melt in mouth affair.loved it!
Creamy butter tandoori chicken was recommended to be ordered with roomali roti.Handsome portions of tandoori chicken dipped in a rich buttery creamy gravy.The taste was out of the world.
Would visit again!

Loved the branding of the place. Only improvement can be done is to reduce the waiting time. Burhani complementary with Biryani is an added bonus.

Cute and cozy decor... Some innovative graffiti across the wall... Now comes to food... Little sceptical before entering but I do want to say that the decision to get into the restaurant was more than good... I relished each and every dish being ordered... I must say that not many restaurants in Kolkata can serve mughlai food than this place... From kalmi kabab to firni all were fantabulous and taste still hangs around... Oh yeah... We tried luchi aloo dum... We ordered this for my daughter and ended up ordering 2 more plates... Just a honest feedback... You need to work a little on the biriyani... Rest kudos for the setup... Keep going good!!!

Situated near wise owl , this quirky little place with amazing graphics will attract everyone ! Serving Indian dishes at very affordable prices this is an amazing place for college goers like us ! Now coming to food we ordered afghani chicken for starter which was juicy and brilliantly done!Next there we ordered chicken and mutton biriyani along with Delhi style butter chicken ,the chicken preparation definitely stole the show. The biriyani was light and full of flavour. Only cons the service is a bit slow. Otherwise this place is recommended. Do visit. :)

Its very hard to find places that impresses you with every aspect. Be it the ambience , music or the food. I went with my friend in search of Shwarmas( Wraps as they call it). While waiting for the food we looked around found the walls decorated with captivating depictions of the food culture of Kolkata. Something that really hits home for the hungry customer and make his wait, worthwhile. 

As for the food, the delicious " Chicken Reshmi wraps" along with the mouth-watering dips, really fill the heart with joy and makes you want to come back again and again.

I tasted it followed by others and we ended up ordering it for all of us too. We ordered almost everything thing from the menu. I won't suggest any specific dish as you can order anything and be assured you will enjoy it...

It rarely happens that you leave a restaurant loving every single dish served...even the Masala Papads...we ordered murgh surgh angar and burrah kebabs for the starter..they were superb..the juicy chicken just melted in the mouth.. the flavour of the succulent mutton pieces was something totally new n different than the usual mutton kebabs dat we come across. The lasooni naan was quite crunchy with the rightful flavour and aroma of garlic.. awadhi dum ki gosth tasted was very light yet flavourful.. n lastly the rabri!!!! A perfect dessert to end this beautiful food experience.. will definitely come back here as the place has set our expectations very high.

Delicious food , no tax, pocket friendly, courteous service . The kebabs are really good .. tender juicy perfectly cooked . Biriyani comes in 3 options half /full and special ... half is sufficient for one person (although no egg). They give complementary burhani with biriyani which is basically pudina raita , in a typical desi glass ... U take a spoon of biriyani n a sip n the tastes awesome together (n individually). Also they have a dessert offer going on n we ordered Shahi tukra. Will visit again !

Wow!!!! No, not mimicking Saif Ali Khan. That was the spontaneous reaction that came to me when the Murgh Surgh Angar arrived at our table on a sizzling plate. Since it was our first time here, we had ordered for a small portion of 4 pieces. What a mind blowing experience it was. The pieces were big, juicy, succulent and very well seasoned. Usually, big pieces tend to be a bit stiff, but not here. They were as soft as they could get.
Next comes the most delectable dish that is the Creamy Butter Tandoori Chicken. It was simply heavenly. The chicken is tossed in a creamy butter sauce after being tandoored. The flavors were extremely delicate and lipsmacking and is most apt to be had with a roomali roti or a nan.
Next we had ordered a small portion of Gosht Deg Biryani. They use Rewaji mutton and believe me, very few restaurants (read the so called biryani restaurants) give mutton pieces which r so well seasoned and so soft. The biryani itself can compete with most of the biryani giants of the city. To top it off, they provide you with a glass of Burhani complimentary with the biryani which compliments the taste of the biryani perfectly.
Finally we had a Firni and a Rabri for dessert. The firni was very well done with bits of pistachio as garnishing. But the Rabri was definitely the better one.
And all of these plus a bottle of Coke at just over 800 bucks ... u won't even feel the pinch.
And our experience got even better with the warmth and care displayed by the owner. They were courteous enough to provide the Rabri complimentary to us since they didn't have a full portion available. Now that's what we call customer service and that's what we expect from all service providers, but sadly, very few actually display these traits.
So, it's full marks to The Feast Street on each and every aspect. Please maintain the same and you would never have an empty house.

2 king size alu-s, 2 best pieces of mutton, one egg- that's how they cater the Feast street-ers with special mutton biriyani. A lot heavy for one, little heavy for 2. To swipe it off you get a small glass of thin raita. I bet this place is going to give hard times to the other biriyani houses in the city. 

They have fabulous meals. Too many good things in one plate. I know you'll be in trouble if you see their menu chart.

But then keep some space in your tummy for Sahi Tukra. You'll forget the world and troubles in just one spoon. 
The fancy ambiance, the courteous nature will give you double joy! Do visit. Have grand feast in Feast Street!

After a long time I'm penning down a review coz I'm bowled over...The food is crafted with THE WORKS...I'm too reluctant to munch on north or mughlai delicacies as its monotonous to my buds.Ambience is cafe like not for the fine dining cravers . Coming to the food which makes more sense we had chicken angara for starters ...succulent ,tender, juicy served on a sizzler so the added smokiness. A glass of chilled Burhani which is complimentary .We ordered creamy butter tandoori chicken ,roomali roti , cheese kulcha and half mutton Biriyani. A special mention the creamy butter tandoori chicken is a melange of tandoori chicken and delhi style cream chicken. ...the result is a fantastic duet .The Biriyani had a big mutton boti tender and the rice flavourful. To finish off this extravagant meal we ordered rabri & phirni. Now Phirni we Kolkatans are accustomed to but the Rabdi was again a show stealer the malai was too good to explain in words . Service was prompt and courteous. A special mention on Customer Service...the owner was very warm and proactive. ...kudos to the team WELL DONE! ! Omg did I mention about the cost. ..a burger joint costs more than this ...four of us had appetizer , mains and dessert with a coke for 800 plus.Need I say more...recommended to all the lovely foodies & not so foodies go ahead and have a great meal.

If you are a gourmand and a avid worshipper of biryani with "THE ALOO" then this place must be your one stop destination...
This place is located just beside wise owl and serves mouth watering north indian dishes that the north indian lovers must not miss out
The tandoori chicken was served like a sizzler. And was extremely succulent and tasty.
The chicken and mutton biryanis are just 
the ones which would welcome you with their rustic aromas and enchant you with their lovely flavours. We were served a complimentary burhani and shahi tukra along with the dishes we had ordered. And 
the biggest plus point is that the prices are a blessing on your broke days. 
Quantity is extremely satisfying as compared to the prices.
Highly recommended 👌

Very nice place.Quite cheap too.
We had creamy afghani chicken and Chicken tandoori for strter.The former was delicious with soft chicken and we had it with a rumali roti.The latter was served in a sizzler type dish which was innovative and tasted great.The biriyani was top class as was mutton dopiaza.That complimentary drink of curd they give with biriyani is quite good too.The lasani nun was the best I felt.Overall a great experience.The staff were very polite and the mananger and his son kept asking if we liked the food which was quite nice.We also made a late addition of egg curry which my mom&dad had and evn that was superb.Ambience staff food was top class.Only thing was the space..a lil bit crampy and thats where the scope of improvement lies.Apparently they r opening a new outlet much bigger than this one(14-20seating only),so I hope that will be perfect.I'll visit again for some lebanese wraps with friends as this is cost friendly and they take exactly the price@that is in the menu card(tax&gst inclusive).So ofc its a must visit and I personally recommend the biriyani and afghani chicken and the lasanis. :)

The best food with good presentation at an affordable price .. we ordered reshmi kabab , Briyani and delhi style butter chicken.. The Kabab was good, soft, tasty.. The Briyani was just perfect .. The Delhi style butter chicken was also tasty, different from normal butter chicken , a must try out dish .. The best part is they welcome you with a complimentary drink.. There is a complimentary naan with every dish you order.. They also serve a drink with Briyani which i forget ..
Thus, this resturant have become one of favourite :)

Never order online because you may never get it ~ I haven't till now even after almost 2 hours of ordering. They called after 1.5 hours to say my phone is switched off. I don't know how that can be true. Proof - here is what Zomato has messaged me: "​I am continuously trying to connect with the restaurant but they are unresponsive meanwhile if you receive your order, please do let us know."

The Feast Street, well what to say! We started off with Kababs. Lasooni Murgh Tikka was just awesome! Then we moved on to the gravy items coupled with rotis and naans! Afghani Chicken and Butter Chicken were out of this world. Keema Nan was heavenly! We finished with Firni and Shahi Tukda which can give any sweet shop a run for its money.

Healthy Food. Open till 12 in the midnight. A big thumbs up from us!

Though TFS has an amazingly cool ambience and heart warming service, the best part about it is the food. The city is already buzzing with food joints that boast of delicious North Indian Food but The Feast Street ensures that it is not all butter and oil and a mindless dose of other ingredients put together to make it tasty, it IS  authentic north Indian food in all its glory with the distinct earthy aroma and the appropriately creamy texture that is made to appeal to your dining aesthetics. 

The Feast Street is a blessing for the people in South Kolkata, who now does not have to travel all the way to Park Circus and beyond to have a plate of sufficiently enticing Biriyani or luscious Kebabs.

Location : From triangular park,cross the road and walk upto the famous raymonds outlet.Take that lane and walk straight for near about 5 minutes unless you find the quirky signboard on your right leading you to your destination.
Ambience : The li'l place is done up in a very quirky way.The quotes on the wall,the use of pop colours add to the feel and how ! The staffs are informative and well behaved.
Food : Coming to the main point,the food.We ordered -
|| Starter ||
Jhinga Mehrunissa : This dish has medium sized tiger prawns caressed in a super yum red moderately spicy marinade and grilled,with a generous sprinkle of chaat masala,served in a sizzler plate on a bed of chopped cabbages along with a coriander-mint chutney and salad.I felt like had it been grilled a bit more,it would have been a complete 10/10.
||Main Course ||
Chicken Deg Biryani : We ordered for half plate and the quantity was almost equal to full plate served at any other eateries.It had an aloo cooked to perfection,a tender chicken leg and a decent amount of rice - just the way I love it.
Egg Deg Biryani : The same as previous just with a boiled egg instead of chicken.
Chicken Tikka Masala : Chicken tikkas emerged in a red smooth flavourful gravy with a balanced tangy and spicy taste that hits the tastebuds on point.
Complementary bhurani drink : A very refreshing drink containing yougurt,roasted jeera powder and a dash of mint.

The PROs :
👍 Pocket Friendly
👍 No Added GST
👍 Decent Quantity
👍 Super Yum Food
👍 Cozy Ambience
👍 Great Playlist (Well,for a music snob like me,this matters,too)
The ONLY CON :
👎 Slow service
P.S - I can't wait to see The Feast Street growing to an extent where people start locating Wise Owl using it's name 'cause it deserves to be famous with literally everything on point. 💙 A huge thanks to team TFS for such a tummytastic experience.

Ordered food from this newly opened restaurant located in Hindusthan park area through food delivery app. I had a strong desire to visit this place soon after seeing some tempting photos and going through some lovely reviews. Though not able to visit but tasted their food which was an awesome experience. We ordered Cheese chicken kebab- tender cheesy chicken almost melted in mouth, such a lovely dish-highly recommended. Then we had tandoori lachha paratha and rumali roti accompanied by Chicken chaap, Murgh reshmi butter masala and Mutton bhuna. The best thing about their breads are, these are soft and the chicken were juicy tender non fibrous. The Chicken preparations were good but best was the mutton bhuna.Brown thick rich gravy with mouth watering aroma and flavour with soft mutton pieces- a real beauty.Full marks to this dish. Highly recommended and will personally visit this place soon.

The hospitality blended with the yummilicious food is what has attracted me out here. If you are at Purna Das Road or near Southern Avenue searching for a place to fill your tummy,hit The Feast Street. The biriyani served with burhani will indeed give you a boost not to diet and if you're ordering a mutton run-e-sikandari just forget about the world,and concentrate on the food. As a whole a compact,homely eatery with a friendly atmosphere.

This place, with a casual outlook is very well suited to "food & adda" with friends. Though a small restaurant, it offers you a varied items on the menu. We had -  Creamy Butter Tandoori Chicken, Pankhai Kebab, Awadhi Dum ka Gosht & Mutton Biryani. The Butter Tandoori was really lipsmacking, I recommend this item. The Biryani also tasted good with a decent quantity and price tag. 3 plates for 4 persons are enough. The mutton piece was small but a good one. Complimentary Burhani with the biryani added to our happiness. The Dum ka Gosht did not impress me that much.

Feast Street is a small eatery located in Purna Das Road just beside the famous Wise Owl coffee shop. It has got seating area of around 14 people with tables for 2 and 4 only. So coming here in larger groups would not be wise. There isn't anything special to mention about the ambience of the place. Now coming to the food, we ordered the following:
1. Chicken Reshmi kebab rumali wrap
2. Mutton biryani
3. Lucknowi paratha
4. Ran e Sikandari
Amongst all these, the biryani was pretty ordinary and not to my liking. But the rest of the foods were spot on . The moistness of this reshmi chicken wrap is the key to its success. The Lucknowi paratha was very soft and not at all oily. It went perfectly well with Ran e Sikandari, an excellent mutton side dish consisting of shredded boneless mutton in medium spicy red gravy. Besides serving good food, their USP lies in being a very economical place. Surely going to come again to try out other delicacies available here.

So i happen to be in Kolkata with my residence at Wise owl. I spot this uniquely designed looking place and get in for dinner. Being low on appetite i just ordered for Chicken donor kebab rolls with humus. Boy oh boy, what a taste. Adding on to that the hospitality by the lady and the two gentlemen out there was fantastic. Trust me guys the food looks 5/5 and by the taste of just these kebabs am sure the other items will also be good. Am definitely visiting this place for the rest of my stay again.

Located just beside wise owl. A small place and yet a perfect place to hangout with friends and family. Now i had tried 4 different dishes in 2 days. I had to come back with my friend to try da different cuisines they offer at dis place.

Now coming to the food, first day i tried

Afghani chicken : the chicken pieces are succulent and had a distinct malai flavour which made by day.

Butter chicken : u have to try dis if u r a first timer out here. Its one of there signature dishes. The spices were really well balanced and lip smacking.

Nan : they offered garlic nan and plain nan which went very well with the gravy items.

Second day i just had chicken reshmi wrap which is a perfect snack for a friday evening. They even given choices between tortilla or rumali roti for the wrap. The special mention is the spicy mayonnaise that they give alongside.

The amount of food is quite enough to come out with a fat tummy but not a slim wallet as the food is quite cheap nd pocket friendly.

Special mention to the people involved who are very courteous and the order was given in an orderly manner and in time.

Will definitely come back for there biriyani which i have heard so much about.

Lipsmacking dishes with affordable price.
You will love this place  
I had ordered 

Cheese Kulcha - this is soo soft with cheese flavor

Fish tawa masala: this was heaven for me.. One of the best Indian dish I have ever tried. Thought it was rich in spices but was balanced in taste with too good manner. Cheese kulcha with this dish was best 😍

Afghani Chicken: This was another good dish from here. Gravy was filled with malai flavor , little bit sweet. But tastes awesome

Mutton Biriyani: not expected that Biriyani would be too good.. Mutton was well cooked.

Pocket friendly place 😎

We especially enjoyed the kebabs of all types, the taste of Biriyani is perfect and no word for THE FIRNI, we highly recommend it. The food was fresh, properly prepared and a great value for the price. From check in to check out, the staff is fantastic.  A very friendly welcoming place to spend an hours only eating...😋

The Feast Street has slowly been gaining the reputation of one of its known quisine. I have been looking for a place to get the best out of my crunchy pocket, and it's quite an experience.
The location of the place is quite easy to give a miss, yes it is right beside the wise owl in Purna Das Road. However, the interiors cater to a person's regular dealings with food starting from the morning tea with the rabri flavoured masala paan to end the day and also to mention the black wall that took my attention.
I started with their Chicken Biryani, and not only the correct moisture but also the overwhelming little oil used drove me to order more.
Not being a die hard fan of fish, I took a leap of faith in ordering Mahi -e - Gulfam( fish kebabs) and it was worth my every second of skepticism. It had five pieces to tighten my pot belly and also too soft and creamy and the green spicy mayo served with dish was actually a cherry on the top.The dish was executed perfectly and the bright colors of the ingredients peeping after the very first cut of the fish was the feast for the eyes as well as for the stomach. It was worth my every penny.
Though, I am yet to discover other mouth savouring dishes in there, till then a happy person with a happy tummy.

A new food joint near deshopriyo park! Thought to give it a try. And that was a favour I did to myself. From Indian to Lebanese every food was on the menu. Ambience is very nice with great graffitis on the wall. I guess its still under construction as drilling machine sound was irritating us. We ordered a mutton biriyani and chicken doner kebab roll. The pita bread was too soft which I loved (unlike the shawarma nation pita bread for which you need strong teeth) and the chicken was soft too. Biriyani smelled nice and tasted nice. I would definitely recommend the place to every foodie to spend a quality time in this joint.

To top all of that the staff is very friendly and the manager is pretty cute! (Is it just me or do all of Kolkata's successful food outlets hire girls for cashiers?)

I ordered over weight from this place. Being a health freak I expect my palak paneer to be prepared with a minimal amount of oil, as you don't need much oil to cook palak paneer. Much to my dismay the dish had a significant layer of oil on top of it. 
I ordered from this place once I saw the pictures of a few dishes online and they all looked appetising to me, but the real deal was a disappointment. I'm sorry guys but this just did not work for me. Maybe the cook was slacking or just pissed off that day, but I surely didn't enjoy what I ordered.

The feast street is located on Purna das road just beside wise owl.
It's a small food joint that serves you good food.
The ambience is good. The staff is courteous too.
We had ordered kasoori murgh malai tikka which tasted excellent.
The chicken biriyani was well cooked and tasted good. They had served burhana as a complimentary drink but I personally didn't like it.
Then we had ordered butter nan and cheese kulcha with chicken bharta, neither of it was upto the mark.
The nan and kulchas were hard and the bharta was not good to taste.
We had got two tandoori rotis free which were disastrous as well.
Then we had ordered phirni which was good enough.
So all's well that ends well. :D
Overall it's a good place but has lot of scope for improvement.
Do give it a visit and do try the biriyani and kababs.

We ordered chicken lebanese, chicken cheese tikka and their mutton and chicken biriyani! The food was great and so was the quality and quantity! They ran out if rabri which we tried to order but the manager was polite enough to make us taste the rabri that was there in stock and didn't charge a penny! One point that they need to work on is the management and timing! They service was a bit on the slower side but as soon as the manager got in we were served nicely! Overall a good experience!

After browsing the entire zomato we decided to hit this place for the dinner. This restaurant is located just beside The Wise Owl cafe which is easy to locate. We went there at around 6PM in the evening and it was not so crowded. The ambiance is pretty nice with dim lights and lovely graffiti images on the wall and makes the joint look vibrant. We settled for chicken reshmi wrap, creamy butter tandoori chicken (for starters), murgh deg biryani (F&H), gosht deg biryani (F) alongwith these we were given burhani as complementary (for main course) and rabri (for desserts). All of the dishes were amazing and was worth spending each buck. Looking forward to visit it again. :) The manager was taking well care of his customers need. Service was satisfactory.

Located in purna das road just beside wise owl this place is very easy to locate. It is a newly opened small eatery with place for 18-20 people at a time.
The decor is excellent and perhaps the best graffiti among all the restaurants in town. The ambience is exquisite with soft romantic Hindi songs playing in the background. Coming to the food we ordered 
1) Anda deg biriyani 
2) Hazar wi murgh tikka (half)
3)Tandoori chicken (half)
4) Chicken doner kebab roll with mayo
All the items were excellent and specially the kebabs were succulent and melted in our mouth. The biriyani was great with less oil in it and so was the tandoori chicken. The staff were extremely courteous and although the service was a tiny bit slow it was made up by the food. The owner even asked us how the food was and we were given a feedback form to fill up. All in all a well spent afternoon. Coming back soon
P.S - prices are tax inclusive

A newly opened cheaper food junction i have found in the hindusthan park area ❤. The place is too small but satisfactory. Ambience was nice.As we went in a rainy evening, we found it almost empty. Next to their service,one word= too good. The owner asked us "how was the food". Food was awesome realy..specialy the karhai chicken and the mutton biriyani.. The foodprice is pocket friendly.. Overall a good experience after my 6th sem exams of B.Tech😂

Last Sunday I went there with my friend just to chill out a little. Ind vs Pak match was on the move and at that highly tempered condition, we were just looking for some tasty evening snacks. We ordered shawarma wraps with a glass of chilled masala cola. First of all, let's just talk about the decor. It was sober and trendy at the same time. Such a food joint with nice ambiance on a calm green streetside will always make you happy. Yeah, though the place is bit small and has accommodation of 20-22 people, it goes perfectly with their theme. Now, I want to say something about the food. The shawarma was very tasty and the presentation was good enough. There are some much drool worthy items on the menu we want to taste, but that time we didn't have that much time and we were not in a mood of having some heavy meal. Yes, but I would definitely want to visit that place once again and this time with a hungry belly. I strongly recommend this place for those guys who seek a sober, decent place for good and pocket-friendly food.

Among the few newly opened joints which serves mouth watering delicacies but point cut for few things.
The house will accommodate few people with graffitis painted in the walls with tacky yellow chairs. We settled for,
🍗Afghani Chicken Kebab: tandoori kebab served in sizzler style which is innovative. Well cooked too.
🥘Murgh Reshmi Butter Masala: not at all typical butter masala dish, it had some punch to it which made it better from the rest. As soon as u put it in the mouth flavour will pop up from every direction. Highly Recommended.
🥞Masala Kulcha: aloo stuffed kulcha sliced in pizza shape went well with the gravy.
Now few cons i noticed, not everything in the menu were available which was a major let down. They should atleast mention properly at what time what will be available. For a new place like this which have opened before 1.5 months they shouldn't give any chance to their visitors to be unsatisfied in order to get them going.
Nevertheless, the stuffs were courteous even the owners approached us too, and this place will rightly fit in your budget since they dont charge any tax.
P.S. There is a discount of 10% for orders between 2-4pm.

It was a Friday and while returning from office we decided to go to wise owl. At the last moment we changed our decision and went to The Feast street. The restaurant is one small room of simple 15 sitting arrangements with quirky graffiti on wall. I loved the concept of a cafe serving finger food as well as meals.He instantly liked the place because he could watch the Sri Lanka -India match. I liked how they instantly served us cold water and the menu card. We chose one combo of kebab roll and masala cold drink and the server suggested one lasooni malai kesar kabab. We really liked the kabab roll that came with chilli and vinegar. The kabab came in a sizzler plate and was soft and tasty and more like malai kabab. It lacked the lasooni and kesar part . Next we ordered tangri kabab. I loved it. The kabab was soft juicy and really good better than the malai one. Our total bill was 467. So i find this place great value for money. The sweet pan masala they served at the end of the meal was superb.

I think they need a bit improvement with the billing process. They tend to forget the complete order, they tend to miss the amount that needs to be returned. I absolutely understand the fact that they are super busy with the order and it is tough with a complete new setup. I am sure they will manage well maintaining the food standard.
Best of luck team. Keep up the good work.

I am really looking forward to try their Biriani and mutton kosha.

A very interesting name and a very suitable location got my attention while going through zomato and gave my visit the same night,  being my wife's bday as well.... these days,  the restaurant in the city have started to stay open till late and this place just strengthen the list which is ever-growing, till 12am....i called since i was supposed to visit pretty late after 11pm and spotted the location post a call to the outlet, it was right beside wise owl on purnadas road.... so whatever i expected was pretty much met at my first glance.... quirky exterior,  decor wit graphities..... some interesting and suitable framework and a small place perfectly utilized.... its more of a modern indian cafe than a proper indian restaurant if i may call it that way.... it was absolutely empty when we reached with few young guys outside who seemed to be the owners friends or the staffs or co-owners or any of these..... coming to the food now since we were very hungry by then,  the menu card again is nicely designed and looked modern with a touch of creativity here and there and a long list of food as you would expect from an indian outlet from kebabs to gravies to breads and rice..... but unfortunately most of the items were unavailable..... now this is a turn off since you don't expect 4 basic items out of 5 requested to be finished when i can sense that the place is yet to be discovered since its about a month old so though i smiled at the owners explanation, i am pretty sure that's not the case... its ok that they probably are stacking up less to ensure zero wastage since they are new.... the funniest part was that the server was clueless about the menu.... he asked the kitchen guys about what's available everytime i ordered something.... he also recommended me a main course in place of a starter which was not available..... trust me it was funny and not annoying since i know they are probably under trained.... i safely ordered a lahsooni kesar malai tikka.... a mutton biriyani.... a bhuna gosht and a butter naan.... now the service was quick since most of these are just to be finished dishes.... the food was good tastewise.... but few feedback.... lahsooni kesar malai tikka doesnt at all justify the big fancy name since neither it has flavor of garlic nor kesar... it was good nevertheless and was served on a sizzler plate.... the biriyani had a good quantity of rice with a very very small piece of mutton,  to the extent we went for a search inside the rice to only fail in our attempt..... it looked extremely dry but not so when we ate it.... the bhuna gosht came with excellent brown gravy which was about a spoon and a half with extremely succulent 2 pieces of small mutton with bones.... and the butter naan was good but pretty thin for a naan.... so my overall suggestion would be to look at the portion size even if that means you price it higher.... otherwise its one area people will complain.... we were served with burhani when our dinner was over,  so a slack in service.... when we asked for desserts,  we were again told that all the desserts are sold for that day..... hmmm.... ok if that is so.... the last shocker was that they dont accept cards... at least till now but boasts the tag of all cards accepted in zomato.... such a pitty that my wife paid for the dinner which i was supposed to treat her on her bday.... lol.... the pocket pinch was about 570 for all these and yes,  no additional taxes at that rate so its extremely pocket friendly..... the tables are small which is suitable for cafes but not for restaurants.... the owner checked about the food a couple of times which shows he cares.... the young guys i mentioned before kept coming in and out of the restaurant with loud laughs and some friendly abuses at each other which was a touch uncomfortable when you are with a lady.... and a couple of them actually started eating inside the restaurant and calculating the days expenses and how much meat they need to order the next day etc.... and it was still 30 mins before close time,  so some unprofessionalism but i guess they will learn with time.... all in all a very pock friendly place which has a bright prospect but really needs to up the ante at quite a few things coz the competition is cut throat these days.... the sooner they learn the tricks of the trade the better for the business.... all the best

The decor and wall art is very quirky, and fun. It's a small place, but looks comfortable. What's best, is the food! I've only been here once, but the taste and presentation of the kebabs, garlic naan, and butter masala was excellent. :) The spiciest of dishes were light on the palate, and the chicken melts in your mouth. Be sure to give thia place a try. :)

Food~ Delicious. Had ordered Egg wrap,
Chicken Tikka Wrap with Masala Coke (Their Rs. 149/- eat treats). It's really reasonable and the quality of the food is not compromised on.
Ambience ~ The decor is quirky. It's not much spacious which hampers the privacy at times but overall 3/5 for ambience.
Service ~ 4/5. Attentive staff and the owner is very welcoming.
Must visit for a delightful budget treats!

Not much description for this particular restaurant, 3 major points for which we walked out within 10mins of walking in:
1. The existing group of customers were simply intolerably loud, even for us to place an order. Being a small place, the noise reverberated annoyingly. Though the restaurant didn't have anything to do with this directly, but the lack of proactiveness to ask the customers to speak a little softly even with our apparent annoyance was what hit me on their part.
2. We were out for a prawn hunt, and prawn was simply not available. Not a dish, that would have still made sense, but zero prawns in any form, so a dismal failure.
3. A sense of being welcomed, the factor that sets apart a new age eatery. 

I'll give 2⭐️ for the decor, & that's the best I can right now.

Feast Street is a new addition to the already busy food scene on Purna Das Road. The ambience can be best described as cosy and informal, but what really scores is the taste and quality of food. To put it simply, it is North Indian Cuisine, Biryani and Kebabs at its best. The Feast Street is poised to give the older and more established joints in the locality a few sleepless nights.

And yes, they serves great biryani, I really liked it because of its flavour, perfectly balanced.
Chicken chaap was good too.
Reasonable price.

This review is purely based on takeaway experience. We ordered murgh malai tikka, mutton biryani and chicken chap. The kebab was perfectly marinated, oozing with flavours. I felt the kebab could have been a little softer but it was delicious anyways. Biryani was amazing. It was very light which and cooked to perfection. Quantity was huge. The chicken chap lacked salt a little but the chicken was soft and juicy. The gravy was light yet flavourful. I would love to try the other items.

You will feel the warmth the way they welcome you. It's so warm and delightful 

I have ordered few of my favorite items which I usually try in other authentic Muglai restaurants. I have a specific taste bud for specific muglai items 

Murgh malai - Tender and juicy - melts in mouth

Lab e sikandari - juiciest with mouth watering taste 

Mutton Biriyani - I try this dish whichever city I go. This item can give a run to any renowned Kolkata based biriyani restaurant. It's great in taste yet so light 

Firni - a must try desert

And the cool graffiti... you can't take your eyes off

A new food joint always attracts me. So I went to have lunch here with my friend. We had Lasooni naan, 2 Tandoori rotis, Afgani chicken(2pcs) and Chicken tikka masala(4pcs). The bill was only 350/-. The food was really tasty, especially the lasooni naan. There was no tax on the food. That's a really nice thing. And the ambience is really vibrant with the colourful wall painting. I would definitely recommend this place.

Well it unapologetically serves street food in its quirky small setting,located next door to the famous cafe, Wise Owl on Purna Das Road. Our experience so far has been more than satisfying. Their kebabs, portion size, authentic biriyanis, availability of bhurani, array of vegetarian food and especially the chole bature is something on the must-try list. New and wannabe, it has the goods to become a multiple cafe at newer food neighbourhoods, should it be able to sustain quality. Their half-plate serves and price points makes it pocket-friendly for students, young office-goers and the older lot who would want smaller portion size without having to pay the distance of a full serve! Less of a sit-and-eat-restaurant, takeWay workd best.

I am disappointed by the management each time somehow. I visited there 3 times every time due to some reason Shahi Tukda isn't available. The seating is not rational and economic.
I ordered a biryani today the chicken was undercooked n bland, I was disgusted by the looks n taste of it..
I really like their gravy items. Murg Malai tikka masala was good.
Since the restro has a lot of hype now, it should be efficient overall.
We ordered:
Murgh Kebab platter.. it had 8 pcs (a misprint on the menu). 2 pcs each of 4 varieties.
Each of the kebabs melted in the mouth. The smoked tandoor flavour perfectly complemented the spices (mild or strong) just like a well prepared kebab should do.
Murgh Shahi korma.. anyone who loves creamy and sweet gravy@ dishes must try this. It was creamy and delicious especially when we had it with the Lahsooni naan..
The decor is quite good for a small space like this..
The only thing that prevented a 5.0 rating was the service. The opening time was 12.. we were entering at 12.30, before we could enter the person there asked us everything is not available n what do we want. It was a very unprofessional gesture. Moreover throughout the entire time we sat there were two men doing billing in front of us.. it is an annoying thing to hear about the amount of 'cheese and mayonnaise' amd what not that they need to buy.
The waiter was quite inexperienced.
But the food bar being set so high.. we hope to give the place another shot.. and expect a better hospitality the next time.

whilst its a challenge to stay differentiated in this forever expanding industry, its pleasant to note that some rise to the occasion and present a delectable mix of ambience and cuisines. 

designed in part like a classic cafe diner and part pub, the wall graffiti at feast street immediately draws attention and is reminiscent of the legendary and iconic cafe mondegar. all staffs are cordial and engaging
i tried what was told was a donut roll with hummus and chicken biryani..the latter was a to-go order which was packed very thoughtfully keeping the chicken pieces separate from rice

time from order to service impressed me a lot. my only suggestion would be to include more items in refreshments

all the best!

It was my parent's 25th marriage anniversary when I planned a surprise for them by inviting my extended family and friends for the gala occasion. I ordered lasooni kesar malai tikka which melted readily in mouth. The mutton biriyani was out of the world and very light. The chicken chap was perfect too! And don't ask about the firni,if you have not tried it, you haven't had the best firni in Kolkata yet!! Oh and the freshness of the salad and dips was appreciated which came as a complementary gesture. The food was delivered promptly and with care by The Feast Street. All my people are super foodies by heart so much that no one could wait for any food photography as such :P zero complains about the platter and a content stomach is happiness :D
I have been to the eatery quite a few times which has an aura of its own. Very much recommended if you are on a North Indian eating spree :)

Awesome Ambiance 
Superb Service
Visited this place twice. When I visit a joint more than once , along with trying new dishes, definitely I order one of the earlier ones(just to see whether they maintain the same quality😉). 
And yes, it's same and awesome .
Murgh Malai which my daughter loves to eat here is so tender and juicy , one must come and experience it!
Chola- Bhatura- it's mind blowing. I bet you won't get this taste of chola anywhere else in Kolkata.
And, how can a bhatura be so less oily?? Hats off 👨‍🍳!!!
Paneer Kebab- Never knew Paneer will taste this good.
Any chicken kebab - too soft and juicy.
Biriyani- I am a die hard fan of another famous restaurant in Kolkata. Frankly, I liked it the same way here. It's so light .
Ambience - aha.. cool graffiti as my sister told. 
Once you come there, you will feel homely and at the same time energetic too. 
Guys and Gals- please do drop in ,otherwise you will be missing an amazing place .
It's pocket friendly too👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Team of Feast Street- Keep rocking and keep growing !!!

They welcome you really well with a warm smile, that's really nice.Food is okey but I must mention Chole bhature is extraordinary .After Dehradun I've had such a good Bhature & Chole dish in Calcutta. So today basically we've ordered Mutton Biriyani ,Butter Chicken & Kadhai Murgh. Price is not that cheap yet the biriyani mutton piece & rice quantity is not good enough .
So you guys must fix this one & Best wishes for the upcoming days . 

Cheers . I'll visit soon for 'Chole Bhature'

The decor is also quite nice and has a view of the street.

Only reason I'm not giving it a full 5 is cuz I didn't have all the other dishes! :)

Located at Purna Das Road this place has a wonderful ambience. Let's come to the food. The sizzler kabab is nothing less than amazing. The chole bature was extremely big the chole was really amazing. We have tried biryani here and trust me the taste was really good and the best part the oil was noticeably less. The best was their lachha kulcha which was made of atta instead of maida. Had so many things but was not at all feeling uncomfortable. 
This place is highly recommended. And yes please try the masala cold drinks which is good and served in an interesting bottle.

Located on Purna Das Road, this is a small sweet place with decent enough options to choose from. The service is decent and the staff behavior courteous. I feel they are a little short of kitchen staff and hence service is a little slow.

Coming to the food, it has regular starters from meat and fish to choose from with a few options for vegetarian. It also has few options for main course with breads and few gravy items. This place also serves biriyani and shwarma. The portion size is small but goes fine at the price point. Decent enough place for a quick eat mostly for snacks and finger food. They have recently started operations and I am hopeful they will increase the options with time. Overall a decent experience.
