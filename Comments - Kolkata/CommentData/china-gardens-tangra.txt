We bengalis like our chinese delicacies, cooked with chillies and herbs. China Gardens, with sumptuous delicacies will satisfy the taste buds of a bengali who thrives on noodles, manchurian, chilli chicken and the list goes on. 
A spacious restaurant with extremely hospitable staff, this culinary hot spot is a must try.

The food is absolutely horrible! I had ordered for a plate of chicken wings. The chicken inside was wholly undercooked and blackish. I couldn't finish it and had to throw it out for fear of falling sick. The two stars are for the staff. They are the only saving grace. In addition to this, the ambience is not family appropriate. There are men creating a ruckus and screaming across the room. A horrible experience, never visiting again.

Located in Tangra this is a complete new world for the Chinese lover. This was my first time visit and I am totally satisfied with my visit. Quite a big spacious resturant with separate smoking zone and serving the best quality Chinese cuisine is something I was missing from a very long time. Me along with my friends went over there on Asthami night. At 12 when we were struggling to find a proper resturant  and most of them closing down ,  China Gardens welcomed us and served us with generously. We ordered Tuborg and along with that some prawn chips.
After we were done with the alcohol part we ordered some mixed fried rice and swezwan chicken to fill our appetite.
Quite satisfied with the food and the way it was served. 
Definitely worth many more visits.

I have had a good experience everytime here. Visited 3 times to be precise. The waiters are good and helpful. The ambience is as usual as any other restaurant in China Town. The food is fine, but not extraordinary. The prices are on the lower side when compared to the other biggies in the area. A nice place; ideal for a group of friends or office folks.

With a casual dining with friends with few pints and very mild pocket pinch, this restaurant is a good choice. 
Though the food is average.
The area in square feet with large sized sofas and chairs are attractive.
You can expect a good service and hospitality.
Recommended, if you are many in numbers and craving to have a good time. 
Happy Fooding.

The rating is not based on food. It's based on the alcohol they provide. They give you the full bottle and you can enjoy it on your own. 
Courteous staffs, quick services. They also have their smoking room where you can lit up your cigarettes.
The food is not that good though. 
Nothing worth mentioning.

Having been out on my birthday, couldn't have wished for a better Chinatown fest. The ambience of the restaurant is very nice. The quality of food is decent. We had a dish called " Dragon Fish " which is worth mentioning. The quantity is also optimum. So if anyone willing to go on a friendly tour or a date, it's not a bad option either with wine and prawn!

Each item prepared with utmost tenderness..Ambience is basic (as i was before in HOT WOK,which is nearby as well) spacious,preparations are decent in quantity and quality,  and most importantly you dont need to roll your wallet at all.

ordered szechuan pepper fish and chilli pepper fish, quite liked that as well.

China Gardens is one of the numerous eateries that you can find splattered over China Town. Situated near the entrance to the locality, opposite to its more illustrious neighbour Beijing, location is the USP of this place. In terms of food or ambience, there is hardly anything to differentiate it from the rest. The preparations are decent in quantity and quality, the interior is easy on the eyes, and the liquor doesn't burn a hole in your wallet. 

We went there last October, on one of the Durga Puja days, and had a go at their chilli chicken, pepper chicken, pepper fish and mixed hakka chowmein. It was moderately crowded, and we were glad to find that their service was quite prompt even during the Puja rush. All in all, a good choice if you're looking for a spot to hang-out with your friends (or if you haven't been able to find a table at Beijing).

China Garden was once a decent restaurant for its food quality and service. Very recently it had developed negative impression on its recipe of food. As it has increased its prices for food and liquor, the food grade and proper supervision in terms of quality standard has degraded.

I had been there last weekend with my family where I came upon very unpleasant taste of Red Peeper Fish which did not have any Red Pepper nor any salt in it. When raised I was told that they will not charge for the said food item as it was a slipup.

Following to it we ordered several other items including Chicken wings, drumsticks, fried rice and Manchurian chicken. The Manchurian chicken was of bitter taste and when complained they immediately replace it but with the same food. 

We immediately raised the concern with the owner but he refused saying that it was ok and hence they will not replace it. 

Now comes the best part. They did not charge for the Manchurian chicken but charged us for the Red Pepper fish by saying they cannot omit both the items as it was perfectly fine. 

So basically it was like you pay but you don’t eat and if you complain they will not charge for it depending on the situation. If you are with your family you have to pay the entire bill even if you did not consume that item. And if you are with your friends then perhaps they will not charge and might give discounts on your check.

Basically there is no such mandate / inspection for any restaurants in China Town in Kolkata even if they do not serve you food up to that grade but yes instead they have the authority to charge you a lot for such pathetic food or services.

Have been dining here since years and the food is good here. Yesterday '16th feb' was my wifes birthday so thought of celebrating it there, but the awful service and the negetive attitude of the staff ruined the evening and the birthday celebration too. Apart from the horrible service there was problem with the food too, having only 2 tables occupied in the whole restaurant the server mixed up the order and served us the wrong food and on an excuse he swiftly blamed the management that there are only 2 servers which leads to shortage of staffs.
There were problems in every moment starting with the AC problem till the overcharged bill with an excess charge of Rs.380 which was later returned.
The most horrible service we have recieved in our whole life experience. Even the street food stalls gives better service than this.
 It seemed like the staff was not happy with his job so its better if the manager or the Head can keep a better person with some basic etiquettes and manners and atleast who can  say a sorry on his mistakes.

Beijing was closed and this was the only open option so came in.. very poorly managed place.. the waiters are all confused and cannot even open a simple bottle.. they have shortage of everything.. prawns are not cleaned properly.. chicken smelled stale.. side dish is served before the course and becomes cool by the time the rest of the food comes in.. 
Overall very poor place.. would suggest none to come in..

One of the popular reasons people flock here is because of their super cheap prices. One portion of noodles, one starters, Prawn Papad, and another Chicken item for main course; couple them all with two to three large bottles of beer and the total cost won't even put a pinch to your pocket. The area is a bit claustrophobic and the service is equally horrible. However, the laid down ambiance kinda makes up for it.

Cheap alcohol with tangy starters define this place. Had been here about more than 20 times, brood over the fact that the main course highly fails to be worth it, and still go over again for the starters and drinks because of their value for money. 
The staffs are not courteous and a bit rude too. However, the sittings are spacious and the ambiance well lit. So, to conclude, I wont recommend it if one comes to have a feel of China Town, but would certainly recommend if you want to have some sips and some chomps at negligible price.

We had hard drinks along with some beers and some tasty starters. In starter we had Chicken wings sauce, Szechuan peeper fish and Butter chili garlic shrimps. Starter was good but not that good as I expected. Yes the restaurant has two section so if some one willing to go out with their family they can go to family section. You can smoke inside and parking option is available. Now coming to price range I will mark it as average. Food quality was average. Service was not so good. Interior ambiance was dull, I didn't like it at all, specially ACs need servicing and they must keep their toilet clean. All total Its an average restaurant and need few improvement.

Very small and simplistic deco and normal ambiance.

Tried Chilli chicken dry as a starter then Fish pakoda. Chilli chicken dry was average but pakoda was crunchy and well cooked.

After that I tried chicken soup which was good.

Then I ordered Chicken Hakka Chow with mushroom chicken.

Experience was good..Staff were efficient and service was fast..

Though not one of the esteemed n well known restaurant in Tangra..but still the place is quite big and serves good quality Chinese. Special mention their butter fried prawn. The fried rice and rice noodles are also good and sumptuous. Went there many times with family and friends.

This was the hub for treat for bdays and other celebrations among our frnds group. The reason being China garden is one of the reasonable place to dine in Tangra and also the food is also quite good. The chicken dishes are the highlight. Service is fast. Enjoy drinks and food at good prices.

My friend took us for a treat in this place, she visited here before and liked it but to me it wasn't up to mark... the ambience is good... we settled and ordered for 4 sweet lime soda.. when we were served with it only one glass had lime in it the others were like only sugar dissolved in the soda and it was too sweet... we called for the waiter to complain about the mistake they brought lime juice in a glass and gave us to mix it ourselves... than we ordered egg meifoon, half plate dragon chicken and half plate Schezwan chicken... the quantity of the food was too much half plate contain 10 chicken pieces. the schezwan chicken was oky had better version of it... the dragon chicken was good though it had pieces of button mushroom.. few pieces of chicken were hard and dry with no taste factor... the meifoon was good but as usual had better version of it... overall it was good... the waiters totally unprofessional and lazy...

On a very disappointing day at China Town this place was somewhat a saving grace.Alcohol here is cheap compared to China town standards,food servings are great and prices are superb.We ordered Pepper Garlic Chicken,The full plate comprised of 16 pieces!!.The food was moderately tasty and also ambience was average.

Now coming to the hospitality they somehow manage to be pathetic.We asked about a smell coming from the table and they just did not pay heed to.
Also we were 5 heads,when for asked for Beer glasses,they just procurred 3 glasses and said that the rest two buddies have to drink out through their water glasses,I mean that was just insane.....

I have to say the food is not the best in Tangra but it is pocket friendly and good for a casual dinner and drinks with friends. I personally like the dry chilli chicken and chicken lollipop. We have experimented some other dishes which were not good so its best to stick to the regular chinese items over here.

Visited here about a month ago. The ambience is average. But I liked the food here. Fish Manchurian among the starters we ordered is among the must have out here. The Golden Fried Prawns are a signature dish of this restaurant. I liked their Lemon Chicken preparation too. They provide a pretty good quantity at a very reasonable price. Will visit again.

An ideal booze den for college students and boozers who hang out after a busy day in office. WARNING: Avoid foods. I don't know what quality they usually serve but our experience was not so great when it comes to food. We ordered finger chips, pepper chicken and crispy chilli baby corn and waited for some 20 minutes. We were first served with finger chips. Potatoes were not properly fried. Period. Stale chicken was used in pepper chicken and it smelt horrible. Crispy chilli baby corn was so-so. Overall, we were utterly disgusted, disappointed and disillusioned, to say the least. As a watering hole, it is quite good. But let's not consider it as a good bar-cum-restaurant.

Visited this place two days ago....must say I have never tasted such bad Chinese food in any restaurant I hv been in tangra. The only good thing about this place is that its cheap and food quantity is good so u can easily share a plate wd another person. Neither d ambience is good nor d stuff....infact d ac stopped working at one point of time and they didnt even switch on d fan!! And less is said about d food, better it is....d chicken had no taste and it was smelly too. I ordered fresh lime soda which was too salty.....d gravy noodles was avg in taste and I could not find any difference in their chilli chicken and dragon chicken. Both were equally below avg in taste. So if u visit china town, u should try to avoid this place unless u r really short in money.

Again I will mention here like I do for all my reviews on restaurants in China Town.
When you think of pure and delicious Chinese cuisine, China Town is the only place you should think of visiting at that very moment. This place serves moderately good dishes with a large amount of food in every dish that they serve. The taste is also purely Chinese. I believe this restaurant has a home-kitchen. The staff here are not so co-operative. The ambiance is also not up to the mark. Overall, a good place for a weekend lunch.

This is one of those few places in Tangra which is ideal for tipplers..Located just opposite to Beijing this place serves cheap booze and only decent enough food to go with your alcohol..However in my opinion this place is not ideal for a family gathering..The food is nothing special here..serves only average Indo-Chinese cuisine at a reasonable rate..the quality and quantity is not at par compared to more popular eateries of China Town..Some of the tastier starters are Butter Chilli Garlic Chicken, Red Pepper Fish..Fried Baby Corn and Mushroom..In the mains you can try their China Gardens Special Chicken/Fish,Thai Garlic Chicken..From my personal experience I advise its better to avoid the Prawns here..not up to the mark..The service is quite good..servers know exactly what tastes well with yuor drinks..They also serve alcohol in bottles bringing down the price per peg for a large group..One biggest flaw is their lack of hygeine..One of friends actually spotted a Worm in his noodles last time we visit..So that is a word of caution..Overall cheque for 4 people comes to Rs.1850/- including food and alcohol..

There is a reason why this place gets 5 out of 5. My favourite in Kolkata when i am out with my best buddies from School. So much memories associated with this place as we used to quite regular here. Prices are slightly on the lower side as per China Town standards. They have a seating area on the ground floor for bachelors and one upstairs for family. Not much to say about the ambiance as it is plain and simple. Mahadev Da (i dont know whether he is still there or not as i haven't been there for a long time) used to be the USP of this place for us. We used to tell him exactly what we want and he used to serve us exactly that irrespective of the fact that it is there on the menu or not. Extremely friendly people were there working as waiters and this is one reason why i used to visit so often. Quality and quantity of food per portion is good and everything that i had till date is very tasty. I would recommend the Chilly Garlic Drums of Heaven which they master at preparing. Truly heavenly . Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken is also one of my favorite out here.

Pros:
1. Delicious food at OK prices. Cheaper than a lot of other places in the vicinity. Quantity ranges from average to good and can vary widely from dish to dish.
Cons:
1. Poor service. A few of the staff can be rude and ask for exorbitant tips. They can also be slow, lackadaisical, inattentive and apathetic.
2. Ambience is also quite poor and the place is frequented by a lot of shady characters. The management is incredibly tolerant of bad behaviour from customers and condones a lot of thuggish antics. They are very unhelpful when asked to respond to such problems. So I would not advise this restaurant for families.
3. The lighting is very dim and you are hardly able to see and appreciate your food well.

An okayish sort of place,had been here a long time ago. Not very spacious but not very congested also. The place is dimly lit...not a very good place for family hangouts. The reason not being the dim lights,but the ambience and people visiting this place. The day we visited this place,we were 2 families planning to have lunch there. Behind us were a group of boys who were talking out so loud and were even giving slangs to each other in a family restaurant like this. The thing really made us uncomfortable. The waiters and manager everyone was present but no1 thought of sticking out their foot and telling them to behave. The most uncomfortable,disgusting and embarrassing lunch of my life! Since we were already seated,we unwillingly ordered our choices and left immedietly after completing our food. No complaints regarding food or service,but ambience forces me to say...not a very good option for families and definitely not a better option than beijing and other restaurants in china town!

A group of us went here for boozing.  We went to the family part. !st of all no one was listening to us. 2-3 times we had to call then the waiter came!!! ambience was ok. a sight dim light. Not bad. 1st we ordered chilli garlic pepper chicken then a red pepper chicken (days special)(asked the waiter whether last dish and this one is same.but he said no.). Both almost tasted almost same! we took two 375 ml bacardi white rum bottle which was 675/- each. Along with that took some bottles of sprite. And they dont give anything complimentary along with the drink. There is a seperate place for smoking. Food items are  a bit highly priced i think.total  was 2430/-. Didnt pay a single tip due to poor services.Nobody listens to you unless you call them atleast 2 times!!

It's a budget friendly restaurant cum bar compared to other tangra restaurants. Vised there several times with my friends but honestly never get disappointed cause their service and food both are good ("Awesome" factor is missing for food but "Nice" is perfect word). The key factor of this restaurant : "alcohol price is low". "crispy chicken", "fried wantons", "prawn balls", "prawn papads" are nice starters and also combine good with drinks. "wangton soup" and "Hot and sour soup" are sober and decent. You can try any noodles, maifoons, chopsuey and chicken and fish gravy items. I would say if you want a budget friendly place to booz, smoke and dine with your friends this is it :)

this is one of the  VALUE FOR money restaurants  in tangra  ....  Food is very very reasonably priced  ....  quantity is good , quality  is also good ,  try their thai  soup & prawn balls  ...  only thing  is  ambience which is average ,  but it more than makes up for it by their service ...  which i must admit is  very good  ...coming  to  drinks ,  it is not very  expensive compared  to other tangra  outlets  ,  infact  had drinks  been cheaper  i would have  given it a perfect 5  , but i guess nowadays except a few bars in  park street  , drinks are very  costly  elsewhere ...  overall a  thumbs up from me
