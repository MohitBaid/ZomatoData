Roomali Roti and Tandoori roti are USP of this shop. Available only in evening everyday. Roti cost are very affordable. You can have veg chop during the winter time.

Very happy to see this place on zomato. It is a fast food centre where I'm eating since my childhood. Very close to my home. Their moglai porota is awsome. Romali roti and tarka is also nice. Their catering service is also good.

PHOTOS WILL BE POSTED  NEXT TIME AS THIS SHOP HAS JUST JOINED ZOMATO, AND IT WAS SUGGESTED BY ME :DWell, I am a daily commuter to this location and have been eating here (Take away) . This shop does have 2-3 seats but its just like a pressure cooker inside, so ambiance suffers. Staff's behavior is good and service is fast as well.This shop earns the most from Rolls, Rumali and Tandoori Roti , Pakoras and Mughlai Parathas. They don't have any menu cards and you need to ask them the prices for each item. They don't have a complete menu either, they make Chilli Chicken , Chowmein but not Fried rice or something, and this shop is old and running successfully. Hygiene cautious people should stay away as the kitchen is dirty.

Coming to the food,Roomali Roti is good and big and affordable  and always available -08/10

Tandoori Roti is also good, but they don't keep much stock, you might get it in the evenings, but not after 8-8:30 generally - 7/10

Chilli Chicken is very good and contains solid chicken with a thin layer of that 'Besan' skin. 9/10

Chowmein is just average and they don't have much sales in it either 5/10

Chicken roll and Egg roll is just good('just' nothing more than that), for me, its not filling. (6/10)

The Pakoras were good previously but now the covering has been made very  thick(7/10)

Mughlai Parathas are really good (8.5/10)

So, this is a good place for quick bites and some delicious fast food( a few of them). The  Hygiene cautious foodies can avoid, unless they want to spoil their habit for the Love of food.

DO FOLLOW ME IF YOU LIKE MY REVIEWS, I WILL POST MY HONEST REVIEWS AND WILL TRY NOT TO DISAPPOINT. BUT AGAIN, DIFFERENT FOODIES HAVE DIFFERENT TASTES, OPINIONS AND EXPERIENCES SO, DO READ MULTIPLE REVIEWS BEFORE COMING UP TO A CONCLUSION, LIKE, IN THIS SHOP, YOU MIGHT JUST BE UNLUCKY TO GET ROTTEN STUFF, OR YOU VISIT A DAY, WHEN THE CHEF MISTAKENLY PUTS A BIT AMOUNT LESS SPICES IN YOUR DISH OR A PINCH OF SALT IN EXCESS/LESS...PHOTOS WILL BE POSTED FROM NEXT TIME AS THIS SHOP HAS JUST JOINED ZOMATO, AND IT WAS SUGGESTED BY ME :D
