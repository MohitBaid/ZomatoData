Kolhapuri is one of my favourite restaurant in Bangalore and I'm really very happy to see in Kolkata. It has different taste compare to all other restaurants of Kolkata. Food is little spicy but taste amazing. I love their mutton dish and biryani. Best thing is that it's not expensive like other restaurant and food is worth of money.

This tastes good! Mmmmmm yummy! What a delicious dish! What a nice chicken! The peas are wonderful!... 

BLECH! What horrible ways to describe food (especially to children who are figuring out their own preferences as well as learning language.) As an adult, it bothers me when someone tells me a food or a dish tastes good. Good to one person may be horrific to another person. I always feel obligated to agree that yes, this food does indeed taste “good” even if I do not particularly care for it. I hate to rain on someone's taste parade. I much prefer it when someone says something like “this dish is pretty spicy which I love.” This language does not corner me into agreeing, dishonestly, that I like something or admitting that I do not like something then feeling bad about it. How you describe food to children is something parents should strive to be more mindful of. “Good” and “bad” and similar phrasing do not tell children much about the food, only that they are supposed to like it or not like it. Good and bad stifle a child's ability to form their own opinion about their taste prefere...

Very Unique taste of all their Meat, Chicken n Biryani dishes. Recommend to parcel the food home than eating at the joint since it's just a Kitchen meant for takeaways.

Kolhapuri’s food is very unique. Their chilly chicken is to die for. Once you start eating their Mutton pulao and mutton curry, you can’t just stop and will go on eating. I just kept on taking more again& again. And surprisingly the food is not heavy on stomach, non greasy and amazingly tasty. Highly recommend. We now have ordered twice for parties at home too. Pocket friendly, superb tasty, unique (guests are surprised to eat it) in this part of country (kolkata), and trust me, all your guests will ask their contact for sure & order.

Had the chicken biriyani and the mutton chops.  Absolutely delicious and unique taste.  It gets quite popular around meal times so I recommend you call ahead and place your order so you won't be disappointed!
