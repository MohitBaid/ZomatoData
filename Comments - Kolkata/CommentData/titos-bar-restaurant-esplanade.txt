I liked the atmosphere but the service is slow. We ordered crispy fried chicken and chicken drumstick. The crispy chicken tossed with thai sause and that's tastes really nice. The chicken drumstick was good. For two people it costs 800 to 1000/- approx with alcohol.

Titos is one of my favorite cheap and best bar in Kolkata. Happy hours is from 4 to 6.30 p.m. Food quality is good. They have live band from 6 P.M.

Well I visited this place ad was severely disappointed as it was not like mentioned in the previous reciews. I had heard that the liqor is dirt and cheap an you can drink like a fish . However this was NOT the case. The drinks were rated like any other bar cum restaurant and the ambience is also not very great.  The food was average and the manager was rude as well. And the actual rates are higher than mentioned on zomato.

This place is quite good for cheap booze and good food and they give you 2:1 offer on every 60ml of drink you take.For starter we ordered crispy chicken and for main course mixed chowmin hakka..They maintain their standard regarding food and the guy who served us food he was smiling and very fun loving.Wished to visit this place again

If you want to booze and you are searching for  a cheap and best bar for that you must visit@ "Titos".
Friendly atmosphere and no smoking area along with a tv where you can see the live matches like Ipl,and ma
And  the happy hours is from 4 to 6.30 p.m.

I was overexcited to visit this place as I had heard they sell booze at unbelievable price and have dancers in the evening. Well I really wanted to see how a dance bar in Kolkata looks like!
They have live band from 6 PM but don't ve high hopes. Anyway if you wanna avoid the live band, you can always choose to sit on the other section o the bar which has the booze counter n is comparatively calm. Do remember, the live band section has extra charges. Although I sat on both the counters and didn't notice much difference but they had made separate bills for me.
This small bar is just situated opposite Raj Bhawan and has a FL SHOP attached as well. The ambience is shady still it's bearable if you r there to gulp gallons o liquor. If you are a lady please don't visit alone do have a trusted male friend to accompany you. About the food, it's considerably good. Egg bhurji n fish finger were my personal fav. Don't try much experimenting with food just prefer sticking to "Chakkhna" type dishes. Didn't see much young people around although it's a heaven for young College people who can drink like fish. So do visit this place and don worry about the surrounding as you can always leave after a peg if you are not comfortable, in that case, the FL SHOP, adjacent to the bar is helpful. ðŸ˜‹

If you are looking for a hell amount of liquir to pour in then Titos is the place for you. One of the cheapest place in Dalhousie area for drinks. Don't go for the ambiance, neither try to experiment with food. Crispy chilli Baby Corn, Fish fry or Fish finger is good to have. 
Don't come with ur girlfriend's. Only meant for pals.
