The Chinese cuisine is good but the place cannot accommodate large group. Mughlai dishes are also fine but not authentic as some nearby options . Go for your daily lunch or dinner but not for celebrating any special occasion.

Food 8/10
Ambience 6/10
Location 7/10

A very known name at Shakuntala park...came across their food almost three years at one of my friend’s place.so since I was visiting the vicinity again thought to taking a bite...wow they cook just the small.. you will die for their tandoori menu... of course people intolerant to spices please take precautions before you dig...which you will😬.Well the North Indian menu is not good.its worth the money and the wait...as it always crowded.

3 of us being there for lunch but I did very big mistake to choose these restaurants.. Coming to food we ordered for vegetable sweet corn soup,tandoori chicken,butter Naan,kadhai paneer and peas pulao. After having soup we got very disappointed with there is no flavor and tasteless then we decided to go for another soup and we ordered for hot and sour soup.. These soup also ruined my lunch... It was to much spicy and worst soup I ever have... Coming to main course paneer was OK but we peas pulao was uncooked...also we found behavior of staff is very rude and not friendly.. Never ever going to these place to ruined my experience....

I have mostly had takeaways from this place - starting from their rolls to Noodles/Fried Rice/Biriyani and necessary accompaniments. The quality of the food is okayish, but the quantity is more than satisfactory.

It is in my nearby locality. Food is good.. Sevice is bakwas. They just don't know how to behave with any person. After ordering 45 minutes they served one item..funny attitude..basically.. Authority should change the waitors . First of all they should know about the manner , then they should be a waitor. Its necessary I think . I've ordered chicken tandoori , chicken biryani, onion raita . These all r too good no doubt.

ordered 1 Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala 1 Chicken Fried Rice & 2 Tandoori Naan through swiggy!

review;
Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala was okish but it was quite sour in taste may be due to vinegar or don't know :/
Chicken Fried Rice average! it was dry so side dish must..
Tandoori Naan bad to average! it was burned!

in total it was an average experience!

1 Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala 1 Chicken Tikka Butter Masala 4 Tandoori Butter Naan & 1 Sprite 600ml

review;
Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala was just awesome!! specifically the gravy it was buttery creamy.....
Chicken Tikka Butter Masala didn't like it much... it was bit spicy...
Tandoori Butter Naan was good!
Sprite 600ml as says ekdum clear hai! 8|

me and my friend given 5* and other two given 4.5*

now the cons....
we had to literally wait more than an hour for seating...
secondly while we were eating there was some verbal fight going on between a customer and the manager..
lastly they put 18% gst on each of the item where the items are already overpriced...

PS they took back the bill also...

so overall my rating will be 2.5*!

Finally thought to pen down the review for this restaurant.Visited quite a few times but could notice a drastic changes over time.The quantity and quality both aren't upto the mark now.We had Chilli chicken , mixed fried rice, American chopsey,Manchurian chicken,Biryani and lots more but now as I've said  its not the same anymore. And that upsets me.

Please don't order parcel food from hot lips, i stay near to the restraunt. Before the service was good but now its very unprofessional. As, i ordered chicken biryani and it took 2 and half hours to get it delivered. My flat is just 5 min walk away from the place. I called them more than 6 times and every time they said... Wait for an hour and keep delaying. So i strictly don't recommend this place....

Ordered mutton biriyani, fish kabab, chicken bharta, and some veg dishes for a party at home. The mutton was tough, and the fish a little too spicy in spite of instructions to the contrary. Fairly reasonably priced but not good at understanding orders. I asked for a 6:30 delivery and received the food an hour late and I live less than half a mile away.

I am surprised with the speed they deliver...It's amazing. It's being a Sunday, at the time of placing the order they said they will take 1.5hrs to deliver and we agreed. Finally the food arrived after 3 hrs and the order was only for biriyani, generally it is readily available.. Ordered the food at 1.30pm and received it at 4.30 pm.
If they knew there is rush..They should not have taken the order.

Been there when we were stuck in a norwester yesterday night.Was not that hungry.so we ordered d pretty basics:tawa lachcha paratha ,butter nun,chicken tikka achari and one plate onion salad. D chicken dish was a bit too salty for my taste (and my salt consumption is already on the heavier side) bt d nun was soft and had plenty of butter on it which made it a hit.the paratha was served hot and crispy.the service was slow.it is a neighbourhood restaurant and we expect more efficient service from them.
Pocket pinch: pocket friendly.

Mutton piece is too small full of bone and bad smell. I am afraid that was not mutton.
Chicken bones are full of blood.
Price taken Rs 1215.

Behala has got innumerable options to eat, if the number of restaurants are taken into consideration. And "Hot Lips" happens to be one of them, which is nothing very special, but yes, a descent option to eat.

In fact, it is more like any other 'me too' restaurant, that almost every locality bears. But the food is descent, and nice, if the taste and quality is taken into consideration.

Hot Lips is a popular fast food joint that serves you great rolls and also makes provision for sitting and enjoying a plate of Chinese or Mughlai food at the comfort of an air conditioned room. Although rolls are a recommendation, if you feel experimental, you may try the food on the menu. If I were you I would order-in, but that is just me. Service is good. Hot Lips has a good set of workers. 
One thing they may want to work on is making the restaurant space look more appealing than it is now.

Want to try from a gamut of cuisines (Chinese / Tandoori / Pan Asian) from the comfort of your home at Behala? Call Hot Lips - a multi cullinary establishment - to satisfy your taste buds. Good food, very good prices; and not too long wait times (they deliver within 45 mins depending on how busy they are). Good selection of rolls from this multi cuisine joint!

Hot Lips is one of those restaurants that what Bongs would call "Baansh bon er sheyal raja" due to absolutely zero competition from other restaurants nearby and also the nearness of quite a few big residential complexes.

They started out quite well with it being both tasty and pocket friendly.. Though they have undoubtedly maintained their consistency in food but their prices soar up every single time an occasion comes knocking at the door.. And not only is the price soaring up but at the same time the quantity is lessening!! Their mughlai menu is quite good.. Chicken Tandoori is very nice.. Also the Boti Kebab is very good.. And their Kulcha is quite soft and the stuffing quite tasty.. I would recommend not bothering about their Chinese menu because its not at all impressive.. The Indian gravies are of quite a high standard which is commendable.. And the Roll counter is a big hit and it is rightfully so.. I would say I enjoy their rolls more than Haji's..

But now i see the counters to be mostly empty- the only one to be blamed is the restaurant itself.
Previously it served food that was good in quality, taste and value for money.
Now the taste has gone down by many notches, quality gone for a toss..not even considering the money factor here.
So sad that a local happening joint has detoriorated after showing promising growth in past couple of years.

The section of menu for different rolls is missing here.The food is good.But it is a bit overpriced compared to other food joints in the locality providing food of the same quality.
The chicken tikka roll is tasty.

This is one of those food joints to go to when you are out of options. Well the quality of the food and the preparations is really very good and the price is not that great. The quality of the food is at par with the prices. The only thing they need improvement is regarding their service and presentability of the delicacies. For example giving salad or ketchup/sauces whenever you order Chinese or any starters. The delivery time is huge and they should ideally let the customers know that there is bottleneck and it would take time for the home delivery instead of making false promises. Overall it's a good joint with decent food and the interior of the restro looks good as I haven't been inside but have ordered here. If you need change of taste you must visit this place.

Hot lips is situated near shakuntala park. Its a very popular resturant in its locality. They offer lots of north indian foods. I tried biryani, chanp, tandoori chicken here. I did not liked biryani and chanp at all. Dalda is used in biryani, the piece of chicken/mutton should be more tender. However, the quantity of rice is adequate. They use turmuric powder in chanp which totally ruin its flavour. Another disappointing thing about them that being a local north indian resturant, they dont serve mughlai paratha which is common in this type of resturants. But I have to say about there tandoori chicken. Its amazing. Real good tandoori chicken is hard to find and their preparation is of top notch. I will give 4.5 star for there tandoori chicken solely. Its a must try for everyone.

Situated near shakuntala park, Hot Lips is actually quite popular in its neighborhood. Yesterday i ordered 2 mutton biriyanis which they delivered to my house. Home delivery is available for orders exceeding ₹ 250 they told me(though it says ₹150 on the menu card). Anyway coming to point, the quality of the biriyani was up to the mark. Nothing extraordinary, but quite palatable all the same. The quantity was decent. The rice was well cooked. The texture, aroma and the taste were satisfactorily good. The potato too was soft and succulent. Perhaps the best thing about the biriyani was that it wasn't greasy at all. So you could devour it without worrying too much. The only issue was the meat...both the packets as it turned out had bony joints without much meat. Apart from that i thought it was quite ok, considering the fact that it was reasonably priced. I would definitely recommend this food joint to you if you live near shakuntala park and if you are in the mood for some mouth watering mughlai food. Cheers!! ☺

Very average restaurant with very average food. Value for money if u want a quick bite at a nominal cost. 
The biriani is pretty edible with lots of rice and "not so good" pieces of chicken.

This is a nice restaurant that also has home delivery facilities close to my home! It has a wide range of cuisine and a dinner for two costs merely 400 bucks.. The food is served in ample amounts and one plate of any item can easily feed two. The flavours are rich in taste and the smell of fried kebabs can attract even a confirmed dyspeptic! Service time is also good with an average wait of 15 minutes. I would strongly recommend their kebabs!

If there was less than one i would be more than happy. I am a big foodie and i visit most of the food joints of behala ie from Sai taka tak, to haji and hatari everything ( ignoring the calories :P ) but i never wrote a review on Zomato, and this is the forst time i am writing one, that too because of a special reason. This shop is in my locality and today ie on 15th of August 2015 i was shocked by this food joint. As Sakuntala park has very few decent outlets for food most of the people depend on this shop, which in a way gives them monopoly. I used to purchase chicken tandoori from their shop ( which has a wrong price in the menu btw)..Today i ordered 2 plates of Mutton Biriyani and one plate of Pepper chicken. I made my order at 4:30 and planned to have my dinner at 10:00. to my surprise the delivery came at 5:15 ( which was way early as i heard). When i opened the packet of Biriyani at night , the rice was giving out smell and was sticking..it was foul and for the first time in life i smelled a biriyani that had the smell of rotten rice. Normally if you keep Biriyani for a day also it does not discharge liquid but to my surprise this was.. for the first time i found biryani that was like this. And readers should know, cheating in price is one thing but delivering food that is hazardous to your body is way more serious. I called up the shop at 10:45 at night who told that they could replace but there was no delivery boy so i have to go to the shop myself. I thought of letting it go but someone had to reply the owners so that they don,t play with customers food quality again. ( Also i was hungry and there was nothing else for dinner for me)As i went to the shop the owner ( a thin guy with semi white hair and black framed glasses ) lashed out at me saying that " a biriyani that is kept in packet for 4 hiurs is bound to get sour and bad) and he behaved extremely rude as if i was the one at fault and my demand for replacement is unjustified. To his comments i told him that i do not need the replacement but they should not play with customers health and safety by slipping them an old biriyani that gets bad if kept in a packet for few hours. They did replace that but shoved me away from the shop saying that they had replaced the biriyani and so i should shut up and leave. I felt very helpless as i am a common man who cannot do much about this but to accept it. They also saiid that they had the whole Sakuntala park as their customer and none of them complained ever and so if i did not buy from them then it does not matter to them. 15th August and this what we Indians do to each other. It was not about the Biriyani, It was about the health risk that these people give to their customers. I am sure they are slipping less quality and bad food in all other plates they serve because that is their mindset.. to make profit at the cost of customers health. Also if you buy a plate of pepper chicken @ rs 160 from them and the same plate @ 200 form Arsalan taratala u will note the difference in quality and quantity. However most of the people of Sakuntala park are helpless due to the lack of good home delivery in this area and they are relied on this service. I am not a competitor or do i have a food joint, but i am just a customer who loves food and i would recommend people not to risk their own health or their families health by visiting such place.. it may effect your system in the long run. And to the shopowners i would beg and request to provide quality food instead of slipping old and rotten to home deliveries.. children have these foods and may fall seriously sick. Rotten Biriyani for the first time in my life..shocked really. Please avoid this place if you care for your health..walk a few meters spend few bucks more but get quality food...This food can really make u sick..and so shall the arrogant customers who boast about being the only shop in Sakuntala Park, Behala and nothing would stop their business.

This place is near my house. So I visited there couple of times. Food was good (not great). I think there pricing is little high in respect of other restaurants near it. But there home delivery system is quite nice.

i started visiting this place long back and its now a few times that i have been to this place. I was here when it opened a couple of years back and had Chilli chicken and paratha and a mixed american chopsuey as well. The chicken was good but i din't like the chopsuey that much as it was a bit salty. The next few times i have been there was just for small take away snacks of rolls. The chicken roll they make is a real good one. So that's something you can try. Its again a small eat house f may be 12 to 15 people.
Overall a medium place and better for take aways than dineins.

I had visited my cousin's in-laws place at sakuntala once, and they ordered simple Chinese from this place, it tasted excellent! juicy chicken, well cooked chowmein! 
again recently i visited my jethu jethis place at ketopol and they again ordered from here! the food was fresh, the rice and chowmein had sufficient amount of chicken and prawn, the chilly chicken was soft, juicy and yumm!! 
never had the opportunity of going there and dining, but would love to! <3

We had a take away from this restaurant recently & after the fiasco this place made, I had to put it up here!
I had been here just once, that happened a long while back. 

The built of this place is small and can be easily categorized under "Small Eateries". The restaurant is small with (I guess) 6 working tables. The place is small, a little bit cramped but works. Dim lighting makes the place more dingy.
I can't comment on the food & the service of that time as I hardly remember that moment.

My friends and I had a get together on Easter Sunday & as it was already getting late, we decided to order in.
We ordered, 1). Peas Pulao,
                      2). Plain Rice (Basmati)
                      3). Prawn Hakka Chowmin
                      4). There was one more variety of Hakka Chowmin, I somehow cannot recollect...[God, my memory, I need to start having almonds]
                      5). Ginger Chicken, &
                      6). Chicken Curry.

Lets start serially,

1). Peas Pulao : They sent, "Paneer Pulao". :) Yes they did.
                           What else do I write about it? As far as I remember, Peas didn't look like white rectangular blocks tasking like blank milk. On top of it, they were so hard, we all were cracking jokes about it as to if we threw it, it would make a deep dent in the wall. That was exactly how hard it was. It wasn't fresh I suppose.

2). Plain Rice (Basmati) : The Basmati rice was uncooked. We all know how    Basmati rice is thin and long. This was neither long, nor bite-able. It was NOT cooked. Now how tough is it to cook rice?

3). Prawn Hakka Chowmin : One of my friend tried this and voila! No complaints. Good score, guys.

4). "Well...you all can shoot me for this!" 

5). Ginger Chicken : They sent "Lemon Chicken". YaY. Point 1, repeat.
                                   How do i review this? Anyway, I liked its taste, particularly the gravy. Well...I like Chinese, so...I liked it.

6). Chicken Curry : Pretty decent. Good gravy, good chicken. No complaints.

I don't know whether to write positive or absolutely negative comments.
They just didn't serve right. 

However, I should tell you, I don't prefer ordered-in food. 
But I just had Plain Rice (Basmati) & Chicken Curry & the rest were all consumed by my friends. So, no partiality done here.

But yaar, ordering-in from this restaurant was very disappointing. This type of bad service, absolutely, not-expected.

The food is good, but if you are not a lover of spicy food, you have to mention this to them, otherwise you are going to have a tough time. Overall the Chinese was very good, but a special mention is that all of you must try it's Nan.

In a cooking reality show some years back,one of the judges mentioned "Keep things simple and tasty. Thats all we want". Hot lips does just that at quite a reasonable price. One of the few places where the biryani is not drenched in dalda or oil and very pleasing to the stomach. Also quantity in this place for every item is tremendous. Rolls and fast food is better than most of the places in Behala. The chinese palate is also quite tasty. Come with almost no expectations and go back with a smile on your face. Sitting in is larger than earlier so should not be a problem.

Among the restaurants in sakuntala or sarsuna Hot lips is the best for their taste in street food. The starters are attractive and plenty in quantity. But after ordering menu's take too much time to serve. Above all this restaurant can take care of your pocket.

Ordered from hot lips today. Was highly disappointed. They took 1hr 20mins do deliver first of all. Secondly I had ordered for a mixed (contains egg prawn chicken lamb ) chowmein and got a chicken chowmein. They refused to replace the order and were only willing to pay the difference. I.e- ₹10. Still having some hopes from the chowmein, I found out it was completely bland. I had ordered chilli chicken, schezuan chicken and a diceel chicken hot garlic. All of them tasted almost the same. The fried rice was okay. I've even tried rolls from here which were decent and their biryani is okay. Not one place I'd order from again.

I have never opted for a dine in. had always take-away.. Now its amzng to find a decent restro came up at Shakuntala. I never expected Biriyani to be flavourful and perfectly greasy. I had requested leg pieces and they have done that. On few occasions, I found the chckn piece in biriyani to b hard. Dont try the mutton biriyani..Muttn is always undercooked. Side orders also wont disappoint. Its a bit on oilier side but palatable.Coming to Chinese orders, there s scope for improvement.
Their take away sevice is prompt. Price is quite cheap.

Realy like the place. Doesnt pinch your pocket very hard. Decent food with generous portions. More of a take away joint than a dining restaurant (not much space).
