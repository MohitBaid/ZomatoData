A unique name is sufficient to attract attention. I frequently pass through this area and was curious to try out their dishes. On this particular occasion we tried out the Chicken Lollipop and Chicken Momos which were excellent. In addition our order consisted of Mixed Fried Rice, Chicken Hakka Chow,Chilli Chicken,Hot Garlic Chicken and Manchurian Chicken. Well, the Noodles and the Rice were decent. The sides were reasonable but could have been better. The proportions of sweetness in all of them was a tad bit too much for my liking. Frankly speaking, it just masked the other important flavours. If they get the proportions of flavours right...the taste will work out to perfection too.
Correction of flaws will ensure a better product with a wider acceptance and I hope that they pay attention.They certainly have the potential.

Hunger took me to The 2nd Wife. Thus, decreed her for one chicken and one egg chicken roll. The partha was well prepared, neither too thick nor thin, easy to digest, however, less amount of chicken pieces were in it. Nevertheless, it  was appetizing enough to kill the craving.

The name is a quite off setting but they surely make up for the food they serve. A local takeaway outlet at jadavpur 8b. Today i availed the services of swiggy to try the following items:-

1. Schezwan chicken momo - 5 well sized heavily stuffed chicken momos were served with schezwan sauce. The momos were fantastic to taste & the stuffing just won my heart. The spicy sauce really went well with the momos. Recommended item!!

2. Fish fry - 1 generous serving of thick basa fillet covered in light outer crust is what you would describe an ideal bangali's fish fry. The price paid for what is served is well worth for it. Kasundi & chopped salad were also provided along with the fry. The fish fry had no useless coating but a flaky basa fillet. Again an item which is recommended from my side!!

3. Chinese combo - This was a bit disappointing to my expectation after having the previous 2 items. Half plate of veg friedrice was served along with 2 pcs of chilli chicken. The rice lacked the typical indo-chinese taste and was rather bland. The chilli chicken also had an issue with the presence of too much soya sauce which total overpowered the chilli chicken's taste. The chilli chicken meat was well made.

Prices are on the lower side. I had a good 1st impression from this so i would gladly try them out once again.

We ordered special chicken biryani,mutton Kassa and chicken tikka butter masala through swiggy. Due to unavailability of special chicken biryani ( I guess) they sent two pack of chicken biryani which is much oily nd average in taste,the chicken piece of biryani made me disappointed,I don't like it at all. The gravy of mutton Kassa nd chick tikka is almost same in look but both are very much tasty. Mutton pieces are very good in taste,well cooked but the chicken pieces are not so good ( I think they r not fresh) overall experience is good. People can visit once.

Name is bit awkward and kind a filthy. Ordered some food from this restaurant by seeing this interesting name and as usual they haven't disappoint me. Though their ordering menu was quite unorganised, still the taste had fill the voids. They don't have seating arrangement so u have only option to order online. We tried some north indian items and they are really good and will treat your mouth with a perfect spicy blend. But items are too much oily.

Truly wonderful food at extremely reasonable prices - even during this festive season. Prompt and polite service, made-to-order dishes, and an adequate amount of salt and spice, which is definitely a bonus for me.
