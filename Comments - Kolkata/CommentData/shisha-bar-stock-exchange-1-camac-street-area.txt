As I had asked for removal of service charge, the bar tenders refused drinks. One of them also told me that since I have refused service charge they would serve me with delay deliberately.

Worst place in terms of service, any time you go they will make you wait for atleast 15 mins before getting a drink as if they are offering it for free,staff is not at all well trained , just there to serve the ones they know, the managers out there too dont know how to behave with the guest , would recommend people to goto Grid instead.

This place was on my bucket list from a very long time. Finally visited this place on Christmas. The place was not so crowded at first. The Ambience is very nice. We ordered some drinks so don't about the food. Probably the best pub till now in Kolkata.

The first thing i would like to say is that if you are a party freak you should atleast once come to this place..Perfect drink..perfect ambience..perfect music..Great place to chill..Have been here numerous times and it never disappoints me..The stock exchange prices are sometimes are really low and you can just enjoy your favourite at a really less price..

One of the oldest pubs in the city, Shisha started off as a proper club back in the time when pub culture wasn't all that in. Time and again, it revamped and finally what we have here is the Bar stock exchange. Being the city's first BSE, Shisha has been catering to all kinds of crowd - be it the party goers or high schoolers looking for booze in reasonable price. This is my go to place when it comes to good drinks with relaxing music. Hence, I keep coming back here over and over again.

My first visit, liked the concept of pricing the booze like the stock exchange. Also nice decor with dim lights, bar stools and a dance floor. Went for a night out with friends, had shisha which was awesome. Also, it was an acoustic night and the guy with the crowd behind him just went on singing hits after hits which really made the mood for the evening. Cool place to hang out with friends and yes do keep ur eyes on the screens to save some bucks on the booze.

But instead I wasn't keen on reciprocating to hatered when I was met with the same upon enquiring about my bill tonight. I was really disappointed by the boderline racist comment don't even feel like reviewing the really crappy service. These people were clearly trying to rip us off, the bar tenders, to be precise.

Commonly known as BSE, its a great place to go when you’re looking to have a night full of dancing & energy with your group. This place is jam packed right from Thursdays to Sundays. 
The food menu is crisp short & to the point & the hookah costs 350 (GST included) which is quite cheap. Its difficult to get seats here on a weekend so prior table reservation is highly recommended.

For the First time went there with my old clg buddies, expected the ambience a lot more good,but anyway the place was good.. Mild music, awesome hookah, dim lights all were fine but the sittings could have been much better, no couches only iron made high bar chairs were there.
The waiters were not attentive at all.
Overall good place you can surely visit there for once.

Situated on the fifth floor the place is one of the best place to spend your weekends. The name as it's suggest has fluctuating rates similar to a stock system. They have a number of options in drinks but that could have been better because some of the common brands we were asking for wasn't available. The food menu you is small but nice. Also, they have an acoustic night on Thursdays which is really nice.

Well... All we did here was dance to our hearts' content and leave, but it seemed like a truly enjoyable place to spend a fun, crazy evening at. The lights are super dim inside and we didn't eat anything, so no idea how the food is. The dance floor has the typical groovy lights... Almost everyone was up and dancing, so we got to sit at the much sought after table which has a wooden swing seat. Appeared to be a happening place, for sure.

Went there to party with my girl gang on a weekend!
A bit too crowded..getting a table here is like winning a lottery but perfect ambiance to let your hair down & party.
You have to wait literally for an eternity to order & get your food & drinks.
We ordered drinks & starters-
Kung pao chicken
Mexican fries
Food tasted really bad.
But we have had hell of a good time & enjoyed A LOT!!

P.S - Keep an eye on your stuffs.. the waiters cleared our table without our knowledge as we went to the dance floor for few minutes & cleared our full glasses of drinks. However they refilled it entirely on complaining to the manager.

Summing up.. I have read so many reviews of Shisha here & have to agree..this IS the go to place to party!

Happy partying 😊

They are like, sorry you need reservations because you don't look good. We have a standard to maintain and only good looking people are allowed. They totally judge you on your looks. If you don't look good, they ask you for reservations. If you've made reservations,they still tell you that no reservations have been made.
 I'm saying this because this happened with me twice and with some friends of mine, thrice. Both times we all wore casuals and shoes. The first time they stopped us, but not the group of girls and boys that entered the building after us. Just because the girls were beautiful and wore dresses and the men were formally dressed. We were looking for some food and drinks also to spend a few hours to chill out but we weren't allowed. I guessed I misunderstood them but to get sure I visited again and the same happened. 

Dear zomato, please update the requirements needed to enter Shisha. Some people are facing rude managers' and a rude lady asking for reservations. I am sorry to say I have had enough, they meant disrespect, I took it seriously.
 I suggest not to go if you do not look good or dress good enough, because however much you do to gain entry and you don't match their expectations, you are never going to see what's inside BSE.

Perfect for nightlife pubs for parties. 
Interior is a huge place with some seating arrangement. But you can have your drinks by seating on the bar counters too.
As you know prices over here fall and rise like Bar stock . So it is. The concept here
There is a big screen showing about the current fall and rise up in the price's and you can order accordingly to that.
Ordered for Sangria as it was on a little lower pricetag. Service was quick.
Have a good friends gang to accompany with yourself. You'll have fun. :)

The Person at the gate is bloody rude, went there with 3 of my friends(stags!) three of our girlfriends waiting inside. The person at gate told we can go inside for 2 hours, we went inside found our girlfriends and asked for couple entry but the lady at gate denied our entry this type of highly unprofessional behave is not expected from places like this, the perosn you keep at your gate doesn't know the H of Hospitality or the P of politeness, surely not visiting again.

Located in Camac Street, this is one of my favorite place to let loose your feet n dance. The rates keep fluctuating from day to day n the place is crowded all days of the week. Love their music, the dj and also love playing jenga every time I visit there. The only issue are the bartenders, who seem to care less and one has to make their way through the crowd and after much nagging is able to buy a drink or food.

The worst place to party... In a club people come from everywhere but these guys say that unknown people's entry is restricted like do you only allow each of your relatives friends and associates? You people ask for entry fee but again you don't allow the person since you don't know them like do you know each n every customer of yours personally??? A very bad experience... Place of other high repute doesn't acts shitty like this at least...never gonna go back

One of the most hotshot place for Kolkata's night life. I visit there once every weekend. I kinda like that place. But sometimes they have like no control over the number of people they let in. It becomes excessively crowded especially on Sundays. If you don't know any of the bartender then you'll literally have to struggle to get your order heard, it gets that crowded.

Seemed like a happening place. Heard so as well. But the crowd wasn't supportive of the rumours(I went on a Friday). The bar menu is good. Though they could improve in management.

I still don't know why this place follows a "no stag" policy on specific days. Lame and immature.

This place is situated in Camac Street. One word for it - perfect. the games, dj, atmosphere, bar , everything is just perfect. The drinks though are a bit in a expensive side, staffs are not that good , u need to shout at top of your voice to order something at the bar. The manager at the door is not at all polite. No crowd management, if u reach after 11 , then u guys will have no place to sit. It is also very over crowdly, the management here is very bad. Total Disappointment.

This was the first time in Kolkata when I decided to hit the Dance Floor. Generally I don't enjoy loud music and party wild crowd. This place just changed my view. 
The evening started with a disappointment when we were unable to find a table. So we decided on sipping beer until we find a place. By the third bottle of beer, I started to enjoy the place! The crowd was fun. Although it was mostly college people, there were times I felt was too old for this place!

The drinks were timely served but I was a little disappointed with the service o finger food. It took them almost 30 min to serve us Fish Fingers. That huge Jenga block was also an attraction as I love that game!

It was a Saturday night nd trust me guys they have a Awesome DJ! They also play customized requests. The ambience is great! I would love to go there again and this time I would prefer a huge group!
I'm sorry there is no such pics that I can upload as it was too dark to take pictures 😂

The person at the reception lied to us while letting us in. When we came out they completely denied everything. Such damn cheaters! Horrible management inside. Such a disorderly place! Pathetic guys! Stop cheating people.

This place is situated in Camac Street. One word for it - perfect. the games, dj, atmosphere, bar , everything is just perfect. The drinks though are a bit in a expensive side, staffs are not that good , u need to shout at top of your voice to order something at the bar. The manager at the door is not at all polite. No crowd management, if u reach after 11 , then u guys will have no place to sit. It is also very over crowdly, the management here is very bad. Total Disappointment.

This was the first time in Kolkata when I decided to hit the Dance Floor. Generally I don't enjoy loud music and party wild crowd. This place just changed my view. 
The evening started with a disappointment when we were unable to find a table. So we decided on sipping beer until we find a place. By the third bottle of beer, I started to enjoy the place! The crowd was fun. Although it was mostly college people, there were times I felt was too old for this place!

The drinks were timely served but I was a little disappointed with the service o finger food. It took them almost 30 min to serve us Fish Fingers. That huge Jenga block was also an attraction as I love that game!

It was a Saturday night nd trust me guys they have a Awesome DJ! They also play customized requests. The ambience is great! I would love to go there again and this time I would prefer a huge group!
I'm sorry there is no such pics that I can upload as it was too dark to take pictures 😂

What is a pub if not for the PUBlic around...

With this exact statement I would recommend must visit for the leg shakers and party movers. A saturday night birthday party visit made it an one of a kind experience never to be forgotten. With crowds going gaga over the bars and people grooving to the music, it was an inexplicable ambience that got created.

Bars were overcrowded on the night with a close to a fight for getting drinks, but it was worth it : we ordered a tandooir veg platter along with chinese dish which was astoundingly lipsmacking. Beers felt a bit diluted along with a vat69. But the smirnoff shots sent us to our very best and we never stopped. Overall a great place to dance your heart out, with great beats and ambience. A must visit for young people and pour their heart out

My recent favourite place in Kolkata!!!
Everything is great about it, just NO complaints. 
We, group of 8, took advantage of the weekend, and just went to dance.. We ordered mostly Vat 69, Long Island Iced Freeze, and a Hookah, french fries, and the rest I don't remember. But whatever it was, it was good. Thankyou for having a place like this. ❤❤❤

One of my favourite hangout spots in the city. The concept of price fluctuating as per demand throws up some unbelievable deals . such as Captain Morgan at Rs.70 and many more ! Good variety of finger snacks as well. The added bonus of live music on Thursday nights makes this place a top draw !

The place is crazy. Nightlife here is good but the problem is with the space. You would keep crashing onto people if its a busy night. And if you're going on weekends or a busy day, make sure you have a reservation done beforehand. Otherwise u would end up having no place to sit. That sucks ryt. 
Personally i dont like places where you would have to stand and have a pint of beer. 😅
service also is not upto the mark.

Incredible Atmosphere.
It's been a long time since I've been longing to be here. Thanks to a dear friend I got a table booking done. Else there was no space here on a packed Saturday night. 
The food quality is not that great, but the music and bar is what gets you going. The DJ was belting out amazing numbers every now and then and we couldn't stop dancing. The concept of stock exchange was another great addition to the electric atmosphere. We were finding good drinks and waiting for the prices to go down 😋😋😋

Sudden plan. Was confusing as there were no signs that it's on the fifth floor of Westside. The staff was courteous enough, should have been more efficient in handling the orders from all sides. Also, they were in no way paying heed to single people, more favored towards regulars or large groups. Food was okay. We ordered some nibbles, and they went well with the alcohol namely LITs, beers and shots. Nice place to hangout with friends as the atmosphere is quite thrilling overall. The DJ plays good music, and from the price point of view, the menu was very confusing, it's reasonable but should have been more clear.

For friendship day, we decided to go clubbing and hit Shisha. The crowd was lively and so was the music. We had to push our way to the bartender in order to get our drinks and pizzas. Overall, it's a fun place to party, drink and dance. It is cost-effective as well. :)

This place is apt for partying and getting tipsy with your friends. The ambience is pretty good. The graffiti on the wall and the high chairs adds to the decor. The prices of the hard drinks keep varying with time, just as in the stock market, as the name suggests. Also their Peri Peri potato wedges tastes amazing with the drinks. The staff is friendly and well mannered, only when the crowd started pouring in, they couldn't manage the orders well. The DJ is awesome and usually it starts from about 8. So if you wanna drink & dance and have a great night out this is the place to head to. P.S. the Friday 69 LIIT offer is a bliss to behold, simply too good to leave. Don't miss out!

Have been here a number of times, located in the most happening place in the city- Camac Street.
The bar is nothing special or worth mentioning.
The food is okayish.
The DJ is good only and I repeat only on Sundays.
Saturdays are a big bore here.
The Thursdays are also good with live music
The crowd is good and healthy.
Drinks are well made except that it makes you feel like a beggar because of the staff.
The service is very very poor.
Only because Kolkata as it is has very few options, this place is recommended.
The quality of food is good but service has to improve magnificently.

Dj started playing tracks post 8.30pm..
Food was average..
If u r a drink addict then u should order ur drink by 6pm to get it at affordable prices..
Ambience was good..
But no place to sit during weekends..

Pros: great dj, great drinks, good food. I'd recommend the platters, the mushroom starters, whereas for drinks there is no honest way to put down recommendations, though I'd still go out on a limb and suggest ordering their long island iced tea and cosmopolitan. Also, the bartenders are really talented and very friendly. They'll be happy to help you out in any way required. Also, it's very reasonably priced. 
Cons: it's usually packed, so be patient while ordering. The music is loud and the acoustics suck, so the music will be too loud making it impossible to have a chat.

Okay been there couple of days back I have a question inside my head it is the same people who own bar stock exchange everywhere Else or it is shisha people who have come up with the idea of bar exchange as in inspired by bar stock exchange ?? Cause form no where it's matching upto the expectations of a person who has visited other bar stock exchange . Okay where to start from the service is slow in terms of food . The place was playing nice Edms but then all of sudden dj changed the whole pitch into something completely different . As a whole I was quite disappointed with the place may be in future I Ll think twice before visiting it

Found the place slightly overrated, probably because it was a Friday night, and it was too crowded. The ambiance is good for a jive, but the dance floor gets cramped. A lot of the beers were there on the menu, despite the fact that they weren't available. We had a thin crust pizza, a chiken platter and fries, all of which was more than decent, given the rush. The place felt understaffed since most of the people were not being attended to. All in all, it's good for a one time visit, preferably at odd hours when you're more likely to be able to get a properly place to sit and dedicated service.

The worst place to party or go for a drink!
It's filled with overrated kids and dopey squeamish moses who doesn't give a shit bout their religion.Entry is an issue as a drink seeker cannot just go in and grab a drink.You need to be overrated for An entry.Washrooms are filthy and you get to see families getting drunk together and puking.
Rather stay home and drink than drink from this shit hole.

The ambience is really nice. Apt for partying. If lucky you will get good drinks at cheep prices. The peri peri potato wedges are really nice to have and jalapeño poppers are to die for.

Had been there recently on a Thursday night. The place was jammed packed. Luckily my friends had saved me a seat or it would have been a disaster. The ambience is perfect for those of you looking to shake your body to the groovy music as well as enjoying drinks. The food menu was not very extensive though. We ordered chilly chicken dry and Ajwaini mahi tikka as well as homemade chips with dips. The dishes were quite good unlike some of the bars I have been to. We had a couple of drinks as well. The place is done up quite well and the service is quite quick. Would definitely visit again.

The place has superb ambience, great dance music, pocket friendly cocktails, LIIT pitcher is a must try. Shisha is very good compared to other places in town. The food is also good, I tried chicken tikka, it was beautifully presented and properly grilled. Whenever I am in town, I make sure to give this place a visit.

Whatta mind blowing place it was..
We didn't Made any prior bookings thinking that it's Thursday so not much of a crowd would be there. But let me tell you..
It was so difficult to grab a table even..IT WAS HEAVILY PACKED.
Somehow we managed to enter and on the top of that requested somebody to share a table 🤣
Live singing was on and the voice of the singer was just fantastic..superb i must say.
Now talking about the order .. it was a task for us to order some drinks🙈.
And at the end we were successful in completing that though 💃🏻.
Our order- LIT PITCHER,kingfisher beer and along with paan kiwi sheesha.
LIT-1250+ taxes
Beer-250+ taxes 
Sheesha-380
Total amount was 1900 but with taxes 2400..
So many taxes.
It was fun to order by shouting at one person for drinks den irritating the waiter for sheesha🤣
I cannot actually explain in words.It was something different only .
The night went super awesome.
We enjoyed hell alot🥃

Been here on a weekday. It was a very silent place. 
I personally did not like the ambiance. 
Because of the other joints which have been opened and are better than this ,the place has lost its charm. 
Alcohol rates change as per demand and they have an app for us to see the rates on our phones. 
I have tried their
 Mixed sauce pasta which is really really nice.
French fries which according to me was very simple and the taste was okay okay.
This place is for drinking basically not for the food. 
You will enjoy the place only if you go on a weekend night. Otherwise it won't give you the kind of vibe.
Over all I would definitely suggest a visit on a weekend.

Shisha-Bar Exchange! Very cool space with a concept of continuously changing prices of drinks like stock exchange.  Nice ambiance and comfy sitting arrangement . Their staffs are well behaved . Loved their taste of music for background .  Variety in Booze and Shisha , also their food is really awesome and mouth watering too.  Price is fairly reasonable.   Would highly recommend  for a casual friend gathering. 

Cheers! Team Shisha-Bar Exchange.

Innovative concept. Prices are displayed like the stock exchange rates. Alcohol is damn cheap. Music played is nice. One can even play games which are pretty interesting. Food quality is good. Overall a nice place to visit.

Pro+Con: a place filled with teenagers, majorly due to the low prices. Love the lit name-tags of the servers.

It's a good place to hang out with friends.Comparatively not that much good as there are so many good even better clubs in Kolkata.
But I must have to say the decor is very good nd it's also very spacious.Platters dominate the sharing menu-kebabs,dips,salads,mezza platter,pita pockets,pizetta spinach mixed capsicum.Asian and thai cuisines​ are also very popular.And regarding beverage the new additions are the iced shots, freezing tequila twister and volcano classic shots.

We visited this restaurant and walked out of the bar within minutes. I would attribute this to the lack of food choice. Apt place for drinking and tortuous concept of ordering your drinks but I believe it is fun. You need to download this shisha app and order your drinks through that.
The price rises or declines with the demand of the drink. So the more crowded the place is the costlier the drinks are.

The funny part was the items that other reviewers put on zomato was also not present in the menu. I did not have a picture of the menu but it was just one slate of items. I enquired the waiter and he said "this is it". We wanted to have some food to binge on at that hour of night.

The place has a nice dance floor though and some really loud music (you a literally hear it outta the bar :P) but it looks a little dingy at night. This is the perfect place to dance and be yourself on the contrary if you want a peaceful night I would suggest you the Factory Outlet on the same floor or the London Pub or Gabbar's just across the street.

The concept of the club is nice. Varying price of drinks and everything. But it's too small. You at times feel clostrophobic.
It is there you can be sure that kolkata has too many people looking for a party than there are places to accommodate them.
Good point, it's not that expensive. You can have a decent party at a reasonable rate.

I would have given minus rating unfortunately I can't... After a long tiring day at work u feel like rejuvenating.. Bar Stock Exchange is not the place.. The guys here ask you to punch their order before 1.. Once done they ask u to leave.. Leave in the worst way possible.. Prosen mondal said that he is not bothered about zomato ratings.. No wonder the ratings so poor disgusting behavior.. We were compelled to finish 10 pegs in half an hour.. They need to check the number of under age teens they let in... Sad to see how adults are treated in this club they say is a massing huge crowd who are under age.. Don't know how they get past the law of the land..

A really cool place for boozing with a stock market pricing and nice interiors.
With demand,price decreases and thats the best part.
We had tequilla shots,beer,sangria and LIT.
For nibbles we took Thai herbed fish and home made chips.
Food was great.
Bartenders are nice and prompt.
On the weekend the dj part is more fun and we had fun dancing though the dance floor is tiny.
Overall its a nice place for hangouts.
Pocket pinch for two will be 2000/-

The place needs no introduction..It is jus renovated with a new concept of stock exchange..
U get drinks basis the popularity and the price that flashes on the screen..
It has an amzing dj with a small dancefloor..but u vl see ppl jus grooving in all the space they get..
It gves u a proper feel of any other rocking club we see on big screens..
Overall the place is a must visit but there is space issue on weekends..u might have to stand or jus get some space against the bar..

The place is dark, and COLD, you will find the similar feeling in ur eintire stay here. The manager , and the management are totally in sync with the theme of being COLD. Absolutly pathetic staff. During my stay i also saw Manager escorting one group out, and in that confusion the staff members molesting the girls of that group!!! Like for no reason.

the message is specially for girls.. please dont visit this place. i dont think the respect flows in the staff. Visited a lot of low priced places bt never felt soo uncomfortable.

 Besides ur drinks will take ages to come, and also you would be annoyed till the last drop of your drink, the dj would nt play your song. FOOD please dont try.

So came here jst a few minutes ago with two f my friends and was told that there is a party scene today so stag entries are not allowed. We were told that only couples are allowed which was understandable but its the latter bit that made me berserk. The next question that i asked was so can i get an entry with my boyfriend and not surprisingly i was responded back by the host with a polite 'NO' with a smirk on their face.

FYI u guys we are in the 21st century. Homophoobia is rampant n u guys jst proved it. Having a bar with great food, great ambience does not make us modern. Its a liberal thought process that does.

M certainly not coming back coz of reasons explained. I dont need ur approval for being myslf.

Thankyou for an eye opening experience that i have faced many a times bt this one was jst d worst.

I had heard a lot about this place so walked in one day for some drinks. Very poorly lit. The place was okay. Ordered for beer and rum. The Kung pao starter was more like a chili chicken with nuts thrown in between. The reason for giving a 2.5 is the DJ. The songs being played were really boring and on requesting him to play a nice song all he said was to wait for an hour. One expects peppy and nice songs in clubs but if the music only is a downer then it is really sad.

To be honest, I am more of a travel and peace and rock music kinda girl than clubbing and loud ass edm music.

But, when I entered Bar Stock exchange, it felt nice. In the simplest words, it felt nice. The ambience and the way it it is designed is VERY different from the regular dance places. This is the reason why I like it so much. You'd always have your own space to dance even it it is jammed up like crazy. The lighting is perfect too.  

Can't really say much about the food since I have had a couple of dishes here as we mostly went to drink and dance. Pasta with Garlic Bread and a Lebanese Platter which is not there in the menu. Both were good enough.

Would always go back to this one place solely because of it's interiors and it's space design. The only reasons.

Word of advice - You can try playing different genres on certain days and try a better menu design.

A nice house bar with an unique way of pricing. It's literally like a stock exchange, where prices of liquors go up n down depending on demand/orders placed! This concept receives thumbs up! 
The bartenders were responsive and I didn't had to wait a long time for the food to be served on the table. The food was great but not much in varieties. 
Ambience-4/5 Food-4.5/5
The DJ was playing some cool numbers, although the dance arena was much small. Sports screening is also present, so you can  watch your favourite matches grabbing a chilled beer there! 
One thing was a bit turnoff... the man at the door was rude which puzzled me for a minute.

Simple is Beautiful. I don't want to eat undercooked meals served on a diamond studded plate, nor do I want late service in a beautifully decorated outlet. To me ambience is important,but the product even more. What I like about this place, is the concept where you can control the price of your drinks. They also have an app where you can directly order drinks to your table. 
Regarding stags, yes there is a problem as the floor space is less and that is why stags are restrained. But you can't expect good behaviour when stags are begging to enter. I have faced it myself and so I know. Looking forward to visit again. Cheers!

To be honest, the place is really good. The only concern for me and all the stags around kolkata is that the behaviour of the manager. Its way too rude and insensitive. Its perfectly fine if stags are not allowed but the way the stags are treated and spoken is not what you call manners. Customers should be treated in a good way and should be denied in a polite manner. Very bad communication and should learn how to behave.

Visited the place this Saturday. I visit pubs and discs often and based on my review on other establishments, this place was OK. It is nothing great. The interior is very normal. Its like an old building or garage from inside. The bar is all right too. Does not look that great. The waiters looked confused. I asked a waiter whether the table was reserved as it had a reserved card showing but he was so confused that he went to ask another waiter. Price of drinks are fine. But service could be better. They are not attentive. I loved the music. I did not expect the DJ to play so well though he should play more of trending songs than too old songs. But his mix was good. And the dance floor is too small. I know its not a proper disc but if the dance floor was bigger it would have been better.

Visited this pub themed as stock exchange with the prices of drinks going up and down on astami evening with friends. This is a much hyped place. The drinks rated as low price tasted very pale - just loaded with ice and some flavours and soda was added to boost up. You cant even feel the taste of alcohol in the drink. The entry per person (female) was 500 rs. which was adjusted (-minus off) from the total bar amount. We ordered mexican french fry which was just awful - fries are not at all crisp, its just tossed with little cheese and salsa.Pocket pinch is high.

Evidently, this place needs no introduction! 
And if you are thinking it's only the youth who flock this paradise, then you are grossly mistaken. 

Truth be told, Kolkata loves the concept of 'Bar Stock Exchange' and it loves 'Shisha'! 

Why wouldn't they! 
Liquor at shockingly low prices.. appropriate choice of music.. and a cutest little dance floor for the hopeless romantics. 
Plus, they have an amaaaaazing Spaghetti platter, which is sure to drive you nuts!

This place is overhyped. But the concept is unique but can't compare this with mumbai bar stock exchange. Drinks are over priced. If it's showing 210 in the bar stock board but in your bill they will charge 260 plus tax. Ambiance was good normal party place.. as a whole a new experience...

From one of the most loved places of the town to a barren place now, all bcoz of the old management who was reluctant in refusing people entry and tables with no good reason.

When my friends told me that this place is nice and have a very nice mixture of everything I was very keen to go to this place and I went. To my surprise I find this pretty much average! Why?
1. The chairs/tools were very uncomfortable, it was long and could give pain to your back when you sit for too long.
2. When we went there the music was lousy, it continued that way for the next 1.3 hour at least! We had a group of 5 and almost every one of us had requested the DJ to put some nice songs/music along with other people as well. But he thought that he's the best in the business so he just continued it. That's the main reason we moved to @Roxy - The Park later that night.
3. Depending on the theme of the pub it's nice to see the menu on the screen like share market but trust me it's a pain in the eyes for people who are sitting on the corner or the farthest. It won't hurt you to put a menu card or two put on the table.
4. LIIT was fine. First one too much vodka, second one was average.
5. Hookah was nice. For a better experience read

Well went there with lot of expectations after hearing so much and the reviews. Just to be precise, the decor and theme is very good with the graffiti's on the wall, a bar setup in the middle. The seating was very uncomfortable with high stools hurting your back, they had a so called reserved couch. We went on a thursday so no crowd, lesser party scenes that is. We had whiskey and liit, which was not made well. Food we did not try! But the hookah was good, the blend was nice of kiwi and mint, lasted long too.
The dj was very annoying, after requesting so many times he did not play a single song which we had asked for. It was huge turn off. Only friday and saturday nights attract crowd here and even drinks price change constantly so even if u order something at one price you end up paying much more for it.
Lastly, would like to comment on their service according to me the servers do not feel important to attend people, they are just very happy to chit chat amongst themselves and after calling out like a million times in that loud music if u strike luck u get a bit of attention.

Located near the Camac Street Pantaloons this place is easy to find. In the D block of the building on the 5th floor. Went there yesterday, it was pretty empty then maybe because it was a weekday evening. The interior has a rugged look (tbh it didn't quite impress me/catch my eye, but that's just my opinion). The service was not bad, though they take pretty long to serve the food items but they are quick on serving the drinks. We ordered few drinks and Thai Chicken Spring Roll and Kung Pao Chicken. The place is very spacious.

Never expected BSE to be such a pathetic place with all rude people managing it. 
I went to BSE with my dad and brother on 30th of September at around 6 or may be 7, I asked them for a table for 3 the person all well dressed said nothing to me, I peeped inside there were enough tables empty, but they did not say a word to us for letting us in. We stood there for like 5 or 10 mins then I asked the person will it take time, very politely he said yes. I left after this. I didn't understand when the tables were empty why were we not given a table, and not spoken to. Never entering BSE again. Shame on you.

Please mention the entry charges. For entry you guys charge separately but that is not mentioned. It's quite deceiving. Not that well organised place. No billing system as I faced. I paid the money but was asked whom I paid etc. I literally had to look for the guy who I paid. Had to sit for long for a hookah.  Music is really good.

You can even relax and have some food after in TFO. The food isn't that great, so don't gi there thinking you will be having a dinner or something .

This is the 3rd time I've been to Shisha-BSE. It's a very spacious place, well decorated. Although the lighting is a bit dim, it suits the interiors. The thing that attracts one's attention right at the entrance are the huge jenga blocks. There's also beer pong. The main attraction of this place is the price of alcohol that rises and falls just like stocks in a share market. So while you can have classic drinks like sangria and LIIT at a reasonable price, you can also have a Jack Daniels or a Jim Beam for as less as 200 bucks a peg. 
In food, We had ordered Peri peri potato wedges and Nachos Grande for starters. We also ordered Kung pao chicken, Penne pasta in mushroom creme sauce and grilled chicken. The chicken and pasta was delicious, although the Nachos was less in quantity. 
This place is considerably empty on weekdays but Fri-Sun, I would suggest one to make a reservation from beforehand because it gets pretty crowded.

I went to to celebrate my friend's birthday and chill with friends. But all the celebration was spoiled. The employees and their service is pathetic. There is no guest treatment. I don't really prefer going here to spoil my mood than going to the new places opening up but have well behaved staff. The problem with them is if they have so much crowd, they should have enough staff to attend to. And more importantly, treat guests properly.

Read and heard good reviews about the place so dropped in on Saturday 6:30pm(it was impossible to be packed at this time) . They told it's packed and did not even take waiting dont know for what reason. Worst front desk response ever. At least they should have offered us some entry scheme . Wasted our time & energy. Increase in their brand name  has lead them to forget etiquettes towards customers.
Avoid this place if you are new to Kol don't waste time giving them a visit .....

Shisha- Stock exchange is located in camac street just beside The factory outlet. This is a good place for the party hoppers.  The interiors are amazing and area is quite large. The concept of the stock exchange that is the prices of the drinks will increase according to the demand is quite innovative. There is jenga and beer pong which is a great attraction. The place is generally filled with young happy faces. We had order quite a number of drinks and the cosmopolitan being one of the drinks .It was quite refreshing. We had also ordered a kung pao chicken which was quite good. The music is extremely loud at times and the staff behavior is not good. They do not care about your comfort and requirements at all. A good place to hangout but the only downside is the behaviors of the staff. :/

It's a nice place to party with your friends. Music is sometimes great sometimes okay, but the dance floor is always very lively. Drinks are decent enough, food is good. The staff are a bit laidback though when it comes to serving drinks. The USP of this place is the ambience and the concept. My friends and me are a regular here. It's always a nice place to come and enjoy in the weekends. Though it's always very crowded. But still will definitely recommend you to check it out :)

Interior is astonishing.
It's unique and different.
Enough spacious and crowded.
Try once if you haven't tried it at all.
Seating arrangement is done beautifully.
Hookah coal change is not applicable which is dissapointing. On request, they changed the pipe and gave cooled pipe which helps to enhance the freshness and flavour.
I found music a bit low which can be increased.
Rest everything is fine. 
I have tried chicken tikka kabab, fish fingers, brain freezer hookah, orange mint hookah, grape mint hookah. All were splendid.

We went to shisha on a friday evening, having heard numerous recommendations about the place. It is located right opposite to the factory outlet and yes...the music is great as well as the ambience and the whole idea of bar stock exchange where the prices of the drinks vary according to the demands is really innovative and cool!! The crowd is also happening and the service more or less efficient. We hit up a number of drinks, a few beers, scotch, vat 69 and 100 pipers and a variety of cocktails like caprioska, bloody mary and cosmopolitan and kahlua shots, which were suprisingly good! We also dug into tasty grub like kung pao chicken and homemade chips with garlic mayo sauce. But the biggest disappointment was the behaviour of the staff! They took us 1500 bucks from as cover charge and promised to deduct it from the final bill, but when we somehow misplaced the receipt, they blatantly refused to refund the cover charge. Such poor organisation on their part, the receipt was not even printed, a scrawl on a piece of paper...if they are taking cover charge they should at least print our names on the receipt or make an entry in a computer to prevent others from unjustly redeeming another's money. They obviously have no regard for customer satisfaction, just concerned about managing the crowd and making easy cash. This realisation completely marred what could have otherwise been an awesome night at a trendy bar. What a huge let-down!!

Had heard so much about this place.Loved their stock exchange wala policy i.e the prices of the drinks very according to the demand.We went there on a friday evening..It was pretty crowded.We weren't offered any tables and all the vacant ones were marked reserved.On asking,the waiter allotted us a table.We were told to order our drinks via the app which was great.Coz the waiters wont be able to hear you in the first place.Very very very loud music.And the crowd mostly consists of marwaris and college people.Drinks are cheap.We had ordered beers,vat 69,100 pipers,bloody mary,a caprioska,cosmopolitan,3 kahluas,2 buckets of chips and dips,kung pao chicken.The bill came at around 2800 bucks.But there was a problem.We had to pay cover charge of 1500 bucks  which we were told would get adjusted with the bill.Unfortunately,we lost the receipt since we were not told to keep it.It was at our table and somebody must have picked it up.The man at the desk was very very very rude to us.Other people talked sensibly but this guy was so damn disgusting.In the end,we had to pay 2800 along with the 1500 that we had paid already.They said they would check the cctv footage but I have no idea whether they did it.Never coming back again.

The money you invest in a place like this is just a waste if you don't train your staff. We went on a weekday when the place was low on head count. It was a good experience. 
So we went back on the weekend just to find that the guy at the entrance is playing God and tells me a cover charge while not even looking at me. I mean it's great that you have a smile when you talk to the ladies but to act like that to the guys as if you are doing a favour letting us in. Manners bwoy..basic manners..before u end up eating all the rating the place has got.

The one standing on the gate behaves like he is doing a favour by letting people in side so that they can pay for their food while I am sure he can't buy himself a can of country beer after a years salary. Looks like a lot of rich kids have been Molesting him every now and then. Remember my early teens and 20's when the college gang would tharsh such people black and blue. Visited a shady bar in Cambodia last month where the staff was much more courteous.

(The time difference between the order placed and bill was negligible) and also the app. Is only functional for those who have a table reserved. And unfortunately for the tables, its at the magnmnts discretion. So its a NO mostly for non-regular ppl.

Shisha mostly called as BSE is one of the happening place in the city.

Located at the Pantaloons Westside building this place is very popular among youngsters. Mainly famous for the stock exchange style pricing of the booze which changes according to the demand. If your luck works you will be in win win situation. As I am not into boozing I tried some of the starters along with soft drinks. The chicken phuket was decent in taste but the fish starter was not that great and didnt like the quality of the fish used it was a little smelly. If you are purely in a mood to enjoy dance and have fun over booze you will surely enjoy here.

Grossly overhyped place, understaffed, the service is pathetically slow. You have to shout your lungs out for an order and if you're lucky you might get your food after half an hour. The prices on the screens are just a window dressing, the actual rates are always higher on the bill (even after excluding taxes)..a place like this is running only because Calcutta has very limited options currently!

What a lively place.. situated on the top floor of westside at camac street. We mainly went there for boozing. The price of the drinks change here,according to the demands of the drink. And the luck was in our favour yesterday,we had black dog gold,ballantine,tequila,absynth and vat 69..30ml each. Only the tequila costed 120,and all the other drinks were within 100. 🤗 The garlic chips with mayo dips were really yummy.😄 Their staffs are friendly,decoration is pretty. Also they have a small dance floor and a good backgroud music will set ur mood for the day. So for me a great experience,wishing to visit soon...and let's see if we get lucky for the second time too. 😝

Innovation meets marketing. The idea of putting in place a stock exchange pricing system is one of a kind, and its effectiveness is more than one can imagine. Prices rise and fall according to the demand of a specific alcohol and it is a wonderful place for people who like to enjoy a great ambiance and shell out less.
Be it the ambiance, the price or the food all are as good as the name of the establishment

Bar Stock Exchange concept implemented poorly in Kolkata!
This place is usually really crowded with teenagers, so most of the time they have a cover charge of 500 or 1000 depending on occasion (you can drink worth that much inside).

Getting a table is almost next to impossible. Bar service is PATHETIC!! There are only 2-3 people at the bar and they'll take 10 mins just to listen to you. (They follow the golden bar rule - Serve the hotties first)
So by the time your order the price will have changed.

Music is too loud sometimes. Overall its nice if you're going with a group of friends. They have a dance floor and a decent DJ and also Beer Pong. 

Bad service ruins this place! Disappointed

Here, we have always visited the place in our big groups. 
Place is dark, solace, cold, smokey. You'll find it similar to the gateway to hell. And why do I screw my saturdays every now & then spend tens of thousands over a month's time? Because we all love the drama that unravels here. 
You know what sucks? Management. Now that Shamim is back, we hope for the best, but Ritesh refuses to recognise people sometimes he had offered table to help them wipe their wallets. Hey! I'm totally up for paying at the entrance, ask for double for I care. But atleast, remember the faces dude, like Mr.Ahuja does, or Prashant does, or Alam or Abhijit does! I never liked Shisha. But I really do hope, it doesn't work around like the last time. And trust me, buying drinks at the bar, is more difficult then me ever liking the place.

The Ambiance gets you pseudo high even before your first order shows up! The drinks are amazing. Not only are they unbelievably cheap, but the preparation is good too. We ordered several glasses of Red Label and a pitcher of LIT. The iced tea was so smooth, you could taste the alcohol perfectly.
Food service is below average.  They have a very limited menu, which is quite expensive and neither quantity nor taste is  worth it. To top it off, they take way too long to serve up. We ordered "Honey Chilli Potatoes", " Chilli Paneer", "Mexican Fries" and some chips,  chilli potatoes were fine, the rest was below average. If you intend to visit this place, do it for the alcohol and the atmosphere only.

After a couple of visits...Pathetic management.what's the sense of opening a place if it can't be managed.either keep more staff or shut down this place!! This place is actually overhyped!! 
I've noticed that this place doesn't even know the concept on which it's named..no matter what price you see on d screen n order your drink..by the time it reaches you...it'll b over charged by 200-250 bucks(Atleast).the screen is nthn but a show.if u order a single drink which is about 1k u still have to shout ur lungs out to get peanuts which are chargeable @ Rs 60...which they ask u to pay immediately( coz u myt just steal the peanuts n run n they'll b at a loss..isn't it??)u pay n u never get the bill or the balance back n d peanuts reach u after 30 mins..n tastes like shit..!!! Guess charging fr peanuts makes them a lil Richer but at the cost of their service ratings.!friendly suggestion to the owner -go visit the actual bar stock exchange..n get ur facts right..! 
Food pathetic over priced and not worth it!! 

M never gona recommend this place to any one and m never going back! I wish i cn give -10 !!

Nice hang out zone  for students ! The deal on weekdays is better I must admit because there are no cover charges!! Weekends can be a mad rush. Honestly there aren't much differences when it comes to the costs of the drinks as most have claimed.. Food is definitely not their strong point ..I had Kung Pao...

So BSE , it's the new happening place as the folks would call it and it indeed is a nice place to loosen up, catch up people and yea make memories(I sure do remember the one's I've made😋)
As the idea was new to Kolkata it kept blooming but as we all know it's just a phase 
People are gonna enjoy this place till something new comes along 
Till then drink till you drop and make memories😉

BSE is one of the most happening places in town as of now.
Never felt the need to mark my calendar of i had to visit. 
Auctioned drinks, nibbles and some smoke is the best way to catch up with friends.
What lacks is the staff behaviour which they need to improve on.

One of the best places i had been in Kolkata. I had a great time there, enjoying with my friends, partying, drinking dancing. A must for young Kolkata people. 

Food was great, good alcohol variants, beautiful crowd, amazing ambiance, friendly people but most importantly  excellent music. You just can't stop dancing the tunes of the songs..Guaranteed Fun.

A very nice place to hang out with your friends and chill in the evening and deep into the night. And also, just for little fun, the beer stock market keeps you on your toes to just order something that you have not planned for.

The only little problem I faced was the seating. My group found a place to sit after 45 minutes. But in their defence, it was a saturday night, so crowd expected.

Overall, a very nice experience to have. I had a great time there and I recommend you to try it out yourself.

Keep up the good work guys.

One of the cheap place to booze and hang with your friends. Along with its dance floor and music rocking you up every moment. 
If stock exchange prices are high, it can be a bit costly else a wonderful place to get high.

Extremely bad hospitality. Two of us went there and though they had enough tables empty they would not let us sit coz we were only two. They reserved all tables for four or more people. When I asked them to provide a seat they didn't even bother to reply us properly. Somehow they gave us seat in an over cramped bar. Then as we decided to order the bartender told us that the app is not working. Absolutely ridiculous.

We had d option of only ordering drinks as we were not even given a food menu.(reasons known best to dem)
However deco is really good...quirky..doddle walls... Colorful seating... Music is peppy n foot tapping.

Share market now in a new format. Instead of shares you choose alcohol of your taste and buy it at the rite tym so that it is at its lowest price. Its fun choosing your drink and more fun when you drink it. So cheers to Shisha - Bar Exchange.

This place is one of the most happening places of kolkata. Located at Camac street this place has an awesome ambience. I have already visited this place 6-8times by now and each and every time it has amused me with its playlist. Its a whole different world here. One wouldn't expect it to be sooo crowded and yet the service is soo well maintained. Cheap liquor good hookah loud music and the unique environment of it has made it achieve the top spot on my best-places list. The staff are very very friendly. If you are looking for a place where you can party hard then this is the place you gotta visit. And the best part about this place is that on sundays the DJ plays bollywood songs the whole time and this is the thing I loved about this place as there is no other place of this class which would play these songs. The DJ is one of the best I was witnessed. This place is highly recommended and yeah try going to this place early so that you could get a table for yourself as it gets full really fast. And if you liked my review then do follow me for more of it. And yes, hats off to Team BSE!! Keep up the good work!!

The place is overhyped. As much as I can give them the credit for bringing the price stock exchange idea, I also take away the credit for running the show so shoddily!! 
They loot you in every possible way, in Mumbai, the price jo hai woh hai. Here, if the price on the board is 150 they will charge 200! To top it, they add additional service tax, liquor tax blah blah. What service tax??!! We are not even offered a table!!! The one we struggled to find was not given to us citing "reserved hai for special guests" 
Also, the people are sooooo full of attitude!!! They hardly pay attention and they force a cover charge on you!!
The best part being, the owner happened to a friend, on calling him up n complaining .. The entire tone n treatment!!! So, in Kolkata...only contacts work, eh? 
So all in all ...improve on a lot of aspects to get a better review from honest customers be it a friend or not!

Shisha- Bar Exchange is one of the unique bar concepts in Kolkata, though this is quite popular in other metropolitan cities of the country. The bar exchange concept is just too good to make you excited and its pretty fun. Went to this place few months ago with friends and loved it overall. The exciting part is you have to keep a track on the exchange board and place the order. 

Location: Located at the top floor of the Westside Buildinh in Camac Street, this place is not difficult to find.

Ambience: The ambience is something you would love. The bar section is quite nice which is beautifully setup. The rugged decor of the place is something to look at. The tables and steel chairs give a rough look. The rough walls and the big windows through which you get a good view of the city makes the place more attractive. 

Service: The staffs were really nice to us. The smile on their face was something which was consistent through out. The service was quick and we did not have to wait long for our orders. The behaviour of all the staffs are polite and worth appreciating.

Experience: We went there basically for boozing. Got some steal deals there during the exchange. Overall loved the concept.

4/5 for this place.

I really like this place although it can get a bit overcrowded at times.  Despite it being a bit expensive, the fluctuating prices (as determined by demand and supply) make it possible to get some pretty good deals if you don't mind switching between different kinds of spirits. Another major positive for me at least is the fact that you can smoke next to the bar instead of being forced to enter a cramped and dirty smoking room. The chicken starters I ordered were pretty decent as well. Finally, its worth mentioning that the cocktails are really strong. Admittedly this is a major positive for budget conscious customers and party animals. However, I would probably come here a lot more often if the cocktails tasted better even if they had lesser alcoholic content (they put red bull in an LIT)

Drinks are auctioned. They have their application through which you can place the order. New concept, which can lead to really low prices. Personally, the Ambience is not the one you will be fond of. It's got a vintage feel, but it could be done much better! Food is nothing but average.

Good place. Nice concept. The whole new revamped shisha is a fun place to chill and hang out with friends. The finger food that these people serve with the drinks is amazing but the quantity however is less. The real vibe of this place is actually felt on Friday Saturday and Sunday. On weekdays the place is just about okay.

Been here 2-3 times , the atmosphere is amazing, the food is OK and the concept of alcohol prices according to the demand and supply is nice. However the biggest problem is the service - the managers and staff act like they are doing us a a favour by serving us and are extremely rude and snobbish. If you are in a small group of 2-3 they will purposely not give u a table even when it is empty , in order to keep it vacant for a larger group. Each time I visited , we had more girls in d group than guys but the service was the same - moving from bad to worse. The previous establishment had suffered similar problems that led to them having to shut down , hope it doesn't happen again as the place and concept are very well thought of.

Dj was also extremely rude, he abused us when we asked him to play our song. All in all poor staff, good food, not so cheap drinks. Staff will try to ruin the night for you in whatever way possible so please be aware. and yes concept poorly copied from BSE mumbai.

This place is one of the craziest places right now in Kolkata. Though not anywhere near to the Bar stock exchange in Mumbai but the concept was new and innovative in Kolkata. I am a very regular visitor to this place. Though it really sucks in terms of food the ambiance and all is very good. There is nothing clear about who controls the price here but all in all its a good place to visit on weekends

Given the fact that this place is literally called Shisha, I thought that their Shisha was disappointing. It might be because of their small hookahs and the resulting small air gap, but I do believe that it can be much better. The flavour is good, but they little amount of smoke is a let down. This would require an overhaul in the inventory so that's not likely to change.

Other than that I thought the concept of an stock exchange is a great idea, it's good fun albeit not being a novel concept. But they have executed it rather well and coupled with the decor, the place is successful in creating an atmosphere that draws you in.

The dance floor started to rock at around 8o clock and took its time to come to life.. Would definitely visit it as soon as possible and looking forward to it..

Barely any Staff courtesy
Entry is one hell of a task 
You probably might just have to spend an hour outside convincing the executives to let you in if you're not a regular face !
Prices are just not at all low as they claim to be.
It isn't 1/4th of BSE what we see in Bom.
All BSEs in Bom are just wow !
It's just for name sake 
No matter how low priced you punch your order the bill will be standardised.
Music is okay 
Location is wow !
Beware fake alcohol !
There are regulars, many fond of this place but this is simply my review based on my exp
No hard feelings nothing personal !

I wouldn't recommend BSE !

Bloody thieves. They don't know the concept they are using. They show some on the screen, and charge a completely different price. When you call them to reserve a table, they don't take a reservation but when you get there, every god damn table, even the empty ones, are supposedly reserved. What nonsense. You would expect better from such a place.

This place was pretty cool. The ambience and music were good. The price of liquor goes up and down like stock market hence the name bar stock exchange. Staffs were pretty welcoming and friendly. Use the shisha bar stock exchange app to order the liquor in order to avoid the struggle of going to the counter and get it. I went on a Tuesday evening and found a lot of teenagers, probably most them were below "18" . Coming to the part which i didn't like. If you take a table of 4 they have this chairs which are like pretty high and adjusting them is really a pain, even for me as i am 6' tall. When you order any liquor, you'll find the bill to be pretty high. They are adding service tax + vat + an additional 27% of liquor tax. I understand and agree to pay the additional 27% liquor tax but the problem is while ordering it's not mentioned anywhere. So i feel it's kind of a shady business. You people might not agree with me but this is what i feel. Apart from these two things everything else was good about this place. One little heads up if you order any liquor and want to pay later then you have to submit your driving license. once you pay the total amount you can take your license back. Dance floor is also there.

Went here due to a lot of hype about the place, but did not understand what was so great about it. We were served hot beer, they asked us to check, we did touch the bottom part which was cold but it so happens that they put it on some cool place and only the down portion was cold and the whole beer was weird. Anyway, one can smoke and drink here. That's about all the good thing here. Crowded by school goers and such, the ambience wasn't anything different and we were made to leave since apparently the table had been reserved (they probably just drove us away). Oh well. We had a much better place to go to. Basically come here of you are short on cash and are a huge group.

Management behavior is worst..it all depends on there mood being regular there and even after that they treat as a favor in festives..like is this a joke?? If you cant accommodate or allow then stop sending invitations..

After we arrived at this place on a Saturday night the worst part was the concierge in the name of Sheikh Salman. I highly feel he is oblivious to the fact that he is in the hospitality sector. 

We were okay with paying cover charge since were stags initially when they said we couldn't enter we agreed and humbly obliged, but once we called up a few friends to come over the same mr. Salman was highly inappropriate with his behaviour. I highly recommend this person to be put in his place before everything falls apart due to the behaviour of one dude.

Otherwise the place, music and concept is good. Its the same concept as the BSE in bombay or tipsy bull in bangalore. The latter have much better and well behaved staff than here.

So finally after listening to all the hype about this place checked in last sunday.Its the old shisha that has been renovated into this new happening place.It has the concept of share market that is alcohol prices vary as per the demand
*NOTE* For first timers please download the shisha app beforehand..so that you predecide on coming into this place according to the price variations of alcohols..AND alcohol orders can also be done via this app...better keep your cellphones charged up..when you enter :D
Coming to the ambience..its very good..specially you will get the best crowd  here as its the most happening place in town at the moment as per me..:)

Food and booze was good..there is also a sweet small dance floor..where you all can let loose..Overall a great experience..

TIP : chip in here a bit early with your gang to avoid rush..it gets overcrowded after 7:30-8pm on weekends.

BSE is a newly opened, really cool place to chill out with friends. Came here at 3.30pm and they assigned 2 hours to us because the place was booked for a party. Besides that, the price of the drinks change according to the demand. The interiors are dim and spacious, just about right for a clubbing experience. The waiters are very friendly. Could not get enough of the chips and garlic dip! So good! Did not try anything except drinks and snacks, but would definitely come here again for partying perhaps. Minimum pocket pinch would be around 800 rupees.

If only I could give lesser than 0. An absolute disappointment of a place not because of the service or food or anything but because the scam that goes on in this place. It's a bloody place where you get scammed and duped of your money. We were two couples and had to pay a cover charge of 2000 per couple which is okay. Within 3 rounds of drinks which was nothing but 2 beer and a whisky and vodka all quite on a mod level it was informed to us that the cover charge eligibility is over. On request for the bill that shows us the drink consumption of 4000 it was denied that "sorry sir bill nahi hai". Unfortunately I don't remember the name of that manager however one of them the most cocky guy I've seen. What cemented the fact that there's a damn scam going on was when one of my friend who also gave a coupon of 1000 bucks and asked for two carlsberg was informed that 1000 bucks is over although the Shisha App showed 165 for the beer apiece to which the management had no frigging explanation. I Felt cheated and duped. This is not acceptable. 

I had brilliant memory of the time prior I had went however just because it was a weekend this time my good memories are scarred forever. I wish someone would look into this bullshit which is going on and take corrective action against this.

well i dont know what people think about Shisha bse but it has become our favorite party destination for couple of month now.. though they create a mess at the entry, its really sad that people who visit BSE on a regular basis have to literally stand in the Que and ask or rather beg for entry.. this is saddening. the crowd is good. the music is  reeealy good!! but the security system is really poor.bouncers dont work properly..we saw guys fighting like savages. things need to be improvised. but stil WE LOVE IT :D

Makeover to Bar Stock..nice concept in town..attracting more people

To be honest dint liked the place..ordered Budweiser which I ordered while watching the price on screen..the price was fluctuating for the said item but when I ordered they said its out of stock..then why they were fluctuating the price...

Seating are ok..management should work on these minute things a bit

I would recommend drink at Wall Street. Very cheap alcohol. And then come and just enjoy the DJ. That's all that's good here. That's what we did. Don't eat or drink here. Too costly and bad drinks.

A great place to party...we were a group of 10 and the place was so crowded that we had to wait for some time to get in. The music is quite loud...so interacting with the waiters is a pain. The prices of the drinks keep fluctuating based on the demand.
The dj is good but the dance floor is a tad bit small.
Now the drinks are quite good,especially the liit tower. The hookah is good as well,but service is slow and chaotic.
The nibbles are tasty...but the garlic dip whic accompanied them was heavenly...tangy and full of flavours that go very well with the drinks.
Had also ordered kung pao chicken,which was ordinary.
Go with a group of friends and party hard! Cheers!

Cool place. With the shady interiors, metal high stools, hanging bulbs over table, large size jenga, funky wall arts, cemented textured floor, and a long bar in between with stock exchange like news flashing over for you to order drinks at different fluctuating prices. Prices do fluctuate between 100rs up down. N have never seen 30ml drinks priced so low in any place. Old monk was at 34 a peg, royal challenge 57 a peg. Food menu is ok, not much items, but u can manage. Go for ambiance, drinks, music,n life size jenga

My second visit and got ripped off completely, this time. Before coming to the food and ambience part that everyone writes about, let me shed some light on my above statement. They (Shisha management) have a very dubious billing structure, fixed service charge @10% and multiple service taxes. I have attached the pic of my bill and a plate of sausage cocktail. But if you pay attention to the bill they provided, you'll see how the rip-off happens. Here's the link you need to save yourself the rip-off when you are visiting this place next time around --- http://www.news18.com/news/business/how-restaurants-dupe-customers-in-the-name-of-service-tax-and-service-charges-1083434.html 
Me & my friend had 2 buds, 2 hookahs, 1 chilli chicken, 1 sausage cocktail & 1 ice tea foot long. The hookahs don't last more than 30 mins, they don't change coal, btw, so had to get another hookah, the food was pathetic, the chilli chicken had thick coating & tasted like fish and the sausage cocktail was more like brinjal bharta with sausage.
I raised questions on their bill with the manager and the 1st time round he said it's their "policy" and when called again he did not even have the decency to show up, this how you treat your customers?
Thank you Shisha, never again !!!

Nothing good about the place..except the concept which seems fab!!
My first impression was very bad, when you cannot handle all that crowd why invite them in.
Mismanaged, a waiter never arrives, once he takes the order takes ages to return.
Ambience ain't appreciating.
Music only Bollywood??
I thought maybe my luck is bad so I visited a second time and same and third same. Never wanna visit again.
This place my please more to the school and college goers.
Sorry guys but I miss the old place 😌

As the name suggests it had the concept of stock exchange market with LEDs all over showing the prices of alcohol fluctuating like stock price .
You need to order via its app or the waiters could do it for you.
Pocket friendly if gone before 7pm .
LIT pitcher costed us Rs400 at 4pm.
And beer had normal rates .
We had ordered a veg mixed sauce pasta. Was delicious enough.
Overall the ambience was very nice. Decor was inticing with dim lights and good music.
They had different games arranged for.
Crowd was good. Loved it. Had fun!
A place worth checking out!

A proper, spacious nightclub with a stock exchange themed bar where the prices of the drinks keep fluctuating based on their demand. Have been here twice,once early and once after 7 PM. The pocket pinch was considerably lighter the first time! If u just wanna get drunk, arrive a little early, then the bartenders will be able to actually listen to u and u can drink in peace. Arrive in the evening if u hv party on ur mind! But mind u,it gets very crowded,and for quite good reasons. The décor is nicely done,with dim lit lights, bar stools, swing chairs and a dancefloor along with a DJ console. I can only comment on the DJ for Saturday night and he is really good :) you can dance away merrily for a good amount of time. But beware,somebody might spill their drink on u as its quite crowded :-P be ready to wait fr a long time for your drinks to arrive during the evenings or late afternoons. But definitely a great place to party with your friends :) Cheers!

A few of my friends and I hit shisha- bar exchange the other day, it was good fun.

Even thou it wasn't really crowded it was utter chaotic, getting the attention of the waiters was a pain.

The shisha was quite decent, but these guys don't  Change the coal once it's done, which is rather a shame.

The bar works like every other bar stock exchange, the cost of the drinks keep going up and down depending on the demand for the drinks. So the safest bet is to order the maximum number of drinks when it's still the priced cheap.

Decent place, would have enjoyed the place more had the given more attention to customer service.

Have been here more than once and every time the experience was worse than the other. BSE is basically an upgraded version of shaw bar with music and lights with music not always available. Sure the theme is fun and the booze is cheap but with proper hospitality,we all can have a much better experience. The waiters are very good and friendly but the lady manager always ruins our day.

I seriously recommend not to visit this place if you are looking for a good experience!! 

the managers think they are presidents of the country and have no sense of respect for people who are willing to pay!! 

I Seriously suggest not to visit this place to those who are looking for hospitality!!

How did I never review this place! A stone's throw away from my place, Shisha got renovated and transformed into Shisha Bar exchange. Yes you're thinking right! It has the same concept of a share market where prices of alcohol fluctuate with demand. What's even cool is that they have an app you can download and check prices before stepping in.
The place has a cool vibe to it. The central atrium is the huge bar with over 10 people helping youwith your booze orders. There is a dance floor too for the happy feet people. 
The food here is mostly finger food and club fare. I usually go for their Peri Peri fries along with beer. I have also had their pasta and it is delicious ( mixed sauce penne, fusilli Florentine veg)
The stuffed mushrooms are also very good, provided you're looking at nibble bites with alcohol.
For drinks its usually the regular stuff like beer, vodka, hagerbombs but I have tried a cocktail (forgetting the name, sorry)

The music and ambiance make it a pretty cool hangout!
Not to forget the make well very good sheesha!

Love, love, love this place!

Very difficult to get inside the pub, stag are not allowed, until and unless you are regular. Service needs to be improved. Too much crowded after 7:00 pm. Pitcher is too good. Ordered for LIIT pitcher, and many more drinks. There food is also good, limited but.

There is also a small dance floor and beer pong tables. I went there on a tuesday and it was completely packed and we had to sit on the bar for sometime. The service is good and fast, also the food is great. The tandoori platter is highly recommended.

Since lounges are  mainly for partying and drinking , food is usually not paid attention to. But shisha is an exception. The food is really excellent. We had the spinach and cheese rolls and also the potato wedges. We also had the florentine and spicy chicken pasta. They were both delicious. Their menu is also limited and works well with drinks

We had entered and inside we had a lovely time.. The ambience is very nice. The atmosphere is vibrant and you would feel like dancing the moment you enter. If you plan to go on a date it is probably not the best choice because then you would end up shouting at the top of your voices to get heard. Drinks are expensive and The bartenders are extremely slow. When we saw the price of beer was low we ordered it but he was so slow that by the time he was done the price had increased.  Then we had gone outside to drop a friend's aunt and because it took time to get one cab, we weren't allowed inside..The staff at the gate were extremely rude and had no manners whatsoever while talking to females.. Absolutely disgusted at their behaviour..

Drinks are expensive and The bartenders are extremely slow. When we saw the price of beer was low we ordered it but he was so slow that by the time he was done the price had increased.  Then we had gone outside to drop a friend's aunt and because it took time to get one cab, we weren't allowed inside..The staff at the gate were extremely rude and had no manners whatsoever while talking to females.. Absolutely disgusted at their behaviour..

And when shisha turned into shisha bar exchange, I loved it even more! 
Classy and quirky ambience and lots of interesting activities to stand out.
I had my favourite classic cocktails and all of them were well made.
The open chicken paratha was well done and the concept appealed me.
The fish goujon with taster was favourite... Loved it! 
Il keep coming back shisha!

If only you people could do away with diluted alcohol and all the more diluted service. Just because you carry forward the name of the legit Shisha doesn't mean you'll act and serve according to your whims and fancies.

Our exam question paper has more pages than your menu, the person keeping an eye on us does that all the 3 hours that we write and doesn't over charge us for the same.

Diluted alcohol, apparent shortage of variety of food with semi apparent service. This place can be taken in for a revamp.

If you love Bira, visit this place but on a Friday, before 6 pm. The rates are the cheapest then. *My Observation* :P

We live in a city, which is; in no way having any dearth of places of any genre whatsoever :)

Speaking about the most talked about place of the town right now, it'll not be a fairly satisfying experience if you plan to visit it on any of the weekends.
You need to sit and enjoy the music for 3/4th of an hour before you get your drinks served. Certainly, the rush is so much that the number of stewarts fall short.

Other than the said; the music, the ambience and the attraction : Beer Pong and Zenga, scores a perfect 5/5.

Awaiting better experiences soon. Cheers.

Shisha- Bar Exchange is definitely the newest, trendiest pub to hit in town. This place makes an impression right when you enter. Packed with teenaged crowd, this place is always humming with people, music, live performance and clinks of beer bottles.

Shisha is located on Block D of Pantanloons Westside building on Camac Street. Ranging from a variety of liquors to Shisha, this place has the coolest things. Their bar is top notch and so are their staff. The energy of this place is vibrant and is full of life.

Dimly lit just as a pub should be, sometimes accompanied by live music, this place is a must go to. Service is fast. Ambience, vibrant. And staff more than friendly and welcoming. This place is spot on on cleanliness and is very well maintained. I don't believe I have any negative remarks regarding Shisha - Bar Exchange. It totally deserves a total 4.5!

New concept for kolkata which works out very well..Instead of ordering to the staff I think the best option is to use the app as you can see the correct prices and order at a lesser price..Nibble options are good whereas Sheesha is good too but yes they need to improve a lot on their service part as it takes a hell lot of time for your order to come..Games are amazing especially beer pong and the crowd makes it the perfect place to chull :) :)

Been here 3 times and all times I have had completely different experiences. Overall, this sums up the newest pub in kolkata.

Service : The staff couldn't care less about you. It's quite crowded on weekends and the staff don't care whether you are attended to or not. Girls usually are the ones who drinks on the house. Extremely slow service.

Food : They don't have much of a food menu. Whatever we had was decent.

Music : They have an amazing music collection and the DJ comes to play every night which really sets the mood.

Ambiance : I like the ambiance. It's dark and the music sets the mood right up. I love how everyone is drinking and dancing all around. The crowd is fab and is mostly teenagers and youngsters in their early 20s.

Drinks : Decent. Weekdays prices are cheap and its lighter on the pocket. However, if you are going on weekends, it expensive as they change you rates are pretty steep without happy hours.

Hookah : Not really worth it.

Pocket pinch : From 700 per head to 2k depends on what you order.

PS : The concept of demand and supply is just a clever way of marketing. The base level prices are fixed and the rates change depending upon the the time of the day and the day it is not on actual demand and supply.

After hearing so much about this place, finally planned to come here. Dim lights and young vibes. Less on the food menu. We ordered potato wedges, pasta, mezze platter and veg grilled platter. The food was decent. The service for food was poor but they serve drinks in a blink of an eye. Nice and cozy. Would recommend this place for a nice chitchat over a few(read heartful) drinks.

It was my second visit to this place and just as the first time was a bit disappointed.

Its located on the block - D,5th floor,on the Westside building. As soon as we disembarked the lift,saw a group of people standing out. As soon as we were about to enter,we had been stopped and asked how many of us? Fortunately a friend had reached earlier which helped us to go inside the place. But boy,the person in the counter was RUDE and was raw in handling customers.

A very stupid thing they have,i noticed on my second visit as well was,the menu had two items Beer 1300 ml and Beer 3000 ml for a very lucrative rate. Just like the last time,it was unavailable and a regular visitor told that this was just for show. If this is a marketinfg strategy,totally thumbs down !!!

The staff inside were unhelpful,all busy in their own tune,totally turns you off and not want you to come again.

Coming to the good part, The music was soothing since kt was a bollywood evening but as far as i know on weekdays,they play classic English tracks till 8pm post which the DJ takes over.

This place has a dance floor,jenga blocks,beer pong to keep you entertained.

The interiors are pretty dim and the furniture is average. To order,you can dowload the app from playstore and you can order from your mobile,the server will confirm your order and will execute the same. It seemed pretty cool !!!

Totally new concept,although there is another place 1658 which has a same concept. I am yet to visit there,so might sound a bit biased.

Personally,i might give it another try,probably on a weekday,which might give me a better experience.

Worst is the sitting( I mean chairs are so uncomfortable) and service ufff ... They serve hot beer ... But second one is cold enough..... Sheesha is very average and they don't even change coal.... Owner's please take care otherwise your investment to build up such place is useless ....

Dumb place for dumb people. The guy waiting outside is a dumb. 2 years back this place used to be cool and happening. Now its just a bargain place whoever pays better money to the dumb guy standing outside goes inside other ones do not. So basically its for dumb people. Never want to visit again. If you really want to go inside do dress down. Girls should wear dresses that are way above their knee. Then only this cheapster watchman waiting outside the bar and will let you in. I am not a critic and I am not a drunk. I am just giving an honest review. Trust me on this. Not a place for literate respectable people.

The stupidest place ever.. Disgusting management.. The usher is very rude abrupt  & obnoxious Right from the time it was shisha it had a negative attitude . Every time we go they say no place ,  or waiting for 1-2 hours . They do this on purpose , we know. At times they say it's only for members.. Like seriously!!  
No harm in maintaining high echelon but they should see who they are spurning entry to..  Don't know what is that vexatious attitude for?

At the entry the lady said that we were not allowed and no 1 has talked to you on the phone and when we said you can check the call logs she said she dint need to. Then we asked some girls to get us in with them they agreed. When we went there again she said you guys came earlier in stags na i cant allow you. I mean what the hell was that. Literally a very very bad experience.

I had heard a lot about this bar and the way it had conceptualised a Stock Exchange Theme.
The Long Island Iced Tea Pitcher is a must have. Probably the best I've had in Calcutta after Mezzuna.
The rustic look that they have got going is pretty impressive.

The rates are quite appealing, but their revenue model is pretty strong. The rates are such that after a few drinks( when you start getting a little 'happy'), you end up ordering more in quantity. What they compromise in rates, they make up in quantity.

All in all, I don't think this is just another new outlet in the bandwagon of new bars cropping up, but probably a place which will displace the top bars in Calcutta.

Absolutely unethical and corrupt staff - Being a fan of the Mumbai bar stock exchanges, decided to visit the Kolkata version - You don't associate the word with a restaurant but the entry staff are downright 'corrupt' - claiming the bar was full (not allowing in couples) , pretty much allowing new walk-ins who knew the bouncers and the lady at the entry. Pathetic and disgusting is an understatement to describe the experience (Visited: March 5th)

You are a single guy? You are not allowed.
Group of guys looking for a place to hangout?
You are not allowed.
You are not a regular? You are not allowed.
Why the F have you opened a place in first place.
You are not even a disc!
Add to that the attitude of the front desk people.
They just don't care.
Keep your 'holier than thou attitude' to yourself guys.
As a patron/customer I expect a better response.
Although the bar stock exchange idea seemed so exciting this outlet disappointed me.
No wonder these guys have such an average rating.
Will never visit again.

Been to this place twice since it has opened.
The place is nice,the concept is good but the service is pathetic,the app which they have made shows beer tower and pitcher whose price is kept damn low around 400 and 170 but they won't serve it as they say that they don't have it so kindly remove that as you are manipulating the customers.
Another issue is that if you order a premium whiskey say jack Daniels but when you have it 
Any1 who knows the taste of jd would surely realise that it's not jd.This is not expected from a place like shisha.
And the last thing I would say is these people have the audacity to tell customers on a Saturday evening to make a bill of certain min. Amt or else they can't enter.
Whoever is running this place should get 1 thing straight that it's because of the customers that the place is running if you act so rude then there aren't any shortage other places to go.

Good place to hangout. The concept is innovative and nice. And owing to the concept you can get drinks @really affordable price. The only concern is seating could have been a little more comfy. However, when I went there we were 3, so a person told me that they've only seating capacities for 4 or 6, so we have to seat at the counter. Now this is not really done, it's like either you go in a group of 4 or 6, else get ready to sit at the counter. The music could have been a little loud. Overall a nice hangout place with affordable price keeping in mind the concept of fluctuating price.

Place is good so is the ambience. But the prices are not genuine. U show a price then add 30% as an unknown tax, then u add vat service tax etc etc. Bse is even expensive then the old shisha. A serious thumbs down people. A drink showing 292 gets billed at somewhere around 500-525, which is absolutely not worth it.

Have always been crazy about the BSE concept since I got to know about the Bombay one and Calcutta getting it's own BSE was my dream come true. 
The ambience along with the music is perfect. If you order wisely, you can have a great time drinking at really affordable prices. 
The food is average though. A must try dish would be the non veg platter.
If you have a gang, do play the beer pong and jenga.
Calcutta is getting better I must say!

PS: Before you visit, download their app and keep ordering therefrom. Swift and easy isn't it? ;)

I had heard really great things about this only BSE in Kolkata and decided to try it out last evening! For a Tuesday evening, the place was really full of people speaking a lot of it's popularity.

5/5 for the ambiance! The place is dimly lit with yellow lights over the tables. Loud music playing in the background accentuated the mood, especially since popular tracks were being played. They have a giant game of Jenga for people to play which is great fun! The bar looked really good and so did the well spaced tables and chairs.

3.5/5 for Service only because it always took some time to grab the staff's attention to place any order. A couple of times we had to inquire 2-3 times before the order came. But in general, the orders didn't take much time.

4/5 for Food and Beverages. The food menu is limited, but that's all right. It's pretty much a side dish menu. We had ordered Thai masala peanuts, BSE chips with dip, Fried Lotus Stems and Veggie Fingers Pizza. All of them were good. In cocktails we had ordered Mojito and LIIT pitcher. The pitcher was great and at that price, a real steal deal! But I was disappointed with the Mojito. It seemed to have excessive Lime Cordial. The best part though are the shots! They are really cheap!

Overall, I'd say this is a must visit place as it offers the Stock Exchange Menu which quite unlike anywhere else! The prefect place for having Shots with side dishes.
Do give it a try :-)

One of the very few places that would get a 5/5 rating from my end ! 

Shisha Bar Stock Exchange is the only BSE in Calcutta and boasts of great ambience and music. The place with dim lighting, a bar in the centre with bar stools around and raised seating is one of the best places to chill for youngsters.
The menu offers a wide range of alcohol and you're bound to find your poison amongst the offerings. However the food menu isn't as impressive.
The USPs of the place are : 
1. Beer Pong 
2. A huge Jenga 
3. It's a smoking zone ! 

I'm a super regular customer for the above reasons obviously however what deserves a special mention is the staff. 

Amin has been the star employee according to me who knows his drinks and always smiles and offers me the best of the lot. He knows how to sell and has amazing PR and he's kept in touch and made sure either me or my friends are there every weekend. He's an asset to the Bar and his hospitality has been one of the main reasons for my repeated visits with my friends 
People like Hemant and Abhishek have always welcomed me and ensured I've never faced any difficulties. 

The only disappointing part of the entire experience is that the alcohol rates fluctuate even when the outlet is closed which isn't possible so management please look into the issue. 

Nevertheless, great show put up by the management and staff. Kudos to the entire team !

Shisha bar stock exchange is in camac street, westside building. Entry here maybe a problem for people who are not regulars which is a little sad coz this place is really nice.

I visited this place twice in the last 5 days and had a great time . The food menu is quite restricted and only nibbles are available. Don't really go in expecting a good meal but surely go in expecting great booze great music and great time. We ordered for the non veg platter. I really liked the fish. In the drinks we had whiskey, liit and whiskey sour. Liit was nice, could be a bit stronger  and the whiskey sour was also great. We had a great time.

Went to Shisha with my friends on recommendation of my cousin. 
It has an interesting new concept of alcohol pricing. 
Perfect ambiance. 
Undoubtedly they had perfect collection of alcohol but they didn't have any mock tail. Personally for me it was awesome but for few of my friends who do not booze it was just mediocre. 
For booze lovers it's fantastic.

Awesome place, gr8 ambience, nice concept though was not new to me but new for Kolkata.. Staff members are good, especially Mr. Adhikary helped us a lot!! I was also happy in getting Bira, I actually went just to taste this. Only 1 complaint I have regarding this place is its food, no options, bad quality, soso taste -- need to improve with immediate effect!!

Shisha new look is quite good. Music, ambience and drinks are good. My choice was LIT which was worth it. On a crowded day bar tender takes a lot of time to give you a drink. We had to wait for 30 min to get our drinks. They should work on that.

Had gone there yesterday... ambiance is great... crowd tooo... staff courteous..... LIT is the good. shall visit again and recommend others also �to visit the place..... but the price never comes near MRP only... as in the concept in Mumbai is like the PRICES COME TO MRP ALSO N BELOW THAT TOO... thats the real fun of a concept like stock exchange... management has to place the concept correctly. ... bill of mumbai BSE enclosed.. . U cn find tge difference. ..

Went to Shisha with my friends on recommendation of my cousin. 
It has an interesting new concept of alcohol pricing. 
Perfect ambiance. 
Undoubtedly they had perfect collection of alcohol but they didn't have any mock tail. Personally for me it was awesome but for few of my friends who do not booze it was just mediocre. 
For booze lovers it's fantastic.

Shisha-Bar Exchange...is probably one of the coolest place i have been to in Kolkata...am not sure if any other place in the city still have this concept of alcohol pricing.I went there on a wednesday evening and to my surprise the place was quite full...i only tried one chicken dish...i don't even remember the name anymore but it tasted good..no clue about the other food items...but the ambience and the music was good...loved this place.

Experience was awesome. Ambience is superb. Bang on with the Bar Stock Exchange Concept. But would be delighted If they improve the quality of service a bit.

It's a bittersweet experience seeing the old sheesha completely re-done. Ambiance is good and the music is a delight for us 90s kids. The service rrally needs to be stepped-up. It is slow and sloppy and completely kills the mood. Menu needs to be expanded. The existing items are very good in taste though.

Stocks are rising and falling. Well this might be the wall street of liquors and quite innovative as well. Orders are placed over here from the Shisha-Bar stock exchange app where people see the current value of the desired liquor.
Music is very loud and quite good for party lovers. There are few games as well and if you are a bunch of homies then its a very good place to hangout with them. So overall its a great place only if the seats, the lighting and the ambiance are improved.

The latest incarnation of shisha..bar exchange sits absolutely high on snob value. No consideration for guests at all no matter their attire their behaviour how far a distance they have travelled and won't budge on their policies even if you are accompanied by ladies. Apparently they allow only regulars and club members. The Big catch?? They won't allow who's new. Sir we only allow regulars or if you're accommpanied by a regular. I mean profile screening is good but doing it in such a moronic way is not. Management if you don't allow people inside how exactly can they become regulars? Well the smart Alec manager at the entry has that query solved too.."sir come with a regular". This is pathetic move on the managements side to increase the snob value of the place unnecessaryily under the pretext of profile screening. They even have the audacity to suggest "There are plenty of pubs nearby sir". Two thumbs down to this place. Plenty of better places to party in Kolkata. Avoid.. Unless you are a regular or accompanied by a regular or a member else you'll just get insulted.

The place is nice.. The ambiance is good but the service is not at all up to the mark. Maybe because its a new place.

However, I was really happy to see the app of BSE, but the funny part for was that I was showing the app to my friend at 10:00 AM in the morning and the price was still fluctuating. The price fluctuating when the bar is closed itself breaches the whole concept of bar stock exchange. I request the authorities to look into the matter asap !
