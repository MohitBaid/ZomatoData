This place is my go to place when it comes to a quick bite and coffee. It's pocket friendly, has a moderately good ambience. The food is okay-ish. But the coffee is great! I mostly prefer cafe latte and dancing chocolate. But last time i tasted chocolate frappe and it was the best!

The place being very close to my house, I have been there twice with my friends. Initially I was attracted to it when I saw their extensive menu, which is quite unusual for a small caf√© like this one. It falls on the same line as the baguiati KFC and the supermarkets. The place is neither too big nor too small, it has around 6-8 tables. The tables are too small and I found the chairs to be a little uncomfortable. Ambience wise it is quite average, though the place is dimly lit which is soothing. It has a side with a glass wall facing the V.I.P. street but after the renovation of the streets, the glass wall view is half obstructed. Coming to the staff, none of them are trained but that was not an issue. But the first time, they took more than 25 minutes to give us the food, so the service is quite slow. First time we went in the evening and ordered 'Chocolate frappe', 'Dancing chocolate', and 'Chicken tikka pizza'. The frappe came with a scoop of ice-cream on top. The dancing chocolate had chocolate sprinkles. In my opinion, the frappe was a little bitter and I liked the dancing chocolate better. The quantity of the drinks was a lot. The pizza was average, did not enjoy it.
The second time we visited during the noon and ordered 'chicken burger' and caf√© frappe'. The burger bread was too bad, otherwise it was okay, and the drinks were okay too. They did charge a tax amount of 6% but that was before GST.
So in my opinion, average place with average food, slow service. I liked their drinks, plus not at all heavy on the pocket.

Situated just beside Big Bazaar outlet, Baguiati and frequently haunt among locals, students and bachelors.

AMBIENCE: Its a not too big cafe but arrangements is very proper. Most beautiful thing is the glass wall that gives the view of the surroundings. The bibliophiles would be very much disappointed as there is book printed wallpapers instead of real books kept. Overall the ambience was soothing.

SERVICE: Nothing much to write about the service but its pretty slow.

FOOD: Price is much higher than the quantity it gives. I have ordered Chicken sandwich, which was not very tasty as they have put much mayonise and very little amount of chicken pieces, its when I visited here 1st time. On my 2nd visit I ordered Chicken pakoras, which was just satisfactory in taste. Its mostly coated with cornflour and other items than chicken itself.

Overall experience at Coffee is satisfactory.

LOCATION: Situated near joramondir just below the big bazaar outlet it is a frequent haunt among locals & students alike.
AMBIENCE: The ambience is soothing due to the glass wall but the seating capacity is very less. Though I appreciate the books painted as the wallpaper ; it would have been better if there were actual books too.
SERVICE: It is nothing to write home about but it is a little slow.
MENU: There's all the regular cafe fare available on the menu with sandwiches; pastas & cold coffees. The pricing is on the higher side but is lower than the other cafes nearby.
FOOD: The dancing chocolate was great with perfectly brewed cold coffee, ice cream & chocolate shavings on top. It is just perfect for Indian summers. But the quantity served was not much compared to the price taken.

Coffee as the name says. It was my first visit to this food outlet and I was not at all disappointed for choosing this place to hangout with my darling üòÅ
Detailed review : 
Location : situated near baguihati bigbazar. The name is written in a unique way with its last letter ending in Bengali ' e'. 
Ambiance and staff : it's a small cozy joint with dimmed lighting. Ambience is nice . Designer lanterns were hanging and the guy over there was extremely polite and well behaved. 
Food : I mainly went there for sandwiches as I am a big fan of sandwiches. We settled for club sandwiches which had 2 layers : one layer of cucumber and tomatoes and the top layer of chicken and egg. Quantity was perfect for two and the sandwich was nice in taste. Next we ordered for mushroom cheese pizza which was also tasty and had topping of mushroom in good quantity. We had mango magic and dancing chocolate as coolers on side.  The taste of mango magic was more of mango ice-cream I found. But anyways good in taste and refreshing. 
The prices of the items were also pocket friendly and worthy of spending. 
Con : they charge extra for grilling and also the amount of cheese in pizza was lacking. 
Overall good experience. Looking forward for more visit. Thank you.

This is a nice place just beside Big Bazar, near Baguiati. This place is kind of my go to place considering it's very near to my house. I have been there a couple of times and I've tried their Cafe latte, Cappuchino, Corn and Cheese Sandwiches, French fries and my favourite Dancing Chocolate. 

The Cafe latte is pretty good. The sandwiches are also pretty tasty. The french fries are nothing special and they dont offer any dips or anything just the french fries but in a good amount. 

The Dancing Chocolate is a kind of cold coffee with a blend of chocolate. But it is extremely tasty and good. But the availability might be an issue.

 In short this is a cozy place, pocket friendly and dim lit with pretty looking lanterns.

I had been a frequent visitor of this place, but yesterday was a disaster. The duration for serving the food was much longer than anticipated. Quality of coffee frappe was ok and pasta satisfied our taste buds. The problem was with the chicken pakora which was stale and also uncooked. My suggestion don't visit the this place after 8 in the night, there might be shortage of staffs and in the process everything gets delayed.

There's a bit of a nostalgia attached to this place since this is the only proper cafeteria in the Baguihati VIP Road area and is a bliss for the residents. 
There is nothing fancy or extraordinary about this cafe but has a casual-comfy setting. And if you want to catch up with friends, discuss over studies or business matter with colleagues...this place is a big YES! Also one prefers to relax here after a tedious shopping at big bazar which is just next to this cafe.
This cafe is almost seven years old and I have witnessed all the changes they have introduced and how much they have improved. 
One can expect well blended and brewed coffee's and shake and subtle flavoured food. Black current, Mango magic, dancing chocolate are my personal favourites. Also they are best in pasta and noodles. ‚ù§Ô∏èüòä

This small coffee shop is situated near bigbazar. We visited this place on a weekday afternoon, it was almost empty. This is a small cozy place, with pretty good decor and ambiance. Whole shop was filled with roasted coffee aroma.

We ordered dancing chocolate, special coffee and a meaty surprise sandwich.

Both the drinks was awesome, price was cheap. We like the presentation of the drinks very much. It was served in mason jars.

Sandwich was also good. It was filled with chicken pieces, sausage and salami.

Overall we enjoyed our visit to this place. And we will definitely visit again.

We ordered a Cheese Salami Pizza, a Egg Chicken Haka Noodle, and Expresso Latte Coffee. The Pizza was well made with Cheese, Salami, Capsicum, Onion and Tomato Sauce. The Haka Noodle was good in quantity had ample pieces of Chicken and Egg Scrambled, sufficient for 2 people. Finally the Coffee was served hot with Sugar Free Sachets to save the CALORIES... overall a good place to chill and have a good time with friends and better half.

Stopped by for a Red Bull. Asked for it with ice. Was billed for a Red Bull and for an Ice Cream Sundae. When I pointed out the discrepancy, the waiter kept insisting that I had to pay it, then the guy at the front desk tells me that it's my fault, because no one's ever ordered a Red Bull with ice before.¬†

So, basically, since he wanted to charge me for ice and couldn't figure out how to put it into the machine, he billed me for a sundae, then kept screaming at me that this was my fault for daring to order a Red Bull with ice.¬†

A friend was waiting for me in an Uber, so I didn't have time to fight them over this. I'd never go back.

This one is located beside the Big Bazar at Baguihati and is one of my fav coffe shops. The decor is nice and the lighting and seating is cozy. The omlettes here are a must for all. We started with Chicken Salami and Cheese Omlette and Chicken Sausage and Cheese Omlette along with Black current shake and Chocolate Shake. The molten cheesse whih comes out whn you cut the omlette is just too yummy. We finally ended with Chicken Salad and Penni Pasta (White Sauce) which were als quite tasty.

The only drawback I would say is the service people. They're warm enough but would like them to be a bit more professional.

A must visit for sure.

I've just been to this cafe and it blew me away. Situated just beside Baguiati Big Bazar, Coffee is a small cafe that serves continental and Chinese as well. The d√©cor is simple but and the outlet is clean. It is well decorated and has dim lighting. 28 people can be accommodated at once.
The menu is quite colorful and is oozing with flavoursome beverages. In addition to different beverages they serve ice creams, soups, pastas, sandwiches, noodles, pakoras etc. I tried their chicken pakoras and it was yum. They add chat masala while garnishing and it works great for the dishes. They make Wonderful pasta and the crispy chilli babycorn is also superb. We also ordered chocolate frappe and a hazelnut frappe and both were superb.
The only real problem I had was the fact that the delivery was very slow indeed.
I am visiting this place again. Real soon.

This place is a welcome caf√© amidst many prime restaurants and cheap eateries. Place is a bit compact, even by a caf√©'s standards. The ambience is good though, gives you a genuine feel of a coffee shop; with book wallpapers and good decor. 

Coming to the food, I have tried veg pizza here which was way better than most other non branded pizzerias provide. Burgher and sandwich were big disappointments. Though the price is very competitive, the bread quality failed to satisfy me. 

Advice: you can definitely go there to hang out with your friends and try the variety of items that the place offers. Customer service is good!

Coffee is a small cafe with a simple decor and quick bites. Walked in to this place with very less time in hand. 

Location: Located just beside Big Bazar in Baguihati. 

Ambience: Simple decor, neat and tidy.

Food: Took a Special Coffee which was really good. Thick, chocolaty and nicely blended with vanilla ice cream. It was a delight. The Chicken Cheese Grilled Sandwich was another item which was really well made. Good amount of chicken and cheese which was made me happy. Both the items were nice.

Last Words: Recommended

The name of the restaurant would suggest it to be a coffee shop or a beverage parlour close to Big Bazar that brews coffee for customers. Though I didn't have any of the beverage, I had munched on a chicken & cheese sandwich and vegetable sandwich from this eatery. The sandwiches weren't anything superbly fantastic or anything, but simple tasting enough. For snacky eatables this is a cool cafe to try out.

Well this place is almost like the poorer,less famous cousin of bon appetit.The cocktail platter which is their best selling item has an English breakfast feel with a chinese twist that is the chicken sausages and salamis are tossed in a yummy garlic-y sauce . Surprisingly it tastes awesome.The hazelnut frappe is a clear winner too considering it's price.The meat lover's sandwich should be given a miss because frankly it was a bland mess.

Situated just beside VIP Big Bazar outlet, this place is a small cafe with nice & cozy ambience. First thing that's worth mentioning about this place is the decor,nice wallpapers,lights and well placed tv which make this a great cafe to spend time in leisure. The menu consists of a variety of coffees and both hot/cold beverages, and also wide variety of continental items. We had their chicken cocktail platter,which had salamis,sandwiches, poached egg and sausages, with that we ordered the chocolate frappe. The platter was delicious, and enough for two, the frappe though not "CCD" standard but was sure value for money.Shall visit again soon for trying out other beverages.

The place is cozy and small but there was one big drawback 'waiters' they don't know English nor Hindi and the way they we're talking as if they we're the owners not waiters. Their attitude was no less then Celebs who were busy chatting among themselves and watching some weird movies "such a huge turn off". I ordered Cheese Sandwich,  Hakka Chowmein and Garlic Cheese Bread. The food was good no doubt that's why this cafe bagged 3points from me.

This place is very underrated. People seem to have strange expectations and strange demands that can't be met by this modest cafe. All I have to say is, I highly recommend it. Cheap continental food is hard to come by, and this place pulls it off quite well.
Location: Just beside Big Bazar  (left, ground floor.)
Ambience: Yes, it's small. Yes, there are no sofas. But the AC works very well and there is also a television where you can watch matches. Topped off with yellow lighting - I quite liked it.
Food: We ordered Fish steak with chicken salad, Chicken sausage and cheese omelette and a Cool blue drink.  
I loved the fish, though it was a teeny bit overcooked. There was no thick coating -- basa marinated in mustard and other spices. This was served with a simple chicken salad with mayonnaise and veggies. 
The omelette had a really nice cheese filling that didn't become gluggy on cooling. Amount of sausage was a tad less, but acceptable for what they charge. Also, it needed a bit of pepper.
The drink was more on the sour than the sweeter side, but quantity was good -- a whole mug. And for a summer evening, it was perfect.
Cost: Prices on the  menu are inclusive of VAT, exclusive of service charge. Our bill came to Rs. 352, including everything.

I will go back there again very soon. Few things really impressed me: everything they had on the menu was available. Also, service was relaxed, but good. We weren't left sitting with dirty dishes. This is a surprising little joint: where else would you get Continental around here at this price? Give Bon Appetit a rest for a while and give this place a try.

A small place near baguihati bigbazar.d food quality is ok.d coffe is gd.bt dont expect ccd or barista like coffee.d pizza breads r mostly made of bricks with a little amount of cheese sprinkled over it.toppings cn b easily found if u r using magnifying glasses. Their combos r ,though, recomandable.and yes the chicken steak is vry good.most of the time they cnt provide u chillers mentioned in their menus.d service is way to slow.d only shinning penny is tht this is a budget friendly hang out and mostly preferable to school or college goers
Edit: On a second visit with much hunger in my stomach after a whole day of shopping I went there with my brother and ordered Mixed Fried Rice , Chilli Chicken and garlic chicken. The food wasn't that good but that's not the point. There was a piece of GLASS in the fried rice that I bit into!!!! Never ever am I visiting there. And I would suggest others not to do it if they don't wanna accidentally die having their lunch!!

A quaint place which gives you the opportunity to sit down and relax for some time over coffee and sandwiches. Sandwiches are good, as well as most of the coffee options. The place also gives you a list of interesting daily specials which you can explore if you are an adventurous spirit. Sticking to coffee and sandwiches is a good idea, and I would particularly not recommend the pizza, which is usually chewy and greasy.

I'll give it a 3, not taking away the fresh food it serves, food wise it's good but the main thing of a coffee joint has to be the coffee itself. I don't think it's up to the mark in that area, I was looking for a little more variety and quality, also improvement in presentation also required to stay in competition. Price wise and food wise I was impressed. Also a nice attire to this small and comfy joint. Service is another thing that needs improvement, I don't know I was unlucky or service is that slow. In a coffee joint, you expect your drinks to come right away, anyway that's just a suggestion. Overall not a bad place to hangout but could be much better. Best of luck to management.

I cannot count the innumerable times I have visited this coffee joint. Sometimes it was my wish, sometimes I have been compelled to as my friend staying in baguihati tried to show her tantrums and was adamant not to leave her native place. This one is near the big bazaar baguihati.  Honestly, i love this place. Its cheaper than other coffee shops. At least the tax they charge is quite pocket friendly. I love the decor. The red chandeliers hanging, the guitar, the ambience, the photographs of the intellegensia of bengal. Amazing nostalgic coffee house type ambience recreated. What the major problem is that these staffs give you too much off time to decide what you want to eat and the service is so god damn slow that your hunger eventually dies. But then you realise the food is yumm and that calls for your appetite back to the table. Well I have eaten whole range of items. Among refreshers, i have tasted the cool blue, virgin lemon and the iced tea. The virgin lemon is quite good, the iced tea is bad and the cool blue tastes like you should better opt for a sprite instead. However the coffees are excellent. But mostly the hazelnut frappe is out of stock. But I love the irish frappe amazingly rich creamy and fresh. The dancing chocolate and thr minted blast tastes a bit out of the way. But the best is ofcourse the coffee special. Amazing I must admit. The sandwiches they make are quite good. Loved the chicken salami and cheese sandwich. Among thr deep fried, the chicken garlic finger with mustard dip is worth a try. The sizzling white pasta is amazing. Try out thr cocktail sausages if you want to go for something light. But amazing are their platters. The chicken cocktail platter is a delight. The egg poach. I love coffee for this. The grilled steak with mushroom is excellent. A must try. The chinese is good as well. The pan fried chilli chicken and the chilli blast chicken chopsuey can make a non-foodie lull over food. Getting continental food near baguihati is unimaginable and that too such good a preparation attracts you to this place too frequently.  Now that I have seen them have introduced dessert section , I am running back to coffee again.

Average place for a cup of coffee and some snacks in the evening. They do provide a satisfactory range of snacks. Overall the food is good but their service needs to improve.

quick review: not a good place if you want to have only beverages. they don't provide. you must take a snack with the order if you still don't want to have them. just experienced this few weeks ago.

This is not a place for a quick bite, you can have one outside at the counter, but it's better you don't opt for that.

Come to this nice eatery with some time at your hand and in the mood for some good conversation.

The order usually takes time to be served, even the coffee is not presented at the table instantly, but the waiting is worth it.
The quality and quantity both are maintained proportionately at quite a reasonable enough price.
Try out the milk shakes, the chicken cocktail platter is a must.

Nice place for a light conversation with your loved ones and friends.

A very good place for the pocket friendly people living near VIP road or closer cause it provides some lip smacking dishes and hot as well as cold drinks in Italian ,Chinese and continental variations.
And talking about the atmosphere inside is just superb as you get the semi luxury feeling with nice decor around and dim lights at night .
My verdict - One should hop in if you are near VIP big bazaar cause its just located beside it.

Nice place to hang out with friends or gf/bf..Food is quite good and cheap. Most of the dishes are within hundred bucks. The beverages are the best part of this joint with both cold and hot drinks equally tasty. The chicken salad and the sandwiches also stands out.

Located just beside the busy lanes of V.I.P. Road is Coffee. Probably one of the best go-to destinations for people living in this side of the city, the place is ideal for a nice round of gossip with a bunch of friends. Inside it has about half a dozen of tables in a small room and it also has a couple of tables on the outside. The place is usually busy during the evenings. The food served here is pretty good and a few recommendations would be Grilled Chicken Breasts, Double Chicken Burger etc. The coffee here is great and cheap as well and definitely gives Cafe Coffee Day a run for its money. One of my turn offs about this place would be the frequent unavailability of some of the dishes mentioned in the menu. Another would be the slow service. So in a nutshell the best thing about the place is the reasonable price backed with the mouth-watering food, Coffee will be one of my favourite haunts for the foreseeable future.

Ambiance: 3
Service: 3
Food: 4.5
Value for money: 5

200 meters from my house , I visit almost every alternate day while coming back from gym, who knows this place better than me ! :P

AMBIANCE AND SERVICE :
The ambiance is not somethng great to talk about , pretty small place with 8-9 small tables , Two wall mounted AC's and Two LCD's at both ends. The cooling is not efficient specially around the afternoon when the sun hits the cafe floor through clear glass. And they dont keep the ac on throughout, If there is no one inside , they will turn the ac off, thus making you wait  for 10 minutes before it cools . The cafe can bee seen from VIP road , and situated below MEGAMART and Between Big bazaar , Bazaar Kolkata and Vishal outlets .The road to enter big bazaar is very near to this cafe, and you will find people doing Peek-A-Boo's and when you are with you girlfriend or someone special , you wont like that thing for sure. Waiters are good though .

POSITION : 
Its perfectly positioned beside VIP road within 50 feet from the road. 

PARKING : 
Not available . Risk it by parking beside the road if you have a car.

FOOD :
I crave for the GRILLED CHICKEN STEAK WITH MUSHROOM TOPPINGS AND SALAD . which comes around 180 bucks . Perfect meal after working out for me. You can have it whenever you want though ! haha! perfectly grilled two pieces of chicken steak with mushroom topping and barbeque sauce . Served with tossed salad with white sauce. OH i love that !.
The beverages are OK type, not something worth writing words about. The lemonade was kind of good.
 
A good joint if you are coming here with 2-3 friends and looking for a timepass . I find it better than CCD though . 

CHEERS !

While the food isn't bad here, I've had a horrible experience with the waiters. A waiter served us the wrong dish and after we'd begun eating and realized it, we tried to point it out. They had the audacity to tell us on our faces that we should've recognized it just by looking at it and should be paying for the dish we'd originally ordered but never received. This is theo nly place in town I've stormed out of, and don't plan on visiting in the near future.

Its good to seat by the busy VIP rd in the cool and comfortable environment, u hv option to seat outside too.The food is good, we tried coctail sizzler and chicken tossed salad, along with dancing chocolate and mango shake.Although the mango shake seemed made of synthetic juice , the other stuff were really worth the money. The menu given here is an old one I guess as yesterday I saw few more dishes and the price also difffer from this one. Over all it's a nice experience.

some people survive for the smell of cigarettes while others for coffee. i live for coffee. It is easily my first love beating any other food. and yes my tastebuds are still angry with me for taking even a sip of what this place calls coffee. believe me when i say i tried very hard not to gag. The sludge passed up for coffee didnt even smell like coffee. I know Coffee is supposed to taste bitter but this thing reminded my friend and me of KARA(medicine. i would probably rate this place in negative but for its excellent location. There is nothing like a cup of coffee after a long day of shopping in all the storesbeside this cafe. But i seriously hope that if ever again i gather up the courage to visit this place i will be able give it some rating
