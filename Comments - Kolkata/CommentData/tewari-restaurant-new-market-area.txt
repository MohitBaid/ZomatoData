One of the common place to eat in esplanade. Decor is not so eye's pleasing. Budget resto and quality of the food is like street food. Yes you can try juices and soda sikanji in this hot weather.

One of the worst restaurant I ever had. We were very hungry so just down from the bus and very happy to see the pure veg restaurant and its name. Location is very good just opposite of Big Bazaar. Very poor decor, service very slow, stuff are old and not skilled or dedicated at all. Now come to main thing food. Alur paratha is not good consider okaish type but matter panir is horrible in test and look and blackish.  Items are costly, not cheep . Jaan hai to jahan hai and we Dont have enough gut to eat so leave the food and place  after paying the bill with horrible experience that matter panir may test like this. Any way not recommended for even for enemy. 
They also serve rotten food to the another customer at the same time. But they accept their mistake and provide fresh one. This type of restaurant should be closed bcoz they are playing with customer health and hard earned money and spoiled the mood.

A pure vegetarian restaurant. But not well maintained and a poor deco. Had paneer butter masala after seen a review at zomato but was not impressed by the food quality.

This restaurant is located in esplandade area a, adjacent to regal cinemas. They serve pure vegeterian dishes and only one of its kind in this area. The joint is not at all well maintained and the decors and everything quite shabby in appearance. It is moderately spacious and can accomodate around 20 people easily at a time. Being a complete vegeterian restaurant their offerings are though limited, like- pulao, daal, paneer etc. But it is quite good with the palette. So for the vegeterians out there along with the non-veg folks during those holistic and festival days when non-veg is prohibited this is somewhere you csn stop by to enjoy a good meal in a reasonable rate.
