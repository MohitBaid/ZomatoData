This place is located below James Residency on Steelways Bus stop near Sakherbazar. The food here is overpriced and the quality is not up to the mark. I have been to this place a number of times since it is very near to my home but the quality have deteriorated with every passing day. One should not waste his/her hard earned money on this shitty place.

It is quite interiorly located in Sakherbazar. I had no plans to visit this joint but was taken there by my cousins. They tried hookah- water base strawberry flavoured. I don't do hookah so i thought it was a complete waste of my time but then came the complimentary dry chicken. That was really tasty and had almost 6 pieces. Then due to my request, we ordered chilli chicken (10 pieces) which costed about 250. It's definitely not a good family restaurant but is suitable for sudden hangouts.

It was a good place once. Food quality had dropped. Prices are a whole lot higher now. Service is okay. Interior is fine. It's located a bit interior. Can improve.

Back when we moved to this locality, it was still in its "developing" stage. So there were hardly any options for eating out. So when V3 opened we all went there quite eagerly, not knowing what to expect.
We found a place which was tiny in size but decorated well enough more or less and most importantly, very clean. The orchid on the table was an added bonus. 
The food was a 3.5/4 but the portion sizes were tiny. Now with the flooding in of new joint at every street n corner V3 is a forgotten, "Once upon a time" kinda place....

I had asked for a home delivery from this joint and I haven't seen such as pathetic food. Ordered Sweet corn soup, tandoori chicken, Kadai murg and nan.

The taste of each of the food is just awful. I am not a big fan of hukkah but can go to the joint only for that. For the rest, food is a strict no for me from this joint.
