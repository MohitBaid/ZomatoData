The beef biriyani is just heavenly. The service is quite rapid as well. Value for money. Overall a good experience. Would definitely recommend the kababs.

This is a place I have been eating since I can remember......the place and its interior is nothing to talk about i accept....but when u come to the food part....its awesome....price is cheap also.....try the tikia paratha, chanp, dal gosht, firni, biryani, seekh kabaab....if u eat beef....u simply can't afford to miss this place...!!!

this is one of the cheapest and best beef joint in Kolkata. taste is remarkably good. but due to old interior, hygiene is not upto the mark. I'll suggest to the fellow visitors to try beef chap and paratha!
