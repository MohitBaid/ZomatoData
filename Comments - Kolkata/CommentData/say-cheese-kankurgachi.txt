I had a cheesy experience at Say Cheese today. I was low on Budget yet craving for some cheese and chicken. So I tried their Cheese and chicken sandwich and chicken barbeque pizza. The cheese and chicken sandwich was served with french fries and sauce on the side. They served us four sandwiches which was hot, tasty, cheesy and filling. The fries were well seasoned and crisp. Coming to the pizza, it tasted average. There was ample amount of chicken pieces on the pizza, thin crust and not much cheesy. It tasted moderately fine and pocket pinch was okay.

We had BBQ chicken pizza. It was a thin crust pizza, topped with bbq chicken, tomatoes and capsicum and grated cheese. It wasn't a cheese burst pizza.... Overall it was really yummy but not the best....

This is one of the decent places to eat in Mani square food court. We tried their chicken steak sizzler in which they serve stuffed chicken. The sizzler was tasty and flavourful. Overall it's better than the other options available there.

Located at Mani square food court. Being a frequent visitor of Mani square, I've tried the food from this joint numerous times. Totally love their sizzlers...especially chicken steak house sizzler. 
The pizzas are good too.

We ordered mixed sauce pasta. Considering the price is wasn't that great. Maybe the butterflies in stomach led the pasta taste really good. The food was served pretty quick. 
We also got some packed, but it was done very badly. Regret getting it packed from the outlet. As a customer, I am ready to pay a price only if I get a corresponding utility, however there was such utility in this outlet. Maybe you can give it a one time try

Mani square's food court is one of the busiest malls bounded with food courts in Kolkata.Say Cheese is a pocket friendly food hub.Starters are better than the main course.I ordered a sizzler named Chicken Basiculum,it was almost burnt.Chicken chunks were less in number and the Rice served with the sizzler was without any extra spice.It was just okay type.

Tasted the Garlic fish sizzler recently.When I ordered the sizzler I expected it to be the continental version of galic sauce covered fish but this was more of a Chinese sizzler.The taste of the sauce was nice,not too sweet and a bit spicy.Fresh chunks of 5 to 6 pieces of basa fried to a crisp coated with a thick sauce.But the noodle bed below the fish was so much doused in sauce that it was difficult to have it.We almost left all the portion of noodles.

Its located in mani square food court. Its my favourite eatery whenever i crave for sizzlers and steak. Have tried almost everything barbecue chicken, mexican chicken for starters ...steaks and sizzlers are its speciality. The steak is best which comes with stuffed chicken. Pasta and pizza is average. But i would suggest this restro for continental food. :)Rohit Shaw

The outlet situated at the Food Court of Mani square Mall! It was the only only in the food court that offer Pizza, Sizzlers, Pasta etc.

We were there during Poila Boisakh Festival few days ago and ordered Non Veg Pasta with White Sauce and Margherita Pizza(7")!

Pasta - Ok, in one word! Quantity was sufficient but the sauce was the mixture of White and Red sauce! Too much grevy was there but overall good! You can try it!

Pizza - I will stop for 5sec to call it pizza, what they serve us! It was sliced into 4 part and the crust was so hard and dry, I should call it Chapati, instead of Pizza! Now comes about toppings, make yourself lucky if you find and cheese or Margherita! That take 10min to make it but don't know that they did in mean time! One of the worst pizza I have ever tried!

In conclusion, I would recommend everyone just go for Pasta only! It is the only thing that can satisfy your taste buds!

I was just going through all the stalls available there when this came to my notice. I always try the pasta dish (if available) at almost every restaurant I visit. The pasta at Say Cheese is very reasonable and they provide a quantity that is enough for two people. The taste is perfect, the sauce and cheese and chicken are very well blend. Will surely drop in here anytime I am in Mani Square.

Say Cheese is another hub in the food court of Mani Square. They serve sandwich, pizza, salad, pasta & beverages on their quite simple menu. Tried their below options but wasn't very impressive.

Veg Margherita Pizza 7" : This pizza was one of the most worst I've tried in my life. 4 slices of this pizza was small & looked very ordinary. Talking about toppings their was a layer of fried cornflower on top of it, in place of cheese & margherita. Crust was hard & of extreamly low qualiy. Bread & butter actually tastes better than this.

Non Veg Pasta in White Sauce : Pasta on the other hand looked very delicious but with a little more gravy. It was a mixed pasta with penne & fusilli. Chicken, capsicum & tomato were well found & tasted good. Gravy was cheesy & tasted somehow good but a little rich spices were present.

Pricing of this place is as per mall food court standards. I wouldn't say it very affordable or good option, but their pasta can be tried once. Don't try their pizza will be the only recommendation.

Tried out the garlic fish sizzler today... Really loved it!!! The fish was lightly fried and cooked with a delicious red sauce... It was soft and tender but you could still get that beautiful lightly fried fish flavour mixed with the sauce... It was perfect... It was laid out on a bed of noodles... And as usual u get that amazing burnt cabbage smell you get in sizzlers... The whole thing just came out perfect... Plus it was really filling...

This is situated at the food court of mani square. Ordered the chicken sizzler from their menu... and the food was served after 10mints only. The sizzler contained chicken steak,rice and breads with veggiea. There were two big pieces of chicken steak...which was tasty and flavourful. The amount of rice was also good..light but tasty dish. So overall the sizzler was yummy and tastrful far better than the sizzler I had at south city. Will gv this place a next visit soon.

"Say cheese" is a food court inside mani square ... it has a name for its delicious Italian foods...
We ordered 
Chicken Italiano Pizza and 
Crispy Chinese Chicken Sizzler

The food was tasty ... specially the sizzler was a bit different than normal and really spicy and delicious...
You also can talk with the Chef for suggestions about the foods...
#Try the sizzlers...
Edit:- Now the second time I had their food... and changed the rating from 4 to 4.5... I really liked the sizzlers here... they are tasty, spicy ... the difference here is they make sizzler which are perfect for an indian spicy test buds... not like real Italian one... 
This time We had 
Spicy Thai Sliced Chicken Sizzler
Chicken The Texas Pizza 
Cafe Mocha

Sizzler was luscious and spicy... Pizza 
was also tasty and it had very crunchy crust which I liked a lot... Cafe Mocha was coffe with chocolate and it was ok...
#Definitely a best one among mani square

Tried this place for the first time. The name surely gives you the meaning of both the food and smile on your face after having their stuffs. Located at the food court Mani Square Mall where Baishakhi Blast 2016 was going on where you get everything ata low low price of Rs. 61/- only. This is a Â place where you get lot of choices and certainly make you puzzled what yo eat and what to leave.
We had only two to choose from this outlet so we went for BBQ Chicken Pizza and choice of Pasta (Non Veg).
BBQ Chicken Pizza was very impressive. Thou the crust of bread was a bit hard but overall taste wise it was quite good. Filled with cheese, onion, capsicum, tomato and mini pieces of BBQ chicken spreaded all over was something delighted us.
Whereas Non Veg Pasta disappointed us. Made in white sauce it was not upto the mark. Looked very pale from the above and equally dry. Not the pasta we looked for to be honest.

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

This is another joint from which I never ordered anything before as I had a belief that pizza and pasta will not be up to the mark but the magic of rs 61 offer came as a boon and I took it in my advantage. I had the courage to try out their food which I already knew would not be worth it and I was unfortunately correct. We ordered deluxe chicken 7" pizza. It was served very fast which was a good thing but the taste was horrible. It did not have enough seasoning with no salt. The pizza only had one taste that was of sweetness. It had few micro mini pieces of chicken, little bit of cheese and the crust was the only decent thing. My risk taking adventure in mani square ended yesterday and I would prefer sticking to very few food joints here.

'Say Cheese'  was my third stop today in the 'Mani Square Blast'  in the omni-popular Mani Square Food Court. I was very eager to try this outlet for a long time. Finally I got the chance today. I ordered a non-veg chicken barbeque 7" pizza with extra chesse and extra barbeque chicken. The person who was taking the order was a rude one.His uncouth  behaviour is one of the reasons that I am not visiting this store again. The  pizza took ten minutes to arrive. The pizza was okayish in taste.It was bland in taste.They should have given chilli flakes and paprika with the pizza. I am never visiting this store again.

In my expedition of trying different types and cuisines in the various places in kolkata, I have come across many joints which are not that hyped like the famous and rich restaurant chains. But when talking about the quality of food they definitely deserve flying colors in the hat they are wearing which have been built with their continued zeal for excellence and customer satisfaction. "SAY CHEESE" is definitely stays on top of this list. Located in the food court of Mani Square, this place is mainly famous for their continental preparations. This evening, me and my friend

We kind of wanted to have something really cheesy and without any carbohydrate, so we opted for grilled chicken pasta.. Though the taste was good, it came with a large amount of gravy kind of white sauce like cream cheese pasta only served with bread. The quantity was really good as per the price and we appreciate that. It would have been better if they could make a dry white sauce tossed veggie and chicken salad.

I have ordered from this outlet in mani square a few times. Mainly Italian food. N I'd say the taste and quality of food is pretty good. The pasta in white sauce is one of my favourites. The ceasar salad is quite nice. But my best has to be the chicken steak sizzler. Tiny diced veggies and chicken bits packed in a sheet or chicken filet to make the perfect steak, served sizzling hot. Quite a treat to the taste buds as well. The spicy Thai chicken sizzler was my latest try and I was quite pleased with the distinctive yet appropriate use of coconut in the Thai curry. Served with an ample amount of noodles, a single dish is quite enough for two. However the service here is exceptionally slow. That needs a bit of improvement. But overall a nice place. Would like to try more items.

I love these place in Mani square food court only because they serves sizzlers... although there sizzlers are little different, something like gravy chicken dishes with noodles or rice in the sizzling tray... but whatever I like there Spicy Thai chicken and roasted chicken sizzler... staffs are good... nothing special about deco... pocket pinch was acceptable...

In mani square food court if u want good pasta this is surely the joint. Pasta made fresh at the counter and served. Very good taste, quality and quantity. One portion is good for two people. Surely recommend.

We kind of wanted to have something really cheesy and without any carbohydrate, so we opted for grilled chicken pasta.. Though the taste was good, it came with a large amount of gravy kind of white sauce like cream cheese pasta only served with bread. The quantity was really good as per the price and we appreciate that. It would have been better if they could make a dry white sauce tossed veggie and chicken salad.

I have ordered from this outlet in mani square a few times. Mainly Italian food. N I'd say the taste and quality of food is pretty good. The pasta in white sauce is one of my favourites. The ceasar salad is quite nice. But my best has to be the chicken steak sizzler. Tiny diced veggies and chicken bits packed in a sheet or chicken filet to make the perfect steak, served sizzling hot. Quite a treat to the taste buds as well. The spicy Thai chicken sizzler was my latest try and I was quite pleased with the distinctive yet appropriate use of coconut in the Thai curry. Served with an ample amount of noodles, a single dish is quite enough for two. However the service here is exceptionally slow. That needs a bit of improvement. But overall a nice place. Would like to try more items.

"Say Cheese" at Mani Square Food Court provides both Italian and Continental food. Its the only stall in the food court at Mani Square Mall which provides Sizzlers. I along with my friend had ordered 2 Roasted Chicken Sizzlers which were served after around 20 minutes. Priced at around INR 250, its a decent sizzler- Nothing too Wow but then again not even bad. The chicken was cooked properly and it tasted somewhat good- once again a rather decent roasted chicken. However, the vegetables tasted quite plain and could have been a bit more tastier along with some added flavour which ultimately could have just raised the level of the Sizzler. But then again, its a modest Sizzler rated at just INR 250.

Say Cheese is one of those places that is only good enough for the casual of all eaters. 
There isn't special about the joint and it's dishes . The kind the food you'd have to eat for any conversations' sake ! Â Â 
The only quality I see in them : Mildly cheap !! 
I know this may seem unfair to some but it's the truth. Their pizzas lack originality and zeal. 
The Cheese seems sprinkled on at times and will not give you the satisfaction like those from Pizza Hut.
However that being said it's nothing disgusting either.Â 

Ordered the BBQ chicken 10'' sized Pizza by the way and as mentioned it was OK . The amount of chicken present was quite pathetic !. Toppings are there only for show . A Â very average experience !!

The menu boasts of exotic pizza,pasta and sizzler dishes. We were in a hurry with a half empty stomach so ordered the farmfresh asiago pizza. The 10" pizza was good but the seasonsing could be better. The crust surpsrisingly tasted really nice! Though the preparation took a lot of time but on the whole the pizza was value for money.

One of the numerous outlets at the mani square food court , this one serves some mean sizzlers at an affordable price . We tried the spicy Thai chicken sizzler which had a noodle base , and it tasted great ! The base was lettuce and it was piping hot . If smoking hot sizzler is on your mind on a rainy day at the mall , do try this place out. It won't disappoint you !

I have been to Mani Square so so many times and have eaten from there in so many outlets. But Say Cheese serves the best pocket friendly dishes. The whole sizzles dishes are more than one person to eat. Its tasty, presentable and fresh. Will recommend to every one who looks for sizzlers at the doorstep.

After trying out some other things me and my friends ordered grilled fish to satisfy the extra appetite we had. And I have to say it was an awesome experience. It had the right taste, right amount, and everything right. A must try for everyone.

Had Thai chicken with noodles sizzler. It was way too saucey. And there was way too much veggies, that too large chunks of it than the chicken. Overall it was an average food.

Located at Mani Square Food Court this outlet attracts lot of young crowd. On our last visit to this place we had been there for a quick bite. We had ordered for French Fries, Coke and Penne Pasta in white sauce. The pasta with the decent portions of mushroom and bell pepper was quite okay according to me, it was fairly cheesy with black pepper sprinkled all over. The French Fries were served on a plate unlike how it gets served at KFC, McD or elsewhere. A bit less tasty than the KFC fries these were decent though, sprinkled with right amount of salt all over it. But I think considering the quantity and taste it was not really popularly priced. The service was awfully slow and might make you edgy if you are really hungry! Not sure if the service factor was due to heavy Sunday crowd or less man power, but whatever it maybe, it is not acceptable for a food court stall for sure, where we expect prompt and fast services.

Had the veggie deligh pizza from here on my last visit to.the mani square food court. I think say cheese has come a long way since it first opened becuz despite the bad reviews on zomato,I found my pizza tasty filled with cheesy goodness and fresh. The size of the 10inch pizza is also sufficient for two people and it costs much less than d overpriced pizza hut pizzas.

I had pathetic experience with my friends at the place. I expected the food to be good by the outer appearance.

I ordered a pizza and a pasta, and specially advised the person to keep pizza least spicy.
The pasta was somewhat okay, but the pizza they gave was the most awful pizza I had ever had.
It was so chilly the first bite, I felt like spitting it out.

When I brought this to the notice of the person in charge, he alleged me and said that it was not possible.
Then upon it to him, he agreed, but still said thats what pizza is.
Moreover, he claimed that they were pretty famous for the pizza.

Not even once, he apologised.
Apart from pathetic food, the customer service was also pathetic.
I would never recommend the place to anyone.

Best continental dishes with reasonable price. I am very frequent visitor of most of the mall and i found Say Cheese is one of the best.
