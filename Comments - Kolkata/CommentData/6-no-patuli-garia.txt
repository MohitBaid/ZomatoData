new but surely making its mark . this place is mostly take away type fast food counter . Though it does have some outside sitting arrangements.

Located in patuli it is always having customers and the food is fresh and well prepared .
Mostly items like roll , fried rice and noodles are its hot sellers .

Though food quality or quantity is nothing out of the ordinary , this pace does provide a source of ready made food to the locals.

This is basically a take away outlet , with few tables and chairs setup in front of it. I have tried their biryani , rolls , momo and chowmein. Quality of food is below average but the price is a bit higher.

Got a treat from my friend for her birthday. 
This was the nearest from our college and open at this time. 
Ambiance: Nothing much 1table and a few chairs for seating outdoors. 

Food: 
Chicken Roll(4/10): Too dry, tasteless/bland and not enough quantity for Rs 40! This ain't value for money. And size is small too! 

Chicken Steamed Momos(7/10): A decent item at taste, except that they're too soft and light on the filling.  Soup is good. Sauce is not for review. It's still value for money someway.

Food is terrible..not recommended at all..quality is deteriorating day by day..rolls may be worth a shot. Very dissapointed to be honest. Location is the only positive point..

This is the best snacks outlet in Patuli. It has limited items, but quality is satisfying. The chicken Tandoori Momo has to be specially mentioned, as it's very good.

My neighbourhood take away joint. 
Ok food. Tasty for its budget. 
Must try  sukha chicken and kadhai chicken. They are oily really good.
Else nothing fancy about the joint. Its and quick bite joint. Biriyani is not toooo good. But best in patuli jhilpar area.

The momo's here are fantastic....price is very low just 50/- for steamed(6 pcs), according to price and quantity....the service is fast too! But I don't know about other food.... although I would recommend the momo highly!

One of the pocket friendly food joint in our area, serves good food. Decent service. Chowmein and rolls are good and filling. Tried their chicken bharta alongside tandoori rooti, decent in comparison with price. Still not the best chicken bharta I tasted. Not yet tired their tabdoori momo but will surely try.

A relatively new and decent place to have a quick bite! 
Recommended: double chicken roll and steam momo. 
Even though the seating arrangement is not that dedicated but good enough for friends to hang out.

It is mainly a take away counter and 2tables for snacking purpose. Food is so so. I liked the tandoori momo. It is a new outlet so management is not as good. Roll is also not bad. One can try it fir casual evening snacks.

The quality with which they started had come down drastically.....the only good item I find is their kebab...Chinese doesn't taste good..nor does the biriyani which was once pretty good

Because of the nearby location I have visited it few times.Average type.
Roll is good.Biriyani is below the average.Tikka kabab also not up to the mark.
One thing also need to mention that price is also low.

A take away counter near the Patuli bypass connector. Gets the naming cue from you know where. I wish it could have borrowed some culinary inspirations as well. I'm fine with their limited menu, but mismanagement and limited cooking skills is NOT so cool. The crispy chicken was oily and below par taste. The ordering system is, oops, did I say "system" ? They are clueless on who ordered what,  and in which sequence. 
Good thing is that they accept non cash payments.

Tandoori momo is good, roll is ok, kebabs too. Biriyani is what I don't get, Sells like hot cake but tastes not that great. May be the price point. But the owners here here has all the good intensions. Their behaviour is great actually and it feels that they care about the joint. I hope they get an upgrade on the biriyani and chaap zone.

This food joint is near my home... So when I get time or wanted to eat, I just go there to grab a bite. Normally I only tried the chicken roll.. It seems to be good enough to satisfy my hunger and tastes good too . Tried Biriyani and Chicken Chap yesterday. One thing I would like to say Biriyani quality was average,it needs improvement.But the Chap was exceptionally good.

Day before yesterday i went there with my friends and had dinner there... The place is good, the food they serve is awesome.. They serve very tasty biriyani and tandoor items.. The best part is they serve all this at a very reasonable price.. The behavior of the four people who runs that place Satyajit, Anjan, Ranjan & Rahul are very good... People should try the food of this place at least once...

This take away is located exactly at Patuli beside mio amore. They have a tandoori momo which is just mouth watering. They serve 6pcs tandoori momo with a bowl of fresh n hot soup for just rs.60. They have a facility of outdoor seating with a few plastic chairs n tables which does not really count with their quality of food. This joint is relatively a new one so I think it's worth a try especially their tandoori momos. They'll also have shawarma in their menu.

Been here a couple of times  located  near Patuli mio-amore which is a great location for foodies to visit as the pavement is pretty wide  but their food taste not good .tried rolls nd momos there which takes common ordinary ones like a road shop nothing special then ordered their nuns and kebabs which just sucks first the nuns it so thick and tastes terrible the worst nuns I had and the kebabs were so rough not juicy at all ordered the tangri kebab but it tastes as if leftovers  from yesterday. Wanted to try their biryani but seeing the low quantity they were providing to others didn't order. Besides  the menu they provide are nothing special no variety at all things one can easily get at any joint in kolkata and no signature dishes to serve others Just gone their for curiosity after seeing a newly food joint opened but regret buying food their
