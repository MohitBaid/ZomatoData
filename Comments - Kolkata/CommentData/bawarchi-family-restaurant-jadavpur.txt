The food quality is falling day by day....biryani pieces are small and rice is not tasty....Chinese dishes are not as tasty as before and prices are on rise!! Nt happy with the experience at all though quantity served is still a lot.

I visited the place with a friends family. The interior really impressed me. Being fan of dimly lit places i loved it. We were five people so we got the sofa table adjacent to the window. I loved the view. Was impressed with the table decor as well. We ordered Drums of Heaven as starters and mixed fried rice, sanghai chicken and salad. We even ordered for fresh lime soda. The service was fast but the food is average. The staff were well behaved. The icecream was great as well.

After visiting mirch masala and having beer and starter came to this place to have dinner... but trust me I was not overall satisfied..

Had chicken mughal e a azam biriyani.. The biriyani was really tasty but the chicken piece was very very small and hard (also lacked the juiciness and salt or spices).. looked like they just boiled it and placed it over... It was accompanied with an egg and a aloo.. The quantity was really not enough if u r super hungry...

Now coming to the reshmi butter masala... The worst I have ever had in whole of india... It was so damn sweet that it felt like I was having some dessert or "Rabdi" the chicken cubes were small and lacked any taste... I wud have given negative points for this dish itself..

The plain naan was soft and good..

The 2.5points for the ambience and the taste of biriyani.. otherwise it was a big big let down...

Don't waste ur 240 bucks on that reshmi butter masala ever here...

Total bill was 467 Inc GST..

This restaurant is near to my place, so its a common place for me. The food is always nice. I like their crispy chicken very much. Lovely ambience, light music, humble staffs.  The chinese items i like the most. Biryani is equally good. Very nice and fast service. Love it.

A family restaurant in Jadavpur area with a good ambiance? This is it!

Located just beside Jadavpur 8b bus stand is the huge "Bawarchi" banner, with the restaurant occupying 2 floors of the building. Plenty of seating with ambient light and a very family-friendly environment.

Since I live close to Jadavpur, I've been here on multiple occasions. If you're expecting a fine-dining experience, then that is not what you're going to get here. But if you're looking to spend some quality time with friends/family over a plate of biryani or a hot bowl of soup, then this is the place.

Must tries: Azadi Biryani, Special Mixed Fried Rice, Fish in Red Wine Sauce.

Ordered a lot of things - Soup,Thupka, Crispy Chilly baby corn, pan fried chicken, Chicken Biryani, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala. All items came one after the other within reasonable time and the quantity was good. Taste was satisfactory. Overall this won't leave you unsatisfied with any of the items.

I went there thrice and what I found is that their Indian Dishes are much better over Chinese.
The Indian dishes are tasty and the quality is also very good with respect to the price segment.
The service is very quick and fabulous.
In case of ambience, it's of Bengali culture and it won't matter that much.
I bought 3 nearby vouchers consist of 5 courses meal and it costs around 299(for 2 people).
Overall, it's good and pocket-friendly place but not recommended for Chinese dishes.

Something is seriously wrong with the people of these restaurant ! They are not sincere or bothered for their regular customers ! Every time I have ordered earlier they are negligent of the packaging of food. No cutlery provided no sauce given inspite of the fact of charging extra for packing the food. This time inspite of specially reminding they forgot to send sauce with the steamed momo...And as usual all other stuffs were missing in the packaging ! Just shows their casual behaviour ! Highly unaccepted ! Also the soup with the momo was tasteless and water ! Bawarchi has disappointed me every time ! Time you took your regular customers seriously Bawarchi ! Earlier I used to visit this place regularly too with my friends or family ever since their food quality degraded I don't anymore ! And not just me many of the reviews have my same point too !!

This used to be one of our regular visit place in college days. Went recently in my last Kolkata trip. One of the best restaurant available in the vicinity. Quite spacious and clean siting area on the first floor. Ordered mutton biryani, murg do-pyaja and kasmiri pulao. The food served was really tasty and quantity quite good in the price range. The only thing I did not like is kashmiri pulao as they had replaced pineapple with cherries. They are still charging GST as per older high rate even after the government order. When I asked about this, they said they cant do anything as this is what their system is programmed with. Even few other customers were also arguing and complaining but they were simply not bothered. I was really annoyed with this attitude and felt cheated, so after having a nice meal still I am rating them low.

This is one of the oldest restaurants of Jadavpur area. Used to visit this place a lot with my parents as a child and had a huge affection for this place. But recently when I paid a visit to this place, I noticed that the quality of the food has degraded. We ordered Butter Naan and Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala and it was not quite upto to the mark. I'm not saying the food is bad but it is not as good as it used to be. The ambience and service still remains very good though.

If you're looking for a place around Jadavpur with a decent seating place, this should be it. I've been a regular visitor for the past 3 years and the service has been satisfactory always. The biriyani they serve is decent, enough for two. Chicken tandoori has to be one of my favorites so I swear by it. The staff is cooperative enough and the food arrives depending on the number of people waiting. They try their best to make it sooner.

A quick decision to meet a friend of mine amid life’s chores strikes a chord of balance and refreshment. So did I. We decided to meet at Jadavpur, and both of us being ardent lovers of food, my friend recommended me Bawarchi at once. The restaurant, being located at the busiest corner of Jadavpur is at the disposal of the thousands of college goers, pedestrians and happens to be the centre of attraction for the people nearby.

Coming to the ambience, the restaurant is spacious but quite understaffed. Hardly two-three waiters were there to serve all the tables. We ordered a crispy fried chicken for starters, one Chicken fried rice, Hunan chicken and one Chicken hakka noodles. The food was good, tasteful but I won’t say it was something unique or overtly impressive. In fact there are ample scopes for improvement both on the service front as well as on the delicacies. When I ordered for caramel custard, they told us that it wasn’t available. This is something which is absolutely unacceptable.

Their food has really deteriorated over the years. We had ordered Schezuan rice and crispy lamb in plum sauce. The rice was nice enough. But the lamb was awful.

I ordered biriyani and chicken reshmi butter masala.
The biriyani was fine but the chicken had 5 pieces instead of 6.
That's nit the reason for this rating though.
The delivery person took the money , gave me the food. After handing over the money I asked if it was okay; he said yes and left.
After 1 min he came back and claimed I had paid him  100 rupees less. After a bit of heated argument I had to pay him that extra money.
I have ordered a lot but this has never happened once. 
As far as I know the delivery person is supposed to count the money and then go away...not count it while climbing down stairs.
I don't know whether the restaurant authorities will look into the matter as I called them too. I really wish they increase their service because their food is quite nice

I just miss those golden days spent at Bawarchi with my family.
The crispy fried chicken.
I first had this dish at Bawarchi,and the taste still excites my tastebuds.
Biryani was good here.
Recently i went to their restro,almost after 5years.
Interiors are almost the same, the service was not bad but previously it was best.
And most importantly,the food here is not the same anymore.Not at all.
The crispy chicken i ordered this time was way way different.Though the Biryani tasted better,infact the Indian dishes that we ordered was better than before.
This rating of mine is for my previous visits and my love for Bawarchi that i still have,but i am dissappointed this time.
Please please please take care of your quality and taste of the foods like it was before.

Food : 2.5
3 would be overrating. We ordered a quick crispy chicken in sauce and mixed thukpa. The starter was not enough for a couple. The dish could have a little more contrast between the crispiness of chicken coating and the sauce. The thukpa, leaving its traditional colour, came in red soup. We were still ok if the soup tasted as tangy as it looked. Have been here few times since m a localite but really disappointed today. 
Ambience : our childhood favorite vengaboys was being played. Liked it. 
Service : Staffs there are either tired today or new coz dropping empty tray from hand is unprofessional.

Bawarchi is located just opposite to Jadavpur University. It is a nice place to eat during informal getaways. It's light on the pocket for small occasions but not suitable for students on a daily basis. The quantity of each plate is quite handsome. The food tastes good. The ambience is good. Service is also good. All-over its a good place for small friendly occasions.

Bawarchi Family Restaurant is an abode of tandoori delights in the heart of South Kolkata. This is a true pocket friendly restaurant, serving quality food and living up to the expectations of its patrons.

I have been a frequenter of this joint since my college days, and it has some nice memories attached to it. I still remember that I took my childhood friend for a Biriyani treat in Bawarchi after my first film review was published in a leading daily newspaper. Later on, we have gone there in groups of friends and enjoyed their food and ambiance. I have also been there with my family.

Bawarchi is located near the 8B Bus Stand, in Jadavpur, Kolkata, in close vicinity to the campus of Jadavpur University. Due to it's great location it enjoys frequent footfall from university students, professors and tandoori lovers in the city. It is located in the far corner of the first floor in Jadavpur Market, opposite the 8B Bus Stand.

The ambiance and decor is pleasant. Nothing too lavish, nothing too simple. Nice wall papers and mirrors adorn the walls. The wooden tables, sofas and chair offer comfortable sitting and eating.

Let's come to the food now. Bawarchi is famous for it's non-veg Biriyanis, both Chicken and Mutton Biriyani. The quantity served is good for two, the handi in which they serve is decorative. The most interesting part is that a candle keeps burning under the container to keep your Biriyani warm. The Biriyanis have creative names, such as Mughal-E-Azam Biriyani or Azaadi Biriyani.

Other delicacies include the Tandoor dishes, especially Tandoori Chicken and Tandoori Kababs. Go for the Afghani Fish Kabab, Tangri Kabab or Tandoori Prawn. Their Rolls are famous too, specially Chicken or Mutton Kathi Rolls. If you want to keep it light, go for soups - Tom Yum Soup and Sweet Corn Soup are recommended.

Vegetarians can find solace in Butter Naan and Dal Makhani, Lahori Kadai Paneer and Kashmiri Pulao. You can finish with a green salad and Pineapple Raita.

Recent additions include Chello Kabab, and indianised Chinese dishes. If you have sweet tooth go for the ice creams. Duck and Lamb dishes are also available, but I have not tried them yet.

The service is prompt and courteous. The food prices are reasonable and pocket friendly.

You will never regret coming back to this place if you are a true blue Tandoori lover.

Went there few years back. This was probably the first restaurant i had visited in Kolkata. Ambience is simple. Service was quick, they didn't take too long to serve. We had their fried rice (cant remember which one), garlic chicken & manchurian chicken(boneless). I remembered that garlic chicken was superb but unfortunately Manchurian chicken was not upto the mark. Didn't click any picture. Samrat Baskey

Being a big mutton lover,this is my second favourite place in South Kolkata..Biriyani is famous here..It is definitely one of the best family restaurants and reasonable price.. My favourite dishes are Mughal Azam e Biriyani(mutton), Azaadi Biriyani(mutton), Mutton pasinda and Manchow soup.

Never stops to put a smile on my face. Probably it is the most visited restaurant of mine. Pocket pinch is low. Food is good. Decor is nothing extra ordinary. Stuffs are very polite and welcoming. Located just beside 8b. I love their lachha paratha and tandoori roti.

When your stomach and heart craves for the North somewhere in the Southern part you may just drop with your tribe and vibe into this place with a moderate pocket pinch, I promise.
It serves well. The location is excellent. 
Hospitality and courtesy with good food will be served to you and your tribe.
The Chicken Tandoori part is delicious I bet.
And I would not suggest you order Chicken Bharta and you can go for the rest.
I do recommend you to place your stomach cravings right in the shape of Bawarchi.
Photos coming soon.
Thank you. 
Happy Fooding.

One of the most over hyped and over rated restaurant in Zomato , while i found it totally worthless and waste of money. The decor and food service is ok . Bt let's come to the food, it may serve good quality food once bt this time it totally disappointed us . We hd ordered schezwan mixed rice and chicken drums of heaven (gravy). The rice was jst ok, not good enough as the flavour of schezwan sauce didn't come in the mouth properly. The chicken pieces of the rice were not soft enough. Bt the drums of heaven ws on the top of the disappointment. The chicken pieces were hard, dry, too much bony, not enough crispy and not much fresh as well. I must say it was the worst drums of heaven  I hv ever tasted. However people hv lots of misconceptions abt this place. I hd heard before that it is a vry pocket frdly place to hangout bt I found that there are many more restaurants in 8b which serve better quality food in a lower price.

Bawarchi has disappointed me time and again. There was once a time when it used to be one the best restaurants of South Kolkata. But now they are fighting hard to maintain their standard. 
One of the not recommended dish is crispy konjee chicken. It is not at all crispy instead it is very hard and you have to chew very hard to eat it. It is not one day's experience but I had the same experience more than once. Similarly the sweet and sour chicken was very blunt which I ordered last week. 
But a very tasty dish is Bawarchi special Fried rice.

Nice place for a meal with your friends and family! The ambiance is good and with dim light and soft music.. it surely sets the mood! Ordered Chinese here.... Noodle good, simple fried rice good and the bawarchi speciality fried rice is quite interesting.. though too much oil spoiled mood a bit. 
Service is a bit slow in my opinion.. and that and a few 'not so good' food combined.. that's where the Missing point goes from my review. Otherwise a great place for gathering and otherwise.

The place stands a few meters to the left along Jadavpur Central Road. One need to take the stairs as the restaurant is sprawled over both first and second floor.

It is minimally decored with mirrors attached to the walls with dim lighting. The restaurant is quite spacious.  Have visited quite a number of times with my family and had liked their chicken hakka noodles, biriyanis, naans and chicken preparations.

Their delivery system is good too as had got food delivered to my place on many occasions.

Food is good.
Pocket pinch moderate.
Service is fine.

Their quantity is huge..we had ordered drums of heaven for starters nd planned to order the maincourse there after .. Bt 8 big chicken leg pieces left no place in our tummy..so unfortunately couldn't taste their main course items...bt  regarding the drums of heaven i must say it was delicious ...the chicken leg pieces were quite big compared to what other restaurants sell in the city..it was nicely spiced..not too high on the chili.. They charged us 259rs for those 8 pieces of chicken... I surely wish to visit the restaurant again

One of the cheap and best fast food chains in jadavpur with sitting arrangements. Food quantity is good according to the price. However the food quality can be better. The Azaadi Biryani is an awesome combo with egg and kebabs which costs 200 bucks + taxes. Kadai chicken tasted good. Only tried once the Chinese dishes. Drums of heaven, the Mixed hakka Noodles and Honk kong chicken (it was Shredded). which was also a thumbs up. overall recommended for pocket friendly food with friends.

Just situated beside 8B bus stand. It's a medium sized restaurant with good ambience serving quality food. I have tasted their Chinese food which was good and is value for money. Crispy chicken or crispy babycorn is a must have as a starter. Drumstick is not that good. Chicken sweet corn soup is the perfect appetizer. Noodles and fried rice and garlic chicken were also quite good. Wind up your meal with their fresh lime soda. Overall the staff and the quality of food deserves a thumps up.
P.S. Great place for college goers. Check their deals on little apps for getting unbelievable prices.

I have been regularly ordering from Bawarchi Restaurant since last few years, fortunately I did not get a chance to complain (be it the food or the behavior of the people attending the phone). Sadly all changed today when I ordered their Mugal E Azam Biriyani and Butter Chicken which was to be delivered an hour later than the time I placed my order. When the delivery time passed away (considering I live only 10 mins away from the Restaurant), I had to call them and the person attending the phone told me that my order has left the restaurant and I would get it within the next 10 mins. 30 mins passes by and it's 10:30 now so I called them again to find the status of my order and I received an extreme rude behavior from the other end and I was rudely told to wait as the delivery boy was still "on the way". I did not expect this extremely unprofessional behavior from a restaurant being their regular customer. Well just one suggestion for them, get someone polite attending the phone calls or start losing consistent customers like me.

Situated just beside the 8b Bus stand at Jadavpur this is one of the most famous places here particularly among the students. I have been here only once and it was on a occasion, so the place was very crowded and the food quality left much to be desired probably because of the huge crowd the place had to cater in that day. Pricing is reasonable and ambiance is vey dull to say the least. Overall it can be tried but definitely there are much better options nearby.

Just situated beside 8B bus stand. It's a medium sized restaurant with good ambience serving quality food. I have tasted their Chinese food which was good and is value for money. Crispy chicken or crispy babycorn is a must have as a starter. Drumstick is not that good. Chicken sweet corn soup is the perfect appetizer. Noodles and fried rice and garlic chicken were also quite good. Wind up your meal with their fresh lime soda. Overall the staff and the quality of food deserves a thumps up.
P.S. Great place for college goers. Check their deals on little apps for getting unbelievable prices.

Pocket friendly and good if you are ready to compromise on the quality of food for the price. A bit crowded but comes very handy when you are on a money crunch or on a short outing with friends and family.

I have been regularly ordering from Bawarchi Restaurant since last few years, fortunately I did not get a chance to complain (be it the food or the behavior of the people attending the phone). Sadly all changed today when I ordered their Mugal E Azam Biriyani and Butter Chicken which was to be delivered an hour later than the time I placed my order. When the delivery time passed away (considering I live only 10 mins away from the Restaurant), I had to call them and the person attending the phone told me that my order has left the restaurant and I would get it within the next 10 mins. 30 mins passes by and it's 10:30 now so I called them again to find the status of my order and I received an extreme rude behavior from the other end and I was rudely told to wait as the delivery boy was still "on the way". I did not expect this extremely unprofessional behavior from a restaurant being their regular customer. Well just one suggestion for them, get someone polite attending the phone calls or start losing consistent customers like me.

Situated just beside the 8b Bus stand at Jadavpur this is one of the most famous places here particularly among the students. I have been here only once and it was on a occasion, so the place was very crowded and the food quality left much to be desired probably because of the huge crowd the place had to cater in that day. Pricing is reasonable and ambiance is vey dull to say the least. Overall it can be tried but definitely there are much better options nearby.

Well & good ambience... Chinese isn't that much delicious as Indian dishes here ... Visited 6-7 times ...But we were deceived once ..... That time we were purchasing little coupons & they said that prior reservation was needed...But nowhere it was mentioned as per little's terms & conditions...So that was a bad experience... Overall this outlet is pretty good to offer delicious food at reasonable price

Awesome ambience.Check.Awesome food.Check.Quick and Efficient service.Check.Food quality.Check.Food quantity. Check.Come to think of it,Bawarchi has all it takes to make itself really attractive to food fanatics.It has a wide range of menu ranging from North to Chinese meals and even offers mocktails.However the price is a tad high compared to other restaurants in the area.Other than this teeny bit of nuisance, rest is perfect.

And when it comes to the food quality they are always good and they maintain this quality even in busy days. Service was okay. 
Got Paneer Kulcha and Chicken Rice Noodles (Meefoon) served with Shredded Lamb in hot Garlic sauce.

Will visit again. 
Thank you.

Located at Jadavpur 8B Bus Stand, above Hindustan Sweets, Bawarchi is an average restaurant serving multi cuisine dishes. We ordered Chicken Biriyani, Chicken Tikka Kebab, Chicken Fried Rice and Chilli Chicken. The Chinese dishes were better than the Mughlai ones. Biriyani was not good in taste. Kebabs were dry. The chilli chicken was good actually.

Haven't tried the biriyani yet though it is known for its special biriyani dishes. Tried tikka kabab, veg polau, chicken resmi butter masala, dal makhani, tandoori rooti and ice cream. They offered you a special taste. Though the have special mentioning of chef choice in their menu card bt they produces all dishes with great taste. Overall a place worth visiting. I'll give it a 5 * rating if the tandoori roti get a bit soft. Will visit again.

Ambience is very nice with good sitting arrangements.

It has dine in, take away and home delivery facilities.

Staffs are nice with quick service 

Tried Butter Naan, chicken bharta and Kashmiri aloodum. 

Naan was soft and well made.
Chicken bharta was tasty and flavourful.
Kashmiri aloo dum is a gem. It tasted awesome with thick and creamy gravy, a little sweeter and a must try .

Pocket pinch is reasonable.

A certainly decent place.

Bawarchi is one of the most popular food joint in jadavpur but perhaps it has lost its popularity .. i have been there 4 to 5 times. But i think the first visit was worth it than the others..  i found rezala not uptp the mark though it was during the durga puja.. the quality is not so maintained but last time when when we visited the place it was a close time but they happily served us that a positive attitude :)

Situated just a few mins from 8b bus stand. A perfect location to dine with friends. I visited during the pujas. We were taken to  the 2nd floor as the 1st floor was filled up. It was basically a kind of bar cum restaurant. We ordered various kinds of food from.indian as well as chinese items. The chinese items really tasted bad. We couldn't get it down our throat. The biriyani was a little better. Not at all a good experience for me. Probably not visiting again

The spices tasted as similar to chicken reshmi kebab. Rates are very reasonable. During 8:30 pm, the restaurant was full. Service was  instant and ambience okish.

During this durga puja I tried my first order from Bawarchi after hearing a lot of good stuffs from my friends living in South. I had an egg roll and asked a packet of biryani to be parcelled. The egg roll was quite big. It was sufficient to fill my empty stomach. It tasted okay-okay though. Not hi-fi or something extravaganza sort of thing! The biryani was better. The quantity was sufficient. Tasted good.

A restaurant next to 8B bus stand which serves mediocre chinese food but has the worst customer centricity/service possible. The waiters including the manager lacks the basic courtesy to speak politely and appropriately which is a critical must have in this industry so leave alone respecting the customers.Its a low budget restaurant so definitely was not expecting a starred hotel service,but I felt thoroughly disrespected visiting this restaurant and I rarely ever give negative reviews if at all it doesn't need to be highlighted for the broader audience group to be careful about.No doubt why they end up with a below average score of lesser than 2.8  in Zomato which has never let me down in selecting my eat- out.They treat customers in a way as if they are doing a great favour by serving food  in large quantity which though is quite edible but I ended up getting it packed  as I didnt want to be there for a minute more as my day was spoilt due to the bad customer service displayed by the manager ( who was a tall dark complexioned man) who is less a manager and more a goon and the waiter Manas Das who knows nothing but to dance to his managers tune .I was so upset that I ended up not eating the food and gave it to my pet.Pathetic experience and would definitely not want to visit again.

"Well this review is during the times of puja when crowd rush leads to quality degradation in many restaurants. But bawarchi was different." 

We didn't know this restaurant was well known for biriyani and we ordered Kebabs, Schezuan rice and Manchurian chicken.

Every food had the authentic taste as it should be and it tasted good. This place is pocket friendly as well.

Environment was blossoming with puja colours and people were friendly.

Once upon a time, 2 years back I had some chicken soup, chicken noodles here & decided not to visit it for the second time as we should not repeat same mistakes! 
Good thing about this restaurant is that the interior is well decorated & has a nice atmosphere inside.

The staffs are also good. 

So this restaurant has just one problem - the food. I think the street food stalls opposite to this restaurant serves better food than it though I don't like any of those too!!!

 I was in depression after eating there as I wasted the whole money for those poor food!

Regardless of many of the negative reviews here, I went ahead with my plans of trying out something from this place. Ordered Biriyani, both mutton and chicken Azaadi Biryani and Mutton Pasinda. On a personal note, I quite liked their Biryani. The Rezala was also pretty good. The only reason of dissatisfaction was the pieces of mutton and chicken. The prices are pretty healthy, so why not put a healthy piece of mutton and chicken in the Biryani and also in the Rezala?? Too small, less of meat and more of bone typified the 'botis' in all the preparations. So that is certainly an area of improvement. Yet the Biryani is certainly a 'Yes'. And I can say for sure that I will be trying out their other dishes in the future, for sure. The food was served on time too, so the delivery experience was very good.

Although quite a big establishment in Jadavpur, the quality is subpar to other options in the area. The gravies are oily and the Biriyani dry. Indian is better than Chinese. I like the chicken tandoori here. Other kebabs are dry. Service is on the slower side. Delivery takes a long time.

We ordered biriyani and chicken tandoori in lunch. Chickrn tandoori is pure love . It was too good but the biriyani is not upto the mark. It was ok. Located at jadavpur 8b bus stand . The place is quite cool. If you r in hurry mood then you can try for bawarchi.

I ordered for lunch from this place after checking few options on Zomato , the delivery happened late. The food was filled with too much of black pepper in everything , the fish curry was stale the chicken curry was 95% oil or veg oil and 5% spices and masala, chicken pieces were dripping with so much oil. The naan was more like fluffy soft bread nothing close to how a naan should be, the fish masala was full of black pepper and the pieces tasted of some other sauce , I was very disappointed with this place and the way they cook the food, inhuman I would to say the least. This is my worst experience in Kolkata food in 27 years , sorry but that's the truth there was 110₹ vat and delivery charges in short I wasted a 1000₹ on bad food and bad service and bad taste. I hope I do not fall sick.

Biryani lovers, please note, these guys make their biryani right. The basmati rice is absolutely cooked the way you want it to be, with an awesome flavour. Satisfying quantity too. Liked the ambience, great music and soft lighting. Half a point extra for their service staff. Extremely courteous, attentive and helpful.

Prices are tad high, when you consider the pieces of meat served, probably you would say 20 bucks extra than you expect it to be, plus they charge VAT and Service Tax on the bill amount. My suggestion would be to increase the size of chicken or mutton pieces with greater amount on meat in them. That's where I was slightly disappointed. Otherwise, it was a good experience. I am sure going to be return customer.

This restaurant is located near 8b bus stand, jadavpur. This restaurant is spacious and I like the ambience too. Specially the soft lights and music. The food is really tasty. The price is reasonable too. If you're hungry and you're near the Jadavpur University campus, you can visit this place without any second thought.

Had lunch here for the first time. The chicken mushroom soup is really good. Also the sweet corn soup. The crispy chilli baby corn wasn't that good and it was fried a bit too much. Same issue with the crispy chicken but still it was better and quantity was good too. The quantity of Biryani isn't that much but the size of the mutton made up for it. Had Chinese too. The chicken Hakka noodles is actually good also the garlic chicken has a sweet flavour which tasted good. The paneer Manchurian is something I would recommend never to have. The seats are good. Can be located easily. And the service is really good. Lot better than some of the restoras I visited before. 
Overall I would rate it 3.5. Wouldve rated it around 3.8 but there's no such option here.

I simply love this place. It is homely, cleanliness is good. The food is good, but I must say the manager Partho Uncle (I may have ruined his spelling :3 ) is such a bindas and jovial person! My family and I went for dinner using the Little app, and he took real good care of us! And nowadays, even if good food is found everywhere - good behavior is hard to find. Still, I look forward to go another day with my friends or maybe with my family - but I do know that this place needs to be visited another time... It is that good !

I was never a fan of the food served by Jadavpur Bawarchi in my youth, and I still have not changed that standpoint. Although the prices are low, any food lover would expect to have good quality food at such a low price level. But they even fail to deliver that. Every time I've had their biryani, I've always found the rice to be quite thicker than other biryanis, which is highly unimpressive, as I like my biryani with fine rice. Other items where also not up to the mark. The place has been in the area for many years now - and it is high time that certain improvements are made.

Pathetic is the only adjective that can best describe the food quality of this restaurant. This restaurant is located at Jadavpur 8B right beside Hindustan Sweets. We went for the take away option. We ordered one chicken biryani. The packaging was the only good thin. The food was awful. There was way too much clarified butter in the biryani. The chicken pieces were decent in size but had an awful odour. It seemed that they have given us stale food. The only good thing was the boiled egg. I do not  know how this restaurant is still surviving. Personally I will never visit again. Our experience was awful.

Went there after buying a coupon from the 'Little' app, we opted for the chinese combo meal, and got the coupon for only INR.280(actual price is INR 400,we got a discount).
 
The menu included:
Any 1 Soup (1 by 2): Lemon Coriander Clear / Thick Soup (Veg/ Chicken), Manchow Soup (Veg/ Chicken), Sweet Corn Soup (Veg/ Chicken), Hot & Sour Soup (Veg/ Chicken), Chicken Clear Soup, Chicken Mushroom Soup

Any 1 Starter: Crispy Chilli Babycorn, Mongolian Babycorn, Crispy Chicken, Garlic Chicken Dry, Pan Fried Chicken, Pan Fried Chicken Momo, Steamed Chicken Momo

Any 1 Main Course: Veg - Veg Manchurian, Chilli Mushroom, Chilli Babycorn, Paneer Manchurian; Non-Veg : Chicken In Hunan Style, Devil's Chicken, Hot Garlic Chicken, Hong Kong Chicken, Shanghai Chicken, Green Chilli Chicken, Chilli Chicken, Manchurian Chicken, Sweet & Sour Chicken, Garlic Chicken, Garlic Pepper Chicken, Schezwan Chicken

Any 1 Fried Rice/ Noodles (Veg/ Egg/ Chicken): Schezwan Fried Rice, Noodles Hakka Style

2 Fresh Lime Soda
We bought 3 coupons,and hence we selected:

Chicken manchow soup(which tasted awesome and had large chicken chunks),Chicken mushroom soup(which tasted great too),and Hot & sour chicken soup(which was not hot but was sour and tasty nonetheless)

Sweet lime soda n salt lime soda(one of us complained of too much salt in the soda :P so try to go for the sweet one )

Pan fried chicken,which was sweet and sour,though mainly it was sweet,but the chicken was really crispy and it tasted great!

Garlic pepper chicken(which was bit spicy and had chopped garlic,which tasted great too),Devil's chicken(Do not try this if you can't have spice,they prepare this dish with red chili,and it's really spicy and brings tears to the eyes,but I loved it,as I love spicy dishes),Sweet & sour chicken(this was soo sweet that I couldn't find the sour part of it,some of us used the gravy of devil's chicken to make it bit spicy!)

Schezuan chicken fried rice(again do not go for it if you can't tolerate chillies,they taste really hot and will again bring tears to your eyes :) ), Chicken fried rice(this tasted really really good,and we all loved it,the rice of both the items were well cooked and they had put enough chicken chunks in both the rice dishes)
The staffs is courteous, and polite. Although they took much time in serving the food, but we didn't really mind much as we were not in a hurry...Loved it!

A pocket-friendly place which serves some awesome dishes. I am a fan of their bawarchi special mixed fried rice. It's one of the best fried rices I have ever had. And chicken drums of heaven, they serve 8 pieces of chicken leg, properly cooked with sautéed vegetables. And their darsaan, their way of serving the darsaan is quite different from the rest and I must say, it tastes good! Moreover, the ambience is quite good. A surely recommended restaurant.

Spacious outlet, decent service, good quantity, average quality. This basically sums up what this restaurant is all about. Located near 8B Bus stand, this is a food heaven, mainly for the students at JU or other college or school going students. The cuisine served here is varied, and hence one can get multiple options to try their hands upon. I personally had opted for Noodles and Sweet and Sour Chicken. The Noodles tasted average but the Chicken was quite good. The only complain here was for the size of the chicken balls. Other than that, the entire experience was mostly pleasing.

Located just beside 8b bustand,a very nice place for family dining.The ambience is very soothing.The management takes care of the guest very well.We tried Chicken tom yum soup and drums of heaven for starters.The soup was a bit more spicy than expected and the veggies tasted a bit bitter.Not much pleasing to my taste.Next the drums of heaven.This was perfect with the right spice,sour and sweetness.We also parcelled some Nawabi Paneer and Murgh Musallam.The paneer had two different gravies with four large pieces of coconut stuffed paneer sandwiches.A must try with any kind of Indian Bread.Next was the Murgh Musallam.This was four pieces of chicken in a thick dry masala served on a plate of rice with egg.They use chicken tandoori for making the Musallam which ruined the taste and made it feel like eating tandoori chicken with gravy.I will soon visit for trying other items.

He makes you feel at home and comfortable.Always suggesting the the best and with a big smile.It has three best qualities--tasty food, good portion,pocket friendly.Their kababs are just mouth watering.They melt in your mouth.In different occasions I tried both Indian as well as Chinese.The Chinese is good.I personally loved the Indian spread.

This family restaurant is situated near 8B bus stand. Being close to Jadavpur University, it is mostly visited by students. We went there in the afternoon and ordered crispy chilly babycorn and chicken reshmi kabab for starters. I tried the babycorn which was well made, my dad said the kababs were good too. Then arrived our main course- plain naan, badshahi pulao and paneer kofta curry. The naan was soft,pulao was well garnished with dry fruits, and paneer kofta curry was something new to us and we really liked it. Paneer and other stuffings moulded into little balls and dropped into delicious curry, which was a great concomitant with naan as well as pulao. The service was quick enough,hospitality fine and the ambience was comfortable too. I am surely going to visit this place again soon.

We've been to this place during Puja while pandel hopping near Jadavpur.
This is somewhat near 8B bus stand, the place is spacious with a nice ambience and moderate decor.
Coming to food : 
We opted for Drums of Heaven in starters : 8pieces were there ...and we're exactly 8people out there dining. It tasted okayish, although I've tasted better ones before.
In main course some people opted for Biryani...that Nawabi biryani..the way they serve it looks delicious...with ample portions more than enough for a person. Biryani was a great choice thus.
Rest others tried Chinese dishes... 
We tried mixed hakka noodles, Korean fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, garlic chicken, fish Manchurian.
Fried rice was not up to the mark...but edible... Whereas mixed Hakka noodles was quite okay.. Both sweet n sour and garlic chicken had the authentic taste...so no flaws here. Fish Manchurian was the worst amongst all..some portions had a smoky burnt taste...I didn't know where they came from.
Staffs are prompt and attentive, service was slow that day may be because of puja crowd.

So to sum up ...I would say not a eye-catching restro but still a moderate place to fill a hungry stomach and yes this place doesn't burn a hole in pocket. 
.
Hence, RECOMMENDED!

#My Experience : Bawarchi has been standing tall at 8B more for years with their myriad of Continental, Chinese & North Indian offerings. They are primarily known for their North Indian delicacies and I used too come here often as a kid. I tried their reshmi butter masala & tandoori roti a couple of months back. Food was very average.

So I visited this place last week with my squad. This place is located near the 8B bus stand. 

We actually got a combo for 2 at 499 with the help of the app "Little". You can download this app to get a discount of 30% using the code 'CHJWHY'. Thank me later. 

Now coming to the food the combo had a variety of dishes. 

1. 2 Fresh Lime Soda- Not at all worth it. You hardly get any fizz in it. Take the ice cream instead. 

2. 1 Murg Hariyali Kabab- One of the best Hariyali Kababs I ever had. Very spicy and succulent. 

3. 2 Butter Naan- The Naan was pretty soft and there was an ample amount of butter on the top, the way I like it. 

4. 1 Veg Rice- could have been better. 

5. 1 Murg Tikia Kabab Masala- OMG! This dish was so heavenly. Highly recommended. 

I again visited this restaurant with one of my friends to try out the Chinese Combo at 399.

1. Hot and Sour soup - Personally not a big fan of soups. Still liked it. 

2. Crispy chicken - Didn't like it much. Could have been a bit more spicy. 

3. Schezwan Fried rice - I just loved this dish.  Was not happy with the quantity though. 

4. Sweet and Sour chicken - It's a very good accompaniment for the Schezwan Chicken Rice. Totally worth it. Though the pieces were very small. They should look into it. 

5. 2 Chocolate ice creams. 

Overall I had a nice experience. Food is average but pocket friendly. And they really need to work on their service. They took exactly 30 mins to get our soup. Very disappointed on their service. 

Don't forget to use the coupon to avail discounts.

This afternoon, 8 of us college students went to this restaurant. We had to wait 1 hr 45 mins for the food to be served. Furthermore the manager explicitly said that he would be glad if we cancelled the order. This was 1 hr 30 mins after the order. And the initial order was given at 1:15 pm which is supposed to be the peak lunch hour. The food arrived at 3 and was not worth the wait. Since zomato does not allow us to rate 0, I had to rate it as 1. Rest assured Mr. Manager, No student of our batch will be visiting this restaurant anytime in future.

But the service of the waiters is very poor and they keeps standing in front of your table when aren't many customers which is kind of annoying.

Very popular joint amongst a crowded area where everyone is jostling for attention...
We tried two favorites of each calcuttans…Chicken reshmi kebab and fish fry. The good news is that the reshmi kebab was perfectly done, soft succulent served with usual onion shavings and pudina chutney…as expected. The bad news is that the fish fry was a complete disappointment…thinnest possible fillet of fish (?) within thickest possible crumb coat (wonder how many times the coat was applied)…ultimately giving you a feel of biting into a fishy smelling biscuit…disastrous….in fact this is the practice with most mid-market eating joints who claim to serve this iconic fish-fry…

My timing was 10.15pm, 10.25 pm, 9.55 pm, and 9.35pm. Guys do not give them order on phone. may be you also get refused by sake of timing. The worst persons are seated on the take away counter, as they don't know how to talk with the customer over the phone.

Located very close to my home. We went last night for dinner. We ordered Mongolian chicken, steamed chicken momo and pan friend chilli fish. Steamed momo was nice but the soup was not upto the mark. Mongolian chicken and pan fried fish was good but not very spicy..rather sweet in test. Then we ordered a awadi biriyani and one pan fried mixed noodle. Biriyani was nice but the noodle was excessive sweet in taste and disappointed me. So the starter was much better than the main course.

Location - Convenient.
Ambience - Cozy and comfortable. Suitable for both family gatherings and hang outs with friends. 
Service - One should be satisfied with the service. Attendants are polite and quick to respond to calls. 

FOOD - Absolutely NOT good. I tried a pretty ordinary combo meal consisting of Chicken Mushroom Soup, Crispy Chicken for starter, Chicken Hakka Chowmein and Devil's Chicken. The taste of the soup couldn't get any worse. The Chowmein and chicken side-dish were equally bad.  
Although, the starters were comparatively better. The crispy chicken was good. I also got to taste a piece of Barbeque Fillet which tasted pretty good. 

You can actually have better food at these prices elsewhere.

We tasted  Indian dishes viz. naan,tikka buttrter masala, mutton boti kabab and chk. rezzala.  All the dishes were tasty and did not pinch my pocket. The ambiance was very homely and a perfect place for dinning with family and friends. The service was up to the mark and the floor persons were very cordial and helpful. Before leaving I I took a packed Azami Biriyani which did us delighted too. 
I do hope to visit it again expecting good food,good ambiance and pocket friendly price line.

I have been here a couple of times. The food tastes standard. Both the quantity and quality of food is good. Their service was okay and their ambience is decent. The price is also reasonable.  

I also like the rolls they sell. There is a small outlet opposite to the restaurant. You can get fast food like rolls and momos there. The rolls here is a must try.

This is a good option when one wants to try good food with low budget.

Bawarchi Family Restro, located just behind Jadavpur 8B Bus stand is one of the well-known restaurants in South Kolkata to visit with family or friends. I found the quantity of food they provide or the price to be very satisfying .The ambiance is good as well as the staff are very good at hospitality.

I was there erlier. But always looked for Mughlai cuisine. This time i have tried continental . Not good service. Orderd Chicken pepper steak and sea food sizzler.with sweet lassi. Food was  ok. Its good tender chicken. Funny finding.... Lassi made up by sweet curd. I can figure it. The lassi was served late almost end of the appetizer. Sizzler was served in plates with burn cabbage and server have no idea how to serve the sizzler. Not satisfied with service atall.

Been here numerous times with family and friends. Mixed feelings and lots of memories attached to this place. I will not go into specifics but quality has deteriorated over the years with increased prices. Ambience is better now after it has been renovated. Service is very good and the people are polite. They make the reshmi butter masala and mutton pasinda really well.

Some of the staffs are clueless about the food they serve but they seem to be helpful.Now coming to food,we had tandoori chicken,biriyani,mixed fried rice and some veg main dish(i don't remember the name).All items were pretty average in taste,nothing was like out of the world tasty.

This one has "Average" plastered upon their face. Nothing, absolutely nothing is exceptional about this restaurant. Not their food, not the ambience. The only saving grace they have is their considerably moderate pricing that doesn't make you think twice before going there at the end of the month when you have no cash in your pockets. It is located just beside Jadavpur 8B bus stand, on the upper floors of Hindustan Sweets building. Pretty easy to find. 

I ordered Masala Kulcha, Chicken Handi Kabab, Chicken Biriyani, and Pan-fried Chilli Chicken. The Biriyani was very greasy and the rice was undercooked. That is an indication of its mediocrity. Handi kabab was average (I told you so!), its gravy too runny. Chilli Chicken was the only thing that I could eat properly. In all honesty, their pan-fried Chilli chicken is actually good and I wouldn't mind going back there just to eat that. 

The inside of the restaurant is pretty monotonous and it is always filled with customers. I had the misfortune of getting a seat at a table where there was no proper air supply (No fans and defective AC). The service is moderate, but you already knew that, didn't you? Visit this place when you are starving and can't seem to find any other place.

The main Outlet of the Bawarchi family,This restaurant is located just Adjacent to Jadavpur 8b busstand.Though not much decent in decor,they serve awesome tasty food 😋.They have fast service as well.
Even the menu will not seem unbearably costly for you and Even the Quantities are also huge.We orderd Chicken Hakka chowmein 2 plates for 3 person and they were just Enough for the 3 of us.
The chilichicken boneless seemes finger licking to all of us.It served 8 pieces for only 150 bucks. Government taxes as per applied
If you have a low budget and You wanna enjoy good food you can check in to this place of you are in the Vicinity of Jadavpur .

The Bawarchi Restaurant in Jadavpur came about a little after the establishment of their roll counter beside Bake club. This outlet aimed at providing a food that scaled higher in sophistication in comparison to the stand alone counter. This they have successfully achieved. 

The food is about average, the service is about average, the ambiance is about average. All in all an average place, where you can drop by at the end of the month, when your pocket holds itself back from your spend-y fingers.

I cannot understand why this restaurant is getting poorer day after day. Today, I had one of the unpleasant incidents here in this restaurant. I was having about an hour and a half time, and in the meantime, I came here to have a lunch with my sister. As soon as I entered the restaurant, it was almost empty, with a table or two occupied. I entered at 13.18 pm, and as soon as we occupied our seats, we saw the waiters talking amongst themselves and looked in no mood to give us the menu card in the first place. I called up one, while he came and gave me the menu card. We ordered a plate of simple Veg Fried Rice and Veg Manchurian and I asked the waiter on how much time will it take to prepare? He replied in about 10-15 minutes.

It was more than 30 minutes and still, there was no sign of our food. We were slowly running out of time, and decided to wait more, since we could afford a little bit more delay. Ultimately, it was over 40 minutes and the waiters just muttering/ gesturing us, by saying it is getting prepared. We finally lost our patience and walked out of the restaurant. We went out and had Radha Ballavi as we had no more time to waste going to any more restaurant from that point.

My question to the management staffs is, why will you serve us something you cannot be relatively quick. If you could have told us that it will take some more time, as the preparation is not complete, we could have switched to something alternative. 15 minutes or at maximum 20 minutes, is all it takes in a standard restaurant to serve the simplest food we ordered you, and yet could not get what we actually wanted.

My lunch was a disappointment today. I assure that I will never come back here to your restaurant once again.

Located just behind the 8B bus stand, a popular restaurant among the students. The place was decorated with graffitti in walls and it is spacious.
It was raining heavily outside and we were all drenched in rain.
So we ordered a cream of chicken soup , a chicken manchurian and a hakka egg noodles. 
The cream of chicken was average in taste because it lacked consistency.
The hakka noodles and the manchurian were good in taste.
Its more like a one time go restaurant.

Note: My previous review got deleted automatically due to some issue so its a repost.

Date Of Visit : 30/03/2016

Note : The Menu card is revised by the management. It differs from the one in Zomato.

The Place &Locaion : Its exactly in the middle of Jadabpur 8B, beside bus stand. This place gathers a good crowd as because it is in the middle of busy area and close to Jadavpur University too. This place serves Chinese, North Indian as well as Mughlai dishes. Its on the first floor of the building with nice and pleasant ambiance. The decoration is colourful and soft music runs in the background, they have nice seating arrangement in a very big area and maintainence of hygiene and cleanliness is good. One thing that they have done quite nicely is the matching of wooden tables and chairs along with the window curtains. The service is a bit slow and staffs are friendly.

The Food : On my visit i tried two Indian dishes and they are 1. Chicken ReshmiKabab 7 2. Mughal Azam-E- Biriyani

1. Chicken ReshmiKabab : A complete disappointment. Price too high in comparison with the food served. The pieces of chicken was as small as a Rs. 5 Five Star chocolate. I saw my money got wasted by ordering this item. The Taste was below average and it hardly was made with any effort. The Chatni given with it was pathetic, it was only a Dhaniyachatni whereas it should be a combination of Corriander, Mint, curd and few other ingredients. The presentation was very weak, the dish was not hot at all and it was not eye catching...

My Rating : 2/5

2. Mughal Azam-E- Biriyani : To be honest, i just felt like eating a Rs. 70 Biriyani from small stalls on the roadside. The taste was not good at all and the quantity was poor. The chicken piece given in it was too small and we asked to change it when we saw the piece got melted in rice. The change of the piece took so much of time that we almost finished eating our biriyani. So i can say that the service was not so quick enough and they need to work on this matter..

My Rating : 2.5/5

Overall Experience &Recommendation : My Ratings for this place would be

4/5 for Ambiance

2.5/5 for Service

2.5/5 for taste

4/5 for Cleanliness & Hygiene

3/5 for Reasonability

A restro in a place like Jadavpur needs to be more improved and highly decorated as because its in a possession of a large gathering. But as far as i am concerned, my satisfaction level dropped down at this place. Starting from the service till the taste of food it was not worthy at all. I gave 3 rating just because of the Ambiance. They need to give more emphasis on their food and try to be quick on their feet while serving to the customers. No recommendation for this place.

I think this is the only place in Kolkata which serves different Nine types of Biryani..... Their Biryani is oily,,, though not that rich but tasty..... Their Azadi Biryani contains Chicken/ Mutton Kebabs in it,,, nd the Mutton / Chicken Kasha Biryani have two Eggs in it.... And they cooks the Biryani with Ghee so a different smell will attract you to come again here......

This place is standing tall very next to 8B bus stand, Jadavpur. I have recently been here. As it was really late for me at night I chose to take away parcel. The staffs are decent and they really treated well as long as I was out there. 

They helped me to choose my dishes. I opted for mixed noodles, chicken manchurian, chicken tikka butter masala and some chapatis. I had some vouchers applied so I paid 50% of the total amount only.

My dad really wanted to taste their food so it was basically for dinner. He liked it all but I didn't find anything revolutionary. It was very mundane, humdrum dinner. Moreover, the 14.5% + 5% is irrelevant if I am opting for take away.

Not much impressed and no reason to go back!

During your college days, I am sure most of you knew that A4 prints at Jadavpur costs only Rs.0.50. On such occasion after nearly an entire day's tiredness, we haf settled for Bawarchi. Heard about this restaurant for some time.
Ambience seemed good. Window side seats felt hot. Moved to inner seats.
Food: Chicken manchaw soup, pan fried chili chicken and bawarchi special mixed noodles were getting killed to our day long frustration.
Food was good except the prawn in the mixed noodles felt few weeks old, frozen severely. Don't know why such negligence on chef's part; we did not make any fuss (*tired).  Anyways, I would suggest to not go for their specials, stick with the regulars in their menu and you should be good.
Will visit them soon and will order same food, just to see if they pay attention this time. Keeping fingers crossed  ;)
Bon apetite!

Walked into this place, on a Saturday afternoon. And oh boy! were we in for a great time or not?! 

Awesome staff. Just two of us went for a quick lunch. Yet they moved us from a two seater to a six seater since we were feeling too hot at the two seater table.

Great ambience. The decor is pretty : not too shabby or too posh. They kept playing the soothing Enigma numbers. An absolute family's delight. 

Amazing food. We ordered a plate of Azadi biryani, masala kulcha and kadhai chicken. I loved every bit of what I ate. The food was tender and tasty. All at an affordable price. 

Try this place, if u haven't yet.

But the noodles served with lots of carrots,egg and a little amount of chicken😞.so m not gonna try this thing here again but barbeque chicken was good. So overall I think you can come here only when you are extremely hungry and tired.

Bawarchi is the to-go-for restaurant for all the college students in the locality. The restaurant even gives some discount to the students against their ID cards. Naturally, being a student of Jadavpur University, I have been there an uncountable number of times. The place is good for a quick dining, when your pocket doesn't allow too many options.

They serve both Chinese and Indian, though I prefer their Indian over the Chinese. The food is pretty mediocre, though the options are many.

For starters, I would recommend going for the Babycorn, or Panfried Chilli Fish, or the Golden Fried Prawns, or the usual Drums of Heaven for Chinese, and any of the Kababs for Indian.

For the main course, you have a plethora of options to choose from. You can always go for the tried-and-tasted dishes. The Biriyani is cooked on low oil, and that's a good thing.

For the dessert, I always invariably for the Darshan. However, they take a significant amount of time in preparing it. So, make sure you order it while you're digging away at your main course.

Edit: My last visit has forced me to bring down the rating. We had ordered a Konjee Crispy Lamb, and it was overcooked and burnt. And moreover, the staff too were pretty impolite. Also, the new Menu includes Stroganoff and certain other Italian dishes. DO NOT try them.

The experience was absolutely not satisfying..had ordered a minimum meal of crispy chicken, reshmi kebab and sweet lime soda. And to my surprise that even was not all up to the mark...the sauce used for crispy chicken had a disgusting smell and chicken tasted stale. Kebab was cooked and tender not something really bud tickling...the sweet lime was unreadsonably sweet...not recommended for a visit

Visited there yesterday with my friend for having lunch. We had a groupon coupon on Chinese combo meal. This restaurant can be easily located. It is situated near Jadavpur 8B bus stand. After entering we took seat beside the window and been perfectly seated. We ordered Chicken & Mushroom Soup, Pan fried Chicken as starter, Chicken fried rice along with Garlic pepper chicken as main course. Lastly, we had a fresh lime. The service was prompt. The staffs were well mannered and courteous. Firstly they served the soup which was good in taste. Next they served the pan fried chicken which tasted too good. Then the main course was served after a while. The rice was perfect and the taste of the Garlic pepper chicken was good. Between the two chicken items the Pan fried one was just wow in taste and I loved that very much. Lastly they served two fresh limes which was also nice to taste. After having such perfect lunch me and my friend both felt very much satisfied with their service. The quantity they served was worth mentioning. The ambience of the place was decent also. I don't know why the ratings are low in zomato but my experience with this place is pretty good. Already I have bought another coupon and surely visit in next few days again.

<3 Revisited today as I mentioned before. Ordered Lemon coriander soup, pan fried chicken, Devils chicken along with Chicken rice this time. I just loved the flavours of the soup. It is perfectly cooked with lemon and coriander flavours.  Devils chicken was a bit salty and I didn't like this chicken item at all. Pan fried chicken and rice was as good as before. Again nice experience. :-)

Me and my sister visited this restaurant with the sole motive of trying out lamb for the first time.But I have to say we were very disappointed. We had ordered Schezwan rice and crispy lamb in plum sauce.Though the rice was good enough, the lamb was very bad.It was too sweet and too chewy.We couldn't even complete it.It was so bad.Hopefully the next time we visit,we will have a better experience.

Chapter-II
6 of us went there today(8.10.2016) for dinner. We ordered butter nun, Chicken Bharta, Chicken Butter Masala, Chicken Gravy Noodles, Chicken Fried rice, Garlic Chicken. Out of all of them , only Chicken Bharta tasted good. The nun was cut in weird pieces. There was no butter in Chicken Butter Masala. The Gravy Noodles tasted horrible. The Chicken Fried rice was very little in terms of portion. The Garlic Chicken was too sweet. Due to the long queue outside, the staff more or less threw us out after literally snatching the bill out of our hands. It was a hell-ish experience.

First of all good to see that few new items have been added..but the servicing is very poor. We orderd mocktails before the starters and main course..but they served those after our main course.  In starter we had tandoori murgh while in main course chicken rice followed by two side dishes - hunan fish and crispy lamb in hot garlic sauce. The quantity of the rice was not fruitful enough to make us full..apart fromt that the mocktails were good..and lastly the most favourite tutti fruti.. :-)

This review has been long time overdue! This restaurant was known for good Biriyani. 

Alas! Days are long gone when it had properly lived upto it's expectation! 

I went out to dine with my family on the eve of my sister in law's birthday. 

We settled for Mutton Boti Kebabs as starters, and for the main course we chose Mutton Mughal Azam-E-Biriyani and Chicken Tikka Buttermasala.

The Mutton Boti Kebabs tasted delectable but you need to slip into a sip of water after every bite. It was made very spicy but it was made good. 

Mutton Mughal Azam-E-Biriyani was the first let down of the night. The Biriyani tasted awful.  It was very salty and the Mutton wasn't so good either. The quantity was sufficient for a single person but the taste was yukk!You couldn't have a proper bite out of it! 

Then came Chicken Tikka Buttermasala which was the second let down. It tasted yukk. Spicy as well as salty we couldn't have it properly. Never ever I had such tasted such worse Chicken. 

We let the manager know about it that it was salty and tasted bad. All the manager did was a check that the Biriyani tasted very salty. He couldn't do anything more. 

The ambiance appeared dull and nothing was soothing to the eyes. 

We had to wait half an hour for the Boti Kebabs and another half an hour for the main course. The service time taken was more than usual. 

The waiters weren't at all courteous and they didn't do anything good to us. 

At the end we only received a bill which costed much. Nothing was done for the bad experience that we had.

Never ever in my life I would like to visit this restaurant. If it's the only restaurant left in the world I would die starving but never go here to grab a meal. 

All in all it was a very bad experience. Unfortunately,  Zomato doesn't have negative rating system otherwise I would rate it as a -5. 

It was a complete let down and would like to safeguard others so they don't go in here and waste their money.

This place is located at 8b bus station. The ambiance is average and the food is relatively good..
The staff is courteous but very slow..they took ages to bring the good to the table and even the bill came after asking for it for 20 min. Tried the chicken and mutton biriyani and they are good. This place is good for people with a large appetite and a relatively tight budget. Good for college students..

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION: As the Resto hopping continues so this time it was near to far and quite far for me. Landed up in Jadavpur 8B to visit this place. Heard the name before of this place but never went there, so it was an opportunity. Its a Multi-cuisine resto with quite a lot variety for you. Expectations were quite high and was badly hungry.

AMBIANCE AND SERVICE:  From the main gate it looked very appealing for me. Walking up the stairs seeing a aquarium on the stair way and walking up the resto gate. As soon as i went in the moral got a bit lower and negative vibes started to grab me. The ambiance was quite ok but looked too dark. interiors were also fine but could have been much better. The hospitality and service we got was below average. As we dined the manager was not cooperative first until and unless he understood later for what purpose we were there. Waiters were polite and efficient.

FOOD AND DRINKS: 
We good expectations we ordered some fine items for us. Beginning from the starter we ordered the Chicken Tikka Kebab which came to us quickly. the decoration of the plate was very poor. The dish was very ordinary. it was not juicy and hard to cut into pieces. the look was also very pale, seemed a chicken pakora to me by looks.

We moved on to the main course instantly which were Dal Makhani, Chicken reshmi Butter masala, Badshahi Pulao as well as butter nan. And Lastly Fresh Lime sweet and salt soda.

Dal Makhani was decent in taste but average as well. 

Chicken reshmi butter masala do tasted like it should be but still on the ordinary side. The chicken pieces in it really disappointed.

Badshahi pulao was something new but it was just an ordianry type pulao you can say. It went so heavy with the reshi masal gravy that one could not even eat it.

Butter Nan went well with both the Dal makhani and reshmi butter masala.

Fresh Lime soda was atlast something to cheer about. It made us happy a bit.
 
CTK: 6/10
DM: 7/10
CRBM: 7/10
BP: 7/10
NAN: 8/10
FLS: 8.5/10

QNQ AND PRICES: Quality was ok but lil disappointed with some chicken pieces to be honest as to go critical. Some pieces were big and some smaller which was a bit annoying. Otherwise all the gravy and rice quantity was decent enough. Prices are fine and pocket friendly.

CONCLUSION: So visit so far dosen't turned out to be a great idea. But this is been our job to do. Place need improvement in food section.

NOTE: this review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

Visited here, often situated behind 8B bus Stand (Main JU campus). They offer foods (both mughlai and chinese) at reasonable rates. We didn't experiment and ordered:

Chicken Chowmin, chicken fried rice, chilly chicken and hong kong chicken. Dishes were well prepared, taste was main stream and definitely not what many expect as authentic chinese. Though 2 plates would be enough for 3 people. Ambience is good, however I  found the place a little bit congested to my liking, not only since the footfall was high but they have tried to squeeze as much furniture they could in that small area.

One of the good restaurant in jadavpur 8B bus stand. Good space and the waiters are very good they understand their customers need ambiance is good with dim light.. We ordered Mutton awadhi Biriyani which includes 6 small chicken kebabs,1 potato,1 egg and 1 piece Mutton and rice. The quality of rice was not too good but the chicken kebabs were full of spice I just can't stop thinking about it.. and we ordered mixed noodles it was good in compare to biriyani .
I would recommend this restaurant and wish to go next time(*^﹏^*)

Horrible and Worst Experience for Home Delivery!!! Please don't place any orders from Bawarchi for Home Delivery as you would be conned cause they would provide you with wrong orders and later won't even refund or replace it with correct order.

Customer Service is pathetic because they are not even ready to listen to you.
Our only mistake was the Order was already paid in advanced by card.

Even after all this if you are going for Home Delivery from Bawarchi, please go for Cash on Delivery and check the items you ordered before handing over the Money.

God Bless the common man!!!

I've visited this restaurant quite a few times, mostly for lunch. they serve good quantity at reasonable prices. staff here is quite well behaved and service is average. Chinese food here is really good. their biryani doesn't quite match up to their standard though.my advice is, you must visit this restaurant at least once if you are somewhere near jadavpur, and want to have some amazing Chinese. :)

Bawarchi offers one old school food pleasures. Indian and Indianized Chinese being their forte, they continue to serve genuinely tasty food. Their seating area is pretty big and comfortable and they home deliver too. Today when I went there to eat, there was a small mix up, they served us chilli fish instead of chicken but graciously replaced it when we pointed it out.

I have had their Chicken and Mutton Biriyanis, Tandoori Chicken, Crispy Chicken, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala, Handi Kabab, Butter Nan, Fried Rice, Garlic Chicken, Hakka noodles, Chilli Chicken, to mention a few! Both cuisines are pretty tasty although i personally feel their Mughlai dishes are better. And the best thing is the pocket pinch. It is quite reasonable. I have become a regular customer. Ting! :-)

Have been to this place many times. I love their foods especially the biriyanis. We went their during durga pujas..the was asthami and we opted for lunch...my all time favourite is biriyani so i took mutton biriyani and reshmi kebab. My parents took peas pulao and chicken bharta.
Mutton biriyani: the biriyani was awesme but ws spicy a bit. The mutton was really soft just melted in the mouth. Didnt expct that the mutton would be tht good. A big thumbs up

Reshmi kebab: i have had their reshmi kebab whenever i take biriyani. Their kebab are damn tasty but last day the kebabs were a bit overcooked and dry but nevertheless it was good
Chicken bharta: i had one bite of this dish.the bharta was yummy...properly cooked nd spicy..loved the bharta

Peas pulao: i also had one spoon of pulao. I didnt like the taste..neither i liked th@e taste nor texture nor presentation. Acc.to me it was tasteless.
Overall the place is ideal for every type of food.

The ambience of this place is good. I had Tandoori Roti and Murg Kassa which were both really nicely prepared. The waiters are slow and they take a really long time to serve you.

The toilet in this restaurant is located just beside the kitchen. I found this a bit disturbing.

I'm a frequent visitors to Bawarchi Family Restaurant Jadavpur,  I've visited today @8:30 pm with my family and ordered gravy Chicken Chow Mein but waiter served hakka Chicken Chow Mein after that I ordered chicken Tuppa which is tremendous hot caused using excess ginger and red chilli. 
My recommendations is to reconfirm with your order and any customised preparation before it gets served.

I think this place is more like it has all the Jadavpurians memory with friends and partners. Located just adjacent to the 8B bus stand in Jadavpur, opposite the university. Being a resident of this place we used go there with our friends with our pocket money, the food there is of the standard and good indeed. They also give special 10% discount to students providing their id cards. We are a frequent goer over there. The Chinese food is better than Biriyani. The tandoori fish is nice though. Over all it is a nice joint for family and as well as friends.

Visited one month ego with my friend on Sunday evening. It is located just beside 8B bus stand, so very easy to find out. I had pre booked so I don't have to wait for the dinner. We ordered Chinese food as Bawarchi is famous for this. That was combo Meal for two person which include 2 Soups (Veg / Non-Veg ),1 Starter (Fish / Chicken / Veg), 1 Main Course ( Fish / Chicken / Veg),1 Rice item ( Veg / Chicken / Egg), 1 Noodles item (Veg / Chicken / Egg), 2 Fresh Lime. There are multiple options in starter & you have to choose according to your choice.We took crispy chilli baby corn, which was really awesome. In main course we took Egg Fried Rice and Egg Noodles which was also good in taste. The only bad part of the whole menu was there was no sweet in dessert. I took one sprite also outside the combo menu and it took long time to serve after I ordered.

The overall ambiance was also awesome, ideal place to go with your GF/BF and also good for family dinner. I strongly recommend to visit the restaurant with your loved one.

Pathetic service ever. 20 minutes of wait and no one offered water or cared to take the order. Very very ill behaved manager who gave a lame excuse stating that the delay was due to more crowd although there were plenty of tables vacant and moderate crowd at the place. Happily took next 30 minutes to deliver the food. I am awestruck at the staff rude behaviour of the staff and presume that this can be only expected in Kolkata. I would rate the place 0 if I had the option.

Located just on the lane beside the 8B bus stand. Went with friends for lunch. Was a bit too crowded and the atmosphere was okayish. The AC seemed to have stopped working as inside the restaurant , it was too warm and they didn't even turn on the fans. Nevertheless, the Chinese food they served was amazing! The Gravy mixed noodles as well the Garlic Pepper Chicken was great. Thr pan fried noodles were tasty too. The butterscotch icecream and the fresh lime soda was good also. Staffs co-ordinate well and services is top knotch. Recommended.

I would like to rate in negative, but there is no option for so.
Delivery time: I got delivery at home after one hour forty five minutes of expected delivery time.
I ordered the food at 12.15 and expected the delivery by 1.30 PM. But it came at 3.10 pm. We all were starving by then.

Staff behaviour: When I called them to ask about the reason for late delivery (or whether the food is coming or not), their behaviour was also very rude.

Talking about the food: the food was awful. The chilli fish was tasteless (more of flour coating on the fish). And rice was uncooked, where you can hardly find the shrimps, and mostly with raw vegetables (they can rename it rice salad). And offcourse, I totally forgot what's actual schezuan is after having it here.

Overall: very bad experience. Will never call or visit them again.

Bawarchi Family Restaurant located at a prime location (just beside Jadavpur 8B bus stand) is a famous choice for students and families alike who want quality food at reasonable prices. The ambience is peaceful and service is well managed. This place offers it's customers a wide variety of choices , fancy and regular , from chicken to lamb to duck and even prawns . For vegetarians also, a wide  range of choices are offered from fancy dishes of paneer and mushroom to regular vegan dishes. The mocktails and desserts are mouth watering and well prepared.
Food is of good quality and I would suggest one tries their various range of soups and Chinese preparation especially Garlic Chicken with Plain Naan.

Despite serving "okay" food, this place is actually doing quite well for a long time now. A plus is that the restaurant keeps almost all the items in its menu available almost at all times. The service is usually good but tends to be slow at times, but that can be down to it being very crowded, especially during dinner time. The food is "not bad", but I must say the starters are really good. They serve good mutton though, far better than most of its chicken dishes. All chicken main course dishes, as I've found after visiting a lot of times, taste somewhat the same. Not a fantastic place, but not a bad one either. But as long as Banzara exists, other restaurants can not be the go-to place of Jadavpur.

I had always wanted to try bawarchi for two reasons. One, its really close to my place and secondly, I had heard from a few friends that the food was nice.
On the review there are three things that I generally consider - ambience, food and people.
Ambience was good and the best part was having a whole side open to the main road. It was soothing with not too many bright lights. Ideal for family and friends.
Food was good. We ordered chinese and had prawn and lamb. Prawn was cooked nicely while lamb was overcooked and stiff. Flavours however, were all there.
In the People section there are two things to consider. The staff treatment was good, though most servers had no idea about the food on the menu. They kept referring to the manager. Service was fine though lacked a lot of finese. The crowd though was nowhere near satisfactory.
All in all, a good experience, but could be way better.

Seems underrated on Zomato. Bawarchi is one of the oldest and reputed restaurants in Jadavpur. When you are hungry and not in the mood for any experimentation you can rely on thei Standard of food. Nothing exotic.They serve the Mughlai and Chinese cuisine quite competently. The old-school Tandoori Chic. is delicious. Over-sumptuous quantity in the Sp. Biriyani dish. Enough for 4 people. Ambiance is comfortable and family friendly.

If you are looking for family restaurant near jadavpur then you must come over here. I really liked it. It takes a bit time to serve but still its ok.

I went there more than 8-9 times. It is just beside of the Jadavpur 8B bus stand which is very near from my work place. I went there mainly in the afternoon season for lunch mainly. The location is superb. You can get a nice view of 8B bus stand and the main road from here. The waiter is so good in behavior and very friendly. For food I just share todays menu what I ate. We ordered Lemon Coriander Clear Soup,  Pan Fried Chicken Momo, Garlic Pepper Chicken, Schezwan Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken Hakka Noodles. Momo, Soup, Schezwan Chicken Fried Rice were very good in taste and Garlic Pepper Chicken and Chicken Hakka Noodles were average. Chicken is a little bit harder to chew. The overall experience was good. This is a budget friendly family restaurant. You may try.

Bawarchi's jadavpur outlet being very near to my place is almost a regular dine out spot for me with friends & family. North Indian & Mughlai food is their speciality. They prepare excellent biriyanis, Kebabs & Tandooris, some mouth watering chicken preparations like Chicken Tikka Butter Masala. One of their biggest plus point is that food is reasonably priced and is served in more than adequate quantity. Service is good but one incident of last year deserves special mention where on a all veg day we have ordered a dish without knowing it will contain non veg stuff. The manager being extremely nice exchanged it with a vegetarian version without any extra pay. Ambiance is also quite good. The only reason i didnt rate it with a 5 star is the unprofessional behaviour of the parcel counter staff. It is generally crowded and you have to wait in a queue if visiting on weekends.Home Delivery is available & is generally within time. Overall a must visit one.

We were staying in Garia for a day and decided to have a go in this famous restaurant in Jadavpur 8B.
It was my first time where as two of my friends visited this place earlier.
After lots of discussion we ordered "Konjee Crispy Lamb" as starter.
It was really awesome and it set the mood high.

Next we ordered "Pan Fried Chicken Noodles" and "Mixed Hakka Noodles" with "Dry Chili Chicken" as side dish, accompanied by "Sweet Lime Juice".

The pan fried noodles was a first time experience for me and it was really delicious.
The mixed hakka was good but not great.
However I was a bit disappointed in the chili chicken preparation,I have had better in many places.

We loved the decor inside the restaurant and had a good overall experience.
Would love to come back again

Nice place. Reasonable price. I went there with my 2 friends . Dipankar and poulomi. We ordered gravy veg chowmin and devils chicken. It was nice. Sound system is not good. It is situated near 8b bus stand.

being a resident of jadavpur, i have taken home delivery numerous times from them right from their early days, when zomato was not there :) then there was a gap of almost 4-5 years and then i decided again to check them out to see if the quality is still good.
ordered parathas along with bhuna mutton and chicken bharta. both the dishes were too much spicy with thick gravy. i expected bharta to have shredded chicken but they had pieces instead. gravy was thick, hot and more like a tikka-masala gravy, not the simmered gravy we used to for a bharta preparation. bhuna mutton had small pieces of boneless muttons. we ordered 3 portions, one of them had mutton burnt and hence tasted bitter. again, gravy was similarly thick and hot, almost the same like bharta. paratha was nice though, soft but crispy.
overall, not a good experience. i guess their standard has dipped over the years. for rolls, still its good i guess as lots of college-goers flock them everyday. but for a meal, you need to think again before choosing it.

Booked a groupon for 6 of us , and we were overwhelmed by the quantity.
The quality is good too. I don't know about the menu price of the items but the group on deal made it quiet reasonable.
I had the hot n sour soup, it was really spicy. Chicken drums of heaven lacked the zing but the other items like hong Kong chicken, chilli fish were good. Hakka noodles and fried rice was OK. Will visit again.

We had ordered chicken drumsticks as starters during puja...the food arrived late and to our dismay they had marinated the chicken with inferior things.It smelled of stale vinegar..It was not even rightly cooked.
The chelo kebab is not bad but compared to the price it's nothing.The sitting arrangements are not uniform.The quantity is less.
It's below average according to me.

Avoid this place.
On the eve of our marriage anniversary,we ordered our dinner amounting to Rs2223/ and we faced a horrible experience. Our Order Number was DU10 and it was under the name of Nibedita Chowdhury.
1.Food Quality- Simply pathetic. It seems that we have ordered from any footpath snacks bar.
We ordered Azaadi biriyani and believe me after eating that stuff u will start hating the item biriyani. 
We ordered Fish Finger and after taking the first bite we just throw it in dustbin.
Mixed Fried Rice was sort of boiled rice without any taste.
2.Food was delivered at 10pm and it was very cold as if it was prepared at around 6-6.30pm.
3.They were supposed to give 600 ml of Cold Drinks free as the ordered amount was more than Rs.700 but they didnt give that.When contacted they said that they are sending it asap but ultimately it didnt reach us.We stay just 10 mins away from the shop.It happened last time also.I think it is their fake publicity stunt.
Our anniversary get messed up due to Bawarchi.
So think twice before giving any order over here.

I guess this is my most visited restaurant as it's just 3-4 mins from my place of work,so easy access and the 10% student discount helps too! Food is okay, but I would suggest them to remove the duck from the menu as they invariably fail to put any dish together. The lamb is too rubbery and as the manager himself said that he wouldn't suggest to have lamb (since I'm a very known face at this place). Service is pretty slow and quality isn't consistent. But the one dish that has not been a downer ever has to be the hakka noodles and lemon chicken. The mughlai dishes are good. But their lime soda is horrible. It tastes like sweet water with no hint of lemon! It's a decent place for a casual dining experience.

I had an exam and i was damn tired. Was looking for a place to literally jump for food and i found bawarchi family restaurant on 8b bus stand. The ambience was quite good and though the place was nearly full, the manager arranged a place for me. Now coming to the food.

I ordered a biriyani first. The taste was light and decent. And they said it was made from sun flower oil. So that was an add on.

Then i ordered chicken drum sticks which were again excellent. The pieces were superbly cooked and the amount of spice was just perfect.

At last i ordered for a desert but they didn't have one at that point. So couldn't taste it.

Staffs are good like most places, with a smile.

Overall had a very satisfying feeling after eating at bawarchi family restaurant. 

Cheers!!

Had a splendid time with family and friends at Bawarchi. Relished the authentic taste of Muglai and North Indian food in a comforting ambiance. Chicken rezala was stunningly delicious and the mutton was very tender in the mutton biriyani, chicken tandoori and raita was also delightful.  Highly recommend all to have a bite of North Indian delicacies at Bawarchi .

Chose to visit this place due to convenience and proximity at the time and nothing else. What we faced was worse than disappointing - it almost became a health liability and could have become an emergency. I would not recommend this hellhole to anyone in their right mind.

The order was the most basic stuff possible- peas pulao and chicken reshmi butter masala, stuff you would expect most places to get right at least to a certain degree. These people seemed glad to prove us wrong. The rice was fresh and that is the only good thing I can say about it. It was overly sweet and the quantity of raisins was abnormally high. Also the peas had the kind of weird taste that happens when they are kept frozen for too long.

Now for the chicken. The gravy was again so sweet that it could remind anyone of dessert. It was also overtly heavy and richer than usual. The chicken pieces were completely spoilt, sour and malodorous. They must have used kebab left over from days ago and served us pure diarrhea on a plate. This is inexcusable. You just cannot take my money and then serve me bullshit like this.

I suggest you clean up your act and spend more time with quality control. Also, you could use some personnel that know better than to take spoilt food and serve it to customers.
For those reading this review, my advice would be to avoid this place like the plague if you aren't looking forward to a trip to the hospital. Even street food would be a safer choice.

We ordered Chicken Biriyani, Mutton Dopeyaza. Believe me the mutton dish was disgusting in taste. And quality was poor. Felt a bad smell in mutton. And overall the most disgusting part was they kept us waiting for food more than 40mins. When we asked the waiter about it, then he came!!!! Wtf!!!! Disgusting!!!!

we ordered chicken chow, mixed gravy chow , hot garlic fish and tutty fruty ice cream.

 next the chkn chow was not so good in taste . we didn't found any difference between this and "bapi dar fast food cntr er chow"..the grvy chow was really tasteless.
the fish was good.
in short total waste of time and money.

I went to this restaurant today with my family today, having a coupon from groupon. I went to many restuarants using groupon coupons. Today going to bawarchi was an worst experience. Wouldn't thought that this restaurant would be giving a worst service. They think that the coupon does not cost money so we can waste the food. I went to so many restuarents but did not receive such kind of behavior what they did today with us. At last they also did not gace the Mukhwas as well. We were being served Nimbu Pani instead of Fresh Lime Soda. Hot & sour soup tasted only sour. Please dont go this place, it's just has become a worst place.

My Review : 4.0/5.0

An average place with low cost , neat ambiance, serving nice Rolls, kebabs and Biryani.  That's how I can sum up my review about this place. Its located near my place and is a good option for us to have dinner or evening snacks in low budget. Ambiance is neat and tidy. Nothing exceptionally great, but nothing bad also. I especially love the kebabs thats they serve , and also the mouth-watering rolls.

Expenditure / VFM : 600 for 2 people
Ambience/Service : Being situated near 8B Bus Stop, bang opposite JU makes it a convenient spot for an eatery. But the ambience inside is far from being convenient. Its generally too dark inside (lights used are not appropriate for a dining place). 
Service is not up to the mark. One needs to repeatedly call the waiters for basic things. 
Coming to the food, the menu is not exciting enough. To top it they use 'dalda' for cooking most if their dishes which make it an unhealthy option. The biriyani served is sometimes too oily or too dry.
Overall, not recommended. The Zomato ratings for this one is way higher than it should be.

This is practically one of those places where you will love both their Chinese as well as North Indian cuisine. The Restaurant is located on the first floor and is situated right beside the main road and hence very convenient to find. The seating area is comfortable with cushion chairs and couches in place. The staff is quite courteous and is always there to listen to your demands. Now about their food, I really like their Drums of Heaven and i order them almost everytime i visit there. Their soups are also pretty good. Most of the Chinese dishes that i have tried are good and i have no complaints till date. But their best item is their Biriyani. The Mughal E Azam biriyani is there for a single person while they have the Badshahi biriyani which is sufficient for 4 persons. The Biriyani is always perfect when i order and it tastes so good and different than normal biriyani that we get elsewhere. The positive part about the restaurant is their reasonable pricing.

Visited several times while studying in Jadavpur University. It's located just opposite to university gate no. 2, behind 8b bus stand. Ambiance is quite good. Music'll soothe your ears. Decor is also nice. Service is satisfactory. Now coming down to food, this restaurant serves one of the best Murgh Masallam in Kolkata. If you are a first-time visitor, don't miss the opportunity to taste this particular dish. Keep in mind, you need to preorder it, 2-3 hours before you reach over there. You can eat it with kulcha/butter nun/roti. Biryani is also good there, but not matches the quality if arsalan though. Overall a really good restaurant in south Kolkata.

Extremely Poor Behavior from Cashier. I found the cashier chucking my Debit card on the desk while I was entering the PIN in the machine. The magnetic strip could have easily been damaged. The lackadaisical and disrespectful behavior of the staff was shocking. On reprimanding them on this issue, the cashier did not bother to apologise  and merely smiled as if nothing had happened at all.   
The management should be ashamed of the rudeness and the poor treatment meted out to customers, and that too when the food served is merely average. A huge thumbs down.

horrible horrible experience. visited there once with friends and was horrified to see a lizard on the walls- i mean which restaurant is not conscious about this! food was okay-ish not that bad. then again went with family then also food was not bad though the staff behaviour was poor. 
giving it as low as 1.5 because of the last experience. ordered schezwan chowmein hakka long with a chicken item. well me as well as my friend, we are not illiterates that we don't know that schezwan flavour means spicy!! but this is that spicy that if you want to kill anyone force him or her a plate of this chowmein, when we complained water running from our eyes after having two to three spoonfuls, they were like - schezwan toh jhhal i hoye!! i still managed to eat a little more, but my friend just couldnot eat it anymore. staffs were very rude, we thought we would pack it , they almost threw a box at our table, and we - angry hungry and confused just packed it ourselves and left by paying the bills. we came out and had softies to calm down and soothe our tongues and mouth. would NEVER go back !

The rice wasn't properly cooked & was very dry,the chicken pieces were ok but nothing to hover about & the mutton was uneatable as it was undercooked but on the positive side the staffs were attentive & provided good service. Still a massive letdown!!

If you are planning to visit a restaurant near Jadavpur, then this might be the place for you. I think per head 250 to 300 rs is enough for having a good appetite.

Oh! How I love to hate this place!! Hygiene is lackluster, and to think that they are marketing themselves as a HACCP certified company!! When we came to the place, we were invited inside and told to sit on a chair with a bootprints on it. After telling the server he wipes it with a table mat. Then promptly places it on another table. An appalling state of affairs that makes you think twice about the quality of hygiene over here. And made me dubious about the quality of cleanliness of the cutleries and crockeries. The time taken to serve food was prompt, but that was because the restaurant wasn't busy. Quality was okay and the taste of food nothing to write home about. The price was not exorbitant but taking into account everything else, not worth it. I don't know about you, who is reading my review of bawarchi right now.. But I will avoid it like the plague from now on.

Well to start off with a flaw this time, 'cause there's only one, which is the    fact that service is pretty late. Do not, I repeat, do not take over - hungry people over here, for- in rage- they could turn into cannibals to feed on you {I say this from experience ;) }. So the rest of everything is pretty cool. The restaurant has a great ambience (ruined by our gang of 6 today). The food is pretty awesome, with a variety of dishes to choose from off the menu. Food is pretty good with flavors coming out nicely. I would like to recommend kababs, because that is the taste which is popping into mind 1st when I look back to this place. Presentation is ok,  the waiters behave quite politely and rest of the service is upto mark. All and all this place is nothing extravagant, but still quite a good pick to have a satisfactory meal and an overall good experience.

Bawarchi is a very popular restaurant in Jadavpur locality so I went to this place. Ambience is very good. The quantity of food is appropriate for two persons. Staffs  and waiters are good  and also very well trained. The main problem of this restaurant is the quality of food. Food is undoubtedly fresh but the taste is not up to the mark. I ordered mixed Hakka noodles , Burnt coriander garlic mixed fried rice , tandoori chicken and chilly chicken. They served the most worst noodles and fried rice  that I have tasted  till date. My friend found a piece of mushroom but I didn't so I carefully observed the whole plate and suddenly found a tiny piece of chicken and a diminutive piece of  mushroom .You may probably found a piece of chicken and mushroom and eggs under a high magnified electron microscope but not in normal eye. I think they do not want to use appropriate amount of chicken,egg,mushroom prawn so the taste is forlorn. Ordered my food at 12.40 pm and I got it  near about 1.35 pm. I will not visit this place again.

Pathetic experience. Went during durga Pooja and the music was so loud that we had to shout to talk to each other. When requested to lower the volume he directly refused. One guy with angry face (as if we killed his mother) came to take orders and his attitude was like he might scold us if we order wrong food.

There is nothing special about this Bawarchi than its other outlets. The food is ordinary with a below average quality. the environment is not at all good. Visit this place only if you run out of other options.

This restaurant is near to my place. Nothing to rave about ambience and food. It is just plain ordinary. Food menu comprises of both Chinese and North indian. I personally feel the Chinese dishes are better but not great though. Service is just fine. Pricing is reasonable. This is very popular in Jadavpur locality apart from Banzara restaurant.

Food is up to the mark.We tried the Chinese items.Had drumsticks,schezwan chicken,hong kong chicken and mixed non veg chowmein.One should certainly try the Hong Kong chicken..a bit spicy but it leaves a tingling sensation on the taste buds!
As for the service is concerned it was ok..not something which you expect in such restaurants.They should certainly look into the customer service part.

This is the place which I have stopped visiting after their quantity per plate started decreasing. Used to love the prawn noodles here. Another problem is their service delay. Donno they have improved over these days or not.
I know Bawarchi is famous for North Indian cuisines, but trust me their Chinese zone is not that bad either.

How bad can a biriyani taste? Though this is not THE worst that I've had, it surely comes close. Our order was quite simple! Chicken Azaadi Biriyani and Reshmi kabab. The order took 2 hours to reach from Jadavpur to Naktala. The biriyani was tasteless and the kababs were just too dry. The small chicken pieces which came with the biriyani tasted good. The potato was inedible. The chicken piece and boiled egg tasted okay. Not ordering again if I can avoid it.

They upload offers on NEARBUY and the staffs keep on asking about the menu and the price of the offers and all those. It felt they decided the quantity of food after listening to the price.We purchased a voucher from NEARBUY for a Biryani Lunch combo which was valid for two person. We were in group of three and one of us placed a completely separate order. But to our disappointment one of us was asked to sit isolated from the rest two. Despite ordering separate food with a new bill, we were not allowed to sit together. How inconvenient was that. Man we would not share the food for two people among three. We placed separate orders. But they felt we were that much uncivilized to share food among ourselves inspite having three separate plates of food. Never found such annoying staffs.

Just too bad- no other words suffice for the poor surfice, pushy waiters and substandard food that is served at this place.

We ordered a Butter Naan and Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala. The Naan that arrived was deflated and so no the soft, buttery naan that I am used to having at Arsalan or Only Alibaba. It was chewy and not appetizing at all.

The Reshmi Butter Masala had a curdled look. It tasted decent, but the pieces of chicken were so little! You have to have some guts to serve that and charge 200 rupees! I understand that during pujas, every restaurant should be given some leeway for inconsistencies in the quality but this was inexcusable.

We ordered two Biriyanis and they said Biriyani is out of stock, they won't take any order for 20 minutes. Coincidentally, this same thing had happened when we had visited this place 2 years ago on a Puja day. On a puja day, it is really unexpected that a restaurant teeming with customers will run out of possibly the most popular dish of the day. This not only annoys patrons waiting at the table, but also lengthens the queue outside. Anyway, we patiently waited with our Naan. Twenty minutes later, two handis of Biriyani arrived. It was way overspiced (there even was whole cardamoms in my dish) and the chicken piece in mine was again, too skimpy. My boyfriend's Biriyani even had a strand of hair in it. Though they changed the dish promptly, which I appreciate, this kind of thing really shouldn't happen.

One of those places that thrives by being the only decent place in a wide diameter. Serves run of the mill north Indian fare. The interiors are pleasing, service reasonable as long as you stick to standard items. If you order prawns for example the wait is inordinate. The location ensures a stream of customers most of whom don't seem to have any complaints....

Quality of food was really good,service was quick as the waiters are very co-operative(they have some really good suggestions if you are visiting the place for the first time) and the place is pocket-friendly!
Must try for college students who prefer cheap yet delicious food.

Located near Jadavpur 8B bus stand so you can get almost every thing to every where. At last boss it is pocket friendly, way cheap than many other restaurants, so if you are looking for a awesome evening this is the place to visit.

Bawarchi was my first choice ever since 2010 when I had visited this place with my college friends. From then onwards me and my girlfriend visit this restro almost twice a month. But from last a few visits, we are experiencing a very bad service as well as poor quality of food. Today's visit make me write my review on Zomato though I am not daily blogger here, as this was my worst experience ever. This time we have started with Fish Fry, which was not excellent but good. Afterwards, we went to try "Pan Fried Chicken Momo". May that was our biggest mistake. It was too much salty. Its outer covering was like leather coating and the inner stuffing was hard like stone. It was not such a momo with which we all are accustomed. And regarding service, it was pathetic. I have got an extra pair of spoon and fork after 10 minutes of asking for the same. The attendants are collecting plates/bowls from tables without asking to the user whether he/she is done or not. They have forgot their basic courtesy. 
So I think everyone should think twice before choosing Bawarchi as a place where they are planning to spend some quality time.

First off the ambience is sober. The lights meshes real well. Service was quite good. They clear the table almost immediately which I appreciate.  I ordered a pan fried chicken momo to start off with. The flavours were spot win but on the down side the coating was too thick but the flavours make up for that. Next up was the bawarchi special mixed rice and chicken in hunan sauce. I liked how the chicken was not chunks of meat but nicely n creatively sclied flavours were good the really good slightly on the acidic side. But what let me down badly was the rice. All the flavours of the chicken was overpowered by the rice which was a literally a factory of salt and the replacement was no better. The corn in the rice was not fresh it was really dry. The rice ruined it otherwise the momo and chicken in hunan sauce was a treat

Situated on the first floor of the Jadavpur CIT Market, it may look a bit incongruous. The food served here is satisfactory, if not despicable. The quality and the quantity of the dishes used to be creditable when it was in its prime, but with the passage of time, and perhaps, owing to the negligence of staffs there, both have degraded a great deal. A nice place, though not a perfect one, to sojourn with your family. Hanging out with friends at this place would be an act of absolute credulity.

Has practically been my second best food choice in the city if you want to have something tasty within limited budget. The AC sitting arrangement is comfortable with a good view over the Jadavpur bus stand, this place offers you very tasty food over limited budget. The quality of food is very good, the quantity being on the lower side. The place is well lit and comfortable enough to throw a birthday party or a family dinner. The "dry chilli chicken" has been one of my favorites, though very less in quantity but quality is unquestionable.

After watching Transformers 4,we were wandering at Ajay Nagar for a good restaurant and then we got the idea to go Jadavpur and try this restaurant of which I have heard since childhood but never had visited till last Saturday. At first we were little bit apprehensive as there was no usher to open the door for us. So we pushed the door by ourselves but after that we got a warm 7 smiling welcome. Now about the menu which one ZOMATO has uploaded is quite old. The new menu keeps the same dishes but in a more arranged way and prices are little bit high than previous. Then we ordered and get served within 10 minutes. The waiters were really helpful to choose the menu and at serving. Every dish can satisfy two moderately hungry stomachs. We ordered:
i)	Thai Soup: This was great in taste after adding little black pepper  and slt.
ii)	Chicken Sizzlers :  tastes quite good but not up to the mark.
iii)	Chicken Wings Chili Pepper Salt : Very crispy and tasty but did not find any trace of wins, just like round meat balls.
iv)	Mixed fried rice: Delicious!!  No other word for it. They are really good at it.
v)	Chili Fish: So-so, neither bad nor awesome. Less spicy.

Pocket pinch was just Rs.1046.00 but out of that Tax were >200!! But overall the experience was good and satisfying :)

I have had previously mixed reviews of this place. Being a resident of Jadavpur I did order a couple of times from this place but I the first thing I was informed was that delivery would take 1 hour(the place is a 2 mins walk from my place). However, the cherry on the cake was being made to wait for my food for 45 mins esp when it was a take away. The staff though courteous was extremely inept and more interested in gossip. It took a lot of patience, a firm word and a light tap(only a light tap and not to be misconstrued as anything else :) ) on the shoulder of one of the staff members following which it was brought to me. The wonder of all wonders was I got a biryani without chicken(which is rice) and my oh my....two potatoes.... Being too tired and too sick I proceeded to eat the uber awesome potato rice and decided to do what everyone does nowadays. Use the online avenue to voice my tale of (pota)woes

Withdrawing the previous review, creating a new one. Last visit 2013. After two nd half yeras, i decided to check in. Their food quality decreased. What i've experienced today are: 1) service is very slow, as we ordered chicken manchurian with non veg hakka noodles, it took almost thirty five to forty minutes even when the restaurant was empty. But they do serve excellent mutton and chicken biryani. I prefer north indian dishes to have here. Very well decorated. Waiters need to react quickly and positively. previous experience was better than today's. but it is always considered as an approved family restaurant.

Went to this place to have a quick lunch. Had Chicken Chowmein and Hot Garlic Chicken. Chowmein was average. But I found Hot Garlic Chicken a bit sour. Probably they have accidentally poured vinegar a bit more in the preparation. The serving time was normal but it was really difficult to communicate with the waiter  when required!!

Just above 8b bus stand in jadavpur in front of jadavpur university college. It is an ideal family  restaurant in the locality and remains packed house mostly. There are two kinds of seating arrangements - table seat and sofa seat. Food is okay. They serve afgani biriyani. I had several meals out here courtesy the treats from my adjacent college; be it be graduation trip , someone topping a semester or a birthday celebration. The restaurant is located in the first floor and the takeaway counter is located downstairs just in front of the entrance.

This is a very old resturant over here.but in recent past they have deteriorated so much in quality and service.
The ambience is what I have given points for. The dishes are not so out of the world.they are casualy made.but the main thing that I have noticed that they charge so much to have those dishes,which anyone can have in so many resturants with better quality and cheaper price. I will not dare to come here in recent future.

Most third class in terms of customer service.

Do not even think of taking tandoor Items biriyani and sensitive dishes.

Most third class taste you will have if u go in the restro.

This business runs on brand name. 
In terms of Quality and Value of money Don't visit or order expensive dishes.

If u want to have best quality food nearby jadavpur you can always think of Bedwin.

Its the only restaurant that will value your money and atleast you will be satisfied the service and quality they offer.

YOU WILL SEE 4 STAR 3 STAR AND 5 STAR . HERE AND THERE AS THEY ARE PAYING FOR SEO GPO AND SMO. BE CAREFUL 


DO NOT ORDER FROM BAWARCHI. ITS A SUGGESTION.

today took a home delivery. took murg masallam. A must try dish if you want to taste biriyani and kebab both...enough for two..tastes great. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was saturday.We were 4 friends.Went dre to celebrate bithday.we were confused over where to have dinner.after a lot of discussion we decided to go to bawarchi.ambience here gets 4 and decor gets 4.nothing special.we ordered for mix veg, lahori kadai paneer , mutton curry and chicken hydrebadi.they took time.we were served.i and one of my friend had veg and rest 2 had non-veg.talking bout the veg the mix veg was not at all up to the mark.some dhabas prepare better than them.never go for this food item here.paneer soft.dish was good.nothing very special.asked  the friends about the non-veg part, dey said that chicken dish was no doubt good but mutton was not upto the mark.for a restuarant like bawarchi dis z not acceptable.our billl was Rs.1096/-.The waiter was kinda waiting for the tip after the payment of bill but i didnt give as i didnt like much.

one more thing i want to add that when we were having dinner the table next to us had the ac above it.suddenly water started triping down from ac and fell on the plates of those two who were sitting under the ac!!...restaurants taking so much taxes shoukd keep in mind of these things atleast!!..if this would have happened with me i wouldnt have stayed there.

We friends didn't want to go to dinner. Instead we thought of taking a home delivery. Bawarchi is close to my room so we decided to order from there. 1 st of all the two phone numbers are given out of which one number was switched off. No issues as the other phone was working. As we called it was busy, next time it was ringing and no one picked up. Den after sometime they called I'd which was good. Somehow the call got disconnected. I called them, they received the call and asked for my number and also address and name. After giving all these they told that they hag computer problem. So I have to call again in sometime. After sometime called and had to give all details again.. Then ordered murg mussalam, tandoori roto, chicken bharta and also chicken tikka butter massala. On asking the time they will take to deliver they replied that they can't tell time as they don't know but they will try as soon as possible. After about an hour a person called again for the address. Sometimes later he came and delivered it. Total bill was 780. Gave 20 as tip. Murg mussalam was fabulous!!! Treat two chicken items was good. But the tandoori rotis were very hard.. .. Overall NYC.

I ordered food from this place so can't comment about the décor. The food quality was little disappointing. I ordered prawns, which was not cleaned and de-veined properly. I would not prefer prawn items from this eatery

This place is located just beside the 8B bus- stand, in fact, you can  easily notice the big banner of this restaurant from  the 8B  bus-stand itself. This is a decade old  famous restaurant of Jadavpur area.  I am writing this review after two visits and unfortunately i was not satisfied for a single time after coming back to home. 
Firstly, I visited this place with my large group of family members around two years back. At that point of time, I was not a regular food blogger on the Zomato, but I can remember this fact that  our total bill was near about 4500 bucks and we ordered two plates of Prawns in Chilli Plum Sauce but  both of their prawn dishes were of poor quality. When we started to taste our prawn dishes, we suddenly got a big whiff of a stinking smell. When we told the staffs about this fact, they seemed bit indifferent about the matter, we thought that they are going to exclude both of these items from our bill, but they included the price of the rotten prawns in our bill. We got surprised but they told that they are bound to abide by their rules and at last our 650 bucks have been wasted. Since then, I tend to avoid this place.

But today, I went to this place again as after coming back to Jadavpur around 8pm from office, both we wanted to relax at a restaurant with good ambiance. Then we decided to enter into this place as we two were extremely tired and yes, their ambiance is good. Now coming to the food. Today we ordered two plates of Mughal Azam-E- Biriyani and nothing else. We decided that if we get satisfied , then we could have ordered Mocktails too. They did not took much time to serve our food, but again, the food quality was not satisfying. The Biriyani which they served was not hot at all. It was cold without any aroma and the egg in the Biriyani was not cooked with the Biriyani, it was a boiled egg and they served it with the Biriyani and the taste was not complimentary to each other. As far as quantity is concerned, it is satisfying. At last, we felt that we could easily have Biriyani from the roadside shops at much more less cost, only benefit we enjoyed was Air conditioner with a decent ambiance. Our bill came out as 287 bucks including VAT and service tax. I would not revisit this place again.

This restaurant has existed for more than a decade. However, I have never thought of this place too highly in terms of food. Sure, it was one of our favourite budget hangouts when we were in college but not because the food was great but more because the food was affordable.
I last visited this place on 13th of March, 2014. I went there with my gf and her brother.
Our order was: Tom Yam Soup, Pan Fried Chilli Chicken, Steamed Chicken Momo, Fish Cake Pepper Salt, Dry Cooked Fish Fingers, Chicken Wings Pepper Salt, Jal Jeera with Soda and Green Summer Cooler.
We started with Tom Yam Soup which was a disaster. The momos were perfectly steamed and the fillings were juicy too. The Clear Soup accompanying the Momos was good enough. Out of the dishes that we ordered, the best two had to be the Fish Cake and the Fish Fingers (highly recommended). Jal Jeera with Soda was decent enough though I personally did not prefer the slightly sweetness in it. Overall, it was a good experience.

The decor is very nice.
Then there is one male staff, whose name I don't know, he was simply a delight. He helped us a lot to choose the items.
Some of the items worth mentioning are : Sliced chicken in hunan style, stir fried chicken kung pao style, bawarchi special fried rice (chicken), azaadi biriyani (chicken and mutton). 
The item azaadi biriyani surprised me a lottttt!! I mean kebab, egg, potato, rice everything in one plate. Wholesome and pocket friendly. Though not a very taste bud woo-er !! Still an innovative idea!! 
P.S. I would advise everyone to see the sign of CHILLY beside the item before ordering, because sometimes the food is incredibly spicy!! Other than that it is a nice place to visit.

I would give it a zero. I ordered for simple Fried rice and garlic pepper chicken and pan fried chili fish. They confirmed and took my order at 1 pm and said It will be sent at the earliest. I told them my guest are waiting. Bawarchi is located less than 500 mtrs from my place. At 2 pm when i called to check for the order they said that the delivery person has left and should reach us any moment. It was 2.20 pm we called up again the lady at the desk said the delivery boy's phone is ringing but he isn't answering, that's when we lost our patience and told them that we won't be taking the order anymore and disconnected the call. The delivery boy arrived at 2.40 pm. Bawarchi is never going to be my choice again. Will make it a point to inform people about this great experience of mine.

I went to this place with very low expectations and I was pleasantly surprised.

Located right behind the 8b bus stand, this restaurant has a pretty artificial waterfall to its entrance. The restaurant is basically located on the first flower and is well lit with a classy decor and comfortable surroundings. The manager and service staffs are extremely humble and would help you make the right choices with food combinations. 

The food is delivered pretty quickly. The quality of food is a little above average and there is nothing to complain about this place. I have specifically loved the thukpa. Since I did not taste the Indian section of food, I have no idea about that but the Chinese dishes are pretty yummy. 

A must go place for everyone staying near Jadavpur area.

Stepped Down in Bawarchi yesterday with a group of friends just to cross-check the food quality and the HOT DEALS, .......Needless to say just overwhelmed with the warm and cordial welcome and the quality of the food in such a low rate.
Enjoyed a lot with the service of the Restaurant officials, the food was served in time as we were toooo hungry and the total package came with a pleasant surprise -  the mindset we carried there after having read so much of negative reviews in Zomato by  few people, went wrong. The only thing came to my mind at that point of time - nothing can be judged on the basis of some so called REVIEWS until one get there phyisically and tested the same - no point of getting fooled by these negative conclusions and missing out on such a YUMMY!!!!! offer.

Nothing breaks the heart of a foodie other than bad food and awful service in a restaurant.  At least that’s what I feel and that’s what I experienced at Bawarchi. Located in the bustling Jadavpur area, Bawarchi restaurant attracts quite a crowd.  With a school and university nearby, this restaurant is doing good business in the recent times. But is the food at all delectable? A few would be able to answer this question. After all, a hungry gut craves for food and not a delicious three course meal.  My opinion about food is slightly different from others. I do not merely eat, I enjoy every morsel; I cherish the moment I’m having my meal.  The taste and the aroma of the food are more important to me than merely stuffing my hungry gut with aweful victuals. 

When I stepped into Bawarchi, with a group of friends, I had quite a different notion (a better one) about their food and services. I expected a number of waiters, running to and fro, serving a customer at every table.  What I saw here was quite contrary to my notion. A few bored waiters were casting languid glaces at the customers, reluctant to move and serve them.  We found a seat for ourselves and actually had to call one of the waiters to place our order. True, a lot of eatables were mentioned in their menu card, but half the items were unavailable in their kitchen. We ordered some chicken biryani and came to know from the waiter that it was not available. We settled for some chicken bharta and pulao, again these items were not available. Disheartened and voraciously hungry, we had to settle for some chicken fried rice and garlic chicken.  

35 minutes had lapsed and till there was no sign of our meal. Finally after some bickering, our food arrived. The fried rice tasted awful! And as for the garlic chicken, it tasted of anything but garlic. Dismayed at such awful service and horrible meal, we decided to satiate our taste buds with some yummy desserts.  We ordered full glasses of lassi and again were informed that lassi was not available. Half heartedly we settled for some chocolate ice cream and finished our meal.  Then and there we all took an oath not to eat in Bawarchi again. After all, we deserve better.

Bawarchi is one of my go-to family restaurants.
Convenient location? Check.
Satisfactory to great food? Check.
Fast service? Check.
The only food of theirs so far that I didn't like is their rendition of chicken steak. 
The prices are a little high, but the location is very convenient.
I recommend for a not-so-fancy but still enjoyable family dinner to all.

I visited this place on Puja rush, as I was looking meal at late hours. But I have waited in long queue more than 20 minutes to grab a convenient seat. When I entered the diner, it was decorated with flashy lights and wooden cravings. Wooden furniture was lined up very beautifully with mirrors decoration. 

It was Puja time so that we ordered Biryani which normally doesn’t hurdle much to come by. And to compliment our taste buds we ordered Bhuna Chicken. It was a rampage place though but they did serve us within 15 minutes. On the line of Biryani which was perfectly appealing to eyes and mouth as well. Though it was Puja time they did not decreased their margin which other people do. Biryani was the way it should be, perfectly cooked and loaded with aromas. In the Chicken Bhuna chicken was tender and gravy was flavorful and thick which goes well with Biryani. 

On the service matter they move very fast, they are suggestive too. This can be an ideal place for the family get together and small hang out with friends with good food on your platters.

This place is on the 1st floor of the building looming high just behind the 8B bus stand at Jadavpur. I went here eons back when they had just opened up. Among the things I distinctly remember was the swanky feel of the eating floor. It had the ambiance of a trendy watering hole. The psychedellic lights in deep glowing colours made it feel like a nightclub. The fact that we were kids probably enhanced the feel. :) The interior decorations were modern with smooth glass and polished steel design combos everwhere from the furniture to the windows. The waiters were courteous and service was fast. The air conditioning was a bit too efficient making the interiors freezing.  I recollect vaguely that we had order chinese. The only thing I remember about the food is that I had no complaints about it. And that the portions were quite satisfying.

Chakraborty Tip : This is one of the few places in the Jadavpur area where you can have quality food at near about average prices while lounging in a deluxe atmosphere.

Starting off with location. Excellant and prime location, right next to 8B Bus stand at Jadavpur. 
I went there on a weekday at around 8:30pm with my family. There was not much rush (about half the tables were filled in probably because it was weeknight). The family restaurant was on the first floor. The ambiance, decor and lighting was pretty standard and good. 

Here is what we ordered:
1) Chicken clear soup - Rs 100/-
2) Drums of heaven - Rs 175/-
3) American Chopsuey - Rs 140/-
4) Mixed gravy noodles - Rs 105/-
5) Butter Naan - Rs 30/-
6) Murg Shahi Butter Masala (6 pieces in a plate) - Rs 180/-
7) Sweet and sour chicken (Chicken pakoda tossed with diced vegetables, pineapple and sweet & sour sauce) - I forgot the price...

Mixed reaction for taste. Chicken clear soup was awesome. In fact it was one of the best clear soups I have had. Normally clear soups are blunt in taste but this one was real good. Other dishes had standard taste (for me that translates to good). Sweet and sour chicken I thought should have been a bit more on the sweeter side. Overall, I would say good.

Service was pretty good. The orders were immediately taken and food delivered at very reasonable time. In fact the restaurant manager himself came down to our table and asked us how the dishes were. When we said that the Sweet and Sour chicken might be a bit more sweet, he personally tasted it and told us that next time onwards, while ordering if we mention this, they would take care of this aspect. Well done Mr. Manager!!

Definitely a restaurant you can try out.

We had the pleasure of dining at the new Bawarchi yesterday evening. We ordered rice noodles, gravy noodles, ginger fish, ginger chicken, chicken biryani, fried rice, etc..

We enjoyed our meal very much. The food was not oily. The taste was balanced. Good flavours. Good value for money. Clean place. I am definitely going to go here more often. - these are the main reasons why i have rated this high. 

What I liked most / found most useful was the chili indicator in the menu
I definitely liked the menu design and details provided for the items
As I hunt for clean flavours and found it here, it is very much in my list of places to dine

Its hard to miss being right beside Jadavpur 8B bustand(Opp. JU 2nd Gate). Has a separate take away counter(with a lovely and mentionably helpful lady at the counter). Known for its variety of Biriyani(s) which they also proclaim to be low-fat. Tried the mushroom onion egg fried rice.Seemed nice. Provides 20% discount to college students with I-card. Has got variety of dishes. Indian dishes more bankable. Should try Mutton Azaadi Biriyani.

Lat time i had been there was with my friend. And i have just one thing to say: DON'T GO THERE OF YOU WANT YO TAKEAWAY THE MEAL

I mean you can wait for over an hour almost with the restaurant having very few customers  and still your order not being delivered. Which implies that their service is not so good.
  on the contrary being a lot light weighted on the pocket, the food quality is descent. No such special mention as they don't  have any such speciality!! They are a restaurant selling indian, to chinese, to mughlai etc all.

In the world of real estate they say LOCATION is the only deciding factor.How very true and relevant for this joint.Located at Jadavpur 8B bus  stand, this joint enjoys its steady stream of customers.Close proximity to the university,bus stand ensures it gets its share of customers representing all sections of society.
I can comment only on the take-away service.I had tried out items like chicken reshmi butter masala,dal makhni, chicken tikka butter masala, veg jhalfrezie and the staple roti items.Some of the items were pretty tasty while some were ordinary.The  dal was surprisingly good considering the fact that very few joints other than the Punjabi dhabas get it right.The chicken dishes comprised of chicken kebabs cooked in a thick rich gravy.The reshmi butter masala had a whitish gravy while the tikka masala had a fiery red gravy.Decent enough but not outstanding.The veg jhalfrezie could have been better though.The presence and aroma  of cauliflower kind of killed the flavour of the dish.
Size of helpings are adequate though based on hearsay i got to know that they have been reduced in recent times.I have heard that the joint also serves different types of biriyani though am yet to sample them.
Strictly a run of the mill joint that has a huge seating area and a separate take -away counter at a prominent hard to miss location.If they manage to pull up their socks they can do a great favour to the large foodie population in this Southern part of the metropolis.

Till now I have not seen such a bad behavior by the floor manager. Not at all customer centric. Food quality also not at par with other restaurants in Jadavpur. Their advantage is only the location that is near 8B bus stand in jadavpur. Far better option is Banzaara in Jadavpur if we consider the behavior of the staffs and  food quality.

If such an attitude exists with the floor manager then really dont know how will they cope up in the long run.

If possible I would rate this restaurant a big zero.

Went there for a quick lunch between pandal hopping and I got more than I expected.

The place has a nice ambiance. Dim light, Cozy seating arrangement, prompt service.

The dishes I tried were The Azadi Biriyani, the chicken fried rice and Chicken Sezchewan. The quantity was good for more than two people.

Don't know the significance of the name "Azadi" biriyani but it was great. It had been a long time since I had such good biriyani. First spoonful of rice in my mouth and I knew I have struck a goldmine of biriyani. The texture, the flavor, the spiciness- everything was simply great. The mutton was perfectly cooked and was soft and juicy. The Kebabs they serve in this dish are really tiny pieces although I must admit that those tiny kebabs also were nothing but perfectly cooked.

The fried rice, on the other hand, was not up to the mark. The rice, it seemed, was not boiled enough and thus it was a bit rough.

The Chicken Sezchewan was alright. Not great but a good side dish.

All in all, a good experience.

The food is what I loved, only tasted the veg part nd it was awesome, I loved the paneer it tasted one of best of all that I had in the past, the smoothies are just awesome, you will have to taste them to know what I am speaking.

This is a popular restaurant located near Jadavpur 8B bus stand.The place serves North Indian and Chinese food.But the place is known for the different types of biryani they offer.The quality of the biryani is nice.They are worth a try.Apart from the biryani the other items are average.
The ambience is okay.But the service is rather slow and they somehow find it difficult to manage when the place gets crowded.
I also quite like their rolls in the various Bawarchi fast food outlets across the city.

Now a swanky dine-in restaurant, Bawarchi serves both Indian and Chinese food. However, most customers come here for the different kinds of biriyani that they serve.

The biriyani served here is quite decent, even if they have the bad habit of putting boiled eggs in it. The Mutton Badshahi Biriyani is a nice heavy dish, one of which can feed two to three people. The Chicken Azadi Biriyani isn't bad either.

The side dishes are pretty standard. Over time, have had the Chicken Bhurta and the Murgh Reshmi Butter Masala, and found them to be average. The kebabs aren't good, though, and should be given a miss.

Bawarchi was known for its huge quantities per dish: now, quantities have been reduced, which is sad. The service is decent,. but when the place gets crowded, it becomes very slow. Even so, it's a nice place to go to for a meal.

During my days in Jadavpur this outlet of Bawarchi had been a place to knock the door very frequently.
I have to say we didnt think much when we were hungry and simply we used to decide to step in there,because of its locaton.
Location wise it is in a very teeming place, just behind the 8B Bus Stand. So, they never run out of customers.

But honestly saying, the food is not up to that mark which they pretend to show. Some foods are very good, but most of others are average.
Varieties of items are available in menu (if you are lucky then its available on your table as well).
Biriyani and North Indian items are ok. I liked 'Raita' very much over there.

Compared to the standard of the taste the prices are very high, I have to say. You can find many places all around Jadavpur or nearby serving better food in lower cost.

Ambiance is good, but needs to be improved. And service somehow is not at all up to mark. They really need to learn that service is one of the main factors that can impress customers, and make them pay for the bill happily.


My Ratings-

Food-3/5
Service-2.5/5
Ambiance-3/5
Value for Money-2.5/5


Overall-3/5 [ If you are really hungry, then head in. Otherwise there are many places around which will impress you with their taste and service]
