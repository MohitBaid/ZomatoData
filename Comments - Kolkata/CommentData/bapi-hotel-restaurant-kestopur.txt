The food quality here is not upto the mark. The service is not that good but the staff interaction on the other hand is good. Only the thing that I like here is Roomali roti and tandoori roti.

Once I have tried their Biryani and Chicken Chanp. Everything tasted very bad. Biryani was dry, having lots of dalda. Also the chanp lacked tenderness. Overall it was a horrible experience.

Biriyani is good but needs to be upgraded.chicken dishes are good. Rice and normal meals are of average quality. Price is comparatively cheap.

Used to be a very popular restaurant in kestopur at one point of time, i used to like their biriyani but over time it has degraded in their quality and taste.

Decent restaurant,  shouldn't expect too much from it. Food is good,  though its quite rich and spicy. For quick takeaways this place is good. The price is reasonable. The chicken tikka masala and the chicken chaap are worth a try.

The only place in Kestopur whose Tandoori Roti and Rumal Roti ar worth a try. Apart from that they have pretty decent Tandoor Meat preparations. Biryani is just like someplace else.

Okay this hotel is what you would ideally call an average hotel.But I am a resident of Kestopur.So when I'm unable to go far for eating out this used to be my only destination.But Bapi Hotel has improved its quality a tad high by these days and is worth giving a try if you're really hungry and and around the locality.My eating suggestions would be-try anything but their biriyani and tikia.Those sucks!!You can though try their noodles part.Its above average to me.

Bapi hotel used to be our one and only source of biryani years back when there was no big names associated with Keshtopur and Siraz and Arsalan were too far for us kids to go and satiate our craving. I remember my brother and me going to Bapi restaurant and ordering a packet of biryani with our pocket money and satisfying our taste buds and stomachs. Bapi biryani had it all... chicken/ mutton, boiled egg, a piece of potato and biryani rice. Though it was nothing compared to a Siraz or Arsalan biryani yet it satisfied our biryani cravings as kids. They also serve chinese items and other dishes like rumali roi, chicken tikka, moglai paratha, paratha, chicken/mutton chaap, etc. Bapi is basically the restaurant for the mass and used to do monopoly business at one point of time. Now with a lot of competitors around the busines has suffered but the very name of Bapi Hotel is nostalgic for people of our generation.
