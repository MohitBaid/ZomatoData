Great ambience, awesome view, ideal place to soak in the wind and sun, open air pleasure, food is average but can be discounted for the location

Cool calm place and a kiosk to serve you with few beverages and tea at reasonable price and a romantic ambiance to spend a quality time. People gather here to move to the island so easy to locate. Nice joint.

The kiosk located at eco park. They're another branch of cafe ekante which doesn't need you to take the boat ride.. as they are on the side of the main park itself. 
There are a few tables.
And mainly people queue up at this point to move to the island. 
Also, the menu is limited. A little more than I thought it would be. We sat there sipping coffe which costs about 30 bucks. 
But again, there being very less food stalls at eco park, this definitely helps.

This sit in place was more like an evening snack out place. They have a crisp menu serving chops or fritters with some hot beverages. The pricing is easy on the pocket. The ambience is super nice. A nice romantic hangout place!

All for the ambiance. Nothing much to talk about the menu but a nice place to have a cup of coffee with snacks and to enjoy the sunset of a winter afternoon.

It's a really amazing place to spend time. The ambience is great. It's in eco park on the lake. The food is amazing. It's not a pocket friendly place but a place one must enjoy once.

Kolkata is always my favourite destination for lip smacking food, great and innovative platting and good ambiance.
Well I was taken to this resto by one of my foodie frnd.. it was raining that evening...and the entire feel was really really amazing.
We ordered for the Ekante special platter. This plater comprised of a chicken preparation, a mutton preparation, a fish item and an egg with a handful of rice. It is a continental cusine.
I pretty liked all except the fish preparation. The fish was kind of stinking I felt. The half fried egg was also not looking decent...the yolk was also fried hard.
The Beverage that I ordered was something made of mango pineapple and apple with scrumptious ice cream. Nice it was.
Overall on the boat having good food on a rainy evening was a great experience !!
