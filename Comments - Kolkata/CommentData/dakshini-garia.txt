Discovered this place and had the try their south Indian cuisine. The dosa they served was almost authentic as it gets to a dosa prepared by a south Indian outlet (I lived in south India for years). I would recommend everyone this outlet.

Good food for the vegetarian people...south Indian foods are very good and authentic. They are neat and clean and the waiter is also helpful to understand the choice of food
