A disappointing place, the name of the place raised my hopes but these hopes were dashed by the quality of food served. The taste of the food was not up to the mark. I can't say that it was bad but not delicious either. When you have so many small joints opening up and serving delicious food then you just have to up your game to stay in the race. The place was absolutely empty with only two other people at another table.They didn't have any dessert available too that day. The staff were extremely courteous and well behaved albeit the service was a little bit slow.

My friends and I like trying new eateries so tonight we headed to The Enchilada for dinner and a long chat. The restaurant is right next to the Lake Road CCD and has glass windows that give diners and passers-by a mutual view. There was only one other table (apart from ours) that was occupied and just one server at work. We ordered the Burnt Garlic and Chicken soup, two flavoured mojitos, a Chicken Enchilada Special pizza, Chicken Lollipop, Chicken Lasagna and a Chocolate brownie with ice-cream. Food was delicious! I was pleasantly surprised to find such tasty food at such affordable prices at such an unknown eatery. The pizza was just right, not too doughy....not too crunchy. The soup was perfectly balanced. The brownie was the dry crumbly sort but tasted good with ice-cream. Exceptionally executed were the Chicken Lollipops and the subtly spiced but cheesy lasagna. Will definitely visit again for their Mexican food!

This place is best if you want to go out with your family. Really warm ambience. Even though the service was really slow, the quality of food surpassed it. Even received an apology from them stating that they lacked staff due to holiday. Looking forward to going there again. :)

The events took place today, the 13th of December 2017. I had placed an order for a soup and a pizza. It took them one hour to serve the soup and after another fifteen minutes I was told that they can not serve the pizza and are extremely sorry for it. Atrocious service.  Neither would I ever even dream of revisiting this place not will I recommend anyone to try out this place.

A great place to try out desserts.... we particularly loved the sizzling brownie... as it is to die for... mango float was okayish... oreo shake and brownie sundae was good... the caramel custard was very average. Courtesy staff. Great place to hang out with friends..

The place is great in terms of ambience and service. Very neat and cosy. Since have visited mostly during evening time, food ordered mainly comprised of beverage, must mention coffee is excellent, pastas brownie sandwiches nd pastries. All tasted amazing. However one time had ordered chinese for take away and it really tasted bad. I love d place and wuld really want dem to improvise d chinese dishes.

Enchilada is a Mexican dish serving tortillas wrapped in meat and chilly sauce. Approximately a kilometre walk from the back side of Lake Mall will lead you to this place. Neat, tidy and quiet, the cafe would often go unnoticed. The menu was short and crisp. We had ordered Brownie sundae, House Special Caramel Custard with Vanilla Ice cream, Sizzling brownie with vanilla ice cream, Kitkat shake and Mango Cremosa. Each of the desserts were equally good. Recommended for a long adda session with friends.

Had gone here during the pujas. The restaurant had no ppl other than us. The food was excessively priced as per its quality. Food is not at all good. The worst thing is that they won't serve you regular water. If you want water that is the basic need you will have to buy it then only can you have water at their restaurant. The other thing was the bill was near about 700 bucks yet they didn't have any facility of card payment. Please don't visit such a restaurant.

The Enchilada - A great experience.
=====
Location & Intro:

The Enchilada is located in Lake Road, Southern Avenue where previously Aqua Java was located. 

The place is quite nice and neat. The ambiance of the place is quite modern and has quite a large seating capacity. I was greeted by Md. Wasim who was the steward there and was quite warm and welcoming in taking my orders. I went there with my brother as well as a great friend Sayantan Da to have a brunch. 
=====
What we had: 

• Omlette - It was nice and tasty. 

• Irish Coffee - The irish coffee was super amazing and piping hot. I really loved on this one here. 

• Garlic Bread - The garlic bread was presented nicely and tasted great too. The pieces were enough for two.
=====
Meal for two: 450-700 approximate. (Prices are subject to change due to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, etc.) 
=====
Pros:

• Quite spacious.
• Great ambiance.
• Reasonably priced.
• Good hospitality. 
• Hygiene is maintained properly.

Newly opened joint which serves continental italian and chinese.The place is located on lake road and have a nice decor. Coming to food, we didnot try much. The menu had bacon bt it was not available with them so we had to go with dry chilli chicken and some shakes. Both of them were ok types,not the best of them.

This restaurant, named after a Mexican dish is a new kid on the block. It has a cafe style decor. The staff were courteous and greeted us inside. Bryan Adams, Enrique numbers were playing softly in the background.

We ordered CHICKEN STROGANOFF, CHICKEN LASAGNA and CHEESE GARLIC BREAD.

Quantity was decent and was enough for the two of us. Taste was good for all the items each of which seemed to have been cooked with care.

The only thing I did not like was that we had to buy bottles of drinking water. There was no other option other than to buy each bottle at double the MRP price. I think plain drinking water should be served for free.

Pocket pinch was around Rs.1000 for two which seemed to be a bit above reasonable.

i went there on panchami to have lunch after pandal hopping.The service was not good and i ordered there a fresh lime soda, chicken lolly pop, chilli baby corn, mexican rice, mexican curry. they served us too late and the food was not tasty. fresh lime soda and chilli baby corn were good but a bad smell was coming from chicken lolly pop. mexican rice and mexican curry were too bad. so, eating at this restaurant is totally a waste of money. They need to upgrade their service as well as food quality.

I went there on a very quiet and calm rainy doshomi evening, there were beautiful lights all around the place and well it looked magical. Coming to the food we ordered a chicken barbque pizza which serves four at a very reasonable price... It was delicious and thin crust with we loved it. .. We also had chocolate truffle.. And special enchilada brownie..its a must try for everyone going there. I love it.

Its kind of pocket friendly as well.

Well this is a new restaurant at Southern Avenue...Went to this place yesterday to have lunch and had ordered crispy chilli baby corn , chicken lollipop, Mexican rice and Mexican curry....corn was good but the chickens in chicken lollipop were rotten and a bad smell was coming from the food....rice and curry had no touch of Mexican in them....So eating at this restaurant is totally a waste of money and is not safe....

The place is reasonably good in all aspects.go for home made chicken fillet with grilled vegetables and smashed potato.also try chicken barb q pizza and enchilada brownie and in starter,chicken cheese quesadilla will be an extra enchanter.but the chilli garlic noodles is very much spicy than expected. And lastly mexican rice and mexican chicken curry are carrying average marks.

I found this restaurant very cool in all respects like location, ambience​, service, menu, taste, price range etc. And on top of it, the smiling welcome and orderly behaviour of the staff are just too good to be true. I recommend that those with good taste buds surely have a visit to this restaurant.

Food must be improved. Work on the food you cook. Would have rated 1star if the staff were not that good. The nachos were something everyone could've made at home.
