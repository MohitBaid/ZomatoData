A fine sweet shop that sells all your favourite sweets.
Ocasionally you may stumble upon something new also. Just make sure to taste them.
It has a wide variety range and the shop is well maintained .
Available almost everyday throughout the year.

Tried their Chocolate sandesh as bought in by a relative. It was really good in taste and would look forward to try some more of their servings.

This is a famed sweet shop... Hence I tried my hands on their rosogollas and sandesh. Sandesh was gud but the rasagolla could b better. They have a wide variety of sweets. Easy to locate, clean and hygienic with proper packing.

There can be no doubt that Satyanarayan is a class act. The various varities of sandesh, rasogolla, kalakand, gulab jamun, kalo jam, mihi dana, singara, etc are fresh and tasty. You must try out the rosogollas when they are hot it feels amazing. So many memories i have from here, i will share one - when i was younger my dadu used to take me to the market with him on sundays and while returning home he always used to treat me at Satyanarayan with the hot kachuries and alu sabji and also a rosogolla at the end. This was the sole reason i always used to look forward to these sunday market visits.

Can't complain about the sweets, kalakand, singara and a few other sweets are of special mention. The rosogolla when served hot are mouth watering, can't stop having them when hot. Located at Haridevpur. The staff are well behaved. Keep up the good work.

An old sweet shop as I have come to know. Tried a couple of sandesh and rosogollas and singaras (Samosa). Nothing great to talk about. Taste was descent, nothing special. Service is quick.

Perhaps an old shop serving here for sometime now. Had tried their Singara on the go. Tasted decent. Behavior of the staff was okay, nothing friendly.

Location: Near Gurubachhan Singh Sondhi (GSS) Girls School; Opposite Tollygunge Railway Station.

This Bengali Sweet Shop has been here for years now serving the people of Kolkata with a fare of decent quality. Earlier this sweet shop used to have quality products, but, slowly with newer places coming up, Satyanarayan Misthana Bhandar has taken a downhill route. Having an array of sweets to offer, it also has a few snack-type savory options. SAMPLED the following from what they had to offer:

- Samosa
Prepared in the Bengali style with a non-spicy filling of diced potato, roasted peanuts and Indian-spice seasoning. Sadly, the unevenly fried samosa was greasy and the filling wasn't as flavorful. Has scope of improvement.

- Sandesh
A nicely prepared Sandesh it was. Soft, moist and mildly sweet.
 
The STAFF wasn't as friendly as they could be but, did serve at a nice pace.
PRICES were found to be reasonable.

Overall was a below-average experience.
