If you have too many voracious eater friends who eat like it's their last meal ever, this is the best place to treat your friends, owing to the ample quantity and minimal price. The lighting inside is pretty dull, so don't expect the picture quality to be out of the world. 
A relatively small place, this is a famous restaurant in the Nagerbazar area. 
The food quality good enough compared to the price. If you're looking for a place to eat to your stomach's content, at low cost, this is the place you gotta show up at.

I am not gonna write anything good about this place because this is such a shit place. Management and gate keepers are very unprofessional. They don't even know how to behave with a customer.
Seats were empty and they denied entry because they wanted to see all the other 9 people with me. This is actually happens when you give the job to the gate keepers not the managers. Just learn some professionalism and show some respect to the customers. 
You people just spoiled our new year Eve.

Have been ordering and eating here since the last 17 years, This place has been the best restaurant in the Nagerbazar area. The space is a bit cramped up but the way they decorate it and maintain it makes it beautiful. I love the lights here, the ambiance has a romantic touch to it. Now lastly the food they serve is amazing, specially the Indian and Continental dishes are too good. Would recommend Chicken Tikka Butter Masala, and also try the Mixed Sizzler. I have been eating here since childhood and can assure you the food is healthy and delicious. The prices are very reasonable. I would recommend every one to visit at-least once. The place is always crowded during Dinner time.

I found this place super economical serving good quality stuff..located at satgachi more with twin outlets..the decor is a bit congested..less illuminated..service is quite fast and good..wen u r hungry and ur budget is less..this is The place for u..
Chicken tandoori my all time favourite from this place..perfectly cooked..loved it..specially their spicy pudina chatni..
Chicken tikka kebab is good as well..
The dragon chicken is a showstealer..the sauce is hot and tangy..
Their special chicken lollipop is heavenly..hot and spicy soft and juicy..crisp as well..
The crispy chilli chicken is average..
The chicken sizzler ah well..not the conventional one..
Sauce is good..so is their veggies..specially the babycorn..i loved the pineapple..the chicken was a tad bit less cooked..less in quantity..paneer was an unwelcome guest to my taste buds..
The butter naan was pretty good with sesame seeds to garnish..
The chicken shakua somehow tasted somewhat like a keralan curry..a tad bit spice added to top up the taste...
The special chicken and mutton biriyani both were extremeley well cooked..specially the meat..i bet they make some good biriyanis..
The schezwan chicken fried rice was just average..overzealous use of spice did kill the flavours..
The taaj special chowmein is good enough.mixed chowmein garnished with sunny side up and prawn chips...special indeed..
The chilli chicken dry is pretty good..
The masala coke was full of jaljeera..so average..
Overall a place to eat ur heart out without worrying about the bill..

Close to nager bazar, this place will not be dissatisfying if you gonna visit it. 
The interior is just dimly lit, with the background music pouring in and adding with the welcome-ing ambience.
The service was prompt. 
Me and my friend had only the chicken chowmien (hakka). Quality and quantity were satisfying. But I was too disappointed with the table side ketchups provided. Those were expired, their taste told.
The prices were reasonable.

We were seated on the other side of the main restaurant building just opposite. The place is quite cramped and dimly lit. We ordered eome chicken tandoori. One of the worst tandoori I ever had. We also ordered another starter didn't called baby corn fried chicken. It wasn't as bad as the other one. But it was certainly lacking the crunch thereby tasted a bit full too. The main dishes however weren't as bad as the starters were. The Schezwan chicken fried rice was particularly nice (quite spicy). The chicken fried rice was milder but tasteful. We ordered some Valcon chicken and chilli fish. The former was quite good. The chilli fish was okay ish. Nothing much to talk about the service. It was a bit of a mix between reluctance and lethargy.

Today we went to Taaj just like everytime. And ordered Masala Kulcha which was worst in taste. Simply there was no masala inside the kulcha. Secondly Egg fried rice which was a Chinese item and they made it just egg pulao becoz the rice taste was sweet just like pulao. When I told them about it, they were least bothered to hear your feedback. And they have also changed their old cook. So friends their food quality has become most worst. So please avoid Hotel Taaj restaurant to waste your money.

Food in restaurants during Durga Puja means less quantity with high price. 
But this place proved me wrong. Went there with my family. I've gone there many a times as it is beside my place. 
Ordered food more than we should've thinking they might serve less quantity during Durga Puja. But I was wrong. They served the same quantity which they usually serve even rest of the days. 
Taaj special noodles was very tasty. You'll get mushrooms added extra with egg chicken and prawn. You'll also get a fried egg and three pieces of prawn papad on the top of the dish to garnish it. 
I really liked the food. Both the quantity and quality is too good. 
The service is also very good. 

Price for 2: 600

Food: 4/5
Ambience: 3.7/5
Price: 3.5/5

This Restaurant is located at Satgachi, Nagerbazar. You can see their lights flashing as soon as you reach Satgachi. I have been visiting this Restaurant since 1999. I had tried Momos for the first time in my life at this Restaurant. And it tasted heavenly. Though they do not make the best momos anymore, yet I still try out their momos once in a while to revisit that nostalgia. The soup that comes along with the momo is my favourite. Personally, I love their Chinese Cuisines more than their Mughlai dishes. My personal favourites are Fried Rice, Garlic Prawn and Chilly Chicken. Their Chicken Bharta is also mouth-watering, but is on the oilier side. Do try their Kabiraaji and Sizzlers. The waiters are warm and friendly. The man at the gate recognises me and greets me with a smile. Pocket pinch is very moderate. Just that the restaurant is not that spacious, and the tables are a little crammed up. Overall, I keep going back to Hotel Taaj because of the food and the cozy ambience.

Can be located easily if you are going towards Diamond Plaza this will fall on your left at the Satgachi crossing. Its well decorated restaurant which will provide you with a variety of dishes.The dim lighting gives it a very soothing feeling with soft music being played background.Overall the ambience is heart warming.

Coming to the food, we ordered:

1.Sweet Corn Soup(non veg) it was satisfactory the quantity wasn't so much and also didn't taste good.

2. Drums of Heaven for starters which was perfectly done with the right amount of spices and the chicken was soft too.

3.American Chopsey which was again a good one.The quantity was good enough and can be easily shared among two people.It had a lot of veggies and a lot of shredded chicken.

4.Mixed Gravy Noodles,now this disappointed us a bit as the taste was not so good and after few minutes the gravy dried up and gave it a yak feeling we had to waste almost half of it.

Well one thing they take a lot of time to serve the food and had to wait for long hours. And the seating arrangement is not such widespread so you will definitely face a problem if you're in a big group as we had faced.Well we were only five so therefore be careful.Else its a good pocket friendly restaurant .

Thunderstruck summon!

At least that we are routinely facing here in Kolkata. Thus, in this day I had to face it being a thespian of this grand city. Nevertheless I adored the strong whips of nature, drenched myself with it and survived it to reach my destination, The Taaj. 

As the title suggests, it was an astonished summon by the lady to share the time on her special day.

On our valuable counsel, she decreed for one baby corn chilly veg and chicken soup as starter. And for main course orders were mixed fried rice, hot & garlic chicken, Singapore fried rice and Valcon prawn. Quantity was enormous, however quality was bit sweet and easy to avail kind of. Nonetheless moment was precious to us and they too provided that well.

Nothing extra ordinary though.
The quantity is ample and the price is moderate.

The Chilli Chicken is really good and the Mixed Fried Rice. 👌

Had momos once and they were kind of over boiled. That wasn't impressive at all.

Eating here since the past two decades probably. 
Recommendations: Tandoori/ Butter naan with chicken butter masala/ chicken kassa.( Won't recommend chicken bharta. )
Chicken fried rice /noodles and chilli chicken. Chicken hot and sour soup.
 Note: Their quantity is quite large and one plate of fried rice will serve 2 people easily. Ambience is good . Sometines the quality is not consistent (mainly on Sunday home deliveries) .

Located in a humble neighborhood, this is your pocket friendly & appetite pleasing restaurant.
The place is nicely decorated and is perfect for a small budget date.
From starters to main course, everything was served and cooked expeptionally well. I personally prefer to have Indian dishes in restaurants like these and make sure to avoid Chinese. They will screw it up, i promise.
Ordered Chicken Baby corn for starters. It was subtle in taste.
Main course included
 Chicken Amritsari - It tasted up to expectations.
Chicken reshmi Butter masala - To my surprise, it tasted really good ( not the authentic mughlai taste though)
Chicken Tikka Butter masala - The same as previous.
Chicken Bharta -Almost all small Restaurants tend to cook bharta in whatever way they want to. Damn it! Chicken Bharta is losing it's essence and authenticity.
With Rs 500 for two , you can have an appetizing lunch.

Numerous time i visited hotel taaz because i simply enjoy the food served there.The ambiance of the restaurant is nothing extraordinarily decorated but with low light and soft instrumental music at background makes it very peaceful. Points to mention about this restaurant are prices of the menu are within budget(no exclusive tax included in the bill)the behaviour of the staffs are courteous,foods are tasty( The Chinese cuisine) and especially their soups.Every time i visit there soup is a must have for me.But food of Indian cuisine are not satisfactory to taste bud.Another con to mention is that their service is too late and obnoxious.
Conclusion:Hotel taaz is really a cheap and within budget restaurant near nagerbazer. Regardless of the cons one can definitely risk their taste buds here.

A humble joint that serves excellent quality food. In my personal opinion, they specialise in fish and prawn delicacies.

Pros -
i. Golden Fried Chili Prawn - this dish is a must try, prawns fried in chili peppers and chinese sauce.
ii. Fish Kabiraji - One of the best fish Kabiraji I have had.
iii. On time delivery - The delivery is always on time and food stays hot.

Cons -
None

Overall -
Since I order food from here I cannot comment on the ambience of the restaurant, but I am looking forward to a personal visit. Only after then shall this review will be complete.

Went there today for lunch. Ordered chicken reshmi kabab, chicken tikka kabab, mixed fried rice, garlic chicken and family fish. Kabab and rice tasted really good. The chicken pieces in the garlic chicken were little bit hard. The family fish could have been less salty. Ambience was good. Staff were helpful. Will visit again for the kabab.

Two outlets situated at Satgachi More serving decent quality Chinese and Indian Food.
The ambience with low lighting and instrumental music is quite soothing.
They do not charge any extra vat or taxes which is quite good.
The service is prompt.
The quality of food has deteoriated over time.

At the first sight, u would not want to go in, but the aroma of the food is what pulls u in..!!
The first thing inside is a very dim lit restaurant - typical 90s setting.
Ordered Chicken Gravy Noodles and Hot Garlic Chicken..!!
Man it was yummm..!! The gravy noodles was spot on and the Hot Garlic chicken was amazing.
-1 for just the service boy being a lil awkward while talking rest i would really come back..!!

This hotel, being less advertised, is often ignored. Ambiance wise it is not up to the mark. But when we are talking about the food quality and quantity, it is one of the best in North Kolkata.

The chicken bharta or shredded chicken in cashew nut gravy is really awesome and finger licking. I am a big fan of this dish.

The different kind of rolls available here are too good. Apart from these, all regular dishes are available.

They also have home delivery system. Its Located at Satgachi .Food is quite affordable and staffs are really great.

Was their for dinner with my family with two kids from entrance till exit after dinner was not at all up to mark first no one comes to your table for next fifteen minutes we had to look for one and their was only one server in that Restaurent of 6 tables then the order was written and repeated by our server but still one dish was missing when food arrives,then we receive a bottle of water after asking and the bottle is full of dust( photo attached) but no glass for again next 15 minutes and when the glass comes it is wet and not wiped and kept on the table(photo attached) then after when we were done with our starter main course took 40 minutes ( not even 3 course menu in hotel will take so long to serve the food) then our one food dish which was missing we expected it might come later but nothing came so we dint even felt like asking.
 So over all experience will be big round 0☹️
Server attitude also- 0 because when we asked him to give us clean dry glass he face was showing it all.
Food taste 1.5 average as I liked only one dish from our dishes.
 May it is a running outlet as per the local people choice  but Personally prefer to go their again so don't expect any changes their.

Though slightly overpriced but this is certainly one of the better restaurants in nagerbazar area. Situated near satgachi more,. Nagerbazar, this place offers a great variety of food. This place is well known for their biryanis and kebabs .
Their dining area has a nice theme going for it. But as good as the theme is, I feel they have made it a little too dark. 
On my most recent visit I had ordered
🍽️ Reshmi kebab
🍽️ amritsari chicken butter masala 
🍽️ Butter naan
🍽️ Butter tandoori roti.

Honestly speaking, all the dishes were great, I did not find a single flaw with any of the dishes. The Reshmi kebab was just bliss. Amritsari chicken butter masala was cooked to perfection. Could not have asked for more. The naan and tandoori roti, both were tasty and huge in size. Both quantity and quality wise Hotel Taaj stands out. The service was also very good. 

If you are in the area do check this restaurant out. It is worth it.

Located at satgachi. This restaurant is quite an old one in this locality. It has expanded its joint also. The service is prompt. The interiors of the restaurant is great with less lighting and another notable thing about this restaurant is that you can hear the instrumental music of the old melodies. The home delivery service is also quick.

The only complaint that i have is the gravy of all the indian chicken dishes tastes the same. And the use of raisins and cashew is in abundance in almost all the gravy dishes. Even the masala kulcha has raisins and cashew in it. The flavour of the chicken do pyaza and the mutton do pyaza is the same. The mutton keema served has less mutton and more of the fats in it. The pulao tastes awful and the scent overpowers the dish so much that it makes difficult to eat. The schezwan chicken served is not up to the mark. The momos are also not up to the mark with huge sizes and less fillings.

The Halim is my favorite as it's a very un-common dish. In today's competitive market Hotel Taj still maintains her pride & prejudice...congrats from my side.

Perfect place to have Chinese food. Specially the noodles and mixed rice is yumm. The biriani they make it's spicy, i wish it was lighter. The price is pocket friendly but not cheap.

Well, just while returning hungry from workplace decided to visit this place and had ordered veg haaka noodles, chicken and mushroom, rumali roti and paneer butter masala and must say that each and every item tasted so good than what I had expected while entering the food place.. Dark, soothing ambience with an interesting decor and aquarium turned on my mood and its good food really made me happy.. Everything was so fresh and soft except the paneer which was a bit chewy though the gravy was perfect but with this must agree that the staffs was so well behaved and I am surely gonna visit once more! 😊☺

Ordered chicken fried rice and mushroom chicken for home delivery today evening. However in the chicken preparation I got, there was no trace of any mushroom present. When I called them, they came up with a mere excuse that they have delivered chicken manchurian by mistake instead of  chicken mushroom though they charged for chicken mushroom!! The only remedy they suggested was to keep the bill and they will adjust the extra 20 rupees which was more for the price of chicken manchurian. Hence I was forced to consume chicken manchurian and believe me that too was not at all even a standard manchurian dish!My question is: Why would I accept a sub-standard chiken manchurian when I ordered and paid for mushroom chicken?

This an old restaurant near satgachi auto stand but this it is always crowded. They have two outlets just opposite to each other. Food and service is decent. Pocket pinch is not too high. A good place to order from for serving guests. The view of the chicken chaap and biryani from the outside through the glass tempts you to try it out. Interiors are not too spacious but a little congested. A good place to treat your hunger.

Shared a terrible experience with my friend.

While this place is now a fossil of its own glorious past however it was once a preferred dining option for many localites. 

Though I used to visit this place quite often mostly for takeaways, today I was utterly disgusted when I went to the place for dinner. We were requested to move to another table at one corner directly in front of the AC as they had to join tables to fit in a larger group to which we reluctantly consented on being promised to increase the temperature of the AC. Once we had moved the staff did not pay any heed to our repeated request of putting the AC higher. On being repeatedly insisted their manager stepped in who with his blunt & rude attitude refused to do the same & gave us the option to shift to another place. Having frequented so many diners throughout Kolkata I could not possibly figure out how they have managed to keep such an insolent guy who doesn't even know how to treat the guests to manage the place, but then it struck me that this might be one of the reasons why they have been steadily losing business in the recent past.

Since we had to catch a movie we did not move out but chose to have our dinner making a point to never ever visit the place again.

P.S: Dear Mr. Manager thank you for ruining our dinner & consider the healthy tip that we had left with the bill as our parting gift & not a token of your splendid service.

My friend told me to give this place a try , so he and another friend of mine tagged along with me.
Ambience is cool and funky with the dim lights and designs. Service is prompt.

We went for Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala , Rumali Roti , Mixed Fried Rice and Sweet N Sour Chicken.

Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala was hard and had problems swallowing it.

Rumali Roti was okay.

Mixed Fried Rice was really good but the prawn was of inferior quality.

Sweet N Sour was average , the chicken was really hard and had problems chewing it.

Overall an average experience.

The price is very reasonable and the quality is very good, the staffs are well behaved the ambience is very soothing. If you're looking for good food without making a hole in your pocket then "TAAJ" is the only answer. Happy customer since 1 and half year.

A restaurant nearby my house. So decided to review it as I had been there tons of times. The place is well decorated and maintained for an average priced restaurant. The food is also decent although the quality drops during pujas.
 For starters try their tandoori chicken, or if u are looking for chinese try drums of heaven,crispy chicken or their soups and you wont be disappointed. 
The place offers a variety of indian and chinese cuisine. Biriyani is just average but you can try their gravy chowmein or mixed fried rice and it will be a bang for buck. Chilli chicken is average but you can try other items like chicken manchurian or szechuan chicken instead.
Overall a good place for your family outings and a good value for money.

Hotel Taaj is located at a couple of feet from Satgachi more. The setting is of old school restaurants with a pseudo wooden setting, a fish pond,ceiling hanged table and old instrumental music playing in the background. The food quantity is good. But the quality varies with the cuisine. The Chinese is mediocre at best, but the Indian dishes are well made, specially the bharta and do piyaza. . The service is polite, but a little delayed. And despite the good quantity , the prices could have cheaper by 4-5%.

Omg! What an overrated place in that locality. Their food is below than ok, their interior & lighting are horrible, you hardly can see what you are eating. Whenever I entered that place it felt like entered in a vintage adult studio, just like bollywood portrayed it. Sitting arrangements are also bad. Foods are massively over prised, considering the quality. And service! Ohh.. They don't know about their foods, and if you complain, they wont hesitate to make an argue with you. Over all a very very poor choice for a meal.

Located near nagerbazar this restaurant serves almost all kinds of cuisines. Have been there a few times but mostly it had been take away or home delivery. The food is reasonably good and so is the quantity but with one problem, the price. The price is nothing exorbitant but you might just expect a little better quality but no complains as far as quantity is concerned. Do try this place out,but beware if you are very health conscious. Many of their sides are extremely oily,so much that you cab see a oily layer on top but it tastes good anyway.

Ordered some Chinese food a few days ago, and at the end of my intake found few small plastic material cooked with the noodles...threw away the rest of course!! Side dish was average. Found some bones too whereas their price is on the higher side.

Taaj is good in all types of Kebabs.
The chicken fried rice is the best, then we like the chicken bara kassha with lots of spice, (which they add on our request). We like tikka Kassha a lot. With chicken biriyani it's the best you can have.
Although, the item for concern are soups. The soup preparation are not up-to the mark. 
The vegetarian dishes are also tasty. Daal Fry is my favorite.
Service is always excellent. Staff is very co-operative. They provide home delivery till late 11pm.

I have had the momos from here. They are too oily. I like the chicken bharta but even for this dish they need to keep the oily side down. The prices are on the lower side hence easy on the pockets. they need to keep up their standard to retain their regular customers as they have a lot of tough competition around.

This is my second visit to this place and itvwas a hell lot of years ago..

Location-10 mins walking from Nagerbazar towards satgachi more,then take a right..

Ambience-Decorations have been same for years and it quite and small place though they have opened another outlet just opp to it..

Food-we ordered for chicken Amritsari kabab,American chopsuey,spcl mutton kasa and tandoori roti.
Chiken Amritsari kabab(6pcs)-we were overjoyed by seeing the size of the kabab but little did we knew that they serve kabab with bones and more over the kababs were tasteless..The chickens didn't had the tenderness and was hard..
American chopsuey-This item turned out to be good and was tasty..The noodles were crispy and the gravy was sweet and spicy..it contained vegitables and even boiled baby corn..Overall satisfied as not many restaurants can make good chopsuey..
Spcl Mutton kasa(4pcs) -This gave a nice smell..The gravy was spicy to our liking and was the right dish that we were looking for but the mutton too was not soft and gave a feeling that it was preserved for days..
Tandoori Roti-It was good and big and more importantly was fresh and soft..

Service-Service was qick and smooth.The guy name DEV was the one who looked after our tabel..He was pleasent..

Pricing-According to the quality it High but keeping in mind about the price in the market it is intermediate..

It's one of my favourite small chinese restaurant in my locality. After long time yesterday we visited that place to celebrate our parents anniversary. Food quality & quantity are awesome. I liked there mixed fried rice. Also, yesterday we have tried golden fried prawn. It was great taste & prawn size was excellent. Other food also very tasty. There indian dish is also Very good. I recommend this restaurant for all the food lovers.

Located in a narrow lane in satgachi jessore road...hotel taaj has two outlets just opposite to each other,,
serves both Indian and Chinese cuisine...I HAVE ONLY TRIED THEIR CHINESE,,THEREFORE THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON THEIR CHINESE ITEMS..
The food is really good and tasty,,sweet and sour chicken is a must try ...
although the place is very small..the ambience is perfect for romantic lunch and dinner,,very dark lightings and cosy tables WILL SURELY add a sparkle to your meal with a loved one..
SERVICE IS VERY RUDE AND IMPOLITE
prices are okay okay..actually a tat bit high for a resturant in satgachi area 
RecommendeD  ONLY for casual dinning ,,,
THE AMBIENCE AND FOOD WONT LET YOU DOWN

This is like a hotel which I have ate from my child hood... so I am not biased with my review... I during my school days ate tarka and rumali Roti with the pocket money... but later on I tried every item in the menu card from crab to mutton to jumbo prawn... I can assure you the taste would not let you down... the only problem is space crunch... even sometimes it is uncomfortable sitting and eating in the table if the place is crowded

Chinese is very very very poor. You literally need to search for the goodies in fried rice and their noodles. And I suggest that never ever eat there during festivals. And their items are way overpriced wrt their quantity. You can get the same mughlai dishes @haji's at nagerbazar more which are better in flavour and quantity but it is only takeout. Try Taaj's chicken bharta. It will deliciously surprise  you.

This is amazing to find Hotel Taaj on Zomato. It is next to our neighbourhood in Kolkata and interestingly I was their first customer when this restaurant opened almost two decades ago. What an awesome experience...the management used to send me bunch of gifts every year of their anniversary during Rathyatra and made me feel special till I left kolkata.

This restaurant has grown immensely with time, many restaurant came and closed down but Taaj has sustained and continued doing great business. They have maintained great quality quantity and affordable pricing.

This restaurant is nostalgic to me anytime I am in kolkata I'll atleast go ones and eat here. Their chinese and Indian both are tasty. Taaj Biryani is also pretty lip smacking.

Where ever I go this will always remain my special restaurant.

I was here last wednesday after a long time. The ambiance has not changed much, still a cosy place to spend some time with average food. We ordered chicken chowmein hakka and hot garlic chicken.
The taste was average...what is best about this place is that it still offers half quantities and that is an advantage for some.

I like the tandoori items and kebabs very much. One thing to suggest, please don't order biriyani here. 
Waiters and gatekeepers are well behaved. 
One thing I like very much is the soft background music. Mostly instrumentals. It creates the ambiance.

Taaj is like the big guy around here. Or maybe was. But that being said they have huge dining space. Like everytime they have bought out their adjoining spaces. Well ambience is old school romantic cabin like. With old instrumental songs playing in the background. The Chinese I will say is average but then many people swear by its Chinese to be the best in the region. So maybe my bad luck . The Indian items are good. Any chicken Indian gravy is good. The price have slowly started rising towards the higher side. But we'll the quantity is good. I really recommend their bharta. Its really good. Overall  someone you can depend on for good food.

The biryani was served with two piece of mutton, soft mouth watering, i don't know it was mistakenly or not and with a piece of aloo. It tastes very good. The chicken was also very tastey. Looking forward to visit again very soon.

This is our goto fail safe order in place nearby. Their food is fairly standardized and so is our order. The special momos are these huge chicken momos doused in a red, shezwanish sauce tossed with some capsis and spring onions. Their Chicken Bharta is unique, to the effect that i havent had such a bharta anywhere in kolkata (and i havent had that dish anywhere else apart frm kolkata!). Its a white gravy based bharta with dry fruits, pineapples and cherries and its like a hybrid between an indian and a continental chicken dish. Their chinese food is quite decent too. I havent experimented with their menu, primarily because they dont have a takeaway  menu! So lets see i might pop in at their main restaurant sometime and take a look around!

Been a regular at this place till a year back maybe. Nice ambiance, very easy on the pocket, good food. Located just off the Satgachhi-Baguiati auto stand, this used to be one of my favourite quick-date options. Loved the tomato-chicken soup! One of my fondest memories that one. The chicken kebab varieties are also all quite nice. Not a huge fan of the biryani here though. One thing I wouldn't recommend here by the way are the momos. A bit on the costlier side, but very dry-ish and not worth the money IMO. Recommend it I will though! Looking forward to visiting this place again.

Hotel Taaj is a very old restaurant cum take away centre in Dum Dum area. Located just at the Satgachhi more, Taaj provides all type of cuisines which we regularly opt for. Recently they have opened another 2 storeyed branch with enough sitting arrangements. I have had the privilege of having the take away only so far. Talking about quality, one thing for sure, they dont sell old or "baasi" items..I have tried chinese and indian mughlai dishes and all of them were really nice and in good quantity. They run on card payments as well if ur bill is above 200. But for home delivery they charge 30 to 40 rupees based on the distance. The best item one should try here are - Chicken tangri kebab, mixed fried rice, and any chinese chicken preparation. They also serve haalim upon prior booking and off late they are working on serving crabs also. For dum dum folks, in a standard budget, I believe this is the best restaurant if I consider the big food chain like aminia, lazeez and arsalan (opening shortly) out of conparison.

I started visiting d place from my school days when me and my 3 pals used to pile up d saved pocket money at d end of the month and just went there to order food tht we could afford tthat time.it was and it is always a wonderful experuence. The place is small bt cozy and the waiters r well mannered ,polite and always a quick servers. I love almost each and every item from their menus (except d veg part,as i never order anything from that as i m a strictly non vegetarian). I love ther chicken reshmi kasha,dry chilli chicken and mixed fried rice most.they offer plenty of kebabs and tandori items(each worth a try) and their pakodas are simply wow. Best part is after d lip smacking experience u will nt only find ur stomach is heavy bt ur wallet as well.this place actually serves best quality budget food in d whole dum dum area.

I went to taaj with my friends for lunch. It is located in satgachi near nager bazar area. The ambience is okayish but the food is quite good. We tried their chicken lollipop chicken momo and paneer pa@koda for starters. Paneer pakoda is simply yum but a bit spicy. For main course we had fried rice, veg Manchurian, hong kong chicken and masala kulcha. All the dishes were delicious. Overall a good experience.

Well. I grew up to this. For 20 years i have been living on this. While mostly i opt for home delivery, at times i went to the resturant as well. Located almost on Jessore Road, near Satgachi. This place is not hard to find due to its immense popularity and glitters. The ambience inside the resturant is nice, at least the old one, never visited the new one opposite the old. They extended, so we know how the business runs. Reviewing food for 20 years is a huge ask. So. Will keep it short and point wise.

Tarka : By far their best dish. It really is the thing one should order down here. I love Tarka and very few can match upto their level in Kolkata. It's too good. Perfectly made.

Biriyani : Well, this is good too but the quantity when they give in home delivery, i less, really less. The rice is well cooked, the aloo, something the Calcuttans love in their Biriyani is well made and the meat too is fair enough but that much for 120 odd bukcs is awfully less. Although i am unaware of the amount they serve in the resturant though. People say it's a lot more when compared to home delivery.

Chicken Bharta & Paneer Butter Masala : Two of my favourites. The shredded chicken pieces and the buttery gravy, yummilicious. The quantity for this is fair enough and price is okaish as well. Same for the paneer, they give you around 6 or 8 big pieces of paneer and it's enough for two. Definitely try these.

Chowmin : The gravy chow is better than the Hakka one but again, it's a matter of less quantity and more money. It's really well made and filled with veggies and almost enough for one person when you eat in the resturant but when ordered back home, you struggle to be fully content but taste is really good.

Momo's : This is what Taaj is known for in this area although i havs had better momo's. Any day. Ordered Chicken Steamed Momo's and many recommended it to me but was badly disappointed. It's like having maida with a filling of chicken. Which was enough but the taste otherwise was horrible. Don't know about the fried one though.

Fish Fry - This is again of okay size and price too. It's fairly filled enough with fish and not completely a disappointment.



Overall, it's a nice place to try out your taste buds, you wont be disappointed but if you can, then, have at the resturant.

Hotel Taaj. A name that I heard when I was an infant. I was in 5th standard when my dad took me for my birthday dinner. Has been hooked since. Well, won't use the word "hook". It has nurtured me since then.  The food is like what you would like to eat on a Durga puja evening, or a certain Diwali dinner. Not full marks, as there is a space crunch. But it has grown in that place. Can't complain.

You want Good tasty food in dum dum area...this is the place. Me and my friend were very hungry and we landed here. We ordered tandori chicken and chicken fried rice and hot garlic chicken. Since my friend and I don't agree on anything when it comes to food and this is the reason why such a mismatch of dishes.
The place has a very nice ambience.  Since its just 1day before valentines the place is decorated with all things heart shaped. The staff out there are very polite and friendly. From the door keeper to the waiter everyone is very well mannered. Food was good though I expected the hot garlic chicken to be a little more spicy. Overall a nice pleasant experience will be going back to try tiger prawns!!

Taaj - credit for holding on for a decade and a half. There will definitely be some good in the way they carry themselves out. Guess, the target segment has always been people who has just wanted to eat out. The Indian, Chinese fares are just about ok, though the taste varies from season to season.
The other noticed factor has been the dimly lit spaces, one can play dark room if they are through with dinner.

We as family been dining here since it's launch. They have maintained there quality very well and changed with changing time. The Chinese items are better compared to indian ones through the chicken bharta stands out. But the best dish here is the special taaj momo where u get 10 huge chicken momos ( I love the fried ones) drenched in a great sauce along with a bowl of soup all for  ₹210 only!!!! My sister-in-law who used to live in Nepal says they are as good as the ones they ate there.

One of my most favourite local restaurants in nagerbazar area..taaj never disappointed me a bit. Though ta restaurant lacks space inside..still i would never stop loving this place. I never have any complaints regarding their quality or quantity. Place is dimly lit which attract couples quite often. Good place for families even. Though recently they have increased their price all of a sudden..i still believe the place is worth it.

Nagerbajar area doesn't have good restaurants like central kolkata or the south part of the city. Scarcity of a good restaurant is so prominent that most of the people living in this part of city goes to central Kolkata to tame their taste buds once in a while. Park Circus has arsalan, new market area has aminia, chandni chowk has chung wah,   southern part has kimli, bhojohori manna’s and other well known food outlets...

But Nagerbajar area really lack on this part. The nearest place you can go to find a good restaurant or say a landmark restaurant is shyambajar and its golbari.

Aminia opened their outlet near nagerbajar recently, but to find good Chinese food in this area one need to spend a lot of time. But as a foodie I can say The Taaj is the kind of a blessing for us.

I have been in Taaj various times with my friends and no one disliked the place. For a big group of people the place is kind of small, the only drawback of the place is the space. Otherwise from cooking to the atmosphere inside the restaurant is very good, waiters are well behaved. 

Be it Chinese or be it mughlai Taaj won’t disappoint you that for sure. There are quite few names in the menu like volcan chicken/fish ( kinda sweet dish and it comes with a egg poach which gives a nice texture to the dish in a visual basis), then there is Rambo chicken , I will ask people not to order this if  you are not accustomed to eat spicy food, cause this dish surely will bring sweat on your forehead and nose. 

The fried rice is oily but tastes good, and noodles are good specially hakka noodles, lots of veggies and chickens and lot less oil. It is good to order noodles if you are up for Chinese. As a starter one can always take fried chilly chicken. 

I won’t say much, you need to visit Taaj to feel the love they are sharing with good food and with the warm hospitality. Go with family, friends and let people know about Taaj and make Taaj a landmark restaurant of eastern part of Kolkata.

hotel taaj is closest from my house just a road cross and voila in front of your eyes there it is.. the food items are costly pocket pinching but they quite fabulous  and one of the better restaurants in our locality  which serves some authentic continental and chinese and indian ..though not a big fan of the indian here but for chinese cuisine its a thumbs up from my side !! continental is still left to be tried so i kept it in my tab to try it next time !!comming to the ambience never visited inside the food well i had bitter experience of tasting indian foods not very smooth or subtle but their chinese dishes cover it up most of it the pocket pinching price what makes it tad bit nervous about to whether take it or not !! and yes you have to wait  a long time for a parcel of any particular food item other than biriyani!!! you have to bear to that otherwise its a food paradise for food porn like me!!

This is one of the least talked about restaurant keeping in mind the standard of food it serves. It specializes in chinese cuisine, not the delicacy. Mixed fried rice is the one I would like to recommend. But its Chinese side dishes are ok, not brilliant. Fried rice of taaj can be easily comparable to that of any five star restaurant. Overall ambience is good but there remains scope of improvement. It is a kind of a place where you can take your loved ones for a nice dinner or lunch.

Went there to give my birthday treat to two of my friends. Ordered chiken bharta, manchurian chicken and roomali rotis. Chiken bharta was on a sweeter side with cashew and raisins, i would i have liked it a bit more spicy. Manchurian was good. Spicy and there was 8 pcs chicken which was tender and juicy. Rotis were hot and soft. Bill was quite nominal. If you are a spicy food lover, try their rambo chicken. Ambience is nice and cozy.

Went there with two of my friends for lunch..
Had butter naan, which was average, chicken bharta, which was pretty good, and chicken sizzler, which was absolutely rubbish.. It was no sizzler at all, just some kebabs, with a bit of butter, to bring the sizzling effect.. Their north indian chicken preparations and rotis are quite good though..

Again a Local joint for me. Visited and Ordered for home delivery countless times. I've literally watched it grow. A place really popular among locals. The ambiance inside is average. But the food is quite good. The Chnaaps are quite good here be it chicken or mutton. the price is reasonable. But please avoid it during Durga Puja because the waiting time hits the ceiling.

The best restaurant in my neighborhood. I visit  here often with my friends and family. The Chinese dishes are quite delicious. I love the special chicken bharta, garlic chicken. Momos are wow. And the quantity of fried rice is enough. Quite affordable. Although it's a small restaurant yet it's neat and clean.

Hotel Taaj - a name quite popular among residents near NagerBazar. It is situated at Satgachi - near the auto stand. 
I had to catch up with one of my friends, so we decided to drop in. 
The ambience is not very good. But then that is not what you except from these kinda eateries. Highlights of a football match playing on the TV, probably only for the staff, as the TV is situated at one extreme. Anyway coming to the food.
We ordered afghani murg kabab, tandoori roti, and chicken bharta. 
The service was very prompt and pretty quick. The afghani murg was a bit spicy, juicy and tender, exactly how I love it. Along with the mustard sauce, it was pretty decent.
I am a fan of the chicken bharta which these guys serve. Many people dont like it due to the fact that they add dry fruits to it. But I am always game to have Taaj's chicken bharta. And along with the hot tandoori roti, it is a personal favourite. 
The bill came around 400, inclusive of tax, which I believe was very ordinary.

A big thumbs up. Taaj is among the few good restaurants we have in North Kolkata, and I hope they continue with their standards. :)

we ordered for tangri and sheekh kebabs in the starter with fish pakora...and in the main course had chinese ...i preffered chicken hakka noodles and mixed fried rice with hongkong and schezwan chicken as side dish..i liked the food specially kebabs were awesomee though the fish pakora was so so..their chinese dishes are great and the schezwan one was veryyyy spicy ..yumyum...

In and around the locality i live in ,this is by far the best option i have when i want to try out home-made food for dinner ......... i order from here quite often but is yet to have a dine-in experience here :) ....... i think this is the best local option u have in baguiati and nagerbazar area ,its competitors being 'China Green' or maybe even 'India Lord' ......
They have two branches(two restuarants with same name) ,one in either side of the road ...... but with a common kitchen  ..... the takeaway section is on the right if u enter from satgachi .....
Food quality is quite good ....... pricing i would say just slightly on the higher side as compared to other local restuarants nearby (but of course not as high as compared to other popular and top eateries in the city) ....... i normally order mixed fried rice and and any chicken side preferably chicken manchurian ...... for once i ordered hongkong chicken but they give too much of red sauce in it ..... but in manchurian chicken, the gravy tastes quite balanced ....... 
Other than quality, the 'quantity' they give is worth mentioning ...... for an avg person 2 plates would easily suffice 3 people ...... i would say its quantity is in par with that of HOST chinese restuarant in LakeTown ......  though HOST being a winner in number of chicken and prawn pieces they provide in fried rice :) .......

One of the oldest, finest, well maintained resturants of Nagerbazar. I know and visit this since 2003. They have some boring staff but they deliver both quantity and quality food portions at the same time...

Those who, in the previous reviews have written "confused", "small space" and for the future readers. BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD IS HOTEL TAAJ. The right side(while entering from Jessore Road) is the original outlet. It is full AC and 2 floor. Total 12 Tables. The left side is the new outlet. It is also full AC and 2 floors with total 20+ tables. Though they are on both side of the road, they have a common kitchen.....

First the bad points..
Very confusing which is what when hotel taaj are located side by side..well if that's not confusing enough then the indoor environment and the lighting will be enough to confuse you or even give a concussion. .very terrible lighting..also the space is also very limited..small and compact environment..

The good..the food is excellent..well they taste , they smell good, they look good and most importantly they come in good quantity..add a cherry on the top they are reasonable..the waiters are well behaved, attends well and good but over do anything plus keeps knowledge about the foods..

The worst..half plate and full plate prices don't differ much..too less variety of foods..and excessive use of baby corn everywhere..the seating space is also very clumsy and less spacious..no bathroom facilities..

The best..food food and food..the ambience n food quality makes up for every negative point..moreover you can sit as long as you can..no taxes extra..prices quite reasonable..privacy kept intact..

Pros :
- Ambiance is good. 
- Food pricing is correct
- Food quality and quantity is satisfactory for the price being paid for it
- A rustic feel to the place
- Attractive and quiet environment
- A good place for couples to go on a date

Cons :
- Place is too small
- Can easily get overcrowded, which can become a headache
- Not suitable for a large dinner/lunch when lots of people are involved
- Service is not up to the mark.

Conclusion :
This place can be taken as a must visit if you are looking for a moderately priced eat out in a quiet and rustic environment. The pros overpowers it's cons, so it can be taken into consideration for giving a visit.

This restaurant has been constantly serving great food for more than a decade. I've eaten here several times and have been satisfied everytime. The food and service is excellent and feels nothing less than a top class restaurant. However one of the major drawbacks of the place is its lack of space. This restaurant is really small. And despite the fact that they have opened another outlet a few years ago, on the opposite side of the road facing the main restaurant mainly to increase the number of seatings, it barely makes any difference. People mostly come to this place to order take away parcels rather than dine in and thus they have two or three counters outside the restaurant for taking orders. But due to its very awkward location and a notorious illegal auto rickshaws stand on a very narrow road it makes it all the more difficult to even order a take away parcel and leaves us with no choice but to ask for home delivery which of course is not at all free. They take at least 20 rupees for a delivery to Shrachi Garden residential complex which is barely a 2 minutes walk from the restaurant and there is no guarantee of the time it will take to reach your home. Overall this place is doing great only because of the taste of its food and its convenience for the people living in that locality. Other than that there is hardly anything to attract customers. And frankly judging by the business they fo everyday due to their local customers, it seems to be the least of their concerns. I would therefore rate the place 3 out of five only because of the food and the hospitality.

I am a regular at ‘Taaj’ so I will be biased. I usually call them to deliver there food and they do so within 45 munities. In good days take-away lines are huge and the place is a bit cramped so I prefer to call them up.   The food is really very good and I like there north Indian preparations more then Chinese. Prices are not over the top and the quantity of food is adequate. I generally have chicken tikka butter masala or chicken bharta with nan roti and frankly its not one of those typical north Indian dishes you find in shopping mall and office hangouts which has hip full of tomato ketchup and food coloring. I recently had “Tikka Kosha” which was amazing I highly recommend it and tengri kebab as well. All in all it’s a well known place in nagerbazar, the food is perfect for Bengali pallet and to people like me who likes to eat until they drop. 

A no-frills restaurant with value for money and tasty food. 
It's good for a take-away; they also have home delivery on an extra charge of 20 rupees. It's not so good for a dine out option. The space is cramped but the staff is very polite. 
The Chicken Tangri Kebab is delicious, and the Biryani is quite light. We have had both Chinese and Mughlai items and were not disappointed on any occasion. The food is also reasonably priced with good portion sizes. 
A reliable place with a satisfying experience.

One of the oldest restaurants in Nagerbazar, Taaj is the place for a take away. On any week day  you will find the queue in the take away section nearly half the size of the one in front of the auto stand. they have three/four counters to receive the take away orders. They have a perpetual stock of Rumali roti too it seems. 
Within the restaurant, it is very dark and cramped - it is not very comfortable but the food is tasty. their Chinese section is also very good - the portions enough and prices reasonable.

This place is average in terms of food, but the ambiance covers for it. There are two Taaj hotels on both side of the road, both are equally good, I think they are extensions. The good food includes chinese items but the north indian dishes are good too. I have seen smaller places, so I don't mind sitting here and eating. The service is good too. On a good day you won't be able to find any inconveniences here.

I prefer home delivery and take-away considering the lack of seating inside the restaurant. Immensely over-priced in its menu, this place often leaves your packed orders half filled. Though the food here is really good, especially the Chinese items but over the years Taaj has degraded to such an extent that it is obvious not to recommend anyone for a dinner there or to think about it twice.
