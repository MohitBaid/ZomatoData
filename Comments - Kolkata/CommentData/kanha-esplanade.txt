A regular place for tea and snack at any given point of the day. Though snacks are oven warmed and served, I prefer this place for its cleanlines. Just love the pyaz kachodi, malai toast and raj kachodi here. Kachodi sabjii here is somewhat ok but, don't try a sandwich here.¬†
This place also needs crowd screening at evening time else regular ones like us will start avoiding this place.

This is the worst outlet for sweets where they serve stale sweets. The staffs are not aware of the price of the sweets and when asked they will give you fake prices which is certainly way above when it's billed. Absolute shame!!!

Located almost opposite cesc this place has a huge variety of goodies. We bought club kachori..jalebi... quite nice . Idlis dhoklas are also available along with biscuits of many varieties. Murabbas ..juices ..snacks like bhujiyas are also sold. Quite spacious and neat and clean. The biscuits ..pista biscuit and almond biscuit tasted awesome albeit a bit too sweet. Some other biscuits which were decorated with nuts were crispy ..nutty..and balanced on sweetness.

Highly disappointed visiting Kanha last morning for breakfast. Simply put nothing worked our way, there were not many options to choose from, though the food was hot so were the heads of the attendants and the sitting area as well. Sitting right underneath the air conditioner we were sweating. 
The only good was that the food tasted edible and affordable. Not quite the kind of thing I had expected from this place. Disappointed.

Good food at reasonable price, except for the sandwich. We ordered cheese masala dosa, chola batura, pav bhaji, lassi, indian thali, club kachori, kesar chai, dahi bada, sandwich and papri chat. All were tasty. The quantity was good too, except for the sandwich and lassi. They charge Rs30 and serve not even a full piece of bread. And lassi's quantity was less, when it comes to it's price, otherwise the taste is good. 
Ambience not that nice. We noticed rats moving around the kitchen.

It was just out of hunger that we went to kanha. 

I tried their sweets...Special mention should be made of rasmalai and gulab jamun...Were made to perfection..The softness and sweetness 

I also tried their club kachori and radha ballavi...Both were too good and tasty...

About their service..no complaints...

Was feeling like having a chaat, so Kanha became the option. 
The ground floor consists of sweets and savouries counter, and the first floor is the place where you sit down comfortably, watching the busy crowd on the street through the glass window and munching on your favourite snacks. At least that's what I did. It was clean and tidy. I ordered mixed chaat. It satiated my craving. It was certainly very tasty and the quantity was enough for one person. 
Parking is a problem so one should come without car.

Kanha is a well known sweet shop serving regular sweets and savouries.
However, I don't like the gujiyas (sweet) they serve.
The gajar ka halwa and the lassi needs a special mention. They are amazing. The gajar ka halwa is not extreamly sweet and has an amazing aroma of ghee (you can see how they have NOT compromised on the quantity of ghee). It is priced at Rs.380/kg.

Lassi is thick and smooth and the dhoklas are soft and fluffy!
So when, you are near this area, you ought to try the gajar ka halwa and lassi, for sure! :)

Recommended. :)
Happy eating!

This place has two outlets in kolkata and is mainly known for its sweet and snacks.Its a two storey shop(Ground floor for selling sweets and snacks and 1st floor is a dining area).We mainly visit this place only to have their "Pyaaz kachori","Ras malai" and "Sambhar vada".The service at this place is quite fast but sometimes you will find their sweet items out of stock.

The food there is not up to the quality, just had lassi and it was a torture to the same. Also the south Indian is no good, just the d√©cor of the place in good. If one is looking forward for quality food please avoid the place. There is a man who sells phuchkas/ pani puri in front of the gate try there instead. Or head to haldiram in the opposite pavement, or head to anand or madras tiffin short distance from the place.

The sweets of kanha are really delicious. As my office is situated at Dalhousie I often visit there. My all time fav is Motipak and Mawa Coin there. Apart from that they have Dry fruit barfi, Choco barfi, Badam barfi etc. In every bite of dry fruit barfi u will get many dry fruits. They have a snack counter too and seating arrangement is at first floor. Kanha is a pocket friendly place too. My family really likes their sweets.

My exam centre was near Kanha. 
So after my exam I decided to show up there with my friends. Undoubtedly they had fully utilised their place and it seemed to be good. 
But there are certain issues:
Firstly, we ordered Club Kachori which was tasteless. 
Secondly, attitude of staff was not good at all. They were not cooperative. While we were having our meal they were continuously staring at us which made us very uncomfortable (especially the girls)

Overall my experience was not good. 
If u are near Esplanade and u are feeling hungry then u can show up there. 
But especially going there will definitely not be a good idea.

I love the chats over specially their Raj kachori, its really good...the sweets are pretty good as well....this place is like a smaller format of haldirams with limited options in their menu...and keeping the quality in par with haldirams.... Taste wise little better than haldirams I feel in the chat sections n batura chola....all in all a good place....

Location: At Bentick Street, a few meters ahead from Paradise Cinema; Opposite New Aliah Restaurant.

Kanha, a known brand in the area now has been here for years serving the localities with hot and fresh savory snack-type items along with the indulging sweets for all occasions and daily meals. Famous among the people around the area, it is always bustling with a high number of footfall towards the evening and is also among the better high-tea time options available in and around Esplanade. The place has however not taken care of a makeover with the time passing by and remains running with repairable furniture and display cases. Specializing in a lot of snack-type options which include chats, pakodas, sandwiches and many more; Kanha was opted for rescuing me & a few colleagues from the extreme hunger that had struck while we were around the area for work affairs. From the available widespread fare, the following had been sampled:

- Radha Bhallavi
The Radha Bhallavi was cold since was pre-prepared yet, tasted nice. Served along with piping hot Aloo Dum which was flavorful but, slightly oily. Paired along tasted nice. Since the Aloo Dum was piping hot, the cold Radha Bhallavi didn't disappoint on being paired.

- Club Kachori [5 pieces]
Five non-greasy, cold (due to stock preparation) yet, flavorful Kachoris served along with a hot and delicious mixed curry of succulent cottage cheese, perfectly boiled chickpeas and potato. The only sad part was the oil content in the curry. Overall was decent to eat. The piping hot nature of the curry made up for the cold Kachoris.

- Samosa
Crisp and non-oily wraps with a flavorful filling inside. Delicious.

- Paneer Pakoda
Melt-in-the-mouth type cottage cheese batter-fried and served with sweet tamarind chutney. Was nice to bite on.

- Cutlet
Failed to impress as the filling wasn't quite moist and each bite gave away a dry feeling. Wished for a sip of water along each bite. Has scope of improvement.

- Bread Pakoda
Batter-fried sandwich which had a filling of well-seasoned mashed potatoes. Was just about decent to taste. Served along with sweet tamarind chutney. Could be paired along with coriander chutney as well.

- Jalebi
Hot and crunchy they were with the right balance of sweetness.

One could pair the snacks along with a bhaand (earthen cup) of hot tea or cold thick lassi! Helps flush down the 'deliciousness' deliciously. :P 

The service by the friendly and polite staff was quick. The prices were found to be set at reasonable ends.

Overall was a nice experience.
- One could drop by this place for a quick bite.
- Yet to try the sweets and the remaining snacks on offer, comments due.

Location and Description: At the Bentinck Street near Esplanade opposite of the Aliyah restaurant . Simply a sweet shop but this place has much to offer you rather than the sweets.

Ambience and Staff: ¬†Looks very small from outside as per the sweet shop but It has two floored sitting arrangements. The ground is for the sweets and ¬†nice to see the accommodation upstairs. But place a bit dirty upstairs with no proper ambience, Just few table and chairs to seat with an A.C which runs like nothing. Staffs are here are good downstairs but the staff upstairs are good for nothing. You have to take your food by yourself and while you are eating they look at you thats so pathetic.

Food: Sweets are the main attraction here which are really taste, specially i liked the Kalakand here, its so soft and tasty. They also offer Kachori, and other food stuffs in the likes of Singhara, Lassi etc. The chana bhatura here is very nice and tasty.

QNQ and Prices: Quality is good here with decent quantity. Prices are fine according to the location and the stuffs they offer.

Conclusion: Place is nice but sometime too crowded to stand.¬†

Note: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place,

Overall , a good place to eat fast and head to work.

I went there to treat an office colleague. I tried onion uttapam, sambar vada and gulab jamun. ¬†The onion uttapam was tasting good. However, it was thick and a bit heavy. The sambar vada was perfectly alright. The gulab jamun was piping hot. The upper seating area is nicely decorated and is good.
