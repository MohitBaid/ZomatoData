So this newly opened Chaat place serves authentic Banarasi Chaat at decent prices and amazing taste.
Tried their Palak Patta Chaat , Dahi Puckas and their special Tamatar Chaat and all of this tasted delicious 😊
Go and taste some if you are craving some lip smacking chaats made in a very hygienic manner 👌

Have heard from one of my pals about this outlet and it's popularity among different chats menus (specially golgappe). So prefered to give my taste buds a break from non-veg menus today. And I was not at all disappointed after I received my order Of two plates of Golgappe via Swiggy( that too before scheduled delivery time 😆😆😆). Now coming to the Golgappas, I would like to mention two things about BCB:--
First, they are specialist in the art of preparing mouth-watering crunchy golgappe.Although the size of the golgappe is bit smaller than roadside vendors' but the amazing part is that every golgappa don't consist any pores/holes which give no chances for chat water leakage .
Second, the stuffing/ingredients that BCB provide with golgappes is mindblowing. I have been to various golgappe outlets previously but have never come across such delicious stuffing . On Having a first view(dull view of the stuffing), I didn't imagine that the very next moment (after having the first golgappe ),my perception about it will go a complete change. Both the stuffing and chat water was prepared with right ingredients in right proportions .
It was light on stomach yet very tasty.
So I would like to thank BCB for providing me such pleasant golgappe experience in such pocket friendly price. Will definitely recommend it to my chums and last but not the least, would definitely bookmark it as my favourite golgappe outlet for my taste-buds. ☺😊👍👌👌👌

Every Monday is closing day. Rectification required. Every dishes are yummy. But some dishes require more attentionvto feel like sitting in Varanasi.
