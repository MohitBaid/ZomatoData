Horrible food. Undercooked, cold and without any salad or dressing- chicken reshmi kabab. Waste of money. Never order food from such a place that doesn't maintain hygiene as we may fall ill eating undercooked food and I have my further doubts about the hygiene maintained in kitchen. Extremely disappointed that such eateries exist.

Good quality food at very good prices. Definitely wouldnt wanna miss it. Specially the quick bites and the biryani is pretty amazing too. All in all lovely.
