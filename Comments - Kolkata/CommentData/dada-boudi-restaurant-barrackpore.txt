Dada Boudi Restaurant have almost become the talk of the town and this is the reason I decided to visit this place on a Friday afternoon. It is located within the periphery of the Barrackpore Railway Station and the seating arrangements are stalled in a compact manner. They also have a second stall of seats just behind the main kiosk. Coming to the food,my expectations were sky high and it failed to satiate my taste buds. I chose to order Mutton Biriyani and it somehow was pretty average. I felt the amount of oil was slightly more than normal quantity and should be lessened moderately. Well,my food voyage of Rs 190 per plate was not upto the mark.If they are charging more than a trademark like Arsalan, the standard should also be kept a notch higher.

If you love biriyani...you MUST visit this place. If you don't love biriyani you should DEFINITELY visit this place because after that you are going to fall in love with biriyani!
They are masters of biriyani.. extremely well flavoured and delicious with a nice portion of chicken/mutton and they provide you with good quantity too! 
It's very near barackpore station. The moment you step out of station you will find it in front of you.. always filled with customers!

Located near barrackpore railway station just opposite the sukanta sadan.. This one is newly opened joint but they have maintained well the quality of the old legendary dada boudi hotel.. ( the old one is also there) 

The space is a bit small.. can accommodate at max 20 people and the seating area is divided into 2 storeys..

Now coming to the food ordered..

1) Mutton biriyani :- How can anyone think of any other dish except this legendary "Mutton Biriyani" .. The mutton here is huge in size and soft like a cotton.. The rice was really tasty and the aroma of pure ghee and spices made it even more lipsmacking .. (10/5)üòç have tasted this biriyani over 100 times Till now and it never let's me down..

2) Chicken Kasha :- 4 pieces of chicken in a super spicy gravy.. A perfect accompaniment of the biriyani.. but I felt the oil was a bit more.. (4/5) 

The quantity and quality of both the dishes are really very good..üëçüëç

Keep up the good work..üòÄ

They don't charge any GST.. but the prices of biriyani is inclusive of taxes so a bit more than the take away one (220 INR)

For a vegetarian like me, going out with non vegetarian foodie friends to places popular for biryani is a challenge because these places don't guarantee good vegetarian food.
Dada Boudi restaurant is an exception. This immensely popular biryani paradise for North Kolkata people is a much hyped place among foodies. My friend treated all of us here for his birthday and I very sceptically ordered few vegetarian dishes. To my surprise they were delectable and I am not going to hesitate to visit this place again only for its vegetarian north Indian dishes.
‚Ä¢For the starter,I had achari paneer tikka kebabs - such succulent tender pieces of paneer perfectly done in tandoori style blended well with spices and sauces. Lip smackingly delicious and a must try for veg food lovers.
‚Ä¢Tandoori butter roti - good enough.
‚Ä¢Malai Kofta - Just like any other north Indian specialising restaurant, this too didn't compromise with the flavours needed to make malai kofta a yummy side dish.
‚Ä¢Firni - it was not a charmer as expected because I have had better ones elsewhere. Nevertheless, what's the harm in having something sweet after a wholesome meal. :))

This restaurant is thronged with foodies in queue outside and you have to quickly place your order,savour your food and leave the place to let others enjoy their meal.
Vegetarians,don't let your heart sink. You can freely order what you like here and rest assured,they won't let you down.

Biriyani & chicken chap was much delicious üòã. Biriyani was less oily, chap was tender and soft. And kadai paneer, unless like any other restaurants paneer was so soft and less spicy. Everything was good what we had tested üòã. I forgot to mention earlier firni was damn testy, better than shiraz believe me!

The famous dada boudi resturant with the tagline, "biriyani manei dada boudi" seems a little hyped. The place is good. But space is limited and perhaps you have to share tables with others. The decor or ambience is roughly average. Service is good. Now comes the main part..FOOD, the biriyani tastes good and the amount is plenty enough to fill your stomach. The Chinese is also  pleasing. Overall above average experience.

Excellent!!! really lived up to our expectations!! we,10 people, went to have their biriyani and all really liked it. It was different from that of the Arsalan or Aminia but it was really good!!! The price for mutton biriyani is 220 including GST!!! their original hotel serves mutton biriyani @190. So not much difference. The size of the mutton was really good and big!! was properly cooked and was very soft!!! Rice quantity was good, sufficient for most of the people though I ate 1.5 plate biriyani!!! their special mutton biriyani @350 is excellent!!! 2big muttons and extra rice!!! should fulfill hunger of people like us!!! though our other office colleagues shared this special biriyani but I can manage this alone!!! üòÇüòÇ
The restaurant is really big! total 3 floors, should accommodate 60-70 guests... A big thumbs up!! üëçüëç

My maternal home is just a twenty minutes ride from the place followed by a wait of roughly 35-40 mins.
So,it generally takes me an hour and maybe another half to lay my hands on the Biryani.
It's completely worth the wait!
They're quite generous with their servings,that much I can assure.
The meal might be a bit rich in content but the quality of ingredients used is quite good which you can feel from the first gulp you take in.
Try it for yourselves and don't rely on my reviews because I'm quite the "Home-Boy" of this restaurant and I hope you know what loyals do?
They distort facts!
Just kidding though!

Their Biryani tasted okay, not what we expected.
We ordered 1 Mutton Biryani & 1 Chicken Biryani. The Mutton & Chicken pieces were soft, but it was not perfectly marinated till inside. The potato was large in size and it was hard till inside. Lastly, the rice was pathetic and the flavour was not good.
Have had Biryani from many noteworthy restaurants, and their Biryani tastes far better than this.
For Biryani lovers, it is not worth a visit.

Emotion & reputation matter here.
Talking about the food, Biriyani was bit spicy but one can enjoy eating. Tengri Kebab was really tasty. Pro tip - Don't forget to add bit of lemon juice.
Service is good though very late. You can't complain about this being an Indian xD
Space is bit small but One can enjoy time with friends.

Went this restaurant few days back..
Ambience was good. Only few chairs available in every floor. The most disgusting thing was you may have to share your table with others..
We ordered two plates of Chicken Biriyani and two plates of Kadhai Chicken. Chicken was good. It was very soft but not as palatable as it was seen. The smoky stuff had a dominant taste of coriander (I felt that killed the natural flavour of chicken)..
The biriyani was not up to the level of our expectation. Very rich, spicy and oily. But the quantity was very good. You can easily share your plate with another one. Overall the experience was average..

A name associated with almost every alternate people of Barrackpore.A place from where every other home have witnessed the taste of the biryani.They have opened this restro close to Barrackpore stsn & next to Hayat.I have visited this outlet few times.To start with ambiance....well as its situated in a very crowdy place so the restro is small,sitting arrangement is a bit clumsy though the interior is properly maintained.Coming towards the food i tried,chicken hot & sour soup-okay in taste though lacked chicken.Starters:dry chilli fish & crispy chicken-both were quite good if not the best.Main Course:chilli chicken & garlic chicken-Well honestly main course wasnt tasty,the chilli chicken gravy was sweet in taste & the other one was somewhat okay(sort of bland).Staples:Mixed friedrice,this was again a big hit so i repeat this without trying other items.Quantity is more than enough & quality of the food is maintained.Service:Prompt though the restro remains packed up with customers yet management is good,staff behaviour is also good & they are even attentive.Final verdict:A must visit place if you want to have some good food in Barrackpore & also want it to be economical/pocket friendly!!!!!!

What to tell about Dada boudi?You will never find a Bengali foodie who doesn't know about Dada boudi.Though it is the restaurant of them & is situated just some steps away from the famous Dada boudi hotel.It is always crowded so you may have to share tables with others.But who cares,You will never find this essence of Biriyani anywhere in Kolkata except them.Though I will rate its Biriyani second with Oudh 1590's Biriyani making first.However,A must go for all foodies.

Dada boudi has always met my expectations.. Though people claim that the quality has deteriorated over time.. I would beg to differ.. They serve one of the best biriyanis still now.. Succulent pieces of chicken or mutton.. Huge portion of rice which is proportionately flavoured.. I enjoy every spoon of it.. For me after arsalan.. One should look up to this restaurant for a good, delicious biriyani treat..

This is a 2nd and a better seating arrangement-ish chain of the famous Dada Boudir (Biryani) Hotel


Now the ambience and decoration are not bad but nothing exciting. The worst thing here is the space is very less. Coming to foods the foods here are good! I mean really decent. I've tried the mutton biryani, tandoori chicken and chicken kasha. Another thing is they also serve chinese with Indian cuisine so the menu is not a short one.

They say their biryani are straightly took from original dada boudir hotel but I've tried twice and the taste is somewhat different between them both the time. This is somewhat buggy. Overall good but the space and ambience hurts but the food pulls off the rating for me here.

It's a very small restaurant and situated in a very crowdy place, The ambience is not that great, and they play no music ( they only serve food and that's it). The side dishes are good and well cooked, But The famous Biriyani now a days taste like will-be-retire-soon-batsman. They have the signature, the style but the quality and feel is somehow getting bad now-a-days.
Every time I ordered Biriyani there I feel like they served me a ordinary Biriyani with some goodwill in it. 
P.S The Quantity is great

Brilliant biriyani and kababs. I must appreciate that they maintained the quality of the food even during the pujo occasion. What more to say? Very popular joint and needless to say quick service and courtesies staff also very attentive. It's really hard to get a seat standing in the long queue but their management is really good. I ordered for chichen Rashmi kabab which was so soft and tender. And mutton of the biriyani was A class. I am 100 %satisfied and really thankful to the restaurant management and cooks for making our saptami wonderful serving a wonderful dinner.

Too much hype about this place but I had a very bad experience in here, first of all had to wait for 30mins for crispy chicken though I would say it was worth of waiting, also their biriyani is awesome but then I had to pay the bill of 1300 by cash because they don't accept cards, if u want to go there for food it's ok but don't expect any kind of service. Also the sitting arrangement is a bit clumsy.

Coming to the quality.. it wasn't up to the mark.. the rice was of lesser quantity and dry.. the piece of chicken was  stale !

From last 20 years I am aware of 'Dada boudir biryani' from Barackpore. At last today I could manage to taste the 'legendary biryani'. When I visited the place first time in way back 2007 I could not manage to get in for the lunch. It was jam packed by the customers and it was a small suburb usual joint withot much comfort for the customers to sit and enjoy the food. But unusual was the queue, the eagerness of the awaits. High demand of their biryani made my jaw drop. 

After 10 long years they are now a  restaurant with three different level of seating.

After assuring my seat at a corner of a table I ordered a plate of that biryani.

It came in a large hundi, larger than I expected. But I must say that it lacks the flavour and taste both. Though the materials used are good and quantity is value for money, taste is not up to the mark. Comparison is obvious with its Kolkata counterparts.

Sorry I am not awestruck and will not visit again.

One of the authentic names for biryani. Went there after a long time. Was really satisfied with the food we ordered. Quantity and quality both were good. The biryani may appear a little oily, but I don't think it could be an issue if you are served with such deliciously tasted biryani. We had 2 mutton biryani and 2 chicken chap. But one can have other Chinese dishes also. Price is reasonable but the place is a somewhat clumsy.

Edit: decided to try something other than biryani. Ordered chicken manchurian and mixed Hakka noodles. Horrible food. The manchurian was oily to the point of falling sick and the noodles was below par. Check out the photos attached to this review.

1 star is just for the taste which somehow manages to be acceptable. 

Their service and behavior is just pathetic. They are too smug and proud of their OG Dada Boudir Hotel's reputation that they don't care to be decent. 
I got a takeout yesterday just for sake of nostalgia of the OG hotel and because I've never had tasted biriyani from this outlet. Regretting that now because their quantity and questionable hygiene are turn-offs. 
The kitchen is downstairs at ground floor, right at the entrance is the takeaway counter. Upstairs is the 20 person sitting area, with two 6-person seaters and two 4-person seater. I directly went upstairs and ordered for takeaway, the waiter rudely said that dine-in attracts extra tax, so despite being exhausted, I had to go down and order there. Chicken biriyani costs 160/- at counter and 185/- at upstairs sitting area. 25/- bucks for the AC experience. 
Also ordered a chicken reshmi butter masala, forgot to click a pic of it.

The only saving grace was the taste of the biriyani which they managed to maintain. 

One thing common with both the outlet is that it is better to get a takeaway and eat at the comfort of your home.

The sentiment of Dada Boudi restaurant is attached deeply with the people living in outskirts of Kolkata. 

Talking about the food, we ordered Chicken Multani Kebab, Special Mutton Biryani and Chicken Tikka Masala. The Kebab was spicy yet taste and was served with fried onions and tomatoes alongside green Chutney. In terms of quantity the special Biryani is enough for two people (at least for me). The Biryani was plain and simple with no extra unnecessary spices into it and was going well with the gravy. Chicken Tikka Masala was sweet in taste even though I was expecting that to be little spicy.
The best part of the restaurannt which I liked the most is that they were serving free Green Mango Sherbat as we went their during summer. Cool isn't it ! Overall it was a nice experience to share.
The only disadvantage of this restaurant is their space. Even though managed three floors still there is a huge space crunch visible as the area is small.
Good hospitality overall. Would love to visit again !@

"Disappointment" is the first word came in the my mind when I started writing this review. Specially visited this place to have the taste of very famous Dada Boudi's Biryani, but what I got was a big disappointment for me. ¬†Nothing special to say about that biryani, the only good point is the quantity, that was huge. We have ordered other chicken items too and all of them were not more than average. Hospitality and ambience were also not up to the mark. Overall its a one time visit place for me.

First things first,don't get confused with the Dada Boudi Hotel & this Dada Boudi Restaurant.They are the same.
Dada Boudi Hotel is more like a roadside shack,hence the Restaurant is a preferable destination.
Dada Boudi's Biryani is more like a legendary authentic Kolkata Biryani restaurant the stories of whose grandeur and delicacy resonated quite often from one's parents & grandparents.
Being a Biryani evangelist,it was on my list to explore this place,and it didn't let me down.
The Biryani (Both Mutton & chicken) had everything perfect in them,minus the mediocre rice used.It had the very traditional essence of Kolkata Biryani,which were previously found in the bylanes of Esplanade.
The side dishes are Cheap & fairly good.
I had chicken reshmi butter masala & chicken tikka butter masala.They were well cooked with a good balance of spice and flavour.
If you are a foodie and love Kolkata Biryani,this place won't let you down.
Rs 550 for two is the average cost to dine in here.
Light on your pocket,heavy on your appetite.
Some point of caution though :-
The Restaurant is congested.
Sometimes you have to share your Table.

Great food at great prices. That's the only thing which has kept this place running very successfully all these years and fortunately, that hasn't changed. They keep their menu simplistic, with mughlai and Chinese cuisines. Prices are very reasonable and after almost having tasted every mughlai dish from the menu, I can confirm that every single one of them are great. The only thing that turns me off about this place is that the biriyani here is very greasy.

The food is substandard, quality has gone downhill, too oily biriyni and taste horrible the amount of biriyni and the size of mutton has decreased drastically. service takes too long i had to wait 15 to 20 min to get a place and order of biriyni. The management is pathetic and very rude. I feel it A total waste of my money, time and a potential health hazard as the tables are not cleared properly after each customer leaves the table. There is no hand wash in the restroom and no complimentary finger bowl to wash hand after meals.
Very bad experience at today's lunch
Never going to return ever.

I don't know it's a part of that famous "DadaBoudi Hotel" or not but if it is then I have to say that it's food quality has degraded tremendously. "With great Power comes great responsibility". So to maintain your fame I guess they should do their work properly.
Very small place. Ambiance is not so good. Half of the A.C and fans are not in working condition ( which is a terrible experience in this summer). Staffs are not going to pay any attention to your problem. They are only concerned about "your order" ,"Are you finished with your meal" and then pay the bill and leave the restaurant as fast as you can. 
I guess it's not the experience people will look forward to...

Day by day there quality has been degrading, people coming far from their placea to have best of Birayani here.., but there service and quality pull me off. 
Sorry to say but Name and Goodwill will not works if you are not concerned about the quality of the food as well as the service. 

Last but the least one waiter came to me ask me for a tip of his own. Low cost Hospitality

Though it is not required to write a review for Dada Boudi, it is always great since my Childhood Dada Boudir Biriyani has always been the best for me, now with a Restaurant it has become much more convenient to us to sit under a good ambience and enjoy the food. The only Cons that I face while I visit the Outlet the behaviour of the Staff with the Customers are not good they are very harsh to there customers. Hence not giving a review 5.

This restaurant needs no introduction.Its situated near Barrackpur station.I went there several times .Last time I tried Special Mutton Biriyani, Chicken Kadhai, Chicken Malai Kabab.Firstly,The chicken malai kabab was not good in taste at all. Kabab pieces were not properly cooked.Pieces were so hard.I didn't like that preparation.Special Biriyani was good enough for 2.It was tasty.The Mutton pieces in it were soft & tender.Next, the Kadhai chicken was also very good in taste.The gravy was thick and spicy.What i like the most ......They served this presentation very beautifully‚Äã with adding some fresh cream on it.The prices of the were adequate.Best place food foodiesüëçüëçüëçüëç
My overall reaction is good.will go again soon . Thanks.Love Food ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

If its Kolkata and you are searching for Biryani, this is the right place for you. This is place is well enlightened at barrackpore near barrackpore station.
May it be with friends, family, couples, take away if you are fond of biryani no one can serve you better.
To start treating yourself, one can try the dishes from tandoori, Chicken tandoori, chicken Banjara kebab,fish achari tikka and etc..
Then comes the Biryani and Mutton Biryani is my favourite one.
Awesomely flavored, the rice & the mutton are so tastily prepared,(but that "aloo" is my favourite part of the biriyani) which will certainly bring you here every time.
Its the most hot selling item,u can also try Chicken Biryani and aloo biriyani as well.
For side dish i would suggest chicken chaanp,its a bit too oily but mouthwatering.

And for dessert they are recently serving firnis,which is great in taste as well.

The place is always crowded. Their service is fast. And every time their dishes taste the same good. They also have take away and home delivery, so its a good option for party and get together.

Service-3/5

As a Barrackporian, I have been here many many times. This place is like an emotion to the people of this area. That "emotion" drove me today to order mutton biriyani from them before leaving Barrackpore.

This time I opted for a take-away. So from my past experiences I would say this place is small, well-decorated, but you have to share tables during rush hours ( that is always ).

The food was as usual good. But this time I missed the "kick" to the senses as I used to get before by their mutton biriyani. The taste somehow didn't fully satisfy me this time.

Dada Boudi has achieved a cult status as a biryani joint, not only at Barrackpore but places far beyond it's territory. From a tiny and shabby "bhaater hotel" to a million dollar empire, Dada Boudi has surely come a long way. I've been gorging on their biryani since I had actually started eating biryani. Undoubtedly, it's a delight to the taste-buds, although they do struggle to maintain the consistency of the taste. But that's not what this review is really about. I was out for some work at Chiriamore this morning. It was around 6 AM when this nauseating sight of chunks of meat hosting a swarm of flies, lying in front of the entry of the restaurant, caught my eyes. These are the same meat pieces that would be used in preparing their oh-so-iconic biryani and kebabs. They don't give a rat's ass to minimum hygiene. I'm not sure who, in their right frame of mind, would choose to eat the cooked version of what is visible in the picture. The plastic bags were left unattented out in the open. When I was attempting to click pictures, some of the staffs almost pleaded me not to make this photos public. But I had to. I wish I could give the restaurant 0 stars but that's not a possibility here.Suchetana Saha

They are brilliant with what they are known for. Yes, the 'BIRYANI'. Try that and you will crave for it the rest of the month. A huge thumbs up for the 'dada boudi' fraternity for delivering us with such wonderful 'biryani'. Though, other cuisines are also getting the heat. A MUST VISIT FOR ALL!

Place- Barrackpore (2 mins walking distance from the railway station) and BT road is the road to take if you are coming by car(no parking space is available).

Their iconic biryani is made with cheaper quality of ingredients. That makes it feasible to serve so much at so less a price tag. The concept of sharing tables becomes a bother if you're looking for privacy. The service isn't pleasant either. However, their biriyani tastes good, no matter what.

Motton and Chicken pieces were big and soft enough. Rice quantity was perfect for one person. Ambience was nice.
Staffs are really courteous and helpful.

We ordered Mutton Biryani and Chicken Tangri Masala. The Biryani was scrumptious. I normally don't eat the 'aloo' of the biryani but this sure was an exception. The mutton pieces were big and tasty. Chicken Tangri Masala was another delicacy. The chicken pieces were soft and big. The gravy was tasty too. Overall, a really good meal, it was.

I am a huge fan of Dada Boudi Biriyani (dadaboudi Hotel) since my childhood . On 14th Feb 2017 i went to Dadaboudi Restaurant and order 2 plate Mutton Biriyani but i was surprised to see that Few Hairs were there in the Mutton piece as well as Biriyani Rice after taking a bit of Biriyani i could observe that. I was shocked to see that and immediately ¬†have informed to the service head of 2nd Floor but he came and behave like that it's a part and parcel!! why am i making such a fuss for that!! Dadaboudi Restaurant authority didn't apologise for that, they didn't change the Biriyani and charged fully. after that incident i went to their clerical staff in ground floor to describe my grievance but even they are not bother to listen my grievance!! This is how they treat with customers..so ambience wise pathetic. I would never ever go to Dadaboudi Restaurant in my lifetime.

HATE DADABOUDI RESTAURANT..STRONG ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN AGAINST THEM

PS: They don't even have Card swipe machine in operating condition on 14th Feb!!

Dada boudi means biriyani..and the taste may have degraded a little...still...it's one of my favourite place ..
Pros : 
‚Ä¢ Taste of biriyani is far better than many other renowned biriyani joints.
‚Ä¢ Other dishes are also tasty.
‚Ä¢ Not overpriced.

Cons :
‚Ä¢ Space is small..So,you may have to share table with other peoples.

Dada Boudi Restaurant needs no introduction. It has already taken many hearts of foodies by their famous Biryani. Many people get confuse between Dada Boudi Hotel & Restaurant. Basically Dada Boudi Restaurant is the new one & Dada Boudi Hotel is origin of it. Both located near to the Barrackpur Railway Station.

Decorations : The restaurant is quite big & it's divided into serveral floors. Each & every floor is nicely decorated providing a sweet comfortable ambience & the sittings are well organised as there's not enough space inside. Even the dine tables are well decorated & with the nice touch of their trademark on it.

Staffs & Management : From the very beginning staffs seemed as professional as their service was. From recommending the dish to ask for the time they need to prepare the order & fast service, their polite behaviour, they really treated us as their valuable customer. Management gets a thums up for maintaining all this.

Mutton Biryani : Just after our Biryani handi came, the rich fragrance of it covered the whole room. We were the only person in the dine at that time. I was imagining the situation when everybody having the Biryani in that dine. Afterall it was the famous Dada Boudi Biryani everyone is mad about. High grain rice, beautifully cooked with a huge portion of meat. Each & every rice tasted exceatly same, thats how good it was mixed. It tasted very good with the balance of premium spices. Meat was well cooked, soft, spicy, juicy & lovely in taste. Potato & covered spices felt brilliant in mouth. The portion served was as much as a briyani lover would love to have. I wouldn't call it the best Biryani but it was definitely different having its own speciality. This Biryani is recommended to every Biryani lover out there.

Chicken Makhani : It was garnished & served well in Indian style that looked delicious. Chicken pieces were dipped into creamy gravy. Soft, juicy, nicely marinated chicken pieces tasted yammy & the creamy gravy felt good with Kulcha too.

Cheese Kulcha : Cheese Kulcha was quite big & nicely baked. It was bit oily but not very cheesy. Streachy cheese were on the sides of it. Taste wise it felt kind of average.

Pricing : Quite surprisingly our bill for all those items were Rs. 450 in total inclusive of service chage only. No VAT was there, that definitely made it an affordable option.

Conclusion : I need to say, Dada Boudi Restaurant is way better than its origin Dada Boudi Hotel. For just Rs. 30 difference of the Biryani pricing if you're compromising on Ac, comfortable dining, overall presentation, quantity & the most important taste of the Biryani, then you're such an idiot. If you are searching for the famous Dada Boudi Biryani you've heard in news & read in news paper, then probably this is the most closest experiance you can get.

A very famous name at Barrackpore, mainly serves Indian, Mughlai & Chinese delicacies.

Ambience is nice with good sitting arrangenents.

Staffs are fine .

Tried mutton biriyani, which was nice, aromatic , well cooked with sufficient quantity. Meat pieces were tender .
Also tried Manchow soup and Schezwan noodles. Manchow soup was tangy with good fillings. Schezwan noodles was also nice, tangy and well made.

Pocket pinch is friendly with sufficient quantity.

Location:Walk straight from the Barrackpore railway station,this place would fall on your left.

Ambience:This one has a much more hygienic environment,in stark contrast with their actual main branch,which is more like a shop than a proper restaurant.

Food:The mutton biryani,though not light on the grease aspect, is very tasty with ample quantity,perfectly cooked meat and a soft piece of potato.The phirni too is sublime.

Price:Very reasonable.They don't levy extra taxes on the prices that are printed on the menu.

Verdict:This is the only joint that has put Barrackpore on the food map.You would be underwhelmed if you travel from far to savour the now cult biryani but otherwise,if you're in the vicinity,it shouldn't be given a miss.

Mutton biriyani was good , meat was tender.
Ordered Chinese food too, which was okayish.
Quantity was sufficient , staffs were amicable and cost was reasonable. Overall a decent and economical place for food lovers ...

The reason I visited dada boudi restaurant is their popular and hyped biryani. Biryani is the only dish i can have any time any day without any complaint. Dada boudi restaurant is just opposite to the entrance of Sukanta Sadan, Barrackpur. This relatively new joint has provision for serving 20 people at a time. I ordered mutton biryani, that's it. The quality of the food was as awesome as the legendary dada boudi hotel biryani as both of these joints have same franchise as well as same cook. Quantity was also enough for one person.  So, any biryani fanatic must visit this restaurant and enjoy the famous dada boudi preparation at much better ambience.

We had their Special Mutton Biriyani along with Mutton Pasinda and Green Salad. The biriyani itself was value for money but they could work on their mutton pasinda, it was too oily and spicy. The biriyani was light and fragrant. It was ample for two people to share with. Would visit again for just the biriyani. The staff were cordial and the prices were reasonable too.

Very very bad experience . I went there today but the the food was pathetic . The biryani was just boiled chicken n rice mixed together . No smell no spice only boiled chicken . We also ordered chicken tikka masala but the gravy was butter masala . Then came the worst part . The waiter told we could pay by card but when we went to pay the guy said his card machine was not working which was a lie . To that i said please try again n that guy just hold the machine n again said the same thing without even trying . It was so sad to see this kind of behaviour . Anyway ill never visit this place again in life . Shame

I experienced Dada Boudi‚Äôs biryani in an office party. As an avid Biryani lover, I really enjoyed their mutton biryani. The mutton piece was big and soft. The ‚Äòaloo‚Äô was also soft and tasty. Rice was well cooked and the overall biryani tasted better than many well known biryani joints in Kolkata. Quantity was ok, but given the price, I would have loved a little more rice in the box. A plus point for the little pack of salad which came for free. Lastly I would say, though I liked this Biryani, the name seems to be a little overhyped.

Finally the wait got over. I dreamed of this for so many years but never attempted to do so. Finally got my hands on the famous Dada Boudi Biryani. A very renowned place for making delicious biryani. People travels hours to reach here for their Biryani only. Not a very big place. Ordinary Sitting but the crowd keeps coming for parcel. So did i. Took Parcel of Chicken Biryani. Can't say it is the best but they make some ¬†real tasty biryani. Rice taste was good and contained good amount of spices. The chicken Piece was soft and juicy as well.

My cousin had gone to barrackpore for some work and knowing my fondness for biryani   he got a the famous Dada Boudi biryani for me. I have heard so much about this place over the years that it was in my wish list since. The mutton biryani was simply super in taste and we regretted of not getting some more biryani for our consumption. The mutton piece in each plate was something we don't see in famous restaurants serving biryani in the city  nowadays. The potato is succulent and make you crave for more. Taste of the rice is awesome. The taste still lingers... one plate of this one wasn't enough and we are going back soon. The Rs 210 for one plate is worth.

starting with the pros: ‚Ä¢ the ambiance is good.
‚Ä¢ the plates are clean.
‚Ä¢ the mutton biriyani is quite good.
Cons: ‚Ä¢ anything other then biriyani is mediocre. its like any other restaurant in Barrackpore.
‚Ä¢ the cost of a meal is higher than average.
‚Ä¢ the waiters don't have any idea about recommending food.
Tips: ‚Ä¢ do not order the chicken biriyani unless you like your chicken to be drier than the sahara desert.
‚Ä¢ do not order your food to be delivered as it takes much time.
‚Ä¢ and the chicken and mutton chaps are also recommend. anything other than that at stale and overpriced.

Biriyani is everybit equal to their old hotel. Tatse, quantity etc are all the same.
A three storey building with top 2 floors dedicated for seating. Ambience is cool and comfy, certainly good enough to enjoy your food.
Variety is much more than their old hotel. This one has AC unlike the other branch.
Staffs are responsive and polite.

First of all Dada boudi is very well known in this region.But is the food any good, I would say it's pretty average for the amount being charged and don't get fooled by 550rs for 2 people cause that's very incorrect.The food proportions are less than average and food tastes pretty average too.The restaurant is very cramped and feels suffocating if your are one of those people who like some privacy.
Pro: Legendary lamb biriyani ( well kind off),average food.
Con: Expensive for the proportions and quality of food being served,no home delivery and 550 rs for 2 won't cut it out yes it's a bit pocket heavy....!

The price of mutton & chicken biryani is ‚Çπ175 & ‚Çπ145 respectively! If we compare the price with the location it's bit too high but trust me it's worth it!
Taste= heaven
Size of meat= more than sufficient 

Only bad part is in the main outlet they don't have card accepting facilities and place is too clumsy but.. To correct it they have come up with a new restaurant.
In my nation wide venture I find dada boudi r biryani is no less than rosogolla of Kolkata!!

For last few years the biryani of this particular restaurant has risen to the level of cult favourite and hot topic of discussion among food lovers and biryani connoisseurs, I know off. However, the place being quite far from general south Kolkatans (read my) travel route has kept me at bay from visiting this place.
But luckily, there was an office lunch and we decided to bring in the biryani from this famed restaurant.
I readily accept the fact, one can't judge a restaurant by its takeaway. One needs to feel in the vibe of the eatery, smell in the ambience to get the true taste of the dishes it serve, especially for biryanis. Alas! it was like the proverb in Bengali, "dudher saadh gholey metano" in my case.
I'll try to judge the dish from that point only, cause I think, hardly I'll ever be able to visit this restaurant!

Biryani to me is a divine dish. I feel, every aspect biryani is equal in making it divine , from the softness of the mutton/chicken boti to the shape and color of rice, the smell that can bring back dead people to life.... It is nothing short of a poetry, magic, if properly prepared!!
It arrived in a standard paper cover box, so the aroma was all but gone, the rice had the perfect texture and the color! It was greasy enough to my liking (I hate diet biryani, they are scareligious!). The mutton boti was a nice big one and extremely soft. However, unlike Kolkata's biryani it wasn't lean, had a lot of fat to it, which I didn't like. The alu was a big , soft one. Overall, the quantity was perfect. Everything was neat and pretty as it should be.
However, the magic was missing. That divine feeling, when you open the box and close your eyes and inhale the sweet aroma of the rice was not there. Nor was the feeling of the awesomeness which make you go gaga over the dish to the point that you just close your eyes and keep on chewing the rice and forget about everything in your life , was present!
In short it was a pretty decent biryani, but the divinity wasn't there. According to me, that magical benchmark will always be the arsalan park circus!! Or maybe I'm just smitten by it to the point of no return.

Today there was a small party at our place and we bought food from here. Though they took 100 bucks extra as delivery charge, the delivery boy was not ready to come to the exact location so try to confirm the exact place when the order will be placed. We ordered for mutton biriyani, mutton kasha, chicken reshmi kabab and chicken hariyali kabab. The quality of mutton biriyani was good but in some boxes they gave two big pieces of potatoes which reduced the quantity. Mutton kasha was really tasty so as the kababs. The salad they gave was really good. 
The rate chart for take away is quite different from the menu given by zomato. Sandip Paul

When it comes to best biryanis in and around kolkata, dada boudi's name pops up immediately...went to this much famed restaurant located very close to Barrackpore railway station and tried their crispy chicken and chicken biryani...the crispy was good, a bit spicy though...the menu mentioned 8 pieces of crispy but they served 7...when notified, they rectified their mistake but took too long to serve that 8th piece...service is slow...after finishing the starters we had to wait for a good 15 mins...then came the biryani...the quantity was great...more than enough for a person and it tasted decent but not great as i was expecting it to be...ambience is above average...food prices are a bit high however all prices are inclusive of taxes...

Every time there is a discussion on the best places for Biryani in and around Calcutta, there would be quite a few vouching strongly for either Dada Boudi of Barrackpore or Asma of Baruipore. Situated on the northern and southern fringes of Greater Calcutta respectively, these are places few from the main city have actually visited. So, most accept their inclusion to the top list without much argument.
                                                                ...

This is a new restaurant opened by the pride of Barrackpore Dada Boudi Hotel. This is a new place (incidentally we went there a day after their first birthday) with 2 and a half floors. The restaurant will fall on your left if you are going towards BT Road from the station. Seating is pretty cramped and during power cuts when AC is shut down, it gets extremely suffocating. The top floor seating is better. 

The menu here is extended with Indian and Chinese options. Items are overpriced. They are clearly using the name. Service is clumsy but fast.

Coming to food we ordered a plate each of Chicken Reshmi Kebab and Mutton Biryani. The kebab tasted good, but the meat was tough and chewy. 

The biryani rice amount was huge, but they charged 200 bucks for that. The meat piece was full of fat and somewhere between soft and not. There was no egg, but the potato tasted good. The rice was too oily (we had to leave the last few spoons due to the excess oil) and hot. Overall a dish which I won't even order from my local shop, forget travelling.

This is the new restaurant the legendary Dada Boudi Hotel has come up with, at a minute's walk away from the original outlet. The restaurant is opposite to the railway station. Pretty easy to locate. It's a 3 storied restaurant building, each floor having 4-5 tables which seats atleast 4 each. Since its a busy restaurant, you will have to share your table with other customers. So don't expect privacy here. The staff is not the most well behaved you'll find ever. But who cares, as you only go for the love of Biryani there!

Mutton Biryani currently priced at Rs.200 (inclusive of everything). I would consider the price to be on the higher side, but they are banking on the popularity earned over the years. The aroma of the biryani rice is magical. The mutton pieces are gigantic. The entire plate looks so awesome and tastes even more awesome. They serve huge quantity of rice. The wait time for the biryani is slightly high. I expected a shorter service time, considering they specialize in biryani only, so thought it to be ready to be served. They give you a small aloo in the biryani and a complimentary salad. The egg is missing though, which is a common addition to Kolkata style biryani.

The restaurant comes as a bliss to people who travel to Barrackpore just to have Dada Boudi's biryani. Atleast now they can sit in an airconditioned restaurant and have their favorite biryani, and not have to carry it home or have it in the dingy, crammed up original outlet.

Ambience is really good and the restaurant is quiet big.. the food we order was quickly served without delay.. the starter crispy chicken was really good .. the biryani was also good and delicious.
All together its a good place for hangout.

It is a new restaurant outlet of vintage famous Dada Boudi Biriyani Barrackpore, Located in 10 minutes walking distance from the old hotel. its a multifloor resturant, But not very spacious.  we went there to celebrate a friend's birthday like around 15 people. They arranged us the top floor like reserved. That was very helpful and cutomer friendly behavior from them. top floor's decor is also good. We ordered different dishes. I am an eggiterian. but there menu does nit have any veg biriyani or egg biriyani option so, I had to choose kashmiri polao and paneer butter masala, but I also tasted rice and aloo of mutton biriyani and noodles. polao was pretty good, paneer butter masala was also good. but shoupd have little more curry with it. Hakja noodles also tasted fine.  what was little disappointing was biriyani. Even my friends complained too. comparing its price with arsalaan or aminiya or hanglatherium even nizams biriyani taste better than there's. It is very dry. and feels like lots of dalda in it. lacks flavour. I am very much biriyani lover. but I thought may be this restaurant out let would serve better biriyani than the old one. But really dada boudi's biriyani is totally getting very bad day by day. Again,  I am telling other items tasted pretty fine, but biriyani was a disappointment.  Better to taste Chinese and north Indian items. If you have already tasted biriyani from outlets like arsalaan(any outlet), aminia( chinar park),  hanglatherium (lake gardens),  Nizam(new market). you wont like dada boudi's biriyani at all. It just running because of its old fame,and location.

As everyone knows Barrackpore is famous for Dada-Boudi Biryani.
The owner finally decided to open a new outlet apart from the older one.
If the location is to be said then the new Dada-Boudi Restaurant is just opposite of Sukanta Sadan Hall at Barrackpore station area.
This outlet is a new place with better d√©cor and air conditioned facility.
The restaurant is having three floors which is approximately acquires 20-25 people each floors.Somehow I found the place crappy very small space and even the staircase is lousy doesn't even fit two people on it.I expected a better version of Dada-Boudi decor and interior which is pretty basic in reality,it was a sheer disappointment.
Coming to the food the owners are finally expanded their menus which has Chinese and Indian cuisine.
Currently my favorite is their malai kabab ( recommended ) Even Masala tikka is mouth watering. And of course their house special biryani.
Staffs are attentive and professional, and especially well dressed who are servers.

Price is bit higher than the older Dada-boudi outlet in terms of biryani pricing.But for the hospitality,service and ambiance the price is acceptable and as compared reasonable also.

CONCLUSION - Though I'm disheartened by the place in respect of decor and interior. But the quality of food is same and one must come and try their blissful dishes.

Dada boudi is famous for biriyani since long...but I am bowled by Malai kebab!! Chicken pieces are extremely soft n juicy! Tandoori is also good. But the restaurant is very small and clumsy. N you have to share your table with other people. That is why I am giving 4.5 instead of 5 but if you consider only food then undoubtedly it will get 5 out of 5! :)

Then i ordered for... stuffed chicken tangdi, chiken banzara kebab for starters. Both were good. Even the main course was nice. Ee also tried chinese....mushroom n noodles but that wad just about ok. So this is a place not for chinese cuisine. One thing that needs a mention is the friendly and smiling staff. All were courteous ...not in hurry even though it was past 11pm. Managers and staff all asked about our feedback. It was a great experience.

The hype behind Dada boudi's famous biriyani is a myth. Now only the brand name sells. They use small rice for biriyani. There are two outlets, one opposite to sukanta sadan (restaurant) (Rs. 200 for mutton biriyani, in A.C dinning) and another attached to sukanta sadan (hotel) which is good for takeaway ( Rs.170 for mutton biriyani). The hotel is not ideal if you want to dine in, as its a bit clumpsy and right beside the road.

Everybody Knows that "Dada Boudi"¬† is always famous for their Biriyani's
This is situated just opposite to Sukanta Sadan and has a better ambience than the old outlet.The restaurant is not that spacious but it is clean and fresh.Coming to the food, We ordered : Tandoori Pomfret and Mutton Biriyani.Tandoori Pomfret was perfectly cooked,very delicious and juicy as well.The quantity of the biriyani was too much, very tough for one person to finish.A very big piece of mutton but They use the pieces of mutton of biriyani with lots of bones and fats as well.No vat and service tax.
This is a place to watch out for.

This is one of the latest addition to the series of restaurants in barrackpore, and easily one of the better ones. Food quality is excellent and one should always go for the kebab of the day, which is a specialty. They bring the biriyani from Dada boudir hotel which needs no introduction. Only con is the service which is a bit slow. A good place to go with your family on the weekend

Dada Boudi Restaurant is the extension of the Dada Boudi biriyani shop situated in Barrackpore. It's quite a famous name as it boasts of being one of the top names when it comes to biriyani. Being quite close to my home, and also add to that my irrational love for biriyani, makes me a frequent customer of the restaurant. However, the last time I went was also the first time I visited the new extension.
1stly, when it comes to ambience, the place is well decorated with a pleasant setting. It boasts of two floors and is quite neat and tidy. What appeals more to the eye is the elegance of the restaurant in its simplicity.
Coming to the food, well, the very 1st thing I ordered was mutton biriyani. However, the biriyani was surprisingly dry and a bit too salty. The mutton piece was smaller compared to the pieces this very shop served in the past. It was evident that the quality of Dada Boudi-r biriyani has taken a massive dive in the past few years, with the price soaring at regular intervals of time.
However, the other food items served in the restaurant such as the baby corn and the chicken soup were a revelation, which makes the biriyani quality factor all the more heart breaking.
Service though was reasonably swift and the staff, well organized and quite efficient. So, no complaints in that department.
All in all, for a returning customer of the shop, the experience will be disappointing. However for a newbie it should be a pleasant experience, because Dada Boudi, even with its fallen standards, still boasts of being one of the prime shops for biriyani lovers in the heart of Kolkata. For the more veteran foodies, my suggestion would be to try out the new dishes coz they tend to surprise you pleasantly!!!

I don't know what to say about this ridiculous restaurant. I went there with my guy on the day of panchami.The space is small and was crowded.We ordered Mutton biriani,chicken rezala n mixed raita.food was average.But coming to the staffs -they were looking like they have never seen any couple,talking among themselves. I so wanted to slap one of those idiots but controlled myself anyhow..
food Quantity-2.5/5.      Quality-4/5
The raita was horrible..it was just a mixture of mirch masala,onion n curd
Revisit????-not even if I die out of hunger
Won't recommend to anyone.

After being exposed to the huge praises of Dada Boudi'r biryani from my peers throughout my college life, finally I had an exam at Barrackpore for which a mandatory trip to the famous biryani house was planned. 

Located on the SN Banerjee Road, right opposite the Barrackpore Railway station, this place had a well decorated interior and warm lights. We were taken to the second floor seating area where the three of us ordered CHICKEN BIRYANI and CHICKEN LABABDAR.

On absolute terms, the biryani was very good : reasonably oily, a big piece of chicken, (no egg), and a huge quantity of rice. But going by the sky-high expectations after hearing about them from so many people, the biryani didn't feel out of the world as many people claim.
The chicken lababdar, having six pieces of spicy chicken in gravy, was brilliant. 

A very good aspect of the place is that they served us salad and pudina chutney without charging extra. 

We had our food in about 15 minutes. The staff members were efficient but could've been more polished. Be warned, the quantity of biryani served is huge!

Cost for two : ‚Çπ500.

One funny thing to share that the poor guys ( staffs)  used to sit here n there which troubles customers to climb the stairs.. Ha ha ha... That's why I am not giving full marks to this restaurant.

The iconic biriyani house of north Kolkata's suburbs, Dada Boudi's Biriyani has opened a new restaurant and a take away counter in Barrackpore. Both are near to the railway station and by the side of the station road (S.N. Banerjee Road). Well if you don't like the streetfood ambience of DB and looking for comfy it's a nice place. However this restaurant charges some extra Rs 20 on mutton biriyani compared to original outlet and at Rs 190 it equals to Arsanal's. Oh they have a live kitchen too, saved from roadside dust by a glass. 
Now come to the food. Indian dishes are authentic ones, however I did not like their chinese preparations (may be because of too visit to China Town :p ). Ambience is good but the place is quite small.

Having gone through the review of newly situated 'dada boudi restaurant', i decided to visit to it... Umm..since it was a Christmas night, so we had to wait for some couple of minutes to enter... after that, we faced some ridiculous situation in the eatery... The waiters were basically failing to manage their duties... We had to wait for approximate 30minutes for the food to come, and then we saw that they brought totally different food to those we had ordered.. after a huge confusion, it was found that the food was for another table.. One of those waiters fell and broke 2 plates from his hand which was very irritating...however, the food was good both in case of quality and quantity and Price was reasonable enough... All over, my experience was moderate..
**One suggestion to the authority- please train your team properly so that they can carry out their duties efficiently, especially when it is crowded... People (specifically those 'biriyani lovers') expect a lot from your brand name 'dada boudi'..

It may be the best Biryani joint in that area and to which i somewhat agree and giving my ratings based upon but they seriously had some flaws which gave me a torrid time during my latest visit !!

Well to be honest, firstly I must say food here is better than their counterpart 'D B Hotel ' which is a plus sign..Decor and ambiance wise decent !! 

Now, me and my bro(who is a local over there) visited there just a day after the puja got over..Naturally it was crowded, and there were no seats available..Space is a real worry here as well as the seating arrangements..We were taken to the topmost floor which seemed to be newly built somewhat..
Now, this is really a conjested atmosphere with A.c not working was utterly disgusting..Anyways they provided a Stand fan much to the relief of every1 present over there...

Coming to food, ordered chicken biryani, chicken chap..and i was sumwhat forced to order green salad...like "Salad neben na salad, valo lagbe biryanir sathe" and I thought of giving it a go...They took nearly 20 mins to bring the food..now while eating I observed that they are serving free contemporary salad with every dish..This got me annoying, as i asked the waiter why did u asked me to order salad when its given free?? The Waiter replied that bill wont be changed as it was part of the order and giving lame excuses...which was literally dissapointing, but i didnt gave it up rather i was sorting to end the game.....Now 2 couples were seating infront of us, and on the boy's plate there was a fly found in the biriyani..So we decided to call the manager through a waiter and end this madness..Manager came quick and keeping our cool we told what exactly happened..The climax was that Manager agreed the mistake they committed as Salad was removed from our bill and a free parcel was given to the couple !! Now thats some experience specially when u r hungry...

From a few days this newly opened restaurant was bookmarked. Finally today I went there for having a lunch with my sister. The decor and ambiance was simple yet decent. Only the sitting arrangements are needed to be improved while there are only chairs for either 4 or 6. As we were two we have to share the table with another family. Apart from this the overall get up was nice. We have ordered Veg polao and Handi chicken. The service was a bit slow. We have to wait for atleast 15 minutes after ordering. The food was finally served and it looked great at first glance. The veg polao was perfectly cooked as well as the Chicken was delicious. The bill came up just 290 Rs with no service tax at all. I am very much satisfied with my visit and i would surely visit later. :-)
As I promised to visit again so I have visited again today for dinner with my friends. This time i have ordered Chicken reshmi butter masala which was delicious and fabulous in taste along with vegetable pulao that was not so much tasty as the earlier time I tasted. But overall I have spent a good time there with my friends after a long time and it was a nice experience.

It's a simple biriyani shop, but legendary in the city. The queue in front of the shop is almost always 10-15people long. The biriyani is light and without the excess smell of ghee. The meat - both chicken and mutton - is soft and well cooked. They are continuing with the old tradition of inserting an egg in every plate of biriyani. A foodie's advice, do try their biriyani once in your lifetime.

This is the new outlet of the famous DADABOUDI... i didn't visit the newly built restaurant but went there for a take away... while waiting for my package i was happy about one thing that the hygienic environment is present unlike the previous one...
the biriyani i felt the quality better... the rice was finely cooked and each grains were apart and it wasn't extremely dry the rice had the flavour of the cooked chicken in it... the chicken and potato pieces given were very big and perfectly cooked and juicy and they were full of flavour... just loved it after a long time... :) looking forward to visit the restaurant soon..

Its was my second visit here.. this time we went to the newly made restaurant... it was astami night so we had to wait before entering place... the ambience was very good.. space is small but beautifully decorated... i went with my family and we ordered mutton biriyani, bitter naan, mutton kasha and mutton handi... the biriyani  as alwaz awesome... the mutton was properly cooked and juicy the rice was full with flavours, tje naan was soft and good, the mutton kasha and mutton handi was also very good but they said there would six pieces but there were 3 pieces in both and in mutton handi the mutton was over cooked... dont know if this is in usual case or it was just because of the rush during puja...

I have no clue what the hype is all about this place. I have been there and ordered biriyani as usual to taste the hype. The biriyani was okay type. It was overpriced than most of the places. The only thing that can be justified is the quantity.

Finally all the pains and grievances of the biriani lovers has been put to good ears.This famous biriani place has been turned into a 3floor proper restaurant which we biriani lovers always wanted to be changed of this famous joint.I recently went to this renovated version..which is like 3-4 mins walking distance from barrackpore station & located opposite sukanta sadan.

Coming to the food..we ordered sheekh kabab it was tasty..the masala was well blended,the kababs were well cooked.Then finally we ordered their speciality that is mutton biriani.The taste was typical trademark style of dada boudi if you had tasted it before...the potatos and the mutton was really melting inside our mouth....
I feel like again running to this place to eat as i am writing this review..that magical smell of biriani..we all biriani lovers are crazy for..:D

In all it was a very good experience..i would request all biriani lovers to visit here soon..IF YOU ARE A BIRIANI LOVER you should not miss this biriani famous joint of our city..^_^

I will give it a 4 rating..considering finally it has revamped the place and made it into a proper seating place restaurant..i hope my review craves all the biriani lovers of my city to taste the DADA BOUDI BIRIANI :)

Really impressive !
Staffs are cordial, and,importantly, have idea about dishes. Suggest good dishes.
Ambience is good.
Food variety could be better,just as usual u get in hotels around bkp.
Ordered tandoori roti masala kulcha and chicken kasha and mixed hakka.
Rotis were soft ,liked it. Chicken kasha - no restaurant in bkp can't make it, I want chicken kasha like made in home. But they always end up making Chinese preparation. :(
Hakka noodles was above my expectation, nicely made with lots of prawns , eggs and chunks of chicken.
If they maintain this quality, surely gonna be one of top restaurants in bkp.
Last experience: tandoori bhetki was superb,garnishing was good.

Ambience is not so good as it is a road side eatery in the vicinity of the barrackpore railway station... Was starving badly, the smell of biriyani was like the piper's sound and i was the rat. Taste of rice is almost same as other but the difference is you can enjoy a well cooked and tendered chicken...Enjoy the smell until you get the biriyani on your table... Visit afternoon or else in the evening you have to survive in the crowd outside dada boudi waiting for their biriyani....

A road side joint preferably for take away. Too good biriyani..totally yummmm. The quantity is too much, very tough for one person to finish. A very big piece of chicken / mutton but the mutton always is not very soft. But really commendable. If u r in barrackpore u can't miss it.

For weeks I'd been only eating 'ghar ka khana '. So for a change went to this new restaurant in our area which has opened for a few months. It was my first visit and had no high expectations from the place. But to my surprise they served good food. FYI the murgh biriyani was priced at 160 rupees, a bit pricier than what is served at 'dada boudoir hotel'. We ordered Crispy Chicken for starters, tandoori roti and chicken do piyaza for the main course. Small place and doesn't serve more than 20+people at a time. Food was served after 20+minutes and the place was filled with foodies after we had entered. Crispy chicken was crispy and loved the spices. It had a bit of everything in it for the taste buds. Roti and do piyaza was above average. Cost us 400 rupees. The staff were helpful. Will I go there again? Considering the food served at other restaurants in the locality, definitely YES. One star deducted for the delay in serving the food and small fans.

Biriyani was no doubt awesome as always. Waiters were polite . Had a little hassle with the bill as they mistakenly or purposely (god knows) charged me 380 for two biriyanis as it costs 320 for 2, i confronted. Finally he sorted it out by increasing the price of the cool drinks we had.All in all, Food is good, staff not much professional yet.

Finally, the much awaited Dada Boudir restaurant. Its a small place but as they say good things often come in small packages. The place serves the same delicious biriyani that made Dada Boudir hotel a legend with some newly added tandoori goodies. The decor is minimalist and the French window at the first floor makes it a definite winner decor wise.

We made a quick stop one rainy evening and thoroughly enjoyed the tangy spicy crispy chicken and the biriyani was soft, fluffy and aromatic. They also served raita with the biriyani and it was refreshing. The food was served quite quickly and the host was courteous enough to rush our orders when we requested. This place has one of the most hospitable and courteous staff I've ever experienced.

This is a place to watch out for.

This was much awaited restaurant from the Dada boudi franchise. The restaurant is not that spacious but it is clean and has a better ambiance.
So now for take away people can go to the main shop, while for dining they can go to the restaurant.
This will also reduce the humongous gathering of people in the main road.
Finally the biriyani quality remains one of the best in Bengal. The side dish is something that has to be tasted. I have just tried the chicken rezala and it is amazingly good. So hope to catch up with rest of d dishes soon enough.
Updated - The malai chicken kebab is too damn good. Everybody needs to taste it.

The newest addition to the food map of Barrackpore, this comes from the famous Dada Boudi Franchisee. This is situated just opposite to Sukanta Sadan and promises to provide a better ambience than the old outlet. I have heard a lot about their kebabs, so off I go and ordered two kebabs. I brought them home , so cannot really comment on the ambience.¬†I ordered fish tikka and mutton boti kebab. I have very sharp nose and if any fish kebab emits the typical fishy smell, I simply dump them in the dustbin. But luckily this fish tikka didn't have that smell, was very soft, tasty and perfectly cooked. I simply want to go back there for this kebab itself. Coming to he mutton boti kebab, it was also awesome. Perfectly boiled, soft and the taste penetrated the mutton well.I am not sure about the other items but these two items are highly recommended.The waiting time is quite long, but I guess, that is because the kebabs are getting freshly prepared.

The name was very popular in kolkata as the best biriyani here, so thought of giving a visit to it. The place is very small means you need to give line in order to get seat when i went there i was after 40-50 people , but the wait is justice when i took a spoon of biriyani , its really delicious and not that rich but at the same time i personnally felt that the biriyani is a little bit moist not that much noticable. Overall if you are a biriyani enthusiast give it a try.

Went there thinking of good food quality like their biriyani of which they r famous for, but expections hurt,and they made me realise, i went there with my girlfriend and ordered biriyani,mutton rezala,polao, and mutton hundi, first of all they dont know any etiquettes of serving foods,they first serve me biriyani,n after 20 min my girl got her dishes,biriyani was so so,bcoz their biriyani quality is downgrading day by day, rezala was a total mess,only the mutton hundi was good,polao was oridinary,i didnt get any special treatment in their hospitality, so its an ordinary restaurant jst lyk any others in bkp

This is the first choice if you are in barrackpore ...then comes kurry club ,hayat,aminia,west wind,sona, Dhaka biriyani house,v cafe,penguin,haji saheb....

Now I am starting my review again after today's experience..... Dada Boudi resturant...just opposite barrackpore sukanta sadhan...and one minute walking distance from the barrackpore station...now the restaurant looks quite fresh from out side comparing the other restaurants in this locality...comming inside the restaurant ...yeah it feels premium.... The sitting arrangements are for four and six...but unlike other resturants they did not allowed to sit third persons in your table...that's a great achievement for a barrackpore restaurant.....three floors are there....the road side view from the glass windows are really good....now comming to food....we ordered mutton biriyani,mutton champ,green salad.....the waiters are well behaved... There were delay of ten minutes.... The biriyani tastes as usual Dada Boudi type...but the mutton chanp is good....but the thing is don't compare this with the big kolkata mughlai joint's.... They use the pieces of mutton of biriyani, with lots of bones.. BT taste is good...no vat service tax....but the bill is so chepe ..all things are good but a premium resturant should have printed bills....it does not feels good....
Decor-4.5
Food-3.8
Behavior-3.7
Others-3
Adding some thing more I went there on saptami in this puja 2015 and they are out of biriyani.... How a biriyani based restaurant can say it? It's so much disappointing in my perspective..... And also the third floor seating is worst..... So going to re rate it from 4 to 3

Again giving it 4 after today's visit 15/2/2016 the red pepper chicken was good and yes the biriyani had become more better.... Thanks...

At present this is the best restaurant in barrackpore as par the price point goes ,as per the food and service they are providing....if you are in barrackpore don't waste your money in other restaurants.... Just give a try to this restaurant....
Tasted their chicken 65....I think their starters are well cooked... All starters may it be Indian or chinese

Now I wanted to taste Chinese..... And I ordered veg fried rice ,chicken Manchurian... Yeah the best Chinese in locality (sodpur-naihati)....probably the best restaurant here....

Located just across barrackpore railway station. This place serves Tasty biryani no doubt but place is very unclean and looks very unhygienic. Anyhow for a biryani freak like me....i never mind sitting at this place for plate of steaming hot sumptuous biryani.
