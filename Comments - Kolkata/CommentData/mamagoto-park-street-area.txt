Mamagoto was my daughter's choice. The ambience was really good. A long menu impressed us. We ordered cheese dumplings with truffle oil. It was soft, tasty and with an unique flavour. Then came fish wrapped in leaves. But it was of poor taste, bland actually. Main dish was a bowl of ramen for my daughter and street style pad thai for us. In ramen there was only chicken and noodles. Absence of vegetables, miso, tofu, egg makes it plain noodle soup with very ordinary taste. The big disappointment was the pad thai. Overcooked, bland, no flavours. It was anything but thai. Fusion food tastes good. But it tasted horrible. I am absolutely not recommend this high priced restaurant to anyone.

Good food, nice and cozy ambiance and very cordial staff. Waiting time is surprisingly less, service is quick and professional. Mamagoto has been one of my most awaited restaurants to visit in town and I am quite happy with my first experience of Asian cuisine here. Sumptuous quantity and great quality of fish and chicken in the non veg menu.

We ordered chicken satay and honey fish for starters, both were finger licking good. For the main course we chose to order known common chinese dishes like egg fried rice, hakka chowmin, schezuan chicken and crispy fish fillet. The fish was superb tasty and nicely cooked. The chowmin was  not good to taste. It seemed slimy and sticky for a hakka chow.

Quite a pocket friendly restaurant with really good food located at the heart of Park Street, right beside the Magma building. The decor reminded me of a remote Chinese village from the Kung Fu panda movie üòÄ with wooden floors and rounded stairs. A bit cramped though for large group treats, and most days its fully occupied. I would recommend this restaurant for an unique Asian cuisine experience in a one of its kind ambiance

Mamagoto remained in my bucket list since long when finally last month I got to tick it off.

This place is super convenient to visit owing to it great location just in the middle of Part Street. The ambience inside is cozy and offers you the warmth of an Asian home with an open kitchen. Would recommend a seat beside the glass window overlooking the street.

Coming to the food: 

We ordered a platter of dumpling which comprised of two of each kind. And I was completely bowled over by the each one of their uniqueness and flavor. But best of the lot was Prawn celery dumpling and chicken pokchoi. The nicest part is its completely oil free and super healthy.

We had ordered a pitcher of sangria from their special menu which had a variety of red and white wine cocktails with fresh fruit. The pomegranate one which we had was just what we wanted with the dumplings.

For the main course we had a pan fried noodles. Needless to say it was one of the best noodles I had in a very long time. And the wok was called prawn three pepper bomb. I have to admit the prawns here is awesome.

For dessert we had coconut and palm sugar ice cream. And I strongly recommend everybody to give it a try. This is the best coconut ice cream I have ever had, just wanted it to never get over, but it‚Äôs quite filling and greatly natural.

Did not have a chance to try their rice bowls but I am definitely coming back for more. Pocket pinch: around 3k.

Went on a weekend for lunch. Easily located from the road. Loved the entrance. Decorations and ambience is classy ! Had non veg dumpling platter. Unfortunately lamb dumpling was not available, so we switched to prawn. Loved every single dumplings. On main course had Prawn Know Suey. Amazing flavours. Enjoyed it. Also had chilli pork. Cooked perfect. Price are a bit higher, but overall food experience is great.

One of the finest Asian Cuisine Restaurant  in Kolkata.
A really strong choice point among all others classics in Park Street Area.
"Mamagoto" your are just so cool starting from the beautiful Japanese Sumo style design at door to the entire decor. Such a nice atmosphere and lighting at the entire set.

Food Part:-
Chicken Basil Cups was an awesome one,including plat presentation.
Spicy Bangkok Bowl recommended as a main course 
Teriyaki Meal in a Bowl you will get the flavour of lovely Japanese Sticky Rice
Stir Fried Udon Noodles was a stunner at the Noodles section  

Food Presentation gives this place another level of the Smarter test sense . 

Soft drinks are really to good again presentation took a major part of attraction.

Note-
We have celebrate one birthday party here during the cake cutting ceremony they have change their music track to "Happy Birthday track". 
Just loved their Hospitality.

Excellent...way to go Team..

I will start by recommending it to you. Very cool place. The decor is very welcoming and fun. The spread is excellent and the staff are very friendly. We ordered pomegranate sangria, sushi platter, cheesy tacos, Thai green curry. I enjoyed each one of them the sushi platter is definitely going for reorder when I visit sometime very soon. The accompanying sauces like the kimchi or the mango chutney were too good. I liked them the best actually.

Visited on the X-Mas day of 2017. Expected waiting time for around 45mins. Got a decent table for a Pax of 5. Music impressed me as they were playing Edited version of all Popular tracks.

We had placed Shrimp with Dry Red Chilli, Old School Gyoza Dumplings and Chef Special Shezwan Chicken. From the beverage menu we ordered 4 Pints of Beer, couple of Vodka based Cocktail and couple of Mocktails. Overall Taste and Quantity of the food items can be improved. Service was good considering on a busy day. Not so wallet friendly as it costed us INR 4500.

I was excited when the famous oriental cuisine chain opened their door in Kolkata. We visited the place for dinner. I was disappointed. The ambiance was just ok and tables were very cramped for a high end restaurant. Their service was very prompt and despite of being very crowded they served the food very quickly. But the taste of the food were just average. The normal chicken dumpling coating was so thick that it reminded me of normal road side stall momo. Coming to price it is exorbitant. I can not believe 6 piece of bacon wrapped prawn costs 749 plus taxes with that average taste. I will not recommend this to anyone. Places like Asia Kitchen is a hands down winner any day.

A decent place serving asian, thai¬†and chinese¬†cuisine; visited on 26th of December, their Unlimited Dimsum Platter Festival was going. Ordered for one non veg unlimited dimsum platter at 750rs. One of the best and different kind of buffet experience I had recently. The fried wanton, tom yum soup, prawn and celery dimsum¬†is to die for. I loved their Mama's Homemade cake; one should never miss this dessert.

Team Mamagoto is best and looking forward to visit again.

Decent food and prompt service was completely let down by the behaviour of the staff who seemed to be in constant hurry to vacate us.
1. Urge to clear the table twice.
2. Presented us the bill after main course even though we never asked for the bill. Nor did they ask us if we were done, before getting the bill.
3. While we were eating the dessert, we were once again asked ‚Äúanything else ma‚Äôam‚Äù at which point i asked them why it seemed like they were in a hurry to evacuate us. Couldn‚Äôt they see that we were still eating. To which he replied that there were people waiting downstairs. I pointed at the 2 sets of empty tables in front, his reply was they are reserved! Well, your problem! That doesn‚Äôt give you a license to pester people who are already sitting in your restaurant. We continued sitting after that just because they had offended us. Could see many eyes seeing our table and the apparent frustration they were experiencing as we did not relent to their cheap tactics. We made our displeasure known to the staff as well as the manager. Manager apologised but it did not help the case. The damage was done.

‚ÄúMamagoto‚Äù‚Ä¶ The name sounds different enough..!! You may be wondering but it‚Äôs a Japanese name which means ‚Äúto play with food‚Äù‚Ä¶ Yeah, that‚Äôs a proper Pan Asian restaurant with nice atmosphere and ambience located just near to Allen‚Äôs Park of Park street. It‚Äôs a two storeyed restaurant where the ground floor is being used for waiting for their guests and the first floor for casual dining.

One of the restaurant in my bucket list and it fulfilled my expectation to its level‚Ä¶.!! The d√©cor which I loved the most as the open kitchen and the bar added up the level‚Ä¶ The d√©cor is colorful, quirky and trendy. Thumbs up..

Now coming up to food part‚Ä¶ Went during the special Dimsum festival having some special lunch menu which will be available till January 2018‚Ä¶!!

One of the best experience and loved their hospitality‚Ä¶

They had given the name of this festival as ‚Äî

‚ÄúDIM SUM ‚Äì IN LUMP SOME‚Äù ‚Äì Lunch Special With Pipin‚Äô Hot Soup & Unlimited Dim sums‚Ä¶.

Loved each and every dish but my personal favourite was Chinese Sour and Pepper Soup, Prawn Toast, Fried Chicken Wantons, Prawn and Celery Dumpling and Pok Choi Chicken Dumpling. Even loved their special dessert Home-made ‚Äù American style‚Äù Chunky Caramel Sponge Cake with toffee sauce served warm with vanilla ice cream and mocktails specially Cucumber Mocktail and Cranberry Mocktail.

Located in the heart of Park Street, Mamagoto offers food items that are new to the Kolkata diaspora -be it the Prawny (which are prawn tempuras served on a taco), the Traditional Crispy Lamb or the Stir Fried Udon Noodles (we tried the Chicken variety). Since we visited the place on Christmas eve, the crowd was sizeable but the well-calculated placement of the tables ensured that everyone found a nice place to eat and catch up. The service was excellent and each of the tables was well attended to. Having tasted South Asian cuisine in their respective native nations, I can guarantee that Mamagoto has been successful in delivering on their promise of food taste and quality. A special mention for the recommended white wine sangria with green apples- it was very well made and complimented the food excellently.

Meaning, "to play with food" mamagoto justifies the name quite literally. The brand promises experimentation and excitement. The fusion and admixtures of different style within the pan asian cuisines is quite fun. The interiors are street style, colorful and quirky. A small compact space used up to its full potential. An open kitchen that oozes all the flavours and enhances ambience. The vibrant posters fill up the walls and the whole interiors are filled with such.
We went there for Christmas special lunch and had

* SOUPS:-

1)The sweet corn soup.

2)Chinese Sour and Pepper Soup.

6) Rainbow Chicken Dumpling.

7) Prawn and Celery Dumpling.

8) Minced Lamb Roll.

9) Pok Choi Chicken Dumpling.

10) Prawn Toast.

Prawn toast is pure bliss. We also had some mocktails. The cucumber mocktail is the best. One of the few restaurants in town with such innovative tasty dishes at affordable prices. Commendable service of the prompt staff members. Best staff support and amazingly fast service. You can literally see people in the kitchen working their ass off to make your dish with utmost care and precision within a limited short time. Hats off to the chefs. I am coming back soon.

'Mamagoto',the famous Pan-Asian cuisine brand opened its branch in Park Street a year ago and has won the hearts of the resident of this city who loves to eat and 'play' with their food.

The ambience is also a great one with Christmas decorations still there. The kitchen was an open one. The concept is relatively new but has been well-accepted.

We went here on the occasion of their 'Dim Sum in Lump Some' festival¬† which is actually a lunch special buffet spread with piping hot soups and unlimited dim sums. The vegetarian spread costs Rs-649 and the non-vegetarian costs Rs-749 (excluding drinks). This event will go on till January end.

The menu consisted of :-
* SOUPS:-
1)The sweet corn soup.
2)Chinese Sour and Pepper Soup.
3)Tom Yum Soup.

*DIM SUMS:-

1) Traditional Peking Dumpling Veg.
2) Street Style Spicy Dumpling Veg.
3) Tibetan Style Dumpling VEg.

6) Rainbow Chicken Dumpling.
7) Prawn and Celery Dumpling.
8) Minced Lamb Roll.
9) Pok Choi Chicken Dumpling.
10) Prawn Toast.

Each and every item mentioned above were delectable and heavenly indeed. In addition to it we took 'Fried Chicken Wantons" which was a delicacy. We also tooke numerous cocktails of which the Cucumber one stole my heart. The 'Mamagoto Special Cak' at the end was the star of the show.

The staff was extremely well-behaved and amiable in nature. We will definitely visit again.

The ambience was nice.. the graphic paintings and posters.. the hanging tables, the view outside (well of course it's Park Street), gives an authentic asian indian fusion to the place.

The food wasn't that out of the box though if you like the asian cuisine, the place won't be a disappointment.  We tried the Satay Chicken Skewers in peanut sauce; would surely recommend it to people who like something non spicy.

The service was okay, could be better, could be more descriptive rather than being suggestive in a vague fashion without any background.

The interiors are funky and innovative coupled with a touch of the old times in the flooring and upholstery. The concept of the upside-down tables is cool too..!
The staff is courteous, although there was slight trouble in following our instructions and we ended up with vegetarian soup instead of chicken. However, we were offered fresh soup of our choice as soon as we brought this to their notice.
They have tried to hold on to the authenticity of Chinese and Japanese cuisines. Only, this might feel a bit bland to Calcuttans accustomed to the more prevalant Indian version of Chinese.

Each and every item mentioned above were delectable and heavenly indeed. In addition to it we took 'Fried Chicken Wantons" which was a delicacy. We also tooke numerous cocktails of which the Cucumber one stole my heart. The 'Mamagoto Special Cak' at the end was the star of the show.

The staff was extremely well-behaved and amiable in nature. We will definitely visit again.

The ambience was nice.. the graphic paintings and posters.. the hanging tables, the view outside (well of course it's Park Street), gives an authentic asian indian fusion to the place.

The food wasn't that out of the box though if you like the asian cuisine, the place won't be a disappointment.  We tried the Satay Chicken Skewers in peanut sauce; would surely recommend it to people who like something non spicy.

The service was okay, could be better, could be more descriptive rather than being suggestive in a vague fashion without any background.

The interiors are funky and innovative coupled with a touch of the old times in the flooring and upholstery. The concept of the upside-down tables is cool too..!
The staff is courteous, although there was slight trouble in following our instructions and we ended up with vegetarian soup instead of chicken. However, we were offered fresh soup of our choice as soon as we brought this to their notice.
They have tried to hold on to the authenticity of Chinese and Japanese cuisines. Only, this might feel a bit bland to Calcuttans accustomed to the more prevalant Indian version of Chinese.

A lovely Asian fine dining experience. I was very impressed with their service. What I had-
Seaseme Prawn Balls - high on flavor.  Street style chicken dumplings - juicy and melts inside the mouth.  Bacon wrapped prawns - this one is a winner. Mock tails were tasty too.

Merry Christmas!!
Now, this place had been on my 'need to visit' list for long. And what better day than Christmas to drop in and feast ourselves. Luckily, we managed to get a table for 4 soon enough. Once you step in, the whole ambiance is simply class apart. Right from the lights to the decor to the seating arrangement, every detailing has been done to perfection. One cannot give the cute posters laid out on the walls a miss. Well, for food, didn't go for much(as we had already stuffed ourselves with some food from Olypub). For drinks we chose Irish Bailey(so so good) and Pomegranate martini(nothing extraordinary). For food we went for Fiery Thai Shrimp Fried Rice with Asian Green chili Chicken ribbon. One portion was good enough for two people. The dish was so perfectly made and the amalgamation of flavors worked out very well. Wanted to try banofee pie but was too full so let it go. Well, shall visit again for a proper full course meal and the much famous 'dumpling platter'.

This is my visit in Kolkata in quite some time and I'm starting to wonder that how many of these famous chains of restaurants have started their shops in Kolkata and to my delight, Mamagoto is also there.
Famous for its authentic Pan Asian and Chinese dishes, this is my first visit to this branch. Tried Thai Crispy vegetables which was crispy but thought that it was missing some flavour. Veg Hakka Noodles was good. Next came Hawkers Pad Thai noodles and Chicken with Garlic and Star Anise- both of which were decent in taste.
We didn't try much this time as we were full, so cannot comment much.
Ambiance was awesome and staff was friendly.

A really nice restaurant in the Park Street zone, with nice quirky decorations and good music, adding upto an awesome ambience. The menu is well spread across several continental dishes. The items I ordered were awesomely cooked and well served, making those highly lip smacking. The price of food is quite on the normal side, making it pocket friendly. It also serves alcohol at a very cheap rate. Overall, as a conclusion a really good hangout place with delicious & well cooked foods at pocket friendly rates.

It‚Äôs Christmas night and Park Street is full of people. You are hungry but you see all of the restaurant have their tables booked, so you have to wait in a long queue. Its chaos in road and you are hungry. So the first thing you do is get your seats booked at least two restaurant and go and have your dinner which gives you a faster seat.

So we did so and we got the earliest seats in Mamagota. Now coming to the food quality it‚Äôs good and tasty. Drinks are also good and the ambiance, music all are perfect and picks up the mood . But I must say I was really disappointed with the service as after starters there are no system of changing plates. Then also if you ask of a second drink it takes quite a long time to serve them around 15 minutes you have to wait for the 2nd drink. So a big set back at the service point of view. I would like to suggest that plz upgrade your service and do not provide main course meals in the same starters dish as they are really small and everything mixes.

They have amazing interiors. The place is quite dim and looks ancient. But the reason for giving such less rates is because the food served is not really great. A restaurant can do many things but should not compromise on food.

Thanks to my bestie we landed up here. This Asian Deli has beautiful interiors and the seating is on the first floor. Its perfect for a lazy lunch or dinner dates. We went yesterday for lunch around 3 30pm and got seats easily. We had watermelon, pomegranate and ginger cocktails accompanied with Fish Fillet. The cocktails were extremely good and so was the fish fillet. It was recommended by one of the staffs who was serving us. Do give it a try.
Alongwith perfect ambience and food they have an amazing hospitality service.

I went to the much talked about Oriental eatery and the first thing that caught my eye was the exorbitant pricing of the menu and honestly, it wasn't entirely worth it. The staff was kind and swift with their serving. Overall, a good experience.¬† Here's what I ordered -
1) Thai chicken salad - Good proportions (obviously, since it costs 400 bucks) but the taste was okay. Nothing mouth-watering as such, and I would probably not order this again (simply so that I can visit other options).
2) Imported pork spare ribs - being a lover of all things meat, this dish was cooked to perfection. The pork was succulent and the accompaniments to the dish just increased its flavour ten-fold. LOVED IT!!
3) Egg fried rice - Lot like most fried rice, it was good
4) Pad thai noodles - different, on the sweeter and sour edge, really good stuff, loved it.
5) Mama's homemade chocolate cake - OH MY GOD THIS WAS YUM (but a bit too sweet) but yum nonetheless!

I love the ambiance of this place. The fresh smell of lemongrass hits you every time you enter Mamagoto. The food is delicious. The starters more so. I'd recommend their Burnt garlic and pepper prawns. It is the absolute best. Their desserts too are really good. I'd suggest the Caramel cake or the homemade chocolate cake. Mamagoto is a little pricey. But it's the perfect place for occasional indulgence in Asian flavors. The service is impeccable. All in all, Mamagoto is an experience that a foodie simply cannot miss out on.

Went to the Mamagoto tonight at 7.45. The lady at the gate said 30 min waiting. Some other guests also came , same message. We left the place and she came running to call us back. The other family was seated by the lady. Another man at the entrance told us it will take a few minutes but when the lady returned after seating the other family, she again said 30 min waiting. She was giving the same waiting period for all other customers coming in. God knows what the restuarant was trying to proof. The restuarant was totally empty. Lucky for us we left the place and went directly to The Fatty Bao. It was amazing place with such a great service, and amazing food. Met a couple of friends and they said Fatty Bao is far better than mamagoto. Thanks to the policy of mamagoto that we had an enjoyable evening. Just hope mamagoto management takes note of their policy and I wish them luck. So many new joints coming up.

Meaning, "to play with food" mamagoto justifies the name quite literally. The brand promises experimentation and excitement. The fusion and admixtures of different style within the pan asian cuisines is quite fun. The interiors are street style, colorful and quirky. The huggable life size bear thing at the entrance keeps the expectations high. The menu had a lot to offer the veg junkies which is something that keeps the enthusiasm consistent. We ordered

Cheesy tacos: tacos with goat cheese fritters and some fresh cut with a mango dip and a spicy chilly dip. The fruity kick to cheesy tacos is a must try. 

Hua hin highway rolls: crispy rolls stuffed with veggies and cheese and serve with honey chilli dip, makes a perfect snack. 

Crispy lotus stem: tossed with chilli and garlic and lotus stems that are crispy like thin wafer. The dips are plain amazing.

Street style spicy dumplings: veg dumplings with chilli vinegar dip was another remarkable dish. 

Mamas spicy ramen bowl: craving for a ramen bowl finally comes to an end. The soup is spicy and flavorful and the ramen soft. Served with fried tofu, one bowl is enough to fill our stomach to the brim.

Stir fry udon noodles: I really liked the taste of this one. The spices are just apt and the flavor just goodish.

Thai green curry with plain sticky rice: I fall for this one completely. The creamy sour thai green curry was simply amazing.

Orange and passion fruit sangria: what else do you need to wash down such amazing food. A glass of red wine sangria. Bliss!

I was moved by the service and hospitality. The service was quick and steady. I really loved the experience to the core. Highly recommended.

The entrance to the eatery takes you to a different place altogether. Very nice ambience and atmosphere which definitely sets the mood in. Coming to the service, you are attended to as soon you enter. Prompt and quick service. The food is basic and reminds you of ethnic South East Asian cuisine. Overall a good experience and a must visit restaurant if you are in Kolkata.

Asian street food inspired menu was very different from the run of the mill "Chinese" food available in the city. We tried Chinese sour and pepper soup. Non veg dumplings platter and Chiang Mai train station noodles.

Moreover the staffs behavior is also great as they welcome you warmly. The signature dishes like Maki's platter, Satay chicken, fiery thai shrimp fried rice etc. are absolutely heavenly and mouth watering. 
The overall experience is really good and my recommendation one should absolutely try wasabi sauce once you are there.

Been a regular visitor to the Bandra outlet in Mumbai, coz of the lovely vibe and of course the innovative menu, so when in Kolkata and with a mind to have Thai cuisine, I felt the park street outlet (the only Mama in Kol) wud be a safe bet. And I daresay, it turned out to be even better than amchi mumbai!! The detailing of the dishes and burst of flavors were fantastic, and maybe it has to do with better ingredients available in Kolkata. Try their Vietnamese rice paper spring rolls for sure, and the banana leaf wrapped fish in Indonesian sambal sauce, grilled on a bar b que, accompanied with a handful of sticky rice. And go for bhetki in this, no other fish pls. The staff is not just polite but super friendly and Milan who heads the Kolkata outlet really knows his job, being in the industry for more than a decade now. This might be more than a year old now, but is certainly the go-to place for South East Asian cuisine in the city.

This place is beside the entrance of Magma House. Me and my friend went there to celebrate my birthday. We went for dinner and I booked a table beforehand. It was around 7 and the place was empty. The waiters took me to the 1st floor and made me sit beside the glass windows where I could see the view outside. The place is beautifully decorated with paintings. The lights and the chairs were  comfortable enough. The waiters were assisting us thoroughly. We ordered a Bbq pork rice bowl and a shrimp street style dumpling. They gave a complimentary dish along with them. If you are a pork lover like me you will love this dish. Its enough for 2. And the pork belly was soft and juicy. And the rice and poached egg on it was amazing. The dumplings were good too. They were very soft and melts inside the mouth. But comparatively bbq pork rice bowl was better. üòç As it was my birthday and my friend bought a cake for me they played a birthday song for me. It was a nice evening. And we enjoyed alot. By the time we were leaving the place was packed with people. This is a MUST visit place if you are an Asian food lover.

Mamagoto is a Japanese phase, which means a dining system that encourage kids to 'play' with their food to sense its texture and shape. When cuisine like Chinese, Italian, Continental is ruling out the Kolkatan Street, other authentic cuisine like Japanese is not so far behind. Welcome to Mamagoto, one of the best authentic Japanese cuisine food in town.

The Restaurant located at Park Street area, near to Park Street Barbeque Nation. So not a hard thing to find it out.

Now come to the decoration and ambiance. Upon entering, a big beer is there to welcome you. The restaurant have all their sitting arrangement on their 2nd floor. So take the stair and go the 2nd floor. The place is huge in terms of spacing, beautifully utilized. The wall poster and the lighting work will surely catch your eyes.

We, the gang of 8 friends visit this restaurant of a beautiful winter afternoon. So come to the food we had there -

Drinks : 

‚óè Cranberry Kaffirlime Punch ‚Äì Mild sweetness of Cranberry with attractive red colour. Love it. Full refreshing.

‚óè Kiwi Mint Colin ‚Äì Frankly I‚Äôm not a fan of Kiwi, but the drink made me fan of it. With smooth crunchy feel of Kiwi, the drinks was too good.

‚óè Watermelon Beach ‚Äì Who doesn‚Äôt love watermelon? Taking the flavor of Watermelon with Basil leaf punch, the drink was really a cool one.

‚óè Lemon Zest & Mint Lemonade ‚Äì Lemonade made of Lemon Zest and mint. Little bit was rough in taste but taste wise too good.

‚óè Blueberry Cooler ‚Äì Mild flavor drink. Okays type.

‚óè Cucumber Mint Mix ‚Äì Cucumber has its own refreshing power, and taking that item as a drinks is full of refreshment.

‚óè Passion Fruit Orange Cooler ‚Äì Mild orange flavor drink with beautiful fade orange colour.

‚óè Lemongrass cooler ‚Äì Till now I saw the usage of Lemongrass in the main course item, but as a drink, it was the first time for me. Distinct flavor of lemongrass with cooler.

Mamagoto Special item -

Dimsum Platter:

‚óè Chicken street style spicy dumpling ‚Äì Traditional dumpling with full minced chicken filling inside. Juice from inside. Love it.

‚óè Chicken and Pakchoi dumpling ‚Äì Chicken dumpling with coating of Pakchoi leaf. With the sauce, it taste like divine.¬†
‚óè Lamb roll with Pakchoi dumpling ‚Äì Another dumpling with Pakchoi coating from outside but this time lamb meat was inside. Lamb was perfectly cooked. Juicy and the fragrance was awesome in one word.

‚óè Prawn & Celery dumpling ‚Äì Now this is something, which you will not get in every store. Prawn filling dumpling with Celery touch. Colourful as well as tasty.

‚óè Prawn Enoki dumpling ‚Äì Enoki is one type of long mushroom. Keeping that Enoki with prawn filling inside of dumpling really need real craftsmanship. So kudos the Chef. Love it.

Veg Sushi Platter -

‚óè Crispy Mushroom

‚óè Asparagus tempura roll

‚óè Cucumber and spicy cheese

Though this was the first time for me to have the sushi, I love all of variant very much. Especially the Crispy Mushroom one really make me fan of it.

Non - Veg Sushi Platter -

‚óè Chicken Sushi

‚óè Crabstick California Rolls

‚óè Tempura Prawn sushi.

Non-veg touch in sushi was really something exciting things for me. Love all the variant equally but Crab one was too special to me. The fragrance of Crabmeat really blow my mind. Awesome in one word.

***All Sushi platter was served with three types of dip, i.e - Sesame Chilli Oil Dip, Chilli Oil dip and my personal favorite Red Wine Sauce dip.***

After having their signature dish, we headed for some of their special main course item. We tried -

‚óè Thai Phuchka ‚Äì This item was really made with some special craftsmanship. Six pieces Phuchka were served with special spices. There were also some spices kept on the top of it with cone shaped Beatle leaf. Take it in one gulp and it literally explode in your mouth.

‚óè Spicy Bangkok Bowl (chicken) ‚Äì A bowlful of steamed rice with minced spicy chicken on top. A boiled egg was beautifully garnished over the spicy chicken. The chicken was beautifully minced and rice was quite different from the ordinary rice. But love it. This one is one the highly demanded and most popular main course item here. Love it.

‚óè Sukiyaki Chicken Rice Noodles ‚Äì Flat shaped noodles served with lots of veggies and super fine sliced chicken pieces. The noodles were served with two types of sauce. Perfect item for all noodle lovers.

‚óè Thai Green Curry with Steamed Rice ‚Äì Green curry made with Thai touch. With traditionally coconut oil smell, the curry goes well with steamed rice. Little spicy but healthy item to try for.

Dessters -

‚óè Banoffee Pie ‚Äì Banana pie with cream over it. Okay type.

‚óè Mama's Homemade Chocolate cake ‚Äì Now this is something for die hard chocolate lovers. Four layers of cake fully filled with dark chocolate layer. Love it. Must try item here.

‚óè Coconut Panko banana with caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream ‚Äì Another pie, served with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce. Little pic slice with vanilla ice cream touch and caramel sauce on top, it just feel heavenly.

So in conclusion I‚Äôll say Mamagoto is one of the best restaurant in its area. With some special flavor and skillful craftsmanship, the restaurant make me fan of it. Overall a great dining experiences.

Little did I know that Mamagoto is going to spell such magical essence with their array of mouth watering dishes. Finally visited this place with bunch of my friends and got spell bound by their decor, ambiance and must mention, their food. Mamagoto brings ‚ÄòSuper Platter Festival‚Äô to our city and believe me this platters are just too delicious to be missed. Innovative with their Japanese, Thai and Chinese cuisine; this place never fails to impress their guests.

Quirky interesting interiors. Service good. Servers/waiters are very pleasant and give genuine suggestions in choosing a dish. Food is very good. Loved their Coconut Panko Banana with Caramel Sauce and vanilla ice cream..requested the coconut ice cream instead of the vanilla and they obliged üëç..the caramel drizzled over was very less, pointed that out and they happily got some more.üëç..overall enjoyable experience.. look forward to going there again..

What a delightful place! From the fun and Quirky decor to the warm and inviting ambiance to the first in class service, Mamagoto is every bit of your dream restaurant! We had sangria, lotus stem crisps, the non veg dimsum platter and coconut ice cream for desserts. Needless to say loved every bit of everything! The non veg dimsum platter is something that you shouldn't miss! Succulent chicken, prawn and lamb fillings in thin coating which melts in your mouth! The coconut ice cream in palm syrup is a treat for your sweet tooth! A total Instagram worthy experience! Looking forward to return to try the Spicy Bangkok Bowl and some Pan fried noodles! ‚ù§

'Mamagoto' in Japanese literally translates to 'playing with food' or 'to sense the food simply by its texture & shape'. Drawing inspiration from the same, the most talked about fusion Pan Asian F&B outlet of the city has curated a menu which is an amalgamation of ideas from Asian street style cooking and endless experiments going on in their secret kitchen. The ambience here is charged up with vibrant decor yet somewhat relaxed & casual when it comes to the dining experience. The food is amazing in terms of quality and portion size, with courteous staff guiding you throughout to have the best possible gastronomic affair. To put simply, this is a place where the whole idea is to have fun while you dig into some mind blowing dishes. Known for their fresh ideas, they keep coming up with new ventures, of which the latest pop up is the 'Super platter festival' going on currently that offers a wide range of Dimsums, Dumplings, Sushis and what not. Their beautifully crafted concoctions - alcoholic & non alcoholic, deconstructed time and again, deserves special mention. So, here's everything that made me fall in love with Mama >>

Dumpling platter >>
‚àÜPrawn Enoki Dumpling (5/5)- Tender yet crunchy white mushrooms added the perfect flavour to the minced prawn stuffing.
‚àÜPrawn & Celery Dumpling (4.5/5) - I loved the tangy taste of the celery leaves with the steamed Prawn.
‚àÜChicken & Pokchoi Dumpling (4/5) - Hot and spicy minced chicken with soft Pokchoi leaves tasted pretty good.
‚àÜLamb roll with Pokchoi Dumpling (5/5) - The lamb tasted really nice.
‚àÜChicken street style spicy Dumpling (4/5) - Cooked in street style, this one is a spicy Dumpling with minced meat stuffing.
All of these were served with 3 accompaniments (sesame chilli oil, chilli oil and red wine sauce) which added the right balance to the soft and hot Dumplings.

Sushi Platter (Vegetarian) >>

‚àÜCrispy Mushroom (5/5) - Veg Sushi never tasted so good. Pan fried mushrooms, perfectly Crispy in texture rolled into the sushi.
‚àÜAsparagus Tempura Roll (4/5) - Young leafy tips of asparagus, tempura fried into golden colour and crunchy in texture.
‚àÜCucumber & spicy cheese (3.5/5) - Good one if you're a cheese lover.

Sushi Platter (Non-vegetarian) >>

‚àÜTempura Prawn (5/5) - with prawns fried in tempura style and cucumber filled inside the sushi, and thinly sliced avocado on the top, I was in love with this one.
‚àÜCrabstick California roll (4/5) - Consists of avocado, cucumber and imitation crabmeat rolled together. Tasted nice.
‚àÜChicken Sushi (4/5) - Although not an authentic Sushi roll, it is a take on the meat version of Sushi which is made with minced chicken in sweet and spicy sauce.

The sushis were authentically served with Gari(Sushi ginger), soy sauce and wasabi.

Now, coming to the signature items -

‚Ä¢Thai Phuchka (5/5) - A must try fusion dish, this is their very own version of the famous Indian Pani Puri where the filling is replaced with a combination of Thai spices, herbs and dessicated coconut wrapped wonderfully inside beetle leaf. Served with sweet chilli sauce, chopped chillies and condiments, it is the perfect starter to any Asian meal.

‚Ä¢Spicy Bangkok Bowl (5/5) - A fiery bowl of fragrant gravy with flavoured sticky rice, is the go to comfort food during the winters. The outburst of flavours is sure to impress anyone.

‚Ä¢Sukiyaki Chicken Rice Noodles (4/5) - Flat Noodles Wok tossed in Thai sauces, having ample amounts of shredded chicken, this tasted great.

‚Ä¢Thai green curry (5/5) - A warm bowl of creamy curry with the right balance of galangal and coconut milk, this is a palate pleaser. Served with steamed rice, this is very soothing to the taste buds.

The beverages were vibrant and refreshing, which well complimented the fiery winter spices in the mains >>

‚àÜCranberry keffir lime punch
‚àÜKiwi mint colin
‚àÜBlueberry cooler
‚àÜCucumber mint mix
‚àÜWatermelon beach
‚àÜLemon zest & mint lemonade
‚àÜPassion fruit orange cooler

Last but not the least, for the sweet tooth >>

‚Ä¢Mama's homemade chocolate cake (5/5) - Sinful chocolate cake, with handful of chocolate icing, I couldn't have asked for a better way to finish the meal.
‚Ä¢Banoffee pie (3.5/5) - A classic English dessert pie made from bananas, cream and toffee combined together on a base of crumbled biscuits and butter. Quite good in taste and the mouth feel was pretty nice.
‚Ä¢Coconut Panko Banana with caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream (3.5/5) - Sweet, creamy blend of coconut and caramel tasted good with the ice cream.

And, even though our tummies were full, we left with a craving to be back soon.üíñ

Pretty much thanking god everyday that his place exists. 
Mamagoto is a theme restaurant which is brilliant at its decor and it‚Äôs food. 
We went on a rainy day to find sushi to our luck they had recently started serving sushi in a platter, even though they got the name of the type of sushi wrong. 
We ordered the dimsum platter and the sushi platter with a whole range of flavours- pork, chicken, fish, prawns and crabs too! The entire spread was wonderful in the mouth and they even coated one of the sushis with caviar that popped in our mouths - absolute joy! 
In addition, we got the green apple white sangria pitcher which was sangria like you‚Äôve never had before - light, white and still refreshing for a weekend lunch! 
Later we also got the pork tacos which was another whole range of flavours!! 
Definitely going to come back here for more and more.

Usually I am very fond of mamagoto and I swear by them for any experiments with Asian food. I have tried their food in different branches and in different Cities too. 
However, this time, Calcutta Mamagoto disappointed me. I ordered for a Veg Thai Green curry which was very well-done, creamy with the right amount of Tanginess, lemon-grass flavour (some places over do it) and texture. 
However any food is an experience, it's not just the product that matters but also the entire logistics of it. 
The packaging was leaking already, spilling the gravy in the packet by the time it got it(mind you, there is no problem with delivery). Consequently a lot of the gravy was already wasted. It is the improper packaging of the restaurants. Moreover the most irritating thing was that they served no rice along with it. 
Now I have tried Thai curry in different parts of the country and there is a reason why this is a complete dish. Because it is always served with steamed rice. The restaurant personnel should have atleast informed that they do not serve rice !

I am retaining my earlier rating here and holding this event as an exception. However such instances in future jeopardise the brand name of the franchise.

What could be better than delicious things wrapped in dough? Try a whole festival devoted to delicious things wrapped in dough.

Mamagoto. The word actually means to interact with your food,to play with the flavours and bring out an awesome dish. That's what Mamagoto actually does.
Eating out at the end comes down to taste. And this one earns full score for it.
The minute I entered the place I was like Wow! I am in a nice place. The d√©cor , the ambience, the music is like the cherry on the cake. Prime location and the viewside a plus definitely.
The subtle and authentic taste, aroma and sight actually gives you the whole food experience. The dips were to die for. You keep guessing what's in there. I had the best Pan- fried noodles of my life. The service is quick too and the staff actually care about the feedback . It definitely makes your pocket lighter but it's worth in awhile.
I am actually grateful to Mamagoto for this experience. Would love to be there again.
All the bestüëç!

In short - I loved Mamagoto! It left me with an interesting aftertaste...

My visit to Mamagato last evening was everything but fortuitous. My wife and I had planned the visit a week ago following our return to this beautiful city after almost a decade. [Meanwhile the net and intermittent visits kept me updated on Kolkata's rapid yet steady gastronomic evolution.]

Firstly the location of Mamagoto brought back sweet memories of 'Waldorf' - the Chinese restaurant that had once captivated the City's heart and gourmets' tongues alike. Having stepped in I found the smiling blue bear as welcoming as the pleasant chiaroscuro. Kanai Das, meriting special mention, upon learning our¬†preference,¬†happily suggested the dishes we should be trying on our maiden visit. The¬†gesture delighted me...

Coming to the food - I just loved them - period!¬†
My work has taken me across the globe allowing on several occasions opportunities to try out celebrated eateries. At Mamagoto too I sought to get surprised and deliberately didn't seek 'tradition' in what they offered. Often traditional cuisine fails to delight when served in its strict native fashion - and overdone allegiance to rule is definitely inconducive to a cuisine's growth to its potential. Mamagoto did please me - particularly with novelty & earthiness in food-presentation, warmth, balance in taste, perfectly cooked and crispy chicken-strips [loved the crackle when they succumbed between my teeth] and the variety of sauces served. The attending waiter volunteered to suggest the sauces to pair with the dishes ordered for.
The following dishes are recommended to those raring to take the plunge¬† - Tom yum soup [perfectly thick to start a great course], prawn dumplings to accompany the soup, chicken wanton, chicken satay [loved it], chilli pepper fish in black bean sauce, chicken ribbon prawn wafer, fried egg rice [Indonesian] and Thai pad shrimp noodle. [Their one bowl of soup can serve four - trust me!] The dumplings adequately carried the subtle hints of delicate herbs.¬†

I would suggest my fellow food-lovers not to 'prepare' before trying a new joint out - and just to step in with a clean slate and be surprised! I have mostly found the results worth this unpreparedness [or the risk]. I seek waiter's help [like sommelier's for wine] while placing¬†order for the first time - that design mostly stood me in good stead as far as good food is concerned. They would sincerely guide you to the ones they are best at - and that's exactly what you need!

The climaxing surprise came with Milan's offering of a beautiful cake topped with caramel sauce and Vanilla Ice-cream - gratis! Thanks Milan...

Mamagoto - A definitive destination for every gourmet! Go and give in...

What can I say about this place. I ordered Chicken three pepper bomb and chicken Bali Bamia noodles with high expectations. However. The restaurant failed to deliver that not just in taste but by serving uncooked chicken in the gravy item. When that wasn‚Äôt enough - I found the shell of an egg in the noodles.

The food and my experience consuming them were an absolute disaster.

For a meal that costs nearly 1,000 - it all went down into the waste bin.

Because, I am overwhelmed by the experience I had there. It was on my list for a real real long time. We went on my birthday and was pretty much excited. The restaurant has a very heavy wooden door entrance, that has the waiting area and a tall bear wearing a black sunglass is welcoming you with some real SWAG! üòÇ The paintings are pretty much interesting, depicting Chinese and Japanese women, a royal Bengal tiger, chilling and having a great time.

Coming to the food part-

Starter we ordered - Rainbow Chicken Dumplings, which was garnished with red-yellow-green bell peppers on the topping. And was deliciously mouth watering. The taste was on point. And I loved the decoration. (5/5). ‚úîÔ∏è

In Main Course We Ordered -
Chicken Fried Rice, Sliced Chicken In Black Bean Sauce And Mushroom, Prawn In Mama's Sauce.

‚û°Ô∏èFried Rice was filled with lots of vegetables and the chicken was perfectly fine. I don't know why, but I the loved the fried rice so much. It was very delicious. (5/5)‚úîÔ∏è

‚û°Ô∏èSliced Chicken In Black Bean Sauce And Mushroom, is for those who prefer less spicy food. So it was totally perfect for me. Chicken were totally garnished. I don't know when was the last time I ate this amazing chicken? It was made with real Asian ingredients. Highly recommend to everyone. I am so satisfied. (5/5). ‚úîÔ∏è

‚û°Ô∏èPrawn in Mama's sauce is their speciality. And the host asked us to try that. We did, and I am GLAD we did. The presentation was worthy generous.
Their accompanying condiments, sauces are excellent and hot. (4.5/5). ‚úîÔ∏è

‚û°Ô∏èAnd, lastly we ordered (Mocktails) -
Blue Berry Cooler And Fresh Lime Mint Soda.
It was so on the point. Their mocktail glasses are designed with a fat chubby Japanese human being. Which is quite interesting. I loved the frozen drinks.

Basically, It Was a hit for me. Staffs were concerned about what their guests are ordering and if they are getting it or not in time. If you're in mood of Pan Asian cuisine, then mamagoto is the place for you. Also, the ambience is very impressive. ‚úîÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Thank you so much for making my nineteen birthday special. I was extremely happy after coming back home. Highly recommended to everyone. :)

P.S - the pocket pinch is significant. :p
Happy dine in! ‚ù§Ô∏è

This place just owned my heart with both it's food and the beautiful ambience! Located at the heart of Parkstreet, just at the annex building of magma house complex, this place is very easy to locate. A perfect place to dine in for great Thai, or Asian or chineese food!! The great thing is that they serves all types of alcohol, with several mocktails and cocktails in their menu!! The ambience is very much soothing and quircky! The ambience just own my heart.
Now coming to the most important part that is food!!
I and my sister visited the place, so we started our dinner with the Ice tea in lemon flavours!
The drink was good.
Now coming to the starters -
Before coming to the starters i must say.. If you visit Mamagoto their Dumplings is a must try!
They offer a huge range of menu of dumplings, which you can order by your preferences.
We ordered their signature dumplings which was minced chicken dumplings. The dumplings had the exact flavours and spices in it and it was perfect in taste.
From the huge range of diffrrent types of starters they offered, we choose Aunt's chicken platter which comprised of several preparations of chicken served with special sauces! Each of the items tasted too good! The Aunt's platter came for around 699 bucks and they also had beer combo with many items which you can preffer if you are into alcohols.
Now coming to the main course-
Spicy Bangkok bowl was ordered! A dish which can be shared by two persons! And note this dish is for the person who love spicy dishes! Served with rice and gravy this was indeed great in taste. And recommended for those who love to try different kind of dishes other than regular chineese or thai dishes.
In desserts we ordered Mamas home made choclate cake, a most tempting dessert dish for all those choclate lovers! The choclate that melts in your mouth giving the ultimate treat to your taste buds!
This place is a bit on a high range but yeah i must say the quality and the quantity of the food serve will never make you regret on spending money here.
Our total bill was Rs 2844 all inclusive for the above items.
Yes we enjoyed the ambience here, the food was great and the staffs behaviour were great too.
Kanhai das needs a special mention for serving us too well.
Overall this place deserves a visit! Looking forward to visit again!!

Another restaurant that‚Äôs rapidly gaining popularity in Park Street is Mamagoto. This place specialises in Asian food. The common choices you find outside in most restaurants, you don‚Äôt get it here. If you‚Äôre in the mood to try something unusual, this is the right place. Till the time our food arrived we were served prawn crisps with dressing. For starters we ordered prawn wrapped in bacon. The dressing was a bit sticky and sweet but nonetheless I enjoyed it a lot. Next we ordered a rice bowl, bimbimbap. It is served with spicy rice, mushrooms, saut√©ed veggies and chicken with an egg placed over the rice. The flavour combinations were interesting but the chicken was a bit dry. Some kind of dressing or gravy would‚Äôve really lifted the dish. And then we ordered for something familiar, Cantonese noodles. It tasted great, the noodles were crispy and the gravy was beautifully balanced. Overall we had good food. The staff here is very courteous. Service is great, portions are good but the place is quite pricey.

One of the much talked about Asian cuisine restaurants in town, I had a mixed experience here.
Ambience-- very cool. Loved it.
Service-- this is the thing which really irked me because although we went around 5pm for a late lunch and the restaurant was almost empty, they didn't want to give us a 4 seater window seat initially! (We were 2 people).However after having a talk with them we finally got one.
Order- ordered for mama's special shrimp dumplings, Asian barbeque chicken, noodle khaosuey and home made caramel sponge cake with icecream. (1 of each).
Food- the shrimp dumplings were overpriced according to me. 4 pieces for around 325 plus taxes. But yes they had generous servings of shrimp inside. Personally I did not like the taste because lemongrass really turns me down and this dish had an over dose of lemongrass flavor. But my friend on the other hand loved it. So as I said its a personal palatal choice.
The Asian barbeque chicken was huge in quantity and actually difficult for 2 persons to finish. Taste wise, barring the lemongrass flavour (yes this one too), I liked it.
The noodle khaosuey was amazing and again had a huge portion. We really struggled to finish it and its a complete dish by itself. Has a nice flavourful broth with chicken and veggies. Thankfully this one didn't have lemongrass rather had a delightful hit of coconutty flavour. Its the kind of bowl you want to sit with on a cold wintery day to comfort your soul.
The caramel sponge cake with icecream was good. Its not an extraordinary dessert but certainly not bad.
Pocket pinch- around 2k
Overall-- as I said it was a rather mixed kind of experience.

A very huge dissapointent.food is very good no doubt about it.but then u order a dish for 599 + 10 % service tax + 18 % gst which comes upto rs 777 n the quantity is so less that  i had to again order steamed rice to finish the gravy.i do not mind paying for good food but so less quantity.not worth visiting twice.for rs777 i would rather have a buffet at barbeque nation with so many items.

Was in some grave need of Asian food and decided to visit mamagoto this diwali mainly because of manga loving friends.
We had ordered crispy lotus stem, old school gyoza and a non veg dumpling platter for starters. Didn't really like the dumplings but the fried lotus stems tossed in hot and sweet sauce were really good.
For the main course it was smoky BBQ pork belly bowl served with sticky rice,
the laksa tribute and the very Japanese spicy ramen bowl.
The pork belly with sticky rice was amazing but the laksa stole the show.This has to be one of the best Japanese noodle soup, after the ramen obviously.
The coconut base and lemon grass is a combination to die for.
Was looking for a pork version of the ramen which isn't available as of now. None the less the ramen was okayish to my liking.
And then came the walnut brownie with vanilla ice cream (the dessert that can never grow old) and coconut panko banana with caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream.

Had a happy end to diwali'17.

This place was in my wishlist for quite some time and we finally got a chance to visit this place during the Durga Puja's¬† and I must say that it was totally worth it.¬† First of all, the ambiance is very cozy. The table we got was beside the window which gave a very pretty view of Park Street. For starters we had Street Style Spicy Dumplings Chicken and Prawns Wrapped in Bacon. Both the dishes were awesome. The prawns had an amazing smoky aftertaste.

For the mains we had Mamagoto's Chicken Broth Noodle Bowl, Yangchow Champions Fried Rice and Crispy Fish Fillet tossed in Spicy Black Pepper Sauce. The Fried Rice was very light and super-tasty and paired really well with the fish. The noodle bowl was good as well.¬†

Overall it was a great experience and hope to visit again in the future.

The green bear welcomes you and you know you will be served larger than expectations. It goes well with amicable service, ambience. And food! Hot basil chicken cups, it's a must try. Why? Because the crunchy fresh lettuce and electricity of spice chicken with proper dips is no where else provided. Rice bowls are adequately spiced and sumptuous for two. Lastly, one thing to improve is however their seafood section.

Didn't like
The teriyaki bowl, just didn't like it at all (though they more than made up for it later)
The fish was spicy which I loved , my friend couldn't touch
Limited veg options so one of my friends found it difficult to choose

Will return for the amazing service :)

We loved the decor of the place. It had a lovely energy and the place was buzzing with a nice crowd. A refreshing drink welcomed us as a compliment from the mama itself, to be followed later by rice crispies and nice dips. The smoked chicken tacos were the yummiest tacos I had in a long time. The ice tea was soothing while we had our fill of 3 pepper bomb chicken and champion rice. The coconut ice cream was delicious and the perfect way to end a lovely lunch. We are revisiting very soon!

We visited on a Saturday afternoon and had to wait for 45 minutes which was not ideal but our food was amazing so I'm glad we waited. We'd ordered a cranberry drink, a mojito and they were both up to the mark. For entr√©e, we had these puchkas stuffed with ginger and betel leaf and toasted coconut. It was presented beautifully and I loved the first bite of it but it's more of a dessert than an entree as it's too sweet and has way too much coconut for my liking. 
For main course, we had a Balinese noodles and it was just delicious. I don't think I've had better noodles than that at any other restaurant and I've had quite a few! It was spicy and Tangy and hit all the right notes for me. 
By this time, we were quite full because we aren't big eaters but we couldn't say no to dessert and ordered the homemade chocolate cake. This was again an indulgent victory. My face lit up when I tasted it and I absolutely loved it. 
All in all, it was a great experience, Quirky ambiance, speedy service ( once you get your table üòõ ) and not expensive at all! 
Will return soon ‚ù§Ô∏è

Having dined in other cities, wanted to check it out here too. The food is more appealing for the non-vegetarian, but there are still many unique and delicious options for vegetarians as well. The laksa tribute dish definitely needs a mention which was  very flavourful. The place is more suitable for small crowds but is very lively and vibrant. Service is quick and price is reasonable.
Valet parking is available too.

We lost our way trying to find this camouflaged restaurant. But it was worth the find. As soon as we reached, I was amazed by the decor.especially the upside down tables. 
The ambience was too good to miss. Staff were nothing but polite. We were given a complimentary bowl of rice/tapioca crisps while we waited for the food.
Even though it was a Saturday afternoon, we got a pretty decent seat by the window. Food that we ordered was one crispy fish fillet and a choice of mixed fried rice üçö ( forgot the name, oops). It had lamb, chicken, eggs, prawn. Tasted heavenly.
I wanted to Order One menu item that is bbq pork loin rice bowl. But both of us were too full. We decided to take some coolers to soothe our full tummy.
Orange iced tea and mint cucumber mix proved to be an interesting choice of drinks but I recommend you order the coolers before the meal.
The total bill came out to be 1370 including taxes. Worth visiting at least once.

What to say about this place? A foodies paradise... I am an absolute fan of this place. I have also visited their Bangalore outlet in Indiranagar few years back. Massive fan of that one as well. Personally I prefer their watermelon martini and guavagoto. Lipsmacking... Try any food and you won't be disappointed... I am however a big fan of their ramen....

If it's not the usual Chinese dishes you are looking for but want to eat Oriental cuisine anyways, this is the place where you come.
Ever since I first ate at their Mumbai fort area outlet, I have been a fan. I have tried their outlet at Delhi Emporio mall as well. I am not exaggerating when I say that I have longed for this chain to enter the Kolkata fine dining space and was elated when my prayers were promptly answered a year after I moved to this city.
It is located at park street and thus couldn't be more central. They have valet so that's a pain taken care of since in park street,parking is an issue.
The decor is fresh and unique, yet comfortable. They have a good bar sitting area as well.
Their menu properly explains everything and doesn't leave you with questions.
Service prompt and efficient. And The Food (anything on the menu) is delicious.
Their quantity is large and usually sufficient for 4.
Would Recommend it to all.

The meaning of mamagoto is to play with food while enjoying it's texture, shape and taste. It's basically a Japanese word, and the name only interesting enough to draw my attention while I found it once in Park Street while passing by.

Location:
__________
It's located in park Street. If you started from the music world place towards St xeviers you will find it on right hand side in a minute or less.

Decoration:
____________
It's decorated well and the light is quite soothing. Having the whole wooden interior gives it quite a refreshing look also.

Food:
__________

Coming to the main segment now. The food and drink we had. Mamagoto offers a brilliant Asian cuisine.

Starters:
__________

‚úì Rainbow Chicken Dumplings : we took one of 6 pieces, the rainbow thing is nothing but it decoration of 4 pieces of capsicums of different colours. But the main appeal is the taste of it. It's amazing.

‚úì Crispy Fish Fillets in Spicy Black Papper sauce : it was a part of main course. Though we have asked them to make it dry as we wanted it in Starters. It was okay type to me. And the fish is also Basa. So disappointed a bit.

‚úì Prawn Wrapped in Becon : this is just superb. Prawn ( well size) wrapping in Becon tossed in a sweet, sour sauce is just out of the world.

Beverages:
______________

‚úì Canberry and Kafir Lime Punch : it's nice. Quite refreshing.
‚úì Virgin Mojito: best among all we had. The perfect mix and damn refreshing . We took it thrice.
‚úì Lemon Zest and Mint lemonade: it's not that good. I was expecting a bit refreshner. It was not.
‚úì Kiwi and Mint Collins : okay type.
‚úì watermelon beach : this one is very good.

Main Courses:
_________________

‚úì Yanchow Champion Fried Rice : fried rice with chicken, lamb, shrimp. This is an example of a dish how a just simple fried rice can be so well cooked and tastey.

‚úì Hakka Chicken Noodles: amazing one. You could have it without any sides even. It's that well tasted.

‚úì Pan Fried Chicken Noodle : it's owsum. One of d best pan fried noodles I have ever had. Cooked in red sauce and the chicken and pea nut with the noodles was just amazing.

‚úì Chicken Three Papper Bomb : Chicken tossed in black Papper and gravy. Quite nice.

‚úì Fish in Black Papper: it's okay type.

Yes we are full enough to have the dessert. May be next time.

The quality of food is just mind blowing with out a doubt. But disappointed with the fish items ( not prawn ) and mocktail.

I would recommend to taste their other items as max items the server if fantastic taste and quality.

So be choosy to have mocktail and fish items there. Otherwise I found it just fantastic.

They charge 10 percent service charge by default. But we I asked them to remove that, they did it.

So, total cost 5684 INR for 6 heads.

To All : be there if you wanted to taste good chinies for sure.

So after a lot of change of plans, finally hit this place today with my girlfriend
Great ambience, great food
The staff was good too and very helpful
Though i thought the quantity was a bit less in comparison to the price but the quality was top class
Loved everything I ordered 
The sailor's dimsum is so yummy, i wish i could have thousands
The cranberry and kafir lime punch was a bit too lemony at first but then you get used to it and it tastes better
Spiced asian bbq chicken breast, my word.. wow
Chicken sukiyak rice noodles was really good too, loved the flavours
Lastly the dessert, choco walnut fudge cake.. amazing üòç

Heard about it a lot, located in a prime location on park street. Decided to visit the place but was surprisingly disappointed.

Decor: Street style decor was very unique and innovative.

Staff: Has fair knowledge of food and not much of the cocktails and what goes in the cocktail that we had ordered.
A packaged water bottle was initially place on the table which they removed when we wanted regular water. That wasn't very polite.
Also we saw a couple of them quarreling loudly which wasn't pleasant. 

Food: This much hyped place also disappointed us in food. The pork char sui bun wasn't to our liking and overly expensive. The grilled chicken was kind of soggy and the cocktails were flat.
I know that the place is known for their bowls, but the other dishes has to be up to the mark atleast.
Hope ours was a off day. The place had only 3 tables occupied on a weekend which was again surprising.

Overall: Hope ours was a bad day and would like to try out their bowls for which they are famous.
The dishes we ordered just did not justify the steep prices.

Wanted to try some new place in park street area . Checked in zomato and found this place with a very good rating. Hence, thought of trying it as we were with our family.
A place with nicely decorated interiors and worth visiting with family, friends or even with your loved one, maybe on a date too.
Little expensive but you won‚Äôt complain about the little extra penny spent on the food there.
A must visit..
Happy Eating !

I visited the same restaurant again.. this time in a different city.. and surprisingly we quite liked the food this time.. we reached the place around 2.. and were lucky to get a window seat.. it was raining outside and the view was relaxing.. the decor inside was similar to the Hyderabad branch.. but the tables were pretty innovative.. we took a lot of selfies before ordering food and the servers were patient regarding that.. for starters we tried rock shrimp tempura.. it was basically around 20 low fried shrimp. But the shrimps were damn soft and tasted great with mayonnaise and the coating was thin.. full 5 for this preparation.. for the main course we ordered the laksa tribute and friery thai shrimp fried rice with Asian green chili chicken ribbon.. the laksa tribute was chicken noodle in laksa soup which lad coconut and lemongrass flavours.which came with half boiled egg and a piece of potato fry... the other was shimp fried rice.. topped with poached egg.. and shrimp crackers (papad) and chicken ribbon decoration.. I liked both.. and this time, the quantity was enough for 3 of us.. loved the service as well.. would love to visit again..

Went there for the Nabami Grand Lunch. Located at mid-way between Barbeque Nation and Marco Polo. Top-notch ambience, spacious enough, courteous staff, have a similar open kitchen system like that of Asia Kitchen.

STARTERS -
Complimentary Rice cracker with house speciality dip .
Crispy Fried lotus Stem. (4.5/5)
Traditional Peking Dumpling. (5/5)
Crispy Fried Lamb. (3/5) - too tangy.

MAIN COURSE -
SPICY BANGKOK BOWL, with sticky rice. (4/5)
Udon Prawn Noodles. (4.5/5) - prawns were too less in numbers.

Desserts -
Coconut Ice - cream. (5/5)
Pujo Special Complimentary Mishti Doi Cheese Cake - totally loved it, yum it was!
The place is a bit more suitable for experimental foodies and not for those who have typical bengali taste buds. Prices are enough high on pocket, but their speciality cuisine quite justifies it. Overall had a nice experience.

So our customary Dashami lunch was at Mamagoto

As it is Puja...some food from the menu given in zomato were missing, yet whatever we had is worth every penny.

STARTERS
Rock shrimp tempura
Hot basil chicken cups (this is a must try...minced chicken and the lettuce cups served separately)

DRINKS
Virgin mojito
Vojito
Classic margarita (shaken)

They give complementary rice crackers

MAIN COURSE
We took one rice bowl and asked for their suggestion for Hakka noodles....
Fiery Thai shrimp fried rice with Asian green chilli chicken ribbons from the rice bowls menu
For the noodles they served flat Udon noodles with shrimps..

As it was Puja, they gave a complementary misti doi cheese cake which was slight high on sweet

I should mention the people working there have good knowledge about the food and they only recommended that we stick to two dishes of main course initially as they two dishes are enough to serve four of us...

I personally want to visit their again when they will have full-fledged menu to offer

Went for an early dinner here yesterday.Loved the d√©cor-it was very oriental with sumo wrestlers and there is an open kitchen.The ambience was good.Staff was courteous.
We had Honey chicken,chicken satay,wang chai chicken in midnight sauce,pad thai noodles.Loved all the items. Their taste is different from the mainstream oriental restaurants. They also gave complimentary crackers and cheesecake which were an added bonus.Loved the gesture. Overall a lovely experience.
P.S. They add a 10% service charge on the basic amount which they said isn't mandatory upon enquiry.

Thank you for making my Bijoya Dashami so memorable. I didn't find any flaws. Starting from its prompt service untill the quality of food and ambiance, it was so desirable. Mamagoto is my current favorite for it's exquisite and fresh flavor which differentiates it from other restaurants. My meal started with chicken sweet corn soup along with fried bhetki fish fillet. My pick of the day was fiery thai shrimp fried rice with Asian green chili chicken ribbons. The complimentary stuffs were pure delite. Looking forward to explore more. :)

Heard a lot about this place , the interiors of this place is very fascinating however the food is ok tho I did not try the dumplings anyway , Asian food is of many types and has a lot of fancy names to it , if u go by the fancy names u'll get a lot of choices . What I ordered had a very interesting name but honestly it was just simply schezwan fried rice (shirmps) with fried chicken , what I did enjoy is a lime n mint drink recommended by the lady which was a treat totally over all a nice experience I had .it's a nice place to visit occasionally ,it's over priced tho for the food that is served, tho would like to try the dumplings and see how it is ....

among numerous restaurants at the park street area it felt nothing new at first.But it grew on us gradually. The ambience is nice-not over the top not overly simplistic, quite likable. 
As far as the food is concerned you won't have any complaint regarding taste or variety. The staffs are fully equipped to help you out with the menu and do ask them for 2nd thought or final call-it helped us quite a lot. 
Only a wee-bit room for improvement must be the look/feel or the presentation of the food.It's not bad in any sense but the overall feeling is 'ok'ish or 'this is oh so common' kind of.
Overall a cool place for Oriental cuisine. Recommended üëç

This is a 'Cool' place as the language of young people goes! But what makes it 'Cool'? 1.The ambience is funky...with nicely decorated brick walls and rope pillars. Loved the green bear at the entrance. 2. Super quick service even during rush hours of Puja and it feels good if somebody with a smiling face serves you food,doesn't it? 3. The main star of the show,the food...You get to choose from a varied spread of  spicy, well cooked and perfectly seasoned Asian dishes. We tried Rice Paper Spring Rolls, Dried Chilli Prawns,Bibimbap,Black Bean chicken, Coconut and Palm Sugar Ice-cream. Each and every dish was delicious. 
Would like to explore more and visit again sometime soon.

I was recommended this place by a friend; had the pleasure of visiting it today.

The restaurant is quite is easy to locate. It's right beside Marco Polo, although locating the front door could be tricky, especially if there's no guard on the door.

The ambience is quite hip and has a contemporary feel to it. The decorations are neither scanty nor overcrowding the place (just the right amount). They also have a background music thing going on, which adds to the mood. Coming to the service, they were both prompt and courteous. Ask them what a particular dish is and they'll explain it to you in great details (along with their recommendations).

We had ordered the following:
*Hot Basil Chicken Cups - if you're looking to try something new, then this is a must have dish (don't ask me to explain the dish, try it, you'll know)
*Spicy Bangkok Bowl Chicken - this dish comes with the option of sticky rice or the normal rice which we're used to. To put it simply, it's nothing but really well cooked rice (with an assortment of spices) topped with a thick and spicy chicken gravy (the chicken was shredded).
*Stir Fried Udon Noodles Prawn - my personal favorite, this dish is basically spicy cooked Thai noodles with large sized prwans. One bite of this dish will definitely tingle your senses.
*Kiwi and Mint Collins, and Blue Berry Cooler - freshly made mocktails to finish off a great meal.

All in all, I would definitely recommend this place to someone looking for a great Oriental meal. However, a word of caution, the prices are on the steeper side. If money is not an issue, then DO try this place out.

Mamagoto seemed to be a very fresh new place with great food & everything¬†else..and guess what it is indeed. From courteous staff to¬†great food...so tasty and lip-smacking that we were craving for more quantity :p , it is located just ahead of the barbeque nation if u are coming from Xavier's side. above a car's showroom.coming to food: we had ordered prawns wrapped in bacon which was out of the world in taste but quantity wise I expected some more pieces could have sufficed. then orange and passion fruit with red wine which went well with the appetizer & ¬†then ordered " a Thai lost in hunan and spicy Bangkok bowl chicken" ¬†both of them were extremely good in taste to wrap up this delicious lunch experience I ordered two dessert items which stood awsome too..¬†"the banofee pie and chunky caramel sponge cake"¬†Pocket pinch: this place has a slightly higher than average pricing on food but that is justified I guess if u consider the staff behaviour, presentation of food, and taste.the same service charge problem occurred¬†to me but upon asking they said "if u ask we will remove the service charge which by govt order customers cannot be compelled to pay"u can find the¬†order for clarity by typing "guidelines on serivce charges, department of consumer affairs"

This place was in our wishlist since a long time and finally visited here on ponchomi,this puja.
After a wait of 20 mins we got a seat.
Ambience is absolutely beautiful with rustic feels.
We took a litchi rose cocktail,Honey chicken,Rainbow chicken dumplings and a thai shrimp fried rice bowl with asian green chili chicken strips. 

‚Ä¢Litchi Rose Cocktail-An absolutely unique kind of vodka based cocktail with hint of rose syrup in litchi juice.It costs 350/- 
Recommended.

‚Ä¢Honey Chicken-8 soft pieces of chicken glazed in honey dressing served with bell pepper is lip smacking.

‚Ä¢Rainbow chicken dumpling-4 pieces of dumpling costs 310/- and is pricey but the taste is worth it.

‚Ä¢Thai Shrimp Fried rice bowl-Rice bowls are very wholesome and sufficient for two.Thai fried rice is my all time favourite which had generous amount of shrimps.Comes with strips of asian green chilli chicken,Poached egg and prawn chips.We loved every bit of this dish.Recommended.

We were too full to have dessert and will surely try next time.
Staffs are friendly and service is prompt.
They really explained the dishes nicely to us.
We were served with complimentary chips at the beginning of meal.
They levy 10% service charge in addition to GST.
Pocket pinch-1.5k min for two for a nice meal.

I was always very skeptical about Japanese restaurants although Mamagoto is probably a fusion and anyhow I had skipped the Japanese items. I must say Mamagoto will give you a unique culinary experience especially with their Pork Belly Meal(Paradise for Pork Lovers). We had ordered two large pegs of Laphroaig served neat with Fried Calamari and their special Barbeque Roasted Chicken. The calamari was kinda ok but I really liked the Barbeque Roasted Chicken. The Pork Belly Meal was out of this world. A+ Pork meat along with equally impressive rice. Staff Kanai Das was very kind  and helped us choose the right dish for our Single Malt. Located at the heart of Park street, this is a highly recommended restaurant for all foodies.

We were deciding where to eat Thai food while visiting Calcutta.

We had selected Ban Thai and this place, decided to visit ban Thai later part of this week and give mamagoto a try....

 Coming down to food as this is what the forum is all about. We ordered tofu, dumpling in bok choy 
Followed by red Thai noodle soup 

The food was fantastic and so was the service 
It was a pleasure to have dined here

This place is amazing. Starting from the service to the food. 

The food is Oriental based. Where I would recommend the newly launched dim sums as starters. Pad Thai  and Basil fried rice chicken are their signature dishes which after ordering, you can't go wrong with it. It's definitely worth it. The food is a mix of Japanese,chinese and Thai. The chef can spice up the dishes and customise it. 

The service is excellent. So is the ambience. This definitely gets a thumbs up from me. For the food, service and ambience. 

The restaurant is a bit expensive. They also charge gst and service charge separately.

Park Street is the food street of the city where various restaurants are jostling from the bygone days to the present time.Mamagoto is a pleasant twist to the food zone offering oriental cuisines with quirkiness.A giant blue bear will welcome you with folded hands and you know that this place is for fun.Various photographs of Japanese culture added the right amount of drama to the place.The bar counter & open kitchen were oh so cool.In the menu there were number of dishes with wide veg options.Cranberry Kaffir Lime Punch was soothing while we waited for the food.Bophut Village Chicken Wings had a honey coconut twist that I loved.In the main course Fiery Thai Shrimp Fried Rice with Asian Green Chilli along with Crispy Fish Fillet with Spicy Black Pepper Sauce had cool tangy taste and drama.The dessert offerings were thin in comparison.Courteous staffs & prompt service added to the wow factor.And thankfully they were not playing those blurting music to spoil the food journey.But the forced billing of 10% service charge before adding the SGST & CGST was severely uncool.On asking they returned the SC amount but it was weird nonetheless.Please take care of such error as everything else was simply great!

Great ambiance. First, we were welcomed by a nice attendant, then by a huge blue teddy. Then we went upstairs and ordered for our lunch. we ordered for hot basil chicken cup,Java grilled fish in red hot sambal sauce, 2¬†panfried noodles with shrimps and black bean sauce, 2 smoky BBQ pork belly bowl. Hot basil chicken was basically a wrap type dish,tasted all good. Java grilled fish disappointed us then, though it was said that it's with red sauce but it tasted bland. Pan fired noodles - this was the only dish that was unexpectedly good. with so many shrimps,balck beans, broccoli, ¬†zucchini - it was flavourful. Then smoky BBQ pork belly dish which comes with rice was quite bitter in taste, it disappointed us again. Only the rice part was good and flavourful. The service was quite prompt but people who served us were quite messy. They served three of us the whole meal and skipped our fourth partner repeatedly. not organised that much.

Mamagoto is, according to Google, a type of Japanese food arrangement, where children are encouraged to play with their food, so that they are able to understand concepts of colour, texture, taste better.

As you enter Mamagoto (bang on Park Street, very near the Camac Street crossing), you are welcomed by a massive blue teddy bear wearing sunglasses. So, the name makes sense. :P

As does the fun casual decor - the low but cheerful lighting, loads of sumo wrestler graffiti, Japanese paintings. The live bar counter, with the bartenders mixing your drinks in front of you, is fun to watch.

We opted for Street style Spicy Chicken Dumplings for starters, along with fresh watermelon juice and a cocktail whose name escapes me now. We were served complimentary shredded prawn wafers, with a sweet sauce and tremendously hot dry chilli sauce. They were both heaven, especially in combination.

The dumplings were ordinary, but the street style sauces served with it were excellent to say the very least.

For main course, we ordered The Laksa Tribute - a Large Bowl that serves two people very comfortably, and are served in separate bowls. It was heaven, to say the least. Thick, creamy coconut soup, with the typical lemongrass smell, filled with large pieces of chicken and Laksa Noodles - the mere thought is saliva inducing. The staff were very very friendly and cooperative in helping us choose the menu.

The last point I want to mention is both a plus and a minus. I've been looking for the Bira White in a lot of places in Kolkata, but sadly it's been out of stock. Found it here, and was elated, especially since I was dying to make my hubby taste it. However, the MRP 110/- beer cost us 450 bucks here, that too before taxes. I understand premium restaurants can charge more than MRP for alcohol, but 4times the MRP is a bit too much.

In any case, it's a superb restaurant with price slightly on the higher side, though I believe considering the great quality of food, it's worth a try if you're in Park Street.

Mamagoto is the Japanese word for playhouse for food where eating is a sensory delight . The restaurant based around the theme of Japanese pop culture meets Asian street food is a part of a chain of some  repute. This outlet in park street has been around for a year and captured in a lot of hype from the PYT's of the city.
The decor and ambiance is a@ full on homage to Japanese pop art , down to the open Japanese style kitchen and the server's uniforms. Loved the blue bear at the reception.
The food today was a mix of hits and misses for me. The chicken satay was hard and because the chunks were so big it hadn't cooked through . The peanut butter sauce was nice. The shrimp dumplings looked amazing on the plate but didn't like the texture though it come with an amazing sauce. The crispy lamb was nice though as was the fish though as

For starters we took hua hin rolls which was great; cranberry juice and hot basil chicken cups(the best one I had till date), chicken breast which was let down. For main course we had prawn gravy and chicken noodles and it tasted good. We took chocolate cake for dessert and it was mouthwatering. 
Recommendation for people is to visit the place for fine dining and enjoy above mentioned dishes

Great ambience, very good service and good Food - This is the best way to sum up my experience here. Went with my family few days back.

Let me begin by stating how wonderfully they manage the waiting guests. They send you an sms with your waiting position and there is a link to see the current status. We started with 9 so we went around on Park Street going street shopping. I kept refreshing abd when the number became 1, we moved back towards the Restaurant. By the time we reached, our table was ready. Best waiting experience ever.

Now coming to food, herez what we ordered

- Laksa --- This was a bit of a let down as traditionally Laksa is very thin in consistency and has noodles but what they served was more like Green curry. Thick consistency and green in color. It was good in taste but was not Laksa per say.

- Phad Thai Noodles - Nicely made. Had that slight tanginess which gives it the unique flavour.

- Yangchow Fried Rice - Good

- Long Island Iced Tea - Well made

Overall a good place for enjoying authentic Asian cuisine. A tad heavy on pocket but worth it.

If you're looking for a cheap and great place, this isn't what you're searching for. So keep looking. If not, then keep reading.
A friend decided to give us a treat and so, the three of us decided on a much awaited visit to Mamagoto. The place is quite easy to find, so finding it wasn't an issue. The great bamboo door read 'Push like a Panda' and we pushed, not sure if it was Panda-like though! We were greeted courteously‚Äã by the staff and was guided to our seat( It was pre-booked online, and I'd suggest you do the same!) We ordered two drinks, Brixton Bash( it had a tangy lime flavour to it, quite delish) and Lychee Martini (a peach pink coloured drink garnished with a rose petal, looked cute and tasted great as well!)
Coming to the entree, we ordered Crystal dumplings. 6 pieces a plate( you can get it in 4 pieces a plate as well). It wasn't that great tasting. Kind of like your average dumpling, nothing extraordinary.
For the main course, we ordered two dishes: Grilled Fish with South Asian dressing and Fiery Thai Shrimp Rice‚Äã. The fish was extremely tender and spicy. It came to us wrapped in bamboo leaves, arranged in a typical Japanese setting. The Fiery Thai Shrimp Rice was good. The rice was marinated in many herbs and spices and shrimp served with thin chicken strips.
And lastly for dessert, we ordered the Home made American style chunky caramel sponge cake served with vanilla ice cream and hot toffee sauce. It was quite delish.
The decor was quirky and what I loved most was this particular wall which had pandas on it. It was oh-so-cute!
The staff was quite friendly and warm.
The only downside would be the pricing I feel. It is overpriced we felt. Also, post taxes and all, the bill rounded up to a hefty amount!
Apart from that, I would visit again in the future.

So this time for a change we decided to get Chinese food delivered at home. So the closest option to try out authentic oriental was mamagoto. The order was taken over the phone I by the restaurant. The executive had good knowledge about the dishes and their taste which helped me decide what to order in the right proportion. So we ordered one portion of chicken fried rice, wan chai midnight chicken which is basically Kung pao chicken and pan fried noodles in Cantonese style chili sauce. Food was quite well prepared and quantity for two diners was just perfect. Now coming to the short comings which are just a few. The crisp noodles that they gave with the pan fried noodles was too little so eventually we ended up having more of the gravy of the dish. Next the gravy of the wan chai midnight chicken was too little to have it with the rice. Though the rice quantity was more than enough for two. Taste wise the dishes were excellent. Definitely would re-order recommend those who haven't tried out mamagoto.

Funky grungy indoors, walls adorned by large scale Japanese and Chinese art...pretty loud contemporary music...a fun-filled, happening atmosphere... commensurate with the food they serve..it is not a place where you can have a quiet dinner..but you can definitely enjoy a sumptuous lip smacking feast.
Chicken pokchoy dumpling, rainbow chicken dumpling and street style spicy dumpling shrimp was our starters paired with fresh lime juice, virgin mojito, cranberry and kaffir lime punch as mocktails and cinnamon whiskey story as the cocktail. The story was powered by Jack Daniels and flavored by cinnamon...great pairing...wish it was less sweet.
Street style dumplings we're the best, fresh prawns coated with funky spices which created explosions in our mouth....
For main course fiery thai shrimp fried rice with Asian green chilli was our choice followed by yanchow champions fried rice and chicken three pepper bomb. Yangchow fried rice was very balanced and generously strewn with lamb, chicken and prawn morsels, very fresh and perfect pairing with the bomb, which incidentally was spicy chicken curry using three different peppers, Chinese wine and hint of sesame oil. The green, black and Szechuan peppercorns rounded up with Chinese wine and sesame seed oil was absolutely wonderful. Thai fried rice bowl was spectacular having a poached eggs on top and crackers, fried chicken and fresh salad adorning the bowl...however, it lacked the expected punch...
However, the overall experience was satisfying...and I intend to go again to saviour the rest of the menu...

We ordered Lotus Stem Crispy Fried ( unique, resemebles flavoured nachos ), dumplings (sauces were unique) and barbeque chicken breast (tastes very good) for starters. 
For Main course, we ordered Spicy Bankok Rice Bowl and Fiery Rice Bowl...The Former had a typical coastal taste while the later tasted pure chinese. The bowls are a full meal in themselves. 
Last but not the least, the show stopper stole the entire show, Spongy Caramel Pastry. It is not as simple as it sounds! Hot Spongy Cake topped with Caramel...accompanied by Vanilla ice cream... topped with Toffee Sauce... It was exotic!!

This outlet serves awesome cocktails too if mocktails are not your thing!

This restaurant opened with fanfare and was the talk of the town. It serves some fusion kind of asian cuisine. We visited for dinner one night to find that tables were already booked and the waiting period for reservation ran into days. However, the Manager on duty allocated a table on short notice when he learnt that I had promised my wife a meal at this haloed restaurant. This gesture will always be remembered. The starters were nice....deep fried lotus stem in particular....the main course options arent many but the rice bowl options were spicy and different. This place is yet to get a liqour permit so they serve alcohol only on specific days. Thr opyions in scotch were few as a full fledged bar was still to function. This place is worth a visit....it wont dissappoint you.

Getting some time off a tiring schedule me and my pal decided to give this place a try as suggested by my other friends.
Reaching the place was easy.
The wooden door at the entrance was a nice touch!
On entering, the ambience was totally different! It was as if we had come into some big restaurant in China! We were lead up the stairs to our table. It was pretty empty being early afternoon.
The decor based on Oriental paintings enhanced the already mesmerizing ambience!

Since it was pretty early in the day w noe ordered Mama's Spicy Ramen Bowl and Sangria (Passion fruit and orange).

Ramen was split into two bowls just like we had ordered. The presentation was excellent! The dish was really delicious and was more than adequate for the two of us. Being the first time with chopsticks added to the excitement! There were plenty of chicken in the ramen and the spiciness was just right!

The Sangria tasted quite good too! It was served along with some fries.

The service was prompt and the staff were very well behaved and efficient!

Kudos to Mamagoto for such an awesome experience! Hope to come back and try new dishes soon!

Well, I love the Pan Asian food this place serves. It's interesting in its own way offering an youthful twist to whatever is served. Had first tried it in Mumbai and I must say I was really excited once I got to know the fact that they opened in Kolkata....!
Been there over a couple of times by now, and I must say have never been disappointed. And the service is attentive. They are happy to help with a smile on their face at all times.
Since we had gone for a light snacks so all we ordered were - Prawns wrapped in Bacon, Spicy Crispy Calamari and Tenderloin in Hoisin Sauce. The bacon was absolutely made to perfection. The tenderloin was something that they asked us to try and I must say, we were not disappointed at all. The tenderloin was delicious. I have probably never tasted something as good as this.
For dessert we ordered their American style Sponge Cake with Toffee Sauce and Vanilla Ice Cream.

First of all located in a very convinient place beside magma complex in park street. We didn't have to wait in a Saturday evening at 8 pm even. We went there viewing some high ratings in Zomato & we havnt been disappointed.  Music was a bit funky but matched the ambience. Staffs are well behaved & suggested some foods even. We took rainbow chicken dumplings & Hot basil chicken cup as starter. Dumplings were mind-boggling but equally disappointing was the other (don't know why this item is highly rated). We ordered Bali barnie noodles chicken along with Wan chai midnight chicken as main course. Very satisfying was both of them. Love to be back again.

After finishing off with the work, all you can think about is food. So, thought of coming here for a quick bite as the evening snack.Well their Shrimps with Dry Red Chili is amazing. Perfectly fried, standard size shrimps, without any layer of cornflour. Loved it! And the Street Satay Chicken with peanut sauce was a grilled dish. The taste was very unusual. When tried with the sauce, it gives a slight flavour of coconut, but if tried without the sauce then it's one of a kind. It leaves a soothing yet strong flavour in the mouth. The ambiance is extremely cool, having a modern yet a country-side touch.
One thing that was sort of a drawback was their tax collection. They charged extra as the service tax including the GST and SGST. Other than that, it's a really cool place to hang out with friends, enjoy the music and have a good time.

The food seems to go a notch up every time I visit this Asian restaurant!
This was my second visit to their Kolkata branch. Previously I have tried out the Delhi ones as well. Nonetheless the staff is always courteous,professional, warm,cordial and ready to provide their suggestions. They have an exhaustive list of Asian fusion food, whether ¬†Thai or Chinese.
It was a weekday and special occasion as I was meeting my childhood friend after a pretty long time! Thankfully there wasn't much of a rush or else it's generally packed on weekends and weekday afternoons.
Our guide for the evening was Mr. Kanai Das. Quite a friendly chap and suggested our meals well enough.¬†
We had Prawn & Celery dumplings as starter coupled with refreshing Cocktails- Green Apple Mojito and Pomegranate Martini.

However I would advise them to do away with the complimentary 'small bites/starter' consisting ¬†those fried papadams. Perhaps something better & innovative can be on offer.

Another point of concern was the cutlery.It was unclean and had grime on it. A huge turn off for any diner. In fact I've faced this issue the 1st time I visited their Kolkata outlet as well. So can the management please take care of it? Mamagoto is tagged as one of the well reputed fine dining restaurants in the country. So displaying unclean cutlery on the table shows lack of hygiene in the kitchen section.

For the mains we ordered - Sliced Chicken in Black Bean Sauce & Mushroom, Stir Fried Pak Choi and Water Chestnut with Bamboo Shoot and Cashew Nuts, Pan fried Noodles.

The quantity was more than enough for 2 people. The taste and quality was amazing to say the least. One word - 'Exquisite'.

All in all a very well spent evening with some good conversation and finger licking food.

I would have liked to rate them with a full score but the cutlery part remains a burning issue.

We went on a Sunday night so we had to wait for 45 mins to get a place. Meanwhile they served us with complimentary drinks which were lip smacking. The ambience is electrifying. We ordered a Hua Hin Highway rolls. Its a must must try. It had the perfect crisp and taste. We ordered Basil cups which was super healthy. It had lettuce as the base and asparagus as the topping. For the main course we ordered Saigon noodle bowl with Udon noodles. It was tasty, just had to be a lil more spicy instead of sweet. We ordered a spicy Bangkok bowl with sticky rice. This is highly recommended. Loved the flavors it had. Perfectly made. We also ordered a Mojito. It was soothing and was very well made. The staff was very courteous and helpful.

A perfect 5!
Went around 10:30pm on a weekend and as expected, it was fully packed. Got a table after half an hour wait, but it was worth it.
A LOT of vegan options.
The tofu was hands down the best one I've ever tasted.
The only problem I encountered was that they cannot make the dishes less spicy even on requests. The salad and starter itself had me crying like a baby.
Both quality and quantity wise, the dishes were perfect.
The ambience too is beautiful, and the staff is courteous and helpful.

Decided to give this place a try after seeing so many positive reviews. Went there on a friday for lunch and as we stepped the place greeted me with pleasing ambiance.
The mocktails are good nothing extraordinary. The food is what what i loved. We had flat noodles with lamb and chicken with star anise. Lovely scrumptious food. The lamb was cooked to perfection and the chicken dish was so flavorful. Loved every bit of it

Real flavors and authenticity at par! This place was on my list for quite some time and the visit was really worth waiting for. The soft music and subtle ambiance just adds on to the flavors of the exquisite Asian delicacies. Had ordered Crispy Lotus Stem as a starter, A Thai Lost in Hunan (Pad Noodles) for the main course and Sponge Cake with Toffee Syrup and Vanilla Ice Cream for dessert. Well, the cherry on the cake was a bowl of Rice Crispers which was on-the-house. Wow! Generally, most of the times one dish satisfies us and the other one brings down the satisfaction with an equal speed. But with this venture, it was only satisfaction and ¬†content. The staff, Mr. Kanai Das, was exceptionally amiable and helped me throughout. So, all in all, this was a visit to be remembered and to be satiated. Hope to see you soon, once again, Mamagoto. And yes, I will definitely remember to push the door like a PANDA!

Fantastic experience! My family and I eat out a lot, but this is the first time I wanted to share how good my experience was! The food we ordered was prawn tempura, chicken dumplings, teriyaki chicken rice bowl, BBQ pork rice bowl and the Chiang mai chicken noodle bowl followed by a sinfully delicious chocolate dessert recommended by our fantastic server Mr. Kanai Das. Every dish was fantastic!! The food was only surpassed by the brilliant service. They was so attentive and well mannered. A Mr. Debraj heard us discussing our love for snow peas and actually brought us a bowlful! The manager Mr. Partha was very helpful as well. All in all a wonderful experience which we look forward to repeating soon!

This place is situated near the barbecue nation at Park Street. The interior is very well decorated. Also the crowd is very nice. Only thing is that the place is not too spacious and the first floor seating area is a little congested. We had hot basil chicken cups as the starter and fiery Thai shrimp fried rice with Asian green chillies and flat noodles with prawn (forgotten the name) as the main course. These are their bowl specialities. The starter was very innovative though I felt it could taste a tad better and the minced chicken quantity could be increased a bit. The noodles tasted better than rice, though both were quite good.
The staff is nice and service is commendable. They also serve fried potato chips with tasty dips and the fun part is that it's complimentary.

Overall a very good experience. Only that we did not get to enjoy the sangria offer due to time crunch.. . A pitcher at 799. Would have been amazing then

My foodie character was being restricted to Indian/Chinese/Continental and of course Bengali cuisine. But my desire to explore more, in Kolkata, brought me to Mamagoto. And I am happy of my choice. The ambience was good, decent service and warm behavior of those who attended us. Now coming to food, I tried to research a bit about it and finalized with Rainbow Chicken Dumpling (healthy one they told), Basil Cup(which I literally had like I have Fuchka!!). The main course was decided by them, and it was Khow Suey (Burmese cuisine). I felt that I need to explore more to develop my taste bud for it, but managed with it. Next came my favorite dessert-home made Chocolate Cake. As it says-Alls well that ends well! Absolutely. Thanks for the experience.

I've visited Mamagoto a number of times, but a place but with food so amazing you need to keep going back. There is enough on offer for vegetarians which ain't very obvious looking at the menu or reading unfamiliar names. Everything we ordered for appetizers & mains was just perfect. The sweet ending was a bit of a let down when your banoffee pie has to much of cream and not much of banana or toffee.

My friend and I went there for lunch. We ordered the summer rolls and laksa, both of which were amazing. The staff is quite friendly as well. However there was an issue with our drinks. We ordered two drinks. I ordered a cranberry mocktail and asked for it to be made a cocktail which was listed in the drinks section as 329/- approx (mocktail into cocktail option). However the bill showed "Bangkok G&T" and when I asked about the prices they claimed since I asked for gin it became a different drink which was 429/-. My issue is not with the price of the drink but with the fact that they did not inform the customer that before serving the drink. The customer has a right to know if they order or the price is changed from what she/he ordered. Besides that we enjoyed the food and the ambience of the restaurant.

MAMAGOTO. This place is located at the prime point of the city, viz. Park Street. Right after stepping in there's a giant green bear and that's the moment I absolutely fell in love with the restaurant. The decor is amazing. Second floor gives proper Japanese vibe. We sat on a table next to the glass window, from where the road can be seen. The tables are hanging from the ceiling! Cool, isn't it? So full marks on the decor.
Coming to the food. Well, it was brilliant. Every item was finger licking. We had rainbow chicken dumplings, spiced asian BBQ chicken breast, Chicken pad thai noodles. Along with white wine.
Oh! They also served us some complimentary chips.
For desserts we had chunky caramel sponge cake served with toffee sauce and vanilla ice-cream and Choco walnut fudge in a cup. And every food item was just on point.

Now finally the service. I kid you not, seriously they are the city's one the places with best service. Very well behaved and soft spoken. Attentive and friendly.

Well, my food journey was great at MAMAGOTO!

Edit : 2nd Oct, 17 - My second visit to this perfectly satisfying food place was great again. This time we ordered Chinese Sour and Pepper Soup (Chicken), Traditional Peking Dumplings (Chicken), Street Chicken Satay, Chicken Tofu Pad Thai. And yet again the taste was on point.

Fellow foodies, if you have not visited this place then visit real soon!

Went on a late Thursday evening and the place was buzzing ! The kitschy cool interiors catch your eye the moment you step in with the giant blue bear in sunglasses greeting you . Front of house service was excellent with the staff being extremely polite and helpful and so were the waiting staff.
In terms of the food, we ordered:
Mocktails Watermelon cooler
Orange and passionfruit cooler
Appetizers Rock shrimp tempura
Asian barbequed chicken breast
Veg Peking dumplings
Entree - Chicken panang curry bowl
Dessert - Caramel spongecake with vanilla
icecream

The shrimp tempura was great with the light airy batter and mayo dip and so were the dumplings.Wish we had more varieties of dumplings.
The bbqed chicken was too dry for my taste and in terms of flavor there was nothing specifically 'asian' or 'spicy' about it if you ignore the bed of sauteed onions on which it is served.Disappointing.
The chicken panang curry bowl was just plain bland and boring with an overwhelming smell of coconut oil which just makes you lose your appetite.Being a peanut based curry you expect it to be mildly spice if not at all but this curry was just tasteless and more so along with the sticky rice with which it was served.A huge let down in terms of Thai food.A lime wedge or two served alongwith the curry would have elevated the dish to new levels just like it is authentically served in Thailand.On this point, the lack of condiments on the table of an eatery that claims to be 'fun Asian' was appalling to say the least! Forget kimchi, they don't even have the basic soya sauce and pickled vegetables . Big thumbs down.
We ordered the popular caramel sponge cake as dessert and the only thing good about it was the scoop of vanilla ice cream it was served with.They should make it a double scoop serving because the cake on its own was too dense and too sweet and doesn't compliment the ice cream well.
The mocktails were great but then again it's hard to mess up basic mocktails.

For two persons the total bill came around 3100 which included 10% service tax.
Overall,Mamagoto is an overhyped and overpriced restaurant where the only thing 'fun' in it being the interiors.Will I ever go back? Maybe...if only I'm in the mood to try out dumplings.

MAMAGOTO - The name itself is self-explanatory; exotic, refreshing, new, authentic Japanese delicacy...what's more to say.

I always envisioned myself roaming around the streets of Osaka, Tokyo, Kyoto while tasting a slice of their inherent cuisine to satisfy my spiritual appetite. And that's what I succeeded post visiting this house of culinary pleasures a couple of days ago....The interior decor is unlike the conventional restaurants that you'd see in a traditional eatery. A mammoth bear fashioned with goggles adorned its eyes surprisingly greeted me, the interior is dimly lit but with occasional sparkles of LED and backlight accoutrements. I ordered the following to a courteous receptionist who promptly acted on my request with no reluctance.

1. Osaka Tube Station Bowl - One of the classics of Japanese ramen noodles complimented with minced chicken, marinated egg and gravy. 
2. Asian spiced BBQ breats - Liked this one, proportionately marinated with correct herbs and spices.
3. Caramel Cake - OK, although after a spicy main course.

Overall, a must recommended for everyone to try out this joint.

Located in the heart of the city along the always busy Park Street area, this place attracts a lot of crowd. So much that the waiting hours can stretch long of you are there over a weekend. We went there for a Sunday dinner only to wait more than 45 mins to get a seat. Now coming to the good part, the staff being as friendly and courteous as they are greeted us with a complimentary drink, a watermelon cooler. We started our dinner with some  pork ribs followed by a bibimbap and some shrimp and chicken ribbon fried rice. The food was excellent and we loved every bit of it. The flavors were absolutely spot on and cooked to perfection. Prices are a little on the higher side but given the quality and quantity leaves very less room for any complaints. We finished off our dinner with a complimentary caramel sponge cake with toffee sauce which gave us the perfect end to a great dinner. Came back satisfied to the fullest and with the hope to go back, hungry for more. Will recommend.

Mamagoto....I do know what it means if it means anything at all but when you name your resturant mamagoto and when you place it in the heart of park street people expect a good dining experience...A great ORIENTAL dining experience...And that's exactly what this place offers.....

The offerings are overwhelming but the waiters are very courteous and helpful... Whenever in doubt do not hesitate to ask these friendly folks..(notice the cheeky limericks on their Ts)....
First time into this place we ordered Mama's Hot Chicken soup for the Hungry soul which was a real delight and we ordered Superhot Mama as starter....Both were well cooked....The portions of the soup were really quite generous....

For the main course we had Bibimbap....It's as exotic as it sounds....Bibimbap is a treat to the eyes and to the culinary senses....Please do try this...When you are there....

For desserts we ordered American style Caramel sponge cake....No complaints..The toffee sauce is really incredible....

One lowlight....The place is too chaotic and noisy for my liking...And the tables are too closely spaced so your privacy takes a hit....

Final verdict : A really nice place for oriental cuisine
....Do notice the psychedelic paintings which they have over the walls....

Going by the ratings this restaurant seemed to be one of the must visit places to tick off the wish list. So we chose this place for a friend's birthday treat. Ambiance is quirky and the place is quite spacious.They have a nice bar counter as well. We tried

Mocktails-

‚Ä¢Cucumber cooler - a thick concoction with slight minty flavor and low on the sweetness quotient.
‚Ä¢Blueberry cooler- high on sugar content with a strong flavor of blueberry, compliments the spicy and tangy flavor of the starters
‚Ä¢Watermelon cooler- subtle flavor of watermelon with basil leaves as add ons this one is a perfect one to start your meal.

Starters
‚Ä¢Hot basil chicken cups - the recommended dish as all the reviews suggest but I found this to be quite ordinary
‚Ä¢Traditional crispy lamb- wonderfully done lamb with proper seasoning and garnishing

Main course
‚Ä¢Yangchow champions fried rice- comes with ingredients of your choice, an okayish one
‚Ä¢Osaka tube station bowl- surprising very tasty and different soupy noodles which came with boiled eggs and sliced chicken portions.
‚Ä¢Crispy Fish fillets- a nice one to pair up the main course dishes with, however the fish fillets had a slight smell.

Food was ordinary, a lot of improvement can be done in terms of enhancing the taste. Service is polite and the staffs have a thorough understanding of the menu which is a big thumbs up as finding dishes to your liking can be quite a tedious task. The quality and quantity of all the dishes were satisfactory but somehow that wow factor was missing. Pricing is a bit on the higher side. Overall a nice place for fulfilling your oriental cravings.

Rainbow chicken dumplings: Good but very bland
Hot basil chicken cups: One of the bests frm the kitchen of Mama.Presentation was innovative
Sesame prawn balls: Unique and yummy
Chicken hakka noodles: Was disappointed with this recipe as it gave out smell of burnt oil.
Chicken with bamboo shoot and schezwan sauce: Could have been better

Garlic is always heart of Chinese industry and when someone can put it in right proportion then it should not disturb the other ingredients taste so mamagoto  impressed us with sinful delights. 
Tried hun hun highway rolls, perfectly perfumed with galangal lemongrass, crispy asparagus, bit of cheese, served with mama Dip with cranberry and Kaffir Lime, perfectly crafted with kaffir lime leaves mixed with lime wedges and cranberry juice.

Must try place if you are in Park street kolkata

Visit mamagoto at least once if you love Chinese. The dimsums are simply mouth watering. I had had the truffle cheese one and it was lovely! Choose your main course dishes wisely. You might not love all of them. If problems arise the staffs are always there to suggest you some of their exquisite dishes according to your palate. The desserts are also adorable.
The pocket pinch is on the higher side. But the food makes up for it.
A long way to go for Mamagoto‚ù§

Mamagoto was long in my wishlist and I finally ticked it off on 19/5/17. If you want to tickle your taste buds with Oriental Asian dishes,then it's definitely your place.
Wonderful interior,and the seat that I got beside the window was just an add on.
Known for their authentic Thai,Chinese dishes,this place is a heaven for food lovers!

Coming to the menu we ordered-
‚óèJava Grilled Fish in Red Hot Sambai Sauce
‚óèOsaka Tubestation Bowl(Chicken)
‚óèChicken Masaman Curry with Sticky Rice
‚óèBanofee Pie

It was a fun Asian dining that totally lifted my mood. Service was prompt and speedy. Staffs were very efficient and decent. Price was a bit on the higher side but every penny was worth it.

So its a rainy afternoon and we enter mamagoto all drenched. Immediately greeted by a giant blue bear wearing shades!! He must've been about 10-12 feet tall and his appearance was endearing to say the least! 
Mamagoto promised to make Asian dining fun and we were ready with growling tummies! To start with we ordered spicy Asian BBQ chicken breast. And boy! It was a wonderful blast of flavors. 
For main course we ordered Bali bamie noodles and lamb with chilli hoisin sauce. The noodles was thankfully not a variant of the same old hakka or schezwan. And tasted yummy! The lamb could have been more succulent but then no complaints as the flavors stood out and making it a showstopper! 
Our server was courteous and friendly. 
The decor also lifted our mood on the rainy afternoon.The upholstery of the sofas deserve special mention for making the Asian feel come alive!
The bar menu looked promising with both unique and classic cocktails.
Shout out to the sumos who were on the windows raising the swag quotient way up.

I have never had such authentic Asian cuisine. The food was beyond par. The proportion of spice, vegetables, Rice's, everything was pitch perfect.
The ambience was off the beat. 
Servers offered us the meals immediately.
They can definitely improve upon the quality of rice chips which they offer as a complimentary.
A must visit for an Asian gourmet.

The restaurant is very nicely designed & decorated. The crockery and cutlery is very soothing to the ambiance . Seating arrangement is again very comfortable and spacious. Good flavors on very good ingredients. Staff behavior is extremely courteous and very warm. Prices are a little on the higher side. But given the fine dining it promises I am sure you will not complaint much. Overall a very nice experience. Will surely recommend.

A one of its kind Pan-Asian eatery located at the heart of the city - Mamagoto became our last resort after running from one restaurant to the other, on a Saturday afternoon; and it was the best decision we could've made. Thankfully we got a table without any reservations. The waiting area downstairs has a lot of beautiful paintings hung around, including a larger than life figurine of a blue bear, which is pretty cool. The area is separated by a flight of stairs leading upto the eating area, well furnished with a bar as well. The dimly lit lights and adequate space between every table made the dining experience a brilliant one. We ordered the Spiced Asian BBQ chicken Breast along with the Rainbow Chicken Dumplings. They were lovely. Right mix of herbs and spices with the chicken well cooked made us crave for more. In addition to this, we were served with prawn chips and a complimentary mocktail as a trial by one of the bartenders. It was a mix of Peach and Watermelon and was absolutely stunning. I wouldn't be surprised if they actually incorporated it into the menu. The staff is well mannered and really courteous which made our stay at the restaurant all the more pleasant. We would definitely come again to try one of the popular rice bowls here. Sure that would taste even better. Thanks for making our day.

Had bookmarked it long back n got a chance to savour their dishes last day. 
Oriental chicken clear soup was decent and yummy. Loved the cute super bowl by the way.
Next we had street style dumpling which was amazing. It's not supposed to be erratic anyhow.
The wonderful green Kiwi mojito was a saviour. Perfect for the season!!
We ended our luncheon with Cantonese pan fried noodles. It was veg but do not underestimate the taste at all.
Loved it!!
Quick service is a plus pointüëç

It is a contemporary restaurant with great interior and the food here is even better. So here are the dishes that we ordered-

Crispy lotus steam   -   it is definitely the show      stopper of the table. Tastes even better if tried with the tango sauce served with it .

Traditional Peking dumpling chicken 6 pcs.  -  it's the best dumping I ever had,perfectly moist and consisted more of chicken than the white coating. JUST PERFECT 

Spiced Asian BBQ chicken breast   -   The chicken was perfectly spiced but lacked in moisture and thus made it a bit hard .

The restaurant provided complimentary wafers with dips. The items that are ordered are provided in adequate quantity for two.

Had dropped over to this place for a late lunch with friends.The decor is minimal and comfortable and has a very upbeat vibe.We chose a table by the glass walls that gave us the nostalgic park street feel.They have an amazing menu of starters which are filling as well as decently priced.We opted for some mocktails as well which were quite nicely made.We had an amazing chocolate cake for dessert which was hugeeee and 4 of us shared.The best part of this place was the staff.They not only helped us with picking the menu but were really courteous and patient.We were a bunch of friends from different parts of the country meeting eachother after a long time and our chitchat post dessert rolled way past their closing time in the afternoon which we realised later.The staff not once told us to vacate inspite of it being their lunch time.They even offered to take a picture for us realising it to be our reunion! It was really a sweet gesture!

Went there for lunch today with a friend. One of the best dining experiences I have had. Everything- the food, ambiance, location, and service was perfect. I have nothing to complain about. 

The location of this place is great. Located on the main Park Street near Magma building. Very easy to spot and you must have seen it while passing by as well. 

Coming to the ambiance, loved it. When you enter, there's a waiting area downstairs and the eating area is upstairs. The waiting area has also been done up very nicely with paintings on the walls, colourful chairs, and a huge, larger than life cute blue figure of some animal. Upstairs, the seating area is very nicely done. There's an open kitchen. We took a table by the window because I love sitting by the window especially during the day with the natural light coming in. There were other seats which were slightly more private as well. Good music was playing and it's a very colourful, cheerful place. :) 

Coming to the service, it's top notch. Our server came multiple times to serve our food as and when our servings got over. They are extremely polite. Asked us if anything was amiss in the food. They were attentive without being annoying or interfering! 

Now, the food. We ordered a Crispy Lotus Stem, Lemon Iced Tea, and Udon Stir Fried Chicken Noodles Bowl. Loved each and every item. They give complimentary rice crackers in the beginning with two kinds of sauces. Those two sauces were mind blowing! The Lotus Stem dish was very differently flavoured and yum! Wasn't expecting it to be that good. It's fried so slightly unhealthy. ;P The quantity is also quite a lot. The noodles bowl was also delicious. We asked them to not make it very spicy and they complied with it. It was not very spicy and the quantity is quite a lot. It says it serves 2 but, I believe, it can easily serve 3 people. The two of us managed to finish almost the entire thing though because it was too good! The lemon iced tea was as it should be. :)

It was a great dining experience. Thank you, Mamagoto!

I have heard a lot about this place which has come up in Park Street from a friend of mine. I went there on a Friday evening with my family and extended family a total number of 9 heads. They have valet parking which is a big concern for dining in Park Street on a Friday or weekends. We were told there there will be a waiting time for 45mins to 1 hour and when we agreed to wait we were again told that it would be max 20 mins. We got the table in 10mins :)

They have a small waiting area with a reception for take-away and receiving guests. There is huge green Bear with Shades standing by the reception to welcome the guests which the kids will surely love. The waiting area is dimly lit with walls decorated with lights.

The dining area is in the first floor. The first thing you will notice is the bar decorated in red walls.

The entire area has been decorated with Asian wall paintings and hangings and also images Japanese Sumo wrestlers. The ambience is perfect given this joint boasts of South East Asian Street foods and main course menu.

Cranberry and Kaffir Lime Punch¬†
Hot Basil Chicken Cups - finely chopped chickens prepared with many spices served in lettuce cups. This was too good.
Prawn Wrapped in Bacon - prawns marinated in sesame and Japanese spices. the prawn is wrapped in bacon and if you dont have any problem with bacon this is delicious.
Oriental Clear Chicken Soup (served with garlic, pak choi and snow peas) - This was okay. I mean just the way it should be..you know you have to order some common dishes when you are with family ;)
Mekong Boat Chicken Curry - This is from the Hawkers Hall Menu, Peanut scented curry with sliced chicken and served with rice noodle nests.¬†
Crispy fish fillet - fish fillet tossed in black pepper sauce - this was also too good..
Chicken with Bamboo shoot and Schewan Sauce (schezwan, pepper, ginger, dried red chillies and spring onions in a light gravy) - Basically Bamboo chicken in a refined way ;) I am sure you will love it.
Egg Fried Rice - This was also okay.
Chicken Fried Rice - This too...
Yangchow Champions Fried Rice - Chinese Fried Rice with Chicken, Pork and Shrimp.
Virgin Mojito

My non-veg starter was pretty good but since my parents are veg I ordered veg tofu and chili potato for them. When the tofu came we asked him if it was chicken, said no, we asked if it veg, he said yes but it turned to be chicken. It was father's day, I wanted to treat him something special but Alas. After that instead of chili potato, they have some fried potato which looked red not at all like the usual chili potato. We had to leave the restaurant because of our gloomy mood :(

Mamagoto is known for its fun Asian dining, as the name literally suggests. They have gained popularity for coming up with authentic Chinese, Thai and Asian cuisines wrapped in all their deliciousness.

Ambiance is very nice, calm and soothing, with a fun and quirky decor of Japanese sumo wrestlers and Asian art on walls to match the vibe of the interior. The huge green but friendly bear (not real though) wearing shades and warmly welcoming visitors is an instant eye-catcher.

We ordered Chinese Sour and Pepper Soup, Hakka Noodles (veg) and Stir Fried Chicken with Thai Flavours and Spices. We also received complimentary snacks and chopsticks. 

Soup and noodles were good; latter tasted well added with table vinegar and sauce. The chicken was the piece de resistance, totally flavoursome and too scrumptious to leave even a single morsel uneaten!


Service and hospitality are excellent and praiseworthy, speedy and prompt. Right from being welcomed to being seated at our choice of table (we took the corner one which offered a soothing view of Park Street below) to the server who jovially informed us that he'd be taking care of our needs for the day, everything was top notch perfect. üëç

Prices of food are a bit on the higher side but compared to the awesome tastes of the food they're worth it.

For Asian and Chinese food lovers, this cool upscale restaurant is a must try!

I had gone for dinner. The ambience and decor is amazing. We had the cheese and truffle dumplings which were good. We ordered a terayki rice bowl which had sticky rice, mushrooms, tofu which was not good and had a strand of hair. We ordered a toffee and a caramel brownie which wasn't good.

I would want to mention that during my last visit, I was ill but wanted to eat out. I ate their Chinese soup and jacket potato. They made it exactly as we wanted it to be. The staff were so cooperative that they kept a constant check on our table and kept asking us if the food was upto the mark taste wise and health wise. It was really touching and sweet of them !!

The interior of this place is very cute specially the chairs . The foods are amazing.. We ordered starters as we were in the mood of trying out starters that night.. so this review is based on only the starters.
We ordered hot chicken basil cup, grilled fish in Asian dressing and Asian BBQ chicken along with two mocktails. Each items were excellent. Specifically the BBQ chicken.. it's spicy and juicy. A perfect one for Bangal like me.
PS no photo of BBQ chicken because we were so much into eating that we forget to click .

And here I was wandering about the greatest corner of the world, Park Street, wondering where my existentialist pang would direct me to. And quite responsibly did it push me in front of a new door. Mamagoto. Led upstairs, the ambience was the first thing that striked. Retro and chic, the warehouse concept has always been a winner. But Mamagoto, did not leave it just to its plush interiors. The restaurant spewed deliciousness. Literally. And it spewed to such an extent that it was near impossible for me to pick favourites. 
Mamagoto is about savouring what's in front of you. The food tastes ethereal especially if it comes in big bowls. The serve is big, brawny and immaculately presented. The service top notch. 
The restaurant offers a tsunami of options and missing out on any one of them would be sheer injustice. 
So the next time you are wandering in Park Street, wondering, like I did. Let your instincts lead you to one of the finest Asian fusion joints in the city.
Mamagoto.

Mamagoto is easy to locate as it is located just beside the Magma building. A new restaurant in an area like Park Street where you can plan a grand lunch or dinner with your family or friends. Loved the ambiance very much and the hospitality received from the service-providers deserve a thumbs up. I went there with one of my friends for dinner and we had ordered beer (heineken) alongwith which a complementary snacks was served. Coming to food we wanted to try some exquisite dishes so we had korean lamb bulgogi and mama's chicken dumplins. From desserts we tried chunky caramel sponge-cake. All the dishes were amazing with an authentic taste. Had a great time there. :)

Full marks for the ambience and decor of this place. Plus good music. To top it off, the service staff is very good. The place is pretty well managed and you can sit here for hours with your food. 
Now coming to the food, I had expected it to be better after all that I had heard. We had the street styled chicken dumpling, chicken wings and barbecue chicken. All of them were decent in taste, but going by the name, they can improve. The drinks menu is slightly limited. Looking to go back again sometime..

Mamagoto is an Asian restaurant in park street that serves food from all around oriental Asia. They had noodle and rice bowls, dumplings, some Japanese delicacies and really good desserts. I tried the Bira beer which is a form of white beer. It tasted good and had the sourness of orange. For starters we had the street style chicken dumplings , the bbq chicken breast and the chicken satay. Each table has a complementary serving of rice crips with a sweet sauce and a chilli paste to go with. They all were good. The dumplings were soft and cooked well and the filling was adequate. They served it with chili sauce which was amazing and chillies in oil which had a peculiar taste to it. It went well with the dumplings. The BBQ chicken breast was cooked well , having the Korean BBQ flavours with saut√©ed bell peppers and onions. The meat was tender and seasoned well. The chicken skewers was what I liked the most , they had the perfect taste of a Bangkok chicken satay and was served with peanut sauce which was basically peanut butter with coconut. The dip was really good. 
For main course we had the prawn laksa, the chicken laksa and mama's chicken bowl. The laksa was very creamy and delicious owing to the coconut milk in it  , perfect in flavour and quantity. The meat was cooked well and the noodle quantity was good. The chicken bowl was basically chicken broth with soy and glass noodles and was served with three fried wontons. 
Mamagoto 's interiors are sober and pretty. The chairs , tables , cutlery all really go with the theme of the restaurant. Our server was very friendly  and looked after us well. This restaurant is a bit on the higher side , prices wise , but has good ambience and good food. It is definitely a place for fine dining.

Visits on a sunny afternoon with a friend , who is equally crazy for South Asian flavors as me. The decor was pretty impressive, reflective of the streets of Thailand. The menu was quite overwhelming to be frank,but somehow we figured our way and ordered BBQ style fried pork, pot stickers served with a light sweet soya dressing, a mojito and a vodka based cocktail. The food was delicious though we didn't like the complementary chips served by them. 
I have visited their outlet in Bangalore before and enjoyed the food on both visits. Since the menu is more tempting than our tummies could hold at one go, I'm definitely planning for a second visit.

Well, after Bangalore‚Äôs Mamagoto experience, I was thrilled to find the chain in Kolkata. What a great decision! Thanks Mama, for setting foot in my City of Joy üôÇ. The interior was a typical Mamagoto one, with red backgrounds and Asian face pictures all across the dining area. The staff members were decently trained and were very helpful in customizing out dishes. I had booked this place via Dineout, so I had received 3 free mocktails. Since I had visited this place on the occasion of my mom‚Äôs birthday, I had raised a special request for a small cake, which after reaching the restaurant, I had agreed for a small pastry (after talking to a female staff). But that was not something that could be arranged by them; though I was disappointed at this failure, I wasn‚Äôt completely unhappy as Debraj had made sure our food was delicious.

I had read a few reviews about the service not being up to the mark. Vary of the same, two of us had gone for dinner. We ordered the Hot Basil Chicken cups first. They were refreshing and really tasty. Then as suggested (it would be less spicy), we ordered the spicy Bangkok bowl. My friend could not eat a second bite of the same, as it was too spicy for her (I was fine with it). The manager there had a separate bowl made for my friend (less spicy, as per her liking). The dish was good as well. They didn't even charge us for the extra dish and gave us a dessert complimentary on top of that (which was finger licking good). I don't usually write reviews. But this effort was commendable and worth mentioning.

Interesting ambiance with friendly staff and exotic cuisine.
Had chicken wings (which had a coconut flavor), Teriyaki lamb in a bowl, and wok tossed tenderloin. All the items were tasty the quantity is decent.Pocket pinch: 800-900 per head.¬†
Only drawback is that taxes are quite high in this place. They should look into this matter.

First time at Mamagoto .. had always thot of visiting this place ... expected alot more than what it gave out this evening ... Got a table for two in approx 10 mins which was pretty good ... The person and  lady at the desk was sweet ... She had even come running up to take our number that she missed out while taking details.... 
When headed up the place was noisy and CRAMPED UP. 
While waiting for a table to get relayed We Asked the bartended for beer ...He  said he only had Heineken  but there was no option for beer in the menu.. Strange!! When asked the server about the pricing n all .. he was completely confused ..  he had no idea as to what was available... He came back sayin it was for 460.. when asked about if it included tax or not ... He looked absolutely blank as if he never heard about anything as such ... DISAPPOINTED!  Called for a sever several times... No response.. one of them looked in to my eye n walked across to get drinks for some other table ... When he decided to leave they happily gave the table to someone els ... 
Pathetic service Annoying servers unattentive stewards... Management needs to work more on their staffs ... 
Expected Much more from this place ... 
Never suggesting this place to anyone ..

Impressive. We tried the Thai phuchka bites from the Hawker's Hall Summer Menu. Betel leaves and peanut sauce in phuchka makes for very unique flavors. For the main course, we got the Teriyaki meal rice bowl and the wok tossed lamb in chili and hoisin sauce with steamed rice. Both definitely worth a shot. Sticky rice with mango happens to be my favorite dessert and Mamagoto did not let me down. Going back again soon for more of their signature noodle and rice bowls.

Be sure to reach early, else you will have to wait. Good portions are reasonably good. Prices are high, so go in bigger groups. Cocktails are good. The Momo   could be better. The names of the dishes are hard to remember. Service is prompt. Waiters are helpful too. Go ahead and have a good time. On an average 1000/- per head.

Another fine dine place with exotic cuisine. Loved the food , the ambience, friendly staff, service. I tried their rice pancake with shrimp and chicken filling, Thai fried vegetables, hua hin highway rolls, and old school gyoza(contained more soy sauce than required) rest were good. They served some fried rice chips with dips as complimentary appetizer. Great place to have exotic food and a great hang out. Must try .

Great for friends and family. Traditional Japanese meets anime pop art vibe atmosphere and really friendly service personnel. The Thai lost in Hunan is definitely a must have, think: deconstructed asian lamb lasagna üòçüòçüòç

Mamagoto has been my all time favourite, used to love one at Sec 29, Gurgaon. This one is at Park Street Kolkata, young ambiance, very helpful staff. Manager was very attentive towards all, we ordered bowl meal, chicken, tangy as per taste. Great place for lunch....

The one thing I would like to mention first about this place is its ambience. Mamagoto scores good in decor and lighting.
The food is quite authentic with exquisite Thai/Asian cuisines. We had Street Style Spicy Dumblings, Mama's Spicy Ramen Noodles,  Chicken Goreng and Chicken Teriyaki. All of them were tasty and we had requested to add a little bit of spicy flavour to each of them.
But one item that deserves special mention is the complimentary Rice Crisps with various sauces. I thought it would be bland but when dipped in those sauces, it made me slip into a heavenly feeling.
Overall, it is a good place to hang out with friends and have some awesome memories.

A pan-asian cuisine at park Street sure to satisfy your taste-bud. The place is little congested but worth the money. Must try if you like pan-asian cuisine. We ordered street style spicy dumplings- very soft melts in your mouth, hot basil chicken cups- minced chicken over cabbage leaves , Hawker's noodles( pad Thai chicken noodles).

One place that I absolutely love for oriental cuisine. Friendly staff and ambiance, though I cant wrap my head around those gigantic ugly blue bears.
The waterchestnut springrolls with a hint of lemon grass and the black bean jam is just amazing.
Must try- Masaman curry with steam rice. Traditional Peking Dumplings

Downer - the lotus stem appetizer

A nice warm place to snack in especially on a rainy evening as last night. Everything from the decor , ambience to the food was really warm and fulfilling. We took the couch beside the window on the far left end on the 1st floor. To begin with they gave us complimentary rice crispies and sauce. Then We ordered 'superhot mama'- silken fish covered in sauce and basil leaves. Next was 'Mamagoto chicken broth for the hungry soul' which was simple fresh chicken broth with glass noodles (vermicelli noodles) and pieces of chicken/mushroom/broccoli..perfectly good to sip on to in a rainy evening. What made all of it interesting is that they give chopsticks too and how I learned to use them with lots of trial and failüòù. For drinks we had the yummy passion fruit and orange coolant. I am all up for visiting this place once more!

And they did not agree that they have done it till the last minute.the management need to look into this matter asap. Did not expect this from a reputed eatery like this.we expect a revert from the management.

Mamagoto is one of the trendiest places in Kolkata, located at Park Street. Ever since it opened its doors last year, I've been wanting to visit this place! Serving Pan Asian cuisine, Mamagoto as a brand is famous all over India. Finally last week it was time for me to visit Mamagoto! I had been invited to try out their latest inclusion - The Hawker's Hall Menu!

For all those who aren't aware, Hawker's Hall refers to the food which is found in the streets of Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and China. Now Mamagoto brings all this and much more to the city of Kolkata. Can you believe this? All we need to do is pay a visit and order from the Hawker's Hall Menu to try out some of the best of South East Asian Street Food!

This was my first time and I was really excited! The interior is eye-catching with edgy details and quirky d√©cor. I especially loved the seating by the glass wall which overlooked the busy Park Street. This special menu includes a number of Thai, Korean, Indonesian starters and main course.

So let's begin with my appetizing lunch!

MOCKTAILS :

We were served with 3 different types of coolers. The Kiwi and Mint Cooler was refreshing in this summer heat. Next up was the Watermelon Beach which had a tangy taste perfect for the summer! The third drink was my favourite from the afternoon, which was the Blueberry Cooler. This was the best and I loved how the flavoured of blueberry was perfectly balanced.

STARTERS :

Before we were served with the starters, a bowl of crispy Rice Chips was served to us. These chips were served with sweet soya sauce and a red chilli dip. Frankly speaking I was bored of such crispers, but on trying out one, I was amazed! How could such a simple dish taste this amazing?! Honestly, this is a good option for munching till the food arrives!

‚Ä¢ Thai Phuchka Bites - Who ever knew that Phuchka could be prepared in such an innovative way? Apparently this is the Thai take on our very own Phuchka. There were 6 phuchkas served in a plate stuffed with betel leaves, crushed peanuts, sweet ginger sauce, onion, red chillies with a pinch of lime. With the first bite, there an explosion of flavours in my mouth. The phuchkas were super crisp, and I completely fell in love with them.
Price INR 219

‚Ä¢ Aubergine and Okhra Medley - Aubergine and Okhra tempuras were seasoned with coconut cream, peanuts, chilli and tamarind. The dish looked quite appealing and tasted brilliant too. Honestly, I almost devoured one full of this! Loved it.
Price INR 299

‚Ä¢ Superhot Mama Fish - This was a bomb of a dish which consisted of fried fish, topped with a layer of red chilli, basil and garlic paste. The fish was crispy on the outside, and juicy on the inside! Honestly, I loved the texture and the taste of the fish. Please do give this a try when you visit Mamagoto!
Price INR 449

MAIN COURSE :

‚Ä¢ Bibimbap - This is a Korean delicacy where a bowl of sticky rice is topped with seasoned vegetables, chilli pepper paste. It is served with shredded chicken and a fried egg. You need to mix all the contents and create the perfect dish. The presentation of this item was attractive and so was the taste.
Price INR 499 (veg) ; INR 539 (non-veg)

‚Ä¢ Mekong Boat Chicken Curry - This was a beautiful looking dish! Peanut scented chicken curry was served with eight small portions of rice noodle nests. The chicken curry was flavourful and tasted brilliant with the noodle nests. There was an abundance of chicken chunks in the curry which tasted soft and succulent. If you're visiting Mamagoto, this is dish is a must try!
Price INR 429

Finally our food fiesta came to an end and I couldn't breathe! I was actually that stuffed. My overall views on the Hawker's Hall Menu is that, the items included in the menu are interesting and has a lot to offer. If you want to go for a gastronomical ride, Mamagoto is the place for you. My personal favourites from this menu include the Thai Phuchka Bites and Mekong Boat Chicken Curry! I'm looking forward eagerly to my next visit at Mamagoto.

On first impressions the restaurant gives the vibe of a street food stall what with the open kitchen and all. It is a relatively small place and fills up quite quickly.  They have a menu which is permanent and some other additional menus like a secret menu and a street food menu. While some may find it interesting, it may also end up being cumbersome for some. 

We ordered for the Veg Gyoza, Crispy Chilli Potato, Glass Noodle Salad, Chicken Satay, Fried Chicken Wings, Chiang Mai Noodle bowl and Osaka tube Station Noodle Bowl. While I could give or take the Gyoza, the rest of the dishes were very good. Special mention for the Glass Noodle Salad, Fried Chicken Wings and Osaka tube Station Noodle Bowl. These three dishes were amazing. My favourite was the Osaka bowl. I generally prefer spicy food but this was absolutely flavorsome inspite of being non spicy. I loved it. 

We all wanted to try out the desserts as well so we asked for the house made chocolate cake and caramel cake. The chocolate cake was amazing but the Caramel cake was out of the world. It was so good that we could not resist repeat ordering it. I have never had better.

I had bookmarked this place from a long time on Zomato as i got great reviews from my peeps in Delhi & Mumbai. Last night I went there with my friends for dinner & I must say I was very disappointed. We had ordered for Pork Ribs & Chicken dumplings for starters and Chicken pan fried noodles for main course. The price for 6 pc pork ribs is Rs 1629 and it was horrible, overcooked, hard & burnt. We even complained about the same. The dumpling was good. But again, the pan fried noodles was hard & not worth the price. On top of this the AC was also not working properly. The only good thing about this place is their service, very fast & cooperative. Overall, I will not recommend this place to anyone. Mumbai & Delhi Mamagoto is much much better!

The choices are a blessing for food connoisseur as it's a mix of non-conventional and conventional delicacies! Weekends can make you wait at the lobby so the best thing would be to call up and book a table!

The city of joy gets its yet another Thai Asian cuisine restaurant. Mamagoto seemed to be a cool new restaurant with really good food. However the price range is a bit on the higher side.It is located at park street after the flurys crossing.Visited the place couple of time and among the variety of menu give a try to the watermelon mocktail and the lamb noodle bowl.

It was a long time since I had been planning on visiting Mamagoto, but for some reason or the other it had not happened till today. With semester exams having ended the day before, a group of 7 decided to have lunch at the place which is one of the few restaurants to serve oriental cuisine in Kolkata.¬†

You know that you have chose the correct place to have lunch when Sumos and Pandas welcome you with a 'Eat like a Panda' board.¬†Though the waiting place, which is perhaps a bit small, does not give a great impression of the restaurant at first, the dining place at the first floor is surely going to sweep you of your feet with its decor almost similar to that of any oriental joint.

We went with the following orders:

Starters:

Bophut Village Hot Chicken Wings : We ordered two of these which was easily shared between 4 people as each plate had 8 wings. The oriental spices in which the wings were cooked made it very delicious. The dip given alongside turned out to be a dissapointment though.

Main Course:

Teriyaki meal in a bowl (Lamb) : The wok tossed sticky rice along with broccoli, lamb and other spices was pretty nice and serves two. The rice seemed to be a bit smoky than the usual at times. The flavour of coconut also did not help. But in all, this was something I was totally pleased with.

Tenderloin with Bamboo shoots in Schezwan sauce : This was a total disappointment as it was totally bland and the flavours were like any other normal curry that is cooked in Indian homes or restaurants.

Lamb with Chilli Hoisin and Hoisin Sauce : This was the best dish of what we had ordered. The gravy tasted absolutely delicious and the lamb was soft and yummy. Taken along with plain sticky rice, every bit of it made me go into a pure state of bliss.

Stir Fried Chicken with Thai Flavours and Thai Sauce: Having never tasted any thai food before, I was pretty sceptic about how this would turn out to be. However the thai sauce and the thai spices came out to be very pleasing to my palate. With a light tinge of lemon flavour in the dish, the taste was something that I had never experienced before. Trying out new things is always fun, and this did not disappoint me at all.

Despite being a dessert lover, we did not order desserts as we were totally full and could not take in anything more.

The service was excellent and the prices were pretty much low than what we had expected. The amount of food that is being served is also very satisfactory. The restaurant totally deserves the high rating and all the appreciation being thrown its way. Totally RECOMMENDED if you are looking forward to good oriental food. Restaurant serving original oriental cuisine are very few in Kolkata, and Mamagoto is surely among the best(s) in the city.

Surprisingly in all these years I've never been to their branch in B'lore. But I ended up going to their branch here, in the City of Joy. And my oh my, was the food good!? I loved EVERYTHING we ordered. From the Raw Papaya Salad to the Grilled Sweet Potato with Asparagus and all the way to the Caramel Sponge Cake, everything was great. Best of all, they even had the glazed aubergine which I once had in the Japanese restaurant, Okko in Dubai and it became my favourite dish of ALL-TIME!. Of course it wasn't as good, but it was good enough!

The decor is striking, bold and catches the eye. There's large swathes of primary colors - which go well with the lights. A number of restaurants are working hard to create an ambience - Mamagoto does it well too. The one thing I noticed at Bodega (as well as here) is that one needs to walk up a flight of stairs to the eating area. Restaurants should ideally mention this somewhere. It is not unusual to encounter patrons who will find this challenging and thus will be unpleasantly surprised.

We were here well before the rush hour on a Saturday (Google suggested that peak times start 2000 onward) and so almost had the restaurant to ourselves. We were quickly shown to a nice table overlooking Park St and settled in with the menu. It is a lot of reading - there's much on offer and an almost overwhelming amount of detail to be read through before one puts together a good dinner pairing.

So, here's what we had - Passion Fruit and Orange Cooler; Rice Pancake (Chicken + Shrimp); Prawn and Celery Dumplings; Teriyaki Meal in a Bowl (Beef) and a Coconut Panko Banana for dessert.

The cooler has a slushie-like texture - so you'd have to give it enough time and enjoy. The dumplings were nice but they pale in comparison to the rice pancake - this was crisp, spicy and plated incredibly nicely. Luckily for us, we were informed that the Teriyaki meal was for 2 (and thus we could cancel the other dish) - this isn't obvious from reading the menu, so do ask and get this validated. The dessert was humdrum and the martini glass is certainly the oddest way to serve it. Use a metal spoon in a martini glass and you run the worry of breaking the thin edge - the dessert is probably best served "boat like" or, in a flatter bowl.

Good value for money and excellent service (no need to wait in agony for water refills).

A great place which has good food and music. Staff is cooperative and well trained. We ordered watermelon drink and cranberry & kaffier lime punch. Both were really refreshing for summer. 
In starters we had Spice Asian BBQ chicken breast was good. Had that Bbq smoke taste and the dip on the side. It was spicy & went great with the chicken. Then we went for a chefs after work bowl, was good  for 2. I liked the rice noodles which they serve with it. And in side they make chicken and veggi mix  with bulldog sauce, with sweet and spicy taste. 
We couldn't reach the deserts but loved the over all food and service. 
Will love to visit again. :)

This visit is on recommendation for an authentic Chinese cuisine. Located in one of the most happening and popular area of Park Street in competition with other good restaurants as well. Mamagoto created its own signature here and a bit different in certain ways. From the entrance till the time u get your table it's something different ambiance. Though the place was full but after a wait of 10 minutes got our table. Too many menu cards to make u confuse. From a menu card I selected to have ‚óèRice pancake with shrimps and chicken. It was yummy and prepared very well. Taste and the stuffing were all perfect. But anyhow before we got this served the waiter served us ‚óè Hua Hin Highway rolls. We didn't know which is what and started having our food. Though it was awesome tastewise and One must try this dish. Rolls stuffed with cheese and veggies. 
When the waiter came and told us that by mistake they served something different and we had something different then atleast they should ask whether we are still interested to have that or Not? As we already ordered the main course and completed our starter. Without asking they again bought another starter. It's not professional. You need to know this little formalities before you serve.
For the main course as suggested by the waiter who were serving us we had ‚óè Chicken hakka noodles. Soft noodles perfectly cooked with chicken tender pieces. Along with this had ‚óè Crispy fish fillet in a spicy black bean sauce. Too good. Very delicious and really enjoyed the Fish. Good combination with the noodles. ‚óè Blue berry cooler accompanied us with the foods.
The service was okay. The food quantity and quality was good enough. I liked the ambiance a lot with a good music in the background. Even the whole interior was interesting.

Went for a lunch last week. It was a warm welcome at the ground floor and then we were led to a table on the first floor. The ambiance was very good. We ordered Tom Yum soup which though a bit spicy tasted good. The flavors were subtle enough. For starters we had lotus stem and Thai vegetables. Lotus stem didn't disappoint but Thai vegetable was not upto the mark as it was nothing more than just fried vegetables. The main course included a Thai rice bowl with vegetables which although spicy gets a thumbs up for the overall preparation. Watermelon cooler went well with the food. Only disappointment was the dessert - some banana caramel one which was quite ordinary. Overall a descent experience.

The street dumplings were absolutely mind blowing, had an amazing amazing flavor and taste. Was wondering for a long time recalling that taste. Highly recommended. 
Lastly the Bangkok sticky rice was good. Quantity is decent n quite filling. Warning : it's lil on the spicy side.

Two days before the Valentine's day we visited Mamagoto to have our special lunch. While entering the restaurant I got instantly happy as on the door it was written "Eat like a Panda!"
Remembering this line by heart we were be seated and greeted by their stuffs. Our happiness enhanced more after seeing posters of baby pandas on wall decor and huge sumo icons on windows. We started our course with two refreshing mocktails and Old school Gyoza and grilled fish in Asian dressing. Presentation was superb for each of the dishes and old school Gyoza is definitely one of the finest dumplings I have ever had. The fish was fresh and soft, melting in mouth. For the maincourse we had chicken fried rice and lamb in hoisin sauce. Both dishes provided sparks of a perfect Asian dish, amazing in taste. Almost full we ordered Choco walnut fudge in a cup with ice cream and once again loved the presentation as well as the quality. We absolutely loved our experience at mamagoto only drawback is pocket pinch is on a bit higher side.

Not so satisfied with the food and the service. Food quality is very hyped , not vakue for money. Service was rude. We asked why they are charging way beyond the MRP for water and the way we got the response was surprising. They need to educate themself in hospitality management. Food quality was good but is not align with the price tag.

I'm sorry but I was sadly disappointed by my experience at mamagoto.  After all the hype created by everyone I went there with a couple of friends for lunch on Sunday. We ordered chicken and veg tempura dumplings, which were mixed up by the waiter, so we landed up eating the veg dumplings while my veg friend waited patiently, little to know that he was about to be served chicken. The other starters were quite alright. But exceedingly over priced for the portions. 
I ordered a lemon grass iced tea but sadly got a drink that tasted like nimboo pani with a stick of lemon grass in it. 
The teriaki chicken bowl with sticky rice was OK OK. Chicken with star anise and spinach was tasty but every dish seemed to have big red chillies in it thus giving all the food a rather similar taste.The only thing that was good was the desert. Caramel sponge cake and chocolate cake. Over all I was disappointed, may not be going back in a hurry.

Mamagoto is an Asian restaurant located in near the Park Street crossing. As soon as you enter this place the waiting area is quite small and doesn't give a good feeling at the first instance. Dining area is on the first floor - which is little
Congested. Decor and Interiors are ok not worth the mention. We ordered veg basil cups and hua hin highway rolls for appetisers. Both were delicious - basil cups were quite innovative and that little amount of cheese in the rolls made them awesome. We ordered Singaporean pan fried noodles, regular Hakka nooodles and spicy Bangkok style rice bowl for main course. Rice bowl was super spicy giving a true Thai flavour. Noodles were good too not that great. Service is quick. Staff is courteous.

There is always a long line infront of this joint.so we land up early on a weekend but still had to wait 15 min.
The decor is funky ..music is good but a bit loud.
When it comes to service there are good and bad...frontdesk is rude and inefficient the serving stuff friendly and quick
Food is above average and good in parts..shrimp tempura was good 
So was nasigoreng but other items were okay.
Sauces and dips were interesting.
Potion sizes are good

Mamagoto can be your one favorite destination. The food is extremely good. The service is fast. The ambience is very good. Well behaved staffs. The bangok spicy sticky rice is a must try. Mama special momo dipped in red wine was too good. The bowl menus don't need any sides along them and all are really good. It is very near to marcopolo. And in the opposite lane of flurys. Mamagoto didn't disappoint us.

Sunday lunch could not have been better. A little tired of eating at the same old places have taken a vow to try the new eateries around the town. One at a time. 

Upon check in, was greeted with a waiting time of 30-40 mins. Patience not being a virtue I am blessed with, bit my tongue and decided to wait. Their ground floor area is the waiting lounge with a few tables and chairs for the patrons. Nice touch. Few mins into it, was served half a glass of complimentary ice tea. I am generally half-a-glass-full kinda guy. Another nice touch. It is quite another story that the ice tea did not taste anything like tea, but plain old nimbu-pani with the colour of tea. But so far no complaints. Another observation, they have girls as hostesses. Not very common in Calcutta restaurants. You give your name and mobile number and you get an insta-sms informing you of your position in the queue. My lucky number being 7. Finally got my table in just under 45 mins. 

Since I mostly fly solo, I have placed myself under a voluntary spending limit of 1K. After all there is no reason for not getting a decent meal for that amount. Wasn't particularly excited about the table I got. But then again the place was packed and I decided not to press charges. Given a choice, would like to have the window seating overlooking the somewhat isolated Park Street on a balmy Sunday afternoon. 

A stack of menus was placed on my table by a mild mannered server, who introduced himself as, Sushanto. Opted out of cocktails menu, the tacos menu(yes, you heard that right), the teppanyaki menu. Held onto the main menu. Not sure why are they serving tacos at an Asian restaurant. But then again, its their restaurant. Who am I to pontificate! 

Down to the business of ordering. I must admit my weakness for one-pot-meals. I had made up my mind in favor of The Laksa Tribute. And I am glad I did. Spent a few minutes toying with the idea of ordering an appetiser. Having heard good things about the wok-tossed lotus stems. But then chickened out at the last moment. Instead, got myself a virgin mary infused with wasabi which as it turned out was quite good without inspiring awe. The subtle after-taste of wasabi lent itself quite well. 

Service was prompt. Within about 3 mins of ordering, a complimentary bowl of rice crackers were on the table, served with a sweet n' sour soy based dipping sauce and a sneeze inducing very potent red-chilli paste. Hallelujah, so far. The steaming hot Laksa Bowl w/chicken (portion size large enough for two people) followed in less than 5 mins. I like my food hot, so this was right up my alley. It was accompanied by finely chopped birds-eye chillies. I speak nothing but the truth, so help me God. The Laksa teleported me to food heaven. It was a beautiful embodiment of flavours, with the freshest lemon grass, I have had in a while. It was amongst the most delicately balanced one-pot-meal, I have ever tasted. And I have had them all. Half way into it, I realised I am getting old, cannot handle as much food with near as much gumption as I used to. However as it always does, greed got the better of me and slowly but surely I devoured the entire bowl, leaving only a little for my alter ego. 

Politely denied the offer for dessert and asked for the check instead. Total damage 925 chips which included a built-in 10% well deserved, service charge. All in all a lovely Sunday luncheon, with myself for company. I shall return with vengeance, albeit, this time with my food loving kids!

On the auspicious occasion of Bengali New year 1424, we had a scrumputious dinner at Mamagoto. The ambience is pretty cool. Staffs are very courteous.
Now coming to the food, all foods that we ordered were just lip smacking, specially I would recommend you all to try the Spicy Bangkok Bowl and BBQ chicken breast.

This review comes in pretty late, since I had been there in February on my visit to Kolkata. Had heard so much about the place that it was an instant "yes" from me when my friends suggested Mamagoto for lunch! I am yet to visit the Indiranagar outlet out here in Bangalore, though I keep on "intending" to go there... (husband is not that fond of Chinese/South East Asian cuisine) so I have to save my noodle hankerings for Kolkata!Anyway, coming back to the point...We went on a Saturday, and the place was teeming (always a good sign in my opinion!) and it took us forever to get a table - however, the wait was sweetened by the complimentary ice tea we were offered (in super cute glasses I might add!). We were asked to wait downstairs for about half an hour (or was it more?) however the decor kept us busy! We loved everything about the kitschy and quirky panda decor and the bright, almost comic book-like color scheme! So utterly in love with the cherry blossom prints too!
We finally got to move upstairs - up a funny staircase - into a sunlit room with huge windows facing the Park Street scene outside - perfect! We threaded our way in through countless girl groups catching up for lunch, coochie-cooing couples, work buddies, et al... Luckily, our group of three got a window table. The tables almost seem to be hanging upside down and the bench-like seating was cool!We loved how the waiter's shirts had different slogans and we felt this added to the fun ambiance! I have to mention the decor again - the windows have huge quirky decals of sumo wrestlers and the chairs are upholstered in beautiful Japanese-type prints!¬†Anyway, on to the food! We started with these amazing crispy lotus stems in a sweet and sour sauce - didn't taste like burnt garlic as mentioned on the menu, but really tasty nevertheless!Next, we had delicious gyoza (which for some reason, the waiter insisted on calling "goyza")! I would have preferred a crisper wrapper, but these were tasty nevertheless.Our drinks also arrived in the mean time - we ordered a watermelon martini, a mojito and some kind of minty drink which came in a jar with (too much) ice! Not bad on the whole - but go easy on the ice fellas, not a pleasant taste when all that ice begins to melt!¬†
For the mains, we ordered the smoky pork belly bowl, which came with an enormous portion of rice, various veggies, a fried egg and 3 amazingly tasty perfectly barbecued pork belly skewers! I am not too fond of sticky rice, but this was pleasantly aromatic and insanely delicious! One of our friends also ordered a masaman curry which was delicious and hit the right flavor spots!
We were too full for dessert but definitely want to come back and try some next time. Overall, very pleasant experience, wholly entertained and completely food coma-ed!

As you walk from alfred park towards flurys u will come across grafitti of a japanese sumo on a wall just beside marco polo,to its left is a wooden door that brings u to one of the best asian fusion restaurant in kolkata. Its quite expensive but the food is worth every penny..'to taste something different' should be on mind while visitng this place
Mamagoto is the mecca for foodies who love oriental cuisine..right from traditional japanese ramen dishes to tak-kohs(a fusion btwn asian and mexican)..this place provides an exhausting menu to choose from.
The decor is very good with walls having colorful wallpapers..and the kitchen can be seen from the seating area(makes the wait much more unbearableüòú) the seating is comfortable
Coming to the food we ordered
1. Rice chips with sweet soya sauce and red chilli paste (COMPLEMENTARY) its crispy nd light and munching on them you can easily kill time while they prepare your order
2. Indonesian curry on rice in lotus leaf (ps-though the food is served wrapped in banana leavesüòë)
The presentation was very nice and the AROMA!!(heavenly) U will fall in love with the aroma and it lasts right from the moment you unwrap the leaf to when u take ur last serving..it was very delicious and is highly recommended
3. Watermelon vodka martini-for me its the BEST concoction to fight this sweltering and humid calcutta summer..the light watermelon juice and the kick of vodka make for a perfect combination with a flavour of mint.
A second visit is definitely on the cards..a longer list of photos to follow..and yeah guys the way the bill was served was very unique xtra points for it..
U r really a strong sumo in the asian cuisine market!!

Do not go if you are less than 4 in a group. They have a policy of not entertaining less then 4 even if the place is half empty. Insulting to say the least. Peculiar to their Kolkata outlet. Would have gladly given negative ratings if there was a provision for that on zomato.

Had a nice evening meal in a much talked about park street thai restaurant called MAMAGOTO. Good place. Very warm and welcoming staffs. Menu looked nice and ordered Chicken Masaman Curry & a portion of sticky rice. Food took time to come but finally when it came it was simply awesome. The chicken dish was huge in quantity and great in taste. Must visit.

Park Street is a hub for legendary culinary experiences no doubt, but some of the more recent additions don't fail to impress either. My experience in Mamagoto was a rather pleasant one, seeing that I have become rather wary of oriental food in the recent past. The menu in Mamagoto is quite comprehensive, but they have added these nice legends to help out people looking through it. 
We started of with a healthy option of Hot Basil Chicken cups which were quite nice. Also momos(forgot the name) , which were different in a way that they were green in color (though quite good). We restricted our main course to chicken and it was quite delicious as well: Wan Chai Midnight chicken and London' China Town chicken. We paired it off with Bali Bamie noodles which was really good as well. The salad was a surprise however. We ordered it in great trepidation and at first the Silky Wilky tofu salad(yes the name's right) looked bland, it was actually a melange of flavors and had a zesty taste to it. The LIIT here is not too bad either. 
The staff is very courteous and you get valet parking as well. It's overall a great place to lunch/dinner bit beware it gets crowded, so better to reserve otherwise you might have to wait for a table.

Simply put my experience at Mamagoto left me with mixed feelings. Having heard good things about this new kids from my friends I had been waiting to lay my lands on the goodies here. On my visit here, I found d place to be a bit claustrophobic since the tables were just cramped too close to each other. The other thing I didn't like about the ambience was that the natural light was mostly restricted to just 1-2 tables by the window. 

Having said that the food was quite ok with good sized portions. We ordered water chestnut spring rolls, street style spicy dumpling, spicy Bangkok bowl. I absolutely loved the caramel sponge cake with toffee sauce!!

I do not like places where you have to stand in a queue. However, Mamagoto justified why there was a queue.
Located at Park street near Marco Polo, this place serves quality food.
Hot Basil chicken cups ¬†followed by the Laksa tribute - I loved it. However, the dish of Lamb in Hoisin sauce was my pick of the day.

Food - 4.

This place is a treat for all in the Park Street area. For much of a decade some restaurants have enjoyed huge fan fares but this sure is a challenger ! A great place to come with awesome ambiance. We had vegetable fried rice, pan fried noodles with Singapore style sauce, crispy chilly potato and noodles. All of the about items were a treat to have. The vegetable fried rice was a bit on the lighter side but other than that everything else was just wow. A special mention, we had a small problem with a dish but the management was so kind to remove that as a part of the bill. A great place with great customer satisfaction. Do visit.

I am disappointed with Zomato for not having a negative rating. Honestly, walking into a restaurant with bad food, rude employees, and horrible service is nothing short of devastating. The deplorable and condescending attitude of the receptionist was heart-wrenching. I sincerely hope that every potential customer keeps this in mind.

After a long arduous morning of shopping in the sun, my friend and I were walking through Park Street wondering where to rest our weary legs and feed our hungry bellies. We landed on Mamagoto. 

The ambience was quirky but nice. The place was PACKED, which got my hopes up. We ordered the Mama's Hungry Soup and chicken satays. They suddenly presented us with complementary rice crackers with 2 kinds of dipping sauces. They were like fried saboodana crackers, so nothing fancy, but  I am always excited at the prospect of free food! Haha
The satays came, they were well seasoned and tasted fine, but again nothing special. Then came the soup. Oh man.. it was this perfect light broth full of fresh veggies and chicken. Nothing was overcooked or mushy. It tasted light, fresh, and perfectly refreshing - just what we needed. Included were 3 crispy chicken gyozas.. yum! 
Will definitely come back again!

Cramped place. My table and the two adjacent tables next to it hardly had 1 feet of distance in between them. The person on an adjacent table managed to hit my knee on 3-4 occasions with his. The ambience was super noisy and irritating. The food was expensive, and plain bad. The noodles tasted like maggi with unnecessary amounts of its taste-maker. I prefer fish over chicken, but I was forced to go for a chicken dish being unable to find any fish dish in the main course. Even that was having a weird smell and didn't taste good. Both the dishes had some long, white streaks of some sort of vegetable which made the whole thing even worse with its repelling taste. I couldn't finish the food. They also add a whopping 10% service charge on top of everything (not just service 'tax', which is mandatory). I'd certainly refrain from paying this place another visit again.

Very good food... Tried the rice bowl which is a meal by itself. The soft tacos are nothing great and abnormally small portions for which you are spending over rs 550 including tax. 
Try the rice and noodles bowls and the dumplings.. 
A great place to eat. Remember they charge service charge of 10% without giving you an option which I think is still a violation of the applicable regulations...

"Enjoy yourself. It's later than you think."
(Chinese proverb)

This is exactly what you should be doing at this Pan Asian fine dining restaurant.

And I have to admit that I enjoyed dining here thoroughly. Here are my thoughts:

1) The decor is edgy, yet somehow eludes warmth and coziness. The entrance says "Push it like a Panda".

2) The complimentary crackers come with an awesome chilly oil dip. They keep you delightfully occupied while your order is being prepared.

3) We ordered 2 mocktails (Passionfruit and Watermelon), Chicken Basil Cup (Nice), A Bowl of Shrimp Udon (Outstanding), and a Bowl of Sticky Rice with Poached Egg, Vegetables and Barbequed Pork Belly, and a very very awesome pork belly sauce (Rice was aromatic, and pork nice juicy and chewy).

4) They have magical dips (and they are happy to give you second helpings).

5) The taste is pretty authentic. The sticky rice bowl I ordered instantly transported me to a rail station in China where I had eaten a few years ago (people who only appreciate indo-chinese may not like the blandness).

6) Service is commendable!

7) Pocket pinch is high (atleast 1200 per person).

8) The loo has de-odoriser!

9) My friend and I wanted to pay separately by card. They arranged for it. So pretty cool.

10) Portion sizes are magnanimous! One bowl meal actually serves 2 moderate eaters.

So be there soon!

Well this new place in town is very conveniently located on the main road of Park Street and can be very easily spotted.. The entire decoration and ambience of the place is very fresh and young.. I would give the staff 10 out of 10 for their quick service, lovely and friendly behaviour.. Well we ordered one chicken and pepper soup which had 21 types of ingredients.. The soup was very flavourful and the consistency was Perfect.. I simply loved it.. We also ordered a starter chicken bar b que and believe me it was a mixer of all the flavours.. It was spicy and hot. Nicely diced in shape of breast piece and place over a bed of sweetened onions.. It was served with a hot and red sauce... Would only recommend this dish for people who can have very spicy and hot food... For the main course we took mamagoto goreng which was their version of nasi goreng... The rice was very mild and tasty and the chicken was beautifully done with peanut sauce... Loved each and every bite.. I enjoyed my Friday dinner and it could not have been better elsewhere..

I had visited this restaurant on my Uncles birthday. We had made a reservation so getting a table wasn't a problem. Though parking is a problem here. 
Coming to the food we ordered chicken skewers satay which comes with a peanut sauce, the chicken wasn't that great though‚Äã I liked the sauce. Next came the prawns wrapped in bacon, honestly I have had better. The prawns were undercooked but the seasoning was done right. We had ordered Mama's Spicy Raman Bowl with chicken, it was ordinary. 
Had great expectations from this place. 
Overall the service was good but the food was a disappointment and I feel the place is hyped.  It's ok for a one time visit.

Location: Plot beside Marco Polo restaurant

Menu: An all oriental cuisine available

Food & Ambiance: We ordered Fried Rice, Honey chicken, and one more side dish and a drink, each one was superb especially the honey chicken. Quantity and quality were both great. I would still wanna get back there for another helping of honey chicken. Ambiance wise its one of the best places I have been to in the recent past, the decor the lighting the MAMA posters on the brickwork walls, all just add up to the USP of this place.

Service & Staff: An efficient and friendly batch of staff and managers, ready to help. Service time is quite quick and everything is served with proper presentation and cleanliness.

Its a new place and is already on the "must visit" list of many and for me its like "waiting to get back"

Had heard a lot about this place. We went on a Sunday evening and waited for over an hour for a place. The ambience and decor is good. Coming to the food, we had the crispy lotus stems and Mama's dumplings. Both were nice, but the dip provided with the Lotus stems should have been thinner so that it could have been easily spread. The papaya salad was a bit spicy for my taste. The silken tofu was amazing, though the server was reluctant to serve it to us. For the main course ordered the Bangkok Bowl, Hakka noodles, teriyaki rice bowl and udon noodles. Absolutely loved the udon noodles. The other bowls were good too. 
A nice place, but waiting time is too long.

Visited on a Sunday with family. When we arrived the hostesses informed us that they have a huge rush. Then they told us we'll have to wait for 30-35 minutes. When we were about to leave, they told us that they can accommodate us.
On going upstairs we found half the tables empty. I found this whole act a little stupid.
The ambience is nice, and the staff is courteous. We ordered the cheese dumplings and the Huan way roll. Both were quite good. And we ordered noodles in black bean sauce. To accompany it we ordered the  wasabi drink. The wasabi drink was quite mediocre.
Overall I found the place a little hyped, not as good as the reviews.

Oh whatta day it is!Splendid!Splurge yourself just opposite to Park St post office,at Mamagoto.
Ambience,food,portion,taste,innovativeness,presentation,service- just name it and they would nail it for you!I couldn't find a single flaw (not that I wanted to :P)

Ambience- Nice.Though I didn't find it extraordinary like the other Zomato reviewers.

Orders-Rock shrimp tempura, Asian bbqed chicken breast,spicy Bangkok bowl,spicy udon noodles prawn,Caramel Sponge Cake and green apple sangria,orange passion fruit sangria,watermelon vodka.

Rock shrimp tempura: was served hot with a pinch of red chilly powder spread above. The prawns were so delectable and plenty. A bit of sweet mayo dip accompanied it. This dish is highly recommended.

Asian barbecued chicken breasts- just perfect for 3 of us in portion. Tastes close to boneless chicken tandoori.Spicy and each of the spices can be identified individually.Don't miss the onions and bellpeppers that come along.

Spicy Bangkok bowl- A bowl of hot and spicy aromatic rice (probably basmati)blent with minced chicken served with an egg,cut in quarters. On our request they replaced the sticky rice with basmati.
It was delicious. Only I found it a li'l salty so I balanced it with a drop of lemon juice.Portion was more than enough for 2.

Spicy udon noodles bowl (prawn)- We,prawn lovers,
were ecstatic about this dish! No complaint about the prawn sizes at all.Prawns were enough for 3 of us.The noodles are spicy flat ones.Loved every bit of the dish.

Caramel sponge cake- We were too gluttony not to order a dessert.And this was a perfect treat to our yearning soul.The caramel is so balanced in sweetness and the cake,a perfect spong bob ;)
This is accompanied by a scoop of vanilla.

Drinks: Coming to the cocktails their menu is anew and innovative. You would be spoilt with choices.I loved the Green Apple Sangria (white wine) amongst the three but all were equally appealing.

Service-Very hospitable staff.All the while they were on their toes. Very prompt service and always wore a smile.The open kitchen isn't noisy at all.

Recommendations- Don't miss their rock shrimp tempura,bangkok bowl,caramel sponge cake & green apple sangria.

Tips- 1 bowl enough for 2 persons,post starters. And don't order any side dishes of chicken/fish/seafood if you go for bowls.

Mamagoto had been on my bucket list for a long time now. I heard so many great things about this place that I went last night with high expectations. 
Firstly let me point out that if you're going, be ready to wait. This place is always full, and for good reason too. The Mamagoto franchise has made its mark in Kolkata, and this outlet is bound to do well. 
The ambience is very good. They have 4 different sections but the seatings are few in each of them, but overall it has plenty of space, yet it's still packed. 
The service was top notch. The staff serving us were courteous, patient (while we kept changing our orders) and hospitable. I would've given this place a 3.5 if it had not been for the service. 
Coming to the food itself. We had ordered Pan fried dumplings and the cheese dumplings. Both were amazing. There were 6 pieces and I felt like I should just fill myself with these starters. For the main course we had pan fried noodles, Bangkok rice and vegetables. While the pan fried noodles was very good, the sour taste of Bangkok rice was not to our taste and the veggies were quite bland. Still overall a nice experience. 
As for the price, I've noticed a peculiar thing. The quantity served is such that when you go in a group of odd numbers (3, 5 etc) your per head cost will be down by about 200, as compared to an even numbered group (2, 4, 6 etc). We were a group of 4 and it cost us 650/head without dessert or drinks. Try going in an odd numbered group. 
Finally, Mamagoto is a must try place for those who like Asian food. Not a regular visit(pocket pinch will burn most) but occasionally it's a place to go to.

Went here with my cousins. Overall a great experience, had lot's of fun, the most commendable fact is the ambience of this place which is very bright and happy. I myself ordered the Spicy Non Veg Bangkok Bowl which was made to perfection and ideally if you eat moderate amounts, then 2 bowls should be shared by 3 people. Had fun. Will visit soon.

Everyone is talking about the new panda in town. So we headed to Mamagoto Park Street one afternoon to check it out. With huge glass mounted giant pandas greeting us, it is impossible to over look Mamagoto. We were led up to the second level and a colourful rustic yet modern decor along with of course pandas greeted us.  With courteous staff, Mamagoto is up there with the fine dining experience. 

Mamagoto literally means playing with food.
And what we got on the plate was an experienced chef who knows exactly how to play with his ingredients.

Traditional Pekin Dumplings:
When you go for fun asian eating, dumplings just have to be there on the course. Each of the dumplings were an explosion of heaven. Each of them have a nice thin covering and the filling a nice,simple blend of spice with the meat. This dumpling tells you why it's the chef's choice in every bite. They are served dunked in a sweet and sour jus and that really raises the bar.

Spicy Asian BBQ Chicken Breast:
The Grilled Chicken Breast is more of an Indian dish rather than an oriental one. A large chicken breast that is cut into small slices and grilled with a little bit of spice and good char on the outside but still soft in the inside. Its served with stir fried veggies  glazed in a sweet soya sauce.They served a bit of a wonderful sauce on the side in case you want to cut down that Indian feeling and give it a really Mama touch.

Sticky Rice with Lamb Masaman Curry:
There is nothing like a good Malaysian curry with sticky rice. The sticky rice was a simple bowl of classic thai sticky rice. Coming to the Masaman curry, it can become the best curry you have ever had. The word Masaman comes from the word "Mussalman" and this dish is a Thai modification of the traditional muslim cuisine. A rich thick curry with a wonderful blend of cumin and other spices, with nice chunks of lamb and little bit of potato in there. The lamb melts as soon as it touches your tongue. Chunky peanuts in the curry adds another dimension to the dish. To enjoy this dish, take some rice on your plate and drench it in curry and have a go at the rice curry mixture with the lamb.

Homemade American Style Chunky Caramel Sponge Cake with Toffee Sauce served warm with Vanilla Ice cream:
It is the best damn sponge cake I have ever had. It was so soft and the toffee sauce was heaven. That was definitely one of the best desserts I have ever had.

Mamagoto was an unforgettable culinary experience. Albeit a bit pricey, but the food and the ambience is definitely worth it.

Cost for two: Rs 2000 - 2500

When you receive a service such warm and an ambience such impactful, you are already half satisfied. Coming to the food, I guess Mamagoto is the next big Pan Asian restaurant in the city. The food quality was incredibly authentic and the quantity was enough. However the taste could definitely be better.

The new Pan-Asian joint in town, Mamagoto serves a wide range of cuisnes from Chinese and Burmese to Thai and Japanese. I had been looking forward to visiting it for a while now and I finally did, one fine Saturday afternoon. It is a small joint, but the Chinese and Japanese artwork is quite alluring.¬†

We ordered Rock Shrimp Tempura, Mama's Spicy Ramen Bowl and Caramel cake. Before these reached the table, we were served a complimentary snack of sago chips with two types of sauce, a sweet and sour one ¬†presumably made of tamarind and jaggery and a hot chilli sambal. It was pretty adequate in quantity but we still mopped it up within minutes, the dips were that good.¬†

The tempura prawns were just as they should be, crunchy on the outside and succulent on the inside. The slightly spicy coating and chill mayo served alongside aren't exactly authentic, but I could care less. The Ramen was a total beast. Fiery red in colour it had a lot of chilli paste making it very hot. However, we kept going back to it, not just because of our love of spice, but because the broth tasted lovely. The dessert comprised a slice of cake served with a caramel sauce and a scoop of vanilla ice-cream. The cake was soft, the ice cream was good, but eh caramel sauce stole the show. With the perfect balance of bitter and sweet, it brought the dessert to life. I wish there was a bit more of it though.

Now coming to some cons. The waiters are not adequately informed about some of the dishes which led to a bit of confusion while ordering. Also, our ramen bowl lacked the wilted spinach which they usually serve, which threw the balance of the dish in terms of colour (there was nothing green on the plate) and flavour (the spinach would have helped to balance out some of the chilli in the dish. The value for money is a bit low and it is likely to burn a hole in your pocket, especially the desserts, but the mains come in huge quantities which makes up for it to a good extent. Recommended for those who like Pan Asian cuisine. I will go back to try out some more of their one bowl meals especailly the Laksa and Pork Belly fried rice.

Went on Valentine's day, but it was full so did not get the chance but made it a point to visit later.Yes, finally enjoyed a wonderful dinner with family. Dumplings being my weakness, tried the rainbow dumplings but felt it could be better. However, what still is fresh in mind is the hot basil chicken cups!! Those were wonderful...Also tried Hawker's noodles that was also tasteful. Chandan was helpful in guiding through the menu.Overall, good ambience and decor.

Heard a lot about the ones in Delhi and Mumbai. Kolkata did not disappoint. Ensure that you get a seat by the window to get a good view of Park Street. The food is fancy and teases your palate for more. Could not try the desserts here, which, many tell me are delectable. This place being close to my residence in Kolkata, I would definitely go there again to try every on the menu. Amazing place to have a nice date. I hope this place does not close down like a few have in Park Street.

Presentation -4.5/5
Food 3/5
Value for money 4/5
  

I and my friend ordered for a rock shrimp tempura and  grilled fish with south east Asian dressing,we loved the tempura but hated the sweetness in the grilled fish, after telling the waiter clearly that we don't like sweet elements in our dishes he suggested this to us,for main course we had fiery thai shrimp fried rice with Asian green chilli chicken with which we had love hate kinda feelings as tge chicken ribbons were pretty dry abd absolutely no juicy taste in it,but the rice was better,along with that we had fish fillet ls which had a  pungent smell so we couldn't have it,and we complained about it so we didn't have to pay for it,they have a good bartender as he was asking me after serving me the cocktail thay what more they should do to improve the taste,and was creative enough!!!! 
Overall for a bit different Asian experience this place is a good option!!!!

Been here a couple of times and have loved the place. Very good food and prompt service. Table reservations are recommended otherwise you could end up waiting for a table. There is scope for improvement in their cocktail varieties and selection. Also beverage selection could be increased as well very limited choices for beer and wine.

We went to mamagoto after reading some pretty impressive reviews. I don't know what decor people are raving about. The decor is nice but it's not something spectacular or something that needs to be mentioned. Anyway, coming to the food, we ordered mama dumplings and the Bangkok rice bowl. The food was good, service was very nice. What was disappointing was that they didn't serve alcohol that day. Some weird alternate day license or something. Overall, good place and worth another visit. The menu is a pain to look at though. Read too much and your head will hurt because it's very confusing and written like the tiles on the walls of metro stations. Slanted.

*Honey Chicken was perfect. Would love to visit for this again and again. 
*Bali Bami Noodles was great. It was served so well and great to the taste buds.

It's been sometime that I'm hearing the buzz about this restaurant and yesterday when I visited the place I realised why. The place with its quirky decor, the warm greetings & food which is totally worth the hole it left in my pocket.
I have nothing to say about the food except the word awesome! The Chunky Caramel Sponge Cake with Toffee Sauce left me ecstatic.
Except for the ambience & the wobbly table I have no complaints whatsoever. They need to work on their music. The comments on the Ts worn by the servers made some interesting read while waiting for the food.

Heard a lot about this place. Located just opposite Park Street Post Office. Went their on this Valentine's day. There was a waiting of 45 min. The interior is superb with cordial staff. I ordered Prawn and celery dumplings. It's a kind of Momo but very different and good taste, but a little over priced @359/- for a plate with 4 pieces. Then we ordered Chicken Tom Yum soup which which tasted really good. One bowl is sufficient for two people. Then for the Main course we ordered Chicken Teriyaki Meal in a Bowl which was really unusual and very good in taste and sufficient for two people's meal. Overall a very good experience with its super ambience and good different Asian cuisine.

This review is pending for a long time. I visited Mamagoto with my sister on 25th December for lunch. The timing was perfect and we got our seats. If we would have been late for some time then would have had to wait for sure.
Started of the with beer and old school gyoza. It was a pan fried chicken dumpling with a soy and red chili dip. The dip complements the dumpling. The squid fry was equally good and had the perfect crunch.
For main course we took udon noodles which were heavenly. One bowl is sufficient for 2 person.
Ordered the famous caramel sponge cake with toffee sauce and vanilla ice cream. A slice costs 299 but it is totally worth it. They gave everyone a fudgy brownie on the house. We were so stuffed but my soul and tummy was so happy.
Pocket pinch is on the high side but can be splurged once in a while. :-)

Authentic Asian food at its best! This is my first visit in Mamagoto, after having heard a lot of about the chain. It didn't disappoint. Went for a Sunday lunch at 2, had to wait 30 minutes for a table. The staff are very friendly and always had a smile. Fine, simple decor and the funky paintings on the wall added to the Oriental look. A pleasant vibe is experienced the moment one puts a foot inside the eatery.

Now the food. We ordered Old school gyoza dumplings, small pieces looked fine and tasted better. Very fine. Next ordered Mamagoto Goreng, was a Bali dish with a brown sticky rice garnished with chicken skewers, egg poach, chips and cucumber & tomato salad. The rice tasted sweet and lil spicy had little chicken pieces all over, is recommended. Next we ordered the Osaka Tube station soupy noodles which had a muted taste of different herbs and is a heaven for the ones looking out for a fatless diet. It came with a floating egg and chicken breasts.

Overall a very gladdenning experience but one cannot ignore the hole this place burns in your pocket. But a little self spoiling can never be too harmful!

Recommendations: Mamagoto goreng, Pad Thai noodles, a thai lost in hunan

After creating quite a stir across India, this Asian restaurant chain is now in Kolkata with their stir fries, dumplings and all that.

Mamagoto restaurants are known for their fun, funky atmosphere and this one is no exception. The vibe may be informal but they are very serious about their food. They serve Asian food with a difference compared to the usual "Indo-Chinese" fare found in the city and they do not shy away from serving pork or tenderloin. The pork belly with sticky rice that I tried was beautifully presented and tasted equally good. They also served some salad with it, which was on the house.

Overall, a welcome addition to the Kolkata food scene.

So today I went to this place for lunch for the first time. I have to say it was a very pleasant experience. The ambience was funky as well as unique. I give them five stars for such a nice collection of music that kept playing in the background ( they played The Game of Thrones title track too). 

We reached at 3 and didn't have to wait for long before we got our table. The entire get up of the restaurant was really cool. 

Now coming to the food. We ordered :

‚Ä¢Sweet corn soup chicken - it's the traditional sweet corn soup but you've got to taste it yourself to realise a slight different flavour that it has got. This slight dash of different flavour only makes the soup even more tasty. I give it 4/5

‚Ä¢Chicken three pepper bomb - it's a chicken gravy dish served in a pepper sauce. Again a very tasty dish and a new flavour . I give it 4/5

‚Ä¢Yangchow champion's fried rice- the fried comes with bags of flavours. What's best about it is it's full of chicken chunks ,prawns, lamb chunks and mushrooms. They serve it with fried onions on top , the crispness of which adds another layer of texture to the dish. I give it 4/5.

‚Ä¢Homemade "American style" chunky caramel sponge cake with toffee sauce served warm with vanilla ice cream - This is the best desert that I've ever had at a fine dining restaurant so far. As the name suggests, the sponge cake is served warm and it's extremely soft. The toffee sauce is poured on top of the cake as well as served along with the dish in a cup. It's lipsmacking tasty. I give it 5/5.

Superb ambience with pandas dancing on your head while you're busy hogging the amazing food here. Love the ambience. The people here are very friendly and co-operative. Quick service. Exceptional food. P.S. I am a vegetarian. 

Large variety and way too many options for vegetarians too which is what impressed me the most. Call for some Bali Bamese Noodles and Corn Fritter Balls to have an amazing oriental experience.. 

Definitely visiting again sometime soon! Cheers.

So me and my two friends went there on a Saturday for lunch. The place was full so we had to wait for about 20 minutes. When our turn came we went upstairs to our table. The ambience of the place was really nice. Being a Thai restaurant, the place clearly had its Thai influences in its decorations. You could see the kitchen and in front of that all the different kinds of rice/noodle bowls.

Now coming to the food, we ordered the following items:

Hot Basil Chicken Cups (‚Çπ329/-)
Stir Fried Udon Noodles (‚Çπ599/-)
Teriyaki Meal in a Bowl Chicken (‚Çπ579/-)
Homemade coconut and palm sugar ice cream (‚Çπ199/-)

We were given chopsticks but being unaccustomed to that, we used convention utensils LOL. The cups were nice, though difficult to pick up without dropping the chicken on top of the lettuce. Teriyaki was a liitle disappointing because the smell of ginger in it was a little too much. The best was the udon. The prawns were the best prawns I have ever eaten in a restaurant. Really recommend it. Also enjoyed the ice cream.

Overall the bill was ‚Çπ2261/-. I agree that it was costly but worth it. It's amazing how this new place has managed to get such nice reviews so quickly.

I jumped with joy to know that mamagoto had come to town! The delicious food, happy ambience, great location (Opp park street post office) make it a favourite place to goto! The food is excellent with enough options for vegetarians and non vegetarians. Since the food menu is well divided into steamed, fried, wok tossed and grilled you can choose good tasty food even if you are on diet!
Veg must try: raw papaya salad, mamas dumplings, chestnuts spring rolls, pad Thai noodles in black bean sauce and the rice rice teriyaki bowl only if you like a sweet smoky flavour. In fact it's quite sweet.

Non veg must try: steamed fish is a clean winner. It's a basa fillet with a lovely sweet chili dressing. For starters do try their prawns wrapped in bacon and their wide choice of dumplings. The pad thai noodles with peanuts and the all time favourite green Thai curry needs a mention

Pls go to mama goto with a very good appetite beacuse a visit is good for the tummy and soul

PS: they were very nice and arranged a lovely eggless birthday cake for us.

Asian cuisine has always been a big weakness of mine. Thus when Mamagoto, the fun Asian dining joint opened its first outlet in Kolkata it immediately made it to the top of my wishlist! Read on for my experience at the big daddy of Asian food. Located near Magma House, Park Street, the place with its quirky d√©cor exudes a fun and cheerful vibe. Considering the fact that we had dropped in for a mid-week dinner, all most all the tables were occupied. So you can easily expect a long waiting on the weekends. ¬†Mama‚Äôs Lamb Kai, a bowl of warm, delicious salad was just perfect to warm us up for the hearty Mama‚Äôs Ramen bowl. With the earthy kafir lime undertones along with the spicy ramen, the food here is a perfect balance of sublime and funk. However, the one dish that will make me visit them again is the Caramel Sponge Cake with Toffee Sauce and Vanilla ice cream.

The ambience of the place is bang on. The live kitchen and chefs uniform reminds you of the authenticity of Asian cooking. We had ordered for the bowl meals. Trust me one bowl meal is good enough for two decent eaters. The quantity for the quality and price of food offered is superb. The Penang Curry Bowl Prawns were generously sized. Taste of the Penang Curry, Nasi Goreng and Terriyaki was mind blowing, craving you for the next bite. The only drawback was the beef in the Terriyaki was slightly Burnt.

Thinking of a Post New Year Diet ???Think again .. MAMAGOTO the ‚ÄòBig Boss‚Äô of Asian Cuisine is finally in Kolkata.¬†. Mamagoto, that in Japanese means ‚Äòto play with food‚Äô is a cheerful restaurant serving authentic and innovative Japanese, Thai and Chinese cuisines in the heart of Park Street. Communication 2.0 organized a Bloggers Meet which allowed me to engulf myself in an afternoon of one the best Asian Food the city has to offer.

An amazing experience !I went there a couple of months back. The ambience of the place just made me feel like home in Bangalore! as i miss the city so much. From the cute sumo wrestlers to the an amazing street /gangsta kinda interiors.
The servers were very well mannered and prompt.
Coming to the food we had the wings...succulent and juicy , though the punch in the sauce could have really completed it but nevertheless it tasted fabulous .
The gyoza , lettuce wraps , summer rolls were individually brilliant and the flavours very distinct in each of them. Though the Gyoza could be more juicy.The standout for me in Mamagoto was the truffle dumpling . It was just wow! it could be an acquired taste for many but for me it hit just the right notes!
I initially wanted to give 4.5 but i am giving 4 because unlike Bangalore and Delhi they played it pretty safe in Kolkata , keeping in mind the general idea people have about the so called 'Chinese' food in restaurants here.But i am surely coming back again to try the desserts and drinks.Cheers!!

Mamagoto is among the new restaurants in Kolkata, located on Park Street.

Let me start with the positives ‚Äì¬†

1.	Thai Green curry ‚Äì Yummy! Good portion size with lots of veggies. You have to order steamed rice separately.¬†
2.	Oriental Clear Soup ‚Äì Fantastic! Again, good portion size with lots of veggies.¬†
3.	Chunky Caramel Sponge Cake with Toffee Sauce ‚Äì Scrumptious! Yet again, good portion size and served with ice cream! The cake is super soft and not very sweet.¬†

If I went for a meal with another person, the above would be my exact order.

Average dishes -

1.	Vegetable Basil cups ‚Äì It's fun to eat; diced veggies on a lettuce leaf with a dip. Good for a group of 3 or 4 people.¬†
2.	Summer rolls with Basil dip ‚Äì The basil dip is amazing but the rolls wont leave you drooling for more. For some strange reason, they serve less than ¬º th of the dip cup filled, almost like a couple of drops and we had to ask for a refill. Good for a group of 3 or 4 people.

Not ordering again ‚Äì¬†

1.	Som Tam Salad ‚Äì Quite tasteless. I am sure you can eat Thai salads at other places.¬†
2.	Crystal Dumplings ‚Äì Weird gooey balls. Pretty yuck!
3.	Baked potato ‚Äì Bland!

I visited the restaurant twice and would say that the service is average. You constantly need to try and get the server‚Äôs attention, which is a let down compared to the other Mamagoto outlets in India. The server kept getting us food even when there was no space to place it on the table. We had to ask him to take our glasses away to fit all the starters and soup he got at the same time. They should be trained better.¬†

The restaurant doesn‚Äôt really have 6 seater tables. So if you‚Äôre a group of five you manage with an extra chair and if you‚Äôre six, then just squeeze your self in.¬†

The pocket pinch is around 800 per person without drinks.

This is a great place if you're into authentic Asian food. The ambience is really nice, however ensure you make a reservation in advance. It's located really centrally, near Allen Gardens, Park Street. The staff is super helpful and friendly.
The food is probably your best bet at getting proper South-East Asian cuisine in this city. The portions are generous and there's a wide variety of food to try.
(Pro tip: go for the noodle/rice bowls.)

LOCATION:

Located on Park Street at Magma House. Its unmissable with its signature bright Yellow color play and and stickers depicting a Japanese sumo wrestler stuck to its windows.

OVERVIEW & INTERIORS:

Modern Asian dining is taking Kolkata by storm. Residents of Kolkata love their Asian food and are slowly but surely transitioning from traditional Asian to modern Asian Food with its robust flavors and interesting fusion of ingredients. Mamagoto is the forerunner of Modern Asian Cuisine. While meant to appeal to a younger audience with its vibrant feel, quick service, dynamic interiors and extremely interesting and modern food, I believe anyone and everyone looking to try Asian food with a twist should give this place a go. The restaurant is housed in two levels. The ground floor has the reception and a few tables which I think would be an option for people who do not manage a seat upstairs on their main restaurant floor.

The second level contains a roughly 50-60 seater restaurant which has been decorated with colorful wall paintings of pandas and the Japanese girl on their logo. I loved the color play of bright colors which along with certain rustic elements and good electronic music give the place an Asian bodega kind of feel.

WINE & DINE:

We ordered for Hua Hin Highway Rolls, Crispy Lotus Stem, Chicken Nasi Goreng Meal and their Chocolate Cake.

The Hua Hin Rolls and Crispy Lotus Stem were perfect. They were among the best I have had with a great balance of flavor and spices. The Lotus Stem was served with a tamarind dipping sauce which was really nice and something different to what you would usually have.

The Chicken Nasi Goreng Meal was once again great with perfectly marinated and grilled Chicken Satay Skewers which were perfectly complemented by well seasoned and caramelized Nasi Goreng Rice. The bowl came with some Gado Gado salad and prawn crackers. Quantity was enough for two people. I would highly recommend this dish.

The only disappointment of the evening was the Chocolate Cake. I found the cake to be disbalanced between the sponge and the icing cream. The Chocolate flavor was not adding enough bitterness or depth to the cake which resulted in the cake tasting too sweet. I would also recommend a pinch of rock salt to the cake to cut through all the creaminess and sweetness.

Service was great throughout the meal with attentive and cooperative staff. We were not told a no for any of the little requests that my pregnant wife made such as extra sauce, or separate Thai Sweet Chilli Sauce. They were also accommodating in terms of personalizing a dish.

FEEDBACK FOR IMPROVEMENT:

All was perfect but the Chocolate Cake. Another thing I think they should look into is the pregnancy friendly bit. While they do not provide reservations beyond 8:30, I do believe exceptions should be made for Pregnant women or disabled people. It is not possible for them to get there and wait for a table.

VERDICT:

Some of the best Modern Asian food you will have with a couple of bumps here and there.

I went here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. Once you enter, there is a reception desk, three to four tables and a giant blue bear. Their main section is on the 1st Floor. Their decor is quite trendy with traditional Asian features. Their seating arrangement is quite dynamic. The staff is courteous and well informed about the food they serve. Their Mamagoto T-shirts have quirky lines written on the back like "Do you have a spare ticket to Tokyo" or "Don't be so formal". Our order consisted of: 

1. Chinese Sour & Pepper Soup(22 Ingredients) - Slightly thick in consistency but really tasty. 

2. Hua Hin Highway Rolls - Crisply fried vegetable rolls with paper thin layers. 

3. Cheese & Truffle Oil Dumplings - YUMMY! 

4. Soggy Thai Basil Fried Rice - This rice bowl can suffice two to three people. It's soggy only to an extent where you don't need an extra curry/gravy to eat with it. Perfectly cooked rice with a pleasantly dominating basil flavour. 

5. Hawker's Noodles - Flat rice noodles served with tofu and nuts. It's slightly spicy and dry. One has to order extra curry to go with it.

6. Caramel Sponge Cake with Toffy Sauce & Vanilla Ice Cream - This is the reason I wanted to try out Mamagoto. I had heard such good reviews for this. And it completely lived up to my expectations. It's an extremely soft and moist caramel sponge cake that just melts in the mouth. Served with a YUMMY toffee sauce and vanilla ice cream.

Mamagoto has become one of my favorite asian restaurants in Kolkata. Be it their food or ambiance or the decor, the place's appeal is spot on. Having said this, I would guarantee that an person who has visited this place will agree that the staff is quite friendly and un- Kolkata like.¬†

Nice place to for lunch. Ambience was decent. Food was good..  really like the taste and quantity was also good. Drinks are okay. And free snak was quite okay. Missed the chocolate sauce on the Brownie n ice cream but it was good in taste. Little high on price side.  N service charge is too much, especially when comparing to the service they provided. Now service charge is not compulsory so u should avoid it. Over all staff is smiling but felt like too many managers in a small place and it was looking crowded coz of that.
For 2 people approx amount will be 2000 INR.

Let's be clear first, the food...is awesome. The portion is always big enough for two, The taste is mouth watering, and the spread is enormous. I would like it better once it has one-upped in the case of cocktails, but this is definitely going in my list of places to eat. Try them all, look for the odd names, and try them..they're all good...

After being turned away the first time for lack of a reservation with 4 people a prime reserved, EMPTY 4 people table right in front of my eyes i called next time before going to be told there are no reservations it is just walk in. GREAT!

I have been to MMGT B'lore often so took this humiliation lightly in view of the great food they obviously serve. We were seated in a middle, very noisy place then reseated as a group came and ended up in prime window table. We ordered chicken hakka, osaka train station bowl, a chicken dish and the top mutton dish from.the menue plus steamed rice. It was full around 1 pm so the order took some time. The taste of the food was great, the portion of hakka noodles measly so we needed to reorder another. 500+ rs. Invested in noodles. Meat portions were good. Spicing is mild so children will also enjoy that. Service was hectic. Ambience see pics. I removed a full mark for the idiotic reservation/no reservations story.

Its a showy place, they don't want you to linger. Its more like an eat an leave place. Music blares loudly, ac is cold, deco is wild. Don't expect to unwind over all tht. There are many tables and they stand close together, forget privacy. To close the review on a positive note the bill was a nice surprise: 2k. Not bad for 4 hungry people.

Would i go again? Yes! Food is too good...

This was in my list for a long long time just because of the ambiance and the look that they had and zomato users were all gaga with their amazing pan asian cuisines. This saturday, post a heavy workload, we decided to rest ourselves with the delicacies at Mamagoto

We started off with two virgin drinks, with the bases as kiwi and watermelon respectively and it was one of the best experiences with fruit juices that i had in ages. Fresh fruits swam across the glass and the cool and refreshment of the mint leaves were an added bonus altogether.

For entree we started off with bacon wrapped prawns and their complimentary rice chips, the bacon wrapped prawns in sesame and japanese sauces and that aroma of a burnt and roasted prawn added to the taste. Loved their plating, and the way they served, with a sauce in a separate cup and those coriander leaves. The soy sauce with an essence of burnt garlic was a killer.

For the main course, we went for stir fried tenderlion with thai flavors and in bamboo shoot and schezwan sauce. and it was a killer again. Never did i had such beef, which was soft, perfect medium rare, and the batter fry added to the kick. We teased it with bali bamie rice and the portions were huge and gigantic and we literally had to overfeed ourselves in the end

For dessert, we went for banofie pie, which had the banana base, fresh cream and cookie dust. The cream was fresh as anaything

I loved the interiors, very quirky and craft, reminded me of hollywood movies a lot, loved the light setup and the tables were hanging and being next to the busy parkstreet was a bonus. and it being situated atop magma house is an added bonus, u get to see a lot of things around you

Overall, i am planning for my next team visit here only, and i wish they served as far as salt lake and rajarhat

Fun Asian dining at Park Street, Mamagoto is a pretty little place to enjoy. The restaurant has a vibrant and quirky ambience with an open kitchen which adds to the environment.

We had Hot Basil Chicken Cups and Shrimps with Dry Red Chilli for starters. Both the dishes were pretty good and had nice flavors.
For mains, we tried Fiery Thai Shrimp Fried Rice with Green Chicken Ribbons along with Chicken Three Pepper Bomb and Chicken Bali Barnie Noodles. The bowl was fantastic and chicken pepper was delicious as well, however the noodles felt a bit bland.

But the drinks were pretty disappointing. Both the Martini and the Mojito were very sweet and the alcohol part was very less. I hope the management looks into this.

The service was prompt and polite. The crowd got bigger as time went on and the bustle in the restaurant was pretty well managed.

Overall a very good dining experience and will drop by soon!

Hm, Mamagoto!! Was decent, but didn't stand up well for me. Had Hawker's noodles, was decent. Staffs are sweet but we're not that throw up with the menu. Drink was perfect. 
Coming to deserts now, which I love the most but was disappointed with that. Banofee pie was bad! Please work on that!! 
One more try is again necessary as rest of the food is still left for tasting.

Have bookmarked this place since it opened its first outlet at Kolkata. Visited this place on 1st of Jan‚Äô17 & was pretty obliged that we got a table instantly. This place serves authentic Asian food & no doubt the food was sumptuous. We had ordered for Prawn & Celery dumplings, Traditional Peking dumplings(chicken) for starters & Hawker‚Äôs noodle & Red Meat in Black bean sauce for the main course. The price is a bit too steep but the quantity of each portion is sufficient for two people. Have heard a lot about Mamagoto ¬†& this place definitely live up to its‚Äô reputation. The decor & ambiance does give a feel of Thai eateries. Looking forward to visit this place again.

Located right on Park Street and spread across two floors with a seating capacity of 50 covers, Mamagoto boasts of edgy d√©cor which exudes vibrancy and creates the perfect setting for a fun Asian eating experience. I have been to their Mumbai and Delhi outlets a number of times, and was eagerly looking forward to their entry in my city. So finally when they did open up in Calcutta, I was literally jumping with joy!

On my visit to Mamagoto on an invitation by Communications 2.0, the energy at the table was eclectic, and the fun was accentuated by the remarkably fast service. The dishes kept flowing in in spite of the place being jam packed with guests. 

My favourites were the contemporary and minimalistic Cheese and Truffle Oil Dumplings, and the Java Grilled Fish, marinated in Indonesian Sambal, grilled in a banana leaf wrap and served with a mound of sticky rice. The dumplings with their translucent encasings, smelled divine and tasted equally good. If the dumplings were about subtlety, the flambouyant Java Grilled Fish was all about bursts of colours and flavours. The fish itself was cooked perfectly, and the spicy, flaky fish was perfectly complemented by the accompaniments.

When one door closes another opens..they say, we experienced. As barbeque nation closed their door for the lunch, mamagoto opened theirs for us. A fun asian dinning it calls out loudly. To be honest at first I thought this place to be a Japanese restaurant and it was only later when they presented their menu book to us, I realised that I was befooled by the name.
The decor is kind of themed around Japanese and Chinese culture and one would be welcomed by a huge Tibetian or Himalayan blue bear figurine at the entry. The bear wearing a dark sunglass was probably trying to cheekily indicate us about its sunny days ahead... Although I am not quite sure.
Mamagoto is a Japanese term that means "to play with foods" and I was expecting something innovative and creative at the same time delicious in my plate. I was a looking for any Japanese sushi or sashimi items in the menu but as I told earlier I was befooled by the name...There was none!! We ordered sticky rice with pork belly BBQ, steamed chicken dumplings and passion fruit orange blossom mocktail. The innovative decor will certainly grab your attention as you seat comfortably and try to get a feeling of the place.
Must spend a line or two here mentioning the helpful, courteous and attentive trainee there who responded to all and every queries of us with a smile on his face. That's nice and soothing. Coming to the food: the mocktail came in a huge milk bottle and both of us struggled to finish it. More than enough for two. The passion fruit flavour was subdued with a subtle flavour of orange zest. The taste was on the sour side. The dumplings were quite good and thin layered with full of chicken pieces in it. It was to the point though I must tell you that we were served only 4 pieces of chicken dumplings at a high price. One can easily get a bigger bowl of chicken dumplings at a much lower price in Kolkata. The sticky rice came along with three pork belly BBQ sticks, some sauted greens and a poached egg. The pork belly BBQ was chewy. I personally didn't like the taste of the dish, there was nothing special or 'playful' in the plate.
This place charges 10% service charge without letting its customers know or as the law says without any notice/board conveying it. Here I am bound to pay the service charge irrespective of the fact that how satisfied or dissatisfied I am with their service. That's unethical.
The decor and the attandants would come to my mind first and not their foods. I am quite sure that mamagoto needs to pull up their shocks and up the ante to survive here in Kolkata specially in Park St. There are so many eateries in Kolkata that offer better quality food at cheaper rates. Kolkata is a food heaven guys.. To get a grip here you need to perform better than Delhi for sure.
I would probably give it another go..not so sure

First visited this place on Saturday. Hadn't booked a table beforehand, so we were told to wait 20 min but luckily just after 10 min we got a table. Table booking is very much recommended.
The music is just too loud for my liking. And the place is pretty congested. They did their best to fit more tables.
Authentic Chinese food is always appreciated in a place where most people are used to "Indian Chinese". So this was pretty refreshing.
We were in a hurry so couldn't explore the menu so much.
We ordered chicken teriyaki meal in a bowl and a wan chai midnight chicken (their version of kung pao chicken). Liked the latter better than the former. Got a scoop of ice cream on the house, which was nice.
Pocket pinch is on the higher side and they do levy 10% service charge.
Would love to revisit to explore the menu and update this review.

The day Kolkata finally got its very own Mamagoto at Park Street my bookmark list was all smiles. The giant blue yeti welcomes you at Mama's and those colourful stairs lead to a place full of quirk with beautiful decor. Mamagoto, though is not much spacious but has a lovely, lovely interior, fun music and a breezy bangkok like ambience. Coming to the food section, we started off with the Mama's Shrimp dumplings and Mama's veg dumplings. The shrimp dumplings were ahmazing, filling with a little lemon jest on top. For the main course I had a Mama's spicey Bangkok bowl filled with spicey minced chicken and sticky rice with a boiled egg on top. My friend had the street style Panang bowl which was veg curry with peanuts on top and tasted Amazing. Both the bowls were very filling and a dish on its own. Ended the meal with a lovely Chunky caramel Sponge cake which was lighter than air and all the caramel goodness. The service was quite quick and the staff were very attentive and courteous. So though the price is on quite the higher side, All in all Mamagoto has a lovely aura, serves amazing food and makes you play with food.. Literally.

A casual Asian dining restaurant with very unusual ambience, which you will definitely like. Tried their A Thai lost in Hunan, mamagoto goreng, Smokey bbq pork belly rice.
Quantity was very impressive. The first two tastes superb. They messed up a big time with pork belly rice, very blunt & the pork pcs are almost burnt with a very chewy thick skin. As I've opted for take away, so no comments on service. The packing was good.

We visited Mamagoto on the 25th of December .
The interesting decor, music and menu raised our expectations. 
We were just there to catch a few drinks and try some starters.
We ordered vodka and began with some dimsums. The Mama's special dimsums were nice, but the tangy sauce in which it was almost drenched made it really soggy. The tang didn't suit my palate.

Next, we tried the Honey Chicken which was absolutely beautiful. Just the right amount of crisp and the quantity was fair.

We moved on to a Prawn starter, the name of which I fail to recall. It could have been one with Dry red chilli. It was the best of the lot. Quality wise, the prawns were amazing.

The quantity disappoints and the prices are much on the higher side.

Around 120ml of liquor and three starters later, we had nearly reached 4000/-.

hi, was there with a friend to try out the new place n ordered for a veg summer roll with basil dip n a honey chicken. As the menu says that it soya, expected some sort of silken tofu to be present but just found shitake mushrooms n chopped carrots,asked the server to change it but unfortunely he brought the same thing back , saying it was changed....well everybody doesnt like mushrooms, n specially shitake, it should have been mentioned on the menu,lastly had to eat what i got n had it with a little of peanut sauce. Expected a much better tasting product , dont think the recipe is too complicating....such basic dishes shouldnt go wrong like this one.

The best oriental food in town. Very friendly staff and the cheese truffle dumpling is to die for. A must visit for everyone and the best thing is that it's pocket friendly.

On 27th December, we went in a large group of 8 people for lunch. It was my partner's birthday and we had been meaning to visit Mamagoto for a while, but each time not being able to get a seat. This time we had thankfully called up for a reservation, but even t hen we had to wait for a good 40 minutes to get a seat. Coming to the place, it lives up to its baseline of "Fun Asian Eating". The decor is super funky with bright colours and pop art on the walls. There's a super cute, gargantuan blue bear wearing sunglasses when you enter as well. The music is loud, the vibes are happy and it's the kind of place you would want to visit with your friends for a nice meal on Park Street.¬†

First bummer - There was no alcohol! I mean what! How can you have a¬†birthday celebration without copious amounts of beer? Turns out they only have permit to serve alcohol on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. We were so glad that duribg the 40 minute waiting perios, we had gone and grabbed some beer at Silver Grill.

Anyhow.

We got a table upstairs and ordered a whole bunch of starters along with a complimentary platter of prawn flavoured crisps and a couple of really flavourful dips:

- Hot Basil Chicken Cups: By far the favourite among all of us. Minced chicken tossed with basil and herbs, served in a crispy lettuce cup. It's wholesome and the portion is large, one plate containing 8 cups. Scrumptious to say the least!¬†
- Classic Chicken Wings: Juicy and spicy but I am not much of a fan of chicken wings, personally.
- Mama's Lab Kai - This supposed to be a salad. But wasn't really a salad. It was more like minced fried chicken with some lettuce and greens and a tad too much of fish sauce. Very tasty but definitely not healthy.¬†

- Old School Gyoza - This was again, really, really good. Very juicy and just the right amount of fried at the bottom. Highly recommended.¬†

- Mama's ¬†Dumplings (Chicken & Prawn) - I personally liked the gyoza more. These were a tad dry.¬†

After the insane round of starters, we were all very full but egged on by birthday induced happiness we somehow decided to order a ton of mains as well, which we really struggled to finish. For some reason we were under the impression that the portions would be small, but guy, no. Their portions are pretty big. So expect to share with someone, whatever you are ordering:

- The Laksa Tribute - Just the previous evening I had been watching Masterchef Australia where the contestants had to taste and identify the different ingredients of a rather delicious looking laksa. And since then I had been craving laksa. So making my choice was fairly easy. The laksa at Mamagoto is really good. A rich yellow curry of noodles, chicken and vegetable with a strong essence of fish sauce, lemongrass and other herbs, with half a boiled egg on top. It was very appetizing and filling. The portion size is enough to feed two hungry adults.

- Spicy Bangkok Bowl: The birthday boy and another cousin ordered this. I really liked the taste of this one. ¬†A spicy mince of chicken and herbs combined with sticky, slightly sweet rice.

- Thai Green Curry - This was exceptionally good. Arguably the dish of the day. A beautiful, creamy, rich coconut broth containing slices of chicken, sugar snap peas, lemongrass, red chillies and eggplant. It's addictive. All of started eating from the two portions of green curry that was ordered. Best enjoyed with plain white rice.

- Mamagoto Goreng - This was my least favourite. The others did not enjoy it as much either. The regular nasi goreng sans the gorgeousness of flavours. The chicken satays with the peanut sauce was good but the rice fell short in terms of flavour.¬†

None of us had any space for dessert. But we did cut the birthday cake that was brought from Flurys next door. Annnnd it was yum!

So over all the food was very satisfying. Would I be visiting again? Definitely. Simply for the hot basil chicken cups and the green curry!

Located near Magma House ,Park Street, went there for New Year lunch. I personally liked the ambience and the decor as it was quite different, decorated with Japanese paintings. the staffs were quite helpful specially this girl named Puja suggested a few good dishes.
¬†We ordered for the starters Cranberry & kaffir punch, this was cranberry juice ¬†with a tangy flavor, blue berry cooler, which was similar to the cranberry juice, along with honey chicken & rock shrimp tempura, hot basil chicken cups, which I found very innovative, in plating ¬†& was very tasty. ¬†For the main course we ordered fiery thai shrimp fried rice, which was quite flavourful with a tangy twist &the quantity was ample for one. The bali barine noodles tasted heavenly, a li'l spicy yet sweet. ¬†we skipped the deserts. Overall,it was a good experience,I will recommend ¬†my friends to Mamagoto.

The two seater tables are placed too close to each other. They should be placed differently. The food is good. Was very happy to receive a free surprise chocolate brownie on Christmas Day and a free gift hamper (the coma kit). The coma kit gift hamper was very well-designed and most importantly these freebies were a very nice gesture to spread the happiness. Thank you.

A pathetic experience and a realization of a drop of lemon juice spoils the whole milk. 
With due respect to Mamagoto brand, nice welcome, good ambience, good food is just not enough, customer spending money should get respect, the young girl appointed Puja, i guess she is new in the team, she has  wrongly suggested and made my friends meal spoil, we had eat what actually did not wanted to. Later she has refused to change the food and I must Say she shouldn't show her attitude in front of customer, even i have noticed she was very confuse and was acting  rude with other guest at table. behavior is something your management should teach, actually in school and home should we learn. She has got worse attitude not recommended for service industries.

I am quite a regular of mamagoto in mumbai so couldn't wait to try it when it opened in Kolkata. This place is located right on the main road in park street. The decor of this place is quite nice .. but a bit cramped. It has a couple of tables in the ground floor with majority of the seating on the first floor with an open kitchen.
Coming to food... tried the honey chicken for starters...it was excellent. The crystal dumpling was average , the texture was a bit too sticky! My favourite was the teriyaki chicken rice bowl. Excellent!! The Vietnamese noodle bowl and The Osaka tube bowl was also good. Quite flavorful but not spicy! The dessert was a bit disappointing. We tried the coconut palm sugar ice cream.. which was very average!
Overall a must visit for sure :-)

Went with a lot of expectations and the place was jam packed for Thursday lunch which raised our expectations. Started with crystal dumplings which was really amazing than had a jacket pocket which was awful. Crystal dumpling had a very nice flavour and binding was really good. On the contrary jacket potatoes were just boiled potatoes with mustard oil and mayonnaise. However, waiter replaced it with corn fitters which was again average. We had a kiwi drink and a strawberry drink. Both were good. We skipped main course and for dessert we had american style cake with caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream. An average experience

Sometimes dreams do come true!!!... A feeling like no other when your preferred restaurant comes to town. Mamagoto overwhelmed my palette when I experienced the magic in the dreamy city of mumbai. Finally in 2016, I could experience it in my city of joy Kolkata. First up, the interiors are casual, quirky and creative. The asian inspired paintings and posters create a beautiful setting. The food is incredible and bar is well stocked. Highly recommend the veg street style dumpling, crystal veg dumpling, veg pad thai noodles, vegetables with udon noodles in teriyaki sauce, spicy bangkok rice bowl ( veg) and veg laksa. The regular favourites like sangria, whisky sour, old fashioned, martinis are there to ensure a boozy time. The desserts are good, unfortunately sticky rice with mango was not available so devoured the american style caramel sponge cake with ice cream. Mamagoto aspires to create a fun dining experience and it delivers loads of it in style.Kudos to Team Mamagoto.Keep up the brilliant work!!!

The pan Asian restaurant is one of the restaurants lining on the Park Street main road and after a 30 minute waiting in the hustle bustle of post-Christmas we got a table for the six of us. Let's begin with the decor which I must say intrigued me from the ground floor. Japanese manga fusion with food elements line the walls. Huge and bold brush strokes depicting giant sumo wrestlers are so cool. The first floor seating area covers both well lit and dimly lit areas and equally lined with Japanese murals quirky and interesting. You can see the kitchen countertops from your seats which personally I love because it brings you more close to the whole culinary process.

We ordered:
Old style chicken gyoza - very delicious potstickers
Tenderloin oriental soup - The best clear soup I have had in ages.The meat was tender, bokchoy and snap peas provided the balance and was well seasoned.
Spicy Bangkok bowl - very fragrant ( guess the fried Kaffir lime leaves are the magic ) and very hot minced chicken on a bed of sticky rice topped with boiled egg. To each his own but one must definitely try this out. 
Masaman lamb curry with steamed rice - The lamb was well-cooked and the curry was balanced. You could smell a lot of cinnamon in it. 
Thai chicken, water chestnuts and lemongrass salad - Cold salads aren't my favorite and this one is too sweet for my taste.
Homemade coconut and palm sugar ice cream - bless this place for this lovely end to the meal

Service:
Though the place was jam packed given the holiday season still the service was effectively slow between the starters and main course. Personally I don't like loud music at restaurants because food and conversations together is my style specially when a place like this has so much to experiment from the menu. I took out 0.5 because of the music volume and the time gap between the orders.

If you're searching for some authentic Asian cuisines with some Indian twists then this place will be appropriate. The interior decoration and ambience is very good and eye catching. As per my own view, that barrier they're facing is space-shortage thus you might have to wait for 20 or 30 minutes though its a festive season so we've to consider for that. The restaurant is very small though the demand for food seems to be very high. Now coming to the main part i.e. food, we've ordered Cranberry and Kaffir Lime Punch, Smoky BBQ Pork Belly Bowl, A Thai Lost In Hunan(ATLH) and Chicken 3 Pepper Bomb. The quality of the food is great, served fresh and flavours are properly blended and giving a balanced taste. The BBQ sauce giving an extra punch to the Pork Belly and the texture of the lamb in ATLH is really awesome. Coming to the hygiene part, its clean and every parts of measures is taken to maintain the required hygiene. They're also managing their customers brilliantly trying to skip the obstacles they're facing in the present juncture. And obviously Value for Money is little bit higher than reasonable. So, in conclusion I can say that they are good follower of Total Quality Management (TQM) though they've to work little more harder on the Customer Relationship Management (CRM).

Had a lot of expectations from the Kolkata outlet. The place gets a little too cramped even on a Monday afternoon and the music is too loud. The service is unbelievably slow and unsatisfactory. Coming to the food, we ordered two of their signature bowls one with the noodle and one with the rice option. The spicy Bangkok bowl was an absolute treat to the tastebuds with a punch of lime leaves beautifully complementing the spicy chicken. The Saigon bowl, although flavorful was a tad too dry. A little bit more sauce would've beautifully accompanied the glass noodles.

Christmas Rush on Park Street meant that not an Inch of space to tread at my old favourite Trincas, so decided to give Mamgato a shot. The strikingly tasteful ambiance and a very courteous staff raised my expectations of this place.  The big letdown was the food, there was a signature Christmas special. Recommended by the Order Taker, it was a soft open Taco with banana fritters on the sides. Very mediocre chicken toppings deficient in both quantity and quality.  To accompany my beer I decided to opt for another more run of the mill starters.  So the next order was classical Chicken Wings. Which made the previous dish appear a lot better. The chicken was dry and devoid of any moisture within. The seasoning and tempering was very very mediocre and did nothing to appease the pallet. 

Another thing whch bugged me was the glass in which beer was served. It was a tad too long for serving a pint; as I like my beer with the foam head just at the rim level.

So what was not bad in this place, well other than the food, everything was great, despite the rush the servers were quick on their feet, the service was prompt and the ambiance was really nice.  But for my 4 pints of beer and two starters a damage of over 2.8k with no great meal experience is why  Mamgato earns a 2.5 rating from.me

Now ¬†finally Mamagoto had opened it's restaurant in Kolkata. It was in my wishlist since long time and finally could make it today. The ambiance was cool and different. Japanese style paintings are in the walls with bright colours. One should sit in the first floor to feel the vibe. They orgaised table for us very quickly during the festive time. Thanks to the management for this, though it was a rush hour. Everything was nicely prepared. The food is delicious,
Pricing are at little higher side. It was so lively. The music was loud but it suits in that ambience giving that festive feel. The staff was so so polite , communicative and friendly and the owners were attending each guest personally. Loved their nature. Looking forward to visit soon in the near future to taste different cuisines...¬†
Cheers!

Mamagoto is a great addition to Kolkata's food culture. Located at Park Street Mamagoto boasts of a wide variety of great Asian and Chinese dishes.  We visited yesterday, being a group of 6 we could order a variety of food! The dried chillie n prawn fried bowl was a great starter--deep fried prawns accompanied by a tangy sauce, followed up the super delicious bacon wrapped prawns and barbequed chicken!

For the main course we chose , soggy chicken fried rice with traditional crispy lamb and lamb lap Kai salad.  Also followed pad Thai noodles and chicken 3 pepper bomb. Most of the above dishes were on the spicier side, but very very tasty! 

The mocktails/cocktails were ok.

Coming to the ambience, it's very good and snazzy! Nice selection of good English music and not the usual honey singh crap! Nice crowd nice atmosphere and great food. MG is a must visit for people who likes Asian food.

This restaurant have been on my radar for quite a while. So one of those days, randomly I decided to step in. Being the Asian food lover I am, given my love for the Chinese, Japanese, Korean food that I have and also being a vegetarian, needless to say I was intrigued by what this place had to offer.¬†
So Mamagoto have an amazing decoration, incredible service, old school style and each one of the employees seemed to be having a good time, like, they know what they are doing and enjoy it at the same time. Extra points for the phrases at the uniform of the guys, because that help to bring a good mood both for the person eating and the person serving.¬†

The menu has plenty of option and (thanks India) a lot of vegetarian alternatives. Also kudos for having a lot of DIFFERENT FOOD that any other restaurant, the presentation is amazing and is full on creativity. Sadly my palate is just not tolerating the extra spicy/chilly flavor and despite that the guy warned me and later promised to get it less spicy for me, it was... uneatable. ¬†So, with the best of my intention I just asked to be packaged so I will give a way the food to some of my friends who could actually enjoy it!. What did the restaurant did? Made me a new tofu plate not spicy at all and completely yummy and ...free.

The drinks were also delicious, they have again plenty of option and I cannot emphasize enough the attention to details these place have, in everything, the food, the presentation and the attention.¬†

One thing to keep in mind? That nice lady you have as manager assistant, the one that assigns the tables for you, she has a nice presence, make up, dress, manners but it was completely ruined by her choice of shoes! ¬†careful with that when you are the female image of such a nice place!.

It's what you'd expect if you've been to any of their other locations around the country. The interiors are well done. The food is good, no doubt, and sticks to their philosophy. I'm not one for such spicy food, but I'd still go back for the noodles served with mushrooms in a broth and their grilled tofu.

The best food I had in a long long time. I would totally recommend this place. They get the most amazing Thai food to table as promised. First look at the menu will give u a thought that it's expensive but the food portion justifies the price as well as the heavenly taste of every dish. My personal favourite was cheese and truffle oil dumpling. Really friendly staff and the decor was also cool and quirky. Would love to go back whenevr possible.

Interesting pan Asian food with a enthusiastic, youthful twist. A trendy, inviting vibe. Courteous, engaging service. Hard to get in without planned-way-ahead reservations. And, an experience that‚Äôs a must have in Kolkata.¬†

We were visiting from Dubai, and told by family that Mamagoto is one of the hot new restaurants in town. After a couple of failed attempts at getting a table via their reservations line, we managed to squeeze in a reservation for lunch on a weekday (Wednesday, today) and were just so glad we did. Mamagoto is a delightful culinary journey across modern day Asia and all the stops on the way that we tried were just wonderful.

There‚Äôs a lot of Japan inspired stuff all around trying for a nice Shinjuku, Tokyo street-eat vibe. There‚Äôs   funky new music that plays quite loud. But, perhaps the mixtapes could be better, and a bit of a twist to the music might just be on order.

The service is attentive, all smiles, happy to help and old school courteous. Valet parking is available,  but do note that fetching the car afterwards takes a good 15 minutes. Of course, the food‚Ä¶

Pity, all the brew they serve is a Heineken. A cold Tiger or Singha would have probably done better in that flight zone.

We ordered Rock Prawn Tempura and Hot Basil Chicken Cups for starters. These came promptly. The Chicken Cups were spicy, grilled minced chicken in crisp fresh lettuce cups. These were delicious, and the portions were pretty decent. The Rock Prawn Tempura was a cupful of crispy batter fried prawns served with a nifty tartare dip. The serving was generous (around 15 medium sized prawns) and this was nice bit of shareable.

One of the mains we had was the Prawn Laksa Tribute ‚Äì a slightly modernised yet authentic version of the Malay Laksa ‚Äì a classic noodles soup on a coconut, lemongrass, galangal and red chillies platform. This was absolutely delicious. An aromatic, thickish soup with a generous amount of large prawns swimming in tangy coconut milk. The noodles were soft and just blended in to the soup and din't at all interfere as some times noodles do in Asian dishes..¬†

We also had the spicy, wok tossed Chicken Three Pepper Bomb ‚Äì named after the three peppercorns ‚Äì green, white and schezwan ‚Äì that somehow make this dish a threat to ordinary and same old. People who like bland, dull and boring beware. This isn‚Äôt for the faint hearted. We ordered a side of sticky rice to go with this, and found that the reward for being brave and ordering a dish that had the word 'bomb' in it wasn‚Äôt really at all destructive. This was a majestic bit of a dish (our favourite) and the white wine and sesame oil finish may have calmed down the situation in that serving bowl just a tad, but it certainly didn‚Äôt subdue the warm, succulent chicken that simply exploded with taste in your mouth. The rice is a must. A security blanket you'll need as the explosion happens.

Our final mains was the Spicy Bangkok Bowl ‚Äì chopped chicken cooked in thai spices and herbs over garlic and chillies and served over sticky rice. This was a vibrant red dish of chicken and rice. The potato wedge garnish was a bit of a mix up, but the chopped red chillies and fresh lime wedges added both a nice zest and a fresh notch to this powerful dish. The generous bowl of chicken and rice isn‚Äôt ordinary at all ‚Äì it isn‚Äôt a curry dish per se, not like a soupy mess either. This was a thick hot, spicy serving of a lash at food exuberance. A delight actually with hints of basil and herbs and freshness bringing all the spices alive. Nice one this. Spicy, satisfying one this.¬†

We didn‚Äôt try the desserts or the cocktails. There wasn't a need. The menu is long and tries hard to please every palate, meet every Asian dish curiosity head on. As said earlier, we were visiting Kolkata, and really can‚Äôt compare Mamagoto to any other Asian destination in Kolkata, but it certainly is way up there, honestly, on our list of Asian places that we think are hot and happening in Dubai. Or, say, London. Or Anywhere. Yes, we would go back. Mamagoto will be our goto place for Asian in Kolkata. What a bomb!

Mamagoto is such a place where you would like to visit over the weekends even if you have to wait there to get a seat.Amidst all the queue, their attenders were so humble and service just perfecto. 
Food remarkable, the twist in the chinese and thai cuisine is noticeable but satisfying.
We started with Kafira lime and Cranberry mocktail which quenches your thirst as well as satisfues your heart.
Food started with Spicy Asian Barbeque Chicken Breast and you cannot help yourself but praise this delicacy. Little spicy with a hint of lemon grass gibes a kick start.
In main course, ordered the authentic Chicken Hakka noodles, sticky chicken fried rice, chicken with bamboo shoot in schezuan sauce, and crispy chilly fish in pepper sauce.
Now all the were pure heaven. The fish had an extra hint of pepper, gives a crunch. I loved the sticky rice, very less spicy and goes well with the schezuan chicken.
A high five to this place. A must visit.

Come sunday and my hunger pangs routes me to a new restaurant in the city.
Yes this time it was mamagoto situated in Parkstreet.
We dint have a reservation thus which meant we were waiting. The pleasant part of waiting was the hostess arranged a welcome drink for guests waiting.This was a very positive approach towards the guests.
20 minutes waiting time and we were given a seat on the 1st floor.
This restaurant too believes in rugged interior concept as per trend going on these days.
A knowledgeable food and beverage associate took our order. He guided us very well with regards to ordering the food.
Food took a reasonable amount of time (10 minutes) for making its way to the table. The first bite of the appetizer triggered the tastebuds to go for more.
Thai green curry with steamed rice was my maincourse and it was sumptuous.
Home made American style sponge cake with toffee sauce served with vanilla icecream is a must try over here.
My experience in this restaurant was splendid and 
I would recommend this place to everybody who loves thai cuisine.

Yesterday went to Mamagoto, Park Street along with two of my guests. Entering the restaurant, we really like the decor and ambience. The music, the wall arts, etc. were very very unique in its own way. But it was the food and the service which actually mattered to us. We ordered for three different mock tails, Kiwi & Mint Collins, Cranberry & Kaffir Lime Punch and Blueberry Cooler along with Honey Chicken with bell peppers mild schezwan pepper and street style spicy dumpling chicken as starters. The mock tails were very refreshing and tasted really well. The honey chicken was sweet yet it had a tinch of sourness in it and was very well cooked. It was delicious. The chicken dumplings were also very good. For the main course, we had ordered for chicken pan fried noodles, chicken fried rice and crispy fish (vetki) flillet in a spicy black pepper sauce. After having the stated dishes, felt like kissing the hands of the chef. It was so perfectly cooked. For dessert, we had choco walnut fudge with ice-cream. The staffs were courteous and were also very prompt & active in their services. If you are a lover of proper chinese/asian/thai delicacies, Mamagoto is like a church where you will find peace and satisfaction of your appetite. Well done Mamagoto, keep up the quality of good food and good service.

After an awesome time at a guitar concert visited this place to cherish the moments. And it was worth it. The ambience is good. Staffs, starting from the reception to everybody were smiling, courteous and receptive. Though the place was real noisy may be because of the loud music and the noise of the crowd..
Coming to the food ordered prawn wrapped in bacon and watermelon martini to start of with. The prawn with the bacon was amaaazing but the martini was not good as a cocktail. The complimentary munch-on provided was lovely. In the main course had fiery thai shrimp fried rice with asian green chil and it was real yummy  flavoured and filling.
Expected to have more varieties in the desert section. Though u may not have any space left after the food üò¨
Wish to go back again and try the other signature bowls.

Delicious food, great ambience and amazing service by the extremely courteous staff - what else can you ask for when you walk into a restaurant on a Saturday evening. In spite of being extremely crowded with queues of people waiting outside, the staff ensured that nobody at the tables felt rushed and we could not only enjoy the lovely food but also have a great time chatting and laughing with each other. The waiters knew a lot about each and every dish. The food was lip smacking good and the quantities were more than enough, making it very good value for money. And even though you will be very full at the end of your meal, I would suggest that you save some space for their signature toffee sponge cake. We literally attacked it at the end and almost picked up fallen morsels from the table. It was that good. Go there and wait for 45 minutes for a table, if you have to. It will be worth it.

Loved it so much. The food, the place, the staff..so amazing. I think that mamagoto should change their name to 'pure bliss' . A special mention about Mr. Arnav who helped us choose our food, because his choice of selection was absolutely beyond comparison. A must go place.

So it was a Wednesday when I visited the place for lunch along with a friend. It was completely packed up. So do make a reservation before going! The ambience is Superb! And the staff is very polite and well trained!
Being strictly vegetarians we ordered
Starter: CRYSTAL DUMPLINGS: it just melts in your mouth. Never had something so delicious. It's a simple dish, comes with 2 dips. And can be ordered in 4/6 pieces. A must try! 
Main course: SPICY BANGKOK BOWL: the perfect maincourse as one can say. A perfect combination of flavoured rice topped with think gravy of vegetables. A must try again!
Dessert: CARAMEL SPONGE CAKE: again a deifinately must try dessert if you are a caramel lover. A slice of sponge cake, with topping of caramel accompanied with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and also caramel sauce! I am still missing it!
Drinks: though they dont have much options as of now,we tried ORANGE AND PASSIONFRIUT SANGRIA which too went very well with our food.
Extra points for complimentary rice chips which is served with two dips!
Mamagoto! Definitely a must visit place in Kolkata!

Excellent is the apt adjective to describe the food at Mamagoto. The portions are more than sufficient for two while the taste just lingers on in your mouth long after you have left the restaurant. This is the best Asian food joint in Kolkata, according to me. Longing to visit it again.

A great place for Chinese cuisine in Kolkata. The seating capacity is a bit small compared to the mamagoto in Bangalore. The staff is friendly and Courteous. They have a temporary liquor license now, so a lot of variety in drinks isn't available. Coming to the food, we ordered mamas chicken dumplings, Osaka tube station chicken noodle bowl and chocolate fudge cake with Ice cream. The food was full of flavours and authentic Chinese.

The restaurant is situated in the heart of the city. Visited for lunch during weekday and can say this place is surely the new hangout place .You should sit in the first floor to the get the feel of the delightful ambience. Warm and active staffs are thumpsup.
The menu offers wide variety of asian cuisine..The quantity is sufficient for three. The asparagus starter and curry was mouthwatering and exquisite. We wanted our panfried noodles to b less spicy but it turned out to b too chilly .We had to get it replaced. Cranberry and strawberry based drink was refreshing.An average fudge dessert ended our meal. All in all new destination to satisfy ur gastronome.

And it's time I proudly announce the Ninja in town and m kind of impressed by its diet... yes #Mamagoto is the new bee. On a lazy Saturday afternoon we besties craved for something that puts on some fiery flavours to the palate and landed up trying this place. Quick, simple,  cool, quirky, and too many other vocabularies could fall of describing this feel of this place. To me it was unique and to be enjoyed in the power of infinity. Service was excellent and time calculated to serve your ordered food was a perfect balance. On the menu there are options that will attract you everytime and unlike others the innovative names for the dishes promise a different experience too. My favourite pick is the London's China Town Chicken...and it's a must try It was paired  with a bowl of soup that was prepared with 22 sea food ingredients. I am yet to eat like a Ninja hence my totally set to visit soon and fulfill my desires. Cheers team keep going.....

Now that Mamagoto had finally opened its restaurant in Kolkata, I had to pay it a visit. I went in for a lunch with a friend.¬† We straight away ordered two cocktails. A Pomegranate Sangria and a Lemon zest vodka Lime fizz! Both were well punched with a perfect balance.
For starters we ordered The Street Styled Spicy Chicken Dumplings and¬† Prawns Wrapped in Bacon. I loved the sweet and tangy sesame sauce they served with the prawn dish. In the mains, we ordered Cantonese Styled Pan Fried Noodles and Chicken Three Pepper Bomb. This is easily the best cantonese sauce I've had. 
Crunchy Caramel Sponge Cake with Vanilla ice cream was just the perfect ending served with the Hot Toffee sauce. The staff were quite courteous and the ambience was great. They could work on their playlist though. Some good jazz would do wonder! 
Overall It was a wonderful experience. Would love to go back!

I liked the old school chicken gyoza and  prawn in mama's sauce ... But the bali bamie chicken noodles were a disappointment as it was too soggy for my liking.... 2nd stint Zomato doesnot allow to add another review so editing and enhancing the previous one the food was just amazing the bophut hot chicken wings and the steamed fish were fantastic and loved the subtlety of the chicken fried rice and london's china town chicken
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

A little piece of China lands in Park Street, Kolkata. The first impression was that it would be a fun place -  thanks to the quirky d√©cor , excellent music and the overall happy ambience I was sure that it would be a great evening. And I was correct. The interior is amazing, to start with. With Sumo wrestlers on the windows and the feel of a wrestling arena with nets and dim light adds a fun and relaxed touch to the ambience. Coming to the food, we ordered Stir Fried Pak Choi and Water Chestnut with Bamboo Shoot and Cashew Nuts, Crispy Fish Fillet and Crispy Lotus Stem has been our choice for starters. No point saying the dishes were amazingly delicious and unique in their taste and flavor, especially the lotus stem. For main course we decided on the Sticky Egg Fried Rice, Spiced Asian BBQ Chicken Breast, and Teriyaki Meal in a Bowl. We also ordered a chicken with Bamboo shoot which was exquisite in its taste. The Spiced Asian BBQ however was a bit too spicy for my taste. Even though we have had too much, but for a foodie like me, no meal is complete without a good dessert. Deciding on the dessert was also a tough job, but we successfully narrowed it down to Banofee Pie and Mama‚Äôs Home-made Chocolate Cake. Both were equally good but I would give a point extra to the chocolate cake. Must recommended place for all foodies.

I have mixed feelings about the whole experience. The music, ambience and drinks are very nice. Good place to chill out and pre gaming. Food, not too sure. The dimsums and Satays were nice and presented beautifully. Tom yum was way too spicy and sweet corn soup was not good which being a simple soup is difficult to mess up. The steamed beckti was prepared well but had no seasoning. Nasi goreng was a disappointment. Udon noodles with prawns were good. Was very excited to see soft shelled crabs on the menu as in Kolkata it's difficult to get that. But was disappointed with the preparation of it. The whole flavour of the crab got lost in the heavy coconut cream. All one could taste was coconut milk. The gravy was too thick and overpowering. 
It's great to see new concept restaurants opening in Kolkata but they need to really buck up on the food if they wanna stay in the game.

My experience at Mamagoto was 50-50. I had ordered 3 items from the wok section of the menu: the egg sticky fried rice, a steamed fish and the chicken green curry. Fried rice was good. But then, it's pretty tough to mess up a fried rice. The steamed fish was a little peculiar. Presuming it's originally a Chinese dish, and I am Chinese, it didn't taste like anything I expected. The chilli sauce on top tasted more like Indian hara chutney, there wasn't enough salt in the dish and something in it tasted a little bitter. Green curry had too much coconut cream in it resulting in a very heavy gravy. I suppose herein lies the problem with fusion cuisine. It's difficult to create version 2.0 of a dish when the original is so well known and loved. 

Despite my mixed feelings on the food, I think Mamagoto is a good up-and-coming restaurant. Ambience is good. Drinks are delicious, although they haven't quite figured out their liquor position yet (served only on Wed and weekends?). Parking is a problem, but that's Park St for you. It's a nice break from the usual Kolkata flavours. A nice way to spend the weekends: drinks and running down the menu at Mamagoto.

This new Asian food restaurant in Park Street is really a fun place to be. Firstly the interiors are great. From the Sumo Wrestlers on the window panes to the colourful walls and chairs, everything is bright and fun. The ground floor have a small seating area and the main dining hall is on the first floor.

Coming to food, though I am a non vegetarian, still I found the crispy lotus stems highly addictive. The Chicken Gyoza was also good, but again the veg mushroom filled truffle oil dumpling won our hearts. Hua Hin Highway Rolls was another veg starter which will make the hardcore non-vegetarians go crazy. Among sides the steamed fish in green chilli sauce is a must, must, must try item. Excellent dish. I can go back only for this dish alone. The Pad Thai was also really well made.

Kiwi and Mint Collins and Cranberry and Kaffir Lime Punch are two drinks which I found really refreshing.

Among dessert the Misti Doi Cheesecake is a great item. Dense flavours with hints of mishti doi. Great way to finish a meal.

It is great to see a place which gives equal importance to both veg and non veg dishes. So, to all my vegetarian friends, there are plenty on offer for you guys too.

This place is love. Inspire of spending a major part of my childhood in Japan I have never had Wasabi Mary. Loved the interiors and the rice chips. The dumplings were spot on. My favourite part of the entire course. The seaweed flavours were perfectly extracted, the java grilled bhetki was delicious to the bone( minus the fact that it was boneless üòÇ) . The Thai lost in Hunan was a bit on the sweet side , but it was well balanced with the heat of the pepper. I am definitely coming back for the dumplings. Best dumplings in all Kolkata.

Mamagoto, the new place for the foodies in Kolkata. Went for a Sunday night dinner and enjoyed it very much. The ¬†complimentary sago chips and the two kinds of sauce (one spicy, the other sweet) set the expectation high from the start. The music was upbeat and complimented both the decor and the food.For starters we had crispy lotus fried and oil, cheese truffle dumplings. The fries were munchy and tasty and the dumplings were awesome!Next we ordered for java grilled fish - and was bowled over by the taste. Its a must try.Lastly we went for the recommended Chiang Mai Train Station Noodles and loved its refreshing taste. Though we wanted to order more, but we were quite full and thus will have to wait for our next visit.

It is not a matter of pride that even though I live in Bombay, I haven‚Äôt been to Mamagoto yet. Universally acclaimed, almost unconditionally loved ‚Äì I finally made to this pan-Asian joint at the newly opened outlet In Kolkata. We came in on a weekday afternoon, and there were no tables available! Seemed like people were already flocking the place. However, we were given a small table for two with bar stools, and hungry as we were, it was quite sufficient. I looked around the place, and as far as brands go, they really have done up the place nicely, with quirky, oriental paintings. Coming to the food, then.

We were welcomed with a bowl of Sago Chips served with a Sambal Sauce and a jiggery-based sweet and spicy dip. The three of them complimented each other beautifully ‚Äì and we couldn‚Äôt stop finishing the sago chips on the trot. The first item to arrive at the table was the Cheese and Truffle Oil Dumplings, which I had ordered on an online recommendation, and of course, it sounded a little unique. The four dumplings were served prettily on a plate, and as soon as we bit into them, we knew true bliss. I possibly cannot explain how smooth, how delicious, and how comforting those dumplings were ‚Äì in addition to being extremely flavorful. The truffle oil added the right amount of aroma to the dumplings and we were busy chewing our way into heaven, so much so that I almost did not notice the bowl of Oriental Tenderloin Broth arriving at its hallowed destination. Still savoring the after taste of the magnificent dumplings, I now set my eyes on a bowl-full of soulful soup that I wouldn‚Äôt have to share with my co-eater, as she doesn‚Äôt eat beef. Call it bliss! And damn, wasn‚Äôt the broth wonderful! Loaded with sliced mushrooms, bok choi, spinach, spring onions, tenderloin chunks, and topped with crushed, fried garlic ‚Äì this clear soup was as clean and heartwarming as it can get. The veggies were crunchy, the meat was tender, and the broth was a denouement of all good things in the world ‚Äì and this was the time when I wondered if I will have an equal amount of fun in the next part of the meal. The first two items were exactly the type of oriental food that gets my adulation, and I had already fallen in love with Mamagoto. 

We then turned the heat on (less figuratively than literally, but only just so) with the Java Grilled Fish in Red Hot Sambal Sauce, and one of the reasons we ordered it was that they make it with Sole fish and not Basa (which I don‚Äôt like at all due to its neutrality ‚Äì fishy people you see). It looked grand as it arrived to us ‚Äì served on what looked like an intricate teakwood tray right from the heart of Burma, wrapped in banana leaves and accompanied by a mound of sticky rice, a red tomato-chili sauce, some greens, and cucumbers dressed with what felt like preserved beancurd and sesame seeds. We unwrapped the monster fillet, and started to dig in. The fish was extremely well done, firm yet yielding to the slightest of probes, and the sambal sauce was very very tasty. Not extremely spicy, but rather flavorful and with the right amount of heat. The fish was fresh, and having a good Sole is always a pleasure. 

The last substantial item of the day was the Chicken Osaka Tube Station Bowl ‚Äì an order I was looking forward to because of my love for ramen. It was a minor glitch for it to not have sliced pork belly, but what arrived on our table was almost as good. A bowl full of happiness served with thick noodles, sliced poultry, marinated boiled eggs, spinach, mushrooms, sweet corns, and herbs ‚Äì this was soul food, just like the doctor‚Äôs order. The broth was a signature one, with touches of miso and soya, and in no time I found myself lifting up the bowl and draining the residual soup from the abyss. The quantity was really good for two, and I could not be more grateful. Even though the first two items stole my heart, I couldn‚Äôt really rate the four items against each other ‚Äì all were crafted equally well, and maybe I would place the Beef Broth on a slightly higher pedestal because that right there was everything I love about oriental cuisine ‚Äì the warmth, the wholesomeness, the crunch, oh my! And of course, mitron, I love the controversial meat.

The sweet ending to the afternoon came in the form of two scoops of Homemade Coconut Palm Sugar Ice-cream, and these were great too, only a little bit too sweet for my taste. However, the flavor was distinct and unique, and along with Wasabi and Black Sesame flavors, this was another of my new iceplorations in Kolkata this time. Overall, a superb place ‚Äì Mamagoto needs no adverts. Head here for any occasion, and don‚Äôt forget to say hello to the two fat monks at their tireless vigil.

Booked a table for 7 people as it was my mums birthday. But when we reached there we got a cubical seating for 4.
When we told them it's not possible for 7 of us accommodate In a 4 seater the manager is telling  us to adjust there and he can add one more table once it's free. The cubical seating was in such a place that if he would have put a table the waiter would have to HOP over our tables to be able to serve. 

We simply asked one question why did u take a booking of 7 people when u know u don't have a table. There is a word called NO all they had to do was use it. 

Completely ruined my mums birthday.

One word. Wow. I never knew how much I could stuff myself until I came here. 
Between the two of the us, we ordered 4 starters and a main. We are vegetarians so all those who want to know the best veggie dishes there, here's the list. 
We started with Summer rolls - fresh, crunchy and refreshing! 
Then we had the Crystal Dumpling which was just insanely good. It melted in my mouth. 
The truffle cheese dumpling was a great surprise. I never thought that cheese dumplings could taste this good. The star of our dish was Basil Cups - I could eat it every single day !!!! 
For main course we ordered the spicy Bangkok bowl which was only okay in comparison to the starters. I wish they would have a better range of main course considering how heavenly the starters were. 
Service was super quick and the staff was very friendly. The complimentary rice chips were just too tasty. 
This place is going to give great competition to Yauatcha! I'm so glad there's an Asian place like this in town. Loved it !!

‚ÄòMAMAGOTO‚Äô itself has something quirky about it that stirs up the imagination of a prospect to Go To!! And trust me the imagination meets up with reality in the form of a very quirky exterior and an even quirkier interior.¬†
The ambience of the place adds to the entire dining experience. Though the restaurant is small, it is lively. Their d√©cor is as funky as their other outlets. The staff is very attentive and the service is good.

For the main course, one is spoilt for choice. They have a variety of meat and vegetables and a number of sauces. One can let their imagination run wild and try different sorts of combinations, a luxury which only Mamagoto provides..
On my Visit.. I wanted to try only veg items so I ordered ..
Vegetable Basil Cups that had 8 Pcs.. it had Basil, birds eye chilli, soya, corn, mushroom etc filled on a lettuce cup.. it had amazing flavour 
Bali Bamie Noodle.. it was mainly a Hakka noodle.. with a twist of Indonesian sweet soy sauce and sambal.. it's taste was something new and very tasty!

The best part of the meal was the dessert. Their dessert menu is to die for! It has the perfect balance of all the flavours, which makes it a great way to end the meal. 
Their Banoffee pie is another beauty. The layers of cream, banana and pie together form a lethal combination which just explodes flavour in the mouth. Mamagoto certainly knows how to end the show on a high note. Their desserts are stunners!
I'm looking forward for my next visit soon to have the nonveg items.. out of which fried prawn is a popular one!
Cheers to Mamagoto

Play with food @ Mamagoto..!

The oldest ever food hub of Kolkata? Park Street  , it is. Several brands with their magical food has never failed to mesmerise Kolkatans. The newest kid in the block is however a very famous Pan-Asian brand , Mamagoto, which has launched its first city outlet in this food hub. If a restro replaces the age old Marco Polo, then expectations will definitely be  illustrious and aristocratic.

Literally translated, Mamagoto indicates ‚Äúto play with food‚Äù. Mamagoto is a fusion Pan Asian caf√© with a relaxed and casual atmosphere where affordable Asian cuisine & drinks combine with quirky d√©cor. Mamagoto‚Äôs food is a blend of inspiration from Asian street hawkers, involving endless experimentation. Mamagoto offers a yummy range of alcoholic & non-alcoholic beverages made using fresh juices and ingredients at incredible value. So, drink up.

The funky, interactive, fresh, colorful ambience will surely going to make you feel at place.

Location : This is located where Marco Polo in Park street used to stand. This is just beside Barbeque Nation.

Decor and Ambience :  Spread across two levels, Mamagoto is  vibrant in its outlook. The interiors and a cheerful ambience make the place a chilling zone. The cute little Japanese sumo greeting people at Mamagoto is quite alluring.The quirky signature graphics designed exclusively for the brand. Their dining area and bar counter is on level one. The bar oozes an eclectic vibe with  its bright red colour and old art deco pattern. The 50-seater dining area has Manga art canvases on the walls. The black, white and grey check-style flooring, wooden tables and customised upholstery adds a touch of class to the overall look. Their glass walls overlooking the main road offer a view of the hustle bustle of Park Street.

always showered their love for great food.Well, ‚ÄúMamagoto‚Äùneeds no introduction when you talk about fine diners of Asian cuisine. As they expand their arms in major cities of the country, Kolkata gets their first Mamagoto outlet opened at the heart of city at Park Street. I was lucky enough to be a part of a bloggers meet on a Sunday Afternoon and got to

No, I am not going to fill this place with stories about the wonderful interior and the quick service (while all that is there, the place looks all bits of fun and great) I am going to let you into the fact that interests you the most. I am going to talk food and food only. Here are 7 items from the menu that you must order on your visit to Mamagoto.

Stationed at the heart of Park Street, the first branch of Mamagoto in Kolkata, mostly delivers. The interiors are funky, but if you are a pathological claustrophobe like I am chances are that you may feel cramped for space. Nevertheless the many (post-modern?) renditions of traditional Chinese paintings in the form of wall art and wall hangings are sure to catch your eye if not your imagination at the very least.¬†¬†

It was somewhere around 12 : 30 when ¬†we (the two of us) entered and the place was already bustling with life. Sorry, that came out like a sci-fi movie plot twist. Bustling with people, I guess. The seating arrangement is mostly in the first floor but they can accommodate a few in the ground floor if need be. We climbed up the stairs to be seated in a table for two.¬†¬†

After placing our orders for the starter and the main course, the person attending, provided us with a complimentary bowl of nibblers. The two sauces along with it were the real winners though : one with a slightly chilly base, the other comparatively sweeter.¬†First up were the steamed crystal dumplings . The filling made up with water chestnut, shitake mushrooms, carrots and lotus roots was a bit incoherent for my liking. While I liked all the ingredients individually, together they failed to seduce my taste buds. The translucent coating however was surprisingly tasty and visually this dish was a complete delight.¬†The rock prawn tempura next up ¬†was a very standard fare. I am a huge sucker for prawns and the fresh prawns deeply fried in a batter was just the right thing for me. Quantity wise it was satisfactory as well, there were loads of pieces : perfect for sharing. The chilly mayo sauce provided as a dip along side complimented the prawns perfectly.¬†
¬†

For the main course, the highly recommended Chicken Laska Tribute was just perfect. Firstly it is a very sumptuous dish, the two of us could not finish it and had to pack some for home. Secondly the flavors are so well balanced that it will make you go wow. The thick yellow coconut milk base along with lemongrass, galangal, red chilies, chicken slices and noodle is something that will heal broken souls and give you a warm fuzzy feeling : a feeling that will remain until the bill appears and brings you back to the cold mortal grounds of reality. Mamagoto is a premium place and they charge accordingly.
¬†

While I really wanted to try some dessert, the already stretching stomach did not. So, for the next time I suppose. Besides their menu is so varied (they even have a taco menu, whaaat?) that a few more visits are almost warranted.

Loved everything about this place. The ambiance, warm and attentive staff, quirky d√©cor, sumo paintings on Windows, 2 hanging tables, biiig purple pink bear downstairs with shades, cutlery. The menu is so so varied, that u r going to take a lot of time ordering stuff. The best part was when bill came in a momo basket. Cute :) .. and the food packaging is great looking too, in those Japanese food boxes. They also provide chopsticks

Located convieniently at Park street next to magma building , i finally got an occasion to check out the newly opened Mamagoto in our city of joy . Its was a weekday lunch and we four girls were very warmly welcomed and given a table upstairs. Let me say the downstairs has a continuous couch with 2-3 tables and diverging streaks of yellow bulbs illuminating the wall back, is not at all suitable for fine dining as the reception desk is just in front with guest coming and moving out continuously. the upstairs though not as big as i expected but large enough to accommodate groups and couples and colourfully furnished with a bar counter as well. the staff was very helpful to choose our orders :

THAI BASIL CHICKEN CUP( starter) : this was minced chicken in hot basil sauce that came on cup sized lettuce , could not understand how to eat , not appealing in itself , but tasty once you take it with the tangy dip.

SPICY BANGKOK RICE BOWL : this tasted similar , the minced chicken in basil sauce was topped over some spicy semi dry rice.

THAI LOST IN HUNAN : shredded lamb in red curry served on bed of sweet phad thai noodles with lovely peanut flavour. second best dish among all.

CHIANG MAI TRAIN STATION NOODLES : Winner of all. this was khaosuey and was loved by all. much much recommended.

All the signature bowls were shared by 4 , the servers did excellent arrangement in dividing the khaosuey in separate bowls and serving the rest food among four of us . the portions were gigantic , one bowl has to be shared between two atleast.

we were overstuffed but couldnot skip to ckeck out atleast one of their dessert, i followed previous review recommendations and ordered

CARAMEL SPONGE CAKE WITH TOFFEE SAUCE : honestly , none of us had palate suiting it , but it was a decent one for sponge cake and toffee lovers. we didnot like and had to leave it without consuming the full portion. could have better skipped it!

Unfortunately the only negetive part was the ending . i brought a birthday cake beforehand and asked the manager to keep it , after we cleared our cheque , i asked the staff in charge of our table to bring the cake which was supposed to be a surprise to my friend. we waited and waited for 15-20 minutes , nothing came , all of us got severly late for 2nd half work and as i got downstairs to inquire what went wrong , the guy below answered the cake is here , should we take that upstairs? now what an idiotic question!! however seeing we were in hurry and pissed off they made the arrangement on the ground floor itself , but in such a rush we couldnot celebrate the occasion that we came for . the staff should have been more careful and coordinated to tackle such occasions smoothly.

But again , neglecting this as a teething trouble , and considering the food , service and portions did full justice to whatever we paid , therefore such a score.

one tip : please make a booking beforehand , specially dinner ones as i heard mostly its getting filled up soon even on weekdays!

The popular asian fine dining restaurant 'Mamagoto' opened doors to its first outlet in Kolkata recently.It seems to be a hit already as there were always huge waiting times whenever I contacted them for booking.

Anyhow, I finally had my first Mamagoto meal and it definitely made my tummy super happy.
You can see quirky artwork with asian overtones adorning the walls .The decor is not extravagant but follows the theme well.

We had -
1.Spicy Bangkok bowl with sticky rice
Its high on spice but also high on flavour. Not everyone likes so much spice but I personally loved it.

2. Veg. Basil Cups
These lettuce cups were an absolute joy to have . Its a scrumptious yet light appetizer.

The service is top notch.Its not intrusive ,yet helpful. The prices are steep but one may find it justifiable because of the overall quality of food and service.

All in all,I had a great experience and would definitely visit them again.

Service is friendly, accommodating and chop chop fast. I only had their Laksa which was absolutely excellent; without doubt one of the best I have had outside Singapore. Bummer that booze is not served though; I suppose there‚Äôs only so much of a good thing one can take. Worth a detour. Oh, and boys and girls of Dubai, you won‚Äôt have to make that big a detour ‚Äì I hear Mamagoto are opening in Dubai in 2017. Yeay!

Mamagoto has been my favourite food place since I got introduced to it while living in Delhi. I was super excited to try out the one which opened in Park street but I must say that my experience was kind of a let down. Firstly, the d√©cor of the restaurant although very pretty is not as spacious and well lit like the ones in Delhi. Secondly, the waiters had accidentally taken down wrong orders for our table and thirdly, my most favorite dish of mamagoto, the soggy Thai basil sticky rice with chicken was not that great. I'm giving it a 3.5 although I am very fond of mamagoto overall. I loved their rock shrimp tempura, chicken ramen noodles and the hot basil chicken cups. The sauces they give with the dishes are delicious as well. The spongy caramel cake is to die for. Mamagoto has a unique pan Asian cuisine and its a must try for people experimental about food.

I am sure by now all Zomato users know what the word Mamagoto means, so I will get straight down to the review.
The decor is nice, funky and youthful. I especially liked the tiger and laughing Buddha wall mural on their staircase. The management deliberately maintain the decibel level on the higher side which as far as I'm concerned goes with the profile of the restaurant. The seating arrangements are also quite casual and I loved the high seats towards the walls. 
The service is swift, efficient and friendly. The staff are warm and hospitable. Before they handed us the menu cars a plate of twisted rice crackers were served with a red chilly paste which somehow I could not have enough of.
We ordered a Watermelon Martini and Green Apple Mojito each. They weren't great but they weren't bad either.
The food though is unquestionably good. We ordered the shrimps with dry red chilly as our appetizer. The portion size was rather generous. The shrimps were cooked to perfection and the spiciness of the chillis went well with the subtle mayo dip that they served. We wanted to try the squids but unfortunately it wasn't available. There were quite a lot of items on the menu that warranted attention. I was really tempted by the noodle bowls but we settled for the promotional Japanese menu that they were running on that Friday afternoon. Soba noodles in ponzu sauce with grilled tiger prawns. Once again the prawns were beautifully cooked. The charred flavour from grilling the prawns and the garlic-y and spicy sauce combined very well with the 'slurpingly' good noodles in the sweet sauce. 
A lot of things have been untested and untried so there is no doubt that I will be returning again soon. Good service and great food. Perhaps not the best value for money but then again this isn't an average Golden Dragon or Tung Fong (not that they are bad but cheaper). Definitely recommended.

True to its name : "to play with food"; it's funky atmosphere and loud music is playful and blends with its name. With a huge variety of Asian street food bowls over rice or noodles, it transports you on an Asian tour at an instance. 

Their culinary skills are amazing and the presentation is very intriguing; in an ambience that's energetic and vibrating with positivity. Huahin highway rolls or one of the dumpling to choose from and splurge upon, the very many rice or noodle bowls won't let you leave dissatisfied. The colourful mocktails blend well with the concept that's so colourful yet again. 

Though the steward and the lady to welcome were courteous and helpful, some people need to be trained well to interact with guests. Happy that we have a cool and a different place in an otherwise laid back place. Strategically placed in Park street, you won't have to fight for Parking space as valet makes dining simpler and comforting.

Remember when moms used to tell us not to play with our food? Well, now we can safely forget that at Mamagoto! The very name of this adorable restaurant in Park Street means to play with food. Note that we are no in way asking you start a food fight but gear up to experience the different flavours and textures of the varied dishes. This restaurant has let its creative juices flow, with one sumptuous dish after another and you just need to sit back and soak it all up! Most of the dishes are Asian inspired and the appetizers especially are a rendition of street food found in different Asian countries. It's a food journey you would love to be on!

Our favourites among the appetizers were the Hot Basil Chicken Cups and Hui Hin Highway Rolls. We also recommend the Cranberry and Cafe Lime among the mocktails. The Pad Thai, Ching Mai Train Station Noodles and Steamed Fish in Green Chilly Sauce are worth a try among the main course dishes. Our absolute favourite, "will dream of this for weeks" dish between the desserts was the Mishti Doi Cheesecake. It is light and a combination which one simply cannot deny! 

Check out our blog for a more detailed review. Happy eating!

Lunch today was at the much talked about Mamagoto. It's the hot new property on park street (bang opposite to the NEXA showroom) and it's food has been the talk of the town for a while now. Thus, expecting my tastebuds to be swished away to the land of the Orient, I walked into this establishment. 

Loved the ambience!!! Very cool decor, trendy upholstery and of course,good music. 
Their service too,is good. Their staff seemed to be novices but that was made up by their warmth. We had to change table twice and they politely complied. Thank you!üòä
Now coming to the food, I really was a bit disappointed. I will blame this partly on my very high expectations(since I had been hearing some good things) and partly on their need to pay attention to hygiene(found hair in my food). So when the manager suggested a different dish other than the faulty steamed fish, I gladly went with it. The then replaced,crispy fish was good and so was the chicken Hakka noodles. However, the London's china town chicken was a serious let down. It lacked flavour and didn't really excite. I wouldn't recommend it. 
But the winner was the 'hot basil chicken cups'. I highly recommend it, especially for the fresh sambal sauce that accompanied it.
I would go back to Mamgoto to try their signature bowls, which I sadly missed today and the warm behavior of their staff.

Mamagoto has finally come to Cal...and how! To start with, before you visit I would HIGHLY recommend you book a table (preferably more than 24 hours in advance) because the two times I've tried, they were booked for the whole day. For a walk in on Saturday night, we were given a 45 minute wait. The staff was extremely accommodating, however, and we're managing the crowds with extreme professionalism. 

For starters we ordered the hot basil cups (served in the cutest lettuce leaves). It was an 8 piece serving so perfect for sharing. The chicken was packed with flavour and had extremely strong Thai flavour...delicious! We also ordered the shrimp mama dumplings (they were out of chicken) and were served a veg mama dumplings - due to a slight mix up with our order, the management compensated with this dish. To our surprise, we enjoyed the Veg versions much better - the texture of the filling was interesting and the sheet it was filled in was silky smooth. Another thing I appreciated was that the dishes have different portions - you can order either 4 or 6 depending on how many people you are with which makes it easy to share and you can even have more variety!
For mains we went with the egg fried rice, black pepper tenderloin and the London style chicken. The dishes complimented each other well, although they were a tad salty!
We chose the caramel cake for dessert and it was simply divine. The cake was light and fluffy and the caramel sauce is perfect for a caramel lover like myself. 
The meal was approximately 2100 for three people. The best part is you leave feeling satisfied but not uncomfortably full as none of the food is heavy. They also have a variety of healthy options, and none of their food has MSG which is great!
I encourage you to go try some fun Asian food!

Dive into the unexplored flavors of South East Asia with the opening of your much awaited restaurant- Mamagoto. Finally after what only seems like ages, Kolkata has its own Mamagoto cafe. Rightly established at Cal‚Äôs Food Street, also as you may call it Park Street, this restaurant is a few seconds walk from Barbecue Nation. Even though it is¬†newest addition in the neighborhood, it immediately jolted the next-door restaurants and cafes with its instant customer-pull.

I was invited to Mamagoto to try their food. This renowned food chain has recently opened their doors for the residents of Kolkata. The restaurant located in Park Street, surprises you by its's quirky decor and innovative food.
The word "Mamagoto" in Japanese means to play with food and that's precisely what the restaurant aims to do, to play and pleasantly surprise our taste buds , and also making sure to visually impress us with their presentations.
Among the starters the dishes to remember were crispy lotus stem, hot basil chicken cups and rock shrimp Tempura.
Their specially prepared salads is a proof of the fact that they have not forgotten the fact that today's generation is health conscious. Thus you have the snow peas and green bean salad , and the absolutely soothing  thai chicken water chestnut salad.
In the main course the Stir fried pok choi with water chestnut was a pleasant surprise because such a dish is a rarity. Loved the Pad thai chicken , steamed fish in green chilli sauce. 
The dessert was a special attraction as I got to taste the impeccable "mishti doi cheesecake" and "sponge cake with Toffee Sauce. (Strongly recommended)
If you love Pan-Asian cuisine then don't forget to drop in

On Diwali Day we had lunch at Mamagoto.  I have had Mamagoto food plenty of times in Khan market, Delhi. So was happy to see a Mamagoto in Kolkata.
I was quite eager to see if they came up to their Delhi standards-- they didn't disappoint much- there was a difference no doubt!
Firstly, in spite of a prebooking, they refused a table and actually did not have our details- in spite of an sms confirmation from them. Anyways they were quite accommodating and gave us a table.

We ordered crispy lotus stem as a starter- quite disappointing- felt we were eating overharded chips!

For main course we ordered a hawkers phad Thai, basil chicken,London's Chinatown  chicken, pakchoy with asparagus and cashew nuts. 

 Phad Thai was mediocre. So was the Basil  Chicken .
The best was the pakchoy dish and the London Chinatown chicken- star dishes! Too good.

The coconut ice cream was nice and creamy!
Will give other dishes a try next time.

To begin with .. I was baffled at the sight of a full house on a casual Wednesday late evening and having to wait atleast 15 mins before getting our seats. This goes to show the frenzy this famed restaurant has created in the minds of foodies especially in Kolkata  where you can find Asian food almost on every dining hotspots. Being a true Calcutta Chinese lover I must say that I had moderate expectations from the restaurant.

Decor: it was moderate. Nothing fancy although the space for seating was a little (people might say new age) constrictive.

Service: very prompt. 
Food: firstly we were served with complementary crackers with chilli paste which tasted different. I have certainly not had anything of this sort in any of the restaurants I have visited.

The classic chicken wings were the best I have had in years and trust me all the ones which have traditional written in the menus are must haves.
The sweet corn soup tasted different yet refreshing.
The prawn wrapped in bacon was a tad sweet and was the only letdown. The waiter also could not explain the smoky flavour when asked prior to ordering.
The fiery ramen is a broth which is very tasty and comes with all kinds of veggies chicken and egg and the egg yolk mixed with the.m broth creates a unique taste.

The mojito was also refreshing and was classic in every sense of the terms.

Price: Expensive. cost for 2 with tax came around 2800 and mind you it had only one cocktail and no other drinks.

On the whole I felt the mamagoto is definitely a must visit specially for the traditional menus and the bowls for 2 that they have. However, if you want to bring in elderly people this might not be the place. The price is high as compared to other restaurants in Park Street , therefore it is to be seen how it fares in medium term

I had been an ardent fan of Pan Asian restaurant, Mamagoto and have been recommending it to my friends ever since I had a meal at their Gurgaon Sector-29 branch three years back during a winter weekday afternoon. Their Thai dishes were so authentic that I remembered of the dishes and flavors which I had in Thailand, it satiated my Thai food craving which happens to be my favorite cuisine. It can be a separate blog post if I go on describing my love for this cuisine. So much so, that now I have learnt to prepare Thai dishes at my home from scratch (not with those ‚Äòimported from Thailand‚Äô curry pastes) and I must confess that all these last three years I had been waiting for this dream eatery ‚ÄòMamagoto‚Äô to open up one branch in my city of joy! So, about a couple of months back when I heard Mamagoto is opening up one branch in Kolkata, I was truly overjoyed and ecstatic like a kid, I texted few people about this great news and was waiting since that day to visit this place! My excitement got an extra topping when I received an invitation from the Mamagoto management and Communications 2.0 team for visiting this newly opened place for a bloggers meet over a scrumptious food tasting session, thanks guys for having me over‚Ä¶ it was like a clich√©d scene from any Bollywood song video were you are running towards your sweetheart and your beloved is also running towards you with an equal intensity and passion! :)

Mamagoto, the new destination for food lovers. Went yesterday to celebrate my Mother's Birthday with my friends. Thanks to my new office for which i discovered this new food joint on my way. As it was Diwali we had to wait a little for the seats but i must say if i will get this kind of food i can wait for ages. ¬†The ambiance is quite cool with colorful decorative staircases, paintings, hanging tables, low music and with a live kitchen.¬†
Now coming to the service. They are pretty much attentive to each customers, asking about the dishes and how we liked it, very frank, courteous, explained everything about the dishes we ordered.¬†

Now the main thing food. I won't say much about it because unless and until someone is having it they will think i''m exaggerating it . I can only say that my hobby is to find new restaurants and taste their dishes. i had been to most of the restaurants of kolkata but had not found heavenly food anywhere like Mamagoto. whether it's Park hotel, Grand Oberoi, Novotel, Taj Bengal all r okayish in front of this new food joint. Yes you heard it right. I said Okayish, rather i meant it. Even i had been to Singapore , Malaysia, Bangkok tried their food but none is like Mamagoto. As a food lover i personally feel Mamagoto will be my pilgrimage ¬†when it will come to food because this is the only restaurant in town where from drinks to sweet dishes every single thing was woowww, awesome and heavenly which is next to impossible thing for any food joint i guess. How can each dish be so heavenly that we could not say okayish or bad to any????!!!!!!!

we went for lunch around 2pm and finished it at 5pm. Now you can understand why i am saying all the above things. i won't say it's a costly or over priced restaurant. The quantity they give is quite a lot to serve 2 to 3 people.¬†

And last but not the least here goes the dishes we ordered -¬†

Drinks -¬†
1. Wasabi Mary - very organic¬†
2. Jasmine Tea - if you are a tea lover and as well as conscious about health you must go for it.¬†
3. Cranberry and Kaffir Lime Punch - soooooooooooo refreshinggg and heavenly¬†
4. Kiwi and Mint Collings - Kiwi lovers gooo for itttt.. you won't regret.¬†

Starters -¬†
1. Crispy Lotus Stem - you should try¬†
2. Shrimps with dry red chilli + burnt garlic - heavenly¬†
3. Cheese and Truffle Dumpling - heavenly heavenly heavenly

Main Course -¬†
1. Mamagoto Goreng - ummmmm. i said only this when i had the first spoon. super tasty.¬†
2. Street vendor's panang curry bowl mixed vegetables - those who r vegetarian don't miss it ever.¬†
3. Egg Pad Thai - heavenly heavenly
4. Prawn Three Pepper Bomb - heavenly heavenly.¬†

Sweet dish -¬†
1. Choco walnut fudge in a cup with ice cream - ummmmmmmmmmm
2. Sponge cake with toffee sauce - signature sweet dish of Mamagoto. have not tasted this kind of soft cake ever. the toffee sauce was like cherry on cake. it's sooooo heavenly awesome super tasty that i won't forgot the taste ever.¬†

P.S. - once you will come here you have to come again and again just for the food. Mamagot means ''To play with food". And they played very well ;)

Good service and well mannered staff is what defines a fine dining restaurant for me, at times more than the food for me. Happy to say that Mamagoto meets these criteria perfectly. We were initially given a small table due to the rush but later on the staff shifted us to a better table without us asking. Then, one of our orders got mixed up, for which they again apologised profusely - making it up finally with complimentary dessert. And that was a huge chocolate cake, nonetheless. As for the food - I like their concept of fusion Asian dining - serving up the best of cuisines from across Asia for someone like me who wants to sample something of all/most. The decor also gives off good vibes. So overall, a very good game experience indeed!

We visited this place during the pujas. We ordered rainbow chicken dumpling, honey chicken, fiery shrimp with chicken rice bowl and pan fried chicken noodles. Each and every item was unique and really delicious. It was so heavy for 5 people that we literally had to pack the remaining. The staffs are really courteous and i would to visit the place again and again.

Went there for Diwali lunch..its one of its kind...specialist in Pan Asian dish. We had Rock Shrimp tempura, Java grilled fish, yangchow champions fried rice and prawn three pepper bomb. We were so full that we had to stop else the food was so yummy we could hv sat all day long and continued. A bit pricy on the pocket pinch but its worth it. So just rush !!

Nestled between Marco Polo and BBQ Nations is this fun eating zone. The seating capacity is not high and so they try to preserve the seats for whom that I don't know. I went their with my mom and aunt.when I asked the lady at the reception for a table for 3, she said only bar chairs are available.when I said it would be difficult for my mom and aunt to sit in high stools she immediately said yes a table is available!!! On going upstairs I found 6 empty tables, all 4 seaters!!! I don't know for whom she was keeping the tables. Now let's come to the good part...the food and the service. Loved the cranberry kariff leaf drink.The watermelon cooler was very bad, though it comes with pieces of fresh watermelon but tastes very bland. We tried 4 starters and hot basil chicken cups and cheese and truffle dumplings are highly recommend. Also tried rock shrimp tempura which was nice. Old school gyoza chicken tasted good.
In the main course we had Bali barnie chicken noodles which was awesome. We didn't like London's China town chicken though..but overall it was a very satisfying meal. Couldn't try the dessert due to shortage of tummy space.The price is slightly on the higher side. Would love to visit again.

The place is in park street also they have valet, which is great for area like park street. The place is well decorated and follows the same theme all around India .

The food is ok and apart from special items are ok.

We ended up ordering the hua hin rolls which was nice , the chilli potato was a little bland to taste , the crispy lotus stem was nice and crunchy, street style dumplings was good and the mama special pot stickers was ok.
For the mains we had the khow suey was very good but super heavy and the basil rice was ok . 
And for the deserts we had the chocolate cake which was creamy and ok for taste .

Need to try the other things there.

I was egarly waiting for visiting this place from that very day I found them in the pages of t2... and ultimately my wish get fulfilled some days ago, when I dropped there with some of my friends... as soon as we entered the place, I get flawed with their ambience... deco is quite unique... l like their wall which is full of sweet panda pics and their colourful staircase so eye catching... also the sumos are very cute too... seating are quite comfortable... music was very smoothing... although I thik the space was not that big but it is well managed... Mamagoto is a gift to all Kolkata foodies on their 6th anniversary... and undoubtedly it's a gr8 gift indeed... Now coming to the food and drinks, the list was long... so have cool...

#Mocktails#

‚óé Kiwi mint cooler¬ª¬ª¬ª Good one... it consists of plenty of kiwis in it that every kiwi will like for sure...

‚òÖ Orange passion fruit cooler¬ª¬ª¬ª Okish one...

‚òÖ Mojito¬ª¬ª¬ª Good one...

‚ô° Cranberry and kaffir lime cooler¬ª¬ª¬ª This one is very refreshing...

Now here comes the back to back reasons for such a a high rating for the place...
Firstly the food...

#Starters#

‚ô° Cheese & truffle oil dumplings¬ª¬ª¬ª The green color dumplings with such soft coating a such an unique taste... ahh..

‚ô° Chicken gyoza¬ª¬ª¬ª Very tasty too...

‚ô° Crispy lotus stem¬ª¬ª¬ª Such a delightful presentation very well gone with the sauce...

‚ô° Hua hin highway rolls¬ª¬ª¬ª Awesome... if you love cheese... you will love this for sure...

‚ô°‚ô°‚ô° Hot basil chicken cups¬ª¬ª¬ª Highly recommend... go and give it a try... it was amazing...

‚ô° Java grilled tofu¬ª¬ª¬ª The presentation was very beautiful... and the taste was insane... I never tasted such a tasty tofu with such blend of spiciness till date...

‚ô° Rock shrimp tempura¬ª¬ª¬ª We were fighting for each single pieces... that's all what I can say... please understand how was it...

‚ô° Java grilled fish¬ª¬ª¬ª Preparation was the same as tofu... taste was excellent... the quality of fish was very very good...

#Salads#

‚ô° Snow peas and green bean salad¬ª¬ª¬ª Very good...

‚ô° Thai chicken water chestnut salad¬ª¬ª¬ª Awesome...

#Main course#

‚ô° Stir fried lok choi with water chestnut¬ª¬ª¬ª Mind blowing...

‚ô° Masaman curry chicken¬ª¬ª¬ª This is the for the first time I tried some different colour thai curry rather green n red... and it was superb... a delight having this with streamed rice...

‚ô° Streamed fish in green chilly sauce¬ª¬ª¬ª Extremely tasty...

‚ô° Prawn three pepper bomb¬ª¬ª¬ª Awesome... Yumalicious...

‚ô° London china town chicken¬ª¬ª¬ª Very tasty...

‚ô° Pad Thai veg and chicken¬ª¬ª¬ª So delicious... gone very well with the sides...

‚ô° Chiang mai train station noodles chicken¬ª¬ª¬ª It is basically Khaukswey... tasted yummy...

We ended up with two jaw falling desserts...

‚ô°‚ô° Caramel sponge cake with toffee sauce¬ª¬ª¬ª Just mind blowing...

‚ô° Mishti doi cheesecake¬ª¬ª¬ª A delightful dessert to end the treat... I never tried this type of cheesecake till date...

Yes guys then call then "Pan Asian cafe" not restaurant... but believe me whatever they can call them... they are giving the Pan Asian cuisine a whole new dimension... each and every dishes we tasted were so distinctly different from each other... also their preparations were so well made...

Secondly, their service was so so good... for which "Partho" needs a special mention... Also their other staffs are very good too...

I wish Team Mamagoto a heartiest thanks for coming to Kolkata and Best of Luck for the future...

‚ÄãMamagoto¬†is one of the pioneers of Pan Asian food in India. The term ‚ÄòMamagoto‚Äò literally means ‚ÄòTo play with food‚Äô, as is evident from their tagline which says ‚ÄòFun Asian eating‚Äô. It is on the ocassion of their sixth anniversary year that Mamagoto makes its official launch in Kolkata, thus gifting the city of joy with some fun Asian eating experience. Located in the food hub of the city, Park Street, Mamagoto has already emerged to be one of the most popular restaurants in the city. So I was much delighted on getting an invitation for the bloggers meet, organised at Mamagoto by¬†Communications 2.0
                                                                ...

Kolkata is experiencing an all new dining experience in the last few months. A number of places have sprung up in the by-lanes of the city, welcoming national, as well as international food chains to let the people devour a taste of the world. Mamagoto, fun asian eating have been introduced to the City of Joy this month. Located in the heart of food paradise, in Park Street, just next to Marco Polo, this place has already become a hit. Attending the bloggers‚Äô meet on last Sunday for lunch, we found all the tables except for the two that we kept engaged, were filled by the arrival of the lunch time.

It is a two storied place, extended over a large stretch, fair enough to attract you if you pass by. I loved the cute sumos squatting on the glass window panes. The d√©cor is quirky, vibrant with colours and a fun place to be. The concept of a few tables kept hung topsy turvy is really unique. Ambience is fantastic. So was the service. I would like to mention of Mr. Partha who took care of us all the time we dined with perfect potentials and checked that we do not miss out any part of this fun Asian eating at Mamagoto.

Now, the next part should include ‚Äì Food. Ah! I must say that Mamagoto is going to excel soon as they serve some real good dishes apart from fabulous service and fantastic ambience. It‚Äôs not Chinese. Dear Calcuttans, get this clear first. They serve Pan-Asian cuisine stretching from China to Vietnam, where the recipes are collected from the streets of Thailand, Singapore, Japan, Malaysia, China, and Vietnam. The authenticity is maintained so very well that you can distinguish each flavour from the other through the entire meal. Before I get into discussing about what I had that afternoon, I must wrap up saying that it‚Äôs a place you should visit. Definitely recommended. Here goes the list ‚Äì

Crispy Lotus Stem - This is one of the best I‚Äôve had till date. The lotus stems have been fried very well with a dip that you can call actual liquid gold. It is tangy and sweet, something which I prefer and goes very well with the stems.

Huahin Highway Rolls ‚Äì A delicious thing to devour. Presentation was excellent. So were the dips served with it.

Java Grilled Tofu ‚Äì This was served in a charcoal grill at the table. The tofu wrapped up in banana leaves and sticky rice along with some salsa. It tasted so well with the dressing. The tofu was extremely well prepared, a must recommendation for the veggie lovers.

Cheese and Truffle Oil Dumplings ‚Äì Oh! This was the first thing we were served. I am not at all a veg person. But how I loved it when the cheese melted into my mouth coming out from the green dumplings. Loved it absolutely.

Java Grilled Fish ‚Äì I think the fish was basa. This was served in a charcoal grill at the table. The fish wrapped up in banana leaves and sticky rice along with some salsa. The tomato dressing went so well with the fish. The fish was extremely well prepared, so soft that it almost disappeared. A must recommendation.

Chicken Gyoza ‚Äì I am a huge fan of gyozas. The dumplings were served already soaked in the dumpling oit and tasted extremely well. It is something you cannot miss if you‚Äôre a dumpling fan.

Hot Basil Chicken Cups ‚Äì Served in cabbage leaves, the chicken had a very unusual dressing. It tasted tangy and something that we would loved like anything.

Rock Shrimp Tempura ‚Äì The famous tempura tasted great. I feel a little bit of salt into it would do great but my fellow foodies said that it is the norm. Served with the mayo dip, the presentation was excellent.

Thai Chicken Water Chestnut Salad ‚Äì I am not at all a salad person. But this one was unique. Dresses with coconut milk and other amazing stuffs, the waterchestnut and the chicken created an interesting drama inside the mouth.

For the maincourse, I only tried the non veg dishes as I was too full already. The items here were ‚Äì

Chicken Masaman Curry ‚Äì A Malaysian delicacy, tasted pretty good.

Chiang Mai Train Station Noodles (Chicken) ‚Äì More like a Thai red curry noodles, this one also was nice.

Chicken Pad Thai ‚Äì Believe it or not, it was the best pad thai I have had till date.

Prawn Three Pepper Bomb ‚Äì Ah! An absolute delight. Definite recommendation.

London China Town Chicken ‚Äì Every city has a China Town and its own flavours and cooking recipes. It felt great to devour the taste of London‚Äôs China Town specialities sitting at a restaurant in Kolkata.

Desserts ‚Äì I am an extremely sweet tooth person. Whatever I eat, how full I am, I always have room for desserts in my tummy. This time too, eight appetizers, one salad and five main course items couldn‚Äôt stop me from it. The desserts at Mamagoto are divine. You can miss anything but not the dessets, mind you! We had ‚Äì

Mishti Doi Cheesecake ‚Äì Bangalis have a very close connection to Mishti Doi. It is only in this part of the country where the curd is served sweet. On the other hand, cheesecake is a classic. When these two meet, the classic concoction becomes an absolute hit. I bet you would love it and keep on craving for more.

Caramel Sponge Cake with Toffee Sauce ‚Äì I am an ardent fan of Caramel. The sponge cake was softer than sponge, if I am truly honest. Along with it, the took me to the seventh heaven. I am not even exaggerating a bit. This is true in every sense. Loved it. Actually I am in love with it.
Drinks -
Kiwi Mint Cooler
Raspberry Drink
Virgin Mojito
Orange and Passionfruit 
All of them were great but can be improved as well.
Phew! It‚Äôs a long long review. Will be glad if you read the whole stuff. Finally I would like to conclude it this way that Mamagoto is an excellent place to tickle your Pan Asian taste buds. The portions are commendable, taste is excellent, service is brilliant. So, do visit this place with you loved ones for the fun asian eating. Happy Dining! :)

Open your eyes and look around! Check who's in your town now...well...our dear Mamagoto, of course! An Asian food lover like me could not believe her eyes when the poster was launched. With minimal humdrum came this famous joint. Having stayed a year in Japan, this place reminded me of sheer happy days and good, hot food. God bless the owners for opening "the" magnificent joint here. Mamagoto, a well known brand opened doors somethime in October. 

Some black and white, some colorful images of sumo wrestlers adorn the glass walls and windows near the entrance, and the first floor windows. The tempo is electrifying. The ambiance colorful.  Ample seating arrangements, and hopefully a future bar greeted us. An open kitchen with busy chefs completes the decor bit!

Confession: I had never ever seen a quieter open kitchen than this. The chefs are all extremely well trained. They were churning out numerous dishes in seconds with no inconsistency in taste and quantity. A-m-a-z-i-n-g!!!

Of the zillion things we tried, touching down upon the absolute "not to miss" items!

- Crispy Lotus Stem: A bowl full of lightly fried lotus stems. Fried with some hot dry red chillies. A perfect crisper with no oil. Could not get enough of these!!!

- Rock Shrimp Tempura: The perfect tempura batter ever! Crisp, fresh, light, melt in the mouth. The perfect tempura ever. Accompanied with some dip.

- Hot Basil Chicken Cups: Pretty, cup shaped lettuce leaves with ample dollops of minced chicken servings accompanied with some house special thick, non-watery chilli sauce. Heaven in every bite!!

- Java Grilled Fish: A grill plate arrives on the table. In the center is the fish tied in a green leaf, not a banana leaf. A portion of rice and some batter fried veggies completes the plate. You open the paturi like leaf, and voila! A big whitest ever fish laced with some red chilli sauce greets you. The fish is soft, perfectly cooked, not smell at all, extremely thick, and perfect in quality and quantity. 

- If you enjoy your greens, try their snow peas and green bean salad, and their thai chicken water chestnut salad. The salads, ever crunchy, ever fresh. and quite filling!

Moving on to the mains, do try their:

- Pad Thai Chicken: Kolkata's best pad thai is served here. If you thought you knew the taste, think once more. Your taste buds will be surprised by the sheer richness of this dish.

- Steamed Fish in Green Chilly Sauce: Presentation excellent, color contrasts excellent. Beautiful white steamed fish fillets laced with not so hot green chilly sauce. Fresh, fish, taste, chilly - all in a bite!

- Prawn Three Pepper Bomb: Coated prawns fried and cooked in a gravy. The gravy was light and full of richness. Best eaten with steamed rice. The fried bit had not turned soggy surprising nor had it hardened by the time we ate it!

- Massaman Chicken Curry: A bowlful of happiness. The usage of coconut was perfect, it was not too light a gravy nor too heavy. The sweetness was perfectly balanced. and well well when eaten with piping hot steamed rice.

As we move onto the desserts, you ought to have space to try their mishti doi cheesecake, and their caramel sponge cake with toffee sauce. However much I talk about the latter, it will not be justified. The dessert seemed like a page out of the masterchef book. The toffee sauce was a perfect blend of sweetness and saltiness. The sponge cake was heavenly with that caramel topping. Accompanied with some vanilla ice cream. 

Writing about this place is not justified enough, you must, must visit this place as this place promises to surprise you in a new way, everyday!! :)

Happy eating at Mamagoto.. :)

"Noodles give me my good looksüòú"..well if  you also second this famous saying , please visit this newly opened restaurant  named as mamagoto.

The famous branch has opened an outlet in kolkata too and that too in the hub of the city.This place is right opposite park street thana and adjacent to the entrance of magma house.It serves you with asian and thai cuisine.The food is highly delicious and well recommended for all the asian food lovers.

Coming to the ambience, this place surely has the most quirkiest look with funky wall paints and most importantly highly courteous staff.

The famous black and white mama look in the entrance will surely amaze you.


Coming on to the food section, the menu is well made with quite a lot of vegetarian dishes to choose from.

We really got a good staff person to serve us named as Umesh ..(would recommend you all to suggest the owner to give you this guy as he was very very polite and courteous..all the other staff members were good too but just had a good image of this guy, maybe coz of the good service he gabe us!)..he looked tiny but he realy helped us in making a good choice of dishes as I was highly confused regarding what to order and what not to..I was very much keen to try the signature dishes and we were thoroughly satisfied with our order.


 
In the starters, we ordered for crystal dumplings , basil cups and crispy chilli potato..

The dumplings were extremely soft and well cooked  and the dip was spicy and yummy..

The basil cups was anothercrazy dish presented well with mushroom and basil flavour ..

Crispy chilli potato were basicaly tongue-licking crispy potato sticks seasoned well with sesame seeds.

In the main course , we ordered for chiang mai train station noodles which is the signature dish of this place..its like khowsuey with thai curry flavour and well cooked and garnished with chilli and garlic toppings.Worth a try!



Coming to the deserts , we were told to order the homemade cake with vanilla ice cream which was extremely soft and chocolaty and perfectly apt to end our good meal.

A must must try for all the chocolate lovers.


 
This place is one crazy place and must try for all the foodies...The ambience, food and music is just fantabulous..

I had a great weekend and I am sure you will have a rocking week ahead too...

Do drop in to this place and have a great week ahead!

Keep eating , keep feeding...

Mamagoto
¬†

Saturday, lunchtime at Mamagoto, like most new restaurants, was choc-a-bloc, noisy and buzzing. Looking at the people waiting mournfully for their tables, we patted ourselves for being smart enough to have booked ours 3 days ahead. A window table with the characteristic Sumo wrestler etched onto the glass saw us delightedly hollering hellos over the din and settle down to the delicious starters ‚Äì Crispy Lotus Stem & Chicken Basil Cups and Street Style Spicy Dumplings, all of which came with piquant dipping sauces.

We opted for Teriyaki Meal in a Bowl (Beef & Chicken) as well as Mamagoto Goreng ‚Äì sadly we couldn‚Äôt finish these three bowls between the seven of us! Next time around, I would suggest making a meal out of the Starters which were pretty filling, and go straight to the desserts.

We opted for Coconut Ice cream and Vanilla Ice Cream with a Caramel sauce to die for. We skipped the Home made cake with Caramel sauce and a couple of others but I think we are all going back for that Caramel Sauce sometime soon!

Visited for the first time, thanks to my daughter. No regrets. SUMMER ROLL with Basil Dip , was absolutely amazing, the flavour was exquisite and very delicately served, this followed with the PRAWN TEMPURA (garnished with burnt garlic) As was suggested by Rahul, our table Manager and then we got a bit adventurous and tried the Chicken  OSAKA Tube Station bowl which was absolutely divine. 
The Wasabi Virgin Mary was perfectly  spiked with wasabi, to leave that little tingling sensation after each sip. 
Happy Ambiance, very courteous Staff but could feel a bit of chaos around with the orders. May be some internal training of staff could help. 
Overall, a must visit for a  casual meal or make it special by trying speciality cuisine.

So went to Mamagoto last night.
The music was just loud enough to give a peppy feel and yet enable us to have a conversation unlike many other restaurants where one needs to shout to hear each other.
We ordered the basil chicken in lettuce and a prawn and chive dumpling for starters. Both were yummy and light, the accompanying sauces were great too.
For main course we had a steamed fish in a green chilli paste which was extremely spicy and garlicky (ok) and a tenderloin teriyaki with sticky rice which could not be faulted but yet lacked a certain punch.
The cocktail ordered was a lemon mint vodka with lemon zest and was fab!
Definitely plan to make this a regular haunt!

so i was sauntering on a saturday evening, dragging my feet on park street, when just past marco polo a bright signage almost beckoned me..unbeknownst to its presence outside of kolkata i took my chances..and it didn't disappoint
the managers were kind enough to spare me enough room for a single sit in..i went with the house recommendations and ordered for a teriyaki meal bowl..a generous portion arrived after not too much waiting at the table..the ambience looked feisty yet charmingly understated..the music however was a bit of a downer, too loud and club like..
food was a pleasing story all the way, and i am leaving the authenticity to the more discerning connoisseurs
mamagoto literally means playing with food..and thus the fun asian experience came to be..worth a visit? oh yes..but avoid the music as much as possible..it spoils the fun by being too 'fun'ky

I've always been one who appreciated the financially feasible aspect of restaurants in Calcutta. Most places I waddled into never set me back too much, unless of course I was walking in with my parents. This led me to appreciate cheaper restaurants which plated up incredibly tasty food. Inevitably, I rated them higher than I rated top class class restaurants serving delicious dinners. However, Mamagoto is an exception.

Having just returned from a week in Thailand, my buds weren't exactly looking forward to more Thai food. I originally heard about this place from a friend of mine who had tried out an outlet in Delhi. She convinced me that it'd be a great place to have lunch. I was all set to be critical and smash the quality-quantity-price mirror, when Mamagoto made it really hard.

The food was phenomenal. I don't remember having noodle bowls this good, ever. They're not authentic Thai, but that's the entire point. I ordered the 'A Thai in Hunan' and another rice bowl for the table. The former couldn't have been a better dish. Every element perfectly placed, every ingredient in perfect quantity. The rice bowl could've rocked me to sleep. When it comes to quantity, one bowl is enough to feed about 1.5 mouths. We ordered a couple drinks, mind you they're yet to receive a bar licence. The drinks were as good as I'd expect them to be, nothing extraordinary.

The service was good, but I've had better. The waiters were more polite than professional, in the sense that they weren't the most remarkable lot. In terms of courtesy, ten on ten.

The decor is also pleasant. Couple of flashy lights paired with Pan Asian art makes for decent company. The cutlery and crockery too could not be faulted. The issue was with the furniture. The normal seating seemed good, but the bar table and chairs were shaky. That's the last thing anyone needs while trying to eat. It's uncomfortable and quite frankly, amateur. The bar tables too are made to comfortably accommodate a single person. If you're a couple, it's just not worth it.

Another very unnerving thing was the music. While I do like retro music with food, I don't think it goes well at all with the Pan Asian food Mamagoto is serving. It's perhaps even too loud, which spoils the fun. I'd go to a club if I wanted really loud music.

The restaurant's on two floors and sitting on the upper floor is the obvious choice. Don't go for the bar tables if you're more than one, and don't sit too close to the speakers. Order anything, it's all delicious. The food is where Mamagoto manages to usher out any flaw that holds it down. It isn't the perfect dining experience, even though the fall under fine dining, but it's close.

For two people, expect to pay something around 1800.

Ambience/Interiors: 3/5
Service: 4/5
Food: 4.5/5
Value for Money: 3.5/5

Thanks for reading and pardon any grammatical errors I may have made.

It was a pleasant Sunday afternoon and a birthday in the family. So we decided to eat out and had to make a choice between two recently opened restaurants - Monkey Bar and Mamagoto.

Since we felt like trying pan Asian cuisine, we opted for Mamagoto and ended reaching there a little after 1 pm. The outside facade looked good - much of the ground floor is under renovation and the restaurant is in a small area on the first floor. There were two hostesses at the reception - one hostess in a grey uniform asked us all our details and went up to arrange a table for us. Two minutes later, she came down and told the other hostess in casuals that we were "looking for a table" (couldn't fathom what that meant). Hostess #2 then proceeded to ask us our details again which we had already shared with Hostess #1. After we pointed out that we had shared our details, hostess # 2 said that now we could be seated as we were on a 'priority list'. We trudged up the stairs to see that only 2-3 tables were occupied and the rest were empty. So why were we asked to wait and what priority list were they talking about?!
Welcome was inadequate - no smiles, no greeting, unpleasant vibe, unnecessary waiting time.

We got seated and the table was wobbly. The server tried to correct the uneven legs and spilled all the water. We had to ask for a change of table. The order was taken promptly but it took 25 minutes for the food to arrive. If you order Bophhut Hot Chicken Wings, please carry tissues as the fiery hot wings will make you cry (not tears of joy). The Spicy Bangkok bowl was good and the dish that saved the lunch. We had also ordered hakka noodles and London's China Town Prawns which were okayish. The mocktails were good - litchi pop rocks was a disappointment - too much ice, too little syrup.

The servers were polite and attentive but the welcoming and the food needs to be stepped up immensely. The prices are reasonable and the location is great but much more is expected out of this franchise.

Reception - 0/5 Absolutely awful. Two women (one in Grey dress and one in casuals) had no coordination. The one in casuals asked if we were "looking for a table" and asked me for my details twice which I already provided to the other lady standing next to her. If i was looking for a table, I would visit a furniture store. She was unwelcoming, inhospitable and disinterested. When we went upstairs there were only 2 tables occupied and the whole place was empty. The wait was unnecessary.
Ambience - 1.5/5 The decor is good but the small place has tried to accommodate too much. The tables are rickety and uneven. Makes you feel like you're in a permanent earthquake. One of our servers tried to adjust the table with paper below its legs which ended up spilling all our water on the table.
Food - 2.5/5 Food was average. When the reception is so inexperienced and weird, the food tastes bad.
Servers - 3/5 They were the only saving grace in the restaurant.

Calcutta mamagoto pales in comparison with the rest of the other places in India. The lady at the reception only entertains her friends or known guests. Would not recommend to my friends and family. In a business of hospitality, they have zero hospitality.

Suggestion - Visit other restaurants in Calcutta and learn from them how to manage your guests and administer the crowd.

Mamagoto has always been one of my most fav places for Asian food. Finally it has opened its door in kolkata and I couldn't be any happier, already been here twice. The sad part is that my most fav spinach tofu starter has been removed from mamagoto menu all over. The kolkata outlet has surprisingly matched the standards of other outlets.. quick efficient service. Last night the lotus stem was not made up to the standard and when notified they re tossed the same left over bowl with lot of red chilli which was not acceptable but on notifying they immediately got a new fresh one made up to mark. The lady manager is not warm and doesn't realise the importance of regulars and unnecessarily makes customers wait for no reason even after booking and empty tables availability which was certainly a mood kill. 
Ambience : good
Service: quick 
Food: yumm yumm yumm!
Value for money 
Must have: truffle oil dimsums , khowsuey, teriyaki bowl, toffee sponge cake!
One main is actually enough for two but I like variety and don't mind carrying a leftover bag home.
Must try!!

The food is amazing. It's quite spicy but very tasty and perfect with flavours. Tom yum soup to dumplings and starters to main course to deserts every course is excellent. It's a must go. There's something new to try every time it's got a lot of choices. The service is prompt very good and there's a mr Tiwari who makes the whole experience even more special.

Loved the food and service! The franchise certainly doesn't disappoint.. The menu is vast with both veg and non veg options. Loved the concept of them serving the complimentary fried chips with there soy which is to die for. I think I can drink it üòçI had the crystal dumplings which just melted in my mouth and my friends ordered their rainbow chicken dumpling and were happy with it as well. For main ,I went for the laksa tribute(noodle in a bowl veg) the quantity is perfect for two and my friends had teriyaki in a bowl (tenderloin) and couldn't stop raving how delicious it was! Again the quantity is so good that u don't have space for dessert . Definitely visiting again to try the other dishes and dessert. A big thumbs up!

The food is just too good. The only hiccup I can write about here is that they seemed too eager to turn tables. Kept trying to take away the plate I was still using. Also, brought us the bill without us calling for it, immediately after we ordered a dessert. I was thinking of ordering another one (because it was that good, and that I have a major sweet tooth) but before I could... lo & behold! The bill was placed on our table.

Would love to visit again regardless! :)

I totally loved the place. Awesome food. Though they have not yet got their bar menu but the food will impress you. We ordered a watermelon beach, a cranberry drink and a virgin mojito. We then ordered for prawn wrapped in bacon, java fish dish, crispy lamb, tenderloin rice bowl and banofee pie. The prawn, the desert and the rice bowl were too good.

This is of course not just any other restaurant in Park Street. I had a fulfilling experience coming here...
To start with, it was difficult getting a table for two on a Monday... The place was so full buzzing with people wanting to try this new place.... The place and decor are just perfect.... The staff, the hosts were very cordial and while ordering, made an extra effort in suggesting. Here, the food is very good.... 
Crispy Lotus Stem was amazing and recommended. We had also liked Crispy Dumplings and Teriyaki Meal in a bowl....Their Mocktails are very refreshing.
Definately a thumbs up in food taste and quality of dining....
Being bugged with Food Coma, the recovery kit is coming too handy. Thank you MamaGoto :)

Having sampled their fare in Delhi, I was super excited to hear that Mamagoto was finally coming to my city! Things to definitely try are the hot chicken basil cups, honey chicken, egg fried rice and London style chicken. Also the mamagoto take on the nasi goreng is a heart-warming meal in itself! Kudos to the great service too.

Located in park street the 13th outlet of mamagoto finally in kolkata. It has fun and nice interiors especially the stairs and some cute printed glasses in which they serve mocktails.. Food is really good and staffs are cordial. The only problem i faced was the way they had levied taxes on mocktails .Definitely a must try place.

Mamagoto- playing with food.... is the newly opened fusion Pan Asian restaurant on the Park Street. The Interiors are quite cool and funky with a cordial staff. This oriental eatery is part of a national chain spread over four cities. The food is really good with authentic Thai taste. 
We ordered Tom Yum soup which was one of the best we have had. The starters of Fried Lotus stem was quite good and the Veg basil cups served on lettuce leaf had all different flavours coming out very well. In the mains we had soggy Thai basil rice which was really awesome. 
The pricing is soups and starters from 200/- and the main 450/-
They are yet to get the liquor license thus one has to make do with mocktails only. 
Overall a pretty good experience.

Started off with crispy lotus stem which was awesome. Crystal dumplings wasn't too good. Old school gyoza dumpling was good. This green curry was nice and so was the Hakka noodles. Soggy Thai basil fried rice was really really good. Must try place !!
To end with - caramel cake and brownie with ice cream - ended the dinner on a sweet note !!

Mamagoto is known for the Thai food. Lemon grass and coconut based spicey food. Try the tom yum soup and the noodles in a bowl. Specially the the Laskar bowls and the Thai style bowls. The quantity is sufficient for two. The pocket pinch is also pretty moderate. We had ordered dumplings, a chicken breast marinated in thai spices and a noodle in a bowl along with a few mocktails and we ended up spending 2000 rs. Thai being my personal favourite and I have visited Mamagoto in Delhi, so it is highly recommended you go there :)

Mamagoto is one of my absolute favourite places and the Calcutta joint does not disappoint . Yesterday was my second visit to mamagoto with a friend who'd never tried the place before . He loved the place and could not stop raving about it . We ordered the crystal dumplings , penang curry , peach ice tea and the caramel sponge cake to end with . Every dish was perfect and tickled our tastebuds. The management was very friendly and offered the dessert to us complimentary . Would be sure to visit again without a doubt .

It's difficult to review Mamagoto because of extremity of the experience ranging from too good to too bad. While food and services were fine with few items being extremely good and few being average, But for the first time had such hopeless experience of valet parking. Delay of 25 mins in getting your car is not even the worst part. When we finally got our cars, one car's interior was totally drenched in mud and other cars exterior was drenched in mud. Don't know how they managed to do either of it. As in quite difficult to explain how precisely they executed the job of spilling mud on all sides of the car, and how the hell did they spill the mud in interior of the car. Initially they claimed that it was already dirty. But obviously understood that the fault was in their part and cleaned the car. Entire experience got spoiled.

A new kid in the block and what a fantastic entrance this is... Truly a game changer in Calcutta's restaurant world... 
Ambience is minimalist still you'll get a feel of that downtown pub of US... Though sadly they haven't got the liquor license yet... Wait for few days fellas... 
Food is awesome... Distinct taste and aroma which will leave you mesmerized... 
Service is very good with courteous staffs... 
Go for it asap...

Darun Chilo üëåFood was super tasty and subtly spiced, we ordered Osaka Ramen bowl (wish I knew the recipe).Spicy dumpling was the best I ever had anything that comes near is Yuatcha. Desert of Panko fried banana with ice cream was interesting. But not all the dishes were available and I was looking forward to having the truffle oil dumpling..decor was keeping with the theme and the people extremely courteous. Would be back...Thanks Mamagoto. .happy lunch on sad dashami day.
