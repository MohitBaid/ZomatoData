My all time favorite ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Spend 4 years of college eating food from la China. This small outlet is for those who would prefer take away or is fine with sitting on the side of road. You may not get well fashioned decor and cozy atmosphere but their food is great. The chicken hakka Noodles, garlic chicken hakka Noodles, pan fried momos, chili garlic chicken and yes the all time favorite chicken mayo roll are must try here ‚ù§Ô∏è

This a nice roadside food joint located near the Indian Art College in Dumdum . One can find a numerous variety of Chinese food . Their trade mark item 'Jungli Biriyani' is very spicy . I would recommend one to have a chicken mayo roll there , I find it very delicious . Thier combos are also very pocket friendly .

Had Ordered via swiggy for a Egg Chow & Chicken Steam Momo. Both taste good according to the rating of the zomato I think the food was definitely nice. But the bad thing only was the oil that they are using on Chow it's slightly have some smell on it. I requested that they could improve their oil. Overall the momo was comparatively well cooked. Overall I am happy.

If you are that foodie enough to tolerate spicy food.. then go for it.. I love the schezwan items there.. and trust me have the chicken steamed momos. They have the actual taste of North east- the place in India where Momos are the best! Have eaten their twice and ordered food twice.. some of the items are served at a considerable decent quantity  at a reasonable rate.. like 10pieces or so.. but you hav to eat it hot in case of fried rice.. else the taste will fade away.. Wat it lacks is a good sitting arrangement despite having items that is needed to be eaten sitting on a table.. not everything you order can be eaten on a buffet system... else its reasonable enough if we look at the quality of the food...

Its thought to be a Chinese restaurant but its actually a mixture of Indian and Chinese. Its a small eatery and visitors have to eat in open air. Chairs are available but there's no arrangement of tables. The rolls available are neither of Chinese style nor Indian style but it tastes delicious ignoring the fact that they put too much mayonnaise in it. Their noodles üçú taste good .

We had ordered food from La China Grill tonight on the ocassion of my brother's birthday. This was the WORST thing on which I have had spent my hard-earned money on.
Coming to the order, we had placed a bulk one. We had French Fries, Chicken Lollipop, Chicken Pakora and Chilly Chicken Dry for starters. For main course, we had Veg Chowmein, Veg Fried rice, Schezwan Chowmein and Schezwan Fried Rice along with Chilly Chicken, Schezwan Fish and Hunan Chicken.
First, I got notified by the delivery guy they had to replace my chicken lollipop by some item and he didn't even know the name of it. This shows the lack of professionalism. Then, to my surprise, the french fries was missing!
Coming to the taste of the food, the schezwan fish and chicken pakoda tasted good. All other items including that unknown one was so spicy that we couldn't eat half of what was on our plate. They had no taste at all. Absolutely no taste. The only thing it had was spice and more spice. It was way too spicy for a human being to eat.
Overall, a very bad experience. Didn't want his birthday dinner to get spoiled like this. Never gonna have food from this place again.

Taste is obviously not great but satisfactory at the rates in which they offer. Attracts a lot of college goers and a good place to fill your stomach at a reasonable price.

We ordered smoked chicken cheese roll, chicken omelet and chicken pakora. Smoked chicken cheese roll was too good and extraordinary also the omelet is. It take roughly 30min to prep that roll but as we are not in hurry we enjoyed that roll..  It is a must try for anyone.

Excellent Chinese food. This is a small fast-food shop but the taste of food is not less than any fancy restaurant. Prices are extremely pocket friendly and yet quantity is good. The mayo roll is one unique dish great for mayonnaise lovers. The combo offers are great. But one can only avail the combo when eating in the shop, take away facility isn't available for combo offers.

Well the one thing this place is lacking is the consistency to deliver good food every time. I liked their red pepper chicken and chicken manchurian. And there has been so many times that the quality keeps on improving or regressing like a sine curve. Another thing is its not very hygienic . But the price is moderate and the quantity ok. Their fried rice is okay. And the wrap rolls which they serve in rumali roti is at best okay. It feels good because of the mayo , but nothing special. Overall good food if you are lucky.

This afternoon it was HER demand to take her to a place which should be near to our place and cost very less. I searched in zomato and found La china grill. Had heard about this small joint a lot for its delicacy and serving all cusines of foods. To summarize the place -
1. Location - just opposite to motijheel art college. You have to take the lane opposite of Grihasree on Dumdum road
2. Interior - No interior decoration instead they have few plastic chairs outside to sit
3. Food - as heard before, really good. We ordered for chicken mayo roll which is prepared with romali rooti with chicken steaks, mayonnaise, onion and pudina chutney stuffing. Though I expected the whole preparation to be served hot but it was absolutely in normal temperature. Along with the roll, we also took one chicken schezwan chowmin. It was very spicy though not that oily.
4. Stuffs : More courteous than the stuffs of many fine dining restaurants.

Overall definitely worth a place for home delivery, they serve orders placed from zomato, swiggy and snapdeal as well!!

I've ordered dinner from here quite a no of times. Special mention would be their garlic chicken! Also, the fish and chips with the mayo sauce is one of all time evening snack favorites!
Overall, it's best to take away from here since there's not much place to sit and eat. I would highly recommend it!

This is a small joint that can be found near art college @Dum Dum.Even it is a small joint and only takeaway is available,the foods they prepare tastes very good and there are lot of dishes you can choose from to satisfy your taste bud.
I ate from this joint few times and they never disappoint me. The dishes that I ate are chicken mayo salsa roll which is a unique type of chicken roll with good amount of mayo which is wrapped in a rumal roti.Another day I ate chicken club sandwich that will make you hungry for more and next I ate pan fried chicken momo that cost only 100 bucks for ten pieces which I liked the most.
Few of my Friendz told me there are some inconsistencies in taste but till now I didn't found out but then also I didn't tried most of the dishes.Overall its economic and many people with tight pocket can enjoy different type of dishes.

The outlet is located @Dumdum, near Art College.
It's a small stall which overseas home delivery and dine-in on road laden chairs. 

The food prepared here is often quite nice and economic, although, there are often inconsistencies in cooking and quantity,  which leads me to give it a 3.0. 

Things that I generally like and people should try are:-
#Chciken Mayo roll(minced spiced chicken with Mayo and seasoning wrapped in rumali roti)
#crispy babycorn/chicken:- Nice sauce and generally well balanced. But, sometimes, the chef forgets about the word "crispy" while he cooks! :p 
#Gravy/ Hakka chciken noodles:- The gravy lacks a bit of salt, but, to be fare, it rather tastes quite good to me. Hakka noodles to is pretty decent! But, sometimes they are a bit selfish with putting a good quantity of noodles:D.
#Chicken cheese Mayo club sandwich:- A bit messy, but good balance of cheese, Mayo and minced mild spiced chciken.
The other curry dishes are most of the time value for money unless you expect something classy and royale...

Yesterday we had ordered for lunch from La China Grill restaurant (63/10/1, Dum Dum Road, Surer Math, Near Indian Art College, Dum Dum, Kolkata).

There were some critical issues which we would like to highlight as below:

1) The delivery guys were not at all courteous & in fact they didn't even bother to bring the bill with them. All they did was said the total amount verbally & collected payment in cash.

2) Food quality was horrible.

3) Although in my instructions it was specifically mentioned to deliver less spicy food & within 2pm, food was eventually delivered at 3pm & it was extremely spicy which further made the matters worse.

So suggest you all to refrain from ordering from this restaurant. Its just horrible!!!

La China Grill is a small take away joint very near my house. They offer a variety of chinese dishes and also their mayonnaise rolls are delish. I have on various occasions ordered sandwiches and rolls, which are quite good, full of fillings and also had lunch ordered from them consisting of noodles, fried rice, shezwuan chicken which was quite good. The quantity was also satisfactory given their price. The best item I liked from them was the shredded spicy chicken. Total yum town but the quantity of this particular dish is not enough. Maybe I liked it so much that I wanted more. Nevertheless it is a pretty decent place for snacks.

I have tasted their Mayo salsa rolls (both chicken and egg) and I just loved it. It is truly unique and unlike the other fastfood centres they use rumali roti as the base. I have also tasted their dry chilli chicken and chicken pakoda and I really appreciate the fact that they use a minimal coating of cornflour and the taste is really good. To sum up , within a reasonable price they offer quite decent food and service is also quite prompt. Good going :)

Lovely finger licking wrap roll , ufff loved it , really so yummmy
All the items r within budget , great quality awesome quantity , will defenately be back again and again

On my next few visit often the wrap was either cold like desert or not available ..

The last time I had bon garlic chicken which was good , but they disappointed with the noodles .. there noodles are thick noodles which I really didn't like ..

I would go there again but not for the noodles ever

I ordered Chicken stroganoff with rice. It was delivered within an hour as they had promised and no delivery charges. The quality of rice was not up to the mark. There were no mushrooms and very less vegetables. However, I must say the gravy tasted really good. You can give this version of the chicken stroganoff a try !

Who simply on earth is not fond of extra mayonnaise? NO ONE! (P.S-Not to mention the cheesy aftertaste the chicken roll from this place has!)
Simply put..innovation at its best. Who simply could've thought about replacing the drag fat gooey tedious traditional 'paratha' with 'rumali roti' huh? ANYONE? 
If you're expecting plush comfort then refrain from this place. But..if you're expecting something new..something with jaaz..then I can say you will not be disappointed. 
The most innovative roll I've ever seen. Period.
Bon appetite se√±or and senorita! :D

I have tasted their Mayo salsa rolls (both chicken and egg) and I just loved it. It is truly unique and unlike the other fastfood centres they use rumali roti as the base. I have also tasted their dry chilli chicken and chicken pakoda and I really appreciate the fact that they use a minimal coating of cornflour and the taste is really good. To sum up , within a reasonable price they offer quite decent food and service is also quite prompt. Good going :)

Had a combo meal of fried rice and chilly chicken. The rice was good, but the chilly chicken was soo tasty. But the quantity of the meal was not that much.
In short, the meal was pretty good and delightful.

Have been there two weeks ago... a small food joint ...dey prepared delicious dishes ..we ordered egg chicken mayo salsa roll , crispy fried chicken and smoked cheese chickn roll ...fantastic taste .they use rumali roti in place of parathas while making rolls which brings softness and uniqueness . Worth trying ...

It was on my wishlist for quite some time as its close to my house. Yesterday ¬†first time ordered from them, which was egg salsa roll, chicken chow and chili chicken dry. Our order came within 45 minutes and they didn't charge any extra cost. Im gonna order your other dishes soon :) Dry chili chicken was good surely better than any other street shop in dumdum, where many think just frying chicken with bason and pour some sauce it'll become chili chicken. Chow was also good but i personally feel more salt needed.
Egg roll was for my didun and she also quite liked it. Im ordering again :)

I have been ordering food from this quaint little food joint, almost right from it's days of inception.I must say this once and for all, however many food joints I visit in Kolkata or how many uptown restaurants I throng, this particular place would always be one of my favorites.They serve exceptionally healthy and tasty food and at incredibly low rates too.Their special mayo rolls are to die for, and with the instance of they being wrapped in wheat chapatis, the health conscious get to heave a sigh of relief as well.Almost all their dishes are good, especially the crispy fried chicken and the chicken coleslaw sandwich.But it is their rolls that take the cake away.On most days, I survive only and only on their rolls!Do try this place.It will change your perception about good food being served at little joints.

This place is situated near my home only still i went there only 2 times. This place looks almost like a take away counter. A small joint...but pricing is definitely not low. The huge bucks they ask for the small and bogus preparations of theirs is definitely worthless. First time it was only for the momos..5 pieces for 50rs. People would probably expect stuffed chicken inside but no..they filled the entire thing up with onion and gave hardly small 1-2 pieces of chicken..we literally had to scrounge through the thing to find out whether they had actually given us chicken momo or confused our order with veg momo. Keeping that aside,we thought of giving it another shot. Went there for the 2nd time..disappointed again. Ordered for 1 plate chicken fried rice. They hadn't even used basmati rice to make the preparation! Fried rice without basmati rice makes no meaning..you aren't having any comfortable seating arrangement for your customers,moreover pricing is nothing less than any other decent local restaurant,preparations are worthless..in rice they didn't even put enough pieces of shredded chicken..why does your pricing doesn't match your preparations? Really disappointed with this place..swore to never visit again!!

located near surer math this is a small food joint with only take away service..

to b honest i visited this place after seeing the variety in the menu on zomato..the shop itself was very small but it didn't stop the cook to create a large number of preparations..the sandwiches are good..and the quantity of fried rice u will get is really good..but the only bad thing r the rolls..who the hell puts mayonnaise in rolls?? i had egg chicken mayo salsa roll which was really yuck..apart from that the shop is quite good..oh yes and the chilli chicken is quite nice too..

u will also get home delivery so thats a plus point for such a small sized shop.. :-)

Went there today. If you expect ambience you wont get it as it is a small food joint.
Food was good. Quantity was ample. Price was reasonable. We ordered a potato salad sandwich, small crispy baby corn and small chicken hakka noodles. It was more than enough for the two of us. Bill was rs.150.
But the service was bit late. It took about 25 mins to serve us. Behaviour of the staffs were ok.
So for the food, its definitely in my revisiting list. But take away will be prefered by me

i'm a big foodie and i stay very close to this place.......... whenever i was home earlier i used to get really cranky as i never got decent food anywhere near.... but then one day i found out about this place on zomato and decided to try it.... and from that day i'm a lover of this place......... they serve some real delicious food and the usp is the quantity of the food ...... if you order one plate of noodles .... two person can easily share it............ the quality of the food is too good....... ¬†and they serve some fusion rolls which nobody else serves here.......... all in all if you stay near dum dum and claim yourself as a foodie you should try this place for sure......

We opted for a home delivery. The manager or the call attendant said that it would take 45 minutes from ordering, but we had to wait for more than 2 hours for the food to arrive. They were not even sorry for the delay, had to call them up 2 times.¬†
No complaint about the quantity though. Considering the quantity, the price is cheap. Decent taste, specially the dry chili chicken was really good.

This place has got amazing food. Thanks to Soumodeep ( See. I mentioned you :P ) for letting me know about this wonderful place that existed near my house which I knew nothing about.
Well, the Smoked Chicken 'n' Cheese Roll is beyond words and totally fulfilling. Although this food-joint is quite reasonable, it was worth 90 bucks (it's 100 now in the updated menu)
On numerous occasions I had ordered food from here and by far I've not been disappointed with the food compared to their price and quantity.
The Dry Chilli Chicken is the best here. A must try!
Other items ordered-
Sandwiches: There is balanced amount of cheese and mayo in them and they are absolutely delicious

Schezwan Fried Rice & Schezwan Chicken: The schezwan items here should be avoided. They are not tasty and too full of spices

Crispy Chilli Baby Corn and Crispy Fried Chicken: Really very good

Smoked Chicken and Cheese Roll: The first time I tried it, it was absolutely delicious with cheese and chicken in every bite. But later the taste degraded.

It's a little hideout.. as per other's recommendations, I tried egg chicken mayo salsa roll.. well frankly, appearance wise it was not great! Actually in stead of paratha in conventional rolls, they use rumali roti.. however once I dug into that, it felt like a blessing! Totally mind blowing.. haven't tried other items.. but this one is totally awesome.

Hello friends..
I think I m going to be the first to write about this place.

First of all, this is not a dine in restaurant, so take away is must ( they have arranged some chairs under the open sky for those who want to have a bite in hurry or hungry ;) ). In Mexican items there items called "Salsa -roll"  which are not actually taste like  rolls. Other than this I loved their Chinese dishes (veg Hakka noodles, hot garlic fish). I have not tried much yet ..... ...expecting to try other items very soon. Quantity of the food is good enough, Quality is nice but please don't expect much from roadside eatery. Prices of the dishes are neither too cheap nor too high.......it seems acceptable.

I recommend you to try their Chinese  side dishes (dry).....

I tried there dishes when they just started. First i take way and later home delivery.Both way there service is good.But the cost of the product is quite expensive.No doubt for a party its quite good but for single person its expensive. Most of the item still not available anytime u asked them. Like sweet & sour soup,chicken lollypop, and so many. They should remove those time or they should serve us.
