Situated on little Russel street, its a tiny eatery slightly short on space but i have mostly ordered home delivery from them and i‚Äôm quite a regular customer. 
My staples consist of; 
~ Veg Pan fried Momos- these are my absolute favourite and i think its one of the better ones in town. A MUST HAVE for those who like things spicy. Highly Recommended 
~ Veg Chilli Garlic Noodles- Also quite nice but very very spicy. Warning; for those who can‚Äôt have too much spice you would want to skip this one. Since their sauces are pre-made they can‚Äôt alter the heat level too much. 
~ Veg Lunch Packs- comes with the option of fried rice or noodles along with manchurian and 2 steamed momos. Economical and good portion size too. 
Their delivery is prompt and at a nominal charge.

This place is for all the people who would love to have a good plate of chinese food without spending much from their pocketüòÄ. It's a small A/C restaurant in the midst of the crowded place in russell street. It doesn't has a lot of tables as the place is small but yeah if you are lucky you will definitely get a good table always like i doüòÇ. I went there with my friends and had taken veg fried rice, veg hakka noodles and chilli chicken. First of all the quantity was really good and so was the taste so that's really a good thingüëçüòÅ. The veg fried rice was well cooked and tastyüòÄ. The veg hakka noodles wasn't sour and was amazing in tasteüòÅ. And the chilli chicken was also very tasty but a little sweet, so if you are a spicy food lover then while ordering you can tell them to make it spicy and you are sortedüòÄ. Overall i loved this place and i go there often to satisfy my chinese cravings as it is near my collegeüòÄ. I would definitely recommend this place to allüëçüòÅ.

One of the best pan fried momos in town!!
Extremely affordable for the quantity they provide. Their lunch packs are a steal at that cost. And not to mention the extremely prompt service. Having lunch from them for a long time as my office is close by. And yes, the chilly chicken they making is just lip smacking, not to mention the chicken fried rice. Hidden gem of Kolkata

This is 5 mins from Maidan metro. Good place for momos. However the interiors are very dull. They need to  put up some more lights.  Pan fried momos tastes great.

Buzz is an old favourite for office goers,college people and shoppers around who hop in for a a quick tasty meal. This is located near metro plaza shopping arcade just opposite of saima. The place is a small one with sitting capacity of around 15-17 people. My friend & I went there yesterday after office to satisfy our hunger. Since we were not keen to have a heavy meal,so we opted for just starters. We had the following:-

1. Chicken steamed momos - 6pcs of generous stuffing of minced chicken and onion were given with a bowl of clear spring onion soup. The steamed momos were however dry from the inside and lacked the juicyness which indicated over-boiling of the dish. One must have the momos with the chilli paste condiment given in the table to have a spicy taste. The soup was also average. Addition of chopped vegetables would help bringing out the flavours in the soup in my opinion.

2. Pan fried chicken momos - This was delicious and we liked it more than the steamed version for obvious reasons. Again 6pcs of spicy momos wok tossed in pepper schezwan sauce. The texture of the dish was equally great. Recommended!!

3. Chilli pepper chicken - Originally we wanted to have drums of heaven but unfortunately it was unavailable so the server recommended us to have this dish. The dish had 8pcs of medium sized chicken fried & tossed in spicy schezwan pepper sauce and spring onions. Tastewise we liked the dish very much,the balance of flavours were really well maintained.

The pocket pinch was on the lower side with us bearing Rs 160 per head. No extra GST is charged in the final bill. The server was very prompt & active to cater our needs. Will go back to try their mains!!

The waiter there thinks of himself to be a super man. His condiments set was dirty full of flies, as we asked to replace it or give just the chilly sauce in another saucer or plate, he refused it directly and said since 15 years it's always like this. He doesn't know how to talk to the guest.
Just because of such stupid waiters the restaurant always gets a bad name and they closed down.

This place is located in Ho Chi Minh Sarani; a few steps away from Metro Plaza. I visited there a couple of days ago with a friend. We ordered chicken pan fried momo. The momos were absolutely delicious. We were in a hurry so we couldn't order anything else. But I am definitely going back there to try out the other dishes on the menu. This place is small but very clean and hygienic. The service is quick. Good place to stop for a quick bite.

I have been to this small Chinese cuisine restaurant several times. It has just four tables seating four each and one two-seater.

I like the steamed chicken momo and the gravy noodles (mixed) is fabulous.

They make lunch pack too and I ordered that. Though the fried rice was good, the chilli chicken was of street quality and didn't feel Chinese. I was disappointed.

I visited it yesterday with colleagues for lunch. I ordered Chilli Pepper Fish as starter and mixed fried rice, mixed hakka noodles and Dragon Chicken (upon waiter's recommendation) for main course. The Chilli Pepper Fish tasted like a Indo-Chinese fusion dish because of the seasoning. As expected it was spicy but not overtly so. It had eight succulent pieces of basa fish (which I'm not fond of) but it tasted decent as we had it hot. Since I like Chinese flavours, the fusion flavour wasn't much to my liking.

The mixed fried rice and the hakka noodles were tasty and both were loaded with egg, chicken and prawns (much bigger in size than usual) just as I like it. The portion size was good for one person.

I didn't know that Dragon Chicken was actually an Indo-Chinese fusion food. I had wanted a moderately spicy chicken dish. It was dry and thickly seasoned and the flavour was predominantly Indian. It had coriander leaves and curry leaves. The taste failed to please me again. It had about ten small pieces of chicken, so the portion size was good for sharing.

There's only one service staff who does everything. From cleaning up a table to taking payment. He is quick and efficient.

Overall, a value-for-money joint that's good for momo and staples.

My family had ordered takeaway from Buzz. We have ordered from here quite a few times and have loved their quality of Chinese food. This time we had ordered , "chicken steamed momos" , "mixed haka noodles" , "chicken fried rice" and "chilli chicken".  I don't ever pick hakka over gravy noodles at any restaurant but I love their quality of noodles and the way they prepare it. The mixed noodles has big pieces of shrimp and its delectable . The fried rice is equally good . I love how they use sauted and seasoned chunks of chicken in all their main dishes. As far as the momos and chilli chicken is concerned , I've had better. It's good but not something that makes my tastebuds tingle for more . I would highly recommend this place for pocket friendly takeaways and more so for their mains.

Inhumanity at its Best..

First time we entered this place.. It was raining lightly and weather was so pleasant so we thought of ordering for some Momo's.. Since we were running out of time so I ordered a take-away for a Combo Meal (In the Menu it's mentioned that Combo meal is for TAKE AWAY ONLY).. As the parcel was ready rain started pouring very very heavily.. I requested the restaurant staff to allow us to have the take away inside the restaurant as it was raining hard.. N water was logged every where.. To our horror, The staff
started fighting with us yelled that we cannot have food inside the Restaurant.. We were Surprised.. We requested that understand the situation but he will not let us open the Parcel.. The water was so much that it was entering the restaurant.. Such a water logging and rain but the hotel staff did not allow to have food. After repeated requests his senior person (owner most probably) came and he shouted even more that we can't eat the Parcel in the Restaurant.. In the Restaurant there are 6 tables and all the other table also Guests requested the Staff to allow me to open the Parcel and let me eat.. As we can't go out and food was getting cold..

The owner asked us not to have food as it was not allowed. And we should wait till the rain stops N water goes down the drain then we can go out and eat the food..

Finally we ordered for New Food and then we ate the food inside the Restaurant.. With our Parcel kept beside us..

Such inhumanely behavior I have never seen before by the Staff and Restaurant of a Old Joint as old as 12 Years..

For the value for money customers, this small, non-descriptive place near theatre road and chowringhee is a gem. But, despite being small, the basics are in place. The AC is chilled, service is fast and portion size is decent. The taste may not be among the best in town, but overall, the experience is good. I'd suggest to go for their mixed noodles gravy and ginger prawn. The gravy noodles, though slightly watery, has got a generous dosage of shrimp and meat and is a must have. The american chopsuey is another favorite of my family (though I don;t like the dish).¬†

The taste factor is overpowered by the portion size and ingredient quality and we love that- period.¬†

Overall, for a quick lunch, definitely recommended.

We have been to this restaurant quite a number of times simply because it is situated bang opposite to our tuition classes! :p 
Although the service is not good here and the staff is really arrogant... the food served here is quick and tasty.
There is just one server out there due to which one will have to wait a little for placing their order . This place is a small eatery with just 4 to 5 tables and one will have to share table if the place gets crowded! A drawback on this issue because a group of 3 or a duo will not want to share tables with any random people!
Coming to food- We have tried their Hakka chow, Veg munchurian, Chilli paneer, veg steamed momos, veg pan fried momos!
Out of all this the pan fried momo and the hakka chow makes a great combo!
The quantity is really good for the price they serve food at!
If you are in this area and want to eat some chinese food wihout any fuss then you can head over to Buzz .. :)

The only reason i am giving it 4.5 rating is not only its food, but the cost. We ordered szechwan (veg) noodles, chili garlic (veg) noodles, hot garlic paneer and a cold drink ; which costed us within 500. And the quality and service both were very good. This is such a gem in that area that getting vacant seats is a challenge at times.

Quantity is justified. Talking about the ambience, the place is not very spacious but its acceptable. Will recommend surely. Pocket pinch is very reasonable. All this came for just Rs 555 (including taxes) which is a value for money.

The timings are too odd of this place. Like 3-5pm it remains closed due to cleaning and then closes down early at night. The seatings are also less.

Buzz is my favourite around this area.
Both the ambiance and service is friendly.
Food is awesome here!
I have never had such tasty Veg Hakka Noodles elsewhere. I prefer their noodles more than their rice, though both are undoubtedly good.
I like their garlic chicken but this last time they had made it a bit sweet.
Drums of Heaven. Pepper Chicken.
Their Chicken Thukpa with Dumplings is also good.

Price is very reasonable given their quality of food.
Very much recommended!

I came here with a friend today to have Chinese food without burning a hole in our pocket.Thanks to zomato we found this place.Its a small place in Little Russel Street.The decor is simple..but the place is tidy with soothing lighting.The menu is very simple but it's really good.

We had a Hakka noodles(mixed) and a hot garlic chicken.

Hakka noodles-It was very good.The meat and prawn pieces in it was quite big and very fresh in taste.It was not much on oily side which I liked a lot.The seasoning was spot on.But the portion was too small even for 2 girls.

Hot garlic chicken-It had 8 big chicken pieces which were very soft and not overly coated with cornflour.The gravy had a good balance of sweet and spicy taste which we liked a lot.

Food came in quick but there was only 1 person serving all the customers.So there were at times no one to fill the glasses of water when it was needed or clear the empty serving plates.This should be improved.

I ordered a Dry Chilli Chicken from Buzz through an online food delivery app. ¬†

There were 8 boneless pieces of chicken and it was little spicy. Loved it!¬†

Price : Rs. 175.

Was recommended by friend, and so we landed, supposed to be good food, and I was they were correct, JUST ONLY GOOD and nothing great. I don't even feel like talking of service, cos I will surly not visit this place again, not only me but even of some more who were sitting around, as I could see the displeasure on their face too. Total put off

A very small and always full eatery this is always buzzing with customers but one should always order in from this place than seat and eat as there is a huge difference in the quantity of food they serve. 
The delivered food is a lot and although the taste is fine in both the cases but if you visit the place to eat be sure to spend double as the quantity is very less.

This little eatery caught my notice while i was crossing the road with my friend. We decided to drop in for a lunch and were not disappointed. We ordered egg chow with hot Garlic chicken and Chilli fish.The food was very tasty ,esp the fish. The price is also quite low in comparison to its quality and quantity.The behavior of the staffs are very nice.Would love to visit again.

Tasty Chinese and great quantity at dirt cheap price is what Buzz is all about. I love their momos. Other favourites will have to be their hot garlic chicken with szechwan mixed rice. But the absolute show stopper is the chilli pepper chicken and the thupka! Must have.

This restaurant is famous just because of its cook. The food is awesome. My corporate office being in this area, we most of the time order food from this joint for our lunch. All the time they were able to satisfy us very well. So we decided to go to this joint and have food instead of ordering. But unfortunately the service boy is disgusting. We a people of 12 ppl went there, firstly he thinks himself over smart, dont know how to speak to customers, and could not take order properly. When served us our order and when we said that you didnot give us one more item, he abruptly said we didnot give the order. He is really disgusting. The service was more than worst. Itz take away is good rather than sitting there and have food.

The thing about Buzz is that you've got to time it right!!...i went there with my girlfriend sometime between 1-2 pm and our timing was so impeccable that there was just a table for two waiting for us!!...only 4 tables in total i think...and that's about it for the downsides!!!

It took us quite some time to find...it's a small joint located near ho chi min sarani
The guy serving us was the closest to a real life "flash" you're ever likely to come across..he is all smiles all the time, well mannered and really really swift!!!

we had ordered veg and chicken momos(fried) which were excellent...we then shared a plate of egg noodles(gravy) and a one schezwan potato...being a non-vegetarian myself i have to admit, i didn't know potatoes could taste so brilliant!!..the quantity was enough to make both me and my girlfriend feel full to the brim!!

i really hope you guys can open another bigger outlet somewhere(anywhere)!!!...otherwise, this place deserves to be one's regular pocket friendly hangout if you're near park street, really hungry, and with some good company(some waiting is mandatory)!! :P

Just had a soup in this food joint. However I must say that the soup tasted quite good and can match the quality of places know for soups. The only thing that bothers is the waiting time coupled with the service. I had to wait nearly 45 minutes post placing the order to get the food, but the quality and taste of the soup made me forget the same. Yet to try other dishes but got some positive reviews regarding the same. Hope others have a good time.

Yes, you saw it right - I gave 5 points to an  inconspicuous Chinese joint in Russel street. I won't lie - had I been just passing buy, chances are 0 out of 100 I'd drop in. But luckily I happen to work close by + I am a lazy hater of tiffins = I eat out more often than my stomach n wallet think I should. 
Let's make it clear , we have 2 kinds of Chinese in Kolkata. The high profile ( and often bland like a 50 year old British bachelorette ) and the take-me-to-streets food, with packed punch of flavours ( and solid oil and ajinomoto load). For me Buzz is somewhere in between , and is simply on my top 5 list of Chinese restros in the city. 
I'll talk about delivery as till date I haven't eaten there.
Food is always delivered hot, fresh and in no time. Flavours are balanced and seasoning is not overwhelming - you do taste prawns, chicken, rice, veggies , gingers all separately and at the same time balanced and complimenting each other. Sane amount of oil and spice.
And their noodles and rice - man, the amount of veggies/ chicken/ prawns they put can beat some high profile big brothers in the dining scene. 
My favourites: Thukpa ( mostly chicken) - undoubtedly THE BEST thukpa I've eaten in Cal and I tried it in many places cuz I love it unconditionally. 
Red pepper chilli chicken - delicious fire of flavours in my mouth with succulent pieces of meat. Yum. Can eat just like that. 
Mixed noodles / rice ( any) - a meal in itself. Chicken rice is also very tasty. 
Blah dish : steamed momos. Never. Ever. Order them there. 
And the best thing ( if those are not enough, greedy foodie ) - their prices which are hard to beat for the huge amount they serve. Long live the Buzz, for I haven't had my earthly fill of Chinese yet .

Favourite Chinese place for the broke days (very frequent for college goers like me). 
I have been a faithful customer of this restaurant since more than a year now. The pan fried momos are lip smacking! Prawns are fresh and juicy!
My all time favourite dish at Buzz is the American Chop suey. It's delicious and super filling!
Pros: 
1. Super cheap 
2. Amazing food 
3. Good quantity 
4. Very homely 

Cons: 
1. The place is very small with only 5 tables. We often have to wait outside.

Hungry, tired and desolate in culinarily deprived Ho Chi Minh Sarani my bestie and I came along here after a bout of shopping. It was just around 5 when we entered, and immediately noticed the clean, simple ambience of the place. 
I ordered a Chicken Thukpa for me to soothe my not -so- well stomach, and she chose the Mixed Hakka Noodles.
Our orders came in really fast and smoking hot, in less than 15 minutes! 
My thukpa was definately a warm hug in a bowl. A well made stock, minus any thickening, filled to the brim with chicken, beans, carrots, spring onions, cabbage and then with flat rice noodles was simply so divine. With a generous hit of chili paste and soy sauce, it hit the spot. The serving was very hefty too, one bowl made me feel like bursting to bits! 
My friend's noodles were done with equal generosity and finesse: Big fat shrimp, copious amounts of chicken and scrambled egg, spicy and not too hot with chewy fat noodles with a smoky wok char. 
The waiter cum manager was one of the best in his creed that I've ever seen. And that counts the big stars in the industry too. He was attentive yet non intrusive, smooth and such a superb multitasker. Hats off to you! 
Our bill came to no more than 300 for 2, tax inclusive, and now I really do not have a reason not to love Buzz.
I'll be back, I know!

I visit Buzz quite often and dig in to their pan fried momos and noodles and chicken dishes...I tried their fish dish but its kinna average...but be it chicken..or rice or noodles and specially momos... you'll start licking your fingers....and if you really want to have a meal peacefully visit the place around 7 in the evening...you'll get to relish your food pretty well...I really love going there.... and if you haven't visited buzz yet..please do...you'll love their food..

I am regular to Camac Street and Theatre Road and adjoining areas for shopping since school days.Each time after a tiring shopping spree ended up eating street food.Always felt there is a dearth of small eateries around. In-spite of walking by Buzz a million times don't know why never eva thought of exploring may be because of its exteriors.
This time on a friends recommendation after a tiring Durga Puja shopping session straight landed up here.
Very small inside ,can accommodation 15 people at a time.

Coming to food we ordered Chinese Chopsey and Hot Garlic Chicken.
Food took ten minutes to arrive.
I was bowled by the quantity.We ordered one Chinese Chopsey and it arrived in two plates .Th waiter confirmed me that its one plate divided into 2.
I must say its perfect Chinese Chopsuey not too bland not too sweet and ¬†it was perfectly complimented by the Hot Garlic Chicken .

The place is really a Hidden Gem which I discovered after a decade and more.

Surely coming back on my next Shopping Spree.

P.S:The waiter cum Manager is very well behaved .Highly recommended.

Now coming towards the food,we ordered chicken talumein soup which was yummy we made it 1/2. It was really tasty. Then we ordered Cantonese style prawn gravy noodles with hot garlic fish dry. The combo was good , it was a combination of spicy and normal. All over very nice experience and a must visit. (Y)

You can simply never get tired from visiting this place every once in a while. The place is pretty small with a single staff working so efficiently that you start wondering about yours multi tasking capabilities.

I don't find this place to be a cafe or a restra either. It's kind of those eating joints. Food here is normal Chinese street food kind off, not those authentic kind off even. Ambiance is not a pleasant one and makes you wonder where have you landed, rather than concentrating on the food. Overall I dint feel this place to be anything more than a street fast food centre, the only difference being that the waiters in a suited uniform, comes to serve you. Not at all value for money!!

Might be a little biased review as I have spent some of the best times having lunch with the best friends/colleagues here.

Located opposite Saima near Jyoti Vihar and the newly opened Gabbar, the place is a delight in terms of understatement. No frills, whatsoever but some delicious pan fried momos and fried rice/noodles - typical no-nonsense chinese at rock bottom prices that makes this a joint for frequent lunch visits.

Tip - Buzz chinese tastes awesome with Thumsup.

P.S. The waiter alternating in blue and red ties is a gem of a person. Fast but never furious.

Located in a strategic location at Ho Chi Minh Sarani, pretty near to Camac Street, American Embassy and Tata Centre, Buzz is one of my favorite food joint of that area. As it is mainly located in an office area, during lunch hours till 4 pm and sometimes in the evening its mostly remains full and you had to wait outside for maximum 10-20 minutes to get inside. But I wont see this as a drawback ¬†because they offer such a good and quality food, this wait time and crowded all time is worth. The inside space of Buzz is little small with only a few tables and less staffs to serve you, but inspite of that, they serve your order pretty fast once you are in and ordered your food. How much crowded it is, ¬†they attend each and every customer with equal priority and always has a smile on their face. The price range is average and food quantity is really great. If you take one plate of rice or noodles, it can be easily shared by 2 people. All items here are equally good, but my favorite is mixed chowmein and chilli chicken. The mixed chowmein is always full of scrambled egg. chicken pieces and prawns and the chilli chicken pieces are big enough with less cornflower batter and taste is just awesome. You may feel a bit irritated waiting outside for sometime but when you'll get to enter after waiting for may be 10-20 minutes and get to have such awesome food, trust me, all your anger will melt away and you'll really feel it was worth waiting.

A little further down Kenilworth Hotel Buzz will surely make your stomach buzz in a good way.Thought of giving 3.0 but an extra 1.0 for the quantity they serve and for the only guy who serves,takes order,makes the bill and does all other things.Salute man.

Chilli pepper chicken with 8 tasty pieces was fantastic and Singapore noodles just had lots of chicken pieces just as one expects.The price makes you hungry specially in the soup variety.14.5% tax also needs to be paid.

Beautiful combo of a quantity and quality of food that this place offers. Best food within the price range. Ambience and Interiors are not too attractive and this place is indeed a hidden gem. A seating arrangement of about 20 people at most and cozy surroundings. I saw only one waiter and he was too good. You just can't have any complaints. Service is fast and efficient, staff is really sweet and polite. Food is really really good. I tried chicken taulmein soup and chicken thai soup , and both were good. Thai chopsuey was surreal. Chicken pan fried momos are awesome. Maybe the best tibetian food at such cheap price. I even packed food for my home and I got to admit that they packed the food so well. Best part is that packing charges are so cheap.

We often visit Buzz as it is very close to our college.They serve pocket friendly and tasty dishes. Their pan fried momo is just awesome. In one word, this place is a saviour. But most of their dishes have same kind of taste.

This place is literally buzzing everyday. Best place to order food on Little Russel Street. Almost every item is tasty and pocket-friendly. The drums of heaven, hakka noodles and the different types of soups are ordered most of the times. Be prepapred to share the food with your friend, as being able to finish a plate of noodles or rice all by himself will be a daunting task.

Located right beside the Kenilworth Hotel, Buzz became our go to place for a quick bite during lunch hours. It's a small place, so expect waiting outside for a place. Food's good and the chicken with cashews & mushrooms is one of my favourites. Surprisingly the place is serviced by only one person, but still service is pretty fast!! Good place to go if you are looking for good food that's easy on the pocket

Wanted to have Chinese on lunch time, so we decided to go to this joint cos it's close by. Very small joint and no tables were available and we have been to informed to wait for 20 minutes outside. But finally we managed to grab a table and ordered food. Service was really quick which was not expected. Ordered various items and among them I surprisingly received my dish, called Singapore mixed noodles and let me clear that was regular fat noodles not Singapore slim noodles and it was totally sweet in taste, was beyond my expectation. Otherwise all dishes were just average.

This place is a bit little and cosy. Very very less accomodation you can say. But the food they serve are more. I had chicken chopsuey and dragon chicken. It was very different compared to any chinese food. Good service. And ambience can't really say the same. There is nothing as such good or bad ambience. Its just okay. If you are hungry and you are somewhere around this restrau come sit, eat and go. :)

They only serve to people regular to the outlet. I was denied service because I didn't order anything that involves rice or noodles, when insisted I was asked to wait for an hour by a overly smart waiter who expects new customers to know they don't give a damn if you walk out of the restaurant. I heard the food is good but the customer relations and service is worthy of a street side joint. Not going back ever back.

Hi friends,
This is one of the few places where you will get value for money.. prices are on the lower side but quality is great. Try out the fried momos here(the best). If you are looking for chinese i will suggest any soup then mixed hakka chow and chilli pepper chicken. I have never seen such big prawns anywhere in mixed chow as they serve here.  In a nutshell this restaurant is pocket as well as taste bud friendly.
However the place is small with seating for like 16-18 people.

If you want good Chinese food and which does not cuts a deep hole in your pocket...buzz is the place for you. Tasty chinese food and in really good proportions is the USP of the place. No points for the ambience though coz it's an average food joint. A special mention to the chilli lamb....it is absolutely scrumptious and I definitely recommend to one and all.

A nice place to kill your apetite,we ordered mixed fried rice,a steamed chicken momo and a thai soup ,the quantity was good for two,though the momos were average not giving the authentic taste as we thought of but was good,the mixed fried rice contained good amount of chicken and prawn,and the thai soup was good again but I think that the blue poppy nearby serves much good quality than this. Overall food was good and ambience was simple and soothing,might visit again

Buzz is a popular small eatery with delicious chinese, thai cuisines. The place is small but is always full with people. The demand is always high and if you happen to go in the afternoon you are most likely have to wait for your turn as it stays full. Also if one goes later in the afternoon, you may not be getting all the food items like chicken momos in our case, as they may be over by then. It provides fresh food, delicious, that excels in both quality and quantity, and is also more or less pocket friendly. ¬†The service is also quite quick and good They also provide a combo meal for take away. Though I haven't yet tried that, but it looks good, filling and pocket friendly.

This one is very popular if you work near Park Street area. Ideal place to have lunch for office goers. The thali is very very filling which comes in a choice of noodles or rice with a chicken dish and momo. But the thali is just for take away. When it comes to fried rice.. chilly chicken and the usual Chinese food, the taste is amazing. Its a tiny joint and very economical. Wait time is a little more than 20 minutes on a weekday.

Buzz is a small setup that serves delicious food at a pocket friendly price. My personal favourites are chicken momos and chicken drumsticks (both fried & gravy). I have ordered almost everything on the menu card and surprisingly loved most of the items. The taste of the food is so good that it can easily beat any famous restaurants; so I make frequent visits whenever I'm in and around this place. The food is generally served within no time and I have never been disappointed by the quality of the food or the service of the wonderful staff who serve with a smile. Kudos to the team! Keep up the good work guys ?

A snuggy little joint, Buzz has much to offer to tickle the taste buds of food enthusiasts at a reasonable price. Be it pepper chicken, or pan fried chicken momo, or plain steamed momo, noodles or any other item,from their huge array of their hunger enhancing menu card, Buzz leaves you buzzing about the wonderful taste. And since the pocket pinch is not a pinch at all, but a gentle caress, one is likely to visit this place if he is near Maidan. I definitely am.

In short a nice eating joint at russel street...maintained by one single man who takes the order serves the food n cleans the table but always greets people with a smile...

A few places deserve a 5.0 rating and even fewer places deserve that more than this one. A small restaurant located smartly at the junction of Russel street and Ho Chi Minh Sarani , what this place lacks in size , arrangement and ambiance, it more than makes up in the quality of food it serves ... and that perhaps says a lot.The food is THE BEST I have tasted in the genre, awesomely prepared, lip smacking taste, with just the right blend of spices and sauce. The waiting time remains less than 10 minutes even on the busiest day. So while finding a seat just might be a problem on some days, a tiny wait outside the gates is totally worth the gastronomic delight that awaits you inside.One item you must give a try is the red pepper chicken ; had it every time and the taste still lingers on. My other favourite is the dragon chicken which is extremely soft , crunchy on the outside and tender within.Now why this place really deserves a more than five rating is the price of the items. Cheap defines the menu. While it mentions here 550 for 2, rest assured just 400 is more than likely fill you up.Lastly, have to mention the one guy who does it all .. cleaning the place, taking orders, serving, waiting.. all singlehandedly and always with a warm smile on his face, kudos to you brother.

If I had written this review before my latest visit, the rating would have been even better. They changed the decor :( I loved the previous one with the Simpsons picture.
Buzz serves good food. I have eaten there on many occasions. The food is a level above other good chinese eateries. The best for me has been the fried and pan fried chicken momo and chilli pepper fish. Momo is fried to perfection with no oil dripping from it. The pan fried sauce is good and spicy. The momo is cooked in the sauce and not just mixed with it. A lot of other places can boast about good momo but not many can say so about fish. To get rid of the smell and adding taste is a task that buzz accomplishes well. It is difficult to get placed during peak hours but the efficient singular waiter makes it worthwhile with his friendliness. His agility is commendable. He single handed waits on somewhat twenty seats at Buzz!

Nice, cosy eatery with its USP being the price. Very reasonably slated at most dishes under 100 rupees, it attracts mainly students in the area.¬†
We happened to drop in before attending the Kolkata LitFest in the next lane. Had only 20 minutes to gorge on something, and we ordered Chicken Momos with Soup. Came pretty early and were delicious to say the least. The momos were really good, not too dry or soggy with a good filling. The clear soup was among the best I've had in Calcutta.¬†
We had a quick Mixed Hakka Noodles and it was worth the price. I've rarely seen such big shrimps in Noodles these days, and it tasted awesome, hot and spicy.¬†

Would love to visit again, even if only for the momos.

Buzz is a small cozy corner , in Little russel street at the junction of Ho Chi Minh Sarani. It is really too small, I mean space is little problem and most of the time people have to stand around before getting in.¬†
But they serve nice chinese food , or rather Indian version of Chinese food which tastes fine for me. The quantity is also good. The staff are okay.
Their price seems to be little high to me, coz their main buyers are office goers around that area. So I don't go to Buzz as I want going a restaurant, mostly ¬†everyday-lunch kind of thing. I don't wanna buy lunch everyday with a 200 INR kind of bill ¬†.. if you are going for one day, it seems fine.

Now coming to the food..its cheap and pocket friendly no doubt but the food is really good and delicious..its momos are just perfect..soups give the perfect taste too..the noodles and friedrice are simply wow..
Just in case if people dont find a place to sit,a take away is always an option..overall a place with great food..a must try for all..:)

Visited this place yesterday..a nice,small joint with enough space to accommodate 12-15 people together,i loved my first experience here. Compared to the pocket friendly pricing of dishes here,the place offers everything that is expected in a well going restaurant starting from an air conditioner to quick service to awesome delicious well stuffed items. We ordered thai soup and pan fried chicken momo for starters. Both the items immedietly contented me so i was really looking forward to the main course. The thai soup was well stuffed with chicken and so was the momo deliciously 'pan-fried'. For main course we ordered mixed fried rice and dragon chicken. The mixed fried rice was again well stuffed with chicken,prawn,eggs n anything stuffed with prawn really makes me happy and satisfied since prawn is one of my favourites. The dragon chicken was not so delicious still was not really bad even. To round off,my first experience in buzz was really satisfying so i rate them a good 4.5!

We came across this restaurant while we were finding some place which offer good momos. Its not a big place rather a small one, the decor is on the minimal side. Still we had to wait for 10 mins to get a table. Its seating capacity is around 25. Anyways we got the table and ordered momo, mix rice, lemon chicken, chicken gravy noodles. It took just 20-25 mins to serve the food. And it was really very nice. I mean the quantity as well as the quality were really good. The prawn served in the rice were significantly big which is surprised us. In chicken gravy noodles also the amount of chicken were significantly high. The chicken item was also very good. I mean every item was really tasty. No complaint about any item. And more over the momo's size were also very good. We were completely satisfied with the food. One thing i must add is there hospitality. The waiter was really a very well behaved person as well as very helpful in suggesting food. I find this place to be very good. Will surely visit there very soon to try some other items.

This place is very cosy and little chinese dining space. The food tastes yummy and the pan fried momos are a must eat. Service is very good and quick. We went at the closing hour and did not know that they don't accept cards, also we did not have enough cash. But they were cooperative enough to wait until I went and got out cash from the nearest atm. Also we ordered food at our office and it was equally good, so takeaways are smooth and tasteful too.

ambience wise there nothing much , small joint around 6,7 tables, with some cute posters on the wall , but food is very good here , starting from momo, soups, chowmin, fried rice, paper fish, manchurian chicken , dragon chicken, but my most fvrt was red paper chicken, this preparation with chicken hakka chow, an absolute winner, pricing is pocket friendly, a must visit restaurant for those who love good food .. :)

I have been to this restaurant quite a number of times & it has never disappointed me....so let me give my opinion about it..

Location--very easy to locate in ho chi minh sarani, it is near to metro plaza shopping centre/ Quite near to jyoti vihar restaurant.

Ambience-- This restaurant is not very spacious, its a small cosy place tucked beside a road so don't have high expectations at all regarding ambience. Seating space is hardly for 15 ppl approx. However, whatever little space there is, it is quite well maintained and very well air conditioned so you can't complain much. Went there today, there was renovation going on so waiting for the new improved interiors soon..

Food---The most important thing for which this place has earned many avid loyalists. The food is reallllyyy good!! the momo's this restaurant serves is just awesome a must try!! especially if u have a spicy pallet don't miss out the pan fried momo's. Both veg and non veg are equally great. The soups are really nice as well. It is one of the very few restaurants whose veg and non veg dishes are equally tempting (which rarely happens) which is why you will find a lot of vegetarian crowd here as well. Normal fried rice is good. Noodles( both hakka and chilly garlic) justify their tastes. The side dishes are all good. Never disappointed me. SPECIAL MENTION of the waiter there. He is a very nice host, gives very good suggestion according to your taste. He is ¬†the waiter+manager ¬†there. Does his job really well.¬†

All in all a very pocket friendly chinese/tibetan restaurant. Amazing food and service so ambience will never bother u at all. Must visit once.!!

A very small place. Not well decorated. If you are a foodie and want something good without spending much then this is the right place. Foods are good. I liked their service and the taste of the food.  Not at all costly. At the same time not a good place to go for a date but a good place for quick lunch or dinner right after a shopping in camac street pantaloons.

One of the worst customer service received. We were asked to wait for 10mins, while we eventually ended up waiting for 40mins outside in the heat. The behavior was unacceptable.Highly disappointed.

It took me around 2 years to muster up enough courage and walk into this place but oh boy! little did I know that I was in for a treat! !!!
This is my favourite hangout. Economical and amazing food. No one can make pan fried drums of heaven and pan friend Momos like them.
I have tried almost all items available on their menu the above mentioned two items should definitely be tried by all who haven't.
However I don't really enjoy the other Momos (steamed and fried) that the sell nor did I like their thukpa.

We frequently ordered the non-veg lunch pack which costs Rs. 80-85. Now the same is Rs. 110, good for a exceptional lunch in small budget. Though you will not love the place by sight and behave. But you can have parcel or home delivery at least once to know their quality.

Every now and then when we walk towards our college from maidan metro to the xavier's backgate, we encounter this small little as we call the "red joint" at the juncture of little russel street and the russel street. This was discovered by the two superb devotee of tibetian food, me and my bestie. Buzz serves u some of the best chinese and tibetan delicacies. A small little joint which overflows during office lunch hours. The delicious and heavenly momos, the amazing pan fried momos, the secret sauce they put it is amazing. Then again particularly i make it a point to Choose pan fried drums of heaven as the starter, which is heavenly.l love the mixed thukpa with dumplings. It is lip smacking. Thr heat and the amazingly prepared thukpa can literally kill you and then make you alive. Another thing that can definitely be tried is the hunan chicken as well. The most amazing dish however is the Shredded lamb with green pepper. They cook the lamb to such tenderness and with all the secret spices , you cannot just stop eating it. The taste relays through your tongue and you wil savour it forever. For those who have fetish for a nice ambience and nice decor, this is not the place as it is just coloured walls. But what is the wow factor, is the amazing food. A must visit for people who have fetish for chinese and tibetian.

A rainy evening and you are bound at home does not mean u need to feast on home cooked food. When maximum joints refused to deliver at my place, BUZZ came to our rescue. The Guy taking the order was really sweet n courteous as well as assistive . Our order was

Veg thukpa: light on flavour n good 
Chicken sweet corn soup: nice pieces of chicken , should have been more flavoured with at least pepper 
Chilli mushroom dry: a good preparation
Szechuan fried rice: nice 
Veg fried rice: pretty good 
Veg gravy noodles: they had given the gravy and noodles separate and it was wonderful to taste . Light and perfect flavour 
Szechuan veg gravy : it was very thick and Szechuan was on the higher side . Average dish 
Chilli pepper fish  : the best of the lot . Lip smacking , amazing and wonderful 

Overall a good experience looking forward for more varieties and perfection at their dishes from this hangout .

 Delivery came In an hour as expected . Pricewise it  is reasonable

Location: Ho chi Minh Sarani 
Landmarks: Jyoti Vihar & Metro Plaza (adjacent lanes), Green Apple (opposite). 

UPDATE: THIS PLACE HAS BEEN RENOVATED (Details in the ambiance discussion part of the review).

This is a small eatery which exactly keeps in mind the fact that "time is precious" and "food quality is more important than ambiance". 
As mentioned above, it's kinda clear this place isn't that great keeping in mind the AMBIANCE, but is absolutely mind-blowing in food quality. But, on a recent visit (December 19, 2014), this place managed to bring a smile on my face at the entrance itself. The place has been renovated and the walls have been tiled. The floor has been done up with marble. The lighting layout has been changed and the current one is much better than the earlier one, as it imparts a different ambiance to this place during the evening. Happy to see this change. The tables and chairs are still the same and so is the arrangement of the same.

Have been visiting this place for years now, and the quality has never deteriorated ever since. Just the same mouth watering or at times better than always. 

Talking about the FARE, 
This place serves Tibetan and Chinese cuisines, tendering to the office crowd. 

Have always stuck to the same menu when it comes to Tibetan:

- Veg Momos 
¬†¬†¬†¬†Steamed: Cooked to perfection, served with clear soup. Delicious. 

¬† ¬†Pan-fried: It's no where near fried stuff, it's saut√©d over high flame with the spicy sauces and this perfect blend of sauces along with the saut√©d momos make it an awesome dish to gorge on. 
Recommended. 

- Thukpa 
Absolute authenticity! Love the way it's prepared. 
A soup comprising of stock, assortment of vegetables, flat noodles. 

-¬† The accompaniment i.e. the momo sauce out here is spicy enough to make one feel the heat! 

Coming over to Chinese, 

- Chilli Garlic Noodles 
Have always preferred it a bit more spicy than usual, and trust me, never has this place ever failed to provide me with the right amount of spiciness I wish for. 

- Schezwan Rice 
How can I forget, This dish has made me return back to buzz thrice in a week! 
Speechless, Delectable.
The rice was perfectly cooked and was wok-tossed with fresh and juicy veggies along with the right amount of schezwan sauce. Tasted great.
Recommended.

- Hakka Noodles 
Was a bit oily though, was good to eat. 
Wouldn't say great as others. Yet, the noodles was perfectly boiled and tossed along with fresh veggies. was well-seasoned.

- Chilli Paneer (Dry)
The paneer cubes were soft and succulent. Well-marinated cubes were tossed with freshly diced onions and capsicum along with a spot on seasoning and sauces to produce a great flavor. The dish tasted good, but, the oil content in it was found to be quite high.

Overall an awesome fooding experience at a minimal pocket pinch. 
- Do not frown if you see no tables available since there's always a rush and you might just have to share a table at peak hours. 
- Take away is suggested to people who might have a problem with this. :-) 

A must try!! 
Thumbs up. (y)

This is a popular place for office worker and people from surrounding offices flock out there at the lunch time.
This is small place and always packed up at lunch hours. Their main USP is good Chinese food at a very reasonable price.
Their Talumain Soup, Mixed Gravy Chow mien, American chop-sue is good, so the chicken preparations are. the combo meals and sandwiches are good to.
This place may look clingy but the taste of food is good.
When you forget to bring your Ghar ka Dabba, and your office is near by Russel Street , get there pack some Chinese and have it in office.
Rating is given for the food and the price.

This is my most frequent and favorite eating place in Kolkata because of three reasons. First, it is situated just opposite to my workplace. Second, the price is really reasonable and the food is awesome. Third, though it is a small place, the ambiance is very pleasing and the waiter is friendly and efficient.
My favorite dish there is their chicken fried rice and hot garlic chicken. They go very well with each other. The amount is more than enough to satisfy your appetite. They put generous amount of chicken in their rice and noodle plates. All their chicken dishes have eight pieces. So you can easily share a plate between two or even more. And I can challenge that you wouldn‚Äôt be able to dislike the taste of their food.
Except the above food I have tried their noodles, thukpa, chopsuye. All of them are worth your money. Have never tried their starters or fish items, so can‚Äôt comment on that but their soups are very good. 
Many people like their momos but I would like to differ from them. Have had better.
To summaries, if you want to have good Chinese food and with small pocket pinch, then rush towards the Buzz, not very far from the Maidan metro or Birla planetarium and be careful as there might be a waiting queue as the place gets very crowded at lunch time but I can assure you it‚Äôs worth the wait.
P.S. It would be better if the management decide to install a washbasin there.

This is certainly not a place to enjoy fine dining. Moderately furnished with just 4 tables and wrought iron chairs, this place is more of a regular place for nearby people. However there are some interseting posters that can instigate a teensy smile on your face. I remember one of them being the various languages in which you can order a pint of beer. The german is "Eine bitte beer".
Coming to the food. The food is just like any other neighbourhood restaurant. Decent won't be an exaggeration. I have tried their pepper fish which was truly nice. The dry chilli chicken was okayish. I won't recommend this place for dining out on special occasions. But if you are nearby and extremely hungry and reluctant to shed too much money you can definitely try this place.

Well this is a small(read small i mean it) chinese and tibetan join in ho chi minh sarani.I have been ordering takeaways from here since long,and have dined here too( avoide it coz its really small) 
The food here is good to taste and reasonble priced.I have taken their chinese meal many a times when theres no food cooked at home and its good if i compare the price i pay.The chilly pepper veg and momos are good.Good ol hakka is prepared very well and so is the american chopsuey.Veg cantonese noodles are a must try. For gravy do try the sweet and sour veggies and schezwan potatoes.I avoid manchurian here, dont find their preparation fresh(the manchurian is very chewy and i have a fighting contest with it armed with a folk :/ ) 
Overall a decent place to eat chinese :)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yet Another combo meal ordered from buzz.I had ordered for a veg meal with noodles,manchurian(they give no option) and momos.I Was starving and buzz being the closest place to my house, thought would deliver fast,and they did within 10mins of my telephonic order :p They gave me veg fried rice instead of noodles(whaa?!)anyway it was good.The manchurian as usual was a lil chewy but the gravy was nice,not spicy and the flavour of ginger was prominent which i quite liked.The momos were good as usual :) The food disappeared from my thermocol plate in no time.It costed me 110 after taxes and was filling.

Looking for a quick lunch, this very humble little place wasn't much difficult to locate. Though small, it was neat and tidy and the interiors were good enough with some really nice posters. For the food we actually thought of the Drums Of Heaven for starters, perhaps we were a bit early for lunch, so we had to order Chilly Pepper Chicken, as was what available then. The service was prompt and it actually tasted pretty good. Still we were lucky to find it empty, for it started pouring in very quickly and by the time we finished the place was already crowded. We ordered the Prawn Hakka Noodles and a Hot Garlic Chicken for the mains. The Hot Garlic Chicken tasted good the thing that clicked for me about the Noodles was the profusion of prawns in it. The prices are also very reasonable. Overall not at all a bad deal, if you are in the area around Little Russel St. and looking for a quick lunch..

If you have keenly seen by reviews you will see that I am a big fan of Pork dishes but this is one of the places where I go when I am in mood to have some chicken.Went to this restro again after having a lovely experience the last time. This restaurant has now become our place for getting together with friends coming to Kolkata after a long period of time. This time we went in planning that we will be trying some new items this time. We were three of us and we ordered for- 
 
1 Chilly babycorn
1 Chilli pepper chicken

1 Sczewan fried rice
1 Chicken fried rice

1  Hong kong chicken
1 Hot Garlic chicken

The starters i.e Chilly babycorn and Chilli pepper chicken were really really tasty. We really enjoyed having them. Now coming to the fried rice both of them were decent in taste and was blending really well with the chicken dishes. The chicken side dishes were really good and a bit spicy(I just love spicy). So overall we just loved the food and we are looking forward to visit this place again in near future.



----- 24 Feb, 2014 -----

Went to this restro near Kenilworth last Saturday with some of my friends. We were too late for lunch and were dying to try their food. The place was full but luck favored us and a group of 4 just left the place. For starters we ordered Chilli Pepper Chicken with that we ordered 1 Sczewan Hakka Noodles, 1 Chicken Fried Rice, 1 Hakka Noodles and Chilli Garlic Chicken. The service was really fast. The food was served hot. The starter was too tasty and it compelled us to order it again. The gravy of the side dish was the same gravy used in the starter but it was the main showstopper so it was blending well with the noodles. Overall we were really happy with the quantity and quality of the food.

It is small food joint at Maidan , Kolkata.  We two went to this place on a Saturday afternoon , it was quite crowded.  We got our seats after 5 minutes. This place is not very spacious and sitting arrangement was bit claustrophobic automatically , and this was the only one negative point which I can point out.  
Now coming to the food.  Yes food was delightful and delicious.  Aroma of the food was quite soothing. Quality and quantity both were decent. We had momo too apart from the main course.  As far food is concerned this restaurant is more than perfect.  Service is also good. 
You can satisfy your tummy at a decent cost.

A perfect place for college goers , businessmen and people with a craving for good food delivered fast, Buzz is the restaurant to visit for a lunch that'll fill your stomach and NOT empty your wallet. The pan fried momos are their specialty and a must try. The normal chicken chow has large amounts of chicken and egg in it and is served in judicious proportions. The chopsuey is served beautifully as well. Definitely a 4.5 from me.

What can I say about this place?

I havd dined here only once but have been ordering delivery for donkey's years.

What I love about this place is that even through the years the quality of food has remained pretty much consistent.  

The momos are a total value for money. And they sooo deliver with the quality promise of their noodles and rice. The chicken side dishes are a perfect compliment to your main  course.

Only wish: I wish they would serve pork. 

Overall LOVE THE FOOD

Meaning to catch up with each other on a wintry afternoon, my friend and I landed up at Buzz (courtesy of a fine-tuned search on Zomato) with great expectations of a pocket-friendly experience. Situated at the junction of Ho Chi Minh Sarani and Little Russell Street, Buzz is fairly easy to locate.

It is a small place with table settings for probably 15-16 people at most, and mercifully, we were the first to grab the last table. The crowd here is mostly from the offices nearby. The whitewashed walls are adorned with large, framed pictures of The Simpsons, Keep Calm messages, Manchester United and the quirky like.

One man managed the service for all the five tables and quite efficiently so. After some deliberation, with the help of the waiter, we ordered:
 
(1) Chicken Pan Fried Momo: If I had my eyes closed and were unaware of the dish that was being fed to me, I would have declared that I was eating something Tandoori, perhaps portions from a Chicken Bharta preparation, and yes, a tasty one at that. Containing six medium-sized pieces, the dish was neither Pan Fried nor what Momos are supposed to be. It was much too oily and if you know what I mean, much too 'Indian'.
(2) Egg Chicken Fried Rice (Hakka): Ordinary and palatable, loaded with shreds of chicken and egg. The quantity is such that two plates of it would suffice for three people.
(3) Dragon Chicken (gravy): We were told that it would be spicy and tasty. We were not told that it would be cooked in curry leaves! A plateful of lumps of chicken doused in a peculiar sauce - it was neither spicy nor tasty; bordered on being a tad sweet: The opposite of what a Chinese Chicken preparation is normally expected to be.
(4) Crispy Chilli Baby Corn (dry): The dish lived up to expectations in terms of the 'Chilli' part of things. Everything else was again much too oily and a tad salty.
(5) Schezwan Egg Chicken Chow (Hakka): Unpalatable with a very overwhelming flavour of flour; oily and one of the worst I have ever had.

Strangely and unappealingly so, food here is very reminiscent of Tandoori flavours. I was thoroughly disappointed.
The 550 rupees (inclusive of tax) could have been better spent.

p.s. The photograph was taken by the friend.

So, I have to thank Zomato for helping me discover places like Buzz when I'm in need of having a quick but nonetheless, delicious lunch !  Although a bit small, it is clean and decorated with cute posters and wall hangings. Coming to the food, though we wanted to taste the Drums Of Heaven, we were told that only Chilly Pepper Chicken was available. Well, I guess we dropped in a wee bit early for lunch ! Having no other option we ordered that for starters. Service was quick.....and the taste definitely didn't disappoint ! The chicken was perfect....crispy and spicy....with a prominent hit of garlic, which I liked. For mains, we ordered the Prawn Hakka Noodles with a side dish of Hot Garlic Chicken. The noodles tasted good, although a bit oily...but the thing I liked was the abundance of prawns in it ! Quantity is good enough. The Hot Garlic Chicken was well made, but not extraordinary. The combination of the two was great ! Prices are very reasonable and all these along with two bottles of thumbs-up cost less than 400/- Rs. So, all in all, a good deal....3.5 stars for now. :)

So What's the buzz about Buzz? 

was my question when a friend of mine enlightened me about this place. We went there and saw that it had a small eating space with a very limited sitting facility with a waiter running and attending guests. It is most of the times full, owing the office para, crowd that is there at that place. We got lucky and found ourselves a seat. 

The menu offered a variety of Chinese and Fast food. We ordered a plate of Manchurian Rice and Hot Garlic Chicken. The order arrived in 10 minutes. The portion of rice was fairly decent, not enough for two people but ordering another plate would be excess. The spicy and tangy flavours of the rice with that subtle coriander flavour that you get in a Manchurian was there. It had generous quantity of chicken too. 
The Hot Garlic Chicken, too was hot and spicy. The chicken portions were soft, with the flavours deep inside them suggesting that it had been cooked properly. The quantity too, was decent. 
The most appealing part of the entire place is the pricing. Its very cheap considering its location and perhaps that is the reason why it makes this a place worthy of a visit every time you come here. Cheers.

Good food at a good price but a little more in quantity would have been appreciated as in Kimli for a few more pennies, we got much tastier food in huge quantity. It get really congested in a table if you are a group of 6 people. Service is excellent and the ambiance is good too. During afternoon getting a table is quite a pain in the ass but if you go during the evenings its almost deserted. The thukpa is just great n comes in huge quantity. I even felt in love with the sweet and sour tomato sauce. Its too good. For starters I will recommend the Chilly pepper chicken. Its awesome. The noodles and rice were decent too. There was plenty of prawns and chicken in them and the taste was good but could have been better. The biggest disappointment was most of the dishes we wanted to try wasn't available.

I've been ordering takeaway from Buzz for years, largely because the seating arrangements are not so hot. But the food is definitely worth the money. And I mention this because their prices are slightly higher than normal takeaway rates. Try their Chinese Chop Suey and Chicken Noodles (gravy) for sure. They also do a very filling Chinese combo meal, or 'thali', both veg and non-veg.

I have been eating the food from Buzz for years as it is just behind my Dad's office. I have to applaud the fact that the focus of this joint is food ... not decor or ambiance but food . Usually its better to do a take-away , I have eaten here occasionally but unless you visit during off lunch hours its hard to find an empty table. Both their lunch and sandwich packs are great value for money and also good to order for a group outing.  The Talumein and Hot and Sour Soups are both good to start your meal with. The Chilli Pepper Chicken goes really well with the American Chopsuey as does the Gravy Style Noodles with the Chilli Chicken and Garlic Prawn with Fried Rice. The Momo's are average but taste better when you order the Pan Fried variety. The prices are supremely pocket friendly and taste fairly consistent. Here is hoping that  "Buzz" continues to create a buzz amongst foodies and maintains its USP as a reasonably priced restaurant that serves tasty food.

I think this has been my favorite takeaway destination for chinese and tibetan food besides crystal chimney especially during the month ends. This is a small eatery opposite golden park hotel. The place is just meant to come in, eat your hearts out and get back to work. The staff is warm enough for such a rushy place.

The food prices are very very decent for such top notch food. The momos, chilly pepper veg are very good. I love their clear soups. Fried rice, hakka chow, manchurians, chilli paneer are all tasty and serving is very generous for that price.  Szechuan noodles deserve a special mention.

The place is very compact and too full at lunch hours though not so busy at dinner hours but i prefer the place for a takeaway though there is no competition to sitting in the restaurant and food coming straight to ur table from kitchen without any delay.

The first time I found this place, I was like "Whattt!!'.. I had passed by it God knows how many times, but it's actually that small and unnoticeable..From outside, this place really doesn't scream 'Come in, Try me'.. But let me tell you, this little fella does manage to surprise you!

How? The price? Leaving the roadside so-called-noodle joints, how many places do you know that serves you great Hong Kong Chicken at 90 bucks? Very few, to say the least.. Yes, their decor might not be top notch, or the seating area might not have a feel-good factor, but they have tried their best in budget to keep it simple yet clean, hang a couple of Drink-Beer n Manchester United Wallpaper.. nice! 

As me n my friend had arrived at 3.45, n they take a break at 4, a few items on the list were unavailable.. We ordered Drums of heaven, Hong Kong Chicken n Mixed Fried Rice.. Their service is surprisingly quick, given that there was only one waiter taking all the tables' orders.. 

Now the main part.. The food! Okay, I know what one would expect from a 95 bucks Hong Kong Chicken.. N I was no exception.. But trust me, it was much much better.. It had the perfect amount of spice, the most important ingredient for the dish.. The chicken pieces were juicy.. N there were 8 pieces of them, and enough fried rice to give us both food sweats at the end..

Given their pricing, you should give this place a try.. For a quick lunch, or for eating-till-you-drop with friends, this place will look after both your taste buds n your pocket.. :)

Hard to find but once you find it its awesome. Its about 10 minutes walk from the maidan metro or 5 minutes from Vardhaan market.
Very pocket friendly to college students like us. 
They serve proper amount of food here and the waiter is extremely friendly. He seems to be a permanent as I have been seeing the same face for over 3 years now. 
These are the orders I have finally settled on from my visits:
Drums of heaven
Hong Kong Chicken
Chicken pan fried momo
Chicken thukpa
Fried baby corn
Am not a big fan of seafood so am sorry about not being able to say about that category but am sure they are worth trying.
The place however does seem packed most of the times but waiting is a viable option.
Hope you have a great time too

this is a very small chinese eatery in maidan,takes a minute walk from metro plaza at ho chi minh sarani,having 4 to 5 tables and almost always crowded in the peak hours.it remains closed frm 4 to 5pm.
the inside is neat and clean n service is prompt.
we ordered 
panfried drums of heaven--around 70rs for 6 pieces,the sauce was spicy and amazingly tasty to excite your taste buds.
panfried chicken momos-- around 50 rs for 6 pieces,well prepared with the same sauce.nevertheless i enjoyed both.
american chopsuey- costs around 120 rs.the best of the lot.the quantity is suitable for 2 people and they even bring it served in two plates with lots of chicken n prawn n separate dish of poached egg.i personaly like the sweet and taste n i have it everytime i visit.
this place is too reasonable for the tasty tangy recipes they serve.the bill was around 260 rs including the taxes.
i suggested this place to my friends, they had steamed chicken momos with soup (they loved the soup more) ,pepper chicken(outstanding) ,chicken gravy noodles n a prawn side dish (both were decent )
overall,a highly recommended place for a tasty reasonable chinese treat! :-) must must go!

So what's all the buzz about....well its about getting yummy awesome food at reasonable price. Though the interiors aren't that great they are clean and can be tolerated. The food oh my god So damn cheap with overwhelming quantity. You can visit this place anytime you want with very little amount of money. I loved the hong kong chicken, babycorn, noodles, fried rice etc etc in short almost everything. Their momo is also awesomely delicious. I absolutely loved my experience here.
Overall I was very satisfied and after receiving the bill my satisfaction increased even more. 
I would advise all you chinese and tibetan food lovers to visit this one without fail and expect to have  a tasty meal at very very affordable price.

Chinese and Tibetan delicacies are my all time favorite. So whenever I get a chance, I love to discover new food joints serving authentic Chinese or Tibetan preparations. A few days ago, three of us, my two friends and I were on our way to Metro Plaza and we found Buzz at Ho Chi Minh Sarani near American Consulate. We soon made up our minds to sit and dine there while returning from Metro Plaza and accordingly did just that. 

The place is cozy with a quiet and familiar ambience. Three of us soon took our seats, discussing the day's spoils. Soon, the waiter came and gave us the menu card. The prices of every food item here are reasonable and pocket friendly. For appetizers, we ordered Chicken Sweet Corn Soup and Chili Pepper Chicken, and for the main course, we chose Chicken American Chopsuey, Chicken Thukpa, Chicken Steamed Momo's and Shredded Chicken with Cashew and Mushroom. The starters were served quickly and we literally jumped into the Chili Pepper Chicken due to its culinary look and flavor. Soup is generally decent everywhere but this one was just awesome. Both chilly and pepper were nice blended with the chicken and the flavor was prominent in every bite of the chicken. While we were on the last legs of the starter, the Momo's was served. I love momos, so I was the first person to take one from the plate. The taste resembles perfect Tibetan flavor but the chicken stuffing is very less. Instead of chicken, you will mostly find onion and other ingredients. As we were finishing the Momo's, other items were served, which were quite good. The American Chopsuey was incredible. Delicious with a long lasting sweetness! Though the Momo's disappointed me a lot but overall I liked this place. Apart from momo's, other preparations were good enough to pull me here once more- especially the Chopsuey. 

After a grand meal, we paid around Rs 600/- for three which is quite nominal for tasting so many items. The place is quite good for sitting and dining with all its yummy yummy Chinese and Tibetan delicacies.

For dinner after a movie I wanted to try Chinese.So headed to Buzz,chose American chopsy n chicken panfried momo.Quantity was decent n food tasted good for sure.Small cozy place wid no restroom but a decent decor.Will surely comeback again as very easy on d pocket.
Irritating things,waiter is ryt in front.so lack of privacy.Otherwise all is well here.
