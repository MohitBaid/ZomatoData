I was visited today with my family... I have ordered chicken reshmi kabab, mutton boti kabab, mutton biriyani, keema man and reshmi butter masala. All of the items are too good and ambience is also good.  It's better than other all Restuarants within 2 KM of it.

The name of the eatery shows in the expressions of their waiters - Sukno. Probably they don't like their jobs. The food is average at best, the portions suck. If you opt for a take away, they charge the same exorbitant price for even small containers, and they won't serve you water. Finally, enormous delays in serving. No wonder why you always find the place empty. The idiotic loudspeaker they have put up hasn't changed anything for them. Avoid.

Pathetic hygiene, mosquito boiled in chicken soup and unapologetic behaviour when pointed out .. seems it is normal in their restaurant.

Food quality is really good compared to any of the other places nearby (Madhyamgram area). They have some really unique dishes (veg dilruba :P) which really stand out. Chinese and Indian both are amazing. Delivery is prompt. They do deliver in the Doharia area if that helps.
I can't give full rating as I have never dined there so I can't rate the dining experience.
I must say that as a bachelor, Sukno Lanka has saved the day for me on several days.
I really loved one incident that happened. I forgot to pick up the Mutton Biriyani (which is awesome btw) along with my other orders. It was late that night. I called them up the next day and explained it to them. They immediately checked and confirmed that I did forget to pick it up. They happily had it delivered to my place immediately (a freshly cooked one). Thats one great experience. Integrity matters!
On another occasion, they carried their card machine while making home delivery as I informed them that I did not have much cash. That was nice of them too.

It was nothing special about their food. Went there for nabami dinner. Ordered chicken fried rice and Schezwan chicken. The quality of fried rice was average. Shredded chicken was less in the rice, rather there was plenty of eggs. Schezwan chicken was also average. I had better taste of Schezwan sauce in other restaurants. The staff was very courteous and well- behaved in that busy hours. Ambience is good. We were so much hungry that we forgot to capture photos.

Heard a lot about a good quality of their food so ordered food from here on Puja days. Don't know may be because of rush of Puja days the garlic chicken was completely rotten. We have to through it out. Except that the rest food was excellent. Tandoor chicken was soft. Crispy babycornÂ was very tasty. Mixed rice was awesome in taste. Hunan chicken was good.

Sukna Lanka is one of the renouned hotel in myamgram area....Good food....ambiance are quite good.....behaviour of the staff's are good.....I like the place....this was my 1st day experience but when we entered 2nd time they are serving totally rotten food which we never expect and the behaviour of the stuff was 180 degree change..we just pay the bill and leave the restaurant and also told them that, that was the last time we are visiting in that restaurant.Really guys I can't explain the bad smell of those dishes,which is specially came form inside the chicken.it was horrible experience.So I am requesting to all don't go to this place because our life is more precious and they are doing there own business just and they don't worried about all this things..if possible then please go to the other restaurant.

Few days back I've ordered a mutton biriyani from there for the first time. The biriyani was dry and taste wise okay type..nothing special. But the mutton pieces in biriyani was bad & it was not fresh.. Actually they gave two mutton bones with slight flesh in it.. So I'm not gonna order anything for the next time.ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘

It's odd for urban commuters to reach this location literally on highway. The ambience is more or less moderate but I always find it hard to sit comfortably and eat (I'm 5'7") But the reason behind the low rating is it's over sweeten flavours. Their snacks are great but if you're opting for main course, go for other places near the same area. Although you can prebook this place for bday party and other stuffs. So that's a plus point for many people.

We went to this restaurant last Friday evening for dinner. We had Chicken Tandoori, Butter Nun, Chicken Kohlapuri, Salad and soft drinks.....Overall we were happy with the behavior of staff, ambiance....in fact we were ordering some dish of higher price, but the staff only suggested to go for Kohlapuri as we were looking for some spicy preparation and we were not disappointed with the pick. In fact this is the first time I saw that the guy of restaurant is suggesting for a cheaper plate above what we were planning to have. Only thing which I felt was that....Chicken tandoori could have been a bit more soft, however its not bad... We were happy with the quantity and quality of food and must suggest others to give it a try....

Sukno Lanka is not that good! It has variety in food items but the taste is below average. Chinese should not be included at all since that don't know to cook properly. The decor is okay and it looks good from outside but once you enter and eat, you laugh at your expectations.  I wouldn't prefer it much.

Visited this place once. Nicely decorated Restaurant though located in a lonely place between Doltala and Madhyamgram Chowmatha on Jessore Road. The place is so catchy in terms of decoration, lighting it will attract you for sure.

Now, let's talk about the food. We ordered Chicken Drumsticks, Hakka Prawn Noodles & Hot Garlic Prawns. Drumsticks were not up to the mark at all. I had better drumsticks even in the footpath of Dalhousie. Regarding the Hakka Prawn Noodles, it was not bad; but the Hot Garlic Prawns were superb visually as well as in taste.

Final verdict: If you compare the food quality vis a vis cost then it's not a very good option I would say, as most of the dishes are overpriced compared to taste.
