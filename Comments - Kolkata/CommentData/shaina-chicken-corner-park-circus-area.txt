4 because of their signature item - Shaina special roasted kebab with gravy.  It's roasted chicken (not boneless) along with special butter gravy. The gravy is what adds to the taste and truely amazing. Another item worth trying is their Chicken Changezi. Other kebab items didn't taste as good as roasted chicken. It's a take away joint with a very small seating area, so if you are planning to go in a large group, then this place can be avoided. It's a good place to order food for home delivery.

A small joint nearby Quest mall serving Mughlai at the most reasonable price possible. Although its better as takeaway. They make good kebabs, biryanis are nice too. Alu paratha  definitely needs lot of improvisation. Its my personal favourite when I get hunger pangs specific to Mughlai.. Nearby :D

A small place located on the left hand side lane of quest mall. The place was initially famous of its kebabs and still are. Their gravy chicken is very nice and the gravy tastes amazing. Apart from that, they have a number of other types of kebabs. Recently the have come up with burgers and fried chicken which tastes similar to KFC , just a bit oily. This place is a go to place for anyone when they are broke and crave something good.

I do not often rate a restaurant so high. After ages a place has been as expected. Not that I expected much, but at this price point, one should not complain. We ordered a takeaway from Zomato. While the outlet accepts cash only, delivery was on time. Food was warm.

The biryani was decent. Especially so when you take into account its price of rs 70, while most places charge double that. Granted the chicken piece is smaller, but still. We had the aloo paratha that was so so. The roast chicken (supposedly their speciality dish) was pretty nice. It was essentially a kabab chopped and tossed in a dahi based gravy (at least that is what it tasted like). We had paired it with roomali rotis. We paid just Rs 260 for a meal for 4. That is even lesser room to complain. Even the mint chutney accompanying the meal was fresh and light.

So go ahead, give it a try. I will definitely re-indulge.

My review is an experience of a home delivery. This is a small place in the bylane of back of the Quest mall, to say you can understand that is suitable for take aways or home delivery.
I was extremely disappointed with this joint, not on one but two occasions. I tried their Chicken Changezi, it tasted quite odd. Their Chicken tikka is more of a gravy style than a starter. My order of burgers & chicken popcorn came all crushed together & cold. The latter item had excess amount of salt. Choose wisely when ordering from here.

Been hearing about this place,a very small joint.
Quite reasonable. We ordered the chicken roast, chicken tandoori, chicken afghani, roomali roti and parathas.
Chicken afghani wasn't as per our liking. The gravy on top of it was sour.The butter on the chicken roast was mouthwatering.
Else the other items were good. We had a feast.
Would love to visit again.

One of the best places for roasted chicken takeaway. The only problem with this outlet is the space crunch in and around that area which is precisely the reason why I opted for 4.5 rating. But the food they serve is just lip-smackingly delicious. Never had such well cocked chicken anywhere in my life. The prices too are very reasonable and pocket-friendly. The location is also very good, in the lane by the side of the Quest Mall.

Around the Beckbagan area, you will get various restaurant to satisfy your chicken craving and Shaina Chicken Corner is your one stop destination, if you are low on budget. The restaurant was on my wish list for a long long time and finally been there few days ago. So lets come and explore this chicken corner.

Positive point ‚Äì

1.	Low pricing ‚Äì From Chicken fry to Kebab and Biriyani, everything is super cheap here. So you can try different verity items as you like.

2.	Quick Service ‚Äì One thing which really got in my attention was, their service time. You just have to wait around 3-5min max for your food.

Negative Point ‚Äì

1.	Small spacing ‚Äì Except the small spacing, I hardly got any negative point here.

Now let‚Äôs come to food. Shaina offer a wide verities of chicken items, which surely bring water in every chicken lover‚Äôs mouth. We ordered ‚Äì

1.	Chicken Roasted Shaina Special (Half Roasted) ‚Äì This the top most hit item here. You can see almost in every table, customer order this one, which signify how popular this dish is! Large amount of small to midsized chicken pieces were there which were well grilled and tossed in a finger licking gravy. Perfect item to try with any kind of roti.

2.	Alu Paratha ‚Äì We ordered this one to try with roasted chicken but it doesn‚Äôt goes well. The paratha was big in size with full aloo fillings inside but it was too soft in nature. Overall not so satisfactory.

3.	Rumali Roti ‚Äì Traditional rumali roti which was big in size and well baked. Nothing exceptional. It goes perfect with the roasted chicken.

4.	Chicken Biriyani ‚Äì Well, I really don‚Äôt like to have biriyani from all places but the low pricing of their biriyani really break my resistance. Rs.70 for a Chicken Biriyani is almost rare for nowadays in a reputed restaurant. The quantity was somehow less and dry in nature, Chicken pieces were good but not so well marinated. Overall okay considering the low price tag.

5.	Chicken Changezhi (Quarter plate) ‚Äì We want to have some gravy side dish with our biriyani, so after a little discussion with the waiter, we ordered this one. One pieces of chicken breast and leg were came dipping into a rich gravy. The gravy was full of ginger and the over tangy flavor of the dish somehow lost its own natural flavor. Didn‚Äôt go much well with the biriyani neither with roti. Overall not so satisfactory.

With all the items mentioned above it costs us only around 300INR which is really a decent pricing. They also don‚Äôt add any kinda tax or GST, which is really a blessing.  So in conclusion I will say wide varieties of chicken items with low price tag is the main UPS here. The restaurant offer some good chicken dishes also which is enough to satisfy your chicken craving. Overall a good dining experience.

A very popular place behind Quest Mall. There is a basic non AC seating arrangement and service is reasonably fast considering the crowd. 

We have tried roasted chicken and chicken tikka here. The roasted chicken comes with a tasty yogurt based gravy. I can finish couple of rotis with the gravy only. Tikka was good too. Price was very reasonable. 

Only problem here is the chicken is very hard. Not at all juicy and soft like kebabs should be. So good value for money and taste. But the overall experience remains average due to the hard meat.

I had been visiting them since their inception in 2011, initially they served only chicken roast with butter as gravy Delhi style and Chicken dry roast with breads had category of Alu paratha, Roti, Paratha.
Later they inprovised and introduced many other  varities from Tandoori, Chicken Changezhi, Biriyani etc.
Priced absolutely reasonably, this is a must try specially the Chicken roast Delhi style with butter. They sell on the basis of quarter, half and full and will cut the pieces into smaller ones if requested.
Only parking is a constraint however that should not be a barrier, because chicken roast here is great!!

Happy eating!! Bon apetit!!

Lipsmacking, amazing yet affordable. Nothing describes Shaina chicken corner better. This small eatery situated next to Quest mall is quite a star already. They work their magic on chicken and turn it into something scrumptious.
Take the special chicken roast for example.
Chunks of roasted chicken cooked in spicy yogurt sauce. Finger licking good!
Of late I ordered a chicken burger from this eatery and it was shockingly good!
Soft buns and juicy fried chicken. Made my day.

Cheap and a good choice if you are low on budget . Ordered the roasted chicken and rumali Roti's .
The Roti's were stale , tearing them itself was a tedious job . Sauce was not fresh , neither were the salads . Cucumbers tasted as if it was cut yesterday and kept in fridge .
Roasted chicken was good but it wud be great if they stop using such high amounts of food color !
They also need to improve on their hygiene . Hygiene is the most crucial factor for restaurants, which is definitely lacking here .
Chicken hot wings were simply bad. Only bones. No flesh . The next day I had stomach illness!
Takeaway or ordering via online is advised if one wishes to have food from there!
Update on my last order 2 wks ago-
Ordered aloo paratha n boneless reshmi chicken . Tuk 50 mins to get delivered when the shop is located just 2mins from my house. Coming to the food, aloo paratha had very less aloo but was soft... .ok-ok type.
Boneless chicken reshmi was d showstealer. 7 pieces of juicy n succulent chicken just melted in the mouth . This time the complementary salad and chutney was better . Overall satisfactory experience .

On a sultry afternoon of late May (2017) I visited this place called Shaina Chicken Corner. My visit to this place wasn't a pleasant one & I am utterly disappointed. This place is over rated and overhyped. I reached there around 4:20 pm in the evening and the small dine was completely crowdless. You have to cross Shaina take away counter and walk a bit more to reach the small seating area of Shaina dedicated to dining. The A.C was not working and even two fans were not working. You place your order and wait for eternity even being the solo customer in the dine . I ordered 2 rumali rotis,chicken roast leg piece and chicken malai kebab. Both the chicken dishes were excessively salty.The quantity too was moderate. Kebabs were burnt, even with a full fledged attempt to cover the burnt with malai gravy it tasted worst. Rumali rotis was the only thing for which I can rate them 1 or 1.5 however I am rating it 2 /5 because I firmly believe that criticizing is easy but the chef has his efforts in it (even if it disappoints the gastronomic pleasures of a foodie), otherwise I was close to giving it zero . You get scrotched , ditch other elite options just because you are passionate about food and dinings specially the hidden gems and your quest for food turns unfruitful. I'm not going to visit this place again and my recommendation will be don't visit this place unless you are in an absolute shortage of money and terribly hungry around Syed Amir Ali Avenue Area.

The place z not good for dining in, rather a take away place. It z d cheapest chicken corner, I v been ever to. I have seen so many good reviews about this place, thats y I opted for ordering from here. N this place didnt disappoint me. We had biriyanis n roasted chicken from Shaina. Biriyani was okayish. The potato n the chicken were well cooked. The quantity  of roasted chicken was huge. The taste was good too. It has a little hot n sour gravy future..(containing curd) layering the chicken pieces. Chicken pieces  contain the flavour of tandoor. In fact it wont taste like original roasted chicken, still tastes good!! The quality n quantity of their food was beyond my expectations!! So I loved this place n ll surely order from here in future..

The day I visited this place, it happened to be stall with loads of customers flocking around. Recently, it graduated into a restaurant but still its specialty remains in Take Away & Home Delivery.

It places itself right behind the Quest Mall on Kasai Bagan Road, accessible by foot both from Park Circus and Beckbagan. It has earned reputation for their various chicken preparation at an ultra affordable rate.

On numerous occassion, I have had tried their various chicken preparations namely - Chicken Afghani, Chicken Tangri, Chicken Tandoor, Chicken Changrezi and the likes. All these preparation seemed to satisfy me a lot with hunger still creeping it. My favourite remains to be the Chicken Tandoor. The time when I used to visit, they would sell chicken on the basis of weight (not pieces). I am not sure if its still prevalent.

The negativity of this place remains in its awkward location ¬†and not so comfortable zone. The seating arrangement is not available and you need to wait for a considerable time for your order delivery during peak hours.

A Recommended Visit!

I came here with a friend yesterday.Its near the exit gate of Quest Mall.We came here at 5pm.My friend wanted to try their biriyani.But they said it wasn't ready..neither any rotis were available although their opening time is supposed to be at 4pm.So we settled for 2 varieties of kababs only----- Chicken haryali kabab and chicken reshmi kabab.Both of them were excellent.It had aroma of ghee from it,tender,having perfect smokiness.Pricing is damn cheap.7 small pieces of kababs were served at just INR 90.

the whole dining experience in this quaint joint in the biryani hub of the city can be summed in few words.. a pocket friendly place for one of the yummiest kababs!.. located behind quest mall in park circus area this place is quite small if you want sitting.. for takeaway it's quite good.. their chcken roast and chicken malai kababs are very delicious.. I've personally loved their chcken malai kabab.. and the biggest plus is it is very very pocket friendly.. 
it is one of those places whre u can go when you hav that kabab craving wdout worrying much abt d pocket pinch... :)

Went because of the good review. It was a let down.Went there around 6pm. It was almost empty. Ordered roosted chicken malai and chicken malai kebab. It was STALE. The curd was not fresh. It tasted sour. The biryani was okay. ¬†But all the spices were not mixed properly. On one side it was just plain rice and on another it was just the spices. The plates were too small to mix.¬†
I went by the reviews but it was a huge let down.¬†
Unless you want stale food never visit this place.

Shaina chicken corner is tucked away in the lane beside Quest mall.. it is a small shop so takeaway is preferred. Their shaina special chicken roast is really good along with some rumali rotis. There are other items as well but the roast is their speciality. Pricing is very cheap. Must visit if you like chicken

Location : Beckbagan. Take the wide road right next to Quest mall, head straight and you'll find this little shop on your left!

As I reached this shop and asked for half a plate of fried chicken, I was escorted to a place few meters away, where they came and served me a plate of full of fried chicken.

Well honestly, it was pretty basic. The chicken pieces were extremely skinny, had almost no meat on them. The batter was okayishly flavoured and I felt¬†the pieces were fried for¬†a bit too long. But yes, extremely low priced.

I usually order from this place. I have never visited this place personally. I thought 10 times before ordering foid from here as the prices seemed way too reasonable. I mean where else do you get 70rskaBiryani? Thank god I wasn't dissapointed. So good the biryani was! And you can easily pay for ok-ok types chicken dry fry, as long asyou are getting them at 60rs.

The joint is situated almost back side of Quest Mall. On road foo joint. We decided to have a late dinner and my friends took me to this place from where we were‚Äôsupposed‚Äô to grab some dinner and come back to our place to enjoy it. I was a bit confused and skeptical about the idea but when we reached there at around 10, I was surprised to see the number of people waiting to take their orders and it said all. We took Tandoori Chicken with Malai  and Aloo Paaratha.  when we started eating I just knew what all the fuss was about. The food was amazing. Food was spicy just as I like it and I was blown away by the awesome taste.  Very soft Paaratha and delicious malai Tandoori Chicken. Very pocket friendly and delhi style kabbab making ! A separate joint for take away and dine in. Though all the making is done at the take away kitchen ..

This is one of those places around Park Circus where you can satisfy your¬† craving for the meat without thinking about the price.Located behind the Quest Mall,you just take the lane beside Quest mall then walk straight and you will find the restaurant at your left side.This is very popular place around this area and opens daily after 4pm.

We Ordered : Fish Fry(250 gm),Chicken Tikka Kebab,Chicken Roast Half and Laccha Paratha.

Fish fry was nothing fancy but 10 small pieces of deep fried,crispy bony fish with the skin on.Fish was fresh,juicy and tasted very nice.
Chicken Tikka kebab was also very tasty but they put too much salt in their marination which made it too salty for us.
chicken roast was their signature dish which was grilled chicken to perfection and dipped in a yogurt based thick sauce.It was delicious and¬† perfect with the Soft lacca paratha.

I must say all of their items were delicious but a little salty for our taste.This is an extremely pocket friendly place for all the meat lover people.Staffs were also decent and very helpful..........

Tried the Chicken Roast (takeaway). It was a simple blend of Tandoori chicken with cream and melted butter which resulted a complex taste of heavenly delight. Loved it to the core. And it goes well with everything... Roti, Rice and even Beers!! :D

Shaina Chicken has become quite famous in the last couple of years. They had started as a small joint in the lane beside Quest Mall and now they have two separate outlets once for take away and the other for dining in. Both outlets are very small and its best to go for take away. But if you want your grub to be hot and juicy then you may want to dine in.¬†

They specialize in North Indian chicken items at unbelievably low prices. I always order Shaina special roasted chicken which is glazed with butter ! yes you simply cannot worry about the calories when eating food from Shaina. They also offer kebabs and rolls which you can try.¬†

Typically cost for two is Rs200-250

After seeing such wonderful reviews, it was just a matter of time before I placed an order here. I had ordered Shaina Chicken Roast and Chicken Fried. 

Chicken Fried - This was a really good dish. The chicken was cooked to perfection. It was succulent which is remarkable for a home delivery order. What made it even better was the chicken wasn't drenched in oil! A really good dish to try. 

Shaina Chicken Roast - This was a pleasant dish as well. It had a runny sauce kind of marinate. Obviously the taste was a thousand times better than sauce :P I loved it. 

As a whole, this is a wonderful place serving quality chicken dishes at really affordable prices!! They definitely deserve the high ratings and it's a must to drop by soon! 

Happy Dining!

While it had been a year when we came last time,This monday we planned to go with mughlai.
I and my friend ordered half roasted chicken with rumali roti.I just want to say that the taste is still not change.It was spicy lil and the with the yogurt chutney was the nice combination.
The order was quick,the interior look and place looks like a local busy area.The roasted chicken is the good choice to get a try.It is cheap and classy with conpare to food.

Tried their roasted chicken items several times. It does make me come back to them whenever I think of roasted chicken with a little parsimonious attitude. The speciality of roasted chicken is they imbued with light gravy which enhance its taste remarkably. Munching them is a great experience of tongue itself and above all it's pocket friendly. A must visit.

We came to know about this place from zomato. Hidden gems and pocket friendly it serves as both
Location - take the lane beside quest mall and you will find the shop on the left side of the road.
Decor- the place to dine in is really small,there's only 4-5 tables.and there is a awkwardly foul smell around.if not for the smell and hygiene i would have rated it higher.
Food- the food is really great if love chicken you would be delighted.
Shaina spcl chicken roast was great,with slight gravy.
Tikka kabab and Reshmi kabab was good not extraordinary.
Malai tikka was so so.
but all of this was complimented by Alu Parathas and rotis.

All the items are damn pocket friendly.value for money in the best possible sense,

Verdict -I think this place is a great discovery but i would prefer take away from next time.

I am a chicken lover. So to enjoy pure chicken,  I travelled to this place through the lane beside quest mall. As I reached the small counter written shaina chicken over it the gentleman in the counter asked whether I wanted a parcel or sit and eat. I preferred sit and eat and a young boy guided us to a small eating place 2 shops away. It was having AC with 5-6 tables but had a of foul smell. I ordered for quarter plate Chicken changezi, one roasted chicken breast, rumali roti and aloo paratha. The delivery was done in 10 mins and the food was great. The changezi was superb and the roasted chicken ( gravy dish) was spicy and good. I found that there was small baby cockroach and flies near the table for which I did not like the hygenic part. It is better to take away. The price is absolute pocket friendly and a real gem in terms of value. I shall revisit, and only take parcel.

This restaurant recommends having their roasted chicken. So that is exactly what I ordered. I placed the order online through Zomato.

In about 45 minutes, which is their promised delivery time, the roasted full chicken arrived along with Rumali Rotis.

What followed was an amazing experience for the taste buds of folks at home. The rotis were soft and easy to tear. The chicken was perfectly roasted with a soft inside. The marination is so good that the light gravy that oozed out of the roasted chicken was a heavenly dip!

I would highly recommend that you try their roasted chicken.

Shaina Chicken Corner is one of the cheapest place around Park Circus area.

Located just behind quest Mall this place is always busy with crowd.

What to Try here:

The best of them is their Biriyani which comes at a very cheap rate also the kebabs are decent too. I liked their chicken Malai Kebab which was easy on pocket too. Roasted chicken is also a popular dish can be ordered here as well.

I ordered from this outlet using zomato online delivery app. Firstly the order took way more time than mentioned in the app. I had to contact the delivery person and zomato many a tines before I could get it delivered. This was an immediate source of annoyance for me.

I ordered some chicken tandoori and found the meat to be hard. The pieces were diced into smaller portions and it came with some onion and pudina chatni. Tasted good but as I had mentioned before  quality of meat was questionable.
 Lets hope that my later experiences at this place are better.

So yes 200 bucks for 2 with a rating of 4.0 looked like a very attractive deal..it was a spur of a moment that we decided to go to shaina chicken corner..
Just Behind quest mall.. easy peasy to locate...at the first look we thought we had entered the wrong place..it was almost empty..
But then we confirmed by looking at it's menu card Nd comparing it with the one given on zomato
the place was well illuminated with led lights...was air conditioned...with around 5-6 tables.. sufficient enough for 15-20 people
Coming to the food..we ordered a full roasted chicken Nd 3 chicken biryanis..
While our food was on it's way..we were wondering why this place has such high ratings..
But then they did their magic...roasted chicken the plate was full with around 20-25 pieces of chicken...all dipped in a curry made of curd fried with spices..it was delicious..Nd to add to the flavor they provided ''hari chatni''..
In minutes our next item arrived.. chicken biryani.. quantity Wise it was a huge pile of rice with a big piece of chicken Nd the traditional biryani "aalu", but the biryani seemed a bit dry but then it's price covered up for all its cons
Over all the place is a must visit for chicken lovers especially students since the place is so pocket friendly..

I had ventured out to check out this eatery after the rave reviews in Zomato and I was not at all disappointed. A very easy to locate place, Shaina Chicken Corner will definitely catch your attention (and your senses!) for that quintessential Mughlai fragrance and the overflowing crowd outside the food joint. We had ordered a combo meal of Chicken Burgers, a plate of Malai Kebabs and a half plate of Chicken Tandoori (yes we were desperately hungry!) and trust me, I simply can't complain of the food. I was a bit apprehensive about the burgers (I mean, c'mon, how can a Mughlai specializing eatery cook up an American style Burger!?) but damn, I was proved wrong! Utterly! The Chicken Burgers were oh-so-delicious and it had every ingredient which we can easily find in a KFC or a Rooster Burger (no offence!) and the price was unbelievably affordable. Coming to the Malai Kebabs and Chicken Tandoori, both were equally amazing. The chicken tasted yum and soft.¬†
The staff members were very cordial and the order came at lightening speed, trust me! (we literally had to speed up our eating pace to catch up with the incoming items!)
My total bill was around 340 rupees for 2 people, which was more than welcoming! The only problem which I felt was the compact sitting area, which hardly allows 18-20 people to accommodate.
I am certainly coming back here! Very soon!
P.S.: We were too busy to eat to click some decent pictures of the food! :P :D

Located at an accessible place(2 mins walk into the lane beside Quest Mall), is a Mughal cuisine restaurant named Shaina Chicken Corner. Well, there aren't as many dishes available as you see on the menu card. But who cares! The only dish which is the best and worth tasting is Chicken Malai Kebab (popularly known as Cream Kebab). However on the menu you'll find it as the Chicken Roasted Shaina Spcl. Order it. Taste it. Feel it and you're enlightened! It is so luscious and succulent. To my utter surprise, the price is extremely reasonable. Cost for 2 will be around Rs 280 to Rs 300 according to me. ¬†Another good point is that the minimum delivery amount is Rs 99 only though it doesn't provide delivery service @ my place(Behala).¬†

I would recommend to enhance the quality of service and also the dinning space is a concerning factor( 1 mark deducted). The dishes are perfectly toned to suit one's palate. Thumbs Up, Cheers!

Located at New kasia bagan lane near Beckbagan,to be precise just behind the Quest mall.
I was introduced with this place by a fellow Foodie reviewer. 
The first impression of the place was conjusted tiny shop which sells kabab and too crowdy. I wasn't sure about this food joint but my friend insisted me to try as he already explored this outlet earlier. 

So we ordered - Full roasted chicken, Full plate chicken fry and Aloo paratha.

I must say that all three dishes were appetizing and especially the roasted chicken.Though its not a swanky eatery but gem of a place for food lovers. 
Very pocket friendly exhibited menu and ROASTED CHICKEN to die for.

A little research on Zomato always helps you to find  restaurants with 4.3 rating & Rs. 200 for two price tag. Shina Chicken Corner is also the result of such.

Location : This one is located straight from the right hand lane of Quest Mall. The tag on map locates their roadside kitchen. Their dining is few steps straight from the kitchen or asking their staffs will help you to find.

Decorations : The restaurant is pretty small but very nicely decorated with led strip lights on celling. They kept the restaurant clean as much as they can & in result someone wouldn't hesitate to go there with family. Basic plastic chairs & tables can handle more than than 20 people at once in the restaurant. Their kitchen is also separated, so you wouldn't feel any hit or suffocation of kitchen.

Staffs & Management : Their staffs are good behaved & helpful. Under adult staffs are there to serving & cleaning. But they took quite long to serve.

Foods : Seeing all the Chicken related dishes a Chicken lover will gone mad. We somehow managed our madness & ordered what is most famous over there.

Chicken Roasted Shaina Special (Half Roasted) : It is one of their most popular dish. Just by sitting in the restaurant you can see this dish in every other table around you. In half plate there were a lot of small & medium sized grilled chicken pieces with white gravy. Chicken pieces were grilled well & that made it little crispy in corners. They were little hard but that doesn't felt bad. Gravy tasted spicy & very good with Rumali Rotis.

Alu Paratha : Alu Paratha was very thin & soft. It wasn't crispy fried so it doesn't felt well with Roasted Chicken. It wasn't big neither I found a layer of mashed potato layer inside.

Rumali Roti : Rumali Roti was very simple & highly baked. It tasted very good with their Roasted Chicken.

Chicken Biryani : The quantity of the Biryani looked little less in first sight. It was very dry, even the chicken piece were extremely dry & hard. The rice weren't very oily that was good. However for the low price it was manageable.

Chicken Changezhi (Quarter Plate) : This came in a plate & looked like putty to me. There were 1 big breast & 1 big leg piece dipped into dark gravy. The gravy was very spicy & rich. It was made of tomato sauce that enriches its taste too high. The gravy was over tangy & full of ginger that made the chicken tastes absolutely gone. It didn't felt good with Biryani, neither it tasted good with roti or paratha.

Pricing : Pricing of each & every dish is very reasonable. Biryani for Rs. 70 & Rs. 80 is such a steal at that price. Quantity also justifies the prices. No extra taxes makes it really value for money.

Conclusion : Their Roasted Chicken & Rumali Roti is such a great combo. Experimenting with other dishes is not recommended over here. Its very easy on pocket so why not try them. However Shaina Chicken Corner seemed little overrated to me.

Ordered the food through Zomato.
99 is their minimum amount; which is pretty good, especially if you want to order some evening snacks.

The place is Really reasonably priced.

I had ordered chicken reshmi kababs and Paratha (aloo ka paratha I guess)

The paratha was a bit TOO oily. It tasted good though..

The kababs were juicy and really well made.

Looking forward to trying the other items they have in their menu :)

I had visited the place to get the food packed. It's in the lane just adjacent to Quest Mall, a small little shop 'Dilli Ka Mazaa Kolkata Main'. Yes it's somewhat true, the streets of Delhi serving various delicious chicken items, you find at this shop. The shops is very small, and few meters ahead you have a small restaurant with a seating capacity of maximum 15 to 20 people. The serving portions are also like Delhi, half plate, full plate and as per KG.
Coming to the food, had ordered:
1. Chicken changezi, the chicken was soft and juicy. The gravy was on a spicy side but delicious, and you can make a meal when you team it up with Roomali Roti
2. Fish Fry, the fish fry was with bone, it should have been better if it was boneless, and moreover less oily. The fish was very oily so could not have the pieces which were at the bottom of the packet, as it was very oily. The chat masala sprinkled on the fish enhanced the taste.
3. Chicken Haryali kebab, checked pieces were good size, it was nicely cooked but did not become dry, was juicy and was tasting perfect with lemon juice and chat masala.
The rating is 4 as the food could be made less oily and the chat masala used could be freshly grounded rather than the ready made masala, it will make a very big change in taste and rather enhance it.
Would suggest everyone to have from here,and yes when eating from this place you need to overlook the dietary components üòõüòõ, you should just enjoy the food.

Came to know about this place a couple of months back. The quality of the food is pretty decent. I usually have chicken biryani and roasted chicken( which is their speciality) and lacchha paratha. Today i ordered for chicken tikka which was quite good bt it wasn't dry. The prices are cheap and they don't charge any VAT or any other taxes. But the restaurant is small and quite uncomfortable during the summer times. (They never switch on the AC)

After reading reviews in zomato,this small food joint pulled me up in beckbagan. At first,it was hard to locate as i was coming from Minto park. Thing became simpler as soon as i found quest mall.
When i reached the shop the first thing that astonished me is the small shape of the shop.added to it,no sitting arrangements. 
It made me confused because in the photos i have seen a place with 5-6 tables in. Dont know whether i hit the right shop or not. But the name was undoubtedly SHAINA CHICKEN CORNER.
I concentrated on food. I just had their roasted chicken with gravy. Many people appreciated the taste but i didn't find anythinge special. Tandoori chicken along with gravy,nothing else. Disappointed,i came back. Shin could not shine as i expected.

A rather unhygienic yet tremendously tasty food joint, this Shaina chicken corner truly gave me the memories of my monthly visits to gali kababiyan in Purani Dilli. Malai tikkas, chicken roast and as per the word of mouth of a fellow friend. Reshmi kababs with laccha or rumali are the top picks here. The best part? If you have only 100 bucks in your pocket you are guaranteed to have your tummy and heart satisfied.

I had been planning a visit to Shaina since a long time. But somehow, I never wanted to dine in here. So, finally I tried out this place through zomato's online ordering feature.

I was a little amazed with the wonderful reviews this place had got, keeping in mind that the prices are extremely cheap. So I was unsure of the quality of food. But that was totally assured by the dishes I had.

My order was very simple - chicken kabab, chicken roast and rumali roti. The chicken kabab was more burnt from one side. But since I prefer kababs to be a little burnt, I liked it. The taste was also good. The chicken was soft and juicy.

The chicken roast was heavenly. It tasted like what you may expect from a good mughlai restaurant. The rich and creamy yoghurt flavoured gravy was super tasty. The chicken was succulent and the quantity given for just 70 bucks is commendable.

The rumali roti was good. Since the food was served piping hot, the roti was soft when I had it. Apart from these, green chutney and salad were also provided as complimentary. The best part is that my bill was just 150 bucks ! I can't even think of how they serve such great food at so cheap prices.

Coming to the delivery service, the food was served within 40 minutes, and still it was hot. The packaging was very well done. This was more than what I could expect from this little place.

Overall, it was an amazing experience. I wanted to try the biryani here which was recommended by many but unfortunately that wasn't present in Zomato's delivery menu. So, I will be having it next time when I will do a takeaway from here. For the ones who are hesitant about dining at this place, do order from here and the food is sure to delight you ! :)

My rating is based only on the food and not on the service and ambience.
It is easy to locate. Take the lane right next to quest mall and kp walking straight and u ll find this small eatery. Ambience is not great. Service is moderately fast.
I had ordered chicken roast breast half at 70 bucks nd 1 laccha paratha nd 2 romalis.
The laccha paratha tasted great and romali was normal.
The roast chicken came with a thick white gravy smeared onto the pieces and overall tasted good at such price. Quantity was also good. It came with green chutney nd some salad.
Yet to try the kebabs which they are actually famous for.
If posch or ultraclean ambience is not ur priority..u cn come nd gv it a try.
Pocket pinch is very low.

After readings lots of reviews on this joint we finally visit their today. It is situated beside the lane of Quest mall.

Before going there I thought we would try some chicken chaap, alu paratha but after going there we found no similarities between zomato menu and there menu. According to them they doesn't serve mutton kebab, fish kebab and chap with biryani anymore. Only kebabs were available and sime chicken burgers etc.

We order:
Chicken Reshmi Kebab: Excellent taste, very soft and chicken pcs were fully cooked in tandoor.

Chicken Haryali kebab: This kebab was marineted with some green paste due yo that these kebabs were green totally, taste wise very good and juicy.

Cheese Kebab/Nawabi Kebab: This particular kebab contains 6 pcs of huge cheese wraped reshmi kebab. Unexpected excellent taste.

So all of those and tried 4 glasses of thumps up. Bill amount was 470 only..

Taste wise i can give only 4/5 but due to their low pricing am giving extra 0.5 to them.

Few weeks back I went to Kabab gali, Chadnichowk, Delhi. I was thinking while returning back that what if there is a place like this in Kolkata as well.
Well I am really glad to say that I have found one place who can deliver quality kababs along with Parathas.
The ambience and the hospitality is not upto the mark to be very honest however the quality of food is simply awesome.
We had Malai Kabab, Reshmi Kabab, Chicken Fry with Lachha Paratha and Aloo Paratha.
Trust me if you have 100 bucks on your pocket and you are searching for a place to have some good food, you can certainly come to this place. It will not dissappoint you.
Most importantly, use of fresh cream on the Malai Kabab and the softness in Aloo Paratha will bring you back again to this place. Same goes with the Reshmi Kabab.

It is tiny place behind Quest Mall selling a host of visually appealing items straight out of the tandoor, which are made even more jaw-dropping thanks to the extreme levels of "pocket-friendliness" (does that word actually exist?) exhibited by the menu.

This is actually the scene before you order. Once done, the food comes in less than 5 minutes. You may decide to have it there only, in their sophisticated seating area (with no extra payment) or opt for a takeaway.

So we decided to sit there and have something very heavy - CHICKEN BIRYANI and the acclaimed CHICKEN CHANGEZHI.

The biryani (Rs70) was good. The chicken piece wasn't very big but having such a huge quantity of biryani seated in a restaurant at this price was worth it. The Chicken Changezhi was a spicy gravy with a slightly sour aftertaste. It would have done a wonderful job with some tandoori roti or paratha. It is worth knowing that a quarter plate of the Changezhi contains two big chicken pieces, while the half plate has four. The meal was enjoyable and the wallet retained its smile.

The really good pricing is the best part of the restaurant. I seriously wish my metabolic rate was higher so i could gulp down some kebabs which caught my eye initially. I've set them on radar for the next visit. :)

Shaina Chicken Corner - An exemplary experience.
=====
Intro + Location:

Located on the lane before Quest Mall (if you are visiting from Gurusaday/Golpark Side). It is not very difficult to locate. However, shaina chicken corner has expanded to Topsia as well. They are planning to make the park circus one as a restaurant. One fine day when my brother was there in Kolkata, we got a chance to visit this place during late night around 11:30 or so. It was about to close that time and i wanted to have some chicken dishes here. It was very nice of Mr. Shamim, owner of Shaina if i am not wrong, to not disappoint us by providing us with mutton when the chicken was sold out. We were sitting in the car and consumed our food there.¬†
=====
What we had ordered:-

‚Ä¢ Mutton Burrah Kebab - It was heaven on earth. I am not a mutton lover but yes, this stuff did make me crave for more.¬†

We didn't order for more but out of love, the owner gave us one mutton seekh to try too. I appreciate that and thanks for that. It was excellent too.

#Special Mention about the Green Chutney.
=====
Pros:-

‚Ä¢ Prime Location.
‚Ä¢ Reasonably priced.
‚Ä¢ Good service and hospitality.
=====
Expert Suggestion:

‚Ä¢ Keep serving with love.¬†
=====
Meal for two: 300-800
=====
Summary:¬†

Food Quantity 4/5
Food Taste 4.4/5
Hospitality 4.2/5
Value for money 4.1/5¬†
Ambiance (Road side kiosk so cant say much about it.)¬†
=====
Conclusion:¬†

Would love to visit their restaurant when it gets completed. Really enjoyed the mutton. Next time shall visit at day time to enjoy the satisfying meal.¬†
=====
Tried chicken roast and chicken roll on second visit. Excellent is the word. Very pocket friendly affair.

Must not forget #70Rs for chicken Biryani. Will surely try on the third visit.
=====
Recently tried Chicken Fry, Chicken Changhezi and Chicken Biryani. Biryani was excellent for the price offered. The Chicken could have been marinated for a little longer so that the masala's could seep in. Chicken Fry was masaledar and hot. Chicken Changhezi had two pieces of chicken in a little tomato gravy. It is highly recommended to make chicken Changhezi a little more spicier. Rest, all is well. :) Cheers.

located in the lane behind quest mall. this is quite a popular place to have kebabs at really cheap rates. this place stays completely crowded every evening. ambiance is below average. not very hygienic even. service is slow. but their food is just lip smacking! specially their roasted chicken, and chicken reshmi kabab. ^_^ you might wanna avoid the chutney they provide with that, cause its almost just coloured water. apart from kebabs, their rolls and the alu paratha are really tasty and serve as a quick and delicious evening snack. if u are a chicken lover, then u must visit this place and try out their roasted chicken or chicken reshmi malai kabab with alu paratha. ^_^
p.s. (the old one closed down due to some issues, so they opened up a new one somewhere nearby there only).

There are hardly any places in Kolkata where you can get such delicious chicken preparations at such a cheap rate. This is a must visit for all Mughlai food lovers. Conveniently located at a stone-throw distance from Quest Mall, this is frequented regularly by local people and eager foodies.

Their Roasted Chicken, Fried Chicken, Chicken Reshmi Kebabs and Chicken Changezhi are some of the best they have up in their list. Roasted Chicken usually comes in small size and is topped with a succulent curd gravy. The gravy is prepared by mixing in the marination of the chicken, curd and melted butter. The Kebabs are soft and succulent and is accompanied with authentic butter and melts in your mouth.

The Changezhi is a rich preparation of Chicken and goes well with Paratha. To end, if you are looking for ambiance, decoration and cleanliness, this place isn't for you. However, if you are a true foodie and want to taste some delicious stuffs, this should be the place you must come to.

Heard about this from Zomato ... They have a small outlet near Park Circus Bridge No. 4 ... So decided to check it out today on my way home ... Unfortunately tikia rolls were not available so I opted for plain chicken roll ... I must say this is THE YUMMIEST 'en-rolled' chicken I ever tasted .. The size of the roll disappointed me a bit but one must consider the cheap price @28 bucks ... The service was swift ... Ambience okayish .. & considering the general filthiness of the area the hygiene of this joint came as a welcome surprise for me ... Would definitely recommend ... & looking forward to try their famous Chicken changezhi :)
Note: The rating is lowish coz I am yet to taste majority of what they have on offer :) Cheers!

After hearing and reading a lot about this place, I planned a visit today. After reaching at Quest Mall it took me 5 minutes to find the place. The place is conveniently located.

Decor: The place is not very big, has 5 tables and can seat about 20 people in one go. The place in not air conditioned has some fans with some pictures of Islamic holy places.
Food: The quality and the quantity both are very good compare to the price. I went there with my 2 friends. We ordered 1 half chicken roast (11 piece) 1 half chicken fry (11piece), 1 reshmi malai kabab (7piece), 2 chicken biryani, 3 laccha paratha.
Our bill came Rs 588. This include 4 cold drinks.
The chicken roast came with a smooth curd sauce. Taste really awesome. The chicken were nicely roasted with spices and perfect seasoning. However the sauce was bit salty to my taste.
The chicken fry was assisted with mint chutney and standard green salad. The fries were large and chunky. However some of the pieces were fried too much turning them bit dry and chewy.
The Chicken Reshmi Kabab were awesome. The chicken were nice and juicy. The chicken juices were intact and nicely flavoured.
The chicken biryani was nicely seasoned and not too oily. The chicken pieces were very huge and solid. The potato were nicely boiled and soft. The biriyani was lite and good to taste.
Laccha Parathas were large in size and nicely fired with outside crisp and soft inside. Went perfectly well curd cream sauce of the roasted chicken.

Even though the place does not look very hygienic, it's a very affordable place to have huge quantity of chicken.
If you give food the first priority and the ambience the second this place is definitely for you.
It's a good place to have chicken dishes. Worth a second visit definitely.

As i read the zomato reviews I wondered how this place got such high ratings.And now I know why.This is one of those places which make this city a home to gazillion foodies.Paying heed to all the suggestions,I called them for home delivery instead of visiting.The biryani is almost as good as the big names like arsalan and shiraz,albeit a tad less aromatic,but comes,surprisingly,at half the price! Chicken chap wasn't available for the day,so we took a quarter of chicken changrezi ,which turned out to be a bit of luck and serendipity.They also make very nice lacha parathas.The chicken roast is not the usual roast we have come to know.They serve small cut pieces layered in gravy,and although that tastes quite good and is a catch at that price quote,they should really change the name.Its very misleading.They take orders after four in the afternoon,and cater home deliveries for a minimum order of two hundred bucks,and there is no extra charge for containers.

Visited this place today and i must say its really good.
Location- behind the quest mall
Ambience- a basic eatery with minimal hygiene, some tables and fans. So no fancy must be expected here.
Food- aah! Now this is what makes this place so special. We ordered
chicken reshmi kebab- soft kebab, cooked perfectly, melts in mouth, very buttery. Tastes perfect with hint of lemon. But the green chutney provided with it was a bit runny. Salad was normal.
Chicken breast roast- they provided the big breast piece, along with some small pieces. The gravy was curd based and tasted good.
Laccha parantha- was crispy and size was also big.
Prince- we had all these for Rs.200 including tips.
Will definitely revisit....

     I decided on what to order by reading the reviews on zomato. Likewise, we ordered half roasted Chicken and three Laccha paratha. The food went beyond my expectations. It was  awesome. The roasted Chicken came with malai cream and it tasted 'yum!'. The laccha paratha was soft and tasted excellent. It is a must try restaurant. Trust me, the ambience will not disappoint you after the great food is served rather you will feel like being in heaven.. üòÅ

Biriyani was okey, but the reshmi kababs were too good, soft, hot, smokey smelled and fresh, bcoz they did it in front of us. Then we ordered 3 more plates to resmhi kabab and 2 lacha paratha.. Lacha was also good.. And the service was prompt and the waiter was very friendly.. I must say this place is very very place for hangout with friends for a cheap and good quality of food..

This was some find. Later seeing the ratings in Zomato, I wondered how did I miss this till date. Found this corner while a random journey through the lanes. Located behind Quest Mall, this small joint serves our pellet right. Played safe by ordering a Reshmi kabab plate since the ambience was a turn off. But it was wonderful. That Lucknow touch. Delicate soft chicken pieces. Tried their biriyani, for 70 bucks you get a whole lot and it was just brilliant. Looking forward to a planned trip. A brilliant find.

Thanks to some of the fellow reviewer for digging out this blissful food joint nd writing such good things about it which eventually dragged me toward it!Tried it out this sunday in the evening. It 's very easy to reach the place but for some stupid reason we messed it up at first.LOCATION : it is just a couple of minutes away from the quest mall, park circus. It is located in the lane just beside quest. Just ask anyone (i mean some localite or a shopkeeper) about it around that lane nd u'll be guided well..SERVICE : Service is quite prompt. We were given the menu card as soon as we entered the joint. The service guy was enthusiastic enough to guide us through the menu nd help us choose the right dish that we wanted.FOOD : it's FINGER-LICKING good! The chicken roast was out of the world! It's a tandoori prep drenched in a concoction of curd & butter! It's the best gravy tandoori i've had in calcutta till date! The two of us ordered a half plate chicken roast nd rumali roti which was enough to feed two hungry glutton!¬†
***On a later visit with another friend, ordered chicken biryani and the good 'ol¬†chicken roast.. the chicken roast tasted just like before; heaven served on plate! while the biryani couldn't steal our hearts as it tasted quite regular, nothing new, cooked in dalda/vanaspati which was feeling not so pleasant inside our mouth after we were done...
***So, I would strongly recommend this place for kebabs, chicken roast, fish fry and not for biryani!
Advice to the Management : please pay attention to the cleanliness.. we can catch a good glimpse of the kitchen from outside! -_-MUST TRY OUT PEOPLE!

What to say....Thanks to Zomato. This is just located behined the lane Quest Mall. This is a tiny shop. But food is awesome. After reading the review me and my husband want to visit this place. We try the famous chiken roast, reshmi kabab, tikia fry, rolls and also biriyani.¬†
1. Chiken Roast - Every review say this it the signature dish . But frankly speaking we like it no so much as we thought. Its so so. 5/10
2. Reshmi Kabab- Only I can say every body must try it. It is 10/10.
3. Roll - Their roll is also very nice and juicy. so 9/10.
4. Biriyani- What to say. only just for 70/- chiken biriyani. ¬†Its just like home made biriyani. Not very special. But like it. Its very much lite. Worth for price.
5. Tikia Fry - In one word awesome. When ever I go there I always bring this.10/10

First time visited here with my friend Tanvir. It is located behind of Quest Mall. Its serves plenty of chicken dishes. We ordered chicken reshmi kebab, chicken tikka kebab and fish tikka and biriyani. All items were great in taste. Fish tikka was mouth melting. Seating arrangements were not good but service was top notch. At my second visit I tried chicken chengezi, Aloo paratha, rumali roti and reshmi kebab. Chicken chengezi was rich. But it was very delicious. If you don't like rich food don't try this. One must visit here.

First of all I'll thank Zomato. I found this small food joint searching here. It is situated near Quest Mall.A small place like this always tends to get ignored, specially from girls, because of its congested environment. The place has few seating arrangements with simple round plastic table and plastic chairs. Once you enter you start sweating and your eyes start watering from heat and smoke of cooking. We ordered roasted chicken full plate, chicken reshmi malai kabab and lachha paratha.The staff were courteous. First they served the green chutney with salad. One full plate chicken is enough for 3 persons. The chicken was juicy enough with buttery gravy.They took out Amul butter from fridge in front of us. Lol. The kababs were of high standards. One paratha was large enough to fill your stomach.
The place is worth your foody tongue and pocket.

'Shaina Chicken Corner' is located at New Kasia Bagan Lane near Beck Bagan,behind the Quest Mall.It is generally open after 4 p.m.Today I've visited here with my friends.The ambience of this restaurant is too bad,very congested & heating area.Few tables are here.They have two sections,one section is for fry,kebab items & other section is for roll items.We've ordered here Half Roasted Chicken,Half Chicken Fry & 3 parathas.After 10 minutes they served both items with pudina chutney & salad.They give 10 pcs chicken in the half plate.Roasted chicken is mixture of creamy gravy,this gravy is mixture of yogurt,butter,chilli powder.We've tasted this gravy with hot & soft paratha.It tastes just mind blowing.Chicken Fry is very delicious,well marinated,perfect combination of fry & chaat masala.I loved both items.Atlast we've ordered 3 thums up for digest the food.Price is very cheap.worth a visit.

As they say , Every big thing comes in small package... The reviews didn't lie...  Located right next lane to Quest mall, towards the Haldiram' s direction, just about a min and half walk , you will find this joint. It has seating arrangement, but I preferred take away.... I think it would be better to have the food inside though, as the juiciness of the kebabs would be best restored that way
.. No AC so might just turn very hot in summer days... And I feel I would eat inside certainly in the winter months .... The servers and the owner were courteous. Ordered the chicken reshmi kababs and the chicken tandoori half ...
 Enough to satisfy two people's kebab cravings... Freshly prepared at the open charcoal grill , the items have great succulence and flavor.. Especially the charred aroma is really good... I also liked the yogurt coriander based sauce.. Only thing I will recommend is to wrap the food items in metal foil to preserve the aroma and the juice... .Will be back for sure.

This place is very near to quest mall n quite easy to find. Just walk down the street beside of quest mall n u ll find this tiny little place on your lefthand side. This place opens at 4 P.M.                                                                             From outside it looks like a takeaway joint but there are few sitting arrangements inside. This place looks very old, poorly maintained. Quite uncomfortable to sit n dine-in.                               People working there are good well behaved, quite prompt service n were very patient with us. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† So after sitting down they gave us the menu and we blindly ordered their famous Roasted Chicken (half) , Fish Fry (250gms) , 2 Chicken Biryanis (as mutton biryani was unavailable). we wanted to order rumali roti n chicken changezi(which had a tomato based gravy) but we were informed that rumalis were not made before 6pm so cancelled both. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† First of all Full Points to the ROASTED CHICKEN. It was soft, juicy, tangy with the curd n butter gravy. The gravy was FINGER-LICKING GOOD. This was very unique. One should definitely try this one dish. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Then came the FISH FRY, i was disheartened by this one thing. i expected so much after reading all the reveiws. It was simply small pieces of deep fried mach bhaja. Due to overfrying the fish lost all its delicate flavours n juices. only a few pieces with the skin was enjoyable..... One can give it a pass. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† They served the biryanis along with the fries so they went cold CHICKEN BIRIYANI was good , less oily. leg piece was juicy, alu was not so good. but worth 70rs. Quantity was huge. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† All these were more than enough for 3people with good apetite.  Thank god we cancelled chicken changhezi.                                                                            Bill came around 350rs. Very very affordable. I ll give this 4 solely bcoz of chicken roasted. I do want to try their kababs n chaap.

This place is just a simple shabby dhaba which u might not even notice while passing by. So don't expect any good sitting arrangement or nice environment. A girl gang might not even like to have a seat here. Coz its not at al a photogenic place. U look uglier dan u were looking due to the intence heat nd constant sweating.
But the food will definitely turn u on! They make one of the finest Reshmi kawab I have ever tasted! It's covered with butter nd malai coating! Extremely soft nd lip smakingly delicious! Nd the greatest wonder is that u hav e to pay nly 90bucks for dis delicacy!
Another signature taste is their Roasted chicken. U can call it an upgraded version of tandoori chicken. Its awesome!
But the fried chicken is just okay type. Normal chicken deep fried in oil. Well crispy nd served with tasty green chatni nd salad. I rather liked the chatni than the chicken.
Clinch is the fried fish. It's 300/kg. Very cheap indeed. But wat u gona get is crispy deep fried Rohu fish wid bone! I men huz gona spend d bucks for having d fish dat u eat almost regularly at home. It tastes almost same as the "mach vaja" v hav at home. Nly litl more oily nd very hard fry so crispy. I didn lik it at all.
Well I wl surely visit another time to taste kawab, Roasted chicken nd try out changezi!

Just visited this place after reading such praising reviews and ratings.. The place is like a dhaba, not at all a proper restaurant and Very poorly kept.
Now coming straight to the food.
Ordered :rost chiken breast, fried chiken breast, chiken reshmi kabab, fish fry 250gm.
Rost chiken was very good served with some curd gravy. It has lots of flavour and was realy good. Then we tried the reshmi kabab, ! Beautiful! Very soft, buttery and it melts in your mouth.. .
Then coming to Fish fry and chiken breast fry. They are the worst.. I was really pissed and disappointed with those two dishes. There was no decency on those two dishes! I ordered fr chiken breast fry.. And wat they served was simply deep fried chicken.. Those pieces was neither marinated nor had any kind a flavours.. They sprinkled chat masala and that was that! Then there was the fish fry! My god! They were serving rui or rahu fish fried in deep oil! (rui mach baja! ! ) and again sprinkled chat masala! If those were called fish fry then I don't want it.. It was really sad and pathetic to eat those fries..there was no mentioning about what kind of fish they are frying And what is fish fry according to them.. My rating is clearly based on rost chiken and kabab. I would definitely comeback if crave for kababs someday.! but m never dining over here again with my gf, Becz the environment was toooooo sick.

This place might not be ideal for your sit and eat kinda ambience, but its lip smackin and pocket friendly. Its kebabs are wondefully made with the right kind of afghani touch which usually u would find in the north side. Reshmi chicken, chicken tikka,fried breast pieces and tandoors are definitely a try if u have an apetite to taste all of them together though. And yeah the alu paratha is too good a try cause of its softness and taste specially when its hot. The food is hygenic cause they give special care towards that. In the end don not go by the outlook of the shop cause it has a  greater side to it,and you wouldnt regret once you try it. Next tym u visit quest and you wanna try some juicy kebabs do check in this place and am sure you gonna repeat your visit.

Went to this place after reading so many positive reviews and it was worth it.
Situated in the lane just beside Quest mall,this eatery has a small , a bit unkempt dining area.
We ordered half chicken roast,a chicken leg fry and a biryani. The chicken roast was well-cooked with a nice tangy malai,chicken fry was the star of the day...very crispy yet thin coating on top , with a superb taste. They serve a green chutney and cut cucumber and onions on the side.
The biryani was passable but that's alright since its extremely low-priced.
Pocket-pinch was 260 bucks. Totally going back there again.

Shaina is a tiny gem of a place that leads to an astounding gastronomic epiphany the moment the first bite from its chicken reshmi malai kebab starts melting in your mouth with an explosion of sheer buttery delight. Well, that pretty much sums up this place, but a little more detail won‚Äôt hurt when it comes down to some lip-smacking fare at very low prices.

We are never late to try out a newly found place if it assures to be light on the pocket. And, we don‚Äôt give two hoots what surroundings we‚Äôre eating in, as long as the food is tasty. Shaina Chicken Corner, which boastfully promises one of ‚ÄúDelhi ka maza Kolkata mein‚Äù is situated on a lane right next to the Quest mall. Entering the unkempt little dining space, we seated ourselves and ordered for the chicken reshmi malai kebab, chicken roast and romali rotis. As soon as the food arrived piping hot, we dug into it with full devotion. The chicken roast had a mixture of some leg and breast pieces, nicely charred, a bit chewy and on a bed of a light but tangy curd based sauce. They were devoured with the romali rotis, which we felt could‚Äôve been softer. The kebabs were soft, delicious and had a creek of molten butter flowing out of them. We dipped a kebab into the butter, took a bite, dipped it again and repeated until the plate was wiped clean. Even though it was a bit too salty, we were hardly bothered by it.

On another day, we packed some kebabs and fish fry for home. Small cubes of the fish with bones are fried till crispy and packed after sprinkling some chat masala on top. They tasted awesome and were perfect for a light snack with some tea. Overall, this place might not be polished and petite, but it does fulfill its promise with a lot of savour!

Recently we tried out their chicken biryani and it was one of the tastiest biryanis we've ever had! Laden with a generous amount of oil, it might not be too healthy a dish. But then, who cares when you get a plate overheaped with the sweet and spicy long-grained rice, a huge piece of boiled potato and a nice big chicken leg marinated in spices all for 70 bucks?! :)

Read a few reviews for Shaina Chicken corner on Zomato and was wondering if the place is really worth the hoopla, especially considering the dirt cheap prices. So, I decided to go in and figure out for myself. 
This place is just a stone's throw from Quest Mall on Syed Amir Ali avenue. It's a non-description place, essentially a take-away, though they have a few chairs and tables inside. You can smell the aroma of kebabs and biriyani from a distance and it's surely going to make you hungry...very hungry!!!
I ordered for half portion of the famous roast chicken and reshmi kebab, both for take-away. The roast chicken is a bundle of joy. The half portion has 11 decent pieces, layered with a thick layer of spicy yogurt gravy. There's a subtle hint of smokiness to the roast chicken. It is definitely worth all the accolades it has got. You can have it as it is, or try having it with a couple of rumali roti (which are also very cheap). I'm sure that this is one of the best roast chicken that I have ever had. 
The chicken reshmi kebab...my mouth is still watering. It's better than a lot of star restaurants....succulent juicy chicken pieces...7 of them for just 90 bucks...comes with a slight gravy, possibly from the marinade. Guys seriously try the reshmi kebab here....you may just get addicted...I am and I know I'm going back to have it again.....btw....I also tried the egg chicken roll and it was very good. 
The best part was the picket punch....half a roast, one reshmi, 9 rumali rotis and one egg chicken roll all for just INR 275....your tummy and your wallet will both feel happy. 
Btw....seriously note that this place may turn you extremely greedy and gluttonous...

If someone would ask Me if I want to go to a star restaurant or here. I wouldn't waste a millisecond to take this places name. Food with emotions is served here. Something that Is not found all over Calcutta. Try out each and every thing on the menu, as nothing falls short of the other. Most importantly even after you do so you won't find your wallet any lighter than with what u walked in with, as it's ''impossibly" cheap.

Another mindblowing find from the zomato treasure chest!!!!! 
THIS QUANTITY AND QUALITY AND TASTE AT DIRT CHEAP RATES!!!! 
I actually thought the menu given on zomato was of 5yrs ago. But to my awe yes!!!! You actually get a chkn biriyani at 70!!!!
the chicken breast fry with approx 10 medium chicken pieces fried to crispy perfection is at a bill of rs70
And the famous roast chkn comes with this awesome yoghurt gravy.... Very unique and very very very relishing. 
Frankly speaking i have never see so much chicken being cooked in front of my eyes!!!!they serve their dishes with salad n a green chutney. 

Pooja verdict-Run for it. And thank me later.

OH MY GOD!!!!.. OH MY GOD!!!!!!... That was literally my expression when me and my girl came out of Shaina Chicken Corner. Uff... What an experience.
Location-behind Quest Mall.
After a long day of practical examination of Calcutta University, we were hungry like hell. I practically dragged her to this place. Now, locating this place was not difficult at all. All you need is GPS..?.On entering the lane we could smell the aroma of kebabs, Our mouths were watering then and there. Now, located this place.. But while entering we had to wait for five minutes,because they were cleaning their shop. Got a seat. Now, there were food everywhere. Ambience was not up to the mark.. But the food.. My goodness, made up for everything. We first ordered half roast chicken, but they told us that it will take 15 minutes. So we decided to have breat fry first. The breast fry came with green chutney and salad,and we just dug in. The chicken pieces were hot, fresh, tasty, yummy, deliciously cooked. My mouth is watering right now. We were so busy gorging on it, dat we did not notice that a point on our mouth has burned. Hehe. Awesome dishes.
Now came the star of the show, the half roast chicken. The Chicken pieces were sooo tender, fresh, juicy.... Delicious to the power of infinity. The yoghurt gravy with roasted chicken was fantastic, it was so fingerlickingly deliciousl. I was licking my plate after finishing the food. I loved every moment of it. The waiters are well behaved as well. I am certainly going there again.

After reading delicious reviews on zomato today I decided to go there after college with my boyfriend... It took time to find the restaurant I called the number which I found on zomato... The guy helped us a lot he not only directed but also waited for us in the road... Place description: small place good for take away there are many round tables with 4 chairs.. But the people will stare at you in a way that you can feel uncomfortable while eating.. Well we ordered : Half chicken roasted(with a creamy texture of dahi and chilli powder, chicken is softly cooked with tandoori flavor) served with salad and green chutney, 4 rumali Roti's (2 for each), and 2 cold drinks.. They billed: only 188/-...
P.s- I wanted to try the fish fry??

I have been eating from here since the time this place opened up so this place definitely deserves a review.. Starting with the rolls.. They are delicious!! What I love abt the place is their chicken fry, the taste of it takes u to the streets of old Delhi where they have this similar kind of chicken, it's mouthwatering.. The roasted chicken comes with a layer of cream which is very different from the other places.. The fish fry too is very good.. Now the Biryani.. What do I say!! It's amazing.. U get to have a plate of tasty chicken Biryani just for ‚Çπ70.. Unbelievable right?? N whats even better is tht they have a speedy free home delivery option.. Well v r js lucky to have such places..;)

I decided to pack home some chicken roast and fry from here and ordered half of each. The fry had a thin coating and was not greasy at all. Served with the pudina coriander chilli chutney and salad it was great. But the roast chicken...with the creamy gravy on top was what I wanted! Think pieces of chicken dunked in a spicy yogurt gravy. I nearly polished off my sister's share till she pulled the plate out of my hands.

I have been waiting to try this place ever since i have read the reviews online and the menu has been enticing me for the last few days.

I was at quest mall and decided to log onto zomato and realise that the place was a stone's throw away and to my good luck it had loads of non veg.

As the car approached the place i could smell fresh kebabs fresh kebabs being grilled on charcoal and and aromatic biryani that was enough to get me celebrating with joy. What maybe made me even happier was the sight of large pieces of fried fish darnes.

I decided to order 250 grams fried fish and half roasted chicken and to my surprise the roasted chicken came topped with creamy spicy sauce and the fish was crispy fried and had loads of chaat masala sprinkled on it. Both the dishes were packed and taken home. And whoa they were tasty

The feel good factor was when the check arrived and it was just 205 rupees.... my jaw dropped such good food at such price

Overall i know this is the meat lovers paradise i am coming back here for sure. And when i'm back next I'm gonna have a huger appetite.

Simply outstanding. Good food no frills . High five .
