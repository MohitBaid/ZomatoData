Good for a quick snacking outside airport when you are on the move. Came to my rescue when I took early train to reach airport and had to skip breakfast. staff behavior is really nice. Food is quite good.

The food is good . but the hospitality is not yet satisfactory ., like we never wanted a packaged water but they forcefully gave it to us. And moreover this is probably the first restaurant where a order can't be cancelled . really disappointed with the stuffs and their hospitality. Need to improve much more.

We wanted to book their Resto Pub for a party. Their front office manager appeared disinterested, rude and ignorant about dealing with customers who have walked in to inquire Â about their venue.

Good ambience, fine for family eating out, spacious, above all food is very good. Not at all costly compared to the quality and quantity. Luxurious interior compared to popular restaurants nearby.
