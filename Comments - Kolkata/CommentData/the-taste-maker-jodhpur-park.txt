I definitely loved dining in here.. they are open till quite late at night which a lot of people doesnt know. Quality and quanity wise it is pretty decent. 
Please takecare of the ambience; i am sure this place has a lot of potential. 
Smoked chicken, dry chilly chicken, chilly pork was the best out the rest we ordered. A plate of mixed rice and a plate of mixed chow was enough for 4 well grown men.. so you can well understand that the quantity is very good. Staff well behaved young men. Severs you hot food in no time
Overall realllly satisfied and happy with the taste amd service.

I have ordered chicken thai noodle and mixed american choupsey through FoodPanda on last Sunday. The food was mediocre.noodle in the thai chicken noodle was more boiled. gravy of the Choupsey was not thick to exact level but bit diluted.Overall a mediocre food.

Very very impressed. Quite of a hidden gem. It was pretty late when we ordered, yet the person on the phone was patient and helpful. Delivery was right on time and food packaging was good. We had ordered Cantonese gravy chowmein and garlic chicken which was their recommendation. We had specifically asked to make it less spicy and they did that well without compromising with taste of the dishes. Both the main course and the side dish tasted very good. Looking forward to trying out their other dishes. 
Also the biggest plus point was their good quantity of food at a very pocket friendly cost. Thumbs up.

A hidden gem, if ever there was one.
The place doesn't look very appealing from the outside, but inside it's pretty cosy. 
The food too is of good quality, taste at a very reasonable price. Hard to find faults when a restaurant ticks most boxes.

This restaurant is located near the Jodhpur Park. We were a group of seven people and we visited the place during the Durga Puja after having visited the Jodhpur Park Puja Pandal. The place looked to be under construction and was almost full. The staff ensured we got a seven seater table by adding some extra chairs to a four seater one. We ordered Egg Fried Rice for main course along with Stir Fried Pork with Honey and Wine and Oyster Chicken. The Egg Fried Rice quantity was a bit too less as compared to ones we receive at other restaurants and would just suffice a single person. The rice also tasted to be a bit stiff and slightly undercooked. The Oyster Chicken dish had 12 pieces of chicken in it and was accompanied by gravy. It tasted very nice and was the best dish of the evening. The other side dish, Stir Fried Pork with Honey and Wine had shredded pieces of pork along with gravy. I liked the gravy of the chicken dish as compared to the pork dish. I felt the restaurant had an inadequate amount of staff especially for a hectic period like that of the Durga Puja when the restaurant is expected to be full. After repeated requests for water, the staff failed to be prompt. The staff were also quite late to deliver the bill and scantily handed us the bill without any after food accompaniment. All in all, I feel The Taste Maker has a number of areas of improvement in order to pull in crowds throughout the year.

Avoid this restaurant. Nothing is authentic here. I tasted their Thai food - Tom Yam soup, Chicken Sweet Basil, Pork Chilli Thai style & TM Special Fired Rice.....All I can say is - just by putting a few bits of lemon grass does not make it a Thai Cuisine! If you like the typical Calcutta Chinese, you'll like their food....but, don't go looking for "AUTHENTIC". One of the worst Tom Yam I've ever tasted. And the pork they serve - it's just fat - no pork meat. We are paying - at least give us some meat!

Wish I could give 0 rating.We went there around 3pm and the waiter told us it will take 30 mins to serve.As it was raining heavily outside ,we agreed.The waiter had no clue about the menu and couldn't guide us.We settled for a chicken Manchurian rice and Hong Kong chicken.After 5 mins another person came and told us that it will take time.After asking  much time will it take to prepare ,their reply was food will not be available.

Very pathetic service 
Why do you open a restaurant if you cant serve food?

Its a small eatery near EEDF, went to have their Thai delicacies- smoked fish, Thai chicken green curry and chicken Thai fried rice. 
Smoked fish tasted like pan pried fish but of good taste 10 pieces. Green curry had a Wonderful flavor of lime leaf and butter and had 10pieces. Thai@ rice 1plate will surely serve two hungry souls.

Although the place doesn't see a lot of crowd service is pretty fast. We settled for a plate of chicken momos, Fish in sweet basil sauce and TM special Thai Rice. Food was good and the quantity filling. Prices are moderate. Overall a decent experience and a good place for a nice not too pricey meal.

We ordered chicken Thai rice and Chicken green curry, along with chilly pork. The rice was average, with a profusion of lemon leaves. The chilly pork was way too oily and more fat than meat, but would still work as a dish. However, the chicken green curry was terrible - evidently ¬†made with the readymade green curry paste, which is not really the problem -- the problem was that the chicken pieces were crumb fried, and undercooked to boot. Should have probably stuck the basic chinese fare of chilly chicken chowmein which is difficult to go really wrong with.

We were walking in the streets of Jodhpur park on a hot and humid day, very hungry and struggling to find an air conditioned place where we could eat!

Then we searched on Zomato and found The Taste Maker which was listed as a hidden gem in Kolkata!

We walked up to this restaurant, and were really happy to find it coz we were starving! The restaurant on the first look is quite spacious and interiors are simple but very quirky with the brick walls!

Since we are vegetarians  we decided to stick to very basic food which is Chilli paneer and hakka chowmien..

Chowmien was delicious and chilli paneer was yum but a little salty! 
All in all, a nice place to enjoy some delicious chinese and tibetan food without much of a pocket pinch!

Located at Jodhpur Park, this is an average restaurant serving Oriental cuisine. Food quality is just ok. Nothing great. Price wise quantity is justified. Hakka noodles being one of  their popular dishes lives upto the expectations.  The smoked chicken was palatable. Service and decor were just alright.

This joint is very close to Jodhpur Park Puja Pandel in South Kolkata.¬†We visited this place after a tiresome day in university , and yes, we all were bit hungry. When we entered into the joint, it was empty, and we got a comfortable place.¬†
From outside, this place is not so prominent, and the seating arrangement is separated from the kitchen, and they have a small seating arrangement outside as well.¬†
We opted for chilli Pork dry and Taste Maker special mixed rice noodles. The food was really awesome and fresh. Chilli Pork was very proper and the mixed rice noodles was good as well. All Chinese joint does not prepare rice noodles, and I liked the taste of it.¬†
I can remember almost one year back , I had ordered Veg Thai rice and smoked chicken to have our lunch in home . Both of these preparations were good as well. This is quite value for money joint.

Ordered food online from here .. overall review about the food is "AWESOME" . we ordered roasted chilli pork or chilli roasted pork. . (Dono mein se kuch ek naam hoga ü§î ) mixed hakka noodles and chicken hakka fry .. the three items were awesome . Pork dish was super delicious .. hakka noodle was good and the chicken platter was itself a heaven . Those who are concerned with the price , let me tell you .. they give sufficient for 2 in that price ..( if u r not bhukkad and dont want to share the whole dibba with anyone üòé ). Am on bhukkar and FATTER side so there is no chance of sharing food too for me . Attaching the pork platter with this post . Dekho aagar me mein paani aa jaye toh order kaarkey apna bhuk mitalo .. baaki items ka photo nehi khicha .. magan tha khaaney mein .. ! Chao!

Yesterday during my cancelled night shift, i did not had so many choices to order from. As of my bad luck two of the restueants i oderrd from in the checkout page it showed that they have stopped taking orders. I lastly oderd from here. It was 2 veg combos with veg haka noodles & veg rice variation. I must say that the food quality was quite good and the quantity was too. The food consisted good quality. Although i did place my order through √†t 10.38 pm but the food reached us at 11.50. The delivery boy from swigy complained that he waited long in the restaurant to get it done. But regarding the food it was tasty.

I had went to the restaurant several times, with my friends, sister, and even with my g.f.. I really love the chinese dishes here, the waiting time after placing the order is really boresome, as it takes about 45mins. lastly, i visited the place on 28th january, and came to know that here tax is applicable, then i made up my mind that i will not visit the restaurant that frequently becoz the average cost exceeds my pocket money.. So i'm visiting the restaurants like lokaahar,hanglas and hanglatherium which is tax free..

Being located close to our house, we quiet often visit this place or order for home delivery. Entrance of the place is very unassuming. The sitting and decor is simple, so is the menu and choice of option. Very reasonable priced food. However the cleanliness of the place needs to be improved for sure.We love Pam fried momo, schezwan fried rice, boneless chilly chicken dry, pan fried noodles, sweet and sour fish and chilly prawn. Quality of food is good but slightly inconsistent in taste. May be the chef is changed frequently.

The place is the shizz! We have been taking food from here for the last 10 years and the quality of food has been consistent! The food tastes delicious, is always fresh and the quantity is great for the cost. They have a variety of dishes that you will find difficult to get anywhere else. Staples at our home are Ginger Capsicum Rice and Chilli Honey Chicken.
Every guest we have served this to has raved about it. They have recently opened a seating area too (though I haven't dined there as yet). I would also recommend the dry Chilli Chicken- its better than most places you have had at!

Despite living really close to this place, I hadn't sampled much of their food. Reading rave reviews about their roast chilly pork dish (and feeling very hungry on a weekday afternoon), I decided to order in. While the food was pretty decent, it was nothing to write home about. The pork was tender but the dish had an overwhelming sense of greasiness. The pork fat could have been crisped up somewhat. Delivery was late, which meant it was a long wait for some average food. Would probably not be repeating.

Tried their non-veg fried rice combo by ordering through. The food was delicious and perfect for the consumption of one. It consisted of chicken fried rice, shredded chilli chicken (3pieces) and roasted chilli pork (5-6 pieces). The chilli pork was tender, succulent and spicy. The shredded chicken had a sweet and tangy taste. The chicken fried rice was well cooked and aromatic. Overall, quite good food. Looking forward to visit their outlet

The Taste Maker- The name itself brings out the inner foodie in you even if you aren't a foodie.  The joint can accommodate upto 25-30 people at most. It also has a outdoor sitting area which can be quite pleasant experience in winter mornings. coming to the ambience , this place has an unique approach which is an amalgamation of retro and modern looks. Coming to the food which i along with my friends ordered.
1. Roasted chilli pork- Being a hog lover i can't resist ordering. The delivery came in a moment's notice. Thin slices of pork tossed with onions and capsicum. And to one's satisfaction they gave decent lean meat than fat. overall it was juicy and tossed perfectly. Rating-3.5/5
2.T.M spl Thai rice- Boy it sure tasted good! Its one of the best flavored rice i have had in a long time. Cooked perfectly with bellpapers, prawns and other veges. The aroma came from the lemon grass which they add in the rice. Its a must if you visit here. Rating-4.8/5
3. Honey Chilli Fish- This was another blast. It had big chunks of fish coated and fried ,then cooked with semi thick gravy. Its unique taste is sure to hit your tastebuds haaard! The fish smelled fresh and had a sweet and sour taste as you can guess from the name itself and it served perfect with the rice we ordered. Rating-4.5/5.
Overall had a good experience with the food. The items are decently priced and won't burn a hole in your pocket. If you want to give a treat to your friends this is one such place where you can get good and affordable food. Plan to visit many more times here.. cheers....

A sudden visit due to hunger strike. But a VERY BIG MISTAKE. Horrible food and service. Ordered smoked fish and sweet corn chicken soup. After 15 mins we are told that more half and hour is required. When we proceeded to cancel our order, the so called smoked fish dish was served within 5 mins. However it was sweet and sour fish with lemon dressings. The soup too was too sweet and the corns were half boiled. I never gave such a negative review for anyone. But this place is truely horrible

This a nice place to taste some good lip smacking Chinese dishes. Located in Jodhpur park, near South city Mall. The place newly renovated, and the brick wall with picture of some famous personalities on it give this place an attractive look. Spacious with 35-40 sitting arrangements. Ambiance is really enjoyable, with soothing music playing in the background. Service is fast and staffs are friendly. 

Got an invitation for food testing event and enjoy a lot with my fellow foodie friends. 

For starter we had Roasted Chili pork, Hakka Prawns, Devil's Chicken, Chicken with black bean sauce and Smoked Chicken. Every item was nicely cooked and delicious, with a perfect blend of spice and aroma, pork, chicken and prawns were really soft and juicy.

In the main course we had 

Chicken Thai Rice- Spicy fried rice prepared with egg and chicken. Very aromatic and full of flavour. Chicken Jai Thai noodles were also great. We also tried Pickled Ginger Chicken which had tangy flavour, little bit different but taste good. Chicken with Chinese vegetables was also good. A healthy food dish very much recommended. 

Overall it was a great experience for all of us. Really enjoy their hospitality with mouth-watering Chinese and Thai preparation. Prices are quite reasonable. The Taste Makers are really making some good taste. 

Thanks a lot

The taste Maker is located at Jodhpur Park and mainly serves Chinese & Thai cuisines.

Ambience & decor  is pretty nice, spacious and embellished with pictures of famous personalities accompanied with nice music.

Service is quick and staffs are well behaved.

Pocket pinch is reasonable and quality & quantity is good too.

I went there on the eve of a good tasting event.

For starters, we had - 

1) Roasted Chilli pork- juicy, tasty with nice flavour. A must try. Highly recommended.

2)Hakka Prawns-  impressive size, juicy and very tasty. A must try. Highly recommended.

3) Devil's Chicken - was tasty with sweet and spicy flavour.

4) Chicken with black bean sauce- was nice too.

5)Smoked Chicken- tangy, succulent and again a must try. Recommended.


For Main course , we had- 

1) Chicken Thai Rice- flavoured with lemon grass & Kaffir lime leaves was very aromatic and processed a brilliant taste. A must try. Highly recommended.

2) Chicken Jai Thai noodkes- flat noodles, was well cooked and was tangy and very tasty. Recommended.

3)Pickled Ginger Chicken- was average , nothing to rave about.

4) Chicken with Chinese Vegetables- had generous fillings and was quite good.

A very satisfying experience. Would like to revisit again. This place is surely a gem with authentic food at an affordable price.

Thanks Rajdeep Da for your lovely invitation

This one is long overdue. Taste Maker has been quietly serving some of the best Pan Asian food in South Calcutta for several years. The food is top notch, reasonably priced and prompt delivery. The newly renovated restaurant has a very chic bohemian feel. Don't miss the chilli pork, the best you will taste south of Chinoiserie in Taj Bengal.

I had visited this place many a times before, but today went in to see it all renovated and changed for the good. Ordered Roasted Chilli Pork, Devil's Chicken and Pan Fried Chicken momo. All the dishes were delicious, though their pork dishes just stand out. It's easy on pocket and serves you good portion of food. I look forward to go back there again.

Location : If you're coming from South city side, Take the road just alongside EDF, head straight and you'll see this restaurant!

Decor & Ambience : The place has been revamped and the makeover is pretty sweet. Framed posters of famous personalities adorning Vibrant white walls. Good music and spacious interiors make sure that this place scores high in this category!

Food :¬†

Smoked chicken : ¬†Strips of chicken stir fried with bell peppers and tossed in a tangy sauce was served. The chicken strips was well cooked as well as extremely juicy. Loved this dish!

Hakka prawns : Who doesn't love shrimps? The size of the shrimps was impressive and this dish was lip smacking!

chili honey fish : This dish was excellent. Very thinly battered fish tossed in this honey chili sauce tasted awesome!!¬†

Mixed Thai rice : One of the best thai rices I've ever had. The rice was flavoured with lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves, the aroma alone would make anyone swoon!¬†

Roasted chili pork : I believe there is no greater pork lover than me. And this place does justice to the pork. The pork was of a very fine cut, not too fatty! The flavours were amazing, totally satisfied with this dish!

Service : The staff is very polite and courteous. The owners are very amiable and well-mannered.¬†

Highly recommended!!

The place might not look appealing from the outside since they have not honestly worked much on the entrance. But once inside, on your left you'll see the place is being beautified and efforts are being made to make it look nice! The black, red and white decor stands out, Ac seating arrangements. The place can hold upto probably 40 people. Service is slow and the servers need some training but they will be fine with time. The food however is quite nice! We tried their lung fung soup, loved the presentation but would recommend to switch to glassware bowls for soups rather than a steel bowl for hygiene issues. Next on order was the chicken thai fried rice which was flavorful and perfect on taste. Followed by some roasted chilli pork which had a good amount of pork meat and quite a lot of fat too. I detest pork fat but the meat was cooked to perfection and tasted nice. They do have a card machine but due to network issues the payment could not get through, hopefully they will work on that. But otherwise a nice and quite a reasonable place for a dine out or home delivery!

Lip smacking food, friendly ambiance and a moderate pocket pinch? If that is what you are looking for, head straight to The Taste Maker. Located near eedf nursing home, this is a fairly large place which serves authentic chinese and thai dishes.¬†I dropped in with a few friends and tried quite a few dishes.¬†
Hakka prawn- It was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Totally an amazing dish
Roasted chilli pork- THIS was the show stealer! The pork was juicy with a generous amount of pork fat.¬†
Smoked chicken- a nice dish and the kafir lime added all the more flavour to the dish.
chilli honey fish- ¬†Another wonderful dish and a must try.¬†
mixed thai rice- The rice is indeed something for which you have to come back again and again. he kafir lime added the extra falvour to the rice.
Overall, it was a very nice experience. the staff is very efficient and well informed about the dishes.¬†Would definitely recommend this place.

This review is strictly based on the Food part and not on the decor, ambiance etc. because The Taste maker is yet to complete the interior work.¬†

Take the lane adjacent to the EEDF and walk straight to reach the restaurant.¬†

We ordered :

Hakka Prawn: Totally loved it. Little crispy outside and well cooked, succulent inside. We loved it so much that we re-ordered it. 5/5.

Latmakai Chicken : Prepared in sweet and sour sauce, this dish of thin shredded chicken tasted good too. 4/5.

Smoked Chicken : Average preparation. Could have been better if they worked more on the smoky flavor. 3/5.

Hakka Stew Noddles : Dices of chicken in noodles with gravy. Perfect comfort food. 4/5.

Chilli Honey Fish : Another "WOW" & "MUST ORDER" dish. ¬†We re-ordered this too! 5/5.

Red & Green Pepper Chicken : Decent preparation of well cooked, perfectly spiced chicken. 4/5.

Mixed Thai Rice : Please do not miss this wonderful rice preparation. You will be craving for more unless you are already too full. We absolutely loved this dish! ¬†4.5/5.

Price : Absolutely Reasonable. Service : ¬†Great!

Recommended!

A fine cool evening, 30th November, 2016. 
With their latest expansion, their food quality has improved drastically so old reviews need to be checked.

Its no more a garage seating non ac restaurant anymore, but has expanded inside, with beautiful decor with naked brick walls with b/w photos and red doors, windows and tables. 

*Food* 
‚òÖ Smoked Chicken(8/10): The smokiness of this chicken starter is a treat to your tastebuds. 
‚ú©Hakka Prawn(10/10): This is something you would love to eat here. Brilliantly cooked and ingredient composition is apt. 
‚òÖLarmakai Chicken(6.5/10): This was a decent serve. Nothing too good to brag about. 
‚ú©Roasted Chilli Pork(10/10): Another palatable addition to their menu! Well cooked meat and sliced into small pieces. The flavors are beautiful. 
‚òÖChilli Honey Fish and Red Pepper Chicken: This might burn a hole in your pocket since it's so delicious, you will crave for a few more plates. 10/10
‚ú©Hakka Stewed Noodles and Thai Rice: These main course dishes are a must order on your next visit. You'll get hot and the best on dine in. Noodles were maggi but the gravy was stupendous. Rice was exemplary! 
Wish they had some desserts. 
0.5 less since, that's a tough score to give considering my previous restaurant experiences that high.

Tucked away inside EDF more of Jodhpur Park, The Taste Maker has some yummy Chinese and Thai dishes to offer. Went there with a big group of friends to try out their food on a friend's recommendation. It's quite evident that the place is still undergoing a makeover or renovation. The d√©cor and ambience is not a 100%. However,the bright lighting does give it a warm vibe. We tried the following dishes :-
Hakka Prawns- Looked pretty good. I couldn't taste it because of allergies but it was a hit around the table.
Chicken Lat ma kai- Chicken strips cooked in a sweet and spicy sauce with onions and bell peppers made this dish quite a Chinese delicacy.
Smoky Chicken- The smokey flavour of the chicken pieces,infused with Kaffir Lime was very delicious! I loved it.
Roasted Chilli Pork- Thin slices of pork cooked beautifully and with ample amount of belly fat,this dish was the star according to me. I took second and third helpings of this. A total must try dish for everyone.
Mixed stewed noodles- This was quite different than the regular Hakka noodles as the noodles had a saucyness about them. 
Mixed Thai rice- I don't think I have had a rice dish aa tasty as this one in a long time. This could have been eaten all by itself even without any gravy or side dish. The rice was light and non oily with abundance of the lemongrass flavour in it. Total winner.
Chilli Honey Fish- Battered fish cooked in a honey chilli sauce,this dish ticked the right boxes in terms of its taste. The fish was light as the sweetness of the honey flavour came out very well.
Chicken with red and green peppers- This was a staple Chinese  cuisine's main course. Tasted well,especially the gravy.
Overall,me and my friends were happy to have spent a good evening having yummy food amidst good company. The service was good as well. I loved the music played here,classic retro numbers.... Totally recommended!!

The place isn't much high on ambience but the food they serve makes it a hidden gem rightfully.Located in bylanes of Jodhpur park The Taste Maker serves really good Chinese food at a pocket friendly rate.I visited with a big group of friends so got to taste lots of their delicious dishes.For the starters we had

‚Ä¢Hakka prawn-These were stir-fried prawns which were fresh and tasted amazing.It was a hit all around the table.

‚Ä¢Smoked chicken-It had a lovely smoky note with flavour of Kaffir limes and lemon grass.The fragrance was tantalising.

‚Ä¢Lat ma kai chicken-These were shredded crispy chickens tossed in a sweet and spicy sauce.It was good too.

‚Ä¢Roasted chilli pork-It was amazing as well.Pork was crisp with yummy fat on it.. but not so much that it'll be too heavy.I just wish it was a bit more spicy.

For the mains we had

‚Ä¢Thai mixed rice-I haven't tasted such an amazing staple in a long time.The fragrance of kaffir lime and lemongrass was coming through the rice.It had a beautiful flavour.The dish was good enough to have it on its own..it doesn't need any side dish to compliment it.

‚Ä¢Honey chilli fish-The fish was soft and flaky.The sauce was so good.It had a perfect balance if sweet and spicy.

Do drop by when u are low on cash yet want to have good food and a great hangout time with your buddies.

I have seen this small joint for a long time from now.. but not being impressed with the interior thought of ordering food via home delivery... Located in jodhpur park, near eedf hospital this eatery is famous among college students.. Convinced by the reviews, thought of ordering food from here.. I ordered an EGG FRIED RICE and ROASTED CHILLI PORK..
NOW, talking about the food.. it was just a normal egg rice but it tasted pretty good and descent.. The roasted chilli pork was very tasty.. The pork was little bit oily but as it was lip smackingly delicious this little mistake can be ignored.. The chilli pork went great with the rice and both the dishes were pretty good and descent... So looking forward to this place again..

Putting ambience aside, this food joint serves one of the best Chinese in Jodhpur Park area. The place is quite easy to locate(keep walking straight after crossing EEDF). Its more of a take-away joint. We mainly order Mixed Fried Rice, Smoked Chicken, Garlic Chicken are their Smoked Chicken is my favourite! Their signature dish is the Chilly Pork. The prices are relatively cheap. ¬†This place is a must try!

Being the only 'proper' Chinese food joint in Jodhpur Park, this place has a plethora of dishes to offer. The hot garlic prawn and roasted chilli chicken in gravy are my two personal favourites . as a kid, I used to hog on the pan fried momos almost every evening. The place is basically a take away with minimal seating arrangement (except pujos... They go crazy during pujo).

My first Zomato Order. I had to cancel my first order as the food I ordered was not available. After a brief chat with Zomato guide, I reordered. The food came 30 minutes after the ETA.But that's fine considering the traffic jam for durga puja. 
Coming to the food. My order details and price are in the pictures. 
The food was very nice and tasty. The thai flat noodles were awesome. The Chinese side dish and the main course were also delicious perfectly seasoned and big chunks of boneless chicken. 
The thai foods were absolutely awesome. Lots of Thai seasonings and great tender chicken. 
A must try for Thai food lovers.

Ordered online on zomato at 8:20p.m. and got delivered exactly at 10:20p.m. So, u can see how fast they are. Just 2 hours and it was written estimated time to deliver is 45 mins, so they were just 1hr 15mins late. Coming to the food, ordered Veg Manchurian Hakka Noodles, Veg fried Rice and Veg in Thai Chilli Sauce.. Except the rice, other two items were simply awful to say the least. Neither i am going to recommend to any one nor I am crazy enough to order food from here again..

When I reached their I don't have much exceptions from the place... the place was shabby and dirty... With zero ambience and deco... so with full of confusion I placed my order for one jai thai mix noodles and one chicken with chinese vegetables... only confidence coming from the reviews of fellow foodies... got the parcel quite quickly and I moved towards home... now when I opened the containers the aroma increased my hunger... and after having the food... I fall in love with their preparations... Will surely going to try some of the delicacies again... and the good news is... it is a very pocket friendly place...

I really want to give them five but as i have tried only one item i am keeping the .5 in reserve...Had a sudden yearning for dry prok dish and started scrounging for something that might fit my bill.
Suddenly found that this outlet's signature dish was chilli pork, and they were even offering some discount if ordered through swiggy. The total cost was 195. 
Their quantity was really good, now let me come to the taste.....it was heavenly!! The succulent, juicy pork was perfectly served with satay ed vegetables that enhanced the taste.
If you are a pork lover like me , this is the dish you must try.

Take some tomato puree, add cornflour, and drop some dried babycorns, capsicum and cabbage (along with fortunately some kafir lime leaves and lemongrass sticks) and bingo - an innovative thai red curry is made !  Send it piping hot via swiggy to a customer on a sunday evening and make her unhappy.

I have never been so unhappy with any noodles served anywhere. Well i ordered Prawn Manchurian Hakka Noodles online and it wasn't worth what i paid. 

All the noodles were over-cooked and i think the MSG added to the noodles was more than the Prawns. üòí

Not very happy about the food still a 2.5 rating for making it spicy and no capsicum.

On a stroll back from south city to jodhpur park, to serve the hungry dino in my stomach, I was in the lookout for a small little eatery.

Since it was an evening snack, and the weather was quite pleasant, was looking forward to having something really spicy, when I saw this hoarding.. THE TASTE MAKER..

Spicy being the code , thai was something that was atuned on my mind. Walked in straight through the sparklingly lit pathway,  to find a few chair and tables lined up, an old fan struggling to freshen up thr air.

It meagrely looked like a food joint as the staffs said , they mainly do parcels and home delivery. Contrary to what it looked, the menu looked quite out of the place.

I could not believe my eyes, when I saw it was filled with fish , pork and prawn.

I could not stop myself from ordering a steamed pork momo followed by a Smoked fish. Well the pork momo was quite okayish. The filling was immense, but somehow I felt there was something missing in the momo. The clear soup served along with was marvellous. 

Disappointed,  I waited for the next dish to arrive. It took another 5 minutes to serve it. And I could smell the amazing potion. The smoked fish was absolutely mind blowing. The amazingly cooked fish and the mild smell of lemon grass, the thai spices. . All added to the flavour and made the thai dish quite authentic. 

Satisfied and tummy overfilled, the pocket pinch was not that heavy. The staffs amicable and willing to enquire. Looking forward to taste more of thai dishes.

This eatery is almost 15 yrs old! It's like the father of all chinese and thai take away joints around that part of kolkata.The food is really good and if you look at the bill then you will be even more happy. Frankly the ambience is nothing to roar about as this is primarily a take away joint. There are only two tables which are mostly used by customers to sit down and wait for their take away parcel to arrive. However during my last visit I was happy to see that they have acquired the entire ground floor and ready for a much awaited A/C sitting arrangements. A lot of continental dishes are to be introduced. Currently "ROASTED CHILLI PORK" is my personal favourite. Keeping their track record in mind I am sure they are not gonna disappoint. All the very best.

I have been to this place once with my friend as i wanted to have pork that day.... we ordered roasted chilli pork, stir fry pork and pork fried rice... stir fry pork was good and chili pork was okay okay as compared to stir fry... fried rice was not that good but the quantity was huge.... we ordered 1 plate of fried rice and we were shocked to see the quantity.... the quantity was like 2 plates of fried rice.... quantity is really huge as compared to the price..... but there are some negative points like the place is really shabby and it stinks like anything.... its dirty, street dogs roam around.... they take mininum 40 minutes to 1 hour to prepare the food..... its better to takeaway food than to sit over there.... they have place so may be they should utilize that....

It looks very shabby and the cats and mice running right beside the sitting area can be a turn off. But after you get the food, one is bound to be engrossed in the food itself and the background will fade into oblivion. But still, its better to opt for home delivery or takeaway. The thai they serve here is pretty amazing, and I go back to this place again and again.

I had food from this place at a time when it had a very high rating (4, as far as I can remember). I would always wonder why that place had such a high rating, and, after having the food, I couldn't find it out either.

One day, while returning home I was passing by it, and was super hungry, and decided to have food from The Taste Maker. I was a bit skeptical about the quality since the first step I put inside. It was shabby, dirty; a couple of plastic tables and chairs.

I'd take the food to my home, and ordered simple dishes: Egg hakka noodles, Mixed fried rice, Chilli fish Schezuan Chicken. All the items tasted horrible. The tastes were worse than roadside Chinese food. And there was very little difference between the Chilli and Schezuan sauce, they tasted almost identical, just that one had chicken, other had fish.

Just avoid this place at all cost.
They take too long to prepare the items.
The foods are horrible.

Sitting back at home trying to figure out from where to get a home delivery and trying to avoid pizza.......this name flashed in mind
The behavior of the particular attendant who received the call was comforting and helpful in suggesting dishes of our given choices
The young boy who delivered on mentioned time came up with a bill where the sum total of the price of the food we ordered was wrong and we had figure that out and had to explain their fault to him
After all this ......when we sat with out food we found out that ....that was not the food we ordered which was a disaster and disappointing
We had the food
As we were too hungry to call up again and return the food
Somewhat pocket friendly

I never understood why this place was hyped about. It was a below average takeaway 4-5 years back. Now, the quality had deteriorated even further.

After a long time I am back on Zomato to review a restaurant out of sheer irritation. I recently ordered lunch from Taste Maker. I had heard a lot about it and so decided to try it out.

In the Zomato page it is mentioned the shop opens at 1:00 pm. I called them up around 1:15 PM. The person taking the order told me he was out and will only call me back after 2:00 pm to take my order. He called me up as promised. My order was Egg Hakka Noodle( he even clarified if I wanted Gravy or Hakka ) and Honey Chilli Chicken Dry.

What got delivered to me was Chicken Fried Rice and Honey Lemon Chicken . And even the wrong order was totally unappetising. The rice had no salt and the gravy the chicken came in was sickly sticky and sweet. 

They should have received negative marks

It's mainly a take away joint. The shabby look of the place makes it next to impossible to sit there and eat. I am sure most of the people don‚Äôt even that this place exists. Its mainly a take away joint. 

The food is excellent. I have had food from this place many times.I love their hakka noodles, cantonese chicken, thai chicken in red curry and chilli pork. I love their use of lemon grass in thai dishes. Recently I had smoked chicken and dry chili chicken which had ten and eight pieces each. The quantity of the food is really good. A plate of rice is enough foe two people. Service is quick and I always get my order delivered at home by half an hour. Their quality doesnot fall during durga puja which I think is a very big issue for all local food joints. 

The cost is very less compared to the quantity and quality the provide.

This is also a takeaway - home delivery store in the Jodhpur Park area.. earlier used to be pretty ok, but the quality has been inconsistent of late. Also, their minimum order amount is quite high (Rs 300) whereas comparable stores deliver when the amount is around 150-200. Also, on calling up their store yesterday, I was informed that the minimum order has to be Rs 500! This is simply cashing in on the Puja festivities and totally uncalled for! I promptly disconnected the line. Rs 500 for food ranging from average to bad is asking for too much. Their gravy items are OK. Their fried rice and chowmein are not as good as they should be. The quality of rice used is below average and the gravy chowmein can be far better, Pretty average in my book. Stay away if you can!

Though the place is almost unrecognizable but only a southerner knows this eatery. Tightly couped inside an old building this so-called restuarant is good on pocket & pallet ¬†but if you ever think of dining here, do at your own risk. Though they have a small seating area still take out is the best option.

They serve a wide range of Chinese & Thai cuisines. While some are quite fascinating (as in the case of Pork barbecue, which I tried) while some are huge disappointments like their noodles section. Their rice section is quite affordable & is good on taste buds too.

Verdict - This place is ideal for people in it's locality who mostly order for quick takeouts. Forget about the hygiene of this place (one cannot except any). Not recommended unless one is in it's vicinity.

I have always got food delivered from The Taste Maker. On my recent delivery during one of the world cup matches, we ordered Cantonese noodles, smoked chicken and pan fried chilli fish. I was informed that the order will take about an hour to deliver. So it did, neither a minute less nor more. For the price it charges, the noodles are quite a lot and the Cantonese gravy is definitely one of the better ones that I have had in recent times from a shop of this stature. The fish was coated too thick with corn flour and thus made it a little difficult to make out if it was fish or chicken on the first bite. 
My favourite from this place has to be their smoked chicken. The beautiful blend of lemon grass with garlic never goes wrong and every time they manage to deliver exactly the same smell and taste that gets the tongue salivating in about a micro second of opening the packet. And it is quite credible that they maintain such consistency with the taste. 
When in dilemma, order the smoked chicken without a miss and your appetite will be satisfied over hassle-free indecision.

Not a good option for dining out with family as there is hardly two tables to sit. Better to go for a home  delivery. We have tried : Cantonese Noodles(good, but should have more pieces of prawn and chicken), Hot garlic chicken - dry (spicy and hot, chicken pieces were tender), chicken manchurian (hot and spicy with soft pieces of chicken), Hakka schezwan chowmin (spicy and was a bit salty and should have more pieces of chicken in it). Although the chicken pieces were soft, but the marination was done in the same way for all the recipes resulting in sour taste of all  the pieces. Service was very slow.We have to wait for more than half an hour to get the food. Price was very chep.

seeing the high rating and reading favorable reviews, i decided to order some thai food from here. their outlet is in jodhpur park and they deliver to jadavpur..no issues. order taking process was smooth. we ordered chicken satay, chicken thai noodles, chicken thai rice, chichen in red sauce, fish in chilli thai sauce and a chicken sweet corn soup for the kiddo. their menu mentions pork but that was not available.
my son reported the soup to be very good. i found it's full of chicken and corns, looked nice. coming to chicken satay..well, it's not satay at all. it looked like chicken pakora, and tasted like chicken pakora! chicken thai noodles was hot and spicey, liked it. chicken thai rice was ok, rice quality was not that fine. both the sides (chicken and fish) tasted same, couldn't distinguish between them. but they tasted ok. the side dishes both contained too much basil leaves, thumbs down for that.
packaging was ok, but the cardboard boxes were too fragile. delivery was quick, no complain for that. price was very reasonable. and, i must say the quantity per platter was awesome!

We ordered for food from this food joint located at Jodhpur Park for lunch at around 2 30 3 pm.  The order came in after 45-50 mins of our ordering as our ordering time coincided with the cook's lunchtime.The things we ordered for are as follows-

STARTERS- Smoked fish, Devil's Chicken

MAIN DISH- Schzewan Hakka Noodle

SIDE DISH- Green and Red Pepper Chicken, Barbeque Fish.

We loved the Starters and the hakka noodles and also the Chicken side dish but didn't like the taste of the BBQ fish. Overall our experience was quite good :-)

Everytime i visit my uncles in Jodhpur park,we have to order food from the taste maker.I adore this small place.Though i havent ever dined inside the restaurant,but i can say the staff (who delivers us in the car) is a very good guy.

The food: I have tasted a lot of dishes to actually pick out my favourite,but i guess il do with the green curry,it is very good,so is the chilli paneer and chilli chicken!The cantonese chow here is amazing,i have to order one of these always.There is also this gravy that we order,with a good amount of veggies like mushrooms,peppers,onions,broccoli, in a white gravy.(i apologise for being forgetful) but it is veryyy good.

Come  my cousins birthday n i shall order from here again :D

Visited  The  Taste Maker on  a  January  afternoon  ,  with  a  friend .  Located   quite  conveniently near  the  EDF  grounds   at  Jodhpur    Park  ,  it   took  us  a  few  minutes  of  asking  around   and  GPS  directions  to  reach  this   small   but   renowned eatery of  South Kolkata. After  reading   rave   reviews in  Zomato,  we  were quite  interested to  try  some   dishes    out  there... The   Oyster   Chicken and  Barbecue Pork   seemed  to   grab   my  friend's attention from  the  vast  number of  dishes mentioned  in  the  menu  here,  online.
On  entering  we   were   seated   in  the   table  located  near   the kitchen.  This  is  mainly a take away  joint   ,  so  am   skipping  the  ambiance part ,  but  the  weird  smell  coming   from  the  gutter  nearby   didn't  help  ,  and we  were  a bit  sceptical  about   the   hygiene level   maintained  in  the  kitchen.. We  did   away   with  the  starters  and   just   placed  our   orders for  the  mains swiftly -- Chicken   Noodles  ,   Chicken  Oyster  and  Barbecue  Pork !
The  food  arrived  after  a  while. The  noodles   tasted  alright  ,  and  the  chicken  in   oyster  sauce  was   okayish  too!  But   we  could  not   get  enough  of   the  Barbecue  pork !   Juicy  and   delicious it  was  easily  the  best  of  the   three   and moreover  served  in   quite  good   quantity ! If  not    for  anything  else  I  am  definitely   going  to  revisit   the  restaurant for   the   mouth   -watering  pork! Don't  miss  it  guys! :)

We have been patronizing the place since it started. The food was decent, the service prompt and staff courteous. There was even a novelty angle to the menu and prices just right. Order quantities were never questioned.  Based on earlier experiences, I would have given the place 4 rating with a caveat of  streamlining the kitchen hygiene. However, these are history now. Just a while ago I called to order a delivery. It was only a couple of portions of cantonese noodles . We have the flu and thought that this would be just the correct comfort food. The person on the line was ok in the beginning but his tone & manner changed as soon as he heard the order. He was loud, rude and offensive in attitude. You can always deny service beyond a minimum amount and stick to it. No offence taken. But you cannot be rude if you find that the order is not sizable enough for your liking and agreed to deliver. Needless to mention, I cancelled the order and severed a ling relationship immediately. The choices we have are numerous today. If you don't improve customer service, hygiene and communication, I can't patronize you any longer for I pay for your services. Be aware.

I have ordered takeaway from here a few times and always found the food to be decent. However I find the hygiene of the place a bit iffy and for this reason alone I don't visit more often. However the few times I have eaten at The Taste Maker i found their Chilly Chicken Dry , Chicken Gold Coin , Roasted Chilly Pork to be quite good. For the mains I have ordered either the Chicken Hakka Noodles or Chicken Fried Rice with either Chilly Chicken or Pepper Lemon Chilly Chicken both of which were not bad. Just wish they would clean up a bit since both price and portion size-wise they are pretty good.

You guys suck at most of the items you have on your menu,especially the most inviting ones.I ordered some chilli pork and you  guys made something just out of the fat of some  animal. It was disgusting to look at...disgusting to taste. I couldn't even serve it to my guest. What's all this about? You guys think it's ok to just do away with an order? This is pure unprofessional shit.

I have had food from here few times before but always at some friends place at Jodhpur Park and always liked it. Recently I had some work near Jodhpur Park, so I decided to try it out again. 

The Tastemaker is basically a take away joint with a couple of tables placed for 7-8 people to dine in. It is a very small place located right beside Seed Beans Aroma at the heart of Jodhpur Park. They also home deliver

Food: This joint specializes in Chinese food. I have only tried the starters out here. Upon their suggestion, I tried the smoked chicken, pepper chicken and hakka chili chicken. All the items are pretty good, but my personal favourite is the smoked chicken. It is not very spicy but has a very different taste and is a fantastic combination if paired up with drinks :D 
All the items are very reasonably priced and each plate consists of 8 decently sized pieces. 

Service: The delivery boys are polite and courteous. On the first day, I had to wait for more than 50 minutes outside the restaurant which really put me off, but the taste made up for it. On the second occasion, I got my order within 15 minutes :) . 

Conclusion : If you stay near Jodhpur Park then you can order and ask for home delivery. The chinese items are pretty good to taste and worth the price. I will be back for more :D 
Cost for two is around Rs 400-Rs500

I accidentally saw this restaurant few weeks back and it was then and there that I decided to try it out. I went there after some days and I became a fan of this eatery. The preparations are mouth watering and the quantity is huge. One plate of fried/schezwan rice is enough for two. Chicken chilli thai style has become my favorite but I equally like chinese chilli chicken. They use fresh items and the aroma of the food makes anyone all the way more hungry. The prices are pocket friendly. Though the place looks shabby but the quality of the food is really good. I have tried different delicacies from both thai and chinese and I must say the more I eat here the more it makes me feel like trying other items as early as possible. It is one of my favorite restaurant now since it is near my house and I really like their food. But it too has some negative points like they have very few seats, you can see big rats moving around, a dog sleeping around which they have pet. Overall the ambiance is not good at all. Yet I like their food and it will be best if you have the food as take away.

They have undergone a huge makeover. It used to have just two tables with poor sitting arrangements, now it's almost comparable to that of Chowman! Cards are also accepted now :)
The menu has been changed too. Prices raised and quality and quantity raised too!
Notable items on the menu that we tried are :

Roasted Chilli Pork- they have simply aced it. No extra spice, proper amounts of fat and slight garnish. And real tender pork slices !

Devil's Chicken- tangy , somewhat crispy sliced large pieces of chicken tossed in sauces. Good preparation..

Fried and PanFried Momos- I wish the pork momo was available all the time, but you mostly end up with Chicken momos. They come 6 in a plate and are quite filling.

Manchow soup - I didn't expect this one to be good but there it was :)

Overall very happy with this makeover.

You generally pack food from The Taste Maker because it is mostly a home delivery and takeaway joint. However, thanks to a friend's home being quite close by, I have been able to sample a few of their delights. Apart from the quality, the quantity of food they send in is also to be noted -a very healthy portion size. I am generally not a fish person, but they make a superb smoked fish which is indeed very tasty. They also make a fairly decent red curry and excellent Szechuan noodles. Their special hakka noodles is also worth mentioning. In sides, I am partial to the Hunan chicken and red chilli garlic rice, and they also make something called the pepper lemon chili fish which is very tasty. Overall, I am quite happy to have this place nearby when I  need takeout.

Four is a bit too high for this place. They have expanded the menu and added several thai dishes, however most of the stuff you really want to have are not available. We go or order in regularly for snacks. This place makes great soups and starters. I love their lung fung soup (could be a little less sweet though). Among the starters, Devil's chicken, chicken satay (once again a bit too sweet), pepper fish, chilly pork and prawn balls are old favourites. They have also delivered excellent momos on some occasions, though the momo quality is quite inconsistent and sucks on some days. 
The thai dishes in the main course taste anything but thai. The chinese dishes fare marginally better. Everything is loaded with cornflour and has the same gooey consistency. The portions however are huge. One pork dish will have enough pork for at least 3 people. They make a good fried rice though. 
Don't go there for the ambiance, the place is dingy with a few plastic chairs and lined by dilapidated buildings and open drains. You can even spot a cat sized rat or two if you pay attention.
We can't however stop eating at taste maker because they are in the neighborhood and just great for an evening snack. The home delivery service is also really fast. Not worth a 4 in the ratings though, maybe just a 3, only for the soups and starters.

For an economic option this is as good as it gets.Whenever my mom and me have a hankering for Chinese we order food from here.I have heard many people say that it is not comfortable enough with only 2 tables but it is a home delivery and takeaway counter.Although a few more seats and upgrade would do good,it is not necessary.I always get it delivered to my house  and never have I been disappointed once.My favourite combination is the shanghai chicken with chicken hakka noodles.I wont recommend the thai or lemon chicken but otherwise it is simple bliss.I have eaten here over a 100 times and will continue to do so.

This is one of THE BEST  chinese and thai restaurants in kolkata, though it is not a proper restaurant, having 2 outdoor tables and 2 tables near their kitchen so its absolutely  "no no" for dine in but the food they serve is absolutely divine, must have for chinese and thai lovers..Quantity is huge , fish chicken prawn items contain 10 pieces of fish or meat and price is extremely pocket friendly, can be called damn cheap but without compromising with the quality which is high class and seems hygienic too, every item has its own different taste and aroma,not that every gravy is same!! since the quantity is huge it can be shared by many so it becomes more budget friendly..since dine in is not a option so have to go for home delivery or take away which i did, ordered over phone and collected at suitable time.. i ordered all thai items-special thai rice, tasty and full of lemon leaves, infact all the thai items have tinge of lemon leaf flavour, green chicken-juicy big chunks of chicken in lemony green gravy,very tasty, fish in chilly thai style, fish cubes were soft as butter, melting in mouth type. prawns in red curry which is big prawns in little spicy red gravy.. all the items were delightful..this take away joint may be little difficult to find but if one manages to find it then he will have gastronomic delights for sure..

Good feedback,great reviews fetched me here.But the very first look was a real turn off.I was really shocked and taken aback by the shabby,dirty outlook.

One can hardly sit here and enjoy a meal here.Take away is the best option..

So without wasting time and leaving aside all the negativity I orderd for Smoked fish,Thai mixed rice and lemon nd chilly chicken.

Had to wait a long and finally the food arrived.Back home my mom and I wre really delighted by the food.Each of the preparation was good.Mom really loved the fish.I was highly satisfied with the rice.After a long time quite a mouth watering chinese food.

Both in matter of quantity taste,Taste Maker rocks!!!

Dont know how much hygeine they maintain though.A 3.5 for me only for the food .Next time iff its Chinese it will Taste Maker for sure!!

P.S:The rate cards given in Zomato is old one it seems.They have revised the prices.Still its worth it.

Discovered the place only last month and have been wondering ever since that why could we not have found it earlier.It is one of the best budget chinese joints in the southern part of Calcutta, in my honest opinion.
We were looking for a budget chinese option for takeaway on the occasion of rakhi, and chanced upon this place while browsing through Zomato. Seeing the reviews we decided to try it out once, and were pleasantly surprised.
on the first occasion we had ordered manchow soup,SpecialThai rice,chilli garlic rice, barbeque chicken, lemon pepper hundred chilli chicken and mandarin chicken.The quantity of a plate ofrice was enough for two, while the chicken dishes had 8 pieces of boneless chicken for Rs.110/-!!!! the taste and quality of each dish was equally good, and is simply amazing when you think of the price.I was blown over by the soup.it was light, flavourful, and full of generous amounts of chicken,shrimp, eggs, mushroom and babycorn,all for Rs.70/. The 100 chilli chicken was really really spicy, not for the fainthearted, but i loved it.

On the second occasion we ordered special soup, burnt garlic  fried rice, hot garlic chicken and hunan chicken. Again i was amazed by the taste  and the quality. The rice was great( at par with fried rice at hatari, in quality and quantity), hot garlic chicken was good,no surprises there. Hunan chicken is mildly flavoured and spiced,ideal for small kids who should not be having hot dishes, or those who like it really light. The soup was again an absolute delight in the rainy evening.

They have an extensive menu,and i mean to try them out all soon.
Oh, and forgot to mention that they have free home delivery across the city for orders above Rs. 500/-. What else does one want!
Move aside grub club, it is taste makers for me for a while,especially when my wallet feels really light.

This place is near to the south city mall....So, if you are tired after shopping & hopping and would like to have a good Chinese food, the taste maker is a good option... 

Both veg and non veg delicacies are yummy and Chef knows the meaning of medium spicy! It is value for money only if you can avoid the hygiene factor.... The servers are decent... 

You can sit there and eat, however, the place is more suitable for take away with minimum sitting arrangement... As mentioned here, they do offer home delivery....

I've chosen to give 4.0 bcoz the taste is unbeatable.... (not concerned about the hygiene factor)

WOW!!! Never expected such awesome Thai food at such a price. The location is fantastic... just a minute walk from EEDF hospital. The place is a bit shabby, with very little sitting arrangements. Although takeaway or going for a home delivery is the best option, it won't hurt if you just sit here, ignore the decor, and enjoy the food.

This was my first experience with Taste Maker, and they just bowled me over. Ordered 1 Mixed Thai rice, 1 Chili Thai Style Chicken, and 1 Smoked Fish. The fish was yum... succulent and rich in flavor. The rice was just what I expected.. nothing fancy, cooked in simple Thai style. Same goes for the chicken. In all, a very memorable experience.

Have heard that their Chinese dishes are equally good. So, that's my target next time!

TASTY TREATS FROM THE TASTE MAKER!
3 out of 5

The Taste Maker definitely knows how to make tasty Chinese delicacies. The food is not only cheap but tastes excellent as well. A word of caution though, the fare is mostly tilted towards the spicier side; therefore it might be too hot and unpalatable for some. In other words, the food is cooked in the typical Indian Chinese style. The place is best for takeaways as the environment is not suited for a private or family dining experience, yet they do provide very limited sitting options for those who wish to dine there. Besides the good food, the serving time is also quick and fast; the servers are not only attentive but prompt as well.

Coming to their food - it is mouthwatering, fresh and fast Chinese fare. To begin with, their soups are simply faultless. The soups, whether it is hot and sour soup, sweet corn soup or clear soup, are all light and well seasoned soup items. But soups like hot and sour soup and manchow soup can be very spicy for those who like them mildly spiced. 

Among their extensive fried rice dishes, items like chilli garlic fried rice, Sichuan fried rice and Hong Kong fried rice are not only excellent options but go well with almost all their veg and non veg side dishes. Even their noodle staples are soft and light textured.  Among their mouthwatering starter options, it is their chicken appetizers that shine out. Dishes like pepper chicken, chicken gold coin, chicken momos and drums of heaven are must haves from this restaurant. Along with regular Chinese staples, they also serve some innovative Chinese delicacies like Taipei prawn or fish or chicken, bamboo shoot cooked with chicken, pineapple chicken (an interesting taste!) or fish. Their preparations are always on the lighter side and you don't feel heavy after eating their food. Worth a shot!

I have ordered countless times from this small restaurant. There is no flashy element here and the food is honest. Its Indian Chinese, a bit too spicy to suit the taste of Calcuttans. Take aways are preferable cos the area is shabby and unkempt. The food is cheap, the serving is excellent, the choice of dishes is amazing. The home delivery is late. BTW, they serve pork as well and its the yummiest you get in this part of the town.

The food is just ok --- but the person at the counter--- (co owner) is so rude and so I will not advise young girls to go there.
