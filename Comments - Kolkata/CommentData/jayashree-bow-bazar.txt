Jayshree is close to Bow Bazar Crossing. This store is little down compared to its nearby rivals. Still this store serves good sweets at a low price. They have a collection of almost all the Bengali sweets and the prices range from Rs.5-15

Another Sweets store in Bowbazar area. Well this one is like the many ordinary roadside sweet shops. I went here a couple of times and their quality is ordinary. I have tried the one wrapped in Aam Satto, a few sandesh and their Samosa and Veg Chop. The Samosa was average but the chop was too poor. The sweets were average. They keep all those variety which a sweet store in Kolkata have in stock, but there is nothing exceptional to recommend this store.
There are many other stores just opposite to Jayashree which serves same quality at much lower price.

I had their kheer chop which was nowhere near as good as the ones made by the Bhim Chandra Nag outlet. The sweet-tasting chop didn't even feel like it had kheer in it, and was also pretty unsatisfactory when it came to the sweet tingly essence of a nice, smooth kheer chop. It felt like any other regular ordinary sweet item. I won't hail this shop as producing very high quality sweets.

This sweet shop is spacious. Love the Samosas , Ledigini , Cake Sandesh and the Hing Kachoris. Staff are a bit arrogant god knows why. Overall a good experience.

Intro : Bowbazaar is famous for its sweets and Bengali Singara (Samosa) , kochuri and rosgolla, so I decided to hop and try and my first stop Jayashree 
It's a very old sweet shop ,decor nothing 

Food : Had singara - Ooh they were superb, ghee was definitely used for frying, the stuffing was yummy with smashed potato mixed with peanuts and deep fried  

Overall 3.5/5

First of all i don't understand why this place has the address of Chandi Chowk where as this place is just near Bowbazar Crossing. My former office was at this place. And i use to have lots of sweets. I have visited this place several time for their jalebis as well as their Misti Doe. Place is not that Happening, neither very clean. A very ordinary sweet shop with variety of Sweets available. Staff keep asking for changes and forces you to take the amount of thing they prefer because they can't provide you change. grrrrrrrr

Every saturday we visit the temple and my dad loves to buy the sweets from here. They have a good variety of sweets. The sandesh is also quite good. I love their phul gopi singhara and luchi sabzi which they serve during noon. Its tasty and pretty good. Service is quick and fast. There is no seating area as such just two benches for the people who would prefer to sit and eat.
