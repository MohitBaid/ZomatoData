Tucked away in one of the bylanes of Ballygunge, is this cafe with a truly beautiful soul.. the positive vibes of this place are apparent the minute you step in. As it says on the Hope Foundation Kolkata website... "The Hope Kolkata Foundation strives – with the help of partner organization – to create a just and equitable society where people can live a quality life with dignity". Their Cafe, ably managed by the vivacious and chic Renu Singh (who is the Life Skills Manager), serves some really good food, at prices that are from an era gone by (plate of Chili Chicken for Rs. 100). I must add, the low prices in no way lead to a compromise in the food quality. We tried the Mughlai Paratha with Raita, Poori Aludam, Chicken Pakora and Chili Chicken with Paratha (you read right).. Desert was Carrot Cake and Gulab Jamun, we washed all this down with Nimbu Paani, Lassi and Coffee.. The Chili Chicken may need a bit of fine tuning,  but every thing else was bang on. The Kitchen is efficiently manned by Ganga Das, Imran Khan and Anita Doloi, and the amiable Noor and Rakhi serve you with a smile. This place is a must visit.

Located in the alley beside city style of triangular park. This cafe is actually part of an NGO -' Hope foundation'. The staff are basically the civilians of hope foundation . they were cordial and nice. Ambience is apt for long conversations . The place is nicely decorated with handmade things . Coming to the food part , ordered chocolate mud pie , mixed Hakka noodles, ginger garlic chicken.
1. Mixed Hakka noodles- quantity was good. Taste wise average. Nothing exceptional.
2. Ginger garlic chicken - gravy was very thin. Chicken pieces were good. Tasted decent.
3.chocolate mud pie- it was the best dish of that day. Highly recommended .it was warm and moist . it had good amount of nuts in it . a must try dish for those who have a sweet tooth 
P.s - they also have outdoor sitting arrangements. Kudos to 'Hope foundation' for carrying their noble work. Highly appreciated.

Had been here for lunch this afternoon. A bit difficult to locate.
Amazing atmosphere. 
We were hungry and ordered Chicken Pakora, Mixed Hakka Noodles, Mixed Fried Rice and Chilli Garlic chicken.
The Chicken Pakora was very tasty.
Mixed Hakka Noodles was ok. 
Mixed Fried Rice was a bit on the dry side. 
The Chilli Garlic was soupy and white and was ok in taste. We ordered Pepsi too. 

But the winner was the MUD PIE cake and I recommend it to all of you! Do taste their Mud Pie Cake. 

The best things about this place were its ambience, the price and the dessert. 
The worst thing about the place is its location and quantity. :( 

But with lots of HOPE, I will go back to the place again. ❤️

Kudos to the foundation!!

Providing adequate empowerment through training and employment, this cafe is not only sets its own league, but also competently serves amazing food at pretty reasonable pocket friendly prices.

1. Chicken pakora - 4.5⭐️
[Plenty of meat, well cooked and tender]

2. Carrot cake - 5⭐️
[Almost like the one you Mum's gonna bake for you]

3. Chocolate cake - 5⭐️
[The base was super soft, and definitely a treat for the chocolate lover, plenty of it]

It has both outdoor and indoor seating facilities. The only drawback, it closes by 6pm. 

A solid 5⭐️ and ❤️, tonnes of wishes to the ever sweet and smiling team of Hope.

Simplicity is the key point of success and perfection make that way easier... Hope cafe is something like that..Near gariahut triangular park,through the opposite lane of the park, approx 5-8 mnts straight ...simple direction as the cafe.. A foundation oriented cafe , touches your heart with their service, catches your eyes by their decor and cleanness..and obviously satisfy your stomach by their food.. And the smiles on their faces make your time happy..
We satisfied us with chicken hukka noodles, chicken fried rice & garlic chicken .. Taste was really good and quantity is proper for one.. Price is really pocket friendly...
Guys just go and enjoy the food and the atmosphere.. Hope you will love it..

It's a simple yet beautiful cafe hidden in the lane beside City style in Gariahat area. Visitied here today for the very first time for lunch and our experience is really good. Unlike others cafe it's a cafe associated with Hope foundation and it's menu includes Continental, North Indian, Chinese as well as Bengali cuisine. Ambiance is very homely and simple. We ordered,
*Chicken Hakka Noodles
*Chicken Fried Rice
*Chilly Garlic Chicken
Foods are served within 10 to 15 minutes. The lady staffs are really very polite and well mannered. Coming to the foods the Chicken Fried Rice tasted too good and it's the best rice I have tasted till the date. Chicken Hakka Noodles have a perfect burnt flavour. Both the items were served with ample of diced Chicken. Comparatively the side dish Chilly garlic Chicken tasted quite blunt and it was not well going with the staples. The prices are very much affordable and they didn't charge any extra tax on the bill. It costed only 235 Rs For feeding two of us. The quantity served was sufficient for feeding one person. We came out from the cafe with a big smile in our face because we both were amazed by the simplicity of this cafe. Definitely recommended.

Its a small cafe, and the cheapest i have been in
No tax, so whatever the price is written,its that exactly
The items to select from are not a lot but if you have a small budget and want to get your stomach full, this is the place
As i didn't want to eat chowmein or anything,just bought sandwiches
It was tasty.

Found out this place from a friend. It was very easy to find, just you need to walk straight through the road adjacent to city style. A small quaint little cafe with maybe sitting arrangement for about maybe 25 people. The staffs are extremely curteous.
We orderd mixed noodles gravy, dry chilli chicken, triple deckered club sandwitch, chocolate cake and a fresh lime soda. All the food were really good but one thing they need to improve is the serving time. We had to wait really long to get our food served. The owner was really polite. She came up to every table and asked about the food we were having. The docor was not too much but just perfect to have a good time. Little notes from customers adorned the wall. I just loved the sandwitch. It was so cheesy and tasty. Would visit again to try out other foods as well.

I don't think many people know about this extremely cute cafe situated at a stone throw distance from the Hope foundation of Kolkata. It is on Panditya Road, so what you do is get down at Triangular Park City Style and walk down straight the road adjacent to it. The ambience very creative with wall adorned with little notes with messages. The seating arrangement is comfortable. The staff is very courteous.  You get a serene and peaceful feeling here. We ordered a plate of french feies, a plate of chilly chicken, a plate of chicken chowmein, vegetable grilled sandwiches , a chocolate cake which was a special offer today, and a vanilla ice cream. Unlike other cafes, this place is very very cheap with delicious food. The sandwiches were splendid. The cake won our heart. The chowmein was ample in quantity considering its price. I am so in love with this place. Definitely a must visit cafe. The price is inclusive of taxes and service was quick too.

The lady staffs are extemely courteous and service is swift.
Ordered a Scrambled Egg with Cheese, a Chicken Grilled Sandwich and a Veg Penne in White Sauce.
I liked the scrambled egg and the sandwich a lot.
The pasta wasn't good enough. It was dry and the seasoning was in excess which often tasted bitter.
But would like to give a visit again!

It's a cafe run by an ngo.  We ordered food from there.  In about 20mins the food was delivered.  The food is pocket friendly and quality is very good compared to the price of the food.  Small cozy place.  Good place for snacks and home delivery is equally good.  Pasta to thali,  everything is available.

Its a lovely place.  I'm coming to the food served a bit later.  First i would like to tell u guys about the reception my friend and i got when we went there.  As soon as we entered, a young man,  approximately my age came and greeted us.  As we sat down,  they gave us the menu cards and we took quite sometime to decide.  Whenever they came,  they wore a welcoming smile.  We ordered coffee .   the coffee was quite good and it matched with the ambience quite well .  it was raining cats and dogs outside so coffee was a must.  Next,  we ordered soup.  The soup was quite generous but i have had better.  Then came the triple decker sandwitch.  It was the best thing by a mile.  The sandwitch was quite generously stacked.  I was so overwhelmed with how it tasted,  i had to order another plate.  Next came in the mixed hakka chowmein.  It was not that savoury.  But what came next really disappointed me.  It was the garlic chicken. If i were being brutally honest,  i would say that it was awful .  the gravy lacked texture and was all cloggy .  the chicken was good on the inside but the gravy made it almost uneatable. At last, we ordered the chocolate brownie,  which was on their special menu for that day.  It was lip smacking.  I could eat that all day long .  i did order two for myself.  Finally,  the bill came and we were shocked .  it was just 435 for all this food.  Overall,   i would ask you to try their sandwitches  and their desserts .  you wont be disappointed.  I would go back there again , if not for their sandwitches, definitely for their desserts.  I was a happy man when i left with my stomach filled and my pockets still quite heavy.  What more could i have asked? 😃

This review was long due. I'm a regular at this quaint little pretty cafe which is very near my college. I've tried a lot of their dishes and I'll highly recommend this place to anyone who'll like to visit. It's feel-good place with very pocket friendly and yummy food. Try their cold coffee, fresh lime soda, chocolate cake, chicken sandwich, chicken arabiatta penne( my favourite here) and you won't be disappointed. Other dishes are great too.
The lady who runs the place is very welcoming and amiable. She is one of the reasons why you'll feel like coming back here again and again. The servers are all trainees who are being skill- trained by Hope Foundation for a secure future. Visit someday and you won't be disappointed.

One more really good reason for me to miss South Calcutta. Hope Cafe is such a wonderful and warm place. Totally opens your heart. The paintings on the walls, artifacts, books and lovely food (today's order included chocolate cake and pav bhaji)..... Must visit in the morning and take a chair facing the window - just to feel the morning sunlight streaming in right on to my face while i read a book and wait for my order to arrive. Food for my soul for sure.

It's an amazing place to dine!

Ambience - fantastic
Service - quick
Food - brilliant

You walk-in to find a cafe - whose decor has a personalised touch. Yes! it has a wish tree, and is decorated with art pieces painted either by the Irish Volunteers or the children at their protection home.

They have a lovely Manager - who is always bubbling with energy for her guests.

We ordered veg quiche, carrot cake, masala toast, masala omlette. The food tastes amazing and is pocket friendly too!

Two of us wandered in after 5.30pm, oblivious of the closing time...Even though the staff were ready to head home, we were asked to stay while they got the kitchen going again...shortly we were digging into delicious grilled cheese sandwiches and coffee by the lady who we learnt lived in Central Avenue (very far away). Although  we finished well after 6pm, not once were we hurried to finish up and leave - then she even helped us find a taxi to go home regardless of the fact that SHE was getting very late herself...!! Shall certainly visit again and at a proper time! 😃

This is a small cafe run by the foundation, which works among the local underprivileged children.
The location is a tad bit difficult to find, so I'm attaching a screenshot of the map for your reference. Basically take a left from City Style Mall, go straight, crossing Buddha Bites, until you reach a dead end, the cafe is on the left.
The air conditioned place is small, cozy seating for around 18-20 people people is available.
Also there are two tables outside the cafe, if you prefer having your food in the open.Or you want to have a smoke with your coffee.
The fact that this cafe is run by a NGO is evident as soon as you enter the place. With paper & craftworks by small children adorning the walls. They have a wishing tree where you can leave a message on a post it note.
Coming to the menu, the offerings are varied, the number of items are quite a handful. The prices are quite pocketfriendly, if not ridiculously low. However do note that the portions are suitable for a single adult only, so do order accordingly.
We ordered Chicken Pasta in white sauce, mixed fried rice, garlic chicken in food & Mud pie for dessert (which was on the specials menu that day). Do look out for the day's combo, which are all the more economical.
The Pasta was adequate in quantity. Well cooked with generously sized chunks of chicken & mushrooms. I however found out that if you opt for a takeaway they pack in much more of pasta in the aluminium takeaway boxes. Nearly 25% extra over their normal servings along with blocks of cheese. Trust me the pasta is finger licking good.
The Chicken Fried rice was not as good. It was a bit a bit on the dry side. A bit over cooked I am guessing. But still for only 65 rs the taste was worth the price.
The Garlic Chicken was a disappointment, the sauce seemed to be generic. The four pieces of chicken seemed very reluctant to imbibe the flavor of the sauce.
The mud pie was fine. However presentation could be a bit better.
Overall, to me the pasta seemed great, the Indian dishes were not upto the mark. Next time I visit I will remember to order the other continental offerings.
The best part was ofcourse, after having the food i was really surprized at the bill amount. it was just around 285rs. They don't charge any extra taxes as you would be paying the money as a donation.
Also the server declined to accept tips. She showed me a donation box instead.
The experience was fine.
Pay a visit for one of the most pocket friendly pasta in town.

Note: They rent out the place for small birthday parties/ gatherings for a nominal charge. Remember to ask the lady at the bill desk who is very courteous & soft spoken.
Ciao,
Deep

Hope cafe is basically a cool eatery. But the location can be a bit confusing for first time goers. Coming to food, we ordered chicken penne pasta in white sauce, grilled chicken sandwich, mixed gravy chowmein, chicken hakka chowmein. Penne pasta was tasty and healthy as it consisted a lot of veggies, but again they gave a minimal amount of white sauce in it. Whereas the sandwich was best among the lot, real tasty! Gravy chowmein was disgusting as it didn't have a particular taste! But all over portions were good! Indeed a pocket friendly cafe!

Not very attractive like the rest of the places but one should definitely be here for the amazing food and staff. Cheap price and real tasty and healthy food. Very sober and clean ambience and lovely staff who always wear that genuine smile on their faces. My friend and me ordered for the chicken thali and veg fried rice and dry chilly chicken. And we had the fresh chocolate cake for the desert purpose. Total yumm and worth the first visit. Many more visits to come from my side atleast.
