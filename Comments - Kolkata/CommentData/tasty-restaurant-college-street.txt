If there is no other option in the world then you can go to this place. The name is tasty but food here is neither tasty nor fresh. I will never recommend my friends to go there. It's just near coffee house. Forget to visit this place. It's untidy as well.

Tasty Restaurant is located just beside Coffee House. The place is mostly popular for students. Prices are okay but quality is poor. I visited here twice and had their Chowmine once and once Rice with Chicken side dish. Both the time the food wasn't food.

The food out here should be your last option to eat out when here in college street. If you are hungry and no option to visit only then. I had noodles out here. On the higher side of oil quotient. So please be aware.

Visited this restaurant few days back. Ordered chicken chowmein and garlic chicken. The service was too slow. They took around 20 minutes to serve. Chicken chunks were on the top of the chowmein. But the taste was unexpectedly good. The chicken was also good. And the price is in the lower side. And as in the college street area, there is a few eateries, if you are here you can give it a try.

I used to go this place very often when I was in my college Presidency. It is just 2minutes from coffee house. The place is ok. Food was good and pocket friendly also. I visited the place today and ordered mix chow , chilli chicken and chicken cutlet. Cutlet was ver good as usual. Chow and chilli chicken was ok. Overall it is a nice place to eat if u in college street.

I used to visit this place often when I was in my 1st year of Under Graduate, this place is very close to my college Presidency and we used to hangout there in groups, at least once in a week.
This place is popular for its Chowmine. 90â„… people come here for Chowmine, so did we used to. Tasty used to serve us really tasty Chowmine, but recently the quality has gone bit down, which I noticed when I visited there about a month ago.
Still this place is a good one in College street area and if you are a college student studying in College street area you must visit it.

One of my favorite restaurant of college days. Buying books at college street and having a nice lite bite at tasty is one of our favorite job. Chowmin, paratha etc are the famous dish of this restaurant.
