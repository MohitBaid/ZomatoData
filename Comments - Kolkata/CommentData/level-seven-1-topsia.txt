There are many things that go into making a good eatery/pub.. location, food, drinks, service etc. Well LEVEL SEVEN has at least got the location right. It’s located on Topsia road, a stone’s throw away from Science City, China Town, and very easily accessible from other parts of Kolkata as well. It has two and a quarter levels, comprising of the 7th floor of the building its housed in, the roof top and a smaller roof atop the roof. You can have awesome sunset sights from here.
Taking about the food : We had the pleasure of sampling quite a few dishes, and they were all pretty good. We had TUSCANA PIZZA, TANDOORI TIKKA TRILOGY, CHICKEN SIRACHA, CHEESY MUSHROOM KULCHA, KHIDCHI ARANCHINI, SEA BASS and GOAT CHEESE WALNUT TIKKI.  The ingredients were good, the meats were well seasoned, the cheese was tasty and had good texture, the breaded item (KHICHDI ARANCHINI, WALNUT TIKKI) had a nice and thin coat of crumbs, the Siracha was tasty too. My favourites would be the TUSCANA PIZZA, SEA BASS especially for the lemon butter sauce, and the GOAT CHEESE WALNUT TIKKI. The presentation was also pretty chic. 
Coming to the not so good parts and these were really not very good. The cocktails namely, ORANGE MARTINI, COSMOPOLITAN, and SEX ON THE BEACH failed to impress. They felt very sugary, apart from the SOTB, lacked any taste of the hero ingredients. The PISCO SOUR was the better one of the lot. 
All this aside, the fact that annoyed me the most; this was my first visit, and I guess I or any other person is not supposed to readily identify who is who right away. When I asked a guy to get the table cleared, he pointed me towards another guy and told me that I should ask him instead, that’s a real thumbs down for service.
Summing up, the location is awesome, the drinks are not good, the food is tasty albeit pricey, and the service needs attention. 
Rating  1.5/5.

So, the first sunday of my year 2018 was spent at this new place 'level seven'. It was highly recommended by a couple of friends and is owned by a mutual connection. So I went there with a lot of high hopes but to my disappointment all of them were shattered. The place was quite dead and cold. The music was minimal, some people like minimal and I'm not one of them. Hookah tasted weird. I ordered for sangria and got orange peels dipped in red wine (sangria means infused fruits, it needs to be kept like that for hours so that the flavor changes.) Anyways, talking about the food, burger was served without fries. How can a restaurant be out of fries? The only thing I liked was the ambience of the place because it's on rooftop and it had a good view of the maa flyover. But frankly speaking it's a waste of such an amazing location. You could have done wonders with the place. Poor service, bad food, bad music, good location. Oh! I forgot to mention, it's overpriced for the experience and services I got!!

I went with my elder sister and a friend . Worst experience I have ever had . My sister had to wave her hands for several times every time we ordered drinks or food . Before hiring those employees even they should have checked it properly . So careless . Opening an outlet is easy but running it ? Haha . Are you kidding with guests? Very poor service.  Would never visit again . The stewards behaves like they are blind & deaf , peope will leave their seat and will run behind them , need to understand we are paying for it which is not worthy . They took half an hour to send a steward to take order .They are sending food but without cutlery , for tissue papers also we were waving our hands for 10 mins , what a joke . My sister belongs to the same industry so for her sake we just stayed silent. .

Horrible Service.. We were there for over an hour but we didn't eat anything  as nobody was interested in taking the order. Even after we complained to the Manager, he seemed least bothered and went back to looking at his mobile. Its food rates are pretty high but the service is worse than a road side eatery.. Please avoid. We left and went to the Grid and had a blast!! Please avoid if service is important to you.

Well a fantastic experience in another rooftop in the city, though there are other quality rooftops already this is on another level. A complete new area, topsia, a sight of maa flyover, moving chair for seating, nice lighting, sprinkles of water myst and last but not the least the food, its too awesome. We tried both continental, fushion, indian and all cuisines are so yummy and tasty.

Whisky sour was pure orange Juice, a pan size small pizza for 475/- really??

First I'll start by saying how beautiful the place is.. Right beside the Maa Flyover in Topsia, this place has a rooftop seating arrangement at two levels and another lounge area downstairs. We chose to be at the rooftop bar and lounge. It was a perfectly and beautifully decorated place with a panoramic view of the surrounding area. It looks even more amazing at night with the city lights on. So if you're looking for a place with a view and good food and drinks, this place won't disappoint you at all.
Coming to the good food part
For starters we  had:
Amritsari fish finger - it had more spices and the dip tasted great
Murgh makhani tart - the best I've had here. It was a fusion dish.. Small balls of spiced chicken served on a tart base. The tart was soft and buttery and the whole thing would melt in your mouth 
Italian chicken seekh - this was the common seekh kebab with more spices sprinkled 
For drinks we took Tutta hua Tara and Gin Fizz in cocktails and Sea Sunset and Virgin mojito in mocktails
For the mains we had,
Seared sea bass served with coriander rice and mustard coconut sauce
Smoked chicken and jalapeños kulcha served with dal makhani - again an amazing dish which tasted heavenly and was finished within moments
Cornfed char siu chicken - this plate consisted of 4 chicken pieces with sautéed veggies, cooked very well with a dash of rosemary
For the dessert,
Blueberry cheesecake - came in an ample portion in a large round bowl
Rise caramel custard - it had dried rose petals sprinkled on it which gave an altogether different flavour to the dessert

I must say ambience wise "Level Seven" is the best property in the Topsia area... The view of the Parama Flyover and the City from the roof top lounge area is just stunning... And as the sun sets the winter evening becomes so so romantic... Perfect place for dates with your love ones... Or to spend some quality time with yourself alone... Enjoy the music, grab some beer, cocktails or hookah and feel the breeze... Nothing can satisfy you more... Their food and drinks are very good... Presentation of each and every dishes are just bang on...
We went there with a group of friends and tried some amazing dishes and drinks...
~Starters~
"Amritsari fish finger", "Italian chicken seekh", "Murg makhani tart", "Charred oriental prawns"... All being too yummy... But the tart and the prawns need a special mention... They are just superb... Starting from the presentation to the taste... It was amazing... Highly recommended dishes...

~Main Course~
"Seared sea bass coriander ride & mustard coconut sauce", "Tawa salmon masala", "Cornfed char siu chicken", "Smoked chicken jalapeños kulcha"... All were just delicious and yummy... Each and every dishes are highly recommend...

~Dessert~
"Holy coconut rise caramel custard", "Shahi malai millie fuille tukda" and "Blueberry cheese cake"... Of which the Sahi tukra has a unique twist and tasted excellent too... Give it a try...

~Cocktails~
"ANDA ke fanda", "Tutta tara", "High level" & "Gin fizz"... All were good... But I like Tutta tara the most... The zing of star anise in the drink... Done the trick...

~Mocktails~
"Blue lagoon", "Pina colada", "Sea sunset" & "Virgin mohito"... All were decent... Nothing extraordinary...

They need to work on the staffs and service a bit, that's all... Othewsise nothing can stop this property to became the most happening place of the town...
Also need to mention that their hookahs are just amazing... Unique flavours... Unique presentation... Unique feelings... Try it... You will never get dishearten...

After Grid, the Topsia region gets yet another crown jewel, Level Seven. Opened on the terrace area of Wizard House, this rooftop lounge gives you splendid views of the City of Joy. With no taller buildings in the vicinity, a cool breeze and calm ambience is ensured. The place has a posh feel and the peppy music just makes your evening lively.

Some of the cocktails I tried were Anda Ka Funda, Tutta Tara, High Level and Gin Fizz. All of them were super good, no complaints at all.

For the starters we had Walnut Tikki, Masala Paneer Pate, Artichoke Flanks, Basilica Treat Pizza and Baby Mushroom Kulcha. They were decent in taste and quantity.

For desserts, I would recommend Blueberry Cheesecake and Shahi Malai Tukda.

If you're looking for a rooftop lounge with brilliant food, choices of mocktails and hookah(I don't smoke, my friends did), or a restaurant cum lounge with brilliant ambience, this is your place! They have a live dj too and also serve cocktails, beers etc. 

»Starters«
★Charred Oriental Prawns(10/10): This was brilliant! Beautiful presentation and it was charred like a pro! Delicious dip to accompany. Fresh stuff and well cooked.
★Italian Chicken Sheekh(10/10): This was no doubt a level higher than your normal sheekh kebab. The dip is unique, the kebabs sprouts a brilliant combination of ingredients on your tastebuds. 

◎Mocktails◎
♡Blue Lagoon(9/10): I loved this! A brilliant addition with your meals.

♡Sea Sunset(10/10): To all those non-drinkers out there they've got you covered. Get this one, even the ones with alcohol will be jealous after they taste this.

♡Virgin Mohito(8/10): This was pretty good too, nothing too good but goes will with starters.


◎Mains◎
✩Cornfed Char Siu Chicken(10/10): Yum Yum! This is a must try in every visit! Those saucy tender pieces of chicken were mind blowing! 
✩ Tawa Salmon Masala(9/10): Serves 2-3 people if you have other main course. Super delicious and tender fish and goes well with naan/kulcha. Palatable! 
✩ Tasted a kulcha and daal from my friend's plate, it was nice. Not into veg much, so won't rate. 

★Dessert★
●Shahi Tukra(9.5/10): No doubt an unique looking dessert at this place and not so soupy like at mughlai joints. Theirs are very creamy and double the flavor!

This place blows your mind by the looks and feel of the ambiance. The rooftop is not just like any other, liked the water sprays the moving seats and the plant cover at the roof, something refreshing to offer. 
The drinks were the main focus, well made truly refreshing.
Coming to the food loved the starters, we tried a basilica treat pizza which was super thin, haven't eaten such a thin crust yet. Also tried a masala planner pate which was filling and based out of flavours of north India.
Also tried artichoke flanks which was super crispy.

In the main courses tried anytime favourite north Indian varieties, the daal and kichad were even better then proper north Indian restaurants.

For desserts tried a caramel custard, a sahi tukda, which had fried bread peices and rabdi all over it. Though the best among the lot was blueberry cheesecake, you can't go wrong with it.

You had a long week and want to chill it out this weekend? Well here is a perfect place for you- With the ambience that is off the roof, literally! Amazing view and weather made it one of the most memorable times.

Here are a few things we tried and are worth having a shot at them!

Masala Paneer Pate- With an amazing set of kulchas and paneer bhurji, this dish tastes remarkable!

Dal Makhani and Kulcha were again Mindblowing!

Chicken Seekh was perfectly made with great taste.

Mocktails like Blue Lagoon and Pina Colada were off the charts.

Coming to cocktails, Gin Fizz is a must try!

The desserts were made perfectly but i found it be a little below the level of other dishes.

A real good experience in totality!

Kolkata can now boast of another spectacular rooftop lounge that will make you fall in love with it's wonderful ambiance, perfect playlist and good food!

This place is on the 7th floor of Wizard E Marketing building, next to Hotel Sawood International. They might charge you on special days like Christmas, New Year weekend and so on. Better call and take the details before visiting.

They serve a variety of vegetarian and non vegetarian dishes along with alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages. Though I didn't quite like the drinks and dessert, however the starters & main course items bowled me over!

Must Orders -

Italian Chicken Seekh
Charred Oriental Prawns
Baby Mushroom Kulcha
Smoked Chicken Jalapeno Kulcha
Tawa Salmon Masala

Service has rooms for improvement. Price is on the higher side.

What: It's brand new and already talk of the town.
Speciality: Level 7 is a level higher than what I expected. One of the best CHILL SPOTS in the city with a rooftop seating arrangement. 
Best time to visit: During the daybreak. You can just sit there n gaze at the sky with all your heart.
And if you're a party person then you can also dance like there's no one watching you as they've some real good collection of groovy chords.
What else? They've a bar in the 7th floor of the building. Do not skip the hidden colourful corners of this place. If you're a photoholic like me you'll spot their casual yet attractive frames, filament lamps, an American flag imprinted sofa.
Retro fashion engulfs L7 with warmth and comfort.
Yes I can keep on describing this place but I must focus on the food now.😉
ANDA KA FUNDA was the first one to play with my tastebuds.
I'm not a cocktail person so didn't enjoy much.
I loved their SEA SUNSET drink the most. The colour of the drink did half of the job. Tasted awesomely awesome.
BLUE LAGOON was refreshing and soothing and we took it on n off while having the lip smacking starters.
CHARRED ORIENTAL PRAWN is a dish that you must order when you hit up this place.
Starting from the presentation to the taste it lived upto the mark.😍
AMRITSARI FISH FINGER was awesome. Crispy and yummy!
My new found love is their SEARED SEA BASS CORIANDER RIDE. It tasted heavenly with the mustard sauce. Wished the quantity was more but the dish was LIT!!
My next favourite is their TAWA SALMON MASALA with KULCHA.
The curry was thick and the quality was nothing less than extraordinary.
Soft Salmon was sumptuous and never knew it would taste delicious all the more with the fresh kulchas.
Happiness arrived in the form of BLUEBERRY CHEESECAKE.
Dig in and get lost in its charm.❤
CARAMEL CUSTARD could have been better though.
The food was really great on a whole and so was the decor.👌

P.S. Washroom has been designed so well but I would have appreciated it more if it was clean in proper.
Please maintain the hygiene.

Level Seven, the newly opened rooftop lounge which is the new shizz of the town. The view is absolutely spectacular and the ambience is blissful. Along with delicious food and drinks, they serve really good shisha. It's perfect place to party and hang out with your buddies. The music also sets the mood right. I visited this place on Christmas Eve and had a gala time. It's a perfect place to head on to for some scrumptious food & beverages and to enjoy the horizon view of the city with some great tunes too. The service was decent and the décor was mesmerizing. Coming to our food story, we started with some mocktails - 
• Virgin Mojito 
• Pina Colada 
• Sea Sunset 
Each of them were truly refreshing and looked so fetching. Heading over to some cocktails -
• Anda ka Fanda 
• Tutta Tara
• Gin Fizz 
As stunning as the drinks looked, they were even more energizing. The drinks are simply out of the world and with that wonderful rooftop view of the city it gets even better. For starters we opted for -
• Amritsari Fish Finger 
• Italian Chicken Seekh Kebab 
• Charred Oriental Prawns 
Each of them were absolutely delectable and the sauces were great too. They are a must try! 
Moving on to main course, we ordered for -
• Seared Sea Bass with Coriander Rice & Mustard Coconut Sauce 
• Smoked Chicken Jalapenos Kulcha 
• Tawa Salmon Masala 
The fish was really soft and nearly melted in the mouth. Very well prepared and presented. 
And for desserts we opted for - Shahi Malai Tukda which was just the cherry on the top that was much needed. Apart from food we also settled for some hookah. And I must say, this place has one of the best hookah in town. Totally recommended.

It's a perfect spot to enjoy your winters and relish the beautiful panorama of the city with some really appetizing food & drinks.

This place offers the top notch view of the grand MAA flyover in one side and a lush green fields on the other. They offer a range of lipsmacking starters among them Charred Oriental Prawn and Italian chicken sheek are a must try. This place serves a variety of cocktails and mocktails among them Gin Fizz and Pinna Colada is something which you can not miss. In the delicacies of the main course seared sea bass coriander ride & mustard coconut sauce is something which will savour every inche of your tastebuds. If you are looking for some hookah to hook upon then am sure this will be your perfect destination.

One of the best places to hangout is Level 7. It’s a really cool place to chill. 
The ambience is lovely. It has attractive interiors, city view from the terrace with hookahs and drinks and amazing food. 
Fab service along with crazy music. 
Coolest place I’ve ever been in Calcutta.

Level 7 is going to be the talk of town soon.
Amazing place to chill with your near & dear ones.

The best part for hookah lovers is it stays for long.
Very good variety of food. I personally liked bread pakora & cashew nut tikki.

A must visit place. Last but not the least amazing view anyone can fall in love with.

This is one of the worst additions to Kolkata. These people are a perfect example of how can you turn a good location to trash with poor service and bad food. We went as a group of four and had minimalistic expectations from the place. However, they still managed to disappoint us. There were no wine cocktails available, only 3 types of beer, and an insistent waiter on cosmopolitan. After asking for more options, he finally revealed... Only 3-4 types of cocktails were available. Reluctant, I ordered a cosmopolitan which turned it to be sweeter than sharbat. Most of the dishes on the menu were unavailable... Be it salad, appetizer or main course. They served us one of the worst ceasar salad I ever had seasoned with mayonnaise. First time ever did I see a dip being served with salad. Clear states their misconception about food. The appetizer of paneer pate was nothing but lachha paratha and paneer bhurji. If that's what u call an appetizer then I highly doubt if they have an idea about what main course is. The basil pizza was just cheese and burnt crust. Bad food, poor maintainance and stale music is to be expected if you go there.

Visited this Newly Opened Joint serving Alcohol & Shisha on a Sunday & to my Surprise it was Dead Empty ( Might be very Hand-Full people know about it )

Ambience : Dull & Shabby 
Shisha : Very Limited flavour to choose from but was surprised that it was made perfect.
Food : Very Limited Options for Veg ppl
Taste : Average
Staff : Very courteous, well trained & helpful

Would not suggest a visit at this moment as it is very new & need time to settle
