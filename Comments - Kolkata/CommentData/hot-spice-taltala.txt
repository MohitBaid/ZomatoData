Getting good quality chicken biryani in central kolkata region is a bliss.They also serve beef biryani whose quantity is quite sufficient.But the best thing we tried is their chicken do-pyaza which was awesome. very pocket friendly,good food.

Once it was kayenat biryani but now hot spice. Yummy but the meat are not upto the mark. But according to the price it is good. Apart from biryani i would suggest their haleem during ramadan its a must try.

It's regular place for me. Just two minutes walking distance from my home. It serves Biriyani, chicken tandoori, noodles and other Chinese items. But Biryani is best. Ghol is also good. Must try.
