Recommended to those who love South Indian foods and to those who thinks that South Indians only eat Dosa and Idli.. üòÇ
Been here for the first time. Had Malabar Paratha with Malabar Chicken, Mulugatawni chicken soup, Kai Kari Pulao and Meen Kozhambu..Every dish was awesome but I felt that Malabar Paratha needs a bit more way to go. While being in Thiruvanathpuram for 2 months, I became a fan of this Paratha and Paratha of Tamarind is 90% close to those Parathas..
Small things can make you happy. A complimentary masala chaas (buttermilk) and a pan as a mouth freshener has done the trick.
Loved the way the staffs behaved and their hospitality was really amazing.
Thumbs up to this place üëçüëç

We ordered coorg chicken in starter as suggested by one of the waiters. It had five pieces in it. The chicken was tender and juicy, loved it absolutely. Then we ordered chicken lababdar and alabari paratha as main course. We wanted lachha paratha but it wasn't available so we opted for alabari. Chicken lababdar was good but I felt the paratha was a bit hard. The decor in here is very classy and the waiters were courteous. Overall a nice experience.

For an order of appam, Deccan downer (butter milk), green salad, kothu parantha & veinchina mamsam; it cost ‚Çπ1160/- so not bad as a price tag but quality & taste wise it does feel bit costlier....
The location setting & decor gave an old world & traditional feel which was kinda refreshing....

The place has a beautiful decor and ambience which makes it a very pleasing experience to have a meal here.

I visited this place on a Saturday afternoon with a friend for a lunch. We had made prior reservation and so weren't made to wait. My friend being a complete vegetarian we got to have a taste both vegetarian and non-veg delicacies.

For starters we ordered Coorg Mutton Fry and kuzhi paniyaram ! The coorg mutton fry was exquisite and one of the best starters I tasted yet! The kuzhi paniyaram was pretty good too!

For main course we ordered Andheri Chicken Pulao, Tomato rice with Chettinad Chicken and Gobi 65!
Each of the dishes were very good !
N.B.: All these dishes are sufficient for two people if you order one, we made the mistake of ordering one for each so had to make a takeaway!

For dessert we had Nolen Gurer ice cream, it was so good that we ordered an extra at the end !

Overall a great experience of having lunch here and highly recommended if you want to taste the best of south Indian non veg dishes, sitting in Calcutta !

Quite an old place and was on my wish list for long, at last got to visit it last night. In one word it's impressive - the food, the decor, the ambience, the service all are commendable. Though I am not a great fan of south indian cuisine I loved the appam with chettinad chicken & coorgi mutton fry. But my thumbs up goes to the Malabar paratha & chicken chakori kebab. I will be surely going back for these. Being a typical kolkata bong I really did not enjoy the Hyderabadi biriyani but it was also good! All in all I am quite satisfied with this place.

Food is very good though pretty spicy. But if you request them to make it less hot, they do. But what is horrible is their service. The waiters literally wait next to your table and snatch the plates as you finish eating. They even came to take my dessert bowl still left with a gulab jamun and half a scoop of ice cream, just because I was eating slowly and chatting with my partner in between. Totally ill trained waiters. Quite unprofessional on the owners to charge so much for the food and provide such sub standard ambience.

A mood swing lunch at this restaurant with curved wooden beams and intricately crafted wooden pillars, antics, and artistic relics paired with nice hospitality and warm service comforted us this afternoon. We opted for the South Indian Thali. Excepting the coriander rice and the fish snack that were a bit over salted, the food overall tasted fine. Their menu appears to be picking the best flavours from the coastal regions and South Indian plains like Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Mangalore, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh and even C00rg... Hoping to be there next time without the defects noticed in this visit.

It is at par with many top end restaurants serving South Indian non-veg food in Bangalore - and thats just food !Coastal cuisine at its best.The appam and stew, the iddiappam and crab,and so many other typical Malabar and Mangalorean dishes are to die for!¬† If you consider the ambience, the warmth of the people managing the restaurant and serving the food here (which you can never get in a chain restaurant, usually), its an wow experience !! Highly recommended for all my friends who want to sample South Indian non-veg food in Kolkata.

Quintessential south indian experience minus the staple idli dhosa s located on Sarat Bose Road. This is an well known awardee restaurant. Top to toe, south indian. The beautiful metal bowls with flowers on the tables, the mats, the entire wooden decor like a house with a little light right in south india. The complenmentary chaas like drink with the chili garnish greets you as you order.
A hyderabadi biriyani, a bakharkhani and chicken chettinad was ordered. The bakharkhani slightly sweet was paired perfectly with the chettinad.. the biriyani light, with fried onions, 3 pieces of mutton was signature hyderabadi. Ending was not so south indian, nolen gur er ice cream and a kulfi phaluda..the desserts were good but expensive as seen from the bill.
Cost for these 1350.
Special mention to the staff. Courteous, helpful and got this sandesh stuff pan as mukh sudhi.

Food was well-prepared. The mutton was delicious but¬† the quantity could have been better.
Decor is quite nice, in line with the theme.
Though prices are slightly on the higher side,¬† I would still recommend this place to my fellow foodies.

It was a blunder ordering biryani here.. way too bad...
V ordered mutton biryani, prawn biriyani and chicken Malai kebab.
The only stuff which was palatable was d raita... Funnily they served raita after we finished with d prawn biriyani and were trying to push the mutton biriyani down our throat...
Can't vouch for the South Indian delicacies and I wouldn't dare venture to try it as my experience being real bad....
To top they even charged an extra bottle of mineral water in d bill and on pointing out the bill wasn't changed but the amount returned... Worse they even charge SGST and CGST on the mrp of the bottle...
This is wrong....

Never gonna recommend it to anyone else..

Thought that Panchami would be a perfect day to visit this place.But thanks to their Pujo Special menu,most of the items which i had decided to order, were not available.Limited number of items were on offer in their special menu.It was a bit disappointing. 
Anyway we settled for Hyderabadi murg biriyani, coriander rice,bakarkhani roti,meen porichadu and some green colour chicken preparation (don't remember the name). 
The meen porichadu was dull.Tasted like fish pasinda.
But the coriander rice was just wonderful. Its flavour was subtle and it made a great combo with the green chicken(not great but i liked it). 
The biriyani was also good and its chicken was also very flavourful.
Bakarkhani roti was a bit hard, but then i have no idea as to how it should taste. 
Overall it was a mixed experience ; i really wished i could get the items which i had went there for..

Tamarind, located just by the main road easily catches the eye. The most interesting thing about this restaurant is that it serves both North Indian and South Indian cuisine, the flavours of one being poles apart from the other. The wooden interiors and paintings on the wall are mesmerising. They offer a complimentary welcome drink i.e. Buttermilk or chaas which is extremely refreshing in the humidity-sticken weather here. I visited this place twice. On my first visit, I tried their North Indian menu. The order was simple Murg Shahi Korma with Butter Naan. The food was okayish. Nothing over the top.
I decided to give it another shot just because i had liked the ambience. I dropped in for an early lunch but wasn't expecting much from the food. This time the order was Mutton Boti Kebab for starter and Chettinad Chicken along with Lemon rice as main course. And to my surprise, the food was superb! The kebabs melted in the mouth, the tangy Chettinad Chicken was a welcome change to the taste buds, the Lemon rice was excellent. Finally, they served a complimentary sweet paan which completed the hearty meal.
I would suggest to opt for their South Indian delecacies. Their quantity and taste suffices every penny you spend. The North Indian dishes are something they need to work on. I really hope they catch up with it soon.
Cheers!

Tamarind had always been a favourite restaurant because truth to be told there are a very few restaurants who make such brilliant delicacies in the non vegetarian South Indian cuisine. The spicy Andhra dishes will set your receptors in your tongue into overtime to keep you along with those wonderful flavours that keep bursting from those dishes. And the meat.... I really don't know what they do with the meat because as soon as you put it inside it just melts and when I say melts I mean melts. So be rest assured that when you walk in you are walking into one of the best meals that you are going to ever taste. The ambience is wonderful and the staff are so warm that they will make you feel completely at home. And their suggestions are also brilliant. The quantity is good and the pricing is also reasonable enough not to burn a hole in your pocket while you eat away to glory. So the next time you want something new absolutely give Tamarind a try because you will be felt not only with a smiling face but also a smiling stomach.

While Ammini is very sharp focused on menu listing, Tamarind offers more variety in coorg and coromandal cuisines. Nice and minimalistic place, extremely popular and swarmed on practically any day of the week (a little waiting time shall be in order)

Really one of my favourite restaurants. Practically one of the only ones who prepare appam to such perfection. Most of the dishes are well done. Deserts are yummy too, don't miss the payasam. Stick with the paya soup, chettinad chicken. Do not forget to ask the waiter for other options. Taking away half a point for the steep price though.

My husband and I came here on the two day onam festival. Even though we had prebooked a table we were made to wait for 25 mins. And then too we were given a corner table at there private dining room. We immediately ordered for two non veg thalis a drink and poppadums. After around 40 mins the Waiter told us that they had not taken our order only. After complaining to the manager several times after around an hour our thali came that too when we were ready to just walk off. The food after all this wait was just so ordinary. The shocking thing is we came here a day before and got such good service and food. The restaurant was simply not accomplished to handle a thali meal. The waiters kept dropping the food off the banana leaf while clearing the table. They'd cleanse one side of the table and forget to clear the rest of it. Even empty tables were not cleaned unless the new guests arrived.

Tamarind has on offer a wide range of dishes belonging to the Malabar,Konkan and Coromandel Coast.

Located opposite to the entrance of the DKS Club at Deshapriya Park,this joint has a comfortable and spacious seating arrangement,ideal for get togethers.

For starters we had the Chicken 65,a preparation made with garlic and dry red¬† chillies.
In main course we had Coriander Rice with Mutton Massa Stew,which is a light preparation made with coconut milk. Only drawback was that the portion of mutton served was less.

Prices are on the higher side,which is acceptable given that the taste of their dishes are appetising.

This was one the best restaurants I've ever visited. We live in Newtown and although this place is half way across the city it was completely worth it.
What we ordered : COORG CHICKEN FRY and BHETKI TANDOORI. Both of these starters were delicious the chicken was too good to not order, and the bhetki was very very well cooked.
For main course we ordered VEINRICHINA MUTTON which was by far the best dish of the entire meal. The mutton could not have been cooked better and the preparation was quite unique as well. With that we had the CORIANDER PULAO which took us by surprise because it was so well made. We ended up having it without any gravy at all. We also ordered a chicken dish called MIRAPAKKAI KODI which according to them is the spiciest dish on their menu this was not that good compared to the others, with an overwhelming taste to kari leaves. Also the VEG CHETTINAD was rather disappointing.
Overall amazing experience and I would definitely visit again.
PRO TIP: always ask the waiters for their suggestions.

Revisited this place after almost 7 years and was not dissapointed!!! Ordered for starters dakshini yera. Its prawn coated with masala and fried with onions and served with andhra chutney. It was fresh and hot.. then came the chicken chettinad with appam. Chicken pieces were succulent and juicy and realy nice in flavour. Lastly ordered crabs... i had them last time here so could not leave without having it. Peethala coorg was the name of the dish.. it was fiery hot and fresh crabs with steaming rice and a dash of lemon on it.. i loved it and will come back to this place soon... ended it with payasam... you need it to settle your food pipe with all the chillies that went through!!!

Tamarind is a good place to visit if you are on the look out for cuisine from the South of India. The welcome drink is refreshing and good on the stomach. The Malabar parathas are flaky , light and tasty. Never realised that raw bananas or Kacha Kolas could prepared so well. The staff give you an exact knowledge of what and how the particular dish will be prepared.

But I suggest you to save it for later. You need it after a heavy meal. Portion size is gud. One portion of every dish is enough for two people.

Tamarind offers both north Indian and suth Indian cuisine. We tried the south Indian one due to personal preference. To start off with the decor : it looked really pretty, gives you that South Indian home vibes. The food - Kori Neiroast, which is supposed to be a ghee fried chicken, though lacked the ghee Aroma/flavour which I had expected seeing the ingredient list, was pretty good in taste, well cooked. Mains we had Andhra Pulao Mutton with Kori Gassi and all were very well cooked (both mutton and chicken. also the Mutton in the Pulao was boneless), right amount of heat, spices, in short extremely flavourful. For drinks we had Coconut Lassi and mango+cofee flavoured drink ( I don't recollect the exact names) were amazing as well. Its not a fine dine as such but definitely a good option if you want to eat really good food in a budget. The staff were extremely courteous and super helpful while selecting the menu items. All in all a real good experience.

Well this was my 5th time at Tamarind and as usual I found the place awesome. The staffs are very good and they always pay attention. And the best part is that they always stand next to your table, so you dont have to call them. They just know when you require them. Furthermore located just beside Deshapriya Park this restaurant is small yet cosy and if you want to have some quite and peaceful time while enjoying your Lunch and Dinner this is the place to go. Now coming to the food part. Based on my past experiences I would strongly suggest that if you do not like South Indian Food please do not try it here. They cook South Indian foods in traditional South Indian Style which means you will find coconut oil, Curry Leaves, chillies, Grated ginger and fried onions. I am not quite fond of south Indian Dishes. So I would definitely suggest that you take Chicken Lababdar and Cheese naan both of which are awesome. However today we tried Fish Ajwaini Tikka, Kodi Koda (a chicken curry) and Mutton Andhra Polao. But the best part of this restaurant is the Iliyam Payasam and The Kulfi. Iliyam Payesam is a kind of sweetdish prepared with Coconut Milk and shredded coconut which is quite good and delicate on the palate. And the Kulfi is just awesome here. Please do try it.

I live between Tamarind and Oudh. Coastal Food never actually gave me any kind of happy sensation until and unless I tried it. The First dip into the Mutton Stew and I'm a fan. Previously the place we didn't feel like because it was coastal and now it has become a staple, at least once a month. From their starters to their desserts I love each and everything. Chicken 65, Kastoori Kabab, Mutton Shorba,Mutton Nihari the main course list is way longer Mutton Stew, Vegetable Stew, Malabar Chicken,Malabar Prawns, Nalli Nihari and the most favourite Saddivilla Qorma it's just the best, the prawns are prefect and whenever you dip an Appam into the Qorma you feel your taste buds dancing, desserts Nalen Gurer Ice Cream and the Gulab Jamun are out of this world. Oh yes, how can I forget the Hydrabadi Biriyani they're brilliant as well.

Tamarind is a restaurant which has proved that south Indian food is more than idli,dosa,uttapam.Their authentic South Indian nonveg dishes are just awesome.One should must try Chicken Chettinad ,& malabar chicken & the hydrabadi biriyani.I bet you will never forget the taste.Their prompt service and wonderful wooden decorations will make you feel to come repeatedly.Its always been my favorite South Indian restaurant. It will always be.

We went during the Durga Puja.The biriyani was ¬†just average ¬†where as the chicken in white gravy was too sweet to go with the biriyani and the waiters had not suggested though we had asked for their suggestion regarding the side dish.The butter milk was not good for me as I like it with a hint of sweetness.This to me is not a place which I shall visit again.

Intro: it was a luncheon date with the missus. Beating the scorching sun , standing under the shade of the stairs to the restaurant, i was pondering upon the fact that this restaurant have always been on my radar and how i have always ended up missing it. But anyhow it was gonna change that day!

Location: right on the deshapriya park crossing, towards sishumangal hospital.

Ambience: this is one of the USP of the place; perfect wooden indoors, comely lighting and decor. The seats were comfortable and the table was neatly done. It was almost empty being a working day and an uncommon hour. Seated , we were served with a tikha ghol sort of a welcoming drink. I didn't like it much.

Service: we were famished and thanks to their prompt service, we really enjoyed our meal.

Food: we immediately ordered a khozi soup and settled for dakshini yera as starter , upon suggestions of the attendants.
The food arrived in no time. Lemme tell you, Khozi soup was the bomb. It is the south Indian version of tom yum soup. It was soured , garnished with exotic spices, hot and with innumerable pieces of chicken swimming in it. Delcioso.
Dakshini yera: 5 jumbo sized prawns coated n fried crisply served with a beyond definition yummy chutney. Personally , I felt that the prawns were mutated; they were so big n fleshy!! If the soup was the bomb , this starter was the mother of all bombs ;). The chatni n prawn combo was the show stopper.

After that we ordered a lemon rice for mains and opted for chicken Chettinad as side.
Choosing lemon rice for chicken Chettinad was a bad decision, both were sour n kinda ruined the mood of our lunch. Saying that, I must acknowledge that chicken Chettinad was, juicy succulent pieces of chicken cooked in a fiesta of spices and I enjoyed it, thoroughly!

Cost: it cost us about 1.5 k. That's pretty decent rate for the food they serve.

Conclusion: its a nice place, a definite gem of southern culinary recipes in Kolkata and I loved it.

Tamarind has been around in this city for quite some time now. But I hadn't tried it out until now. They serve authentic South Indian as well as North Indian cuisine. 

They have traditional wooden interiors that reflect south India. The staff is courteous and well aware of the kind of food being served. So if you're confused, then definitely ask for their suggestion. 

I have tried Chicken Chetinad, Malabar Chicken, Chicken Kora Gassi and with plain Appam. The best combination ever. If you're somebody who LOVES spicy food then you should definitely try because it's made of all kinds of chillies.

For the records....South Indian cuisine an I go in absolute opposite directions. But rather, to my surprise,tamarind proved to be a wonderful experience. Keeping in mind the theme of the restaurant,the decor and ambience, has been kept quintessentially South Indian,and has been executed with finesse. The masala buttermilk they serve as condiments, are amazing and very refreshing. Their repertoire offers delicacies from all the 4 states of the region and is an ensemble to look for. Off whatever I had tried in their restaurant, each and every one of them were absolutely scrumptious. My personal favourites were the cheese appams, which was the perfect icing on the cake. I would definitely recommend everyone to try this place for once,as arguably, this is one of the best places to try out if you want to divulge in a culinary escapade of our Southern India....

Yesterday I ordered my dinner from Tamarind through Zomato: Crab Meat dumplings in a gravy and chicken chettinad. The chicken chettinad was just amazing, the way it should be cooked. Every spoonful of the chicken chettinad bursted with aromatic flavours. The chicken pieces were soft, juicy and succulent. The crab meat dumpling had a great gravy, spicy and tangy, will a perfectly balanced concoction of flavours. But I have a concern with the dumplings, it had more potato in it rather than actual crab meat, which was not all accounted for. Please increase the proportion of crab meat in the dumplings. Overall, it was a nice experience.

Tamarind, you take a bow for your Chicken Chettinad.

If you want non vegetarian food from the four South Indian states this is THE place to be at...the decor is interesting with panelled wood everywhere...we started off with Coorg chicken fry and went straight off to the main course...steamed rice paired with Malabar Prawn Curry, Chicken Chettinad and Mutton Upakari followed in quick succession till we could not move...kulfi faluda, nolen gurer icecream and the famous filter coffee of South India brought our meal to a highly satisfying end...they also serve North Indian fare but we did not feel the need to try that

It was a delightful experience indeed....
Located just a few steps from deshapriya park ,this place serves really good food
The ambience is very very simple yet beautiful.
As far as the dishes are concerned they are absolutely authentic. The Coorg chicken fry was delicately flavoured with spices making the dish a stunner.
The Malabar chicken and steamed rice were a perfect team....Low on the spice quotient but extremely tasty.
Tamarind proves that south Indian dishes are more than idli-vada-dosa-sambhar.
Loved it

We had always associated Southern India with its Idli, Dosa and Uttapam but Tamarind will tell you that there is much more to it. Being Bengali non-veg is must when we dine out and this restaurant satiated our appetite for south indian¬†non-veg food. ¬†We were served an appetizer buttermilk (complementary) when we took our seats. We had ordered for Meen Porichadu¬†(starters), Appam, Andhra chicken pulao, Mutton uppu¬†kari¬†(too spicy) and¬†Cheemmeen curry ( a must-have). The service is good. The decor has a beautiful touch of Southern India. A must try for foodies with a taste to explore.

Tamarind is a restaurant quintessentially serving South Indian delicacies..and yet not the same dosa idli sambhar available in pan Indian eateries. It boasts of a wide array of authentic Southern spices and flavours used in their dishes. The soups and stews are simple and delicious, the meat soft and succulent, relying on very basic ingredients which creates magic. The recipes seem to be carried on for generations to be modified according to the new age palate and yet retaining their same cultural values. I would recommend the Mutton stew with appam and the elaneer payassam. All in all Tamarind has touched both my heart and my taste buds.

Graceful decor in the South Indian style. South Indian food in Kolkata, it's always the standard dosa-idli restaurants. We found this well-furnished good restaurant in middle of Kolkata which serves Non-veg south Indian food, which is actually quite amazing because it is quite rare. The food was awesome, and i loved the chicken and the uttapams. 

The buttermilk that they served is not to be missed at all.

Have heard from foodie friends that Tamarind's USP lies in their South Indian cuisine.
Tried their Hyderabadi chicken biryani with raita however at the Biryani & Kebab Festival being held in City Centre 1 & 2. 
The biryani was light, but less salted. Chicken pieces were light and mild too. Overall satisfactory, but don't expect somerhing like an Arsalan biryani to come out of their kitchen.

Experimenting with has taken for different parts of the country and have introduced me to various new cuisines and tastes. What's beautiful about the place is not actually the decor but the food in itself. Although the name might have a Southy touch the place is a confluence of the two sides of the country. A serene amalgamation of the tastes. One of the very few places to serve good spicy Chettinadu style food with the heaviness of taste from the Pinds. Must try - Mutton stew.

Located at a prime location of Deshapriyo Park with not many same grade restaurants nearby. Extremely well decorated and specialists in South Indian dishes. It was not much crowded keeping in mind that it was 1st January. We were promptly attended and served with a complementary South Indian Dahi-Ghol type. It was extremely spicy and didnt like it at all. We ordered Pudina Paratha, Masala Kulcha and Cheese Ball Kopta. Pudina Paratha was out of the world. Kulcha and Kopta were very good too. It was a good 1st experience and will definitely visit again to try other dishes.

Want to taste real south indian cuisine?Yes u are in the right place.Awesome food,awesome ambiance,excellent service, courteous staffs.... everything was so so perfect.
From welcome drink to starters to main course to complimentary pan, everything was so good.
For starters we had coorg chicken fry and meen bezule,both of them were too good.Chicken was soft,fresh and the fish was well marinated and infused with flavours (though they can decrease the amount of salt)
In main course we ordered butter tandoori roti (extremely soft and tasty), Hyderabadi chicken biriyani (perfect blend of south indian flavours with boneless pieces of chicken in it.This dish will leave a long lasting impression in your mind).For side dish we ordered mutton chettinad..
Awesome experience will definitely revisit the place again.

Best place for some great South Indian dishes. Been here to have some South Indian food. Ambience is awesome, hospitality is great. Ordered Bangala Dumpa Vepudu (Aloo Fry), Arati Kaya Vepudu (Plantain Fry) and Shrimp 65 for starters. All three are superb though shrimps were small in size. Taste is as authentic as what we South Indians have at home. And then we ordered Coconut Rice, Plain Rice, Tomato Pappu (Tomato Dal) and Kothimiri Kodi (Coriander Chicken). All these are very tasty, especially Coconut Rice is really great. Had Butter Milk in the end which is great too. Simply loved being there. Would definitely go there again.

A South Indian based cuisine but you don't get to have dosas here. Yes there are no dosas. The menu is based extensively on the southern states including Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and also Sri Lanka( Limited ). You see the menu and you are surely going to have difficulty in pronouncing most of the names. A classical south indian end decor. Nice patient waiters. You will definitely need those since one has to ask what to order before they actually do. A out of the box taste breaking the orthodox Kolkatian Food that you get. They also have a tandoor menu. Though we did not have that given the far different South Indian Choices available. The food is decent and full of curry leaves and pepper. You get a complimentary buttermilk and a yummy paan in the end. Overall you will have a nice experience for foodies it's a must try.

My order;

Veg. Mulligatawny soup ( lentil soup )

Bangala Dumpa Vepudu ( Must try if you like spicy )

Appam ( Rice Pancake )

Malabar Paratha 

Bakharkhani ( Hydrabadi Roti)

Bissibela Hulianna (South Indian Khichdi)

Avial

I thought it was interesting that a restaurant could offer such a range of South Indian cuisine from different restaurants... I ordered a kodi vepudu which has way too much sauce on it, killed the taste... Mutton in the kerala gravy I ordered was highly undercooked, parota was alright....
The restaurant had commendable interior decor with average service (attention was a bit less) and the menu pricing was also competitive.

Went to this place last year (2015) during puja. There was a big que outside which was quite obvious during such festive season. Anyways after waiting for an hour got the chance. My friend told that it is one of the best restaurants for having south indian foods. Ambience is quite nice. And its a spacious one. Love their decor.
So for food ordered mutton biriyani, chicken chettinad and some other preparations. Biriyani was good. But as am not that familiar to south indian foods so didnot liked the chettinad that much. Pocket pinch was 500 per person.

Soft background music is just perfect for a romantic conversation. We ordered biryani because thats what the place is famous for and the quantity is so much that we had to parcel the rest. They also serve welcome drink which we initially got confused that is it for free or they will charge. Lol. This place sets good example for other biryani places in town. I am looking forward to visit here with my family. üòä

Oh My God... Tamarind never fails to amaze me! Have been visiting since 2010 with family, relatives and friends as well... But today just a few hours ago, we had yet another great lunch and I immedistely decided to write a review finally!
Appetizer :: ofcourse Coorg Chicken Fry. One may also try their kebabs from fish or chicken selections...
Mains :: We had mind-blowing Cheese Appams for the first time! And it's a piece of culinary art... I always order their heavenly Chettinad Chicken (each time) and though we knew that Appam is almost always taken with Mutton stew but I couldn't miss the Chettinad and the Appam paired beautifully with it's mild yet effusing heat... For a less spicy option order their signature Malabar Chicken or Mutton Stew...
Also each time we order their mind blowing herby minty Hyderabadi Biriyani... Pls try to have some of the raita with the Appam as well.
Basically Any meal here would fetch a five star, be it biriyani, appam, chicken or fish or mutton... ! (Fish dishes are on the expensive side but just try their "Fish Niharika" Atleast Once and you'd never be able to forget)!
Last but not the least : the COMPLIMENTARY Chhnach (buttermilk appetizer) and the 'paan' for the perfect ending!
Thanx to Tamarind for making each and every meal worth remembering.             

PIC : Cheese Appam and Chettinad Chicken

South Indian non-veg is not something you come across very easily in Kolkata, so when I came to know of Tamarind, It really caught my attention. The time finally came yesterday, when I visited the place with my family. The ambience is very homely and inviting, with wooden tables and chairs, and the Raja Ravi Verma style paintings evoked memories of my trip to the South. And that was just the beginning. We were offered a complimentary buttermilk, flavoured with curry leaves, mustard and chilli, which really took us back there. Albeit a little sour for my taste, the drink was refreshing nonetheless.

We ordered Coorg Chicken fry, Hyderabadi Mutton Biryani, Malabar Parathas and Chicken Chettinad. I absolutely loved the chicken fry. Large, pieces of chicken flavoured with the tang of tamarind with a coriander-heavy coating tossed with onions and curry leaves. It was a great way to start off the meal. We paired some of it with the biryani and the combination tasted great too. While the rice of the biryani was delicious and quite different from the normal Kolkata or Awadhi style biryanis, the pieces of mutton, though generous in quantity, were extremely chewy, which was a shame, as it would have made it the perfect dish, with the raita alongside.

The paratha was sheer brilliance. With its flaky, fall-apart texture, softness and just a touch of sweetness, went very well with the tangy, spicy Chettinad chicken. The chicken pieces themselves was cooked to perfection. It was spoon tender, and I have never before had a curry-dish with such impeccably cooked chicken. A big thumbs up.

We ended our meal with Nolen gurer ice cream. Two scoops of flavored ice cream, topped with more Nolen gur, with even more of it within crevices in the ice cream, ready to ooze out like a precious sap as you dig and scrape through, enhancing the flavour a hundred-fold. It was the perfect, albeit slighty unauthentic way, to end the meal. They serve complimentary paan at the end of the meal instead of the usual refereshment, and a great paan it is, too.¬†

Service was quick and the servers were very courteous. The prices are a tad high compared to quantity but the quality more than makes up for it. Had the mutton been better cooked, I would have rated it 0.5 more. I will definitely come back to try out some more of thie delicacies like Appam-Ishtu, kothu Paratha and Meen Porichadu. Recommended for those who want to go beyond the usual idli-dosa-sambar stereotype of South Indian cuisine.

Absolutely delightful south Indian delicacies! A great way to discover the world beyond idli-dosas in Kolkata! Have been there a few times earlier...however my recent visit rekindled my love for the place. Had the spicy lentil soup with chicken which was very good. And then Tawa fish for starters. The Tawa fish really blew my mind away! Heavenly! The Kerala style mutton was excuisite with a plan amd pulao, and of course the payasam at the end! This place also serves other south Indian household aithentics like bisibile bhaat, paniyaaram etc. Tbough not in the menu but they also serve fresh coconut water. Very strongly recommended!

We went to for lunch during durga puja. As expected we had to wait for round 20 mins. But totally worth it. Interior is nice with few south indian touches. Although they serve north indian dishes, we ordered only south indian preparations as it ia famous for those. The food was excellent. They hyderabadi biriyani reminded me of  spicy biriyanis which you actually get in hyderabad. All in all very good place if you like south indian non veg dishes. Only thing is the glasses, cutlery and service they provide does not seem up market to match their food. That is probably only area of improvement left.

Located opposite to DKS club in deshapriya park. This is a south Indian cuisine specialised joint. I have been here couple of times but at events held in the banquets. Otherwise the restaurant service is pretty much standardized. 
Please do try the appams. They are basically rotis made of rice mix. Soft succur pancake like but thinner and softer. Team it up with any curry or a chicken 65 like I did, you would have an array of flavours bursting in your mouth. 

However avoid having north Indian here , because you could opt better places for that cuisine. 
Chicken chettinad was again a turn down for me. Because it lacked a lot of balanced flavours. 

For desserts, payasam is a classic south Indian porridge (in Bengali - payesh) which is prepared with tender coconuts and rice and milk coiled together. 
 Worth a try!

Surprisingly, this place was peacefully quiet among the hustle-bustle of a Saptami evening. We were three and wanted to give a try to the famous Hyderabadi  Biriyani and Chicken Chettinad. The quantity was succulent. But, to our surprise, the taste was disappointing. Chicken Chettinad was bland, lacked spices and salt.

Located near deshapriya park. A bit on the expensive side. Serves quality food. Brilliant decor. Service is prompt with friendly staff. My only complain is I wish they served bigger portions for the prices they command

The essence of Tamarind lies in its very welcoming nature. Their relaxed ambience with almost regal decoration is quintessential to a fine dine experience. Considering their cuisine is south Indian I did not expect to have so much variety in the menu.
.
The staff members are very curtious and we were welcomed with a curd drink which was very refreshing for a change. Keeping zomato suggestions in mind we ordered chicken chettinad and Malabar parathas. It tasted very unusual from our regular restaurant foods and equally mouth-watering. At the end of the meal they served paan as refreshment.
.
¬†It is definitely one of the most exceptional eateries in Kolkata. Our unplanned venture transpired into something extraordinary.

Had been on my wishlist for a long time this yesterday was the day i got the taste of their food :D

Well for starters the management had not been kind we wouldnt have been able to entered drenched in rain and able to dry ourselves off and find a good sitting arrangement also 

As for the ambience its very soothing and food and service its top notch ..

Allthough i dont remember what we had for side dish and starters but the hyderabadi biriyani was cherry on top with a side chicken item and drinks like chhanch aslo another one thats one delicious drink too.

Nice restaurant in deshapriya park. I went there with my family and had nice dishes. Biriyani, chakori kebab, chapli kebab, butter naan, one item of mutton rogan josh, veg chandinier and chicken rezala. Biriyani was rich and spiced very nice, chakori kebab was awesome, chicken rezala was awesome, veg chandinier was good too. Rogan josh was over spicy and pieces was not nice(max bones).... But, one dish doesn't smash anything. Overall it was a nice experience. Good food overall. Liked it. Love 2 visit again.

Located right in front of the DKS club at Deshapriya. Visited this south indian themed restaurant¬† to enjoy the Sunday brunch. Love their non veg coorgi style south indian dishes. Their welcome drink - butter milk tastes lovely. I would greatly recommend to try out their coorgi fried chicken - amazing taste , mutton stew served with appam - the piping hot white light gravy flavoured with curry patta, nolen gur ice cream. The wooden furnitures and great wall paintings all around the world goes perfect with the themed food. Staff are very courteous.

Most of the South Indian food joints serve vegetarian dishes. Tamarind is special for they serve non vegetarian south Indian dishes along with north Indian. They have a vast menu.

Interior and ambience: Wide sitting arrangement, nice art work and painting of the wall make you feel special. On sitting we were welcomed with a glass of cool butter milk- nice hospitality.

Food: CORG CHICKEN FRY- one of their specialties. Perfectly fried, juicy chicken pieces were served with herbs and spices. It was spicy and flavoursome.
FISH ACHARI TIKKA- It was a disaster. It was too salty, none of us liked it.
DAKSHINI MURG KEBAB: Delicious. My personal favourite.
APPAM: Both plain and cheese appams were good. But a bit overpriced.
MALABAR CHICKEN: Perfect side dish for APPAM. Gravy was very tasty. Addition of curry leaves had definitely enriched it's taste and flavour.

Visited the place with family to taste Hyderabadi biriyani. We also took coconut honey drink and 2 more Malabar dishes. Those were spicy as was supposed to be .even the hyderabadi biryani was prepared quite authentic way the way it should have been.But all the foods were short of salt which led to too spicy taste, although I prefer les salt. So please take care in preparation. Service and ambience was good. In Kolkata u can probably get Hyderabadi Biryani only here, prepared almost in the most authentic way. Please maintain the quality and proper salt in food.

"Non veg South Indian food in Kolkata.. You must be joking."¬†

This is the expression I received from my friends when I told them about this place. I cannot blame them for every other south Indian joint in Kolkata serve only various type of Dosas, Upmas etc this place is like a hidden treasure serving authentic non veg south Indian food from Kerala, Andhra Pradesh etc.

The ambiance of the place was really spectacular in all aspect. The service was impeccable. We visited the place a little before its shut down time... still we took our time in eating and the waiters were always there at our service. Designed beautifully this place is a must visit.

Coming to the food this place serves both north and south Indian food. But i would suggest to go for the south Indian dishes which are rare in Kolkata.

We Ordered Coorg Chicken Fry in starter, Erachi Curry, Hydrabadi Prawn Biriyani and Pomfret Masala in main course. All the food was top notch.... The pomfret masala was delicious as was the erachi curry but the best was the coorg chicken fry.... I would suggest to have the chicken fry to everyone. Also had Nolen goorer Ice cream. :P

Overall rating..... Great Place to have a great time with a slightly different food. :)

South indian cuisine is much more than idli rasam and sambar . They have gr8 non veg items too. If u want to taste these Tamarind is the place to be.
First of all the decor is nice and the stuff is superb.
Started with coorg chicken fry, it was different with a distinct tangy taste.
Had appam and andhra mutton curry for the main course, it was hot and spicy with super tender muttons.
Another thing i love about yhe place is the complimentary butter milk . It is an appetizer and palette cleanser at the same time.

All in all a good experience

I cannot tell how much i enjoyed the food and hospitality here! Must try specialities - Coorg Fried Chicken.. Mind blowing! Daal makhani is another awesome dish here.. 

The person who served us were such lively respectful people... All these words ate just less! Though we made our last order at 10:50 pm and continued eating till 11:20 pm, they did not hurry us to close. Instead they kept serving with pleasure and also offered to click out group picture. What an amazing staff i must say all should visit and you have no idea how special you will feel!

Complete value for money and lovely time spent! Will definitely recommend visiting..

Fantastic job team Tamarind !

Tamarind is a gem of a place.Primarily because its the only restaurant in Kolkata serving unique south indian delicacies . It proves that south indian food is much more than idli and dosa .

They have spacious seating with wooden flooring.Wonderful paintings adorn the walls ,giving it a bit of a luxurious feel.
On my visit, I was welcomed with a glass of cool butter milk which is complimentary for every guest (and you can have refills too !) .

From the appetisers , we tried the Coorg chicken fry and Tawa fish .

The chicken was pan fried with strong flavours .It was delicious .

The tawa fish was perfectly cooked.Also the flavours were very balanced and I loved the texture of the fish.

Next we went for the main course and ordered Chicken Hyderabadi Biryani with Kodi Koora chicken.

Although the quality of the rice could have been better ,the flavours were top notch and the 'hyderabadi' touch of strong spices was very much there.

The Kodi Koora was made in an onion-tomato gravy.It was quite tangy and went well with the spice of the biryani.

The service was very prompt.Also the waiting time for the food was quite reasonable.

I will definitely be visiting them again .

I went there today, the decoration is too good and we ordered vegetable allisa as soup and kuzhi paniyarram as starter.the dishes both are from south section. With starter they gave a tomato chutni that was awasum. After that we ordered hyderabadi biriyani, 1 biriyani is enough for two people and taste was amazing. Moreover decoration is very good and reasonable price. If you search a south indian resturant as well as north indian you should try tamarind.

LOCATION:

Situated near Deshapriya Park sharing a prime piece of frontage on Sarat Bose Road.¬†

OVERVIEW & INTERIORS:

After a long innings of negative or average reviews, I am glad I landed up at this smart and traditionally decorated place serving North Indian and Coastal Cuisines. Both the interiors and exteriors are well done and stay true to the Southern Theme. I loved the woodwork all over and even the chairs and tables are designed like those you would ideally find in a nice restaurant in South India. The menu is very interesting and will make you want to experiment a little beyond your comfort zone.¬†

WINE & DINE:

Egg Appam,Butter Chicken, Tomato Pappu and Malabar Paratha was what was chosen from an elaborate menu.

The Butter Milk came first as a complimentary pallate cleanser. It was well made with some great spices in there. I am a big fan of well marinated vinegar onions. While some might find this amusing, I think this basic complement can speak volumes about the quality of food at a traditional cuisine restaurant. And believe me, they were perfect !.¬†

The Egg Appam came first. It was soft, steaming hot and melting in the mouth. Just pickle and onions were enough to enjoy the same. Although, we missed ordering a portion of Chicken Chettinad. It would have done wonders for the Appam.

The Tomato Pappu, which is a tomato based dal was great although its not for the faint hearted. It was quite spicy. Mangalorian food generally does have a spicy flare to it which makes it authentic. I had never tasted anything like this before.

The Butter Chicken was the best I have had. It was rich yet light, the chicken was cooked perfectly and was present in generous quantity and the Kasturi Methi took the dish to another level. I would go back for this one.

The Malabar Paratha would come in one of my favorites breads in the city. It was crispy around the edges but soft in the middle, had been layered like a laccha paratha and had perfect thickness. Simple great !.

Service was good and the stewards serving us were kind enough to serve with a smile.

FEEDBACK FOR IMPROVEMENT:

I think they need to look at their airconditioning. On a very humid weekend, the place can get awfully stuffy when its busy.

VERDICT:

Slightly expensive but worth it, slightly warm but worth it !

you need to be here several times to try all their specialities, coz there's a very long list of them. honestly, so many of these items are so unique. don't expect the usual taste here that you get everywhere else. come here with different tongue for a unique cuisine. if you are ready for that, this will be a lovely experience. comfortably park your car right in front, enter and walk up a few stairs into the restaurant. the seating is cozy and uncluttered. sit, chat, eat and enjoy. great place to host parties too. very good on outdoor catering as well. i have tried it all from here. never disappointed with their warm service.

South Indian Non-Veg Restaurant.
Apart from Idli-Dosa-Appam, if you really want to tickle your taste buds with a mix-n-match of spices...Tamarind I recommend. 
Coorg chicken fry is too good...its the succulent pieces of chicken marinated in tamarind sauce and roasted/grilled hard to give the smoky feel. 
Chettiyad chicken I had with my buddy...a plate is enough for too..its a bit spicy and really heavy one.
The complimentary drink-butter milk is good to drink instead of water and we asked for another one..they didnt charge for it.
Dessert is okay...u have other places for dessert. 
Ambience is purely south indian...pictures ..artefacts and interiors will submerge you. Pocket pinch Rs 1200 for two.

Not all South Indian places need to serve dosas. This place has truly brought Andhra &Kannad cuisine to Kolkata. Ambience is nice, almost real photographs giant pots etc. But lets talk food. The veg thali is a must try for those who want to try a lot and not miss what a true andhra/kannad thali can be. The servings are good and complete. You wont regret not ordering ala carte. Check with the manager for the thali. Their coconut drink with slight honey and lemon is refreshing with all the spices you will be taking in. And when they say spicy it is spicy.red hot spicy. The baby potatoes in red chilli paste is buttery and spicy and the pachchakai stew(vegetables in coconut gravy) is soothing flavourful and delicious. The light appams iddiappams go real well. Cross check with the server always as they usually contain eggs. Try the pepper rasam if you are fond of rasams in general.
They have nolen gur icecream to make the Bengali in us happy!!
You gotta eat here!

went here today after hearing a lot about it .the place is located just opposite ti deshapriya park at the sarat bose road . We entered and was immediately in a house of those in south india. the ambience was great. we were next served with the welcome drink the chaach. we ordered chicken coorg fry for starters. Followed it up with kothu paratha, chicken chettinad and for desserts we had double ka meetha. now kothu paratha was well cooked with eggs,onion and tomato. the chicken chettinad was quite spicy and it was heavy too . and the dessert seemed to taste different but not that much to die for. The service was courteous and i asked for another chaach and they promptly gave it without adding any extra charge to the bill.overall food was quite tasty¬† with a different flavour. so if u want a taste of variety with dishes cooked in different falvours and spices just go and have a seat there.

Tamarind is the first restaurant where I tasted South Indian non veg food. It is now one of our favourite restaurants. To start with the ambiance here is excellent. The service is also friendly. I love their menu where they mention the originating state beside each dish and describe it in detail too.

Our favourite dishes here includes the Mutton Alisha soup, Peethala Koora (crab masala), Chicken 65, Mysore Mutton etc. For dessert Elaneer Payasam was excellent. Prices are on the higher side, but the taste and ambiance will surely make you happy.

I just love the place... Its Kerala away from Kerala.... The quality of food is just amazing the mutton is so soft and tender. Excellent quality of fish. Please visit if you want to tickle ur taste buds with some southindian taste and flavour.

Tamarind is not an authentic south Indian food joint if you have at all tasted the original tamil or kannad food. Considering the fact that I stayed for quite some time in coimbatore and tasted their 23 different types of rasam, travelled to kochi and hogged appam and even kind of liked coriander rice,tamarind could not satiate my south Indian taste bud. Their appam was pathetic, staff was just ok not friendly,excessively expensive as compared to the food quality and style. I would neither go myself again and won't recommend anyone else if you are a real tamil food connoisseur but for those who have never tasted the authentic south Indian food pls flock.

This restaurant has a beautiful ambience with wooden flooring, and sitting here while it's raining outside can be an experience with all the spicy smells wafting around. While the menu is a melange of North Indian and South Indian delicacies, we tried their South Indian offerings.  

1) Kuzhi Paniyaram was a starter. While this , I believe was a Tamil recipe, this dish was similar to a kannadiga dish ' Appe' . They were basically rice cakes with a soft boiled filling subtly infused with spices. The tomato chutney complemented the dish perfectly.

2) murungakai soup -  Beautiful soup which tastes SOMEWHAT like sambar. The spice hits you slyly only in the throat while the flavours are really subtle on the tongue.

3) hyderabadi mirchi ka saalan with coriander rice- the salan could have been slightly tastier. The Coriander rice was amazing and was cooked in ghee. 

4) double ka mitha was a nice end to the dinner.

They serve a complementary drink- buttermilk in the beginning and pan in the end. It was a very fulfilling meal and was well worth the money spent.

The only problem faced by me was that the server forgot to note down the order for Chettinad chicken which he promptly offered to correct but we refused as we were halfway through the meal. However, one could notice that the coordination within the servers was slightly off as they were asking the same questions regarding the order again. However, the food and the ambience more or less made up for this slight glitch.

I just love this place. Had Coorg chicken for starter, which tastes just right.  The chicken 65  is also very good. It is crisp and juicy inside.  For the mains, the Malabar chicken gravy with Malabar parantha is my all time favourite as it is non-spicy, the chicken gravy is thick & aromatic. The Kori gassi is also very nice , it is a bit spicy. I always visit this place for South Indian non-veg food.

It is located just opposite to the DKS Club. Ambiance and as well the ¬†decor is nice and will give you a totally different feeling altogether. The wall hangings, artifacts and paintings are eye-catchy! Staffs are cordial and attentive. They served welcome drinks too. Food is okayish, all of them have a South Indian foods' taste-touch which is a bit different but nice. ¬†Kebabs are too good and succulent. We ordered Murg Shahi Korma which was okay-type, the gravy could have been a little thinner, it was way too thick. Try to avoid paranthas as the Laccha Paranthas which we order was hard and not palatable and I left to be very overpriced too. Overall had a okay kind of experience, expected a lot more after hearing to the reviews.

What we ordered - Murg Mumtaz Tangri Kebab, Laccha Parantha,¬†Murg Shahi Korma

Tamarind is a restaurant which has been here for quite a few years now, and its supremacy in South Indian cuisine remains unchallenged. There is an acute shortage of quality restaurants serving authentic South Indian cuisine but Tamarind makes up for all the city‚Äôs lacking. And right now I find me kicking myself for not having visited this place before.

The dramatically set up entrance opens into a decorated staircase which leads up to the restaurant on the first floor. The stairway is decorated with quirky artefacts and also the prizes and certificates this place has won over the years. The entrance to the dining area is through two classical wooden sliding doors. Right at the entry there is a serene celestial set up with a lavish diya stand and deity idol. The d√©cor is so traditional with gorgeous paintings and wooden finish furnishings which echoes scenes from the South Indian cultures.

Very elegantly designed space which serves some authentic south Indian food (apart from Tandoori items which we didn't try). The AC could have been a little better as overall it was bit warm. A spicy Buttermilk was given complimentary. For starter we had Meen Pori Chadu which was a Kerala fish preparation. It was boneless and extremely juicy. In the main course we had Kori Gassi was the boneless chicken prepared in a tomato-based curry, a dish from Mangalore along with Appam and Kai Kari Pulao (veg pulao). Overall taste was extremely good and am definitely will be visiting the place again. A paan was served in the end, which again was complimentary.

Tamarind is definitely one of the best restaurant in Kolkata where you can enjoy good food. I had visited with my son and ordered Nawabi Dhingri Kawab as snacks and Papri Alu Patiyala, Dal Makhani with Chapati and Butter Nan. Snacks was served with green chutney was good in taste and presentation. Alu Patiyala and Daal Makhani was tasty but it could be little more better. Nan and Roti was really so good. They also serves complimentary chach (mathaa) which was good.

This restaurant carry simple South Indian inspired interior which is good but the sitting need to improve with soft mattress as some of the sitting are bare wood benchs and with its hard surface where sitting so long is unpleasant, similarly air conditioning need to improve as we have not feeled efficient cooling and they have placed a heavy duty stand fan near the kitchen doors which is too noisy and sitting in nearby table we got feeling of sitting in a workshop and finally we asked to stop the fan.

Service is good n fast but the guy taking order is unaware of art of taking order and done repeated mistake.

This restaurant served South Indian foods and North Indian foods and achieved many awards. next time my plan is to taste haidrabad biryani with mirch ka salan.

My family comes here a lot.
I never accompanied them because I am not too fond of South Indian cuisine. 
But boy was I wrong! 
This place has the most amazing decor.
I would literally give it a 5 for its ambience. 
Beautiful paintings and soothing atmosphere.
The staff and service us superb.
Now coming to the food. 
They surprised me!
I don't remember the exact names but for starters we had a fish it was brilliant. 
Main course comprised of vegetable polao coriander rice chettinad chicken and a preparation of mutton.
The vegetable rice was excellent and the taste of the chettinad chicken instantly brought back beautiful memories of my Kerala trip. 
I ordered American brownie with ice cream for dessert and it was a mistake. 
This is not a very nice dessert , the brownie was super hard. 
This was the only reason I deducted. 5  from the review otherwise this restaurant deserves a 5 on 5.
P.S. They also serve a beautiful welcome drink that just prepared you for the savoury treat you are going to have (because I am not too sure about the sweet treat!)

P.P.S. Love their menu card.
So innovative!

Tamarind is one of a kind restaurant in its category. This place is situated behind Desapriya park.

On entering one has to climb few stairs to discover its nicely decorated interior. The furniture are nicely arranged and the wall hangings reflect rich south Indian culture. Upon taking the seat we were nicely created by a polite staff who knew very well about the menu.

First, the served complementary Rasam (butter milk). In starters we ordered Coorg Chicken fry and Kothu Paratha. Coorg chicken fry is an extraordinary dish where 8 big pieces of chicken were marinated nicely with south indian spices and tossed with onion and coconut.(5/5)
Kothu paratha is a flaky indian bread tossed with scrambled eggs and tomatoes.(4/5)

Then we tried Coriander Rice and Mutton Erachi Curry. Coriander rice was subtle, erachi curry on the other hand, was rich creamy curry with 8 tender pieces of mutton.(5/5)
After having this hearty meal we wrapped up with Nolen gurer ice cream.(10/5)..üòã

The Pocket pinch is quite high. A hearty meal for two will set you back by ‚Çπ2000

Tamarind is yet another gem in the crown of the food capital of India. The restaurant serves food from both the North & the South of the country. However I prefer the South Indian preparations, especially the non-vegetarian dishes. Their Chicken Chettinad and Mutton Sukka are to die for. Some of you will find their Appam a little thick, but yummy nonetheless. They also score well on the counts of hospitality and ambience. The complimentary buttermilk at the beginning and the paan at the end help them corner a few more brownie points.

Prominent location makes Tamarind very easily accessible to everyone. It is situated bang opposite DKS club. This place looks beautiful. Very intricately done walls, beautiful paintings hung on them, wooden floors, spacious area , circular tables and comfortable seats. The staff is helpful, courteous and informative in general however I've had an encounter once when the staff was very curt and not available when required. The USP of this place the authentic non vegetarian dishes of South Indian cuisine. Be it Kerala or Andhra Pradesh. They serve a complementary welcome drink which is Butter milk essentially. I absolutely love their Coorg chicken, fish ajwaini, cakori kababs,the rich, spicy malayali mutton dish( I forgot the name! Sorry!) And Hyderabadi biryani. üòç It is quite reasonable if you tally it on the basis of the good food you are getting along with the satisfying dining experience. Must try!

This is my first visit to this place and I am totally awed by the themed ambience and the quality of food!Its located exactly opposite to the DKS club in deshapriya park.Take the lane right beside priya cinemas and go straight- cross the four point crossing and you can see it there right on the main road! The ambience is superb! It has wooden furnishings and yellow bright lights which is really eye catchy.There are paintings portraying Indian art and the water was served in copper glasses.They have two menus-one South Indian and the other North Indian. So one has two choices of cuisine.They also served us a complimentary drink that was in crockery that resembled a mud pot.For starters we had Coorg chicken fry(8 pieces) and fish ajwaini tikka(6 pieces).Both are to die for! The fish melts in the mouth it's that soft and good-the chicken is one of the best chicken starter dish that my tongue has ever rolled on to!For main course we had zafrani pulao, murg biryani and kadhai chicken.all were just amazing in their own way!kadhai chicken comes with 6 pieces of boneless chicken and a spicy flavoursome gravy-the zafrani pulao is a sweetish kind of a dish which is like a typical pulao that complimented the kadhai chicken really very well!Their murg biryani is extremely different from our Kolkata chicken biryani!It has no potato or egg and is best had without a side dish as it is extremely flavoursome and spicy in itself.It also has multiple chicken pieces.I liked it really very much so much to the extent that being an ardent lover of potato i didn't miss it at all.
The prices are a little on the higher side but the quantity served is hugeee!!so that makes up for it! Five of us lunched for 2143 INR which is very affordable! So my suggestion would be to go in bigger groups. I will definitely visit again especially for the fish ajwaini tikka, the Coorg chicken fry and the murg biryani.

Tamarind is definitely one of the better fine dining restaurants in the city, when it comes to Indian food, specially south Indian cuisine. I always had an idea that South Indian cuisine meant veg food, but this place will really surprise you. 
Located in the southern avenue, the place isn't hard to find. The entrance hallway is decorated beautifully with mirrors and paintings of mughal era style. A Rustic ambience blends in well with the food they serve.
Now let's talk about food. Since we were just two people and on a tight budget, we ordered two starters, Chicken 65 and Coorg Chicken Fry. I have never tasted such a 'Chatpata' chicken dish before, the chicken 65 is a must try, so is the other one that I mentioned. 
In main course we took the Hyderabad Biriyani along with a side of Chicken Tikka Masala. The biriyani was wonderful, rich in spices and had shredded mutton bits. The chicken tikka masala is worth recommending too ! Very filling and good quantity. I had to pack some over. 
There are way many dishes on the menu that I want to try out. Looking forward to future visits üòÑüòÑ

Now if you are a fan of South Indian cuisine and no I do not mean just the Masala Dosa or Idli Vada, then Tamarind is the place to go. Not many south indian restaurants here in Kolkata, and the restaurants claiming to serve south indian dishes don‚Äôt go beyond dosas and idli. So if you want some good Andhra or Kerala food, drop in here and you‚Äôll have a lot to choose from. And if you want to go for the north indian dishes, they have that as well.  

Have been to this place a couple of times, and I love their Hyderabadi biriyani & Kodi vepadu (Andhra style chicken in red chilli paste). Well the regulars here with vouch for the Appam and Mutton Stew which is delicious. Somehow, I always ended up visiting this restaurant during Pongal. And that time they have the Pongal Special menu. The first time I had it, I just simply loved all of their dishes. They had so many varieties in the Pongal special Thali, you‚Äôd be confused which one to choose from. This time I made sure I was there during Pongal, and to my utter disappointment, the food wasn‚Äôt up to the mark. It was rather stale and everything was cold. The service level has gone down as well. Even though the place was empty, the waiters were too reluctant to serve. 

Pros:

*Food ‚Äì Delicious

*Ambience ‚Äì Calm 

*Location

Cons:

*Service ‚Äì Is going downwards

We had a lovely experience. We had ordered for home delivery on Mothers Day and were pleasantly surprised. Their food was amazing. The quality is very good and they don't compromise on quantity. Since we are vegetarian Bengalis for ethical reasons, finding good vegetarian food at kolkata outlets is hard (except five stars). But they have excellent vegetarian food. So if you are vegetarian, this place is a MUST try. ¬†We ordered Vegetarian Biriyani, Hariyali Paneer Tikka, Bharwan Aloo, Diwani Handi and Pinapple raita. The diwani handi was a little too rich for us but apart from that all the items were fabulous. Their Veg biriyani, raita and tandoor section is awesome! Thank you for such an awesome experience Tamarind!

This very easy to find restaurant has a regal feel to it right from the go. With the entrance adorned with paintings, mirrors and a royal looking sofa (aka great place to click pics) and the interiors looking classy and old school, the place exudes comfort and hospitality.¬†¬†Anyways, the attendants readily showed us to one of the corner tables and were very attentive and courteous throughout. Service, too, was quick : something of paramount importance if you are a hungry soul on a hot summer day. The menu has two parts, or two separate menu cards rather : one for the North Indian cuisines and another for the South.¬†¬†We stuck to the South part especially because finding a non vegetarian South Indian restaurant is a daunting task in this part of the country. As a matter of fact I am not aware of any place other than Tamarind that serves non veg southern dishes here in Kolkata. We were also served complimentary spiced buttermilk and to further add to the old school ambiance I have been babbling about : the water is served in copper glasses. *Love*¬†
¬†
The food too was great. For starters the the fried Coorg chicken was ample in quantity (8 rather big pieces). The boneless chicken marinated in a coriander paste and then deep fried with onions and pepper corn was a delight. The mutton Hyderabadi biriyani was subtly flavored and had 4 succulent pieces of mutton. Frankly one plate of it is more than enough for two. Complimentary raita is served along with the biriyani. To accompany it we had the famous chicken chettinad : spicy pieces of chicken cooked in a rich curry. While both the Biriyani and the chicken were great individually, together they seemed to affect each other's flavor to some extent.¬†
¬†The bill came with a couple of sweet paans and ensured that we left Tamarind with both our stomachs and hearts happy.

I hosted a luncheon in Tamarind last week. I am sharing my experience for the benefit of readers.

Pros: Starters, main course food items were tasty.

Cons:	(1) Air conditioning was below par - all my invitees were sweating;

¬†(2) At the time of booking, I was informed by Restaurant that the hall could easily accommodate 65 to 70 guests, (they have a standard sitting capacity of 52), where as in reality, with 60 people present (52 adults + 8 kids), we found it was completely over crowded; 

¬†(3) Service is below par. Guests had to wait in long queue to get food. At the later stage, plates were unavailable, spoons were unavailable, many food items (fish, mutton, desserts) were unavailable. Some invitees did not get the opportunity to eat these food items. Cold drinks were not available later;

¬†(4) Quality of dessert (Rasogolla with Mango Rabri) was below par;

¬†(5) Quantity of desserts served (what ever was available to the invitees) was ridiculous. Visually estimating, one scoop of ice cream was about 30% smaller compared to the size of a ping-pong ball;

¬†(6) The food serving area was poorly lit; lighting was insufficient. 

Please note, I have been visiting this restaurant for many many years, and because of the good food experience I had earlier, I had decided to host the party in Tamarind. But in this event, after spending so much money, my experience has been bad. There is huge scope for improvement, specially in the area of adequate and sufficient quantity of food availability, and quality of service. 

At this point in time, I certainly will not advise any one to host a party in this Restaurant....hugely disappointed!!!

I hope the management of Tamarind will listen and take necessary steps to correct. 

Thanks

Those who don't typically like S.Indian (idli,vada) should definitely give this place a visit, as it will change your perception of S.Indian food completely, and for the better.

My second visit to Tamarind after 6 years. The had an option of a Thali, both veg and non veg, to usher in the new year. The non veg thali includes an array of South Indian as well as North Indian items like the Coromondal Cocktail, Ambat(Dal), Mangalorean veg curry, Corn Palak, Kebabs, Coriander rice, etc followed by delicious seasonal desserts. The food is delicious. The quantity was in bulk. The staff is very courteous too. Had an amazing experience which changed my perception bout Keralite food.

Yes, it was my birthday yesterday and the amazing food at 'Tamarind' made it even more special.
Starting with the hospitality, it was really warm and very decent, serving south-indian flavoured 'dahi lassi' with Kari leaves on top. For starters, we had ordered 'chakori kebab' and 'malai kebab', both of which melted in the mouth and trust me, I haven't had such amazingly soft kebabs in Calcutta for a while. 
Next, coming to the main course the 'chicken lababdar' and 'chicken chattinad' served with 'zafrani rice' and 'jeera rice' had a splendid aroma and I wont tell you how it tasted but, I tell you just go and gorge on the food, you won't be disappointed. This fusion of south indian delicacies and rich mughlai 'khana' is surely going to bring me back to this place for a while now!
And definitely, there is a lot more space to brighten up the decor.
Keep up the good work! :)

I have been eating out every single day since I came back and its beginning to take a toll on my digestive abilities. Thus armed with an antacid made my way to one of my favourite places in the city , tamarind. If you think south Indian food means only idly dhosas,  come here. This is the best place for chettinad food that I know of in the city. Lovely d√©cor with Tanjore and Ravi Verma esq paintings adorning the wall. Love the copper tumblers they serve water in. You are greeted with a glass of cool spiced buttermilk. Rather extensive menu but my favourites are the stew and the meen curry followed by the chettinad chicken and coconut payesam for dessert.  I can live just on their appams . they have also started serving north Indian food but I haven't tried any yet. Prompt service and a comfortable environment makes this is a great place for lunch and for parties

great decor, great appitizers but does an overkill in main course.
Fish rava fry was awesome , so was the buttermilk. But the main course - we ordered one chicken and one muttion dish, appams and idiappams. Both chicken and mutton dishes were overdone with cocoanut cream , too rich killing any other flavour. Appams are fine but idiappams were again a disappointment - soaked in cocoanut milk , soggy dough like while idiappams should ideally be fluffy and light.
not recommended for someoneseekign authentic south indian.

My second visit to this place and I'm floored yet again! The ambience is like wwoowwwww! So themed and wooden. The staff is really cooperative. Now coming to the food. Yaayy for the complimentary drinks! We started off with Chicken tandoori which was delicious. In fact delicious would be really understating it. It was juicy and yummmmm (sorry, I got lost in the flavours)! For mains, with some assistance from the guy who was there to take our order, we went for Chicken Andhra Pulao and Chettinad Chicken. The pulao was spicy and tangy and was very well embraced by my taste buds. It had chunks of *melts-in-your-mouth* chicken which was so very pleasing. The Chettinad chicken was a Tamil delicacy which went really well with the pulao. Full marks for the taste! The complimentary meetha paan was such a game changer! All this for only 941 bucks. If you think it's a bit pricey, then trust me it's worth every penny! The portions were large too, because by the end of it all, I was STUFFED!! Amazing experience. Coming back again!

I went to tamarind to celebrate republic day this year. yes, I kid you not. Many of my friends swear by the south Indian delicacies that the place offered. However, being the meatarian bong that I am, I did not risk my night of celebration and settled for Mutton juganbadi sheekh, Bhuna gosht, and Mutton Biryani. (The husband was the reason for the over indulgence of mutton). To my utter joy everything that they served was a beauty to behold, both for my eyes and my tastebuds. The star of the night was the biryani. After ITC, this was the BEST biryani that I have tasted in a long time. The succulent mutton pieces seemed countless. The taste of biryani reflected the old awadi dum phukt style of cooking. Had the Mutton juganbadi sheekh kebabs not been so huge and filling, I would have eaten more biryani. aah nevermind. This gives me more reason for a next time. 

One might say that the rates are quite high. True. But for food that tastes so great (trust me the Biryani was mouth wateringly heavenly), one has to pay the price. The low light and the cozy ambiance is also a plus. Visit it on a special occasion. And I am sure you will not regret it.

We had visited this restro late at night during the peak Durga Pujo time! I remember ordering Kadhai chicken with Murgh Biryani & Paneer rajasthani with Green peas pulao.. Although a good number of days have passed by since I first went there, I think I still remember what the food tastes like! It was THAT good. Little over priced though! But given the overall experience, nobody would mind spending a few extra bucks actually! I can guarantee.

This restaurant was on my radar for quite some time as I had heard a lot of good rhings about it. I was a bit surprised when on a Friday evening there were only two families besides us. The interiors are beautifully done and the tables are nicely spaced out. However I found the inwards curving chairs a bit uncomfortable to sit on. Two tattered, separate menus for north and south indian food. The drinks were on a separate menu that had to be requested for not only by us but by the others who took the table next to ours. The portion sizes are great and the dishes were really tasty. The kebabs were well cooked and properly marinated. The gravies were  not oily at all. The naans were soft and fresh. Again, really big portions so quite the value for money too. 
I would definitely recommend this place for a nice family outing and I plan to come back here soon.

In the past, Tamarind had mostly disappointed me - from their Mango Pappu, to their Chicken 65 to their Kottu Paratha. I am not saying the food is bad, but it never nailed the 'authentic south Indian food' brief for me. 

To add to it, it wasn't ever cheap (a plate of lemon rice or tamarind rice - both humble south indian rice meals made out of very limited ingredients, now cost as much as 200 rupees + tax). 

Last night, hit by an incredible craving for Andhra food, I ordered (via swiggy) from this place after a really long time. Gutti Wangai kura which is basically brinjal tossed in onion and peanut gravy, came packed and hot to my house within about 20 minutes ( what a performance ! swiggy !). It was a good dish, but one that reminds of freshly ground peanut, tamarind and curry leaves based on a secret recipe right out of ammamma's grand vantillu ? No. The difference is as subtle as the missing punch and pungency of the sorshe bata coming out of my mom's kitchen, and one made in Jaipur in a standardised recipe Bengali restaurant. 

Still, I will give it a 4 rating for the food, because snobs seeking such subtle south indian pallette like me, wouldn't be their target customer base.  Tamarind has always served and as it turns out, continues to serve, mellowed down versions of South Indian Non-Vegetarian fare (lower on tamarind + curry leaves + coconut and not always cooked in coconut oil), to suit the local pallette and it has done a good job in helping a market transition from idli-dosa to appam-mutton stew. That's no less achievement for a restaurant - to introduce a new cuisine, popularise it and stick to it for a long time. 

However, a friendlier pricing could help a lot !

The place has a old world charm which was amplified by the beautiful artefacts & painting.. Although this place is famous for southern food but I had northern Indian cuisine there..This New year I went there for dinner with my family they welcomed us with a refreshing butter milk..we tried gosht biriyani,butter chicken & onion chilly cheese khulcha..Biriyani had a typical awadhi flavour & butter chicken was creamy & soft..we completed our meal on a sweet note with paan..

My 1st encounter/experience with Tamarind and its food was in Nalban food fest, later in many more food festivals in City center 1. Every time I tried their food I was more n more satisfied... Mutton Stew Appam, Chichen 65, Coorge Chicken, Fish Porichadu..
Finally on 25th August 2015,I managed to visit the restaurant with my friend . It was raining heavily outside,so we wanted to try something very hot n spicy as both of us were feverish due to monsoon. We were greeted with a Glass of Buttermilk tasted nice n fresh. Later we ordered-
1. Peethala Charu (Andhrara Crab Soup) [3.5/5 ] - Tangy n Spicy must say very very spicy.. I liked its taste but too much spice sometimes hits ur throat hard as I'm not very fond of spices.
2. Kori Amravati [4/5]- Recomended by the them..- was also very spicy But good in taste..
3. Mutton Stew [5/5]- Mutton pieces were soft n Juicy,
4. Appam [5/5] -Both r well made, perfectly complimenting the stew..
Portions r generous,Reasonable Prices, Staff r cordial.. If u r longing for a different food then Tamarind Must visit place..

Durga Puja scenes! Waited for 15 minutes and that got us a table for two. A decent warm environment, nice staff, good food is all about Tamarind. This brilliant place sadly loses all its customers to the bigger neighbour Oudh 1590. 
We ordered tandoori chicken for starters which was well cooked, tasted superb! Next, chicken reshmi butter masala, butter naan, mutton biriyani. The biriyani is prepared in the hyderabadi style which I do not kinda like. Its spicy and they put onion. However the reshmi butter masala won my heart (and stomach)! Butter naans were soft, perfect.

Costed around 1200 bucks for two. A must visit!

Friends if ur looking for authentic South Indian food then this is the place were u need to be.Decorated with a vintage look the appeal of the restaurant n its grandeur is amazing. I hv been to this place many a times n hv always lived up to my expectations. Even though they do hv a separate menu for North Indian food yet they are better known for their South Indian menu.You are always greated with a complementary curd milk shake with curry leaves which tastes amazing.We prefer Coorgi fried chicken for the starters.It is pieces of ftied chickens which tastes heavenly. We hv also ordered Hyderabadi biriyani which is a typical tangi biriyani a signature of hyderabadi biriyani. One plate is enough for two.Also we had ordered Chettinad chicken which is really tasty.Once we also ordered kodi kura which is a read hot, spicy gravy from Andhra pradesh.It is one of the most tasty platter on offer.And to end they offer saada paan to end.Service is very good, polite n knowledgeable. Expense is on the higher side but tey do offer exotic n authentic food.

Honestly speaking this restaurant look is good to dine as the ambience is very cosy and family friendly but my personal opinion on the food is a bit different as I experienced some non special differ from other places as the food was average and I did not enjoy the preparation it was made and I found nothing great for the way the items was heavily priced , with full confidence I can say I have eaten in better places with better ambiance in cheaper rates .

If you are looking for a place to dine well with your near and dear ones, then tamarind will be the best option. It is blessed with a calm yet happening ambience with awesome culinary. They have both South Indian and North Indian dishes , your taste buds are going to love them absolutely. They even served a home made wine ( which was Christmas special only ) which of course added flavours to our moods. Just go for it. You will enjoy awesome indian cuisine experience.

Saw the ad in the newspaper and decided that definitely going there today for Christmas lunch. It's been on my wish list for a long time as I regularly pass it whenever I travel down Lansdowne Road. The wooden pillars at the entrance give an indication to the decor inside...which is amazingly like a south Indian home with paintings and old style wood work. The table decor to is typically southern...with a bowl of flowers and chatai mats. They also serve water in old world style brass tumblers. Nice touch. 
The food too was very good. We had Kuzhi Paniyaram which was served with a tangy tomato relish. Paniyaram was soft inside and crispy outside....very tasty. One must definitely have this. Then we had appam with a Pacchakai stew ...both were too good. The stew was a mix of vegetables in coconut milk flavoured with whole spices,tho slightly sweet for my taste was still real tasty. It also reminded me of the stew my mom used to make.For dessert we had nolen gur icecrean which was good but overpriced. The restaurant won us over with their freebies...the masala chaas and the mitha pan they served after the meal. Overall a good experience...place worth going again. (they also have a separate menu for North Indians cuisine) which we might try another time

An excellent wholesome restaurant experience after a long time. We went here to celebrate my parents' 31st Wedding anniversary.¬†
Ambience: A soft, homely atmosphere, with the an excellent decor. It manages to be quiet, yet not so quiet that talking becomes awkward.
Service: 5 star service. The staff are brilliant, quiet and graceful. Always at the right place at the right time. When we ordered the starter, since my father is vegetarian, and he was not ordering any starter, they offered him complimentary Papad, an extremely thoughtful gesture.
Food: There is an extensive choice in both the South Indian and North Indian Menus. They offer complimentary buttermilk, which is delicious. We started with chicken malai kebab, which was a mixture of sweet and salty. We ordered Coriander Rice, Paneer Rajasthani, Lachha Paratha, Plain Nan, Butter Chicken and Veinchina Mamsam (lamb in tomato sauce). Each item was delicious. I would recommend the Coriander Rice and Veinchina Mamsam as these were succulent.¬†The whole experience was brilliant, and they offer value for money.

It's a place where you can expect somewhat 'very close-to-authentic' Malabar & Chettinad style cuisine.

The Malabar Paranthas are awesome here, and can go with wide array of dishes ranging from Kerala Stew to mixed veg curry or 'simbly' with Chicken Chettinad. 

Portions are good vis-a-vis price. 

Please don't limit your orders to typical Dosas/Idly/Vadas when you try this place...like we usually do when we step into a South Indian eating place - since this place offers one of the most wide range of Malabar, Konkani & Chettinad menus.

I really need to visit this place several times in near future to have a hang of the many dishes on offer...

Visited to get a quick dinner before catching up movie at Priya, got a table on a sat evening. Ambience was lovely, transported to different zone, tables, wall decor, lighting and seating spoke volumes of south indian flavours. Asked the waiter to give us suggestions of dishes that could be served really fast. So we tried Coorg chicken fry for starter, really great taste :) Next we ordered appapam to go with malabar chicken curry. Appapams to say the least were very soft and served hot with tasty chicken loads of coconut flavor. As we were in a hurry, didnt try a lot of their menu but we would visit again as it was good dining experience.

Tamarind is blessed with a wonderfully warm ambience. The trinkets along the staircase, the Ravi Verma-esque paintings inside, the straw mats all add up to a beautiful classical Indian setting.¬†

The complimentary butter milk was south Indian in flavor. Of course, I didn‚Äôt mind :) The tomato rasam soup was very hot to the tongue. Once it came down to the right temperature, I loved it. The Kannada style gobi kempu was super fiery, as it should be. This is not for the faint hearted. The paniyaram had the right color and crispiness, both key parameters for the dish. But it turned out to be too sweet for my liking. Main course was Andhra style pulao and raw mango pappu. Not sure if they took pity on my state, the pulao was subtly spiced to the point to being bland! The pappu was average, lacking the tangy complexity I was expecting. Dessert was double ka meetha which has become my go-to sweet dish of late. Man, was it good. 

I hear the Punjabi here is good as well. I‚Äôd love to return, even if to bask in its warmth.

You should think before you bring children with you toTamarind.
I often visited Tamarind and also celebrared many occasions here.But what happened 23rd November shocked me. I visited the restaurant during dinner time with my family and 3 yr old son.Being active in nature my son was running on the passage area. I found the manager scolding and shouting at him for no reason.He was just coming to and fro without touching a single object.after this another child of similar age joined my little one and they were doing nothing but roaming around a vacant table at one corner.the strangest part of the story is that all of a sudden a person sitting with his family far away from the toddlers shouted and callec those little ones as "INDECENT" -the manager came and told us that the children were indecent and we should control them.
I never ever in my life heard any person calling two innocent children who were doing nothing but playing without any disturbance as Indecent ( the word is itself very rude for a child).
The restaurant should then mention the age limit of people who can enter the restaurant. Shame on such management.I travelled all around the country and abroad but never saw such obnoxious behaviour.
So guys with active children should not visit Tamarind as thet might call your child indecent .

As the name suggests it has nothing to do with tamarind or it doesn't serve tamarind with food. The food served here are all in south indian style. The ambiance is beautiful. For starters I ordered Murg Yakhani Souo with prawns cutlet. The soup was not at all tasty. The cutlet was okay sort. Hard crust and bland inside. For main course I ordered Murg Shahi Korma and butter naan . The naan was soft and properly cooked. The chicken was cooked in cashewnut gravy which was lip smacking. Service was good but staffs need to be more courteous. A must try !!

South Indian food is more than idli n dosa. I wish I was introduced to the galore of wonderful spices of south India at an early age. But it really has to do with the presence of authentic South Indian cuisine elsewhere.. Every region specific spice from South  India has a story of its own.....whether it's the red peppers from Telicherry or the spicific spices blend of chettinand. Tamarind in Kolkata in a way is an introduction of that  spice story to the people of Cal.... The entrance is quite warm n inviting. They have tried to capture the South Indian flare  in everything from the table scape to dinnerware.... quite nicely done... To start of we ordered the Tandoori pomfret...perfectly flavored  n fish was certainly not overdone. Order two if you don't like to dig into the bones and the maatha like me....for entr√© we ordered Mamsam Kundu with appam. The appam was okay.., I have had better ones but it's  worth giving it a try. It is basically South Indian style curry n roti made of rice......Give this place a shot ....you won't be disappointed n if you happen to fall in love with the flavors, you will be hooked on the lovely South Indian flavors forever. I am so in love with it.....‚ù§Ô∏è

Tamarind is one of my all time favourites. I do not remember going to any other place in south Kolkata for a laid back lunch over the last few yrs. No specific item need a mention as all are more or less well prepared. Prawn & crab are value for money. The dishes do not taste as fiery as they look.

Tamarind is a nice cozy south Indian place in Kolkata. The prices are on the higher side compared to other south Indian places in the city.

The ambience of the place is fabulous.

We tried mostly malayali dishes here and it didn't feel malayali in nature, with extra thick masala flavours. 

The desert, tender coconut payasam however compensated for the draw back in the food to some extent

Heard name for a long time so been here @ Nabami night.. The place is just beside desopriyo park.. The hyderabad delicacy is beautifully decorated and while entering the restourant one can get delicious smell of north Indian dishes.. We have Butter Naan , Chicken Lababdar, Chiken Tikka masala, Hyderabadi Murg Biriyani. ..
Food prices were high like each item were aroud 375 to 450 bucks on an average. .But compared to this high price the quantity was below avarage.. They provided 5 pieces of chiken in chiken lababdar as well as in tikka masala...

Food taste :- Chiken lababdar is a must try. .. But butter naan was comparitevly thin and chiken tikka masala is a disaster... The chicken wasnt tandoored or grilled.. They were  jusy rather hard seems they were just taken out of fridge... Moreover chicken was similar to boneless Chilli Chicken pieces fried in cornflower rather than grilled or tandoored..

Staff were not at all providing the required services. . For example we have to ask 2-3 waiters for several time for water and tissues but no proper reply from them...


As a whole this place is just avarage and in food quality and price this is below avarage..

Went to this almost empty place on Saptami night. They were having a Hyderabadi special menu for pujo. Lots of items were available. For starters we had mutton boti kabab,coorg chicken,fish porichadu and kozhi soup. The soup didn't impress me much. Rest of the items tasted delicious... Specially the coorg chicken. They serve the food with chatni,salad and pickles. Loved the flavor of all the items. For main course we had Hyderabadi biryani,chicken tikka masala,nan,chicken hariyali masala. The biryani was very spicy. It was a pleasure to taste a biryani different from regular ones. The side dishes weren't anything extraordinary. Service was a bit slow. If you want to try some different items,this place is worth visiting.

Situated in d lane beside Deshapriya Park, this is a kind which i was searching for a long time.
We went there on dusshera evening. As usual, the place was surrounded by a moderate crowd. But we didnt have to wait much. The ambience was true to its royal tradition. They served us chanch as complimentary welcome drinks.
We ordered murgh hyderabadi biriyani, butter nan, murgh lababdar & murgh tikka. The biriyani was without the 'traditional kolkata aloo'. The quantity was not quite upto the expectations but its very heavy & rich. So, a blessing in disguise. Both the chicken dishes were royal in look as well as taste. The nan was so delicious it could be had just like that. Well, they could have margined down the price a bit. But the food really gets its worth.
The service was prompt & d waiters were polite & quite friendly.

This happens to be one of my favourite restaurants. One of the very few places to serve south indian food (and mind u, south indian does not mean idlis and dosas), tamarind goes easy on your pocket. Each time i go there i end up ordering mutton alisa-a wonderfuly hearty soup with melt-in-the-mouth chunks of mutton and a comforting peppery taste. I also love their dakshini yera-prawns fried to perfection. The appam and stew makes for a classic combo. We have never been disappointed with Tamarind's fare ever and recommend it to everybody whole heartedly

The restaurant was easy to locate along the main road. Though Desapriya was crammed of free space at "Panchami" but still we found our way out. Waiting for half an hour we got in, the wait was worth. The ambience was very good, brass tumblers were impressive. The service though was on the slower side. I went with my friends, ordered for main course, exhausted by the din and heat outside. Zafrani Pulao, Kulchas and Chicken Lababdar was what we ordered. The food was good and we enjoyed ourselves. Staff here were very friendly, looking forward for a visit again.

Visited it on Panchami,where all other restaurants had long never ending queue,we were lucky that here there was no such queue.The wooden decor was really classy.The seating arrangemenets were equally adequate.
Since we were exhausted after a tiring day of pandal hopping we just ordered Chicken 65.It was tasty,although i felt it would have been more great had the chickens been a tad softer.
Nevertheless,looking forward to visit it again.

The best place to have non vegetarian south indian food in Kolkata!! My husband is telegu and we both adore going here whenever we can.. The food is so good that we get busy eating instead of clicking pics of the dishes!! 
The food is yummy,fresh,piping hot and the staff is observant.. I love the decor and the brass utensils.   Every time we visit tamarind we come out as content and well fed humans

I am not very well acquainted with the cuisines of South India barring my exposure to modified Dosa and Vada. But I enjoyed eating here. I would probably go again if I were to try South Indian again. This time I had two Keralite preparations, one fish and another potato based, and it was good. The signature coconut and curry leaves are extremely notable on one's tongue and nose. If an individual is into experiments with tastes then this place should indeed be on the list.

Great keralite food.  Appam is what cones to your mind when u hear of keralite cuisine. Authentic keralite food. Appam and mutton stew are the best there. Many people are unaware of the fact that south Indian cuisine is not always idli and dosa. Their chicken ,mutton,prawn and pork dishes are the among the best in town.

This time we came here for a small pre puja trial dinner. This restaurant is good based on our past experience. We had hydrabadi chicken biryani, chicken chettinad ( my personal favourite) and mutton uppu kari. Uppu kari is the best mutton I had in recent past. Simply great, can't wait to try again. Very good ambiance is a plus.

Have visited Tamarind quite a few times before also but writing a review for the first time. I love south Indian non veg food... And this is probably the only one in that genre. So an all time favourite... Nowadays they are also serving typical north Indian fare also... But if you are visiting this place please try south Indian only... It's their speciality.
Location wise it's awesome... Just opposite deshapriya park.
Love their decor... Typically south Indian... And those sparkling copper glasses... Menu cards with Kanjeevaram panelling (though it's high time they changed the menu cards since most are in tatters)
Coming to this particular visit... Was there for lunch in between shopping... Tried kori sukka as starter... And they give butter milk as complementary welcome drink... Kori sukka is a chicken starter with lots of spices... A bit too spicy for my liking!!!
In main course had coriander rice...a nice accompaniment with the spicy south Indian side dishes. Side dish was veinchina mamsan (difficult name). It's a lamb dish... Again spicy but loved it.. And it was so well cooked. The lamb was melting in the mouth...
Dessert was my eternal favourite... Nolengurer icecream... A new addition and definitely not south Indian...
Will continue to visit to explore the full menu...

A nice and pleasant fooding experience in all
Went for a friend's birthday lunch with low expectations but to my surprise I felt content at the end. It is a Mainstream South Indian Restaurant with decent interiors and friendly staff, plus the ambience was quite calm and peaceful. I am not a south Indian food lover and I try to avoid it as much as I can but this restaurant certainly changed my perception and taste to a large extent. The authentic south indian dishes were light and tasty and I discovered some never heard or seen food before.

This restaurant has been on my list since a long time,finally had an opportunity today to experience the place....first words first.....I have never been to South India so I can't comment on the exact authenticity but I do know the common ingredients used in South India...thanks to Fox life..
Ambience:Great...pictures of South Indian Paintings..gorgeous decors..appropriate lighting and comfortable sitting arrangement...
Service:Waiters are polite and ready to help out with your choice and it was spot on...at least in our case
Food:Going into tamarind for North Indian is like asking Going to Punjab to taste Dhosa idli...so we stuck to South Indian...ordered Coorg Chicken(starter),Coriander rice,malabar chicken,eruchi mutton(main course)...food was super delicious with typical South Indian flavours...there was a complimentary welcome drink of buttermilk and pan at the end of meal
Price:Slightly on upper side but ambience and food makes up for it..
Just one complaint to management:Washroom needs proper maintenance...overall nice experience...looking forward to visit again...must who wants to try out new flav

This is simply a gem of a place. The cuisine served here is from the south of India but is a lot more than just dosas, utthapams and vadas. Specially for those who would like to experience non-vegetarian fare in south Indian cuisine (not easily available in the city otherwise). The Andhra Mutton Fry is a must try (and this is coming from someone who is not exactly much in to mutton!!) paired with appams. Add to it the Andhra Chicken pulao and Malabar Fish Curry and you are loaded with more than you can chew. On arrival one is served a welcome drink much in the nature of Chhaas or Ghol which was quite refereshing. The service is extremely good and the staff are very courteous. The decor of the place is tastefully done mostly in wood. I couldn't really manage to sample out the other items on the list for which I am already lining up another visit sometime soon. Proportions served are generous and does justice to the price. When I eat I don't do anything else so I don't have photos to upload. The ambience is very quaint and soothing. However, those who like to get tipsy will have to skip their drink for a great meal. Can't wait to pay another visit. Guys keep it up.

Visited this place on the day of Onam. It's because of the occasion this place was wrapped with subtle decorations of marigold flowers and lamps, giving the earthy and warm feel to the place.
It had special thali menu on that day. Hence we ordered the non-veg south Indian thali consisting almost everything. Starting with rasam, sambar, dal, chicken, mutton, prawn, bhetki and so on. The quantity of dishes didn't reduce the quality at all. The non-veg items were a standout. Not to forget the payasam and the amazing dessert in the end.
Don't know about the normal days but it was the best decision to go on Onam. Be it the ambience or the food, everything was top notch. So was the pocket pinch.
Loved it..!

I know Chef Kanan, South Indian Master Chef from his ITC sonar days. And over the years I have been dropping in here at-least once a month mostly alone for lunch, just to savour his delicacies. Some of the places in kolkata i just go for a relaxed hearty meal, i prefer visiting them alone :) tamarind is one such place. It has won numerous awards and i love the entrance and location. welcoming interiors, friendly hygienic staff and pocket friendly. The food is just awe some. They have a lot of options but the South Indian is the best. Start with Dakshin Yera, spicy prawns, cool it off with Appam, rice hoppers and masa stew, a light mutton curry with curry leaves and coconut. Simply Awesome! They also serve a refreshing buttermilk welcome drink and paan to finish off with.

Finding a good South Indian restaurant in Kolkata was difficult once, especially for someone who grew up in Mumbai and feasting at numerous Udipi 'hotels'. But with the Kolkatans changing tastebuds, there has been a number of good Southie eateries in the city. Now dosas, idlis and wadas can be eaten at many places, but I wanted to taste some authentic south Indian non vegetarian fare...That's how I came across Tamarind. We visited the place last Saturday for an early dinner...and let me say, I was blown away. The decor is great and very authentic, a very cosy-ish atmosphere...We ordered Kuzhi Paniyaram, Egg Appam, Coorgi Mutton Fry, Malabar Chicken Curry, Chemeen Curry and Elaneer Payasam....

I do not know what people expect, because I've been told that Tamarind lacks authenticity, the food is bland, etc....However, we LOVED IT! The food was the right amount of spicy, not bland at all. Delicately flavoured, the fragrance of coconut oil perfect and everything cooked to perfection. We loved the Paniyarams the most...Going back again for sure!

I visited this place for dinner today. The ambience is really classy and the service was good too. They welcomed us with complementary drink which was buttermilk. We ordered kori nairoast which was panfried chicken in ghee..later we ordered baghala bhat or curd rice. The quantity of the chicken dish was satisfactory however I feel the quantity of main course can be a little more. We wanted to have dessert but didn't quite find a suitable one. May be they could add few more options for dessert. All in all those who like to tase south indian cuisine other than idli dosa and uttapam, this place is a must try.. I am very very impressed.

I had wanted to have a full course South Indian veg at tamarind which would not have dosas and apams but never got the chance to do so.¬†
Went to tamarind with 5 other guests who are south Indians ¬†and had arrived from chennai yesterday morning. We started with the complementary chase and order masala papad to start with. The subsequently ordered dal,¬†Nigiri vegetable korma, chapati,Palkathi masala, biissibibela hunnana (a khichuri with different masalas). ¬†The food was far less tangy than what I had feared. The coconut aroma was also very well balanced. I can't stand the strong coconut oil smell or tamarking taste if it is overpowering. But the food at tamarind had just the subtle flavour different layers and a well balanced taste. We ended with gulabjamun and ice cream. The complementary pan was also a pleasant surprise. The decode of tamarind is good and the waiters are well trained. The guests from Chennai Too enjoyed the experience.

We went to Tamarind on a rain drenched evening along with some of my relatives, who are currently staying abroad and was not in a mood to go for anything remotely continental! We settled for a safe order - loads of chicken 65 as starter, followed by Hyderabadi Mutton Biryani, Erachi Curry, Malabar Chicken curry, Appam, Malabar parotta and Motta roast. All items were done to our satisfaction, portions were good and needless to say, we were not able to mop up everything! Tamarind was kind enough to pack them up for us. Nice evening spent, however, I would loved to have the parottas more crisp and the appams a little bit softer ... the complimentary butter milk and pan is definitely a nice gesture...

We visited tamarind last night for dinner. We had been looking forward to it for a few reasons. It's very beautifully decorated on the outside and so inviting. We love south Indian food. We had heard reviews and wanted to experience it.
The ambience is cosy and warm. The dim yet clever lighting is just what is needed in this restaurant where carefully selected art is used very tastefully. The seating is comfortable and not at all crowded. That ends the positive commentary on tamarind.
The food, God forbid, was desultory and pathetic! Yes, we are aware that folk south of the deccan plateau add a little acidity to their meals but to douse it with a vinegary sourness is plain unacceptable! We ordered the chicken 65 and crumb fried fish fry! While the fish fry was OK - the unfortunate bassa is to blame - the most inspid fish in my opinion. The chicken 65 was covered in desiccated coconut and fried curry leaves with so much vinegary sauce that my teeth were on edge. There was no other flavour that was discernible.
We moved on to the main course of crab dumplings and erachi mutton with appams. To be fair, appams are one of the toughest items to get right. Sadly, tamarind failed to deliver again. They were dry and roasted at the bottom. The customary soft, almost cushiony plumpness was missing at the centre- it was obviously cooked on a receptacle that was too hot!! The crab dumplings per se were OK but the curry was gluggy and sour! Having lived in madras for 7 years we know what to expect in terms of a southern taste! This curry was not it in any form- texture, taste or consistency. The meat pieces were soft but again the curry was just all wrong.
At the end we were forced to order the nolen gur ice cream- they can't go wrong with pabrais ice creams na!! We had to cleanse our palate from that insane sourness!
The worst was the bill... 3000/-!!! I'm OK to pay that amount if I get value for money. But this amount for 3 people who were served absolutely unacceptable food is thievery!!
Please go at your peril

Tamarind was earlier situated near Poddopukur farther down towards Minto Park and I had been a loyal customer ever since.Tamarind was a Rae breed,serving authentic South Indian dishes and allowed us the luxury of knowing a menu beyond Dosas and Idlis.However since they shifted to this new place I have found a gradual decline in quality especially the authenticity of taste.

Prawn starter,

Mutton pepper fry

Mutton stew

Tawa fish

Appams

Food was good but not great.Ive tasted fresher products here and request them to get back the 'tang' they were once famous for.......

A surprisingly light day at work, and me and hubby headed out from the courtpara for lunch. We stepped into Tamarind and decided to try out the South Indian non-vegetarian cuisine on offer. Immediately on being sitted, we were served complimentary glasses of buttermilk enhanced with curry leaves and other spices. We settled for Appam, Malabar Paratha, Mutton Stew and Chicken Chettinad for the meal. The Appam accompanied by mutton stew was a sheer delight, the coconut milk enhancing the taste of the stew like never before. The chicken and the paratha were pretty good too. The portions were big, much more than what we had in mind, and we both ended up being overfed. However, desserts were in order. While I settled for some butterscotch ice cream, hubby settled for the Elaner Payasam which was a coconut milk based porridge with shreds of buttery soft coconut in it, and was absolutely delicious. We were served complimentary paans after the hearty meal, and it was a great experience overall. Loved the experience. The service was pretty prompt. The waiters very courteous and on -their-toes. Would love to go back again.

Had been there few days back...the food is good and the ambience too is quite nice.We ordered the biriyani with a chicken side dish and paneer starter.Everything seems too perfect in taste.The chhach itself which is served as welcome drinks was just too tasty.I just got a stinky smell as I was entering into the restaurant which accompanied me for sometime in stair case and 2nd entrance.This may be because of rainy season but staffs need to take care of this otherwise everything seems perfect.

We went to Tamarind to celebrate my parent's anniversary and I was surprised at how beautiful this place is for a family dinner.
The decor of the place is tastefully done with a beautiful staircase leading to a all wooden interior with beautiful windows that remind you of houses in the south. as soon as we were seated , we were served a complimentary buttermilk drink. It was quite refreshing.
We ordered a chicken south Indian soup on coconut base ( I forget the name) and it turned out to be a great choice. It was creamy and full of delightful soft chicken. We followed it up with kebab platters from their north Indian menu and were surprised at how beautifully executed the kebabs were. All 4 varieties of chicken mutton and fish kebabs were perfectly done.
For the mains we ordered Hyderabadi mutton biryani and chicken chettinad. The biryani was nice and spicy with three big pieces of mutton in each. The chicken chettinad was beautiful too with just the right amount of spiciness and curry leaves. Our meal ended with complementary paan.
The service was prompt and with a smile always. Thumbs up to that. The quantity per dish is good and the pricing is also reasonable. 
A must visit.

This place is one of few places in kolkata where you get good food, great ambience,  courteous service along with great locational advantage. I am a die hard fan of their Kerala chilli pepper crab, paya ki nihari,  appam and mutton stew. It is the perfect mix of tastes,  and has become comfort food for me while dining out. The complementaRy buttermilk Chas is a perfect palate cleanser. For those with a sweet tooth, if you are visiting this place in winters, the nolen gurer ice cream is a complete delight....

This place gifted kolkata a new taste when it opened, before which south Indian food conjured up images of only idli, dosa and sambhar in the minds of most Kolkatans.
This happens to be a place which my entire family loves and hence have been there quite a few times. But each visit had one thing in common - the legendary coconut mutton. The seemingly simple dry mutton chunks will create mini explosions of flavours in your palate for sure.
Also, there wasn't a single thing in their menu which I tasted but didn't like. Try their Hyderabadi biriyani and coorg chicken, and you won't be disappointed. And their tangy meen moili (I guess that was the name) with plain rice is a must have too.

This the oldest place in the city where they serve proper south indian cuisine including non veg. I have been to this place several times and this time was disastrous. The quality of food and the service was highly disappointing. We were a group of 7 and we had a horrible experience. 2 starters that we called for took an hour to reach us. We wanted ice which was given to us after 4 reminders. The tomato rice served was cold. The only thing we complained about was the rotten prawns served to us, it smelled on being served onto the plate. I have no clue as to how the person cooking decided to serve it. The server took at back and checked it was smelly so we asked for a chicken cheytinad instead as that was the only dish we loved so far. The got us chicken dipped in the prawn gravy!! We luckily had some previous chicken left and asked them to compare it. They had no manager available, no one to talk to, the chef who came to our table did not know what we we were talking about. A pathetic experience, it's high time these restaurants need to understand not all people eat any crap you serve them, there are people in this city who can distinguish between good and rotten good and understand differences.

Although I like South Indian food, I'm not sure this place interprets South Indian the way I am familiar with. Negatives: seafood here seems to be of inferior quality because every time we have it, we have problems the next day. Positives: the breads and apams are wonderful. I like this one mutton dish, but I have forgotten what it's called. Will post that up next time I go.

The decor and food are awesome. The paintings depicting South Indian women add a nice charm to the place. As do the muted lighting and the spiced buttermilk they serve in earthen pots. The waiters are very helpful and courteous. They politely suggest what to order from the menu card. We ordered Malabar Chicken and Malabar Paratha which we enjoyed very much.

Rating:
Food :5/5
Decor : 4/5
Service: 4/5

Cons:
The washroom was not clean enough (a very important cleanliness criterion according to me). Also the bill they gave us was not clear. They left out the number of each dish ordered and the percentage of tax charged.

lovely spread of chicken, prawn, lamb and crab. Crab meat balls and Chettinad Chicken are my favourites. Buttermilk as complimentary starter beverage and cozy decor compel me to eat there and not order the food home.

While we were planning for dinner near deshapriya park this was the onli place which struk me among the list in the zomato app.
The ambience is very good with sliding doors. Well maintained and decorated place. Tables had bowl with rose petals. It is nice place. Waiters were very polite and helpful. We took mutton pepper fry which was really great.It was a bit spicy. Liked it. We also took aloo masala kulcha and lachcha paratha with butter chicken. Butter chicken was good. But i think the bread part could have been better for the price they are offering it. enjoyed the dinner.
Total was 949/-.a Must visit if u wanna try dishes with south indian touch.

Tamarind is the only fine dining restaurant serving South indian delicacies in Kollata. Located bang on Deshapriya park,Tamarind boasts a good location as well as an authentic traditional ambience. Coming to the food,they have a mix of all South indian cuisines viz coorg,mangalore,chettinad,hyderabad and kerala. The taste is above average.. nothing extraordinary. Prices are steep. Service is good no doubt. One can visit if they like south indian food

Tamrind is a typical fine dining restaurant, with variety from authentic south indian to not so authentic north Indian. We ordered for a south Indian starter, which disappointed us with its too much black pepper flavour. It's north Indian was good but not anything exceptional. For the ambience I felt it calm and pleasing. Overall an average restaurant

Visited the restaurant and ordered for fish ajwaini tikka, fish achari tikka, fish niharika and zafrani pulao and to conclude it with double ka meetha. The fish ajwani tikka and achari tikka was awesome and really like the simple concept of double ka meetha. Ambiance was very good, spacious and neatly decorated. Looking forward to visit the joint and try out their southern delicacy.

What more can a father ask for ... looking forward to going there.A little bit pricey ... some offers for a family meal would be a welcome addition as I live on the other end of the city and have to burn gallons to get there. Overall nice.

Last Sunday was my first visit to Tamarind. I remember being turned off by the place before as I heard them to be serving ¬†chicken dosa. Anyways after going through the reviews here I dismissed the myth and decided to try the appam and chicken stew.
Well the food was very average to my taste. The appams were slightly burnt and the chicken stew had a nutty flavour (not cashew gravy).
I ordered a pineapple mocktail with khus syrup and it tasted ok.
However I find Ammini way better with regard to the Kerala cuisine.

Strolling around for good South Indian food and with a unsatisfied taste bud with regards to Deccan Cuisine we went to try this restaurant. We stepped in with a great expectation and came out with the question "Why did not we try this earlier!!!!".  We tried a starter, a main course chicken side dish and obviously "APPAM". Food was awesome. Just liked the tangy and spicy taste of the dishes. Lastly we had the Eleanor Payasam as dessert which melted down the spices through throat. Just one suggestion can the persons serving be a bit more informative, so that they can suggest the correct combination when asked. Else you rock!!!!! Keep serving the good food. Will be back soon.......Cheers!

My friend has been talking about this place for a quite a long time.. He insisted that we should go there and have South Indian cuisine..Now honestly, South Indian food only reminds me of idli, dosa and its various kinds. Though reluctant, I decided to try out this place.

We were served with a complimentary butter milk which was pretty good .

We ordered the following items:
¬†
# Mutton Alisa soup
# Coriander Rice
# Mutton Uppu Kari

After getting bored of ¬†the Chinese style soups at every other joint, this was surely a welcome change. The soup was made from a base of coconut milk thickened with crushed wheat ¬†and cubes of mutton. I think there were other spices and herbs as well , not sure what though , but it definitely tasted different .The Coriander Rice was nothing like I had ever before, what lovely flavour! The Mutton Uppu Kari was an absolute delight, the mutton was tender, with rich flavours and the perfect blend of the spices.
Overall, had a wonderful experience here. The decor is nice and soothing for the eyes, has an earthy touch to it. The staff is courteous , infact they helped us in ordering the food. Would love to visit again :)

This has been for very long time the only non vegetarian south Indian restaurant in Kolkata. This restaurant holds a very fond memory as I used to see this everyday on my way to school.I even saw this restaurant being shifted up ahead the sarat bose road and then again back to its original location.

Coming to the food.It is authentic and absolutely delicious.We had ordered appam and mutton stew,idiappam,malabar prawns and malabari paratha.Everything was finger licking good and decent quantities.Two of us me and my mom could only finish half and packed the rest.I especially can't forget the soft idiappams with sweet coconut milk.....yum!!! 

And I would like to mention the amazing time I spent there with my mother with lovely food.Keep up the standards.

P.S.- its a little expensive but totally worth it.

Everything happens for a good reason and boy, was I glad when my grandparents wanted to celebrate their anniversary here. I wanted to go to this place again coz I hadn't visited it in a long while and as soon as I climbed up the stairs, checking out how I looked in a mirror hung on the wall... I found a nice little pic hung which read... Zomato User's Choice Award 2013. With a smiling face, I entered the right side sitting area. The only complaint I had was that the AC that evening wasn't working which they said was due to a servicing problem recently. But the issue was quickly solved and we were back to being jolly. The decorations inside are stunning esp the paintings hung and the flower ikebanas on the tables.
The raised dias was where we usually ate before but it was full that evening.
Well... coming to food. We were 8 people (including 2 six-year olds) and we simply couldn't decide what to have and what not. We ended up having a bit of North and large portions of South Indian.
Well one of the best things was the refreshing welcome drink which is made with curd and various spices. It was a life-saver on that hot day!
Dishes tried : Malabar chicken- just the smell makes you drop dead! A li'l bowl of heaven.
Paneer tikka masala. Paneer malai.
Ambat- a dal that will make anyone's day.
Beans' poriyal- they say, the simpler, the better. Absolutely delicious.
With all that we ate paratha and rice for the kids.
The payassam left such an impression that can't be forgotten easily.
The paan they give you at the end makes you ask for some more.
We did!
A great place worth many a visits with your family, friends and lived ones.
Clears the concept that South Indian isn't only dosa, uttapam, idly etc.
ENJOY!!

Visited this Place About a Year Ago , So My reviews would be based totally on what I felt that time visited . Quality may or may not have changed as of now .

So , I visited this place with my Friends for a Birthday Treat . Easy to Find the Decors and Ambience is good . Quality of staff and service very good but this place is too much hyped and over rated for no reason . The North Indian Cuisines is nothing to be impressed . The taste is as good as Sher e Punjab or any Mid Range Dhaba so as their other dishes but their Pricing is way too much as if they are serving some exquisite foods . If you have way too much money that you want to spend do visit here .

A visit to this place and you would understand that South Indian food is so much more than masala dosa and idli vada.. I ordered a Russian salad to start with which was dressed with quite a bit of mayo, tasty nontheless.. Two Malabari Parathas and the famous Chicken Chettinad was my main course, and the chicken was soft and flavourful, just with the right amount of spicy... No space was left for desserts, but the meal left quite an impression... Definitely worthy of another visit..

Place you might end up over eating! Truly Delectable.

One of those where you would like to keep going for good food & the south Indian Non veg cuisine.¬†
So I had ordered for Egg Appam ( thought 2 would be enough for me) with Chicken stew in coconut curry . Couldnt resist & ate 7 Appams. Later ordered for Mutton Haleem as well. Do not expect like you get here on the streets or other mughal joints. I found it similar to the Andhra style , the one you get at Pista House in Hyderabad or Kakori House in Mumbai. All that matters is the taste cuz, which one is authentic is really difficult to judge.

Got the taste for South Indian Cuisine, you cant miss this one.¬†Would love to explore all listed in the Menue.. Yummyinmytummy!

It's been ages since I've been here, but this is one of the old favourites from my school days, when I would pop in with my parents after tuition in Rashbehari. First thing you need to know about this place is, it specializes in South Indian cuisine. Second thing you need to know is, they don't serve dosa. At least I've never seen anyone order it. It's focus is on South Indian non-veg, which in itself carves out a separate niche for this place.¬†Our staples here would be Coorg Chicken Fry, Kori Bempu Bezule and the Hyderabadi Mutton Biryani. The Biryani here is bound to be the best Hyderabadi biryani you'll find anywhere in the city, since anyway Kolkata biryani is influenced more by Awadh than the south. The Coorg Chicken Fry was revelation. Spicy, slightly burnt and smoky, this was something you would not expect from south Indian cuisine. Kori Bempu Bezule is a new addition to the menu. The chicken was tender, the spices were incredible, it completely changed my idea of what South Indian food should be like.¬†Their takeout or delivery menu is even more extensive and has a number of interesting choices, including the Chef's Special Square meal Chicken, which has 12 pieces of different kebabs.¬†Ambiance, Food, Service, it gets a 4 across the board.

Dropped in for dinner here this evening. The place is very tastefully decorated with wooden furniture and illustrations. We opted for the South Indian menu and ordered mushroom chettinad, malabar chicken, Malabar paratha and coriander rice. The food was served very fast and was steaming hot. The mushroom was excellent, the chicken was very smooth. The Coriander rice was a meal in itself.  In fact we found we couldn't finish all the rich preparations and had to request for a parcel. The staff were courteous, fast and helpful. We got complementary buttermilk at the beginning of the meal and paan at the end. The only thing missing was some evocative music.

Had been to this place to celebrate our 5th marriage anniversary.. This was our second visit.. I loved the ambience bt unfortunately this time while we were having our dinner we found that two families were enjoying their dinner without paying attention to the kids.. the kids were running here and there making so much noise and as the flooring was wooden it was  really disturbing and annoying..and the surprising part was their parents were enjoying it.so we requested the manager to tell the parents to stop it. Every parent must know it isnt a good practice to allow your child to disturb in public place( the comment was for the parents not the children)..when they were leaving they were shouting on the manager which was again indecent...the food was delicious but cudnt enjoy it..the manager was supportive he understood the problem and co operated with us. So take your kids with you but dont allow dem to disturb others.

Tamarind is a unique place where you can savor some unique south indian dishes that are not idly and dosas. Have visited this place thrice earlier and have loved the food always. However, recently we found the food to be a bit downer. Had ordered Appams, Malabari Paratha, Salan and Hyderabadi Veg Biryani. They serve a glass of Butter Milk in the beginning as appetizer. However, it serves it's purpose only if it is served chilled and not warm as it was served to us.
The Biriyani was again on the oily side, but the Salan was well made. Both appam and paratha were passable, but not awesome as they used to be earlier.
Probably was one of the bad days for Tamarind, being Sunday evening rush. Hopefully it was a one off day for them and would pull up their socks . Would not like to see them deteriorate in quality further.

Ok. So this was the 1st time I was going for an all out dinner to a full blown South Indian eatery whoch doesnt serve Dhosa !!!
My Ma was awestruck.... How can a south Indian restaurant not serve dhosa. My sister was heartbroken because that was the only thing south indian that her tongue could afford. But me being a food explorer, cajoled everyone to enjoy for a day something alien to our taste. 
Prawn 65 wasnt alien. We really enjoyed as it was closer to our kind. Then there was Kodi Amaravathi which was a deep fried oily chicken and was not distant either. Malabar Paratha was again closer home as it tasted similar to Laccha Paratha with a difference ! The staff recommended Kothu Paratha which was like a Paratha cooked like a curry in onion and Tomato and it was pretty well made and tasty and a complete main course in itself.
The mutton that we ordered was a bit too distant from north and well into the coconut zone, the tongues didnot approve much of it, only my brain could appreciate the goodnesa that a coconut oil lover might feel.
The ambience was typical south with no unnecessary extravagance and on the minimalist side.

Last weekend we took our daughter to lunch here. The boys didn't want to go. Our daughter is a foodie and it is a delight to take her to different gustatory treats. The decor is nice, the sitting very comfortable, ergonomically correct, the lighting balanced. The paintings and photographs adorning the walls are very comforting- women in traditional attire at work in traditional kitchens. There were some voluptuous portraits of women in toilette also which our daughter did not approve of :) The cuisine is very very good and the experience fulfilling. We had a mixed non veg platter. The kebabs- fish, mutton, chicken, prawn- delightful! Soft, fragrant, completely satisfying. This was followed by steamed rice and dum methi prawn. Beeeeautiful!! Aromatic, just right- not too strong, not too mild, not too hot, not too spicy- just right. With a dash of lemon juice, it set off the taste even more. I think the appetite was set with the welcome drink of butter milk. The palate cleansed and ready for the gastronomic safari to follow. The kebab should have a yoghurt masala dip. The dessert of payasam with rice and tender coconut in a sickly sweet milk reduction. It also had crunchy fried cashew nuts in it. Very nice, could have been a little less sweet though. The food was completely decadent and satiating. The waiters can be trained to be more helpful, knowledgeable and courteous. The steward/maitre de or whatever, a South Indian by accent, was helpful and accommodating. So the management may train its subordinate staff better. Overall a good and authentic food experience.

Tamarind has earned a unique place for itself by serving delicious and uncoventional Non veg South Indian dishes to the foodies of kolkata..from their decor to their menu,everything has been designed keeping in mind the rich culture of the southern part of our nation..From my experience I can vouch that all their dishes are prepared with utmost care and precision..when it comes to south indian cuisine its mainly the interesting assortment of varied spices from the land of spices itself..The servers are very courteous though seemed a bit inexoerience..Coming to food they also serve some delectable North Indian dishes as well..I tasted the following itrems during my last visit:They serve u a complementary spicy welcome drink based on dahi..
Coorg Chicken: Their signature starter..sift,tender morsels of chicken,a bit spicy though but you got to love the taste..
Fish Ajwaini Tikka: Loved the combination of carom seeds with fish..
Appam with Mutton Stew: Famous Delicacy from kerala..however I felt the appam a bit stiff,had tasted more crisp and soft appam in kerala itself..mutton stew was delicately prepared..loved the aroma..
Hyderabadi Mutton Biriyani: It was super spicy,literally had tears in my eyes..tasted a bit unconventional for a taste bud habituated to kolkata biriyani..
Butter Chicken: The sweetness of this completed with the hotness of the biriyani..loved the creamy texture..chicken cooked well..
Nolen Gurer Icecream: Actually it tasted better than I expected..the small granules of nalen gur in the icecream elevated its taste..
Oevrall our total cheque comes to Rs.3000/- for five of us..So definitely prices are a bit upward but given the quality of the spread and the dining experience the money was worth of it..
Food: 4.5/5
Pricing: 3.5/5
Service: 3.5/5
Ambiance: 5/5

Came to know about this fabulous restaurant through Zomato... though I had passed by it quite a few times and thought it to be one of those "Idly Dosa" places. I was WRONG and how... We had Coorg Chicken Fry which is one of their specialties..It was really tasty... n I should specially mention the quantity.. in fact each and every dish of this place was sumptuous... The Hyderabadi Chicken Biriyani was equally impressive. They served us the welcome Chaas which sets the tone perfectly.. Overall the restaurant is an unique and a delightful experience which I would suggest everyone to have.

Have been planning to drop into tamarind ever since I have heard praises about their south indian delicacies. To introduce myself , South indian food and koninika de are two poles apart. I do not know, how people even eat idli and dosa the whole life. But when I heard there is non vegetarian south indian food. I just couldn't wait. And finally on sunday, a friend and me decided to have our dinner there. When we entered it was around 7 30 pm. What attracted me was the amazing decor of wood, which made it look so typically a south indian house. The bull head at the gateway, the wooden couch, the paintings all added to a serene environment. Since it was too early for dinner, the restro was quite empty and we could our place. The amazing south indian motiffs, the amazing curios, the mat work on the table just paved my way towards the heart. Their complimentary appam was out of the world and water in the bronze glasses tasted superb. The staffs although a bit unaware of the menu, appeared real courteous.  Since my friend goes no where beyond chicken, so chicken had to be our call. I loved the design of the menu card, all south indian classical dance and music images made me all proud of my rich culture.we chose the coorg chicken. The manager said,  this was possibly a great choice for the starters. The chicken arrived. It was soft, tasty, succulent, well marinated with a skin which tasted amazing. I believe this is one of the best starters I have had in my life. I wanted more and more of it. Since it was too much in quantity, we were semi filled by now. So decided on the main course. It was malabar chicken and kothu paratha. And the manager praised me for my choice again. Kothu paratha is basic paratha shredded and prepared with scrambled egg,  tomatoes n curry patta. It was innovative and amazing. However the best of the lot was malabar chicken. I believe coconut milk and poppy seeds is a deadly combo which can enhance the taste of anything and this malabar chicken tasted heavenly. What demotivated me was there limited options in the dessert section.  So we planned to skip it as we were full till the neck by now. The best part? The best way to end the meal, an amazingly tasty paan. Bill was quite decent as compared to the quality of food they serve. Definitely a thumbs up to tamarind, u make me fall in love with south indian food.  Am really looking forward to drop on soon.

I was beguiled by the name. I expected it to be an upmarket south indian speciality restuarant. Though I do not dig southern cuisine, I very occassionly feel like having a sada dosa or an upma and nothing beyond that. Nevertheless me and wifey decided to visit this place on poila boisak evening for a change. The decor was pleasant and uncongested. 

I was pleasantly surprised to find a large selection of north indian dishes on the menu. In matters of food, my wife is more adventurous than me so she decided to try a mutton biriyani.  I generally tend to stick to non-spicy items unless I am sure of the fieryness of the chef - so I ordered a mutton stew (kerala style) and appams. The service was courteous and reasonably fast. The portions that arrived was sumptuous by any standards. 

The STEW was excellent. The mutton was soft and succulent, the coconut milk based gravy was siky and creamy with the right hint of spices, just the way they make in "Gods own Country". What floored me was the latent flavour of fried onions and that lent a full body to the gravy. 

The BIRIYANI was more of the Bombay style - not the Hyderabadi type, dry and spicy with a touch of sourness with two pieces of decent succulent mutton pieces.  

Overall an excellent visit.  Recomended but be careful with your orders - the portions served are impressive.

I am not a fan of the traditional South Indian, I will admit at the onset. However the non vegetarian options at this place warrant a different response from me.

This place offers both North and South Indian dishes, however it is known for its South Indian fare. We had ordered massa stew, another spicy mutton dish(the first one in its menu under mutton), and a chicken 65. The starter was okay, not like the chicken 65s that I have tasted earlier, however not bad either. The massa stew was excellent, light creamy and the mutton was very soft and of good quality. The spicy mutton dish was a bit too spicy for us even though the waiter had assured us that it was medium spicy.

However, all together, the meal was tasty and we had to pack both the left overs of the mutton dishes owing to the generous helpings.

The welcome drink was also a plus point. However one of the air conditioners was not working and resulted in a number of irate customers (coupled with the spicy food!)

On 2nd. April 2015, 8.10 PM , we reached at Tamarind, after nearly 5 yrs. and hearty Dinner. I took pleasure to shower all praising words on Chef Mr. Kannan. Also added that Qty. at reasonable price. 
        Appam was not so soft, bit stiff. Malabar Chkn., Tandoor Pomfret, Coorg Chicken, Bhetki Fish Malabar Curry - all are finger licking and portion was very adequate for we 3, Even the Pan( Betel Leaves) was beyond any words to describe. Service & ambience was more than excellent .
     Few months before Y/D'ter from USA asked me to have lunch with her very close family friend also from USA. I strongly recmndd. ForTamarind. They thanked me after lunch. 
        Cons.  Their stairs, this only was about to have fatality b'coz they have no Hand Rail & Light for this poor 71 yrs. old with weak lower Limbs. Even the Guard on duty was watching but not helped me. I almost lost my breath. 
        On 3rd. April '15., Morng I've narrated in details to Mr.Khan, Mngr. Showed not much of  interest. 
          Now, next time I may not be able to have Tasty food.

After reading the amazing reviews. Was excited to try out this place which many claim serves authentic south indian food. and having lived in bangalore for 8 years have been having craving for authentic food and was thoroughly disappointed. Let me start with the pros. Good decor. Prompt staff. Food wise. The buttermilk in the beginning. And the paan at the end which are both complimentary. Also the appam which was beautifully made
Now for the cons. The food is not AUTHENTIC. far far far from it. The chicken 65 tasted like it was chicken pakoda with tandoori masala in it. The chettinad chicken spicy but not the right taste. The gongura prawn also a disappointment. Now the rice items. The lemon rice was average. But ive tasted much better and authentic taste in banana leaf and at a much cheaper rate. The same goes for the bissibele bhath. 
Overall not at all a place i would ever go again for "south indian" food. And the people who call the food here the "most authentic" south Indian restaurant in kolkata. Really need to once visit southern india and taste the food there. Because the food while taste wise average and not bad. Is in no way authentic in taste. Next time will save myself the trouble and the expense and go to banana leaf which genuinely serves authentic south indian food. In good variety. And much affordable rates.

Tamarind is a place where you will find a very different menu which includes non veg south Indian food. They also serve north Indian delicacies and being a fan of kebabs I ordered north Indian food. The decor is classy with wooden chair which gives the place a very elegent look. We took a kebab which was decorated with puffy egg whites, butter chicken and nun. The food was decent. They served us a drink in the beginning which tasted a little sour as well as spicy (chilli) and in the end they served pan. Service was swift and good.

A perfect place to try south Indian non veg delicacies. The ambiance is good and also has wooden bench to sit and eat. The quality is good and if for any reason you find the food improper or undercooked the whole platter is replaceable. The price is a bit high though but it goes well with the quality.

The mighty place for the authentic southern cuisine - that's how one describes Tamarind; it still manages to live up to that praise to a fair extent. This place will definitely seduce your taste buds with its variety of platters, intrigue you with its sober decoration, if you have never been there before.
Food here used to be the only authentic representative from the tawa of our southern friends. With many restaurants popping up on city streets every fortnight and claiming to be unique in some aspect or the other, this kingly den is surely facing its competitors these days. But that hasn't affected those mouth-watering dishes they serve. The last time we were there, we had Meen Bezule and Kodi Veppudu in starters and both were just too good! Especially the fish in Bezule was well made and came with a very good taste. The only thing that brought a little apprehension was the use of red sauce in the curry - at least that's what I feel they put in it, cause the curry had a taste similar to those popular spicey Chinese dishes. That was not bad surely, but why should such a taste govern a 'Mangalorian' item, is out of my league.
For main course, I think you will do the best thing if you go for a very light platter of bread or rice with some spicey side dishes. Appam with Chicken Chettinad is a winner! The chicken has a slight coconut flavour and that makes it oh-so-delicious! Give it a try if you are in need of a quick choice. 
The service is really good, though you may sometime need to ask them constantly for subsequent serving or ordering. But generally they are very cordial and ready-to-help.
The one sure thing that you will definitely be in awe with is the interior of this place! I can not describe the sheer awesomeness of that elegant yet simple earthly decor and nor i want to at all. Be there yourself, have a food-date and it may be an experience you shall cherish forever.

Well ! Loads of great reviews about this place got my expectations real high, but to my utter dismay Tamarind completely blew it!

I visited Tamarind on a Sunday evening for dinner with my folks(3 of us), booked a table in advance however upon reaching around 8:40 we had ample seating options to choose from.
The interior is appropriately decked up to match the whole South-Indian homely theme, but didn't feel too crispy clean as we had to keep asking the waiters to change our mat/spoon.. plus there was this bowl of dry wilted flowers in the center of the table ! :(

Looking beyond all that, moving on to the food :

For starters we ordered : Coorg Mutton Fry(8 boneless pieces)¬†and Meen Bezule(7 fish pieces)
The fish was served hot,crisp with a coating of batter and then pan-fried which was decent, but the next item had lots of hiccups before correctly reaching our table.
Instead of mutton, first they brought chicken,the staff self realized took it back and brought our actual dish sometime later but with a piece of paneer.
Upon showing they took that one piece back to the kitchen and brought us 4 more pieces of mutton with absolutely no salt :-/ but by then we are tired of complaining.

Main Course : We ordered Meen Kozambu with Appam and a Hyderabadi Mutton Biriyani
The kozambu was a thick gravy, tasted very average and so was the so-called biriyani.
I don't know why do they have to coat every item mutton/fish and then pan fry/put in a sauce ! It ruins the texture and shifts the focus from the freshness n taste of main ingredient itself !!
The only good thing was the soft and fluffy Appams among all the items.
Oh wait, i forgot the complimentary Buttermilk we started with and the sweet coconut Paan they served at the end ¬†! That was our 2nd best items of the night. :-/

Now, to wrap up this long sad review i'd like to mention that the portions were Good.We had to parcel and bring the biriyani home. Food was cooked, Thankfully. and the staff was courteous.

However, after having lived in Southern states for over 5 years spanning over 3 states i can't make myself call tonight's fare tasty/close to the actuals in any way. Not sure if there quality of this place has deteriorated over the time or, its been this way all along but i ain't visiting Tamarind again !

Full on 5 to Tamarind !! People think South Indian food means Idly, Dosa, Sambar and Vada what else? Some even turn their mouth to their sides when they hear about South Indian outlets... If you are one of them I would request you to get into this joint and gorge on some super delicious non veg south indi food. One may try out¬†

Mutton Alisa Soup
For Starter: Coorg Mutton / Chicken, Mutton / Chicken Coconut Fry
For Gravy: Mutton / Chicken Stew, Malabar Chicken / Mutton, Chettinad Chicken
For Bread: Kothu Paratha, Bakhrakhani, Appams
For Rice: Kai Kari Pulao

Hope you guys enjoy your food this time around without hesitating whether to get into a south indi eatery of this kind or not... Service is excellent but definitely a pocket pinch but who minds it if your quench is satisfied!!

South Indian food for most means idli/dosa. But someone having that perception should visit Tamarind to have a change in his perception.
Me and my husband once decided to have something from south indian cuisine which is not that conventional for all. We therefore visited Tamarind. We were given a buttermilk as a welcome drink.
We ordered Coorg Chicken fry as starter. It had a taste of cloves and cardamom and tasted good. Next we ordered Malabar paratha, Lemon rice and Chettinad chicken. The lemon rice had ample amount of fried nuts in it which I didnot like. The malabar paratha was also stiff and I didnot find it tasty. Chettinad chicken was good. I didnot quite like the place although the decor, service and ambiance ¬†was really good. I found the place a little overpriced and the menu items probably didnot quite suit my taste buds.

Well..after seeing all the reviews of this place i decided to go there on lunch with my mother. 
Starting with the decor, i would say it is amazing. That south indian decor and wooden planks make u feel different. 
Next, the staff, very cordial and kind.
And then, food. I ordered for Mirch aloo ka salan and masala aloo kulcha. The kulcha was tasty and nicely made. Mirch aloo ka salan was good too. It had spices in it which  made it taste better. 
Then..we ordered for Hyderabadi chicken biriyani and Chicken Chettinad. And i loved the food. 
I was so full that i couldn't order anything more for deserts. 
And something worth mentioning is their complimentary serving of butter milk in the beginning and mishti paan with coconut filling at the end. 
My bill inclusive of vat was around 1140/- which was absolutely fine with me. 
Overall.. A nice place to be at for a perfect luncheon or dinner..

But when we asked very reluctantly brought it...he was hell bent thtt the order should be placed in the next 5 mins or we will not get food.. While we were ordering we heard the manager screaming at waiter...that why did you entertain them..you should have kicked them out...
We just told them to pack our food and we left...
They  spoiled our mood and lunch...pathetic service and staff ,pathetic food and i don't know what should i say about the manager or the owner whoever it was...if you treat your customers like this very soon you will be selling masala tea on the streets....please friends just avoid joints like this one

Tamarind is a unique restaurant and a genuine attempt of the South Indians to occupy a prime spot in the heart of the city, and bringing out a fantastic platter of non-vegetarian dishes before the fish-loving Bengali. 

All the dishes are carefully chosen, choosing the best dishes with care from every South Indian state. Mind you, most are high in the spice meter, so you need to pass on a special request to the chef. Also, for booking, I recommend you call up in advance before arriving. 

Dishes - I loved their soups, but can't recall the exact dish name. But among the other dishes, my favourite is a dish called Mamsam Kundu (kundu?) which is a mutton preparation from Andhra/Telengana. Among chicken, you can try the Kori Kampu Bezule and of course the Chicken Chettinad. If you are for crabs, you can't go wrong with the Chilly Crab from Kerala. 

Price is on the higher side but I guess it's okay given the location and the uniqueness it brings along.

Tamarind is a nice place to eat out with a small group of friends or with your family. They have 2 separate menu cards for their North Indian and South Indian food, which I think is very smart. I have been there twice and both the times, being home food (read South Indian food) deprived soul, did not care looking at their North Indian menu.

The place is very earthy and beautifully lit. The ACs at the end was a bummer with molds all around it but apart from that it is a pretty decent place to eat.

The food is really good. I have always ordered their Chicken Kothu Parotta . It is tasty, hot and is sufficient for a person. I found their Chicken Fry to be too hot that it over rode the other spices. The Meen Porichadhu was also good but did not blow us away. Appams are supposed to be stiff and crunchy around the edges but this one was soft all over, maybe because they had pre cooked it. The coconut milk was good and sweet. The Panniyarums were done well. Pualos/RIce dishes are good in general from my experience there. 

The service is decent and fairly quick. They serve buttermilk upon arrival which is a nice touch. The waiters help us customize the dishes which is very helpful as was in the case of my Chicken Kothu Parotta. 

Overall a very good South Indian experience that I will recommend to all.

Tamarind , located at a stone‚Äôs throw from Deshapriya Park crossing , is definitely a leader in creating authentic south Indian non-vegetarian food. I am amazed at the quality which can easily rival south Indian food from ITC Sonar or Hyatt Regency.

The decor and ambience is so very thoughtful , it inspires to look through and understand the menu as well. Chairs and the sofas resemble the old school Konkani furniture and it creates the perfect backdrop for a sumptuous dining experience.

Guess the element of surprise lies in the fact that we , the people of Kolkata always equate south Indian food with dosas,idlis and vadas , whereas , Tamarind serves dishes which are completely different in taste and variety.

Though , I expected rasam instead of buttermilk as the starter drink , the chicken 65 and coorg chicken just blew my mind. Crisp chicken , marinated with coriander and fried in curry leaves was an awesome treat.

For main course we ordered bissebele rice , chicken chettinad , appams and hyderabadi biryani. The thick and tangy sauce with a strong chilly , whole mustard and curry leaves left a lasting taste in the mouth.

It is remarkable to find a south Indian restaurant not serving dosas and politely suggesting appams as an alternative ! ! 

Tamarind is definitely a treat to food lovers of Kolkata. Only suggestion is to remove the canned north Indian menu and focus on the tremendous job they are doing on the south Indian spread !

Super happy ! !

Before visiting this place I didn't know that South Indians actually eat non veg. I was surprised to see non veg in this south indian restaurant. The food is awesome specially non veg items. Coorg fried chicken is best as starter. Kothu paratha is a different item. Aleppy fish curry was not a dish I liked much. Appam and Massa (mutton) stew was fabulous. New year special welcome drink (homemade wine) was too good. They repeated it happily after requesting.

Best authentic South Indian food in Kolkata. Their quality of food has been the same since so many years. Since few years they have introduced North Indian food as well. My favourite is the mulligatawny soup. It's lip smackingly good. Try the mushroom pepper fry, coorg paneer , chicken chettinad. Finger licking good food. If you like spicy food tamarind is definitely the right restaurant for you. I definitely recommend it.

Visited the place on 27th December with my brother.
Ambience-cosy and warm with south indian artifacts ,paitings,upholsteries ,exudes a homeliness.Washroom needs cleanliness
Service-Fast and attentive .we were very exhausted after a long search for another shop and were glad for their quick refills of our glasses.
Food -Started off with their complimentary buttermilk.It was fiery hot and chilled.Despite the cold weather loved it.
For starter we ordered a Bangla Dumpa Vepudu-baby potatoes tempred in garlic and chillies.A slightly charred flavouring that was its USP.A profusion of strong spices typical of andhra cuisine.
We followed it with 2 plates of appams and a kai kari peratal which was a mix vegetable cooked in chettinad spices.The appams were not fluffy ,rather stiff.The mixed vegetables included some spices like whole cardamoms which im not fond of in vegetable dishes but ive had them at other south Indian stews too so that is the ususal preparation.
Finally a double ka meetha -a kind of bread pudding ,that just looked so perfect and melted in the mouth leaving a sweet after taste .The prefect end to the dinner.
Hope to try other dishes as they have quite a few non dosa idli offerings that are not served at other south Indian places.

I have been there in New Year's Eve, 2014. Let me tell you, Tamarind breaks my stereotyped believe about South Indian food. 
A welcome traditional curd based drink worked as a icebreaker. We had Tandoori Sikari Duck in starters. They have created a magic with their exotic spices. 
In main course, it was coriander rice with a duck roast. The aroma of coriander and the kajus created a perfect combination with exotic duck roast. It was ended with traditional pan. 
Last but not least, the hospitality of the
 employees and the decorations of the wall created an illusion of South India

We ordered for South Indian food, they have enough variety for non vegetarians and vegetarians. 
The welcome drink chass or buttermilk is nice though it's but spicy for my liking. 
We ordered some appams , rasam and veg chettinand and an egg paratha tossed alongwith onions and tomato and spices. 
The chettinand was awesome alongwith appam and I thoroughly enjoyed
Rasam was ok but the egg paratha was a pleasant surprise, never had such a dish. 
It was not like the normal egg stuffed paratha but It was tossed up and scrambled like an egg bhurji, the taste was outstanding 
The service is good, if u happen to be in Kolkata and want to have South Indian food other than idli Dosa or utappam then this is the place to be.

I have to admit that Tamarind is one of THE BEST South Indian Restaurants in town. Simultaneously, I also hate to admit that we only had the opportunity to dine in this restaurant last Sunday when we had attended a family gathering hosted there.

Having stayed in Bangalore for more than 9 years, we've developed a liking and weakness for a particular few dishes from down South, a couple of them being Chicken 65, Coorg Fried Chicken, Bissibele Bath, Hyderabadi Biryani, etc.¬†

We absolutely loved the Coorg Chicken Fry they served. The soups were awesome with just the correct balance of tanginess and zing.

The service was very decent and the captain was very helpful with suggestions and recommendations. a must visit for people who love South Indian food.

Really very offended with the food quality. As the Review states its more than 4 in Zomato but is really worth negative rating. Ordered for Lunch Delivery to Sec- 5 Office, all the food were just not at all worthy eating.
We ordered Cheese Naan, Cheese Malai Kofta and Makai Malai Seekh Kabab all these states to have cheese but that only exists in the name...not in reality.

My other colleagues had Prawn, Mutton & Kashmiri Pulao, Jeera Rice and Dal Fry. The mutton was like rubber literally and all the pulao and rice tasted same as felt like only peas & vegetables were added from top. And it was a Client lunch, so had a very embarrassing situation.. :(

Really very dis-satisfactory. Will never suggest anybody ever.

This is my first time to Tamarind and my motivation for zeroing on Tamarind is primarily because of it's myriad array of both North and South Indian cuisine. Paneer Rajasthani, Alugedde Roast and Butter naan. The Paneer Rajasthani swirled in creamy malai is perfect for somebody who wants to steer away from pungent spice attack. However, for somebody who wants the gravy to explode in the tongue Alugedde Roast ( Traditional potato curry of Karnataka) bathed in tamarind, chickpeas, mustard and curry leaves is the go-to option.

The complimentary buttermilk is a good initiative especially for tired shoppers of Gariahaat.

The interior reverberates with traditional South Indian vibes right from the bronze utensils to paintings on the wall.

go visit the place to tickle your taste bud with flavours from two ends of the nation.

Its one of the theme restro I had seen till now. Special attractions is the complimentary 'coconut milk' or 'chanch' served to every visitor. Extremely hygienic atmosphere with complete wooden furniture's & oil paintings proclaimed all over the walls. Waiters are good and specially the manager is humble enough. Go for the mughal dish cooked in south Indian style. Last time we tired Hyderabadi biriyani and kodi vepuddu . The quantity is enough for three people(depends). Its one of the best biriyani I had. Entirely different taste with aromatic spices so was the chicken having heavenly taste in every bite. Rasam chawal was also a good light dish . First time I went there , it was a special occasion & choosing tamarind was really worth it .!!!

Tamarind- a restaurant i am planning to revisit due to its wonderful and amazing food. The place has a real grand entry and in the hallway you will find the awards that they have received for serving great south indian dishes with a twist. Mind you this is not a typical dosa idly joint. Its way more than that as you can try their Andhra/chettinad dishes. However the place maintains both north and south menu, even their menu cards are very dramatic. You need to visit to experience it. The place is usually packed so if you intend to go you have to make reservations.

We were welcomed to our seats with their complimentary welcome drink- buttermilk which i loved and wish they had added it on their menu.Then we went on to order prawn tandoori as starter from their north menu and they were just superb. Huge,juicy,well cooked with the right amount of spices. Brilliant in one word. Then we tried their south indian menu and ordered appams and mutton (mamsum kundu). Both were great, not very spicy and to be honest for a change was very delightfully different. Not the usual spices or taste. The appams were fluffy and light. Honestly i am not a big fan of appams due to the tangy flavour, however the best was their coconut payasam. I have never had such dessert before. It had the malai and was not touturously sweet. Just perfect. I would suggest everyone to try them.¬†

The hospitality was great so was the ambiance . Well decorated and the price was reasonable too. The kind of food they serve as per that i would say their tariffs are competitive. 

I will be going again to try their other south dishes.

kodi vepuddu is a local choice along with typical chicken malai kebab and kakori kebab...both are awesome...they also serve a complimentary drink which was err i dint like much...the main course can comprise of a brilliant kashmiri pulao and kadai chicken...one can try items like missi roti , makai ki roti and tamarind rice or lemon rice with bharta...all r very good and quite different...finish it off with nalen gurer ice cream or kulfi falooda...
the food is one of the best, the ambience awesome, the cutlery and staff r very traditional and service is at par...wud love to visit this place again n again...

Some days back during the Deepavali, I had decided to visit a popular eatery in Deshpriyapark and found that to be crowded and I was put into the waiting list of 45. That means, my chance would come after 44 people had been done away with after those sitting inside already.

This put my off big time and then decided to go to some other place while I accidentally discovered this place. I then decided to try out this restaurent which serves mainly Andhra and Karnataka cusines.

I was having trouble deciding on the menu while the server suggested a deepavali special Thali which comes with both the Veg and the Non veg option and I opted for the non veg one.

There were some seven items all total, starting with the South Indian speciality Butter Milk and ending with a pair of Paan.

In between were South Indian Pulav made from Basmati rice, then a Prawn item and seven chicken items with a Mangalorean Fish Item and ending on a sweet note with a cup of Sweet Halwa and Salted Payasam

It was very good and tastey, which serves fully the worth of Rs 525 + Tax

Wat nonsense. Claims to be one of best south Indian place in town but does very little to even justify the claim partially. On top of that the prices are very high and u don't even enjoy the desertz. Probably the only place in kolkata where they can bambozle you even with deserts. If u wanna spend some peaceful time with your friends or family this is the last place you would wanna go. Try it at you own Risk.

My tryst with non-veg south indian food started at Malgudi,Chennai and continued with Tamarind. Awesome food and great ambience.  One of my favourite is the Coorg Chicken Fry which is the 1st thing I order everytime I go there. Then there is the delicious mutton stew, malabar chicken, chicken chettinad which goes best with the appam. Also one cannot miss out the iddiappam served along with the rabdi.

Tamarind , I visited last Saturday after almost 3 years . The orders were simple as we were 2 of us , 2 appam,  1 coriander rice , 1 chicken chettinad Nd 1 malabar prawn.  The prawns were cooked to perfection and the taste was super . Went very well with the appam . The rice and the chicken combination was out of the world and the aroma of the spices is still fresh to me . Overall a kick ass experience in terms of cooking . But on the service front they need to be little more careful and needs some training .

Recently got some takeaway from this restaurant Tamarind, which specializes in North and South Indian cuisines. The location is just opposite to Desapriya Park on Sarat Bose Road.

For the food, I took their special veg. thali which is available for limited time and two other non-veg gravies, one chicken and one mutton. Thali comes with Palak Paneer, Dal, Sabji, Pulao, Lacha Paratha and Gulab Jamun. An appam was also given with the thali. Taste of every preparation was very good including those non-veg preparations.

Never really been inside the restaurant so can't tell much about decor and ambiance but as I could make out, the space was really small and much cramped inside. They also have a banquet hall which is not so good as I have heard.

TAMARIND: another restaurant located on Sarat Bose road in South Kolkata which has slowly but surely developed in to a gastronomic hub. 
The decor and the interior is good to my taste. Though the seating arrangement could have been better. 
We visited them during the Durga puja with the Awadhi food festival going on. 
Tried quiet a few imaginative dishes as I love new dishes on my table. 
I loved their jhilmil kebab which was on offer. It was minced mutton rolled by chicken. Its tasty and definitely with cheese and butter thrown in it. Have it hot and u will love it. 
Next up would be the crab meat soup. It was spicy. I would rather not call it a soup as it felt very much like a crab curry. The amount of chilly and tamarind provided in it made it quite a mouthful. Enjoy this at your own risk. 
The Awadhi biryani was the worst I have ever tasted any where. 
We even tried the cheese appaam and to my surprise it was not up to the mark as well. 
To sum it up lets get on with the price per quantity and I felt it was costly. If they offer food at that price point then definitely it should justify either with quality or with the taste. But none was there. 
My personal experience of tamarind to stand out of the crowd is not fulfilled. Probably the weakest restaurant on the new food hub of Kolkata.

Went to visit the place during Puja.Must say that though there was the puja rush,the management was really praiseworthy..So for this even at 11.30pm of Astomi we just waited for half an hour.
Now lets talk about the food.We ordered gosht biriyani,chicken malai kabab,mutton rara,garlic butter naan&cold drinks.
The biriyani gave an out of the world experience,the malai kabab is also a must try as it just melted in the mouth.The best for me was mutton rara which was spicy tender&so tasty that it kept me licking my finger.
Only point of disappointment was I did not get the chutni with the Kabab.
The ambience of restaurent was also fab.&it does not give a big bite to your pocket.
Loved it,hope to visit it again.

This is one of the best places in the city to sample authentic Andhra cuisine. For two people, we ordered the Coorg mutton fry, one plate of kothu paratha and kodi chicken. I have not had such succulent and spicy meat in a long, long time. Loved the ambience and the service. The portions are really good, and value for money. In fact we had to pack the leftover meat and carry it home. The buttermilk and the paan are complimentary, and they really contribute to the entire experience. Would love to go visit again to sample some of their vegetarian fares with their famous appams!

Presenting a new dimension to south Indian cuisine is tamarind. It makes an attempt to introduce kolkatans to a newer side of south indian food and especially non veg to boot. I must say it makes a successful endeavour. We had a lovely dinner where we had ordered coorg chicken as a starter, malabar prawn curry, malabar paratha along with two lovely mocktails named lovedale lake and coromandel cocktail. The food had a very different flavour to it which was yummy as well as refreshing. Even the drinks were a good change from the usual .The decor of the place reminds you of a quintessential south indian house and the staff is efficient. In all an absolute try!!!

Was there with my wife yesterday and I would say it was a new dimension to South Indian cuisine. When you mention south indian all that comes to mind is idli and dosa. What we fail to realise is that it is much more and Tamarind offers that

We ordered a Coorg Chicken for starters which was nice, soft and with a subtle taste. So if you dont like strong flavours do try this. For main course we had Malabar Prawns and Malabar Paratha.. The Prawns are another recommendation. For drinks we orders Lovedale Lake (Strawberry flavoured drink) and Corramondal Cocktail (Coconut Juice with honey and lemon juice-recommended)¬†

For desert we had a double ka mithai which was south indian version of shahi tukda. Ambience is good, service is decent and food is great. Definately worth a visit.

Though noticed this place a lot of time while crossing deshopriya park, it was during puja I got a chance to visit the place ... Overall it has a south Indian feel.We ordered fish tikka, bhuna ghost, chicken tikka masaka. The fish starters were though not that great but when we moved to the main course it was nice .. The mutton and  chicken preparations were  Nice and juicy with thick gravy.
If you like tangy south Indian taste this can be a good place to dine.

There are good restaurants, there are better restaurants and then there are restaurants that belong to the IVY league. Tamarind can definitely be counted in the Ivy League. Be it their hospitality, be it the decor, be it the ambience or be it the food, everything here is top notch, classy. And now the cuisine they serve, make them stand out from the crowd.¬†

They mainly serve delectable South-Indian non-veg dishes. For most us, South Indian food is confined to ¬†Idli, Dosa, Sambar, Bada, Uttapam etc. But the non-veg south Indian platter is also equally tempting. But restaurants serving such dishes are rare to find in Kolkata. Tamarind has tactfully tapped this opportunity to give us foodies a chance to gorge into their offerings.¬†
Let me try to give an unbiased overview of this place :¬†

Ambiance===>>>>> The interior is very nicely decked up. it is charming and soothing and as well as classy and elegant.

Hospitality===>>>>> Their ¬†warm hospitality is very very praise-worthy. A glass of butter milk they offer before the food comes, acts as a good filler. Staffs are very attentive and cordial.¬†

Food===>>>> The food is finger-licking good. Especially the Coorg Chicken fry, Hyedrabadi Biriyani and Elaner Payasam are ¬†brilliantly prepared dishes.
The soft juicy chicken pieces of Coorg Chicken Fry, blended with different spices bears the smell of cardamom and cloves that is hard to miss.¬†

Price===>>>> Cost for two is mentioned in zomato as 800, but for a decent meal for two, it costs at least 1000. They have revised the menu and their prices (may be due to the festive season).

If you are in Kolkata and looking for a place to taste authentic South-Indian food then Tamarind is the place. You can taste authentic Chettinad , Hyderabadi, Malabari, Andhra , Udipi and Coog dishes here.

You can taste authentic Mulugatwanny soup to start with, Iddiappam , appam or malabari paratha here.
You can savour Coog Pepper Chicken and finish your meal with authentic Hyderabadi sweet Double ka Meetha.

A great place to dine out with family or even have a party.

Tamarind is probably the best south Indian joint in kolkata. They have modest interior decor, nothing fancy. Some ppl may find the chairs a lil uncomfortable... Now the Hyderabadi biryani is too good. Malabar parathas paired with chettinad chicken is out of the world. Not a great place for vegetarians though ..  The veg menu is a lil limited I d say coz no fancy items there... Just a few kinds of kurmas etc.
Dessert - tender coconut payasam is yummmm..the best ...slurpp... So are a few other items. I d recommend this place for all those ppl looking for sm spicy n aromatic south Indian food experience!

Recently I happened to be in deshapriya park area. I knew of this place but never visited. I was alone during lunch hours and I just dashed in this place.

As you enter the,place you will feel as if you are in south indian place with beautiful architecture.

This south indian place doesn't offer you dosa, idli, vada which most north Indians consider it the only south indian dishes.

This place one cab get chettinad's cuisine and many non veg south indian preparations.

Since alone I didn't go for many things, the waiter said me to take bisi bela huli anna bhaat. Now this is a south indian khichdi with south indian style tadka of curry leaves and rai. I was not really looking forward to have it but being alone in a restaurant you are hardly left with much choices if there are no,combo meals to offer.

But to my surprise this bisi bela bhaat was the best I ever had. The best means perfect in all sense.

Here you get complimentary tadka butter milk or in north India there is a dish called sanaata(very similar to it), but amazing specially with bisi bela bhaat. Quantity is good. Here you also get fried chilies filled with salt(a rarity in restaurents) complimentary. Do not forget to enjoy food without it.

A bit costly place but such a delicious south indian food here needs a tip of admiration.

The moment you walk into the restaurant..what will strike you the most is the authentic traditional interior with plush furnishings.There is an old world aroma about the place even though they plate quite modern specimens of dishes.
The free buttermilk will set your mood to a tangy start and you will soon be asking for more.Be sure to try out their special hydrabadi biriyani..an assortment of several spices and mint along with soft juicy chunks of boneless meat.
The chicken 64 is sure a real winner.If you are looking at trying out something different and "not-the usual-boring" stuff..order large puffy "appams"...a different take on dosas..and mutton stew...The gravy tastes spectacular ,complimented by coconut milk.But one downer is the mutton haleem which has way too much oil in it and fails to conquer the "mughali"ana....But overall the experience left me quite satisfied and happy.I can't wait to go back there.
PS:The prices are in the upscale..But the quality of service and food makes up for it..

it was my first visit in tamarind,and i must say everything is very adorable out here,the nicely decorated seating arrangements to the concept of badam milk,using brass plates glases,with a tang of our very own culture amidst of all other decoratins.and to mention,the menu is so well decorated,with both type of sari indicating towards north and south india.
north indian menu had beautifully paced.
south indian section is with the very famous pics of subbulaksmi,ghatam,its gives a sesnse of feeling your own culture and you are half satisfied before u taste any of its delicacies.¬†
i tasted chicken chettinad- very good indeed.
hydrabadi biriyani- another riot of flavors,cardamom,curry leaves are so well mixed with typical flavors of biriyani,unexpected.
nun- as usual,soft and went well with chicken.
¬†WHAT I ENJOYED THE MOST THE SMELL AND TASTE OF ALL THE FLAVORS MIXED SO WELL. these COSTAL PREPARATIONS are REALLY EXCELLENT.

had been here twice before for lunch - a touch of dignity & the gentile south-Indian decorum had always been pleasing to me. but one has to be here either for lunch or dinner. and the inconvenience is you have nowhere to sit if you reach the place before 7.15pm. however, it's warm and inviting inside with simple wooden decor. one good thing is they maintain two separate menu books - one south Indian & the other of north - has a vast range of items and most remarkably they are available.¬†
earlier we mostly had lemon rice, coorge mutton (dry), some side dishes and desserts. (i prefer here south-Indians to the north-Indian dishes cause i expect something different here) & so far i have not been disappointed. but this rainy evening when we (me & one of my friend) happened to revisit the place for dinner. i went for some offbeat cuisines - some unusual keralian chilly-sour mutton dish.(forgot the name- newly added) and Zafrani pulao from the north section. but on the staff's recommendation i took butter nun and makai roti along with zafrani pulao to play safe (as it goes well with typical south Indian flavor) he further advised me not to take that dish and take Hyderabady mutton side dish. he saved me by refraining me from taking those - suggesting that tamarind rice would be too tangy, the other side dishes (which i chose would be too chilly and raw) ¬†and while the jafrani rice would be sweeter as honey (too much for me & contradictory). one thing when you are paying around 500 bucks for a single side dish, you must be expecting it to be exclusively unique - but that was not found unfortunately.though it was tasty. the prices were raised & a bit costly. so one must be wise with selection. for me the staffs were very genial & well informed also.

Though the appams I have at Swagath in Delhi is a bit more softer and tastier. Overall, I had a very nice experience. Will definitely recommend this place to all. Total bill came to about Rs. 1100.

TAMARIND was my maiden tryst with non-vegetarian south indian food as before that all I knew about the foods of southern province  was idly dosa  ,sambar et al ! I have been to this place for quite a few times and each time I just wanted that complimentary chas to arrive ÔÅä  The  COORG CHICKEN FRY , MUTTON COCONUT FRY  tastes all the more divine with the humble APPAMS ‚Ä¶ and their HYDERABADI BIRIYANI is one the best that I have had in the city . I have to add that the mridangams and tamburas of the Carnatic music that lingers in the typical southern wooden interiors enhances the experience all the more . A must try for l the Kolkatans who still feels that south indian food and idly are synonymo

Location: Deshapriya Park. 

This place serves both North Indian and South Indian cuisines. The ambiance here is such that it could leave one simply mesmerized. It is simple, yet calms your mind. 
The Menu Books are quite interesting, One depicting a South Indian Saree on it's cover and the other, a Saree from North India which itself imply what's to follow in the pages of that Menu Book. 
While you take time deciding over what's to be ordered, a complimentary glass of buttermilk would be served to you which actually taste great, leaving you wanting for more, but, sorry just one helping of the same is the rule. 
Having tried both the cuisines, I'll sum it up.

What made the taste buds happy? 

North Indian: Paneer Ajwaini Tikka, Hara Bhara Kebab, Paneer Rajasthani, Dal Makhani, Diwani Handi, Pudina Paratha, Onion Chilli Cheese Kulcha. 

South Indian: Coorg Paneer, Mushroom Pepper Fry, Kothmiri Paneer, Avial, Bakharkhani, Lemon Rice, Elaner South Indian: Coorg Paneer, Mushroom Pepper Fry, Kothmiri Paneer, Avial, Bakharkhani, Lemon Rice, Elaner Payasam. 

What made the taste buds sad? 

North Indian: Khumb Makhana Masala, Makai Malai Seekh. 

South Indian: Babycorn Fritters, Alugedde Roast.¬† 

(May be a bad day when these were ordered, service lapses are provisioned) 

What made us happy? 
Quick service, Courteous & Well-informed Staff.¬† 

What made us sad? 
Nothing as yet. 

Overall has always been a great experience. :)
-Revisiting soon to check on the service lapses and definitely to enjoy the tasty food!

Love to eat here. If you want to spend some quality time with quality food, you can visit this place with your family. If you are used to with smoking sizzlers in a food court,  this place is not for you.

A pretty nice restaurant to begin with.  I went there after some rave reviews from my peers and colleagues. 
In a place where everything South Indian food refers to is Idli, Dosa and Uttapam, this is one of the very few restaurants which serve authentic South Indian non-veg. The food was delicious. Before visiting we were pretty unsure about the order but after careful consultation of the reviews by my Zomato mates, we zeroed in on Coorg Chicken Fry, Chettinad Chicken, Malabar Paratha, Kulcha and Double ka Meetha. The quality is awesome and a strange observation is that this is the first time that I felt so many distinct taste in a single dish. It seemed as if it distinctly contained the flavors of each pf the ingredients that has been mixed with it.
The ambiance was very good and of course a special mention should be made for the complementary welcome drink and the hospitality. Its exceptional. The waiters here are too good. you wouldn't even have to ask for water as they will keep a track to see whether you have emptied your glass.
The dessert was a bit disappointing to me.I ordered it due to a strange sense of nostalgia as it reminded me of my trip to Hyderabad a few years back where I had this dish for the very first time. An anxiety was working inside me and expectations were building as to check whether this double ka Meetha is in fact that good. Well I was a bit disappointed but none the less it was good.
After all the rave comments from my side the only sore point is the pocket pinch. It kind of leaves hole in your pocket. A single small Malabar Paratha costs Rs. 80. This is the only reason that I deducted the 1 mark from the 5.

Last evening, i took my partner for a surprise date and chose this place. Tamarind was on our wishlist for a long time and this first visit have taken the breath away from us.
The location is very convenient. We reached around 7:30 and though there were people already, still quite empty. I must mention that while we were leaving after dinner around 9:15, there was a huge queue of people waiting. So it is advisable to make a reservation if you are going for a late dinner on a Sunday or a holiday.
 The hall in which we settled down was very nicely decorated, with a big mirror, wooden floor, wood curving on the walls. The table was also very nicely set up... with zari-bordered mats and bronze flower pots. The serve water in bronze glasses too :D
The ambiance is quite nice , only some unnecessarily balloons here  and there really spoils the decor.
The service was prompt, served us with the complimentary buttermilk as soon as we settled down. The buttermilk tasted wonderful with the spices.
We were there to enjoy the southern flavors, so we set aside the north-Indian menu. My partner wanted to taste dishes from each different state so we ordered Coorg Chicken Fry for starter, Mutton Uppu Kari and Allepey Fish Curry along with Appam and Bakhar Khani Roti for the main course. The Coorg chicken tasted good, marinde was different and distinctly coriander, quite a good quantity and on the heavier side.  The Bakhar Khani Roti is a sweet paratha with dry fruits peeking out; tasted nice but did not quite go with the curries ( the waiter had suggested so, but we had insisted on tasting this ). The appam really brought out the flavors of the dishes. One plate appam consists of two appams. The Allepey Fish Curry was spicy and had raw mangoes. Fish tasted fresh, big chunks, the mangoes and red chillies were a perfect refreshing combination for the coconut based gravy. The mutton was spicier and had a rich tomato taste. The meat was tender, very well cooked and went perfectly with the gravy. The quantities they serve is quite sufficient and we were too full for dessert.
The bill came at Rs 1547, quite happy to pay for the wonderful food that they served.Each dish was unique, tasted distinct and the combinations worked out really well.
 If you want to taste good food, especially southern dishes apart from dosas and uttapams, this is  the place to be. We will be going back for sure!!

Kolkata is a luckier place than Delhi simply because it has Tamarind. If I had some superpower then I will get Tamarind in Delhi. A delight for people who love eating Non-vegetarian food with South Indian flavors and ingredients. The ambience of the place is calm, beautiful and minimalistic. (They have a separate North-Indian section also and I have never been there.)

Must haves: 

1)	Coorgi paneer or Coorgi chicken
2)	Mumsam Kundu ‚Äì mutton with South Indian spices and red chilli. 
3)	Chicken Chettinad with Appam 
4)	Bhagare baingan with Malabar parantha 
5)	Hyderabadi Mutton biryani. 
6)	Dessert: Double ka Meetha

USP (S): 

1)	Their buttermilk (which is awesome) is complementary. Though only once.
2)	Each dish tastes distinct. 
3)	Their staff understands the food and explains well. 

This place makes you really happy. The dishes are priced very well and the portions are good. Tree at the entrance is well lit up and makes the restaurant easy to spot. 

A meal for two costs Rs 800-1000 approximately. 

There is no food like Tamarind food.

Writing a review ain't quite an easy nut to crack.... specially when its your first. Visited this place last Wednesday with my Girlfriend as she is very fond of south indian cuisine.Well let me tell you that though I am a foodie but South Indian non veg cuisine isn't quite my thing.This thing has now become  a past tense as I am completely floored by Tamarind.Floored by their cooking,hospitality and their presentation and orientation.

AMBIANCE--- The eatery is at a prime location....just a stone's throw away from Deshapriya Park Crossing towards Manohar Pukur Road.The ambiance surely scores 5/5....CLASSY is the word...The decor is catchy and the overall appearance is neat and subtle... What actually got me is that they did not try to overdo the things but kept it simple yet classy.

SERVICE--- The waiters were polite and the service was prompt.

FOOD---- Coming to the main part, the first thing that comes to my mind when I think of the food there is "WOW!". They give you a complementary chaas first which i found quite good. We ordered Chakori Kebab, Kodi Koora and steamed rice.

The kebab was way tastier than it appeared...chicken pieces juicy,succulent and tandoored to perfection and the chutney that came alongside complemented the kebab perfectly. This had my tastebuds longing for more.

Chicken Kodi Koora is a preparation in a red gravy carrying the tangy flavour of tomatoes along with garlic pieces. This was one of the best chicken preps I ever had. Superbly cooked, my dish looked as if there wasn't anything on it in the first place. This went absolutely perfectly with the steamed rice. The quantity of food was more than sufficient and was way beyond satisfactory. At the end of the meal they gave away a complementary paan made in south indian style with grated coconuts inside that had interesting flavors.
Pocket pinch was about 1270 bucks and the place was absolutely VFM.
Looking forward to coming to this joint soon again. The joint that has developed in me a liking for South Indian non veg cuisine.

It is a great place... After being seated they serve you this yummy chaas which I have yet to identify all the ingredients. Both their south Indian and north Indian cuisines are to die for. Among southern delicacies, chettinad chicken and meen mouli deserve special mention. Their naan can beat any others hands down in softness. The kababs are succulent. It is not heavy on the pocket and the service is fast too. They also offer you complimentary paan after you finish up. Definitely it is a place to go...

Me & my wife were looking for some spicy southern non-veg delight's in Kolkata, some searches' n reviews lead to Tamarind.
The place is located close to my house, well connected in the southern part of the city.
The ambience n the decor is quite neat, and minute details to give that southern touch. Quite amicable. 
Now the food, even though Tamarind does have a northern menu, like many others we chose not to look at it.
The complimentary welcome drink, a sort of 'chas' was quite soothing n tasty. Refreshing in the summer heat.
We started with the Mangalorian style chicken Fry. Soft tender chicken pieces with a thin coating of mangalorian spices, served with a slice of lime n some salad. Perfectly spiced, red, spicy however not too hot. 
Then the famous combo of appam and mutton stew. One of the best i could possibly ask for. The rich creamy coconut based stew is smooth. The white gravy is well made with chopped onions, garlic n ginger. Even though it had some sliced green chillies, my wife thought some more of it was needed to suite her taste buds. 
We then moved on to some Andhra style pulao with prawns. Again perfect, the smell, aroma n exactly the same way its served in the south, with onion curry leaves based raita n the curry. Thoroughly tasty n did bring back fond memories of me enjoying this pulao in Chennai as a child.
Finally the dessert - Payassum. This one is unlike the one regularly available, this is made of tender coconut n sweet coconut based milk with cashews. With the sweet tooth that i have, this was an awesome end to our southern delights.
Pocket pinch is about Rs. 1500 for two (quite decent).
I am definitely going back and would recommend everyone looking to try out something different.

I visited Tamarind say around 4-5 years back when Zomato was not known to anybody. So was waiting to go back here to write a proper review based on current experience of  dining  there.  And I was pleased once more. This is a restaurant for foodies who have different taste buds. "South Indian Non Veg" if this makes  you go wondering then TAMARIND is a must visit for you. They also have a Tandoor - North Indian Section to cater different conventional taste buds but it is of no use to me since i believe in speciality.
We started with Mulligatwany soup- which is a lentil soup served here with a south Indian twist. Outstanding starter dishes are Mutton Pepper Fry, Coorg Chicken Fry & Royyala Veppudu ( Prawn preparation). I liked the mutton so much that I have decided to go back to have only this along with Malabar Parathas. The main course had Appam & chicken stew - a classical preparation out here. We also tried Malabar Parathas with Allepy Fish cuury. This was a turn down since the fish gravy was tooooooooo sour for even me , who loves her food to be tangy & spicy. I suggest you have parathas with Malabar/ Chettinad chicken which I had here long before. We ended with Elaner Payasam- not the rice payesh but coconut & milk payesh  - a new version which is less sweet & comes with a mild flavour :)
This restaurant could have fetched 0.5 marks more from me but that the food was not warm enough & the payesh was not cold enough was a reason for marks deduction. May be because of the proximity of the AC  the food was not hot- anyway I am giving a benefit of doubt to this restaurant. Actually this restaurant 's specialisation is South Indian food  ( not idly/ dosa) & this category  does not have much of a competition in our City! Also the portion for main course is good enough for 2 people & the portion for starters for 3 people. The price is also perfect. Hence the advantage :-)

P. S: The buttermilk served as complementary in the beginning of your meal also fetches additional point!

Went for lunch on a Wednesday. We were the only guests till 1:45 when a couple of women walked in. Obviously not a lunch place, at least on weekdays. Nice decor keeping to the generic South Indian theme. Could have done with some piped music. Shocked to see a North Indian section of the menu loaded with kebabs, kali dal, gravies, etc. Must be due to a demand for such food. 
We stuck to the Dravidian part of the food. Overall a good experience of the meal. The Chicken 65, the Andhra mutton, the breads (appams and the Malabar Porotta) were good. The fried Pomfret was overdone thereby killing the flavor of the fish itself. The buttermilk served as a complimentary aperitif (great idea, specially in the summers!) could improve quite a bit.
The service was warm and friendly. Just that the staff get together and talk kind of loudly on the floor. 
Good value for money.

Tamarind is one of my most favorite restaurants, when it comes to trying out South Indian non veg preparations in Kolkata. Its prime location near Deshapriya Park makes it easily accessible.  It may be a little difficult to spot if you are going there the first time, so do take the help of passer byes.  The place has an interesting concept. It brings to you some of the best preparations from the Northern Himalayas as well as the Western Ghats( North Indian and south Indian cuisine).

The ambiance is extremely soothing and gives the feel of being a dining hall in a palace. However there is a touch of simplicity and calmness to it that will definitely provide you with great mental peace. Complement this wonderful ambiance with great hospitality from the staffs and Tamarind will ensure that your dining experience is as good as a king. You will not fail to notice the bronze tumbler shaped glasses that add on to the ambiance. 

Tamarind has two menu books, one showcasing a North Indian Saree on its cover and the other having a South Indian Saree on it, both suggestive of what is to follow once you open the books. As you flip the pages, trying to figure out which items will be the best, you will be assisted in your search with complimentary glasses of buttermilk. This is something that really made be appreciate Tamarind's hospitality once again. They tasted really good.

I have been to Tamarind twice and have never been disappointed with their preparations. However, there are three dishes that are worth mentioning. From the North Indian platter, do try out the Murg Firdousi Kebab. It is not the usual kebab that we are acquainted with. It has nice stuffing inside large pieces of chicken, grilled to perfection, to keep the juices intact. This will take you for a joyride. The lingering smell of the masalas will woo your sensations. From the south Indian menu book, try out the Coorg Chicken Fry. According to my palate, this is the best preparation of Tamarind. The chicken pieces are crispy, juicy and bears the touch of every spice it has been subjected to.  The peppercorn gives it a unique taste. You will also not miss the all pervasive curry patta fragrance that finds its presence in most South Indian dishes. In desserts, both times I have had their Elaner Payasam. This is payesh(rice and milk preparation) but with a twist. It is not made with rice and milk, but coconut and milk. This tastes just marvelous. It has brilliant texture and an outward fragrance of cardamom, that gives this dish a nice touch. 

Do try out Tamarind and you will be waiting to go again and again. 

A 5/5 from me.

The happiness begins as soon as i stop my car before Tamarind and notice the security guard rnning down the stairs  in an apparent effort to welcome us. His broad grin and facilitated parking eases us on to the flight of stairs that i have now labelled as the stairway to paradise that Tamarind stands for! 

From the cozy interiors that remind me a bit of the Padmanabhapuram palace in Thiruvananthpuram to the free Butter milk served as the welcome drink and right down to the food, every single thing evokes a sense of pure delight! 


On my visit today, we also ordered a chicken soup called Kozi Chicken that was, again, lip smacking in taste.  The Malabar Chicken that we also ordered to go along with the Appam was rich with the flavour of the spices yet did not have the strong spiciness and so was equally wonderful.  

I dont know why this restaurant bothers to provide the north Indian menu to the guests--i for one have never even gone beyond the first page of the "north Indian Menu book" and concentrate only on the Menu that lists the food of the South! And believe me, even though there are quite a few of the dishes listed in the menu, a visit to the Tamrind is incomplete if you do not taste the Appam and Chicken stew! So heavenly is the taste and smell of the Chicken stew here that my mind actually imagines myself in some spice garden, inhaling the fragrances of the sweet cinnamon and the clove! Every restaurant has its signature dish and this particular dish is probably the one that makes one want to keep going back to Tamarind again.....and again!

Tamarind is, truly, "A Place up in the heaven" !

The first time i went into Tamarind i asked very innocuously whether they served dosas, not knowing of its speciality south indian status, i was politely refused and since i wanted dosas ( pregnancy cravings) i dutifully left. But the peek inside remained with me and made me go back now for my other favourite -  appam and Kerala style ishtu ( stew)! And it was not just delicious it was nostalgic, reminding me of my days of having the same combination several times in Chembur many years ago. So Tamarind scores for nostalgia and appams, it also scores for its traditional decor, though it is a bit short on space, i dread waiting to eat food that i will pay for. The other fares are wonderful, spicy without making your nose and eyes run, if you know what i mean. Go go for the wonderful Southern spices and of course the fluffy appams.

This place had been on my wishlist for a while now. Years in fact! Finally got the chance yesterday and it was worth the wait!

First up. The decor. Minimalist and somehow it gave me visions of Malgudi Days! Heavy wooden chairs with netted seats and backrests or elongated benches with tables complementing them. The photograph of a lady clad in a red-bordered white sari attending to exotic spices in earthen jars adds to the charm. She possibly also has the quintessential gajra tied to her bun. Don't quite remember. That was the most striking frame for me. There might be some more. 

Now the crockery. They serve you in brass plates, tumblers and glasses. Interestingly the napkins are ocher yellow. Talk of colour co-ordination.     

Without further ado, THE FOOD. The moment you are seated you are served 'Mor'- the south Indian equivalent of 'Chas'- in an earthen glass. A pleasant drink considering the not so cool February afternoon. We ordered Dakshini Yera, for starters. Nicely flavoured deep fried prawns served with diced cucumbers, carrots and capsicums which in turn were flavoured  with rock salt (probably). There was also a typically South Indian tomato chutney for a dip. For the Main Course we went for Malabar Chicken, Nellore Chapalla Puruse ( Grilled fish in a spicy mix), Malabar Paratha and steamed rice. Both the chicken and fish were cooked well. But definitely not for those with an aversion towards spice and oil (and also curry leaves and mustard seeds :P)! The portions are rather generous as well. By this time, me and my friend were too full for dessert, so can't comment on that.

As for the staff, they are quite courteous and helpful. If you like trying out different cuisines and restaurants, this place is a must visit. Oh, yes, and it is not too expensive, if not exactly 'pocket friendly'. Happy Hogging!

What a great place to dine in: TAMARIND

_____________________________________________________


Brief and Food: 

I had made a visit to this restaurant today afternoon with my brother. It is situated in the Sarat Bose Main Road, just above the Sharma, Sarat Bose Road. As parking is not allowed in the main road, it was very kind of the guard to show us where to park our cars. 
When i kept my step's inside this place at 12:40 afternoon, i had been warmly welcomes inside. As we had already tried Arz Lebanese( Which is newly opened beside Call@roll and is not yet featured on Zomato), we planned to taste the famous Hyderabadi Biriyani out here which have already been mentioned by the Foodie's out here. What amazed me was the complimentary Drink they had prepared for us when we had just given a visit to it. Not just that, i really loved their concept of presenting water to us in the usual puja wala glass, the bronze glass. We were surprised for a minute as we had not ordered. After that, they had surprised me more with the way Chicken Hyderabadi Biriyani was presented to us. It was hot and sizzling. I had never had such type of biriyani in Kolkata at least having boneless chicken chunks in the Biriyani and so many masalas. The biriyani did not have Dalda as the usual mughlai preparer's and had a little bit of oil. Without even asking for, we were served with Raita and onion salad which they don't usually charge for which amazed me that there are such good places in Kolkata also who serve you PERFECTLY. The quantity was enough for 2 of us as we were not much hungry. Our bill came to 300 bucks inclusive of taxes and it was really kind of them to help us end our meal with complimentary pan's. This positive attitude is keeping this place alive and i am really happy to call it one of my favorite MUST visit places in Kolkata. 

_____________________________________________________

Pros:- 
1) Food quality is good.
2) Food presentation is outstanding.
3) Food quantity is good.
4) Soft music played at their restaurant gives a very peace feeling. 
5) Staffs are helpful and courteous.
6) Service is moderately prompt.
7) Price's charged are very reasonable for the food
8) Ambience is simple and cool. 
9) Complimentary by them adds to their Goodwill
10) Food is prepared with utmost standards and excluding Dalda ghee.


Cons:- 
1) Nothing as such felt to me at the moment. 

_____________________________________________________

Suggestions:-

1) Keep up the good work and don't let the standards fall down at any costs.
2) Try getting more dishes in the menu. 
3) Invent more way's to grab a customers attention. 

_____________________________________________________

Summary: 
Food presentation 5/5
Food quality 4.5/5
Food quantity 4.5/5
Service 4/5

_____________________________________________________

Conclusion:- 
Lovely place to visit with family and friends. Costs the same as a restaurant should cost. Coming back for more surely. Outstanding.

This place is really good. The menu is particularly very interesting, comprising of selected South Indian Delicacies (sparing Idly Dosas and Vadais).. and unlike most South Indian joints, this one has an interesting selection of non vegetarian dishes to offer. From Idiyappams and Aapams to Chettinad chicken, Lemon Rice and Bissibeli Bath.. man I really have to visit this place again!

One of my cousins who has attained connoisseur rank on Zomato is of the opinion that Tamarind tries too hard to serve authentic south Indian food and perhaps uses a bit too much of coconut and coconut milk in most of their recipes. However, I beg to differ with him and in my opinion this place serves very good Chettinad cuisine at prices which are quite acceptable for a restaurant in southern Kolkata. It also dishes out good Malayali food. The fan favourite here is the appam which happens to be my favourite as well but the size of the appams could be a bit larger and if they are going to serve not more than two or three in a portion. An appetizer I like is the rice and lentil dumpling (it s rather difficult to remember the name), the chicken 65 and the Mangalorean chicken. I have never had the opportunity to try the Kerala chilli crab as on none of the four occasions crab was available. In the main course do try the avial which is quite delctable. They also serve a fish curry by the name of moilee which I quite like and a prawn malabar curry and another prawn curry the name of which I fail to recall. The kotu parathas and malabar parathas combined with the mutton uppu and chicken kori were also quite appreciated by me and my friends. The payasam is the only dessert I have tried and I did not find it that bad. 
The decor is quite nice and I especially like the seating arrangement near the windows with wooden shutters. The service is average in my opinion but the staff are courteous, helpful and friendly. The value for money is not that great and it is not a restaurant one will wish to visit over and over again.

Okay so I chanced upon this pretty little joint on New Year's and I decided to give it a try.It would be quite a different experience to try South Indian Cuisine in all it's glory ! As I walked up the stairs, the place looked chic and posh. I entered and it was nothing very different or unusual in terms of decor but I did love the wall paintings depicting traditional south Indian women :)
1. Complimentary Red Wine. Yay. It was tiny portion but still a nice welcome drink:)
2. Mushroom Pepper Fry- Lovely juicy mushrooms cooked to perfection in a spicy stir fry is every Mushroom lover's dream.
3. Avial- My partner (who is a South Indian) suggested this, it being a traditional dish so we gave this a try. Subtle ,tangy Yougurt based with lot's of veggies. I personally liked it. Not LOVED it but liked it :)
4. Roasted Aloo Gedde (correct me If I'm wrong :P)- This was roasted baby potatoes in a red curry. Sweet , tangy, and potatoes perfectly cooked , was a delight !
5. Lemon Rice- I have always loved lemon rice and this was prepared the traditional way with lot's of curry leaves ! Really fragrant and light and perfect accompaniment
6. Double ka meetha- Warning : Really Sweet. Go for it only if you LOVE sweets like me :p It's creamy rich and did I mention Sweet ? :P Topped off with creamy malai and pista this is one heck of a bread pudding ! 
Tamarind was an experience. Not just food a cultural experience. :)

Opposite deshapriya park on sarat bose road,, Tamarind boasts a great and convenient location and the overall experience especially the food is delightful !!!!!!

Tamarind had been on my wishlist for quite a while but ultimately got to experience it not before a couple of days back and i loved it. The restaurant has a good seating capacity and the decor is lovely. Seats are decently spaced and being wooden ones, could be discomforting to some but i found it fine. The service is fast enough and the staff is very polite,  courteous. The menu is separate for north, south indian cuisine which i felt a bit difficult to manage and would have preferred a long, combined  menu. 

Coming to food, i am not a genius of south indian cuisine thats on offer here so i tried items from both the menu and almost everything was nice. The kebabs are good especially the seekh and hara bhara kebab but paneer tikka was pretty average. For souh indian starter, coorg paneer was really amazing and is highly recommended from my side. Mix veg in chettinad spices felt very fresh, crisp and tasteful. I am a big fan of malabar paratha and they made it decent though not my best ever. Hyderabadi bread named bakharkhani had a sweet flavour and was nice. Naans were good too.  Hyderabad biryani has nice flavours and aroma. Fried south indian papads that they call appam is served complementary and is a bit lighter compared to what i have had at other south indian restaurants. 

Tamarind offers  a great dine-out at very affordable prices plus experimenting on a new cuisine that i am personally not so acquainted with added to my feel-good for it.

Tasty food and Cosy ambiance! Tamarind is a nice place to visit with friends and family. I went there to relish some South Indian delicacies and I indeed loved what they served! We were welcomed with a home made wine, which was quite good, and then we ordered for a soup, I do not remember the name, but it was a Sri Lankan dish! It was quite decent and a bit spicy as well. As a starter, we ordered for aa fish fry which was a bit different from the regular fish fries we get in kolkata and it was served with a red chutney. For the main course we ordered Andhra Chicken Pulao and Malabar Chicken Curry. Both were yumm although the Pulao wasa bit spicy! (Do try the Pulao if you like spicy food otherwise DON'T) Overall, I liked my visit to this place. It was nicely decorated and the waiters were very courteous and helped us to order the food. Looking forward to visit this place sometime soon.

Not bad at all. The firdousi is a must try. Biriyani was too spicy. Never had the idea that south indian kebabs could be so tasty. However the payesam was an epic fail. I thought it to be a south indian version of bengali payes and was utterly stumped when it turned out to be made of coconut.

Good place for hyderabadi biriyani in Kolkata !
Yes, I wrote it because till now in those restaurants where I had hyderabadi biriyani are very bad in comparison with that I had in tamarind. Truly hyderabadi.
I opted tamarind for shoptomi lunch this puja and it was pre decided that we will go there. We means me and my girl friend. Actually I was more intended to go there because some kind of hyderabadi food festival was going on over there that time.
It was quite easy to get into tamarind than other restaurants in puja days. We got an instant welcome from the staff outside and we had to wait for 10 minutes. After that we got to sit. The ambiance seemed very descent and appropriate to me. Quite spacious, Not at all clumsy, brightly  lighten and a nice chulha was there which I found very cool. It is an ideal place if you come with your family over here because they can accommodate even 12 people at a row.
We did not go late to order as the biriyani was planned. We ordered hyderabadi murgh biriyani, rara mutton and green salad. Actually we both have very small appetites so these were enough for us :P Well I forgot to say, they served us a complimentary drink which was butter milk. I think that welcoming drink is treated as an appetizer. We got a firm delivery within 10 minutes which is very good for hungry people. The biriyani was good and the mutton dish was very different. I was having this new item for the first time and I liked it. Small pieces of mutton deeply covered with thick and spicy red gravy. Yummyy :) But the quantity of side dish was not enough for two people. The biriyani was full of unknown spices among them very few were known to me. It gave me a pleasure having hyderabadi biriyani. The taste is still in my mouth.
I found tamarind is a bit costly according to their service. I think they should increase the quantity of their side dishes as the price is too high. Apart from that, this is a good place to have food. Best of luck for tamarind from my end. I will visit again soon :)

Having travelled from Anwar Shah to Sarat Bose Road very often- Tamarind never missed my attention but somehow I never got a chance to visit it for a long time. My mom and Sister had been there and were very sure I would love it too! So that‚Äôs how I went to Tamarind , hoping for a good evening with good food of course!

Tamarind is on the main Sarat Bose Road. To be precise- when you‚Äôre proceeding from Southern Avenue Crossing towards Deshopriya , you‚Äôll see Tamarind on your left hand foot. There‚Äôs a huge palm tree outside Tamarind that‚Äôs always lighted with Brightly colored lamps.
A fleet of staircase leads you to the main Entrance. The walls flanking the staircase showcases many of the awards Tamarind has won for its excellence towards serving Good Food at all times. Mostly all are Times Food Awards.

The restaurant is small and cosy . The D√©cor is very decent and normal ‚Äì not too fancy, very simple yet sophisticated wooden interiors.
 What impresses me the most is the hospitality of the humble and courteous staff who are always smiling and its very pleasant to talk to them. They know their stuff very well and will help you to know each and every dish on their menu elaborately.

The very first thing served to you is the complimentary Chaas and this is something I look forward for each time I go. Well, Chaas is a simple thing ‚Äì but at Tamarind they serve it to you with a special Tadka comprising of Mustard Seeds, Chiili and Curry Leaves. The buttermilk is not to runny and the flavor of the Tadka leaves you asking for a second helping. Though the chaas is complimentary but I wouldn‚Äôt mind paying for it if ever I needed to.

If you want to set out on a Gastronomical expedition to the South- Tamarind is the place for you. For most of us South Indian food is synonymous to Idlis, Dosas, Uttapam , Medu Wadas and Sambhar but then there‚Äôs another side to the same cuisine ‚Äì which is different ,subtle and extremely delicious. These are cuisines which are mostly native to Andhra, Kerala , Coorg , Tamil Nadu etc and for me , this was an unexplored territory and I was eagerly looking forward for the same.
Though Tamarind has an Extensive Menu for North Indian as well , but I would prefer the first timers to try out their south Indian delicacies‚Äô.

If you‚Äôre ready to set your tongue on Fire- do try the Mushroom Pepper Fry which is their Chettinad preparation . The Mushrooms are fresh and perfectly tossed with onions and a generous amount of Pepper! A very different delicacy which I often do not get anywhere else.
Visit to Tamarind is incomplete without their Appam and Avial.
Appam  is a type of Pancake/ dosa which is shaped like a Kadhai/Vessel but tastes very different from the normal dosas. It‚Äôs a rice flour batter preparation and is a Keralian delicasy. Its crisp on the outer portion and softer inside. 
Avial on the other hand is stew or vegetables simmered in coconut gravy. Both these dishes complement each other perfectly. The Coconut flavored gravy is a treat when mingled with the crisp pancake. Vegetables have a crunchy tinge to it which makes dish complete.
The Appams are available in Egg and Cheese variety as well- but I would recommend to keep it authentic .
Their Dum Biryani is also recommended for main course and speacially for rice lovers , Calcutta has many of them !! Every grain of Rice is separate and is a witness to the fact that they have been cooked on dum. The Fried Onions and the Kesar flavor it all the more well. Vegetables are layered well with the rice and the aroma remains intact with every bite.
For desserts I would recommend the Double ka Meetha which is again the Hyderabad‚Äôs favourite.

They serve complimentary Papads (Applam) as well and trust me, It vanishes off the plate in no time. Another things that‚Äôs different here is the way Chillies (Kachha Lanka) is served to you. A toothpick is inserted at the head of the Chilli which makes it look so decorative and fancy. This often makes me rethink again and gain on how garnish and presentation can make such a lot of difference. If it appeals to the eye- half the battle is won :)

Service is not super-fast but neither very slow. However- if attempted to expedite the service , the experience at Tamarind could get much better.

They serve Paan to you at the end which is stuffed with Nariyal or the grated coconut and this again comes Complimentary. This completes the excellent Food Safari just at a perfect note.
All their Complimentary stuffs are too good for words- be it the Chaas or the Applam or the Paan. At times , this itself becomes the key drive to visit tamarind once again, with Chaas topping the list.

I haven‚Äôt experimented much with their North Indian Cuisine , but my next visit would aim that for sure. 
 
Food is decently priced. Charges for three are approximately close to a 1000 bucks  and every penny is worth it.

If looking for a good dining option at South Kolkata- this place is highly recommended !

If you want to try some exotic south indian non-veg food items which are not available easily then this is the place to be. All those exotic hyderabadi, keralian, tamil ,coorge delicacies are available and perfectly prepared sothat one can have all kinds of south indian flavours right here in kolkata. Tamarind serve mouth watering north indian items also and the menu is vast.. waiters are helpful and always helps is someone is in doubtful of choosing menu rightly.. the best thing is that all the items written are generally available and freshly prepared after order so it may take time but the food is fresh always. I went to the restaurant twice, once during lunch another during dinner time, on both occasions it was partially filled so i dont think one has to wait in queue to enter this place, ambiance is grand and taste of all items are impeccable.. In my two visits i ordered various south indian items like chicken chettinad, malabar chicken, royala egguru, hyderabadi biriyani, chicken 65, coorge mutton fry ,bakharkhani etc, everything is great.. very recently i took their home delivery facility, their delivery area is large so one can take the liberty of home delivery also & their home delivery system is very efficient.. during this time i ordered mainly north indian foods like masala kulcha, ajwaini fish tikka, murg malai kabab,kashmiri aloo dum, they are nothing less than perfect .. Tamarind has become one of my favourite restaurants now-a-days...

Nice location, above average decor, prompt service and awesome food - sums up the experience at Tamarind. We had chicken 65 as starter; appam and chettinad chicken in main course. And trust me, i never imagined south indian dishes can taste such delicious. It has separate menu cards for north and south indian dishes. But south indian is their speciality. Price of individual food items are a bit on the higher side, but the quanity of each dish is sufficient for two people.  Plannin to visit again soon..

Ambiance - 4/5
Food - 4/5
Service - 4/5

My Kolkata visits are always filled with food activity as I keep getting invitations from friends for lunch or dinner. One such occasion landed me to Tamarind on my recent Kolkata visit. I made a through research on what to try on Zomato as it was a new place and I did not want to land up for a surprise.

We entered the restaurant and was pleased to see the decor and the ambiance. Being in an upmarket south Calcutta region, my expectation was matched. We settled down on a corner as many of the tables were reserved for lunch. The place was almost full, very unlike Hyderabad on a weekday.

Since we had a menu pre-decided on our minds, we ordered the Kothu Paratha & Kodi Gassi and to compliment the spices we ordered some kulfi faluda. The service was prompt and we were served some nibblers along with a matka of buttermilk which was very refreshing.

The food was served in a while. The hot parathas with the chicken curry. Each of the item tasted equally brilliant and I could get a different taste even after staying for almost 15 years in the southern states of India. The meal wrapped up with some delicious kulfi which cut in the shape of a fish.

Great food and great company of friend gave me an opportunity to come back to the CIty of Joy  for some new place to try.

To start with, an exclusive feel and taste of South Indian delicacies! 
The ambiance is calm, subtle lighting and various references to South India, makes an excellent setting. The staff is very courteous and speaks & understands good English. Their complimentary butter milk at the start and Paan at the end only increases my visits to them! The restaurant now serves both South and North Indian but I would suggest to order 70% of your menu from South Indian menu. My recommendations for order:
Bangla Dumpa Veppudu & Kuzhi Paniyaram (Veg Starters), Chakori Kebab (Chicken starter from north Indian menu).
Kothmiri Paneer, Alugedde Roast, Mirch aloo ka salaan,  (Veg main course). 
Kothu Paratha (with egg) and Bakharkhani are the breads (Roti).
Dal Makhani (north section) is a must and very different from usual north Indian joints.
Try the Hyderabadi Subz/Chicken Biryani - a treat for biryani lovers.
Desserts - Didn't like anything much to mention this :(
Cost for 2: 800-900 (Excluding Taxes), for 4 people 1300-1400 (Excluding Taxes).
P.S. Recently I also hosted a party for 17 people and they provided with a separate space with Buffet Dinner. The service here too was excellent! And the price was quite affordable.

service is hopeless,and becoming more hopeless by the day.very few waiters to look after you.you have to ask for water.they have certain preferred clients they are happy to wait on..rest are treated like shit.they will drop your food while serving,they will not replace it,and yet they will charge the full amount.they keep seats for special clients,you have to sit where they want you to,even if the whole restaurant is empty.at any point of time expect the repairman to jump on your bench with his soiled slippers on to fix the ac.
yet the food is good,but highly overpriced considering the disgusting service
a word of advice, dont take your girlfriend there.they may not like it

The decor is elegant, seating is comfy and the service here is pretty good. 

They serve North Indian cuisine as well but at Tamarind, I always experiment with their exotic South Indian fare. My favorites here are Meen Kozhambu, Chemeen Curry, Mutton Stew, Andhra Pulao & the soft appams. 

Prices are decent and food for three usually comes up to 1200 bucks.

when the place 1st opened their motto was south indian as we don't know it. and I have been to both their original eatery and after they relocated. never a big fan of the excess use of curry leaves but the food quite suited my palate. the kozi thirkkal was pretty tasty and had a beautiful aroma of all the spices that was very southern. the malabar chicken was pretty decent. but yes they serve the best appam in kol. the cheese appam is certainly too good. all in all a nice eatery that does serve good food. a 3 rating cause of the cuisine they serve and me never being a big fan of it.

This place is quite an affair. Firstly, the decor, if not out of the world, is pretty awesome. Service is good. And the FOOD IS EXCELLENT. This is NOT a typical South Indian Thaali type pure veg restaurant (for that, visit Banana Leaf in the vicinity. It is one of the top restaurants on my Kolkata list). Tamarind presents a diverse set of cuisines from all across South India, including all four states. Thus they have a wide diversity of items on their menu. I particularly recommend GOSHT KI HALEEM (a Hyderabad speciality). It's one of the best preparations of mutton I've have so far in my life (and trust me when I talk about mutton). So go ahead and have a gala burp!!

this is the premier south indian restaurant of kolkata,and i took few of my friends from kerala for a visit.its near priya cinema and we drove from there.their south indian dishes always taste bland,probably because its the original south indian tatse.so we opted for biryani along with appams,malabars etc their decor and floor space is good,so is the staff which gives you the sense of quality time.this was my 2nd visit and i recommend this place for all seekers of south indian dishes.

If like me, you're a connoisseur of South Indian cuisine (not stopping merely at dosa uttapam) but willing to explore beyond, then welcome to Tamarind. Their appams,avials and meen moilee won't fail to up your mood, be it or rain or shine!Also,don't forget to try the chaas and coriander rice and special dal combo that these guys serve out here. Plus the decor is tasteful and subtle,adding to the entire dining out experience. Going back again tonight :-)

I had visited tamarind only once with my wife and i can tell you i was quiet satisfied. Actually most of the food items served here are kerala food items, prawn curry rice and mostly coconut based items. The deco is most based on kerela. I liked the coconut base rice items, the sambhar dal. Over all it was a wonderful experience at tamarind.

First things first. Theres more to south Indian food than idli, dosa, uttapam and vadas. Try the malabar paratha, chicken 65, chettinad chicken and the variety of southern offerings on the platter. 
For the record, the north Indian food is equally good. Biriyanis aren't the traditional excessively spiced offerings. Try the mutton Biryani here. 
Staff is courteous and service is expectantly prompt. Good food. A bit spicy and  of course oily - we call it "rich" food - but that is how many north Indian dishes are. 
Good food. Standard pricing of around Rs 750 - 800 for two. Perhaps i might say: Easy on the wallet! 
Definitely a thumbs up....

when you go there then you first need to understand that south Indian cuisine is not all about idli and dosa. this place specialises on the other parts of the south indian cuisine. appams and stew.... chicken 65... 
the food is just too good. also try the mutton biriyani and the malabar paratha...  normally I take all my vegetarian friends to this place and they love the food too. 
the north Indian menu is also not bad.... and the tandoori is mouth watering......
start with the free butter milk and the coconut paan at the end....
good decor.. great staff.... 
it's a great place to go and have good.

This place is a savior for a household like us where half the people like south Indian food, while the other half do not. It serves a wide array of food and would cater to different tastes. The appam is specially recommended. It is lighter than dosa, and very different in taste -- I like to have it with mutton stew.

I had heard a lot of good things about this one but when I myself visited this place I realized they were all fake (atleast for me). I was so not impressed with their food taste nor the quantity. 
Especially their south Indian food was tasteless and honestly I hated it. Their dosa was hard and idli too dry to swallow. 
The ambience is nice and I don't have any complains regarding this matter. The staff are cordial but need to be a little more friendly or else they seem to be too cold at times. 
The pricing is reasonable and affordable and the location too is quite convenient and central. 
Overall I did not enjoy my food though the ambience is good. I rate it 2.5 since this place did disappoint me big time, especially as I went their with quite high expectations.

Tamarind does make most of the dishes it serves quite well, but it goes a little overboard when it comes to projecting itself as South Indian. Authentic South Indian non-vegetarian food does not as much coconut oil/milk and curry leaves as the versions prepared in this restaurant.

The ambience is good and the waiters polite. Service is middling - some items come quickly and others take time, and not always because the ones that come later are more complex.

The appams are well made, but the price charged for one piece, which is actually one half, makes no sense, given that a typical diner will require two or three pieces to eat an entire side dish. The Meen Moilee, a fish dish, is good. Beverages like the Pani Hara are very refreshing, and the Elaneer Payasam (a dessert) is rather good.

Unless one craves South Indian non-vegetarian items insatiably, there is little reason to come back to this place. The vegetarian items are too expensive, and better quality dishes can be obtained in other South Indian restaurants within five minutes' walk of Tamarind.

I have but only praises for Tamarind. The decor is lovely, the service is the best I have ever come across, and they serve you real lip smacking dishes.

The starters are awesome, we generally have something like a spicy seafood. Every time the fish or prawns were fresh and with just the right amount of spice coating. With a glass of buttermilk its heaven.

After the spicy start I prefer the main course to be bland and invariably end up ordering a Keralian Mutton Stew and Appam. The soft warm appam and the creamy coconut milk stew has become my comfort food. I tried a vegetarian dish once with grated coconut, it was wonderful.

Last but not the least, I love the paan they serve at the end of the meal.

Its not very cheap. But its worth every rupee you pay.

This is, as far as I remember, not the place where Tamarind started and it got shifted here. It is the same building which has the sharma sweets so it is pretty famous and easy to locate.
As you enter through the big glass door and the staircase you cannot help but appreciate the decor. It has enough referrence to South India with its various paintings, the statues, the menu card itself and even the place mats and the utensils speak so much in reference to the place and the culture. I would still have preferred a banana leaf on the plate or maybe a small banana tree in a corner with a keralan boat in a small model placed somewhere strategically enough for people to notice. The music this time was not that great but I had an awesome experience on my previous visit with the music after which I remember having asked them about the cd. The lighting was good but not everybody has a liking to a light above one's head and though we requested to put it off they were not at all co operative....A huge negative as you must remember the basic marketing mantra.."customer is God". 
The next thing negative was that if you serve a welcome drink you should not charge for a re fill, that is why the best restaurants, especially the ones by specialty group is so different from these and definitely not when you have priced your food so high. Still the butter milk was pretty cooling and good. 
I always believe a good mocktail makes the perfect beginning as I have referred to it so many times in my reviews but this was not at all very appealing at Tamarind.
The food however made up for most of the negatives the Kori Kempu Bezule was so awesome to start with it had very much, a South Indian taste, with all the various spices and herbs but then, even the chicken 65 I had last time was pretty good though you expect it to be so with it being so common.
The next thing on order was what I have liked on both my visits that is the stew and it was sooo goood. Had it with appams and I knew this surely the USP of this place.
I also had the Kothu Paratha which gets served with a Chettinad gravvy (if I am not mistaken) and they were certainly different and good but nothing compared to the ones mentioned above.
However the end was so not good as we did not like the Andhra Pulao at all.
The food got served all together so that is not good because half of it was cold by the time we had it so when they know the quantity and they can guess by the number of people who are sitting then you should be smart enough to wait and serve it bit by bit- taking care that the food remains warm.
Finally the paan in the end was very good but paying around Rs 1300 for just 4 dishes is a bit too expensive maybe. So if you charge that much for South Indian food remember not to be miserly to not give another free drink and you should give free rasam with the food because as a customer you end up wishing it was served knowing it is a South Indian restaurant.
However a definite must visit if you believe South Indian food is all about dosas, vadas and utthapams.

Dropped in recently for a late lunch with my mom, and had a simple meal of Coriander rice, Tomato Pappu, Pachhakai Stew and Madras Fish Curry. The daal aka Tomato Pappu was lip-smacking and so was the fish curry. Everything's cool about the place, but the waiters should be  more professional.

Some facts:        The old building on Lansdowne famous for housing Sharma's kochuri was demolished, we were sad :( , but soon a new one was built and Sharma returned in a brand new avatar. And along with Sharma came a very "good looking" restaurant, Tamarind.

This restaurant is very neat when it comes to decor and styling. A staircase welcomes you to the restaurant which is on the 1st floor. When we entered, an IPL match was going on, and even though everyone was looking at the TV, I was looking at the furnishings, which were tasteful indeed. But how does it score when it comes to the taste of the real thing, food? Well I would say, above average, but not the best. We tasted "chicken chettinad" with "appams", these two being the famous dishes of Tamarind. The Chettinad was spicy and tasty. The appams were average, (the difference in concentration of rice separates dosas, uttapams and appams ) so one can guess how it tased.

For food: 3.5/5
For ambiance and decor: 4.5/5

Visited this place after a movie At nearby priya. the utensils looked nice and they gave a curd water which cooled the body.
for starters, we had chilly crab. but the pieces weren't broken and it was quite difficult to break the hard shell. but the waiter helped us and broke them when he saw our problem.
for main course, we had coriander rice and lamb haleem. the coriander rice was light and simple. but the Haleem was disappointing. it tasted like butter and too much oil. and I felt no different taste As I should from a lamb. I even asked if this was lamb At all. I wish they would do more justice to theIr only lamb dish in the restaurant.
for dessert, we ordered double ka meetha. it was like gajar ka halwa with nice kheer. quite good.
verdict: good food but not good enough for the price of rs1200+. ambience is not so so. and few waiters seemed not to understand our questions we asked. my search for a place which can keep me coming again and again, is sadly not this.

This South Indian restaurant isn't about dosas and idlis, but appams, mutton stew and spicy fish gravy. You will be treated to a plethora of authentic South Indian fare and we are not talking dosas and idlis. The Hyderabadi biriyanis are flavourful as are the vegetarian counterparts. The non-vegetarian curries have a distinct flavour that kicks your salivary glands into action. The best part is that they also have a North Indian menu, so you can choose from the northern part of Indian cuisine as well..The menu has elaborate list of non-veg items, each being marked by the state of recipe (TN, AP, Kerala even Sri Lanka) as well as the level of spice,which is a ig bonus or food lovers as they can choose the perfect balance of spices for them..decor is plush,elegant and smart..gives a comfy look ..overall a good place fir a family dinner..

Went in to celebrate Poila Baisakh with my family. Ammini was first choice but it was closed today. We decided to try the special thali.

The menu seemed a tad better than last time. Overall less heavy. The food itself was a mixed deal.

Started with a drink... daab water with honey and mint I think. Not to my taste. Starters was a chicken kabab (like a reshmi, slightly undercooked perhaps and too much spice), and meen porichadu, a fried fish and slightly lacking in flavour.

We wer ethen served a nice mixed vegetable, a south Indian dal (I didnt have it) a corn in spinach with a fried rice, mildly flavoured. Along with that was mutton bhuna (spicy again), a prawn dish in mild white gravy (two decent sized prawns), and appams (not well made at all). With it were chutney, papad and salad.

Dessert was vanila icecream with chocolate sauce (how unimaginative can you get) and a malpoa with mango rabdi. The last was awful. The malpoa could have been far better and the rabdi tasted (and probably was) made of maida. Yuck. They were nice enough to replace with other desserts of choice. We opted for a double ka meetha (shahi tukda) and kulfi. Even the kulfi tasted like it had a lot of maida. Came with rather thick falooda.

Not sure if it is worth the Rs 475 plus tax. The quantity is sufficient, perhaps more than, but the choice of items could be better. The quality definitely so. Service style is something they need to look into. They got everything together which means they tend to get cold. They brought the appam initially which we sent back as they wereunderdone. We had to wait ages for the replacement, bu which time food was cold. I send my mutton and prawn for heating by which time the appam got cold!!! Oh well. Service was somewhat lax. They were prompt at times and at times kept us waiting. Very polite though.



----- 20 Oct, 2012 -----

Visit on 20.12.2012.
Hyderabadi food festival on. Regular menu replaced with some items of Hyderabadi cuisine.

I believe the downfall of this once great restaurant started with the introduction of north Indian food. The staff attitude too seems worse than my last visit.

1. Some basic necessities removed from menu. My friend wanted lemon rice and they had to be coaxed to make it.
2. Usual service issues. When a patron asks cold water, the waiter should remember and serve cold water when asked again. Was not done.
3. Do not expect paper tissues instead of serviettes at this price range.
4. Food was rather sad today. Meen Porichadu lacked flavour. The bhetki was dry and probably not as fresh as it could have been.
5. The Mutton Pepper Fry too was tasteless. The supposed spicy item was rather insipid. Most of spice and less of meat. Very sad.
6. Chicken Chettinad was passable but didn't resemble what I remembered of this dish.
7. The appams were delicious :)

I feel the food at Tamarind is way too spicy. You really notice that when you start getting full and you feel up to the brim with spice but not of any real flavourful food.

I am one of those who'd do ANYTHING to stay away from South-Indian. I was dragged to this place to change my view about the cuisine and I must say, I was ashamed to have had such prejudices before! Tamarind is a wonderful experience! The decor, the ethnic feel, the staff, the service...everything is top notch! 

The Chicken 65 was good. So was the Mutton haleem. But i loved the Malabari prawns and the Appams (cheese).

I've wanted to go back to this place for a long time now but I can't seem to find someone who for once would let go of the general ideas we have about S/I food and fall in love with Tamarind like i did!

I cannot help but praise this place. Every time I go there there is something better than the last. Some times it is the crab pepper fry. Another time it was the Kori Gassi. Some other time it was the mutton Alisa. Yet another time it was the Paniyaram and Cheese Appams go with everything, you know. And the beautiful neer mor that you get greeted with once you are seated... absolutely scrumptious. I love this joint for having quick service, fab decor and great food! A must-visit for people who like non-veg south Indian food (and oh, they serve North Indian too, but beyond the tandoori chicken,  which was sublime, I have not been able to venture that way, as the South side is way too tempting).

As the name suggests this restaurant specializes in South Indian food (though they have a north Indian menu which also has great dishes). But I"ll suggest you to order south Indian if you visit Tamarind. Everything starting from the juicy chicken 65, coorg chicken/mutton fry, which are awesome as starters, to the tasty Kori Gassi or the Malabar Prawn and Andhra Pulao tastes just superb. But the pick of the lot is Appam with Chicken Chettinad, together they taste heavenly. and Double ka Meetha is a must in Tamarind and is surely the best Indian dessert I've ever had. They'll say one portion of the dessert will be enough for two, but DO NOT listen to them. coz after trying the first spoon you'll realize that even two portions won't be enough for just you. 

Concluding, Tamarind is a great place with nice ambiance, decent service and of course, superbly delicious food.

My wife suggested this place since I was in the mood for South Indian food. Apparently, they had upgraded their menu to include North Indian food as well but since I was there for South Indian, I stuck to that. We ordered a Mutton dish (Mamsam Kundu) where a couple of pieces were a little too rubbery for my taste but otherwise the overall flavor of the dish was good. The Chicken Chettinad was up to our expectations and so was the Lemon rice and the Appam.
The look and feel of the restaurant is  very mixed but seems to have a slight lean towards South Indian. The service wasn't bad but wasn't something to award.
I would definitely consider this joint the next time I want to have a nice South Indian meal in decent surroundings.

One of the very best restaurants in Kolkata, and yet so few people know about it! On Sarat Bose Road, tucked away near the crossing with Rash Behari Avenue, this place a very wide range of (especially non-vegetarian) South Indian cuisine. The service is really good, considering that the place is almost always teeming with people. The prices too are much less that what you would expect to pay at other places of such exquisite caliber and exotic food.
The last time we ate there, the Hyderabadi Bakarkhanis and the Kori Gassi chicken curry from Karnataka made our evening truly memorable. This is the first restaurant that has proved in Kolkata that South Indian food is not only about Idli-Dosa!

This is a place that I pass by almost every day and each time think I want to visit again soon .... their Aapam and Stew ( Mutton/Chicken) are wonderful and I enjoy their Mulugatwanny Soup as well. Their Malabari Prawn and Motta(Egg) Roast is also great and I would recommend that the meal should be finished on a sweet note with the Kulfi. They also have a fairly substantial indian menu but I have never tried it though I have been told that its quite nice.Some of the dishes can be very spicy so choose carefully depending on your palette.

My experience was far from the reviews I read here. I am a person from Kerala and can tell the difference between authentic Kerala dishes and which are presented as Kerala cuisine. Today (18/10/12) I had been to the restaurant with two of my colleagues and ordered four Kerala Dishes among others. Mutton Alisa was good, but quality of the meat could be improved. Appam was authentic and tasted close to perfection. 

Avial and Malabar paratha were complete let downs. Avial was made of very few vegetables and some of them are alien in avial like green peas. The vegetables used were tasting raw and not properly seasoned. The consistency was runny unlike avial. On the whole  something else was passed on as avail for a ransom of 170/-(if my memory is right)

Malabar paratha was another disaster. It was laccha paratha disguised as malabar paratha (porotta).

I did mention this to the steward and asked him where the chef is from. Said chennai. May be right. Then it is not where the chef is from that matters as much as  authenticity and taste of dishes passed as something specific.

Had been to tamarind few years back, cant place my fingers correctly on when. The food WAS different then, authentic and good.

I'm extremely disappointed with the restaurant. We had made a booking for 2 and not only did we have to wait for a table after we arrived, but the waiters also seated another table of two who had arrived after us, before us. We ordered Royyalla Vepuddu prawns for starters which arrived in adequate time. The flavours were good and seemed authentic however the prawns were over done. We ordered the Chicken Chettinad, Egg Appam and Kotthu Parantha for mains. Again the flavours were fairly authentic. The Kotthu was too oily, but in terms of quality of cooking, the chicken was a huge surprise for me. Out of the three pieces of chicken in my share, once piece was just perfectly cooked, extremely tender, while another piece was overdone and chewy, and to top that off, the third piece was under cooked!! This is sheer skill to the chef's credit. Service was prompt but the quality of service was mediocre. All the waiters had rushed to serve another table of 6, probably cuz of pretty ladies in the group, and it took us ten minutes to catch their attention even though we were sitting next to this table. Also, the fresh silverware was kept in a place right next to where the used plates are collected, which, apart from being nauseating, I'm sure is also a health and safety issue. It was a busy evening plus some of the dishes on their menu sound mouth watering hence I am going to cut them some slack will return on a weekday and give then another chance. I'll decide then.

South Indian curries and gravies are rich, beautiful and robust. 
Tamarind is one of the very few places in Kolkata which serves some mind blowing curries. Coconut laced beautiful entrees and some mind blowing meat dishes. 

Mamsam Coconut Fry (dry lamb tossed in spices) and the Mushroom Chettinad are to die for. 
I love their Malabar Prawn Curry and like to order Idiapam (string hoppers with it) the apams and the Malabar Paratha are brilliant. 

The Chepalapulusu (Andhra fish preparation) is also worth mentioning. Earlier they used to be only south Indian but now they serve north Indian and tandoori too (which I am not too keen on mentioning). 

Great ambiance, wonderful crockery, especially love the butter milk they serve as a welcome drink. The staff is humble and warm and this place brings a smile every visit. 

Simply outstanding!

I gather there is no place in Kolkata to offer you such south indian dishes (it is one of its kind in Kolkata) and change your point of view about south indian food. You won't go in the restaurant for Dosas and Idli, rather you're gonna pamper yourself with non veg south indian items cooked with care. Not only south indian, but you can also try north indian items as well, as the entire indian cuisine is presented in-front of you, to treat you like a Maharaja. From outside, the way 'Tamarind' is written on the display board, it feels like you are going in for a different kinda experience and that is exactly what the restaurant has to offer. The inside decor is very soothing and the behavior of their entire stuff group is exceptionally warm. A perfect place to have authentic Indian food with your loved ones with perfect soothing Indian music playing on background. To our heart's delight, they welcomed us with a type of Lassi (free of cost), that tested great and they also provided us with Paan at the end of our dinner instead of simple other ways that most of the restaurants use. 
The food was also very good especially the Malabar prawns and Chicken Chettinad and also from their north indian menu, the fish achari kebab. The kebab was a bit tangy with the fish cooked to perfection to melt in your mouth completely. the in house Raita and Pudina Chatni was also lovely. 
The price we paid for our food and experience inside the four walls of the restaurant was rather on the affordable side, if not too cheap. I couldn't give this place a five star only because their food was too spicy for a lot of people to have, and there was no indication of spicy or non spicy dishes at the menu card.
I'd say it is a must visit place for any foodie.

1. Moderately priced restaurant

2. Good service, knowledgeable attendant who explains the dish and can discuss about it with you, and answer your questions

3. An Indian tandoor menu has also been added, and the north indian food is also prepared with care.

4. The south indian food selection is good.

5. Well cooked food most of the time

6. My favourite items are 'Mutton alisa' soup, and used to be rawa meen fry. This fish fry became a problem for me recently when its recipe has been changed and the crust was made with a lot of chili and I spat the item out - i cannot take spicy food and having a very spicy cutlet came to me as a rude  shock. I suppose the restaurant is making changes to accommodate local taste. I have not verified if these kinds of changes continue.

I am not a big fan of South Indian cuisine, but I had heard a lot of good things about Tamarind and decided to give it a try. I must say I was very impressed with the quality of food served at the restaurant. We ordered a Chicken Hyderabadi Biryani, a Massa (Mutton) Stew and a Prawn Pepper Fry. All these items were made with care and lived upto expectations. The Massa Stew especially can easily give "Dakshin" a run for it's money. I am certainly going to go back for more!

This South Indian restaurant isnt about dosas and idlis, but appams, mutton stew and spicy fish gravy. You will be treated to a plethora of authentic South Indian fare and we are not talking dosas and idlis. The Hyderabadi biriyanis are flavourful as are the vegetarian counterparts. The non-vegetarian curries have a distinct flavour that kicks your salivary glands into action. The best part is that they also have a North Indian menu, so you can order melt-in-your-mouth burra kebabs and then a spicy Chicken Chettinad from Tamil Nadu or a Chemeen Curry from Kerala. National integration on your plate!
