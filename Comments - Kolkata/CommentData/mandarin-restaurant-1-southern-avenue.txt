The sheer amount of the soup the serve is enough to fill 3 grown ups like me.(I eat a lot). The staff were also very kind and helpful. The taste of the food is very enticing. One tip, just never go alone and order anything full. Need a few more visits to comment on the quality of the raw materials used, but looked very good to me. Just the ambience has to be worked with.

If u want good Chinese at a reasonable price,Mandarin is the place to be.The Chicken Sweet corn Soup is delicious.Add to that the Hakka Noodles and the Garlic Prawn,which are all mouth watering delicacies. Service is a bit on the slower side.Ambience is decent.Head over to Mandarin for scrumptious Chinese Food.

The food quantity was good and the items are pocket friendly, so was the fish cooked well. Chicken quality and the preparations were equally bad. There was a space crunch and flies were falling on food. They didn't do anything to compensate just removed it.

I visited this place with my friends. As it was weekend ,almost all the tables were occupied so we had to wait for some 5 -10 mins .
¬†

Talking about the food ,we ordered

1.Chilli garlic hakka noodles- The noodles had a distinct flavour of garlic and was perfectly done.

2.Schezwan fried rice- It was so yummy that it will make you crave for more.

3.Veg manchurian 
was very tasty. Little spicy but good.
5.Crispy fried chicken- This one is my favourite. The chicken pieces was so crisp and perfectly coated with sauce that it will mesmerize your taste buds.
Recommended for sure.

One of the oldest Cantonese eatery in south Kolkata still serving amazing Chinese food. With medium pocket pinch it can very much suffice both quality & quantity. Chicken sweet corn soup as appetiser followed by mixed Cantonese chow, mixed fried rice, chili chicken gravy & Szechuan chicken gravy. Service was pretty fast. Ambiance here is not very well furnished, however you will get a nostalgic feeling of the old school type. Would love üíï to come back again and again üëç.

Firstly, be it the rush hour, or the leisurely afternoon, the way you treat your customers has to be of a certain standard. My earlier visits have been delightful which made me choose mandarin at the late hours of Maha astami. However, beginning from the table allotted, to the courtesy presented by the waiters were terrible,  not to mention the suddenly-turned-small pieces of chicken, and the tiny hairs found in the mixed Cantonese noodles. Mandarin has really disappointed me.

One of the oldest places in the city serving Chinese, I don't need to say many things about this place as it is already well-known. Serves authentic Chinese at a decent price. Their ambience isn't that good but food definitely is, even more for the quantity. You can try anything out here and won't be disappointed really. 
Only thumbs down I find is that nowadays they are running out of noodles as early as 9p.m. which is why customers have to settle for other options like rice noodles or either leave the place to dine somewhere else (as I observed). They need to keep more quantity in stock as noodles definitely is one of their bestselling items.
Otherwise, a big thumbs-up!

Mandarin....Needless to say any new words about this decades old eatery at the crossing of Sarat Bose Road & Southern Avenue...Serving quality with quantity (Huge) without burning pocket. I ate here at least 10 times before with a smile coz of its value for money. Service is quite quick. Chicken asparagus soup we took as appetiser along with garlic prawn. Prawn sizes are decently big. Both are really good. Chilli Garlic chicken & mixed fried rice are also at par with our expectation.

Mandarin Restaurant is owned by the same lady who runs other authentic Chinese restaurants in Calcutta-Kim Ling,Beijing and Tung Fong.

While the "Tangra style" or Szechuan style of Chinese is spiced up to suit most Calcuttan's palates,there is the blander authentic Cantonese style which is appreciated by quite a few people like me.
Mandarin is one such joint in Calcutta that specialises in the milder Cantonese style.

Soup lovers can start off their meal with the Clear Soup or the Sweet Corn Chicken Soup.
Being a regular here,I no longer have to explore the menu as I've found my match- Mixed Cantonese Chow with a side of dry Chilli Chicken/Pepper Garlic Chicken.

The Mixed Cantonese Chow is actually the "gravy noodles" that we all are familiar with. It contains ample amounts of sliced vegetables,chicken and shrimp and is suffecient for two.

The dry Chilli Chicken consists of crisp fried chicken,stirred with whole chillies and sauted onions. The Chilli Pepper Garlic Chicken is prepated similarly.
The spiciness of the chilis pokes one's palate while the crispiness of the Chicken is in symphony with the smoothness of the Chow and its constituents.

Located at the crossing of Sarat Bose Avenue and Southern Avenue,beside the petrol pump,this place has a nostalgic charm associated with it,along with the Chinese designs carved out on the wooden partitions.
The seating arrangement is certainly cramped with four tables having sofas for a more comfortable seating.

Over more than a decade now I've been visiting this place and the taste and their quality has remained constant,my only grievance being that their prices are on the higher side now.

But one thing is guaranteed- quality,authentic Cantonese Chinese food.

Mandarin - Old is still maintaining it's charm.
=====
Location & Intro:¬†

Mandarin is located in Southern Avenue Area. If you know Marco Polo, it won't be difficult for you to locate this place. Else, it is located on the road opposite to Go Lebanese, Southern Avenue Outlet. Very easy to locate.¬†

I had been here with two of my friends to try out some food. Mandarin has been an old name in the city of joy and have been serving Indo-Chinese food ever since.¬†
=====
What i ordered:

‚Ä¢ Egg Clear Soup - We were three and they were courteous enough to divide it into three. Usually, one is to two happens but this time one is to three. Haha.

‚Ä¢ Egg Hakka Noodles - The noodles were silky and lovable. I loved on this one.

‚Ä¢ Chicken Fried Rice - The fried rice was nice. The way i wanted it. Cooked to perfection. It was a nomnom experience.¬†

‚Ä¢ Garlic Chicken Half Plate - The tangra style. Half plate means half plate here. Nonetheless, loved on this one too. Ample quantity to satiate the palate as well as the protruding belly. ¬†

The quantity was great for all the dishes.¬†
=====
Pros:¬†

‚Ä¢ Old School Charm.
‚Ä¢ Ambiance is great.
‚Ä¢ Reasonably priced.
‚Ä¢ Great quantity at affordable prices.
=====
Meal for two: 400-1000 approximate (Prices are subject to change due to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, etc)

Summary:

Food Quality 4/5

Food Quantity 4.2/5

Taste 4.2/5

Presentation 4.1/5

I have been visiting mandarin since I was a child . Probably from the age of 2 and I have always always loved their Chinese. Their Chinese has a distinct taste which I can never forget . Over the years that taste has remained the same and there has been absolutely no change in the establishmeny except for the opening of new outlets in different parts of the city . My favourites from this joint are , "Chicken sweet corn soup", "Chicken and mushroom soup" , "Asparagus soup" , "Honey chicken" , "Schezwan chicken"
, "Schezwan fish", "Cantonese style noodles" , "American chopsuey" and "Mixed fried rice" .

They certainly make the best chicken sweet corn soup in the city . All the other soups I've stated are just as good. Their gravy Cantonese style noodles is typical of this place . All their food items are sufficient in terms of quantity. This is my go to place for when I fall ill and desire a piping hot bowl of soup . I could have half their serving of soup all by myself .....it's that good. Do try out this place. The quality of their takeaways is the same . You might find the restaurant crowded on occassions , in such a case you can reserve a table before coming or order take away after reaching in case you want to dine at home . Highly recommended for the days you crave soul food like chinese.

One of friend was on fast and wanted to have nice chinese food for his iftaar. So I took him to this place which is legendary. It was almost 6.15pm and three tables were full and my expectations from this place risen up. We ordered crispy chilli baby corn and mixed chownein. The crispy baby corn were neither crispy nor chilli. There were only cut pieces of green chillies. And the baby corn were thick and golden. The chownein was very oily and the noodles strings were all broken. Very disheartening and lost my face to my friend.

If you seek Chinese food that will fill your stomach and warm your heart, look no further than Mandarin. Their food has always reminded me of a hug - something you keep coming back to. We usually pack food to eat at home - our go to items are the chilli chicken dry, the chicken chowmein and the chicken fried rice. All the dishes are prepared with extremely generous amounts of both chicken and spice - which make them perfect in my eyes! The chilli chicken features huge pieces of crispy, spicy chicken accompanied by delicious chopped chillies and fried onions, which I eat with as much avidity as the chicken itself! The chowmein and fried rice are both warm, flavourful, spicy and super filling. Quantities of everything are massive, and the prices can't be beat. 
I tell you, for simple, delicious comfort food, this place can't be beat. Try it out for yourself.

Placed at the junction between southern avenue and Lansdown road, rather on the Lansdown road, a small, age old place serving the chinese cuisine. Sadly they don't serve pork unlike other old chinese joints in kolkata. The interior is small actually, but neat and clean. Gives an odor of chinese food as soon as you enter. The best point is the hospitality. They are master in it. And the food amount- like half plate is enough for two person. We had chicken hot and sour soup, turned out to be quite filling- more thick, less watery. Prawn and chicken dishes were good. Hakka chow could have been cooked a little more. Rice was okayish. Had a good and late sunday lunch.

Used to visit Mandarin quite often 6-7 years ago with friends. Being so close to southern Avenue, it used to attract a lot of foodies. Certainly that doesn't seem to be the case now. Went there few months for a dinner. Was mostly disappointed to see `No Debit / Credit cards accepted' ( It was just a month of so before the demonetisation drive). Staffs mostly don't have a clue, what's in the menu or what's available. They@ clarify, verify again and again. Coming to food, we ordered mixed hakka noodles, pan fried rice and prawn Manchu Rian which were all delicious and the quantity was good. Yet I feel the place has detoriated tremendously amidst the cut throat competition from places nearby.

Mandarin opened its shutters way back in 1969 when the only food hub of Kolkata was Park Street, and Chinese joints implied Waldorf and Peiping on Park St., Erose behind Society cinema, Chung Wa on Central Avenue and Nan King near Poddar Court. The joint had its ups and downs but really looked up since its takeover by the family that owns Beijing and Kim Ling in China Town and Tung Fong on Free School St. Signature dishes: Thai soup, hot and sour soup, Cantonese noodles, Cantonese rice (both outstanding, non-spicy, yet deliciously tasty; very few Indians would like the taste though), lemon chilli chicken to name a few. Excellent helpings. Negative - Pork withdrawn from the menu since take-over.....

Mandarin has been around for ages and undoubtedly one of the more revered food joints in the South Kolkata region.. This is one of those flag-bearers of Indo-Chinese cuisines which marked the continuing popularity and mass appeal this cuisine have in the food map of the city.. Located just next to the Petrol Pump in Southern Avenue- Sarat Bose Road crossing, easiest to locate..

Ambiance hasn‚Äôt changed much over the year, still the same I used to see during my childhood visits, the chinese fans and the alphabets in the partitions in sync with the cuisine served.. Got a chance to get a take-away after a long time and there can‚Äôt be a better way to reminisce over childhood memories than to indulge in some all-time favorite dishes:

Mixed Hakka Noodles: Portions were sufficient to feed 2-3 people if you are having some additional starters/ side dishes with the same.. Loved the presence of ample proteins, however only issue was the extra-oil dripping which kinda makes the whole affair a bit unhealthy..

Mixed Fried Rice: Tastewise similar to the noodles but much better in terms that there weren‚Äôt any extra oil dripping and the portion was huge..

Manchurian Fish: You taste this dish in almost every other Chinese eatery of the city and you come here and feel that the authentic taste and originality in sauce one can savor here is truly unmatched..

Chilli Garlic Chicken: Ordered the gravy style and sure it didn‚Äôt disappoint either.. Good to see they have maintained atleast the old flavors and taste of their dishes.. Loved the punch of the dish..

Overall, the one thing which hurts is to see the prices going way north while they can hardly maintain the old magic and quality.. Still they do balance the ever-increasing prices with the generous portion which is indeed a relief for foodies like me.. Our total cheque was Rs. 1050/- (all incl.) for the 4 dishes..

Food: 4/5

Pricing: 3.5/5

Service: 3.5/5

Ambiance: 3/5

It's one of those restaurants that serves very very tasty Chinese food typical of Kolkata. Their quantity is huge. Absolutely worth every bit of the money. 
I ordered chicken sweet corn soup , chicken fried rice and honey chicken.
They served a gigantic Bowl of tasty sweet corn soup that was full of big shredded pieces of chicken.
The honey chicken was crispy and sweet. Very tasty.
Their chicken fried rice was of course served in great proportions and each ingredient in it was in generous proportions and sizes.
Perfect place for a casual meal especially because of its homely ambience.

This place has always been my comfort place to go along with my mum anytime anyday and satisfy myself with warm Chinese ! I have been to this place since childhood and have tried almost their everything ! My favourites are their Cantonese Noodles ,their Mixed Hakka Noodles (for that smoky smell) and any kind of side dishes are cooked to the perfection that absolutely goes with the staples pretty well ! Their quantity is sufficient for 2.5 people (speaking of 1plate of the staples and side dish well 16 pieces that's enough for like 3/4 people) [obviously that is subject to the respective persons' appetite] 
Just one negetive thing I would like to say is that the tend to use too much oil at times if not mentioned beforehand !
But whatever be it Mandarin and it's chinese will always be my comfort place and food !
Also since by now all the staffs know us extremely well they are really very courteous ( even the newly appointed ones are equally ) 
Pinch on the pocket well it might be a lil just a lil high but then keeping in mind everything that is never an issue !

Mandarin has been around for ages and undoubtedly one of the more revered food joints in the South Kolkata region.. This is one of those flag-bearers of Indo-Chinese cuisines which marked the continuing popularity and mass appeal this cuisine have in the food map of the city.. Located just next to the Petrol Pump in Southern Avenue- Sarat Bose Road crossing, easiest to locate..

Ambiance hasn‚Äôt changed much over the year, still the same I used to see during my childhood visits, the chinese fans and the alphabets in the partitions in sync with the cuisine served.. Got a chance to get a take-away after a long time and there can‚Äôt be a better way to reminisce over childhood memories than to indulge in some all-time favorite dishes:

Mixed Hakka Noodles: Portions were sufficient to feed 2-3 people if you are having some additional starters/ side dishes with the same.. Loved the presence of ample proteins, however only issue was the extra-oil dripping which kinda makes the whole affair a bit unhealthy..

Mixed Fried Rice: Tastewise similar to the noodles but much better in terms that there weren‚Äôt any extra oil dripping and the portion was huge..

Manchurian Fish: You taste this dish in almost every other Chinese eatery of the city and you come here and feel that the authentic taste and originality in sauce one can savor here is truly unmatched..

Chilli Garlic Chicken: Ordered the gravy style and sure it didn‚Äôt disappoint either.. Good to see they have maintained atleast the old flavors and taste of their dishes.. Loved the punch of the dish..

Overall, the one thing which hurts is to see the prices going way north while they can hardly maintain the old magic and quality.. Still they do balance the ever-increasing prices with the generous portion which is indeed a relief for foodies like me.. Our total cheque was Rs. 1050/- (all incl.) for the 4 dishes..

Food: 4/5

Pricing: 3.5/5

Service: 3.5/5

Ambiance: 3/5

Ambience and decor is average with limited sitting arrangements.

Service is swift.

Tried Mixed Rice Noodles & Chilli Pepper Garlic Fish. Noodles was nice made with nice stuffings. Fish was spicy, flavourful and lip smacking.

Pocket pinch is reasonable along with ample quantity.

I ordered food from this old and esteemed joint yesterday and faced my worst food related disappointments ever. First time in my life I saw peas being used in a Chinese fried rice. On top of that it was an under-cooked bland preparation where you can smell each n every vegetable separately in a bad way. The Hakka chow was slightly better because it had a burnt feel to it - quite a few of noodles were actually black. It was more like thela noodles n rice at 5 times the price..

Mandarin is the legendary outlet for Chinese.
I have been to this place many times and took home delivery numerous times.
This place serves one of the best Chinese in the city without digging holes on your pocket.
Fish Manchurian and Golden Fried Prawns are my top most favorite dish of this place.

Ambiance: Basic
Staff: Okay
Service: Good
Food: Excellent.

Cons: If you need a nice pleasant ambiance to enjoy a fine fine dining then this place is definitely of not your choice. This is just a plain and simple Chinese Eatery.

An old shabby restaurant, Mandarin is strictly meant for indo-Chinese lovers.

We tried Pepper chili garlic chicken which tasted like a spicy chicken pakoda....too spicy for our Palate. Then came the Mixed Fried rice soaked in oil. We appreciate the quantity of the dish and the amount of chicken and prawn they put in it...but Mandarin should realise that this amount of oil is harmful to health. The rice was complemented with lemon chicken, which again was too sweet. What we feel is they need to update themselves..both in terms of food and service.

They have a good number of followers as evident from the footfall even at weekday lunch. We wish them good luck.

They were about to close , but it was so nice of them that they didn't return us , rather they gave us a warm welcome and offered us to have a seat. Apart from this , the Chinese dish we ordered was lovely and delicious. We would like to give a visit again to this place. The behaviour of the staffs were so nice and pleasant.
Thank you.

On 13th November - Sunday evening I and my wife came here to have our dinner. It is located just beside the petrol pump station at the junture of Sarat Bose Road and Lake Road.The ambience is old style, bit dark but not gloomy. The location is excellent and keeping in mind the restaurant management must give it a make over.
Now coming to the food, we ordered a small Chicken Sweet Corn Soup and a Mixed Chinese Chopsuey. We didnot have to wait much long and the soup was served first. To our surprise the small soup was served in a large bowl and we two almost have had one and half times each in a regular size soup bowl. The soup tasted good with good quantity of chicken and sweet corn, so 4 out of 5 I will rate the soup.
The Chinese Chopsuey was somewhat OK with fresh soft chicken and prawn, but the vegetables such as mushrooms, babycorn, spring onions were missing, instead we got ridged gourd with other vegetables. It would have been better if the gravy mix was served separately instead all in one bowl. I will give 2.5 out of 5.
I will again visit the restaurant to try their main dishes for which they are famous.

One of the old chinese gems of Kolkata. Great quality chinese food at very reasonable prices. The chicken and fish dishes are excellent. The noodles and rice dishes are also very good, I specially love their rice noodles. Quantity is great in the dishes, in a full plate of chicken there are 16 pcs. and for those who don't need so much quantity half plate is also available which is an added advantage. The ambience isn't much to brag about but you won't be disappointed after spending money on the food here.

One of the oldest place to have chinese in Kolkata, this place has been around for some decades. My family used to visit here when I was little. Recently had a chance to go to the place a few weeks back.

The place is a very small joint with no special ambiance, the place is quite old and you will feel that when you enter.¬†

Coming to the food... this place always served great chinese food with large quantity. though in my opinion the price could have been a little less. We ordered mixed fried rice, lemon chicken and spring fried chicken for starters. The food was tasty but the presentation could have been a little better.

The main Problem about this place is that they do not accept any debit or credit card.. its my humble request to the management to accept these because they are part of our regular daily transactions.

Overall rating.... good place to try chinese food.... but remember to bring cash.. Happy Eating... :P

This is another Indo-Chinese restaurant in the city that serves affordable and tasty Chinese food. The sitting arrangement is comfortable and you can go in big groups of friends and family. ¬†The waiters are friendly and helpful. The service was a little slow, but as it was during the busy puja time, I did not expect it to be quicker.
The portions were pretty huge for two of us.
We ordered chicken mushroom soup, lemon chicken and mixed gravy chow. The lemon chicken was pretty good. The rest were loaded with cornflour gravy and a little bland in taste which I definitely don't prefer. ¬†Both the soup and chow were loaded with chicken, prawn and veggies.
It is a good option if you are in that area and want to go for a quick meal. Otherwise, this is not a place that you must visit.

This the first authentic Chinese restaurant that was opened in Kolkata by a Chinese business woman, Monica. So, you can expect the authentic taste of Chinese food here. One of the most popular and crowdy places in Kolkata. This place is now a bit old and savvy and needs renovation. But there is no compromise with the taste. I simply love the food of Mandarin.One of the signature dish is the Hakka style Crispy Chilly Babycorn

Located just behind the petrol pump of Southern Avenue.. We visited on a Sunday evening and to my surprise it was almost empty... I visited the Mudiali branch quite a number of times and they had never disappoint me so I thought the same for this branch.. I was wrong.. Coming to the decor the first thing came to my mind is tables were not properly cleaned. Secondly,. I asked them to change our table as the restaurant was almost empty and we were only two of us but they refused to do so. Lastly the Steward serving us was rude, I think he was just waiting for us to leave.. The only thing I like was the food.. ¬†I gave them 3 stars only for their food and nothing else..

Not going to this branch again..

Its real time to buck up. One thing i like about the restaurant is there service. The people r very soft spoken and dedicated, swift.

Location- Exactly at the crossing of southern avenue. Situated at the foot path connecting a petrol pump.
Ambience- could be far better.
order- hakka noodles, garlic chicken (gravy), Schezwan chicken (dry), Fried rice
Taste- over all good. Didn't like the noodles at all.
Pocket pinch- almost 1500 for 6 people.
suggestions- staff could be more attentive and more friendly. Some decorations needed.

Mandarin is a small cosy little restaurant in the southern avenue. Affordable and authentic chinese good is what they provide their customers with. The decor is quite minimal and simple.  The staffs are helpful and friendly. The food is quite tasty and has  a authentic chinese taste to it with the perfect blend of East Asian flavours. The place is quite easy on the pocket as well. The quality and the quantity of the food is pretty good. Overall we had a good experience at this food joint. :)

Affordable and tasty Chinese food is what you get here. Food is a little bit oily but that can be overlooked. The quantity served here is too much. Had gone there with a friend recently and we couldn't finish everything that we had ordered. We had had the chicken and mushroom clear soup,egg fried rice and chicken with button mushrooms. We had ordered half plates of the side dishes and still it was more than we could have. The soup was good with a clear consistency and ample pieces of chicken and mushroom. We had approx 2 small bowls of the soup each,taken out from the serving bowl. The fried rice was good too. The chicken with button mushrooms was a mistake. It was a white sauce based dish and didn't go with the rice at all. I ordered it nevertheless because I was in the mood for mushrooms. Had a good time chatting away and eating till our tummies were stuffed and full.

I had eaten here 7 years back went back with my daughter this year horrible food is an understatement and service is so bad that I felt like coming out with any tips

A famous dish of Tangra pepper chilli garlic chicken was so hard and burnt that I could hardly eat 2 pieces.

Will never visit again

Yet another addition to my list of favourites. 
Coming from Desapriya Park, keep walking towards Rabindra Sarovar, crossing most of the famous cafe and restaurants on the way, Mandarin falls on your right exactly where the road diverges. 
They have tried their best to maintain the chinese atmosphere of the restaurant. Staff there being really friendly.
The quantity of the food is good enough so is the quality. Moreover, being pocket friendly.

My childhood memories are all here. Probably the best Thai Soup I've had. Although I prefer the Southern Avenue old branch food standard more than the new Lake Avenue or Mudiali one. 
The decor in the old one has a nice feeling which adds to the ambience!

A very old Chinese restaurant at South Kolkata, located near rabindra sarobar. I like their food, having it from couple of decades. They have not changed at all in the entire period. Quantity is very good compared to the price they charge. They operate with some constraints in their menu. Their menu operates around chicken, prawn and fish. They don't serve pork. But whatever they dish out has got very good taste and presentation is nice too. Especially enjoy having dry chilly chicken out there.. Its awesome !!

Honey Chicken was little more sweet than it actually should have been though the crisp was okay. The gravy items in the main course are luscious.

Visited this restaurant with family and cousins. We'd ordered chicken clear soup, fried chicken, chili fish and veg hakka chow which had been pleasantly satisfying and palatable. For standard regular Chinese items Mandarin can be opted for. However, classy ambiance is not to be expected for the restaurant fails in the interior decor department. Also the place's crammed with insufficient space to add up to it.

At a very prominent location of sarat Bose road,this restaurant is a very old and well known restaurant.thou it's a bit crampy inside and doesn't much boast on the d√©cor but yet a decent one.
The food is not overpriced and tastes good and quantity was enough..it was just another Sunday and we entered at the peak time,t o celebrate my aunt's anniversary.
We had ordered thai soup and mushroom chicken thick soup. In the main course it was mixed fried rice,manchurian chicken,sweet and sour chicken and chili garlic fish.. food was decent and tasty thou I personally felt that the rice was a bit undercooked.
 Nevertheless it was okay.

I have been going to Mandarin ever since I was a child. It is strategically located on the main road at southern avenue, right beside the petrol pump. Being on of the oldest Chinese restaurants in Kolkata, it has been an integral part of Kolkata's Chinese eating culture. At one point of time this was the only Chinese eatery at southern avenue and one of the handful in south kolkata. This joint was the go to place for any kind of celebration. From birthday's to post exam celebration i have been to this eatery on a numerous occasions. This place holds a thousand memories for me. Mandarin at one point was distinguished in Indo-Chinese preparations. I call it indo chinese to separate it from the generation of oriental cuisine that has recently come up in the city. But the quality has deteriorated over the years. While service is okish, interiors are quite unimpressive. I hope and urge them to improve, because this a place very special to my heart!

Located at the junction between sarat Bose road and southern avenue, mandarin is one of the oldest Chinese places in the area. 
The ambiance isn't their plus and the place is cramped, dominated by red interiors and pretty average in the interior department.
The food here is standard Chinese fare. 
The chilli mushroom, Paneer chilli and garlic fried rice are worth a mention. 
The food is good bit definitely you expect tangra style Chinese to shine in their cooking, which isn't the case here.
The service is a problem and the staff seems very laid back.

Overall pretty average

Food was good.The service was horrid. Went for lunch had, half thai soup, Cantonese chow and sweet and sour prawns.The portions were so large that two of us couldn't finish it.
The waiters sneer and scowl at you and seems to be reluctant and displeased to serve.They look and behave more like professional goons rather than service  staff.
Somehow the place gives you a feeling that it has outlived its time.

Been visiting this joint for years. Its been my family's favourite for over 35 years now. Situated right in the heart of south kolkata, between the rabindra sarobar and deshapriya park route, dining here has always been a pleasing experience for me. You would rarely find this joint deserted coz it stays packed most of the time. 
Some of you might not like the food given its not too spicy, and term it as bland. Its not indian chinese, as they have their own traditional set of recipes each of which I am a huge fan. They are a pro in cooking rice dishes. Few favourite sides according to me are the chicken manchurian n sweet and sour chicken. Their fish n chicken pakoras will escalate your hunger even more. The cantonese chow is a must try. The honey chicken, was the one n only disappointment so far. Also for winters, their chicken n sweet corn clear soups are all you need. Satisfying and not too hard on the budget. They give the best in return for the money they charge.

To start off with, this restro is located on a very prominent location on Southern Avenue. The ambience and interior was plain old Chinese. I liked the simplicity of this restro. Now about the food, food was good. We ordered fried chicken, chicken Cantonese chow, mixed fried rice and chilli garlic chicken. We ordered lemon soda but was turned down because of it's  unavailability . The fried chicken was like KFC chicken popcorn without spices. The noodles and rice was good. Chicken tasted ok. It's totally value for money restro because of the overwhelming quantity. Totally worth 3.5!

Growing up in south Kolkata in the late 80's you were sure to have been dragged here at some point of time. It was the only Chinese restaurant in the locality then and I remember how their Hakka noodles had more oil than noodles. Somewhere in 2000's it took a turn for the better and complete revamped it's food. It now serves affordable Chinese which is reasonably good.

I believe this is one of the oldest Chinese restaurants of Kolkata.. No problem with the location since its on the main road.. Just beside the petrol pump in Southern Avenue. The interior is very simply done and yes there is a major space crunch.. Never sit on the left hand side of the counter because of a leaking AC.. It has been the same over the years with no change at all!!!!!!!! 

Coming to the food part.. The quality has gone down but yes is much better than many other good Chinese outlets in the city.. You can swear by the quantity.. One full Thai soup should be enough for 4 people.. My favourite is the Thai soup and the dry chilly pepper chicken..  I always prefer a takeaway nowadays from this place since am not too ok with the cleanliness . Oh yes.. Don't forget cash while visiting the place since they still do not accept a card ! üòä

Happy Eating üòä

If you had parents who loved food, chances are you are one big foodie too and were raised around some of the best food at home and in town.

One of the best memories of Chinese food I have as a child was of Mandarin. I remember queuing in front of their doors every Durga Puja, as group after group poured in to Southern Avenue, just to get their Puja night treats at the Mandarin Restaurant.

It is the first place ever I had Chicken Sweet Corn Soup in and was regularly amazed by the big bowl they served the soups in. Unlike many other Chinese eateries, Mandarin uses short grain rice for their rice dishes. The rice is fragrant, has a nice oily shine to it and is so flavorsome. The Cantonese noodles have been a great hit with the family always, as well.

Another must order is the Golden fried prawns. The prawns are delicate and buttery. They will melt in the mouth after you devour the airy, crispy batter. The Pepper chilli garlic chicken and the chilli garlic chicken are great, so are the chilli fish and drums of heaven.

If you are looking for a casual lunch or a hearty dinner, drop in any time for some decent Chinese.

I've been to Mandarin many times now, this restaurant being a family favourite of sorts. It's always rather crowded with patrons, and Pujas will have you see long, serpentine queues outside this place. The ambience isn't much to talk about, but it's nothing bad either, it's just busy and hustling with activities that have something or the other to do with all things food. The tables inside are placed rather close, so one might get the definite feeling of being cramped for space.
Coming to the food, Mandarin serves good quality Indian Chinese. Take note of the quantities, for the full plate can actually serve two people. I personally love their pepper chilli garlic chicken- a dry chicken dish, full of spices and condiments that entice the taste buds. The standard fare of lemon chicken, chilli fish and all taste good enough here. Prices are reasonable, if you consider the quantity in a full order of a dish. 
Edit - The Chicken with Mushroom and Vegetable was a hidden wonder. You'll love it if you like simple, not-spicy-at-all food.

Located at the southern avenue crossing turn if you are coming from Golpark side just beside the petrol pump. Easy to locate as it's situated on the main road itself.

The decor and ambiance is pretty simple and they kept a similarity between the cuisine and theme. Although the place has space crunch to dine in but manageable.

Coming to the food part I would say they were one of the finest once upon a time. Even though the quantity remains the same but the quality has gone down with times that's what is not expected in this competitive times. 
My opinion would be working on the taste and quality can bring back their old reputation again otherwise people has a lot of options like this.
Service is a bit to slow but still manageable. A change or updation in their regular old rules can bring back the charm into the staffs as well to perform better day by day.

The food quantity is ample, however the quality has gone downhill. :( The chilli fish here is really good. Must try. :) Also, don't be a glutton like me and order a full dish for 2 people. I had to pack most of it back home. :p (16 pieces. No kidding!) Price is very reasonable though.

Ok so Mandarin is quite close to my house and this place has hosted us from the time when my school mates and I used to accumulate pocket money to have some 'Chinese food'. Well, times have changed and we have grown richer since then. However, Mandarin has hardly changed. The quantity of the food, the quality and the ambience continues to make us nostalgic...Love the huuge portion of garlic chicken and the mixed rice! There's an old fella who is courteous and great at suggesting dishes! 
My only wish.. Times have changed. 
Can we feel this down here sometime?

Located at the Southern avenue-lake crossing.

An old place with an old interior as they have not even thought about improving or going for a makeover.

The menu is obviously chinese as is suggested by the name.

Once, they were a place with good quality taste and quantity and then they have been on the downfall and except fr the cantonese noodles we just don't have anything much to talk about.

Serious time for a rethinking to be done.

This place has been around for so so long now. And why not.....no doubt about the fact that they dish out some of the best Chinese delicacies in town. The quality and the quantity is astoundingly good....way beyond what many can even imagine to do. 
The aroma and the flavours of their Chinese dishes are near perfect. We have ordered from here many a time and even been here for a dine out. The service is very efficient. 
The food is beyond words. Our latest order was for Chicken Hakka Noodles, Prawn fried Rice, Chilli Chicken, Manchurian Chicken and Golden Fried Prawns. 
Each and every dish was almost perfect....my mouth waters even while writing this review. Those who have not visited this place should do so...I'm sure they will not be disappointed. This flavour of the noodles and the rice is so good that you do not need to add sauces.....if you do, be warned that the unique flavour would be gone. The Golden fried Prawns were fried just the right amount. Chilli Chicken from here has always been one of my favourites. The Manchurian Chicken was just as it should be, not the type that is served at many places where they end up making a confused variety of it. 
Just love the food here....it is my 'go to' place for Chinese.

After hearing a lot about the restaurant, i dined in mandarin. The ambience of the restaurant was average, but on the same hand it gives an old & aesthetic look, so it feels different. The Food quality was good and unexpectedly quite authentic. It was, the closest to the finest & authentic Chinese i have had in Kolkata. Overall it was a decent dinner experience.¬†Not to miss out, dishes were well portioned and decently priced. Therefore i have rated it ¬†3.0 and would recommend for a casual and decent dinner experience.

This is the first time I had dined in Mandarin. I have heard so much about this place that I decided to go there finally. Well, the visit was not satisfactory. First of all, I found the restaurant over hyped. The quantity of the food might be okay, but it does not suffice the quality. We ordered mixed hakka noodles which was averagely decent. Then we had half plate of pepper chicken, which was surprisingly nice. Them we had dry chilli chicken, which we thought would be the show stopper, wad a disaster: bland in taste with excess oil and almost no seasoning. We also ordered fresh lime soda, but was shocked to know it was not available. But we saw seven up bottles, lemons in the freeze. A below average experience.

One of the old Chinese restaurant with great ambiance . Menu options and service is  good . Quantity served is so huge that half a plate of main course gravy can be shared by two.we had ordered fried rice , veg Manchurian and fish Manchurian, everything was nicely prepared.

If you have less amount of money in your pockets and you are very hungry this can be your destination. I loved the place as they served large quantity of food in a reasonable price. The food was not that bad, I liked it though. Many people do complain about the food but I liked it maybe because I was way too hungry to decide on the quality and focused on only the quantity. The ambiance is not something to mention about. My advice is you can try out this place.

This restaurant turned out to be a big dissapointment for us..We ordered for both takeaway as well as dine in..

For dine-in,we had soups and starters,

Veg Hot and sour soup-It had no salt at all...Since we ordered for less spicy...They had made it a little sweet..Overall it lacked flavour.

Kung pao Chicken-The chicken was good but a bit too greasy for my tastebuds...The quantity was huge..

Prawn Pepper Chilli Garlic-The prawns were big but it was over fried to dark brown and thus tasted a little bitter for the overcooked batter...It was on the burnt side...The prawns were chewy and overcooked..

Spring Potato-This was crispy golden brown in colour and tasted as good as it looked..

As we were too full with starters,we packed the main course and ate at home..

For mains,we had:-

Chicken Rice noodles-This tasted like some roadside noodles...full of oil and no flavour at all..

Chicken in Hot Garlic sauce-This turned out to be STALE!!!AND HAD TO BE THROWN AWAY IMMEDIATELY...

Garlic Tofu-This tasted average but had too much oil...

Quite dissapointed with my experience!!!

This is one of the oldest joints of Kolkata. We tried their fried Chicken. It was good. In the main course, I loved their chicken Manchurian.
Beware of the quantity. They serve 16 pieces in one full plate.¬†

The food still holds its own against other places there is a subtle hint of quality to it which differentiates this place from others, ambience is slightly on the lower side but the pricing and quality of food along with quick service make the place a good one.

Chinese lovers do give a visit to this restaurant. Trust me you guys wont be deceived. Though the outlook may be a bit shabby and doesnt have that glittering or sparkling wow factor look like the other restaurants but they kick the other restaurants back with the quality and quantity of food they give. Please try the Fried Chicken; they are just heavenly awesome. A total fan of their Fried Chicken. We also ordered chic.fried rice,chili chic. and manchurian chic. They too were good but the Fried Chicken just snatched the main attraction. Will visit this place soon.

This was after soo long and a meal I thoroughly enjoyed till the last bite and kept craving for more. This is Monica Liu of the Kimling, Beijing and Tung Fong fame, and one her oldest joints Mandarin, established in 1969. Called for a portion of mixed fried rice, that was so flavourful and fragrant best enjoyed as is without any gravy or side! The dark chili honey chicken was sticky, honey coated fried and garnished with sesame seeds. Crispy chicken with ginger and chillies had large slices of ginger, juliennes of green chillies and fried with lots onions. No sauce, which made made it even better! This meal from Mandarin was my own airburobhat treat to myself and I'm so happy I can't explain! 

Service - Service was prompt and friendly. It was a take away so when I went in to order, the ambiance, the legendary charm, the aroma of it was enticing. Had a nice chat with the staff about influence of Chinese cuisine in Kolkata, food festivals and other restaurants of Monica Liu! The food took about 15 mins to be ready and we packed it all. The overall experience was nostalgic and I would love to go back there!

I remember Mandarin serving good food in the past, which is the expectation we went with (the decor and ambience are nothing to write home about). We ordered 3 items and all ranged from very-average to downright terrible. That may have been a one-off and could have certainly been forgiven, but the service was so bad I have to make a mention. The food was mostly uneaten and we wanted it parcelled so as to not waste it. The waiter mumbled something about 'etho' when I asked for my plate to be parcelled and actually brought an empty paper box to the table and waited for me to empty the contents from my plate into the box. He seemed unwilling to even wrap a rubber band around the box so I did that myself as well. I was so irritated about the lousy food and service that I walked out after paying the bill, but in retrospect I should have had a word with the Manager. Absolutely never going back.

Slightly thick noodles with sticky gravy,bits of greens,chunks of white roasted chicken,boiled shrimps etc make up the amazing cantonese chowmein.

The chill chicken is solid boneless pieces,not black by use of too much soya sauce but light brown,lightly fried,lots of capsicum,light gravy and deliciously chopped green chilli.

Friends, for a fifty year old restaurant to still have queues outside every evening with hundreds of wannabes opening up all around,is nothing short of the endorsement of what authentic Kolkata Chinese tastes and tasted like.

Purists might have a million comments to make but for devoted foodies like us Mandarin remains a name which wets your mouth every time the name is mentioned.

We had a lunch at the time of puja. The place is good but a bit small. The manager was  amazing but food was not. We ordered fish chilly with mixed rice as well as schezawn chicken with rice noodles. What they plated was fish in tomato sauce and chicken in schezawn sauce both half cooked. Noodles and rice were carelessly prepared. I would not like to visit again for food.

I've passed across this restaurant for several times since my childhood, but never got a chance to visit it once, until a few days back when me and my friends were looking for a pocket friendly restaurant to save us from pangs of hunger.

This looks like an old school Chinese food joint. Not so spacious, and tables cramped up with little space to move.

Moving on to the food. We had Noodles, and chicken sides. The quantity was good, but thumbs down for the quality. The noodles was a but bland and oily. The chickens were heavily coated, and the gravy didn't quite taste good.

Maybe considering the prices, the quantity is good, but food quality needs to improve.

Every person, weather Chinese lover or not should visit here atleast once in his life. Mandarin, down the ages had been handed down to too many owners, but the quality and portions have never been compromised.
The d√©cor is not very pompous, but will definitely give you warmth.

Went with my friend at MahaSaptami night. The queue outside was long enough. We though asked for a parcel. My friend's home was nearby. It took us half a hour to return from a visit to a puja pandal. By then our order was ready. We ordered for a Prawn fried rice, Chicken Cantonese noodles and garlic chicken. Many of the dishes were unavailable due to puja rush, but the real disappointment was when we returned to home. The quantity of noodle was scanty enough, mostly because of the occasion of puja. The prawn fried rice was good but the garlic chicken was a disaster. The dish is not palatable. The restaurant is undoubtedly renowned but in puja it didn't live upto its name. Looking for a better experience in next visit.

I visited this place for the first time on saptami evening with my friends...¬†

Decoration : Very old.. very cheap decoration... it high time it needs a reformation....¬†

Food : ¬†we were a gang of 5... so we ordered 2 mix noodles, 1 cantonese chicken noodles and 1 full plate Garlic Fish.... usually 2 mix noodles are enough for 3 people in these kind of chinese restaurant... but unfortunately it was not enough so we had to order 1 more mix noodles and 1 half plate chilli chicken....¬†

Mix Noodles : Tasted good enough
Cantonese noodles : i did not taste it.. my friend did.. he said the taste was ok... but not the quantity... i dont know if it was due to puja rush...
Garlic Fish : Though my friend liked it.. but i did not... it was very less spicy...
Chilli Chicken : Again the problem was it was not spicy at all..¬†

Price : the price was moderate... a full plate of garlic fish or chilli chicken consist of 16 pieces.. so its cost 410... so i would like to suggest people not to order full plate if u r not in a gang of 4 or u can't eat like beast...

Service : Not bad...they were quick... but some waiters looked little confused....

other Cons : Ambience is not very good.. may be coz of the bad decoration... and the restaurant payment policy still is in stone age.. they dont accept card... so if u visit this place.. make sure u have enough cash....

Over all : As a cheap chinese restaurant... it works...

Its usually a sat or a sunday dinner.
The menu is always the same which we order.

Konjee crispy lamb..chili dry pepper chickn , pan fried fish for starters.
Then on the main course their staple mixed hakka noodles and a mixed fried rice along with chicken in oyester sauce or a kung pao chicken and a chilli fish..ths is wat we order evrytime.

All the dish are very nicely prepared and filled with flavour. 
The price is reasonable too.

Mandarin is a good restaurant if you really like chinese cuisine. Nothing special about it. The food is okayish but the quantity is enough to fill those hungry bellies of 2 maybe 3 foodies.

Mandarin is one of the oldest restaurants in this area. Centrally located (at the crossing of Southern Avenue and Sarat Bose Road), this restaurant has been patronised by residents of the locality for generations. It continues to offer good food at reasonable prices.

Since I live nearby, I usually order food that I can take home and consume at my leisure. I last went there 2 weeks ago and ordered mixed fried rice, mixed hakka chow mien and chilli fish. The portions were so big that my wife and I found it adequate for both  lunch and dinner!

The one item which you must try when you go there is their mixed fried rice. It contains generous portions of prawns, eggs and chicken and just melts in your mouth. Their chicken sweet corn soup is also worth having. It is also one of the few Chinese restaurants in this area which serves good Cantonese noodles as well as rice noodles.

After finishing a sumptuous meal, the bill is bound to surprise you. This restaurant is truly pocket-friendly.

I've been going to Mandarin for nearly fifteen years now. What proves that it has truly stood the test of time is that, eateries come and go in the Southern Avenue area, and their quality regularly fluctuates, but never have I had an unpleasant dining experience in Mandarin. It is quite a tiny establishment, but cosy enough. The proportions are ample, the food your typical Indian style Chinese but lip-smacking, and some of the staff are people I've always seen working there, reliable and welcoming. Not too harsh either is this place on the pocket. I have since shifted neighbourhoods, and live further away from this little charming place, but memories continue to pull me back. My regular order is the chicken sweet corn soup, honey chicken, golden fried prawn and some gravy noodles. I always leave with a smile. Try it out!

Best thing in their menu?
Their soups!!
Had many of them, and loved them all!!
Also, the quantity they give is insane!

The noodles and fried-rice are good.
But certain chicken preparations like the Spring chicken and the Hot Pepper chicken seemed too bland.

Their prawn though, tasted really good!

A good place for a nice little Chinese meal.

One of the oldest Chinese restaurant in southern avenue. Nowadys there are lots of new restaurants emerging in this area but  mandarin has maintained their standard so well that it can give anyone a tight competition. Am a great lover of their chicken mushroom thick soup since my college days.it is yummyliciously tasty n adequate in quantity. I also tried chcicken rice for once.it was so so. Another item I like is Cantonese noodles.delicious!! Pepper garlic chicken is also a good option for side dish. Overall it is a good place to have authentice Chinese dishes.

I was not aware of this place and thanks to zomato where from i learned about mandarin. A pretty easy to locate and small cosy eatery, mandarin is a prefect place to have a Chinese meal in a quiet atmosphere. The decor is not extraordinary with a few Oriental touches hither and thither, but the food is quite good. We had pepper garlic chili chicken which i liked very much, chicken pieces were tender and mildly crispy and half a serving is enough for two i presume. Rice noodles was okay and iv had much better elsewhere. We also had ordered Manchurian chicken and chili garlic chicken. The latter was very tasteful again, but the Manchurian was extremely bitter. We asked for an alteration of the dish but that too was equally bitter. Eventually the management who after actually tasting the dish offered something else in its place and we opted for chili chicken which was perfect. I somehow felt it amateurish for the managing staff to actually taste the food but since it was replaced with another dish, i don't have any complaints. The fresh lime soda they serve here has become one of my favorites. The prices are moderate considering the location and service is in fact good. The food is good, reason alone to visit it again.

Mandarin is like one household name to us & stories dates back since my childhood days when sudden Dinner plans meant mandarin ( back then KOLKATA didn't had Malls) 

order anything & mandarin will not disappoint you, one typical Chinese joint with unique aroma of varied sauces all round and freaking quantity (I mean it, literally)......Mandarin has it all to wow you out!!

Mandarin offers authentic taste, huge quantity & intelligent space management with very reasonable pricing, I guess that's enough to make one foodie happy.

Though at this age I may have tasted everything their menu has to offer but special mentions goes to THAI Soup, pepper chicken, noddles with Cantonese sauce, Manchurian chicken, jumbo prawn in hot garlic sauce, lemon chicken & this list may still go on!!!

If you're in South Kolkata & is somehow inclined to Chinese cuisine, there is no better place than this to make your tastebuds go crazy......

Mandarin, to me, is a place that my father used to take me during my school days. Hence, a lot of nostalgia is associated with this restaurant.

Though the prices have increased, the services has worsened, but the food remains the same. This is a restaurant which will not allow you to try out varieties but stick to the normal course of Chinese dishes : a soup, a starter, a main course and a side dish.

It is nice to see this restaurant in 'great chinese' collection segment.

Usual Kolkata Chinese fare drowned in gravy and smothered in cornflour.

Interiors : not so good
Food : no paneer items were available the day we went. We had mixed American chopsuey, Manchurian fish, chilli mushrooms, veg rice, cantoneese noodles. The mushroom was the best of the lot. The other dishes were decent. The quantity is praiseworthy! 
Over all a fairly OKAY experience.

Order anything with your eyes blindfolded and Mandarin will never fail to surprise you. Typically chinese essence will keep you captivated. Though located at a prominent South Kolkata locality, this restaurant has an beautiful essence which surely going to take you down the memory lane. Ambience bears marks of Chinese paintings & symbols which sure adds to the mood.
¬†Anyways food quality is too good, price is reasonable and quantity more than expectation.

One of my favourite restaurant for chinese food. Authentic chinese is what they mean and serves exactly the same. Reasonably priced, well trained staff and very good service. But this is not all, food is is simply to die for. soups are mouth watering, my all time favourite being chicken mushroom thick soup. excellent side dishes & starters like crispy fried chicken, dry chilly honey chicken( try it for sure!). Another biggest plus point is the large quantity of food they serve. Just dnt order Gravy Chowmein, they do have a tendency to burn it, faced it twice :(. Ambiance is a little congested due to the lack of space. Apart from this a must must visit if you crave for really good chinese food.

This restaurant dates back to my childhood days since I was in my primary school. Very simple decor, intelligently spaced..this restaurant specialise in Chinese cuisine.
Beware of the quantity they serve per plate, so think twice or alteast check the quantity before ordering. All the dishes I have tasted there are very good, though the soups taste different from the authentic ones. Mixed rice is of special mention and the prawn items.
Recently re-visited this place, and was astonished to find that they have not compromised with the taste neither quantity. Will visit this place again..and again..and...

An age old place having same decor since I went to KG class. Neither the outer decor nor the inner ambiance calls for any mention. The food out here is average. If you just want tasty good old kolkata chinese in HUGE quantities and REASONABLE pricing, this is the place to be. Their Servings are sure to impress anyone hungry or looking for low-budget group treats. The food is good enough to eat the entire serving. But I cannot compare it to the better restaurants Kolkata now boasts of. This place place is for its good old charm with good old food, there has been no modifications whatsoever. Nostalgia.

You know . .you get this feel about restaurants :must eat . .must avoid . .umm . uh huh . .etc.?
I hope some of u do :(
I never felt like going here . .but then there comes a day when ur favr8 Chinese place is too crowded.  .u NEED food n u need it quick . .so we packed the food from here . .we had ordered a fried rice . .a chilli chicken n a fish .
When we got home.  .we found the chicken had been replaced by mushroom which was very infuriating . 
The thing about this place is . .they serve in huge amounts . .like 17 pieces in a plate. .but then I prefer less food n good food on my plate .  they satisfied neither condition. They also have this irritating habit of putting in a lot . .like a whole lot of slit fat green chilies as a garnish.  .there must b a limit to d chillies.
I even wanted to have another go bfr deciding on them but with d same disappointing results . I am not going to elaborate . .but not happy at all

Mandarin is one of the oldest restaurant serving c.It has a simple ambience..but the food is too good here n amount they serve is huge.Tried chicken sweet corn soup,schezuan hakka noodles,cantonese noodles,chilli garlic noodles,schezuan chicken,garlic chicken n honey chilli chicken.All the dishes were awesome.But honey chilli chicken (dry) is my personal favourite here.Perfect blend of honey sauce with a hint of chilli..the kick of spice compliments the sweet sticky honey flavour.I always order this whenever I'm here.

My mother became very nostalgic when we entered the place, which tells u that they haven't changed the decor at all since old times. it Kind of looks as if they haven't even maintained it  properly. 
Talking abt the food, it was completely so-so. All of their starters are fried with lots of batter which ruins the taste of the main dish. Sweet corn soup was delicious, it was the kind of soup you would want to drink on every winter evening , whereas the hot and sour soup tasted like tomato ketchup, it was that bad. Egg noodles was good. 
overall, I would say people between the age group of 30-50 yrs would enjoy this place more rather than the younger generation.

I came to know about this place from my father when i was a kid. This one is my father's favourite. Mandarin is a small restaurant but serves good food. One thing i can say confidently is that the quantity of food is more than enough, worth the price. Do try their hakka noodle with dry chilli chicken.

An old restaurant charm with its authenticity intact! 
A full plate consists of 16 pieces of chicken here. But you can order a half plate. So keep this in mind while ordering.
One thing synonymous with this place is the quality. And they take orders for making it less spicy which they actually do instead of just noting it, like in other restaurants. Their meifoon is what I like the most.
Another recent favourite is the Rice Noodle soup which is very mild and is a great option when you are sick and you want to eat light.

|Dishes ordered: Asperagus soup, Chilli Mushroom, Drums of Heaven, Spring Chicken, Spring Prawns and Gravy Noodles|

Located at a convenient place, Mandarin offers a very authentic eating experience that you associate with Kolkata's Chinese cuisine.

While all the dishes were high on taste and quality - the gravy noodles stood out, just for its distinctiveness.

The portions are huge and the rate card on the reasonable side, service is pretty smooth too. Try this place out.

Mandarin is a place that is so old that it was the favourite place of my parents when they were college students.. So the liking for Mandarin passed down from my parents to me.. 
Pros: 
1. Good food for the price
2. Notorious for serving food within 10 minutes of placing order.. So if you are ravenous and around southern avenue region, do visit this place. 
Cons: 
1. Never try anything cantonese or gravy here because they don't know how to handle the gravy.. If you want to order chicken then order dry
2. Don't try the lemon chicken over there.. They make it too sweet and give excuses like "lemon chicken toh eromi mishti hoy".
Would I go to this place?? If and only if i am ravenous and around southern avenue rashbehari region..

Simply great. I am planning to visit the place again in the coming week.  We had ordered Pepper chilly garlic babycorn, prawn cantonese rice and half chilly chicken(enough for two even if one of them is glutton).  Babycorn was quite oily for my friend. Undoubtedly it was, but if the taste comes out to be such then I dont think I could have deducted more than .10 from their food score . Just -.10 for the oily factor. The rest two couldnt have been better. I visited the place after almost 10 years and I am just singing ''Mandarin Mandarin'' since.

To keep it short and simple, this is a place for good Chinese food that's easy on the wallet. Their specialities are their legendary lemon chicken ( probably the best in town) , and the amazing Thai soup. They were the pioneers of the Thai soup and even though most of the popular Chinese joints serve it now, it is best served here. Even the Mandarin fish and their gravy noodles are really good.
The only downsides are the long waiting queues and the poor service.

Is there any dearth of Chinese restaurants in the city? Absolutely not! Every corner you turn will have a restaurant specialising in Chinese. The Southern Avenue area especially has quite a handful of them. One such restaurant is Mandarin.
The location is bang on the main road connecting Deshapriya Park to Southern Avenue. This place is usually a very great option during the Durga puja days. The food is reasonable, quantity sufficient and taste is conventional. There are no specialities that the place has to offer. The The garlic chicken that we had taken was good.
Seating arrangements may seem a bit cramped, but that's immaterial for a quick bite when you're in that part of town.

A friend of mine used to swear by Mandarin sometime in late 90's and naturally I had to follow her to this place. Genuinely not a Chinese cuisine lover, I am very impatient when it comes to Chinese dishes and I hate to look and munch on those soupy boiled veggies which is a MUST for every single dish I assume especially when cooking "authentic" Chinese meal. 
I mostly have nothing good to say about a restaurant serving Chinese being a hard core North Indian & Italian cuisine fanatic.. So if not, its exceptionally well and the starters are not up to the mark ( well in my personal standard taste! ) I tend to lose my patience very easily. 
But thankfully the place and their food does not disappoint.
Mandarin is an old restaurant, situated just besides Sarat Bose Post office, it's easy to locate. 
The place is quite small and let's not even start with the decor, what it was in the year 2000 the decor still remains intact and so does their consistency. They have been very good for over the years and continue to deliver good wholesome Chinese food even today, what I like about them is obviously their quality and quantity! 
For me their signature dish was and has always remained the chicken Cantonese chowmein, I used to be literally dragged here from time to time to taste this speciality dish which my friend adored and I think by now I have warmed up to it, I also like it very much now. Hehe ?
For starters their spring chicken which is another favourite but this time of my cousin sister is really nice and full of flavours, crispy & hot it makes quite a filling meal every single time we order this obviously with a fizzy drink! 
Their chicken sweet corn soup and the pepper chilli garlic chicken are dishes which are a MUST try out here. 
Quite easy on the pockets ( compared to the other places ) this place should be bookmarked by all Chinese food lovers. Yes the decor and the unfazed staff might not impress but the food surely will.

Yummy!!!! Superb food at reasonable price is what I can say about this restaurant. 

When there this evening with a friend or mine. To start with, its a two storied eatery located on the Sarat Bose Road Connector at Southern Avenue. Medium sized restaurant with nominal decor. The only thing noticeable about the decor is a medium sized chandelier at the entrance. 

We ordered mixed fried rice, chicken fried rice and half plate garlic chicken. Dont think that the half plate chicken will be little for your appetite. Actually a full plate of the rice or noodles is really good for two and a half plate of a side dish is good to go with it. 

The service was pretty okay. They served us in about 15 mins.  Although their was nothing great about the fried rice, the garlic chicken (gravy) was just too good. Soft and succulent chicken piece in a gravy that is beyond good. The tangy taste of the gravy made us want more of the gravy itself, let alone the chicken. Simply too good. The rice was good but not great. 

The waiters were really prompt and helpful too. A must try out for all!

Quite easy on the pockets ( compared to the other places ) this place should be bookmarked by all Chinese food lovers. Yes the decor and the unfazed staff might not impress but the food surely will.

Yummy!!!! Superb food at reasonable price is what I can say about this restaurant. 

When there this evening with a friend or mine. To start with, its a two storied eatery located on the Sarat Bose Road Connector at Southern Avenue. Medium sized restaurant with nominal decor. The only thing noticeable about the decor is a medium sized chandelier at the entrance. 

We ordered mixed fried rice, chicken fried rice and half plate garlic chicken. Dont think that the half plate chicken will be little for your appetite. Actually a full plate of the rice or noodles is really good for two and a half plate of a side dish is good to go with it. 

The service was pretty okay. They served us in about 15 mins.  Although their was nothing great about the fried rice, the garlic chicken (gravy) was just too good. Soft and succulent chicken piece in a gravy that is beyond good. The tangy taste of the gravy made us want more of the gravy itself, let alone the chicken. Simply too good. The rice was good but not great. 

The waiters were really prompt and helpful too. A must try out for all!

Mandarin not so popular restaurant but if u come here once u will come here for the 'n' th time. Basically it's a Chinese restaurant. The soups are yummilocious. Hot and sour soup is a must eat here. The flavours complementing each other and to do with it spring chicken is something that fits with it. Quantity is not the thing that they focus on it's quality which they look into. Even 1 plate is ample for two. Umm coming into main course noodles is much tastier than rice here. And something which I love is their dry garlic chicken which tastes wow. And food is something which makes me happy... And it's a cool place with a Chinese decor ambience is good and food is wow.

Dates back to two decades back, when I was first introduced to this restaurant by my grandfather who lived in southern avenue then. Whenever it was mammamdadu's house, it would certainly be mandarin. and finally last week made a generous move to mandarin again. When I walked in along with my friend at around 12 30 pm, nearly the whole restaurant staff was lousy enough to even get up to even give us water. Finally they came in with thw menu. I was so determined to have a soup. Because that nearly meets half of your meal. Their half portion of soup is enough to suffice three people, let alone the full one. We order for a chicken mushroom soup and the staff suggested we should simply go in for the thick one. And it arrived, nostalgia refilled. Huge soup boul and ofcourse the great taste reimbursed. Then for the main course I was quite decided to go in for fish items as they really serve amazing fish. And ofcourse it was as never. We ordered for a mixed chilli garlic noodles and the manager suggested us to go in for pepper garlic fish. And I swear I would go back for the garlic fish whatsoever. The fish was cooked so well, smelled amazing , and brought back the good old taste of mandarin back again. The chilli garlic noodles was however not upto the mark. Another thing that I love is their collection of culinary. It is so chinese and so goes in with the ambience. The bill is definitely quite decent in accordance to the quality and quantity of food that they serve. Kudos mandarin, am hopping back too soon.

the first thing you notice while walking into Mandarin is that its proprietor is chinese, mrs liu. and when you walk in throuvh the door that has the word "open" in chinese, you know that you are going to b served authentic chinese. This place has been there around the nook for a long time. and has been pleasing customers ever since. their cantonese noodles is to die for and so is the schezuan fried rice. this place is special for me because this is the place where my dad would often take my mother during their courtship years.
Apart from that ithis place is pocket friendly and its well suited for romantic dates or for dining with friends. And a thumbs up to the staff for ththat friendly smile annd brilliant service.

But its a small venture with high rate not much but a little 
Can be tried with friends may be with family if you are searching for good tasty food.

Mandarin at the Southern Avenue and Lansdowne Road crossing , opposite Lake stadium has retained the same glory , it had carried for years !

It was built eons ago , but ,  it still is thronged by happy families in the evening.

Garlic Chicken with its tangy red sauce , Chilly Chicken with ripped open chillies and Prawn Sweet and Sour remain my favourites !

They serve 16 chicken pieces in the whole and 8 pieces in the half variants for the side dishes.

For two persons , one half side dish is good enough.

With around 8 tables on the ground and a couple more in the mezzanine , seating inside is tricky.

But , they have a prompt take away service as well. You can order over phone and take the parcels form their restaurant. They do not deliver at home, though.

While it is tragic to see the decline of China Bowl over the years , Mrs Liu has made sure Mandarin retains its jewel in the crown ! !

Quantity they are giving is huge. But regarding ambiance I can give only 2 out of 5. Since its a good Chinese restaurant they should work on creating a good ambiance.

My sister has been ordering from Mandarin for quite some time now, and I quite often find myself at her place for their food. Mandarin used to be an absolute favourite for take-away. Their portions were good and you couldn't argue with the food quality. Of late, and this a personal take, their standards perhaps have dropped a teensy bit. Don't get me wrong, their food still is very good and I'm more than happy to keep ordering in.

I cannot comment on their in-restaurant service as I never have eaten there. But I can confidently tell you that their take-away service is prompt. If ordering in or take-away seems like a nice idea, I'd recommend skipping bigger names and trying out Mandarin.¬†

Thanks for reading, and pardon me for any grammatical mistakes I may have made. :)

This is absolutely one of my fav restaurants of Kolkata, so even after few shortcomings of its own I will give some rave reviews to it. 
Located at 2 places one near deshopriyo, southern avenue crossing n another on the road to mudiali opposite nava nalanda high school, it has some premium location quality. The only difference btwn the 2 outlets is the one near deshopriyo doesn't take payments by debit card.
I hardly look at the decoration in the food place. To me the taste and number of pieces of chicken per plate matters more than the quality of plate its served in. Yet the decor is decent n eye soothing. Its an absolute family restaurant.
After having an evening walk in the lake I would often visit this place for some evening snack along with my friend. The starters are delightful over here. My fav is half bowl of hot n sour chilli soup n 1 full plate of pepper garlic or spring chicken for me n my friend. Believe me the half bowl soup is way more for 2ppl n the full plate of most of the dishes will have 16pieces of the item. The chow mein here is better than the rice as the rice is a bit more sticky n unusual than other restaurants. The prawn preparation I have (dont remember the name) is yummy. If you go here in odd numbers, well u gotta problem for that as the quantity is always for even numbered headcount and is sumptuous. Also the food is healthy, cooked in less spice n oil. I always add 5 spoon of chilli vinegar to make it spicy for my taste :).

PS price wise its absolutely worth the food n less.

Today went to this restaurant after about 3 years. I must say that I was disappointed as I entered because the place looked shabby than before. 
We ordered veg sweet corn soup, chicken sweet corn soup, fried prawns, veg Hakka noodles, mixed Hakka noodles, sweet n sour prawns, sweet n sour chicken. The soup and fried prawns were awesome. Others were very average tasting like any other road side eatery.
The waiters were brash, had to tell the serving guy to serve properly and not scatter the food on the plate. Every time waiters were coming out of the kitchen, they were banging the doors, making it very much disturbing. 
I guess this was my last time at Mandarin. Certainly don't recommend it unless you don't have any other options.

We ordered thai soup and mushroom chicken soup for our kid.. The quantity was really huge... Even for a small plate, sufficient to serve 3...
Then ordered honey chicken, Manchurian fish, chilli garlic prawn, chilli chicken, on top  of that Cantonese noodles and fried rice.

I guess the medium prawns were really large... The fish , Cantonese noodles all worth a mention. Others were average...

My ratings:

1. Food - 3.75/5
2. Ambience - 3.5/5
3. Service - 4.5/5

Nice place to have a quiet evening dinner with authentic Chinese... Not the Indian types that we all love so much and think is authentic Chinese;-)

Nothing special about the ambience. Very average. Interior is not well decorated

FOOD:
we ordered garlic fried rice and sweet lime chicken.Quality was really average. The rice was way too oily for a Chinese dish. Chickens were quiet stiff.Though the gravy was tasty .

POCKET PINCH: 500 for two

CONCLUSION: May be its one of the restaurant of great repute but iam sorry to say the quality of food has deteriorated. Moreover most of the items on the menu list was not available. So its a big NO for second visit

This is one of the restaurants of Kolkata which has that authentic Chinese flavour! This place is owned by Monica Liu, who besides Mandarin, owns other famous Chinese restaurants of Kolkata, namely Tung Fong, Beijing. Located at the very convenient location of Sarat Bose Road,with facilities for parking, Mandarin is indeed a class apart if it comes to Chinese. Their Fried Rice is quite different from other restaurants of Kolkata and is uniquely Chinese in its own way. Their Chilli Garlic Chicken Gravy is by far the best Chinese side dish of this place. It has a robust flavour of garlic,and the flavourful, slightly viscous garlic gravy along with some succulent chicken and a spoonful of Fired Rice makes it a divine Chinese treat. 
Service is quite fast and ambience is commendable as well. Thumps up for Mandarin!  :D

I have come to this place with 12 people, and everyone was full after eating their meal, the best part was the bill came up to just 2500 in total. That is less than what it cost to feed four people in Chilli's.'
One may say where is the comparison, there is a huge difference in food quality. Let me tell you the food in Mandarin is awesome. Their hakka noodles is a must have ¬†and their chilly garlic pepper chicken is simply awesome. Service quality is good and the food is always on time. The portions are huge! in fact whenever I come here with family I have to pack most of the food as the portions are so large. A must go!!!

I have not been a frequent visitor of mandarin but always loved the food. However my last couple of experiences have been big disasters with food being very average and absence of most of the (vegetarian) items from the menu.

Located on southern avenue, sarat bose road xing, its a very convenient place. The place seems congested and has an average decor. The staff service is decent. The seating is comfortable. The prices are very reasonable though.

On my last couple of visits i observed that most of the items from the menu were not available. So had to choose from whatever little options they could provide. Even that would be fine with me if the stuff served live up to my expectations which was not the case. The crispy chilli babycorn had weird taste and was way too oily. The fried rice was very average and the side dish too ordinary.

Overall i was freakingly disappointed, moreso since I have way better expectations from a place like mandarin.

I have visited this place located in Southern Avenue a couple of times. It is really one old Chinese joints that south Kolkatans can somewhat boast of. The ambiance is not too great, not that bad either. It's okay but a bit cramped up to be true! 

Coming to the food, it's actually quite good and served in real good quantities. Some of the dishes you must try here are Schezuan Chicken Dry, Pepper Chilli Garlic Fish and Chicken Cantonese Noodles. I also do like their classic Chilli Chicken as side dish.

The service here is real quick and waiters are quite helpful. One tip - if you are planning for take-away, just call them up and place your order. They'll have it ready when you go to pick it up. Not many restaurants encourage unknown callers like that! Prices are justified considering the taste and quantity served. Overall - Worth a try!

Cheers!

It is very spacious and the staff is cordial. Each time they serve food with a smile.¬†
Their Cantonese Mixed Chow , Honey Chicken And Manchurian Chicken are my absolute favorite.¬†
The food is served hot and fresh. The quantity is enough for more than two people.

Location: Sarat Bose Road - Southern Avenue Crossing. 

My family has been patronizing this particular outlet for like years now.
This place has been on the lips of each and every person from the earlier generation of my family and finally, a family dinner was planned just for me. My family simply wanted me to taste the food here coz' until then all I used to hear regarding Mandarin was "Yahan nahi khaya toh kya Chinese khaya!" :-P 

Mandarin is a two-level restaurant and the ambiance out here is quite simple, nothing extraordinary. 

Talking about the food, a few dishes are slightly inclined towards the Indianized Chinese style but, the remaining are authentic preparations. In totality, it's delicious. 
The following was ordered: 

Hakka Noodles (Veg)
Perfectly boiled noodles tossed with juicy veggies and seasoned with salt and pepper.
Was delicious.

Rice Noodles (Veg)
Absolute deliciousness.
Recommended. 

Chilli Garlic Fried Rice (Veg)
Perfectly cooked rice with the right balance of saut√©d garlic and spice. 
Tasted good.

Pepper Garlic Chilli Paneer
The dish was delicious in totality.
The Paneer was succulent and melt-in-the-mouth.

Schezuan Mixed Vegetables
Aah! That spiciness. Hot and delicious. 
Recommended. 

-Full and Half portion options available. 
-Portion sizes are generous. 

The staff was courteous and polite. 
The service quality was good. 

Prices are slightly inclined towards the high but, wouldn't feel a pinch thanks to the portion sizes. :) 

Was a good experience. 
-would revisit soon.

Mandarin is a very hyped restaurant amongst our previous generation. My parents, their friends talk about it and hence I dropped in to try out the food. We started with Hot and sour soup, which was really good. Moved on to Chilli garlic Chicken and it was also pretty decent. Then we ordered Mixed Hakka Chowmein and Pepper Chilli Garlic Fish. The fish melted in my mouth. It was really delicious!
Now you must be wondering, why such poor rating for serving us such delicious food? 
the Mixed Chowmein. It had only 1 flavour-SALT.
Well, mistakes can happen, and considering that, I called the waiter and pointed out, "the chowmein is very salty, can you please change it.?" To my surprise, the waiter replied back- "aisa hi hota hain." I asked him, "Chowmein mein itna namak hota hain?" He said, "Haan. yaha ka Chowmein aisa hi hota hain, change nahi hoga."
We were stunned to see his attitude and behavior towards customers, knowing the fact that we may never come back.
Well, we didnot. And I dont think we will ever do.

Heard a lot about this restaurant from my friends, so i decided to try out. Since its famous for its authentic Chinese dishes, I tried chicken cantonese noodles. ¬†It was truly traditional dish and flavours were awesome. Though it was priced at 140 (excluding taxes) but it really worth it. However, the ambience was a bit clumsy. Not enough dining space. So, I had to take-away. Remember they charge for packaging which is really annoying. Addition to that, debit card are NOT accepted! So you need to carry cash. I would have rated with 4.5 for its taste, but the ambience isn't allowing me to rate more than 4.

How much I am in love with the quality and taste of food served here.... its like beyond explanation. Mandarin can anytime beat china towns any good restaurant be it in terms quality, quantity or value for money. 
Yes am not saying that they have a superbly decorated restaurant but I am more than happy eating my Chinese at their small cozy restaurant.
A plate of mixed may foon with another plate of mixed fried rice and chili garlic chicken with two cold drinks will cost you rs.661/- including all. and the quantity is more than enough for two people to finish.


Mandarin was, is, and always be one of my most favorite restaurants in kolkata.

This is a fantastic place for trying authentic Chinese. They serve wonderful food, with unbelievable quantity, i repeat unbelievable quantity. Be wise and consult the waiter before ordering, and ensure you are ready to carry the left over home. Quick service and comfortable ambiance. The prices are in the range of any regular restaurant at China Town, Tangra. Even the dishes taste similar.

My order:
Golden Fried Prawn: Freaking tasted like KFC. Awesome. Outstanding.
Chicken Mushroom Soup: Big chicken pieces, thick consistency. Mushrooms didn't taste great though.
Chilli Honey Chicken: Probably one of the best chicken dry items I've ever tried. Please order this, don't miss. Opens up your senses.
Garlic Fish: Extremely tasty, and goes well with the main course.
Mixed Cantonese Noodles: Just wow.

Good food at affordable prices. Great restaurant. Waiting for my next visit!

THEY DO NOT ACCEPT DEBIT CARDS. PROBABLY THE ONLY NEGATIVE I WOULD SAY.

Small and Cozy place to have dinner. Its like a Para Restaurant where you can come and have food at the comfort of your neighborhood.

Soups are really nice, Food is good.

Quantity is on the higher side, true value for money.

Place is really small for a big group of customers to eat. Small family of 4 or couples can have peaceful eating experience.

I visited Mandarin after 10 years and was surprised to see that it had managed to keep its old charm. The half bowl of chk mushroom soup was great and was sufficient for four of us(2 adults 2 kids). Mixed Fried Rice and mixed rice chowmin were equally good. It was heartening to see that all the dishes had ample helpings of chick, egg and prawn. The only disappointment  was regarding the service. There was only one waiter for the entire top floor and he had lot of difficulty in managing the show.

Went to Mandarin for the first  time. I was expecting a real old place with a lot of lip smacking dishes and some'heritage' but it did not offer much especially the heritage part. Rice noodles was good and proportions served were more than we could finish. Also we had ordered fried chicken n chicken with honey. The former was kind of very simple chicken fry nothing worth mentioning but the later was good. Only thing is I found sugar crystals in it(not sure if they are supposed to be). Also the place is real small n if u go upstairs n u are tall then please save your head. All in all it was good but not upto my expectations.

Overall NICE experience.. The Red Pepper Chili Garlic Chicken was good as starters.. The Schezwan Chicken in Main Course was too disappointing !! It was sooo sweet and sour , without any hint of chills or spice ... 
But the Mix Cantonese Rice ( Me and my Wife's favourite ) scored it all.. The Chili Garlic Noodles was so-so...

We were five of us at Lake stadium and decided to go for a lunch at Mandarin. We all heard a lot about this  restaurant but never went there. Finally on a monsoon afternoon we settled there for our lunch. 

Location----> Located in Sarat Bose Road , this place is just opposite to lake stadium and next to Sarat Bose Post office.

Ambiance ---> The restaurant  is of two floors , we sat on the first floor as the ground floor was almost filled up. The ambiance of this place is average. Nothing special about the decor.

Food ordered---> We were pretty hungry and ordered the food quickly. We've ordered 1 Mixed Hakka Chow, 1 Cantonese Mixed Chow, 1 Manchurian Chicken and 1 Honey chicken .

Food quantity and quality ---> They offer decent food quantity but the food quality -_- !! The mixed hakka chow was average but the Cantonese chow was quite good. The Manchurian Chicken was average but the honey Chicken was absolutely rubbish. Honey chicken tops the my list when coming to preparations of chicken but here they made it ridiculous! It was burnt  and extra extra sweet !! 

Price---> Price is on the higher side if compared with the food quality. For these 4 dishes it came 854Rs with VAT and Service Tax.

My recommendations-----> Mixed Cantonese Chow.

Very Chinatownesque - the best thing about this nondescript Chinese joint being the super-big portions. I've been here on numerous occasions and have never been served food that I didn't like. The service is good and the food gets to your table before you start playing with the salt shakers. I'm not much of a soup person but I like their thick/clear chicken mushroom soup and chicken hot and sour soup. It's either mixed rice noodles or mixed fried rice, both of which I can never have more than one helping of, with chilly honey chicken or lemon chicken or the ever-popular manchurian chicken. There's absolutely no room for dessert, not that there are nice options when it comes down to that. I always have a take-away box clutched in my hands when I leave. Worth it.

One the first restaurants I came to know in my childhood..and has been in our family dine out least for over 20 years...and maybe even a few years more....the quality of the dishes served here can be compared to the Beijing restaurant in China town...that is perhaps the reason why it remains a favorite with the long time faithfuls in the region...Cantonese chow mein and the dry chilli chicken has been a long time partners in my plate...additions like the lemon chicken, and prawn starters ha only made it sweeter...

Came here a couple of times. Good place, good food they have some special dishes of fish which can be tried and overall the quality of food is quite good,though its a bit costly and you should carry extra money. Service is also good and prompt, food comes within the expected time. Location is also good and prime, its just beside the petrol pump and opposite vodafone store, not hard to find.There are quite a number of restaurants around so you may have to take a decision which way to go. The Place gives you the feel of an old modern Chinese restaurant.

Before I write reviews, I always browse for others. Especially those that gave restaurants 1-2 stars that I think deserves the contrary. Good chinese food with a mix of ingredients that just works. The wait can be long on the weekends so expect to wait a little. The service is was oaky only and friendly servers! Be aware though, some of the food is VERY spicy. If you don't like it hot, tell your waiters. The service could be a bit more hearty but this seems to be part of the image. Worth it for the food though...a must-tiny dining experience.  Very inventive menu with enough choices for everyone.  They use a variety of ingredients you wont see at other Chinese restaurants. Overall, this is a Schezuan inspired food and they don't mild it down, so you have to be able to handle the heat. The dishes uses a lot of fresh ingredients and has a interesting twist while still maintaining some authenticity. It's good to try for it's uniqueness, but somewhere I would want to go frequently with friends and family. the dinning place was not comfortable at all the first thing you"ll notice is how cramped up the place is....table are merged which is not quiet enough but ohh common this remembers you how most of chinese resturants are in china.

I'd been here 3 years ago with my dad and had a lovely experience. So I walked in excitedly with my cousin on a late Friday afternoon. The only thing we enjoyed whilst our stay was the chilled bottle of kinley. The service was sloppy. Our waiter put more food on the table than on our plates. The food was way too salty, the prawn uncooked. The worst 600 rupees I have ever spent.

How the mighty have fallen. Once, the name Mandarin meant excellent Chinese food. Took an NRI friend of mine promising him wonderful food and my how we were disappointed.
The age is showing now. Dirty linen, dated crockery and ancient cutlery.
I remember the waiters were always friendly and polite but the 2 that served us were arrogant and acting as if we are doing them a favor by eating there.
Ordered Pepper chicken dry, chili chicken gravy, mixed fried rice and cold drinks.
Pepper chicken was good, but the other 2 dishes were horrible. Rice hadn't even been cleaned and was full of little kankad(stones).
And the bill came to just under ‚Çπ1,000. Which we thought was outrageously expensive for what we had had.
Would never go there and don't recommend it.

Not much I can say about this place that hasn't been said before. Old place, shabby interiors, and all that jazz. But by god if their food isn't some of the best you'll ever have in Kolkata. At mostly pocket-friendly prices as well.

I'll just start off by saying their soup is the best I've had anywhere in this city, period. I frequently order the Chicken and mushroom soup, the thick version. It's heavenly in its own right, and moreso if you have a head cold ;) 

Their rice/noodles are...a tad bit oily, but nothing we couldn't manage. The Cantonese chow, as someone pointed out before me, tastes too cornflour-y lately. Try the Pepper chicken or the one with mushrooms and baby corn to go along with it. Or just the chilli chicken or garlic varieties if you aren't up for experimenting. 

No dessert, sadly, but the rest of the food more than makes this a minor gripe. I've had only good experiences with Mandarin and recommend it wholeheartedly.

First time at Mandarin in over 4 years. Last time, from wht I remember, was good! So went back to it. SO SO disappointed with what it has become!! Super cramped, no legspace, not even a place to keep a bag!! Was seated in the upstairs area which was super noisy and crowded. Ambience, if u can call it that, is terrible!!

Chicken and Mushroom Clear Soup was good,albeit salty. Pepper Chili Fish starter was extremely oily and overfried, not to mention salty again!! Chicken Ginger Fried Rice was oily. Chili Lemon Chicken, although not to my liking, was complementing the Rice by cutting down its saltiness.

Service is poor. Took ages to just serve us basic Water and Cold drinks. Portions are huge but standard of food is bad. Super sad with this dining experience. Sadly, wont be visiting this place again! :(

My friends and I went for dinner yesterday to Mandarin. Surprising that it was my first time even though I have lived on the same road for years! All of us were meagre eaters and the portions were astoundingly generous. We ordered Veg Schezuan Noodles Hakka style and Lemon Chilli Chicken. The food arrived at the table promptly and was served up expertly by the waiting staff. The noodles were thicker than usual but the taste was authentic Indo-Chinese. The Chilli Lemon Chicken, which I had heard a lot about, was quite sweet contrary to expectation. Not that it did not taste good, just that it was not what I had imagined it would taste like. More like a Sweet and Sour Chicken preparation with a lot of chopped green chillies in the gravy. 
The bill was reasonable judging by the portions and we had a nice meal overall.

There is a saying that goes 'ghar ki murgi dal barabar' .. I guess that is the case for Mandarin with me, since I have completely missed writing a review,uptill now. Over my multiple visits and take-away , I have never been disappointed. This place serves authentic Kolkata- Chinese (if there be a term like that).
Chicken Clear Soup, Mixed thai soup, Chicken sweet corn soup ( my 3 year old nephew gulps it up in no time) are my picks from the soup section. I generally do not order rice/noodles and occasionally have small helpings from family members and have found that the cantonese chow and fried rice are better choices than the oily hakka or the chopsuey.
My focus remains on the chicken dishes and I think I have tasted all that the place has to offer. Lemon Chicken is a dish that I keep on ordering everywhere and their Chilli Lemon Chicken- with the right balance of lemon tang and chilli kick is, as per me the best in the city. . close favorites are the chili honey chicken, garlic chicken. One cannot go wrong in the choice of chicken dishes over here.
Excellent portion sizes; great value for money. .Definitely not a couple's place, exception being a couple with a insane appetite. 
Mandarin food is next to home food, can i say more?

Mandarin is an extension of my kitchen. My first memories of this place is during my summer vacation visits to kolkata. My uncle used to regularly bring food from Mandarin.

What I like best about this place, is that it hasn't lost its character, in all the thirty years I have been visiting it.

No frills No nonsense - Typical Indo-chinese food, which only Kolkata can dish.

It's not a place to bring your crush out on a  first date, cos of the basic shabby interiors. However, if you know that she is a foodie & loves chinese. Dont think twice - you will score.

I, often visit Mandarin for a quick meal. The portions are enormous. Don't get fooled by the portion sizes being categorised as half & full. What they really mean is sufficient & enormous.

If you dont like experimenting - stick to the chilli chicken, mixed fried rice, cantonese chow ( though, lately, the cantonese tastes fuller - extra cornflour?) 

Or there are loads to try out - konjee cripsy dishes, chopsueys, garlic prawns....

Sadly no dessert options - for that, post meal, you need to step into the neighbouring magpies & le maisons.

Mandarin is a restaurant that I visit quite regularly - not just because it is near to my house but also because I definitely like the food over here. Mandarin was always unpretentious and never swanky and I reckon that is how it will always be.

I find their Honey chicken simply brilliant - possibly the best in Calcutta, the garlic and ginger chicken is also reasonably good. What should also be tried out are their Chopsueys - both the Chinese and American versions. However, if you are ordering Chinese chopsuey, make sure to tell them that you want it with a poached egg on top - otherwise they won't!

One of the items which I personally like but which they don't make so well is Lemon Chicken.

The service level of the staff could be better. But well, the food is fine.

Only pro is the quantity (which can become a con if you've restrictions on rice intake!). Otherwise pretty average. It's better NOT to dine here as it's totally cramped. If budget is not a concern, I would recommend Jimmy's Kitchen, near the AJC Bose Road- Theatre Road crossing. They charge a bit more, but it's worth the money! Quality & quantity, in both parameters.

This is a nice & cozy restaurant ...which will offer you great food at right price. I've been a loyalist at this joint specifically because of the freshness & taste of the food which is being served. Must try list includes - Meifoon(any type) & Lemon Chicken (dry).  They have discontinued one of my favorites "Chilly Garlic Crab Claws" due to reasons unknown ..but still the existing platter is exciting enough. Prawn preparations are also quite good and in my opinion much better from any dedicated Chinese restaurants from "Tangra" (the so famous China Town itself..)..

This is one of the four famous joints by Ms. Liu which come w/ their distinct culinary signature. 

Not all items found at Beijing or Kim Lin are available here but the Cantonese chow, the meifoon are must try. The prawn dishes are special and so is chilly chicken. The fried rice and soups are also very good also. Try using the condiments on your soup.

We come here at weekends but actually for me this is really my make shift Kim Lin.

Mandarin is perhaps one of the most cramped up restaurants in the city. And that, in my opinion, is a major con. All I heard throughout my meal was an argument of a middle aged couple sitting next to my table. The lack of space to move around is astounding. Even the waiters find difficulty in manoeuvring in between the extremely narrow spaces. Being on the taller side (6'2.5"), I generally require more leg space. But as I was seated near the kitchen with waiters frequently coming out and going in, I had to sit uncomfortably and was even asked to stand up at times.
The food was pretty much average. Nothing out of the ordinary. I've had better food for less. The quality of service could use some improvement as well.

Been visiting this place since I was a child. Keeping the nostalgia-induced bias aside, I gotta admit that this place has evolved into a pretty average Chinese food hub. Won't say that the food is bad, just that it's nothing special. A lot of it is more of hype than quality. I prefer Mainland China over Mandarin, any day.

Mandarin is another old chinese eatery. Situated on Sarat Bose road it has been around for some time. 
The restaurant is actually quite small with cramped tables and you can easily overhear the conversation at the next table. The service is also slow and nothing remarkable.
But like any good restaurant it leaves it marks in the taste of food. Therefore my rating is based solely on the food.
This place makes what I like to call authentic Indian Chinese dishes. My most favourite dish here is the Chicken Schewuan Dry. Have it once and you will be a fan forever. I always go and order the full plate which has 16 pieces and eat it almost all by myself. Among my other favourites are Chicken Mushroom Clear Soup,Chicken with button mushrooms,Spring Prawn, Pepper Chilli Garlic Fish. I also absolutely love their basic Mixed Fried Rice. They also do a good job with American Chopsuey. Here for the soups and side dishes you also have the option of ordering half plate. Half plate is actually adequate for two people.
But I have noticed one thing. The quality of the food if you take home delivery significantly decreases. It has happened to me twice already. I would have to deduct 1 point for that.

N.B. - This place does NOT accept debit cards. So be sure to carry cash or your Credit Cards.

 That's all folks!! That is enough for me to describe the superb culinary skills at Mandarin. The ambiance is very cosy and comfortable and also the staff was quite friendly..

Overall, it was a nice experience at Mandarin!

Been visiting this place since I was a child. Keeping the nostalgia-induced bias aside, I gotta admit that this place has evolved into a pretty average Chinese food hub. Won't say that the food is bad, just that it's nothing special. A lot of it is more of hype than quality. I prefer Mainland China over Mandarin, any day.

I have been dining here with my family since I was old enuf to eat outside food. all my marks just for food . Imagine a chknese den with old waiters yet the food makes it up for everyyhing else. I would suggest a standard chinese meal here nothing typical.. dont experiment in mandarin ... do have the soup, order a usual chow or fried rice with chicken manchurian or chilli I have never liked any classic chinese food better than this classic chinese food at the mandarin. its a kinda plc whr u enter and a wave of chinese smell sweeps accross ur senses.. amazing...

Mandarin is another old chinese eatery. Situated on Sarat Bose road it has been around for some time. 
The restaurant is actually quite small with cramped tables and you can easily overhear the conversation at the next table. The service is also slow and nothing remarkable.
But like any good restaurant it leaves it marks in the taste of food. Therefore my rating is based solely on the food.
This place makes what I like to call authentic Indian Chinese dishes. My most favourite dish here is the Chicken Schewuan Dry. Have it once and you will be a fan forever. I always go and order the full plate which has 16 pieces and eat it almost all by myself. Among my other favourites are Chicken Mushroom Clear Soup,Chicken with button mushrooms,Spring Prawn, Pepper Chilli Garlic Fish. I also absolutely love their basic Mixed Fried Rice. They also do a good job with American Chopsuey. Here for the soups and side dishes you also have the option of ordering half plate. Half plate is actually adequate for two people.

one of the oldest favourites this cramped tiny joint on sarat bose road provides cheap Chinese in generous quantities but the quality can be iffy. I know several people who had problems after a hearty meal there. But usually the quality is not too bad.

one of the best chinese eateries in the city. the soups are amazing. the smoky flavour of the hakka noddles is something that is found here only. the crispy chilli pepper garlic chicken is just as special but the best of the lot has to be the Cantonese noodles! come once and you would definitely come again though I would suggest a take away than a dining in...

Mandarin is my all time favourite restaurant! I have been there since i was a child. What i like about it the most is that it provides good quantity and quality food....and i mean quantity that huge enough to fill up some real empty stomachs!! :) For a quick apetizer or snack, i always go for there delicious chicken sweet corn soup! Believe me..food lovers..no other restaurants serve that good a soup !

all is ok just that the level of achinomoto in your food is too high... KINDLY STOP ADDING THAT POISION to the chinese food items even if it is giving taste to the food... but i dont care being a health concious person i feel mandarin needs to stop adding this item in the food. 

ambience needs to improve a bit... staff need to be more professional.

I am not a big fan of this place, to be frank. it is no doubt an old restaurant and I have not seen much change even till last durga puja. it is a quaint place with not too much crowd where you would have to wait for hours . Menu wise , I have loved the gravy chowmein only and yes they used to serve soup in large bowls , easily suited for 2 person maybe three.

ALL TIME FAVOURITE!

Mandarin Restaurant serves delicious food at overpowering quantity and sensible prices. The food is not only well prepared but scrumptious as well, though the ambience and decor is simple and plain looking. The restaurant is small and suffers from lack of space. But the stuffy and cramped space is compensated by good quantity and quality food. While four or five people can share a soup item, a plate of rice or noodle dish can feed two people. Their meat dishes, on the other hand, whether half a plate or full can be had by two to three people.

Some of their well known and well prepared dishes are mostly from their soup, fried rice and chicken sections. Their popular items are mostly the chicken dishes; more specifically, it is their Lemon Chicken, Chilli Garlic Chicken, Chilli Honey Chicken and Manchurian Chicken that are the fast moving items from the restaurant. The chicken pieces are always big and juicy. Other items to be had from here are the seafood dishes namely Golden Fried Prawn, Chilli Prawn, Chilli Fish and Sichuan Prawn and Fish. Nevertheless, they also make some pretty decent noodle dishes like their Mixed Hakka and Mixed Cantonese chow. One great thing about their meat dishes is that you can have them either dry or wet. They do give you that kind of option. Unfortunately, you cannot round off your meal at the restaurant with desserts as they do not offer that option.

They are very consistent with their food service. The service is fast and efficient and the servers are themselves very friendly and informative. Since they serve food in humongous quantities, it is best to go there with a large group of people in order to have a value for your money kind of experience.

Earlier, Mandarin Restaurant used to be small joint, where Chinese food was excellent. Mostly it used to remain house full.

A few years back, there has been a change in ownership and the quality has fallen to some extent.  I have been dining here for the last 20 years and if it was earlier quality would have rated it 4/5.  

However, with the current food quality, I will rate it 3.5 in a scale of 5.

A sudden rush into nostalgia ushers in when I step into this restaurant. This is one of the reasons of rating this place high. Food quality had been really good when we used to frequent this place quite a few years back. Now it is still decent, however quality has deteriorated over the time. Honey Chilli Chicken dry and Mixed chowmein are still some of my faves though..

This sunday we went for lunch in mandarin. we have been there earlier also but this time we were back after a gap of around 4 months. it was a really disappointing experience. it's quality had detoriated horribly. firstly the ambience is awful. it's not even maintained properly. on reaching we were unceremoniously shunned to a corner. we ordered spring chicken for starters which was bland and completely tasteless.  the waiter had no manners at all. while we were having our starters the waiter came and dumped the main course plates without waiting for us to finish. though the actual dishes arrived much later  had no idea what to do with the empty plates. the shrimps of the mixed fried rise tasted odd and the American chops was a disaster as well. it was inedible. the garlic chicken was too sweet. the prices are on the higher side but the quality was not upto the mark.

This place is definitely one of my favorites when it comes to eating out in South Kolkata, not just because of the food, but also because of the super fast service. I went there recently and ordered in a quick succession the following - 
1. Chicken Asparagus Soup (half)
2. Chicken With Button Mushrooms
3. Mixed Fried Rice
4. Chilli Honey Chicken (dry)

The soup came within 10 minutes of ordering, and with that came our starter of Chilli Honey chicken. The quantity was perfect for the three of us to share and as soon as we were starting, the waiter asked us if we wanted anything more, like a cold drink. As it was exactly what one of our friends were craving, we agreed, and he immediately gave us one. 

The food was piping hot and the mixed fried rice was done perfectly well, and went great with the chicken with button mushrooms, where a lot of tasty mushrooms and chicken lay in a very tasty, albeit non-spicy gravy. 

We finished by ordering some more food for home, and they packed it up for us within 5 minutes of ordering, no kidding! And the food, after being in transit for about 40 minutes was still hot and fresh enough to be eaten. 

Although I would agree that the space looks slightly cramped, it is no different from most Chinese restaurant in Chinatown, a fact that many would agree with me about. I have been here numerous times, and I can very safely say that they are quite consistent service wise and accepts cards, two bonuses which makes me happy.

Today went to this restaurant, have seen this one for long time but never went inside..Ambience is very ordinary, space is small, table are very close to each other, cramped..we ordered mixed fried rice with lemon chicken and chili garlic chicken.. They served very quickly, within 10 mins.. quantity was huge.. One plate of fried rice will be sufficient for 2 hungry people!! half plate of chicken items will have 8 pieces and full will have 16 pieces.. incase of fish and prawn half will have 6 and full 12 pieces respectively,so half plate can be shared by 3 people so very cost effective..fried rice was bit too oily but still very good in taste, lemon chicken was bitter sweet, chilli garlic chicken was good too. chicken pieces were big ,soft and fresh.. overall had a good eating out..if anyone wont like the cramped ambience then he can opt for take away or home delivery..

Mandarin brings some of the most memorable moments spent over their lemon chicken and chicken fried rice. The taste changed over times, the decor shows clear signs of lost glory, the service has deteriorated but the legacy still continues which definitely brings me back again and  again to this place. 

If you can forget the taste of lemon and garlic chicken of the past, I am sure you will have no regret tasting them here in Mandarin. Overall, nostalgically aligned, I am giving it 3 out of 5.

Mandarin is an old restaurant which hasn't really adapted to the ages in terms of marketing, ambience and service. But the food is classic. As always, you can count on this place to impress you just for the food.

The quantity they serve is huge - and that is an understatement. If you want to try several dishes without wasting food you should go in a large group and listen to the advice of the waiters for the quantity to be ordered. The starters are good and the soups are not as bland as I had been warned by a cautious acquaintance. The lemon, garlic and manchurian chicken items are fairly popular and have had their days of glory in the past - and they still manage to evoke some appreciation. The dessert section is non-existent for all practical purposes.

Verdict: It is a low-range Chinese restaurant but if you are willing to deviate a little from your plans, Hatari a few hundred metres away is a better and tastier option.

Very very disappointed with the place. The ambience is ok and the service is quite good. But the food though good in quantity is not upto the mark in taste. I had golden fried prawns, mixed fried rice and chilli garlic chicken. The prawns were not properly coated, the fried rice was too too oily and the chilli garlic chicken had loads of cornflour. The gravy almost solidified after 5 7/8 minutes. I heard quite a lot before coming to this place but is very disappointed.

Heard a lot about this old restaurant and finally got time to visit it on New Year's eve. Frankly i was not disappointed. A good ambiance and awesome food!! I tried the chicken rice noodles and was surprised to find it was not so oily compared to other chinese restaurants. the price may be a bit on the higher side but given the quantity of food they serve, it more than makes up for it. Space is limited so you may face long ques on festive days but its worth the wait.

Memories rush back as I enter Mandarin....Very close to my house, some 2 lanes away, it used to be our usual haunt for chinese and during an era where restaurants were not so common it stood out  here.
My cousin sister who loves chinese used to often visit this when she was here in Kolkata
The problem with this place is much has not changed at all here....Similar menu for so many years....No change in decor or style...Same old bored waiters
The memory of the chilli chicken and the (slightly fried on the base) cantonese noodles still remains
In the middle they had drastically reduced the quality so we had stopped visiting this place.....
It serves good quantity at reasonable prices was my feeling when I visited it on the 25th of December, this year....
Review on basis of what I remember from my past visits as did not have much on this visit
In soup try hot and sour or asparagus both are good
In chicken try out the lemon chicken, the pepper chilly garlic, the manchurian used to be good too....The lemon chicken and Honey chicken was something I loved as a child but no more.....In fact tasted it first time here only
Out here I would suggest the simple fried rice or gravy noodles(not sure if they still fry the base  a bit which used to add to the flavour)...Do not have hakka or chopsuey 
All in all a simple place where you should try out simple dishes

On our last visit the service was very poor....The glass was stained and had some gravy stuck to its brim, and the order was not taken in patience for which my egg chicken fried rice got served as chicken fried rice.....
Was so disappointed with the service that I did not want to tip at all( gave very little tip in the end)
The bad service and boring decor and approximately same prices as Hatari brings them both into competition and Hatari definitely stands out in average priced chinese dining in our area.

If the service picks up and the decor is changed a bit, it can fast regain its past glory.

I have been coming to mandarin for a few years and it always pleased me with its quality and quantity. You can have chineese delicacy with good quantity at a reasonable price. 
The area is a bit small and they lack a little decoration but these are compensated by the food and all. Starting from the starter, you will enjoy a nice meal over here. 
A full hot and sour soup is enough for four people. The schezuan rice and garlic chicken is a must try over here. Pepper drums of heaven was also very good. I will advise to come here with a group which consists at least 4 people as they serve foods with a great quantity. If I had to rate this restaurant, I will go through following sections:

Ambiance: 3
Quality: 4
Quantity: 4.5
Service: 3.5
Price: 4

The ideal place for having chinese with overwhelming quantity and reasonable prices. Service is pleasant and food is just scrumptious and ambience is fine. The place is not lighted much but food makes the restaurant better. Timing of service is good and once i was surprised to hear that one bowl of soup can be shared among 5 people and i was safe that i had ordered only i bowl of soup for my friends. It is situated opposite of Silver Oak and i visit there seldom. Now i will give my opinion upon this restaurant in percentage:

Service:95%
Food:97%
Pricing:96%
This opinion is totally according to me and it may differ. Suggestion goes to folks to have chinese food here. 5 stars always.

It would definitely be an act of exaggeration to rate this restaurant anything more than 1 star.

Atmosphere/Ambiance : The restaurant inside is shady and dark and does not give you a very pleasant feel. You need to request the waiter more than once to give you the menu to start with.
Price : The price is on the upper side considering the ambiance and the place, Kolkata. Many other restaurants would provide you with better rates and taste than this one.
Food quality : Food quality is surely the only point thats scores well in this restaurant.

The place can develop a lot considering its favourable location and reach.

As the name suggests, it's formal. But the environment is just opposite - warm and friendly! The interior of the restaurant with its soft lights gives a cozy feeling. The food is truly delicious it is served in good quantity. A soup for four is sufficient to serve eight people. One of the best Chinese cuisines available in Kolkata is here and you can rely on the quality of food served with closed eyes. The promptness of delivering the order is appreciable. However, there is little parking space available in the front of the restaurant. For a weekend family dine-out, or if you want to spend time with your loved ones, it's one of the best places you'd want to visit many, many times. Not to worry, it is quite affordable!
