Am not a fan of soda based drinks so, an option like this is a boom. Natural and fresh pulpy juice served from the fridge. Definitely thirst quencher, would been nice had they introduce other fruits as well.

This is a small place, where you get fresh grape juice, either you get a glass or you can have a bottle to yourself. The juice definitely is healthy, but as the saying goes all healthy things are not always tasty. I visited this place 2-3 times with a sister of mine. She absolutely loves the juice from here, where i do not find it that amazing, but the best thing is you can feel the pulp in your mouth and that is an awesome juice experience.

This pace is at a by lane in New market area. It is situated on the so called Eat street, connecting Lindsay street with the Humayun Palace. I v been to this place from my teen days. Undoubtedly they make the best grape juice in the city. U can have a glass of juice, or u can buy a bottle for home too.. The best thing about the juice is, they contain some soft grape pulps. U ll have them, in every single sip. It ll add some more taste to the drink!! 
The pocket pinch is reasonable.
If u r yet to try it, dont waste your summer in the other juice parlours. Jus give it a try!!

If u r in esplanade Nd love grapes... In this scorching heat this is place which can boost up ur energy with its pulp grape juice... Frequently i visit it if i need to hv some grape juice.. but i feel quantity is a bit less... And they should start selling other fruit juice too along with grape pulp juice

Pulpy Grape Juice is my favourite grape juice joint of all time.. This small kiosk is located beside the Magnolia Restaurant.
Well, this kiosk sells some amazing pulpy grape juice and is a must try for all the juice lovers.. 
No added colours, fresh, healthy, chilled juice is enough to beat the heat. 
The juices are available in various sizes. They r available in cups and also in bottles (500ml& 1 lt) so it is even convenient for you to carry home. 
Do give it a try!

This small kiosk is located just behind the new empire building and it's a quite famous place among juice lovers. As a grape juice lover I decided to give it a try . The place was very crowded and I had to wait for a good amount of time. The juice I got was thick and pulpy but to be honest I didn't like the taste at all. So definitely will not be visiting again.

Situated in the lane between new empire and lighthouse, this is a small kiosk with not much by way of ambience and seating. The sole person manning the kiosk seemed disinterested. When I asked for one glass of the juice he got up reluctantly. I had some queries but he was disinclined to answer
The juice itself was tasty and refreshing.

Hey, this is a really nice chain coming up here in Kolkata. They serve original grape juice. I love the rich pulpy thing in it and the aroma of fresh grapes crushed into juice. They could have come up with other fruits too. But that has been barred by the name of the chain itself. Would love it if this chain also introduce other varieties in the menu. Happy Dining! :)

One of the better and healthy options to try out in the summer. Although, a tad bit expensive, the Grape Juice gives in a real feeling of having Grapes in actual. The place is cleaner and the juice also tends to seem fresh. Much better option than having a bottle of Cold Drinks.

Pulpy Grape Juice is located into the lane beside City Mart at New Market. Its a small ready to serve juice counter offers black grapes juice in 100ml, 200ml, 500ml & liter plastic bottles. The stall is clean & well decorated with real Black Grapes hanging from the wall.

Coming to the juice, as per their name says you can find real black grapes pulp in their juice that feels like jelly in the mouth. As per their tag line, yes its natural healthy, with no added color & preservative. Now who loves preservative? No one. So health concerns people will love this. It tasted good & ideal for fruit & juice lovers. 

500ml bottle costs Rs. 70 at the time of writing this reviews, that's little pricier. But its something you wouldn't find easily on stalls. On the other hand grapes juice fragrance is awesome & the taste is idol too.

On a summer afternoon while shopping at new market with a friend, we stopped by this shop in search of thirst quenchers. This shop has existed for a long time. They are clean & swift. I tried the watermelon juice and friend had the pineapple juice. Both the juices arrived in reasonable size glass. They were cold and had pure juice(not watery).

The first time I had the Pulpy grape juice was in Bangalore and then became a big fan of it. But sadly, in Kolkata I never had a chance to have this felt really bad and sad.

But voila here it is now just behind the KFC esplanade outlet. Tried the big glass, tasted nice, but as nice as you get in Bangalore, but still nice.

In terms of the cost here it is much cheaper.¬†

Go for it, and you will simply love it.

One of the best grape juice sellers in the city!

This is a small stall in New Market, located right opposite 'Scoop'. Their main branch is in Park Street though.

Flavoursome juice with abundant grape pulp. Reasonably priced. Their USP is that they do not add any flavours and so the health quotient is high.

Grapes and me have an age old connection. It being one of my all-time favoutite fruits i am in love with black grapes. They look yummy and the most important thing. U don't have to de-skin them to have them. Just wash and eat. Being the utmost couch potato that i am if this fruit comes in a juice form then i am like jumping ( in my mind though ).

New market area being the love spot for every shopaholic like me always made me drink cold drinks and other beverages. How i hate cold drinks !! Not a tea or coffee freak !! Then what now.. Then came pulpy grape juice to the rescue.

Its literally so refreshing and good. I felt like having it once more. But i was totally full with the other food that i had and so i drank it at once and only once. Ooppss !! Forgot to click again. Next time sure i assured myself.

Anyways having a glass of juice anytime is simply not a bad idea. :-)

This is one very well-known holy spot for grape juice lovers. The domain in which this joint operates is extremely niche; it just serves pulpy grape juice. But then if you are an expert in one little thing you do, you are sure to make it big. And that is somewhat true with this juice parlor, with their presence in Bangalore and Kolkata they are planning to open up more branches pretty soon. 

LOCATION -----  This small little juice parlor is located right at the heart of New Market opposite New Empire Bar, close to other small eateries like Fast Filling and Momore at Humayun Place. Pretty easy to locate.

AMBIANCE ----- The place is extremely small, just one little kiosk where one person can stand and serve you fresh juice over the counter. There is no sitting arrangement. The kiosk is nicely decorated with artificial grape vines and bunches of grapes. Though the interiors can be kept a little more clean, but then it depends on the person who is staying there at the counter serving the juices all day.

FOOD ----- As said earlier, the place just serves fresh organic health drink in the form of natural grape juice filled with crushed grape pulps in it having some hint of grape seeds as residue. The juice served at this counter is 100% safe, fresh, natural having no artificial color, flavor or preservative. They store the juices in the refrigerator and pour them straight into your glasses once you place an order. So it is extremely refreshing and chilled when served. No extra crushed ice is added to it. It is fruit juice at its best. You can surely have multiple glasses of it at one go, or better you can buy bottles of the juice which is also available at their counter. Now coming to the pulpy part - we are not strangers to pulpy juices in general, but pulp that you'll find in the juices at this place is extremely big and you need to chew them down before swallowing. You can easily use a spoon to have the pulps separately, but then no one does that :) You'll also find some crushed grape seeds at the bottom of your glass indicating that it has been prepared from fresh grapes. The juice is available in small glasses, big glasses and in bottles. We opted for the big glass of juice, it was an ordinary plastic glass but to me the glass was quite small and can no way be termed 'big', the small paper glasses looked better and volume-wise it did not look much different! The person at the counter confirmed the volumes and cleared our doubt pertaining to the quantity. As of today you will get this big glass at INR 30/- and since the juice is so fresh and soul-satisfying it is hard to stop at just one single glass of the drink.

SERVICE ----- As expected the service was extremely prompt, though the juice is not prepared in front of you, fresh bottles of juices are stored in refrigerator. This is because preparing pulpy grape juice is no easy task or some quick activity, you need to pressure cook the grapes and then simmer the flame to cook for some more time. Then you need to add other stuffs like lemon juice, rose essence, etc to make the thing more palatable. Anyway this is the recipe in general, though it is hard to get the recipe used here at this outlet. The person serving the juices at the counter was polite and friendly. You need to pay at this place in cash, no extra taxes charged.

OVERALL ----- Here are my granular ratings:

Juice quantity: 3.7/5
Juice quality: 4.8/5
Presentation: 3.2/5
Value for money: 4.7/5
Service: 4.2/5

A big thumps up from my end for this popular little juice parlor. If you are here at New Market area, make it a point to visit this amazing place; have a few glasses of the drink and carry a few bottles back home. It's the fresh goodness of pulpy grapes!

Cheers!

This is one of my favourite juice centre. It caters only bottled grape juices, but unlike other juice centres in New Market area, it gives juice full of pulp. Whenever I go to New Market I am sure to drink two big glasses of this juice. No need to drink dirty juices or street snacks. Grape juices are here.

This juice came to my rescue after a plate of hot steamy momos nearby. Given the area is famous for all sorts of street food, this juice counter scores above the others in that they are completely healthy and use grape pulp in their juices. Any canned or tetrapak juice in the market hardly contains more than 20 percent of fruit pulp, but this juice is bound to satisfy your thirst as well as the crave for real fruit juice. The tangy dark purple grape pulp with a hint of natural sweetness is the best health drink you can ask for in the New Market area.

They started as an organic pulpy grape juice stall but I don't know if the 'organic' tag s still on or not. Nevertheless THE BEST SUMMER COOLER available in town! I enjoy the grape pulp munching as we drown in the juice. Very healthy n clean outlets. And don't forget to take home a couple bottles! The bottle could be packed better with exact ingredients and nutritional values mentioned(if that had been there I would sure have given them a 5 on 5!). Otherwise all of y'all guys n gals shopping in park street or new market, head in here to get refreshed, and for a change, without lemon too!

A small juice shop corner in the alley beside Scoop, they only serves as the name says pulpy grape juice. For a juice stand they only serves 1 kind of juice. No varieties available. That makes them limited to some people. Price is reasonable though.

A small juice counter in New Market area, which serves only the Purple Grape Juice.

I must say that their description of the juice is very deceptive, because the juice we drink makes us feel that a full peeled grape is coming in our mouth, but it's actually a jelly like substance in the shape of a grape.

A Grape can't remain in a jelly like form after being peeled.!

My friend asked me to try out their grape juice a long time back but i was not that keen to taste it. One fine day while i was passing this joint i suddenly thought of giving it a shot and ordered one big glass which was priced at Rs. 35. One sip made me fall in love with the drink because it was so tasty and the drink also has little pulps in it hence, the name of this joint. I liked it so much that i still crave for it and my humble suggestion to all those who like the flavour of grape is that they must try it out. I also thanked my friend for her suggestion. A great drink for hot summer days as it can refresh even the most tired soul. The best part is the price which is so cheap though i think the menu uploaded in zomato is not the new one.

Great to see my favourite juice shop on zomato. Possibly whenever I get to see this somewhere on the road. I stop by to have the big glass of this pulpy grape juice. My addiction to this shop started at the park street outlet when my friend pritha nearly forced me to have this. Having tasted the pathetic grape juice in other juice bars, I was reluctant to have it. But she skillfully compelled me to taste this hateful grape juice as she said that grape juices bring a glow to your skin. And the first sip , I was blown apart . This tasted heaven. The juice had the original taste of grapes retained and the best part? The pulps that came in the midway while u drink thr juice. I m a fan of this juice bar. Rightly said, the name of the shop complements the juice they sale. The most frequently visited outlet is the esplanade one. Tired of shopping I drink this up, reinforced , I continue the shopping. Enjoy the drink and catch hold of it whenever u see it.

This is located in the lane adjacent to lighthouse cinema and opposite scoop. Its like a roadside stall which is slightly more presentable. After having a heavy  roll from badshah we headed straight here to order grape juice along with mausambi juice. I quite enjoyed the juice as it was very refreshing. The prices are also not high so its a good deal overall. Hygiene wise its better than its peer around that area.

I did not expect such a small fruit juice counter, almost hard to find among the big banners of Park Street to serve such a sumptuous juice which is not just a thirst quencher but a meal in itself! Though they serve only black grape fruit juice, but it is loaded with real grape pulp in every sip. They churn it right in front of you without adding water and is absolutely free of any artificial flavouring chemical that comes in all over the counter fruit juices. The prices are extremely reasonable for such a healthy glass of natural, pulpy grape drink and you can also carry some of it back home in bottles, they sell that too! However, I wish they serve some other fruit juices with all the pulp and expand their outlets to accommodate at least a few people to dine in, especially during the sweltering summer months.

It‚Äôs a small juice stall located in by lanes just besides New Empire building and opposite to the main entrance of Scoop. I got attracted to the purple colour of the juice.  After drinking the pulp I found it was incredibly tasty. If you like a little fruit flesh in your juice, you'll definitely like this. Give it a try and you will feel refreshed and energized.

There is only one item available here, so there isn't much to write... This is a juice kiosk located between lighthouse and new empire. They sell chilled black grape juice with deseeded and peeled black grapes chunks in the juice. In the hot afternoons of kolkata and also in humid evening this place can be quite a boon .

simply love it !

This is a tiny juice parlour located in one of the by lanes connecting the Simpark mall and New Empire building and is just opposite to the main entrance of Scoop. They use ripe black grapes and nothing else to make the juice, keeping its natural flavour intact. You can actually find the real fruit pulp in it without the peel. If you have a soft corner for fresh fruits, then what's better than a glass of natural, pulpy grape juice served chilled, on a sultry afternoon? It is strictly against any artificial content or preservatives. So, next time you're anywhere near the arcade, do make it a point to give this healthy, squashy drink a try! On a side note, I would love more pulpy juice corners for other fruits too!

There's this small outlet of pulpy grape juice in this tiny lane full of fast food outlets in new market. This is bang opposite Shreeram Arcade.
In other cities,this brand of juice is very popular and is easily available for retail purchase. But here I only know of this one place. Its extremely affordable-you could get a reasonable amount of juice for just 25! I often purchase the one liter bottle for just a 100 bucks.
The upside is that fruit juice is really healthy and this one's quite different from the stuff we buy in tetra packs: theres no excessive use of sugar,its quite pulpy with real grape segments and its nice and refreshing in the heat.
The downside is that there's no place to actually sit down and have a drink neither is there any food to go with it or any variations in the drink. Of course,the lane is filled with food of a similar price range so it doesn't pose a problem except for the seating.
