Grabbed a quick dinner here. I found the counter a bit crowdy so thought they might be serving better food. Ordered one grilled non veg platter which had some 9 pieces of chicken n fish kebabs. Later we ordered north Indian non veg platter which had some decent quantity of food, included romali roti ,paneer pulav, Kaali daal , navaratna curry and murgh lababdar. Amount was pretty decent but food tasted not that great. Okay for one time visit!

The chicken Reshmi kebab and tikka kebab was good. The fish tikka was so so. The chicken wings were poor to taste. The chutney served with these was also not good.

It's in the food court of mani sqr mall and offers grilled indian food, they have a limited no. of items and some combos in their menu, i have had two of them, except the portions they were similar, in taste,  in plating but the food isn't fresh all the time so m rating them average..

The staff was friendly and courteous and helped us find the most suitable combination. We ordered Rumali Roti and Murg Lababdar and it was absolutely delicious. The service was prompt too. Highly recommended.

Visited this food outlet in the Mani square food court during the Poila Boisakh offer where all food items are served for Rs61 all inclusive,we opted for the chicken wings along with a glass of coke but to our disappointment the chicken wings were tasteless it lacked salt and spices but we cannot ask for much in that price but still it ought to be a little better than what we were served .

Tried their Assorted Kebab Platter. First experience not a good one. Price was reasonable, kebabs were soft, quantity was also adequate but taste not good. Moreover, they spread chat masala over the kebabs which made it aweful. Mint chutney was full of water.

It is located on the second floor of mani square. Visited this place recently. We tried malai paneer and chicken wings. The malai paneer could have been better.

Had tried the chicken tangri kebab here. The quality of the food was good but it was very much overpriced. Also the delivery took a long time and staff behaviour needs to improve

This is one of the kiosks in Mani Square focusing on all grilled food, both Indian and Continental. You will get wings here as well as kebabs. We went for trying kebabs here during the Noboborsho food carnival. They were fish tikiya and haryali kebab. The fish tikiya was nice, fish being tender and spices well blended. But the haryali kebab was pathetic. It was extremely spicy, which is very unlikely for its variant.

I mostly had starters from here. Namely, the Kebabs..
Chicken Tangri kebab is good here. The Chicken Reshmi kebab couldn't impress me much.
Good kebabs at pocket friendly prices without charging any extra taxes. Recommended.

If you ought to checkout this outlet, you'll be highly impressed. Great looking kebabs at such affordable prices. 
The taste too leaves you with a good feeling. Most of the times the kebabs were upto the mark. The quantity is less but again, a food court, adding no extra taxes serving you kebabs are good rates.

Grill mates serving amazing grilled chicken.

We tried the kalmi tikka and tangri kebab. Both contained 2 pcs chicken in each plate. They were very very tasty. The accompaniments were mint chutney and salad. The mint chutney was  watery and lacked no flavour at all. 

Am giving good marks for service and delivery. And definitely the taste of the kebabs.

The food they offer is okayish although a bit pricey.The drumstick that they serve in the combo is absolutely horrible with no taste at all,a lot spicy and colour.What i found strange is when i asked for a glass of cold drink they within a second offered me the same without even asking me whether i wanted coke thums up or sprite etc.The person who swiped the food court card argued that cold drink meant pepsi only so he served the same.Repeatedly he went on repeating the same words and he was speaking in such harsh and rude language, it really astonish me a lot.I really dont know how this old man has been recruited as a staff! He simply went on arguing.Later another man came from inside asking me which drink i would like to order and then gave me the same.Kindly management take a note of the same and mend things appropriately.Simply because of some ill behaved staff you are losing your market.

Grill Mates at Mani Square serves you good North Indian food with the swipe of your registered food court card. 

Although the items here maybe a bit pricy considering it is just a food court counter, I found their platter section to be pocket friendly with respect to the quantity. 

For example, the last time I visited I ordered their Char Grilled Non Vegetarian Platter. It served me with five decent pieces of grilled meats, prepared and served two ways: Reshmi Kebab and Tikka Kebab. Furthermore, they gave me both pulao and roti with the other mentioned items. The customers also have the liberty to take a plate of extra pulao instead of roti and vice versa, which impressed me. 

Service was a disappointment. I received my ordered platter half an hour late. However the quantity and the quality both made up for it. 

Grill Mates, keep up the good work!

Grill Mate is located in the food court of Mani Square that is on the 3rd floor. With quite a good options of Veg & Non Veg Platter still as the name is Grill Mates then trying some grilled items from here is a good idea.

Grilled Chicken Wings : Grilled Chicken Wings pieces came with green sauces & salad. Green Sauce were very lite that felt it was mixed with water to increase the quantity. Chicken pieces were soft but it felt that it was steamed rather than grilling. However it tasted like the chicken was boiled & cooked then lightly grilled. It was very less spicy, even there was very less salt used. Overall Grilled Chicken Wings was kind of tasteless & felt like chicken pieces were picked up from chicken soup or curry.

Grill Mates is a total disappointment to the taste bugs. Prices are as per like other food counters of Mani Square food court but taste of the food doesn't justify this at all. Choosing Grill Mates over others was such a bad deal for me.

A quality outlet serving both veg & non-veg grilled items at Mani Square mall. You can go for meal plates which will come along with rice, apt for lunch or heavy snacks. We went in for Chicken Tengri kababs. One plate had two big chicken legs. From the very first bite, we realized that the chicken was very well marinated and grilled to perfection. The spices were found deep within and the chicken was very soft and succulent. The kababs had lemon juice and chaat masala sprinkled over it and came with a small bowl of pudina chutney and onion salad. So this dish was really nice. But would like to try out other few items next time to get a better outlook. Overall, I'll be coming back for sure. Cheers!
