If you happen to visit Behala and are craving for south Indian tiffin, this is the place where you should head to . Authentic south Indian tiffin is available here. I have lost count of the number of times I had eaten here. Dropped here today after few years, the quality,quantity,staff behaviour- everything remains the same,-top notch!
Bru coffee is a pure bliss here. Apart from that all types of dosa,idli,utthapam,vada,sambar vada everything tastes wonderful . There isn't any ambience, this happens to be a small place with a kirana store on one side and tables placed on the other. One can find all sorts of south indian spices,fries,pickles here in the kirana store. Do try this place atleast once, you are gonna fall in love with it! I can vouch for it ðŸ˜Š

One point less for its lack of proper seating arrangement. It's a grocery store cum dine-in sort of a place hidden beside Panna Sweets, Behala and difficult to locate. But it serves delicious dosas and is a treasure trove for south indian food lovers. I have been there a couple of times and it's almost always crowded and is good for take-away orders. I quite liked the masala dosa and the doi bora there. Pocket-friendly and extremely popular with the locals, give this place a try if you can ignore the ambiance and enjoy your food.

Best for take aways. The dosas are a delicacy as well as the sambhar. Even the idlis seem so tasty that you can eat them without any condiments. Must try this place out for once at least.

First of all, finding this shop is a little challenging. It is lost in the hustle and bustle of the surrounding market. Food here is nice and the quality is good too but I always feel things should be more well organised and little improvement of the sitting arrangements.

If u are a  lover of South Indian food or even if u are not such a fan of south indian cuisine,this place will perhaps change your mind.In one word this place in a Hidden Gem.The dosas are made In heaven.I was not a great lover of south Indian food when my friend took me here and believe me,its awesome.Since then I've tried many of their dishes  and have never been disappointed.Service is great,your sambar and chutney is refilled without even your saying it.All of this at a super affordable prices with 0 tax.Also,seating is available though there's no AC or proper ambience.If u want good south Indian food in behala,go for  this one only.

If you are in Kolkata and you get the filter coffee that is a speciality of south India then you must be very lucky. This place also offers crisp idli, dosa and vada. The location is a bit on the interior else it would have provided stiff competition to United Cafe for south Indian food lovers in Behala.

A bit hard to locate!!! 
But this place is a paradise for south Indian food lovers!!! 

This place is half shop and half restaurant... 

Masala dhosa is the best masala dhosa I ever had!!! 

Staffs are friendly, actually very helpful too.. 

But the Ambience is bit shabby!! 

P. S: you can shop from there too.. 

Some ready made bada mix, idly, dhosa mix..  

A must try for south Indian food lovers!!

This establishment is more of a shop than a restaurant for my liking. Although you get very keralite brands of food and daily use groceries to buy here, please beware as they generally scratch out the dates and sell expired products as I have noticed on more than one occasion. The food is delicious, so is their coffee. But I have my doubts as to whether they use expired products on making the food too.

I am going to this place since time immemorial. I have literally grown up on their dosas and idlis. It is a pure south indian restaurant cum grocery store. U get everything here belonging to southern India. I love their dosas and idlis. U can also try their filter coffee.

4 masala dosa's!!

review - good but i like united cafe dosa's more though the torkari they gave in the dosa was the best it contained beet gajar coconut pieces n all... whereas united cafe gives just alu peyaj and badam :v :P :3 the dal was too spicy :/ and the white chutney was so so :/

so in total i will rate South Indian Coffee HouseÂ 3 out 5!

This place is what we call a TRUE SOUTH INDIAN food joint.  The place is run by south indian people and you will get all types of south indian dishes here.  Its a kind of punch of south indian grocery cum dining place.  I have been visiting this place since I was a toddler and now I am 21 and I have no complains.  Yes the cooking area is not that clean and dining place is cramped but yes if your not a great bugger about ambience you cam check in and have a taste at some quality food.

Visited this joint with a friend and tried their dosa...it was normal but the sambar was real good and enhanced the taste of the dish...ambience is poor...there is a shortage of space resulting in crampedness and the wash basin was dirty...
