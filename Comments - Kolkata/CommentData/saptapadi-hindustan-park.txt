"Ei poth jodi na sesh hoy tobe kemon hoto tumi boloto!"

The restaurant which is decorated with all the Uttam-Suchitra moments will definitely make you nostalgic once you step there in ♥ comes up with a brilliant idea of Bengali fusion menus which simply wowed us and the jhalmuri vetki absolutely met our expectations👌👌

Then came Basanti polao and Saptapadir abhinobo murgi which were indeed excellent!!! The flavours of spices were too good 😘😘

Last but not the least the dessert "Icecream Patisapta" , again an unique recipie..the cold icecream inside and the hot outsider patisapta coating..hat's off to their innovative ideas 🙏

Will visit this place again very soon! 😍😍

The food is delectably unique, reminiscent of homely Bengali flavours with an unexpectedly different twist, which suited our palate very well.We ordered the moori fish sticks, the litchi lanka sherbet, Abhinovo mangsho, moirala machher muitha, with rice ad luchi. And by the end of the meal, we were already planning our next visit. Great ambience, helpful staff and brilliant mood music. Lovely :')

Bengali cuisines are those if you serve them properly they will eventually taste great and specially to bongs. And nothing can beat if you get those with nicely decorated which embarks the essence of Bengali's one of the best films Saptapadi.coming to food.
We have taken Dio rui and Pabda jhaal ,posto and Sukto the dishes may not be works class but in that price bracket they were very tasty and plating was good too. 
Will recommend for bongs for sure.

We were looking for a bengali restaurant for a change. Visited with a group of friends and thought to share the whole experience.

Food 3/5
Ambience 4/5
Service 1/5
Staff Behavior 1/5, perhaps 0

One negative thing that I must mention is the waiters were not at all cooperative and rude. One of them got into mess with another customer. They must improve their hospitality. Their attitude was a big turn off.

Saptapadi is a typical quaint eatery located in Hindustan Park known to offer popular Bengali cuisines. However as far as the food is concerned I did not find it as mindblowing as it is advertised to be, perhaps owing to the ongoing rush of the day (that kept many waiting in line outside eager to grab a coveted seat) or perhaps to us their food generally didn't live up to its hype and expectations.

Decor is attractive, with a comfy wooden finish and black-and-white photographs of the evergreen duo Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen occupying centre stage, along with books and mugs on a wooden rack, window blinds, woven table mats, earthen jars and an earthenware water jug readily available on tables to pour oneself one's water without asking waiters.
Soft melodies from the star pair's classic Bengali films are played in the background, including "Saptapadi" after which the restaurant is named and themed.

Servers are efficient at serving but wasted quite a lot of our time before visiting our table to take the order, for most of them were attending to the guests attending a private event on the other side of the eatery.

We'd visited it for lunch, and tried the steamed rice with Bhaja Moong Dal, Jhuri Alu Vaja, Posto-r Bora, Rasun Bhetki Paturi, Saptapadir Avinabo Murgi, Ice-cream Patisapta, Gondhoraj Caramel Custard and Misti Doi.

All the items were more or less good to taste, except the posto bora which were terrible and absolutely saltless. The dal and aloo bhaja too were less in salt and could have been made better tastewise.
The paturi wasn't exceptionally the best, for I've had better paturi at other reputed Bengali restaurants in the city, but satisfactorily well-tasting.
Chicken had a different kind of taste, good enough accompaniment for the rice.
The misti doi was excellent, as was the caramel custard, but the patisapta wasn't very impressive.

Among the many eateries catering to Bengali cuisine, Saptapadi can be given a place, though not among the top-notch ones in the city. A good place for Uttam-Suchitra fans, but speed of service needs to be improved, management can be more orderly, leaving a lot of space for the improvement of the tastes of the variety dishes.

Went from north kolkata to this place for a friend who craves Bengali cuisine whenever she is in Kol. It always remains in our head.. Why bengali food which is "ghar ka khana". We reached the location around 12:30. The ambiance in keeping with the name is covered with pics of Uttam Suchitra. We ordered lichi lankar sarbot.. Lichi drink with a tinge of heat. Then aam porar sarbot.. Nice taste. And also gondhoraj cha.. Very refreshing all. Then as starters had fish fry.. Typical but very tasty.. We also had moori coated fish finger.. Not as tasty as the fish fry. Last starter of the day murgi chingrir tok jhal.. Tangy and tasty. For mains we had rice, alu bhaja, piyaj posto r bora, chitol macher muitha and daab chingri. Daab chingri.. A bit on the bland side and and muitha soft (unlike most places where it is hard) and spicy. We spent hours there and found the place filling up. Clearly quite popular to command that kind of crowd for a weekday lunch.

Few days ago, after visiting the kalighat kali temple, We went to this beautiful outlet for lunch. As my mom wanted to try some bengali cuisine food we(and also my 6 year old little cousin :P) opted for Saptapdi. First coming to the decor, it goes with the legendary bengali movie "Saptapadi" of Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen, the ambience is just perfect with the classic bengali songs making the mood even better.

  We ordered, * Rice

                       * Luchi

                       * Moong dal

                       * jhuri alu vaja

                       * Bhapa murgir paturi

                       * Saptapadir avinavo murgi

All the dishes were amazing and specially saptapadir avinava murgi was really delicious. Staffs were courteous. Looking forward to visit again to try their thalis.

After a long time, enjoyed the Bengali fusion dishes! Coming to the interior decor and ambience, it really suits the mood of a Bengali... You can also get a chance to hear to Shyamal Mukherjee, hemanta and manna de who are about to get extinct in the era of anupam and savvy! Coming back to the dishes, we placed a fusion dish named Moori fish sticks and it really justified the name! Then we went for achari gondhoraaj chicken, sankharpur er crab and rice. We also had kacha aam er shorboth and as a sweet tooth we couldn't think of anything better than nolen guurer rosogolla and mishti doi!! All of the dishes were really amazing and the waiters were courteous as well... Would love to visit this place again!

This review is based on my both visit at saptapadi...one at 1st week of december and second one at christmas eve... nd undoubtedly i can say both visit of mine were amezing... that place gives the authentic bengali food with a beautiful ambiance based on portrait of movie 'saptapadi' and the stars of the movie suchitra sen and uttam kumar. 
   Now coming to the food ..
1.) In my first visit we had jaljeera and kacha aam er sorbot as beverage,muri fish stick as starter, two chicken mutton thali, morola macher charchuri. 
First,coming to the starter, in single plate there were 4 pieces of fish stick. Size of that was good nd it was served with salad and sorse kasundi. The taste of it was so good that I really have no word to explain. Every one should try this.
 Now the thali- The quantity of the was enough for one and the thali contains luchies, alur dum, vaja, 1 piece chicken which was cooked by green chillies and looks totally green and 1 piece mutton which was mutton kosha. And we took pulao as there was option between rice and pulao. Lastly the give papad, chatni nd rosgolla as dessert. 
 Lastly the morola chorchuri, its quality and quantity both are sufficient. It can be shared in sufficient amount among 4 people. Though it was little bit spicy.
2) now my second visit- i went with my family and we were 10 people. In starter we had the same muri fish stick. In main course, we had one chicken mutton thali, plain rice, macher matha moog dal, plain moog dal, mocha ghonto, severel types of fish including pomfret masala, bhetki paturi, sorse ilish, chitol peti. All preparations of fish were really so good except the chitol peti. The chitol peti disappointed us as the peti was not actual type of peti which it should be. Otherwise everything was good. Specially the sorse ilish,it was nicely coocked. Beside these, we ordered aluvaja,  saptapadir avinava murgi and saptapadi avinava mangso which was a mutton preparation. Both the meat item was excellient. Nd yes., the pulao was very good in both quality and quantity. Lastly i should say about the excellent chatni and dessert.  We ordered rosgolla which was nicely served in a small clay glass and the showstopper was the patisapta icecream which overwhelmed us.
               Overall,great experience.

This is the best Bengali food I ever had what I call is " best maach place" you all need to visit especially non- Bengali who are from other states and I would really say it really and nice desirable experience I had here the ambience was good purely nice authentic Bengali cuisine and just awesome.
Talking about dishes we ordered fish thali and some luchi and
Kancha lanka murgi and everything was just awesome and Bhetki paturi was just splendid the best one I liked, chicken was ok and rest everything else was just too good in thali.
I would really recommend this place to visit at least once on your food trip to Kolkata.

Bit late for the review, visited Hindustan Park outlet for Sadh (baby shower). We have ordered 1 veg thali, panch rakam bhaja, 1 plain rice, 2 vetki fry, 2 paturi and dab chingari. Thali was consist of pulao, 2 no luchi, aloo dum, fulkopi, dhoka r dalana, aloo bhaja, chutni, papad, rasogolla. Sukto was also there in thali but the staff were well concerne about pregnency and did not serve it, coz papaya was in it. Ambience was good, food served in earthenware.

Wanted a nice bengali restaurant to take my parents for lunch and stumbled upon this place in zomato. Glad I went to this awesome place. Centrally located in purna Das road it was quite easy to find it. The restaurant is a small and Cosy place. The ambience was very nostalgic and rustic. Coming to food we ordered fish and vegetarian thali. Super impressive. Nothing in that plate tasted even a bit bad. My dad usually doesn't approve of anything so easily went ga ga over this place. Thumbs up for this place.

I heard many times about the ambience, food and theme of the restaurant but today finally got a chance to visit this restaurant. We went early afternoon so easily got table no waiting. Now coming to  the review part:
—The ambience, decor/theme and cleanliness of the restaurant was too good. We were welcomed with a big smile by one of the attendant of the restaurant. The ambience is really nice and theme is old bengali films and famous bengali film jodi Uttam and Suchitra. Also where we got table in front of the famous poster of Uttam-Suchitra and enfield head was fitted. Also the plates, glass and jug are of teracotta finish. Very nice.

—Now, the food, price, quantity and taste. There are two types of menu: One is Traditional and second is Fusion. Also, you have option to have thali and a-la-carte. We opted for a-la-carte. We were bit confused and the attendant helped us and suggested what to have from the fusion delicacies. We ordered for Chicken-Chingri Lollipop as starter (Fusion food), Misti pulao, Kacha Lanka Chicken, Doi Bhetki, Katla Kalia as main dish and from dessert we ordered for Pathishapta Ice cream. The starter was awesome in taste juicy inside and crispy outside with proper blend of tangy sauces. The dish contained 3 pieces, but the attendant helped us by serving four and charging accordingly. The main course was good and quantity for one is perfect. The size of the fish chunk and also chicken was very good. Taste of the dishes was good but not so spicy. According to me the dishes could have been little spicy like Kacha Lanka Chicken and Katla Kalia. Overall the main course was good. Now, coming to dessert Patishapta Ice cream mind blowing fusion and awesome in taste. It will look like a chamcham but when you take the first bite you will be like WOW!!! So when ever you go please have this. Price of the food is also very reasonable and tax is only 5% gst. 

I will visit this restaurant again and will recommend others too. Next time i will try Daab Chingri with

We took seven steps to this food haven and like the superhit pair of Uttam-Suchita, our gastronomic duet with food also turned out well. We had Lichu-Lanka sharbat, the quite innovative Murgi-P0sto bora and Maach-Muri bhaja as appetizer. Mishti Polao, Potoler Dolma, Bati Chingri and Anchari Mangsho along with kaacha aam er chatni and papad to be wrapped up with another innovative dessert - the Ice cream Patisapta. Food was deliciously bangali, not heavy on the stomach although the proportion amounts need to be revised a bit. Service and attention is good. Overall our 11 th marriage anniversary lunch was commendable.

The ambience is what made me go back to my childhood days where my grandma would make me listen to "ei poth jodi na sesh hoy"..  If the contemporary world has still not killed the" Bangali" in you, go visit this restaurant for reminiscing over Uttam and Suchitra. There fusion menu is truly intriguing for your taste buds.  Lichoo lonka shorbot is a must try! Also the moori  fish stick (yes the puffed rice for the most) was truly amazing!! Ovet all great food and nostalgic ambience.. Salt in the food was little less, but less is any day better than more! A recommended visit with family!

Heard that Saptapadi is one of the best places to enjoy the taste of bengali potluck. So I decided to visit this place. This restaurant has a good decor keeping the congruity with its name with pictures of Uttam-Suchitra movie. We ordered pulao wish was really good, kosha mangso having more bones and less meat but good to taste as kosha mangso never betrays, and baked daab chingri alaska whick I did not like personally. We had to wait for a little long after ordering our food. Otherwise this place is nice.

The location was good. The ambience would surely make you nostalgic. But the main part i.e the food did not meet expectations. The fish was not fresh though the curry made up for it. Chicken achari gondoraj was mediocre. Overall it's good for one time visit for decor and feel.

The ambience is what made me go back to my childhood days where my grandma would make me listen to "ei poth jodi na sesh hoy"..  If the contemporary world has still not killed the" Bangali" in you, go visit this restaurant for reminiscing over Uttam and Suchitra. There fusion menu is truly intriguing for your taste buds.  Lichoo lonka shorbot is a must try! Also the moori  fish stick (yes the puffed rice for the most) was truly amazing!! Ovet all great food and nostalgic ambience.. Salt in the food was little less, but less is any day better than more! A recommended visit with family!

It was a really nice experience ! The food was really exquisite. What's important is that the prosperity of a restaurant having it's specialty in bengali cuisine ! This restaurant thrives even with strong competitors just being round the corner. The bhetki fry was really delicious and one needs to taste it !

Heard that Saptapadi is one of the best places to enjoy the taste of bengali potluck. So I decided to visit this place. This restaurant has a good decor keeping the congruity with its name with pictures of Uttam-Suchitra movie. We ordered pulao wish was really good, kosha mangso having more bones and less meat but good to taste as kosha mangso never betrays, and baked daab chingri alaska whick I did not like personally. We had to wait for a little long after ordering our food. Otherwise this place is nice.

If anyone wants to relive the Uttam-Suchitra feel, then no other place can surpass this restaurant; a splendid ambience enhanced with the earthen finished utensils and the nostalgic music from the golden era..
I've been to a number of bengali cuisines but by far this restaurant has been the best with the delicious food served with utmost welcome spot on time;
Abhinava saptapadi mutton and dab chingri are a must try.. all in all full points to the food, service and above all the ambience.. in my suggestion i would tell the foodies to once visit this place else will be a miss

The restraunt is in Hindustan Park.
If you ar crazy authentic Bengali Food lover, this is a place you must visit. The ambience is just awesome with pictures and beautiful moments of the two legends Mahanayak Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen. They plates and glasses look like mud utensils and even the water is kept in a pot like that.
Now the food. We took rice, some starters and mocha, but i really want to mention is the Saptapadi Special Mutton and the Kachalonka Chicken.
The muton was really good. It was made of various spices and a lot of crushed black pepper. The perfect spicy mutton. The chicken was not that spicy, but the flavour of green chilli(kachalonka) and coriander leave made it just delicious. 
The staffs are really good. They served the food on time and behaved really well.
So if you are in a search of a good bengali lunch, then you must visit this place.

This restaurant is located at Hindustan Park serves bengali dishes. We went for mahanayak thali and we loved it. Mahanayak thali includes bhaat, alubhaja,  beguni,  chicken fries,  vetki fry, sukto,  daal,  sorshe Ilish, mutton , chingri macher malaikari, roshogolla,  chatni, papad and lichu Lanka sarbat. It easily serves two people well with one extra bowl of rice. Ambience was okayish and service was very good. My personal favourite is lichu Lanka sarbat. First time tried a sarbat which was sweet as well as little spicy.

I visited this place during Durga Puja, 2017 with Srijita Guha . Like many restaurants this place also had a separate (read limited items) menu card during that period. The food is quite tasty. We ordered Bhetki Fish Fry (not the best I have had, it was okay), Plain rice,  Pabda, Sorshe Ilish and Mutton with Black Pepper. I loved their Pabda, Hilsa is mustard was decent enough and Mutton was perfect to have with Sweet Pulao. All in all, a good experience. 

Ambience : 6.5/10 (air conditioning not good enough when crowded) 
Food : 7.5/10 (I'd suggest everyone to visit now, since Durga Puja rush is over) 
Service : 7/10 (I'm sure it is better during normal days)

Everything was amazing and true to its bong taste. Loved the sarbat, kosha mangsho n pulao. Along with the food nice ambience, good music, good service. Truly a nice experience. Highly recommended.

We went to Saptapadi on Durga Puja this year. It is located near Hindustan Park. This is a proper Bengali restaurant. You'll feel the essence of it as soon as you enter the place. The good thing was we didn't have to wait in queues for hours. We were seated as soon as went inside. It has a very soothing ambience with soft lighting and beautiful decorations. There were pictures of Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen among other decorations. We ordered Mishti Pulao, Luchi, Kosha Mangsho, Kosha Murgi, Kochipathar Jhol, Bhetki Paturi, Chatni and Papaad. However initially we were told Luchi is not available even though we saw a woman in the table next to ours having it. After we requested a number of times, they agreed to serve us Luchi. Otherwise the service was excellent. Also, we were served with Paan and Saunf at the end which was a perfect end of a perfect dinner. Burp!

Saptapadi, the name itself strikes the right chords in the mind of a Bengali. Located right beside teroparbone and jhale jhole ombole, this place is far superior to both of them, in terms of food. I visited this place for my nabami lunch and got a 1 hour waiting ( the seating capacity of this place is very very small) . They had a limited menu during Pujo days but all their main dishes were available. We had shukto, bhaat, daal, bhetki macher fry, paneer hing dalna, daab chingri, Kochi pathar jhol and mutton lanka shorshe. Among beverages, the litchi lonka shorbot is highly recommended. All the items were perfect and considering the Pujo rush, they deserve appreciation for maintaining the quality and taste. However, they must do something about their seating area, or else they will be missing out on a chunk of crowd during special days.

Ordered
1.vetki macher paturi
2.kosha mangsho
3.polau
4.cold drink

1.vetki r paturi- when recieved it was frozen..i opened up the leaf wrap and found the fish to be hard frozen..
Later they replaced it but i doubt they may have microwaved the same fish instead of giving a fresh piece..
But no doubt the paturi was very tasty

2.pulao- very very nice..top notch in quality and also in taste..
3.kosha mangso- it hardly had any mutton in it..only bones of mutton..and if any hard like anything to tear off and eat..the gravy was good.. but we went to have mutton kosha not the kosha only..
Had a bad experience 😐😒

Heard of this place a lot mostly famous for their authentic bengali thaali. It offers different kinds of thaali but since I went to this place during Durga Puja so only had the option of choosing from the set menu. I took the mahanayak thaali which comprised of aam pora shorbot, mug daal, aloo posto, beguni, fish fry, jhuri aloo bhaja, two pieces of dhaniya chicken (a dry starter), ilish sorshe, chingri malai curry, mutton kosha, chutney and a sweet. All items were mesmerising except the fish fry which seemed quite soggy. All these for 999 + GST.

Visited for the second time on 25th September. The Bengali retro aura along with delicious food make this restaurant one of my all time favourites.
The restaurant creates a totally Bengali atmosphere by portraying everywhere the golden era of Mahanayak Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen. Admist of these the cassic Bengali background music mesmerises me everytime.
We ordered Parsley Lanka Mangso, Bata Masala Murgi and Misti Pulao for main course. Pulao was sweet and tasty. The preparation of mutton with an exclusive Bengali touch was mind boggling; the meat was soft, tender and served hot by then. The chicken preparation was also good and not too much spicy. Service was prompt and staffs were very helpful.
Having lunch with amazing variety of Bengali dishes and a magical Bengali ambience; what else a Bengali need?

We chose one Pujo special thali worth rupees 1k plus taxes,Litchi lonkar sherbat and extra rice.
The thali had bhetki fry,ajwani chicken fry,Jhuri aloo bhaja,Beguni,Sona moong daal,aloo posto,Chingrir malaikari,Mutton kosha,shorshe ilish and desserts.

All the items tasted nice except the prawn malaikari which was saltless and bland.
The Dal and aloo posto was also not upto the mark.
Mutton and sorshe ilish tasted great.
Also,the litchi lonka sherbat is a must try here.
The thali ended with rosogolla,chutney and papad.

The rice in the thali is extremely less for one person so extra rice is must.
Ambience is beautiful.
Service is prompt.
They levy 18% GST on food.

Saptapadi this restaurant located in Hindustan park. It's a bengali cuisine restaurant as i'm looking for authentic bengali cuisine. We went there on Navami Evening ,reservation was not required. The restaurant ambience is simple but eye catchy.Crowd was there but we got our sit. Now coming to the food -- ordered my favourite Rice,Macher matha die daal,Prawn Malai curry,Aloo bhaja, bata masala murgi, pabdar jhaal, bhetki fry chatni with papad. Firstly rice with macher matha die daal was good along with aloo bhaja, in prawn malai curry prawn was well cooked and the taste was good, the taste of bata masala murgi was also good no doubt,chicken was soft, talking about fish pabdar jhal was also good in taste, tried also their bhetki fry it was fresh and really good in taste. But in the beginning we had to wait for the food service was slow but the staffs are helpful otherwise it was a good experience.

I visited this place during puja. I am really disappointed with the arrangement and the way they were serving because most of the people serving there were unprofessional and always in a hurry.
Secondly the foods we ordered starter "Lanka Posto Murgi" and really disappointed because if you are going to buy that dish from outside it might cost hardly rupees 100 I think that is also much if you see the dish they provided other then that we order misti polao and mutton both are good in respect of quality.
But the quantity is less. So I will rate 2.5 as I am totally disappointed with this restaurant.

I hv been waiting for a long time to visit the place but somehow i couldnot make it out.anyway finally i have been there on the Nabami..
The restro is dressed up with so many uttam-suchitra pics as the name says "saptapadi"
We ordered " MAHANAYAK THALI".it includes:
SADA VAT
MACHER MATHA DIYE DAL
ALU VAJA
BEGUNI
ONE VEG SABJI ITEM
SALAD
VETKI BUTTER FRY
POSTO CHILI CHICKEN
KOCHI PATHAR JHOL
CHINGRI MACH ER MALAIKARI

One tkhli is enough for single individual..but i suggest don't go for sharing that between two.that might be insufficient..
Service was good enough..they offered "lebu lonka sorbot" at the very begining..it was superb in taste.
I would like to visit the place again nd will go for individual item but thali..

A fairly simple and fairly satisfying pujo meal. They are doing a very limited and even further limited vegetarian menu. So I had the beguni, moong dal and paneer dalna with rice. All good but unmemorable. What was was the litchi + chilli drink and the mishti doi. A good start & end to the meal, if you can overlook the bill due to doubled up pujo prices.

We ordered macher mathar daal, fulkopi, daab chingri, gondhoraj vetki paturi, sorshe ilish, kochi pathar jhol. Everything tasted awesome.  The mutton was soft and perfectly cooked.  But the vetki paturi was okayish and the fish wasn't that fresh.  Hilsa again was perfect with the right kind of shorshe gravy..

On 23rd September we went for dinner at Hindusthan Park outlet of this famed restaurant. The decor and ambiance is on point. But what disappointed me was the menu. Since they introduced the Puja special menu there was a limited choice of food. The service was good. We ordered Mishti Pulao which was not impressive. The Beguni was crispy. What I loved the pmost is Parsley Lanka Murgi, it was yumm. Worth mentioning was Dhokar Dakba, which was Day's Special Veg. Dhoka was well fried and soft. The bill was moderate.

I like the decor of this restaurant more than the food. Enlarged photos of suchitra sen and uttam kumar from the movie saptapadi predictably adorn the walls .Old movie songs play in the background. The ambiance is pretty quaint. The service is also quite good. They serve traditional bengali food as well as fusion. We tried the traditional ones like dal,posto bora, ilish sorshe, doi ilish and mutton. The food is decent.

To tell you the truth, I visited the restaurant on basis of zomato review. We were 11 people who visited the restaurant. We had to wait more than 2hrs to get the table which was understandable since we were a large team and it's astami. The ambiance was good but we were offered 3 separate tables. Coming to the food 'it was horrible'. 
The bhetki in paturi was smelling rotten
The mutton which was served tasted sweet and devoid of any flavour.
The chingri malaikari was over sweet and devoid of taste. 
I can go on . Every dish was tasteless and food served were sweet. The dessert that was served was rasgulla which was not fresh. 

I don't know if I will visit again and to all the people who will read this review I urge u all to avoid this restaurant

Food is good. Value for money. I wish if the vetki paturi had been a little more smokey and juicy it would have been 100% perfect pujo lunch ☺. Ambience is good. The staffs are also very polite.

My sister went to this place on tritiya and the way she described after coming home i then and there cancelled the j w Marriott buffet plan on saptami and planned to try this place out. Due to puja the rush was too much and we had to wait 35-40 minutes but after we got the seats the waiting time was negligible. For the three of us we ordered one mahanayak thali, one normal thali, one mishti Pulao, one lichu lonka shorbot and one aami pora shobat. Total bill inclusive of everything was 2358/-. Surprisingly even with so much crowd the taste of each dish was amazing. For a person like me living away from home for years now coming back to Kolkata for the festival and tasting such delicious food was an absolute bliss. Both my parents also enjoyed the food as well as the uttam and suchitra created ambience. The staff were so polite and repeatedly kept asking about the food and if everything is fine. I'll definitely go back to this place. Specially for the bhetki ajwain bhaja.

পূর্ণ দাস রোড এ দুইতলা বাড়ির উপরের তলাতে অবস্থিত এই রেস্তোরাঁ।

উত্তম কুমার - সুচিত্রা দেবী অভিনীত সপ্তপদী ছায়াছবির নানান মুহূর্ত দিয়ে অন্দরসজ্জা অতি অপরূপ।

এবার খাবারে আসি। দূর্গাপুজো উপলক্ষে খাবারের মেনু অন্যান্য দিনের থেকে অনেকটা আলাদা। আমরা প্রথমে AAM PORA SORBOT ও LICHU LONKA SORBOT দিয়ে শুরু করলাম। এরপর আমরা এই রেস্তোরাঁর প্রধান আকর্ষণ MAHANAYAK THALI (special item) তে মননিবেশ করলাম।

খাবারের মান বেশ ভাল। একটি মহানায়ক থালি একার জন্য অনেকটা বেশি। এই থালির সাথে এক প্লেট ভাত বা পোলাও যোগ করলে এটি অনায়াসে দুজনের মধ্যাহ্ন আহারে পরিনত হতে পারে। একটি পরিপূর্ণ মধ্যাহ্ন ভোজ যারে কয়।

ভাত,

তবে বছরের অন্যান্য সময়ের চেয়ে পুজোর সময় এখানে খাবারের দাম অনেকটাই বৃদ্ধি পায়। আর তাই পুজোই এই চত্তরের বাকি রেস্তোরাঁ গুলির মত এখানে লম্বা ওয়েটিং লাইনে দাড়াতে হয় না।

পুজোই সম্পূর্ণ বাঙালি খাবার খেতে এখানে আসতে পারেন ।আপনি নিরাশ হবেন না।

The decor is beautiful, ethereal with a tinge of Bangaliyana !! The food was good however they specializes in fish items as the same rocked my palate.
Bhetkir paturi was amazing. We ordered the special thali with mutton as well as fish, especially if it's Ilish then it's heaven on the plate.
Though the place is quite easily accessible, the tables are a little inaccessible when it comes yo lunch time during weekends. The prices are a little hiked thus making it not such a pocket friendly place.

Hello.
Located on 1st floor of purna das road, it seemed we had moved into the sets of saptapadi with the Mahanayak and Mahanayika. 
We ordered 2fish thalis and some a la carte dishes.
We had:
Rice
Shona mug dal/cholar dal
Shukto
Alu bhaja
Fish fry
Bhetki paturi
Rui maccher kalia
Chingri mach
Achari murgi
Chatni papad
Mishti doi.
It was a sumptous meal and all the dishes were very upto the mark.
Alongside the ambience, it really was a great experience.

Excellent in all terms. Service, food, space, decor, price - all great. Very exciting fusion food as well. I have been here twice and would surely come back and suggest others to visit the place.

One suggestion for the waiters - when you advise items from the menu, don't always suggest the costliest items of all. It sounds like push sales. If you suggest tasty items from the menu, which are not the most expensive, I feel that you will be appreciated and remembered much more.

Authentic Bengali home cooked food doesn't get better than this. Discovered this gem of a place during my recent stopover in Kolkata and can't wait to go back already. It's a small but cosy restaurant situated in a residential building in Hindustan Park. The food is delicious - both veg and non veg dishes are exceptional. If it's your first time here try their special seafood thaali so you get to sample a bit of everything. The desserts are unusual and sublime. Hope they keep up the good job!

Saptapadi Jadavpur Branch is walking distance from my place . The hindusthan park Outlet is a spacious one and decore wise better. On entry you see a huge poster like picture of Saptapadi Movie's Signature Scene "Ey poth Jodi na Shesh hoy" and you immedietely cannot help praising the person who ever thought of the tagline "Ey pod jodi na Shesh hoy" . 
Decor is not really luxurious but simplicity amulgamated with fancy perfection . 
Then you treat your taste bud with authentic bengali cuisine . Their Pujo Menu Differs from Normal Actually . There used to be a signature dish Abhinaba Chicken , and Katla Sagorika . I simple love the naming pattern they maintained . Thoughit goes through changes pretty often .Taste wise you can relate dishes from both outlets .But quantity differs . 
Over all this is a lovely aithentic bangali restaurant with essence of theme.

I and my husband were really satisfied with the food and the fusion too.We took fish fry covered with puffed rice and it can give a tough competition to kfc with so well marinated fish.The main course included misti pulao and karai keema.The waiter really seemed careful in asking whether we want it to be highly spiced or to be mildly spiced as we actually wanted it to be mild.The pulao was just perfect in sweetness .Now the dessert we took was ice cream patisapta and I would appreciate the thin wrap and the sweet sauce it came with.Everything was just perfect but I would suggest a little thing that is the option for desserts can be increased like nolen gurer ice cream sprinkled with choco chips, nuts and chocolate sauce. Or the organization can introduce flavoured dahis and mistis may be like makha sandesh with some fusion.Hoping to visit soon.

Decorated with ' uttam suchitra ' film Saptapadi.  This is a newly opened Bengali food joint that serves some innovative yet. Overall this place is very much worth the visit and I will soon be returning back for the fusion items.

I would have given this place a rating of 1 but since I like the decor hence gave it 1.5. I visited the place this afternoon for a quiet lunch after reading a lot of good reviews on Zomato and elsewhere but what I witnessed was far from beyond my imagination. To start with when you visit a restaurant for lunch you would expect the ambience to be civilized and not liken this to a roadside dhaba with a lot of chaos. These guys opened a part of the restaurant for some TV shoot during lunch hours and there was a major chaos of extra flashed lights, heroines doing their usual dramas and scene by scene interpretation, takes and remakes with half of the staff interested in the shoot. This is extremely unprofessional and would have appreciated had the restaurant been closed for shoot to avoid such mishaps or the utter chaos generated could have been shot during non operational hours in the absence of the guests. So far as food is concerned, I ordered for some fancy welcome drink with tea which came out very sweet and nothing fancy as such. I chose to come out of the restaurant and visit a nearby place to have my bengali lunch peacefully. Yes I would not recommend this place to anyone from my experience and would appreciate if the management of the property display some professionalism to avoid inconvenience to guests in future.

The restaurant has a nice decor with Uttam- Suchitra films as their theme... As starters we had chingri sobar opore which was definitely good.. The pulao was so-so whereas the gandhoraj mangsho was good initially but after having some of it, the taste appeared too monotonous because of the concentration of the sour taste... The price was not worth the food...

I was taken here by my date one fine afternoon. I can't seem to recall the occasion, but we had decided to go for Bengali cuisine.
The place is well decorated with artifacts and photographs of Bengali actors and artists. The cutlery is quite impressive and cute. The staff is efficient.
We ordered the Kesar Badam Shorbot , and it was a big disappointment. Tasted horrible, and the chunks of Baadam (and hardly any Pishta) kept choking us and the straw. Bad choice!

Next, we ordered Murgi-Chingri Lollypop for starters. Though it was hard to detect the taste of prawn, the starter was good. 
We then ordered-
Luchi and Achari Gondhoraj Murgi : Yummy yum yum!!!! I liked this dish. Chicken curry never disappoints me.
Baked Dab Chingri Alaska- Daab chingri with an outer layer of Baked Alaska. I didn't like this one bit. But then, that might have been my undeveloped taste buds.
Gondhoraj Caramel Custard- Not bad. nothing special.
Icecream Patishapta - Average. Nothing special. Could've done without it

The striking thing about this restaurant is the decor is awesome.. The name Saptapadi is justified by its decor itself.

Coming to the food

The Pulao was commendable.. 

Chingri Sobar Opore was the dish of the day... It was the best thing we had there..

The Gandoraj Chicken was not the best chicken we had.. It was on the "smells great, tastes OK" side of the platter..

Saptapadi overall was a good experience... Hope itbwould be a better experience when i visit again, which I definitely would

We ordered - traditional pulao, gondhoraaj achaari murgi and vetki paturi. these three were complementing each other ❤
Dishes were enough quantitatively and pocket daily also quite.

I am very very disappointed after today's lunch at Saptapadi, Purna Das Road branch. Based on zomato review, we decided to hv lunch there. We were 13 in nos. Quality of Hilsa fish was absolutely worst.. though they hv charged 300 per plate for single piece fish... mutton curry was shocking... pls think before going there... only plus point is ambience... but after having such degraded quality of food that too overpriced, you will never feel to appreciate about their good part. Our first and last visit to the restaurant.

Being a huge fan of Uttam Suchitra I liked the simply decorated restaurant with framed photographs of my favourite hero & heroine of the 60s. The ambience was good with all the Bengali film songs of the by gone era playing in the back ground. You can flip through the pages of the autobiography of Suchitra Sen as you wait for the food to arrive. The bike scene with a real head of a bike kept there is sure to fascinate you.

All the utensils from dishes, bowls to the water jugs were made of mellanin. Now comes the important part which is the food. This place has a capacity of around 25-28 people at a time. 

Me and my foodie friends of Team Panch Phoron were invited to taste their new menu. the food tasting session begin with, 

•	1. Lichu Lanka Sorbot –

•	Moori fish stick –

•	Murgi Chingri lollypop –

•	Murgi Bhora mousse with tomato – 

•	Jal muri crushed Kolkata Bhetki with sour cream –

•	Ice cream Patisapta –

Overall it was a superb experience for me. Thanks to ‘saptapadi’ for inviting TeamPanchphoron.

Bengali food at its best!! The décor and name  is themed of the famous Bengali film. The front portion of a bike with Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen's photo in the background, caught my eye the most. 

Coming to the food - Ordered Lacha aamer shorbot, fresh lime soda and chicken prawn lollipop as starters. Must say it tasted as nothing I have tasted before. Very good! Also ordered special non veg thali and special fish thali. All the preparations were finger lickingly delicious, specially the pabda jhal - a must try. The vetki paturi was also soft nd very tasty. They also added ghee to dal, shukto, malaikari to revamp d taste. 

The service was also spot on. The servers were very courteous and attended to our needs immediately. 

All in all a great lunch and will definitely recommend Saptapadi to all. :)

Saptapadi the name itself has an emotional connect with each and every Bengali. There was a retro bengali movie of this name.
From the name you can understand that it's a bengali cuisine restaurant. But they serve bengali food with a twist and try to give a fusion touch to each and every food.

Me and my foodie friends of Team Panch Phoron were invited to taste their new menu.

I loved the food. They served us one welcome drink called LICHU LONKA...OMG that was something that will give you jhatka after you take the first sip but you can't leave the glass before it becomes empty. It's as yummy as any of you favorite chillers.

Then we tasted some scrumptious food that made me saying Food is Love and I love Food...and I am a Panch Phoron forever.
                    

But yes, I'll suggest Ice cream patishapta is a must have.

Not impressed. Had better expectation with the food, did not satisfy our taste buds. Waiter was too pushy to try the fusion food, ordered poshto chicken cutlet, however it was awful, when complained the restaurant tried  again on the same item, however got wrong as it was salty this time. Tried Hilsa and other items, nothing special to mention ordinary food. Quantity was little lesser side. Even mishti doi was very mediocre. An OK OK place

Looking for authentic bengali food to blow away your mind? Saptapadi is your go to place.

Delectable food, warm service and an ambiance that takes you to another time make Saptapadi a must visit stop in Calcutta.

On my recent visit, I tried the special fish thali, charchori and hilsha in mustard sauce. Each and every dish was an absolute pleasure to the senses.

The thali with hilsha bhapa, prawns malai curry, bhetki pathuri, shukto, beguni, jhurjhure aloo bhaja, rice, luchhi, salad, chutney, papad and dessert is a delightful and wholesome meal which I highly recommend. All the dishes are delicious and authentic. This thali is Bengal on a plate!

Charchori with baingan, aloo and tiny moral fish is a rustic dish which Saptapadi has perfected. It is a must try at the restaurant.

The queen of fish, hilsha or as it is lovingly called, illish maach by locals is a delicacy. In the intense mustard sauce prepared at Saptapadi, the queen shines and pleasures you in each bite.

Service is very warm with sweet and knowledgeable servers who know their food well and give you suggestions to suit your taste buds.

The ambiance which is a direct inspiration from the movie Saptapadi is sweet and transports you into a time bygone. It is perfect for a date or a family meal.

Price wise the restaurant is reasonable keeping in mind the entire experience. The above meal cost INR 1600.

Do I recommend? Lovingly yes!

Yesterday we went Saptapadi for dinner. It was my first visit for this outlet.It was a perfect destiny to celebrate my parents 25th anniversary. Ambience was also perfect that I wanted. Staffs were very polite and they arranged everything to make the occasion successful. A special thanks to team Saptapadi. Yesterday we took kancha aam er sorbot, chicken chingri lollypop, misti pulao, chitol maach er muitha, mutton, chatni and papad. I loved their chitol maach er muitha. Surely I will visit again.

Situated at Hindustan Park. This eatery is sublimely Bengali in it's flavour. The interior is reminiscent of the famous pair of our own 'Mahanayak' and 'Greta Garbo' of Bengali cinema Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen. The food tastes awesome, Luchi Cholar Dal and Bhetki Paturi as an evening snack was awesome meal to have on a Sunday trail. Service was more than Average. Recommended for every bengali foodie as well as the ones who love to live life in Sepia mode.

Looking for authentic bengali food to blow away your mind? Saptapadi is your go to place.

Delectable food, warm service and an ambiance that takes you to another time make Saptapadi a must visit stop in Calcutta.

On my recent visit, I tried the special fish thali, charchori and hilsha in mustard sauce. Each and every dish was an absolute pleasure to the senses.

The thali with hilsha bhapa, prawns malai curry, bhetki pathuri, shukto, beguni, jhurjhure aloo bhaja, rice, luchhi, salad, chutney, papad and dessert is a delightful and wholesome meal which I highly recommend. All the dishes are delicious and authentic. This thali is Bengal on a plate!

Charchori with baingan, aloo and tiny moral fish is a rustic dish which Saptapadi has perfected. It is a must try at the restaurant.

The queen of fish, hilsha or as it is lovingly called, illish maach by locals is a delicacy. In the intense mustard sauce prepared at Saptapadi, the queen shines and pleasures you in each bite.

When there are Old Bengali songs playing in the background which takes you back to the days of 60s and 70s but the food is an awesome reminder of the modern fusion then you must be in the legendary ‘Spatapadi’ restaurant. This is a newly opened Bengali food joint that serves some innovative yet delicious food which will definitely tease your taste buds and mesmerize you for sure. This is a themed restaurant named after a very famous old Bengali Movie ‘Saptapadi’ starring The Legendary Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen so you will find lots of Black&white posters from that movie hanging around the walls of this restaurant.

So I wanted to treat a friend of mine to Bengali food and was looking for a place where I could find a classy and serene ambience with quality food. Suddenly I came across this place and went there today. I am not much of a Bengali cuisine fan but this place actually made me fall in love with Bengali food after having potol-er-dorma, Saptapadi Abhinava Chicken and kaacha- aam -porar sorbot. A soft music was being played at the background that added a classic touch to the restaurant. The staff was very good and amiable. So I would definitely suggest people to visit here and would rate the place 5 stars based on my overall experience.

We ordered 2 special fish thali and 1 fish thali. The wait time of 35minutes was considerably higher. The preperations was average. The mineral water bottles were  charged twice of the MRP which is illegal. The manager continuosly argued that they have the right to charge more than the MRP as it is a trend in every other restaurant. They definitely need a better well-informed mangement!

We had posto piyaji,beguni,moori fish stick,murgi-chingrir lollypop,veg thali,chicken-mutton thali,veg thali.The food was good and the moori fish stick and lollypop were really innovative. The thalis had dal,veg,bhaja,rice/pulao,luchi,chutney,papad,sweets,etc.The luchis were not great though.
To sum it up- Affordable and nice Bengali food.

Went today for a family lunch. The ambience is very classy. They took our orders and the food arrived after 20 minutes. They take time because they prepare everything very fresh.  We ordered for 2 Fish thalis and 2 chicken mutton thalis. Well food was damn very tasty. Honestly speaking after a long time I had this good bengali food. Right from Papda maach to Mutton to Chingri, everything was perfect. But what is disappointing, is their quantity.  Their quantity is very very less. Also last time when we went we were served mishti doi for dessert, but today they just served a piece of Roshogolla ( that also the taste was very bad), which I didn't like. On complaining they told if we would have complained, we would have been served mishti doi. But at least they could ask about our preference.  Anyways they compensated by not charging extra for a plate of extra luchi. Will get back soon for the tasty food though. This restaurant needs to improve on their quantity.

This place knows how to strike a chord with a pure Bengalis' sentiment.Naming it after a blockbuster movie of all time....and the theme of Uttam-Suchitra....the ultimate and truly evergreen pair onscreen....Saptapadi has done enough to become a crowd puller.....To be honest....the ambience was what made us visit it....and the food was good too.....specially the Daab-Chingri.....The staff was really courteous......All saying.....definitely a must-go......

Located at Purna das road, this restaurant is sure to attract a Bengali foodie. For all Uttam-Suchitra fans this place is a must visit. As u enter you will be greeted with songs from their films & you will find the place adorned with snaps from their movies. You can flip through the pages of the autobiography of Suchitra Sen as you wait for the food to arrive. The bike scene with a real head of a bike kept there is sure to fascinate u.
I had gone with my family & the waiter suggested we should try the non-veg thali. since my uncle doesn't have chicken/mutton he took special fish thali. Non-veg thali had pulao/plain rice, luchi, dal, aloo bhaja, beguni, a fish of your choice ( I took prawn), chicken and a mutton preparation. The special fish thali had plain rice/pulao, sukto, luchi, dal, aloo bhaja, 3 preparations of fish namely chingrir malai kari, ilish bhapa & bhetkir paturi. At the end we were served with chatni & Misti doi. You will be served with extra rice if you want.

Moreover, the staff were quite cordial. They kept asking if the food was OK and was prompt. The prices are reasonable as well.
So, next weekend do book your seats at Saptapadi. I'm sure you will like it.

It's a theme based bengali restaurant . Nicely decorated with ' uttam suchitra ' film Saptapadi. 
Food : Average. Nothing special there.  We have tried so many bengali dishes there but it's not impressive .
Decor : As I told about the theme . I am giving good rating for the decor only. 
Last point I have to mention about the staffs . They are not so much professional.  It's OK about the service but something I missed there . 
Price : almost 450 per head . Tried 2 types of starter mutton , fish , rice .

The restaurant is situated on the Purna Das road in Hindustan Park area. We went to the restaurant for lunch. We had pre booked our seats and i would suggest that you do the same if you are 5 or more. The interiors captured the iconic moments of the film Saptapadi with posters and framed photographs of the mahanayak Uttam Kumar and the legendary actress Suchitra Sen. All the utensils from dishes, bowls to the water jugs were made of mellanin. Now comes the important part which is the food. We had ordered bhapa murgir paturi for starters. This item was probably the best of the lot. It was very delicious. For the main course we went for plain rice, narkol ar karaishutir dal, jhuri alu vaja, posto piyaji, potoler dolma, dab chingri, kasha mangsho, chatni ar papor. Everything were quite good in taste. The only problem was the potoler dolma which we felt was a bit undercooked. Dab chingri was again very good. For all prawn lovers i will suggest dab chingri. Kasha mangsho was quite good as well. The mutton was nicely cooked and was soft to eat. Overall it was a nice experience. I hope the saptapadi team sees this review. All the best to the team and hope to visit again. Cheers.

A small restaurant on Purna Das Road attracted my attention because of it's name. Being a huge fan of Uttam Suchitra I liked the simply decorated restaurant with framed photographs of my favourite hero & heroine of the 60s. The ambience was good with all the Bengali film songs of the by gone era playing in the back ground.
The restaurant serves the traditional Bengali cuisine & also Bengali fusion food.

Started off with litchi chilli drink which tasted good & refreshing. For starters had Posto Bata chicken coin & Muri fish stick. Both were delicious. The main course was Mouri pata flavoured prawn Thermidor, which came with herb rice & caramelised onion. Kancha Lanka Narkel Pesto Murgi came with wafer thin parathas. Then there was baked Kolkata Bhetki. Last but not the least was Mishti pulao with Karai Keema Mangsho.

The food tasted good except for the fact that the rice was a little too dry & there was no gravy to have it with. A small request that the management should change the dinner plates. As it's rough surface makes an embarrassingly scraping noise.

The dessert Ice cream patishapta was pretty tasteless. 

The staff were courteous & their service is good.

I had heard a lot about this restaurant, so I planned a  lunch here with my full family. But it just wasted my day. Sorshe ilish and bati chingri both were disheartening!!! The karai kima mangsho was a little better. Even the special fish thali was poor in both  quality and quantity. Altogether I would not suggest anyone to waste his/her money in this restaurant.

Vetki paturi. 
Achaari gondhoraaj mangsho. 
Posto kancha lonka mangsho. 


The last two ones were really mouth watering. 😍 i never forget. Its too tasty. Vetki paturi was not so good. Needed a lot of improvization. 



Over all its great. I should not talk about its ambience. Its more than i expected as i love uttam suchitra couple. :*  

If youwant authentic bengali food . You must try there. ! 

Staffs are good. !

Situated at a walking distance from Golpark,this is a place serving Bengali fusion food as well as authentic Bengali food.Bengali fusion food is rare in Kolkata,so this place is worth giving a try.The dining space is in the second floor,the place is small but the themed ambience with old bengali songs playing in the background absolutely creates the mood.As the name suggests,it is decorated all over with photos of Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen.

Coming to the service,the waiters are very courteous,and the service is extremely quick.We went there at lunchtime and we recieved our order almost in 10 to 15 minutes.

We ordered Aam pora Sharbat, Veg thali,steamed  rice,alu bhaja,mutton achari gondhoraj and basanti pulao.
In Veg thali they have two vegetables with dal,sukto,bhaja luchi and rice with other sweet condiments.The taste of each item is absolutely delicious with a subtle flavour of ghee in all the vegetables.Special mention,the dal was stunning.
The mutton was a spicy and sour dish due to the addition of achar pieces but unfortunately due to the strong achar flavour almost no gandharaj flavour was present.But the pieces were absolutely melt in mouth, they were so well cooked.
The Aam pora Sharbat however disappointed me a bit,it tasted a bit like store bought aam panna and not the typical bengali aam pora sharbat.

Coming to the price,the price in the menu card looks quite cheap,but on the other hand the quantity is very less,so make sure you order more quantity of mains.
Overall this place is very much worth the visit and I will soon be returning back for the fusion items.

Located conveniently in Hindustan Park, a couple of minutes worth of walking from Golpark, Saptapadi is a beautifully decorated family restaurant that serves both contemporary as well as fusion Bengali food.

 As the name suggests, the place celebrates the evergreen pair of Uttam-Suchitra and the monochrome setting, an all hits playlist from an era gone by along with the stormy weather outside provided for an almost cinema-esque backdrop to our lazy romantic Monday lunch.

 A word for the staff : they are wonderful. Some of the most helpful and friendly people one can imagine. First up we ordered a couple of kacha aam er shorbot (raw mango sherbet). Our attendant suggested one lichu lonkar shorbot (litchi-chili sherbet) which was not on the menu. Both the drinks were competently refreshing, but the litchi-chili drink was definitely the standout. I could have never guessed in a thousand years that litchi and chili go so well together but admittedly they do.

  Chicken prawn lollipops were our choice for appetizers. Three pieces of succulent, crispy chicken legs filled with prawn ragout and just the slightest hint of mustard were served to us steaming hot. It was a great dish however if I am nitpicking then the plating left a lot to be desired.
                    
A couple of great fusion dishes for the mains followed. Jhal Muri baked betki with sour cream and tomato kasundi salsa is not nearly as zany as it sounds but really tasty nonetheless. Served with an aromatic bowl of gondhoraj lime infused rice and caramelized onion, all the sauces and the crispy betki come together to produce a surprisingly deconstructionist homely helping of the very Bengali maach bhaat.
Not to be outdone the kacha lanka narkel pesto mangsho (mutton cooked in green chili, pesto and coconut gravy) served with parathas, an extra helping of pesto and even more caramelized onions ended our lunch on a high. The mutton pieces were soft and well cooked and coated with a generous amount of pesto and coconut gravy. The flaky pieces of paratha rightly complemented the preparation.

By this point our limited gastronomical capabilities had already reached a limit and we decided to skip dessert, even though the jasmine tea flavored mishti doi had caught my eye. Not like I needed more reasons to come back but the more, the merrier.

Overhyped. Nowadays it seems you can serve anything nicely by making it look good and making your restaurant a theme restaurant. Instead of focusing on your decor, cutlery and playing music of uttam suchitra movies please focus on the quality and QUANTITY of the food here. All the dishes have a tinge of sweetness and the Kochi patha r jhol tastes bland! The quantity of rice is not sufficient for one person and the Crispy morola maach er whatever is a epic fail! The Gondhoraaj lebu ar cha er sharbat is also overhyped and they dont even serve it chilled like it's shown in the menu card. Overall a very sad lunch. Never coming back here again!

Situated at a walking distance from Golpark,this is a place serving Bengali fusion food as well as authentic Bengali food.Bengali fusion food is rare in Kolkata,so this place is worth giving a try.The dining space is in the second floor,the place is small but the themed ambience with old bengali songs playing in the background absolutely creates the mood.As the name suggests,it is decorated all over with photos of Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen.

Coming to the service,the waiters are very courteous,and the service is extremely quick.We went there at lunchtime and we recieved our order almost in 10 to 15 minutes.

We ordered Aam pora Sharbat, Veg thali,steamed  rice,alu bhaja,mutton achari gondhoraj and basanti pulao.
In Veg thali they have two vegetables with dal,sukto,bhaja luchi and rice with other sweet condiments.The taste of each item is absolutely delicious with a subtle flavour of ghee in all the vegetables.Special mention,the dal was stunning.
The mutton was a spicy and sour dish due to the addition of achar pieces but unfortunately due to the strong achar flavour almost no gandharaj flavour was present.But the pieces were absolutely melt in mouth, they were so well cooked.
The Aam pora Sharbat however disappointed me a bit,it tasted a bit like store bought aam panna and not the typical bengali aam pora sharbat.

Coming to the price,the price in the menu card looks quite cheap,but on the other hand the quantity is very less,so make sure you order more quantity of mains.
Overall this place is very much worth the visit and I will soon be returning back for the fusion items.

This is my fourth time visit here..... I love their foods, ambience. They have wonderful service. Also, there are very few restaurants where you get friendly approach from the service boys. And I would love to give them an extra 🌟 for the theme of the restaurant. As I'm a diehard fan of Uttam Kumar....

If you visit Saptapadi, try there Vetki-Chingri-Posto coin which is a combination of three favourite food items of Uttam Kumar. I'm loving it...🤘🤘

We had an overall good experience here. I loved the ambiance. Perfect place to take your parents. Service was prompt. Coming to the most important thing- the  food. The kancha Lanka chicken was too good. So was the daab chingri. However, the chittol muitha could have been better. Would love to visit here again.

If you are near Kalighat and are craving for authentic Bengali food, you have to visit Saptapadi.! Inspired by the famous blockbuster 'Saptapadi' this restaurant plays some retro bengali hits to add to the nostalgia feel of the place. Have the Beta fish authentic Bengali. The hilsa fish is a must try too. 
Overall: 4.5/5 👌🏼 A must try!

Daab chingri was average and expensive. Really liked the pulao , mutton and fish dishes. I was here during Durga Puja so maybe that is the reason the food was average. I wouldn't totally judge them based on their performance in rush hours. I don't live in kolkata at the moment or else I would definitely visit Saptapadi again. It's a compact restaurant with good interiors

Hard a lot about Saptapadi from my friends,social media...So me and one of my friend decided to taste the bangali ranna.The ambiance was just fatafati and regarding their hospitality kono kotha hobena dada.But there is a but.being a Bengali better to say a bangal it's very much pathetic for me to eat those dishes investing so much money. their so called kacha Amer sorbot is nothing but aam panna what we will get in the market investing 5-10rs rather 45rs for a glass.And regarding other main course those are good but nothing special.

Location - Easily accessible on Purna Das Road. On the first floor and they have a lift as well, so it's a good one for elderly people. 5 on 5.

Ambience - Decent enough but very much claustrophobic. And therefore, with more crowds, the place becomes a pain to bear.  Also, they have bottles of bisleri filled up with aam porar sherbet to be served as a side-drink on order and that doesn't give a very good view and so that is ridiculous. Lastly, it's a pain to eat traditional food with your hand and then have no finger-bowl service and hence walk down to the wash-basin amidst a horde of people waiting in the restaurant premises, to be seated. 1 on 5.

Value for Money - They have a combination of fusion and traditional Bong food. We had taken numerous items. Decent value for money. Avinabo Murgi/Mangsho is a must try - the taste is new in town. Chitol Muittha is something you should also go for given the unique taste as compared to other restaurants. Potoler dolma was bland and can be improved upon. The aamer chutney was also bland and can be much worked upon. 4 on 5.

Service - Courteous and prompt service. On noticing that the claustrophobic place and seating arrangement was bothering us, the manager/owner herself came down and re-styled the seating arrangement for some comfort. Also, the bhetki paturi took some time and the other manager/owner himself took hands to serve us and let us know that they do not serve stale food and hence the time taken to prepare afresh. That was a very good gesture. 5 on 5.

Overall, a one-timer, but can be improved and stiff competition can be given to other brands in town.

Just had dinner there and the whole episode is fresh in my mind, we ordered two fish thalis,the dark complexioned waiter seemed to be too impatient to note down the order even before we could decide on which fish we wanted to order, had to wait for a while, finally the thali arrived, one had rice the other had polao..luchis were too soft fine but the rice plate had no accompaniment with luchis,watery dal and jhuri Aloo bhaja doesn't go with luchis, katla kasha was good, bhetki paturi ordinary, pabda jhal was tasty..the overall quantity of the thali was less..when I asked for the polao to be repeated the waiter had the audacity to tell me that I would be given only rice if I want more..ambiance had the saptapadi theme, the eternal pair uttam suchitra smiling at me from all directions.. Gondhoraj caramel custard was okayish..overall experience was unsatisfactory

Located in purna das road,this place serves excellent bengali food. Kacha lanka chicken and posto bora was my favourite. All the other items (cant name so many)were equally good. I didnt like the daab chingri very much though. Waiters were very well behaved and helpful. Only drawback was lack of manpower so service was a little sluggish. But i would definitely recommend this place for bengali cuisine.

Recently been to many bengali cuisine restaurants in kolkata and none actually appealed my taste buds to write a review, hence did not expect much when we had made an unplanned visit to saptapadi one late afternoon and within days i had to visit again and yes, i am compelled to write a review. 
This restaurant is excellent and not only at par with some of those fine dine restaurants boasting bengali cuisine in the city, rather the quality of food is even better than those and also the branches they boast in NCR and mumbai.

Must try: poshto bora, mochar ghonto, kachalonka murgi, avinabo mangsho, definitely bhapa ilish and aam porar shorbot.
Ambience: cozy, sweet and small, thus ensuring the warmth of service. 

Value for money: 5/5 (if not looking for exorbitant prices with average quality of food.)

A must visit...

@ Mr. Ranjan Biswas.... wish you could open this in delhi NCR and give other competitors a run for money..!! Excellent... its tough to maintain a consistent quality which most of your competitors fail... hope it would not be the same with you.. all the best...

It was an unplanned visit. I had to undergo certain medical investigations in an empty stomach in a local diagnostics centre and after the same were over, I zeroed on this one as it is nearby.
The time we reached there, the restaurant was yet to be opened, but the staff asked us in, so as to prevent us from trying somewhere else. We comfortably sat at a corner facing window. The staff put on the ac and adjusted the khus khus curtain in order to make us comfortable. Melodious songs from Bengali films started playing. 

The interior is beautifully decorated with photos of Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen adorning the walls and even the backs of the chairs. The bookcase contained a well-thumbed book on Suchitra Sen. Especially I liked the main wall decore - the famous scene of Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen singing the famous song from Saptapadi, made alive by attaching a real motorcycle head on the wall. Innovative.

Soon the menu cards arrived - two in number - one containing traditional Bengali food item while another containing fusion food items. As I was going through the fusion food menu, a staff came and rudely snatched the menucard from my hand and said," this is fusion menu card." I was shocked. It was so unexpected. He tried to clear his stand stating that he tried to tell me that it was fusion menu card, and that he was not snatching it from me. Needs a bit of training, that one.
Another staff was more cordial but unsmiling. He tried smiling when his superiors came in, by that  time we were almost finished.

Anyway, back to where I was. The victuals were tastefully earthern and/or earthern hued. The sink is an aluminium cauldron, which again is an innovation.
As we came too early, we could not avail of any fusion food apart from the starters. I chose chicken and prawn drumsticks from that list.
From Bengali food list, I chose rice, moong dal, posto bora, shukto and Saptapadi special chicken curry.

Food arrived in time.

The chicken and prawn drumstick was very tasty. The rice was warm and of good quality. The posto bora had cocoanut in it and tasted great. The dal is okay. I loved the chicken curry. However, we did not like shukto much. It was full of potatoes and had very little bitter gourd. Without bitter gourd, the mere essence of shukto was missing.

We were almost finished when the managerial staff came. They were very cordial and kept on requesting us to come again, which can be done sometime soon.

Had Rice, Narkel Koraisutki Dal,Mocha Narkel Bora,Jhuri alu bhaja, Bati Chingri, Achar gondhoraj Mangsho & Illish Jumbo as main course menu, and for starters Moori fish Stick and crispy Mourola with Lichu loonka sharbat and finally Kachha aam sharbat.. Overall the ambience was good.. But was dissappointed with the quality of fish.  The ideas and final preparations are good but the quality of fish can be improved.. Moccha Narkel Bora can be avoided. The Mangsho and preparation of Bati Chingri was good... They have a fusion menu which I would like to try on my next visit..  Lets see how is that?? But in comparison to other bengali resturant they r the same and have to improve the quality of the fish to gain more popularity..

Good place to be with your family if you want to enjoy traditional Bengali delicacies. 
We used to go to the other outlet at Jadavpur and decided to try this one out as well. Staff was courteous and they'll give good suggestions according to your choice. All time favorites like daab chingri,  chitol muitha or their in house dishes like skewered prawn n chicken or the Crispy moori coated fish is just great. Would be great if they can serve parathas too. 
I like the daab chingri more at the jadavpur outlet coz the prawns were not that tender here. Overall it was good. 
BTW, aam pora n lichu Lanka sarbats r must try here 🙂

The interior n the decor makes you feel nostalgic for its famous tollywood on screen couple uttam kumar n suchitra sen .. its wonderful experience fr me to be there with my family...

I came to know about this restaurant from Zomata and visited this place on Sunday (14th May) along with my family for lunch. The ambience, the decor and the traditional crockeries used is very nice. We have ordered several items including veg and non-veg. Items ordered as starter- Lichu Lonkar Sarbat, Aam Panna Sarbat, Beguni and Sonali Bhetki. We liked all of them except Beguni which was bit oily.
In main course we had ordered Luchi, Cholar Dal, Alur Dum, Plain Rice, Misti Pulao, Lonka Murgi, Kochi Pathar Jhol and Bhapa Elish. Almost all the items taste superb but I want to mention few things. Firstly the Pulao was too sweet, the amount of meat was less in both the Chicken and Mutton preparations, it was mainly bony otherwise the taste was good. I realized afterwards that I could have ordered boneless chicken instead of with bone.:( Coming to desert we had Misti Doi and Patisapta Ice cream, both were good. Overall my experience was very good and the waiters are courteous. I would love to visit again and it's highly recommended!:-)

Saptapadi is definitely one of the best bengali cuisine restaurant in town. Not only they prepare authentic bengali dishes but also fusion dishes which are totally scrumptious! 
It's a small cozy restaurant which offers you a great dining experience. My family totally loved it. I would only suggest one thing that please make the food serving a bit fast! 
Anyways, I would love to tell that my Saptapadi experience was really good and would suggest everyone to dine at this place.

We started with Lichoo  Lanka Sarbat followed by main course consisting of Plain Rice, Chiral Peti, Panchforon Bati Chingree and Achari Gandharaj Mutton. At the end Ice cream Patisapta. All are very good. I recommend a must visit restaurant.

Both were very nice to taste. Main course we tried daab Chingari Alaska..awesome n innovative preparation. Den we ordered for rice sukto n Kochi pathar jhol. Sukto was ok...I felt dat Kochi pathar jhol should be little more spicy. Overall quite a good place for trying Bengali cuisine in Kolkata.

There are very few Bengali fusion restaurants in Kolkata. Saptapodi is one among them and an excellent one at that. I have had their fusion Lobster Thermidor and found it first rate. Among vegetable dishes I particularly liked the phulkopi fritters. It was nicely crispy and exactly warm. Their service is excellent and I loved the ambience of the 50s Bengali culture. Overall, I highly recommend Saptapodi to anyone with a little adventurous culinary taste.

I am usually lazy to review an eating joint. However, this one is required. Nothing can turn you off more than the sheer audacity of a  misguided sense of egostistical pride in churning out culinary dissapointments and sell them to a food loving community. My first ever takeaway from Saptapadi echoes all that has gone wrong with the cities 90% bong eateries. 
After careful consideration and a faint glimmer of a decent dinner, I took a few pretty basics from their regular menu. 
The 'Mishti' Pulao is anything but sweet and lacked the fresh aroma of the bengali Pulao. The grains weren't Gobindo Bhog but certainly a low grade basmati. 
Soggy on the inside and dry & microwaved exteriors made the 'Narkel Mochar bora' quite a stale mate. 
For the first time in my life I saw a Chingri'r Bati Chorchori that had a red gravy with relatively big Golda chingris. Let alone the aroma of the mustard oil and small shrimps steamed with thinly slices potatoes....this one was anything between some sort of a rich tasteless Kosha of sorts. I do not upload pictures but couldn't help myself with this one. You gotta see this one to believe it. 
Next on line- Potoler Dorma- stuffed with chana- the stuffing was red with onions and relatively hot. The thick gravy was a tasteless butter masala of sorts. 
Then came an all time favourite. A katla machher kalia. This one rarely goes wrong even with the most underrated caterers in unknown small towns of the suburban bengal. For the first time I tasted a Kalia with rich red oily gravy with absolutely nothing that tastes like a machher kalia. It was more on the lines of a below average Kosha Mangsho. 
While I usually don't mind oily food, Saptapadi takes Bangla teler ranna to a different height. Lastly the aamer chutney that my mother mistook to be pineapple chutney by the look was decent. 
I am not writing this review to malign your establishment. I seriously feel that the management needs to look at things and take notice. Your staff was very courteous and helpful. So I would think that the problem lies exclusively  in the kitchen. It all boils down to your taste and quality. While this isn't really a season for full capcities in restaurants, but the reason behind your empty seats might be something else which you need to figure out. Purna Das Road is bustling with eateries and you need to really up your game if you don't want to end up like 'Byanjon'- the bong joint which was at the exact same place for a brief period of time before you guys changed it to Saptapadi.

The Uttam Kumar Suchitra Sen themed restaurant is situated at Purna Das Road,  just a minute drive from Golpark. It lies beside two other Bengali eateries namely Jhale Jhole Ombole & Tero Parbon. 
First of all they did not have the menu as given in Zomato. The continental-bengali fusion dishes were missing. 
We ordered a large plethora of items, the chingri starter was good, so was the muri fried fish. However the Kacha Aam sarbat and lichu lonka sorbot were ordinary. The main couese was also good,  but i would recommend  to go for their fish delicacies rather than their chicken or mutton ones. 
The ice cream pathisapta was average. 
Service was prompt.

Saptapadi is one of those cosy quaint homely restaurant which offers you with great taste of bengal. The ambiance , the decor give the earthy feel. This is my second visit with my husband and their delicacies make sure that we mark it top in our bengali restaurant list. This time we went on a weekday after office and it was quite full. We ordered fusion fish finger, the batter was mixed with puffed rice. The stuffing was succulent yet well spiced. For main course we chose plain rice, bhaja moong dal and posto piyaji, kacha lonka mutton and daab chingri. Kacha lonka mutton is a wonder in itself and if you want it more spicy you can add it up. Daab chingri was also a class apart. In our first visit we tried more of their fusion items and they all were mind blowing. Their warm service is their trade mark. Though I can not find any lacking points but will like to suggest that they need to customise their desserts a bit with more options for bengali traditional sweets with a twist.

But not too bad as well. Definitely Give it a try. If u want family time or sometimes with friends with bangaliana. Then go for it.

Ordered for kacha amer sorbot and jol jeera. Both were good. Then in main course I ordered for misti polao that was good. Then I ordered for pabda sorse and doi katla. Pabda sorse was bit salty and the piece was not good enough according to price and doi katla was so so, piece was good but taste of fish was not good enough. In one sentence both the fish dishes were below average. Next I ordered for saptapodir avinobo mangso (mutton), mutton was well boiled but it's a tomato flavoured dish I did not like that flavour. Chatni was good. Service was not upto the mark. They even forgot to serve two doi katla instead of one. Overall pretty average bengali cuisine restaurant in kolkata.

We came here for our parents' anniversary. We had a great experience. The fish fry was very delicious. We also ordered the murgi chingri lollypop which was good but not extraordinary. In the main course, we had the fish Thali and special non veg Thali. Both were value for money. The bhetki paturi and mutton both were tasty. The parshe was a bit overfried. We also had prawn thermidor which was the best dish of the lot and jhalmuri bhetki which was also good. In desserts we had caramel custard and ice cream patisapta. The custard was good and the patisapta was ok, innovative but so-so in taste. Overall we were satisfied. The staff were very helpful and polite. We would like to visit here again

Went to this place during their special poila baisakh buffet. It was overpriced bullshit that was being served on our plates. Felt as if I went to a biyebari spread which was far from edible. They served food in plastic bowls which looked as if it went in and out of the microwave and had gravy dripping from the sides. The service was horrible where you had to literally shout at them to bring food at the table and they did not even serve everything that was written in the menu. Coming to the food, a roadside eatery serving dal bhaat tastes better than the food I ate there. Worst experience of bengali cuisine in Kolkata. Highly discouraging experience.

On the Bengali New year day I dined out at Saptapadi, Hindustan Park with my family. It's a Bengali gourmet  treat in right earnest with the atmosphere saturated with nostalgic charms of Uttam-Suchitra. The service despite the rush was overstretched but accommodating.Special mention may be made of the starters,'Sorshe parshe' and the 'Bhetki masala' which were deliciously scrumptious. After the fare the juicy paan capped the treat.We wish to visit here again.

We went here today for our Poila Baishak lunch. As expected it was quite crowdy. We had to wait there for over 20 minutes to get ourselves a seat for three.
As we entered we saw a fly flying all over the place. Turn off. Yuck!
Then we got ourselves seated in a table which was wobbly kind of. Not at all comfortable. We didn't complain though. As there was no more place to seat and we were hungry.

We were given the menu card but we couldn't choose our food of our own choices. It was a thali cum buffet system. Unlimited thali rather. Which turned us off again.

Then we were served in a ceramic plate and another thali to keep our non edible stuffs. We were served with Lichu Lonkar Sorbot which was quite new for us but we liked it. Then in starters at first Jhuri Aloo Bhaja Chicken Fry Beguni then White Rice with which we had Muger Daal with Green Peas. Then came Bhekti Maach and Parshe Maach. Bhetki Maacher Paturi which had some lost ingredients with no taste at all. Then came Polao which was sweet in taste with Mutton. Then we had Aamer Chatni with Papad. Then Rosogolla and Mihidanar Payesh.

The cost for three of us were 2346 INR which was not really acceptable with the amount of food they served.

Total turn off. Ranjan Biswas the owner should train their waiters to talk properly and ask them to be more polite in their approach.

Sorry couldn't upload pictures we didn't get time to click any today.

But the food was lacking freshness and warmth. It was understandable considering the rush.
Staffs were very polite and well mannered.
Pulao, mutton, chicken paturi and Aam Pesto murgi (for starter) were delicious.

Hi!! we have visited the restaurant for the first time today and probably it is my last visit there! The members and waiters were very rude and misguided us telling that they are not serving a la carte today!which is a lie. They refused us to show the menu card even. After a round of arguement they have shown us the a la care menu and we ordered. The quality of the food is very bad! We have ordered one starter item called chicken pesto fry. The starter was completely waste of money. It was served cold! We ordered fish fry, polao, lonka chicken, abhinaba maghsho, ilish vapa as main course. The main course was also not upto the mark! I find nothing special in the food. I am so much disappointed with my experience. However, i would like to give a 5 star to Zomato booking system for making the booking easier and fast! But, for Saptapadi i will give a big zero!

Must order "vetki sorshe" & "kacha lanka murgi" I ordered both the dish with dhokar dalna and aam panna shorbat.
Nice quantity with super yammy taste, not like so much misti more like bangal ranna. 
Serving also nice with a humbly way.

One of our best finds during our trip to Kolkata! Excellent decor, hospitality and above everything, high quality food. What really caught our attention was the quality of fish they use. We started with lichu-lonkar shorbot and also tried luchi, kasha mangsho, fish fry, bhetkir paturi, ilish, chingriri malaicurry. Each dish was exceptional! Highly recommended for fellow foodies.

Decided to visit after all the good reviews I heard about the place. Lunch here was rice , dhoka and paneer dalna ,luchi and kosha murgi. Barring the rice the rest of the items were a great disappointment. The staff is polite and friendly and the ambience cozy and comfortable. However sadly the food does not match up to all the hype. The chicken was distateful with 4 pieces and all bones. Dhoka and paneer dalna too was an equal disaster. Everything barring the food was good .

Tucked away in a corner of Purna Das Road (near Hindistan Park), this newly opened bong eatery serves experimental dishes which are absolute delights to the taste buds. I visited the place with my parents for dinner since I was curious to explore this restaurant named after the famous age-old movie "Saptapadi" starring the legendary Uttam-Suchitra pair, and also because my mother and I are die-hard fans of this on-screen couple. To my sheer delight I found that my parents simply loved the cuisine, which is a rare scenario since they are hard to please people in terms of food.
There is an old world charm in this theme restaurant which is bedecked with greyscale pics of Uttam and Suchitra from the movie Saptapadi. The classic bengali music playing in the background and lovely terracotta crockery/water pitchers add to the charm.
The meticulously prepared dishes are not only delicious but also a novelty in bong cuisine, since they have been whipped up with an unusual combination of bengali spices and flavours.

Drink - The hot and sweet Lichu Lonkar Shorbot was a tasteful refreshing cooler.
Starter - The Bhapa Chicken Paturi was soft and delectable.
Main Course - The Bhaja Moong Dal was  awfully tasty, being full of ghee. The Posto Piyaji was an unusually great combination of posto bata (fennel seed paste) and onions. The Chitol Machher Muitha was prepared with a hint of kashundi (mustard gravy) which made it all the more flavorful.  The Achari Gondhoraj Murgi was a heavenly combination of gondhoraj lemon leaf and tangy pickle, with succulent chicken pieces. The Bhapa Bhetki Paturi was delectable too.
Dessert - The Ice cream Patisapta, an unique specialty, was a hot pancake rolled and stuffed with vanilla ice-cream and garnished with strawberry syrup, caramel crunchies and grated coconut. A sheer savoury bliss and a must try item. Lastly, there was the Gondhoraj Caramel Custard, with the essence of gondhoraj lemon leaf tweaking the custard finely, which was thoroughly enjoyable.

I would highly recommend my fellow foodies to visit this food haven and experience unusual delicacies. Also, I got a glimpse of their Poila Boishakh menu (an unlimited thali comprising of a myriad options), which is certainly droolworthy. So be sure to visit this place.

One of our best finds during our trip to Kolkata! Excellent decor, hospitality and above everything, high quality food. What really caught our attention was the quality of fish they use. We started with lichu-lonkar shorbot and also tried luchi, kasha mangsho, fish fry, bhetkir paturi, ilish, chingriri malaicurry. Each dish was exceptional! Highly recommended for fellow foodies.

Decided to visit after all the good reviews I heard about the place. Lunch here was rice , dhoka and paneer dalna ,luchi and kosha murgi. Barring the rice the rest of the items were a great disappointment. The staff is polite and friendly and the ambience cozy and comfortable. However sadly the food does not match up to all the hype. The chicken was distateful with 4 pieces and all bones. Dhoka and paneer dalna too was an equal disaster. Everything barring the food was good .

A delight for any fan of the 60's era of Bengali cinema. Old Bengali songs playing in the background transports you back to the days of black and white and yet the food is a pleasant reminder of the colourful gastronomical fusion of the modern era. The place, however, is a bit poky. The wash basin is awkwardly placed at the front of the tables. The entrance is guarded by one refridgerator to the right. However, the Suchitra Sen book on the shelf was a fun read :). (3.5/5)

The Murgi-Chingri lollipop was crispy and succulent on the outside with stuffed prawn paste within. It is a recommended starter. (4.5/5)

The Fish Thali would be a decent choice which contains Luchi and Cholar daal, Sukto, Katla Kalia and a special fish dish of your choice from Aar, Pabda, Vhetki and Chingri. The Vhetki paturi was really good. Then there will be Mango chutney with Papad and Mishti Dahi for dessert. We also tried the Ice Cream Patishapta which looked better than it tasted. 

The Thali had an average presentation. The quantity of food could improve. The Katla preparation was a bit salty but overall the Thali tasted good enough. The Ice Cream Patishapsta was fine.  (3.5/5).

The staff were well behaved and properly dressed and not too chatty. (4/5)

Saptapadi was a nice reminder of how Bengali cuisine can still stand strong amongst the growning Western palates of Kolkata. 
Cheers...

There is very very few places in Kolkata which do justice bongo continental fusion cuisine.Saptapadi excels in this.Each platter is meticulously crafted piece of art, so beautiful the I was feeling bad to dig into it.The decor and ambience time travel you the to the 70s.The crockery and interior give you a very warm traditional feel.We order kacha aam sorbet, chigri stuffed chicken, Mousse stuffed chicken breast, with sezwan pulao, red cabbage salad and tomato tulsi coolie,Mouri pata flavoured Prawn Thermedor with Herb Cheese pulao and red cabbage salad  and ice cream Patisapta (Hot crepe cradling the fluffy cold ice cream within, topped with strawberry syrup on the beach on nuts & caramel).I am in love with all of them and will definitely visit it again to try their other fusion creation.This place is a paradise for food explorers.A must visit.

Are you a bengali or a non bong who wants to taste authentic Bengali Cuisine..then 'Saptapadi' is the place for you...it will satiate every corner of your taste buds​ and will provide you the eternal peace for sure.

 It is placed in the Purna Das Road, Hindusthan Park. Again a great classy restaurant in Gariahat-Golpark area. Second diversion crossing the 'Grub Club'..very near to 'Jhale Jhole Ambole'..!
This place will take you back to the bengali classic era of 90's. The theme of this restaurant is based on the famous splendid movie- Saptapadi starring the most popular and my favourite- evergreen Uttam Kumar and classy Suchitra Sen. The walls are well decorated with posters and hording of that movie and others. Also there is an obsolete motorcycle front that resembles the ride this duo had throughout their carrier and through the sentiments of generations of Bengalis. 
This is a great place for family treat, though the whole place is not that big but one family can sit and have lunch together at a particular place. So its advisable one should call before visit if you have a huge family. Otherwise tables are suitable for 4 people.
Coming to food: we had..

Jhalmuri baked bhetki
Mocha narkel er bora
Macher mathar dal
Icecream Patisapta
Kosha mangsho
Sukto
Jhalmuri baked bhetki one must try. This is by far the most innovative dish I ever had in a fusion bengali restaurant. And also in dessert we had Icecrem Patisapta..it was delicious and yammy..the upper membrane was perfect in thickness and one can actually feel the crushing of small flakes of ice inside the icecream. Perfect taste. 

Ambience was calm, service was prompt and they take care what you need. 
Cons- washroom is outside. you have to wash your hands while others are enjoying their meals so a bad feeling. Price is a bit higher side if you compare with food quantity. Though the taste of foods make that up.
Recommend: For Lunch only..perfect place for lunch and come back have a 'Bhaat Ghum'
cheers!

Sapatapadi is Bengali theme restaurant located in Purna Das Road, near HInduthan Park, South Kolkata. The theme is based on the famous Bengali movie “Sapatapadi”. It is a love story which was played by legendary actor Uttam Kumar and actress Suchitra Sen. 

The decoration of this place is very catchy. Black & white pictures of Uttam-Suchitra from the movie are used to decorate this place. The terracotta plates and pitcher are used to give a touch of old school Bengali culture to this place. The place is not big, max to max 20-25 seating arrangements are available. The staffs and the service boys are very helpful and friendly always ready to take care of you. Some classic old days Bengali music were played in the background which add a refreshing as well as a nostalgia feeling in the atmosphere. I must say the ambiance is very enjoyable. 

I and my fellow foodie friends were invited there for a food tasting events. We tried some Bengali fusion menu. To be honest being a bong I do not have any idea that this kind of Bengali preparation exist. The experience was overwhelming. We tried,

Lichu  Kachalonkar Shorbot- A delicious refreshing drink specially made for us. Sweet litchi and green chilli are used to create a sweet-hot drink. Presentation was also catchy. 

Murgi  Chingri Lollypop- Succulent pieces of chicken stuffed with prawn ragout served with a sauce of gondhoraj-kanchalanka (Green Chilli) & honey. A unique mouth-watering preparation, have a tangy flavour and a perfect combination of chicken & prawn. Too good.

Kacha Lanka Narkel Pesto Murgi – An Italian delicacy sauce blend with Bengali cookery and present a mouth-watering chicken preparation. Served with herb paratha and salad. Chicken was very soft and the greenish pesto sauce added as a taste boost-up. 

Jhalmuri Baked Bhetki with Sour cream and Tomato Kasundi Salsa- This something you want to try if you visit Saptapadi. Puffed rice crusted Vetki fish served with Salsa and sour cream along with Gandhoraj chilli Rice and House salad made of red cabbage, delightfully soaked in sugar syrup. The puffed rice coated vetki was very crispy. Just try it. I am sure you will want more. 

Ice cream Patisapta- Another unique preparation. I ate patisapta before but ice cream patisapta is new to me. Patishapta is Indian pancakes traditionally stuffed with coconut filling but this patisapta was stuffed with ice cream garnished with strawberry syrup and dry fruits. A real bliss for your taste buds. This is something you will never forget. 

Overall great food and great ambiance and a must try for a Bengali food lover. My recommendations to others who haven't visited yet is to try out your taste buds once here. I'm sure you will like it.
 
Thanks  a lot

The Purna Das road is slowly but surely becoming the "Bangali Khawar Street" and yes Saptapadi stands out from the rest. You might feel a bit of pocket pinch if you go for ala carte, on the contrary you should definitely try out the non veg thali. The food's really good. Be a bit bold to try the fusion food - Prawn Thermidor....
 Additional brownie points to the the amazing decor and ambiance is really great. The staff is very polite.

The name “Saptapadi” meaning seven steps could be an allusion to a seven course meal as well. At least, that is what I had guessed. But the owner had paid his homage to the quintessential Bengali film through the decor and the names of a few dishes. Not a bad idea, though.

We ordered a special non veg thali. Though the quantity was sufficient for me, my friend thought otherwise. The menu, as expected, was classic Bengali items. It will surely strike a chord if you are staved of authentic Bengali dishes for a long time. The luchi, dal, basanti pulav, mochar torkari, and the ilish were bang on target. The aamer chatni, papad, mishit doi brought down the curtains in style.

Food: 4/5

Service: 3.8/5 

Ambience: 4/5  
The smell of gondhoraj lebu can make any Bangali, living away from Kolkata, a little lenient in the evaluation.

And if you didn’t try bengali delicacies, go on and try some. Well, today we went to a Bengali Themed restaurant, called Shaptapadi. It’s dedicated to the era when bengali movies were nothing less than classics. . And when it comes to Classic Bengali the first names that strike are Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen.
                                                                ...

Trust me guys if you are looking for an authentic bengali cuisine the please try to avoid those fancy " Oh Calcutta" type restaurants and come at saptapadi. The ambience is based on the famous Bengali couple on the silver screen and the food qulaity and quantity is damn good. " Saptapadi" was recommended to be by my friend and boy it was one damn good recomendation. Saptapadi have got two branches " Authentic bengali Cuisine" and " Fusion" I went with the " Authentic Bengali Cuisine".
The things which we ordered are as follows:-
1.Mocha Narkel Bora - Small patties of Mocha and Narkel. Very good choice for starters if you are vegeterian.
2. Macher matha diye mugh daal- This is like the grand old cuisine of bengali culture and saptapadi did perfect justice to it. We had plain rice with the dishes.
3. Daab chingri- I liked the daab chingri way better than Oh calcutta's.
4. Karai kima mangsho- This dish was heaven. It was recommended by the staff there and it was a brilliant recomendation by them. It was a gravy of minced muttons with 4 big chunks of mutton in a thick spicy tasty gravy.
5. Gondhoraj Caramel custard- This was an interesting dessert to finish off our dining expirience. This dish was ok, nothing extraordinary about this.
6. LItche Lanka Sharbat- This beverage is a must try it has the sweetness of litchee and the zing of chilli in it and it tasted awesome. must try this.

The quantity was sumptuos for two people and all this above with a satisfied tummy costed us just 1500 bucks. An awesome restaurant and a must try for all those authenic bengali food lovers.I

Quantity & Price - quantity is very less compared to the price . 

Taste:
Better that average .
The kima mutton kosha was a bit salty .
The Daal & Daab Chingri , I felt , could have been a bit more spicy.
Posto Piyaji should have a bit more posto in it so that we can get the taste of posto.

Presentation:
The thali was served one bowl at a time , which killed the beauty of a well arranged thali .

Ambience:
Very nice ambience . 
Well decorated with pictures of Suchitra Sen and Uttam Kumar. 
In the background they played songs from their movies, which made the environment enjoyable.

ONE THING I MUST SAY THEIR WAITERS ARE A BIT TOO PUSHY.
AT TIMES IT SEEMS THAT THEY ARE ALMOST FORCING YOU TO TAKE A CERTAIN DISH. 

Overall exp : Not extraordinary. But better that average.

Short description: Small, well lite, well managed place near Southern Avenue.
Experience: As usual, could not stop but started looking for a place for family lunch in this gloomy, cloudy day of March. Spatapadi, the name attracted both me and my sweety wifee! She is a fan of Uttamkumar. The environment was good, not like places where you struggle to see your loved ones face! The seating capacity is not much and little cramped. I was facing problem while trying to exit from the table as there was no space behind my chair.

Coming to the food, it's quite good. Tried the posto piyaji on the staff's recommendation but it was a failure, had odour and tasted bad. The sweet polao was good, but some might find it little extra sweet. Had chicken kasa for my little angel and surprisingly it was less spicy and she ate it with pleasure! Good one. When I tasted, it was well cooked, properly marinated and tender.

Had restaurant's special mutton, again on recommendation and this was a hit! Very well cooked and well balanced in usage of spices.

The desert section is deserted and there was nothing we were interested to taste (they offered only two items).

Overall, a nice place for authentic and fusion Bengali cuisines. Staffs were courteous.

Extra 0.5 given since the food was good for the angel.

Forgot to mention about the paturi, the fish tasted good but it was missing the punch of mustard seeds!

Well !! Trust me !! I dont like Bengali cuisine.
Because everyday i have to eat vat ,dal ,sukto ,macherjhol, chatni etc. Yeap everyday!!

Awwwhhh!! My tastebuds become bore with it.
They said "oh plz !!! No more bengali cuisine !! For God sake !! " -_-
When my parents said lets Go to a Authentic Bengali restaurant for weekend !! That time I like to stay at home & order some continental or Adhwani cuisine for me !!! :P
So i had same reaction when Rajdeep Da called me for yesterday's event .. -_-

Yesterday, our panchphoron group went to a Bengali Themed restaurant, called Shaptapadi. It's dedicated to the era when bengali movies were nothing less than classics.

Trust me guys !! After yesterday .. again i fall in love with Bangali cuisine !! Now i can understand the meaning of that line "Banglar mukh ami dekhiachi, tai ami prithibir rup khujite jai na ar" !!

Holy something!!! They Did a tremendous & testy experiment with Bengali Foods !! They did a proper fusion of Bengali cuisine!! Just loved it!!
There presentation was marvellous!!
I thought that i come to a Continental restaurant!!
Now i can spend my weekend with my parents in a Bengali restaurant, love you saptapadi !! 
Location- located at Purna Das Road, near Hindustan Park.

Ambience & stuff - Old classics were being played, and food served in earthen utensils, just creates the perfect bengali ambience. The restaurant staff were extremely polite and assissted us in all aspects.

So here we start off!

1. Fresh Lime Soda- So we were served with fresh lime soda, which we colloquially call 'Pati Lebur Shorbot'. Genuine and refreshing taste, nothing less than a thirst quenching drink.

2. Lichu-Kachalonkar Shorbot- The name itself suggests how impressive it can be. This drink was an absolute delight. The perfect blend of Litchi and Green chili was just mind blowing. Must try next time you hit Shaptapadi.

3. Murgi-Chingri Lollypop- Another unique dish from Shaptapadi. Finger licking, juicy and tangy fusion of chicken and prawn. This dish is a masterpiece.Highly recommended!!

4. Jhalmuri Baked Bhetki with Sour cream and Tomato Kasundi Salsa- Puffed rice coated Bhetki, absolutely crunchy and tasty. A lip smacking and tangy sauce, namely the Tomato Kasundi Salsa, and Gandhoraj Chili Rice was served along with it. The delicacy was a pure delight.

5. Kancha Lonka Posto Murgi- This dish was served along with crunchy Nacho shaped parathas and roasted tomato with Bengali spices. The main dish tasted really amazing, soft and Delicious . This delicacy was a fusion of Bengali and Continental Cuisine and was presented well too.

6. Ice-cream Patishapta- And just another display of their creativity. Heavenly sweet item, sweet enough to fix your dull mood. A must try dessert.

2. Lichu-Kachalonkar Shorbot- The name itself suggests how impressive it can be. This drink was an absolute delight. The perfect blend of Litchi and Green chili was just mind blowing. Must try next time you hit Shaptapadi.

3. Murgi-Chingri Lollypop- Another unique dish from Shaptapadi. Finger licking, juicy and tangy fusion of chicken and prawn. This dish is a masterpiece.Highly recommended!!

4. Jhalmuri Baked Bhetki with Sour cream and Tomato Kasundi Salsa- Puffed rice coated Bhetki, absolutely crunchy and tasty. A lip smacking and tangy sauce, namely the Tomato Kasundi Salsa, and Gandhoraj Chili Rice was served along with it. The delicacy was a pure delight.

5. Kancha Lonka Posto Murgi- This dish was served along with crunchy Nacho shaped parathas and roasted tomato with Bengali spices. The main dish tasted really amazing, soft and Delicious . This delicacy was a fusion of Bengali and Continental Cuisine and was presented well too.

6. Ice-cream Patishapta- And just another display of their creativity. Heavenly sweet item, sweet enough to fix your dull mood. A must try dessert.

Last Saturday me and one of my ex colleagues decided to have a lunch at this place.The decor was good n inviting......the walls were adorned with pictures of legendary actors like Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen.The waiters were polite n helpful. But the service was too slow.We ordered Kancha aamer shorbot and fresh lime soda to quench our thirst.Tgen for the starters,we ordered Sonali bhetki and posto peyaji.After sitting for an hour or so,came the starters.We got very irritated,so one of the waiters informed that one of the cooks was absent today.Coming to the food, the bhetki fry was not tasty and was very dry.The posto peyaji was the worst we had eaten till date.The peyajis were not fried well and the posto was stale.We were quite disheartened.For our mains we stuck to the traditional menu of mishti pulao n daab chingri.The only item worth mentioning was the daab chingri preparation. The prawns were juicy and well- cooked and tasted heavenly.The manager came for our feedback and we were outright in complaining about the peyajis.Within 5 minutes, he had served a complimentary plate of posto peyajis.This time they were really good.This was a good gesture on the manager's part and we truly appreciate it.Food was ok type.Not highly recommended.

Saptapadi is quite an experience.

The restaurant is a cozy & nice-the theme being inspired from “Saptapadi”-legendary bengali film casting Uttam & Suchitra. The black and white blow ups of Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen that adorn the walls of the cosy restaurant in Purna Das Road reminds guests of the golden age of Bengali cinema. 

The terracota plates and pitcher and the wood carvings all around lends a refined earthy feel to the restaurant.The restaurant isn’t a large one but the servings was done with utmost care, affection and undoubtedly the best Bengali food as of now for me to savour your tastebuds. 

Visiting the restaurant is definitely worthwhile as the food is delicious and for an extremely reasonable price. The menu offers a wide variety of Authentic Bengali & Fusion dishes. The Seven points I must mention which has taken care by Management which resulted into an eternal bonding between a Foodie and the Food Joint.

Food, of course

Responsiveness and knowledge of servers

Beverages

Noise level

Decor and furnishings

Washroom

Pocket Pinch

As we sat at the table, I observed the way staffs dealt with other orders that came in, and Mr. Ranjan Biswas was extremely professional and always made sure the client was going to be happy. 

The Dishes We Had :

Fresh Lime soda  – This is a refreshing drink is typical of Calcutta. Cool and refreshing and so much better for you than those chemical laboratory products that wear brand names. And of course the taste of pati Lebu is just to die for. A perfect classic Summer cooler. It was so tempting that I forgot to take the picture of the glass when it was served. You can clearly understand that how thirsty I was.

Lichu – Kachalonkar shorbot – A special presentation for us. (Not in menu)  Litchi Kachalonkar Shorbot  was not just delicious but refreshing too. And the innovations by the Chef is simply to be praised for. Sweet fresh lychees are cut with the heat of a chili to make for a balanced, refreshing summer drink. Fire up with this refreshing and spicy refresher which packs a punch in more ways than one!

Murgi – Chingri Lollypop –  Succulent pieces of chicken stuffed with prawn ragout served with a sauce of Gandhoraj – Kachalanka & honey. These were very nice. They were very rich in flavor and creamy. I really enjoyed the hot sauce. I loved this prawn stuffed chicken. A delicious chicken dish good enough for entertaining the foodies. Maybe not the prettiest of chicken dishes but most definitely one of the tastiest. Chicken and Prawn are such a natural heavenly combination and these prawn ragout stuffed chicken lollypops bring them together for you in one tasty package.

Jhalmuri baked  Bhetki  with sour cream and tomato kasundi salsa – Puffed rice crusted Vetki fish served with Salsa and sour cream along with Gandhoraj chilli Rice and House salad made of red cabbage, delightfully soaked in sugar syrup. Bhetki Fillets, juicy & succulent. The first thought which comes to mind is Fish Fry (the Bong way). But no, here is the twist. Puffed rice has been used in place of bread cumbers to provide it and unique crunchiness which is so different from the later one. Bhetki fillets with a crunchy Jhalmuri topping gives the very healthy baked version of crispy baked fish. I tasted their Gondhoraj Chilli Rice. I was bowled, I was totally mesmerised. Ranjan Da was giving us some details about the preparation of House Made salad of Red Cabbage. I just kept on having that rice with Bhetki without any stopping. Such a deadly combo along with the Salsa which was going so nicely with the package. I just forgot to have that sour cream. Lots of Flavour comedown to a single dish. Juicy fillet, Flavoured rice, Tangy Salsa and Sweet cabbage salad. Just wow wow wow.

Kacha lanka Narkel Pesto Murgi with Herb Paratha and House Salad – An italian delicacy sauce blend with Bengal cookery  resulted into a mouthwatering  preparation. I loved that housemade coconut pesto sauce.This coconut cream pesto sauce was perfect for pouring over soft tender chicken pieces. The zeera rosted tomato was awesome as an add on. It was justified its place in such flavourful dish. Crunchy crispy herb paratha was perfect foil for the chicken dish. Pesto with coconut is the most delicious marinade to have flavorful tender chicken breast. The coconut imparts beautiful the nutty aroma and taste while pesto turns from grass smell to sweet scent while mingling with the juices of chicken. Quiet a Love Story.

Ice cream Patisapta – Patisaptas are made from a batter of rice flour and then shaped and filled with sweet ingredients or coconut soaked in sweet syrup. None of the festivals or celebrations are completed without trays and trays of homemade rice dumplings shaped into various shapes and sizes. But, just forgot about the classic traditional stuffing. Its patisapta of Modern age stuffed with icecream. Straberry syrup on top was just like icing on the cake. Just lip smacking.. A perfect tribute to evening Gastronomical saga spend at Saptapadi.

Saptapadi as a movie is so close to our heart..And Saptapadi as a Restaurant will remain so close to my Heart too as far as gastronomic experiment is concern !! I was blown away by our first ever gourmet experience and will always hold the establishment high on my list. We relished upon a lipsmacking list of preparations. 

Ei poth jodi na sesh hoy

A never ending hunger to explore foods will keep us alive.

Tried the Mourala fry as starters, elish steaks , cappuccino mutton and koi maach. The food was Very good! The desserts are mouth-watering as well. A must try for conneiseurs of good food!

This review is strictly based on a home delivery experience..i had high esteem about this place but they totally screwed me up. Being hopeful that dine in experience wont be that bad. Bengali pulao was extremely sweet as if it was dipped in sugar syrup. special chicken i ordered tasted good but was too oily..mocktail was a disaster and the prawn dish was just ordinary..the paratha was way too hard.

Wonderful place to satisfy your taste buds with typical bong food at affordable price. Theme is related to the famous jodi of bengali cinema uttam-suchitra and the name of the restaurant is also based on their super hit movie "Saptapadi". Decoration is according to the theme. We ordered misti pulao,katla mach and special amish thali,thumbs up and gondhoraj ghol. Quality was excellent taste was also good except misti pulao and doi er ghol as both were too sweet for me.

Its the perfect sentence for the perfect bengali restaurant.
More than the food I fell in love with the ambience. Great Decor, it makes you remember the great timing of bengali legendary pair Suchitra-uttam 
Food was really good speciality the daal, Chingri Malaikari,Saptapadi Spl Phoolkopi & the mutton.
Staff very friendly. 
One must try the Aampora or lichu kacha lonka sharbat.
Over all good experience

The Bengali food served here at Saptapadi is brilliant and will give you a very homely feel. Located on Purna Das Road, Saptapadi offers an amazing ambience. Cladded with the posters of the legendary on screen couple Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen, the name of this restaurant does proper justice to its decor. (Saptapadi is a famous film starring Uttam Kumar & Suchitra Sen)

We ordered plain rice, jhur jhure alubhaja (potato julienne fries), beguni (fried egg plant slices in a spicy gram flour batter), moong daal (lentil) , shukto (a vegetable stew) , shorshe bhetki (basa fish in mustard gravy) and kosha murgi (chicken in a thick tomato gravy). Every item was unique in their own way, however the chicken gravy was on the sweeter side. But everything apart from this was perfect. The staffs were well behaved, polite and eager to help to choose the dish from the menu.

I recommend this place to all Bengali cuisine lovers.

I had visited today 23rd jan evening with my family. The quality was just awesome, my favoirite bengali dishes. I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone. We ordered bhetki fry, crispy chilli mourala, chicken mutton thali, fish thali,jaljeera.Each and every item is just ridiculuously fantastic. One of the most tastiest dishes i have ever had.

The thali consists of Luchi,Cholar Daal,Sabji,Rice/Polao,Chutney,Papad,Mishti Doi..for fish thali katla jhaal is mandatory and one optional between bhetki,pabda,chingri,aar fish. Chicken mutton thali had dhania chicken and mutton curry etc...

Each and every item is wonderful. A must visit for people who love Bengali Dish...

I would recommend the restaurant to add pan masala at the end, then we can say " shaat kola purno holo"...

Very unique menu. Had moori fish stick and murgi chingri lollipop really great pub style food. Ordered Mirchi manghso with pulao for mains, no brianer mutton combo, was delicious. But dish of the day was chingri Malai curry with Radha ballabhi, amazingly rich prawn curry which had me reaching out for more. Do check out this place. Worth it.

Ordered a veg thali for lunch today. It came for Rs 390 including vat and packaging charges. It was a basic veg thali with saada bhat, mixed dal, aloo bhaja, shukto, dhokar dalna, luchi, alur dom, mishti doi, chatni, papad. All the items came in individual containers and foils.
The shukto and dhokar dalna tasted really good. But the quantity of aloo bhaja and papad was really disappointing! Overall the quantity and quality of food was very nice.

Today I had the opportunity to visit 'Saptapadi ' , the Bengali speciality restaurant at Purna Das road,  with my buddy Abhra and his wife Samriddhi. We had a pleasant experience there. Earlier I had visited 'Bhajahari Manna' , 'Sholoana Bangali' , 'kasturi' but here the ambience , service,  food quality out shone others. As soon as we stepped into the restaurant we felt a kind of nostalgia. The beautifully carved wooden walls were decked up with the black and white photographs of our most beloved bengali screen legend Uttam - Suchitra. The melodious soft songs from their films was an added charm. We three were very satisfied with food. The starter  ' Murgi Shobar Opore ' deserves special mention. In the main course we had special fish thali comprising of Chingri Malaikari,  Ilish Bhapa , and Bhetki Paturi.  I enjoyed every item. My friend's wife was in great praise for Bhetki Paturi. The Shukto served in the thali reminded me of my mother. The service section is really praiseworthy - very hospitable , very careful to make the guests feel satisfied. I earnestly wish to visit this place with my family.

Yesterday we went for dinner with our family here...the ambience was really nostalgic.....all around were the beautiful posters off on screen legend UTTAM-SUCHITRA... we ordered "muri fish stick " as the starter...It was a real feast to tongue and innovative....in the mains we opted for "baked dab chingri alaska" which was really out of the box & the chingri was very  fresh & the creamy sauce served with it was simply delicious other parteners opted for contemporary bengali thali which was mindbowing...Our last course came as a surprise package "the Ice-cream ; patishapta"...It had really a different taste...Special mention-the service personnel-very hospitable which made us feel "at home"....We really love to see this outlet flourishing all over INDIA............😍😊😋😘💐♥👍👍👍👍👍👍

For Bengali cuisine, better stick to 6th Ballygunge place or Oh Calcutta. 
This bengali cuisine restaurant is located at Hindustan park; easiest  way to reach is to take left turn from Golpark petrol pump while coming from Dhakuria. After seeing positive reviews on Zomato about this place, I decided to give a visit on a Sunday afternoon. The ambience is pretty decent, lots of natural light coming in and the glass windows overlooking the street. But we had terrible experience with the food. We ordered one Chicken mutton thali and one fish thali. The serving size was terribly small, as if being served to a beggar. The 'aloor dum' had only one half potato in it..can you imagine? And that's the veg of the day !!!! They will serve loochi with the thali, but you will have nothing to eat the loochi with! Terrible thali preparation! Chicken served is only one small piece, so is the mutton. The taste was very very average! You don't need to go to restaurants for this kind of food. If you visit here sometimes, never ever order their thalis. It was a huge letdown, never visiting here again.

When you name a restaurant after one of the cult movies, it's bound to attract the Bengalis even to eat bhaat-dal-poshto in a restaurant. The magic of the Uttam Suchitra pair, and especially moments from Saptapadi resonates through the decors of this place. Even though the place is small, it has been smartly utilised to pack in as many chairs and tables as possible. The large glass window looks out onto the street below and once you're comfortably seated, you can start humming the Bengali classics that ups the ambience of the place. 

The first thing that made a mark on me was the earthen croceries used. There was even an earthen pot for keeping the water! That aside, we were a little late for lunch, though extremely starved and so started ordering straightaway. 

1. Kesar Badam Shorbot: They have a limited range of refreshments, and this was the only unique one that caught my eye. However, the badam wasn't pasted neatly and you could feel the coarseness pretty well. So much so, that the straw too was getting clogged at times. Not recommended. 

Starters:
1. Murgi-Chingri Lollypop: 3 pieces of what looked like Drums of Heaven were served. However, I didn't expect even the taste to resemble that! I could barely find any taste of Prawn, and am not sure why it was named such. The taste however, never fails to disappoint. 

Main Course: 
1. Luchi and Achari Gondhoraj Murgi: I wanted to go for the golden combination of Luchi and Chholar Daal, however my friend insisted that we try out a chicken preparation instead. The Chicken had the taste of pickles to it, though the heavenly smell of Gondhoraj was lacking. It's unfair to draw comparisons, but I would say, I have tasted better. 

2. Baked Dab Chingri Alaska: I always am fascinated by fusion food, and I thought, why not give it a try here too? This dish is a variation of the popular Daab Chingri with a layer of foamish Baked Alaska. The outer layer has a high chance of spoiling your taste buds, so I think it's better to stick to Daab Chingri only, except that you might not get the accompanying rice! The Daab Chingri is a formula that can never go wrong, and neither does it go for this one. The coconut milk, and the soft chingris can make even Englishmen link their fingers! 

Desserts:
The Desserts section has always been my favourite, and I would say, Saptapadi doesn't disappoint me here with its wide range of options. We finally decided to go for the following (Jasmine Tea Misti Doi was the initial choice, but unfortunately it wasn't available) :
1. Gondhoraj Caramel Custard: This tasted almost no different than a normal Caramel Custard other than a little lemon-y feeling. Again, the captivating smell of Gondhoraj was missing. 

2. Icecream Patishapta: This is one of the unique items this place offers. And I would say it's a must try! Frozen ice cream inside a wrapped Patishapta is instead something you wouldn't want to miss out on. 

Probably we are too accustomed to our 'Dida-Thakumar hather ranna' to truly appreciate Bengali cuisines in restaurants. And Saptapadi misses out on that. But, if you are lacking that experience at home, it is surely worth a visit!

Was looking for some good hygenic bong food and came across this place. It's located in a quiet neighbourhood near golpark.

Ambience of this restaurant is good and is based completely on the name of the movie -Saptapadi- starring Suchitra Sen and Uttam Kumar.

Coming to the food, the fish fry was made from actual bhetki fish and was fresh and very tasty. The Tel Koi was extremely tasty and was made with immense perfection. The bhetki macher bhape was delicious and well executed.

The chingri malai curry was extremely well made and the size of the prawns were perfect tiger prawns. 

All in all the food is extremely good and the price is unbelievable decent. I would have given a 5 but the dessert, Ice cream Patishap was not good. I feel they should change it from Ice cream to something else. The chemistry really doesnt work. Secondly I feel the seating and comfortness is something that has scope for improvement.

Went there on a Sunday afternoon. Ambience was good and service boys were very polite and helpful. Food was excellent, especially the Chicken chingri lollypop and the beckti fry with posto and suji coating. Tried almost all the chicken and mutton side dishes and all were very good , try kancha lanka mangsho/chicken. Only bad part was the Hilsha and Aar fish which any way hard to find of good quality in most of the restaurants. Patisapta with ice cream was not at per with the quality of other foods. Overall it was a good experience for bengali cuisine lovers.

Located in Purna Das Road this small joint packs quite a punch. If you crave the old cinematic nostalgia of one of the most iconic pair in bengali cinema then this is the place for you.

The restaurant may be small but it sure makes up for it by its brilliant ambiance and decor.  Coming to the food we ordered The Fish Thali, Special Non-veg Thali, Gandharaj caramel custard and Ice cream Patisapta for desert. The portion was average but the taste of the food was very good to say the least. The fish thali had with your usual sukto and dal , Katla macher kalia and Vetki Paturi. The non veg thali had a mutton, a chicken preparation with Pabda mach er jhal. There was also chatni, papad and of course misti doi the cornerstone of every bengali meal. All the food was awesome and the waiters were also very polite. Will be coming to this place again very soon.

Overall rating ....... if you love bengali food with some golden cinematic nostalgia then visit this place.. Happy Eating.. :)

Though the place was recommended highly by others, we found the food quality to be in a range of average to very bad. 6 of us had gone there for dinner(on a weekday - and the place had only 2 other guests). We started the evening with 4 types of starters : Aloo Jhuri Bhaja & Mochar Chop was good; but Chilli Mourola & Moori Fish Stick left much to be desired; the Fish used in the Fish Stick smelt stale. In main course the dals were good (Machher Matha diye daal and koraishuti Moong Daal); Potoler Dorma was undercooked and the gravy did not sync well with the Potol. For all the N-veg items (Chitol Machher Muiththa; Pabda shorshey and Kancha Lonka Mangsho) the gravy had not seeped into the fish/meat; making it taste dry. The gravy for Muiththa tasted like Tomato Puree; and lacked taste. The mutton gravy was tasteless - lacked spices and also the mutton pieces were half-cooked and did not have any taste- it seemed as if the mutton was separately boiled and put in the gravy; and was not cooked in the spices of the gravy- and hence lacked the taste.The dessert and the drinks were the saving grace for the place - Patishapta Ice-cream and Kancha Lonka-orange drink did not disappoint.Go there only for the drinks, dessert and daal.

There was only 1 fish item thst is bhetki paturi .Other than that it had polau , beguni , aloo bhaja , fish muri fry ( didn't like much ) , dal , sukto , chinri mach er malaikari (with a very small piece ) , mutton kosha , payesh , chutney , papad , 1 toshgulla. Though the taste was very good but thali was bit costly (900/- approx )considering food amount . It is enough for 1 person only . Now coming to a-la-carte . We had bhetki fry , sorshe dia chicken paturi , rice , sukto , mutton curry with karaisuti . All of the items was tasty . In drinks we had aampanna and orange juice with kachelanka . Shows topper was ghandhoraj lebuer custered which we had as dessert .

The food here was undoubtedly awesome. Same goes for its ambiance and customer service. But I was a bit disappointed to come across the fact that there is huge difference in the price structure in Hindustan Park  as compared to that of Ganguly Bagan branch. For instance, SPECIAL FISH THALI is 495 INR in Ganguly Bagan branch and its 690 INR in Hindustan Park (Quantity and quality of items served is exactly the same). This is the case for almost every dish.
Can someone through some light on this ?

Going by the reviews, we ordered the thalis - the fish specials and the non-veg specials. Every item offered to us was superb - from the rice to the pulao, from the dal to the luchi, from the shukto to the fries everything that we had before the non-veg items was delectable. And then we dug into the fish, chicken and mutton dishes - and we were just mesmerised. We ordered additional desserts - the patishapta icecream and the caramel custard. While the first one was not that great, the caramel custard was simply mind blowing. It was a great experience

If you are looking for some nice Bengali cuisine then you would like Saptapadi. We had visited during the Pujas and loved their food. We had ordered Beguni, Alu bhaja, Bheti macher paturi, Kancha Lonka Mangsho and Kochi pathar jhol. The mangsho was really nice and the portions was quite good, though the size of the paturi was quite small. The staff were also helpful. Not too spacious and have about 10 tables. The decor is nice specially with the bike headlight and pics of Uttam-Suchitra from the movie Saptapadi

We ordered 2 thali,3 plates of plain rice,1 plate luchi and daab chingri  which was sufficient for four people.
In thali they provide vat ,dal ,alu vaja,til lonka murgi, golmorich bhetki ,veg of the day,bhetki paturi , chingri malakari,mutton kasa,chatni , pappd,rosogolla.

And Daab was just awesome.

Staffs are very courteous.they repeatedly asked us about the food....was it okay or not ....

Indeed It was great start for us for this durga puja 😃

We went there for this panchami dinner.  Food was good. Mutton was delicious.  Ambience and the staff was great. Good place for family gathering. But they served very small number of varieties.  There was only two items for veg people with out dal.  So we had to ordered that what they had.  We had no choice. We also ordered bhetki paturi which was not good. Fish was not soft and test of the fish was also not that good.  We are Little disappointed regarding the menu. Without these it is a good place to go.

Named on a famous Bengali movie and interior resemble the same. 

We ordered kancha aam er sorbot (aam panna drink), gondhoraaj chaa er sorbot (lemon ice tea), sonali bhetki (fish rawa fry), sobar upore chingri (schezwan prawn), illish steak (boneless illish in mustard sauce, served with steam rice & boiled veggies), gondhoraaj custard (caramel custard with a piece of lemon on it).

Menu card names are attractive, however in real it's same old food. Teast not real good. They have huge space for improvement.

Situated at a calm place in Hindustan Park area. Name is based  on the famous Bengali movie Saptapadi; they have designed their restaurant beautifully with the photographs from the move.

They serve authentic bengali food, they have special non veg fish thali which includes ilish(Hilsa), chingri(prawn), bhetki paturi. 

The quantity is good enough, the service was really good and fast, the restaurant 's staffs were very polite.

Overall great food and great ambience and a must try for a bengali food lover.

On Navami afternoon me and my family planned to have our lunch outside. We already heared some good sounds about Saptapadi. So we have ordered Special Thali available during this puja. The thali was good except the mutton as we found there was no mutton in my thali, only the fat portion of the meat which was not eatable at all. As all the items are given only one piece each so I miss the teste of mutton. To fullfil the teste gap on that ospicious day we ordered extra diss of meat to complete our lunch. Thanks for giving us a great lunch on this puja.

Today Me and my family went to this place for lunch. We had ordered "Thali" . The quality of the foods are worst. Basically " Chingri Malaicurry" & Mutton preparation are  worst. The "Days special food was Stale". however after awaiting for long,I was informed that the ones i ordered are unavailable and so they are unable to deliver it to me!!!

Worst services! The management is very worst  and behaviour was very poor. Don't go this restaurant very worst.

Another gem on Purna Das Road offering both authentic and fusion bengali cuisine. Ambience goes perfectly with the theme. Great duo of Uttam kumar n Suchitra Sen all over the wall. Clay utensils is an add on. Food is delicious. My personal favourites are muri  fish stick, posto chicken coin, baked daab chingri alaska, murgi sober opore to name a few.
Pocket pinch will be around 500 to 700 per head.
Overall a great place to enjoy some great food.
Happy dining!

Wanted to try out Bengali specialities and so went for a Sunday lunch with my family. Location is nice and quiet and ambience is homely. The restaurant had a theme and the place was clean. Ordered beguni as starters which was crisp and nice with a unique blend of flavour. Then we ordered mutton which was awesome, my favourite bhetki paturi which was the best among all that we ordered. We also had chingri malaikari which was just right in terms of spiciness. I ordered luchi and chholar dal since it is a must have for luchi lovers like me. Luchi was soft and fluffy and I truly relished it. In the end we had chatni and Papad and must say the chatni was awesome even though I am not a chatni fan. Very friendly staff and the suggestions were also good. Prompt service made the experience delightful. Will come back here again real soon.

Hidden gem to try out the bengali fusion food at a reasonable rate. Tried the prawn thermidor  and ilish steak which was awesome. Among other authentic bengali items - Kacha Lonka mutton, macher matha diye daal tasted very delicious and in the dessert platter - gondhoraj caramel custard is simply out of the world.Service was instant and the staffs are courteous..

A small place Saptapadi in Purnadas Road just beside Tero Parbon Restaurant. We had ordered rice, macher mathar mugdaal, chingri sobar opore, chitol macher muithya, kacha lanka murgi and gondhoraj caramel custard. It was an amazing experience. The blend of spices and flavour was too good. The smell of kacha lanka and sarsher tel made the murgi delicious. Chitol macher muithya was spicy but tasted amazingly. The chingri as a starter was a perfect one. And in the end the desert made the whole experience so good that I am planning to visit the place really soon. Just to add the behaviour of the staff was quite good and welcoming. The ambience and the evergreen songs from the film Saptapadi make you fall in love with the place. It definitely deserves a 5 point rating 😊

Good place to have Bengali food and Bengali fusion cuisine. Their menu has many varieties to choose from. We tried the Baked Dab Chingri which was delicious daab chingri served with a flavoured rice and a dressed salad. Apart from that we had the thalis. Kancha Lanka murgi was something new that we tried. Pabda and Katla were disappointing though.

Fantastic concept of Fusion Starters & Authentic Bengali Food at Saptapadi!

It was time for some mouthwatering and lipsmacking Bengali dishes after some regular outings at Kababs and Continental outlets - and SAPTAPADI is the ideal place for such a changeover of the Taste Buds. 

Visited the branch at Purna Das Road with 5 of our foodie friends on a Sunday afternoon.The restaurant isn't a big one but the servings was done with utmost care, affection and undoubtedly the best Bengali food as of now for me to savour your tastebuds.

Myself, and my foodie friends opted for 5 Fish Thali's and a single Non-Veg Thali. Each of these Thali had Rice, Dal, Shukto, Beguni, Jhuro Alu Bhaja and Bhetki Paturi as the common heads. For the Non-Veg Thali, a Chicken preparation in a green coriander paste, and a Mutton preparation in a spicy red chilli paste was served. For the ones opting Fish Thali, we could relish upon a lipsmacking preparation of Ilish Bhapa, which was slightly spicy in taste owing to the fierce green chili, and a subtle preparation of Chingri'r(PRAWN) Malaikari.

And how did i forget to mention some of the the famous Fusion starters!! Besides the conventional Thali's, the list included Fish Finger with batter and coating of Muri (Puffed Rice), Murgi Sobar Opore (A tangy and spicy Mexican fusional dish, served on skewers), Posto and Chicken fritters, and Postor Bora. A Litchi-Lonka Shorbot, and Gondhoraj Lebu'r Chaa were opted for, to take care of our thirst.

The wholesome meal ended with some delights of Bengali culture - Papad, Chutney and Dahi, the perfect sweet ending to any love story. 

Well worth mentioning the Interrior decoration of the Restaurant, the picture frames of legends, Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen that included stills from SAPTAPADI film. The ambience was fine with the ever active support staff's and the service was very prompt.

My ratings:

Ambience - 4.5

Food     - 5

Service  - 4.5

My Recommendation to the existing menus:-

Please remove LUCHI from the Fish Thali as RICE type items best gel with any kind of Fish dishes. Can include an additional Sweet items/Paan (Betel leaf) instead.

My Recommendations to others who haven't visited Yet is to try out your taste buds once here.I'm sure you will like it.

We went for a family lunch today, as we entered we felt good about its ambience, the clay utensils used was its usp! But coming to its food, it was below expectations, coming to the starter The ckn lollipop was awesome nd the lichu and aam panna drink was worth the money. The main course disappointed us. The Ilish preparation was disastrous, it was not even fried properly, it's was smelling also. Dab chingri was so so. Mutton was good. Chicken was too bad to eat.

This has got to be one of my nicest eating experiences in some time. Saptapadi epitomizes what Bengali cuisine is all about: subtlety of flavors, respect for ingredients, hospitality, and a commitment to pleasing the diner.

I have a confession to make. I have had limited interaction with Bengali food so far in my life. In fact, my favourite Bengali meal has been at Oh! Calcutta at the Delhi outlet, and I understand that though it’s a fair representation of Bengali cuisine, it’s not the ultimate representation, any die-hard Bengali food lover will probably tell you.

As for Saptapadi, the décor is simple, unpretentious and is meant to evoke a feeling of home and comfort. Most importantly, the restaurant focuses on what any restaurant should: the food.

For starters, we ordered the ilish machher paturi. You just had to unwrap the banana leaves and let the goodness of the aroma flow to your olfactory receptors.  And once you dig in, you realize that the flavors and the depth of taste weren’t solely restricted to the top layer of the hilsa. Moreover, steaming ensured the inside of the fish cake was juicy and that flavor from the outside marinade had percolated throughout. 

This is the truly the mark of a good ilish machher paturi- the mustard marinade isn’t supposed to dominate the taste but rather complement the texture of fish. 

Coming to the mains now.

The Daab Chingri was truly sublime in every aspect, be it the subtlety of flavors, the presentation, the serving size or the overall taste. I highly recommend this.

Rice quality could make or break the eating experience; you want long-grain rice such as Basmati to go along with thin gravies. Thankfully rice is such an intrinsic part of Bengali cuisine that it's just hard to go wrong here.

Next up was Kasha Mangsher Jhol, which was had with luchi. This was pretty good, just that it’s hard to match up to Daab Chingri. And though it was finely prepared, such was the nature of the dish that the interplay of spices would dominate the taste.  As a result, you cannot discern between the different ingredients or for that matter, the different contours of taste on the tongue that the dish has to offer. Good but not great is all I can say for this.

The server was friendly and helpful, and made sure we were satisfied with the overall experience.  

I know Bengalis can be rather lazy (and quite proud of it), but guys please go out and popularize this food nationally and internationally. This is just fantastic.

.ambience...food...all enveloped in a perfect combo..a perfect gastronomic extravaganza..We ordered A lollypop starter...The uniqueness however comes in the form of mashed shrimp pashe encased inside the mildly spicy covering...Just when i had reached the flavor heaven..We were greeted by Baked Daab Chingri Alaska..A magical concoction accompanied by Gondhoraj rice...both are their signature items...The baked daab chingri alaska is a different and unique take on the conventional daab chingri..And we even ordered an extra portion of gondhoraj rice...such was the match made and so tempting was the aroma..Last but certainly not the least each and every person wore the sine qua non smile and made the experience worth remembering for a long long time...etched in the labyrinth of memories for time immemorial..Thank you Saptapadi...def recommeding the same to everyone willing to taste the difference

On the recommendation of a FOODIE friend 6 of us gathered here on a Sunday Noon to have lunch with high expectations and we were absolutely not dissappointed..........Starting from Muri Fish steak and continuing with  Postor bora till Fish Thali , every item was worth the money spent. Though i felt that the Luchi served with the thali was bit of a mis match, still it nowhere demeaned the taste of the items. what was perfect was the Sorshe illish ......the gravy was perfectly blended and the aroma was tickling.......must not forget to mention the bhetki paturi....which was soft and smooth to the perfect....and to talk of ambience, it was quite cosy as per its size. Not to forget the warmth and courtesy shown by the Staffs there.

Went for a lunch on a rainy sunday afternoon. Got place immediately. Staffs are quite courteous. This place is on purna das road very next to tero parbon. A small place but neat and soothing ambience. They have 3 categories of food- fusion, combo thalis and ala carte. We selected few dishes from the menu. Mostly all are good except few.
Chingri biriyani- extremely dissapointing, too too oily and god only knows who makes biriyani using tomato
Postor bora- another oily dish, breaking easily
Mourolar chachori- the winner, a mix of brinjal and mourola, very tasty
Chitol muitthya- well made tender but gravy very oily
Patoler dolma- the gravy has a unique flavour
On dessert i liked the concept of ice cream patisapta and its good.
Overall a great experience but too much oil is not well.

Came here with my family yesterday. Located at Purna Das Road, it's very easy to find out. Serves authentic Bengali cuisine along with fusion delicacies. The décor is perfectly suited to the theme and name of this place, a classic hit of the Bengali duo Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen.
Food was over all good. Needs a few improvement in some cases. We had -
Lichu Lonkar Sharbat - Use of synthetic litchi juice and karamcha instead of cherries can be checked upon. Loved the jerk that comes after taking a sweet sip. Good although.
Ilish Finger Toast - A new innovation. Ilish pâté served on breads. Loved it. Never thought of trying this continental delicacy with our jewel of Bengal. Loved it.
Mocha Narkeler Bora - I didn't have it. But my family loved this dish and praised a lot about it.
Posto Piyaji - This dish too was really good. Flat onion pakodas with poppy seeds. A classic Bengal delicacy and really good.
Murgi Chingri Lollipop - This dish is not something I would recommend. The sauce was extremely spicy and there was no hint of prawns.
For main course, we had -
Luchi - This wasn't good. It wasn't fulko at all and there was a lack of the whiteness in the colour which defines the elegance of this beauty.
Dhoka Paneerer Torkari - The disappointment with luchi was compensated by this subzi and we all loved it.
Daab Chingir Baked Alaska - This dish was absolutely delicious. The gravy was thick and good. Loved the aromatic Gondhoraj rice. I would suggest if they work upon the recipes and serve the prawns without the shells.
Overall a good experience. This place is a newbie in the food scenario of Kolkata. They should work upon the finesse about the originality of their products used and recipes and a few things like the cutlery and all. I am sure working on all these, Saptapadi will soon become a hit. Best wishes to the team. Happy Dining! :)

True Flavor Of Bengal

We had a lunch over here few days ago. It was on Sunday, and a rainy one. When I entered this place the only thought came to mind was what else other than this can suit the climate.
There were background songs from Uttam-suchitra movies, wooden furniture and earthenware utensils. There were the portraits and stills from the movies hanging on the wall. A perfect ambience to have Sunday lunch. We ordered rice, jhurjhure alu bhaja, mooger daal, ilish bhapa and Shaptapadi special mutton. They served the food hot ! We were hungry and yes, we jumped.
Ilish was too good. It reminded me some old taste of ilish which usually I can't find now. The mutton was spicy and soft as well. Awesome quality for food. The staffs behaved in a friendly way with us. And we were coming out with a satisfied soul, smiling face and filled epidemic.
I will visit very soon. A good restaurant for those who crave for Bengali cuisines. Lots of love for Saptapadi :)

Went there with 5 more persons. Very near to Golpark more. Have had Special non- veg thali inclusive of Vetki Paturi along with Posto- r Bora, Posto Bata Chicken Coin, Murgi sobar opore, Moori Fish Stick and Gondhoraj Cha-er Shorbot. The Moori FIsh Stick was the best thing.
Two things to note: Murgi sobar opore is nothing other than Chicken wings (it was good anyway). And I hope the next time, the Vetki Paturi will contain a slightly less amount of mustard as it brings bitter sensation (well, I'm being harsh critic here, but I'm sure they'll correct it).
In the Thali, the Luchi was extra (as we were served with rice when we needed again). Easily can be excluded.
All over, it costed us 1000+ per head.

Saptapadi may be new in the city & may not be very popular but truly speaking this place is mind blowing. Ambience is nostalgic with Uttam Kumar & suchitra Sen's photos everywhere.Terracotta pots add more grace to it's ambience.But the real USP is obviously their fusion food items.Murgi chingri lollipop is purely mouth watering rasun bhetki paturi was also too good.kacha Lanka murgi is also different kind of preparation.Overall it was really awesome experience.

I visited this place on a Sunday afternoon, so expected it to be busy and it was busy in fact. Not all seats were full but there were few parcel orders. 
My experience is mixed. Here is what I feel. 

Food :
I have tried and tasted authentic Bengali food in many similar restaurants in Kol. I bet you will fall in love with this place for its authentic Bengali taste. 

Rice with narkel dal is a good one. I liked it very much
Kochu saag with ilish macch er matha : this item is not there in the menu list but they can make it. It costs 75 bucks and the quantity is quite good. You must try it if you are here
Pomfret fry : It is a medium size pomfret fried with a coating. Good but I had better pompret fry elsewhere. 
Chitol Macch er muitha : this is fabulous. I have tasted this in other restaurants as well, but this was one surely the best. 
Tel Koi : this was is superb too. I am not a great fan of Koi, but this is very unique and cooked to perfection
Bou Thakuranir haat er bora : 4 pieces, 80 bucks. Just loved the taste. Dont remember if I ever had such tasty bora. 
Achari gandhoraj murg : as the name suggests, it is Chicken cooked with Achar. I will not say it is bad, but there  is too much pickle in it. Worth trying though

Ambience :
Well decorated with Uttam Suchitra theme. If you are a fan of old Bengali cinemas or otherwise,  you will like it. There is decent amount of space between the tables.

Service :
hmmm.....as you might have read in the other reviews as well, this is the problem part. We waited for almost an hour to get the food on our table. You seriously lose patience. I followed up several times and finally they said it was because of a large parcel order which was being fulfilled. But it it the same situation everytime. 

Price :
Not that pricey. 500-600 per head if you eat well. 

I will go again just for the taste of their food. I recommend you try.

We had dinner here last Sat (20-Aug) with family. To start with the ambience is very good, calm and quiet. The staffs are very cordial and can guide you the best dishes according to your taste. SPL Fish Thali was awesome with Bhetki Paturi, Pron Malaikari and Hilsa Vapa. Each item was very tasteful and you can enjoy food. I advice people to try Fish thali along with some fusion dishes.

I went there one rainy night along with my family. The interior is small but we'll set up. There are pictures of Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen through out. We ordered special fish thalis for each of us along with a fusion chicken dish and ilish poppers as starters. The food was very good. Ilish poppers were unique and wonderful. We couldn't have any more by the end of the meal. Service is what you would expect. Nice place to bring your family to.

* Ambience : The ambience caught all my attention. Beautifully decorated with all clay pots on the table including plate,glass,jug etc. Saptapadi movie pics and all those memorable scenes all over the place. This cuisine is more spacious than Jadabpur outlet. A cool,calm atmosphere with all romantic Bengali Uttam-Suchitra songs.. Very ideal with my taste. (rating 10 on 10).

* Food : 1. We started with kancha aam er sorbot. Coolers are good.
2. Rice with narkel daal was a hit here,I liked it very much.
3. Chanar kofta was also tasty,but pieces were less as compared to its price.
4. Chingri malaikari was a total flop here. I couldn't even imagine they could give so much small pieces as malaikari itself is fafamous for its jumboness. it dissapointed me.
5. Bhetki patiri was so delicious that I had ordeted 3 more after consumed the first one. It was a supethit item. if I had known about flop malaikari I would have opted for more bhetki paturi.
6. Ilish macher bhapa was hugely spicey and the piece was not that big. I was not satisfied with its taste also. we couldn't even taste its curry as it was very spicey.
7. Karai keema mangso was the best. I will only visit again this outlet for karai keema mutton....so so delicious and perfectly cooked.

* Management : Very poor management. We entered @ 1 pm and got our food @ 2.15. I was about to leave and heading towards another restaurant if they would late 5 minutes more. We were 5 friends, so time spent; but waiting so much time was very frustrating. There were no many people,but I observed the service staffs were getting so much chaos,they were not used to this much of rush,I guess. Very much dissapointing.

* Why reccomended : Only for its charming ambience (without this unprofessional bunch of service staffs) and as a huge mutton lover... I will visit for KADAI KEEMA MUTTON. SO MUCH DELICIOUS.

Had an awesome experience of dining here today. The ambience is good with reminiscence of saptapadi movie and the behaviour of the staff too. The special mentions in main course are baked daab chingri Alaska, illish steak (fusion), kasha mangsho , and chingri-murgi lollypop in starter . In the end ice cream pati sapta was delicious. A must visit for Bengali food lovers at this newly opened branch of Saptapadi.

Another tick to my wish list and it was worth the wait. Saptapadi located at Purna Das has been a revelation. We were two and was pretty early for lunch and that too on a monday.Expectedly it was empty and were offered seat by the side of the iconic poster of the greatest jodi of bengali cinema. The interiors have been themed as a tribute to the effervescent uttam-suchitra and was nicely done. The staff were very polite and courteous. They have designed their menu based on traditional and fusion keeping the ethnicity of what we bengalis like in mind. We ordered for kacchu shag bruschetta(₹285)-a fusion dish comprising of 6 pieces of bruschetta bread with kacchu shag toppins.Quite innovative.Our second starter was murgi chingri lollypop(₹250)-3 pieces of chicken lollypop having a layer of crispy kucho chingri-it was okayish in taste.In the main course we had chingri biriyani-hyderabadi style biriyani with 2 medium sized prawn (₹300)-Expected a lot but returned disappointed out of it. Should and could have been better. The aroma what we look for in biriyani was missing big time. Hyderabadi biriyani lovers will like it. On the sides we took keema kosha mangsho based on the steward's recommendation and it turned out to be the best (₹325). It had 4 pieces of succulent mutton cooked in a gravy of keema. Awesome. We took a paratha (saat pake bandha)-₹20 which was nothing but laccha paratha,neatly done though.In the desert we opted for orange kachalonka mousse (₹90)-mermalade upon mousse with a cherry on the top. It was nice but missed the spice of kachalanka in it. 
Looking forward to visit again soon to savour their fusions and ofcourse the ilish sizzler.

Good hospitality and good food. Loved the Pora Aam er shorbot at the start followed by Saptapadi Abhinaba Chicken and Macher Matha diye dal. Also liked their Patishapta Ice cream which was a unique fusion bengali preparetion. Fish seems to be their speciality and i liked all of them. But you can give their Pulao a miss.

We ordered 4 plates of Doi Murgi, 4 plates of Chingrir Malaikari and Paneer Dhokar Dalna as parcel. Food was not awesome as reported. I believe it is a hype. Non vegetarian items were extremely spicy and hot. Prawns are not so fresh. However Paneer item deserves 5 out of 5.

After seeing lots of great reviews in zomato, we planned to visit this place.. specially when I am always a great fan of bengali cousin. 
So first the good points... Quality of the foods really AWSOME>>> no question asked they know what they are serving. "The Fish Thali" is enough for One person, though I feel quantity of rice should increase. I will recommend you to select the "Vetki Bhape" as the other fish in the thali, it is one of the best Vetki I had in a restaurant.  
Now the bad part, we ordered "Posto Bata Chicken Coin" again the quality and taste really good. But according to the price they serve only four pieces, Not done!!! 
So, in short its a well furnished, nice ambience bengali restaurant with mix of fusion food. I love the song selection of old melodies, really soothing for your ears. Also well cooked food, but its little costly for sure. Though I don't mind the cost if the quantity is balanced with the price rate, but in that department, I am not fully satisfied. They can improve in that part. 
So surely I will recommend this place to all the bengali food lovers to visit once, to taste some well cook bengali authentic and fusion cuisine.

Saptapadi offers you to relish authentic bengali food till its last bite. The musical depiction of uttam- suchitra's journey with bangali pora maatir bashon and the whiff of gondhoraaj lebu added an extra edge to the bangaliyana of the restaurant. Bhetki golden fry, Mishti polao, mutton saptapadi special, shorshey eelish, aam pora shorbot made my lunch on a sultry Monday afternoon memorable. Their "athitheyota" or service goes without mentioning. I would definitely come back here and would reccomend others too. Reasonably priced, Saptapadi has surely made its place in my top ten. Good job Saptapadi! 😀

It was an awesome experience dining at Saptapadi. Have read about the food and warm service across many places but getting myself treated the special way means a lot. It was a late Sunday lunch, the place stands quiet prominent on Hindustan Park road, and ensures a good ambiance for diners. Although late but we ordered for pretty good portions and the food was definitely the regular Bengali palate, but slight different in its taste and texture yet authentic. The Katla Kalia was simply ecstatic and i had never fallen in love with the bengali mishti pulao but at Saptapadi i simply got bowled over. Taking you back to the golden era of Bengali cinema en framed on the walls is preserved as a decor at this place. If talking about innovation, i love the hand wash basin, it implies to the creative use of antique and forgotten treasure, wont reveal much as i really want my fellow foodies who are yet to visit to please check it yourself.  Team Spatapadi great going, and its simply flawless the way you take care of each and every diner at your place, keep going, and i will soon be back...........this time the bhapa murgi is on top priorities for my order....cheers!!!!

Saptapadi Restaurant - Bengali Fusion at it's best.
=====
Intro + Location: 

Finally i complete my 500 reviews with Saptapadi Restaurant. Zomato in association with Calcutta Foodies Club had organised a meet here for the people who share the love of food. It had few items from the upcoming Hilsa Festival for tasting. A seperate bengali cuisine menu was made for us to try out the delicacies of Saptapadi. The owner of this place is Mr. Ranjan Biswas who was quite courteous and is a chef himself. He likes to experiment and fuse food dishes in order to come up with something new every time. He had explained us what food means to him and how he came up with the restaurant. The restaurant is elegant with a touch of old reminiscing times sharing about Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen. I liked the decor and ambiance as it was quite different. There were tumblers kept on the table made of hard clay to replace to jug. 

This place is located very near to Tera Parbon. If you are going from Delices to Azad hind take a right and after walking a bit you will see it on the left side. 
=====
What we had: 

Beverages
• Lichu Lankar Sorbot - I really liked it. It was subtle. A perfect blend of sweet and spicy. Totally loved it. It was simple yet enticing. #musttry ✌✌

• Illish Chilli Toast - It was well presented. The illish was deboned and the toast was crunchy and tasted nice. It had pepper, garlic, cream and cheese. The mayo served along with it was an icing on the cake. ✌

• Minty mutton croquettes - It was a refined form of mutton chop. I really liked it. It was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Tasted amazing and would highly recommend on this one.  ✌ ✌

• Loochi with Cholar Dal and Dhokha Paneer Dalna - It was superb. The loochi was hot and so was the gravy items. I would personally recommend you to try on this one. However, the oil can be curtailed down on loochi's. 

• Pan seared Illish Darne with English Mustard Cream - It was amazing. If you are okay with bones, then i would recommend you to order on this one. Tasted amazing with the rice served along.

• Gondhoraj Caramel Custard - I personally felt the presentation can be improved a bit. However, the taste was really good. It was a sweet finishing to the course meal. 
=====
Pros: 

• Bengali Fusion Food. One of it's kind.
• Ambiance is a blend of Modern exteriors with Nostalgic memories of Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen.
• Really good hospitality.
• Great food presentation. 

Cons:
• I personally found the seating arrangement to be a bit tight. It was a bit crampy.
=====
Meal for two: 500-1500 approximate
=====
Summary:

Food quality 3.8/5
Food quantity 3.4/5
Food presentation 3.8/5
Hospitality 3.8/5
Ambiance 3.6/5
Taste 3.8/5
Hygiene 3.7/5
=====
Conclusion: I would surely try coming back again. It was a very different experience. I would specially thank the owner Mr. Ranjan to courteously explain us and help us with great food to satiate our palate. ❤

It was a busy weekday afternoon and I was sitting at a client's reception when I noticed a mail in my mailbox. It was from Zomato for the CFC foodies event meet and I was invited at Saptapadi for the event. Wow! It always feels good to be a part of something like this.

The restaurant is located in purna das road just beside Tero Parbon. This also has a small earlier branch near baghajatin. This new one is quite spacious, impressive decor and layout. The theme is made of legendary Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen movie stills. We enjoyed and had a great time with all foodies out there and the owner Ranjan da was a warm host with his inputs on recipes and his innovative menus. The menu is quite unique, and has been a playhouse for the chef to produce delicious fusions like ilish chilli toast and minty mutton croquettes. The refreshing drink of lichi lonkar sherbet is a must try. The main dish had luchi, narkel dal, dhoka- all of which were good in taste. The llish darne was an averave tasting dish and so was the paella for me. The ending was with gondhoraj caramel custard which was again quite unique. My vote goes to the Mutton Croquettes, a must try starter dish.

Overall, a good experience to carry with. It is there to offer a good challenge and stay in the game.

The name's been doing the popular rounds for some time now. Decided to fit in somehow, better today than never! Reached quite early for a small dinner, 7:30 p.m. We were the only guests in the restaurant but that did not stop these guys from providing us with services as they would have done for a full house. The decor needs a special mention, it is on the movie, Saptapadi. The owner, Ranjan was present and he made us feel at home! Full points there!
For the food, we opted for a litchi-lonka drink. It tasted divine. Husband was cravings luchis, so we ordered some luchis and their house special mutton. The mutton was outstanding, soft, gravy, tanginess, sweetness, all perfect! It was delicious, was blown away by their taste!
They had a special offer, offered mocktails of their choice for free if you upload your meal pics on Zomato! and voila! my gondhoraj cha drink was served..:) 
For dessert, we opted for the Gandharaj Caramel Custard, presentation was not to my liking because of the plate but the owner explained the reason behind it. The taste was spot on, no mistakes there.
The dishes are reasonable priced, ambience is excellent, location is convenient, run and owned by an ex-chef himself! what more could one ask for! We left with big grins plastered across our faces! :)

P.S. Eagerly waiting for your Salt lake venture Ranjan!! :D

Select members of our rocking Facebook food group Calcutta Foodies Club were invited to this Zomato meet-up exclusively for the group. The venue was Saptapadi. There was a special menu created for the occasion and it had two items from the upcoming Hilsa Festival for preview.

Saptapadi is a fusion Bengali cuisine restaurant set up by Ranjan Biswas who has a long experience of working in five-star hotels including Taj group and ITC Sonar. Ranjan is known for his knack of constantly experimenting in the kitchen to create innovative and out-of-the-box fusion dishes out of well-known Bengali preparations.

Ranjan was talking to us about starting his restaurant, why he chose that name and creating various fusion dishes including those we ate. It was an enlightening interaction which went on through our eating! 

The restaurant has a nice décor blending modernity with old fashionedness. There is vintage wood art, old furniture and framed pictures of Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen- the legends of Bengali cinema- one of whose famous films has lent its name to the restaurant. I even saw a well-known book on Suchitra displayed on a rack next to a table!The tumblers are made of burnt clay and there are ‘kunjos’ (Large and tall claypots to store water) replacing jugs on the table. Ranjan informed that other than mixing Bengali nostalgia around Uttam-Suchitra films with eating, all his ‘thalis’ have seven items each, thus underscoring the name of the restaurant (‘Saptapadi’ literally means a platter of seven food items). 

The welcome drink was Lichu Lankar Shorbot (A drink with lichi juice infused with green chilli). I wish it was a little more of chilli and less sweet.

We started off with Illish Chilli Toast. It was deboned hilsa mixed with cream, cheese, pepper and garlic and baked, then placed on a thinly cut piece of a slice of toasted brown bread. It was scrumptious! The accompanying chilli mayo dip was finger-licking too! A delightful innovation, I must say.

Minty Mutton Croquette came next….and it stole my heart in no time! Thin, crunchy crust of bread crumb encasing masterly spiced mutton mince created pure ecstasy for me! It’s what we Bengalis called ‘Mutton chop’ and I couldn’t remember when I last had it as good! But there was more to it. It had a special ingredient and Ranjan had told us before that we would have to guess it as we eat the croquette. As all of us failed, he revealed that it was banana stem (‘Thor’ in Bengali) de-fibred, grated and boiled with milk to seamlessly blend with mutton mince. It surely helped create a cutting edge of taste and what a wonderful experiment!

The main course had luchi, chholar dal, Dhoka Paneer Dalna, Pan-seared Illish Darne with English Mustard Cream Sauce and Lemongrass Chingri Paella. The luchis looked flawless- fluffy, light-coloured with not a single brown spot and tasted as good. They went well with the subtle, wholesome chholar dal mixed with green pea and beans among other things. The Dhoka Paneer Dalna (Crushed chickpea dal made into quadrangles in the shape of barfi cooked in a thick, lightly spiced gravy) was good too. 

The Illish darne was average, though the hilsa fish was of good quality and the paella tasted nice too. I just wish the paella had more shrimps.

The dessert was Gondhoraj Caramel Custard. It was caramel custard with a subtle flavour of gondhoraj lemon (There was a slice of it on the top). I am fond of caramel custard and this one was the only disappointment for me. It was not well-made and tasted much sweeter than expected.

Overall, a hearty meal! A visit to Saptapadi is recommended. To me, this is a better Bengali cuisine restaurant in the city in my limited experience of restaurants of this cuisine.

A good time to visit it will be the ongoing Hilsa Festival which opened on 24th July and will go on till 14th August. There is a a-la-carte menu and cost per couple should be around Rs 800 (without taxes).

I was pretty excited to see the invitation email from Zomato to the CFC Member’s Meet in Saptapadi restaurant to preview their Hilsa Festival menu along with their fusion Bengali cuisine.

The restaurant opened about four months back in Purna Das road, next to another Bengali restaurant, “Tero Parbon”. If you enter Purna Das road from Golpark the restaurant will be on the right hand side just after Heilen Cross Diagnostics Centre. There is no dedicated parking for the restaurant. However, you can legally park your car on the other side of the road. The restaurant is on the first floor and the entrance is through a parking lot. So it might be little confusing to find the gate of the restaurant because there is, as such, no restaurant entrance at the street level.

As I entered the restaurant pushing its glass door I noticed the Uttamkumar-Suchitra Sen themed minimalistic yet chic interiors complete with wooden artwork and cozy chairs with retro movie pictures in the backrest. The tables were ready with traditional Bengali mats, earth colored plates and glasses. There were two earthen pots filled with drinking water on the table too. The steel cutleries, however, were little off-style from the other items of the table. There was a wall-to-wall large photo print from the classic movie “Saptapadi” along with the head assembly of a real motorcycle.

A refreshing drink called “Lichu-Lankar Sorbot” was served as the welcome beverage. The drink looked like any regular lychee based drink. But as soon as I took the first sip, the capsaicinoids of the chilies kicked in. It was interestingly complex, I would say and equally tough to make because a slight increase in the amount of chilli would override the subtle taste of the lychee and that would end the ecstasy instantly.

Chef Ranjan Biswas, after working in many restaurants all over India including Taj and Hyatt groups of hotels, opened Saptapadi to serve traditional Bengali dishes with a Western twist and some classic continental recipes fused with Bengali delicacies.

The first dish served was “Illish Chilli Toast” – a classic snack subcontinentalized with a paste of de-boned Hilsa along with processed cheese and green chillis on brown bread. It was served with a dip and the whole combo tasted surprisingly good.

While we were enjoying the starter, Ranjan was telling us how he started creating those delicious fusions of traditional Bengali dishes and Western style of cooking or ingredients. Starting from “Crispy Chilli Mourala” to “Cappuccino Mutton Kasha” and from “Illish Steak” “Ice cream Patisapta”… his list was endless.

 Meanwhile the second starter was served - “Minty Mutton Croquettes”. It was awesome; all of us loved it with a dip of thick mustard sauce (Kasundi). Ranjan challenged us to identify the ingredients of the dish other than mutton. Honestly, we could not guess the right answer and we were surprised when he revealed that the other thing was nothing but good ol’ banana stem (thor) mashed and boiled with milk! There was no way to guess that just by eating the croquettes. “It’s the fiber of the banana stem which has got the similar texture of the mutton and that creates the seamless concoction”, Ranjan explained.

Next were the traditional Bengali combo of “Loochi” and “Chholar Daal” with a new dish, “Dhoka-Paneer Dalna”. I was never a chholar daal lover but this time I liked it because the Chef created a perfect balance between the sweetness and the spiciness in the daal. The dhoka was good too, soft with subtle aroma of asafetida.

We all assumed that the name of the restaurant originated from the movie “Saptapadi”. Well, that may be one of the reasons but that’s not all. Ranjan told us that his menu had seven (“Sapta” in Sanskrit) courses of dishes and his Thalis had seven items (“Pada” in Sanskrit), and thus the name Sapta-Padi. Pretty soon, we realized that our dinner menu of that evening had seven items too! I was thinking about the movie Se7en and the seven deadly sins!

The main attraction of the dinner was “Pan-seared Illish Darne with English Mustard Crème Sauce” and served with “Lemongrass Chingri Paella”. The Illish was a bit over-fried and that somewhat lessened its flavor. The Paella (A Valencian/Spanish rice dish) was tasty and the overall plating combination of the fish, paella and sauce was inviting.

Ranjan informed us about the Illish Festival in Saptapadi which would start from 24th July and run till 14th of August.

The last and seventh dish was the “Gondgoraj Caramel Custard”. A happy collision between the caramel flavor and the smell of kaffir lime. It was delightful to look at and flavorful when tasted. I would not have minded a second helping of it.

Saptapadi is a promising new restaurant with a lot to offer. There are research and time consuming experiments behind every dish served. But most importantly, Ranjan has invested his passion and dreams in this restaurant. If you come to Saptapadi, he will take you to an enjoyable gastronomic journey. I am sure you would love it and wish the journey to be endless and sing along “Ei poth Jodi na shesh hoye…”

I went to Saptapadi in Baghajatin more couple of month ago, I really enjoyed the food there. So this outlet is in my bookmark since then.

I finally tried their dishes via home delivery today in lunch.

Basmati Rice-- Very good, hot.
Aamer chutni-- Also good, mango was juicy and well cooked. Sweetness level was perfect.
Doi Rui--- Another excellent dish.. I liked a lot...

They sent free papad along with chutni....

Lichi chilli (somehow sounds similar..Doesn't it )welcome drink, mutton croquet, ilish paste on strips of toast, luchi, dhokar dalna, prawn paella and ilish darne with mustard sauce and cream... what could be more delightful gastronomically? It was a wonderful dinner. The decor perfect and the food delicious - be that quintessential Bengali food or a twist to the same. A must try. And here is my take on this cosy restaurant.

Sometimes the juxtaposition of east and west can create wonders- the fusion cuisine of Saptapadi establishes how true these words are. I was invited by Zomato and CFC for a food meetup that was held in this restaurant. This outlet at Hindusthan park opened doors some four months ago and is a cosy property beautifully decked up. The name "Saptapadi" reminds us of the blockbuster by the immortal uttam-suchitra "juti", besides "Sapta"means seven which is the exact number of items in their thalis.
First we were served the welcome drink "Lichu-Lonka Sobot", a sweet tangy concoction that instantly enlivened the mood.
Next was the "star of the evening" Illish Chilli Toast.. crisp brown bread slices topped with illish paste with a chilli mayo dip- an absolute delight i must say.
Minty mutton croquettes was a blend of minced mutton and mocha, this is sure to melt in yr mouth.
The "bong"  in me was absolutely overjoyed by the "fulko" luchi which was a sheer joy to behold., Served with cholar dal and dhoka paneer dalna.
The main course was a beautifully presented Pan-Seared Illish Darne withEnglish Mustard Cream Sauce served with Lemon Grass Chingri Paella. This was deliciously delightful!!
As dessert there was Gondhoraj Caramel Custard, a plateful  of heavenly delight.
A big thanks to

I was invited to attend the Zomato meet at Saptapadi along with the members of Calcutta Foodies Club! A perfect evening; over the top Bong Adda over Kolkata's food culture and then there was the effect of Uttam Suchitra at Saptapadi Restaurant which actually acted like positive catalyst and not to mention an amazing spread of Bengali Fusion Food! 
We were served with a Lichi Lanka Sherbet followed by  Ilish Chili Toast and Minty Mutton Croquettes (both are actually must try if you ask me) and as main course there were Luchi , Dal, Dhokar Dalna as typical traditional bong food and I found  Pan seaard Ilish Darne with English mustard cream sauce and Lemon Grass Chingri Paella quite good. Gandhoraj Caramel Custard was subtle in flavour and use of Gandhoraj turned the dessert into a refreshing delicacy. 
As the name suggest Saptapadi is loaded with the memory of quintessential Bong star Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen and naturally the decor is well coordinated with the theme which I found good. Their forte is Fusion bong food which I found quite impressive and worth trying for!

Ilish chilly toast- the name itself was enough to blow our mind off... But, when it arrived, it was basically slices of toast with ilish paste on top with cheese. And so, the journey started with our venture in Saptapadi Restaurant - thanks to Zomato ... The spread was arranged for selected Calcutta Foodies Club members (chosen by Zomato based on the zomato user ranking) and it was basically a sneak peek in their upcoming menu. Great food, cute place and a jovial and helpful Ranjan da... Though most of the members met for the first time (in the real world), it seemed like they're long lost brothers and brother's sisters from the kumbh mela... 

Coming back to food, the lichu-lanka sherbet was good, but was more for the weak hearted and IMHO probably needed a bit more punch. Mutton croquet was fine- in fact one of the best items on the menu card.... As the owner told us, boiled thor was mixed with mutton keema to give the needed crunch. I love luchi- dal and no complaint of that part. The last item was Ilish Darne with prawn paella. Though a bit on the dry side,paella was pretty good, but ilish was the ok-ish type. The gandharaj caramel custard was fine and next time once I go, this will be on my list. 

Overall, some new dishes, great hospitality and pretty impressive decor. Definitely recommended...

Fusion Bengali food. Yes, that is the idea of this new comer in Purnadas Road area. "Saptapadi" is a very famous Bengali Movie & you'll definitely get that classic touch all over the restaurant. The owner Ranjan's idea is basically to give a international touch with our very "Bangaliana". The decor, food everything is carrying that touch.. We had Lichu Lanka Sarbat, then Ilish(Hilsha fish) chilli toast and Minty Mutton Croquettes as starter.. I must say, both are very tasty and innovative for my choice. Then the traditional Luchi, Navratan Daal and Dhojar Dalna.. And in the main course we had Pan Seared Ilish Darne with Lemon Grass Chingri (Shrimp) Paella.. And lastly for our sweet tooth we had Gondhoraj Caramel Custard.. All the food has it's own delicacy and creative touch. Over all, Saptapadi is a mystery which you have to solve through your taste buds..

Thanks to Zomato team to arrange zomato cfc food meet up at Saptapadi. This place is a gastronomical delight. The owner who is also an expert chef has made very good fusion food with bengali cuisine as the base. We tasted the hilsha toast which was something very unique. Then there was Hilsa and prawn rice which was also very good. The desert was also unique . This place is a must visit for food lovers .

"Ei path jodi na ses hoy tobe kamon hoto tumi boloto".. this song only can describe the theme of the restaurant. An endless journey of bengali food. One of the best bengali food i have tasted ever. This place is located near golpark. One of the theme restaurant that serve mouth watering bengali cuisin in town,based on the film 'Saptapadi'. From every corner you can get that Uttam-Suchitra feel. Entrance of this restaurant is pleasant.Location wise good,easy to locate if you come from golpark. Ambience is awesome. Now coming to the food...they have wide range of authentic bengali cuisin as well as fusion. We tried bengali fish thali which contains of vat/pulao,aluvaja,veg of the day i.e. sukto we got,dal,luchi,1 pc katla fish, 1 pc special fish,chatni,papad and misti doi along with my all time favourite baked daab chingri alaska and as recommended by the attendant we tried patisapta ice cream which was really awesome. Price is reasonable and the quantity is adequate.
Location- 1 out of 1
Ambience - 1 out of 1
Food quality and quantity - 1 out of 1
Price - 1 out of 1

This place is very easy to locate. It's a walking distance of 5 minutes from golpark. This is "the" place for true bengalis. It serves authentic bengali food with light bengali oldies playing inthe background. The ambience is excellent and so were the staffs. I had ordered veg thali and I must appreciate each and every detailing. Every dish was noteworthy. The special fish thali is a heaven for fish lovers. So all in all visit this place on an afternoon and enjoy bangali khabar to your heart's content!

Well-decorated and pleasantly styled with framed photographs of Uttam & Suchitra, the hallmark of this place is the warm reception and courteous hosting of the staff. There are two menus...one completely for Bengali cuisine and the other for Bengali fusion food. We opted for the fusion section. For starters we had green mango sherbet with stuffed chicken lollipops. The latter are originally stuffed with prawns but since two members out of three at our table were not prawn people we asked them to serve us the lollipops with a chicken filling. A plate contains three pieces but it is very satisfying. For main course we had Kancha Lonka Pesto Chicken which came with a small portion of potato salad and 6 pieces of thin paratha, stuffed chicken breast with tomato tulsi coulis served with rice and an ilish sizzler. Everything tasted great and even though we were stuffed we opted for desserts. The vanilla ice cream stuffed patishapta was a treat! But the gondhoraj caramel custard was a bit of a let down. All in all it was a lovely meal considering the pocket-pinch.

I would like to keep my review short and sweet - Saptapadi is one of the best restaurants serving Bengali food in Kolkata. Now I am writing this review sitting in Toronto and I really wish I can get the dishes of same delicacy here. I have been to the restaurants both at Purna Das road and Baghajatin quite a number of times (more to the Baghajatin outlet as that's nearer to my house) with my family and the food is just awesome.

Be it Veg or Non- veg, both are equally delicious. The hit dish for me is - Ilish bhapa...

This restaurant is surely one of the finest bengali cuisine restaurants in kolkata. Situated just besides much older and renowned Tero parbon, saw this many times during passing through purna das road but never had the opportunity to enter it. Finally decided to give it a try so ordered for home delivery via swiggy. Food arrived after 1 hour. Ordered steamed rice, sukto, muri fish stick, mochar chop, muger dal, chanar dalna, vetki paturi, vapa murgir paturi. All the items were absolutely delightful, extremely tasty. the fish and chicken used were fresh so it made the dishes more delectable. can't comment on ambiance and service but food quality and quantity are top notch. very pocket friendly, per head cost was rs 500. I will recommend this restaurant to all the bengali food lovers and certainly visit it in future to try the other fusion items they serve.

I took my mother out for giving her a birthday treat and I have no qualms saying that I made a awesome choice. The service and the hospitality was outstanding and the way the people communicate ...my mother felt entirely at home. 2 thumbs up for that. As per the food is concerned. ....their speciality chicken, boneless ilish bhape were outstanding.We also tried out the muri fish starter and paneer dhoka combo and they were fab too. If you are taking out any elderly person in ur family...this is the place to go .The ambience is old school and sensuously appeals to the senses. Thanks to team Saptapadi for making it so special for my mother. See you soon.

Was recommended the place by my bengali in laws, and having tasted exquisite bengali food over the last decade and a half, I can truly say take that hour from your life and come here. Brilliant food and amazing combinations that leave nothing sacred.  Between us we tried about 6 dishes, each better than the other. An afternoon well spent.

Was longing to visit this restaurant for long, finally did tonight and the experience was overwhelming. 
First starting with the location, very easy to locate if you are coming from golpark.
As we entered, the ambience was very pleasing and welcoming. Cleanliness and neatness was something that attracted. Sitting arrangements are quite wide.
They have wide range of authentic bengali foods in the menu and also some bengali fusion foods. We ordered 
-Veg Thali- which had two luchis, polao, dhokar dalna, potol r dorma, mugh dal, aloo bhaja, chatni, papad, misti doi
-Non Veg Thali- Two luchis, polao, mugh dal, aloo bhaja, aloo potol r dalna, katla mach r jhol, papda jhal, chutney, misti doi
-Polao and Chitol Mach
-Chicken Sizzler (this one is out of the menu. It was made on my request. And it was exceptionally well made)
All the bengali dishes were made to utmost perfection. You cant complaint about a single thing about the food. Taste will actually feed your bengali soul. The food actually makes people remember about how bengali food actually tastes. It really will bless your bengali taste buds. In short "Food for the bengali soul".
The ambience is so good that it reminds of the golden days of bengali cinema. With the decoration made by the posters and candid photos of legendary Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen, and music of good old bengali cineams. From the serving of water from matir kolshi, to the music, everything has a pure bengali touch to it. An awesome experience for us. The service of the people here are overwhelming.. always there to help you. 
An authentic bengali experience you will never forget.

Found the restaurant on a random search on zomato. It is the perfect place to dine out with family and elderly people. The Uttam-Suchitra themed decor will definitely grab their attention. The decoration has been done very thoughtfully. I particularly liked their water jars styled like 'matir kujo'. 
Location - Excellent. Just adjacent to Tero Parbon.

Service- Excellent. The staffs are extremely cordial and well behaved. Always up on their feet to serve customers. 

Food- Each item we had ordered tasted so perfect. Since they have a fusion menu as well we ordered the starters from fusion ones - Muri fish sticks, crispy chilly mourola and murgi chingri lollypops. Starters tasted so good that we did not feel like stopping. For main course we had ordered luchi, alurdom followed by kacha lonka murgi, saptapadi abhinaba mutton, bhapa ilish and chitol muitha paired with misti polau and steamed rice. Among fusion food we ordered one prawn thermidore. Each item tasted exotic and flavourful.  For ending notes was gondhoraj caramel custurd which also requres an applause. 

Price- Reasonable.

Would like to visit again to taste their other delicacies.

There is a saying first impression is the last impression. The ambience and hospitality of the restaurant won over a pure Bengali heart.
The dish was pretty awesome and the prompt service of the restaurant crew was just an icing over a cake.
Would like this visit again. Keep up the good work

Just loved their fusion foods. We were pretty confused while placing the order as we wanted to taste everything reading the menu. But unfortunately that was not possible, so we ordered some and decided to come back some other day if our taste buds get satisfied. 

Would definitely recommend this place if someone loves fusion foods. 

Must try Chingri chicken lollipop, Crispy chilli mourala, Lichu lonka sarbat and Ice cream patisapta. 

I am deducting 0.5 for the entrance of the restaurant. You have to enter through a garage and that is only negative point that I noticed.

Hello people! Had been really busy all the while, and coping up with travelling to and fro cities and all the work here and there, I could not manage much time to really sit back and write reviews and now I have plenty of reviews piled up in my list. So today its turn for this Bangliana to be showed up and write for Saptapadi! 

My visit to this ethnic Bengali restuarant dates back to the eve of Bengali New Year this year, that is on 13th April, a day before Bengali New Year. My parents not being here in the city, and me being completely alone, was missing the bengali delicacies on this day. I took to Zomato to search for the best of restaurants serving Bengali cuisine. I chose Saptapadi as it made me interested quite a lot by the name that they have used. So, I visited there with a friend of mine. 
Location might be a little difficult to find. It is located in Purna Das Road near Hindustan Park. I blindly followed the Google Maps to reach here as I was in an Ola cab driving us to the place. On reaching the place, I found Saptapadi and Tero Parbon (which is another Bengali restaurant) just adjacent to each other, but since I had already made up my mind to visit Saptapadi, I preferred sticking to it. 

The entrance is quite simple. A staircase leads you to the restaurant. You can find a wooden statue at the mid staircase, probably welcoming you to their place. 😃 The entrance has a glass door, with a red color hookah unit by the side.

The restaurant had lovely decor. Mostly wooden and varnished. The light wooden color of the entire place and the dark brown chocolate wood color furniture (the tables and the chairs) in contrast made the decor look aesthetic. There were wooden shelves having various showpieces. On the walls, there were frames having portraits of the yeater year veteran actors and actresses of the Bengali Film Industry, which added to the Bengali feel. The soft Bengali music and its melody also added to the feel of being in a Bengali themed place, indeed. Everything was made to look aristrocratic. Even the wash basin was sculpted in the shape of a metal Kadhai. Overall the decor was very pleasing and perfectly in theme.
The waiters were pretty welcoming. As soon as we took a table, they came up with the menu and with regular drinking water. The water was served in an earthen pot, and earthen glasses to gave the water, adding to the decor and theme again. 

What we had ordered - 
1. Pora Aam er Sarbat - it was a raw mango drink. As it was quite warm and sunny outside, and raw mangoes being the celebrity item for such a day as eve of Poila Boishak, I decided to order that as a cooler and drink. It was bright green in color. Looked attractive. Tasted really good and was refreshing for sure.
2. Bhapa Murgi r Paturi - So this was a dish I ardently wanted to try. Because I had never had such a dish like steamed chicken in a banana leaf (what I had had was same thing in Ilish fish). I ordered a plate of this. Two such pieces were served, the steamed chicken cakes wrapped in banana leaf and stuck with a toothpick. You have to open the banana leaf packaging in order to have it. It was served with kasundi (mustard sauce). I simply loved it as it was amazing in taste. Loved trying the dish.
3. The Main Course - what we had ordered for main course was plain rice ( bhaat), Beguni, a bowl of dal, Aaloor Dom, and Kosha Mangsho. 
It was such a bliss to have such a perfect Bengali lunch. 
The rice grains were long and scented, perfectly cooked, and tender. 
The Beguni was great in taste, and did not have that excess oil kind of feel which made it even more better. 
The Dal was decent enough, tasted good.  
The Aaloo r Dom was a gem. It tasted really well. Loved every bit of it. Quite well balanced in its spiciness and typical Dom taste. 
The Kosha Mangsho was a spicy dish, the mutton pieces very well cooked and the gravy was tasted awesome with rice.
4. MistiMukh time - Its the time for desserts and to fulfill our sweet tooth cravings. So for desserts we had ordered the famous Mishti Doi of Kolkata. It was served in a bowl, and tasted well enough and well-balanced in the sweetness. Usual one.
Next, we had ordered for an IceCream Patishapta as the name and concept intrigued me to take it. I loved this dessert dish but I did not like the strawberry sauce that was served with it. (I personally do not like strawberry flavour, because it makes anything too sweet. Other people may find it lovely for sure). 

The prices are little high, as kinds of taxes are included, which makes the bill go high.
We clicked lots of pictures and selfies. Completely enjoyed our Bengali lunch. Would visit the place whenever I have the Bengali food cravings.

Was on my way to La Maison, when I spotted this restaurant, right beside Tero Parbon on Purna Das Road. Bengali Fusion food was what caught my eye. Plus, it has a lot of good reviews on Zomato. The restaurant celebrates the hit onscreen pair Uttam Suchitra and is named after one of their movies, Saptapadi. 

I checked out the menu before entering the restaurant and was quite fascinated with what they had to offer. However, on entering I was handed over a different menu card with very few dishes. Ordered steamed rice, aloo posto and Kacha Lonka Chicken. Pretty normal food, is it too hyped? Or did I end up ordering the wrong dishes? Might have to give it another try.

some of foods frm the buffet was missed by them some how (miss management)...only appetizers (moori fish stick,ranga aloo croquette was interesting concept and tasted unique....beguni was not served..i also like the chicken nuggets preparation...) wellcome drinks are little bit good...
In main course pulao was not up to the mark..
lanka murgi and kochi pathar jhol absolutely hopeless...
In fish item i like both chitol macher muitha nd betki grihoprobesh(bhetki paturi)....
Payesh was watery,misti dahi was frm mother dairy...

This was my 3rd time here. We were greeted warmly and they helped us to select the menu as well as the drinks. It was a great suggestion and we ended up having a great dinner. The best part about this restaurant is that they are constantly evolving in terms of their food, flavour profile and service. It's always an exciting place to dine in as there is chance that you might taste something that is amazing and also probably for the first time.

Visited this place after hearing about if from alot of friends. Being very fond of bengalo food this was a must visit. The welcome was great . The service people were polite and helpful. Had ordered for a special fish thali only to taste the hilsa and a non veg thali. It was great and everything was cooked well. The quantity of the portions were a little less but that got covered for the taste. Would go there again amd try the daab chingri. Looked good on the table next to us. Met the owner a very humble person. Must visit for bengali food lovers......

Awesome ambiance , small and cozy restaurant and the most best part is "lift" very convenient for elderly people.
Ordered for a fish head ( katla macher matha) over phone as it was my hubby's birthday and it was ready for us within an hour before we arrived. We ordered for special fish thali..comprising of rice luchi beguni alu jhuri dal sukto betki paturi ilish and chingri...chatni papad and misti doi... Apart from this we also ordered alur dum , posto piyaji and chitol muthya all were great in taste and quantity was fair...
Last but not the least we also ordered ice cream pati sapta but sumhow concept was good but I didn't like its outter wrap taste..

Had recently visited with my aged parents and ten year old daughter to celebrate my parent's 46th anniversary. Wonderful overall experience. Interior decoration is in sync with the name with all the black & white pics of the legendary matinee idols. Made my parents nostalgic. Menu was innovative (fusion part) as well as traditional. Quantity sufficient and taste was perfect. Specially touched by the attentive & courteous service and apt suggestions regarding what to order. They really know how to make their customers feel special right from suggesting starters, patient serving making allowance for aged & kids, clicking snaps for them and offering complimentary desert to the anniversary couple. Must say will go back for their hospitality and to once again taste the awesome "Bouthakuranir Haater Bora" and " Icecream Patisapta"

'Bangaliana' in it's true sense. One can feel it from the entrance. As you step up the stairs, the framed pictures from Bengals ever favourite movie 'Saptapadi' will catch your attention. That's the theme of the restaurant.
Ambience is cool. Typical aroma of Bengali cuisine superadded by gondhoraj lemon aroma will fascinate you. Soft romantic background music from the evergreen era of Bengali cinema is the additional charm factor particularly for our previous generation.
Coming to the food. 
They have two menu cards- one for traditional Bengali food, another for fusion food. It is better to order from both.

GONDORAJ CHA ER SORBOT: Unique item. Perfect blend of tea flavour with gondhoraj lemon. Cool and refreshing.

MURI FISH STICK: Another innovative fusion dish. Soft and tasty fish with some herbs is covered by crunchy coating. Use of puffed rice had increased its crunchiness. Have it with some kasundi and ketchup dips, we will be delighted.

RICE and SHUKTO: shukto contained all the necessary ingredients in perfect combination. Balance of spice and bitter is well maintained.

BIPASA KOI: Too spicy and oily. Taste was not impressive.

ICE CREAM PATISAPTA: The concept of ice cream stuffing inside a Patisapta is quite interesting. On bitting the mildly sweet Patisapta you will feel the ice cream part. Personal favourite. As the sweetness is mild people who don't have sweet tooth may also enjoy it.

ELAICHI FLAVOURED AMSOTTO CARAMEL CUSTARD: This item disappointed me. I expected the tempting flavour of Elaichi which was missing. The amsotto did not blend with custard.

Overall nice experience. Staffs are helpful. Will definitely visit again to taste other dishes.

We went to Saptapadi for an early Mother's Day lunch. I was surprised to find the place almost empty; I realized later that we'd beat the lunch crowd by half an hour or so, so we had the restaurant practically to ourselves. 

The interior is cozy but not cluttered, full of modern furniture and traditional Bengali earthenware. Under that iconic photograph of Uttam and Suchitra from Saptapadi has been mounted the headlamp and handlebars from an old-ish looking motorbike. The ambience is soothing, and the staff friendly and helpful.

It was a hot day (let's face it, they're all hot days), so we ordered beverages first. I opted for the gondhoraj cha-er shorbot, which turned out to be very refreshing and a great twist on the usual lemon iced tea. After that, I decided to try the kancha aam-er shorbot, which was a little disappointing: even though green mangoes are currently in season, the drink was clearly made from a mix.

Now for the food. Some of our party were not exactly happy with the idea of Bengali fusion food, and went for mutton kosha and pulao. This was what arrived first, and it was really good. The puloa was light and tasty and everything I like in a pulao, and the chef had added coriander to the mutton, something I have not encountered before and enjoyed immensely.

I had ordered the Bengal Gremolata Crusted Kolkata Bhetki, and chose herb rice instead of the spaghetti al aglio it is usually served with. The fish also came with a sweet sauce and the house salad (our usual piyaj, shosha and tomato, but with olives, and drizzled in mustard oil). And yes, the bhetki was amazing, and worked beautifully with the sauce, made out of kasundi and vinaigrette. We tried eating the bhetki machh-er paturi with that sauce as well, and the combination worked brilliantly.

And now for dessert. While the jasmine tea mishti doi sounded really tempting, the gandharaj caramel custard won out. We also got an ice cream patishapta, and a plain mishti doi. The unconventional dessert choices were a triumph, and the good old mishti doi was very, very good. We mixed a bit of the syrup from the custard with both the patishapta and the mishti doi, and didn't regret it either time.

So yeah. Good food, nice place, courteous staff. I'm definitely going back to Saptapadi, because there are still way too many things I need to try out, including the ilish sizzler and the cappuccino mutton kasha.

Discovered the place through Zomato! And I really loved it. Lazy Sunday afternoon lunch on my recent trip to Kolkata turned into a superb authentic Bong lunch. While the family enjoyed Chingri, Kasa Mangsho, Bhetki, I was highly content with the veg dishes on offer like Cholar Dal, Sukto, Alu Bhaja and Dhoka Dalna. All with accompanied by Luchi, Paratha and Bath and washed down with Kancha Aam Shorbot. For desserts we concluded with some "Ice cream Patishapta"! All this in a quaint ambience with some background Bong music! 
Highly recommended place to all! Good food, great service and not too bad on the wallet either! We really hogged and for 3 people the bill was Rs. 1500!

Had a quite,  sumptuous meal at Saptapadi today ... true to it's name , the decor stands out from any other themed restaurants .... Pictures of Uttam kumar and Suchitra Sen, along with the subtle background music created an ambience of yester years .... 
Coming to the food , I had ilish chaoa paoa ,  aampora shorbot and rasun bhetki paturi with plain rice . It was a lot to demand an iilish in off-season  😛, but still the quality of food was good .... What's worth mentioning is the courteous and well behaviour of the staffs ... always smiling and enquiring umpteenth times if everything was ok or not ..... datz really sweet .... overall a good experience... 
P.s..... washroom needs a little more attention...😝

After hearing quite a bit about this relatively new Bengali restaurant, we decided to brave the heat on a weekend afternoon. The place is situated on Purna Das Road, right beside Tero Parbon, housed on the first floor of a building. As you climb up the stairs, a couple of framed pictures from the Uttam-Shuchitra starrer Saptapadi will catch your attention. That’s where it derives its name from.

The restaurant looks cool, is well set-up and exudes a traditional charm, thanks to its wooden décor. We started with an order of the Golden Fried Bhetki, Muri Fish Sticks and Chicken Chingri Lollypo, with a Knacha Aam er Shorbot and Cha Gondhoraj Shorbot. The fried Bhetki was good, a little over fried but the spice coating on the fillet tasted nice. The Muri Fish Sticks were quite unique, fish fingers coated with spices and puffed rice and went well with the Kashundi and ketchup. The Chicken and Chingri Lollypops were brilliant, with the gondhoraj lemon lending a superb flavor to the sticky coating sauce, also flavored with green chilies. The drinks were tasty too, the lemon and tea concoction in particular.

For mains, we ordered the Posto Pneyaji, Chitol Peti and Avinabo Mangsho with Steamed Rice. The Posto Pneyaji was good, round, flat cakes prepared with a mixture of khus-khus and onions. The Chitol Peti gravy was great, however the fish could have been a little fresher. But the star of the mains was the Avinabo Mangsho – four pieces of succulent and tasty mutton done in a dark, spicy gravy with a dominance of black pepper. It is a great side and should be definitely sampled while you are at Saptapadi.

We ended the meal with a Gondhoraj Caramel Custard, and it was a little disappointing – the flavor of the custard did not completely gel with the flavor of gondhoraj lemon. However, all said and done, I need to try the fusion fare this place has to offer. Overall, a nice lunch.

Went to eat here with my parents because I was craving Bengali food after a long stay in the US. Their food is excellent and the fusion menu is pleasantly innovative. The decor is impressive with many images of the Uttam-Suchitra pairing  worked into it and the music matches the decor. This seemed to delight my Mom as much as the patishapta with ice cream delighted Dad! Definitely will come back on my next visit to India.

SUPERB FUSION BONG FOOD

Date of Visit - 15th April 2016 (Little late with the review)

Firstly let me start with the name, SAPTAPADI is a 1961 Indian Bengali romantic drama film by Ajoy Kar, starring Suchitra Sen, Uttam Kumar, Chhabi Biswas and Chaya Debi. Regarded as the romantic blockbuster of the evergreen romantic pair of Bengali cinema.
You will find the decor and the theme reminding you of the classic.

Now lets come to the food.
We are Non-Resident Bongs and were in Kolkata for a couple of days.. So the 15th was our last day there and headed here as we had heard about this new place from a couple of Foodie friends.
Were actually looking for some appetisers only since it was around 6.30 pm..
But we were informed that they only have a Fixed Poila Boisak Special On table course meal.
So we decided to give it a try..
Moori fish stick & Posto Bata chicken coin came in which were fresh and surprisingly delicious then there was beguni and ranga aloo and yellow corn croquette.. which were good too.
Main Course
Luchi and Cholar dal was a HIt.. (have been a fan of Oh Calcutta for their Cholar Dal) but this was equally good. 
Dhokar dalna was succulent and tasted authentic (like my Mom cooks)
I did not like the Bhetkir Paturi , Half cooked and had been Defrosted fast.
Mangsho was superb especially with the misti pulao. (Pulao was Bang On Bong)
The Rosogolla was good but a bit cold.. Chatni was Good.
The Pre Packed Misti Doi was a total flop.

Service
Excellent in one word.
They make their customers feel comfortable.
Waiters are trained and know their task well.
A special mention for Ranjan Da.. who was a superb host and a Chef who knows his food well. 

Saptapadi has good food quality and taste with a fantastic decor which can seat around 50 ppl at once. Though being a Fusion food place the food tastes authentic .
Light on the pocket as compared to its competitors.
Great Location with ample parking.
Superb staff.
Go with Family and friends. Would suggest Pre-Booking.

Cheers

Named after the legendary film and Tarashankar Bandopadhyay novel by the same name, Saptapadi immediately arrested my interest because of its not-so-regular menu design. Modern Bengali restaurants have been doing an excellent job of tweaking and twisting the cuisine and creating path breaking textures and flavours with it. Saptapadi was fascinating to me, from the word go, for this particular reason. The 2 of us decided to have a simple meal (we didn't want to spend an exorbitant amount that day) and decided to order just the right quantity of food (usually that never happens, with me around). We had 4 luchis, 1 doi murgi, 1 dhoka paneer dalna and a roshogolla fricasse meal. On my request, they replaced the ajwaini paratha that accompanies the roshogolla gravy with herbed rice. The roshogolla meal was innovative for sure, but failed to impress with the quantity. Instead of 2 meagre pieces of roshogolla, they could easily come up with 3-4 along with a little more gravy at the side. The doi murgi was impressive, not too heavy or spicy, yet subtly appealing. The luchis weren't round and fluffy (they were flat, not a good thing) but tasted tender. The dhoka paneer dalna was delicious. Simply put, it's dhoka (fried lentil dumplings) put in a paneer gravy. I would much rather prefer them twisting the dish completely and actually stuffing the dhoka with some chhana or paneer- that would be awesome.  The herbed rice was a 4/5 but tasted more like jeera rice. Having tried out a lot of Persian, Mediterranean food in India and abroad, I know fr a fact that exotic herbs have a strong irresistible aroma- the rice that these guys served was good to taste, but didn't look 'herb'ed enough. The house mustard salad (onion, tomato tossed in mustard sauce) was a good addition to the roshogolla gondhoraj- herbed rice platter. We paid 824 INR for the two of us, for the food and 2 drinks (aam pora sharbat or raw mango sherbat and fresh lime soda). We decided to skip dessert, so had we had desserts then the bill (for two) would have probably come up to 1000 INR I'll definitely be going back to Saptapadi to try out the fish items as well as the modern Bengali fusion dishes. The service was great and the decor was apt too, in line with the theme. Overall, a great place for South Calcuttans to visit with family and friends for some authentic yet creative Bangla food.

Saptapadi Resturant Started on the year of 2011 at 51 Bidhan Sarani. Now they had 2 branches located in Kolkata.This is one of the good Restaurant in South Kolkata . SAPTAPADI is a Bengali speciality restaurant which serves finest Bengali Cuisine along with other. Will remind you of true Bengali traditonal food which we have lost over years...!
Great ambiance and it’s very innovative to start a themed restaurant. Theme of the restaurant is based on Uttam Kumar-Suchitra Sen’s movie Saptapadi. 

Saptapadi have certain Innovative dishes like Bhapa Murgir Paturi, Murgi Sabar Upore, Koe Macher Paturi, Kancha Lanka Murgi, Nolen Gurer Caramel Custard, and many others.Excellent quality of food maintained, taste of the food of each and every item is awesome . Grilled Ilish, Nolen Gurer Brownie are recommended dishes of Saptapadi. One should atleast visit this restaurant once in their life time.

One of the few themed resturants in the bengali crusine space, what sets it apart from the crowd is innovation. Tried the fusion dishes and they are truly a class apart. With bengali crusine restaurants sprouting all around offering largely the same dishes this kind of innovation was badly needed. The decor is also charming and pleasing to the eye. Overall a very good experience.

Location : 5 minutes From Golpark towards Nava Nalanda school and further. Adjacent to tero Parbon . One could also get down at Basandi devi college stoppage , cross the road and walk straight for two lane crossings. Then take a left from the Azad hind Dhaba turning.

Ambiance : The name " Saptapadi " stems from the a well known 1961 movie featuring Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen. They have tried to incorporate some pictures from the movie and decorations apt to the time frame. Wooden overtones everywhere presents quite a classy look. Even the songs playing around are from the movie !! 

Food : Went there on the day of " Poila Baisakh "  or the 1st day of the Bengali new year to take part in the poila baisakh festival. A buffet and only the buffet was the highlighting event showcasing the best of Bengali dishes . Even though I had booked a table beforehand anticipating the rush turns out they cancelled the bookings since the crowds were overflowing at the place. Hence had to wait 1.5 hours just to get in !! After achieving to secure a table in all the jam packed fury , one by one the starters started to roll in.

Starters consisted of :   Fish sticks , Chicken Coin , Aam pora shorbot , Beguni , Juri aloo bhaja . From the fish sticks to the coin everything was quite on point , very tasty. The aam pora shorbot was a favorite of mine and ordered it numerous times along with the fish sticks. 

Main course consisted of :  Rice , Pulao , Cholar Dal , Luchi , Kochi pathar jhol , paneer , kacha lonkar murgi , chitol macher muitha , bhetki grihoprabesh and aamshatto khejur r chutney . The numerous items meant one needed to really go for the extraordinary items because one would have to be a glutton to taste every dish and yet have room left over for repeat servings of their favorites !! The yellowish toned Pulao alongwith the kochi patha r Jhol was absolutely an A+ in my book . The patha had no fat at all and yet was juicy and aromatic. The bhetki grihoprabesh wrapped in kola pata ( Banana leaf) was another good preparation . Soft and almost kataless :P !     However the Luchi was cold and the Chitol macher muitha quite ordinary !! Both were major disappointments but for different reasons . The chutney another A+ in my book . 

Desserts consisted of : Rajbhog , Papad , Mishti Doi , Pantuar Payesh . Doi was a straight cup from the mother dairy brand !! Best of the lot was undoubtedly the Rajbhog . Don't know where they got it from but it was top notch. Excellent beyond Excellent . Payesh was somewhat runny on  the terracotta plates . Least favorite of the lot. 

Cost for 2 : 1400/- plus ( For the buffet)

Final Conclusion :  Horrible management !! the hugs crowds didn't help either . Couldn't even click pictures of the numerous dishes !! They couldn't manage the crowd at all which is why some people even had lunch at 3pm plus and were waiting for hours on end to get in !! Staff are very courteous and well dressed but slow . Their only saving grace  was the food ( well most of it ! ) . Even the 3 Voltas ACs were running like Air coolers !! Not a bad foodie experience but certainly a treacherous waiting disaster ..

Saptapadi is one of the first few themed restrartunt in the city. Visited Saptapadi on 14th April'16 to enjoy Poila Boishak set menu. An interesting themed restaurant showing classic scenes for a Bengali movie. The decor is interesting indeed but the place proved to be cramped for serving buffet menu and accommodating hoards of hungry souls during bust hours.

In beverages, we were offered Kacha Aam er Shorbot. The first serving was thick and delicious but second serving onward it was diluted with water. 

In starters, set menu offered Moori Fish Stick, Posto Bata Chicken Coin, Ranga Aloo Croquette, Beguni and Juri Aloo Bhaja. 

Moori Fish Stick was an innovation on cliche fish finger. Fish quality was good. Posto Bata Chicken void any posto flavour was more like chicken nuggets. Ranga Aloo Croquette was an interesting concept with crunchy coating outside.Beguni and Aloo Bhaja was same as we get anywhere else.Again first round was served hot but second round onward was served stone cold.

In main course menu had Basanti Pulao, Luchi, Cholar Dal, Kochi Pathar Jhol, Kacha Lonka Murgi, Chitol Macher Muitha, Bhetki Grihoprobesh and Aamsotto khejur cashew chutney.

Basanti Pulao, Luchi and Cholar Dal tasted same as it should be. Dal was watery and served on flat plate shows lack of common sense while planning the spread. No innovation here. Kochi Pathar Jhol was bland. Chitol Macher Muitha again no innovation but classic bengali cuisine and tasted wonderful. Bhetki Grihoprobesh is bhetki paturi steamed cooked inside banana leaf. In one of the paturi on my plate cellophane wrap was still there covering the fillet. So unhygienic to cook and no quality control. Taste wise again there was innovation only in name but not in preparation. Chutney had its zing.

In desserts had Misti Doi, Rajbhog and Pantuar Payesh. Doi was served in mother dairy cup. Rajbhog was soft but payesh was complete let down and watery. Again watery dish served on a flat.

Servers were unprofessional and not trained on how to serve. Dropping things all over place. Looked lost under pressure. Used plates were kept in front of entrance. Many big restaurants had faltered in past in an effort to serve people during peak cerebration hours like poila boishak and Saptapadi was no exception. They failed in accommodate huge footfall, quality was inconsistent, inside restaurant was stuffy and servers were messy. 

Buffet price was kept nominal at INR 599 plus taxes but if innovation is their catch phrase then should have retained the same all the way even during poila boishak menu.

Saptapadi Restaurant-Hindustan Park-  Whenever one thinks about Bengali Movies, the classic pair of Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen comes to our mind. We found a restaurant focused on the same Romantic Duo and their famous movie - Saptapadi.#Saptapadi #Krishnendu #Rina Brown.
Bengali movie মনে হলেই আমাদের চোখ বুজলেই যে ছবি টা ভেসে আসে সেটা হল উত্তম কুমার এবং সুচিত্রা সেন।অনবদ্য সেই জুটি যা আজ অবধি এত যুগ পরেও আমরা আর ফিরে পেলাম না।সেই জুটির থিম আজ হঠাৎ করে খুঁজে পেলাম পূর্ণ দাস রোড এলাকায় সপ্তাপদী রেস্তোরাঁ তে।পুরনো সেই দিন গুলো ফিরে এলো চোখের সামনে।#সপ্তপদী #Krishnendu #Rina brown।

Poila Baisakh’s special delicacy at Saptapadi

Poila Baisakh is a festival observed by the Bengali’s. Mainly it is celebrated in Bangladesh and India on the 14th of April and the 15th of April respectively but it is celebrated all over the globe where the bongs reside. It is also known as Bengali New Year and the Bengali Calendar starts with this day. This is auspiciously celebrated by the Bengali’s and some delicacies are must. But who really wants to cook at home on this very day. At the same time delicious Bengali food is must. So, the people move to some really good restaurant that prepares excellent food.

One of those excellent Bengali food makers is the restaurant of Saptapadi at Ganguly Bagan. Saptapadi is also one of the first movie theme restaurant concepts to launch in Kolkata, and they just recently opened their second outlet at Purna Das Road. They already had known for their generous portions and relatively affordable prices. They offer tremendously delicious and mouth watering foods. One must be elated when they can visit an awesome restaurant and celebrate the very first day of the year.

Most known it for their fusion Bengali cuisine, Saptapadi now gives you good reason to come by for Poila Baisakh lunch with their newly-launched special menu. Drop by any of their two outlets for a glorious lunch with your best friends or your family.

Poila Baisakh Starters that the restaurant would offer

The restaurant would welcome their eaters with the very favourite refreshment drink made with unripe mangoes which is called as “Kacha Aam er Shorbot “. Then they offered some delicious starters which are, Moori Fish Stick, Posto Bata Chicken coin, Ranga Aloo and Yellow Corn Nutty Croquette, Beguni and Juri aloo bhaja as they call it. The foods are as interesting as their name sounds.

Main Course of the Restaurant

The main course is even more delicious than the prior starter section. Items that will be present in the main course area are, Plain rice, Cholar Dal, Shukto, Dhoka Paneer Dalna, Chitol Machher Muittha, Bhetki Grihoprobesh, Kancha Lanka Murgi, Kochi Pathar Jhol, Pulao and Luchi too. Salad along with lemon and green chillies would be served along with these foods. These foods are really mouth watering. Shukto is an all time favourite food for the Bengali’s and Bengali delicacy without Kochi pathar jhol is a body without nerves.

This celebration is not a single day celebration. This would last for three whole days. The 14th of April, 15th of April and on 16th of April as well. Some of the special dishes that would be offered b y Saptapadi are Bhapa Ilish which is Steamed Hilsa which would cost Rs. 350 only, Sorse Ilish which is another favourite dish of the Bongs specially when the Hilsa is from the river Padma. This would cost Rupees 350 again. Chingri malai Kari is yum! It would be given away for just Rs. 300 and Daab Chingri as well for Rs. 465 only.

Desserts and the Final Curtain call

The dessert would contain Tomato Kaju and Aam Shotter Chatni at first. Aamlokir Aanchar would follow and then there would be two types of papad and sweet curd which is famous as misty doi, Pantuar payesh and rajbhog would finally end the show.

The whole course with the starters and the main course along with the desserts would cost just Rs. 599 in a package and taxes would be charged extra. This does not include the special dishes. That can be gained by paying some additional charges.

Foodies Pick

A feast for the eyes, the Kacha Aam er Shorbot was served with round slice of Gandhoraj lemon, its super refreshing in summers. It will cool you down instantly and helps in digesting.

To kickstart your meal, they serve plenty of fusion starters, served with different dips and mustard sauce. For a hearty starter, the Ranga Aloo and Yellow Corn Nutty Croquette will blow you away with its mild sweetness but yet subtlety spicy taste, a fusion blend of sweet potato and American corn flavoured with lemon grass.

The must-try item would be their Moori Fish Stick — fish goujonette marinated with exotic Bengali spices & herbs, coated and golden fried with Bengal’s favourite puffed rice .The servings were generous, and the crispy puffed rice bits add a surprising crunch factor. All the Moori Fish Stick was battered and prepared fresh on the spot! Bear in mind though, the smell of Moori Fish Stick will blanket your entire being, and you'll walk out an unfortunate stinko minko (and every bit worth it). You’d be really missing out if you didn't order one for the table.

Next amazing starter was Posto Bata Chicken Coin – chicken patties blended with Bengali spices, tempered poppy seed and seared in bare minimal oil. The chunks of chicken were fresh, flaky and smooth — perfect for a healthier option. The posto bata chicken coin, on the other hand, might require a temporary break from that diet of yours. The incredibly tender patty of chicken with a top layer of melt-in-your-mouth poppy seed paste will leave you helpless!

Go straight for the Bhetki Grihoprobesh – Kolkata Bhetki marinated with poppy seed and mustard and flavour with Gandhoraj zest with boiled green chilli paste and steamed in banana leaves. A thick filet of Bhetki that's succulent, flavoursome and tender, and served with traditional Bengali way. The Bhetki Grihoprobesh was, however, good enough on its own. Make sure you didn't miss this highly raved about dish.

The Kochi Pathar Jhol was one dish that would be a sin to miss, if you love meat. It's very simply done – seasoned with local herb and spices and "slow-cooked for an impeccable softness", as Chef Ranjan Biswas puts it – but more than delivers in taste. It's juicy, tender, flavourful and everything you could ever want in an authentic Kochi Pathar Jhol.

Of course, don't you dare leave without ordering a dessert - especially their irresistible Ice-cream Patisapta and Gandhoraj Caramel Custard! If a fusion dessert was what you crave, then their deliciously sweet and tangy Gandhoraj Caramel Custard should satisfy. Not surprisingly, their gandhoraj caramel custard was made from custard with gandhoraj lemon to achieve its rich flavour. If you have a really sweet tooth, the slightly crisp Ice-cream Patisapta was rightfully tempting. Ice-cream Patisapta – ice cream stuffed inside pancake would cascade down your throat like a thick waterfall till your last bites. YES, PLEASE!

Saptapadi owned by veteran Chef Ranjan, is a family-friendly restaurant that is well-loved for the superb Bengali cuisine. If you're in the Hindustan Park area, this is the perfect place for Poila Baisakh lunch / dinner with your loved ones. If that’s too far, the flagship outlet opposite of Ganguly Bagan post office might be a better option. Coming to Saptapadi and enjoying the delicacies is a must for the bongs. Be sure to make prior reservations to avoid disappointment of Poila Baisakh rush.

It is heartening to see a start up restaurant believing in their menu and executing it to perfection. Saptapadi not only has surprises, it also makes you feel romantic about the food you are having. The fusion menu is outstanding but the signature still lies in the authentic bengali food they make.

We made a trip to Saptapadi in celebration of Poila Boishak. It was a first trip to the place. And quite a memorable one.
Location : Very easily accessible. Parking of vehicle is a problem. The road being a narrow one, parking by the side of the road is a risk.
Ambience : Very tastefully done up. The very famous Bangla cinema of the same name is the theme of the restaurant. The use of terracota jugs, glasses and plates is appealing to the senses. A brass kadai as the wash basin leaves a mark on the mind.
Food : Very well prepared. People who like to watch over the oil consumption should be pleased. Some of the fusion food was very interesting.
Service : The attitude and service of the people is flattering, to say the least. I had a little conversation with the owner of the place, Ranjan. A thorough gentleman, Ranjan was wonderful to speak to. 
All in all, it was a lovely experience. 
Thank you Ranjan and your team.

This is a themed restaurant based on the 1961 movie featuring  Suchitra Sen and Uttam Kumar. It has stills from the movie on the walls. I really liked the cutlery they used. It was polished clay. Coming to the food , we had beguni, shukto, paturi, dhoka, luchi, chholar dal and kacha lonka murgi. I particularly liked the dal, which had fried coconut bits in it and the beguni was cooked with little batter , so that you get most of the vegetable. With rice we had the murgi which tasted good but was too oily. I myself resent Bengali food because of the way it's cooked and perhaps the places where I had them , it wasn't made well. But this place has totally changed my perception of Bengali food. It's a very rich cuisine and has a lot of flavours to offer. Saptapadi has a pretty uncooperative staff , who did not allow us to share food from the same thaali ! They even brought us another menu and suggested dishes to be taken in more amount so that we spend more. This was frowned upon. The only reason I've given this place a 3 is for the food and the ambience.

My experience in this place was downright horrible. We went here in a group of 3 on poila baishakh after going through their exclusive and lucrative poila baishakh special menu. We arrived around 1 and the place was jam packed and there was a long waiting queue. But since we were already aware of the fact that it would happen so we did not mind waiting. We were tentatively told by the management that the wait would be a maximum of half an hour,and we thought that the wait would be justified once we get the food. However we got our places after exactly one and a half hour. It was downright pathetic. The managment of this place is horrible and the staff are tremendously incompetent as they were not even properly maintaining something as basic as the queue.Coming to the food, we almost lost our apetite after the wait and while we hoped the food would made up for everything, things went downhill there also. The menu comprised of 'gorom mach chop, beguni, potato croquettes but everything was served to us dead cold. The 'fulko luchi' was no where near fulko. It was cold and soggy. The saada bhaat was the only saviour. The chitol macher muitha was bad as was the bhetki paturi( decoratively named bhetki grihoprobesh). And i have never seen such fat fillets of bhetki in a paturi. Being an ardent fish lover i went ahead and ordered a hilsa fish bhapa, which was again of no good. Though the piece was quite big but it was completely tasteless.all the other items were just about average in taste. The only good items were the kacha lanka murgi and pantuar payesh. The show stealer was the aam panna shorbot, it was prepared so well, that we chose to leave our food and actually had three glasses of the sherbet.The bill was 750 per person including tax and judging by the quality of the food it was extremely on the higher side. As we had heard very good things about this place and read some very good reviews on zomato we were sure that the taste of the food would justify every other shortcoming, but it was all in vain. I dont know about any other day when there is no such crowd, but on a day when there is bound to be an overpowering crowd, attentiveness and management should be very efficient and this place falls short off it.Just a request to the management, if there is no proper arrangement of seats please do not request people who go together to have a gala time to sit in different tables and eat mechanically. If it would have been so we could have easily eaten in our house rather than waiting in a long queue to eat from your place.

I really don't know where to start as I have so many things to say mostly negative. After reading all the good reviews about this place I really wanted to eat here today and not in the usual popular bengali restaurants. A big thumbs up to the location of this joint. We reached here exactly at 1pm and saw the waiting area to be totally jam packed . I asked the staff after giving him our name 'how long do we have to wait?' he replied "35 min" now let me say something that I have no clue about how a restaurant runs but I know this much that when there are so many people already waiting in no way can we get a seat before 1 hour and so we knew that it would take 1 hour for us to be seated and I don't know why but we decided to wait(wrong call). Lord have mercì but we started eating exactly after 2 hours. There were tremendous amount of mismanagement as they were taking reservation over phone and the people waiting for so long got agitated  and many started to shout and complain after  the outburst the situation became 5% better and names were being called a bit faster.

We were 3 people in a group and after calling us upstairs the staff asked 2 of us to sit in a different table and 1 to sit in another (now this was ridiculous of them to even say it). The whole point of coming in a restaurant with friends is so that we can sit together to enjoy our meal as this was not some puja pandal where one can sit separately to eat the 'bhog'. They should have asked us downstairs if we were willing to sit separately then we would have said no but instead we were standing in the middle of the hustle bustle of the restaurant like a fool to wait for a table where 3 of us can sit together. After a while we asked one staff whether any table would get empty faster than the others and he misguided us by saying that all the tables were on starters and no table would be empty soon but we could clearly see that one table was at the end of their main course. When we finally got a seat I knew exactly how it feels after winning a battle.

Our second battle was to get the food on our table. The staff kept on saying 5 mins for acouple of times that is when we raised our voice to say that they should at least serve the drink(aam panna) and that is when magically all the starters along with the drink was served on our table. The starters included fish muri stick which was very good in taste and quality, the chicken posto coin was okay and not something which I would ask for twice, the potato corn croquettes was nothing like a croquette but the taste was okay, the beguni was cold and I did not eat it after a bite.

In the mains we were served with cold luchis which were no where phulko and cholar dal which was also not hot. Then came good quality basmati rice, shukto, dhokar dalna but we were not served with jhuri aloo bhaja which we saw other people having and then we asked them to serve us daal again with aloo bhaja. Then they served chitol maach  er muitha which I realised that my mum makes it a thousand times better. The bhetki paturi did not have a good quality bhetki as it was so stiff and the flavours did not penetrate inside the fish. The taste of the pulao was good but the rice formed lumps. I was looking forward to the mutton dish but alas it was not warm and therefore I did not enjoy it at all and by that time I had no interest in anything else and just wanted to finish and move out. The dhaniya chicken gravy was tasty but the chicken was very dry and stiff so did not eat it after having two bites. My friend was very eager to order their shorshe bhapa elish separately and the size of the piece was good and I thought this would blow us over but it also disappointed me again as I have had much better shorshe bhapa elish in other popular restaurants. This was no where soft as it should be.

The chutney, papad were the usual ones then came the pantuar payesh which was quite watery (may be it was supposed to be that way I have no clue), rosogolla and misti doi belonged to mother diary. The one staff which was serving us was the only one paying attention and the others were not at all interested. The plates in which we were served were not properly washed that I understood after I wiped it with the napkin and even the other tables were complaining about it. 
Now comes the worst gesture off all!!! Our bill amount was rs. 2583 (I should mention here that their was tax which were charged)  and we paid rs 2600. We would have definitely tipped them but after they returned the bill we saw they returned only 10 instead of 17. This was cheap and really was an embarrassment for us. I have dined in so so many restaurants but never experianced this kind of behaviour. From start to the end it was a bad experiance and our poila boishak lunch was not an enjoyable one. May be I would have rated them in an average manner because it being a rush day but their last gesture made me not to overlook all their issues.

This is the best Bengali restaurant in this area. The other restaurants are disastrous in this lane but this one is surprisingly good. 

We ordered there special non veg thali and fish thali. Both are equally good. In dessert we ordered the patishapta and it will definitely remind you of French crepes because of the preparation. 
Staffs are courteous.
I would request them to maintain the hygiene because I found some houseflies around ! 

Still I would recommend this restaurant for better Bengali food

Good Food.  Good Ambience and good behavior of the staff. But i felt its a bit overpriced. Else all good. Location is also good but there are few other option nearby so they should think something for the entrance to attract 1st timer.  But who will have food here once they will visit it again for some good  taste.

I have been an ardent fan of their Gangulybagan outlet because of some lip smacking delicacies and unbelievably reasonable pricing. So, when they came up in a bigger way near Golpark, I just couldnt resist myself. I love bengali as well as conti. So when I was getting both the cuisines, very carefully fused together, I couldnt ask for more. You name any of the dishes... be it Ilish Steak or Bengal Gremolata Crusted Betki or Kancha Lanka Narkel Pesto Mangso or Cappuccino Mutton Kasha.... all are just awesome and you can never imagine that such Bongo-conti fusion can be done without visiting this place. Dont forget the dessert Kancha Lanka Orange Mousse and Flambed Nalen Gurer Ice Cream Pudding. Just hats off to Chef Ranjan (owner of the Restaurant chain) for his outstanding R&D.

You also get the regular bengali menu which is also just yummy. Decor is excellent, based on the megahit bengali classic movie Saptapdi and the highest standard staff hospitality led by Sandip complements everything.

Saptapadi is a catchy name by itself. One of the movies real close to my heart, one of the greatest hits during the golden era of Tollywood movies. So, this is a place which I have been planning to hit in since time immemorial. The major hindrance being the distance from my place to their baghajatin outlet. But fortune played the trick, and I was invited by

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION:
"Saptapadi" the name reminds you and takes you to 1961 where this film was featured with Late Mahanayak Uttam Kumar and Great Actress Late Suchitra sen. This is not a theatre or a studio, its a resto which is been themed by this movie and also the named is adapted too. This place is very near to Golpark and close to sarso 360. If you love and fond of bengali food then this place is surely meant for you. You will have some outstanding Bengali cuisines in forms of fusion and contempory for your likings.We were all here for the food tasting audit to this newly opened resto. On behalf of everybody i want to thanks Ranjan da to invite Team #PanchPhoron and giving us the honour.

AMBIANCE AND SERVICE:
When you walk in and go to the stairs you start to get some positivity in you. As you walk down the main glass door and step inside you feel like you are in the promotions of Saptapadi movie. Stills of the movie as well as stills of Uttam Kumar and Suchitra sen were displayed on the wall. They also got the moterbike handle and a big giant picture. The table and chairs are classy. The display of the place is so facinating. Coming to the service so the behavior and attention of the staff impressed me. Specially thanks to Ranjan da for attending us and arranging us everything what was required.

FOOD AND DRINKS:
After seeing such a wonderful place we were all excited to have the food. Basically they deal in bengali cuisines so it has to be the best dishes, After dining in we were greeted with the Kacha Aam-er-Shorbot. It was quite a refreshing drink and the taste of sweet and sour with the aroma of Aam panna made the things even better. 
Secondly we moved towrds the Starters in forms of:
1. Ranga Aloo and yellow corn nutty croquette
2. Moori Fish stick

In the starters they served us the Fusion starters, firstly Ranga Aloo came on the table. It looked very simple from the above but this was indeed something worth a try. It was sweet in taste and corn were going well with the dish.
Moori Fish stick seemed a new invention. A very different and unique type of fusion starter coatd with moori on the crust to contain the crunchy sweet taste. It was soft, juicy and very well balanced in the taste.
Both the starters were served with two typeof dips i forms of traditional kasundi and yoghurt dip which looked like mayyonaise.
Later moved to the Main course which was Traditional Bengali Thali. The items were as follows:
1. Rice - Quality of rice was very nice

2. Cholar dal - Cholar dal is my personal favourite but it was a bit too dry still the taste was on a better side.

3. Two luchi - Sizes were quite big and the quality was well done

4. Alu Jhinge - It was nice and tasty and going well with the Rice and Dal.

5. Alu bhaja - Its a all time liked item. The fry was well done and it was making the rice and dal extraordinary.

6. Avinavo Mangsho - Bengali kosha Mangsho is always been the charm according to me because of its unique taste. And certainly i got what i looked for. The Kosha Mangsho was spot on. Very tasty spicy, soft and  juicy inside. From preparation to cooking everything was near to perfection.

7. Fish Pathuri - It was excellent. Cooked really well. wrapped in the kola patta. Mixed with the aroma of Gondhoraj and flavour of lemon.

8. Papad and Chutney - Ending things up of our thali with Papad and chutney which tasted less sweet but nice.

After being done with the awesome thali we were still kept in surprise. Here comes the Fusion desserts for us.
1.  Gondhoraj Caramel Custard - This fusion dessert was certainly a huge surprise and you will  find the caramel custard with Gondhoraj and lemon. Being on the bed of Lemon juice all over it was a nice one.

2. Ice Cream Patispta - It was a rolled with vanilla ice cream indise. Less sweeter but soft and tasty with strawberry jam over the top. Nicely done.

QNQ AND PRICES: 
Quality has been fantastic of all the dishes. Quantity is been fine too. Prices are pinched well according to your pocket.

CONCLUSION:
With so many big outlets offering bengali cuisines at their best i find this place to be among the top 10 very soon. The thali we had is the Poila Baisakh special menu to be On for the guests from 15-16-17 of April at Rs.599/-. The overall food and hospitality of this place impressed me very much. I wish Team Saptapadi Good luck.

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

Yet another Bengali restaurant has opened up in the Golpark area, but this one promises a twist to it. Went there on an invitation to Team PanchPhoron for dinner last week. 

We were greeted by a mango based drink, which was a cross between aam pora shorbot and aam panna, and wasn't bad, though I personally prefer a traditional aam pora. For starters we had their Ranga Aloo and Sweet Corn Croquettes, which had the perfect texture but could have done with a little more complexity of flavours. The Muri Fish Sticks however, were brilliant. The sticks of fish, rolled in puffed rice and fried, had the perfect crunch outside, softness inside and the spices were perfectly balanced. 

Then came the perfect Bangali thali consisting of Luchi, Chholar Daal, Bhaat, Aloo Jhinge Posto, Jhurjhure Aloo Bhaja, Bhetki r Grihoprobesh, Mangsho. The luchi was suitably fluffy but the chholar daal lacked the touch of sweetness. The long grained bhaat itself was perfectly cooked but a drop of ghee over it could have taken it a notch higher. The posto and bhaja were good, nothing much to point out about those. The fish was basically a paturi, but steamed with garlic cloves and slices of Kaffir lime instead of the traditional spice mix. Then lastly, the mutton, with a gravy of ground fried onions and other spices, was the best part of the meal. The fibres were literally falling off the bone and it tasted amazing with both the luchi and the Bhaat. 
The papad and chatni ended the meal perfectly. 

But oh, just when I thought I couldn't eat anymore, came the desserts. The Lime Caramel Custard was basically good old caramel custard with a hint of lime to freshen it up. The Ice-cream Patishapta was really innovative and wasn't overly sweet, with the berry jam on top adding the perfect bit of tartness to it. 

In all I really liked my meal here. The decor too is interesting, and is a perfect place for a family lunch. The prices are moderate and they also have a special menu coming up for Poila Boishak. So drop in people!

This is the second outlet of Saptapadi after the main branch, near Baghajatin. Unlike the main branch which solely focuses on traditional Bengali dishes, this new branch has introduced some fusion dishes from the traditional Bengali recipes. The name of this restaurant has come from the famous Uttam-Suchitra starrer, Saptapadi and the place has been designed accordingly.

I was invited here as a member of 'Panchphoron' for a food audit. This place is a few mins walk taking the lane adjacent to the petrol pump near Golpark. The first floor of a building has been converted into a restaurant. A statue a tribal person greets us to the entrance. The walls are made of wood, with photos of Uttam and Suchitra hung at different places, giving a nostalgic felling. However, the main attraction is a huge photo of Uttam and Suchitra, from the famous scene, with a model of Enfield Bullet before them, giving a 3D look to the entire thing. The furniture, including the earthen glass and jugs are well suited with the ambience. Even the wash basin, will take you to different era. The overall ambience is apt for a family dinner.

Coming to the food, we were served with the complimentary drink 'kancha aam er shorbot', which was excellent. Unlike the traditional sour and spicy version, this was sweet. A very refreshing drink!

The starters which were served to us were a part of the fusion menu.

We began with ranga aloo and yellow corn nutty croquette. This was a fusion of sweet potato and corn. A sweet starter but worth a try.

The next one was moori fish stick. The fish fingers, unlike bread crumbs, were coated with a layer of puffed rice. The coating was crispy and the fish was soft and juicy.

Aside the starters, were served two dips - the traditional kasundi and yoghurt dip with mint flavour, which tasted much like mayonnaise. Both went very well with the starters.

Our main course was a thali, with traditional Bengali dishes. The thali consisted of :

Luchi - It was fluffy and well done.

Cholar dal - This was tasty, but could have been a little sweet.

Rice - Good quality rice was chosen.

Alu bhaja - This was made the way I like, my all time favourite 'jhuri jhuri alu bhaja' - a perfect companion with dal and rice.

Jhinge alu posto - The jhinge was not very prominent and the taste was average.

Bhetki paturi - This tasted excellent. The fillet was soft and well cooked. The aroma of gondhoraj lemon was prominent. A must try over here!

Saptapadi avinabo mangsho - The mutton was succulent, juicy and perfectly cooked. The gravy was not very rich and oily, yet very tasty. The taste was quite unique and i liked it !

Am er chutney and papad - The chutney was very sour and less sweet. The papad was crispy.

Our desserts were again a fusion from the traditional Bengali dishes. We had gondhoraj caramel custard and ice cream patishapta. The custard was sweet and tasty. The best was the ice cream patishapta. Vanilla ice cream was rolled inside, topped with strawberry sauce. It was very tasty.

Overall, it was a very satisfying experience. Chef Ranjan deserves an applause for making such great fusion recipies from the traditional Bengali dishes. This place is a sure winner if compared with the other Bengali restaurants in the vicinity !

This is a themed restaurant based on Uttam Kumar-Suchitra Sen's movie Saptapadi.So whenever you visit this restaurant,starting from the entrance till you are seated,you will find posters of the superstars from the movie everywhere.The part which you definitely shouldn't miss while entering is their replica of the motorbike from the famous scene in the movie,with the poster of two superstars sitting behind it.

A big thanks to team Panchphoron and Ranjan da,one of the renowned chefs in town,for inviting me to this outlet for food audit.We were offered their "Poila Boisakh" special thali menu.

On seating,we were offered their speciality, Kacha aam r shorbot which is a different version of Aam Panna as it contains roasted mangoes and "gondhoraj lebu" additionally.It was quite refreshing.

For starters,we had:-

Ranga aloo and yellow corn nutty croquette-This combination was a tad too sweet since both corn and sweet potato have the same sweet flavour.It was average and needs to be a bit more spicy.This goes well with Kasundi.

Moori fish stick-This was a invention by Ranjan da where the fish fingers are coated with moori(puffed rice) and moori dust instead of breadcrumbs and served on a toothpick.This goes well with both kasundi and their yogurt flavored mint dip.

The mains were served in a thali which consisted of:-

Luchi-This was fluffed up,crispy and soft.

Cholar Dal-This should have been sweeter than it actually was.

Rice was of good quality.

Alu jhinge-The jhinge needed to be cooked a bit more.I personally did not like this dish that much as I had better ones.

Fish paturi-The fish was good,tasted fresh.However,I found a small bone in my fish which the authorities should be a bit careful about.The overall fish was pretty good,and not as spicy as one might expect.

Kacha Lonka Murgi-The portion is pretty reasonable compared to most of the restaurants I have eaten in.Chicken pieces were solid and cooked properly,luckily they don't give bony pieces like many of it's counterparts.The gravy was rich but tasted quite well.

We were served papad with Aam r chutney after our meal.The chatni was average and the papad was crispy.

For deserts,we had:-

Gondhoraj caramel custard-This is a version of caramel custard with gondhoraj lebu.It's sweetness was balanced by the lime juice,which made it an overall good dish.This was not as sweet as a typical caramel custard.

Ice cream patisapta-This was the clear winner for me!!!The patisapta was lined with vanilla ice cream,then rolled and topped off with coulis.It was not very sweet which I liked personally.Overall,a greet ending to our meal!!!

I was not very happy with the Bengali restaurants near that area but finally I found one which I can go to with my family and friends!!!

PS-They will be serving unlimited food from the special menu for poila boisakh priced at Rs 599 per person.

It was a delight to visit the Saptapadi restaurant at Hindustan Park. One will surely be nostalgic here. The mellifluous songs from Uttam Suchitra films, the beautiful photographs of the immortal screen couple are really captivating. The whole decor is worth admiring. Chef Ranjan Biswas and his staff are very hospitable. We felt at home there. The food quality satisfied us to our heart's content special mention can be made of the thali served by them. It is really a feast to tongue. We look forward to visit this place again.

The decor of the restaurant and the pora maati dishes were a nice and lovely touch. The patisapta ice cream was a bit of a let down. It wasn't that good. The staff was very attentive and courteous. The mocha chocchori dish was the stand out item of the evebning.

Giving a continental twist to the classical Bengali fare, and yet retaining the charm of our very own Bengali cuisine, is an endeavor worth applauding and Chef Ranjan and his highly skilled (not to mention extremely nice) crew pulls this of, with aplomb. I was suggested this restaurant buy a couple of my friends, and boy am I glad that I decided to take my mother out for lunch ,here. This place is located in Purna Das Road and is well visible. The decor is very subtle, with a vintage Bengali feel. The attention to the details -be it the cutlery or the "ghora" on the table containing water or the lights or the Uttam-Suchitra posters or the menu or even the choice of music is praiseworthy.We started of with Kancha Aam er Shorbot and Kesar Badam Shorbot. The Kancha Aam er Shorbot was perfection. My mum ordered paratha with Kasha Mutton and I had ordered Murgi Bhora Mousse with Tomato Tulsi Coolie. Being an amazing cook and a fussy eater, if my mum is happy with the mutton, then it must have been pretty amazing. As for my dish, the chicken was extremely tender and well cooked and juicy. The coolie and the house salad added to the dish. My only complaint would be with the schezuan pulao. Somehow, it did not interest my palette. I would've preferred some type of sweet pulao instead, as the chicken and the salad and the coolie have a sharper taste. However, that is just a personal opinion. This was followed up with papor and chaatni, which were ok. My favorite moment was when I saw the Ice cream Paatishapta. Imagine the yummy crust of a paatishaapta, filled with gooey vanilla ice cream with a generous coating of raspberry coulis. The acidity and the sweetness was perfectly balanced and it looked pretty as a picture.The staff are extremely friendly and Chef Ranjan goes a long way to make his guests feel home.Kudos.

As I was dragging my father to a continental place for tenderloin steak on the same road, much to his disapproval, we noticed the newly opened Saptapadi. My father loves Bengali food, and I love Continental Cuisine - so it seemed like a God-sent truce ! The decor was pretty neat, with posters of Suchitra-Uttam hung everywhere. Since it was evening, we were given only the fusion food menu since the standard bengali food menu was for lunch.

The staff was friendly and we were served the complimentary kaccha aam er shorbot which was pretty good and refreshing.

We ordered one each of Bengal Gremolata Crusted Bengali Bhetki and  Prawn Thermidor. Gremolata is a an Italian garnish of raw, finely chopped garlic, parsley and lemon zest, and Chef Ranjan's twist was to serve it with an Indian version of Roasted Coriander Seeds. Though the dish comes with Spaghetti Aglio Olio, my father wanted it with rice. It also had a salad side, with was tossed in mustard sauce. The dish was not cohesive and didn't have a binding agent - like a sauce, or a dip. The fish, though well cooked, was dry.

My prawn thermidor was priced at a whopping 500 bucks + plus tax, and had one jumbo prawn with five to six chunks of prawn meat served inside the prawn shell. The house salad with kasundi cut through the Therimidor sauce, which was smart combination. But then, a few gulps and the food is over ! The rice did nothing to the dish and stood out as an in-congruent element.

Chef Ranjan, the owner and head chef, was a very cordial and friendly person. He explained to me his culinary vision behind the dishes - an incorporation of authentic continental taste to Bengali food, and that's why he made the Gremolate much like its original and stuck to the original recipe of the Thermidor Sauce, to keep the elements as authentic as it could get. I understand his vision, and as much as I respect his in-depth understanding of continental cuisine, I wasn't sure if the local palette of the customer base he was targeting had an understanding of such authentic continental food, and would appreciate his creations.

All things said, Saptapadi is barely a week old, and any entrepreneur can only launch a product to guage the market reactions. It is in fact greatly admirable that Saptapadi did decide to tread an unknown path and now Chef Ranjan has to pick up clues from customer reactions to improvise his offerings - something he mentioned he was really looking forward to ! And, the pricing needs a look into as well.

So my friend came to town and she wanted to have Bengali fare. Also she wanted to try a new place. So we decided upon this. I was a little confused with the entrance for you have to walk across the driveway to reach a staircase from where two flights of stairs would take you to the restaurant. Or you may also take the elevator. The decor is neat and full of artefacts and pictures of Bengali nostalgia. The earthen style crockery won our hearts. We ate the bhapa murgi and aam pora for starters. Loved both. Then we shared a fish thali amongst ourselves. The quantity of 1 thali was sufficient for two of us. The food in the thali was satisfactory; although not something that would linger; but good quality home style Bengali cooking. The staff was very courteous and attentive.

What comes to your mind when you first hear the name Saptapadi? Uttam Suchitra on a bike? Right? But we are not here to talk about that. Or maybe we are. Coz Saptapadi is the name of a restaurants in the city themed after, you guessed it right, the Uttam Suchitra starrer.
This is not the first one though. Mr. Ranjan, one of the renowned chefs in the city, came up with the idea of a restaurant serving authentic bengali cuisines few years back. Saptapadi,Jadavpur, his brainchild has been a hit among the foodie community of Kolkata. Tasty dishes has always been their forte, but this time they have upped the game a few notches by taking care of the overall atmosphere as well.
The outlet is easily reachable from Golpark. Just walk along Purna Das Road for a hundred meters or so & you'll find the outlet on Right.

As soon as you enter it you get the feeling that this is gonna be different. The movie stills on the wall are as good as of the Jadabpur outlet, but you'd hardly expect the headlight & steering assembly of an Enfield Bullet jutting out of the wall. (A minor correction here, the original bike used in the film was a BMW, not an Enfield). Also the whole of the interiors is done in wood, & the yellow lights accennt the feeling that you are in actually a cafe from the film sets maybe. The antique mirror will attract your eyes, as would the cashier's desk which is from the bygone era itself.
The wooden tables & chairs complement the ambience, as does the earthen dishes & potteries used. Even the wash basin is a repurposed 'petoler gamla'.

Coming to the food. This outlet claims to be different from the previous one in the way that it is supposedly their 'fusion' restaurant. I would hardly call the menu a fusion one, as most of them are pretty standard bengali meal affair. Some items are innovative, but as I said most names are common & can be found n the menu of other restaurants serving bengali food. Whether Saptapadi twists the taste & brings out the brilliance, lets find out.
The Items I tried are as follows:

1. Kancha Aamer Sorbot:
The welcome drink served is a variation of the standard Aam Panna which generally is spicier. This one is much sweeter, the tanginess just purfect. No wonder I ended up having three glasses.

2.Sada Bhaat:
Nothing to write about really. But the quantity is optimum for a single person only. So no chance of sharing here,order accordingly.

3. Cholar Daal:
The good thing about the daal is that they prepare & serve it as if its a soup. Its really tasty, & can be consumed as a stand-alone item too.

4. Mochar Ghonto:
A standard affair. They have manged to keep the the item really dry which I liked ( I really hate the sloppy texture of ghonto in general). The taste is exactly what it should be.

5.Bhapa Murgir Paturi:
Paturi to the general bengali means dip fried bhetki fillet wrapped in plantain leaves. Here's the surprise, Ranjan da has done the same thing to chicken. To the unsuspecting eye the item will seem fish untill you bite into it.Only then will you find this cleverly prepared chicken dish amazing. Thumbs up.

6.Sorshe Ilish:
This is not the best season to have ilish, & I am not the common bengali guy who swears by Ilish. Hence I didn't try the fish. The gravy was tasty, & by the look on my fellow foodie's face the fish was as well.

7.Chingri Malaicurry:
This one is going to win hearts. Prawns are my favourite anyway, & the taste they have infused in it is perfect as well.

8.Kacha Lonka Murgi:
This item is nowadays very common in Bengali Diners. The chickens were soft & the gravy not too Hot. Dont get turned down by the name, Kachalonka is there to add the colour & smell only.

9. Saptapadir Abhinaba Mutton:
This one is their signature dish. Unfortunately some of the pieces were a bit on the harder side. The preparation itself is good no doubt, but they should keep a check on the quality of the pieces.

10. Ice Cream Patisapta:
This is one hell of a innovative dish. This is no ordinary Patisapta. Try picturing Ice cream Pakora. Now try picturing patisapta prepared in the same way & served along with strawberry crush & nuts. So what you essentially get is a crunchy crust of patisapta & layer of ice cream hiding inside. I really loved this dessert.

All in all Saptapadi manages to live upto the expectations. The decor & ambiance take you back to the monochrome film era. So does the soothing accompanying music. The food does have some twists & surprises in them. Regardless, they are absolutely brilliant in taste. The staffs are polite, courteous & attentive. Hopefully this venture of Mr. Ranjan will win as many hearts, if not less, as the original Saptapadi did.
till then,
Happy eating,
cheers!

The experience at this new place, off Golpark was great. I was looking for a cool lunch with family and tried this new place. I must say experience was excellent from all aspects. Ambience, food quality & friendly service, in all i must give 10/10. The ambience of 70's fused well with contemporary food. Hope they will maintain the same quality.

Today Saptapadi opened one more outlet here and I was happy to be one of few customers. I'm amazed to see the theme and decorations it's simply WOW. I had tested few Bengali fusion dishes and I can tell that I never had such experience in past. It was simply splendid feeling.
