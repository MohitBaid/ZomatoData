What a place... Went there to give my bday treat to my friends... Just an awesome place with an awesome ambiance... 100 out of 100... Everyone was very generous and very kind... The bad part was that they didn't allow me to cut my bday cake which my friends brought it for me as a surprise...

This pub is located right next to The Bakery and is conveniently accessible from the main entrance..the ambience is top notch with moodlighting and a glass facade roof..the best time to visit this place would probably be on a rainy day when u get soaked into nature..the bar is wellstocked and there is a sense of aura to the entire surroundings..the service is also good..though the seating is a bit rugged and not to my liking(wooden racked stools and tables) it blends well to the mood..its spacious enough and with limited tables u get ample privacy..we had 6 glasses of 250ml kingfisher beers alongside cheese balls,fish fingers and sprout salad..it was delectable and the dips they provide are out of the world..the prices are on a higher side considering its a luxury five star property but u get the entire experience for a price..

The ambiance is excellent. The food is also awesome. 
                        Everything is alright except that if you redeem voucher then the 'Chefs Choice' is same all the time. They just don't change the menu, it's same all the time. That's bad ..... very bad......!!!

Wilson's is in the list of most premium pubs of the city. After sunset this place shows its full avatar with its beautiful ambience. If you've been to Lalit before you must be familiar with their glass rooftop theme that looks very decent at the same time adds a modern touch. Although Wilson's is a part of Lalit but its located just beside the entrance of the hotel with their Bakery. The good part is you can try their delicious pastries when you visit this place.

The ambience over here is extremely overwhelming. Music playing in the background coming from those Bose speakers chills your mood. Transparent rooftop through you can see open sky & dim lights is wonderful. Huge bar counter in front is charming but sitting could've been bit more comfortable.

We've had 2 Glassful of 250ml Kingfisher Draught Beer with Sprouts Salad, 1 veg & 1 non veg starter. In starters we took Fish Fingers & Cheese Balls. The starters were simply brilliant. It was fried extreamly well that was non oily, also served & garnished well with their excellent sauces. Fish finger tasted extreamly good where cheese balls were just melting in the mouth. Dipping the fries into their sauce made it much more delicious. Sprouts salad was garnished & served the best way possible in a wine glass. Overall it was very much enjoyable with Chill Draught Beer.

Normally this place is bit expensive but you can search for some deals online. With a large variety of alcohol options, experiancing it in a decent place like this with their wonderful starters, there's no way to say to this place.

This place has a very interesting decor,but the seats are highly uncomfortable. They have great offers which is actually pocket friendly. A wide range of starters will keep to happy but portions are small as expected. Worth a visit.

My favourite pub in Kolkata. Beautiful decor, one must visit after sunset. The bar counter have awasome collection of imported liquors. The staffs are extremely well behaved, fantastic ambiance. The good thing about Wilson is that it shares common entrance with the famous Bakery of Lalit Great Eastern....which means you can with your favourite muffins, cheese cake along with your drink. A must try place for all the Alcohol lovers in the city. It was
 my 4th visit and it didn't dissapoint me atall.

This was my third visit to Wilson.The Lalit Great Eastern is anyway a got property and quite renowned place to check in. The first thing I would like to comment about this place is they care a lot about their customer's comfort,probably the best hospitality I have ever received till date. Dishes and delicacies are quite mouth watering.The ambience,service,hygiene everything is upto the mark and the bakery is quite delicious and their garnishing is also quite impressive .I love this place from my core <3

Had visited this place with a dear friend. This place has an ambience that's really soothing and posh, after all it's a branch of the luxurious Lalit chain! I loved the decor but the seating arrangement tends to get uncomfortable after some time. Tried the bakery adjoined with the pub but was not very impressed. It was very overpriced for the quality of mousse and pastries that we had. I believe that if you get a steal deal in a nominal price from Groupon or Little App then one should definitely go and pay a visit.

Walked in last Friday with my colleagues to enjoy some good time. I had heard a lot about this place so wanted to check it out myself. If you want a calm and peaceful environment to enjoy your drink then this is the place to be. Floating candles are set on the table for a nice ambience. We had got nearbuy vouchers which had 6 glasses of beer 1 starter and a sprout salad. All this at 599 was really good. The servers were polite and courteous. The fish starter was delicious. The fish was flaky and the dip complemented it really well. The veg hara bhara kebab was something of a surprise. The chicken kebab was the show stealer for me. Spicy and succulent it was delicious.
One should definitely try this place! 
Hats of to the management team.

Located inside the bakery (great eastern)purchased coupon through nearbuy the place was empty 
Coupon included 6 glass of beer one starter and sprouts 
Starter was good though the quantity was less 
Didn't like the seating arrangement reason for giving it good rating is because of the glass top which was looking amazing as it was raining on Wednesday  

A nice place if you want to relax

Cake Mixing Ceremony @ Wilson's The Pub and The Bakery - The Lalit Great Eastern, Kolkata ☺

Date: 30 Sep 2016, 5:00 pm onwards

Occasion: Annual Cake Mixing event of The Lalit Great Eastern, Kolkata

Venue: Wilson's The Pub and The Bakery. Both the pub and the bakery are located in a linear fashion, one after the other. They removed the partition and used the whole venue as one.

"History of the cake-mixing ceremony dates back to the 17th century, when it marked the arrival of the harvest season. During this time lots of fruits and nuts were harvested and prepared to go into the making of the traditional plum cake."

In the current age, cake mixing is the mixing of dried and candied fruits and nuts, and soaking the same in assorted wines. This mixing is done strategically, a few months before Christmas, so that the aforesaid fruit and nut mixture is soaked and fermented enough till Christmas, when they would be required for the making of the traditional plum cakes aka Christmas Cakes.

Cake mixing is also considered to be an usher for good tidings and happiness. 

In Kolkata, 'The Bakery' is one of the oldest and most popular destinations for Christmas Cakes. After a hiatus, when it reopened in 2013, it straight away sold off a record breaking 12,000 plum and fruit cakes!

Naturally, the cake mixing is one of their most important annual events, and is done with great pomp and show. 

For this year's cake mixing, they invited a heady but selected mix of food bloggers, fashion bloggers, PR and media personnels, consul generals, entrepreneurs, esteemed clients etc. An equal number of in-house staff dressed in crisp attires, as per their designation, also graced the event. 

Open bar attracted most of the guests like a juicy flower attracts the bees. Teetotallers were warmly insisted to sip juices and aerated beverages. I settled for a goblet of apple juice, which was nice. Live band played at a corner. People were busy chatting, mingling and clicking pics.

It needs mentioning that, not only their PR team, but even other personnels like managers, chefs, front desk executives etc. were fully instrumental in making the guest feel welcome and at ease!

Big rectangular steel basins were arranged in a single line in the middle of the pub. They were filled with the linear concentrations of cashews, almonds, raisins, black currants, candied red cherries, candied lime peels, candied ginger and three colors of tutti frutti. They looked like a stack of red, golden brown, green, white, blue black and yellow lines, which was quite eye pleasing. Attractive bottles of Old Monk rum and Honey Bee brandy were placed at equal intervals.

The proceedings started with a welcome note, by a lady with the mic, who warmed up the cake mixing with some food tasting games. A couple of guests were blind folded and asked to recognise the propsed food items, by just tasting and not looking. The participants performed quite well. 

The arrival of the General Manager kick-started the cake mixing process. Each guest was handed over a set of gloves, a kitchen cap and an apron. Dressed in the aforesaid hygiene garb, people lined up both sides of the fruit and nut basins. With great fervour, both the staffs and the guests emptied all the rum and brandy bottles into these basins. Pouring off the 'spirit of the season' actually upliftened everybody's spirits around!

A teetotaller like me was on the verge of getting tipsy, just by inhaling the liquor fumes! Holding a rum bottle and pouring it off, was a first of sorts for me, and I was quite amused to do the same. Who ever thought that vegetarian food blogging would lead me to this! Ha! The fate and it's funny turns! ☺

All the cake mixing enthusiasts were asked to look for a hidden coin. Apparently, each metallic basin contained one. Finding and submission of each such coin was to be awarded with redeemable vouchers. This hidden coin tactic served two objectives - it ushered in the healthy competition and energy, and it ensured proper mixing of the kilos of ingredients. The participants kept on mixing for a long time, in their bid to discover the hidden coins.

Cake mixing was followed by an artistically arranged high tea. The vegetarian and the 'hidden egg' (cakes, pastries, breads etc.) options comprised of - 

- Tea, Coffee and 3 types of Assorted Cookies

- Strawberry swiss roll, Pistachio swiss roll, Blueberry swiss roll and Yuzu swiss roll

- Peach almond tart

- Berry coconut strudel

- Apple and celery salad with toasted hazelnuts

- Coconut marinated tofu tart with apricot salsa and mint

- Lime cottage cheese popiah with sweet corn avocado salsa

Cylindrical swiss roles in bright colors of magenta, green, purple and yellow looked quite attractive in display, with their placement style and focussed lighting. They appeared like thin compact logs, but were neatly sliced in roundels. I tasted one such magenta roundel. It was soft and tasted nice.

Peach almond tarts were rectangular slabs of attractive tea cakes, topped with glazed peach slices, which were further topped with a caramelized mixture containing roasted seeds. This mixture was set in such a fashion that, it covered the entire top areas, barring three linear circles, which appeared throughout the lengths of the tarts! These tarts also looked compact, but were neatly sliced. I tasted a portion and it was just perfect. Rarely you come across a cake sans dressing, that incorporates the element of a fruit to it's optimum. This dessert was fresh, moist and simply delicious.

I also tasted a lime cottage cheese popiah with some apricot salsa. The savoury was good and the salsa was sweet, tangy and nice.

Having spent an evening rich in fun, food and music, the guests left for their respective abodes, and the bakery was left with the task of storing the mixed and soaked candied fruits and nuts into air tight containers.

Went there on a Thursday afternoon. Classy place with lot of natural light coming in through the glass roof. Ambiance was nice and in tune with the legacy of the hotel. Staffs were courteous as well.
We went in to talk over a few beers, but unfortunately they didn't have either of corona, hoegaarden, kronenbourg - which was disappointing. I guess it's fair to expect a place of their stature to stock things they have on menu. Hopefully they will work on it. 
I'll surely revisit this place soon to try their cocktails, fingers crossed!

One of the most classiest place in a very crowded place in a office para.from outside it's a bit different.you have to enter inside the bakery section first of all you will find the dine-in section walk through there the bar section.my reaction after entering there simply great.it's like a awesome place covered by the glass n wooden section.you can enjoy your drink foods n can view the blue sky clouds rains everything.lovely concept have to say big bar section good music n a good atmosphire.
=====================================Location - >>>>>
Very easy to locate just walk from Dalhousie more towards Lalit Great Eastern hotel took your left walk 2 mins then you will find the bakery after that you get in you will find it.os else if you are coming from esplanade walk straight cross Aami Bangali restaurant then Ar Han Thai after then a sweet shop took your left walk for 1 min right hand side.
=====================================
Ambience ->>>>>
From the time I stepped in it's amazing soothing music playing very silent place actual ambience for have your drink with some mixed platter n enjoy the moment.the best moment while raining n you enjoy your drink just look up to the glassy wooden fencing.simply concept fabulous.well maintained n well decorated.

Wilson's the Pub is quite a classic place with lovely ambience and glass rooftop. The view is quite magical with the rains pouring in and seatings with candle lights in the evening. Drinks were lovely. Was thoroughly disappointed with the pathetic service quality. Would still not mind going to the place when you have too much time to just sit, relax and enjoy your drinks!

Named after the founder of this magnificent hotel, Wilson's The Pub is one sweet spot in town. The place looks absolutely world class and so is their options on the menu. The Lalit Great Eastern has gone through a lot lately and to be honest, the comeback is way too legendary.

I fell on love with all the elements this place puts in front of you. Starting from the ambience to the delicious and authentic preparations to their humble service, it's gold class.

Though the prices are towards the higher side, but I'd never even look or think before paying cause the experience is so extraordinary. Moreover, if someone decides to step into a place like this one, he/she must understand the legacy for the price offered here.

A must visit for all and I must say, I was astounded by the beauty of this place and the entire hotel.

Wilson's the Pub is a place to hang out..... have been there a couple of times before and was there this Sunday to play for a private party. Me and my band had a great time there with people around. Staffs are good and the ambience is very very soothing.
 yeah the costing is on the higher side but again its a part of the 5Star hotels so cost is not that you can complain upon.
Dint had much food there as we had a dinner buffet waiting for us at the Lalit Great Eastern. 
But with a few drinks and some good music it a good place to hangout. 
I love the roof of the place as i was lucky once to see view the beauty of the roof when it rains... I

This classic pub offers a relaxed ambience ideal for casual business and social rendezvous. In keeping with the lively spirit of the city, it offers a selection of beer, wine & spirits along with finger food.

We settled for-

4 mugs of DRAUGHT BEER- super chilled perfect for the saturday eve.

 FRIED FISH CRUMBS WITH TARTARE SAUCE : the fish (probably bengal bhetki) was fresh and butter fried with a crisp batter coating.The tartare sauce was finger licking good!

MONTE CRISTO sandwich : now this is what i call 'Huge'. The pics are attached.i loved it. 2 big pieces of traditional chicken sandwich with swiss cheese (gruyere/emmental) in between the french toast along with the deep fried 'fat' french fries were heavenly.the salad and especially the tomato chutney like dip were not upto my liking but can be easily overlooked ; as the portion on the whole filled both of us!

For desserts,we opted for the STRAWBERRY MOUSSE and a WHITE CHOCOLATE CAKE  from The Bakery next to it, these were wonderful to look at ,and taste wise, and absolutely value for money!

I enjoyed the decor and the music.One can cross the bakery to the Outside smoking zone. The bartenders are very well behaved.However the food menu lacks variety.

P.s. The candle lights after the sunset,creates a magic all together, do take your loved ones for a splendid evening over a couple of pegs!
Cheers :D

This used to be my favorite bar in Kolkata. The staff was nice, the drinks are high quality and fresh, and it is quiet. But I went last Friday for happy hour with out of town guests, and that's when shit hit the fan. 

1. It isn't clear anywhere what consists of Happy Hour. 2. We learned that they add 60 ml instead of keeping the normal 30 ml in each cocktail and then charge you double without your consent3. Management fights with you when you explain why there is so much confusion. They tried blaming me because I had come in a couple of times in the last three months, saying that I should have explained to my friends what was going on. No, that is your job as a service provider. We stayed for 1 hour trying to fix our bill. That was absolutely ridiculous and they lost a formally loyal customer. 

I'm truly horrified that they treated us like complete animals, expecting us to pay for drinks we did not consent to. I truly hope management gets its processes into shape because the ambiance is incredible, and they are doing a huge disservice to their brand with such petty behavior. 

I won't be going back again.

The Wilson's Pub at The Lalit Great Eastern was named after the original owner of the property. Located overlooking the street you can see the hustle bustle of the city .... but the alfresco effect that is their would possibly be far more delightful on a starlit evening. Luckily when I visited it was a cloudy rainy sort of day and that made for great ambiance. Its got a casual chilled out vibe to it and the Bartenders are a friendly enthusiastic lot always ready to suggest or create a cocktail for you. Tables are spaced apart so you can converse in private and have a relaxed time. Like many places in this property they proudly showcase memorabilia from the Great Eastern ... Crystal Glasses displayed at the bar among the bottles of the various spirits on offer. The corner of the bar has brass and silver jugs piled up near the Days Special Drink. That days special was the Gondharaj Lemon ... a flavour I especially love and most of you who have some knowledge of Bengal and its cuisine will identify with it. The bartender created a delightful Mocktail for me from it and it was rally lovely ... fresh cooling citrus flavours which were perfect for the afternoon. I look forward to an evening visit soon :-)

WILSON BAR & BAKERY, THE GREAT EASTERN HOTEL, KOLKATA
Arrivederci Kolkata along with the monsoon in a city so quaint and flooded that I felt more at home here in spite of having braved the cloudburst in aamchi Mumbai many a time. Brother in law a thorough bred alcoholic decided to surprise us with a treat – lunch out. Somewhere special is all that he said. It was raining salt n pepper when we ventured out. We parked the car somewhere near the Governors palace and crossed the famous Chowringee Road to a partly masked building front which turned out to be dinosaur “ The Great Eastern Hotel” in its new avatar The Lalit Great Eastern Hotel. Wow! Excitement knew no bounds as this was the very place where my late father had started as a trainee in the 50’ and heard many stories of romance during the Raj. Unfortunately, post the Raj the Hotel was beleaguered with problems due to labour/unionism which Calcutta had become associated with in the next  four decades.
The Great Eastern Hotel (officially Lalit Great Eastern Hotel) is a colonial era hotel in the Indian city of Kolkata (formerly Calcutta). The hotel was established in 1840 or 1841; at a time when Calcutta, the seat of the East India Company, was the most important city in India. Referred to as "the Jewel of the East" in its heyday, Great Eastern Hotel hosted several notable persons visiting the city. After India's independence in 1947, the hotel continued its business but went into decline during the Naxalite era of West Bengal; later the state government took over the management. In 2005 it was sold to a private company and was reopened in November 2013 after an extensive renovation.
We entered the Hotel thru the side façade on Waterloo street and were shocked to see the turn around. A cute front desk guided us around with pride. Clearly the oldest Hotel in Kolkata had arrived. We were recommended The Wilson Bar & Bakery.
Wilson Bar is basically a courtyard covered with a transparent glass roof which is thatched and tilting. With the heavy rain battering the roof and walls, we watched the rain water creating patterns on the glass from the cozy underneath in the warmth of the bar. The bar was bright with dark teak benches and seats and a FIFA like atmosphere to reign in the football fans in the evening.
The bartender informed us that the bar is opened and a Liquid Buffet (happy hours for Mumbaiikars) where in you order one and get one free. My BIL was elated and could think of no other place on earth to impress us with. Order made and rendered. Vodka ( Absolut) with tonic water for both me and BIL and a beer ( Budweiser)  for the wife. 
From the limited menu we ordered a Mezze.  Mezze is a selection of small dishes served to accompany alcoholic drinks as a course or as appetizers before the main dish in the Near west Asia, Arab lands and the Balkans. Mezze was available at this newly restored ancient 5 star at a princely sum of Rs.325/- and consisted of Hummus, pitta bread , Babaganoush,feta cheese salad, 4 kefdakia ( veg koftas) and a couscous salad. This was an excellent russle up from the kitchen at a price tag which is shocking to most of us.
Then I ordered an Arugula salad with barbequed chicken at Rs. 325/- per plate and wife ordered a massive Monte Cristo  sandwhich at  Rs.425/- . I can tell you for sure that the helping in this joint are massive as my wife generously shared the Mote Cristo with my BIL and generous bits from my end. Total bill turned out to be Rs.4795/- which could have had a hand in myself feeling a tad bit dizzy.

Excellent atmosphere, superb décor with a great ambience of a sports bar.

Ambience – 10/10 ( Modern and Cozy)

Taste – 9/10

Brilliant. The food is great, services are superb. Even the ambience is great. They jave wonderfully mementoed the old bakery shop. Though would say that the place being opwned recently is still doing a fantastic job. Just give it a few more weeks and the place would be even better. Also the nar is just adjacent to the bakery. A must visit is what I would recommend.
