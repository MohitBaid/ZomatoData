A classy ambience with nicely done d√©cor is the first thing to notice about this fine¬†place. The furnishings are beautiful and only add to the charm of the overall calm and relaxing atmosphere. The all white ambience is really pretty. The food is at par with a delicious fare of¬†Italian and Continental dishes. The mocktails are equally refreshing. Moreover fast and courteous service increases the charm of this place and is worth a visit :)

This place is situated very near to Forum mall Elgin road. The place has a lot of choice for all vegetarians. They even have food cooked for Jains. The chocolate waffle was good. However I wish they had more choices related to the waffles. They have two varieties, chocolate and the berry. The pasta was very tasty with the right amount of oregano. 

The decor is really nice but the space inside is very less. The staff and the service is prompt. 

Overall for food it's not a very good place for non vegetarians but for the decor it gets a thumbs up.

This is a perfect Pinterest-y breakfast cafe which will keep you coming back for more. I had visited for breakfast after my night shift and was totally woken up and cheered up by their food. We had two cold coffees, English breakfast, Egg Fritatta and Nutella Waffles. Every single dish was yummy. The English Breakfast platter was perfect!!! The kinda runny poached eggs, along with the grilled sausages and bread tasted very nice. No matter what I write, it will still be less for those Nutella Waffles. Crispy and drizzled with Nutella and chocolate sauce on the side...üòçüòçüòçüòç. I will keep going back more for just that üòçüòç. We did have to wait a long time for our order, which was annoying. But then the staff said there was some issue at the kitchen, and gave us complimentary french fries as an apology. That's some good service in my books! They definitely have a very happy customer in me. Looking forward to go back soon :-)

This is a nice place for evening snacks. The place is well done and didn't have any waiting time. We ordered a white sauce pasta, Virgin mojito and chocolate montecarlo. All of them were good but the chocolate montecarlo deserves special mention because it was a perfect blend of ice cream and cake topped with Choco chips. Overall a good place to visit.

How to Reach: The nearest metro station is Rabindra Sadan. Its 11 minutes walk from the metro. the place is little difficult to find, situated inside a little alley. A gem for introverts and spending some quality time alone with a book and coffee. The entrance: I have no picture of the entrance or the interior. But, I can assure you it is very cozy and warm.

Heard a lot about this place!
So decided to give it a try yesterday for meeting with an old friend...
üîπAmbience : It has a beautiful warm vibe throughout the cafe...nice tables by the window with a street view outside...and an old charm in the entire decor of the cafe üòç
üîπFood : This is where i feel the place just falls flat out!! We had ordered for two cappuccinos, a plate of bruschetta & chicken a la kiev. The cappuccino was nothing special, avearage in both looks and taste. The bruschetta was disappointing...we had expected the toppings to be a mixture of veggies but it was only tomatoes on one slice & only mushrooms on the other!! However i felt the chicken kiev to be the worst!! The chicken breast was really tough & hard, we had a tough time to cut and chew our food...mashed potatoes which came on the side was very bland and no richness in it at all!!
üòï
üîπService : This was really prompt and quick. The staff were very courteous and quick to attend.
Perhaps I'll pay another visit to this place just to try out their other dishes as well to check if they aren't any better either.

This is one of my all time favourite cafes, every time I come here, I don't feel like leaving.
It's the clean ambience, the beautiful John Mayer songs playing in the back all day, the service from the staff and definitely the exquisite dishes available here that enhance your experience and make you feel like staying here forever.

The dishes in specific, be it Starters, Mains or Desserts, are absolutely delicious. Everything I've had here, has made me happy ; they taste amazing, come in good amount and are priced reasonable making the whole meal an amazing experience. The service from the staff, how rapid they attend and serve you is also worth a mention.

What I had : -
1. French Benedict
2. Aglio Olio
3. Creamy Mushroom Risotto - must try
4. Foriestire - must try
5. Chicken Strogonoff
6. A la Kiev
7. Banana Pancake
8. Cappuccino
9. Chocolate Shake - must try
10. Caramel Cold Coffee
11. Sizzling Brownie with Ice Cream
12. Monte Carlo - must try

Do visit the place once, it's absolutely amazing, i'm certain that you won't be disappointed !

Went to this place for a Christmas brunch. Located at an approx 10 mins walk from Rabindra Sadan metro station, near Netaji Bhavan. 
The ambiance is quite charming, with white brick walls and large windows, allowing ample light in the place. The seating is on the first floor and has a french cafe feel to itself. Coming to the service, it was quite prompt even on a busy day like this. Staff was well-behaved.
Now let's talk FOOD! This place mainly specializes in vegetarian food, and has a separate one sheet menu for non-veg dishes. We ordered the fried chicken with savory waffles, but they said it wasn't available. We ordered -
1) Nachos - It was crispy and topped with a generous amount of salsa, jalapeno, mayo and sour cream. (Rating - 4.0)
2) Mushroom Burgundian - It said in the menu that it was served with croutons but it was served with plain toasts. The mushroom had a nice tangy taste. (Rating - 3.5)
3) French Benedict - Oh.. my.. God.. Totally totally worth every bite. The oozing egg yolk and their hollandaise sauce makes every bite oh-so-creamy. Absolutely loved it. (Rating - 5.0)
4) Choco chip pancake - One of the best pancakes in town. So fluffy, moist, light and delicious. With the chocolate sauce poured on top, it takes you to the next level. Highly recommended! (Rating - 5.0)
5) Hazelnut hot chocolate - A total disappointment. It had a typical taste of Cadbury hot chocolate powder fix that you get at your grocery store and nothing else! No taste of hazelnut at all. (Rating - 1.0)

Overall, their breakfast menu is worth trying. Pocket pinch is reasonable. Prices are exclusive of taxes. Going back for the waffles and more! Happy eating. :)

The cafe is located in a lane opposite to Forum, Elgin. The stairs take you to the sitting area which is nicely decorated. Their vegetarian dishes are better and the non vegetarian dishes are recent inclusions. On my last visit I had:
Chicken Tender - I don't feel that the spices used here complimented chicken that well. So this was little disappointing.
Nutella pancakes - it was decent.
Dark chocolate cold coffee- it was more of a chocolate cold coffee rather than dark chocolate. Too sweet for my taste. 
They should work on their non vegetarian dishes. The staff is well mannered and attentive. :)

The decor is delightful. It is archaic with a contemporary tone. Eventhough our server was pleasant, service was painfully slow. I felt that this place is not equipped to handle a handful of orders. It took almost an hour for our 'a la kiev' to arrive. This dish was ordinary, its coating was very hard and it seemed to be prepared in a rush. Hawaiian chicken sandwich was a major disappointment. There was way too much mayonnaise, along with a weird oily, unpleasant smell. The caramel cold coffee and chocolate cold coffee were delicious.

It's nicely decorated and gives that good english feel when you sip into that glazing white cup of Earl Grey. The food is not a pinch on the pocket and tastes pretty good! However the non Veg options are limited!

The cranberry cocktail with a tint o ginger was simply awesome. Please guys go for it. Chicken frittata was good too. Although I expected the chicken A la kiev to be best but I think it could have been better. The best was yet to come which is off course the Nutella waffles. It was the yummiest dish that we have tried.. since am a big fan of Nutella so going for the Nutella flavour was quite obvious. But will be trying out the other waffles in the future for sure..

Country house is located opposite lane to the forum mall and nearby belgian waffle company outlet.

Place was small but not cozy and seating arrangements at 1st floor.

Service is fast and attending.

Ambiance and decor is nice.

Drinks we had hot chocolate and apple attack.

Hot chocolate was good but apple attack was mediocre.

Coming to the food which disappoints me that they say one thing on the menu and serve different.

We order Chicken Tender which had clearly written chicken with green salad with hot sauce and photos are attached please it, hardly I can find any green salad. There was 3 lettuce leaves served with normal tomato sauce rather than Hot Sauce.
What you call salad?...............A 3 pcs of Lettuce Leaves?

Mushroom Burgandian was suggested by the attender and really it was good but like other menu has written and mentioned that dish will be given with croutons and they served with normal toasted bread.

Make your own pasta we tried and that was good. We made Arabita fetucinni pasta.

Later we ordered Devil's Egg from thier breakfast menu and it was nice.

***TO THE MANAGEMENT - PLEASE IMPROVE QUANTITY BECAUSE A ONE PLATE IS NOT EVEN SUFFICIENT FOR SINGLE PERSON.***

This place was in my bookmark list for a long long time which I could visit finally. Mainly went there for their waffles and also because of the queue outside Belgian Waffle Co. which was big enough to make us wait for an hour more. Coming to the place it has an amazing ambience and great seating area. Took a seat right beside the big window which had an amazing view and was superb for clicking pictures.

1. BERRY ALL THE WAY-- A 4 piece waffle plate was served with a bowl of hot chocolate sauce and lots of dried berries and choco syrup. Although the crust could have been a little extra crispier. Definitely was a hell lot tastier than many other waffle places in towns.

Tried only one item as of now but definitely will go back to try more of their items.
Also this place has an amazing graffiti wall which just made the place more attractive.

Refer to my account for more pictures and reviews.

I've been here a few times. Staff is courteous and place is cute. I've tried their drinks and vegetarian food and it was quite good. But, this time the food was so disappointing. They recently started serving non veg food. We ordered a stuffed chicken breast and a veg burger. Honestly, I didn't enjoy any of it. I don't know whether the quality of their other dishes have fallen too, maybe it was just a bad day but, didn't enjoy the food at all. The chicken was fried in some batter. The coating was almost inedible. The burger was just weird.

This place is one of the best places i have ever visited‚ù§. It's located just in the opposite lane of forum mall, so it's easily accessible. The interior and the decor is one of those breakfast places that you have in abroadüòç. The ambience and atmosphere was really good and soothing to your mind, so you can go there with your family, friends and better half to enjoy a quality time. We had ordered home made chocolate waffles with "add ice-cream", and, Fries Basket. The waffles were crunchy and crispy from the outside and soft from inside, the chocolate sauce was neither too bitter nor too sweet so that it suits every kind of taste budsüòçüòÅ, and the all time vanilla ice-cream is everyone's favouriteüòç. It was served with choco crumble amd chocolate syrup. I really loved the waffleüëçüòç. The Fries Basket had three different types of potato fries viz. friench fries, crunchy potato wedges, and crispy potato rosti. The french were really well cooked like they were soft from the inside and crispy from outside, the potato wedges were also amazing and so were the rostis. I absolutely loved the Fries Basketüëåüòç. Their service is also fine. So overall i loved this place‚ù§.

The sausages they served were the ones you get to buy of Venky's or some other brand. Highly disappointing. The coffee was nothing extraordinary. Limited non veg menu. I love the windows there. The decor is simple yet nice.

Visited The Country House for breakfast on a weekday. Located in a lane opposite to the Forum Mall, the cafe boasts of an extensive cafe and continental menu. The ambiance is refreshingly simple and soothing - appropriate for a casual meet up with friends or a date.¬†

Now coming to the food. We ordered a Spanish Omelette, Egg white masala omelette and water melon juice. I loved the Spanish omelette. The bread accompanied with the omelettes were not fresh. The watermelon juice was fresh but watered down.¬†

After the first course we ordered a plate of Home made chocolate waffles with ice cream. The waffles tasted divine with added ice cream and chocolate sauce poured on it. The portion size was decent and filling.¬†¬†

My first visit to the Country house was satisfying but there is definitely some room for improvement. The watermelon juice definitely needs to be thicker and pulpy. The prices are slightly more expensive than expected, especially the breakfast platters.¬†

Service was prompt and satisfactory

Average cost for two should be around Rs 900-1000

It has been a month since my visit. It was a pleasant experience for sure. 
For appetizers we ordered Chicken Tender and Mushroom Burgundian. Chicken Tender was definitely tender and crispy and the latter tasted different but tasty(the Burgundian wine was indeed exotic). 
Then comes the main course where we ordered POLLO la MARSALA, FORIESTIRE and Lasagna. The first two dishes were delectable, especially FORIESTIRE was really delightful. Unfortunately the lasagna was a little disappointing,it didn't meet my expectations at all. I have had better Lasagna.


Well,my friends tricked me to this place to give me a birthday surprise! We went to the couch on the top floor. The beautiful wall painting in the background of my 21st birthday made my pictures a little more pleasing! So the decor definitely deserves 5 üåü!

I wanted to try out this place after hearing & reading good reviews about it. So, I had booked a table for 3 and immediately got a confirmation from the restaurant. We reached around 8:15pm , the staff were courteous and the ambience was nice. Then the scenario changed after 15 mins when no one turned to take the order at the table. Even though there were not too many people seated. Finally, around 8:30pm after several attempts to call the staff, someone came to take the order. We placed an order for three items from the menu- Caesar Salad, Aglio Olio & Mushrooms crepes and requested the staff to serve it a lil fast, since we had a movie to catch up.

 It was 9pm till none of the 3 dishes ordered were served despite of simple request. I mean really how long does it take for a restaurant to make a Salad? When no one turned up I got up to check the status. Then, I saw that all the staff were busy serving one particular group of people which was like a Private enclosure. I asked for my order status and they said it will take a while despite waiting for more than half an hr. Then the owner turned up (not too sure if he was the one) and then we got to know that they were his known guests or friends, so all the attention and staff were busy serving one table. Finally, they brought the Ceasar Salad and the remaining two dishes were still not ready. We had no choice but to cancel the remaining two and head off. We left the restaurant hungry & dissatisfied. A small piece of advice, being in the hospitality industry if you want to give priority to your known guest first, pls don't take reservations. Hope, it helps rather than leaving your guests irritated & dissatisfied.

Wrapped in a classic old Brit-Calcutta house this is one promising Caf√©. From the windows, the staircases, to the lightings- being here is overwhelming. 
Extremely polite and helpful hosts helped us to polish off some scrumptious dishes, ranging from Chicken Ala Kiev, French Marengo to the classic Waffles with Maple Syrup. 
The best surprise was the bits of lays potato chips in the Ala Kiev. We felt like two school girls all giggling and excited to try it out after so long. 

Thank you.

It's a small cozy place, good decor. But the food is disappointing. We ordered two mocktails, it gave us sugar rush.The Chicken A la Kiev is bleh! Coming from Bangalore, I do understand the cafe culture. But though the interior looks promising, food is a disappointment. It's also pricey for that tiny amount of food.

As we walked into this European styled cafe, completed with large windows, white walls, french seating, wall murals and wooden staircase, I knew this breakfast experience would be epic! We sat ourselves on one of the window side and the warm winter sunlight streaming in made the ambiance surreal.¬†
Ordered cappuccino, spicy hot chocolate, cheese and mushroom crepes, English breakfast and Spaghetti in white sauce. The spicy hot chocolate was well made - thick and delicious! The spaghetti was smooth and the crepes couldn't have got creamier. The English breakfast was on point but what stole the show was the Nutella Waffles with chocolate sauce we ordered for dessert! The waffles were made to perfection with the right balance of crisp and sweetness and left us craving for more. We also ordered pancake with maple syrup which although was equally well made, lost out a little as compared to the waffles. Staff is hospitable and courteous.¬†
A totally insta worthy cafe and we took loads and loads of pics. Taking away a point only because my cappuccino was extremely light and milky inspite of me stressing on the fact that I'd like a strong one! Overall, a must visit for winter mornings and lazy breakfast!
¬†
I'm still smitten by the place! Returning soon <3

Okay 3rd time at this place within a very short time period. This place seems to be too underrated for the food and ambience it serves. 
We ordered apple pancakes but the waiter took a wrong order or apple pie. At first we were a bit pissed off, but had it anyway. And thank goodness for the blunder. The pie was heavenly. It's just too perfect. The textures, the taste, the raspberry syrup with it and the freshness of apples inside. It's a must must try.

2nd time- I had to visit this place again. I highly recommend to try their pancakes. They are soft,fluffy and just the right texture. We had the berry pancakes and there's no doubt it's one of the bests in the city.

Did hear a lot about this place.
Ambience- the place looks appealing from the outside. With creepers around the entrance gate, painted walls and comfy seatings provides a lovely photogenic ambience.
Price and staff- the price are not so hard on the pockets and staff are polite and very helpful.
Food- for drinks and beverages we took ginger rock salt cooler, blue curacao and earl grey tea. Dishes we ordered were Arancini balls (cheese balls in gravy), Branzino e peoci (a fish dish), pollo e la marsala (a chicken dish).
Pros- all dishes were exceptionally good and so were the beverages.
Cons- I couldn't find any really. It's simply a great place to visit.
Recommendations- will recommend everyone to visit this place. As for me will love to visit again and again.

One of the best place to vouch when you want a calm and composed surrounding. The ambiance is top notch and the food quality is delicious. Both veg and non veg items are available in different varieties. It's  a well decorated atmosphere and one can relax with ease. It's a thumbs up so enjoy the place at the heart of the city!

Well, this is another of those popped up cafes in Kolkata serving decent food with an interesting decor.
I loved it's walls, the paintings and the frames where one can leave their thoughts on sticky notes.
Coming to food, you have very less non-vegetarian options, apart from the breakfast menu. We ordered Foriestire which is stuffed chicken breast accompanied by veggies and Chicken Marengo which has grilled chicken leg. Both the dishes were a twist in the Continental cuisine and I liked the variation. Although I am much more a fan of authentic Continental cuisine. We also tried the Caesar Salad, which was good but not up to the mark. 
The staff were courteous and friendly. I felt the young crowd visits much more here and sometimes can be very loud.
Would like to visit again to try their breakfast spread.

It‚Äôs a cozy cafe just right next to my in law‚Äôs house which I wanted to visit for breakfast. Last Saturday we went there for breakfast and ordered English breakfast, mushroom crepe, Spanish omelette and banana pan cakes. Food is really good and banana pan cakes is surely recommended. They should serve a serving of juice, tea or coffee with the English breakfast to
Complement it. Overall this is a must visit place if one is looking for a cozy breakfast with your loved ones.Staff behavior is also very polite and warm.

I just loved the place. They do specialize in Italian and continental cuisines (though they just have few selective items on menu). The ambience was amazing and the decor holds individuality. This place is ideal to hangout with friends or partner. 
The lasagna that we ordered was authentic and adequate in amount. The pancakes were mouth-watering and worth a try. 
This place is highly recommended to all the folks out there.

Another in the roster of cute, hole in the wall restaurants that do mixed continental cuisine dotting the city. We pored over the vast menu and settled for an array of dishes. We started with broccoli soup which was not what I was expecting but good nonetheless and bruschetta which was one of the better ones I've had anywhere as it was loaded with toppings. Much recommended. Main course tempered our experience as the Italian sizzler was ok but generic, not much Italian about it (unless you count the spaghetti), lasagna was more au gratin and the mushroom stroganoff had a runny, random curry on the side. Go here for the appetizers and give the pizza a chance maybe.

We stumbled upon this cafe while returning home from Forum Mall. The attractive old school outside decor instantly caught our eyes. Wooden stairs, high ceiling, chandeliers, big French windowpanes, whitewash brick walls made the inside equally quaint. It is a modern day cafe set in a heritage building. The balcony was turned into a smoking zone. There was a loft like structure for hosting a moderate gathering.

I would suggest them to add a few more non vegetarian items in the menu including at least one non vegetarian pizza. We ordered one virgin mojito, one brownie shake, one lasagne and one chicken tender. The drinks were moderate, lasagne was not really up to the mark, and the batter of chicken stripes lacked some flavour. Our bill was around 1k so this could not really be your go-to place for any occasion.

The attendants were courteous and quite helpful. I was not really satisfied with the food though. If I visit again I would like to try some of their breakfast menu which looked quite illustrative.

It is located at a very convenient distance from Forum Mall,Elgin Road.
The place is quite cozy and the interior is well decorated, perfect for an evening to be spent with friends but not with a large group of course else you would end up sitting in different tables.
Coming to the food, non-veg items are very less in option but the Cream of Chicken soup and Chicken Tender was amazing though.. 
Do give it a try.
Happy Eating!

Coming to the food, we ordered Chicken Tender, Mixe Sauce Pasta, Exotic Pizza & Nutella Waffle. Personally, I dont like waffles much but the one that I had here was pretty nice. The quantity they serve is also decent. Adding to all this, the place is budget friendly. Definitely worth a visit (and many). Cheers to the team.

A visit to any restaurant during the pujas is a very dicey issue. However we decided to give this place a go on the nabami evening. The ambiance was very good. The walls are decorated with myriad stuff like a  string of coffee mugs with interesting graphitti, a series of monochrome landscapes, and even a wall-hanged cycle! The food was great. We ordered mocha cafe, watermelon cooler, hazelnut hot chocolate and chocolate coffee. All of them were very well prepared and were given in ample quantities. We had pasta in cheese sauce and arabiata sauce. Both of them were very well prepared. Overall a very nice experience. Will visit again.

The Country House is a beautiful place on Elgin with food that could do a little better to keep at par with the decor and their aesthetic. 
We ordered the Huevos Rancheros which was supposed to come with a bread we later realised but they just put the eggs and chives on baked beans (the good part) and a tomato sauce which was just like pur√©e and the taste was overwhelming. The Hawaiian Chicken Sandwich was in fact quite good but it depended heavily on coleslaw in comparison to the quantity of chicken or pineapples. 
We ordered the Monte Carlo ice cream cake and Classic Waffles with ice cream for dessert and both of them were amazing! 
Among the drinks, we got the Ginger Lemon Ice Tea which was quite pleasant and the Tomato juice which was refreshing but it tasted like some other vegetable. 
The service was great and the staff is very fast and helpful! 
Overall, we didn‚Äôt regret going there for breakfast/brunch but I would think twice before coming back. I do want to try their lunch menu.

M just too delighted today after visiting this place. Such a quaint lil' cafeteria located on the opposite lane of Forum Courtyard. Also, easy to locate with its white-washed walls and enormous old school windows. 
Coming to the decor, it's more than just pretty and lit so beautifully. And if  you are lucky to find a place next to one of those big glassed windows, your whole  time spent here would just go to just another level.
We ordered chicken olio aglio spaghetti which had a nice flavour and was served in a good proportion. Next was the hot dog which was extremely juicy and the bread smelled so fresh. Along with these we had ordered Americano and Tulsi green tea that brew a soothing aroma.
To top all of it, the desert was the best part here. The home made chocolate waffle was made with the right amount of crunch and chocolate chips. The best I had till now in Calcutta.
And, the staffs here were so polite and cooperative. A must-must visit ! :)

On a lazy Saturday morning we decided to have our breakfast in this pretty joint in elgin near bhawanipore college . The first thing that will attract you here is the decor. A cycle hanging in an inverted manner , the quirky walls , the potterhead cups , the white subtle sitting area , everything is on the top notch. We ordered 2 English breakfast and one paneer paratha.

ENGLISH BREAKFAST - Consisting of salami sausage bread butter mashed potato two eggs this is the perfect English breakfast you call for. On our request they made sunny side up instead of fried egg. The salami and sausage were really fresh and tasty and the quantity is huge.

PANEER PARATHA - To experiment with the green chutney we ordered this dish but the chutney was unavailable which made us sad. Otherwise the parathas were crispy and nice.

Next we ordered one hot chocolate , one classic espresso and one cafe latte. The hot chocolate was topped with chocolate syrup which was nice , but otherwise it tasted pretty bland. The espresso and latte both were refreshing. The service is prompt and the stuffs are polite. Will definitely visit this place again for lunch.

The massive windows let enough natural light to enter, making the place brighter in the daytime. We had ordered an Omelette, Savoury Waffles and a Sandwich.

The first thing you notice about the eatery when you enter the cafe is the quaint ambiance that the owners and designers have successfully recreated. The cafe brings in a punch of joy in the insides for people who crave for such ambiances, and have complained for so long about Kolkata not having enough of such cafes.¬†
We ordered an Italian Sizzler on the recommendation of one of the staff, and were extremely disappointed by the imbalance of flavours in the spaghetti. The roasted vegetables were a delight, as were the garlic toast.¬†
The Lemon Iced Tea too left us wanting for more. The presentation of the Iced Tea was beautiful though. We had asked for a Thumbs Up/ Coke, and the one that was served to us was flat. The staff was courteous enough to get that off the table without any delay.
I've heard good reviews about the burgers that this joint offers, so until I eat them, this is all!

This place is one beautiful place to go specially in the morning and yes ofcourse other time as well. We went here for breakfast. I really like their breakfast menu. We ended up taking Waffles "the classic way" , the fluffy pancakes and both with chocolate syrup. They also have the option of maple syrup out there. And to complete it a cup of hot chocolate. For a person like me i like starting my day on a sweet note. But they have other varieties in the breakfast menu as well. Do give it a try :)

We went to this place on 29.08.2017

Its located right in the opposite lane if Forum Mall's Shopper Stop side. It's bang opposite to Cream Centre Restaurant!

Coming to decor, the place is nicely done with good interiors and design. I will rate it a 4.5/5 for decor.

Now coming towards the music, the place had some light music being played but to our dismay we cannot get the tracks changed which was utter disappointment.

No Wi-Fi at this place somehow ruined our Snapchat story line! The network connection of Airtel and Jio was a bit weak here!

Now coming  towards the food, let's discuss it in detail.. 

We ordered the following.. I will rate them individually and try to give some pointers.. 

Nachos (3.5/5) - Okay sort of.. Could be better.. Yet no complaints.. 

Cheesy Garlic Bread (3/5) - Lacked cheese! 

Fries Basket (3/5) - French Fries were great. Potato Wedges tasted horrible. Potato Rings were okay. 

Naepolitan Potato Croquettes (0/5) - I wish someone comes and explains to me what this thing was! It was worst! 

Exotic Veggie Pizza (3/5) - Looked great but tasted average! 

Mixed Sauce Pasta (0/5) - The pasta was probably stale because of which it tasted a bit sour and had no taste.. The chef needs to work on this a lot.. 

Coming towards Drinks.. 

Kitkat shake, Brownie shake and Oreo Shake - All tasted the same with different toppings as their name suggests! (3.5/5)

Ginger Rock Salt Cooler (3.5/5) - Tasted okay! 

Virgin Mojito (4/5) - This was the best among all the drinks which we ordered. 

Coming  towards service, the staff was courteous and we faced no such issues with them.

Now the bill amount.. We were 5 people and we were billed ‚Çπ2500.. So this is definitely a mid budget place but with a not so mid budget food quality.. Food can be drastically improved!

There should a lot more inclusions in the non veg menu. Thats my very first and most important suggestion. Food quantity and even taste is not upto the mark considering the prices for the main course dishes. Oreo shake and virgin mojito were good. The dessert monte carlo is a strict no for anyone who thinks about ordering it, yes it tastes that bad. The decor , ambience and the service is good.

Well randomly we had been exploring and we came across this place. Lo Behold, we were a little disappointed because all they served then were vegetarian food. Well nonetheless, we ordered garlic bread and cold coffee.
Looking forward to visit it again as I understand they have started serving non-vegetarian foods too...!

Initially on my visit to this place, they served Vegetarian only. So i had to move out of this place. Now when I visited, I found they have started Non-Vegetarian too. ‚ò∫ That's of course is an Add on !

Ambience - It has seating arrangements in the top floor and also has a separate cosy yet spacious arrangement aside. The decor is truly commendable which is based on recycling. The brick works are worth mentioning.

Food - Ordered a Sizzling Brownie with Ice Cream, Cold Coffee and Chicken Tender. 
üí•Sizzling Brownie with Ice Cream - was PERFECT ! üòç The brownie was so soft. And the ice cream tasted yum with it. 

üí•Cold Coffee - was prepared really well. Good yet not too sweet. Loved the blend.

üí•Chicken Tender - was okay. It could have been made better. It was not worth the price. So that's a disappointment. 

Service - The staffs were courteous and hospitality is commendable. Only thing is they must be well informed about the dishes and their availability. And they should be more synchronized.

To spend a nice evening, you may pay a visit here. ‚ò∫ Worth it !

This place was wishlisted for a long time and finally we visited here.
This is a very popular cafe and we loved everything about it.
It is located just in the lane opposite to forum mall.
The interior is very pretty with big windows,beautiful lights and wall paintings.The soothing english classic music adds to the mood.
All day breakfast menu is available and we took a masala omelette platter.
For maincourse,we took Chicken foriestire.
There are many veg items and our friend took a customised veg penne pasta in mixed sauce.
The desserts are the main attractions here surely.

‚Ä¢Masala Omelette platter-A big spiced up omelette served with four pieces of toast,butter,roasted tomato and mashed potato.It is a wholesome platter and we both loved it.

‚Ä¢Penne pasta in mixed sauce with corn,mushroom and brocoli-My vegeterian friend took this and appreciated it a lot.Good amount of pasta is served with garlic bread.We tasted it and it is extremely lip smacking.

‚Ä¢Chicken Foriestire steak-For maincourse,we both had this delicious steak.Four pieces of chicken breast stuffed with mushroom and minced meat is served with butter rice and salad.The chicken pieces are succulent and the gravy is amazing.Recommended.

We had two types of dessets here-
‚Ä¢The Classic Waffle with ice cream-Four pieces of fresh waffles served with chocolate sauce.We took ice cream add on.Waffles are fresh and amazing.

‚Ä¢The Berry Pancakes-Three pieces of fluffy pancakes served with berries and maple syrup.Desserts are must try here.

Prices are reasonable.
Service is prompt and staffs are friendly.
Pocket pinch for a good meal-800-1000/- for two. üòä

NICE experience. Especially with the ambiance and service. LOVED the windows and old school Coffee Shop feel. Food was decent and very fresh and good quality ingredients were used. Apple Pie was EXCELLENT. My only concern was the Italian Tomato Sauce served on the side with Bangers and Mash. It felt odd and out of the place. Bangers and Mash is a traditional dish from Britain which usually consists of Pork Sausages and Mashed Potatoes with some gravy. The Country House version was VERY STRANGE. All though the chicken sausages were good quality and the mashed potato was delicious, the Italian sauce made NO sense. Just some sauteed peas on the side with onion gravy would have been GREAT. But never the less I had a GOOD time.

Crispy on the outside and succulent from the inside...  i tried pancakes for the first time so I don't know how are they suppose to taste.. I didn't find them great. Ok ok types. And the cindrella mocktail.. blah.. didn't like it. The pricing is ok.

We ordered the classic nutella waffles. It was warm, crunchy and super delicious. I wish they had more options for the non vegetarians. Their veg menu is pretty elaborate which is quite obviously stated in the menu. Anyway this place is a must try for all the waffles and crepe lovers.

Located just the lane opposite to the elgin forum mall front gate this place just won my heart.
The decor of the place is very elegant.and classy..along with full of cuteness.
The food are too good.
The items are very much pocket friendly.
But they have not compromised with the quality of food.
And the behaviours of the staffs are very polite with great service.
The food quality need to be mentioned..
 I Ordered 5 items
1)The bangers and mash platter-An elegant dish with smashed potatoes, sausages and a special sauce.
2)Mushroom Burgundian - A must try dish for mushroom lovers..
A dish of dried mushrooms stirred in sauce served with the sauce and toast. Just wonderful in taste.
3)Chilly cheese toast - A common item, i ordered it as it is my favourite. And i was pleased by the taste.
4) Caesar Salad - A healthy salad and great in taste
5) The Classic way waffles with choclate sauce - It is a must try..and its taste is great.
My bill amount was Rs 1068 all inclusives.
It is a perfct place to visit with friends, family and for dates.
They also have private section for arranging small get togethers and party.
They have a separate breakfast menu ., which i m planning to visit soon..
Overall this place is a must visit for those who love english breakfasts and different types of continental dishes.

This place was on my wishlist due to a number of positive reviews from my friends and so one fine evening, I entered it. Located just opposite forum mall on Allenby road, on the right foot.
The decor was very elegant and based on the theme of recycling. Bicycle rods being the raw materials, well painted(hand painted) walls and old brickwork and old Calcutta ceilings painted to perfection.
Coming to the food, we ordered sizzling brownie, cold coffee, choco shake and chicken tender.
Brownie was simply awesome and so were the shakes with perfect texture and smoothness
I was disappointed with the chicken tender and thot it could have been done much better.
The staff were courteous but confused about the availability of dishes.
This review could have been a 4 or 4.5 but falls short due to non-availability of many non veg dishes, they should work on this.
Overall, its a good place to hangout with friends or Ur partner widin an affordable budget.

So, I'm now a frequent visitor to this cafe and it's absolute love. This was my 3rd visit. It's a cute little cafe located in the lane just opposite forum. The ambience is nice, the staffs r extremely courteous and the food is just so yummm! 
Must try are: chicken caesar salad, chicken foriestier, Pollo ala marasala and Rana Pescitice.
I would like to mention Rana Pescitice is slow cooked fish fillet n comes with a white gravy. The fish was extremely well cooked...It was tender and eid jut melt in your mouth. It's a must must try.
The mocktails r nice too.
I would recommend this place to everyone and it's a great hangout place with friends.

This place was bookmarked since a very long time. So I finally decided to visit this place. The ambiance of this place is mesmerizing from the dec√≥r to the tables. Coming to the food. I ordered a nachos which came with a cheese dip. It was nice but nothing extraordinary. I had a mixed sauce pasta which was up-to the mark. Next I had sizzling brownie with ice cream which was delicious. 
I also had a nutella pancake which was mouth watering. The staff was very courteous. You must definitely visit this place if you are in that area.

Went on a Sunday for lunch with my patents. The interiors were well done and the staff was friendly. Coming to the food directly, it was a very bad experience. We ordered the mushroom stroganoff, Italian sizzler and berry all the way waffles with extra ice cream and chocolate sauce.
The quantity was very less for both the main course. The  sizzler tasted more like a Mexican sizzler rather than an Italian. Also the waiters aren't trained in serving and spilled some portion of the already less quantity sizzler. The mushroom stroganoff was also just average. The waffles were good due to the extra toppings without which it would be average. There are much better options available like Jalape√±os for sizzlers, Piccadilly square for waffles, etc. 
Will definitely not visit again.

That was also not very extraordinary. The foods are overpriced with not so remarkable taste. But tge decor and ambience is only plus point

Easy to locate. It is in the opposite lane of Forum Mall, Elgin Road.

Easy to find in the lane.

You start feeling fresh from the outer look itself.

It is an old heritage house converted to house this restaurant.

Lovely decor and wonderful ambience.

Makes one feel good.

Usually hep and young crowd can be seen.

The whole setting seems so minimalist yet artistic.

All walls painted white.

Light hangings are cools too. So when the sun is not there then the whole restaurant gets a good colour change.

We ate mushroom starter, garlic bread, pizza, sizzler, burger, watermelon juice, cold coffee, waffle. Indeed we ate a lot because everything was so yummy and greater than expectations.

Service takes time.

This is a new restaurant so the people here need to learn much more but then they do much more than they can. They do all they can.

This place is a must visit and highly recommended by me.

I had Berry All The Way and Arancini Balls, along with Iced Cappuccino and a Mango Litchi Drink. Waffles were really good, just required another dip other than honey. Arancini balls had nice flavours and the salsa complemented the dish. Mango Litchi Drink was refreshing but the Cappuccino was quite runny, lacked the coffee flavour. Other than food ambience was alright and good staff.

I went there with two of my friends and ordered a few things...
The shakes (kit-kat shake and brownie shake) were okay.
Next came mix-sauce pasta. Least I could say, it was horrible... Pasta as well as the veggies (hardly there) were undercooked... So if you plan on visiting this place, I would recommend you not to order pasta...
Next was, Exotic Veggie Pizza. It was good.
And then we had Home-made Chocolate waffles. It was disappointing again...the waffle was too crispy for my taste and difficult to cut...

However, the decor was really cute and cozy and also good for pictures...we clicked one too many... üòù
The staff are well-mannered too.

Went with my friend.It was a very easy to locate place.Opposite cream center and forum mall.An amazing outlet for breakfast.They have a wide variety.The cheese and mushroom crepes was good but being a cheese and mushroom fan it did not satisfy my taste buds too much.I have had way better of these.The other items were good.Whats really good is the ambiance.Its quiet and peaceful.The food took around 20mins to come which was little annoying.The money is worth it.One must try their omlette.Really good.Opens quite early too.Good for a breakfast option with friends.

Location-Take the road exactly opposite Forum mall(Allenby road).Walk for a few minutes.The caf√© should fall to your right.

Ambience-A 120 year old vintage building has been restored and made into this caf√©.The caf√© has retained it's old world charm with pops of vibrance in the form of wall-art,graffiti and a bicycle suspended from one of the walls.The interiors are classy, minimalistic and the overall ambience is extremely soothing.PERFECT for languid conversation over a lazy breakfast.

FOOD-I had dropped in here,rain-soaked and famished,after running some errands nearby.I ordered their eponymous bestseller,the nutella waffles and also nutella crepes,because why not?Nutella all the way!!

NUTELLA CREPE(3.5/5)-The crepe was tasty but could have been thinner.The nutella filling and accompanying chocolate fudge sauce was totally on point though.

NUTELLA WAFFLE(5/5)-This was my first time trying out waffles and I've completely fallen in love with the ones this place has to offer.Crisp and golden on the outside,chewy in the middle,with a generous smear of nutella on top and chocolate fudge sauce to pour over-this dish was perfection on a plate.Also,this is one of the very few caf√©s that offer 4 big pieces of waffles per plate.Order a scoop of icecream on the side to give respite to your pallette.

Price-Slightly overpriced.I mean a single aloo paratha for more than 150 rupees after taxes isn't a reasonable deal.

Service-Extremely courteous staff with prompt service.

Verdict-If you're looking for the best waffles in the city, now you know where to head to.Perfect for solo brunches too.

Such a pretty interior. The rustic touch, whitewashed walls, mugs, shelves and frames adorn those walls.. huge arched windows, with lots of lampshades hanging .. you get the best ambience here. Kudos to that .
As I climbed the stairs the vibrant graffiti wall..wow. it would attract anyone.
The staff needs special mention here, they are extremely helpful and cooperative. Since I wasn't sure of how many of my friends would turn up.. I had asked them to arrange for chairs, they right away joined a table and we had ample seats to be accommodated. Also they had out my phone on charge and brought to me as and whenever it rang. 
Amazing. Hardly have seen such helpful people around :)
We ordered for an Americano (black coffee) , Belgian waffles with berries and chocolate sauce, and a vegetable ranch burger, with fries and coleslaw.
The burger could have been a better version. But otherwise loved the waffles and the coffee.
Soon will be back for the pancakes üòç

Menu is pretty impressive and up for any kind of mood. And I was in a mood for salad and my friend was in a mood for pasta. Both were equally good. I usually don't like mixed sauce of every place, but this place did impress me. 
The Brownie Shake was amazing. Kitkat shake was normal. Rather order two brownie shake. üòã

I'm really sorry for being this harsh but it was just super disappointing. How on earth can this place have 4 star rating, not at all worth. The options are mostly veg just they have added 5 chicken items and claim they serve non-veg, well noooo that's not called serving non-veg. The veg items are very average nothing great and the veggies are mostly raw. The pasta was like damn bad and again no non-veg options available in it. Only thing nice were the shakes, the brownie one is nice and so is the cold coffee.¬†
*Warning if you are a non-veg lover don't come here and waste your money.

There is nothing to dislike about this place. 
Food is excellent. I've tried several items and none of them were short of excellent. The decor is so vintage and aesthetic, especially the wall paintings and the ceiling is otherworldly with the black chandeliers. Their music is a plus, too! I do wish they offered more in their non-vegetarian menu, though. This is also one of the only places which serve the entire waffle and not just half!

It's a nice quaint place with a refreshing feel. The cafe has a small patisserie in the ground floor and the main cafe is on the first floor. The walls are done in white with an English feel. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly, always greeting with a smile. Since, I'd gone to meet a couple of friends for a short span of time, we didn't really order much. We ordered a cafe cappuccino, the berry waffle and the veg burger, which had an aloo patty served with lettuce and tomatoes,mayonnaise and cheese, with a side of french fries and coleslaw. The taste was good. However, I'd like a little more variety on offer.
Also, they have wall graffiti which gives a perfect background for selfies!

The ambience of country house is great. There are long French windows and the interiors are mostly blue and white. We had coffee , that was made well , Nutella pancakes with generous helping of Nutella and soft pancakes with chocolate sauce. The pancakes I found were not cooked completely , as they were still a bit sticky. We also had chicken and waffles which was not that good. The chicken was undercooked and the ranch dressing was basically sour cream with pepper and salt in it. Food wise not a very good experience. The place gets its ratings mostly because of the ambience and the staff. It is pocket friendly.

It has pleasant ambience and spacious seating arrangement.
It specialises primarily in breakfast meal, so if you find yourself early in the morning in this area, you can start your day here.
Staff is excellent in their conduct.
The taste of food is going to tickle your tongue for good.
And my favourite dessert brownie was perfectly served and delicious!

Country House is a beautifully designed little nook in the corner of all the bustles of Calcutta at Elgin. 
It's colours do not hurt the eyes, and the white and blue chairs beckon you to sit and have yourself a royal breakfast. 
I bumped into Country House on a day when I felt a little lost. I came in, set my laptop down and started scribbling the short story that had ruined my sleep last night. 
The staff didn't disturb, there was a blessed silence, until the customers from my adjacent table started howling with laughter. I was reminded of a pack of hyenas. You see, you live in a city where people are so drunk on their personal revelry, they refuse to give the same personal space to another. For that, my ambience was spoiled. 

But that sadness was only temporary, for soon a plate of the most delicious Nutella pancakes came my way and I demolished them with fervour. 

Satisfied once again, I find my way back to my story, writing about people and their conversations, and the cafe gives me warmth I have longed for.

A beautifully decorated cafe at Elgin. From graffiti walls to beautifully lit up ceilings, the place has a cozy ambience altogether and is quite spacious. Ordered their classic waffle and nutella waffle, both with chocolate sauce n needless to say both of them were lip smacking good, served hot and fresh. I would definitely love to visit the place again to try their Italian cuisines.

They have a wide variety of dishes, each one of them sounds as tasty as anything but I had Hot dog sandwich, Spicy cottage cheese sandwich, Caeser Salad and American Ranch Burger. I would recommend the burgers, as it was really delicious also the spicy cottage cheese sandwich. The ambiance is like old British Cottage, you will feel out of the world.

I was here last night with my friends.The ambience and decor of the place is classy.The waiters are very polite and decent.
We ordered Arancini balls,Cheesy Garlic bread,Exotic veggie pizza,Waffles & Dark Chocolate cold coffee.
Arancini balls were just so tasteless and the tomato sauce over it smelt raw,maybe not cooked properly.
I had ordered waffles with chocolate sauce.They gave us 1tbsp of chocolate sauce with 4 pieces of waffles...LOLü§£
While the pizza,garlic bread and dark chocolate cold coffee was yummyüòã
Would definitely recommend this place to my friends‚ò∫Ô∏è

A house tucked into not so much of an alley a part of which has been remodelled and converted to this amazing breakfast outlet is a great thumbs up!!!!
Right on entering , u feel the vibe come to you, the eclectic mish and mash of the days gone by and the days coming up.... The stairs retain their charm, n the sitting area is lovely with the morning sun filtering thru d long windows dt hv bn preserved..each element hs bn kept raw n hardly retouched,so u cn imagine how life inside this house must hv bn once
The service is great right from the beginning‚Äã, with them serving water and quick delivery. The food is fresh n inviting, as u look out d window n muse... 
We had brusschettas, pancakes waffles , coffee n darjeeltea n frittata... Each element was lovely ...overall a very nice morning spent in a part of Kolkata dt remains true to its roots...
P.s. im specially impressed dt they took d time n effort to put my dying phone to charge n bringing my phn bck whenever a call came... Such shud b hospitality... U made me feel like home... Thank you..these small things go a long way...

It's been a while since I went to this place but I REALLY want to go back, and that too just for the decor and ambience this place provides, it was just beautiful, the moment I saw those white washed walls and rustic furniture I knew I had to come back here with a book and spend some hours here.

The desserts were equally good, I had pancakes and waffles and both were above par. Hopefully I'll make it back here on a lazy saturday or sunday afternoon and finish a book while having pancakes and sipping some coffee. :D

Hope they don't throw me out for staying too long :P

Ok..let me start by saying that this place has the best d√©cor out of all the eateries I have visited in the recent past. It immediately uplifts your mood and make you ready for your food which by the way is Delicious! I was with a friend and we had ordered a foriestire, a cheese pasta, one Oreo shake, a watermelon basil cooler and one pancake. All the items were great. In most of the places when you ask for juices, they serve you tropicana but not here. The watermelon cooler was great to say the least. I do not have a sweet tooth but the pancake left me wanting for more. It was awesome. But I would have rated them more if their food portions were a bit larger. On a hungry stomach, the quantity of food will disappoint  you. That is my only serious complain. Otherwise, what a place! üòÄ

The staff is actually good and very responsive to customer issues. 
We ordered a very simple item- Nachos.
Definitely not homemade, they actually seemed like bingo mad angles with oodles of unhealthy mayonnaise and chopped tomatoes.
I can make a better version of that at home.

Located in Elgin,Kolkata. The lane opposite forum mall, it's easy to locate. Talking about the decor and feel is really pretty , attractive and very aesthetic. The service was quick. Surely a great place to hang out with friends and loved ones.
The menu mainly consists of veg and egg items with some non-veg items. We went there to try out their breakfast menu
Beverages:
#Caramel Cold Coffee (4.5/5)

# Watermelon Basil Cooler (4/5)

Food:
#Nachos which was really good in taste and fresh

# We ordered for Nutella Pancakes but instead received Nutella Waffles . The Waffles were good in taste which were served with maple syrup.

Our disappointment was with the order which we gave and we got was different . I couldn't make out why did it happen and also they billed for Nutella Pancakes only . The bill was around 1100.

This is the go-to place for a cozy romantic supper. From mushroom cheese crepe, thin crust pizza, stir fried veggies, garlic bread, to honey cinnamon coffee- every dishes were so delicious. Even their non veg dishes Chicken Tender and Chicken Stroganoff were mouth watering. The service was also very good.

Food - Talking of the the menu, it is mainly veg and egg oriented including some chicken dishes. But with the less variety of menu whatever exists is a complete bliss. The quality and taste both are good. We ordered chicken strogonoff which was quite good (the rice tasted better than the chicken), chicken caesar salad is also a kick start and nutella waffles were just yummmm! 

Ambience - Nice decor. The slow music is soothing. Surely a nice place to hang around.

Service - Attendants are well behaved and helpful. 

Rate - Appropriate rates. Perfect with the taste of food.

I didn't like the place. Food was okay. For egg based dishes the nearby Biker's Cafe is better. We ate waffles, French Benedict, and Fritatta . I'ved had better Fritatta- it should be presented whole, and should have more veggies; could not taste the sauasages that were supposed to be there. Same goes for french benedict, nothing special.

Went here for breakfast with a friend and both of us enjoyed this place immensely.
I had an English coleslaw sandwich and iced black coffee and my friend had a very berry pancake and a caramel cold coffee. Well presented and of good taste.
If you're going for a morning show at forum, I'd suggest you have breakfast here first. Gave me a good memory.

The sizzler took more than 45min.. when we told them to cancel there was a very cassual approach for cancelling it..
New plates were not replaced.. ketchup waa not served... horrible service.. i have always been here before in presence of owner and he has been so nice.. but his staffs r horrible

The Country House Caf√© is a comfortably small yet tastefully decorated quaint little caf√© at Allenby Road, near Forum Mall.
First things first :
I absolutely adore the ambience....(check-out the photographs to know why!) The food was fresh and tasty.
Things that we ordered :
1) Fries Basket
2) Exotic Grilled Veggie Sandwich
3) Caramel Cold Coffee
4) Spaghetti Aglio Olio
5) Watermelon Basil Cooler
( Total bill was somewhat around Rs.1150 )

I loved the Caramel Cold Coffee (5/5!)
The spaghetti tasted good ( it was spicy !) ( P.S- I'm personally not a big fan of Aglio Olio ) ; The watermelon basil cooler was refreshing; Fries and wedges were crisp for long ( I liked the dip ) ; The sandwiches were fine ( really big though! )

I'm definitely going to visit this place again & I highly recommend it for you too !
Bon Appetit!!!

It's a cozy place to relax and enjoy some great food. It's easy to locate, it is located in the lane opposite forum mall, near Cream centre.
 The interiors are absolutely wonderful, the interior is similar to that of a country house (hence the name).
We ordered nachos, iced cappuccino and cranberry cocktail. The Nachos are heavenly. Topped with generous amount of nacho dip plus they serve it with cheese dipüòçüòçüòçüòç
The cappuccino tasted nice too
Only the consistency of the cappuccino was too thin because they put too much ice in it.
Loved the cranberry cocktail and the subtle flavour of ginger in it.
Overall a good experience.
Would love to visit again anytime soon‚ù§

Situated just opposite to the bylane of forum mall towards Elgin road..the cafe is really good..I visited it twice and I really liked their ambience. The food was good specially the item fried chicken with savoury waffles..I loved that so much that i actually went for it the next day again..i would say it has perfect items for English breakfast and their mocktails of which I had the virgin mojito was very refreshing to beat the heat during summer!

A cozy yet elegant place, situated in a tricky galli of Elgin road, it has a funky decor with bicycle on walls, vintage brick look etc. Coming to the food, it was a bit pricey but totally worth it. We had brownie shake and choco-chip pancake. Both were great. We had a grilled chicken dish and the only fish dish available in the menu which was unique, fresh, crisp and soaked in a delicious cornflour sauce. Though it doesn't have a myriad of non-veg dishes, the foods available still tastes great. A must try for veg lovers. They also provide a cute loyalty card.

Yummilicious food. Every time I go to this place I always order the choose your own pasta with white sauce. They make it really good. This time i went to try out their breakfast menu and they have so many choices at such affordable prices that it becomes tough to choose. We ordered the mexican crepes, spinach and corn toast, all berry waffles, coffee latte, orange juice, watermelon juice. All the items were great. They have eggless waffles and pancakes which was a plus point for my veg friends. The waffles were very yummy and buttery. All in all its a great place. Loved the food and the quality and quantity. 

In my next visit i ordered the pancakes with berries.  They were very fliffy and delicous.  Comes in three pancakes per plate.  However i would still suggest this place is the best place to try waffles. The nonveg preparations are also good.  Tried the chicken finger fries which were very dilicious!

There are good cafes. Then there are bad ones. The Country House forces us to form another category: 'Outright disgusting'
A good rating on zomato convinced me to visit this place near my home. But by the time we were done, I badly regretted spoiling an otherwise perfect evening by coming here.
The only good thing about this place is its environment and interior decoration. The walls are well adorned with painting, props and a bicycle glued to it. The ambiance is pleasant, and they even offer board games for entertainment.
Sadly, this is where this list ends.
We ordered a Hot Chocolate, Chicken Tender, Monte Carlo and Bangers and mash. With each order, we hoped that it would turn out to be less disappointing than the previous one.We were disappointed yet again. The chicken tender was hard and the quantity was too less to justify the price(as were the other dishes, too). The hot chocolate looked great (as you can see in the picture), but it tasted worse than a glass of badly mixed Bournvita. There was clearly no chocolate in the drink. It was plain milk, mixed with something that might only remotely taste like cocoa or hot chocolate. Seriously, I could have stayed at home and made myself a glass of Protein X instead! Easily qualifies as the worst (fake) 'hot chocolate' I've ever had. Bangers and mash were the only dish that remotely succeeded in being satisfactory. Nothing special about them, though. Lastly, the Monte Carlo was the final nail in the coffin for irrevocably ruining the experience. The menu clearly states that it's "Chocolate cake served with vanilla ice-cream, chocolate sauce and whipped cream". In reality, it was a tasteless mixture of a stale, plain cake covered with cream and ice-cream with NO sign of chocolate sauce anywhere. Without a shred of doubt, the dessert did not contain even a drop of chocolate sauce in it's entire (meagre) volume. Honestly, the chocolate sauce was the only ingredient that gave me the courage to order this. As a result, we were too outraged and felt swindled. Nice little trick there, to fool customers with seductive descriptions that do not remotely match what they actually serve. Even by low standards, this place has left a disgustingly poor impression on our minds, and we'll know better than to go anywhere near this place again. After a bill of over Rs 800 and zero satisfaction, we learnt a lesson: 'Never trust ratings blindly'. Really disappointing!

I think the best thing about this place is the ambiance and the decor,for while you're in here,you might often forget that you're actually sitting at a cafe in Kolkata...as the daylight wanes,the azure glow that encompasses this place is enchanting...This is the go-to place for a cozy romantic supper...oh,I can harp about the place for aeons.Coming to the food,I visited the place with my camaraderie,so the orders were diverse,ranging from lasagna,thin crust pizza,stir fried veggies,garlic bread,to honey cinnamon coffee,hot chocolate,watermelon smoothie,chocolate shake and iced tea.Of these,it was the pizza and garlic bread that i loved.For the other preparations,the quantities were stingy,given the prices and the fact that they are all veg preparations.The lasagna seemed too runny and the stir fried veggies were barely enough for the five of us.The pocket pinch is on the higher side,a whopping 2400 bucks including service charges and taxes.

The best thing about this place is the lovely ambience. Every other department has rooms for improvement.

Well, they have introduced non vegetarian options recently hence the choices are limited. 

We had ordered a Chicken Tender and Chicken Strogonoff. The 1st one was good but the 2nd dish was just average. Portion sizes could have been better for both the dishes. 

From the Mocktail section, we ordered a Cindrella, which was supposed to be "A perfect mix of mango, litchi and watermelon" , however it tasted like a not so perfect mix of maaza and slice. 

The salt pepper cellars were dirty. They changed the cellars when we pointed out the same. The plate of Tender Chicken had a dead fly, which again we pointed out and they looked at us apologetically. 

Finally, when we were leaving, we could hear a drunk person abusing in the kitchen.  Left us wondering about the food ethics followed there.

Not a good experience.

Visited this outlet today fr lunch!!
I must admit m completely impressed by the ambience..an old house turned into a cafe..a place where u can sit n enjoy ur meal..
One can have a look of the surroundings from the window..the walls and the kettles turned into a tree holder to the bulbs,paintings and an cycle fixed to the wall,chairs..al this made this place one of my favorites!!

Well behaved staff..serving and attending the customers wd a smile..

Now coming to the food..
Ordered a mocktail,n for mains we ordered chicken ala keiv,italian sizzler...
The food was too good ,filling..
N now comes the show stopper!! 
The sizzling brownie wd ice cream fr desserts!

The person brought the sizzler plate on our table,placed the brownie n icecream n added the sauce..the sizzling sound will add an extra smile to a brownie lovers face!!

A great food experience..highly recommended..
Will love to see more nonveg food items..

The food (we had a pancake) is quite good and so is the coffee. The non-vegetarian menu is a welcome addition too! A small flight of wooden stairs takes you to the cafe which is on the first floor. The white brick walls bring a Victorian feel, although a flourescent blue bicycle on the wall looks out of place.

Starting my review with a slight intro about the place .A warm and a happening place with a very jolly ambiance . A Warm welcome by the people working there from the starting till the end of our meal .
I have visited this place 4 to 5 times and each time my experience was really good. Talking about the food ,I would brief all my experiences and write about the best dishes . Starting  with the cheese garlic bread (full justice to cheese)üòä , nachos is a good option, *nepoliana potato croquettes* stands out of the box , but  out of all of them the dish that excited my taste buds was the *creamy mushroom risotto* -really creamy ,√†rborio rice cooked perfectly in cream and cheese with chunks of mushroom coming in your mouth(mushroom lovers - a must try) . Coming to the dessert *Monte Carlo* and red velvet cake is really good. These dishes are the must try ones though i have tried the Mediterranean pizza and Italian sizzler and many more but the former simply stands out .
Simply a very good experience . Deserves a repetitive visit. Will make non-vegetarians fall in love with vegetarian food .

Its one of the very rare cafes in Kolkata, were you would like to chill for sometime without hookah's smoke around you. A very peaceful place. Clean, well maintained and decor is amazing. I would recommend trying brownie shake and their pizzas. The more I visit this place, the fonder i grow for it.

This is located at opposite side of Elgin road, Forum Mall. I saw there menu's in zomato. Specially visited this place for shakes, mocktails, and dessert.

If you want to hangout with your friends in pocket-friendly restaurant or if you want to spend some romantic time with your partner then you can also come here. For both reason you can come here. Nice decoration with slowly melodies music and songs,lots of creativity has done on the wall. 

Stuffs are too good,they can suggest you the best dishes which is suitable for you and your choices.  

There shakes, mocktails and desserts are too good. Stuffs are very friendly and always give you best suggestion.  Want to visit here again :D :D

The ambience of the place was amazing and also the food was delicious. There were also board games available for their customers so that they have something to do while waiting for their order to get served. Though we did not have a wait for much long as their service was pretty fast. It was a good experience and i would really like to recommend everyone to visit the place.

This Friday it was The Country House with Neelakshi Chatterjee.We were hungry and wanted to grab a quick bite and also relax after a long day.We chose this place, opposite to Forum and we were really taken aback by the decor and the food at this quaint outlet.Such a small place but beautifully done with white walls, black windows, statement decor.The place exudes warmth and the decor adds to the comfort.With the right kind of music, we started unwinding with Earl Grey black tea and Virgin Mojito.I loved the glass jar in which the cooler was served.We ordered the Bruschetta, Chicken Tender and The Classic Waffle with maple syrup. Service is prompt and quickly the Bruschetta arrived, garlic bread topped with mushroom and tomatoes and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. The dish looked and tasted great.As we were raving about the mushroom topping, the Chicken Tender arrived and gustoso! It was one of the best chicken preparations I had in a long time.The outer batter was beautifully done and it was served with a mayo and sauce dip.The waffles were truly classic, baked to perfection and with the maple syrup, it tasted perfect. Overall it was a great meal.The staff was really helpful, polite and had a perpetual smile on their faces.The place serves more of the vegetarian platter and has lesser options in Chicken, but we were thoroughly satisfied with everything.They gave us a loyalty card, and definitely, I am planning a visit soon!

Forcefully taken by a friend to especially have Monte Carlo. I wasn't sure why was she so exited about this dessert initially but after having it, I understood the reason. It was really amazing. A nice ambience is what you can expect out of this place. Lovely colourful atmosphere will refresh your mind. The Algio Olio was also decent. Would love to visit again to try out different dishes there.

This is one of the best places in town if you're one of those 'all day breakfast' persons. Pancakes, Sandwiches, Waffles, Pasta.. You name it, they have it. I was a little hesitant in going to this place especially because of the loud sheesha cafes in the city, which I usually go to. But if you're looking for a quiet, different, new kind of experience in Kolkata, this is deffo the place to be. The staff is very courteous and the food (especially the pancakes) is impeccable.

I love this place in all respects- Food, ambience, interiors, menu options and the overall feel of the cafe is so chic and vintage. We started with smoked tomato basil soup which was accompanied by the nicest of bread croutons with a slight hint of cheese (tasted perfect!) Then we planned to order this amazing Italian sizzler (picture attached) which had fettuccini in red sauce accompanied with exotic veggies and Arancini (rice and cheese balls). Now, the surprise element in the menu was their variety of white tea that they had to offer not available in any cafe in Kolkata I suppose. White tea is supposed to be the ultimate kind of tea which aids in weight loss. So I settled with moonshine white tea. All in all, it's gonna be my next favourite spot for relaxation.

Okay so...recently my friend and I decided to visit this cafe situated in the lane just opposite to Forum mall. It's a two storeyed white building with a patisserie right in front of the entrance. We were welcomed by smiling staffs. The interior is vibrant which peps you right away. The decor also include a cycle hung on one wall which looked qwerty and fun! The food was served within minutes of ordering which was impressive. There are board games too which include monopoly jenga etc. A wooden staircase takes one on a floor where the walls are painted in bold colors and also has a sofa seating arrangement. All in all a nice place to hangout for the first time. The desserts are good on the menu. Specially the Nutella crepe. Me being a non vegetarian wasn't fond of the veg sizzler though:-p. The coolers and shakes are okay...

Visited this place after participating for a marathon wit friends.We were famished. As the name suggests it has country house kinda feel.Old english style ambience and a pleasant well lit place.We quickly ordered and had to wait for 45 min for our 1st order to arrive ( that too after lot of enquiries) .Sandwich was delicious. The grilled vegetable blended well and the sauses were just right with rich creamy flavours. Now again the 2nd dish arrived after waiting and enquiring . Aalo parantha was spicy and tasty (minus the curd which we requested them for). Crepes came again after waiting a little longer and was average and we wanted to cancel d 4th order (omelette) since we had lost our patience . The staff was courteous and prompt , I guess it was the kitchen which was moving at a snail pace. So overall wud love to visit again and wish they giVe me a speedy service.

Went again yesterday for breakfast .Food is good. Service remains slow as before..

Food is hats off amazing. Started with nachos which was super. Had a different way of serving which when mixed gave the taste buds a super taste. The pizza was exceptional. The sauce used as the base was wow. These two are just tries. The chilli cheese toast along with their speciality sandwich, was okay, it could have been made better. The mushroom skewer was alright but the creamy mushroom risotto, is a must have. Had ordered two portions and it was all done in a matter of minutes. The virgin moito was again very very good along with the presentation. The ambience is super and the service is fast. Will surely come back to try more items.

Very poor service. We made a reservation for 15 people but were surprised when we were asked to accommodate in an area which could hardly fit in 10 people. Even after booking the private area well in advance it was not available. The food is also not that great. They promised to provide a cracker candle along with the birthday cake. However, even that was not available. Would certainly not recommend this place in case you are planning a small private party/ birthday celebration.

Lovely place....from the first look at the white old style bungalow one is impressed. On entering, on one side there is the bakery counter with assorted pastries and cakes and the other a staircase leading to the sitting area above. The banisters, once again old style. The bright colour mural on the wall of the staircase prepares you for more quirkiness in the decor. The big glad paned windows bring in natural light and at the same time one can gaze at the world going by while relaxing over good food and beverages. The quirkiness is exemplified by the bicycle mounted on one wall. The aluminium kettles functioning as planters and the tables and chairs. The lights above too are interesting. So this sets us up for the food experience. Which I must say was a really happy one. Everything we had was excellent. The arrancini balls were delicious with hot molten cheese inside. The mains , Italian sizzler too was good. Though I felt it it could have been a tad less spicy. Both the drinks were excellent, the ginger cooler was really refreshing and the cookie shake was chocolatey and rich. 
The staff were courteous and solicitous asking our opinions on the dishes and whether we wanted any changes.
All in all a good food experience.....will definitely go back to taste other items.

Disappointed. Cold coffee was too watery. Lemon cake seemed hard, hence stale. The sizzling brownie was the saving grace. The interiors were so good but the quality of food and beverages served dampened the entire atmosphere created by an otherwise good layout supported by a prime location. Hope you improve your coffees. Until next time, adios!

As I had to treat a friend this morning, The Country House was my choice as it's one of the few caf√©s which opens up early. As expected, when we entered the cafe, it was all empty, but the ambiance was really a mood settler, it is one of a kind. The staff is friendly and eager to help. Food was up to the mark. I tried cottage cheese sizzler and garlic bread. Overall the experience was good. Would surely like to give out another try.

Tried out this place for weekend breakfast. The place has a happy feel with nice french windows. It had delightful shakes, nice food with sumptuous portions , and good service - sums up the experience doesn't it. I would like to try the desserts sometime. The place should definitely feature in breakfast collection of Zomato! Thanks to the owner for helping us around. Good work, cheers!

On being invited by the owners to the coffee shop again to try the experience, I must say, it was a sea change of what my last time was.

The first drink was the server suggested Watermelon and Basil Cooler. It was refreshing to say the least. The sweetness of the watermelon, with the aromatic mint and basil, made a little clubby with soda was just the need in a really hot sweltering Kolkata day.

The next was a cottage cheese sizzler. The potato Patti were McCain - thus a but disappointing, but the paneer skewers and the Mexican rice accompanying it were good. The paneer was soft and succulent, the veggies perfectly grilled.

We finished it off with a dark chocolate frappe. And this was the star of the show. Dark, decadent and rich, just like a coffee should be.

So in all, they erased the past and brought out the new memories.

Do visit for their drinks and kitchy decor!!

It was just a sudden plan, Asia was a industrialist strike, so many restaurants were closed near my office. We went there for lunch but in the evening, with friends. Location is easy to find, just opposite lane of forum mall. Staffs were welcoming. Place was divided into sections, for a bigger group also they had place. We were famished. We had ordered Nachos, mix sauce penne pasta, cottage steak Sizzler, chocolate shake, Burger. Food was yummy and delicious. Service was fast. They also had a bakery section.

Located on the lane just opposite the entrance of forum mall, it's a good place to drop in after your shopping given the limited options for a cuppa at the mall. The building that houses this cafe looks like an old Bengali traditional home with high ceilings, wooden suitcases and large windows to people watch. The white walls are styled with eclectic decor and yet it blends well with the original character of this lovely house.  The cafe and bakery serves the usual cafe food and cooks up breakfast only on Friday through Sunday, 8am. 
I had a sandwich, a brownie and a pastry and a good cup of Darjeeling green tea made to my specification. 
For a place that uses bakery as a describer, there is some more handwork that may be required to impress. The food is good but nothing extraordinary.The staff I must admit are attentive and very warm. 

Overall a charming place to drop in for a coffee for solo reading or a catch up with friends.

We, a group of 14 people went for breakfast and the service was very bad. I don't think it takes an hour to make an omelette and to serve water. I did not expect this from such a well-known cafe/restaurant.
Secondly, please tell your waiters/waitresses to have an idea of all the dishes so that if a person does not know what will be the ingredients in a spanish omelette, he does not get a reply like 'Sir there will be spanish and omelette '(at least that was the reply from your waitress).
Please try to improve your service.

I stumbled across this place on Saturday. 

As I entered, the ambience caught my attention.
I loved the fact that the place was lit up by natural light. It added to the beauty of the place. 

The service was very impressive. 
We were provided with water as we were seated. Which usually doesn't happen in most places.

Our order was taken in no time and the food arrived even faster. 
The portions are great.

I absolutely enjoyed the mixed sauce pasta with mushrooms,baby corn and saut√©ed onions. 
The nachos was good. 
How nachos should be. The mock tails were also pretty much like other places. 

The only criticism is that the menu is very small and limited. 
Maybe expand the menu more. 
It's nice to have more options. 

Overall it was a great experience. 

PS this place doesn't serve non vegetarian food. 
I was forced to eat here because of my friends. 
But to my surprise I enjoyed it.

As soon as you enter, you climb up to the graffiti wall well done with bright colours, first feeling is pleasant. When you get up to the first floor, you start observing the make up. Traditional Windows, brick walls, family table one step up at the mezzanine. Old day switches, traditional light hangings yet the feel is contemporary. 

The staff are on their toes all the time. Since it's a 30 seater, it's slightly loud but lively. When I saw the menu first I was like- not bad for a cafe. Vegetarian and mostly Italian. Impressive as it's mostly personalised and not a commercial fine dining place. 

As the name suggests it's a country side house and the ambience lighting suits it's name and feel. 

No complains for the food, they have kept it simple and the helpings are decent. A huge list of beverages will spoil you for choice. Must visit!

I had gone to this place with a friend and we were really delighted with the service and the food. We ordered Nachos, TCH Chef's Special Burger and Mix Sauce Pasta. Service was pretty decent; they didn't take much time. Nachos were crispy, well presented and tasted great. The Burger was loaded with stuffings and was served with fries. It was amazing especially when eaten with the dip. Mix Sauce Pasta had slightly less broccoli than we'd asked for but was delicious, nonetheless. The moment we had a problem with our Pasta, they replaced it without any questions asked. Staff is genuinely concerned about customers and whether they like the food or not. Towards the end we ordered for a KitKat Shake which was served chilled and was a real delight. Ambience is a very big plus point and I would love to try out more of this place!

The first thing you notice is the decor. Absolutely beautiful. The big glass windows allow the natural light in and the place looks great. It is basically one and a half floors. The ambience is great. I had the  brownie Shake which i found to be really yummy. And the red velvet cake was also a treat. The waffles are another treat.!! A must try here. And thumbs up for the quantity. Margarita pizza was good. I did not like the crust however. My personal favourite was the strawberry mojito!  But i honestly could not get over the decor the whole time . Service is friendly and fast. They really help you with choosing the menu and also they got us an extra tool to keep our bags. Also i love cafes which serve water normally. So a plus plus for that.

Visited the place late evening on a monsoon Sunday. It's somewhat a perfect hideout while it's raining. The entrance is delightful and very European. You enter and you are welcomed with beautiful wall graffiti. The food menu (to my disappointment), we ordered the tomato basil soup and fried mushrooms. I have to admit was very impressive. All in all my experience was perfect for a cozy evening, and the best part is they do plan to introduce non veg in their menu :) I am definitely going back again. Oh..!! Most importantly it's reasonably priced :)

I had this place on my list since quite sometime. Unfortunately, the place seems to be a hype. Ambience is average. Seating is disorganised, a little uncomfortable and the tables are very close. Coming to the food, Italian sizzler was dry and we had to ask for a helping of extra sizzler sauce to finish the meal. The cranberry cocktail was a disappointment. Poor presentation or I should say, no effort made on presentation of the drink. Chocolate shake was good. No complains about the pastries! Both the hazel nut and red velvet pastries were perfect.

Located just in the opposite street of Forum Mall,this place has adequate space and have a two tier seating arrangement. The Country House has got an amazing decor and the decor alone will compel you for a second time visit. Had ordered creamy mushroom risotto and chocoate shake. The risotto was perfectly complimented with cheese and mushroom and the chocolate shake perfectly blended with the sugar syrup. Its bit heavy on the pocket and the quantity is inadequate,nevertheless the staff is quite friendly and always greets you with a smile :)

One of the upcoming cafes in town,The Country House,is located very close to Forum Mall.Housed in over a century old piece of architecture, the interiors are predominantly pristine white, with corners of bright color pops.I consider this to be a plausible effort to save a historic architecture!As we enter the place,we get a feel of an old mansion.Starting from the empty photo frames to the lamp shades,vintage collection of wall hangings to the switch boards,classic windows to the old style ceilings, everything was unrealistic(in a good way!!!).I felt like I had been transported to the European colonial era,since the architecture seemed to be of that time.The place is well utilized and the dim lights went perfectly with the decor.
                                                                ...

Yesterday, me and my friends planned to meet. 'The country House' being a new opened cafe in the city, we decided to try that place.
We had a lot of expectations from the place.
The interiors were fine but the place is very small.
The waiter served us water. We were three people. He served three glasses- all of different shapes and sizes. It was a major turn off because we had a lot of expectations in terms of the presentation. Then we were handed the menu and finally we decided on italian sizzler, exotic pizza, kit kat shake and cranberry cocktail. The italian sizzler contained spaghetti(which tastes like noodles and ketchup), potato wedges(it was soggy), and vegetables sauted in sauce. The exotic pizza was so so and the portion was also very less compared to other cafes. The cranberry coctail was okayish. The oreo shake tasted more like chocolate shake(without ice).
As i have mentioned earlier, we had a lot of expectations in terms of presentation, it is sad to say that we were disappointed.
One of the staff had come to ask for our review on the food. We told him about whatever we felt. After telling twice, we got our check that too with a bang on the table. It was surprising. Though we didn't tell the staff anything, but we thought to mention it in our review so that the manager is aware and that he can take care of it so that other guests are not treated this way.
I am not recommending anyone to visit there.

Easy to spot. But the food isn't that good. Also they say that they have board games but that wasn't arranged in a good way. Three different playing cards were all mixed up. Could only see 3-4 blocks of jenga to build a castle up. As long as the food is concerned, I personally liked the nachos very much. But the pasta wasn't good at all. The sauce was a bit watery. The thin crust pizza was a bit burnt up. The service to some extent was good.

Being a veg restaurant in a place like Kolkata and surviving decently is quite difficult. By that standards this place has survived with grandeur as the ambience n setting is pleasant with that typical English vintage interior decoration. Coming to the food, though the service was a bit lousy plus the rate is on the higher side of the budget, the spaghetti, Italian sizzler, sandwiches are all delectable n satisfactory to the stomach. Overall a nice experience.

Very easy to spot. Bang opposite to forum elgin in the lane. And opposite to cream center. 
You enter to an aromatic coffee smell with a treat to your eyes with different pastries and cakes.also a lively welcome is the stairs as the wall is covered with a very colorful painting.
The walls are decorated according to the theme, pots of flowers. Columns of coffee mugs...
We ordered a drink appylicious mango- it was very delicious and different too.. The flavors were delighting.
TCH special burger- was good too. Nothing different in the filling of the patty though.
TCH special risotto- this one is a DEFINITE MUST TRY!!!!absolutely yummy....

Pocket pinch was 900 for two..

Do you remember the timeless song of Tagore ‚ÄòPurano Shei Din er Kotha‚Äô?¬† Did you know that the song is inspired by Robert Burns‚Äôs Scottish composition ‚ÄúAuld Lang Syne‚Äù (meaning ‚Äì Times Gone By)?

For auld lang syne, my dear (For times gone by, my dear)
For auld lang syne, (For times gone by)
We‚Äôll tak a cup o‚Äô kindness yet (We will take a cup of kindness yet)
For auld lang syne! (For times gone by)

Gone are those days when Kolkata was steeped in Old British Culture! The Country House promises to bring back to us the charm of the ‚ÄòTimes Gone By‚Äô.¬† This new caf√© is one of the oldest piece of architecture in Today‚Äôs Kolkata; dating back to over a century to 1901. At Country House the old complements the new and their amalgamation creates a diversified symphony that transcends the boundaries of language, age, gender; something like the songs that I talked about earlier.

This caf√© is located in Allenby Road, close to Forum Mall. Though it is surrounded by the hustle and bustle of locomotive prone, overcrowded, fast, modernized city, it has a quaint charm about itself. The moment I stepped down from my cab, I noticed a white, old British-Style Building with arches, big windows and lots of surrounding greenery; I immediately got a very positive vibes from this place. As I stepped in, I was welcomed by a colorful, cute bakery. I was warmly welcomed by the owner Vikas Chowdhury . There was a bold, wooden stairway that leads to the first floor, which is primarily the caf√© area. The second floor is meant for private parties and has a cozy look about itself. As I entered, I was immediately enamored of the place. The interiors are sophisticated done in white. The brick exposed wall, the huge glass windows with the old British style arch, the wall art in black, the bold vintage paintings, the quirky mugs hanging on the wall, the kettles as flower pots, the small chandeliers , the mystical lamps, switchboard from my grandfathers era, high ceilings everything exuberated a charm of the ‚ÄòTimes Gone By‚Äô.

Among all this quaint charm, we meet the Owner ‚Äì Vikas Chowdhury, who is the quintessential modern man of the 21st Century. He is funny, he is warm and he is courteous; the exemplary host from both worlds. Kudos to him for the entire concept of the place. While his perception of interiors has been alluring customers into TCH since its inception, his knowledge of food has satiating their gastronomic desires. To add to the old British charm, TCH serves the most charming European Food. Along with other food enthusiasts, I was invited for a Bloggers Meet at The Country House. An elaborate and diverse menu was especially selected for this meet.

DRINKS:

I must begin with saying that I was quite amazed with the sheer versatility that the drinks menu had to offer.¬† Not only did they bring the colonial times British architecture alive but also an aspect of their culture ‚Äì a wide range of hot teas with diverse flavors. Their hot tea menu is itself two pages long, and their variety is commendable. With numerous teas, coffees, shakes and mocktails, I was spoilt for choice.

#Hot Coffees ‚Äì Dark Chocolate Latte & Latte Latino: These innovative hot coffees were a fantastic start to our grand foodathon. Firstly the came in very interesting looking mugs with catchy messages and graffiti. On one Mug it was written ‚ÄòWith Great Beard comes Great Responsibility‚Äô; as a joke on a person who can get coffee over his long beard, while drinking from the mug. Another one had ‚Äì ‚ÄòMe? Sarcastic? Never!‚Äô ; ironically my foodie friend who was drinking from that cup was the most sarcastic of us all. I simply loved those mugs !! These mugs are all TCH products and I encouraged Vikas to sell them.

#Hot Teas ‚Äì Autumn Crescendo Tea & Sunshine Bloom Tea: Both the teas were aromatic beauties.¬† I‚Äôm a tea lover, and both the teas won my heart with their distinct flavors.

#Hot Hazelnut Chocolate: The hazelnut and chocolate combination was delectable. It had a rich aroma.

#Cold Coffees ‚Äì Dark Chocolate Cold Coffee, Spiced Cold Coffee, Crispy Cold Coffee: Another set of drinks that left me wondering where Vikas gets all this innovation from!! The spiced cold coffee had a strong cinnamon flavor and crush ice. I love strong coffees so crispy cold coffee won me over with its mild bitter taste interspersed with crushed chocos flavor. I love dark chocolate, i love coffee, put them together and I love it even more. Dark Chocolate Cold Coffee was a hit.

#Iced Tea- Lemon, Green Apple, Ginger: All the iced-teas came in bulb shaped glasses. I loved the presentation and had to click a billion pictures to satiate the budding photographer in me. All the iced teas had distinct, strong flavors. I loved all of them but the Ginger Iced Tea turned out to be my favorite.

SOUPS & SALADS:

#Chef Special Soup: The soup was quite delicious and the portion was generous. It looked enticing with a vibrant orange color and tasted rich.

#Chef‚Äôs Special Salad: The chef‚Äôs special salad was an innovative dish with watermelon, shredded cheese, and numerous colorful veggies seasoned with vinegar and corn. An very refreshing salad. The Caesar Salad was a classic and

STARTERS:

#Mushroom Burgundian: Showstopper of the evening. Buttoned mushroom with Burgundian Wine, Balsamic Vinegar and Croutons. Even if a write an entire page about this dish, i will still not be able to explain hoe delicious it tasted. So I wouldn‚Äôt event attempt. Just go, try and be WOWWWWWEEEDDD!!

#Fries Basket: Potato Wedges, French Fries and Crispy Potato Rosti along with in-house dip. All the fries were delicious, crispy and the dip was yummy. It had a beautiful and alluring presentation. The moment i appeared on our table, i simply pounced on it.

#Mushroom on Toast: Frankly TCH has excelled in mushroom based dishes. What mushroom dish they touch, its pure gold. And this was no different; an yummilicious dish! One of the major attractions of the evening.

MAINS:

#Exotic Grilled Veg Sandwich: The sandwich had lots of veggies and tasted¬† different. I quite liked it. It came with some chips and mustard mayo dip.

#Penne Pasta in Arrabiata Sauce: This red sauce paste tasted yummy with its slightly tangy flavor. The presentation was marvelous. It came two portions of garlic bread. The bread tasted nice and crunchy.

#Chef‚Äôs Special Burger: This was a mid-sized burger and came with coleslaw, chips and mustard mayo dip. The burger had a crispy vegetable patty with a layer of nachos(how Innovative!!) and mustard mayo dressing. This unconventional burger looked alluring and tasted palatable.

#Spaghetti Pasta in Cheese Sauce: This pasta had lots of broccoli, bell pepper and cheese. This pasta looked enticing even from afar and came with two portions of garlic bread.¬† This cheese infused pasta won my heart and left me wanting more.

#Creamy Mushroom Risotto & TCH Chef Special Risotto (Corn Risotto) : Creamy risottos with lots of mushroom or corn. They came two portions of garlic bread each. The¬† risottos were the another showstopper of the evening! The were rich, creamy, and mind-blowing-ly delicious. I simply fell in love with their subtle, creamy taste.

I had an amazing time at THE COUNTRY HOUSE!! I wish Vikas and the team of TCH all the success in the world and thank them for an unforgettable evening!!

The food was undoubtedly awesome. Their quantity is amazing. The food was fresh. Everything was as good as possible. But one thing that can be improved was the sitting arena. The chairs were not that comfortable. Yaa, but their covers them all. We had ordered Oreo shakes, which were the best I have had after the one I had at The Bikers Cafe. Their pizza was a good bid. Their burgers seem to be awesome and don't forget the sizzlers,they were amazing too. I heard that their nachos are amazing, but never tried them though. Their staff are  polite and good at business. But one additional thing they could do was add stuff to their menu. They have everything ,from risottos to burgers. But they were lacking in the variety of a burger and of other stuff. But whatever they had was delicious.

Located in a small old house, is this wonderful cafe - unless you search for it, you might miss it the first time.

Decor was classy - as it's located on multiple floors - it gave the owners more option to play with the interiors. 

Staff was well mannered, courteous and ready to help. Food was served promptly - and they time and again asked us, if we were happy. 

Food was good, we ordered drinks like Freshlime Soda, and Mojitos - boy were really nice. For food we tried, Nachos, Buritos, pasta, sandwiches, burgers and soups - and found all of them to be well presented and good to taste. We were too full to try desserts - preserving that for the next visit.

With new places emerging all around the city, I headed to this cafe on hearing several good reviews.... Loved the ambience,the place had a happy vibe to it. We took our seats and placed our order soon enough. The smoked tomato soup which was too good,loved it. Then it was a mushroom risotto, too much on the salt content and tasted wierd. We called for a pesto in spaghetti and got a penne instead. The service on questioning told us they don't have that option,which we were not informed. The pasta had too much cream which overpowered the pesto. We then asked for dessert options and choose a red velvet on the servers recommendation. He came back and told us they were sold off and he did not know of it while recommending. The service was just ok. They have to hear up to sustain in an area with so many good cafes around.

Visited country house last evening with a couple of friends. Small, cozy cafe around elgin road. The ambience is fresh and the wall decor is fun to read. The service was very quick. We ordered for a shake, nachos, a sandwich and mushroom risotto. The risotto was to die for but the sandwich was quiet average.¬†

Would like to visit again to try out newer things. Great experience overall

Had a very quick in and out to this place. The ambience looks bright and fresh. The art on the walls is catchy(read, good for selfies). We ordered for nachos, Oreo shake and chocolate shake. Service was fast. We spent a very little time and tried very basic items so a proper review can't be given. Would like to visit again and relish some entrees and sides.

A newly opened cafe near Forum (Opposite creme centre) is a new step in Kolkata towards the concept of Suburban English cafes. A very clean and well kept place is a key to a successful joint. This is one such place. Confectionery at the ground floor, cafe at the first and a special small area above which can be booked for a 10-12 ppl gathering.

They have a decent variety of mocktails to offer (Watermelon cooler and Ginger ale based is worth a shot).

Mushroom Burgundian is a must try which has mushrooms tossed in red wine. Also they have good veg sizzlers. Chef's special Burger is the one not to miss. It is simply amazing.

Overall a different place with a new variety of F&B

‚ÄúThe Country House‚Äù, turned out to be something splendid and beyond my expectation. The place surprised me not only with its variety of dishes and the taste of food but also with its anomalous decor. As you enter the place you get a feel of an old classic mansion from British era. From the empty photo frames to the lamp shades, from the vintage collection of wall hangings to the switch boards, from the classic windows to the old style ceilings, everything was just perfect to make me feel that I had come to a mansion. The decor was impressive and had already put a mark on my mind. The place is well organised and the space has been utilised very well. The dim light was just going perfectly with the decor. To be precise, the decor and ambience was impressive.

There are a few places where you can say perfect for every single thing you see. Enter this big place with two floors and the ambience will make you drool from the very beginning. From teapot plants to a countryside bike or the lights that have been used, you will be mesmerised with its beauty. 
Coming to the food, 'spaghetti aglio e olio' is a must try. We had italian sizzler, pizza, broccoli soup which was yum, and virgin mojito. The food was spot on. I am definitely going soon to this place again. Thankyou for making my evening so foodelicious!!

It's a Small little cafe went in with high expectations and ordered a vanilla latte.. There was so much of Hershey's syrup in it that not only did the flavour of vanilla got empowered but it was so so sweet to consume. Coffee place cannot serve this kind of coffee. Also ordered a sizzler..which was average not something I will be craving for. Had gone for dessert but had to skip it since I consumed that in my beverage. Courteous staff and clean place.

Choice of food is limited but as they said they are about to issue new menu in few days.. Food was just okay.. Service is bit slow... Ambiance is nothing extra ordinary that can attract you..

Apart from the ambience, I didn't really take a shine to the place. Half of the things I wanted to order wasn't on the menu and the black forest that I was served seemed stale. The coffee almond cake slice was dry and tasteless, stale desserts don't create fond memories dear country house, what they create are disappointed customers

Amazing place! White brick walls with abstract wall art. The interiors win your heart the moment you enter the cafe. Coming to the food. We called for Caesar salad and it was amazing. The waiter recommended mushroom burgudian and it turned out to be one of the best mushroom dishes I have ever tried. They served a sauce/dip which was nothing but reduced mushroom gravy and it was amazing. If you are someone who is fond of mushrooms, this is a MUST try! Even pasta was simple but I loved the taste. For drinks we called for lemon ginger ice tea and crispy coffee. The beverages were a big disappointment. The reason being that they have not mentioned the details of the drink and the waiter fails to explain the same. We called for crispy coffee assuming there would be pieces of chocolate chips or caramel in the coffee and hence the name 'crispy coffee' but it turned out to be an extremely bitter coffee. Also ice tea had no flavour of ginger. Dessert section is also a huge disappointment. They did not have a different collection of desserts but just regular pastries.

Located near Forum Mall, Elgin Road, the Country House is one of the newly minted caf√©s in town. But it surely makes a mark in the minds of its visitors, from the moment they walk in. Housed in over a century old piece of architecture, the interiors are predominantly pristine white, with corners of bright color pops. It‚Äôs one of those places where old and new are woven together seamlessly.

I just get flowed with the ambience and deco... its awesome... the paintings, the white coloured brick exposed wall, large glass panel windows and also the tea pots with plants coming out of it  which are placed above the windows are just beautiful... As you take upstairs you will find a bicycle hanged on the left wall will definitely attract you...

As you all know that I'm not at all a veg person... but due to some of my friends recommendations me and some of my fellow friends visited for having a dinner over here...

So we started it up with there drinks...
‚òÖ Lemon iced tea¬ª¬ª¬ª Excellent... presented in a bulb shaped bottle... pretty interesting... tasted awesome...
‚ô° Green apple iced tea¬ª¬ª¬ª Very tangy and refreshing... 
‚òÖ Ginger iced tea¬ª¬ª¬ª Awesome one...
‚òÖ Dark chocolate latte¬ª¬ª¬ª Good one...
‚òÖ Latte Latino¬ª¬ª¬ª okish one... tasted same like dark chocolate...
‚òÖ Hot hazelnut¬ª¬ª¬ª Also very flat... tasted just like powder milk in hot water...
‚òÖ Sunshine bloom tea¬ª¬ª¬ª Normal raw tea...
‚òÖ Dark chocolate cold coffee¬ª¬ª¬ª Very good one...
‚òÖ Crispy cold coffee¬ª¬ª¬ª Good... but I can't figure out the difference between these one and the above one...
‚ô° Spiced cold Coffee¬ª¬ª¬ª Wow this is something thing I never tasted before... and it's just awesome... A must try for spicy drink lovers...

Moving on to foods... we tried there...
‚òÖ Mushroom on tost¬ª¬ª¬ª Very good in taste but I think the quantity of mushrooms in the dish is bit less... need to be mentioned this is the only ingredient in a veg restaurants for which I can die for...
‚ô° Mushroom burgundian¬ª¬ª¬ª Excellent... we are fighting for each pieces of mushrooms...
‚ô° Fries basket¬ª¬ª¬ª Consists of three type of potato fries... and it's awesome...
‚ô° Chef's special salad¬ª¬ª¬ª Came with generous quantity of lettuce, apple, yellow and green bell peppers... Another hit of the night...
‚òÖ Exotic grilled veg sandwich¬ª¬ª¬ª Good... Nothing to mention about it more...
‚ô° Chef's special burger¬ª¬ª¬ª O man it's just awesome... both taste and presentation wise... the patty was very fresh...
‚óé Smoky tomato soup¬ª¬ª¬ª God it's a blender... very bad... it's a gr8 flop... need a huge improvement...
‚ô° Spaghetti pasta in cheese sauce¬ª¬ª¬ª Although my friends didn't like it very much... it was excellent from my side...
‚òÖ Creamy mushroom risotto¬ª¬ª¬ª Good one...
‚ô° Penne pasta in Arrabiata sauce¬ª¬ª¬ª Excellent dish to end with... 

They had no such dessert options... but they tie it up with one of my favourite brand "Glace' Patisserie"... so without any delay we all ordered a lots of it...
‚ô° Red velvet with cream cheese frosting... 
‚ô° Orange cointreau... ‚ô° Lemon meringue pie... ‚ô° Almond barquette... ‚ô° Blueberry cheesecake... ‚ô° Sacher torte... ‚ô° Salted caramel praline pastry... ‚ô° Cherry almond tart... ‚ô° Coffee bean macaroon and ‚ô° Mango coconut panna cotta... Hummm... and believe me each and every one was die for... but among all the Coffee bean macaroon needs a special mention... just go for it...

Overall a gr8 experience... but they seriously need to buck up there Staffs and the service too... it was a serious concern to take care of...

A gr8 night spent with

The name itself gives you some different ideas and different thoughts in your mind about this place. It gives you a classic feel where you are tend to believe you're in somewhere 1980's when you step in at this place. Located opposite of Forum Mall at Allenby road looked to me very cosy and at a very silent and quite location.

From the main door when you look up you see some quite a eye catching things on your way starting with the hanging lamps to the classic stairs that looked to me an old mansion as also descripted by other fellow foodies. With colorful paintings on the wall to hanged cycle with LED lights on the tires looked quite impressive on the decor part. Interiors has been the main attraction and its certainly done very well and decorated quite nicely. Not to spacious but still it got quite a decent sitting arrangement with a LCD TV on the top for your entertainment. 

Been late to this place so unable to describe the entire things.

Simply got amazed with the welcome and even surprised to see the huge list of dishes to be taken.

--STARTERS--

-> Mushroom Burgundian - Got stunned really! Mushroom dishes don't surprise me too much to be honest, but this one was a stunner. I think the best mushroom starter i had till date.

-> Mushroom on Toast - Triangle shaped bread were toasted and spread with cheese all over with cut pieces of mushroom on it. Something unique to see, a good attempt.

-> Exotic Grilled Veg Sandwich - Simply liked this very much, i am not a fond of sandwiches being a hardcore non vegetarian but liked this one. Filled with quite number of veggies and grilled perfectly. Served with chips and creamy dips to make it even better,

--BEVERAGES--

Served with quite number of beverages as well but somewhere not upto the mark.

-> Dark Chocolate Latte - Blend of raw coffee, lesser in sweet and dark chocolate made the things soothing with the richness of latte.

-> Hot Hazelnut - Disappointment is the word for this. A bland drink. Seemed to me like a milky drink. Could not find the hazelnut flavor.

-> Spiced Cold Coffee - It was quite distinctive from the other drinks. Filled with chocolate sauce in good number inside treated the tongue quite well.

-> Dark chocolate cold coffee was also on the better side. 

-> Iced Tea - This was a cooler which really impressed everyone. Served i a bulb type glasses. Flavours of lemon, green apple and ginger which were firmly present to cool you up.

->  Sunshine bloom tea - It was quite similar looking to the first one but different in taste, got confused on the first place to see both the table.

->  Autumn Crescendo Tea - This was the third one which was too nice. Looked like the same but somehow different from the two.

-- SOUP AND SALADS--

->  Chef‚Äôs Special Salad - Salads are not my choices but this one certainly turned my thinking to a 360 degree. Mixture of cabbage, lettuce, watermelon, cherry, corn with cheese and served with toasts. Looked very appealing and was truly impressive.

->  Smoky Tomato Soup - Oh dear! seriously was that a soup? A big improvement is required in this particular item.

--MAIN COURSE--

->   Penne Pasta in Arrabiata Sauce - Looked very spicy one the first place but was a bit ordinary in taste. Mixture of tomato sauce pasta with garlic, basil, onions but lacked the perfection.

-> Creamy Mushroom Risotto - Something right on the table to eat. Cooking was spot on. it was cheesy and mushroom sauce take it all.

-> Chef‚Äôs Special Burger : Huge sized burger with filling of Tomato, onion and lettuce with other supported veggies. Served with chips and two types of dips as well. 

-> Spaghetti Pasta in Cheese Sauce - Made in regular cheese sauce which was ordinary in taste, seemed to me a bit sticky on the forks.

All the dishes we tried had some ups and downs but still it was quite well managed by the organizers.  Service was a bit factor and was bit slow on the show. The look of one of the service person seemed too tiring while serving us and taking up the plates from the table. 

Thanks to my fellow foodies for joining me on the table and making it a wonderful experience. Credit goes to Shahbaaz....

All thanks to Mr. Vikas for the invitation and putting so much effort to do all the things right and making it a pleasant evening . Will recommend it surely to all.

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

Country house has become my favourite joint, having been there three times in a week I can safely say that the food is amazing. The staff is very friendly and the fact that I can sit around and play scrabble while sipping on my coffee just adds to everything that's already nice. The mushroom risotto is to die for and for all the carbs lover the fries basket is a must try.

When you enter The Country House, you are bound to understand why this name! Located in Allenby Road, this new cafe is a step towards a cosy place in a city emerging with foreign culture restaurants.
So what do you expect from a name like this? Yes, a country house setting taking you to a European suburban, simple yet fun and pleasant vibes. The country house is exactly like that.
The cafe is divided between three levels- the ground floor is the kitchen followed by a fleet of steps taking u to the main seating area with around 7-8 tables. There is another section above this one.
The cafe is small, but serves as an advantage since caf√©s are bound to be cosy, simple, and comforting.
The idea of a European cafe is to meet friends over food and coffee, simple a cosy environment. This place has done justice to its name with its white brick walls, lamps, high ceiling and cute motifs and artifacts.
Moving to the food, here goes my encounter:

- Dark chocolate latte which was brilliant if you ask me. It wasn't too sweet, allowing dark chocolate to engulf your senses and the riches of the latte was enough to love it #recommended

- Latte Latino was a hot beverage which wasn't preferred by me because it lacked in depth

- Hot hazelnut- name excited me but the dish was a little disappointing because it smelled nor tasted like hazelnut.

- Dark chocolate cold coffee was very well made and is one of their signature dishes. #recommended

- Spiced cold coffee was prepared with milk, ice, vanilla and spiced with cinnamon and I absolutely fell in love this drink. Definitely trying it again! #recommended

- iced tea in flavors of lemon, green apple and ginger were refreshing but honestly the flavors need to be improved in terms of differentiating the drinks. They were presented in similar looking bulb glasses (cool)
but somehow the drinks can get really confusing of u order them all at once ( they look the same)

- Sunshine bloom tea was smelling of summer, fragrant and good to taste

- For appetizers we tried their smoky tomato soup which honestly lacked in taste. There seemed to be flavors missing and my tongue seemed a little confused with the dish

- Chefs special salad was refreshing with onions, peppers, watermelon tossed in their secret dressing and topped with feta cheese. #recommended

- Mushroom Burgundian is a star dish! If you love mushrooms you will fall in love with this humble tossed mushroom dish taken to a new level. Burnt garlic, sauteed mushrooms and a mushroom reduced dip is what makes this dish a complete rock star! #recommended

- The fries basket was good with French fries, wedges and potato patty with a dip but this dish can be improved with new additions like onion rings, a little garnish of fresh parsley or the fries can be tossed in some cheese powder to enhance flavor.

- The mushroom on toast tasted as good as it looked. Creamy, cheesy and mushroomy. #recommended

- Veg grilled sandwich was absolutely a veg lovers delight. Loaded with crunchy and sauteed veggies, the flavor was complex and very European #recommended

- Chefs special burger looked like an entire meal with a great patty and enough sides. Though I feel the flavor can be bettered with some pesto or some sauteed mushrooms to elevate the dish.

- Spaghetti in cheese sauce was tasty and creamy, flavored with parsley and was good!

- The Arrabiata sauce penne lacked the tanginess and heat which an Arrabiata sauce must have. This was a normal tomato sauce pasta with garlic, basil, onions. But overall the dish fell flat, because the dish was runny! Didn't like it at all.

- The creamy mushroom risotto was treated very well! It had Al Dante ( perfectly cooked, crunchy but not hard, just as a risotto should be ) arborio rice cooked in creamy mushroom cheese sauce and tasted divine! #recommended

- The corn risotto was exactly like its mushroom counterpart and tasted very good!

Overall the food is good, barring few glitches here and there!

The service was a little slow and they need to work on being a little more hospitable but the presence of the extremely welcoming owner, Vikas, sublimed the environment.

A wonderful evening spent with my dear foodie friends

Location : The lane opposite Forum Mall. Near Chaska Caf√©.

‚Äò‚ÄôEver noticed the dusty soil rejuvenate after the first rain‚Äô‚Äô

That is what The Country House is all about, where you will find the interiors of an old mansion brought to life with gloomy lights and quirky artefacts. The owners has done a splendid job at curating the interiors in a semi-retro fashion with vintage switch boards, mini bulb chandeliers and old-factory style hanging lamps. Brick walls having long/heightened windows with an overlooking balcony on the exterior are all but old school. The lights were dim so as to maintain the charming ambience.
So all together it has a resemblance of a mansion from the British era and how it would look under the modern/contrasting funky approach.

Going by the theme of the restaurant, it would have been stupid if they served any sort of Indian food. This fear has been eliminated as their menu solely comprises of Italian and Continental dishes.

--***-- The list of starters on their menu is pretty ordinary as majority of the items are available to other restaurants too. I feel they could have taken it a step further to venture into a handful of unique dishes also. Anyways, here‚Äôs what I had.
‚òÖ¬†¬†¬† Mushroom Burgundian : Anything containing mushroom is sure to appeal to your taste buds. But still the dish has to be prepared well which was exactly the fact here. It was indescribably decadent. I could hold back myself from having repeated rounds.

‚òÖ¬†¬†¬† Mushroom On Toast : The idea is simple. Bread toasts cut in triangles are topped with molten cheese, mushrooms and bell peppers. The blend of cheese and mushroom was nice and toasts were crisp.

‚òÖ¬†¬†¬† Exotic Grilled Veg Sandwich : These are really good as a breakfast item. Healthy as well because of the exotic vegetable content inside. They were evenly grilled and served with a creamy dip which really good.

--***-- SOUPS & SALADS
‚òÖ¬†¬†¬† Chef‚Äôs Special Salad : This was the first time I have loved a salad. It was an amazing composition of lettuce, cabbage, corn, watermelon and cherry with cheese amidst. Completely blown over by the presentation as well.

‚òÖ¬†¬†¬† Smoky Tomato Soup : This was utter rubbish and was completely bland. It lacked both taste and aroma. Not even a hint tomato. Presentation was also less than ordinary. Would not recommend it at all.

--***-- Moving on to the main courses which were an absolute delight.
‚òÖ¬†¬†¬† Spaghetti Pasta in Cheese Sauce : This was the regular spaghetti pasta in creamy cheese sauce. Was glad to see the pasta h wasn‚Äôt raw and thus well cooked.

‚òÖ¬†¬†¬† Penne Pasta in Arrabiata Sauce : An arrabiata sauce is meant to be spicy to the core, bursting with flavours of garlic, oregano and basil. This one had some of these elements and the fact that it didn‚Äôt have all, made it demeaning.

‚òÖ¬†¬†¬† Creamy Mushroom Risotto : Risotto, in recent times, has become my favourite continental dish because of its cheesy and nutty character. This version had mushrooms which made it heavenly. Nothing wrong with it in its entirety.

‚òÖ¬†¬†¬† Chef‚Äôs Special Burger : The burger was filled with a nice assortment of vegetables. Plus I was really surprised to find that Nachos had also been used as a filling. They gave it a new twist with an improved taste.

--***-- We were also treated with a round of beverages. Failed to impress me above the average.
‚òÖ¬†¬†¬† Dark Chocolate Latte : For all coffee lovers who like it raw, this would be the perfect latte. But those looking for a sugary taste be sure to avoid this.

‚òÖ¬†¬†¬† Hot Hazelnut : Honestly speaking, I didn‚Äôt even get a tinge of hazelnut flavour in it. Moreover, it tasted it like milk with a sugary aftertaste.

‚òÖ¬†¬†¬† Dark Chocolate Cold Coffee : This was attractively presented with chocolate sauce spilled on the insides of the glass. The dark chocolate complimented the cold coffee as it has been a classic mix for a long time.

‚òÖ¬†¬†¬† Spiced Cold Coffee : This was a distinctive coffee infused with new flavours. The taste buds take a sip or two to get accustomed to the flavour as this drink works its magic on them. Would definitely recommend it.

‚òÖ¬†¬†¬† Iced Tea : This was the best of the coolers with separable flavours of lemon, green apple and ginger. I have had it elsewhere but wasn‚Äôt as good as they served here.

‚òÖ¬†¬†¬† Autumn Crescendo Tea : This has a dark colour and a rich taste to it. The aroma is just perfect and a sip virtually takes you to the fresh tea gardens. Do give it a try.

I am not much of tea lover, but I can tell you that this place serves abundant varieties of tea to suit your moods, which are really relaxing.

If you really need a break from the regular caf√© or restaurant scene, try out this place as it has loads to offer in terms of both savouries and ambience (which in itself is a class apart). Mr.Vikas was an obliging host and would thank him for inviting us over.
This place remains absolutely crowded, so would recommend to make prior reservations.
So this pretty much sums up my wonderful experience at TCH made more delightful in the presence of these amazing foodies.

Most of the credit given here goes to the nice warmly feel of the place . Even in that I would like to add that , having the active kitchen view on your left , the moment you enter, unless a pretty kitchen, isn't the best of sights. For how new the place is , I felt the staff need way more motivation than they presently do . There are extra water bottles kept in the seating area, not the kind of professionalism one would expect from such a place .
Coming to the food part of it , I began by ordering only two things as it was my maiden visit . Sadly, I couldn't go beyond one bite and one sip .
Chilli cheese garlic toast ordered , had its oil separating from the cheese and had not much taste to it. The flavours were highly subdued and the cheese had totally lost its flavour due to the error in preparation method .
As for the vanilla cold coffee, the vanilla syrup was way too liberally used. It hampered me from getting to get the coffee feel completely. 
Even the food presentation could surely be worked on for a place like this . It was the same old things once again .
Sorry folks!
Bottom line:
Food: not coming back for
Ambience : still nice and warm
Staff: need a better leader

Nice ambience. Decent food. Taste and texture of food can be improved. Bread to be a bit on softer side. Coffee taste could be better.

The Country House takes you to a journey of past, where, you can see everything which will make you feel that you have come to a classic old mansion. From the empty photo frames to the lamp shades, from the vintage collection of wall hangings to the switch boards, from the classic windows to the old style ceilings everything was just perfect to make me feel that I have come to a mansion. The decor was impressive and had already put a mark on my mind as soon as I entered. The place is well organised and the space has been utilised very well. The dim light was just going perfectly with the decor. To be precise, the decor and ambience was impressive.
The place serves a variety of drinks and snacks. Mr. Vikas was a great host, a smile on his face and a keen motive of making things comfortable for us. We were fortunate enough to get some of the best items on our table. So here are the following things which made my day:

***FOOD***
# Chef's Special Salad : Absolutely amazing to be honest. The preparation matched the name of the item, as the chef really made it special. The Salad had lettuce, capsicum, cabbage, corn, cherry tomatoes, watermelons and cheese toppings to make it simply great to start with.

#Mushroom Burgundian: This came as heaven in my mouth. If you want to get the feel of heaven just have it once. The button mushrooms cooked with Burgundian wine with spices was nothing short of a great preparation.

# Fries Basket : A basket full of different kinds of potato fries. One being the traditional French fries and crunchy potato (kind of aaloo tikki) , potato roast being the other two. These were served with an exotic dip which increased the taste overall.

#Exotic Grilled Veg Sandwich : The sandwich was well prepared with a layer of different kinds of veggies in the middle. The rich taste was good enough to make you happy.

#Spagetti Pasta in Cheese Sauce: The pasta arrived on the table creating an urge to jump on it as I am a big time Pasta lover and that too White Sauce Pasta. But the excitement settled down at the same rate as it went up after the first bite. Not that great to be honest.

#Penne Pasta in Arrabiata Sauce: Another pasta preparation which failed to impress my taste buds. The pasta was not thick enough as it should have been. The red sauce pasta was not the item I would come back for.

#Creamy Mushroom Risotto: The Risotto was looking great as it came on the table and it tasted good too. The creamy risotto with mushroom was a good preparation and i was enjoying it.

#TCH Chef Special Soup: The soup was absolute disappointment to be honest. The experiment of giving cold soup rather than the hot one turned to be a nightmare.

***DRINKS***

# Iced Tea: There were 3 different types of ice tea served to us. I was impressed by the beautiful "bulb" shaped glass in which it was served.
¬∞¬∞ Lemon : The lemon flavoured iced tea was the first drink to start with. It was prepared well and it was quite good to make myself prepare for the large menu to come thereafter.
¬∞¬∞ Green Apple : This was another flavoured ice tea. The green apple was good but not as impressive as the previous one.
¬∞¬∞ Ginger: To be simple, it was the best out of the three. The tea was made with ginger powder and it was tasting great.

#Dark Chocolate Latte: The drink came in a cute coffee cup. The quotes in the cups were attractive and each cups had some nice quotes and that was impressive. But other than that it didn't have anything much to offer. The drink was not as good as I expected it to be.

#Latte Latino: This one proved to be a better drink than the previous one. The taste was not great but it can be given the tag of good quite easily for sure.

#Hot Hazelnut: This turned out to be a little different. Milky white colour, thick and tasty these are the things which sums up this drink. The mixture of hazelnut & vanilla flavour turned to be a hit.

#Dark Chocolate Cold Coffee: The cold coffee was really well made with dark chocolate. The dark chocolate gives a punch in the drink making you love it a bit more than the usual cold coffee. The presentation was again of top class.

#Crispy Cold Coffee : Loved it for its crispy chocolate dusts in the coffee. The thick, dense coffee was one of the best drinks of the day for sure. The amount of sugar could have been little more as per my taste, but it was negligible.

#Spiced Coffee : A unique coffee for me as it was the first time I was having a spiced coffee. The taste had its own uniqueness to mesmerise me into its spicy coffee. The salty, spicy coffee was unique enough to make an impact on my tongue and mind.

#Autumn Crescendo Tea: The tea took my heart away, though it was without sugar but it can always be added. The rich tea flavour was just amazing. The smell of the flavour and the colour stole my heart away.

#Sunshine Bloom Tea: I couldn't find much of difference between this tea and the previous one, be it the flavour, taste or colour. It wasn't that great as it was almost the same for me.

With all these, it came to an end and we had a great time having some great food and drinks.
Not only food but also the ambience.

LAST WORDS:
Do you want something unique, something different from what you see everyday when you go to a cafe for having a coffee. This is d place for you then, you can have some quality food and enjoy the vintage ambience at the same time.
A must go place to check out the newest cafe in town.

4.0/5 is what it deserves from my side.

Great time spent with

So we go this plc thinking its new and a bit chick, only to be highly disappointed with the untrained staff who says they only have hot beverages to serve, nothing cold ( in this scorching weather). Later we observe other guests being served cold beverages and when we challenge them they get us our cold coffee. 
We ordered a cottage cheese sizzler where the cottage cheese is absolutely cold, and rice seems to be microwaved well. 
We order a spaghetti agliolio, which is more like a pepper and spice agliolio which we could not eat beyond two bites. On our request they agree to replace it 
Above all service is super slow, only to make us feel they are making everything fresh but just the three dishes we order too more than 90 minutes at this cafe. 
Overall a very bad experience, not going there again.

Location : The lane opposite Forum Mall. Near Chaska Caf√©.

‚Äò‚ÄôEver noticed the dusty soil rejuvenate after the first rain‚Äô‚Äô

That is what The Country House is all about, where you will find the interiors of an old mansion brought to life with gloomy lights and quirky artefacts. The owners has done a splendid job at curating the interiors in a semi-retro fashion with vintage switch boards, mini bulb chandeliers and old-factory style hanging lamps. Brick walls having long/heightened windows with an overlooking balcony on the exterior are all but old school. The lights were dim so as to maintain the charming ambience.
So all together it has a resemblance of a mansion from the British era and how it would look under the modern/contrasting funky approach.

Going by the theme of the restaurant, it would have been stupid if they served any sort of Indian food. This fear has been eliminated as their menu solely comprises of Italian and Continental dishes.

--***-- The list of starters on their menu is pretty ordinary as majority of the items are available to other restaurants too. I feel they could have taken it a step further to venture into a handful of unique dishes also. Anyways, here‚Äôs what I had.
‚òÖ¬†¬†¬† Mushroom Burgundian : Anything containing mushroom is sure to appeal to your taste buds. But still the dish has to be prepared well which was exactly the fact here. It was indescribably decadent. I could hold back myself from having repeated rounds.

‚òÖ¬†¬†¬† Mushroom On Toast : The idea is simple. Bread toasts cut in triangles are topped with molten cheese, mushrooms and bell peppers. The blend of cheese and mushroom was nice and toasts were crisp.

‚òÖ¬†¬†¬† Exotic Grilled Veg Sandwich : These are really good as a breakfast item. Healthy as well because of the exotic vegetable content inside. They were evenly grilled and served with a creamy dip which really good.

--***-- SOUPS & SALADS
‚òÖ¬†¬†¬† Chef‚Äôs Special Salad : This was the first time I have loved a salad. It was an amazing composition of lettuce, cabbage, corn, watermelon and cherry with cheese amidst. Completely blown over by the presentation as well.

‚òÖ¬†¬†¬† Smoky Tomato Soup : This was utter rubbish and was completely bland. It lacked both taste and aroma. Not even a hint tomato. Presentation was also less than ordinary. Would not recommend it at all.

--***-- Moving on to the main courses which were an absolute delight.
‚òÖ¬†¬†¬† Spaghetti Pasta in Cheese Sauce : This was the regular spaghetti pasta in creamy cheese sauce. Was glad to see the pasta h wasn‚Äôt raw and thus well cooked.

‚òÖ¬†¬†¬† Penne Pasta in Arrabiata Sauce : An arrabiata sauce is meant to be spicy to the core, bursting with flavours of garlic, oregano and basil. This one had some of these elements and the fact that it didn‚Äôt have all, made it demeaning.

‚òÖ¬†¬†¬† Creamy Mushroom Risotto : Risotto, in recent times, has become my favourite continental dish because of its cheesy and nutty character. This version had mushrooms which made it heavenly. Nothing wrong with it in its entirety.

‚òÖ¬†¬†¬† Chef‚Äôs Special Burger : The burger was filled with a nice assortment of vegetables. Plus I was really surprised to find that Nachos had also been used as a filling. They gave it a new twist with an improved taste.

--***-- We were also treated with a round of beverages. Failed to impress me above the average.
‚òÖ¬†¬†¬† Dark Chocolate Latte : For all coffee lovers who like it raw, this would be the perfect latte. But those looking for a sugary taste be sure to avoid this.

‚òÖ¬†¬†¬† Hot Hazelnut : Honestly speaking, I didn‚Äôt even get a tinge of hazelnut flavour in it. Moreover, it tasted it like milk with a sugary aftertaste.

‚òÖ¬†¬†¬† Dark Chocolate Cold Coffee : This was attractively presented with chocolate sauce spilled on the insides of the glass. The dark chocolate complimented the cold coffee as it has been a classic mix for a long time.

‚òÖ¬†¬†¬† Spiced Cold Coffee : This was a distinctive coffee infused with new flavours. The taste buds take a sip or two to get accustomed to the flavour as this drink works its magic on them. Would definitely recommend it.

‚òÖ¬†¬†¬† Iced Tea : This was the best of the coolers with separable flavours of lemon, green apple and ginger. I have had it elsewhere but wasn‚Äôt as good as they served here.

LOCATION:Situated on Allenby Road right opposite the Cream Centre Outlet.

OVERVIEW & INTERIORS:

Dinner last night with my wife and her family. We were 5 people in total. The restaurant/cafe is housed between two floors with the ground floor containing the bakery and the first floor containing the cafe. The place is well done up both from outside with victorian themed windows and inside with a cool yet classy look. There are some neat touches to the way the place looks with a set of couches right above the staircase which leads to the first floor and a small cafe space housing 25-30 guests next to it. I liked the huge windows, the old school switches, the book shelves and the white colored naked brick walls.¬†

WINE & DINE:

The place only offers vegetairan options. We ordered for quite a few dishes.

To begin with the Ceaser Salad was ok. Lettuce, cherry tomatoes, jalapeneos in mayo sauce with bread crumbs. The flavor was acceptable but nothing to rave about.

The Cheesy Garlic Bread was also average. Hard to go wrong with bread and cheese. They had generous amounts to Mozzarella which was good.

The Nachos were probably the best dish of the evening. I liked the spicy mayo they served with it. Quantity was sufficient for two.

Pasta in Arabiatta Sauce : Bit of a dissapointment. Lacked Flavor and they need to serve a whole piece of bread or dinner roll with it as it this has to be a main. We got two thin pieces of garlic bread which was enough for garnishing but not for complimenting the dish.

The TCH Special Risotto was good but a touch too liquidy. It had not been kept on the pan enough resulting in more of a stew than a risotto. but nonetheless, the flavors were good.

The Burger was decent again but did not make me go "wow". It was basic with lettuce, tomatoes and a veg patty in the middle. It should have come with fries but they had run out and served lays chips instead i guess (:

The cold coffee was over sweet and the iced tea was more water and less flavor.

FEEDBACK FOR IMPROVEMENT:

The menu really needs an upgrade with too few items especially considering the fact that it only has vegetarian items. While I understand its a cafe, keeping coke zero or diet coke would not harm. Food while good in quality needs to be better with flavor. Most of the food we had could have been made at home out of a recipe book.¬†

VERDICT:

With reasonable prices, great interiors but average food, this would be a one visit at present but dont go with great expectations. I am yet to try the bakery but I hope they can improve the food and the menu.

Located in my colony.. was always eager to visit since the day i saw it being made. It is basically an old pretty mansion renovated beautifully to a cafe and bakery. The ambience gives brownie points to the cafe 
That country feeling as the name suggests is taken care of properly. From the black American ceilings to the yellow lights and the beautiful zed plants in typical tea pots. A white brick textured wall with empty frames and painted black birds catch the eye.
Another wall is adorned by an old bicycle illuminated with neon lights. For the ambience its a big thumbs up
Next, coming to the food 
We had a huge spread 
First thing to be made sure to everyone is that it serves veg food. Non vegetarians though should not be disappointed at all , you can pamper your taste buds without meat once you are here trust me 
The following items that i tasted among drinks were : Dark chocoltate latte and old coffee , Crispy cold coffee , Hot hazelnut , Ice tea ( lemon , green apple , ginger) , sunshine bloom tea and Spiced Cold coffee 
Among all these my favourite was the spiced cold coffee . It was really different . A beautiful looking drink with an amazing smell of spices and a crispness. 
The iced teas served in bulb like looking vessels had the essential taste that would soothe your mind in this hot sultry weather.
The green apple ice tea being my favourite with chopped apples inside , the lemon and ginger being good too. The tanginess just appropriate !
Coming to the hot hazelnut, i have had better before. That smell of hazelnut was missing. It was more of a milk dominated drink.
The bloom tea along with the others mentioned above were a regular one , nothing extraordinary. There is always a scope for improvment
Now the food that i gorged on : 
Mushroom on toast , chefs special soup , exotic grilled veg sandwich , chef's special burger , spaghetti pasta in cheese sauce , penne pasta in Arabiata sauce , mushroom Burgandian , creamy mushroom risotto and Fries basket. 
After tasting all that i can say one thing , mushroom is their speciality ! 
The mushroom burgandian is one thing you should definitely try here ! The amazing softness of the mushrooms , the correct spices and the presentation ! A perfect thing!
Mushroom on toast was good too. Found it a bit salty though or maybe its just my taste buds. Looked fantastic too
The veg burger was an amazement ! I have never really went to a restaurant and tried a veg burger being a hard core meat lover. But this burger amazed me totally ! It was delicious . The perfectlly cooked and mixed patty . The balance of cheese and lettuce , it all blended perfectly in the mouth.
The chef's special soup though didnt please me at all
The spaghetti pasta in cheese sauce though tasted good , i found the sauce to be a bit runny .. a thicker sauce would be fantastic !
The panna pasta was good.. a little spicy arabiata sauce for the spice lovers !
The creamy mushroom risotto tasted yum too! The fries basket wasnt really something very extraordinary to me. Vegies can judge that better ! 
Another dish worth mentioning was rhe chefs special salad ! It is a beauty ! You would pity distorting and eating it. Its a rainbow on your place with the amazing balance of red cherry tomatos and apples and lettuce and fetta done with an amazing sweet and sour seasoning is a wonder !
Would love to visit again and try the other dishes amidst the amazing ambience!

This place looks really nice but the food and service here sucks. Ordered for cold coffee ... So sweet that i cud make sugar syrup out of it ... Got it replaced .... But same story. Called for it the third time ... This time it came without sugar. Was served pasta but no forks were served.  By the time they gave forks the pasta got cold. Overall a horrendous experience. Bad food. Bad service

I had been looking forward on visiting this place but never could find either time or company. 
Last Saturday is when I found both, time and company!

Easy to locate.
Bright, artistic and unique interiors.
Cordial staff.

I ordered for two Green Apple Iced Tea drink that came in an amazingly creative, upside-down-bulb looking like vessel, but the taste of the same did not match up to the creative presentation. They must add items in this category, options were too less.

The next item was Mushroom Burgundian, which seems like the best dish over there, as everyone recommended that, and it lived upto it. I would recommend it further. It was very tasty but the quantity could have been more. 

Next I ordered for The TCH Chef's Special Burger. It was really good..the taste, quality and presentation!

Pocket pinch would be somewhere around 800 for two!

A good experience!

This new and ubercool opened its doors in March, and I visited it with a friend within a couple of days of its inception. The ambience is indeed very nice and the staff very friendly. Loved their wall arts in particular along with the d√©cor. We ordered Iced teas, one Peach and the other in Mango flavours to beat the heat on a summer afternoon. We were really impressed with the way they served them. They have these bulb shaped glass, which are too cute. We also ordered some Mushroom on Toast to go with our drinks. 
It was very tasty and the drinks very refreshing. Thumbs up to this new Caf√©!,

Went to the place with a large group, so got to try quite a few things. The food is great, especially the rissotto and the pastas. In addition, the selection of starters is quite well done. The Cottage Cheese Sizzler also deserves a mention.

Great friendly staff, are very accommodating. Ambience is nice and feels like a good place to chill with friends.

The prices are fairly reasonable for what we received.

Only reason the rating is 4.0 is because there were no Soda drinks.

New place, interesting decor, prime location just located in a bylane opposite Forum, Elgin road. 
Went on a busy weekday, place was pretty full. We were given a table on the mezzanine floor which was pretty cosy. Place has a relaxed vibe, nice art work adorn the walls.
The food is average but the coffee and tea ordered were pretty good. 
Ordered for a fries basket ( assortment of potato wedges, fries ) Nachos ( comes along with the same mayonnaise type sauce used in Inox movie halls, has no real cheese ) one honey spiced cappuccino which was pretty good and an oolong tea which was refreshing. 
Was there for hardly 30-35 mins, the table where we sat was actually reserved for some people I guess some larger groups, so the staff members came and said after 7 pm we might have to shift. I think the place is too new to be judged harshly. Can obviously come up with some new interesting menu choices . Would surely visit again. There are no complaints as such, pocket pinch is bearable, just wish they would make the food above average, the food served was nothing that I would crave for. But honestly the ambience is super cool and the place is pretty, surely a great place to hang out once in a while.

It's a European styled bakery on the ground floor and cafe on the first and a mezzanine floor to accommodate larger groups, with light woodwork and naked filament lights keeping the mood fresh and bright.
Ordered a Peach tea which was served in a glass bulb and was too sweet, green tea and Italian sizzler which was okay. The food and the drinks were little disappointing as the ambiance raised our expectations.

Decent subtle place just opposite cream centre elgin road.
Ordered a cottage chees sizzler and Mixed sauce pasta. Pasta was good and so was rhe sizzler. Pocket friendly. Staff are generous as they served us pasta with completely different veggies that we order and were quick to accept their fault and replace it. Thumps up !
Bit disappointed with live sports screening part. Don't get fooled by it expecting a good large screen and projector. It's just a small Televsion which airs the match.
But otherwise a good place to visit.

Had been here on a afternoon for a light snack between my meetings and the entire place kept me captive and freshened it up. The ambience was refreshing and perfect to sit think enjoy and relax. But the main part, the food. Some very good dishes. I would recommend the burger and the broccoli soup as a must have. It has been a while since i had them and the taste still lingers in my mouth. Repeated visit is a must.

You enter this place and you start wishing why did you think to enter AT ALL AT THE FIRST PLACE !
But then you climb the stairs and think that cmon it can't be all that bad and decide to give it a try ! Now you start ordering, so we had ordered for a dark chocolate cold coffee, since the name looked so different, it immediately felt like the thing to order, but once it arrived, you realise they have fooled you into buying plain old coffee and nothing new. We had ordered for bruschetta and a pasta with our own choice of toppings,ie, mushroom, broccoli and bellpeppers. So while the bruschetta was manageable, could have been baked for a much better taste, the pasta they got us didn't have either of the toppings to be found for what we ordered, so we asked them to replace it and then what they got had no trace of broccoli to be found and the pasta was so bad, the pasta was just not mixed well with the flavours, wasn't cooked enough. What I would request this cafe is to please stop fooling the customers by putting things on their menu when they dont have it in reality. Oh and talking of the service, ABSOLUTELY PATHETIC , I had to ask around 5 times for the iced vanilla latte, which by the way had no trace of vanilla when it arrived, 20 mins later, it was plain water and coffee, literally, no trace of milk or hint of vanilla in it.

While this was not enough, we were spilled with water while making an exit.

An overall pathetic experience.

This place is situated right opposite Cream Centre. Although the ambience of the place is nice and the staff was courteous, the food failed to impress us. We tried the cheesy garlic bread , arrabbiata (although we had called for a mixed sauce) and the Green Apple Ice Tea which were all okay. We also tried the Mushroom Risotto which was good. The service was very slow though. We had to wait for approximately more than 20-30 minutes for our pasta and risotto. Overall this place failed to match our expectations.

Situated just opposite cream centre in Allenby road is a small one storied cafe. Despite being small it is not crammed. We ordered for dark chocolate milk shakes ( it is available is coffee as well) it was delicious. Along with our drinks we ordered for the mushroom Burgundian and an eggless truffle cake. The mushroom was tasty and cooked well. The cake's texture was grainy but it was getting masked by the large amount of chocolate icing/ cream. That can be worked upon I felt. The draw back of the cafe was a strange odour that was coming as soon as you enter the cage which is not very appealing to the nose. I definitely recommend it. Kolkata needs such cafes.

The Country House - A Chic and Contemporary Cafe.
=====
Intro + Location:

It is located right opposite Cream Center. It is not at all difficult to locate as it is in the exact lane opposite to front gate of Shoppers stop, Forum mall. I had been here with a friend and was mesmerised with the ambiance. It is a newly opened cafe and after gazing at the ambiance, i took a seat. 
=====
What i ordered:

‚Ä¢ Cappucino - It tasted fine. I really liked the latte art work done on it.  ‚úå 

‚Ä¢ Dark Chocolate Coffee - It was topped with whipped cream and was a treat to the eyes. I took a sip of it as it was my friend's order. It tasted good. ‚úå

‚Ä¢ Fries Basket - It had comprised of French Fries, Potato Wedges and tikki type stuff with their special dip. The french fries were fine. The potato wedges were soggy and could have been much crispier. The tikki was oily but tasted just average. The dip was a complement to the taste as well as overall presentation of the basket. ‚úå

‚Ä¢ Bruschetta - It was the best out of the lot. I personally liked it as the bread was crispy as required. ‚úå‚úå
=====
Pros:

‚Ä¢ Good Ambiance.

‚Ä¢ Good hospitality. The owner personally was coming and taking care of the orders. 

‚Ä¢ Good Food presentation and quality.

‚Ä¢ Reasonably priced.

‚Ä¢ Pure Vegetarian 

Cons:

‚Ä¢ The wedges could have been better. 

‚Ä¢ The hospitality needs a little improvement. The waiters needs to be more aware about whether the dishes are available or not and about the content of the dishes.¬†
=====
Meal for two: 500-800

Summary:

Food Quality 4/5

Food Quantity 3.8/5

Taste 3.8/5

Presentation 4.1/5

Ambiance 4.2/5

Hospitality 3.9/5

Value for money 3.9/5

Conclusion:

I might revisit it again. I had a good experience here. Courteous and welcoming hospitality.  ‚ù§

Prime location, vintage look and feel, well behaved and caring staff, classy and tasty food, that's Country House for you! True to its name, it has an ambience as cozy as one's home.. with an array of dishes to cater to all..
Mushroom burgandian being the best.. TCH burger is highly recommended too üòÅüòÅüòÅ.. Dessert being their speciality i couldnt resist myself from trying 4 of them.. and they wre outstanding. A tea lovers paradise ( they have around 20 diff options) and a loners dream come true. Sit. Reminisce. Read. Eat. Repeat. With their free wifi service u have an option of sitting back and enjoying the ambience of blue and white walls, luminated bicycle..and a beautiful display of paintings. And for all those u want to chill, look no further .. The Country House is going to be the new talk of the town soon üôå

Absolutely ill mannered and undertrained staff. A particular person named Babloo spoiled the entire experience with his bad and un cooperative behaviour. When i asked for garlic on the side he did not even bother to ask the chef and said that the kitchen was busy. After that he said i dont want to argue with you. 
Will never return to this place and not recommend it to anyone.

I was a little hesitant of trying the place but turns out its a great place. It has a country charm to it as the name suggests. The signage itself is inviting and so is the look of the building. The european feel of the restaurant is quite refreshing and delightful. The menu is quite comprehensive and covers a wide array of dishes. Try the TCF burger, its exceptional. I also had a mushroom dish and an italian sizzler which were great. All in all , its a great hang out place with awesome food.  
Will definitely visit again.

Warning : This review might be a little sloppy as I was super sleepy before going to the caf√©, at the caf√© and still am.

What I loved:
¬∑      The pretty signage they had even while they were under construction.

¬∑      The numerous windows at Level 1.

¬∑      The luminous bicycle that was hung on the wall.

¬∑      The use of a lot of white and blue colour combination.

What I did not love:
¬∑      That eerie looking wall art. The birds look like a mix of reptiles and amphibians that finally evolved to a bird (on the extreme right) at last.

¬∑      There were cups hitting my head every time I leaned back. I was sitting next to the wall.

¬∑      The glass of water served to me was sticky. And, I am also not sure if that was even brought to me on a tray. (sleepy I was)

Service:
Had it ups and down. Need to have waiters ready to help you rather than you having to try to catch their attention all the time!

Food:
¬∑      Nahice! Went there to try the Mushroom Burgundian as I had a recommendation for it. Good stuff. Good plating. And super good toasties!

¬∑      Nachos looked nice. Would prefer that yellow sauce on top to be cheesier. It tasted like southwest sauce. And that sauce in that middle wasn‚Äôt that great either.

¬∑      Pasta was great too.

¬∑      Spiced Mocha Cappuccino was less sweet as asked. But it wasn‚Äôt served as hot as I generally like my hot coffee to be.

Would like to try out more things. Hopefully soon :)

A feel good place ! With large glass windows, doors, old bulbs and switches it takes you to the 20th century. And guess what?! The food is not disappointing at all. I tried a few things- Brownie shake, spicy cottage cheese sandwich, chilli cheese toast, cheese garlic bread and vanilla cold coffee. All try worthy, especially the garlic 6bread! Loved the ambience & the hospitality. The place is clean and tidy, also the restroom is well maintained. Was a bit disappointed with their bakery section. I tried almost all the patries and Brownies they have. The most disheartening of all was the swiss roll pastry. But I would definitely recommend this place to all.

A very conveniently located cafe with decent interiors. The ambience was great and we actually didn't realize that there was no music as the environment was very warm and welcoming.
The food was delicious especially the soup of the day, cream of mushroom is must for every mushroom lover. I had ordered for an Italian sizzler and a risotto, the taste of which was also up-to the mark.
The only thing to improve is that they should improve a little on their service. It's a new place and everyone takes time to start up a new venture.
Great going, all the very best for the upcoming future:)

Located very conveniently, opposite cream centre on Allenby Road, country house with its old-world charm proved to be a very pleasant experience. All-white & sunny, its interiors has a soothing atmosphere. For a pure vegetarian cafe, it offers sufficient variety - the dishes are fresh and flavoursome, the service is non-intrusive & adequate. Perhaps they could add a dessert page in their menu, though they do have a patisserie corner. I tried only a couple of dishes this first time but will definitely be back for more!

We went for brunch to this place which is very near Forum. It is a veg cafe. Very fresh ambience.
We ordered Mushroom on toast, Veg Club Sandwich, Mushroom Burgandian and Italian sizzler. The good was pretty basic, nothing great. But the Mushroom Burgandian was quite good. We also ordered some drinks to accompany. Hot Hazlenut, Hot Dark Chocolate and Americano, nothing worth mentioning just basic.
All together this place is quite basic nothing very impressive. The staff also needs to be trained properly. They are courteous but lack training.

Super impressed with the ambiance and the decor. Amazed by the tempting smells of food and coffee that keeps wafting in at regular intervals. And delighted by the fact that such a rustic-looking, organically and minimally decorated cafeteria with crazy white brick walls has opened up in Kolkata! One needs to and must visit The Country House for its great dark chocolate cold coffee, amazing Mushroom Burgundian and for the house burger and not just for its free Wi-Fi or its bewitching display of desserts. And if one does end up getting drawn inside by the creeper-and-vintage lamp facade, the burgers are a must try, and so are the sizzlers as well as the fries basket.

The cafe has just opened, so of course there will be some glitches. Which is only natural. For example, service can be notched up a bit, as can the music (which is good, but just does not go with the feel of the cafe).

Regardless of that, great work bringing the European independent workspace of laptop-coffee-free wifi for artists and professionals alike, here in the city. And that too, with really amazing food and coffee! Just tweak up your service, your music and maybe add a couple of items on your menu - and you'll be the next big trendsetter in a city obsessing over dirt cheap alcohol and crispy chilli babycorn!

Absolutely loved the food, the decor, the hospitality and the ambience! We were actually going to the cream centre and the country house stood bang opposite to it. We liked the decor from outside and we are happy we tried this instead of going to creme center. We had nachos, cheesy garlic bread, iced tea and the chocolate cold coffee. I personally loved iced tea and cheesy garlic bread. Iced tea had a brilliant after taste as well. A must order if you are an iced tea tea person.

It's one of those feel good cafes and I'll put it at par with the 8th day and 4 by 1.

Pretty much in the prime area is this not-so-spacious place loacted.
Ambience and decor scores pretty much a 5/5. Possibly one of the few places, where you wouldn't require music.
Talking about the food, the presentation is fairly decent and the taste doesn't disappoint as such.
Maybe another visit alters this opinion for the better.
