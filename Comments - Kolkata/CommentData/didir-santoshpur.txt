Superb quality bengali food available here, It's clean and very homely, You simply can't get sick by eating here, I have had almost every items of the menu and they are pretty amazing, nearly 8 types of fish are available here on daily basis. 

cost: For a average veg meal it costs 25rs with rice, dal, potato fry and one curry/sabji.
From egg to every kind of fish is available, at 60-140/ plate and quality is superb. Go try this sometime and you will surely love the experience if you are a fish and bengali food buff.
