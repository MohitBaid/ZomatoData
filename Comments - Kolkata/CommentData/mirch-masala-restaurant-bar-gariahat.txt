I have been quite a regular at Mirch Masala since my childhood days. I came back again to this Bollywood themed restaurant to try the Gosht Biriyani and Bhuna Gosht. And I must say this is by far one of the best mutton dishes that I have had in a long time. The biriyani is very different from the typical Kolkata style biriyani that we usually love and I must say it is a must try. The bhuna gosht was cooked to perfection. The food literally left me speechless. Definitely coming back here again to introduce my loved ones to this food heaven.

A great place to be if you like spicy and tasty delicacies. The Indian section of the restaurant has such a delightful and unadulterated Dhaba type ambience that one feels thrilled to be here. The food is economical and tasty at the same time. A must visit for all foodies.

If you r looking for a pocket friendly bar with a special dhaba type ambience this is your destination.. visited this place after scrolling through zomato on 1st January 2018..and trust me they didn't let our first day of the year go in vain.. 

Location :- just take the lane beside pantaloons.. walk a few steps straight.. This place is on ur left side.. u can see it from a distance the MIRCHI sign..üòé 

Ambience :- this place has two separate entrance one for the Chinese cuisine.. One for the North Indian.. We decided to hop onto the north indian cuisine for a quick drink and starter.. It was a specially designed to   give the original dhaba feel.. dimly lit with a yellow taxi coming out of the wall.. The wall had posters of bollywood stars and movies.. A perfect feeling..üòé to have beer with some lipsmacking kebabs..

Food :- 1) carlsberg light:- they serve 650ml unlike other pubs and bars where u get pints at the same price.. 

2) Chicken tangdi kebab :- 3pcs of juicy lipsmacking mouth watering kebabs.. trust me u will crave to have more nd more of it... 

The service was a bit slow.. but they were well behaved and polite...

Our total bill was 524 Inc GST..

I was there for the third time and no wonder Mirch Masala came up with huge mouth watering dishes I became fond of.On Christmas night we dropped by the chinese cuisine of Mirch Masala for dinner and they never fail to win my heart.This Restaurant has two cuisines side by side.One is North Indian and other one is Chinese.This is located in the lane beside the pantaloons of Gariahat.The first one is Chinese. We ordered
‚óèCrispy Chilli Baby Corn
‚óèNon-veg platter(2pieces of fried buttery prawn,3 pieces of fish finger,3pieces of fish fry,1 small crab piece ,2 pieces of chicken drumstick and a grilled pomfret)
‚óèMirch Masala Special mocktail
‚óèChicken egg wrapped fried rice
‚óèMixed hakka noodles
‚óèParsley Fish
‚óèChilli Lamb
The food was 10/10.In parsley fish the pieces of basa fishes were so tender and large and much different in coriander sauce.I loved it.Mocktail was refreshing which was a mixture of pineapple syrup and many more things I can't remember now but very good.The egg wrapping was so soft and cool looking thing.The crispy baby corn was as perfect as it was supposed to be.Okay,now coming to the interior subject.A lot of space,lights and decor nicely make a chinese feeling which snatched my mind.The staffs were very informative and well-behaved.

It was my post puja visit to this place.It has two branches one north Indian and other Chinese.I opted for the north Indian one.The beautifully adorned north Indian dhaba themed restaurant served us with tantalizing food.

We visited the place which looked fabulous with a dhaba type feel and Bollywood theme design. We tried a lot of stuff including paneer tikka masala and dahi ke kabab which were fabulous.
In the main course we ordered dal makhani, malai kofta and kadhai paneer along with naan n kulcha. 
The experience was amazing and the staff was cooperative. Do visit !

Mirch Masala Restaurant & Bar, Gariahat, such a nice restaurant with good food and great ambience. They have 2 different entrances for 2 sections - Chinese & North Indian with different ambience & decorations. We opted for North Indian.

As we went inside, we were welcomed by a desi, rustic atmosphere, that recreates the charm of countryside dhabas, of rural home & outdoor dining; and even though pretty unreal, an ambience that takes us to our villages. If you have been to this place, you must have spotted these things - paintings of Bollywood stars on the walls, half yellow Kolkata cab at one side and a big tree at the centre!

Above all these, they serve great food. We had cheese nan, rarha ghosht and ghosht dum biriyani, all of them were quite delicious. I can come here 100 times for that cheese nan only, it was mouth watering.

The service was a bit slow but worth the wait. Dining at an atmosphere like this, is more than a nice experience. The staffs are lovely & hospitable. The location is quite nice. All in all, a great spot for food lovers.

Mirch Masala is highly overrated. Located next to the Gariahat Pantaloons, the restaurant has both Chinese and Indian food on its menu. I have tried both and honestly did not like either.

I tried the murg gulmarg and biriyani. Both were bland. On another day, I ordered cantonese noodles and a chicken gravy. The chinese food was slightly better but trust me, I have eaten way better chinese food at half the price.

The interiors are funky but the food is strictly average. Wish they improve.

Being there with my friends during puja but this place fails to disappoint me at that rush time also.The place is very nice providing counters separate for Indian and Chinese.We ordered dishes mostly indian.The food is very well cooked.The favorite one of mine is Chicken bharta and Butter nan.The colouring and lighting is also very beautiful and peaceful.The inner decors are also great.

okay .... the name mirch masala is justified somehow as the food available  here is very much masaledaar.. üòÇ and the ambiance is teekhi mirchi which adds a great flavour to this place altogether.  
i am a pakka non vegetarian so i have only tried the non veg out here ... 
the butter chicken was lovely .
the kababs and most of the chicken items are amazing ... 
my friend said ...dal makhani and peeli daal is awsome here . 
so please do visit this place... 
its quite pocket friendly and the food is delicious.

This restaurant is located close to the Gariahat Pantaloons. 
The decor and ambience is super cool. It has a Bollywood feel to it with retro movie posters and music playing. It's done up like a roadside dhaba, and even has a yellow taxi coming out of a wall. 
The food is served in yellow metal plates and small buckets. The staff is very cordial and service is pretty fast. 
Coming to the food, it's nothing out of the ordinary. We ordered standard North-Indian fare, which was delicious enough.

Being there with my friends during puja but this place fails to disappoint me at that rush time also.The place is very nice providing counters separate for Indian and Chinese.We ordered dishes mostly indian.The food is very well cooked.The favorite one of mine is Chicken bharta and Butter nan.The colouring and lighting is also very beautiful and peaceful.The inner decors are also great.

okay .... the name mirch masala is justified somehow as the food available  here is very much masaledaar.. üòÇ and the ambiance is teekhi mirchi which adds a great flavour to this place altogether.  
i am a pakka non vegetarian so i have only tried the non veg out here ... 
the butter chicken was lovely .
the kababs and most of the chicken items are amazing ... 
my friend said ...dal makhani and peeli daal is awsome here . 
so please do visit this place... 
its quite pocket friendly and the food is delicious.

This restaurant is located close to the Gariahat Pantaloons. 
The decor and ambience is super cool. It has a Bollywood feel to it with retro movie posters and music playing. It's done up like a roadside dhaba, and even has a yellow taxi coming out of a wall. 
The food is served in yellow metal plates and small buckets. The staff is very cordial and service is pretty fast. 
Coming to the food, it's nothing out of the ordinary. We ordered standard North-Indian fare, which was delicious enough.

This is one of the favourite places of me and my husband. We often visit there, for dinner or simply for boozing. The food they offer comes in good quantity and tastes really well. I must name a few dishes that one must try here.
1. Mile jule kebab
2. Tandoori moorgh
3. Murgh dum biriyani
4. Gosht lababdar
Each of the dishes is their signature item. Other dishes are also surely as good as these. Still thinking? Well, give it a try. Then judge yourself. 
Thank you!
P. S. Visit the Indian section, not the Chinese one.

I m in love with plc. The interior decor is jst out of dis world. It has two parts.. The interior gives a rustic dhaba + bollywood feel. Its jst awsm. The staffs r super friendly. The food is damn good... Plzz try cheese naans... Its awsm. The paneer mirch masala was also good n chickn tikka lababdari had a chatpata taste but awsm. The Chinese part of it is under wrk... The interior is not complete yet. But the food is jst great. Szechwan rice n yum bang chicken r a must try. The mixed fried rice n hot garlic chicken is also good. 
Overall... Ambience 5/5(punjabi) service 5/5 food 5/5

The best thing I love about this place is they use bell metal (Kansa) utensils and it gives you that traditional Bengali setting. The food is good but for some reason I felt the service is slow. Really nice setting for family dinner but because of the theam big tall people like me have a headroom issue. üòõ

Mirch masala is located near pantaloons, gariahat branch. They have 2 sections : Chinese and North Indian. They have 2 different gates for that, with different ambience and decoration.
We visited the North Indian section.
The ambience was super amazing with the Rajasthani and Mumbaiya touch. They have epic dialogues painted on the wall. Bollywood superstars are also painted there.
The food tasted good. Should definitely visit.

Location: Next to Pantaloons, Gariahat
They have Chinese and Indian restaurant but separate one next to another. Both the restaurant have bar facility..  Indian restaurant is theme based one.. 
Huge spacious restaurant with Desi decor, wall paintings and ambiance.. Service is very slow on weekends.. Coming to the food we ordered:
*Murgh dum Biryani & onion raita was complimentary
*Murgh Lahsooni
*Butter naan &
*Green salad 
Spicy Biryani served in a small handi with 4 small pieces of boneless chicken without any potato and with high flavor of rose water.. Absolutely waste of money.. 
Murgh Lahsooni hardly had any flavor and butter naan was good.. 
Prices are too high but the quality and quantity is badüëé
Had a bad experience with biryani and their service.. 
Please try to improve ..

I went there with 2 of my school friends.located just behind Gariahat Pantaloons. Decorated mainly with Heros and heroines of Bollywood in a offbit way. We ordered Murg Malai tikka,3 butter Nun,Bhuna Ghost,Achari Murg . Except Achari Murg everything were delicious. Here 1 lassi costs 105 bucks!!!A bit expensive though. Bhuna ghost is a must try. Do visit it if you are bored with shopping in Gariahat. Decoration is a little bit cozy.

Its happy getaway break from shopping at Gariahat. I was looking for a good restaurant at this area . I found it at walking distance from the main market. I pulled my parents too against there wish to experiment , but I was adamant. I can say , it paid well.¬†

The Place:
Inside decoration was indeed interesting. Lots of options to sit . The low lit area¬† is ideal for spending few hours in the company of friends/family and some good food and liquor. I obviously couldn't dare muster the courage to order a beer for myself, but my Dad happily did.¬†

The food:
We had to wait a bit more that one usually likes . Prawns were a little chewy but tasted good. Paneer and chicken were really tasty. The total bill was around 400 RS/head which I would save not bad.¬†

The staff:
Staff was attentive. And courteous. They kept check on our needs all the time we were there.¬†

Why should you visit:
After a sweaty stroll in Gariahat market, its a welcome escape . You can chill, relax, let a few hours pass.¬†

My rating:
3 for food , 4 for the place itself. So average 3.5. It's a good option when you don't know much about the area. And you don't need to risk it. And you need to relax and let out the heat of Kolkata.

The place is situated just at the backside of Pantaloons. For its Bollywood Themed Interior and renowned North Indian dishes, they have made quite a big name. 

They have two sections - North Indian and Chinese. We opted for the North Indian one based on Zomato 's suggestion. Well coming to the interior, the decor is really unique with painted walls showcasing old Bollywood movies. It also has a yellow taxi prototype adjudged in the front. The seating arrangement was nicely manned. The lighting was a little dim and the whole place was too quiet. 

Coming to the food we ordered - 

Dahi Kabab, Masala Kulcha, Mirch Masala Pulao, Palak Paneer, Murgh Malai Tikka, Fish Peshwari Tikka, Roasted Papad and Kheer Jalebi. 

The Kabab was well marinated and it was really a nice option for starter. I clubbed the Kulcha with Palak Paneer and it was good go too. The gravy was a bit oily. Murgh Malai Tikka was the absolute showstopper and it consisted of 6 good pieces of chicken nicely cooked and garnished with Malai. 

The reason of deducting 0.5 from my rating was the terrible serving time. The starter came after 50 minutes of our order. Though the billing was fast. 

But my overall experience was fine.

We opted for their chinese section. Their north indian section is quite reknowned but we wanted to give a try their chinese part. The ambience was soothing when we first entered the restaurant but the staffs immediately asked how many people we were and we were shifted to first floor. The first floor is rather simple and you will feel like you are having dinner at your own home. Already some engagement ceremony was going there so we felt actually awkward sitting there. 
Anyways,lets come to food. We tried lung fung soup,fish fry,club chicken,chicken burnt garlic rice. Their fish fry was awesome. Rest of them were fine too.
Service was  prompt and staffs were courteous andpatient enough to answer all our curiosities regarding choosing dishes.
But the ambiance üòëüòë!!

Although it is more famous for it's Indian section, the Chinese section is also worth trying. Warmly lit with cosy interiors, the ambiance of this place is really nice. The staff members were very helpful and courteous. We ordered Chicken Wantons and Chicken Drumsticks for starters, and then Chicken Fried Rice, Red Wine Chicken and Schezwan Chicken for mains. We were very hungry, the food looked delicious and so, we started digging in at once. Everything tasted good and the quantity was ample - one plate of fried rice was more than enough for two people. Would definitely recommend this place.

The soup could have tasted better if it was a little bit lemony but the corriander overshawdows the lemony taste. Also had chicken pan fried noodles. The noodles taste amazing with all the veggies. Will go again for a proper dinner.

This is a Bollywood theme restaurant. We went here during puja. The time most of the restaurant rush people and doesn't care about food quality, this restaurant doesn't have any such issue. It has huge space inside, ambience is good. We went for north Indian food.
Now, coming to food quality, I liked their chicken Tikka and kesar jalebi. Presentation was also good.
Dahi kebab was not up to the mark. Overall, experience was good. We will surely prefer to go again here.

Highly overpriced which is of course a must say while reviewing bout this outlet.
Good food but that got overshadowed due to extensively less quantity.
Bolly-style decor adds the feeling of being in a dhaba.
Alcohol is highly priced.
Service is quite customer-friendly.
Courteous staffs wearing kurta pyjama again added to the dhaba-kind-of-ambience.
Overall the bill might lead one to utter frustration but trust me the quality n taste of the north indian dishes are capable of winning ones heart.

The ambience is good. You will get a road side dhaba like feeling. And the food is also good. We tried butter naan, prawn tandoori, dal makhani and chicken tandoori. The waiters are friendly and they behave well to the customers.

This is a Bollywood theme restaurant. We went here during puja. The time most of the restaurant rush people and doesn't care about food quality, this restaurant doesn't have any such issue. It has huge space inside, ambience is good. We went for north Indian food.
Now, coming to food quality, I liked their chicken Tikka and kesar jalebi. Presentation was also good.
Dahi kebab was not up to the mark. Overall, experience was good. We will surely prefer to go again here.

Highly overpriced which is of course a must say while reviewing bout this outlet.
Good food but that got overshadowed due to extensively less quantity.
Bolly-style decor adds the feeling of being in a dhaba.
Alcohol is highly priced.
Service is quite customer-friendly.
Courteous staffs wearing kurta pyjama again added to the dhaba-kind-of-ambience.
Overall the bill might lead one to utter frustration but trust me the quality n taste of the north indian dishes are capable of winning ones heart.

Went to this place today. It's located just near pantaloons. Take the lane to the right of pantaloons, from there it can be seen. 

Ambience is really nice. It's air conditioned and a bit dim inside. We initially went there for north indian cuisine as the zomato menu displays north indian items as well. But we were told they only serve Chinese. We however decided to settle there. Later came to know that there are two separate gates for North Indian and Chinese. Strange that they didn't say when asked! I 've cut 0.5 there. 
We ordered Chicken Shanghai Rice and Mandarin Chicken from main course. Shanghai rice was light and quite good. It wasn't oily or heavy. Mandarin chicken was less spicy. There were 8 medium sized pcs. The gravy was between sweet and spicy. The only shortcoming was that the coating on the pieces were a bit thick, else it would have been perfect. There I have cut 0.5. Quantity of chicken and rice was more than enough for 2 people. For dessert we ordered Darsaan With Ice Cream. It was average. I had to take this as chocolate brownie wasn't there in the menu and without dessert the heart won't be satisfied! 

Service is fine. But the waiter only served once. After that we had to serve ourselves. GST is applicable @18%. Total bill was ‚Çπ673. 

P.S. - Couldn't take the whole pic of the dessert. It looked really cute :P took a pic of only my share. Sorry :P

Off the main Gariahat Road following a lane you will find this themed restaurant. There are two sections of the restaurant, one serving Chinese and another one North Indian. Two sections are have separate entry gates. I did opt for the North Indian, so no idea of the decor inside the other section.

Talking of decor, the restaurant follows a theme of old Bollywood. It has sort of a dhaba type theme accompanied by the Bollywood theme. A yellow Kolkata cab prototype has been put for decoration on the upper floor and there are some other minor decorations on the ground floor where the bar is located. The front portion of the restaurant where the waiting area is situated, is also decorated nicely with nicely painted walls probably depicting some Bollywood movie scenes. Servers wear traditional kurta type dress following the dhaba theme. Brass plates and other serving utensils do follow the theme however the cutlery looked standard. Lighting was dim and the place was very quiet, even near the bar area.

Dishes I have tried here are, Murg Malai Tikka, Gosht (Mutton) Dum Biryani and Murg Guldar. Also added a naan to my order and a fresh lime soda to gulp everything down. No desserts were tried. The Murg Malai Tikka kebab was six pieces of standard tikka kebabs well coated in cheese. The kebabs were well cooked and tasted nice. Mutton Dum Biryani was not the typical Kolkata style and the big difference was evident when there was no potato in the Biryani. The taste was really flavorful and the Biryani had good helping of spices. The mutton, though moderately sized but was soft and tender and there was absolutely no bone in the mutton. Murg Guldar was suggested to us by the server, it was basically more of gravy and less of chicken as the chicken pieces were pretty small. The gravy was not overpowering though and the overall dish tasted pretty good and moderately spicy. Naans were well buttered and large in size. Lime soda was as it should be.

Pricing is a bang for buck! Usually themed restaurants are on the less budget friendly side however in this case, this restaurant is totally value for money. A cheque for two people came about ‚Çπ1100 including taxes. This included a Biryani, kebab, main course, flatbread and a beverage. Quantity was generous, one portion of Naan means two huge pieces, kebabs are six pieces per plate. Biryani is somewhat less quantitative, one plate would be good for a person. Main course dishes are good for two person per plate.

Service was above average, food was served quite fast however at times there were no servers around so had to wait for a while for one to come to place an order for extra naan. Servers are friendly though and help in choosing right quantity for the order. Billing was fast.

Overall, a recommended place to visit. Decor and ambiance is really nice, so a calm and peaceful dinner at this place is not a bad idea.

[PS: I apologize for the bad picture quality. The lighting was too dark and not at all suitable for photography. Did enhance the photos a little for better view-ability]

This place has two sections  offering  mesmerising Chinese and North Indian delicacies. Though I like the ambience of the Indian one a little bit more because of its unique concept but when I put a bite on the Panfried chili fish I feel I am on cloud 9. This is one of the best places to dine out in the Gariahat area.

I went yesterday with a friend for lunch. I have visited the place before, but this time it led me to write a review. We were very hungry and ordered Red Chili Pepper Chicken followed by drinks. The Red Chili Pepper Chicken was good with a tantalizing element in it. We asked the person (attendant) to suggest something spicy and he recommended Mandrain Chicken with Chicken Garlic Noodles. The noodle was not bad but the spicy component was missing. We were disappointed with the Mandrain Chicken as it seemed like a dollop of flour with a tiny bit of chicken in it. I personally don‚Äôt believe in wasting food but we couldn't eat the last pieces of it.

The ambiance was good and the price was reasonable. To sum it up, I would expect tasty food in future. Until then, I am keeping 1.5 along with me! Would love to add this up after my next visit there!

Went to this restaurant for more than 5 times but this time I wasn't satisfied much like before. Few Years back this was one of my favourite restaurant. Nothing to talk about Ambience of this restaurant, it gives you a Dhaba type of feel. Food Quality was Very Good but not at all satisfied with the quantity of food this time.We ordered Chicken Tikka Mumtaz, Fish Peshawari Tikka as starters and for the main course we opted for Masala Kulcha,Butter Naan,Bhuna Gosht,Dal Makhani.Along with that we also ordered Nimbu Soda as refreshments.My overall rating for this restaurant :
Food Quality : 8/10
Ambience:9/10
Service: 6/10

Mirch Masala has two separate yet adjacent segments/restaurants. The first one serves Chinese food whereas the other segment serves North Indian dishes. We opted for the second one. A dhaba themed bar-cum-restaurant, this place will give you a feel of entering a Bollywood movie set. There is an artificial set-up of Highway dhabas with their staffs dressed in kurta, pajamas.

Though I was accompanying a friend who is a big fan of the restaurant, we didn't order much that day. We placed an order for a beer and a full-plate Tandoori Chicken. The moment we ordered a bottle of beer, the waiter asked for our I-card to check if we were above 21 years. Though we laughed it out as we do not at all look that young, we appreciated the way alcohol consumption rules are followed there.

The ambience was dark and nice. They serve food in brass containers and plates which give a nice rustic feel. The Tandoori Chicken that had 4 pieces of chicken, was really good and juicy. Would like to visit the place again to try out some other dishes.

Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

Pocket pinch: 800 for two (approx.)

Visited during Durga puja, on the day of Astami, the place was shit crowded and we have wait for solid 45 mins to get a table for 2. Thats quite understandable as it was the time of puja and it was a huge rush. Everything seems mis-managed, had to asked 3 times and wait for 15 mins just to get someone to open the beer bottles. Even road side joints have tissue papers on their tables, here you have to ask them several time to get one. For starter we ordered Tawa fish which was really nice. Main course was so-so ( Butter nun & kadhai gosht or something like that). The main thing I liked about this place is the interior theme. Will probably try to skip next time if its pujo time. This was my second time there.

The interior was really impressive and they served food in brass plate to give you a native feel.

We came here on Navami and surprisingly we didn't have to wait in a long queue. Ith has plenty of accomodation and it was a bollywood themed restro. The paintings on the wall gave it a roadside dhaba look. 
We ordered tawa fish, butter nun, murgh makhani, pink lady and lemon cooler. Tawa fish was smoked spicy juice fish. Murg makhani was heavy creme clad boneless chiken. Punk lady was strawberry flavoured sweet lassi and lemon cooler was lemon flavoured sour lassi. 
We had spent a long 3 hours here inside the restro. Wish to come here again.

It was a monday afternoon. We a group of friends decided to drop in to have a nice Indian lunch. The restaurant is just beside pantaloons and is quite easy to spot. The indoor is quite well decorated and with lots of beautiful paintings and lights. But to our dismay when we took the menu card there were no indian items on the menu. When we enquired they told us that they will serve only chinese. So we had to replan.
For starters we ordered pepper garlic cottage cheese and dragon chicken. The cheese was undercooked and tasted really raw. The dragon chicken had shredded chicken tossed in some sauce. The sauce was really tasty but the chicken were so hard. We had a tough time in chewing. So both the starters really dissapointed us.
For main dish we ordered Veg fried rice, szechwan fried rice, Egg wrapped fried rice, manchurian chicken and chicken chengtu. The fried rices were quite good and was very tasty. The veg fried rice had a lot of veggies. If u love spicy food then u should definitely try szechwan rice. The egg wrapped friedrice was just superb. The side dishes were also good. Chicken chengtu should be given a big thumbs up.
The service was quite prompt. The staff were well behaved and did not take too much time in serving the food. Overall a good experience.

N.B - The management should remove Indian items from the menu given on zomato if they are not serving them.

If you want good tasty food, this is the place to be.. With seperate restaurants serving indian n chinese cusines, this is one of a kind resraurant.. The drinks are a bit on the expensive side and i feel that the food are bit overpriced, but still the quality and quantity makes up for it. A bit on the slow side in service and order taking though. The main usp of this restaurant is the innovative decor. With trucks and bus and other stuffs it gives a highway dhabha sort of feeling.

A reunion of friends. We thought the best way to celebrate is with a few drinks and dinner!!! So we went to Mirch Masala.
Now I'm not sure how do i start with the review. If I talk about the starters, the tawa fish was good. Barring this all the other items fell flat. The ajwain fish was missing flavours and how can I miss the kebab platter, it was dry, dull and tasteless. You can't even tell the difference between a chicken sheekh kebab and a mutton sheekh kebab. The biriyani was all right, however, if you don't order it, you ain't missing anything. Coming to the drinks part, I'll only use 1 word to describe them and it is BAD!!!!!
So pardon me but I'm never coming back to Mirch Masala!!!!

This place gets 4.5 rating only for its ambience. The ambience, which will make any bollywood fan go crazy. The Indian part of the restaurant was completely like entering a film shooting spot. Every corner of this restaurant will excite you to an another level. You will find a real yellow taxi (ambassador) inside it and many many more from which you won't be able to take your eyes off. 
Coming to the food, it was above average but not perfect. We ordered tandoori chicken, Dahi ke kebab, naan, pulao, chicken butter masala, chicken Mirch masala and Paneer lababdar. Everything was good except Dahi ke kebab which was not melt in the mouth type of Dahi ke kebab (which we usually expect). Out of all this items, I will recommend tandoori chicken, which is a must try. 
Coming to the price. That was on the high end but not that expensive. 
Overall, I am pretty impressed with this restaurant. It's interior will make you go crazy.

I visited this place few days back with my office colleagues. It is situated right beside gariahat pantaloons. There are 2 separate entrances, one for chinese and the other for indian or mughal cuisine.
We visited the mughal one.
The decor is okay and tries to bring out bollywood through the ages. The service is a bit slow and I felt the place was understaffed.
First of all the alcohol is very cheap. For starters we ordered tandoori murgh and chicken malai tikka.
The tandoori was was cooked just right. The spieces were just perfect and the chicken was soft and tender. We really loved it. But the star of our dinner was the malai tikka. It was absolutely delicious. The chicken just melts in your mouth. It was freaking fantastic.
The big letdown was the main course. We ordered chicken dum biriyani and some mutton side dish.
They serve the biriyani in small metal pots. They seemed a little too small and I felt the quantity was not upto the mark. But the big disappointment was the flavor. It was extremely overspiced. I pride myself as a foodie and after having just 7 spoonfuls I was done. I couldn't take another bite. The spices was so overpowering that I had to waste more than half of it. The same was the case with all my friends.
So if you want cheap and pocket friendly place to have alcohol and starters then this is the place. But go for the main course at your own risk.

It is a themed restaurat. Ambiance was not so good. There was so many people , so that service was too slow. Here speciality is north indian cuisin. But the food was not so good. It was avarage.

An after office visit. Was super hungry so rushed in. Soothing ambiance but dull lighting, decent & friendly staff. Ordered fresh lime soda, club chicken, crispy honey chicken & chilly fish. All of them tasted like heaven with distinctive flavors adding a spice to the taste buds. What felt us bad was they allow drunk people to shout & speak which actually offends & irritates others. Pls do look into this matter. Either make a separate space for them or tell them to behave in limits. Would recommend to pay a visit !!¬†

Happy food-fall.. :)

The decor gives out a rustic feel, and you get transported to the highway dhabas. Prefer their North Indian cuisine over Chinese. Cheese naan, daahi kebab, masala kulcha and gosht dishes. Staff is courteous too. Plus, alcohol is pretty reasonable out here. So this is a good deal.

I have been to this place many a times. Simply in love with the decor and food. The starters are really good. The quantity is also good. My favourite is Tandoori chicken and Babycorn cooked with palak(can't recall the exact name). This is our favourite destination for late night dinner after pandal hopping during the pujas. I remember visitng this place during the pujas at nearly 1 a.m. and being treated to delicious and hot food. Thumbs up.

Been to the Chinese Outlet. A simple and good food and beverage outlet. It is budget friendly and the food is great. We had ordered for Crispy Honey Chicken, Chicken Shanghai Noodles, Chicken Garlic Noodles, Red Wine Prawn and Sweet & Sour Chicken(this particular item might not be in the menu but they had prepared it). Food was really good and tasty. They provide very good quantity. Three of us were full before we could complete having everything. Ambience is good. Service is great. The Waiters know their job well. A great lunch!

Visiting this place since a long time!!the first time I went was when I was in junior school and trust me,I was excited as soon as I stepped in.The movie stars on the walls,the half cut taxi,the funny quotations,it's all very unique and eye catching.'Hyderabadi ghosht biryani' is different from the typical kolkata biryani but is very good and I recommend everyone to try it atleast once.'Murgh tawe ka' is also my all time favourite.the food here will not disappoint you and neither will the behaviour of the staff because they are very polite and greet people with smile.
The waiting line is long on weekends so I recommend you to book your table beforehand. :)

Place is good to hang out with gf or friends or family. But the main concern is with the drunk people who use some bad words. The food quality is good but the biriyani is not up to the mark.But if you want to hangout with friends and getting drunk then you have to go there. The ambience is also little bit of dark side. So you can enjoy your drink. 

One more point about the staff. They are little bit of slower side or they can easily confuse you about your choice of food.  But still recomnend every one to go and enjoy..

Well after such a long time I've decided to check in this restaurant.. This is a bollywood themed restaurant, you can find slogans written in different places..

Now come to the food, I've ordered hyderabadi murgh biryani and it was average, I've realised that typical kolkata biryani which has potato in it is the best biryani for me..

They have taken around more than 15 mins to serve my order.. Moreover, they have also taken much time to make my bill..

Thumbs down for their service.. They have confuse me in my choice of biryani and fresh lime soda.. As a result I've to cancel my order of fresh lime soda because they have already serve me mineral water due to some misunderstanding..

I don't recommend this place because of the following reasons..

1) The restaurant lighting is very dark.
2) Service is very slow.
3) Waitors try to confuse you by your choice of order.
4) Drunked people use bad language which is quit embarrassing..

I"ll recommend this place for such person who is alcoholic..

This was my first time tryst with a themed restaurant and I was pretty impressed by the ambiance. The entire restaurant is inspired by Bollywood theme and the very presence of a Kolkata taxi made it look amazing.
Coming to the food, it was equally brilliant. We had Chicken Tandoori, Fish Tikka, Hyderabadi Biriyani, Bhuna Gosht and fresh lime soda. Each and every item was delicious although I enjoyed the Biriyani a lot. It had a spicy and unique taste and was quite filling.
The staff members are courteous and it adds to their positive points.
Would definitely visit again!

But u must go n try their pure Indian cuisine. we ordered murgh dum biriyani, tandoori chicken, nun, murg gulbadan(shredded chicken item),paneer makhanwala.in desert we ordered kheer and gulab jamun. Hospitality is mind blowing.sevice staffs are very well mannered . they have a bar counter also. They serve alcohol to females only if they are above 25 and have proper id proof.

The decor was really pleasant. 
We order for chicken Tom yum and chicken manchao soup. Tom yum as said by the server was not at all spicy and it was suppose to be a clear soup bit it's was cloudy and slightly sweet. Sourness was not at all there. Manchao was okayish type.
For the mains we order pan fried noodles and chicken fried rice. Noodles was a bit tasteless. But the fried rice was good. We enjoyed the fried rice.

One of the best themed restaurants in whole of Kolkata.
The bollywood theme is not something new or unique but they have done well to make it awesome.
They have two separate buildings. One serving Chinese food with no theme.... Another serving North Indian food with awesome bollywood theme decor.
Dim lights, famous bollywood dialogues and posters, bamboo furnitures, trees, tyres and hand pumps totally makes the place worthwhile. Photo genic people...must visit place.
Coming to food, we ordered -
Red chilly pepper chicken - very well prepared with lots of spices. Can be eaten alone or with any roti available.
Gosht Badami - this was a let down but my fault, name suggested badam. No meat except butter chicken can taste good with that colour.
Hong Kong Rice - ordered just to satiate my hunger. Nothing special but worth the price.
Chatpata Shrimp - this was not in the menu but chef's special and special it was. My girlfriend liked it so much that we wanted to order another one but were already filled to neck.very tasty and not sweet like other restaurants cooking shrimps.
For drinks we ordered -
Masala Treat Special - again totally special, very well done with the masalas and salt covered glass. Ordered another one.
Bill amounted in the range of Rs1500.
Conclusion - totally worth the price and must visit for everyone. Do order the masala Treat Special and take a lot of pics.
Cost Benefit Ratio - 1:1

We headed into this restaurant around 6pm. It has actually two separate restaurant one is Chinese section and another North Indian based. However North Indian section was not open at that time. In Chinese section main course and foods was obviously Chinese types. We ordered for one plate fish finger and in dessert we took single scoop sundae. The taste of fish finger was just up to the mark. Decorations, ambience are quite impressive. Need to be mentioned the prices are reasonable. Pocket friendly.

We went to this place after a sudden plan. The place looks normal from outside,but the inside the restaurant the ambience is something‚Äã different, it's awesome and will match your nightlife mood. However,  since this is a bar and not a pub, there's no dance floor.
The food was good,we ordered chatpata shrimp,chicken tandoori,dum biriyani,paneer kulcha,cheese kulcha n chicken bharta
Paneer kulcha tasted good,but cheese kulcha just won our hearts,there was so much cheese in it that it felt like a cheese burst kulcha almost :p
Dum biryani tasted good too, however it was bit overpriced,and chicken bharta was nothing extraordinary. Chatpata shrimp tasted okay but had some kinda smell which was not good.
Chicken tandoori is a must try, because they serve really succulent and soft chicken,and meat lovers will surely fall for this dish
The waiters were decent and amicable and the ambience was awesome.
However it was bit overpriced compared to the food they served,but I don't mind visiting the place again at night, as the ambience of the place won my heart

Just beside Gariahat Pantaloons, this restaurant has two distinct sections, one chinese and the other north Indian. 7 of us went to the chinese section and had starters only. All of them had distinct flavours. The chilli fish I liked best along with the chilli lamb. The dry chilli chicken was good too. The corn and mushroom one was pretty well prepared too. There's nothing to complain about the ambience and the staff was quite helpful. Overall a decent experience.

The Only reason I am giving an extra . 5 is because they were quite fast in getting us the Bill :)

Jokes aside , I have been there twice and this is what I feel about the place . On Both visits I along with my family had to wait for about 30 minutes before we were offered a place to sit . Some of their tables are comfy while others are absolutely very uncomfortable . The food is Okay , I would rather prefer their Main courses which are good . Their starters especially the Hyderabadi hara bhara kebabs etc are tasteless and not worth ordering , However their Shikari Aloo is good .

If you want to try out this place just for the heck of it or to pass your time , then you could drop in here , but otherwise there are numerous fab places where you can spend your hard earned money on better food

Before I give any review I need to write one thing. . They don't take reservations on call and and there's always a waiting queue in weekends.
Location : just behind the Pantaloons gariahat. Easy to locate. 
Ambiance : it's a story . . Once u r in u won't believe it's in gariahat . It will surely take u to a whole different place. And you gonna like it. Hell of a kind.
Food: quality and quantity both are good. And taste? Just like u have thought the pure North Indian dhaba style dishes with more sophisticacy. 
Staffs: eversmiling and always helpful. Not only in taking orders or suggestions but also if u want little things like change AC direction or get ice cubes for ur. Cold drink 
Waiting time for food is quite long though. It's better u give your orders all at once
Coming to our food : we had chatpata shrimps ( chefs special on that day ) it was khatta Mitha style as the name suggests. Then came the full tandoor murgh. A decent starter. Chicken was tender and soft but spice was less. After that we had cheese nun. .And butter nun with murgh Mitch masala. Mouth watering. Just mouth watering. . Want to have it again while writing about it. Then there was dum biriyani. Personally I don't like this taste of biriyani but it comes with 6 piece chicken . So I liked it. 

Overall a nice experience with

A full 5star for the taste n quality of food. Price is bit on a higher side but never mind as long as the food is delicious. Only backdrop is during rush hours,they get really slow in serving. Other than that a fully recommended place.would like to visit again. Indian dish quantity is very less for the price they charge. 
Had also visited their chinese section. The food is good in taste. Quantity wise also ok for two. Tried their chilly french fries,manchurian chicken,and chikken hakka noodles.

Visited this restaurant quite a few times. Can't say that in love with this place, but overall experience is average. Nothing so special about the decoration. The bar doesn't looks that appealing to me. Last time we me and my wife visited this place, so this review is mainly on my last visit. We ordered 1 Tuborg Strong and a Capirosca. They completely ruined the Capirosca, it was too sour, have to add sweet punch to it. Although they corrected it on the next order. The  chicken kebab was a little bit hard. Not that moist which it should be from inside. Then we ordered bhuna ghost which is great along with Masala kulcha. A bit disappointed with the cocktail.

Ambience : Good .feel like we reached some 90's location.
Service : Very lazy attitude and tremendous slow service .We order started  chicken Mumtaz and fresh lime soda at 7 pm and it was served at exactly 7.42 pm. We thanked God that we didn't order main course.

Quality of food : Pretty average.

Food & ambience is good.. Have to wait a bit to get the food delivered at your table. But beware of the parking problem. The gateman will assure you at the time of entry that it is a free parking for their customers of the restaurant. But at the time of exit the people in charge of parking on the road will charge you & the gateman will too support them.

Its been quite some time that Mirch Masala is serving some marvelous food and I have been there many times. Other than the food, what I like is their very innovative decor giving the feel of a roadside dhaba with the paintings of very much believable Shah Rukh Khan, Madhuri Dikshit, Sanjay Dutt, etc. To add to the authenticity, they have placed a truncated taxi. The menu card is also innovative where one can find (mis)quotes of some bollywood greats like Amitabh Bachchan, John Abraham, etc, who seem to be eternally grateful to Mirch Masala for making them what they are now. Also, they serve food on brass plates which is again a not so common idea. Coming to the food, though they serve both Chinese and Indian/ Mughlai dishes, I have tried their Chinese varieties once only and it was pretty decent. Their Indian section is absolutely luring quality wise. I have tried more or less all the variants of kebabs they serve and love them. Their main course food is also worth mentioning. Overall, my experiences have been nice every time I have visited there. I would highly recommend this place, only that, the food and drinks seem to be slightly overpriced to me.

The only restaurant in Kolkata which I visit the most for dinner. 
Nothing new to say about the resturant, its better from all aspects. 
The must try foods here are- Masala Kulcha, Gost Dum Biriyani (one of the best), Kebab Platter. These are the things that I love the most here.
The themed resturant is well decorated. 
One thing should be improved is service. One has to call again and again for something which is annoying. But this is  compensated by the great food.

Easy to locate, pocket friendly, amazing ambience and good food sums up this place... We ordered Mutton biryani, jeera rice, dal makhni, palak corn, veg jhalfrezi and butter milk... The best was Dal makhni... It was perfectly cooked with the butter on top adding to it's richness... Palak corn was good... Rest of the items were okayish... My overall ratings would be:

Food-4/5
Ambience-4.5/5
Service-3/5

We were disappointed with the service due to the delay in serving food... The restaurant was practically empty when we entered still had to ask for water 4times before we received it...

Overall a good place if service improves...

Well with a very convenient location right on the lane beside PC Chandra, the place has the ability to be a well to do food outlet but it did not turn out to be any noteworthy. The food quality and quantity was very good no doubt but the taste was of very common chinese and nothing exciting to the taste buds. The ambience is a bit compact but for a few drinks with a light dinner it's a very recommended outlet. The service of the staff was very good although the outside security wasn't.

Located in the lane beside Pantaloons, Gariahat , Mirch Masala was on my to-eat-at list for a long period of time. Entered around 9. Jam packed with a pretty rowdy crowd. Most of the people there were drunk. So ambience not so good. But then we were led to a secluded section. The restaurant has a theme of a roadside dhaba. The design of the menu card added a filmi elaan to it. 
Coming to the food, we ordered lasuni kebabs, butter naan, bhuna gosht , chicken Gulbar. The food was a little bit oily. The pieces of meat served were absolutely miniscule. 
Barring these problems, the overall preparation was decent. The pocket pinch wasn't too much. Overall a decent experience but not one I would like to repeat again.

Went to this place yesterday with friends for a midday hang out. Sole plan was to have kebabs and beer. That z why this place was closen in the first place. Captivating ambience, extremely corteous staff, filmy outlook and movie stars everywhere starting from the walls to the menu card. Special mention to the half kaali-peeli taxi and movie lines everywhere. Coming to the food, we had only ordered probably 2 and a half@ plates of tandoori chicken and a plate of boti kebab. To say the tandoori chicken was awesome will be an understatement. I personally have never tasted such brilliant tandoori chicken ever. Definitely coming back.

Food is just great and specially the starter (paneer tikka kabab and dip of green chutney). The drink rate are same as any nearest locality bar situated. The ambience is good. Overall a good experience with Mirch Masala and the food is also chatakdar as the name of this place. Name defines the food taste here.

We found our bollywood star on the other way even the menu card design is also markable. The food quality,quantity and teast is also fantastic. But I love that place more for the decoration. It is just behind the gariahat pantaloons and they have also a Chinese cuisine separately. As per my recommendation it is the much visited place.

Location : This restaurant is tucked just in the lane beside pantaloons gariahat outlet, at the left side.
There are 2 difference entrances for the chinese and Indian sections.
Ambience : The Indian flavour is presented well with slightly strong bong feel - a portion of a yellow cab,bollywood posters only add to the charm.The RANVEER SINGH's pic right over the menu card is worth a special mention-not because I'm a die hard RS fan,but also 'cause it's pretty catchy. üòÇ 
Brownie points for the well behaved and informative staffs.
Food : We ordered -
1.Chicken Tikka Mumtaz : Six Juicy Chicken Pieces Grilled To Perfection With Just The Right Amount Of Royal Spices.This Was Served With Salad.
2.Mirch Masala Veg Pulao : A handi full of rich & spicy rice item loaded with Veggies And Sweet Corn with a dash of sweetness.
3.Butter Nun : Very soft,a bit sweet & freshly baked.
4.Fish Masaledar : Succulent fish cubes with a super yum gravy.
A total 10/10 from each and every aspect.
Certainly going back to try the other dishes.

Two famished persons - me and my friend - went in there. Alas, the North Indian section was yet to reopened for the evening, so we went to Chinese section.

I have come here for the first time, though it was near to my home. I had the taste of Mirch Masala in Ahmedabad, where I had the real taste of dhaba - charpoy, tyres, etc. In Kolkata, I could not visit the North Indian section, I missed that ambience. The Chinese section is formally decorated with Chinese styled lamps and other accessories. Ample amount of seats. We sat down comfortably. The Maitre de table efficiently guided us through the strange Chinese names. We chose American Chop Suey and club chicken. The food arrived within 7 minutes. The staff are very courteous and helpful. The food was excellent....good to taste, enough quantity. Not much expensive.

Ample car parking space by fee.

I intend to try North Indian section sometime in future.

Visited this place a number of time. Once this place used to be one of my favourite in town, when Zomato wasn't that popular to me and options were limited.
The ambiance you get to see as you enter is of Bollywood movies and Indian Dhaba. A half yellow taxi is kept just on the left side of the stair. The entire restaurant is decorated with pictures from Bollywood movies posters and their themes. Dimly lighted and a perfect bar ambiance.
The food is no doubt good. I came here mostly for North Indian dishes. Their Chicken Kadai is one of the best I had in town. Biryani is also good. And their Tandoori Chicken and Kababs are brilliant, I could never have enough of them, always felt like ordering one more plate.
They have a separate Chinese section. And their food quality and quantity is also very good.
Service and Staff behavior is excellent.
Must Visit :)

The restaurant located next to Pantaloons, Gariahat is a center for¬†authentic Indian food, especially¬†north Indian cuisine.There is an ornate door through which you enter the two-storied restaurant and the interiors will make you feel you are seated in a roadside Dhaba, with pictures of trucks painted on the walls, lanterns hanging here and there and the special attraction is the broken yellow taxi-cab standing in one corner; a part of the rustic decor.Food is served in brass plates and glasses.To start with you can try their wide variety of chicken, mutton and fish kebabs-spicy, tangy and delicious.We ordered the Palak Paneer, Achaari Murg, Bhuna Gosht, Kadai Murgh and crispy Naan to go with them.The food was a bit on the spicy side, but it was lip-smacking nevertheless and though I am a chicken lover, by all means, this time I enjoyed the Palak Paneer, the gravy was perfect and the paneer was soft and creamy.We tried Gulab Jamun and Kheer, and then the exquisite Saffron Jalebi which we dipped in vanilla ice cream¬†(this concoction was suggested by my friend) and it was a delectable combo!For lovers of spicy Indian food, here's your ultimate destination.

Ordered some very basic dishes. A Chicken Clear Soup and Chicken Drumsticks for starters and a Mixed Fried Rice and Chicken Munchurian in mains.
The clear soup was bad. It was sweet and lacked salt. Drumsticks were good. Rice was good but quantity was a bit less. Munchurian was okay.

Overall, a very average experience. There's scope for improvement!

I've only visited the Indian section! Quality and taste of food is quite good!! Ambiance is also good but service can improve a bit!! And I don't like the fact that it remains closed from 3pm-7pm. For many people this is the optimal lunch time. The Biriyani and Kebabs are delicious. Prices are moderate!

Have been several time to this bollywood themed restaurant and have found the same lip smacking taste in all my visits... must try the lemon cooler it is amazing with juicy starters which is heavenly for ur taste buds... Also,  they have two separate sections,  the other being the chinese section and the decor is then set accordingly.

It's been over a month since I visited this restaurant with lights as bad as their food and it was the most horrifying experience anyone could ever have. The ambience is so terribly disgusting beginning with the poor quality light bulbs accompanied by useless decorations resembling that of an old truck; which is utterly irritating. The tepid food is also an active ingredient in annoying the shit out of anyone who unfortunately chooses to visit this restaurant. The biryani has been specially made for people with few or no teeth ( The mutton is so boiled to death you won't need teeth for it) . Most of the other dishes will also excite your taste buds in the most disgusting ways. But one thing the restaurant promises solemnly is that you will never visit this restaurant twice unless you lose your taste buds or maybe your mind.

The place over the years has retained their claim of being one of the best in the north Indian segment. Melt in the mouth kebabs like the peshawari machchi tikka and the chicken reshmi kebabs are recommended as is the jangli kebab. Kali dal in a bucket is a must have. I find the gravy based dishes a little over powering at least in case of the fish gravy based dishes. The mutton bhhona gosht was perfectly done. The service is a little slow but the food makes up for it. The taxi as a service table adds to the quirkiness of the decor.

We came to Mirch Masala to celebrate a friend's birthday. It is beside Gariahat Pantaloons. It is an incredible restaurant that offers a fresh taste of Indian and Chinese . Background music added calmness in the atmosphere inside.
Ambience, decor, sitting arrangements were good.
At starter , we took Tom yam chicken soup, Okai chicken soup, dragon chicken, pepper garlic fish along with fresh lime soda.
Both soup served with bread roll were delicious with nice fillings and aroma. Dragon chicken tasted superb. Pepper garlic fish was awesome with succulent fish pieces and tangy taste.
Fresh lime soda was terrific, ideal to beat the summer heat.
For main course we had black pepper fish, yum bang chicken, Shanghai chicken rice, Beijing chicken noodles, Singapore mixed noodles and salad. Quantity was generous and service was fast.
Black pepper fish and shanghai chicken rice combo was terrific. Fish was soft with a hint of sweetness and hotness of black pepper added a terrific combination.
Noodles were spicy and overpowered the taste of Yum bang chicken , which was average.
In desserts we had 'Darsan' with ice cream, which was enjoyable.
Price was reasonable too.
A must visit.....

A place nearby to our locality and is one of my personal favourites when it comes to Indian and mughlai cuisines.Have been a regular here along with close friends during college days but with the emergence of concept cafes in and around had almost overlooked this one for quite a few months. Even though we're visiting this place after a long stint feelings & vibes were the same. We were cordially greeted by the staff who even recognised us. We ordered for Planter's Punch & Kaipiroshka along side Kadhai Chole.This was followed by my favourite Tawa fish and a couple of straight drinks. However we didn't go for main course as we had some other commitments. But for me the Dal tadkewali Lasuni naan,Achari murgh,Bhuna Gosht,Kadhai Machli deserves a special mention when it comes to main course.Their Chinese section is also good but the Indian one simply stands out.I would love to visit this place time and again as for me Old is Gold üòâüòÉ.Souvik Svk Ghosh

Mixed hakka noodles: good in taste. Not oil soaked. Includes prawn chicken egg and vegetables. Enough for 2 persons. 
Chicken manchurian: good too. 8 pieces of chicken. Enough for 2 people. 
Its a decent restaurant.

This restaurant is located inside the lane right beside Pantaloons in Gariahat. It's quite an old restaurant and is probably one of the first themed restaurant in Kolkata. I love the ambience here. Totally Bollywood themed filled with Bollywood posters everywhere. The yellow taxi gives a very quirky touch to the d√©cor. The staff are well trained and polite. Their kababs are quite tasty. The biryani is good too. Pocket pinch is moderate.

3) well behaved staff
cons-1) quantity is very less as one person can finish any bowl of fried rice with a side dish with some starters and still feel hungry.

This place has bollywood in its blood! The walls have them all- Shahrukh, Amir, Amitabh. Even the menu card isnt that far off!
Mirch Masala is definitely amongst the top North Indian restaurants in Kolkata. The food is too good for the price at which it comes!
The service is really warm. They'd be advicing you throughout your meal, taking feedback on everything they serve.
Dont go to this place unless you are really hungry. Theres too much to eat!

Starters:
The 2-3 entrees from Chaat are good! Reminded me of the same from Mumbai. Paneer Tikka is really good. Tender and spicy. Chicken starters are decent, can be given a miss.

Main Course:
The place serves the best Dals Kolkata. Pick Dal Tadka or Makhani according to your taste. Both equally good. The curries served here are good too. Do consult them regarding the curry. They get it right more often than not.
The Biryani served here is highly underrated. I find it to be amongst the top 5 biryanis in Calcutta. Growing up in Mumbai, have developed taste for a different kind of biryani. Calcutta loves its biryani! But a slightly different variant. The Mirch Masala biryani is closer to the Mumbai biryani than the Calcutta one.
Do give it a shot.

Desserts:
The place serves really good desserts. Gulab Jamun should not be missed! Even jalebi is really good.

Must try:
Dal Tadka, Chicken Biryani and Gulab Jamun.

Its a crime to walk out of Mirch Masala without having their lassi!

Cheers to this nice restaurant. Prices are reasonable, quantity is sufficient, easy to locate and the food is super awesome. 
We ordered tandoori murgh, mirch masala special mutton pulao bhuna gosht and kesariya jalebi. From tandoori chicken to jalebi, each and every dish cooked to perfection. The mutton pieces in bhuna gosht were tender and the pulao was going so well with it. Even during Durga puja when most of the restaurants make their food unpalatable, Mirch Masala could satisfy us by maintaining their usual quality.

Situated below the Park Palace hotel this place is something which can make you go BONKERS...!!! with there excellent preparations, chinese and Indian both. Well both the different cuisines are served in two sort of outlets as you wish to want to name it. One with a chinese decor and the other with a speechless Indian decor. Anyway back to reviewing, I will base this review in terms of :- 1. Ambience and decor 2. Food quality and quantity 3. Service

1. Ambience and decor-- I always wanted to try this place out from a long time after hearing lots about it from one of my friends but never got a chance till today. We tried out what you can say the chinese-half-of-the-game. Well to be frank when I was about to enter I thought it to be just another "grain in the sand" but it all turned out to be a somewhat you can say "different ball-game". Slightly dimmed lights accompanied by pleasant and soft music presented a calm and soothing atmosphere to dine at. To me,  well, I will give a thumbs up for the ambience.

2. Food quality and quantity -- Time for my favourite part..... but this time won't be able to serve with a lot of details as I have bagged a little less than the other times but this place made us people happy be it through a puny order. This time we ordered for a  Hot and Sour Chicken soup and American Chopsuey of which I am coming to one by one. But before I start off this must be kept in mind that the version of Chinese food we have in India is a bit different from that we find in China, similarly there is an American style of making chinese food and many more.

Hot and Sour Chicken Soup -- Before I start, this is one of my most favourite basic and simple soup preparations of all times sake and never thought it to be so much upto the mark till I had it here. Well coming back to the topic as told before In India, this soup is made with red and green chillies, ginger, carrots, snow peas, tofu, soy sauce, rice vinegar and a pinch of sweetness, sugar. The genre which comes out is thick and spicy and delicious if made with the correct proportions. And well so was it at this place and quantity was also great, two of us shared with ample to have.

American Chopsuey -- This dish on the other hand I nicknamed it as "all-you-can-eat" dish. Well this is such a dish which is made of "miscellaneous leftovers" and is a dish in¬†American Chinese cuisine and other forms of overseas¬†Chinese cuisine, consisting of meat (often chicken, fish, beef, prawns, or pork) and eggs, cooked quickly with vegetables such as bean sprouts,¬†cabbage, and¬†celery¬†and bound in a starch-thickened sauce. It is sometimes served with rice which can be altered with the Chinese-American chow mein¬†with the addition of stir-fried noodles. Well here the preparation was served, tasted impressive. The sauce was not too sweet yet not too bland, undoubtably a balanced make and was "lip-smacking" tasty. Quantity was good and meat chunks properly cooked.

3. Service -- Service was one in a million by the well groomed staff. Polite, well behaved, upto the mark which adds up much more to the whole experience.

All in all a place you should experience, needless to mention the Indian cuisine and the fabulous chinese. A highly recommended place for all the food lovers out there. Walk in and enjoy......

Visited this place with friends in search of some authentic north Indian cuisine. Fortunately, we were not disappointed. The ambience isn't spectacular and the walls are painted with some fictional snippets of bollywood stars on the highway.¬†
The menu is decent too. We ordered tandoori chicken (well spiced), chicken tikka (tender and flavoursome ) and mutton seeh kebab (chewy and bland). The pickled onion and mint chutney were good. For the main course we ordered chicken karahi, dal makhni and murgh tikka lababdar. All dishes were good but not spectacular. The flavours were as one would expect. The kheer to top it off was fresh.Ambience- 3/5 (unpretentious, nothing fancy)Food- 4/5 (they hit the right notes here)
Service- 2/5 ( fiirst starter arrived after 25 minutes)Value for money- 4/5 (a three course meal for 4 cost around 3k with taxes)Not bad overall

We ordered achari murgh with Gosht hyderabadi biryani along with lasuni murgh tikka and masala kulcha. It was great taste. The feel it gives sitting in jute rope seats with old posters and articles are just great. I love visiting this place.

Visited last Saturday to grab a quick lunch with my husband. Ordered for dragon chicken for starter and american chopsuey for mains. Man ... The dragon chicken was really spitting fire... The concerned attendant did warn us about the dish being spicy but we didn't expect it to be that spicy. Those who love the kick of heat of chillies ll love this. Disappointment was american chopsuey. The sauce was red based sauce but it was too sour for the palate... Thumbs up to the quantity served of both the dishes, staff behavior and ambience.

Review for the North Indian restaurant:

I have been frequenting this place for years. I have had nothing but only the best of experience here every single time. It is a family friendly place with a delectable menu range, cordial staff, one-of-a-kind ambience (with surprising attention to detail) and a convenient location. You must, must¬†try the Methi Roti, Seekh Kebabs, Bhuna Gosht, Lasuni Murgh Tikka, Tandoori Murgh, Tandoori Pomfret, and the Achaari Murgh. Visiting this place has always been a pleasant experience!

Heard a lot about this place so at last visit there last Friday. We reached there @ 6:40 almost so we have to wait till 7 as the dinner starts from 7 only (North-Indian one). I guess we were the first guest to enter the restaurant. Yes I like the ambiance it will give you a roadside dhaba feeling. Now, coming towards the food.. as I was in no mood of having anything for main course. One of my friend who is very regular there asked me to try Shikari aloo and they ordered Shikari murg n one more chicken item (won't remember the name)... The Shikari aloo is a must try for people like me who are vegetarian. Price is also reasonable.. Overall a good experience..

This restaurant is located on the lane beside Pantaloons Gariahat. It has two separate restro by the same name, one for chineese and the other for north indian cuisine. I have visited both. The decor and food of the north indian one is way better than the chineese one. The north indian one is bollywood dhaba themed with even a half taxi in it. 
Pricewise very okayish. Food just good enuf.

Review for the North Indian restaurant:

I have been frequenting this place for years. I have had nothing but only the best of experience here every single time. It is a family friendly place with a delectable menu range, cordial staff, one-of-a-kind ambience (with surprising attention to detail) and a convenient location. You must, must¬†try the Methi Roti, Seekh Kebabs, Bhuna Gosht, Lasuni Murgh Tikka, Tandoori Murgh, Tandoori Pomfret, and the Achaari Murgh. Visiting this place has always been a pleasant experience!

Heard a lot about this place so at last visit there last Friday. We reached there @ 6:40 almost so we have to wait till 7 as the dinner starts from 7 only (North-Indian one). I guess we were the first guest to enter the restaurant. Yes I like the ambiance it will give you a roadside dhaba feeling. Now, coming towards the food.. as I was in no mood of having anything for main course. One of my friend who is very regular there asked me to try Shikari aloo and they ordered Shikari murg n one more chicken item (won't remember the name)... The Shikari aloo is a must try for people like me who are vegetarian. Price is also reasonable.. Overall a good experience..

I went to mirch masala Chinese at Durga Puja Ashtami.
The food was terrible and the service was horrible .In our table we don't had tissue paper even water.

Waiter's are overlooking when you're approaching them.

They only had selected 10 to 15 menu which was horrible and most third class Chinese I ever had in my life.

Please try to avoid this restaurant .

The restaurant is very conveniently located just beside the lane of Gariahat pantaloons.
Mirch Masala has two sections- Indian and Chinese with liquor.We went for the Indian section.
It is a dhaba type restaurant serves good north Indian food and it's Bollywood themed decor really stands out and the creates a vibrant ambiance.

We Ordered : Tandoori Chicken Full and Murg Hyderabadi Biryani.

Tandoori chicken was nicely prepared.The big pieces of meat were succulent and well cooked.
Next we had Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani.It was served with raita and salad.It was a minty green biryani with a touch of vegetables and chunks of shredded chicken.It was unique and tasted very light comparing to the traditional biryani.

Staffs were polite and knew about the dishes when asked but the service was slow and we asked
repeatedly for the water and also the food came about 15-20minutes after we ordered.
Prices were little bit on the higher side and they should update their menu card on Zomato.

Went to this place during the pujas & we were welcomed with the puja special menu card with a very few number of items which is very common in this time of the year in West Bengal. Ordered Tawa Fish, Butter Naan, Hara Lasooni Naan, Chicken Guldar & Fresh Lime Soda. The Tawa Fish was a little to tangy to my liking & the Hara Lasooni Naan had a little less amount of garlic. The other items were very decent.

I have found some amazing food in their starters. I went out with my friends there to chill. We ordered our drinks with red pepper Chilli fish and chicken. The fish was amazingly outstanding. Though it's a Chinese restaurant, I found the chicken to be on the kofta side which was even palatable. The staffs were courteous. I wanted to sit downstairs as its more Cosy and dark. But they said they have some renovation going on. So we settled down upstairs which is bit bright for me. But overall a good day out!

Located in the alley beside the Pantaloons outlet in Gariahat, Mirch Masala will attract you by its fantastic Bollywood decor once you enter it. The SRK's and Amitabhs and Madhuris and all other Bollywood legends are there to be seen. And keeping up with their decor is the manner in which they have named their food items. ¬†The food is excellent as well and it comes at an affordable price. The nice place for a large get together between friends.

The ambiance is nice, service is quick.
The bhuna gosht is highly recommended, the mutton melts in your mouth, spicy and juicy.
I like the lassi too.
There are too many options so basically you need to visit this place at-least 15 times to find out all about the menu.
The price range is on the higher side but then its absolutely worth it.

If you visit this place even once. This item should be a must on your order list!  N yes not overpriced at all considering the beautiful interiors :)

Mirch Masala.. An indo-chinese combo restaurant with nice food and a light ambiance.. We opted for the chinese cuisine. The eatery is nicely decorated but a soft music if was there could have been better for the mood. 
We ordered fried wantons, hakka noodles and hot garlic chicken. The fried wantons was a disappointment as the quantity served for the price taken didnt seem fair and the dish didn't  do justice to the actual fried wantons.  
Hakka noodles and garlic chicken was enough for two person.  Hakka noodles was ok but wasnt that dry as it should have and the garlic chicken was good though, would have been better if the soya sauce was a bit less. 
Service was fast and the people working there had a pleasant smile. 
An average experience all over.  Actually I had heard the Indian cuisine is better,  will give a try next time.

A very basic restaurant alongside the bar, serving Mughlai and Chinese Food.. Mainly people come here to have some drink over some food. The food is very average though the plus point is the quantity.. Ambience is not so dull but a lil music would have enhanced the interiors.
Coming to the bar menu, stock of liquor is very common, not so exotic.
Pocket pinch is on a higher side keeping in mind the taste and flavour and also the option of other places in that area..
P.S. After 3'o clock they stops serving the mughlai menu and switches to Chinese.

Half of a yellow taxi with lots and lots of technicolour posters of yesteryear superstars adorn the entire two storey eatery. Full marks for such a novel d√©cor
Coming to the food....
We had reshmi kabab to begin with. Good.
Then came in the garlic nun n tandoori roti along with chicken mirch masala.Again .... good.
However the sabzi pulao that we ordered next was an absolute disaster.....undercooked rice n vegetables mixed together in a bowl.
The quantity is very less considering the price.
They also have a Chinese food outlet beside the one that serves north Indian dishes.
Just a one time experience.... that's all!

To day we went there... Though we are frequent visitors of gariahat... We have never ate here....
They have different sections for Chinese and Indian cousin...
We opted for Chinese...
Coming to ambience ,decoration and behavior of the staffs are really good...
We ordered
1.chicken hot and sour soup
2.fried chicken wantons
3.veg fried rice
4.chicken Manchurian
The soup was cooked with perfection. ..it was good
Fried wantons were also good
Veg fried rice were enough for two and the flavour of the rice was also good...
Manchurian was also good...
  Pocket pinch is good..
We were satisfied by Mirch masalas food..

They have 2 section Indian and chinese. When you compare the ambience Indian one scores high. As the name * Mirch Masala* , the food are too spicy. People who loves spicy food they will find it yummy and who prefers less spicy food will find it difficult to finish the food. Overall it is good! Price is also reasonable.

I love the decor and the ambience of this place.Growing up, I frequented this place so much. It has a yellow taxi coming out of one it's walls. The plates they serve food in are all metal and they use little buckets to serve daals and gravies.Food is delicious. I love their biriyani. they have a special menu during the pujas also.

Have been to this place too many times and have probably tried everything good on their menu. Situated right behind Gariahat Pantaloons, Mirch Masala has two sections- Indian and Chinese with liquor. From the Indian section, i love their Miley Juley Kebab n Tawa fish the most. They serve fresh and very tasty north indian food. Dum Biriyanis are great too. From the Chinese section, i love their Lung Fung soup,Crispy Pepper Chicken, Chilly Lamb, pan fried noodles, manchurian chicken,chilly chicken dry the most. Service is very prompt and behavior of staff very nice. One of my favourite stops in Gariahat.

Mirch masala as the name suggest it should be a north indian restaurant but they have one complete different chinese restaurant with same name. We went to this place and orders wild paneer as starter,Veg Manchurian and noodles for main course. all the food item was good. We were in a bit hurry so made the service pretty fast. It had a dimly lighted ambiance and price wise was also good.

Was very nicely made and different quotes added the attraction as fin get to see many places with such kind of decor in food industry. Over all food was also good and located next to Gariahat pantaloons in a lane beside. Now The service has gone down with no quality staff still the food is good.

Location-just beside pantaloons gariahat.

This place(north indian cuisine)has a two storey sitting area and serves two cuisine-North indian and chinese.Restaurant for both the cuisine are located side by side.It is basically known for its bollywood theme.This place generally remains crowded due to which the AMBIANCE at this place is like average.The SERVICE is also very slow but the FOOD they serve at this place is worth waiting.
We had-"Tirange paneer","mili juli kebab" for starter and for main course we went for-"Yellow dal tadka",paneer kadhai","patiala kofta" and atlast for drinks we had"**mirchi sharbat" and "ginger lemonade".

Must try among all of them are-:
1:mili juli kebab
2:paneer kadhai

Food-4.5/5
Service-3/5
Ambiance-4/5

**Never try their "mirchi sharbat" as its a spam because they serve in it only khus sherbaat with sodaüòÇüòÇ

A must visit...

Mirch Masala's Bollywood themed decor really stands out and the creates a vibrant ambiance. ¬†We ordered the lasooni nan, murg methi malai, Kali Dal and Kadai Gosht. I really liked their nan and dal, but ¬†the mugh methi malai was a disappointment. It was too sour and tasted stale, which I suspect it was. The kadai gosht was ordinary.

Located beside gariahat pantaloons

A dhaba themed decor with taxi and truck dummy models to add to the appeal

Indian cuisine available but Chinese is dere too but in a different enclosure

We ordered hyderabadi biryani, naan, some chicken and mutton gravies and a kebab platter

The food was a bit spicy and maybe too rich and too much of masala used

Nothing great in terms of taste

Service is slow

Getting a treat from my friend at mirch masala made my day.. We ordered -
macchi peshwari kabab - not only sounds good, taste was also good, and quality of vetki too.. Soft and fresh..

Butter Naan and Dal kali - Naan was thin and soft.. But dal kali (dal makhani) was average..

Hara moti pulao- which is known as peas pulao.. It was OKAYish...

Murg guldar- dish contains with very small pieces of chicken.. Tastes like kind of chicken bharta.. But it was really good..

Bhuna gosht- tastes awesome, well prepared mutton dish.. Really liked it..

Kesari jalebi- dessert must for a bangali, so ordered jalebi.. Must try their Hot crunchy jalebi.. Really delicious... 
Now come to the interior decor, totally a bangali ambiance with nice decoration of art..

I can't believe I missed reviewing this place. I have been coming to Mirch Masala for the past many years, because , well its at gariahat(close to my place) and they have alcohol at reasonable prices.

#Location: Gariahat, Beside Pantaloons Exit (not Entrance)

#Ambiance: This restaurant has been around for years. The quirky wall art gives the place a vibrant, eclectic appeal. And who doesn't stare at the half yellow taxi which adorns this weirdly dhaba styled eatery!! Everything about the interiors is loud, filmy, colorful. 

#Service: The staff are always attentive and smiling. They know their food.

#Food and Drinks:
Well for me, beer is a must at Mirch Masala and the bar section gives good chat(one thing that I miss in kolkata's modern pubs/bars). They are a multi cuisine restaurant serving both chinese and punjabi dishes; they are reasonably good at both.
A few of my favorites:
* Chicken Tandoori : well, who can have beer without tandoori. The meat is succulent, and well cooked. The sizes are reasonable.
*Chicken Reshni Kabab: This happens to be one of my favorite kababs, and Mirch Masala makes them fantastically.
*Murgh Makhani: A chicken main-course - spicy (just the way i like it).
*Chicken Drumstick: I love their drum sticks, its worth a try.
*Dry Chili Chicken: yummy and the portion is good, the pieces of chicken are reasonable.

My suggestion is that order run-of-the-mill courses here, and it will never let you down!

Brilliant experience!
The place provides an impeccable amount of cosy and comfortable environment, suitable for indulging in some delectable food.
My friends and I were seated in the Chinese section of the restaurant and somehow managed to stick to our chairs for four long hours.
We ordered Chilly Chicken, Club Chicken (Thrice!), Prawns in Oyster Sauce, Chicken Clear Soup, Chicken Wanton Soup, Fish Fingers, Chicken in Garlic Sauce, Mixed Schezwan Rice and Roast Chilly Lamb.
The staffs were truly hospitable and friendly.
Food came out of the kitchen in an average speed.
All I may add is that they should really keep a check on the salt content in their food before sending it out. Each dish were too salty till we had to mention about correcting it.

People here are very cooperative and friendly. Whether you are with family or friends you can feel relaxed here.
Must try : Tawa Fish, Lasuni Murg, Mili Juli Kebab, Peswari Tikka. You can also try out the Kadai Murg and Kadai Gosht here..... But I would suggest don't try the chinese dishes here......... Try out their specialities........

Went there yesterday with my college buddies for the second time. situated on the lane besides Pantaloons gariahat this is a Bollywood themed restaurant cum bar. the furnishing represent that of a roadside dhaba which is a bit offbeat and stands out in comparison with the same old by the book restaurant decor.the lighting is nearly dim which suits perfectly with the warm cozy ambience n decor. The food is absolutely amazing. We ordered a range of starters which include tawa fish, malai chicken kebab, chicken tikka ,Peshawari machchi along with hard drinks. The service is prompt and extremely friendly hosting. My favorite part the kansar thala bason. The delicious food as well as the full bar access makes it perfect for both fine dining & relaxed hangout place.

Located near P.C. Chandra Jewellers, Gariahat.

The decor is great, Bollywood style mein bole toh ekdum Jhakkas ! This is some thing hatke in this place. However since it's mostly crowded and due to less space, the ambience is a bit on the downside. Seating arrangements could have been made comfortable.

Food items were okay.

Services are really slow. Staffs were very reluctant. Must keep an eye on this. 

Overall, may give a try to witness the Bollywood Dhamaka out here, but if you are really hungry, be there next time. :D

We ordered Chicken Hakka Noodles, Chicken Fried Rice, Chilli Chicken, and Golden Fried prawn, quantity and quality of food was really good, each dish was good in taste but the service was bit slow. Ambience of this restaurant is really awesome full bollywood theme.

One thing that's absolutely mentionable is the ambience of the place. Eight of us went to the Indian-food section and we were absolutely blown by the Retro-Bollywood theme. Add to that friendly and courteous staff, fast service and low pocket pinch, and you get Mirch Masala!
We ordered butter naans, Murgh Lasuni and Rajasthani HaraBhara Murgh- two each, and two Murgh Hyderabadi Biriyani; along with salads and raita. The chicken preparations were good and the Hyderabadi Biriyani actually tasted like it should. The naans were soft, without being too buttery and the raita was so delicious!
The staff helped us with our choices and the service was prompt. And the whole package cost a mere 2k for 8 people. A must visit for everyone who enjoys smashing Indian food!

They serve both Chinese & Indian. Although they r good at Indian only. The north Indian food they cook is realy good, a bit oily but tasty. Rara Gosh was sumptuous so as paneer lababdar. In sweets, kesariya jalebi was so fresh & juicy.

Their service is a bit slow. The prices are affordable.

The walls are decorated with rural pictures and those of Bollywood. The interior and the decorations are too good and make you feel exactly as if you're in a highway dhaba. Food is pretty good. If you're fond of North Indian cuisine, it's a must try!! üëçüëç

Mirch Masala: A place to relish
INTRO + AMBIENCE
Mirch Masala is one of the best restaurant is Gariahat area. It has maintained its quality of food from its inception. Not only the food but its also the unique decor which will really attract you to this place again and again. The decor is just too good. The theme of the interior is a village dhaba and they did justice to their theme. The tree inside, the retro bollywood posters, the walls, the big car inside the restaurant gives an interesting feel. They have also a red Pathani Kurta for their staffs which suites perfectly. The plates and glasses which they give are of bell metals and not glass or ceramic, making it much more realistic. To be precise, the decor is fabulous. 

LOCATION
This place is located in Gariahat. Its just behind the Pantaloons outlet of Gariahat. Not a difficult place to find. The lane of Park Plaza is another hint to reach this place.

SERVICE
The service is up to the mark. The staffs are really polite and do their job perfectly. They know about every dishes when asked. The suggestions which they give to choose the dishes are helpful. The ordered food comes quite fast and you don't have to wait much.

FOOD
The food here is of great quality and I have enjoyed all the items whenever I have visited this place. The quantity too is perfectly alright. I prefer the Indian food in Mirch Masala ignoring the Chinese one as I found this better.

Food to order (My favourites)
#Chicken Tandoor : One of the best I have ever had in town. Its spicy, its hot, its good.
#Chicken Reshmi Kebab: Just wow, the pieces are large, juicy and taste worth its price.
#Murgh Dum Biriyani: Its different, its good.
Try it out to find the rest.
#Murgh Tikka Lababdar: They make it really well. The mixing of sweet and tanginess is just perfect here making you love the dish and crave for it. The chicken pieces need a mention too.

Last Words:
One of my favourite places to have Indian dishes. You will love the food and enjoy the ambience. And its worth the price you are paying for your dishes.

4/5 is what they deserve.

Been there quite a few times. They started a chinese section sometime back. Their food is just too good. Some of my favourites from the Indian side - Chana masala, Kadhai Chicken.
Chinese side - Garlic chicken, mirch masala special hakka noodles.
Though I didn't like their mushroom masala (they have a different name for it) which was too spicy and a mutton dish the name of which I don't remember, the meat was chewy and less on flavors.
Pocket pinch - INR 1000 for two inclusive of taxes.

The loveliest thing about this place would be the decor. The theme is superb. The seating arrangement is spacious. The restaurant is spread across a huge space. they have a separate Chinese wing as well.I have not had the chance to try out every item in their menu. But what is good is really good here. I have never had a bad experience. Parking is a headache but with time hopefully that will improve as well!

I have already been to their Chinese section before, so this time opted for the Indian cuisine. The temperature being high, we didn't go for heavy dishes like rice or biriyani... Instead we ordered chicken tandoori, butter nun and bhuna gosht... The food took some time to arrive probably because of the huge rush ... But the food was absolutely delicious and extraordinary... Particularly the chicken tandoori which was extremely tender and was perfectly cooked and spiced... 
Nice work... Would love to come back to have their biriyani :D

The loveliest thing about this place would be the decor. The theme is superb. The seating arrangement is spacious. The restaurant is spread across a huge space. they have a separate Chinese wing as well.I have not had the chance to try out every item in their menu. But what is good is really good here. I have never had a bad experience. Parking is a headache but with time hopefully that will improve as well!

I have already been to their Chinese section before, so this time opted for the Indian cuisine. The temperature being high, we didn't go for heavy dishes like rice or biriyani... Instead we ordered chicken tandoori, butter nun and bhuna gosht... The food took some time to arrive probably because of the huge rush ... But the food was absolutely delicious and extraordinary... Particularly the chicken tandoori which was extremely tender and was perfectly cooked and spiced... 
Nice work... Would love to come back to have their biriyani :D

Visited this place so many times. Located beside gariahat pantaloons. Lovely ambiance, lil bit darkish. Quite spacious place. They have a  variety of cocktails and also they make one as per your demand. Service is good. Food quality is okayish. Price is comparatively low. Overall a nice restaurant.

Location: it's on the lane just adjacent to gariahat pantaloons.

Ambience: it's low lit place. It has a family section on the top floor and a non family section where heavy drinks are served with food is on the ground floor.

Interiors: great effort has been taken to bring out the look of an old times dhaba with a filmy theme. You would find a half taxi parked upstairs!

Food would be served in brass wares.

We ordered a lot of stuffs..

Roti ka tokri: it had all the assortment of rotis and kulchas.. Was delicious.

Milijhuli kebabs: it was a platter of all the kebabs and it was delicious.

Kebab noorani: it was good. Not that joicy.

Murg mirch masala pulao: this was pulao with sweet and spicy flavour and mixed with boneless chicken pieces. It was delicious.

Murg Dam biryani: this was simple biryani. It tasted good.

Rajasthani haryali chicken: methi flavour was the dominant taste. Green gravy. Not spicy.

Vodka with lime: the sweet lime was served in a different glass. You got to mix it with the vodka and add your own spices to make it grand.


Overall, the setting and ambience was good. The food was averagely good. Some items were really great and some were okay.

One of the best themed restaurants in Kolkata.   Based on somewhat 90's bollywood theme it serves a very good quality of food that you just cant resist. The staffs are so helpful. We told them to bring something good in paneer and potatoes of their choice. And to my surprise the dishes that they brought was so amazing. Totally worth the surprise and money. It is one of the best restaurants that i have visited so far.

Mirch Masala Indian Section
I have never been cheated in a restaurant like this in my life! While we were paying the bill last night after a dinner both my friend and I saw that I was giving INR 1000 note, waiter took the bill and came back with balance that would be for INR 500 and not for INR 1000. When we asked him he said that we never paid INR 1000 but just 500 note! After much arguement with three staffs named: Nanapradip Raut, Jadav Modak and Rudrodeep ( who was known to me as I was a regular customer) We left the because we know that someone has pocketed INR 500 and they were not willing to admit that. ¬†But this is not the end of this daylight robbery, I will make them famous throughout! Wow Mirch Masala Indian section what a way of getting extra bucks!

This is one of those restaurants in Kolkata which spent a hefty on its decorations. This outlet is themed like a dhaba, and well, no doubt, the way they bought that look and feel is outstanding. So, full marks goes to the outlet decor at the very first sight of it.
Coming to the food, being on a family dine-out, there were 7 of us and hence order quite a variety of dishes to mix and match and enjoy ! The orders as I remember were Murgh Tandoori, Tandoori Roti, Butter Naan, Aloo Jeera Fry, Murgh Lababdar, Bhuna Ghost and two other dishes. All of them more or less tasted average, yet not bad. Coming to the pricing, the quantity of food they provide what I feel, is too less for their pricing. So the value for money is one of the biggest cons of the restaurant which made my rating shred down to 3.5. All in all, the decor definitely calls for atleast a single visit.

As the name suggests, mirch masala is a tadkedar and dhamakedar place. I somehow found the Bollywood theme a bit loud. Satisfactory ambience I would say. Staffs here are courteous. Food was good. They are specialized in Indian food so whatever they served was delicious and it can be your regular place to chill out with your friends for a bottle of beer and tandoori chicken.

A perfect example of a themed restaurant - Bollywood styled dhaba. Have been to this place numerous times and each time I love it equally. Its located in the alley adjacent to Gariahat Pantaloons. Mirch Masala has a chinese branch right next to this one, but its no comparison to this one. So don't get confused and walk into the chinese one. The staff is friendly and the food is quite reasonably priced. Must-try : Tawa Fish.

With a very hospitable environment and mouth watering foods, this place is indeed special.

Located just at the back of the pantaloons gariahat this restaurant  is a perfect example of a theme restaurant. A lot of people avoid visiting  a bar cum restaurant (except the higher end  restaurants) with family but I dint get any shabby feel from this restaurant, it is a pure family restaurant. We ordered sikanderi alu, Kali dal, tandoori roti, mirchi sherbat and overall the quality of food was decent especially the sikanderi tandori alu I found that really tasty. If anything negative I have to point out then first would be the spread of menu is less and the lights at some places are too dim, otherwise it is a must visit place ( if not anything but definitely for the decor and theme).

Been here quite a no. of times with friends and family. The place has a unique ambience and resembles a Punjabi dhaba. The waiters are extremely courteous and suggest food and drinks which turn out to be really good. The best part is the kebab. The machhli ajwain tikka, murgh mumtaz, 
fish peshwari tikka are the best. The cheese naan tastes really yummy. In the sidedish, murgh guldar is great. The biriyani is not mughlai style and I didn't find it great. Among the desserts kesar jalebi is a must try and Pink Lady is a phenomenal drink here. I would definitely recommend this place to people who love to eat.

The place instantly impresses you with the desi village-like theme : the trees,the plates,glasses,chairs,Bollywood posters,a taxi somewhere,etc.

The food is quite good.
Special mention to the Gosht biryani which is so light and tasty,very different from our regular biryani. Must try.
We also ordered a kebab platter. Most of the kebabs were okay,some were good.
The mushroom starter was a bit too spicy. Babycorn tasted good.
The Mirchi Sharbaat at the beginning is a drink you should not miss.
The jalebis are crispy and delicious.

Great place for family dinners or a wholesome lunch with a group of friends.

There are 2 segments of the restaurant - one is indian and another is chinese. We have visited the chinese section. Both the  decorations of the place and behavior of their staffs are very good. There is no mandatory starters to be ordered with the drinks which is a good part too. Apart from the drink, we have ordered Chicken Shanghai Noodles and Red Wine Chicken.. both tastes satisfactory( not so good because they are sweet a bit extra) but quantity is low. Now come to the last part.. pocket pinch... as per opinion it is high compared to the quantity they're serving. So i think its worth trying and I'm also looking forward for its Indian segment.üëç

My favourite hangout place in kolkata. Can't count how many times i went there.last time i went there with my parents. It's easy to locate, the left lane beside of gariahaat pantaloons. They have 2 different resto. one is for the indian one another chainese. I review is about the indian one.
After entering this restro u will find a dhaba type enviornment. u will see a half hanging old taxi, old banyan typetree.. and lots of flimy posters. they serve food in brass utensils. in one word.. u will find a mini dhaba in the heart of the city.

there food is also good like their ambience.
service was prompt  and waiters are very well mannered. 

last time we ordered, mile jhule kebab, methi malai corn, butter nun.. kashmiri kulcha, gosht bhuna and jalebi. all the prep was good. fish and chicken was fresh and juicy. jalebi was hot.
Mirch masala is a must visit place for food lovers.

A favourite place of mine for a weekend hangout. The ambience is excellent...like a roadside Dhaba.... bollywood posters adorning the walls, a taxi named 'Manjeet Ki Gaddi', a tree.....all the makings of a dhaba on the highway. The staff are pretty welcoming although they are a bit slow with their service and sometimes they get confused when it gets crowded. But yes, they are always patient with their customers....that's a big, big positive.
The food is pretty good....my favourites here being Mile Jule Kabab, Dum Biryani, Lahori kebab and Achari Murgh Have visited the Chinese section on a few occasions...personally found the service in that section a bit more prompt. The food is also of a pretty good standard.
This place will always be on my list when I need to hang out with friends. Get an amazing sense of comfort whenever we are here.

Went in this resturant today afternoon. The the theme decor of the restoration is nice aand ambience cozy. At first we placed ourselves at first floor but staffs said that the first floor will be closed @ 3pm. So,we came down in front of the bar. 
Our order was Lahore kebab,guldar mug,butter nun,Dum Biryani and pink lady drink. 
After almost half an hour Lahore kebab set in. I didn't find any uniqueness in that kebab. Its like the malai kebab of Nizam's. And another thing which made us tensed was the quantity of the plate.VERY LESS. After finishing the plate it seemed that we need another plate of it. Dum Biryani and guldar murg saved us. The Biryani came in a 'little' handi The guldar mug is a regular chicken taste. While Dum Biryani has some taste to evoke.
We didn't feel for any dessert here. The restaurant doesn't have dishes which are value for money.

If you are looking for north Indian dishes in Kolkata, Mirch Masala must be there in your list. I have not tried the Chinese section, so won't comment. The restaurant is well decorated having a bollywood dhaba theme. Staffs are courteous. The kebabs are great. The place is very much pocket friendly, compared to its contemporaries. Alcohol is available, located at a prime location of the city, manages to draw a very decent crowd. I wish they could provide a few more options in the desserts section.

I really like the ambience of this place. With a North Indian dhaba style decor with a touch of Bollywood makes it very refreshing. Do have the Milejule Kabab platter as starter. Their rotis are really good and one of my favorite dish is the Achaari Chicken. There are not many options for desserts. Service is quite good. In a nutshell a one of a kind restaurant with good North Indian cuisine. By the way, their biriyani is very different from the one normally available in Kolkata but it comes in a small handi.

I wanted a go to a cheap but classy restaurant at south Kolkata that serves alcohol. After a bit of research I settle on Mirch Masala. 
On entering I was half satisfied with my decision. The interior is very unique and gives a rustic dhaba look to the restaurant. The half taxi and the wall painting was superbly done. Giving an extra charm to the dining. 
The crockery sets also gives an extra edge to the restaurant. Brass metal plates and cutlery works perfectly with the rustic look. 
Coming to the food, we were two and ordered 2 bottle of tuborg ,2 peg of whiskey, Chicken kabab, tandoori roti, Chicken masala. 
The food was very satisfying. Quantity was quite good. The kababs were soft and very well cooked. Chicken masala was also done with perfection . However the tandoori roti was bit tough and not like the one we get in specialised mughlai restaurants like Shiraz 
The place deserve second visit .

This place has a nostalgic value because this used to be our (my family's) go-to restaurant for years. At that point, the food scene in Kolkata wasn't that well developed and there was just "Park Street" or Mirch Masala for us.

But as I write this review today, this place comes out just above average in it's category. My latest visit consisted of a Chicken Tikka Mumtaz which was definitely soft and tasty. And my friend ordered a Smirnoff Masala Cola which was pretty awesome (yes, I do steal a taste from friends' drinks) !

If you like a themed restaurant with better than decent food which doesn't cost a bomb, this is definitely worth a try.

This restaurant is located in the lane just beside the Pantaloons in Gariahat. I would rate this place 5 for several reasons, awesome ambiance, awesome service, and awesome food.

For me this place turned out to be a hidden gem as i never knew about this place earlier. It looks very ordinary from the outside but the ambiance is really commendable. During the dining, you may not even feel like you're in Kolkata. You feel like you've stopped to have delicious food on a highway dhaba.!

I visited the place on 26/01/2016 for lunch and had their 'Adrak Nimbu Soda' and 'Masala Chass' and both were really very tasty. For food, we had 'Makai Tamatar Bharta' which was actually tasty and tried two of their naans, the 'hara lasooni naan' which was something different and the 'Mirch Masala Naan' which is the real deal.

I loved to place and the food so much that i had to visit the place again in the same week to celebrate a friend's birthday.

I would strongly recommend everyone to try their 'Adrak Nimbu Soda', and also their 'Mirch Masala Naan' which has turned out to be my personal favourite at Mirch Masala.

The pocket pinch is also not very high.!

Mirch Masala is a pretty good restaurant in the
 Gariahat area.Had gone there once¬†with friends.We ordered 
chicken schezwan rice,garlic chicken,veg fried rice and sundae ice 
creams and all of them were yummy! But the mushroom with oyster 
sauce(don't remember the exact name) was disastrous..
Ambience is nice and also is the service.Prices are also very reasonable.Overall had a fine experience and would like to try 
out the Indian food there.

Mirch Masala has been around since my school days right next to my school, when getting special pocket money would mean having a very shared meal with friends here. Over years, the decor has roughly been the same, with the dhaba decor and servers in pathan kurtas. The Indian food spread it serves has been better than average, and on good days, really good.

Priced slightly on the higher side, this is a safe place for a family dinner.

During my last visit, I had a wonderful Smirnoff masala cola, something I recommend if you like desi cocktails.

Tired of having Chinese cuisine, decided to try north indian.  As suggested by a friend i checked in with a group of friends. 
There are two separate restaurants,  one for north indian,  anathor serves chinese.  
We stepped into the north indian one.  Waiters were decent and polite.  Quality of food was very good.  We took mirch masala special polao and for side dishes,  there were different preparations of chicken. 
Each plate serves 2 with normal apetite. 
For those who love north indian,  this place is a must visit.

I have been coming here for ten years now for most of my family celebrations.
Good food good ambiance!
Very good staff!!
Love the kebabs and the daal tadka!

In starters we ordered Shikari Murg and Boti kebabs. Boti kebab won my heart!
In main course we asked for butter naan crispy (option was crispy/non-crispy and who doesn't like crispy right?!), Handi Paneer, Rajasthani Hara Murg (delicious!! Give it a try guys! ), Daal Tadka, Daal Makhani, Vegetable Fried Rice.
Over all the only complaint we had was the quantity otherwise the food was really good!

One of my most Favourite Restaurants. The awesome ambience of this Themed Restaurant gives me the feeling of a Roadside Dhaba in North India, and the Food matches with the same flavour. Have visited this Restaurant a number of times, for Weekend Family Treats, Get Together with Friends and Celebrating Birthday Parties. The Shikari Murgh is a starter I never miss, along with the Kadhai Chicken, Gosht Lababdar and my wife's favourite Kali Dal. Though I prefer Butter Naans, cause it goes well with the drinks, but the Gosht Hyderabadi Biriyani is a must have for my Wife and Sister. The Kesariya Jalebi is the most unique desert item, you won't find anywhere else. The hospitality of the waiters is as good as the ambience and food.

First of all HNY2016 to everyone.. Went to this place to start the year with some delicious food. I have visited this place many times before, from my school days but never tried their Chinese section. Ambience & decor wise this section is nothing great compared to the Indian one, as you know Mirch masala is one of the best themed restaurant in Kolkata. But the food was really tasty to my surprise. We ordered:
Chicken Thai Soup- really spicy, it will kick you in the throat.
Fish Finger(4pcs)- the fingers were really good, it was crispy fried and the fish was also very fresh and soft inside.
Chicken Wonton(6pcs)- V.good, it was served with a sweet and chilli sauce.
Mixed meifoon- we are becoming a fan of meifoon day by day, it was no diff here. Very fine, with loads of prawns in it. My partner

We fixed on this place for a lunch after surfing through Zomato and I can't say that we weren't pleased.
We had the Chinese cuisine. As soon as you enter the place, you are greeted by the very distinct Chinese theme and all the paintings on the wall make sure you have a charming experience.
Being one of my favourite cuisines however, the place built up the expectations a lot and although the food was good, it fell short of expectation.
So we were a group of six and we ordered a whole lot of dishes! We had the Lemon Coriander soup, the Hundai baby corn and the Crispy Honey chicken for the starters. The soup was great and it really builds your appetite for the Main course. For the main course we had the Veg Manchurian, noodles, fried rice, Red Wine chicken and Dry chilli chicken. Shockingly, the best taste came from the most common of these..the dry chilli chicken. They could really improve the dish veg munchurian.
All in all, it was a great experience if you are looking for a big lunch with your gang at pocket friendly price. And then you have beer! That goes straight up in the PROS list. :D

Was too tired after shopping in Gariahat, so headed up for this nearbuy place. Located ina small lane near Pantaloons, this place houses both cuisines of North Indian & Chinese delicacies.
Ambience: Slightly dim yet subtle lighting, clean interiors, nice and comfortable seating arrangements,but the ground floor ceiling height is pretty low which can cause some inconvenience for tall people.. Helpful staff around to help you with anything you require.
Food: We ordered Beijing chicken, which was a Hit :D properly cooked in some secret sauce, the portion size, plating, taste everything was just perffffect!! A great start to us hungry souls next ordering the Hot Garlic chicken & Mixed Fried Rice. Though I am not much of a rice lover, but here the case was different. The fried rice was actually too good for me have a change in opinion :) Not soggy, or too dry, just plain, simple and a winning main course. 

Well, the Hot Garlic chicken, was lil strange. It looked like Alur Dom more than Chicken. Better Alur Dom in a huge gravy!! The presentation & plating was a mess.
But the taste made up for it. The gravy was beautifully done, but the chicken pieces could have been cooked a lil more. But still, this baby passes well. Benefit of doubt given. 

We got too full for any deserts, so just had a coke each, but yes, this place is definitely worth coming back for :D

VFM: 3/5
QUALITY & QUANTITY: 4/5

You should consider yourself  lucky if you a get a seat immediately, in the eve, as you enter, specifically if you are moving in a gang!

Considering the name of the eatery, It would be foolish to think that food here would not be spicy üôÑ, however I found the spice in most of the preparations on higher note...

Booze is moderately priced - (can't help about the taxes) !!!

Bar tender is awesome in terms of his manners & cooperation.

Stewards are equally well behaved & patient in hearing & really speedy in service.

Location - near to pantaloons ( gariahat) 
Ambience - It was okay, actually i was little uncomfortable because i was with my girlfriend, and this place is meant to have some hangout types of place like partying and all...
Food - we just ordered Mix fried rice & chilli chicken. Taste and quantity was ok but as i said earlier it's not comfortable  to sit with my gf, where lot of guys are drinking and many of them all ready drunk..

Yesterday we decided to come here for lunch after   I came to know from my mother that she had really liked this place.I presume they also have a second floor but we were seated on the ground floor.Anyway coming to the food.Firstly let me mention that the staff were really very courteous and very helpful when it came to suggestions.We ordered the pepper garlic fish for starters.It did not take long for that to arrive.The fish was perfectly cooked with a very thin coating on the outside and with a slight heat coming from the chillies.For the main course we decided to go with chicken fried rice.And the waiter suggested both the side dishes which were excellent.First of all we had the Youm Bang Chicken.--the best thing about which was the chicken wasn't coated in anything.simply sliced.-and the sauce in which it was cooked was great--not too sweet not too hot.-spot on.But the best dish of that day had to be the Singapore Chilli Prawns.Absolutely fantastic. Tiger prawns cooked in a spicy sauce  that had a hint of ginger that gave it that extra kick.That had to be the best dish.And the prawns were cooked to perfection.Not over cooked like most other places.So a fantastic meal and polite and efficient staff was enough to convince me to come back here a second time.Had a wonderful experience.

The restaurant is located at a very convenient location and also easily accessible. The restaurant has two separate sections - Chinese and Indian. The food served was delicious and the service provided was quite commendable. The quantity was apt and price isn't much. It's pocket friendly. The drinks on the menu isn't also so high priced. It's a place one would want to revisit. Though the place seems to be a little low on space but they have managed to carve out seating spaces properly. It's a place one should visit.

This place is tucked away in a small lane just after Gariahat Pantaloons. The ambience is attempted to resemble that of a highway side dhaba with film posters, tyres and other artifacts. The lighting is dimmer than most would probably fancy but interiors are meticulously clean starting from utensils (copper/brass) to even the rest-rooms which is a pleasant surprise. 
Food is predominantly north Indian and is delicious. We had Pudina Parantha which was crisp and fluffy, butter and garlic naan all hot crisp and tasty. Along with we had kaali daal(daal makhni) which was OK and lasooni chicken which again was delicious. Topped off with diet Coke and dessert the tab came to some where around ‚Çπ915. We didn't have alcohol, but that was also decently priced. Good place for tasty Punjabi food.

We had drinks and starters like chilli mushroom which was really great. The quantity of the food is very poor. A bowl of chicken fried rice is not even enough for an individual. The ambience is quite good, little chilly inside.
The best thing about this place is its location.

Went there on a friends birthday treat.. Walked in already happy that I don't have to spend any thing.. But as we entered I just loved the ambience.. The whole Bollywood theme was just awesome.. In the basement the bar was situated and the restaurant was situated up stairs.. Loved the peeli taxi and the fake baniyan tree.. Loved the whole feel. OK coming to the food we ordered roti ki tokri which is basically assorted rotis of different kinds .. Then there was lasuni chicken and kadhai mutton both were equally tasty but nothing extra ordinary..as we had some veggies with us also got to try daal served in a bucket and paneer butter masala which was also good.. I didn't like the biriyani at all it had a minty and s taste in it.. May be it was authentic but it definitely was not how a calcuttan loves her biriyani.biriyani not recommended..overall Food was good service was slow, the waiter was helpful though. Portions were medium and price on the higher side..

We had Butter Naan and Chicken Korma. The food quality is excellent and the waiters are quite friendly. The hygiene of the restaurant is also kept above standards. The plus point of this restaurant is, it is pocket friendly. Quite happy to have a good first experience in this restaurant. Will surely dine in again.

This place is always a delight to be here. The bolly dhaba themed restaurant is my favorite ever since I first visited after my 10th board results. This review took sometime, was here as recent as saptami during pujas. They have a condensed menu during pujas but it surely didn't disappoint considering how many people they serve, it's best suited to their puja rush. We tried the Tawa fish, Masala Chach and Sweet lime soda as starter and Hara Lasuni naan and Chicken Kadhai. Everything was lip smacking. Servers are amiable and have known them for years now. Service is prompt. My must visit place for kebabs and delectable tandoori items.

Rest...service and food was also great...nothing standout...or I that would remember it for long..overall decent hai...worth visiting once.

Went here on panchami and was completely disappointed.
Location- beside the lane in gariahat pantaloons. Quite easy to locate.
Ambience- very good. Softly lit place, had beautiful Chinese lanterns hanging from the ceiling. It also had false ceiling. Though the chairs were not very comfortable.
Food- well this restaurant fails to impress in this part. Due to puja rush they had one page special menu. We ordered a crispy chilli baby corn, chicken hakka chow, chicken fried rice and Manchurian chicken for the four of us. The food were completely spiceless. It appeared as if the noodles and rice were boiled along with the chicken and given to us. Baby corn was good though. Chicken was ok. Though the quantity of all the items were very less. 2 of my friend also ordered an orange breezer and a large b.p.
Price- we paid near about Rs.2000 for our order.
I may visit this place again as this place has good reviews but definitely not during the pujas.

I went to mirch masala on panchami 2015. The food was horrible ! Quantity was pathetic ! I mean if I'm going to a restaurant named "mirch masala" I wouldn't expect my food to be completely spice less and bland ! Even a hospital I think serves more better food. I ordered fried rice which was completely tasteless!  chicken manchurian was so-so ! Very very pathetic quantity as well as quality !

First things first - i really liked the ambience of this place. All the dishes were delicious especially the chicken and prawn starters. The only dish that i didn't like is the Kulcha - they stuffed only potatoes inside it - that was actually not the way with which it should have been prepared. But barring this one thing, service was great...  This is definitely one of the few places, which i would recommend to many friends of mine. 2 thumbs up.

For the theme, the place tries bringing the Bollywood feel, but it doesnt succeed totally!
There are a lot of famous aspects of the movie industry which they could have incorporated. The quotes are a bit sexist and it disturbed me a bit.

Now, for the pro. The food was good!
We ordered chicken malai kabab, chicken tikka kabab and chicken hariali kabab. The hariali could have been better.
The masala kulcha was tasty but the rasoni naan was bad!!
The chicken reshmi butter masala was delicious!!

The service was prompt and the waiters were very polite :)

Heard a lot about this place but was really disappointed. The ambience is nice but the food was not that great. Me and my friends had gravy chicken noodles and it had no flavour. It was just bland. I did not even know what i was eating. This time i wanted to try fish so we ordered fish in oyster sauce. It tasted like i fish manchurian dish. All in all heard such nice things about thelace but was really disappointed with it.

We had ordered hyderabadi biriyani..it was like¬† mansho bhat of our home but it was different and enjoyed by all.Millijuli kebab was average.Mainly people go for this place because of the ambiance but there should be light enough so that people can feel it and see it properly.The mocktails were below average .But heart is where were friends are so over all it was an average experience.

Had both the Indian and Chinese variety at their place. I personally prefer their Chinese cuisine though Mirch Masala is more known for its North Indian cuisine.
The Chinese and North Indian restaurants are like two different places located next to each other with separate entrances. Ambiance is good at both their places with the North Indian restaurant themed at a desi style.
About the food quality, I found the North Indian cuisine too oily and spicy, and rather on the expensive side. Where as their Chinese cuisine was pretty good and decently priced with good quantity.
Parking is a huge problem in that area. Even though my hostel was near this place we hardly visited the restaurant because of its high prices. I would prefer to visit their Chinese restaurant

Decorate the restaurent, amazing... Movie posters and one liners.

Now something where we expect them to improve....slow service, may be restaurant was fully sold out... Food came more than 30 minutes after we ordered.

I was in Mirch Masala on last sunday with my college friends. It was my surprise birthday party.I just love their ambience. The north indian part of this is decorated brilliantly.They have decorated it with the theme of Bollywood stars and environment of the dhabas,it will attract you immediately. 
Now come to the food.Food was also appealing. In starters we ordered Tandoori murgh,it's was delicious and divine. In complimentary drink we ordered lime soda,it was also nice.In main course we tried Murgh Lasuni and Murgh mirch masala pulao with butter nan.All dishes was excellent in taste.
Over all,it's a wonderful experience.

Mirch Masala is in the lane next to Gariahat pantaloons and has been there for the last 15 years serving great Punjabi cuisine. I have been there innumerable times but this is a current review of the dinner we had last night. After decibel sundowner party in ParkPlaza we went for dinner in Mirch Masala. The ambience wait staff everything was great and transported us to rural Punjab. Though packed we managed a table for 2. We ordered Gosht Dum Biriyani, Murgh Lasuni, Naan and few drinks. The food was exceptional, just lip smacking and good portions. We just love it. And at the end we couldn‚Äôt believe our eyes the bill was under 1000 bucks. So its tremendously pocket friendly with excellent food and service.
Highly recommended for all foodies.

Located behind Pantaloons, Gariahat, Mirch Masala is a restaurant which has a decor of its own. The most notable feature of Mirch Masala is their quirky Bollywood One-Liners with a Roadside Dhaba type ambiance. The staffs are courteous and polite.

I like their Gosht Dum Biryani which is amazingly tasty especially the meat. Its soft, juicy and delicious. Also, I like their Blue Hawaiin Mocktail.¬†

However, I just felt that they can increase the quantity of Biryani a leetle bit.

The food was okay.My main problem is with this odd concept.This restaurent is featured under multicuisine yet still serves only Chinese in the chinese section and only Indian in the indian section.NO LOGIC.
Restaurents like Bar-Be-Que allow free orders of chinese and indian in both sections of the restaurent.
Repeated calls to ask for information before I went to the restaurent remained unanswered.
Not a very good experience.
Coming to the food.
Food was good.Ordered Chilli pepper chicken and crispy honey chicken as starters.
Went for the usual Chicken Hakka chowmein and Chicken Fried rice which were good.Ordered Red wine Chicken.was okay.
Overall was highly disappointed at the restaurent concept and at not being allowed to order Indian dishes.

Visited tonight for dinner with friends.  Once we entered there was a waiting of 30mins. The ambience was filmy at the entrance. However the sitting arrangements are too clumsy. I was feeling claustrophobic. After getting a seat, we ordered the kebab platter,  Chicken Lababdar,  Handi Gosht,  Chicken Lasuni,  Bhuna Gosht,  Mutton dum biriyani. The kebabs are really succulent and juicy. However none of the main course impressed me. Price is affordable. Staffs are good in terms of behaviour but extremely slow. It took them more 15mins just to repeat coke. Would recommend to try the starters which is really yummy but rest of it is on your own risk.

The ambience and the service is really good. I order American Chopsuey every time i be there and no doubt one of the best Chopsuey in the town!!!
Even the fried rice, noodles and any Chinese cuisine of chicken  is really good and quite affordable.

Theme restaurant oh it literally took every letter of the word ... Right from the time you enter it seems as if you had stepped into a Punjabi house .... The wall decors and all are superbly made to give it a roadside dhaba ambiance .... Now the servers were also dressed as Punjabi dhabawalas ... Food was to be served in brass plates and glasses .. We ordered masala kulcha handi kabab and a shredded chicken dish for starters tandoori chicken actually we friends wanted to keep it as roadside as possible .... Overall a nice place 0.5 rating I take for a long wait of 20mins

Dropped in on a Saturday evening... When it was raining outside... Went to their Chinese restaurant...
The ambience was alright...
Coming to drinks, we ordered beer and teacher's... The service was prompt..
For starters, we ordered their cube chicken which was a medium spicy dish with loads of onions and capsicum... Had a tangy flavor
Next we ordered chicken wantons... Which was quite bland... I wish it had more seasoning... Just tasted like boiled chicken...
Overall a nice place to drop by if you want to booze in that area

Visited this place a few days ago with family. Had an overall decent experience. The ambience and decor is unique particularly the half taxi. As far as food is concerned we had ordered tandoori murgh which was decent served with mint chutney. Kadhai mutton which was okay to taste was cooked well Nd was tender. Butter nan was also decent. Review only for the food would draw a 3. 0.5 extra for the decor.

The AC was deliberately kept at a very high setting which caused us to feel very uncomfortable.

This restaurant is located right in the lane besides Pantaloons in Gariahat.. Firstly, the food tastes fabulous here and most of the items are delectable and overtly delicious. However, the entrance to the restaurant has a shabby and gloomy feel and the ceiling height is pretty low which can cause some inconvenience for tall people. Seats are also not that comfortable but the saving grace is the food quality which more than makes up for all the other shortcomings.Overall a decent place with great food!

bollywood themed? ummm...not in the chinese section! We were a group of 9-10 people. though i hold no grudge i liked the sober and lightly dimmed ambiance. we ordered chicken fried rice, chicken noodles, manchurian chickn( which was great by the way), garlic chicken and one more chicken side dish which i fail to recollect. The quantity of the side dishes were enogh but the main course were less. I wont say very less but less compared to other places. If you are too hungry never settle to share from one bowl. The price was reasonable and the location was easy to find. Not a must visit restaurant but good for occasional visit.

Went there with my family. It is a nice place. The Bollywood theme in there makes this place more beautiful. I liked the way the dialogues are written on the walls. It is a quite amazing place to go out on a dinner with friends or with family. The place is dim lighted. The food is good too. We ordered roti ki tokri which included 7 or 8 types of different rotis. The paneer tikka was also good. It is not too heavy nor too light on pocket. I would definitely like to go there again sometime.

Went there with my colleagues for a team dinner.. Hv been there quite a few times. The interior is really different with a roadside dhaba look. Funny Bollywood dialogues and themes. The staff is courteous and food decent. It's little spicy and  for people who prefers non spicy food, it's advisable to enquire before placing your order. It's little low on space tho. Price is reasonable. A visit won't be regretted.

An Awesome theme restaurant ¬†for great food and good alcohol at decent prices. Its ambiance is a catchy thing. ¬†Good seating arrangements in a road side punjabi dhaba with a desi touch and the dim lighting is just perfect without making it sidey or shabby looking. Its classy and Indian. Good family place with a desi Tarka.¬†

Must have Non-veg keba plater and dal makhani.
And Chinese starters are a delight to any one who enjoys good liquor to compliment along.

So this place apparently happens to be the city's one of the first themed restaurants, or probably the first. And the theme but obviously is bolkywood. They have two outlets side by side serving Indian and chinese respectively and I've only ventured into the desi territory so far. 

Ambience is pretty much the USP of the place- be it the half cut body of a taxi whose headlamps blink intermittently or tyres with quirky slogans lying on a corner. The place actually gives a sense of nostalgia‚Äì the old school film poster style paint on the walls or the way the whole place is decked up like a rustic dhaba. It is almost charming. 

Food is pure Indian and it is pretty darn good, judging by the endless number of places there are in the city to offer indian this place really kicks the right spot. 
Be it the Dal makhani or the lasuni chicken or even the mixed veg, all were at par. Surprisingly good was the hyderabadi biryani‚Äì spicy and minty(not too overpowering), judt the way it ought to be. 

The waiters are polite and concerned about their diners' experience which, given the fact that its an old establishment, is rare to see. And hospitality matters in ways more than one.

Price wise the place is something in between, neither expensive nor cheap. 
Overall its worth your dime and time. That is only if you like Indian food and spicy.

When it comes to your dine out.. it has to be special....as always..

This one is quite an amazing restaurant,with a different theme....theme of Bollywood 

It has a bar counter at the ground floor which gives a similar view of those abroad.

We ordered 2 large pegs of chivas regal and for appetizer tangri kabab, tandoori chicken and tandoori paneer..
If ratings come
5* to tangri kabab....it was awesome 
3.5* to the tandoori chk...it was ok
4.5* to the paneer....

And what say...with chivas regal...all these were jst like the cherry on the cake.

Later on we had some ghosh biriyani..with chikken tikka masala....
Both were great to taste....


If u ever visit this restaurant...dont forget ordering the Tangri kababs..

Nestled near Gariahat pantaloons this place is one of the best themed resto bar I have been to..There is a yellow taxi inside the premises which occasionally flickers it head lamps..and then there is a tree which gives u a feel of dining in a forest lodge or something..coming to food ..mutton fish chicken they are all equally very good..but dishes in boneless fish takes the cake..food are a tad bit pricey. .The bar serves authentic drinks..The footfall is very high so consider going in around 7..The service for food booze and billing degrades from 8 30 pm due to high congestion..It would be best if one moves on to the only bar seating where u would get your drink within a minute..It was a very happy and mood setting experience..prepare to shell out 6 thousand for 4 persons ..All inclusive of 5 pegs per person üòÜüòÜüòéüòé

I have been here on my last birthday of my college life and seriously the one of the best birthday feast. The food is awesome by the way. No complaints about the staff they are wonderful. There are some things which found people unsatisfactory about any party but due to awesome decoration (specially all the paintings done on the walls), staff and offcourse food, all my friends told me that it was the best treat they had till then.. A must visit place for a foodie like me.

I was taken to this place for the first time by my brother and it has stayed a favourite place to hit when you want to eat good food without a hefty pocket pinch. My husband, brother and I all enjoy their Indian food more than their Chinese cuisine. The assorted kebabs known as mili jhuli kebabs are worth a try with your favourite drink. Follow it up with bhuna goshth and tandoori roti or naan. Don't miss the hot jalebis served with vanila ice cream. You may try their sarson saag makki roti specials in winter.

The ambience of this restaurant is simply mind blowing as it gives us the feeling of a street side dhaba..the chairs,table and the thali on which they serve food is just like as that of a street side dhaba..as u enter u would notice a taxi on the first floor of this restaurant..

Now coming to the main thing i.e the food..they have a unique spread of menu to choose from..to start with i and my friends decided to order tanduri murg full..and i must say it was simply out of the world..the chicken was tender,juicy and cooked to perfection..along with that we ordered murg tawa ke alongwith masala kulcha..and again murh tawa ke was the best thing i had..small chicken chunks beautifully spiced and very tasty and so was the massala kulcha made brilliantly..and lastly for the main course we had Murgh Mirch Masala polao and murg lasuni..murg lasuni was ok nothing great..but murg mirch masala polao is something different which u would not get in any other restaurant..the polao is very chatpata and i liked it the most..overall a very nice experience and the bill also was not heavy on our pockets..
overall very much satisfied with the ambience,the food and everything..

It's ambience is awesome. A whole feel of known bollywood movies n sets. Coming to food its too good. For starters baked baby corn platter is must. Chicken in white sauce is soo good. There kulchas n naans are amazingly tasty. U can also try Hyderabad e biryani. Fits ur pocket as well.
Their tandooris are delicious. Soft chicken n tender babycorns.
Would have rated this place 4.5 but last time we visited the tandoori roti served were papad. A better quality for rotis would be appreciated.

All famous filmstars are posted on the wall which fascinates one. Today i catched up on this place for dinner with my father and sister . Coming to the food we ordered Tawa fish (as it is my favourite one here and i order eat each time i come here ) as starter. for the main course we had masala kulcha, bhuna ghosht , dum ghosht biriyani and murgh masallam. The food is amazing here. Earlier i tried hyderabadi biriyani which is too good. They also has an open bar with few choices of cocktails . The mili jhuli kebab can be taken with drinks. :)

Good place for casual eat outs.The place is conviniently located beside pantaloons Garia haat and has a really nice decor and ambiance.  Their staffs are extremely friendly.  To start with we ordered chicken sweet corn soup and it was prepared really really well. In the main course we had hong kong rice chicken kebab. Although the rice was nice the chicken lacked tatse and quality,  in a way it tasted like rubber. In the dessert we had pan cake and that's what was a really a surprise package.  This place serves only Chinese food and one should visit it for casual purposes as they have really nice seating that allows you to spend a lot of quality time. Surprisingly there was no music either.  Overall it was a good experience but could have been so much better had the chicken been cooked well

Mirch masala as the name says...  Located at gariahat, precisely just after gariahat pantaloons.  It has two sections. One is chinese and the other one is indian.  Coming first to the chinese section- it is well decorated with a bar inside. Staffs are friendly but the price is bit high.  We tried chicken hakka noddles, garlic chicken and chicken 69 as a starter.  Food tastes good.  Drinks are also bit costly.  
Moving to the second part,  the indian section. - decorated with dim light,  chairs and tables gives you a dhaba look and a yellow taxi inside is just a addition to this dhaba styled restaurant.  Staffs are friendly, then again same thing..  Foods are served in authentic brass utensils. Foods and drinks are costly.  Some of the dishes you must try are - chicken achari,  tandoori,  kadhai paneer and a must try kesariya jalebi for desert.  Overall decent experience. :)

I have often visited this restaurant for their amazing north indian food.¬†

LOCATION: Gariahat, right adjacent to the Gariahat Pantaloons lane.

AMBIENCE: Pure delight this place. Cheeky posters, bolloywood liners, the famous Calcutta yellow taxi. The seats are comfortable

FOOD: I have in all my visits covered almost all items in the veg section! Worth mention are the kebab platters ( veg), palak kebab, dahi kebab, paneer tikka and all are melt in your mouths!¬†
For main course I love their dal makhni and achari aloo! The paneer i feel is decent though( could be bettered). Garlic nan, masala kulcha are tasty.
Another favorite here is the hyderabadi biriyani(veg) served with curd! It is beautifully cooked and excellent to taste!

SERVICE: Here comes the part why i rate this place a 4 on 5. Service is a little disappointing always. Food comes in 25 mins after you serve and they dont serve you water unless you request them to. I think this area could be improved a little!

PRICE: Price wise this place is like Park street restaurants which is fine considering their food is a big plus which woos me back here everytime!

Used to be my all time favorite at Gariahat some years back. Went back after a long time. i liked the decor. It was not very crowded. The north Indian food was average in test (chicken reshmi, butter naan, kaali daal). We went after a shopping spree so we needed some rest. This place was ideal for that purpose. My suggestion is food can be better, only ambiance does not assure returns of customers.

Was here way back, with my parents, for dinner.. The decor was nice, along with the utensils they served in. Don't know if they maintained their standard or if it has changed..
The order was pretty straightforward, because in those days I didn't experiment much. Went for Chicken Butter Masala and Butter Naan, along with Reshmi Kabab.. The Reshmi Kabab was average, but I remember having liked both the Naan and the Butter Masala..
The overall preparation was extremely spicy and rich though.. Its a good restaurant, but as it says, only for casual bites.

I was sceptic of the place when my friend told me of it..but i gotta say it didnt dissapoint.
Lovely bollywood styled decor and a wonderfully ambiance with great food,is what u will be treated with.
Every dish was pretty good..but the tandoori chicken and bhuna gosht stood out for me!!
P.S- its very pocket friendly ;)

This place used to be really really popular some years back. Seems to have lost its charms since. Last time I went there it was a Saturday afternoon, and the place was surprisingly desserted. Mirch Masala is decorated in a bollywood cum road side dhaba theme that goes great with the food they serve, which understandably is typical north indian. Coming to the food, the kebabs we had that day was really juice and succulent. The tardka and chicken tikka butter masala was finger licking as well. The quantity was more than enough for two people, and we had to overeat to get even close to finishing the food. The price was a little on the higher side..but given the quantity it was understandable.

This restaurant is hard to miss, located right beside Gariahat Pantaloons. Yesterday we tried the Chinese section (we had a Groupon) and I was completely satisfied. 

Ambience: it is okay. Quite pleasant with its yellow lights and wooden furniture. The ceiling is rather low, and some tables are clearly preferable. Don't go too late in the evening, or else you'll be stuck with one if the worse ones (as we were). 

Food and drinks: the cocktails are not that good. Other drinks are very reasonably priced. For starters, we had Chilli Pepper Fish which was the best thing I had that evening. The fish was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and with generous portions (8 pieces). I had Chicken Manchow Soup and my companion had the Chicken Lung Fung soup. Both ere delicious and rather heavy. The Lung Fung preparation had a raft of egg whites floating in it. For main course, we had Fish in Chilli Oyster Sauce, Egg Hakka Noodles and Singapore Egg Fried Rice. The fish was perfect, definitely worth having again. The rice and noodles were okay, nothing to write home about. For dessert we had Darsan with Ice Cream. They served us two generous portions which we finished even with bursting stomachs.
Service: this is the USP of this place. Really friendly and courteous service, I've never felt so welcome at a restaurant - especially not with Groupons.

This place is definitely worth visiting over and over again - for cheap drinks, merry atmosphere, finger-licking starters and topped off with friendly service. I would give this place a 4 based solely on food, but for an overall experience, it's closer to a 5.

Located way to Pantaloons from Gariahut.
Ambience is pleasant.
Walls were decorated beautifully with intellectual photographs.
Foods were good, not extraordinarily.
Service was satisfactory.
Bar menu was usual and fantastic.
A bit expensive, best when it is shared among.
Good place to hang out with close once.
Overall, a charming place to visit.

Well...frankly speaking...will nvr ever forget this place...coz dis was the very first place where i started boozing...
Located in just another heart of the city...Gariahat...it is a themed restaurant having a rajasthani village ambience inside...it is quite spacious...and perfect for a pocket friendly hangout with buddies...
Foodwise...u get north indian cuisine here...which is quite good...n worth the price...
So...if ur pockets are not not talking much...nd u want to savour ur tastebuds with some "Mirch" n "Masala"...n also go "talli" at the same time...den...dis is the one...in short..."Mirch masala restaurant & bar"...!!

Went to this place for a family dinner. We went in the Chinese section. The place is nice but they only have table for 2 & 4 people. We were a group of 5 so it was a little uncomfortable for us when we shared a table for 4. The service is average. We ordered two chicken starters chilly pepper chicken and dragon chicken, both the dishes were good. For main course we ordered fried rice and Hakka noodles which were average. We also ordered chicken mandarin and Szechuan lamb. The Chicken was not that good but the lamb was delicious. We ordered darshan with ice cream as desert which is my all time favourite and it was good. I enjoyed my visit.üíï

Finally I had the pleasure of joining some great friends (brothers) at Mirch Masala in Gariahat to celebrate Himobanta's birthday. Standing in the southern hub of Kolkata just beside Gariahat Pantaloons, Mirch Masala is an incredible restaurant that offers a fresh taste of Indian & Chinese Gourmet. Diner indulges while their inner selves sway softly to easy listening music. Prepared with passion and verve, the chefs at Mirch Masala are all set to take us on a food trip.

Ambiance in Chinese section was cosy with nice decor and sitting arrangements were decent enough. We selected ‚ÄòTom Yam Chicken Soup‚Äô & ‚ÄòOkai Chicken Soup‚Äô as appetizer, followed by ‚ÄòDragon Chicken‚Äô & ‚ÄòPepper Garlic Fish‚Äô for starters along with ‚ÄòFresh Lime Soda‚Äô. Both Tom Yam & Okai soup served with bread roll was delicious and had nice fillings, very aromatic. Dragon Chicken was nicely done and tasted great, spices and flavour was just right. Pepper Garlic Fish was even better; the soft succulent fish pieces melted in my mouth and tang was perfect, it brought hint of smile in my face. ‚ÄòFresh Lime Soda‚Äô tasted really good, ideal to beat the heat.

For mains we warily decide ‚ÄòBlack Pepper Fish‚Äô, ‚ÄòYum Bang Chicken‚Äô, ‚ÄòShanghai Chicken Rice‚Äô, ‚ÄòBeijing Chicken Noodles‚Äô, ‚ÄòSingapore Mixed Noodles‚Äô and salad. Quantity was generous, and service was quick. We started off with Black Pepper Fish and Shanghai Chicken Rice, this combination works out magically. Succulent fish fillets and added a delicious light coating infused with a hint of sweetness and cracked black pepper, a perfect flavour combination. 

Next we tried Yum Bang Chicken with both noodles and I found them just average. Noodles were also spicy and they tried to overpower the taste and flavour of Yum Bang Chicken. Normally Yum Bang Chicken is packed with flavour but I felt it was lacking something. Our server was prompt, courteous and he really made our meal that much more enjoyable.

Finally in desserts we had ‚ÄòDarsan with Ice Cream‚Äô topped with red cherry. Darsan was enjoyable; it brings a sweet ending to our lunch. Generally speaking I found food was good and a definite tryout place if you are near gariahat area.

Visited this place quite a few weeks back .... located in a small lane¬† across gariahat road ..... there isn't any separate car parking space associated with the restuarant but the small road on which its located, several cars are being parked serially ...so parking wont be a problem hopefully¬† ....... the ambience inside is that of a well decorated Dhaba which is the main theme of the restuarant ..... but the overall quantity of light inside should be slightly increased i think ......
Regarding food quality ... i have tried their chinese menu .... which i liked quite to the extent of my satisfaction .... have tried Konjee chicken ... Dragon chicken ... Red wine chicken and mixed fried rice .... all of them tasted quite good ..konjee was the best .... have also tried Schzewan Fish ...was nice as well ..... pricing is slightly on the higher side if not normal ....

Located just beside gariahat Pantaloons this place has a very unique interior setup. The serve very good food and have the best working staffs who always greets you with smile. I am a regular visitor of this place. The dishes that I would recommend is mili jhuli kebab which is a mixed platter of kebabs. Order this and you would get to try different kinds of kebabs they prepare. Another favorite  of mine is chicken mumtaz kebab. A must try is their hydrabadi ghost biryani. Go for kadhai chicken or bhuna ghost as a side dish. All in all this is a very good place with cool ambience and delicious food.

I give an extra point to this place for its interiors. The food needless to say is always very tasty. But the amount is not always up to the mark especially for the starters and side-dishes. I visited this place many a times and I enjoy its ambiance. Again the staff are helpful in choosing the dish of your choice. A must visit while shopping at Gariahat.

wanted to go somewhere...where we cud drink a beer while we have our dinner....wanted it somewhere in the south of Kolkata...so we selected Mirch Masala....this place has been transformed big time since our college days...we went to the indian section...

nice decor...something that reminded me of Pind Balluci....very similar...food served in copper plated dinner set (kashar thala bati) gurjati style sitting arrangements....with pillows...poster and dialogues of old bollywood movies pasted all over and a big yellow kolkata taxi cutout in front of the reception...on a thursday night, it was pretty full which means that this place is definitely popular but also the location is extremely good...

coming to the menu....its pretty basic and nothing exquisite...but the taste was good...we ordered shikari murgh (realised that its actually afghani murgh) ajwani tawa fish, murgh mumtaz (it was too bland and spiceless) garlic naan, bhuna gosht and kadhai chicken...with some beers and whiskey pegs...

food was good...no doubt but they were not spicy and rich....thats good and we ate a lot and didnt feel uneasy...it was a full restaurant and the service was quick in that respect but they look a long time to bring the first set of starters...almost 30 mins...

i deducted some points...just because they didnt had any mocktails...even though it was on the menu....so we ordered pink lady for the ladies in the group which was too sweet.....there was no music played which felt really missing....no personal touch from the servers asking whether the food is ok....they were more like,....this is all u get, eat it or leave it...atleast thats what we felt...

will i return again...may be yes....may be i visit their chinese section...the price was pretty nominal...we paid around 4800 for 6 people all inclusive....my suggestions to them, get some innovation in your menu, you got a grand location and a big client base, give them something different in your food, be creative and plz plz plz, play some music...

This restaurant has two different sections..one is for Indian fares while the other is dedicated to Chinese..They also serve alcohol at a pretty reasonable price..one of the better places off gariahat to enjoy your booze..The first thing that attracts you here is the decor of the place..its themed as a dhaba..there are trees..even a taxi to give you the feel of a road-side dhaba..Coming to food,I would suggest there Chinese menu is better prepared than their Indian spread..We tried:
Shikari Murgh: Nicely prepared..tasted well..loved the flavours..
Fish Ajwain Tikka: The quality of fish should have been better..nothing great about this dish..
Murgh Achari: This dish lacks consistency..though it was spicy but not cooked well..
Handi Mutton: The mutton were a bit chewy and stiff..should have used better quality..tasted decent enough with tandoori roti..
Mutton Hyderbadi Biriyani: It was very spiy..but somewhat lacks the authentic flavour of a Hyderabadi biriyani..
Overall it was an average experience..the food was decent..but should have been prepared with more care,Our total cheque comes to approx Rs.1600/- for 3 people..
Food: 3/5
Pricing: 3/5
Service: 2.5/5
Ambiance: 4/5

Mirch masala: An average Chinese restaurant with average dishes. Nothing great about this place. Food is just OK. One should try chicken starters. Chilli chicken has a very crispy outing which was hard to chew, fried rice was okay. Quantity isn't enough for two.
They have two restaurants, Indian & Chinese... Honestly I do not find this place very peaceful or sober. Alcohols in every table... I felt people mostly drops in here for drinks and not food. Good place to have drinks.
I do not recommend it for family outings. Guys all over, couples getting cozy too...
Just a visit and I am not going there anymore.

Note: This review is for the Chinese section.

This place has a very interesting decor, it kinda look and feels like a roadside Dhaba with drawn walls with trucks and trees and people. There is also a taxi parked on the first floor of the restaurant. The food is really good here and reasonably affordable alcohol. Kebabs and snacks like chicken pakora and stuff like that is really tasty here. The Indian main course is very  good. Haven't tired anything Chinese here apart from starters which very actually quite nice.

This comes a little late as last I visited this place months ago. But anyway here we go
Everytime we go here it's usually pujo time so the place is full and we have to wait. But the staff is more than efficient about handling that. The themed interior decor is simply amazing. Very cool. We loved the taxi wala touch.
The food is pretty good too. We ordered butter naan, chicken butter masala and chicken tandoor. This was probably the first time I actually liked tandoori chicken (I usually complain about the burnt taste).
The service was a little slow, perhaps due to the pujo rush. But that was okay. 
We'll probably visit again next pujo.

Visited: April 2015
location: Just behind pantaloons gariahat. Opposite to china white.
ambiance: Mirch Masala gariahat has two differently theemed (indian and chinise) outlets side by side. I went to the indian one. The place is decorated like a north indian village with a touch of sophistication. The essence is given through the wall paintings, decoratives, brass bowls and plates, traditionally dressed service people, trees and a yellow cab :) (oh yes within the restaurant)
crowd: Fortunate for us, the place was not very crowded. But I have heard that getting a seat requires to wait in a long queue unless u have a reservation. 
service: Although not very professional, the service was very prompt.
food: The food was tasty, try the mirch masala specials. And don't forget the kesari jalebis.
price: not too hefty on pocket
tips: the place is good for dining out with ur date as well as a family dine out. 
It is a bar cum restaurant, but the crowd is decent.
Overall experience: Can't wait to visit the chinese one too! :)

It has been here for a while and I have been here a couple of times by now.

Yet, it was only last time the flavours of food stood out with such intensity.

The d√©cor has always been funky ; an amazingly authentic feel of roadside dhabas, with the walls painted with various pictures of Bollywood stars and highway scenarios. There is even a taxi there! You read me right. :'D

Coming to food, we had ordered Murgh Tandoor. Cooked to succulent perfection with a delicious blend of spices and the pleasantly-absent food colouring. We then moved on to Dum Gosht Biriyani. Fragrant rice, fried onions and spice-marinated chunks of mutton- all came together with such wonderful harmony! We had also ordered Butter Naan and Patiala Kofta. Though the latter was a bit sweet but with the naan, it went very well.

We ended our meal with Kesari Jalebi and Kheer. The jalebi was scrumptious! Absolutely scrumptious!

Pocket Pinch -1571/- for 3 people.

The ambience is great, totally in line with a pure punjabi dhaba. We visited the restaurant on a particularly crowded evening, so i had rather not comment on the service. The food was awesome though (vegan and chicken both). I tried the 'mirch sharbat' and was somewhat disappointed by the overdose of sweetness(0.5 stars less for that). All in all, a recommended dining place.

this restaurant has two parts - altogether separated from each other and one might mistake the two sections for two different restaurants had he not known and noticed the name keenly. however, where we had been our first time was the Chinese section.
the first good thing that won over us was the warm reception and hospitality of the staffs and management.¬† we were having our lunch in a cool setting - calm serene atmosphere and ambiance (not crowded - might be for a weekday noon) , soothingly lit and tastefully & decently adorned (with oriental motifs in Japanese style) medium sized room. 
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† now the food - we had 'Hongkong rice' and 'tiger prawn in red wine' ( we also had schezwan rice in our wishlist, but the manger recommended us to take something else for it would be too spicy) . the mixed-hongkong rice was quite different from what we generally have and it seemed quite awesome to me - a blend of hawai, Latin flavor with Chinese tang. but what i was most enthusiast about - the prawn in red wine seemed plain - quite okay (gravy- sweet and thick) but carries no distinct flavor of wine and nothing special about it. we had some soups (average - light and tasty), cocktail- pina colada and margarita and went for further starters - chicken drumstick - which was quite a disappointment as it couldn't leave up to what we expect it as one. those were simply some fried chicken pakora like. 
another time (recently) we hopped in to the other section (North-Indian) to explore the spicy cuisines. all were good from achariya murgh (tangy and aromatic - though a little high on spice) and other quintessential delicacies, which were mostly too good. if not for anything else, one can be here simply for some pulao or rice dish (as the mirch masala rice was mindblowing) and spending some cool time amidst a wild-rustic set-up (full of nostalgia with 90s Bollywood cravings and stars). well, why not, when everything comes with a reasonable price tag.

The mesmerizing ambience, the delicious food and the warm hospitality n service caught my eye. A feel good atmosphere I must say. I love their starters, especially Tai Pai chicken n the main courses like Fish in chilli oyster sauce, fish in Orange tango sauce, etc and hong kong rice too. The darsan with ice cream dessert tastes perfect for an end to your meal. I liked the lighting and the soups such as lung fong chicken soup but the dressing/presentation can improve. :)

we once ordered a¬† food parcel from this particular restaurant, and the whole eating experience can be expressed in one word i.e. "Yuk!" the ''chef's¬† special'' chicken achari was just a miss as spices were raw and were heavily salted. the navratn korma was just a bunch of chopped vegetables boiled in coconut milk for a minute or so.¬† few months later D decided to try this place again & was equally disappointed with their Chinese.

Mirch Masala is one of most distinct restaurants in Kolkata. The feel to this place is different in its own. It has two sections Chinese and Indian and both are very well equipped and well organized. Both the restaurants serve absolutely delicious food at a reasonable price.

The ambiance of Mirch Masala Indian cuisine section has a very authentic dhaba touch with all the wall paintings and movie posters. It takes you to a different place altogether. Both the restaurants serves alcohol and has different sections for drinkers. I'd love to visit very soon.

I went to this restaurant yesterday. The food was very good and the ambience was amazing.
We ordered Machli ajwain tikka which was heavenly. It was soft and jucy and it melted in my mouth.Then we ordered Gosht dum biriyani. It was a very different kind of a biriyani, something i had never tasted before, but it was good too.
The best part of the visit was the hanging taxi and the writings on the wall !!

The place is a perfect Bollywood Masala. The whole concept, menu, decorations, walls, paintings everything shouts Bollywood. Awesome place for all Bolly fans. The food is also great. One of the rare places in Kolkata where you get good North Indian food.  
We ordered masala chaas, sweet lassi, dahi kebab, paneer tikka, dal makhani, mixed veg, garlic naan and jalebi. 
Everything was so tasty that I think I did some overeating! Their service is great!

All Bollywood fans and all North Indian food lovers should definitely go there!

I visited this place with my sister on a saturday afternoon. It is located beside Pantaloons Gariahat. Its a twin restaurant. Serves chinese in one and a dhaba kind in other. We opted for the latter. Since it was a weekend, we were expecting it to be crowded but to our surprise the place was absolutely empty. We were offered seats upstairs. I loved the ambience. It is a bollywood themed restaurant with dim lights. We had heavy breakfast that morning so decided to have starters only. We ditched plans for the main course. We ordered ¬†tawa fish, machli ajwain tikka and tangdi kebab to eat and Adrak Nimbu Soda and Coke to drink.

The food tasted amazing. The fish items were soft and juicy. Tangdi kebab tasted nothing unusual. Adrak Nimbu Soda was not a disappointment either.

The waiters are very friendly and helped us in choosing our food.¬†

I am surely going back to this place!

On a Satday evening , after watching open tee bioscope, we were looking for affordable place to have couple of drinks and finger food. My friend came up with the suggestion .. Mirch masala. Conveniently located near ballygunge pantaloons , Mirch masala is a nice place for evening drinks. They have twin restaurant Chinese and a dhaba. We opted for dhaba. Interior is nicely done with Bollywood theme. We sat in downstairs. Service was prompt and drinks were really affordable. 6 large bp and kebab costed around 1100. I plan to revisit the place before winter bid good bye to kolkata.

Went there few days back. Nothing much to say. Situated in the heart of gariahat. Nice cozy place.Good decor.. Although I am not much fond of restaurents,bars and lounges in South Kolkata.Still I kinda liked the place.Often used to come in college days..

We had whiskey
Beer
Mixed noodles
Chicken red wine.

The noodles and the side dish was awsum..Just mind blowing.The staffs are well behaved and they always had an eye on what the guests want and they are very quick to take the order and serve the food.

Only thing which led me to give it only 3.5 stars was that the price is on the higher side.Places lik Park street,Salt lake,China town serves more varieties of good food and the same liquor with a price lower than them.

What is slightly bizarre about this restaurant is that they have separate restaurants located next to each other for Chinese and North Indian. 
Food is really good. I like the Kulcha there, and the Chicken Butter Masala. The biriyani isn't a disappointment at all. Although the place looks a bit shabby and lifeless at times, I like that calm ambience. A really good place to dine in, at affordable prices.

This particular eatery is one of the few restaurants in kolkata that have a definite theme. On entry in the 'bar and restaurant' section, one is greeted with a refurbished front end of a truck and various bollywood film sequences as murals.
Getting to the food, the menu is strictly indian and they are quite good at it. The liqour section is a bit limited. But, time spent here can very well be memorable. An increased selection of cuisine and liqour would certainly add to the attraction.

Went there in a rainy night with a friend and faced both :-) & :-( and the reasons are as follow:
:-) 1. Dam biriyani and hariyali kabab was awesome
    2. Garnishing & presentation of foods are impressive.
    3. U don't need to wait more.
    4. Chicken with red wine is yammiee, though it's not that good joint for Chinese.
:-( 1. we weren't welcomed properly and were disappointedly embarrassed with wet umbrellas. No one told or directed us where to keep them.
   2. Lighting is not good. We couldn't be able to see the colour of our food. Wall decoration may give u a feeling of eating in a busy lane (lack of calmness)

I think one of the crucial aspects of any outside dining is the service that is provided and the way it is provided. Inside we all feel the need to be pampered and served food in a courteous manner. To me it ranks as important as the quality of food we are eating. It is the ability to make any customer feel special that is almost gone in the restaurant business. That is why I was very happy to see amazingly courteous and friendly behavior by all the staff at Mirch Masala. The food comprising of Masala Thumps Up, mile jule kabab (assorted kabab platter), dum biryani, gosht rara and hyderabadi biryani was hot and delicious. Special mention for both the biryanis. You will not get this unique taste anywhere. A must visit to relive the memories of fine dining.

There are some incidents in life you never forget and my first visit to Mirch Masala is one of those. The year was 2006 and on a particular day my friends and I decided to bunk college and roam wild and free in Gariahat and indulge in all those fancies that young broke students do i.e. smoking Chancellor cigarettes etc etc. Needless to say tramping, roaming and romping does work up and appetite and so being the bold adventurers we were the four of us tramped into Mirch Masala. Being students at that time we were call carrying between Rs30-Rs50 each and we quickly realized that our entire pooled collection would literally buy us nothing. I still remember to this day that the four of us ordered a single plate of Chicken Biriyani, each of us feigning that we were not hungry and each saying to the other "Aare baba mere ko bhuk nahin hain tu le le," finishing our meager morsels of biriyani we walked out as hungry as we had walked in each to slink away home and say to our mothers " Ma bhuk lagi hain."¬†

¬†Needless to say after my college days were over I returned several times to Mirch Masala armed with an ample wallet and gaggle of friends and family in tow and each time the food was good but never will I forget the wonderful taste of that piping hot chicken biriyani on a day like so many other days the memory of which never fails to bring a smile to my face and a laugh whenever my friends and I relive those old memories.

This restaurant is located at Gariahat, where you can enter from the road beside the gariahat Pantaloons. There are 2 sections..the chinese and the Indian. I tried chinese before and it is really good. One of the better restaurants in the Gariahat area. Recently i tried the Indian section. Now this has a very different looking ambience. The place looks like a dhaba located near a jungle with trees and all the film star posters who look like the dhaba's employees. We took a kebab platter which has 12 different kinds of kebabs including fish, chicken, mutton.. Also tried the biriyani, which does not taste like the normal biriyani of arsalan, shirag bt a bit different, in a good way.. I liked it. I could not try anything else as this was really heavy. Next time i am gonna try a less filling starter and more of items.

Located at the heart of Gariahat this restaurant has the look and feel of a typical Punjabi dhaba. The interior is very colourful with vibrant and colourful photos and decor all over the place. Once you enter you see this Yellow Kolkata Taxi mounted on a high platform... this gives the place a crazy and bohemian look. They follow the quintessential punjabi cuisine and so this place is a delight for foodies who love to eat punjabi food with a lot of spice and ghee in it. The tandoori items are very tasty and so are the rotis, kulchas and naan. The murgh mirch masala is a must try dish. So are the other ¬†The vegetarian items like alu tandoori are equally tasty. They also serve alcohol which is an added bonus. Overall a nice place to enjoy a meal with your friends and family.

Ambience: It has the theme of BOLLYWOOD. There are wall paintings with Bollywood actors and actresses in rural scenes and funny dialogs written here and there. Even their menu card is a pretty animated one. But what catches your eyes is the life size taxi inside the restaurant placed in a way that it looks like it has just had an accident. It was all very interesting. The rest of the place is built in the form of a traditional dhaba. I rate it 4/5.
Food: Tasty North Indian food. Quantity is sufficient. The menu provides a lot of options. I rate it 3.5/5.

Service: They are extremely slow in rush hours. Behaviour of the staff is however very nice. I rate it 3.5/5.

Price: Slightly expensive compared to many other economical dhabas but some of the items are considerably affordable.

Overall, I give it 3.5/5.

One of the theme restaurants of Kolkata, it was totally eye-popping the first time we visited, nearly thirteen years ago. Now however, when we visit, the novelty of the decor has somewhat worn off. The films and dialogues need updating! The food however, is another matter. Always satisfying and filling. The brass plates and glasses- very posh, desi style. We always order the pink lady and the kebab platter. The main courses always vary and the naans, rice, veggies and meats just disappear off the plates especially when we are visiting in large groups and order many and multiple dishes. By the time we have eaten three-fourths of the spread we are sleepy and happy and begin wishing that the seats were cosier. That's the only thing they need to work on.

Located near Pantaloon Gariahat, this place was one of the first theme restaurants in kolkata. This is our family's one of the most frequented joint. We prefer this joint for its Indian cuisine. The ambience is quite nice and peppy, walls decorated with Bollywood personalities and famous Bollywood top dialogues. The food here have always been good. The murgh malai tikka and lasuni tikka are dishes to order. We always make it a point of visiting here during the winters for Saarso Saag and Makai ki Roti. 

PS : Please keep some space for its Jalebis and Gulab Jamuns......yummy.

I have always liked the service at this place,I would recommend this place more for Indian cuisine than Chinese...¬†me and my friend had ordered beer,chicken konjee & crispy honey chicken.Crispy Honey Chicken :: The crust was well cooked with the taste of honey mixed well with the tinge bit of spice present in the preparation , the thickness was the crust was perfect.Chicken Konjee:: Now seriously this was wayyyyyyyyyyy to spicey for the palate, I really like spicey stuff but the spice quotient in the ingredient hit the room, we actually ordered a couple of beers to get over the spice. I mean seriously its chinese not hybrid indo-chinese preparation. As chinese dishes generally keep the spice in check to a certain extent only the Indian version of the same has more spice. But otherwise it was good.Service is very prompt as alwaysRate is reasonable & justified in accordance of the food & service

Located in the lane adjacent to Gariahat Pantaloons Mirch Masala was one of the first theme restaurants in Kolkata.Set up with a Bollywood theme this place created quite a stir when it first opened its doors.The blowing of the horn,the taxi,the Bollywood posters donning the walls did manage to give the place a filmy feel and attract a lot of attention.Gradually with time the popularity has died down quite a bit.

The food is understandably mainly Indian.The kebabs are the undoubtedly the main attractions of this place.The fish kebabs deserve a special mention.The fish used is fresh and all the kebabs are in general tender and succulent.They are really well marinated.The main course items are decent but for me neither the quality nor the quantity justifies the price tag at present.The biryani is very average.

They have also opened a separate part adjacent to the main and original Mirch masala which serves Chinese.I have not tried the Chinese much but the little that I have tried it was quite mediocre.The ambience is also very simple and average.In short this is not the one you would want to be visiting.

The service is okayish,sometimes quite slow.The prices have gone up with time and the last time I visited I felt it was a bit over priced.The bar menu is decent and the pricing of the drinks is also decent.

Overall Mirch Masala does not carry the same appeal as it used to when it first opened but it is still a decent option mainly for the kebabs.

A few of us Indians with two very good Italian friends, Carlo and Alberto, visited this place looking for a good Indian experience and we couldn't have been to a better place.
¬†¬†¬†¬† The ambiance was rustic and consistent right from the walls, waiters uniform and brass-esque cutlery which some how reminded me of Peshawari at ITC Sonar. The place had a life sized honk-able half Ambassador car. So, that's double thumbs up from me.
¬†¬†¬†¬† The food was great in general. The kababs were succulent, juicy and the meat would come off the bone effortlessly. They were that good! We flirted around a lot with the starters and my personal favorite is the reshmi kabab, although my friends found the mutton better. Then there was this Chicken Makhni, a rich, aromatic and tasty curry. Cheese Naan and Garlic Naan were all good. I would probably request them to make a Cheese Naan with garlic toppings, should be epic! :P For the food we ate, the money they charge is justifiable. BTW they serve beers as well!
¬†¬†¬†¬† The service was top notch. The waiters were courteous and definitely quicker than expected (Have to thank the lazy and less crowded Thursday evening for that.) 
¬†¬†¬† Overall a great experience for us, especially the Italians who loved it, and we would definitely go back there. Maybe not a great one for Carlo (one of the Italian friend), who apparently has seen Shah Rukh Khan so many times in his past 3 months in India (on movies, ads and more recently on the walls of this restaurant) that he is convinced SRK is omnipresent. He is not too happy about that! Hahaha!

Visited this outlet late one Thursday with a friend after office. The ambience is really great and you will feel nostalgic with all the retro bollywood and south Indian superstar paintings. Amitabh , srk , rajnikant pictures are done inside the outlet. The food here is either Indian or Chinese. We ordered two chicken biryanis and my friend ordered a beer. We were served our food in steel thalis , quite like a Dhaba. The biryani was great with adequate portions and finely cooked. The prices are reasonable too. The most striking interior decoration was the real Taxi installed within the outlet. We liked the service and the food. Hope to try new dishes soon. The biryani was priced at 210 and the beer was 190 rs. Our Total was 672 rs. Which was affordable .

An excellent place to hangout, have some quality time with family or even just have a quick bite. Mircha masala is conveniently located behind Pantaloons ,Gariahat and a regular joint for catching up with old buddies. Cheap booze, good kababs and a quirky semi dhaba-semi bolly inspired decor, this place definitely has its own charm.

Staff behaviour are erratic, we have been at the both ends, the waiter attending us to the minutest detail as well as being absolutely ignored, so service depends on your stars!!
Kabab platter makes an excellent side for ur drinks, while it is advisable to finish off with roti/ naan and typical heavy mughlai meat gravies. Handi biriani is the worst i have ever tasted and regret ordering it till the day.Mostly spicy tangy Indian cuisine at best.
while u are waiting for your food, crazy dialogues, posters and one liners inspired by bollywood add to that fun element.
Hard to get a place , even during weekdays. but conveniently located and extremely popular. do check it out.

Its quite a nice place to dine out if you are out with your girlfriend/boyfriend or with your family and with your friends you can always enjoy the drinks though a tad expensive and provided there are so many cheap/semi cheap and standard bars all over the city why would you come here anyway
Coming to food i have heard there kebabs are really good so when you visit there make sure you have there kebabs, unfortunately me and my friends went for drinks and we ordered for dragon chicken, which was tasty and spicy. a good option for starters. Then we¬† ordered for red wine chicken and singapore noodles. Both the items were pretty decent and tasted good but nothing spectacular. Try other dishes and im sure they will be much better. 
Service was pretty prompt and the ambience too was appealing

Its been there for ages and a must visit for authentic Dhaba styled food . If you are in and around Gariahat Ballygunge or South Calcutta you must visit this place. And for all those people missing Calcutta food please tell your friends to drop in here.

Must have's: Mutton preparations like the Bhuna Gosht, Kababs and Kabuli Naan and Masala Kulcha.¬†

No regrets and I want to go back again soon.

This is a restaurant where I have visited many times, only the Indian part. Whenever I am with friends and wanna have some drinks n nice food n chillax this place, located right beside the pantaloons gariahat rightly serves the need.
The decor is rustic with lots of posters of old days movie, the perfect amount of light to make the ambiance smooth n relaxing. Also, no one can miss the taxi located on the 2nd floor.  I wish they make it a food table. :)
Coming to the food, every food on the Indian menu is lip smacking, spicy n tangy. The kebabs are their speciality esp one fish kebab I dont remember the name though. The biryani is nice although I feel the amount is less. Best stay on the kebabs n drinks n finish with roti/ naan n chicken tikka masala. 
Price wise for 2ppl if u eat a more than usual will cost 1200 but normally its 1000 for 2ppl. A bit costly I feel.

When it comes to dining, coupled with an astonishing interior design and an unorthodox ambience, very few restaurants could come close to Mirch Masala.
The food is really appreciable, and has maintained its standard. 
The butter naan with Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala is the best combination.

I prefer this restaurant over and above some over-rated Gariahat eateries.

The thing worth noticing is the Taxi they have inside the restuarant. The ambience is perfect. The walls are decorated with some nice bollywood cartoons. Its worth mentioning that along with the other spices, they have also taken good care of bollywood masala.
The food is okayish, nothing extraordinary.¬†
But if you are planning to go to a place where you can chill along with a heavy meal then this is probably the right place for you.

Full marks for the decor and the ambience. The food was average, nothing spectacular, except for the biryani. The major let down was the staff, especially the one at the cashier table.  Extremely rude and snobbish and not at all welcoming. The staff would be the only reason why I wouldn't go to this place again.

Every time I am in Kolkata, I definitely try to visit this restaurant. The interiors and ambience I like very much. The famous bollywood dialogues, characters painted on the wall will surely provide u the taste of bollywood masala. This time I visited here during Puja days. As expected it is hard to find a seat, though we were lucky enough to get our seat after few minutes waiting. Food is really spicy and great. But like most of the other restaurants in Kolkata during puja time they are also failed to maintain the quality, service and taste. Chicken kababs are ok, biriyani is not upto the mark. So for festive days this place is not suggested.

The dhaba decor is quirky and fun. My father being a foodie who loves North Indian cuisine is a great fan of this place. We had the delicious paneer tikka masala, murg mastana kabab, dumbiriyani, murgh makhani. The food is delightful and not too heavy on your pocket! ¬†Go get a meal..and who knows you might end up loving the place!

Totally awesome place. Visited during the Pujas, and so had vegetarian. Still loved the masala kulcha, and the kadaai paneer. The quality and quantity both were satisfactory. The only negative problem was that they had only one washroom which became so crowded that it was impossible to go in. Still loved the interior decorations, which wre quite different from anywhere else. Overall, a nice place for a meal.

The ambiance was truly Indian so was the food. Even the crockery was Indian. All the items were good especially chicken makhani, bhuna chicken, Rajasthani hariyali chicken, mutton pulan and lasun butter nan. The only disappointment wad the vegetable pulao.  Among sweets gulab jamun n kesari imirti was just mouth watering.

This place is just beside Pantaloons, Gariahat.¬†A multi-cuisine restaurant, Mirch Masala serves both Indian and Chinese cuisines, but you should take a hint from the name of the restaurant itself as to which cuisine is better! ¬†:D ¬†we went to the indian restaurant.
The interiors are decorated with Charpoys and lanterns.It‚Äôs looks are made like a dhaba with taxi, typical painted walls.
The wall's painted with filmy, very filmy theme, A Garage/Dhaba styled interior, drinks and food. what else you need.
¬†Shikari Murgh, Chandi Murgh Tikka, Dum Biryani, Hara Lahsuni Naan and Kofta Lajawab are amazing and delectable. The dhaba atmosphere of the place looks classy in its own way. Service is good and quick. Waiters are well-mannered and polite.In sweets, kesariya jalebi was so fresh & tasty..
I recommend this place to everyone for at least one visit.

I enjoyed everything about this restaurant. Starting from the awesome Dhaba decor to the food,dessert and service. Simply made my bday treat delightfully enjoyable.  
We started off with the Tawa Fish which was fish pan fried in a mixtute if spices. Lipsmacking! 
Next we had the boti kebabs which was great.
Now in main course we took gosht Dumbiriyani. It had a different mix of flavours. With the mutton cooked real soft. I loved it. Along with it we took murgh lasuni,which was ok.
Lastly we had kesar jalebis. Loved it. Just as jalebis are supposed to be. 
The pocket pinch is a bit high. But Nevrmind dat!

I could talk a lot about the ambience of this Gariahat restaurant that looks pretty no-nonsense from the outside, but I shall restrain myself, because some readers should enjoy the surprise that it offers! My dad has a juvenile liking for the dhaba-like decor. The old taxi placed midway, amidst the 'junglee', shaggy, dark, musty interiors. The other day I heard a small girl chirping over her food saying she is the happiest in the 'taxi' hotel, and I instantly knew what she meant and what my dad meant!

So moral of the story is that the unusual decor makes you happy and hungry! Now moving on to the food - well, it is north indian cuisine, a regular fare of kebabs, rotis, parathas, naan, biryanis, daals and meat curries. You could order anything, saag chicken, hara bhara kebab, dal tadka, rajasthani chicken, kebab platter, chicken tandoori, absolutely everything on the menu is quite nicely palatable. My personal favorites are Hyderabadi murgh biryani (it is a minty green biryani with subtle flavors, and shredded chicken - has no real connect with the nizami biryani that is served anywhere near hyderabad, but nevertheless awesome in its own unique way. The portion size is generous, and served with onion raita), chicken methi malai, saag chicken, mutton rara, hara bhara kebab, dal tadka and kesariya jalebi.

The tables are well laid out and the service is commendable. Waiters are dressed in red pathani kurtas a la 'coolie' style. They are helpful, agile and courteous. On weekends service tends to be a tad slow, as the place is packed to capacity. Pocket pinch is very reasonable, about 650 for 2.

I would like to highlight few points based on my experience in this north Indian restaurant. I heard a lot of good words about the restaurant but to my surprise , I was not at all satisfied with it. Apart from the dhaba theme ambience, there are lot of areas where they need to improve. Me along with my wife ordered tawa fish which was good. In main course we had sabzi pulao which was full of oil, may be more than sabzi, it looked like oil pulao. Lasuni chicken was not at all good. Chicken pieces were not fresh and were rubbery. We also did not like the gravy. Okay, time for a veg item. Navratna korma - frankly, they may not know how to prepare the same. Above all, none of the items were having even a tinge of salt. The service was so so.... I hope they will improve their food and customer experience.

U had been visiting this place since the very begining of this restaurant. They dint have a bar license then. I pointed out that the quality of food has fallen drastically with availability of bar license. Had been at this place often in last 10 years. What attracts me is its interior of road side dhaba.... its distinct.... Among all foods I have tried here, the most prominent n worth mention is Fish Ajwain Tikka. Its mouth watering. 
Though this restaurant is far from being value for money, you may visit here to quench your gastronomical thirst.
Hence recommended.

Mirch Masala is really a spicy place as it goes by the name. The wall decor and light arrangements and THE TAXI are unique and is so so different from all the other restaurants we go daily. they have two set of restaurants one serving Chinese and the other dealing in North Indian foods. 
1. The Chinese - Been there a couple of times and the ambiance is good and food is delicious as well. Tried dry chilli chicken, szechwan fish, chicken egg wrap rice, chicken exotic and lamb szechwan. All are in good quantity. 
the waiters and the other staffs there are quite friendly and helpful.

2. North Indian - now talking about this part is like going through a lot of dishes. I have been there more than 20 times now and i simply love this place. Even i had a client who came in from the USA and he was in love with this place and we visited it regularly during his span of stay of 70 days in Kolkata. They serve you food here in plates and glasses made of bell metal which is all so different from the rest of the places. Two of the best thing i like here are cheese naan and the chicken platter. but have tried a lot of dishes here starting from biriyanis to dal makhanis to a lot of kebabs.
the bar counter is a cool place as well. The bar tenders are well known to me so they make the drink pegs absolutely to my taste and preferences. the stuffs here are extremely friendly and caring.
One issue is that its tough to find a place here after 8:30 as its always packed be it a weekday or a weekend. So go grab your seat before its occupied.

I would recommend this place all the time as its very close to my heart and i have never been disappointed visiting here.

This place deserves a special mention. I've never experienced such ambience or such unique food items which I found here.  A group of 15 of us went here for a birthday lunch. And we were more than happy, except for the sponsors , considering the slightly high cost compared to the tiny amount they serve. One bowl of a dish would at maximum satisfy only 2 hungry people. There are 2 sections of this restaurant. A Chinese, and a North Indian. We went to the latter.

The ambience deserves a very special mention. Once inside, you'll feel transformed into a new place totally. There are scripts in hindi all over the walls. There's a taxi here and some posters of movie stars dressed as drivers there. An air-conditioned road side dhaba it would seem, if something like that ever existed.  The plates and glasses are all of bell metal, adding to the beauty of the atmosphere. The waiters are extremely polite and helpful. They helped us choose the order a lot. The service, but, is a bit slow.
 During that waiting time we almost finished off the complimentary achaar, dhaniya chatni and raita they had offered !


Now coming to the food, it was really really unique and yummy. We started with SHIKARI MURG. It's one of the rarest and tastiest dishes I've ever had. The pieces are like tandoori chicken, equally big, soft and delicious, but the spices used are totally different. We liked it so much that we ordered another plate at the end ! Then came the GOSHT HYDERABADI BIRIYANI. It's the best Hyderabadi Biriyani I ever tasted. It is green , the rice strands being juicy and soft. You wouldn't need a side dish to finish it off happily within minutes. The best part of the biriyani was that the mutton pieces were shredded in it, so everyone got pieces of the tender and juicy mutton on their plates. Then came the LEHSUNI CHICKEN gravy. It was a gravy of garlic and cashew paste. Tasted wonderful. The KABOOLI GOSHT was not upto the mark though. There were very few and extremely tiny pieces of mutton in it. Moreover it had a bit of a sweet taste.¬†
The bar here also has a variety in it. Sadly, we didn't get a chance to taste it this time due to the hurry some people had in our group.

So, this place must be tried out by every foodie. For it's great food and unique but delicious dishes, though it maybe a bit heavy on your pockets if you are non-earning ! But you won't repent trying it out, I can guarantee ! :-)

This is one of my favourite places as of now. Good food at reasonable price, liquor at reasonable price,service a little slow ( that's okay actually when you want to spend a lot of time) and good ambiance. food quality is really good and you will be quite impressed. Please try Murgh ¬†Mirch Masala Pulao with Murg Methi Malai. This combination is heavenly. ¬†Honestly I have never been a big fan of their kebabs, it's never been up to my expectations. I would say only Fish Ajwain Tikka is really ¬†yummy.And same goes for the mocktails, that's really disappointing. Over-all its a good experience.Its a RS 1500 cost (with liquor )for two place.
PS: Extremely crowded in weekends. Anticipate a 30-40 mins wait post 8.30pm.

I visited this place with my friends a few days back and i would like to highlight one thing that we were super hungry that day. This place being close to my college but still never got the chance to visit it and at last i thought of trying it out. i was quite impressed with the interiors as it was so well decorated unfortunately the place was fully crowded and so we were asked to wait for thirty minutes as i was adamant to try out the food here we did not search for any other restaurant but the wait lasted for 40 minutes and it almost killed us. Finally when we got a place to sit i was literally in cloud nine and we did not waste any time and quickly decided to have tawa fish, butter nun, mutton dum biryani, murg makhani and the lasooni murg was suggested to us by the staff because we asked him as to which chicken dish would be better.  I never thought that the wait for food would be extended for another thirty minutes and i can seriously say that partially my brain stopped working as i could not wait any longer and i was actually pissed off with the slow service. When the food arrived i actually started gulping down the food as quickly as possible and i was not in a position to judge the quality of the food at first but still we liked the tawa fish, dum biryani was good but nothing special, murg makhani was yummy and better than the lasooni chicken as i found the latter to be a tad oily. My friends wanted to order one more biryani but we were told that it will take a long time so we had to cancel it. At last we tried the jalebis which were warm and nice.In future I will only try this place if i don't have to wait to get a seat otherwise the wait really ruins the fun of enjoying the food. I also feel none of the items were extraordinary but i must say that the staffs were very polite ( so extra points for that).

Have been there quite few times . A theme based restaurant with the idea of an urban dhaba ( though I myself feel they ¬†themselves are quite confused bout their dhaba theme ; and over the years it is not that well maintained ) . Food is good , service is ok , ambiance is also quite ok . Almost all the indian dishes are justified & based on a very spicy tune . They serve food in brass thalis which I like most . Try their shikari kebab , boti kebabs and tawa fish ¬†along with whisky or scotch . For main course a good choice would be gost hydrabadi biriyani or murgh dum biriyani along with murgh mirch masala or handi gosht . And if you prefer breads like me go for plain tandoori ¬† roti or butter nun with kadhai gosht or rahra gosht or bhuna gosht . Red rum complement with them very well .¬†Chineese food section is horrible , never ever recommended . Over all its a quite decent place and u would not regret for their indian foods .¬†

Prices around 2000 for two .

A decent enough place. Food is good and affordable, the quantities are commendable as well. Not the 1st place that would come to your mind when you think of great food but you will like to go back to it never the less. Try something else other than the biriyani, you might like it more. And do not even dare to go near it during the Durga Pujas, it will be the biggest mistake you could make.

The unique and creative ideas of the people who decorated this restaurant deserve a round of applause from whoever visits this restaurant. Half a yellow cab positioned at one corner, rough walls which remind you of a dhaba somewhere in the rustic extremes of Punjab, posters of legendary Bollywood movies hanging on the walls, and heavy copper plates and tumblers, transport you in moments to a totally different world from the traffic-laden brightly lit roads of Calcutta. The service is very good here, with polite and helpful waiters prodding you on to order the dishes most appreciated by regulars. The food is excellent here, and you keep ordering more and more until you realize that you're so full you cannot move! :)

Stranded in Gariahat after hours of shopping? Belly calling? Don't want to go to the not-so-good restaurants in the vicinity? Then, widen your scope and look behind The Pantaloons shopping mall. Yes, there you would find it: the Mirch Masala. The Chinese section of this restaurant is neatly embellished and the place is kept scented with the fragrance of agarbattis (incensed sticks). Since it's also a bar, one can partake of a good feast with his/her choicest beverage. The staffs carry around their countenance a never-waning smile; the politeness in their services will not only appease you, but also you shall find that you are sub-consciously desiring to visit the place again and again. The American Chopsuey was delicious and so were the Chicken Egg-Wrapped Fried Rice and Chili Lamb (shredded). They had the perfect blend of the spices and were concocted with the minimum amount of cooking oil possible. The Fried Rice, in fact, had a lovely steamed aromatic flavour. The prices are moderate and a budget of 1000 bucks is just enough for a total of three people.

Visited the Chinese section today. A well lit place with nice decor. Since it was a rainy day and weekday, other than a couple and us, all other tables were empty, adding on to the calmness of the place.

We were very politely directed towards a place near the ac by them. We ordered Chicken Konjee, Chicken sweet corn soup, yum bang chicken and egg wrapped fired rice. I did not exactly like the man who took our order because he had this little look of annoyance when I tried asking him more about the 'Chicken Exotic' from their menu. However, someone else served us the food and he was extremely sweet and polite. 

The Konje chicken was absolutely wonderful! I could spend the entire day eating those. 5 on 5. The sweet corn soup, which they served with bread roll was quite good as well. The egg wrapped fried rice was pretty decent but the Yum Bang chicken scored a little below average if you ask me. 

However, I was just too pleased with the starter today. The prices of the ice creams looked pocket friendly. Could not order those for weight issues :D
 :3Will HAVE to try next time.

This place is a very convinient option to dine when you are around gariahat for shopping, specially when durga pooja is around the corner, you would be visiting gariahat quite often and you can barge into this place which is just behind gariahat pantaloons. 

I've been here a couple of times for their chinese food and booze. Anything on their menu can be tried, its cooked nicely, but can get very spicey at times, so if your not a very hot n spicey fan you should check the waiters for less spicey ones. 

I'd definitely want to write another review once I try out their Punjabi Food.

Also, try out the fish items- they are quite good and pleasing to the palate. ¬†The best part is the decor however. I just love visiting because of it.

I have been to this place many times and i really love it. Located inside a lane adjacent to gariahat Pantaloons, this place is a must visit for me after every shopping trip at gariahat, specially pantaloons. This restaurant is divided into 2 parts. A Chinese and a Dhaba, both having separate entries and separate decor contrasting with the cuisine. I have been to chinese one a couple of times but its the dhaba that stand out for me.

The sitting arrangement, cutleries, lighting and wall paintings are awesome. I mean where else would you see Shah Rukh Khan selling Pan. The menu also contains funny comments and resembles filmfare magazine. Only you will find celebs commenting about mirch masala's food.

As for the food.......its simply awesome. I personally love the Shikari murg which is like twisting the chicken tandoori (Goes well while Boozing). Cheese nan, Lasuni murg, and Tawa fish are also found frequently on my plate. I also love their pudina coriander chutney that they serve with kebabs.

Price for both liquor and food is also reasonable if you compare with other bar cum restaurants in Kolkata.

Modeled on a Dhaba, with an Amaby as part of the decor, the ambiance is wonderful. Situated close to Gariahat crossing in the southern hub of Kolkata. Food is good but expensive.

Heard lots of this joint form so many sources, but finally arranged a re-union party with friends in both chinese and tandoor section in one evening. covered both. tasted both. enjoyed a lot.
Situated just behind the Gariahat Pantaloons. First one is chinese and next is tandoor, if you are in confusion the staffs will re-direct you to your deserving section.

1. Chinese section:
-------------------

The decor is pretty decent and very nice and service is flawless. Restaurant staffs are well behaved and very much prompt in their action to serve customers, can explain dishes which you need in order to spices, ingredients and taste bud. Mainly we tried non-veg starters with alcohol in this section.

Pan fried chilli fish : perfectly cooked tasted really very well.
Chicken Konjee : One of their best liked it very much. Must try starter.
Red Wine Chicken : boneless diced chicken cooked in tomato sauce and sesame seeds. Nice one. we tried dry one.
baby corn mushroom chicken : Well i think this was the best dish that i had over here. Boiled veggies and chicken were in white base sauce. Flawless.

2. Tandoor section:
-------------------

In order to ambiance this place is far better than Chinese one. Service is generous and pretty same as Chinese one. loved it.

After Chinese we were hardly able to take too many starters for that evening but to quench the thirst of our hungry soul we tried one starter and main courses.

Shikari Murg : It's a less spicy version of chicken tandoori, Kudos. Tasted really well must try for a foodie.
Murg lasuni : Nice one but was average dish.
Rajasthani Hara Murg : Another bouncer. really amazing. Till the last bite we enjoyed this green garvey dish, goes really well with indian bread we tried with butter nun.

As visited 2 of their restaurants, I will recommend both of these are must visit place. In both section food quality with respect to cost is moderate. Neither too much hyped nor too cheap. W.r.t decent ambiance, service and food you can really visit here to have some booz with friends or dine with family.

went into this restro twice. The decor n ambience drove me twice. The typical roadaide dhaba decor. The highway look. The lorry . Then ofcourse the taste. Thumbs up. The first day I went in with 3 of my friends. We ordered for a breezer and to teames it with mile jule kebab and lasuni murgh tikka. Trust me. One of the best kebabs in kolkata. The other day went in seafood was the call. The red wine prawn n the fish in orange tango sauce is one of its kind. B/L mushroom fish is highly recommended. Please do visit in.

Location: In the lane adjacent to Pantaloons, Gariahat. 
(Behind Pantaloons) 

This is the place I was introduced to in my childhood by my elder brother and since then I have been here umpteen number of times! 
It has two sections, one serving the North Indian cuisine and the other serving Chinese. 
The North Indian Section has an amazing ambiance with the decor resembling more of a Dhaba at the highway as depicted in the movies. And on the other hand, the one serving Chinese has an ambiance that's quite soothing and can relax your mind, decor done up with Chinese lamps, feng shui and laser-cut framing.

Coming to the FOODING, it would be difficult to talk about it in details because I have nearly tried all of the fare they have on offer. But, to sum it up, this places serves great quality food with a generous portion size. 

>>Dishes that shouldn't be missed include: 

Tiranga Paneer, Shikaari Aloo, Babycorn Kebab, Lahsun Paneer Tikka, Kali Dal, Dal Tadka, Handi Subzi, Handi Paneer, Navaratna Korma, Patiala Kofta, Cheese Naan, Garlic Naan, Mirch Masala Naan, Gulab Jamun, Kesariya Jalebi, Mirchi Sherbat under the North Indian Cuisine. 

Sweet Corn Soup, Vegetable Konjee, Veg Manchurian, Vegetable Schezuan, Shangai Noodles, Schezuan Rice, Darsaan with icecream under the Chinese Cuisine.

- Have always preferred the North Indian fare over the Chinese out here. 

The service out here hasn't been quite consistent, I say so because at times the service is quick and at times too slow. 
The prices are reasonable for quality fooding.

Overall has been a decent experience (considering all visits).

My most fav place in Gariahat/Ballygunje Phari area (The Chinese Area). I am referring here to the chinese restaurant whose ambience is just wonderful. 
Few awesome starters over there are:

1. Pan Fried Chilli Fish
2. Red wine Chicken
3. Tai Pei chicken (Sweet)

 i would suggest you all to try this place once. You will surely love it.

Mirch Masala is filled with variety of food. The quality of the food out there is just excellent. The ambience makes it more interesting. The bollywood style here attracts the audience n accompanies the food well. Special mention should be given to the 'cheese nun' and ' even the handi biriyani'. Kebabs are mouthwatering.' The kesar jilipi' is just outstanding. The food quite is reasonable. One must go here and just explore.

I have been going to this place since I was 15. And still this place has not changed one bit. In those days it was one of the first rstaurants in Kolkata to have a theme of some sort. Now there r theme restaurnts like mushrooms all over the place. So kudos to these guys to bring n such a place in the heart of Kolkata(its ryt next to the gariahat pantaloons showroom) I have not tried their chinese place but the north indian place just rocks

What can I say about the food,heavenly...ya thts it..shouldnt try to describe them....they r out of the world. Do try the noorani kababs or the shikari kababs. 

After a long day of shopping and frolicking around in south kolkata if you find yourself in the gariahat region and in a dire need for some unwinding.....Mirch masala is the place to be with their bar menu and mouth scintillating food....u will not go under the shoppers guilt at the end of the shopping spree....guranteed

After entering this place you will get a feeling as if you have come to a roadside dhaba. The dum biryani will definitely leave a different impression on your taste buds because of its "thoda haatke style". The tandoori chicken was tasty as well. The service is great. Overall  it was a good experience. Will definitely visit this place in future.

If anyday u feel like going away from the chaos of the city and at the same time is concerned about the quality of food, then this is indeed the place . The interior will make you feel like any road side dhaba and the food is completely awsome . The dum biriyani and bhuna ghost was actually the showstoppers for me . The preparation was completely unique and damn tasty . Overall a great resturant with fabulous food.

Mirch Masala(the North Indian section) is a different concept when it comes to the interiors. It has the feeling of the dhaba that you visit after a long drive on the National Highway. The food is good and the service is commendable. I wish we could order Chinese in the Indian Section as well as both the sections are completely separated from each other and function as independent restaurants.
The metal plates and glasses, the decor, the food and the service.. all of it is mixed in the right proportion to pamper all your different senses and make them work in the right direction. The place doesn't demand one but rightfully earns another visit.

After reading so many positive reviews ,yesterday I ve decided to visit this place with my fiancee at the afternoon. Now we ve opted for the North-Indian section,just behind Gariahat-Pantaloons.The restaurant also have a separate Chinese section. In Zomato it says ,restaurant timing is 12-3pm,and we reached at 2:40 PM,but that was not a problem as you can seat there and relish your food and drink as long as U can. Now I am not a great foodie but I am passionate about food and today I ve obsereved the following points:
1) this restaurant cum bar has a decent ambience with a beautiful decoration based on Indian culture & tradition.U an not miss the big old yellow half cab.
2) The waiters are very courteous and helpful with the menu. Always There was a person in distance to attend you in any need.
3) we were amazed by seeing all the bell metal plates and glasses.
4) they have a decent collection of alcohol,though due to recent scorching weather we ordered a breezer for her and smirnoff for me.
5) Next our choices were Mile-Jule Kebab,Murg Hyderabadi biriyani,Mashala kulcha,Gosht Bhuna.
Quantity wise all the dishes can satisfy two person.
The kebab platter was a combination of variety   kebabs which were delicious but not awesome.
Awesome was the Masala Kulcha :):)Bhuna Gosht was Great but the most horrible was the biriyani ,it was like "Murgir Jhol Vat"!!!
6) There was cotton napkins but no paper napkin,they will give you if u ask for.
7)Now what can I say,there was little cockroaches(nymphs)!!! When we  tell them,them wanted to use spray but due to fear of poisoning the food we prevent them.
8)this restaurant is not too expensive,All the orders costs us only 1474/-
Hence overall our experience was ugood except the nymph incident.eagerly waiting to visit the chinese section soon :)

The first thing that comes to my mind when I think of Mirch Masala is the half yellow cab that they have up on one of their walls. The decor of the Indian section is really nice and appealing in a fun and quirky sort of a way. I am not too fond of neither the Chinese food they serve and nor the place. The Indian section however, is good. The mile jhule kebab which is nothing but an assorted kebab platter is pretty good. The malai murgh tikka, machhli ajwaini tikka, lasuni murgh kebab and tangdi kebab are very good. They are flavourful, succulent and tender. The tandoori prawn however is below par. You can try the assorted Indian breads with these kebabs. The handi gosht, kadhai gosht and kadai murgh are very delicious although the kadai murgh and gosht are prepared with the same spices and condiments. The Hyderabadi biryani is disastrous and so is the dum biryani. I have tried Chinese here a couple of times and have not found it good enough for the price that I have to pay.
The service is a tad slow even when the restaurant is relatively less crowded. The value for money for the Indian section is pretty good and I would definitely recommend that.

It has 2 branches side by side, one is the Chinese and the other is the Indian, serving predominantly North Indian Dishes.

** Location -> Its located at the lane just beside the Gariahat Pantaloons, the lane is popularly called "Pantaloons Goli".

** Brief -> Today I visited the place with a bunch of my friends and had a blast. We tried their chinese section :)

** Ambience -> The ambience is superb with great nicely decorated chinese artifacts :) I have attached pics do check :P

** Things ordered -> we were 14 people in the group. We ordered Chicken Fried Rices,Shcezwan Chicken,Chilly Fish and chicken manchurain. We were a hungry wolf pack and decided to skip the starters and directly hit the Main Course.
Two people from our group also had some beer and whisky :P

The food came super fast, the rice was good to taste, but the quantity was not enough. Some people from the group who had visited earlier complained that they have reduced their quantity, to which the servers mildy protested.The schezwan chicken was not at all upto the mark, it was not spicy but rather tasted very much sour. The gravy was totally unbearable.
The chilly fish was pretty tasty with a perfect blend of the spices :)
The chicken manchurian was a delight and made all of us recover from the schezwan !!

** Purse Check -> The total bill came at Rs.2700/- which I would say was pretty decent :)

** Overall -> Except for that Schezwan we enjoyed, I clicked happily and it was really a good experience. I would have given them 4.5 but for the food I would reduce 0.5 :)

I will soon try their North Indian section :)
Recommended.

Although I went in here to try out Chinese but my friends convinced me to try out Indian instead. And I was not disappointed. I'm not a big fan of stuff like tandoori or kebabs, I like them, but I'd prefer other cuisines, but this restaurant knows what they are doing. It was absolutely mouth watering. The tandoori rotis were soft and butter glazed, the tikia kebab was so soft and tender that it made my tongue melt. The handi gosht was more tasty than I thought it could be. Wonderful experience. Very friendly staff. Would love to go there again.

Often visit here on weekends.
Have tasted most of the items prepared by them.
Crispy honey chicken(who prefers sweet), Konjee chicken are ideal to have with drinks.
Baby corn provided is of good quality.
Dragon chicken--only for the people who can have spicy food otherwise avoid it.
Fried rice and noodles are also good and quantity is enough to feed your stomach at the price you pay.Recently I was really irritated to have the Item "Youm Bang Chicken" -- I do not know what sauce they used but the smell almost made me puke. Worst item for me out of all I have tasted.
This is all about Chinese ambiance of which I like more that the Indian in the adjacent building.In the Indian style I personally do not like the ambiance --the whole concept of taxi and old Bollywood theme really sucks. Food is awesome though --the kababs and the roti s---their kabuli naan and Kashmiri kulcha are just awesome.But the biryani is not that good.
Try to avoid fish items specially fingers and fries--as they provide basa fish which does not taste good.
Ambiance and staffs for the Chinese are just awesome.
One more item I liked recently was shredded lamb--it was too good :)

Last night being Poila Boishakh, my mother and I headed to Mirch Masala for a quiet dinner for two. We were lucky to have entered before 8p.m. as the wait for our table was just 5 minutes long, exactly as promised. While I waited, Ma sneaked off to the next door Mirch Masala Chinese restaurant and came back with the information that the decor was nice-ish there and a plate of Chicken Noodles costs 140/- on the menu.
Coming back to the Indian section, the decor was quirky and Bollywood inspired as usual. I loved the old transistor radio and the tiny aluminium dabba with 'ghar ka khana' written on it. Half a taxi peeping out from a wall, an indoor tree and Bolly stars painted on the walls completed the effect.
We sat at our table and had to ask the staff for water, for the menu card and later repeatedly for our food which was much delayed. I do not know if this was because it was a special occasion that night or if this is the case otherwise as well. We heard other patrons at nearby tables grumbling about the delay and making do with papad and mixture with their drinks while waiting for their starters and main courses.
We ordered a Chicken Tandoori and Butter Naan and asked the steward to recommend a paneer dish. He suggested we try the medium spicy Paneer Lababdaar. The Tandoori was served first and was perfect. Tasty and moist it had the right amount of spice rub on it and went down well. However the rest of the food took so long to show up that Ma and I had resigned ourselves to the fact that this was going to be it for dinner. 
The Butter naan was usual, soft and generously doused in butter. When the Paneer Lababdaar showed up in its kadhai it looked promising but three bites in our eyes were streaming and we were drinking copious amounts of water to wash the mirchi factor down. Though the paneer cubes were fresh and soft the gravy was not much to write home about. Browned onions and tomatoes cooked on a kadhai and then pureed I would say. Overall, a thumbs down for this dish. 
Unlike the rest of the items the bill did not take time to show up. Would I say it was value for money? No. Maybe I would have if the paneer had not been such a let down.
By the time we were making our way out the waiting area was full and a few people were waiting outside the restaurant as well.

The whole Bollywood walls hand crafted gives a very dhaba type feeling. The food keeps you overwhelmed and makes you ask for more. Insanely consistent food quality in very very handsome proportions.

At first I would let people know about the place. Mirch Masala is sub divided into  2 sections :- Chinese section and second is the North Indian section. If you come across Gariahat Market, then search for Pantaloons. It is very next to pantaloons. There is a alley next to pantaloons where you will find thsi resturant. At first there is the chinese section of MIRCH MASALA and after that you will come across North Indian section of MIRCH MASALA. I always prefer the North Indian food as because the North Indian Food is far much better than the chinese section. My favourites is "Mili Jhuli Kabab". I am a great fan of this kabab. This kabab is acombination of chicken kabab, fish kabab, paneer kabab. I love the biryani out here and the murg masalam. The decor is quite fasinating. There are lot of art works. Pictures of various celebrities. The most funniest part i love it is the taxi which looks like coming out of the wall.

This restaurant has been there for ages, literally; we actually grew up in college with this! It was nice to be there after a long, very long time. The decor retains the dhaba theme with a touch of (now vintage) bollywood of the nineties. The service is excellent. The food is still resplendent with North Indian spicy flavours and the tandooris, polaos and meat dishes will satisfy most of our palates. With newer and better restaurants coming up in South Kolkata, it is not the best place for tasting exquisite food, but plan a small sized school or college reunion there and check out how much fun you can have!

Being someone who has been to the original restaurant in Ahmedabad often enough, I had been wanting to go to their franchise in Calcutta for a long while. 

The theme is as amusing as ever (Yeah, you'll see the taxi, and probably blow its horn too, but additionally, look out for the little details that'll bring a smile to your face!). It is perhaps more important to note that the food - as it often does in theme based restaurants - does NOT disappoint. Every dish we had (and believe me, we had quite a few) either touched or comfortably crossed the 'good' bar; as did the service. From a vegetarian perspective, the Paneer Lababdar was the pick of the lot. The Naans (especially the garlic ones) ought to be similar in terms of size though.

If I was to draw a list of the nicest, tastiest, most satisfying restaurants I've been to in the city, it would be a travesty to not have MM on it.

Mirch masala is pretty close to my house and has been a hot spot over the years since its opening for us... the place decoration is worth seeing if some one has not been there as they have movie stars images doing menial things like selling chana or driving a truck... they have a taxi in the place in which they keep the plates and other things which is very cool.... 

the food though heavy is extremely good.... the variety of the place is spot on and now the drinks that they serve are very cheap compared to other places makes going to this place and very relaxing experience... 

over all i visit this place often.... and then also i love going again and again... they have kebab platters which is our favorite to start with and the hyderabadi biryani is the best to finish with...

This diner is segregated in two parts, one is dedicated to North Indian food and the other one is to Chinese food. 

North Indian ‚Äì

When you enter the diner you will find yourself in the graphic world of Bollywood, from Amitabh Bachchan to Shahrukh Khan, from Nana Patekar to ‚ÄòDhak Dhak‚Äô girl Madhuri will welcome you. You will perceive that a real taxi is set at the corner as an ‚Äòeye candy‚Äô. 

We started out dinner party with Tandoori Murgh and Triranga Panner, dishes took quite a while to come on our platter. But we forgot to wail about the time just after the moment we tasted the ‚ÄòTandooris‚Äô. The chicken was tender and flavors were blasting out of it. And the paneer was perfectly tender and tempered with flavorful spices. As we relished our starters, we went for main course, in which we ordered Murgh Dum Biryani and Handi Gosht. The Biryani was perfectly cooked with its flavors. When you open the lid of the Handi the aromas will hit your nostrils. The gravy of the chicken compliments the rice very well. The boneless chicken melted in my mouth. 

On the terms of service they are a bit sloth, but the stewards are very welcoming. But as we know good food takes time. So I don‚Äôt complaint on that. But I do think they put overpriced tags on their dishes on the basis of quantity and quality.

Finally managed to pay my maiden visit to this restaurant even though i stay close-by and have been visiting Gariahat for all these years.And the good part is that i am not at all disappointed.I had this grouse since ages that this part of South Kolkata does not have much options in Indian cuisine .But now i can vouch for a fact that Mirch Masala not only saves the day but passes with flying colours.
Its location is a no-brainer at all.The joint has 2 sections-Indian and Chinese.Both are adjacent to each other.Interiors of the Indian section resemble a dhaba amidst a rural setting and has plenty of artifacts of the bygone era.I mean stuff like valve radio(remember the bulky ones before the advent of the transistor?), Amitabh's film posters- became nostalgic on seeing them, khatiyas etc. Seating was comfortable and the place was cosy. I paid a visit on a weekday afternoon during lunch hours. The place was almost empty when i went in.Understandable since lunch hour had just started.
I wanted to get the food packed thus settled down with a drink after ordering the same.Items which i tried out was the Gosht Dum biriyani. This item resembles more like the Hyderabadi biriyani and is served with raita. Mutton pieces were shredded and thus mixed well with the flavoured  saffron basmati rice.Mind you no egg or potato akin to the Kolkata version.Taste is different and decent enough.Quantity is huge and more than sufficient. The best part was that the biriyani was packed in an earthen pot sealed with dough.This ensured that the dish remained warm and the flavours/aroma remained intact.Kudos to them for this idea.Please do not commit the folly of  comparing the biriyani  with the Kolkata version as each dish is unique.The shikari murgh was a modified version of the  good old tandoori chicken sans the fiery red colour. But mind you this dish packs quite a punch in terms of flavour and aroma.Do try it out.Trust me you will not be disappointed. The murgh guldar comprised of a boneless chicken dish in a rich spicy yellow gravy. Tasty but nothing special. So was the kadha subzi. 
The let down was the tandoori roti and the plain naan. I found them to be prepared with atta and not maida. That is the good part.But they were anything but soft.It was  tough and chewy along the sides.Probably my mistake not to order the butter variants and the quintessential soft roomali roti. In fact the tough rotis reminded me of the stuff i used to have during my hostel days :) 
Prices are reasonable including that of drinks. Size of the helpings is decent enough to be shared by 2 people comfortably.No hassles in this aspect..Service is attentive.They do offer a discount of 10% for take-away orders. Do pay a visit .Trust me you will not be disappointed.

The first thing that hits you when you enter is the quirky decor,if you may call it that. Old school bollywood posters adorn the walls. I didn't get the "dhaba" kind of feel as some have mentioned .I also feel that they might have squeezed in that one extra table or two making it kinda claustrophobic or maybe its the low height that caused the feeling.

Anyways to the food,had the Fish Ajwain Tikka and Hara Murgh for appetisers. The fish was melt in your mouth and just the right amount of spice and flavour. Even if you are not a big fan of fish ,the Fish tikka is a must have.
The hara murgh was good but nothing that you won't find elsewhere.

Had Lasuni murgh and Kali dal for mains along with tandoori roti. The dal was great. Could taste that time and effort had really gone into making it. Lasuni murgh was great too.
All in all a satisfying meal. Would I come back? Yes.


My Ratings:
Food: 7.5/10

Been to this place only once yet loved it. This is located right next to gariahat pantaloons, this restaurant is a catch. But I had chinese here provided this has a dhaba look. Yet, they did justice to chinese as well.

The vegetable konjee is one of a kind. Friends and I stuck to our poison, beer.	
Vegetables fried and mixed with a reddish and delicious gravy. That is vegetable konjee for you!
 Then the main course consisted of Schezwan chicken and chicken egg wrapped rice.

The egg wrapped rice was delicious. The entire rice is stuffed under the blanket of an omelette. It tastes really good. And the schezwan chicken was awesome. I liked the standard of food that they maintain here.

Had a lovely afternoon lunch here.
Definitely coming back for more.

Happy eating guys,
Cheers! :)

I don't know why i keep forgetting to write reviews of places that i have known for years. This too is one such place which i feel was kolkata's first ever themed restaurant . That too one that took  its theme seriously . 

The dhaba style interiors in earthy tones and the lanterns and the thalis with the taxi in the restaurant. ( thats how they opened ) but i haven't gone here in a long time. Even as a teenager i felt that they were decent but not exceptional . Located right behind garijhat pantaloons the location is a big plus for this place and they  do full justice to it . 

But i feel when a dhaba theme restaurant resorts to selling Chinese.... i feel they don't have faith in their product. 

I least i don't find anything exceptional about the place. Have been here several times in the early years but don't any more.

We (me and my boyfriend) were in a search of restaurant which serves both Indian and Chinese cuisines, since he loves chinese and me indian. Whatever, we chose to go to Mirch Masala on a Sunday afternoon, and finally got in there. However, it was the Chinese one, and they informed us that there are actually two restaurants side by side which offer different cuisines. Thus, I had no other way. So, we just planned to have cocktail with starters. We tried out PINA COLADA & SCREW DRIVER, both were superb especially the pina colada. And one must try out FISH PARSLEY, CHICKEN KONJEE was also good enough. But I think amount of food is less compared to price.

This is a restaurant i would love to visit over and over again. firstly, the location is at the heart of gariahat. when the first time you enter, you will feel the ambiance of desi bollywood which took me to away. foods are yummm... and must try is the cheese naan. here, everything is perfect in its place. even the waiters are also very friendly and well mannered. it is a vry good north indian place so if you really want to go on a different exprience with great food, its a perfect place.

I went with my family during Durga puja marketing in this restaurant with my family. Its located just behind the Gariahat Pantaloons a very prominent place I must say. We ordered  for Two hyderabadi biriyanis and one dum biriyani and boondi raita. Hyderabadi biriyanis were very good with a nice blend of spices and the dum biriyani was average.I found the the spices pretty strong (its not rich...the flavours are very strong). The waiters are polite but they are very slow to take orders and serve and also lack knowledge about the menu. Another problem i came through is pretty unique though...the seats are made of wood and ropes and some other natural materials maybe this is due to maintainence problem or some other reason the seats are full of bed bugs which created a havoc manifestations to my wife...which took away the joy of the food. I request the authority to please look into the matter because this is serious

Kolkata has found a new craze in theme based restaurants and mirch masala happens to be a veteran in the category. Personally am not a big fan of such places as here the gimmick and the glitter are given more importance and the food takes a backseat. However mirch masala pleases you with their ambience and overwhelms you with their food. 

Located right beside gariahat pantaloons the place has its own loyal following and come on a weekend you should prepare yourself for a long waiting time for a table. But the moment you enter the decor gets the better of you. Dressed as a roadside dhaba the restaurant is complete with gadda on cement shelves as seating areas and a half cut taxi jutting out of the wall doubling as a cabinet. The bright menu card and the brass cutlery add to the charm but the cheeky bollywood wall painting (anil kapoor as sabjiwaala and many more) and the witty one liners on the wall take the cake. 

Coming to the food which is essentially north indian (the chinese section is next doors) what they serve is pretty good. My favourites there has to be the tawa fish, the murgh guldaar and the kadhai murgh. Add a cheese naan to it and everthing tastes better. But the best dish they serve has to be the murgh hyderabadi biriyani. Complete with a raita it certainly is my go to dish there. On being treated to a biriyani at the drop of a hat I have grown a certain apathy to it but the biriyani here is refreshing and has a unique flavour found here only. I wouldn't say its the best biriyani but if you want something "hatke" then am sure you won't be disappointed. 

Overall one of the better places to eat in kolkata, come in a big group and enjoy the hustle bustle of mirch masala. I deducted a point because I had called on their number five times during the afternoon for a reservation the last time I went there and everytime the phone went unanswered which I find uncalled for a place of such caliber.

Been there a few times. The ambience is good. Rates aren't sky high as well. The taste is pretty good too. I personally feel that the Indian restaurant is better than it's Chinese counter part. If you are looking for a decent place for family dinner, or a get together with your friends, this place could well be on your list.

A fantastic restaurant by its sheer ambiance. The place has been decorated to make you feel like you are in a roadside dhaba with all bollywood stars staring at you. The food is just fab and the most surprising part is the pinch on the pocket is not that great. Definitely try the dum biriyani there

My friends and family went there this Nabami. Since most of us wanted to have Chinese we chose the Chinese section. After reading the great reviews here we were horribly disappointed in the end. The Starter was served in neat 3 minutes which was cold and hard. The main course was served post that. The quantity was good for one , but served cold. 
Since it was during the Puja the menu was changed with few items to choose from which is perfectly ok but never expected to have cold food. It is absolutely unexpected from a restaurant of this caliber to provide the service of the sort we received here even though it is Puja. 
The staff were courteous with mistakes like not refilling the glass with water. 
A 2 pointer from my end.

Today had worst experience in Mirch Masala, Gariahat.....Me and my husband visited the place....during the payment..the manager refused to accept Rs. 500 note with some weird reason best known to him....he behaved very badly with us.... the most insulting moment was when we were leaving the manager Mr. PARTHO BANIK.....told "don't visit the place next time with fake notes".... these really should be slapped....few days ago similar incident happened there..when a lady customer complained about misbehaviour of the manager and waiter of the restaurant...lodged a complaint with police....and ultimately the cops taught them a lesson....BEWARE OF THIS PLACE....

This place is behind pantaloons Gariahat.. I was a frequent visitor during my school days .. Food is awesome .. Specially the kebabs n fish items.. Only prob is the quantity which is pretty less.. Staff is nice and courteous .. Order takes pretty long to reach on table .. People planning to visit on weekends should book their table or go early else they will have to wait in a pretty long queue ..

a must drop in, if you are looking for some good Indian food. ... as starters, they offer a wide range of kababs, both veg and non.veg.  
if you want veg, then baby corn kabab is the best option for you, although the non.vegetarians will have multiple choices... :) chicken tandoori mumtaz, chiken hariyali and mutton boti are just melt in mouth...
for the main course, you can try out cheese nun, and forget about the extra calories that u'll gain :)
along with that, ghosth biriyani, handi ghosth will make it just perfect. :)
have a sip of chilled beer, and enjoy your food.
and take a look around, u'll see abhishek bachchan selling mungfali (peanuts), prriyanka chopra in a paan-stall, and hritik roshan, sunny deol, kajol and all others joining you while u have you meal :) !!!!!!!!

Mirch Masala is my mother's favourite place. So for her birthday or my parent's anniversary we mostly visit this restaurant.

The interior and the ambiance of this place is definitely unique and is the first of its type in Kolkata. The ambassador taxi in front of the entrance immediately catches your attention. They even serve the food in brass plates and bowls and glasses. The servers wear red uniforms which adds to the feeling of a Dhaba out of a Bollywood set. The servers are always cordial and ever ready to help you with proper suggestions.

Now coming to the food. I always start my gastronomic journey here with a Masala Chanch. I highly recommend. My mother loves the Dahi Kebab served here. For me I like the Ajwani Fish Kebab and the Lasuni Chicken Kebab and mostly order them. I have always found the Kebabs to be moist and the fish/chicken to be fresh. But most importantly I really like their green chutney. It has the correct amount of zing to it. As far as I am concerned the green chutney can make or break the Kebabs. For the main course, I like the combination of the sweet Kashmiri Kulcha with the spicy Kadhai Murg. I am particularly fond of the dry fruit stuffed Kashmiri Kulcha and can even have it without any side dish. I also like their Achari Murg and my mother is in love with their Hyderabadi Biriyani. The proportions are sufficient. I also highly recommend their Gulab Jamuns. I always keep space for atleast one of their Gulab Jamuns. I sometimes even pack the main course if I feel that I wont be able to have the Gulab Jamun at the end if I finish the main course.

The one negative point about this place is that the service tends to be on the slower side. But sometimes the food makes the waiting worthwhile.

This is one of my favourite restaurants in the city for various reasons. I have been dining here since the last 10 or 11 years, even before it had a liquor license. One thing that has not changed is the food quality and serving size. 

The restaurant is located in the lane adjacent to Gariahat Pantaloons. The ambiance is a Dhaba themed interiors with quirky Bollywood one liners and posters. The interiors are quite interesting with two levels. The lower section has a well stocked bar and the upper section is more of a family seating area. 

The Food : This is why we go any restaurant in the first place. They have few items which has made me revisit this place since my school days atleast 50-60 times. :) My favourite of the lot is the Shikari Murgh. It looks pretty much like Tandoori chicken, but the preparation is quite different and tastes too good. This goes great with a drink or two. The next item is the Tawa Fish. Some of my friends dont like it since it is too spicy but again this is one of my favourite Indian fish items that I like to go back for. The ajwain fish kebab is also pretty nice. Succulent fish kebabs with a hint of ajwain. You could also try out the Chicken TIkka Mumtaz or the Lasuni Murgh tikka. More or less all the appetizers are worth a try. In case you want to try a bit of everything, I would suggest the Non Veg Kebab Platter but make sure at least 3 people are sharing it. 

For main course I usually prefer the Achari Murgh with Butter Naan/Butter Tandoori Roti. The Gosht Biryani is also pretty good, but please do not compare with Arsalan :) 

Mostly I have had Indian Appetizers here as I often go here to drink with my friends since alcohol prices are very very decent for a restaurant like Mirch Masala situated at a posh locale like Gariahat. 

Service: Fortunately I have always received quick service. The waiters know me as Im a regular here, so I always get top notch service even in peak hours :) 

As I mentioned earlier that this is one of my favourite restaurants fit for a drinking session with friends or even a proper dinner with family. It is easy on the pocket and returns full value for money. But I have to deduct marks for the dirty washroom and also finding a parking space could be an issue sometimes. 

A meal for two would cost around Rs800 + tax

It's a place that I love to visit...not jst for its food..but for d ambience too.

It has maintained the ambience and d√©cor for a while..but as they say it...the wine is more gripping as it ages.
The food is quite good compared to the cost. North Indian, especially mughlai dishes are just mouth-watering including the Biriyani (which comes with a surprise as the mutton pieces are unlike conventional mughlai restaurants in Kolkata). The added advantage is, even though its a complete family restaurant, it serves all kinds of alcohol (includes a bar-counter as well).
The D√©cor is very Indian yet quite charming n simple.
Only issue is that being adjacent to the garihat pantallons, pretty hard to find a table during the lunch & dinner hours ( it doesn't serve during the early evening).

Visit recommended!!

Inside bollywood theme is ODD, I think. A broken taxi welcomes you when you enter the restaurant. But foods quality and quantity is good. 
But one thing I experienced here is totally bad. we enter here at 2.30 pm for lunch. After ordering the waiter said that you have to order in full now, because our kitchen will be closed at 3 pm.No further order will be taken even Rotis will be not available.You have to order total Rotis needed in advance,though it become tasteless.
If they closed at 3 pm strictly, then they must closed their door  one hour before.Service is very slow.

if u visit this restaurant u will get a feeling of visting in a dhaba. The interior of this restaurant is like a dhaba style. ambiance is good not excellent, but service is not too good. Its a bit slow. Drinks are very reasonable and chicekn dum biriyani is good & all the kebabs are good. A nice place to visit or to spend time with friends with drinks & kebabs.. & prices are very reasonable.. anyway three & half stars from me..

When a person wants to enjoy food and realized that it wasn't worth trying. Prawns were overcooked. Biriyani garnished with coriander leaves is was awful! Other dishes just came to the limit of saying Ok.

Some two years ago, I had been to the Chinese section of Mirch Masala a good number of times in a short span. Somehow every meet with friends ended up being held there. It is a comfortable place to eat out and the dishes are good value for money.  If you want to have drinks, then Chicken Congee is a good starter to go with. The first floor is always a favourite with us.

The Indian Section - I have been there only once and it is a must visit simply for the decor of the place. A novel idea indeed - who would have thought of having tandoori roti with palak paneer in a roadside dhaba at a stone's throw away from Gariahat Pantaloons. I don't exactly recall how the food was - overall good but it was greasy for sure!

Loved the food here.. Especially the fish items.. Hospitality is special.. A bit on the expensive side.. Around 1200 bucks for a couple.. But good experience.

Mirch Masala Restaurant & Bar.. It is located in Gariahat.. Near the newly opened Park Plaza Hotel in the lane next to Pantaloons. Have been going to this place since a long time.. As a kid I used to love the quirky interiors, the half hanging taxi, the graffiti on the wall with the  Bollywood dialogues like "Mere Pass Maa Hai !". It was fun.. Much has not changed since..
Coming to the food, I have tasted almost every Vegetarian item on its menu and all tastes good, but what stands out is their Paneer Labardar, Methi Malai Makai and Dal Makhani along with the Cheese Naan and the Onion Chili Kulcha. The service is good and the prices are very reasonable.  Three and half stars from me.. Do try it :)

Mirchi masala restaurant is situated at 49/2 gariahat road. The ambience of the place is quirky and describes the city well. 

Pros : 
1) We ordered the hara bhara kabab and achari panner tikka which was good . 
2) The main course had panner labadar, dal makhani , naan and tandoori roti all of which was an average affair. 
3)The staff was polite and as mentioned the ambience was quite different. 

Cons :
1)The service is very slow .
2)The staff is not well informed .
3)The food taste average I only tried vegetarian so no idea about non-veg.

Overall mirchi Masala is a nice place to try . I would rate it a 3.5.

This restaurant serves pretty average Indian food. The decor is the highlight of the place, with its focus on old Hindi films. However, the quality of the food does not justify repeated visits to the place.

Ordered Tandoori Rotis and the Handi Gosht there. The roti was good, but the Handi Gosht was less than spectacular, with small pieces and too much oil. Also ordered an Adrak Nimbu Pani and the Sweet Lassi, both of which were bad - almost no ginger in the Nimbu Pani and too much water in the Lassi.

The service is quick and the waiters make sensible recommendations, but the food was disappointing. Not a place you'd like to visit more than once.

I just went to the Mirch Masala chinese cuisine outlet yesterday when I was visiting my parents' home in Kolkata. This is the place which had lot of memories as we used to visit this place before our marriage when it used to be a little snacks bar (forgot the name). 

Anyways, we ordered the starters and food which were simply awesome and I would recommend all Kolkatans to please try out their new chinese stuff. 

The staff is pretty courteous and know the menu well. I thoroughly enjoyed the food and left with a big smile on my face. So did my wife and parents.

Heard a lot of this place- specially the ambience. So we finally decided to go for lunch there. 
It was a Monday afternoon and when we entered, the place was absolutely empty. 
Personally I thought the ambience was mediocre. Kolkata has better places now. 

We ordered for tandoori aalu, methi corn, masala and onion kulcha. 
The tandoori aalu was not so great, there're other places serving better.
The methi corn lacked salt & wasn't much palatable. However, the onion kulcha was killer. 

The staffs were polite but the service was slow. 

And, the bathroom wasn't clean as well. 
So, there goes a 2.5 from my side.

A make believe roadside Dhaba tucked in just beside Pantaloons gariahat. It's the place to be if you want to have a round of beer with a delectable choice of  Tandoor platter. Have been going to this place for some years now. Cost wise I would say it is one of the cheaper places to enjoy a drink with a good familiar ambience and courteous staff. The Shikari Murg here is a must have along with the tasty malai kebab. You can come with your family too as there is plenty of place to enjoy your privacy. Highly recommended..

Food is good. ambience is nice, its give u old Bollywood feel. Lighting is quite dim where u cannot see the food properly and its colour. Ordered tandoori chicken, it should have been little more red in colour and dry. It was not properly cooked. Murgh zafrani and butter naan was quite good. And during pujas the menu is very short and expensive. Visit after puja for more variety and save money.

This place is a decent one to take your family, including parents and kids. Waiting can be an issue on weekends. But the interior is done up with recycled oldies, like the grandpa clok, an over used guitar, some sigdis, hand pumps etc, much needed for the urban kids who have missed the trips to the country side. The walls have scenes from the Bollywood movies , sometimes mixed up, probably to spice up the mind or due to the poetic licence of the painter who did the job. The food is good for a veggie. Not too spicy, but hot and served as promised. The waiters are knowledgable and offer tips to if asked. Fairly adequate fare available to suite all palates. Sweet dish is limited. I rate it a very good place and visit it quite frequently.

The first thing that strikes you once you enter this restaurant is the MAD DECOR. 
The theme here is that of 70's Bollywood with famous Hindi dialogues written everywhere. A taxi welcomes you which is odd, and I was surprised the first time. You start thinking whether its a restaurant or something else. 

The food here is different. I recommend " roti ki tokri " and " miley juley kebabs ". A platter of assorted kebabs and rotis will delight you. Even regular dishes like biryanis are made differently here. Must visit for foodies more for the ambiance, and also for the food.

Ambiance: 5/5
Food: 3.5/5

I've been to this place twice. We took Chinese dish there. The pan-fried noodles with gravy was marvelous. The food price is reasonable. Alcoholic beverages are not too expensive. The place is quiet. I loved the reddish black Chinese theme. Although, the place mostly remains dark, you will surely enjoy it if you are with someone to talk with for hours. The service is quite good. The best thing about this restaurant is its familiarizing atmosphere - so you will never feel uncomfortable at any moment. I prefer Mirch Masala as ideal for eating in summer afternoons.

I highly recommend this one!

Well I have always had a pleasant experience here no complains really. To start off the ambiance is done quite nicely and is impressive. The menu is not bad but I guess a little less choice of dishes. Their tandoori section is nice and should be tried for sure. The taste good and so is the quantity of food offered. Their Kebabs are nice along with their dum biriyani.¬†
The staff is helpful and cheerful. The pricing I would say is a bit high if you compare with the dhabas but quite ok compared to other fine dining restaurants. 
My rating would be 3.5 since the food is good but not something extraordinary.

If there is one place in south Kolkata where food, service and ambience all add up to a special experience - then it is Mirch Masala! Right from the "rustic road-side dhaba" appearance magnified by its Bollywood kitsch dialogues and decor (even the iconic half-taxi that acts as a side-board for dishes and cutlery) to the warm tasty food; its highly professional yet warm service staff who remember your favorite poison, your daughter's preference of non-spicy food, your family members to the perfect suggestions they make - Mirch Masala has always tried to rise above the ordinary! Whether its a late lunch in the afternoon with friends, a celebration with the family or a quiet romantic dinner with the special one in your life, Mirch Masala is the place to be. Although one may have to wait a little for tables but even then its never boring with Bollywood around!

Have you ever dined in a dhaba located on the highway? Well, never mind if you haven't got a chance to dig into the mouthwatering food of a roadside dhaba. You can find a similar ambience and enjoy truly delectable north Indian and Mughlai dishes at Mirch Masala Restaurant & Bar. The quirky ambience of Mirch Masala, located at Gariahat Road truly makes it a perfect dining hub. 

Gariahat, with so many apparel and bric-a-brac shops, is a shopper's paradise. And I, being a perfect shopaholic, am often seen on the streets, bargaining and stuffing my bags with good buys. Just a few months back I got a chance to eat at Mirch Masala. Tired after our shopping spree, my friend and I entered this restaurant for some refreshments. But, its typical dhaba decor enhanced by colorful posters had its magical effect on us and we decided to have our luncheon here. 

When you are sitting in a dhaba or rather when you get a feel of sitting in a dhaba, then it is always nice to dig in to some delectable north Indian dishes. We ordered some Hara Lasuni Naan, Kashmiri Kuchcha, Subzi Dum Biryani, Tandoori Murgh and Murgh Lasuni. After this sumptuous meal, we made sure we had a glassful of Sweet Lassi (served at almost every highway dhaba). My friend insisted on having some Kesariya Jalebis, which were just awesome!

I must say that their service was indeed praiseworthy. On entering the restaurant we were greeted by their friendly staff who showed us to our table. The waiters were prompt and efficient. Food was served to us hot and fresh in metal bowls and plates. Who would believe that one could get the feel of a roadside dhaba on bustling Gariahat Road! Mirch Masala has a separate bar for those who would prefer having hard drinks along with their sumptuous delicacies. Just drop in here next time when you are on Gariahat Road!

This is one of the restaurants which I visit very often and love it to the same extent every time. The food is great, the highway dhaba-like environment is unique and comfortable. Only the service is a bit slow, but it gets compensated later (when your food is served with a pleasing smile, and of course when you start eating).

My favorites are Shikari Murgh as starters, Murgh Mirch Masala Pulao and Murgh Methi Malai in the main course. All these are very less spicy, so if you don't like sweetish dishes go for Biryani or Cheese naan with Kadhai Gosht. These tastes equally great. Nothing special about the desserts, but you can try the Kheer. 

Great food, nice ambiance and reasonable pricing makes Mirch Masala a great place to visit again and again.

In Kolkata, it is difficult to find North Indian fare that isn't, well, palatable. So I wouldn't review the food in details. But there is this one thing which I would like to mention. We went in for a late lunch and ordered Mutton Biriyani among other things. What they served in the name of Biriyani disappointed me a lot. It was plain mutton curry layered with some plain rice with some cashew nuts thrown about. That it was a mutton curry was evident from the fact that there were 5-6 small  boneless pieces of mutton in a plate of Biriyani. I hope the authorities are listening!!

Rest of the meal was standard North Indian food.

I visited Mirch Masala with my family recently for dinner. It was a very enjoyable experience for us. The food was great. The service was great and the ambiance was great. We ordered Kadhai Mushrooms, Murgh Malai Kebabs, Mutton Seekh Kebab and Tandoori Prawns for starters. Apart from the prawns, which were a bit of a turn off because they weren't de-shelled, everything else was melt-in-your mouth delicious! We ordered a Ginger Lemon Salt Soda which was a nice innovation and added to the meal. The main course was Butter Naans, Paneer Makhani and Kadhai Mugh, all of which tasted excellent. 

I highly recommend this restaurant and would definitely visit again.

Mirch Masala had deteriorated in its quality of food. Still you can be there if you want your food along with your drinks - and don't really mind how it taste! Otherwise I would stay away from this place. Only good thing about this place now is its decor.

Worst of the lot was 'murgh dum biryani' at this place. It's blasphemy in the name of biryani - felt like some novice cook was taking some cooking lesson there and failed drastically. 'Murgh lasuni' was very average, and 'bad' considering that you are paying so much. I found all the gravy dishes too spicy.
Food you can still try out and were okay was - 'Dal kali' and 'Murgh makhani' and we had these with 'Roti ki tokri' (which was 7 assorted indian breads and were cut in halves).

Overall a pretty bad experience dining at this place lately, it was good 'once upon a time' and now its just a watering hole with a dim shadow of its past.

During our recent trip to Kolkata, as ordained by my son & daughter (young adults) I was hard pressed to locate a North Indian/Chinese eatery for lunch around Gariahat. We chose Mirch Masala for the proximity and opted for its Chinese section. The ambiance was highly cliched...from flying dragons to laughing Buddhas to Feng Shui tidbits! 

We ordered one portion each of baby corn-mushroom as starter (Rs.175.00), chicken manchow soup (Rs.95.00), chicken fried rice (Rs.135.00), veg hakka noodles (Rs.115.00), exotic veg (Rs.135.00) and Youm bang chicken (Rs.170.00). The names may sound quite exotic and enthralling but all dishes are cooked in la Calcutta Chinese style, a mongrel cuisine developed and devoured over the years in that part of the country.

Considering Gariahat a prime commercial locality, Mirch Masala had a steady local clientele for its pocket-friendly pricing strategy.

The decor of the place is quirky and has a fun feel to it. The cusine lives up to its name and has got lots of Mirch and Masala ! Their food is decent ... not great but average. The Assorted Kebabs are decent and I enjoy the Roti ki Tokri with the assorted roti's if you have 4-5 people in your group. The dal is quite nice too. I find the gravy dishes too spicy for my taste but my firends who like spicy food find them quite enjoyable.If you like the north indian dhaba type food its nice a nice enough place. 2.5 stars from me.

The restaurant basically has a dhaba-theme, which consists of bollywood posters from 80s and 90s, and don't forget the taxi emerging out from a wall!

Dhaba like atmosphere, dhaba like food (but not so tasty or fresh), but rates of a upmarket Restaurant. First time I went there it was out of choice but my later visits (three, if I remember correctly) were forced. Surprisingly every time I ate there I was unwell next day. 

BTW - the food and service in their Banquets on 4th floor is even more terrible. Skip any invitation to this place for your own sake.

The entrance will welcome with posters of bollywood stars and especially i like the taxi when u climb up the stairs. Service is also pleasant this place resembles as a punjabi garage. If i recall correctly, there was posters of sharukh khan selling beetle leaf and other stars...I could hardly remember. Really again a great suggestion for having food here for all folks. A very nice place to visit once a month. Pricing is also quite reasonable. I really loved this place.

A theme restaurant with a look of roadside dhaba. The first thing that will strike you is the decor and the way they have maintained the look. There are posters of Hindi movies of the 80's and 90's. The seats are made of jute to resemble the cots present in Dhabas. The cutlery is mostly of steel and bell-metal. Coming to food, its just mind blowing. One of the best places to have Indian and tandoor items. The best item according to me is the 'Ajwaini fish'. Impossible to describe the taste in words. The first time we ordered and had it, we repeated it thrice afterwards. It's situated just alongside the Pantaloons at Gariahat. 4/5 for me !

This is where we usually end up from work on a saturday afternoon. Why? its close to work, food and booze is decent. Once you get past the hanging cab and go down the dimly lit stairs to the bar area downstairs everything else happens on AUTO mode since the waiters know us by now. First the vodka shots downed with beer. Shikari Aloo and Chatapata mushrooms for starters is a must . The main course we get is pretty basic. naans, jeera rice,salads, dal, thats it.

Its  a decent joint, try it

The decor resembles that of a Dhaba with welcoming interiors. The front-half of an old HM ambassador taxi has been literally placed inside the restaurant which may take you aback (in a good way) if you are visiting he first time. 

Even though it's over-crowded on the weekends, this is a must-visit restaurant. 
Great selections available from the menu, especially for non-veg lovers.
The bar-menu is slightly heavier on the pockets, but the food quality, the quantity & service are just awesome. 
The service can be a little slow on the weekends.

Considering the place it is located and the quality of food served the rate is on the higher side. The menu shows moth-watering varieties but the taste is lot to be desired for.

The chinese resturants all over Calcutta offers a more Indian flavour to the food considering this the chinese csine offered here neither has the Indianised chinese flavour nor it has the original chinese flavour. I cannot say even that it is somewhere in - between because the taste is far from good. The sauces they use to prepare the cusines lacks quality. On top of it thay use a lot of Monosodium Glutamate to try and make over the taste gap.

Overall experience - pathetic.

A restaurant thats as popular for its decor as it is for its cuisine. The kitschy decor adds to the entire dining experience. You'll feel like you are in a glamorous dhaba what with the filmy posters, harmonium and rickshaw adding to the kitsch-mix. The food is classic, Indian khana, rich in taste and aroma. Start with juicy kebabs and then move on to Kofta Lajawaab, Murgh Makhani or Mutton Rogan Josh. End with warm Gulab Jamuns and ice cream or crunchy, syrupy Kesri Jalebi.
