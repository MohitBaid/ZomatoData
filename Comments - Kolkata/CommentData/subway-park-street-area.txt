Was once a regular here. Their sub of the day offers were really good and helpful for daily eaters like me. However, the variety isnt there, which makes dining rather monotonous.

Visited Subway on the day they were having their buy 2 pay 1 offer. What appealed to me the most was their fast service. Despite the mad rush they were quick in preparing both the the order and the bill. Hats off to that. 
Chicken Tandoori & Chicken Seekh were prepared perfectly with the perfect amount of meat & sauces. Loved every bit.

I have often visited this outlet in Parkstreet during my school days and each and every time they have managed to satisfy me. The subs they serve are truely feeling and very tasty also. You have the option of customising your order and therefore you can go with healthy choices. The different subs i have tried are 
Chicken slice:-very filling
Chicken seekh- it was also big and filling although what i find is they give too less amount of chicken and veggies consist almost 80% of the subs. It is a cold sub.
Chicken egg and cheese- this one also consisted very thin slice of chicken but otherwise served piping hot and tasted very good.
Egg and cheese- this one is my top favourite. With medium spicy sauce it tastes heavenly. They give good amount of cheese and the egg is prepared very well.
The subs taste best with cold drinks though. 
The only con i find is too loud music during evening times which are sometimes disturbing at the point of noise. I hope they change their music preferences. Overall, it is a very good joint and staffs are also very polite. We even get free cookie by taking surveys. Will surely keep visiting.

I have mostly ordered from this place via Swiggy. So delivery time and order placement has been flawless, but what impressed me most is the qualify of food and the variety. Be it the type of bread or the sauces and veggies, the proportions are adequate.

Some of the must-have are the Italian BMT, chicken tandoori, chicken teriyaki and tuna preparations

I like going to subway and visited this outlet for the first time and for the first time I didnt enjoy my meal at subway. The staff were kids and were too much casual. They were just busy talking and giggling among themselves. They gave 2 chicken stripes in the subwraps instead of 3. They were just looking at each other and continued smiling which irritated me a bit.

Visited today. Staff specially counter staff a big let down. No one to explain the menu. Rude. Learn from Mac d or KFC. Next the sub bread is sub standard. Non veg is definitely not fresh if not stale. Pure wastage of money in search of healthy food option. Bread toast and omlette is healthier than food of this outlet.

For the first time I tried this outlet of Subway. I got a bit disappointed. I ordered a chicken roasted sub through swiggy. Delivery was delayed. More over the usual taste was lacking. The mayonnaise sauce I opted for was lacking too.. But the veggies were fresh.. 
Honestly I feel Subway z a bit overpriced n overrated too....

Located quite close to the park street metro station this outlet serves quality subs. The seating is limited but one always finds an empty table.
The service is pretty good. Coming to the food, the Chicken tikka , the Chicken tandoori and the Chicken teriyaki subs are downright awesome. The Chicken seekh subwrap is also good.
This place is definitely a must visit. I am myself looking forward to my next visit.

Secondly, staff:  courteous and efficient 
Thirdly , decor: nothing special and the framed pictures of tomatoes and onions were kind of funny
Fourth,  ambience: one direction songs on speaker and bollywood videos playing in the tv on mute was funny 
And now , the food, most imp for last: nice , fresh and in sumptuous quantity. Although next time i would try for more sauces and less veggies

If your hungry and your low on cash this is the place to go.
Subway has different varieties of subs to offer, salad, cookies. But my all time favourite is the ham, egg and cheese sub along with coffee and a packet of chips. 
You can even order in. They make the sub according to your preference so no complaints on the taste front.
Always Recommend.

The subs are just as good as any other joint, but the seating arrangement is a bit awkward. It is also too glamourless. The employees were having a good time laughing among themselves, just a tad bit more loudly than would have been ideal for enjoying a good sub. The breads were fortunately available.

What more to say about Subway?
One of my best subs I had till date. This always turns out to be the best option for quick bites. I had tried many of their subs and Chicken Tikka and Italian BBT turns to be my favorite. Made with fresh oven baked breads and the filling is generous with fresh lettuce,tomatoes,olives,bell pepper,cheese and succulent meat. The sauce they add accentuates the sub much more,and the best part is you can customize your sub!
So Man what are you waiting for? Go give it a shot!!

Only one line to say for this outlet - I had the best sub till date!
Ordered one italian BMT sub with honey oats bread, all the veggies no chesse and no different sauces. Kept it low calorie with just one sauce honey mustard sauce and a little bit of salt and pepper. Trust me it was the best sub i ever had at any subway outlet. The bread was fresh and warm as it was baked there only. Fresh vegetables. Lettuce was crunchy which proved its freshness. Olives and jalapenoes were fresh as well. If someone fears of calories visit subway and customize your sub with all veggies with only a little sauce.
Their sub won my heart. Going to visit this outlet again and again and again.

When the heat and hostel blues make you hit the rock bottom, always trust good, healthy food to pep you up. Subway has been my favourite for a very long time. I have tried everything on their menu but the chicken ham sub, roasted chicken sub and Italian BMT are my favourite. I love their salad bowls as well and the double chocolate cookie is a heavenly. 
I ordered the chicken ham sub and it was delivered to me in a protective packaging and tasted fresh. The sauces, Honey Mustard, Mint Mayo, Mayonnaise and sweet onion blended well together and the olives and pickles added the zing. Had a sumptuous dinner.

This is my most visited Subway outlet till date. However, with each and every visit (which isn't too often), there's always a slight change in the way they prepare the subs. In my recent visits, the service was very different than the previous ones as there was a huge difference in the proportion of the fillings inside the subs. They were well stuffed and freshly made just as Subway promises us. Needless to say, I was pretty impressed. 
Coming to some of the staple choices which are usually tuna or B.M.T subs, I think I had misjudged the roast chicken sub for its presence of white meat, which is not of my favourites. Yet, the roast chicken sub has really impressed with its taste, although I was pretty unsure about the 'roast' bit while the guy behind the counter was handling some roasted portions of it. The rest was made according to whatever was asked. 
While the place is usually unoccupied with too many people around, the staff is cordial and helpful. 

P.S: The choice of music and the tv channels are really disturbing as they sound funny and don't go well together.

Sunday afternoon at work and we were famished. At around 3, we decided to order from Subway Park St. and accordingly placed our order through Swiggy. There were three of us and we ordered two Italian BMT subs and one Subway Club sub. The subs were extremely good, toasted to as is exactly required, loaded with veggies and sauces. The vegetables were crunchy and the meat succulent. Overall a great experience. Loved it.

Place : very decent , few seats are available ,almost vacant all the time cz their take away order is more ..
Staff : very vivacious , courteous.. as I first time visited there so I hadn't much knowledge abt toppings and sauce , they guided me well.. 
Best part: no xtra charge on topping and sauce
Mon to sun we can get discount on their selected items 
Food: now the main part is coming ,I ordered there chicken teyarki kabab puff and chicken tandoori kabab puff , its consist of full of lettuce , jalapenos , capsicum , cucumber , onion, tomato, olive , cheese , meyonese, southwest sauce, cream as ur choice . .

I ordered for a chicken turkey sub for delivery to my office from the zomato app, for which they took almost 1 hr to deliver. What was disappointing was to find out that the food delivered was cold, maybe straight out of fridge. The "eat fresh" factor was missing. No subway ever again for me for sure.

The outlet is very spacious for a fast food chain. I had a Paneer Tikka Sub loaded with veggies, wrapped neatly between the soft beds of the bread. Rs160 seems a bit pricey for a 6inch sub but then it carries the intrinsic value of one of the most popular food chain across the globe.
P.S. The fresh smell of the bread baking is just so refreshing!

Nothing much to review! The formalisation and standardisation of Subway is good and hence all products taste same! An onion here would taste the same elsewhere in the city! However the make and quantity of sauce is of the personal sandwich experts (as the Subway CEO calls them)! Here it is good and you can ask them for more!

My fav is Chicken breast and Tuna! Well that is the only sandwich (in non-veg) which has least of sodium, highest of protein, decent calories and amazing taste!!

** Location = At the Park Mansion Park Street.

**Brief = A spring afternoon with hunger in  stomach two people opted to have some submarine sandwiches.

** Ambiance = Decent ambiance with seating available upstairs.

** Things tried = Sub of the day was Tuna and the lady with me hated to have that so we chose roasted Chicken Sub(Footlong) and Chicken Tikka Sub normal, also tried their chicken tikka salad along with soft beverages.

I have always been a hardcore supporter of subway as they are providing superbly fresh made tasty subs with tasty sauce to choose from. We had nice time enjoying the food as we opted to sit upstairs and the place was very much less populated at that time.

**Recommended = Roasted Chicken Sub always my favorite and goes perfect with the white italian bread, do try that combo.

** Purse Check = Our Bill came around Rs.750/-.

**Overall = Nice place and will be going back for more. Cheers!

I order from this very outlet through swiggy, and get amazing service. Today unfortunately swiggy delivery executives being busy, i ordered through zomato.
Delivery time for a location in the next lane came 90 minutes from time of delivery. I could have caught a live chicken from farm and prepared a subway myself if i had the luxury of waiting that long. Better still i would have myself walked to the store knowing that they wont keep me standing for 90 mins and serve quicker.
I asked the live chat for cancellation options, they kept saying- its going to be delivered in 10mins. 10min stretched to 90 mins and what i received was not what i had ordered.
Being at work, i prefer my subs without onion. Hence i dont tick onion/red onion for the veggies. However the pic shows generous amount of onions stuffed in the sub.
If you wont follow specification then dont ask for it. How do you do it totally right in the orders from swiggy on other days?
Disappointing. Lesson learnt- will not order online through zomato. 
Could be logistic issues or whatever but the same outlet delivered amazing sub on time yesterday through swiggy (pic attached). So may be zomato customers don't have enough mind share of the restaurant.
Whatever the reason, it was the customer, precisely me who had to wait 90 mins for a sub which comes in 30mins through Swiggy, its me who had to eat a sub filled with onions inspite of not checking onions in the veggies option.
Lesson learnt. Never gonna order again.

So it was my first time when I ate veg in Subway ( because all my vegetarian friends said that Subway is ghaas foos ). I ate the aloo Patti sub (6 inch ) . It was good enough and worth . The best part about Subway is that everything is customisable (one day subway may even offer different types of packaging and trays) ,but it actually confuses me and I end up making it a disaster thats why today I just said ditto to what my frnds ordered. Be careful with the various types of sauses because they determine the taste alot . Now the service was good and the staffs treated us very well . However the place is very small for large gathering s( don't go if u r more than 4 or max 5 and want to spent time talking because there is not much space .

We ordered Chicken Tandoori sub which was the Sub of the day, Chicken Teriyaki sub and chicken strips subwrap. We chose mayonnaise and BBQ sauce with go with the subs. Besides that, ample amount of veggies were added too. The staffs were friendly and service efficient. Coming to the taste, I loved the sub. The veggies along with the sauces went really well. Ample amount of chicken pieces were there. Our only complaint was that they didn't add red chilli sauce in the subwrap even after mentioning it. Our bill came upto 405/- which is pretty cheap.

A tiny entrance.  Love going there to have my veggie delite sub. Until the last time, when I banged my head to the ceiling. Now, I prefer eating outside the shop, roaming around Park Street. This subway has a surprisingly friendly staff. Most of the sauces are always available. 
Not only this, This is my month end subway and hence I love it.

Ordered a Non-Veg Wrap (Chicken Strips with Harissa Sauce) and a Chicken Tandoori Salad for home delivery. The salad had Onion, Cucumber, Tomatoes, Jalapeños, Olives and Lettuce with Sweet Mayonnaise, Sweet Onion and South West sauces.
The food was, as always fresh and healthy.

Chicken tandoori ham is a must have. You can even try their veg options, they won't disappoint either. Cookies are decent. Try ham of the day, as it won't keep confusing you with various combinations..:)

There is a huge difference in placing order at the outlet and ordering through parcel.. the sub which I ordered was veggie delite and the taste was not great as compared to the one which I always order in the outlet 
They need to work on it and should be reminded that they will loose their customers if they work like this .: not against subway but giving my loyal advice..!

The sandwiches were very good. The sizes were also quite big and filled up our tummies. Overall a nice experience. Need to try out more items for better ratings.

One of the best places to feed your hunger at a moderate budget. Out on a long trip and want to have some heavy breakfast, this is a perfect place to feed your taste and stomach and make it easy skip lunch. 
The Chicken Tandoori Salad and the Italian wrap are among the best one should try.  Also not to forget the delicious Turkey, Chicken and ham wrap. 
And service at the park street subway is quite commendable.  At the same time they do have great home delivery facilities

The days when I'm hungry but I wanna have something healthy, the first option that comes to my mind is 'Subway'.  Whether it's the different burgers options or the salad, I think they are so healthy and yet so yummy with all those options you can choose from. The best party is you can customize your own type of burger. I love subway and it's my all time go-to option!

Whether you are eating at Subway, or getting it delivered, the freshness is always on point. A little slow though in terms of delivering the items in comparison to the other eating joints, but considering the good quality time taken could be given a miss.

it was garden fresh, yummy and very healthy.
subway is always my favorite for sudden healthy treats.u donot need to worry about your calories.

Placed an order recently with subway, park street outlet and the experience was horrible! People at the counter are hardly trained. Inspite of specifying the veggies and sauces, they made the sub according to their own wish and delivered it in their own sweet time.. And the bill amount differed as well.. The sub was cold as ice.. Such a bad experience for the price paid!

Had a  meeting in park street and this was join was there what could be the best way to grab a quick lunch and back to work.  But truly speaking I found the seating arrangement of this place to be a bit weird which I have not seen in so many visits of Subway across the city. 

Had a foot long chicken teryaki, it was not that rush on the counter but I am not sure why the person at the counter was not listening properly to the what I mentioned him to add on the sub and I had to tell him twice of my choices to get it right.

In terms of the taste, as usual awesome

Well, nothing new to write about this popular brand of sandwiches. 
I ordered a Chicken Tikka Sub through an online food delivery app. The sub was creamy with substantial amount of chicken. The filling included fresh lettuce, tomatoes, olives, capsicum and onion. The best part is that you have the option to customize the sub, for eg. request to make it without onion/olives.

I was amazed to see how greatly they pack the sandwiches and deliver to the customers. They wrap it in tissues and place it in a box and finally put the box in a cloth carry bag.  Extra point for that!

Quite filling one sub is. Try it!

I was honestly pretty disgusted with the food at Subway today. Believe it or not there was a huge cockroach crawling on the floor. In addition to this the air condition wasn't even working. 


I was charged 565/= for two sandwiches and a salad. The chicken ham and egg sandwich as well as the chicken tikka one was pretty ok. The roasted chicken salad costing Rs 210 HARDLY had 3-4 slices of chicken. It was too overpriced. Unlikely that il be going back in a hurry.

No matter how many times I visit this place, I can never get used to how cold and not-so-delicious the subways are. I ordered a Chicken Tikka and had specifically asked it to be made spicier than normal. The next thing I get is a subway that tastes cold, hardly spicy and just about eatable. The ambiance and place is the ONLY thing worth savoring about the place.

Located next to the Maruti Nexa showroom this is a comparatively large subway with 2 levels.

The service on this particular day was really pathetic and slow. They did not have enough waiters.

I had the sub of the day, chicken tikka which was made according to my liking. I still fail to understand how subs at certain subways taste better than at others when its supposed to be the same.

One of my favorite Subway outlets. Located in and around an area which specializes in not-so healthy food offering restaurants, a Subway here is more of a contrast than just another restaurant down the alley.

Tried the Roasted Chicken Sub here. The portion of the chicken was pretty big in size. Grilled perfectly, when combined with my choice of sauces, the sub was a delight to have. The staff here are friendly and prompt with the preparations.

Speaking of this joint in particular, I like the ambience. It's small but quite welcoming. The people are very nice and helpful. Moreover they have all the types of breads, unlike few places where you find something or the other missing.
There's not much to say apart from that you must try this place out! It's amazing and you're going to love it!

I never thought I'd be reviewing a fast food chain like subway. For the mere reason that it's everywhere and I thought that every outlet would be identical in service and taste. 
I was wrong. 
I've tried at least 5 subway outlets in Kolkata and this one scores the highest.

The dish variety at every subway is identical. What differs is the quality and mainly, the service. 

The service here was exceptional. Even though I had visited during the end of the day, the staff looked cheerful and energetic. 

I loved my sub, and their music selection. I think something as simple as the music selection also affects the whole experience. It was overwhelming how the man across the counter offered me a wet tissue after I was done. This was an experience I've never had with any subway outlet across the country.

Later, when I was ordering my next sub, the waiter said that he remembered the sauces and veggies I like. I was taken by surprise. It felt really good. This is the degree of hospitality we need in the city. 

I've tried to order delivery through nearby subway restaurants. Most of them either say they can't or they just rudely keep you hanging on the phone. This is the only outlet I've tried so far that has always delivered. 

In short, excellent hospitality makes this subway outlet my favourite.

TIP: Try your subs with their newly launched Honey Tamarind sauce and Harissa sauce. I loved the tamarind sauce more.

When you are in park street and not in a mood to dine yet need a healthy bite... SUBWAY is the go to place.
Chicken tandoori salad with mint mayo and some other sauces is a good option!
I tried their new chicken subwrap here which was quiet good.
Their subs have always been good if you choose your sauces and veggies well.

One of the good branches of subway. I tried tandoori chicken sub; which was different from my all time favourite chicken ham. Now tandoori chicken is obviously rich in masala, unlike ham. Gives an indian taste. Avoid putting olives. They'll make it really bitter. Also; avoid vinaigrette sauce too; unless you want it hot n sweet kinds.

Located at the heart of parkstreet this little outlet packs a punch.Like most Subs outlet the staff are very communicative along with being extremely attentive to your customization needs. I really like the fact that they have a giant screen for viewing purpose surely would love to come down during gaming days.Its spacious with nice compy seating arrangements.We went for a chicken strip subwrap with harissa sauce,turkey & chicken ham subway club, a chocolate cookie & two soft drinks.The new chicken strip subwrap is a real good new entrant as this multigrain wrap has a perfect side kick the harissa sauce which add the right tinge to the palate and the stuffing is adequate not over the top and the chicken strips are perfectly diced ,so one can go full on glut mode on these....they are filling and yet light on the tummy.Coming to the turkey & chicken and ham club made for sheer indulgence of gluttony as you dig into the layers of the meat it fills you up with sheer delight topped up by the sauces you prefer to go with. 

The chocolate cookie is the right sidekick to go with these and toast it up with soft drinks & your tummy will be filled be rest assured.It came up to 400 inclusive of all taxes.

This outlet of Subway is cool cause happy people serve you and you have an option to eat down as well as on top as two floor seating  is there which is helpful at times when there is a rush hour .
Now let's talk about what I ate here so I had taken one chicken ham , roasted chicken ,some chips and cold drinks along with my friend which was really prepared nicely and tasting really yummy , overall I was enjoying the experience of everthing from the staff , ambiance and food ofcourse .

I'm a fan of subway, been eating them since the outlet in New Alipore opened (9 years ago). This is the best outlet in the city bar none, they serve you enthusiastically and everything on the menu is available (including the secret Cesar sauce!).  Cleanliness, space and general attitude of the staff is inviting. Cheers to the excellent management!

One of the most spacious subways I have come across. It is divided in two floors and the floor above is quite spacious and has a number of comfortable sofa. The food is really good and they were quite first considering the fact that it was christmas. The bread and the chicken was really good.
P.s the staff is really awesome,it always feels great to exchange greetings,makes you feel a lot closer.

Subway is my all time favorite restaurant because they serves us tastiest and healthiest sandwiches. The ambitious and hospitality of this outlet was super good. Service was quick. Staff behavior was very helpful and friendly as well. Well i had a sub of the day today which was corn and peas in honey and oats bread and it's tastes delicious. I can feel the crunch of oats and taste of honey in every bite. The sub was very fresh, healthy, tasty and refreshing. Must a try place. Totally loved it. Recommended to all.

Subway, Park Street - A mixed experience
=====
Intro+Location: 

This subway belongs to one of my school friend devesh and as i was in park street area, i decided to pay a visit here. Unfortunately, the day i went the A.C. was not working and place had become scorching. This place is divided into two sections:- 

1) Ground floor where one can order and just few tables to sit.
2) A mezzanine floor above where one can just sit. I feel it was made to compensate the seating space lacking on the ground floor. They had kept sofas on the top which made it even more hot and on asking the owner about the same, it was as per the subway's design and instruction.

The ambience of the place is just okay. The wall paints were coming out and it did not really look as clean as a subway should be. 
=====
What i ordered: 

1) Chicken Tandoori Sub - The sub was fine. No problem with the taste. I had asked for less sauces and it was rightly added. 

2) Sprite to drink. 

However, the heat due to non functioning of a.c. was unbearable which did affect my whole experience. Nevertheless, i was assured that the same shall be fixed in few days. 
=====
Pros:

1) Prime location
2) Decent serving speed
3) Reasonably priced

Cons:
1) Ambience can be much more enhanced. It was not at all looking like a new outlet which opened a few months back. One should take care of it. 
2) The staffs can be much more cooperative.
=====
Summary: 

Food quality 3.4/5
Food quantity 3.4/5
Taste 3.4/5
Ambiance 3.1/5
Hygiene 3.3/5
Hospitality 3.2/5
Seating and overall experience 2.7/5
=====
Conclusion: 

I personally did not enjoy this place because it was very hot inside and even the ambiance of the place with respect to  park street did not appeal me much. I hope to have a better experience here when i visit again. :)
=====
Unbiased review based on my visiting experience.

Did a take away maybe a month back on my way back from Howrah station. 
It wasn't so highly crowded and thus, did not face much problems. 
Order: 
Foot-long Chicken Seekh
Bread: Multi-grain honey oat. 
Add-ons:
Mayo and spicy collection. 
Lettuce
Onions
Alpinos

Review:
Was made fast and payment was done real quick. Got it cut into 2 parts, for it becomes easier to travel with. 
Tasted really good. Subway always serves fresh and good. You just need to select the correct combination as per your taste. I bot of high pocket pinch because I am a student with not so supportive pocket money. 

DIFFERENT FOODIES HAVE DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF VEGGIES, SAUCES ETC, SO DO READ MULTIPLE REVIEWS FOR A BETTER CONCLUSION ON THE OTHER MENU ITEMS. KEEP EATING!

The best part is that they keep amazing offers on some days, like buy two and get any sub of your choice along with a small coke free. The offers are displayed outside the entrance. The subs are filling and absolutely value for money.

Believe me when I say, this is the Best Subway outlet in this city! Hands up, bow down! No arguments!! From their expansive setting arrangement, spacious interiors to their menus (the only place where they serve all, i mean it...literally everything a subway can offer) to their  warm service!! Everything is up to the mark!

We were in the area so decided to hop in. We ordered sub of the day - Chicken Tikka 12 inch sub. Needless to say it was amazing! Special mention to the seating arrangement, it has plush sofas to chill out!! With giant screen to watch a cricket match, it's a package! Will visit it soon!

Located in a prime location and parking no issue in normal days .
Soft corner always for a subway outlet with delicious chicken subs and parmism oregano being my favourite bread/ban in the subs.
This particular outlet is small limited seats but that is a case with most of the subway outlets here 
Small yet effective great taste good service and decent price which matches with the quantity we get .
Well no comments on the home delivery section i havnt tried it yet.
Well by all means it should be tried because it just yum atleast for me and surely for them who admire these burgers.
Do like or comment if this review was helpful.

I am giving 4 because they delivered to our house without any food panda. I am soo happy. :-)
Only disappointed because they missed out adding the cheese in the salad. The sub was perfect and so was the cookie. But I forgot to take the pictures of those 2.
But they didn't miss out any other stuff. Added all the sauces to a T. So overall really nice. 
And did I say they delivered to my place? 
Because most of them don't and if they do they charge more. So way to go.
Thank you.

The worst subway outlet I have ever ordered from ...I had orders a sub to be delivered to my home ..the delivery was fast but the sub was made with everything I told them not to put and they put in as less sauce in the sub possible almost negligible.. They might give good sub's when you go to the branch but I'd sure recommend not to have sub's home delivered from them ..

Subway is all time Best for me as It Serves Totally Fresh Sandwiches . They are good for your Health and I guess it is also They will give you least amount of Fat in your Body. I prefer the Daily Subs as you will get em at a Cheap Rate. I will Recommend you guys to taste Chicken Tuna and Chicken Tandoori and take a Diet Coke . Its a good combo to have a Meal.  I went there with my Friends today. We were having a tough time to Manage seats even if we had taken a Sofa. Ya, the place is a bit small for large Groups but yes, the Atmosphere will give Peace. 
We forgot to ask them a Particular Track which they were playing at the Background.... 
I will ask them to give some extra Services like Free Wifi.
Thank You

In my opinion, it's the best sub outlet in Kolkata. It's situated in the Park Mansions beside the Pizza Hut. They have also car parking facility.

*Order: Most of the time its sub of the day (non veg) and no refreshments, because that drink has a flavor like a more of water less of coke! Though Ice tea is a good decision. According to the bread, my choice is Italian or Italian bread. Just like same common bread (not sweet or too bitter). I have no clue about dessert as I never tasted it yet. 

*Service: Staff is essentially great, friendly, informative and cool. I for the most part make my own specific kind of sub, so I have my own specific sort of serving of blended sauce and grilled bread. They did it great Not just that, they give you some additional offers (request it) make you cheerful. After Pune, this spot is the best spot for any sub fan. 

*Quality: Ask them, they will make it great. Good good and good...

*Overall: This spot is simply good. Possibly you can sit on the ground floor or on the off chance that you require more space and comfort, go up stairs. Enjoy 'how to make a good sub' from there. The washroom is clean and maintained.

*My rating is 3.5/ 5

Located in the Park Mansions just on the lane of Pizza Hut. Easy parking available. If you are going to this subby, you can easily park your vehicle in park mansions. But dont lose the bill as you have to present it to the security while exit. 
Talking about this outlet. This outlet is quite good. Ordering area is little small but wide sittings are available. Comfortable sittings. Fresh foods. Good service. Quite a nice place for healthy eating. 😊

Want food which is fresh, healthy and full of veggies and provided with a variety of options and choices?? Ur place is Subway! Whether u r vegetarian or non veg person Subway has so many choices for u!!
U can choose ur bread, the veggies u wana have and even the sauces of ur choice! Also ur sandwich type or if u want a salad!
On a regular basis, I try out 'sub of the day'. But my favourite Sandwiches are Italian BMT, Turkey, Tuna and also Chicken Teriyaki, Tandoori, Tikka. I also like the Chicken Ham and Roasted chicken! I actually love every sub!! I always make it a meal. Adding the dark chocolate cookie!! It's totally awesome!
Subway means fresh delicious food within ur budget which fills both ur appetite and heart with happiness :)

It was not enough that Subway has never been able to give me a sandwich just like I want it ..  Either the breads not available or they get my sauces wrong! 

I was getting out of Burlington and crossing the road at 4:35pm on Friday, 29th May and a delivery boy hit me with the bike. My knee still hurts. I asked him why he was driving the wrong way and he said it was my fault that I wasn't looking and it is obvious that they will not go around the block. He just fled before I could even take details of the bike. 

Train them to be courteous before making them call on home deliveries. And anyways I always complain that my sub wasn't the way I wanted it and there is never any 'action' taken like they promise. 

All in all Subway is never again for me now.

The restaurant is a part of chain that primarily sells submarine sandwiches (subs) and salads. They also sells wraps and baked goods. Subway's best-selling sandwich is the B.M.T., contains pepperoni, salami, and ham. Subway restaurants in India do not serve beef or pork products. Ham is chicken Ham and peperoni is Lamb pepperoni.Subs are economic and hygienic method to quench one’s hunger, especially during lunch and dinner time.

Location: Park Mansion, Park street. 

This outlet is located quite near to Pizza Hut or to be exact, right opposite Mocambo restaurant.

The ambiance in all the outlets are nearly the same owing to the interiors but, this is the first outlet that I came across which had sofas as well along with the usual chairs. This particular twist just gave it a more American feel. But, the walls looked disastrous and yes, the advertisement panes on the walls were coming out as they were damaged. Turn off. Either get it repaired and use them or completely remove them if it's no longer needed. Please don't leave it damaged. Turns off a customer completely.

About the Sub, I had called for my personal favorite, Veggie Delite made up in the Oregano bread with my choice of veggies and sauces. 
Starting off with the bread, it wasn't available at a peak dinner time i.e. 8pm. A bad start though, shifted to another bread which was found to be fresh and fluffy. About the veggies, the lettuce looked stale, the rest cold cuts were fresh and juicy. Disappointed with the amount of veggies the server put in the sub, looked as if he was serving me for free! C'mon am paying you, be courteous enough to put a considerable amount of veggies. I had to keep repeating myself like a broken record to put in a little more veggies. The same story followed with the sauces. Aargh. I ended up telling him to make it nicely and not just rush with it!
Finally got my sub. It tasted good, thanks to their service? No. Thanking myself for poking the server to make it properly. 

The service wasn't up to the mark in regards to the sub as well as in regards to the billing. At the billing counter, please stop keeping a portion of the change to yourself! A single penny makes you a dishonest outlet.

A few customers might have kept the change without cross checking, but, all don't do the same! Yes, I cross checked and found that the person at the counter had given me less and on informing, his answer to me is,"I gave all the change, you must have kept it in your pocket."
And I was like,"the change is still in my hand, you think you can outsmart me?!". Cutting short, a minute of argument later, I was given back the exact change. By this time, I was completely turned off!
CUSTOMERS, KINDLY CHECK YOUR CHANGE BEFORE LEAVING THE COUNTER!! A SINCERE REQUEST.
DISGUSTED.

Prices are uniform across all outlets.

Overall was a bad experience!
- A pure miss for me. Would prefer other outlets, may have the same story in regards to the quality, but at least are honest ones!
Hope to see this matter being taken seriously by the management and if possible, by the owner himself and a solution be brought into action, else, this outlet sadly doesn't have a long lifeline.

Healthy, tasty and pocket friendly. Of all the subway outlets I personally like this one the most. All the ingredients are fresh here always. A sub is surely enough to fill your hungry stomach anytime.

They do not open at 9.. they open at 11... one should not feed false information to people... I with so much hope had called to order but was left utterly disappointed...

It's actually 1 for food and 1 for service. Always in a hurry and. Someone should teach them to listen. Instead of card if I use my Sodexo vouchers they will behave as though they are giving it for free. Absolute no no specially this outlet

Location: Park Mansion, Park street. 

This outlet is located quite near to Pizza Hut or to be exact, right opposite Mocambo restaurant.

The ambiance in all the outlets are nearly the same owing to the interiors but, this is the first outlet that I came across which had sofas as well along with the usual chairs. This particular twist just gave it a more American feel. But, the walls looked disastrous and yes, the advertisement panes on the walls were coming out as they were damaged. Turn off. Either get it repaired and use them or completely remove them if it's no longer needed. Please don't leave it damaged. Turns off a customer completely.

About the Sub, I had called for my personal favorite, Veggie Delite made up in the Oregano bread with my choice of veggies and sauces. 
Starting off with the bread, it wasn't available at a peak dinner time i.e. 8pm. A bad start though, shifted to another bread which was found to be fresh and fluffy. About the veggies, the lettuce looked stale, the rest cold cuts were fresh and juicy. Disappointed with the amount of veggies the server put in the sub, looked as if he was serving me for free! C'mon am paying you, be courteous enough to put a considerable amount of veggies. I had to keep repeating myself like a broken record to put in a little more veggies. The same story followed with the sauces. Aargh. I ended up telling him to make it nicely and not just rush with it!
Finally got my sub. It tasted good, thanks to their service? No. Thanking myself for poking the server to make it properly. 

The service wasn't up to the mark in regards to the sub as well as in regards to the billing. At the billing counter, please stop keeping a portion of the change to yourself! A single penny makes you a dishonest outlet. My copy of the bill also reflects the amount I am supposed to be returned back if I give you a note of higher denomination and yes, I know mathematics as well!

quite nice for a quick grab if u r in hurry! dine in is also a good option. on the way home from college i often opt for takeaways. subs are made fresh infront of us and we can add whatever we like, buts sad that often they are out of the oregano bread. i love their rosted chicken sub.

Good place for a quick bite. 
There's nothing special about this joint, other than the fact there is a sufficient seating space upstairs. There's a sofa too, which is uber comfy. The ground floor is kinda cramped,though. The staff is pleasant, and the food is complacent to the usual Subway standards.

I have been so much let down by the quality of subway. Sadly but this joint is degrading its quality. The staffs are so much in a hurry to prepare the bread, they dont even listen to our preferences.The staff is in-experienced and does not possess the capability of making world-class Subs the way Subway does. Without even asking the pre-heat the bread, and add cheese. I personally like cold subs. The lettuce often looks stale and brown.

The very name & of course the smart menu presentation every time conjures up my hunger, when ever i pass by this joint. The place is some what bit stuffy to dine in, compared to the other near by cafeterias... but the persons at the counters are real prompt & cordial at the same time. The subs & the salads are served real fresh(as one can view the processing ), & of great taste by mixing a variety of sauce. But Better not to try the Combo offers of the day... as it appears to be cheap but the stuffings inside are much less than the original one in the menu. The Italian B.M.T & the Chicken Teriyaki, I find the best amongst the lot , with Origano Bread and spicy sauce combination.

Nothing can be better than the subway salad, when hunger strikes ! I was quite confused as to what to have this time at subway because I have tried all the subs ! So salad was my pick , and I took a mixture of shammi kebab and roasted chicken salad topped with mustard , honey mustard and mint ! The result was a perfect and delicious salad! Iced tea along with the the salad makes a perfect combo! I liked the service too! Its always good to eat @subway!

I don't exactly remember the name but some 'food expert' once said that while eating, the one thing which matters even more than the food is hospitality. Many may not agree, but hospitality and customer satisfaction are indeed very crucial pinpoints in outlet chains. Keeping that in mind, I really want to thank the staff of subway who were throughout helpful and presented some wonderful suggestions. 
Now the main part, the food itself. Subway is famous for its freshness and delicate yet stupendous subs. I personally am a big fan of this chain and don't miss any chance of having a bite here. And so when I saw this branch in Park Street area, I thought of giving it a try. I ordered a chicken tikka sub and added suggestion, tandoori chicken in it. The end result was quite good; the sublime part was that you could easily figure out the different tastes of tikka and tandoori. 
The ambience of subway is always great, add a bit of rain and it's a perfect place to eat. Ended with a veg toastie which was delightfully creamy. believe me, give it a try and see for yourself. 
Enjoy!!

This outlet being close to office, I have been there quite a number of times. Seating is ok with a few tables below and more on the first floor. Most of the experiences have been good and as per Subway standards. But there was one time where they seem to have messed up. Had ordered a western egg, which contains egg, chicken ham and veggies. Once i started eating it I realised that they hadnt put chicken ham at all. Brought it to the notice of the restaurant manager and he agreed to change my partly eaten sub with a new one. As long as issue resolved, they are forgiven and as long as office is close by, will surely drop by for more

Recently tried this subway outlet located in park street just opposite Mocambo. The outlet has just a couple of seats on the basement with major portion of the seating on first floor. Overall i didnt find the whole arrangement that comfortable and it was too stuffy upstairs and would prefer to leave the couches here for the chairs below, if empty. The staff was cordial, polite and very generous with the veggies which matters to me a lot.

The sandwiches were pretty well made. I tried the recently launched hara bhara sub but dint like it that much and would stick to my all time favorites veg shammi or corn n peas in mayo henceforth. Overall a decent experience but lacked that classic subway feel.

Subway Park Mansion had its own promo, they gave me a discount card where on every visit i would get a certain discount. The seating was good but the place seemed empty and i perhaps found the vegies a little less fresher than they should be. They did not have Lipton Ice Tea my favorite drink with the sub, so i was disappointed. Maybe i should have opted for a roll down the street.

Subway being such a great international brand ,is not expected to decline in its quality..But this has been happening for the last few months in some outlets of Kolkata..Since they use cut vegetables in the Sub sandwiches , they need to be absolutely fresh ..But sometimes it seems that they fail to maintain the quality which they used to do in the earlier days.. 
I had visited this particular outlet numerous times in the last few years but recently have found their quality gone down  a little. Sometimes their veges get stale or the lettuce tasted bland and when i inquire about these they have nothing to say.. Apart from these ,i love their sandwiches especially the tuna sandwich and roasted chicken..They provide good amount of tuna stuff and the various sauces also seemed fresh..But in addition to the non veg stuff ,they also need to take care of the veg stuffs.. 
Overall a good outlet though very small.. The staffs are good and helpful.Considering the above issues are solved , Subway is always a good place to hang out and that also at reasonable prices..
Recommended Items : Chicken Teriyaki, Tuna ,Roasted Chicken ,Italian BMT (if u r ham lover) ,Paneer tikka...
Pocket Pinch : Rs 300 for two (approx)

Subway is perhaps one of the biggest Fast Food Brands globally so its sad when they fail to maintain quality control. Believe me I have eaten in Subways abroad and the quality of the ingredients is far superior not just in terms of taste but freshness as well. Out of all the veggies the most universally ordered in any Sub Sandwich is the lettuce .... therefore it has to be absolutely fresh .... I had visited this particular outlet recently and was saddened to see brown wilted lettuce .... I ordered myself an Italian BMT minus the lettuce because it looked so stale and awful. The rest of the cold cuts and cheese were fresh as was the bread so I still have given an average rating. However I do intend to visit again and cross - check this point. I have noticed this trend in a couple of other Subway outlets in Kolkata as well. Just wondering fellow foodies who are from other cities what is your feedback on this point ?

A decent place for hanging out with friend or a quick office lunch. Service quality is also very good, absolutely value for money, service is quite good. Sometimes I've found in various subway outlets that the trays are not clean enough, but here I've always found clean trays, and all types of sauces are always available here.. Services are are helpful enough.. Really love this place..

One of my favourite places to grab a quick snack. The prices for the sub of the day and other subs have gone up a bit but the taste and quality has been maintained. Clean place, friendly staff and good two floor ambience. Love the Italian bmt  and the less advertised subway club. If your looking for a healthy meal that leaves you feeling good and light subway Is definately the place to go to.

Friday afternoon I visited ‘Subway’ in Park Street along with my friend Soumitra Kumar Sahoo . It’s one of the best places when you are very hungry and needs a quick serving. The subs and ingredients they serve are healthy and fresh. They have a great variety of sauces like southwest, bbq, honey oat etc. We ordered Subs with Ham, Chicken, Egg and Cheese. It’s just wonderful and melted in mouth. The place is very well maintained and certainly value for money.
