Yesterday I visited here to complete my dinner with their Chilly Chicken(Gravy). But it seems that instead of providing chicken balls , they provide CORNFLOUR BALLS. I hardly found any glimpse of chicken, the balls were made fully by cornflour and they charged â‚¹ 130 for it. Also the container they provided with it seems to be a used one, because there were black spots everywhere on the surface of it. The name of the restaurant, which usually we found printed on the lid, was also not there. So, think twice before buying anything from here.

Got their food home delivered via Zomato.
 
Veg fried rice: the rice was well cooked with good amount of veggies. 

Veg chowmein: this was tad bit oily. It had veggies in it. Average in taste.

Chilli Chicken: the chicken pieces were boneless and succulent. It was very delicious.

Had ordered home delivery from this one this afternoon i.e. 11/06/16

Good food @ Less rate .. Is what describes it in brief.

We ordered Chicken Lat-me-kebab n Pan fried chilli fish for starters... N the quantity for each of the dishes were more than enough fr 2 of us.
They tasted really good as well.. Especially the fish... Prepared on Basa, the fish..

Egg fried rice n hot garlic chicken was ordered for main crse... The rice was again oh huge quantity making itself worth of Rs 100...
The chicken seemed to b a bit hard to me.. Bt taste was ok.
All these make us pay Rs 570 only !

Keep it up.
