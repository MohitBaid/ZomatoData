It's an open place situated on the ground floor of Quest Mall near the elevators. Thankfully, in spite of being an open space it isn't noisy. So you can relax, chat and have your meal in peace. The service is pretty laid, in fact, at times it becomes a task to catch the eye of the waiter!! But that's ok if you want to chat and spend time with friends. But if you are in a hurry then this place is a no no!! Menu is a bit limited but the food is excellent. That's why in spite of slow service this place is quite crowded.
First course we had soup: cappuccino de fungi, and it was heartwarming on a winter afternoon. Delicious and creamy but I felt they could have had more shreds of mushroom. We enjoyed the soup.
Next I had Asian Curry with veggies. It was served with rice and a chilli vinaigrette. Very tasty. 
My friend had Nasi Goreng and she praised the dish. It had satays of chicken with rice and prawn crisps.
Since, my being a veg prevented us from sharing a plate we had to order two and this became too much for us.....we were too full to have any dessert.
Good food....slow, lackadaisical service.

Coffee and the milk shakes are always on the chart, when you are hanging around somewhere, and just wanted to spend some time over the quick byte.

So, we were there in the quest mall, thought of giving it a try , while spending some time over there.

Location:
__________

It was in the ground floor of the quest mall.

Ambience:
____________

Well this is basically a outlet, having the sitting arrangement in the open area of the mall.

Food & Beverages:
____________________

‚úì Expresso - took the small one. Nice one.
‚úì Cappachino with hazelnut - we took the cappachino and took the hazelnut as add on. It's okay type.
‚úì Apple Tart - it comes as a cake only. Expected some tart over type. Served hot. But yes okay type to me.
‚úì Peach Milkshake - very nice one.
‚úì Berry Milkshake - it's quite nice.


All that cost 760 INR.

So, I would say it is nothing exciting, not even bad. So, if you want you can give it a try.

And till my next review , enjoy your food. :)

Since my favourite restaurants are being renovated at Quest mall, I had a quick lunch at Q33 before I continued to shop. It was a quite lunch as not too many people were around, thus the service was slightly slow (all staff should be attentive to all customers). 

My table was not equipped with the right cutlery, so when my food arrived I had to ask for a fork. I ordered the fish and chips, I was served two large breaded fish fillets and a portion of wedges. 

Cooked really well and the dish was filling, I enjoyed my quick lunch. Size of the fish may have been too large but I'm not complaining :)

This is a really good spot for a cafe in the mall and they have not done too much in the decor and with minimal color and style done the interiors which I quite like. The menu isn't extensive and sticks to a proper cafe menu. Maybe I am being too hard with the rating but this review is only for the things I had which I found to be just okay-ish and very expensive

What I ordered: 

-Currant Shake : well made but a little too sweet

Watermelon & Feta Salad : Yes ,you get what's mentioned on the menu and it is prepared well but then again in most restaurants you are given a huge portion of the salad and chunks of feta but this was like a sprinkle which annoyed me and the price was really expensive

The service was quick but not with a smile. I would rather sit in the other food option places in the mall than here since it just looked okay-ish and rather expensive

I‚Äôve been here at least four times now. Slow service. Average food and drinks. Also I‚Äôm not a big fan of indoor alfresco setting. Better food options upstairs with BombBrass and Yautcha. For coffee there are better options around Quest mall, and new java joints seem to be mushrooming every month.

Placed at ground floor of the mall this place is extremely fun and vibrant.With an open setting you can sit down at a nice corner with a warm cup of coffee and delicious savoury items from their menu.We tried the ever so Classic Cold Coffee and Cafe Mocha.You can never go wrong with these two.
They also some amazing savoury items.The pizzas and keema pav is a must try.

One of our favourite cafes in town. Great food. But over time the service has gone downhill, very sloppy. The servers don't bother attending to guests, service is very slow, maybe they're understaffed. But an unsatisfied customer is a poor reference in today's competitive marketplace. Pls resolve this immediately and get it back to the old days.

The MUD CAKE here is to swoon for. I can legit have those all day. Every day xD xD. 

Speaking of the price, the stuff they sell are affordable. Like very very very cheap considering the fact that it is situated in Quest ( which is a mall in Calcutta with international brands and luxurious products. ) 

The only reason why i couldn't rate this as a Fantastic Five is because the place was very small with just two tables.

It is strange that even though I have hung out a lot in Q33, the only thing I have tried here, besides their temporary healthy menu, is iced tea. I jumped straight to coffee and coffee-related items there a couple of days ago, when I went on a coffee trail.¬†I tried three items from their menu for my coffee-themed trail - a hot cup of the Cappuccino, a tall glass of the Cold Coffee and for dessert, the Irish Creme Eclair. The drinks were made well and left me refreshed. I particularly liked the cold coffee. They usually serve the drink with the sugar already in it, so if you need it without the sugar, or have it replaced with stevia, don't forget to ask.¬†The Irish Creme Eclair was an interesting dessert. On the outside, there's a glossy, creamy layer, with the flavours of coffee and cream, justifying the name, Irish Creme. In fact, also looks a little like cream and coffee swirling with each other, and has coffee beans on top. The texture on the inside is something between a pie-crust and a cookie. I made the mistake of trying to cut into it with a spoon, and had to fight with the dessert. I suppose I would have preferred the texture to be slightly more "bite-friendly", but I liked the taste.¬† ¬†Altogether, I had a fun start to my coffee trail in Quest Mall!

Mexican chargrilled vege, vegetable khowsuey and Q33 are all good. Lemongrass Iced Tea and Cooler are both good. The taste changed between my two visits of the edibles unfortunately(not the drinks) but not so much to reduce the rating any lower. The dessert section‚Äôs a disaster though.

Located at the base of Quest mall escalators, Q33 scores at all the right places. The place is elegantly done in earth colors. Our order consisted of cold coffee with hazelnut syrup, virgin mojito, grilled chicken and picante-con-pollo. Each item was perfectly cooked. We loved the food.

Went here just for dessert after a sumptuous lunch at serafina. Located in the ground floor of quest, the cafe has a unique sitting arrangement making good use of the space below escalators and has a lovely ambience. Its an open cafe bang in the middle of the shops at the ground floor and is very different in terms of the look and feel from the other restaurants at the mall.
Order-- as I said we went there only for the desserts. Ordered the blueberry swiss roll and butterscotch frosted cupcake.
Food- the blueberry swiss roll had me drooling. I love blueberry in anything and everything and this was no exception. The size was quite big, It was creamy and yummy and had a distinct blueberry flavour.
The butterscotch frosted cupcake was okayish. While it looked incredibly cute (size was small), it was kind of hard and dry and and the frosting was also not that good.
Bill- around 220 INR
overall--since I haven't tried any of the savory item I would love to go back and have some. But The desserts weren't anything extravagant.

Located in the ground floor of the Quest Mall, Q33 is one of the posh cafes that captures the very essence of the mall (refer to the prices !) With a variety of shakes and tiny tit-bits on offer, it's a great place to hang out or work, if you have enough pennies to spend. 

I tried the Oh My Cookie shake and the Warm Chocolate Tart. Both taste extremely good, and the matter being a variant of the Molten Lava Cake oozes out pure chocolate when tapped with the spoon. The mixture of the cold vanilla ice-cream and the hot chocolate is all that you need to uplift your spirit on a bad day!

The food was scrumptious no doubt.. And the portions are big enough to fill your tummy.

Price? Yeah well it is on the higher side. Can't help with that but the taste of the food will make up for it. You can also go for smaller titbits to eat if your budget is constrained. The menu is small so your choices will be limited.

It is located on the ground floor of Quest Mall and gives you a good view of the mall and the passing people. You will love the experience.

The pizzas, pancakes, salads are just too good. Razzmatazz, Peach Sunset and Warm Chocolate Tart are my favourite sinful delights herein. The service is very good.

LOCATION: Situated on the ground floor of one of the most premium malls of Kolkata , it it just below the ground floor escalator & is easy to locate.
AMBIENCE: It surrounds the escalator & has a cafe type scattered seating. The decor is mainly in the tones of beige & white. The seats are plush but very comfortable.
SERVICE: The staff is quite efficient & friendly but instead of the salad they served the chocolate tart first. Oh & also they forgot to provide me with a fork.
MENU: The menu mainly comprises of continental hors d'oeuvres. There are also a wide range of desert coffees & teas. Limited options of main course are also available.
FOOD: The watermelon & creamy feta salad with balsamic reduction was simply delectable. The creaminess of feta with the refreshing taste of watermelon was simply a match made in heaven. The macaroni & cheese was gooey & cheesy & has the magic to satisfy any hungry soul. Lastly the chocolate mud tart was a visual delight. It was love at first sight. The melted chocolate had just the right amount of sweetness & bitterness to it. With sprinklings of cocoa powder & icing sugar on top it was a delight for the taste buds. But the tart shell was a little chewy & hard. Nevertheless it was a very good experience at Q33.

I have a bit of mixed feelings about this place.
To start off the location of the caf√© is great, open and spacious.
We ordered for a grilled chicken pizza, sunshine cooler and a hot cappuccino.
The waiter asked if we would like the drinks before or along with the pizza and agreed upon the latter.
The waiter said it would take 15-20 minutes for the pizza so we were good with it.
It took them 40 minutes to finally bring the pizza and they brought the drinks another 10 minutes later.
The pizza and the cooler were decent, cappuccino was a bit cold.
Then we had a blueberry cupcake and this one really tasted good.
Service is however very slow and poor and they should improve it right away.

A small coffee shop located on the ground floor of Quest. Nice open seating. Good service and friendly staff.
To start with, we ordered an iced choco mint, iced mocha and a razzmatazz (raspberry+yoghurt). Both the coffees were way too sweet, loaded with sugar syrup. The razzmatazz was sweet too but the yoghurt added some break in the taste.
We also ordered pancakes and spaghetti arrabiata. The pancakes were delicious, soft and very well prepared. The spaghetti was also well cooked with a generous amount of chicken and sauces.
Overall, being a cafe, would recommend improving the coffee first. Savouries are however quite good.

Unlike most of the restaurants in quest mall , Q33 prices are average. I had a mango panna, a margarita pizza and the chocolate tart from the menu . The margarita pizza was thin crust and really delicious and I would recommend you try the non vegetarian pizzas too from the menu. The panna was okayish and the tart was around 60 bucks and was super filling. Overall the place is affordable.

Planning on a Goa trip and wondering how to reduce so that you can flaunt your abs at the beach! And by now, you must have already taken a gym membership too. Let me tell you then, to achieve the lean body, the exercises count in for only 30% and the rest 70% depends on what we eat ‚Äì our diet, our daily intake of carbs, fats and proteins. So, taking care of a healthy diet and maintaining it is what actually counts for.

Disappointing.

I can't fathom why the management of Q33 would keep a system of "reservation" on a holiday.

Had been going here regularly because of conveniece (since it is located in quest mall and we visit the mall often).
But this visit has really put me off.

Will always think twice before visiting again.

Service in general is slow. Even in off hours.
Order for espresso with whipped cream. Recd espresso with plain cream. Aparently the whipped cream melted enroute to my table.

They finally got it right after much fussing on my part. No apologies for the inconvenience.

Upgrading my rating of them to 2 (earlier was 1).
They really need to pull up their socks.

I genuinely love where Q33 is placed on the ground floor of Quest Mall, it stands tall with the big brands like Canali, Michael Kors, Gucci, etc and as you go up the levels and look down below you see the typical circular structure of this open caf√© around the escalator. The caf√© looks beautiful with laid-back and classy outdoor seating as one of its USPs. It has looks of a French caf√© with book shelves and home d√©cor elements you would adore. The 40+ seater caf√© exudes warmth for this open structure that somewhat welcomes you as you pass by, there are no doors which you need to open to walk into this classy caf√©. The typical circular structure surely allows maximum people to sit and enjoy a good conversation over some great food. It‚Äôs always nice to sip your coffee while lazily gazing at the busy shopaholics all around. And yes, food is definitely a plus point here. Though this place serves global cuisine, but recently I found there are more reasons to come back to this place and the primary reason is their new ‚ÄúHealthy Food Menu‚Äù. Recently I was invited by First Idea PR for a tasting session of their Healthy Food Menu that includes several flavorful yet healthy eating options. 'Eating out' and 'Eating junk' is pretty synonymous these days. And ailments are somewhat free gifts that come along with these habits. But every time these statements need not be true. There are restaurants in the city now serving this Healthy food to attract more health-conscious crowd. And as I said, Q33 is surely one of them. Their 'Healthy Food Menu' is a pure bliss and boon for someone craving to eat out but is very particular about his/her health!

Healthy eating is a habit that should be practiced by us once in awhile. It's not like we will run out of places in Kolkata, as there are a number of healthy eating places that have popped up in and around the city. Although a caf√© serving savouries and other mouthwatering delicacies, Q33 has recently launched its healthy menu meant for the fitness enthusiasts. I am a hardcore foodie but sometimes I do indulge in some healthy eating, so I was excited when I was invited at the healthy menu launch at Q33!

Q33 is a well known caf√© which is located in the ground floor of the state of the art Quest Mall. Having never had the opportunity to visit this caf√©, I was thrilled when I received the invitation. I had a fruitful guilt-free afternoon where I tucked into some amazing healthy grub.

So let's start with the nutritious items that were served to us.

‚Ä¢ Oats and Fresh Veggies Soup - I've always loved oats but had never tried out an oats soup. This soup was rich in fibre oats infused with fresh root vegetables and herbs. Tasted subtle and good.

‚Ä¢ Chicken and Asparagus Broth - I loved this one, so much so, that I had gulped down two bowls of this broth. Again low caloried vegetables were used in addition to chicken cubes which gave a wonderful flavour to the soup.

‚Ä¢ Citrus and Mixed Lettuce Salad - There was an abundance of lettuce, pineapple and orange segments. This salad was topped with lemon and honey dressing which gave a unique taste to it.

‚Ä¢ Olive Drizzled Steam Veggies - This was the best salad of the day and I loved it. It had asparagus, zucchini, babycorn, broccoli, cauliflower and carrots. The vegetables had a mild flavour thanks to the olive oil. Loved it!

‚Ä¢ Tropical Fruit Salad - If you love fresh and juicy fruits, this salad is for you. It looked very colourful and appealing! This salad included fresh watermelons, apples, bananas and papayas. Since I love fruits, this was heavenly to me! Recommended!

‚Ä¢ Poached Fish with Mango Veloute - This was the final dish that was served to us. It looked very beautiful. The fish was soft and tasted out of this world. If you think healthy and oil free food doesn't taste good, you need to try out this item! The Mango Veloute requires a special mention. Strongly recommended.

So all you fitness junkies, if you're craving for some nutritious yet tasty food, Q33 is where you need to be! I thoroughly enjoyed the afternoon munching on super healthy stuff. And I'm sure you will too if you try out the healthy menu at Q33!

I've been to this joint quite a number of times but never could write a review before. Me and my wife go to this restaurant when we need to eat simple and safe and not interested to visit those high end restaurants or the food court housed in quest mall.

We usually try out egg items, spaghetti pastas and lattes at Q33. Recently we tried out an additional dish - Mumbai chatpata sandwich. It was pretty decent, keep of home made stuff, nothing exceptional.

Coffees are pretty good, they make it well, with the right balance of coffee and milk. 

Staff service is average. Staff are too occupied in serving and lack attention to detail. For example :- they would give you water after being for it for at least 4-5 times. The turnaround time from taking order to delivery is also exceptionally high. An order of pasta and veg sandwich would take 20 mins approx considering they have kept the charges for food items at par with upscale cafes in town.

Overall the food quality is pretty good. They should improve on service quality big time.

Healthy food is the new trend these days, with so many health cafes springing up in the city. Healthy food is never my take but healthy and nutritious food is what our body desires. Amongst us, there are a lot of people who desire for healthy food to maintain their diet. Thus, Q33 has come up with their brand new healthy menu to cater to such people all over the city. 

Q33 is an open cafe in the ground floor of the lavish Quest Mall. The menu is very similar to what you may expect in a cafe. I was recently invited here to try out the healthy menu. Though the menu is limited, it has good variation which somehow impressed me.

I started with the soups. There were two variants. The Oats and Fresh Veggie Soup was rich in fibre oats infused with fresh root high nutritious vegetables and herbs. The Chicken and Asparagus Broth had exotic low caloried vegetables infused with some added chicken cubes enriched with proteins. I, being a non vegetarian, prefered the chicken broth which was mild and flavourful. 

Next I had the salads on the table. The Tropical Fruit Salad included apple, papaya, banana and watermelon. The fruits were fresh and juicy. However, since I do not like papaya and banana, the salad somehow didn't go well with me. The next salad was Citrus and Mixed Lettuce Salad. It was a mixture of greens, pineapple and orange segments with a light lemon honey dressing. This was really nice, with a special mention to the pineapple and melons.

Olive Oil Drizzled Steamed Veggies included asparagus, carrot, broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini and babycorn. The soft and juicy veggies were something I was very delighted to have. 

The final dish on the healthy menu, which was my favourite was Poached Fish with Mango Veloute. The fish was soft and fresh. It tasted out of the world. The mango veloute deserves a special mention. 

Overall, the healthy menu at Q33 is something which every healthy food seeker must give a try. My recommendation goes with the chicken broth, citrus and lettuce salad, and definitely the poached fish.

Being situated in Quest Mall the ambience is great. The food is awesome too. I especially loved the drinks we ordered. Their salads and Ramini are great. I had a full tummy and heart as I left this place. The staff are friendly and prompt at their service too. My family and I had a great time here. All in all, it's a fancy place with good food to offer. A bit of a pocket pinch for students maybe but that may vary.

Located in the ground floor of quest mall, this restaurant is a pretty looking thing. The size of the menu cards they have are hugeeeeeee! We ordered for a think crust veg pizza and a lemongrass drink. The drink was pretty average, but the pizza on the other hand was fluffy and tasty. Though i hate thin crust as my base, this one changed my mind completely. It is on the expensive side, but the food is definitely good.

This place is located in Quest mall ground floor . The place is nice and being open makes up for quite an ambience. I had been there on a Saturday with my fiance for snacks and had to stick to the veg menu. 

I tried the Cheese Chilli Toast and the Guava Passion  Smoothie. Both of the preparations were delicious. The Chilli Toast was the best I had so far and the Guava Passion was so nostalgic of the Chilli spiced Guava we so loved having in our childhood. 

I loved the experience and would love to be back here.

A completely rubbish experience.¬†

I debated long and hard before writing this review. Thought, well, we were never going to go there so what the hell...but then I felt that I needed to let the management know about our experience.... Also, I would not wish anyone else to go through what we did.¬†

We thought we'd round off a lovely movie experience with coffee and chose to go to Q33. We ordered Keema-pav and Darjeeling tea for my husband and a Blueberry muffin and Mocha for me from a gum-chewing server who was more interested in looking around than in taking the order. The tea and coffee came in first after a long wait. This was strange because a beverage is to be had with the food, or after. Certainly not before the food! Darjeeling Tea - a cup of hot water and a tea bag.....this was their idea of Darjeeling tea. Sacrilege. The Mocha was okay. Beverage over, ¬†the Keema-pav was brought. The pav was rock hard....knowing it would be futile to call the server, my husband bravely ploughed his way through it....rather hammered his way through it. No sign of the muffin. We finally managed to catch the eye of another server and told him about this lapse. He probably told the server for our table, because after another wait, the muffin was brought.......cold, raw dough in streaks, and a blob of blueberry jam at the bottom. They had cut the muffin into 4 and the jam was kind of sitting there looking most ugly. I put one forkful in my mouth and almost vomited....what a horrible smell it had...horrible....I just couldn't eat it. We called our gum-chewing server and told him the muffin was inedible. So he looks at it, looks at us and asks: What shall I do with this? Not wanting to prolong this torture, we asked for the bill, paid and left.¬†

Be warned...
                    

Am I being sticky? I don't think so....Calcutta standards, by and large, are on the high side...and one would want this to continue. One goes to a caf√© not only for the food and drink, but for the whole experience......One wants a degree of elegance....Is that too much to ask?

Q33 is a perfect place to grab some quick snacks along with some of their delicious dessert.Its basically a cafe with open seating area and inspite of it we found the ambiance of the place excellent.The service was just unmatchable and in food we had-

1:Chef's special
2:Chocolate mud tart

Among them their mud tart is a must try and the powdered topping on it just makes it one of the best dessert.

Decided to grab some cupcakes here today when I visited Quest Mall. This cafe is situated near the escalator,on the ground floor. Inspire of being smack in the middle of the ground floor, the decor is nicely maintained and the seating is comfortable. Ordered Chocolate Mud Tart and Oreo cupcake as the red velvet one wasn't available. The Oreo cupcake was nothing special. Small vanilla cupcake with some icing and an Oreo biscuit on top. Size of the cupcake was very small. The chocolate mud tart totally stole our hearts. Molten chocolate in a tart shell, dusted with coffee and powdered sugar and served after warming it up. It's a great chocolate dessert. The thick molten lava chocolate is very tasty. Must try dish here! Service is decent, price is on the higher side. Do pop in here just for this mud tart whenever you come to Quest :-)

I had the cheesecakes that they sell here but it was mostly take aways. Now I can finally write a good review on Q33 where I finally went in person, sat down and ate their food. Situated on the ground floor, just outside lifestyle ( quest mall ), it was an open area visible to everyone. We were greeted warmly and the server was really courteous, even held out the chair for me. Something that you dont expect in a cafe.

We didn't wanted to consume much as we had dinner to attend somewhere else. So we ordered for one iced americano, one iced choco mint, one blueberry cheesecake and one chicken Caesar salad. The best part of all the food was the salad. It was absolutely delicious. Even the cheesecake was really good, it melts in your mouth when you eat it.

I wanted to sit and spend more time there but we were in a rush so we left quite soon. I would, however, would want to spend more time there.

Definitely coming back there again to eat something else ( probably again the salad cause I loved it too much ). Keep it up!

Love this small set up in Quest's ground floor in front of lifestyle. They have now also expanded in front shop i saw the other day. The whole feel to the place is so French Cobbled roadside cafe type. Pinch in pocket 4/5, considering u facing Gucci , Armani while eating so why not. Jokes apart, less rating for the non-attentive staff. Don't know if it was because we were sitting in corner, but they were really not attentive..

Have gone to Quest many times but could never try this place. So today we finally went there, searching for some cheesecake. But we were hungry so ended up ordering a lot in the open, below-the-escalator space with crowds of people passing by and staring at our food (jeez no marks for the location)

Here's what we ordered
-Glass noodles and chicken salad- One of the best on the menu, it's a cold salad with chicken, glass noodles, capsicum and a tangy vinaigrette (copying masterchef lingo). The jus was amazing, I could have a bowl of it solo, and went well with the otherwise plain noodles. Chicken was soft. Great start and great on the taste buds.

-Fresh watermelon juice- request for no sugar. You wouldn't regret it.

-Chicken wrap- stuffed generously with chicken, cheese and veggies, great filler. Although I've had better at Mezzuna. Why would they serve it with Lay's chips though is still a mystery because the other dishes looked like they gave effort.

-Chicken panini sandwich- must comment on the potato wedges served as a side. Amazingly seasoned. The sandwich had ample cheese and chicken so I really can't complain. Better than the regular cafe (read CCD and coffee bean) sandwiches. Liked it.

Blueberry cheesecake- GOOD STUFF. I loved it. Creamy throughout with a salty biscuit crust and blueberry syrup dripping, it was such a great end to a nice lunch. Not too sweet or dense, really one of the best cheesecakes I've tasted in the city. 

The food was actually quite a saviour for the place with below average service and huge service time. A little pricey but spot on with the quality. Would recommend.

Located inside the luxury mall- Quest, this cafe looks very inviting and nice. Have been here a few times and honestly have found the experience to be average. 
The service here is very laid back and the staff are always disinterested! 

I have tried their chocolate milkshake, caramel latte, hot chocolate and pastries. 
The hot chocolate and caramel latte stand out and are worth a try. 
However the place is relatively expensive!

This place is situated at Quest Mall, mainly serves continental dishes , a definately noteworthy place with good ambience and staffs.
We tried Caramel crunch cake which was soft, mouth melting , good flavour, had balance in sweetness , was nicely baked, totally nailed it.
Then we tried, chocolate excess cake, since I am a chocolate lover. This cake was amazing too, nicely baked, soft, creamy, spongy flavoured with hot chocolate sauce.
Then we took perfect peach drink, which was a tasty and refreshing smoothie.
At last, we took Guava passion drink , which was very interesting , sweet and spicy and thus highly recommended.
Pocket pinch is bit high but quality is undoubtedly marvellous .

So today even though I was not hungry I decided to try this cafe if only for a cup of coffee. I must say the service is very very prompt and the coffee was very good. I have to come back and try out their nibbles which from what I saw all around were generous portions and quite popular with the crowd. All in all a nice place to leave your hubbies and explore the mall......They are definitely not going to complain.

Q33 came highly recommended, and as it is set in the vestibule of Quest mall it is a pretty popular hangout... However our experience is pretty adverse . We were group of 4 friends and we were refused seating in the pretext that all the empty tables were "reversed". And despite out walk about for over 30 mins those tables remained empty. We went back and demanded that we be seated. And they finally relented. The cold coffees we ordered were very basic and rather flat... And the chocolate brownie with ice cream was minuscule. The waiters were unattentive and the food were very average. I am sure Q33 has many qualities but they have failed to transpire them to me.... I shall not visit it again if I can help it!

Dec 2016

Visited Q33 today for a quick bite and some heart to heart with best buddy. We were both pleasantly surprised considering our previous brush. Both the hot chocolate and caramel Latte were great and the fish and chips with thickly cut potato wedges was amazing, served with a side of fresh salad and hot Mayo! It was amazing... The portion was generous and the fish was succulent and fresh!! So it is safe to say that Q33 has redeemed itself our good opinion !!!Sayantani Sen

after our lunch we came here for some desserts.
blue berry muffin, our all time favorite is something we always seek for and hence we ordered it.
this is a small joint with outside seating available at quest mall. service is good.
we also tried their mud tart which was delicious. i do not like chocolate very much but the proportion of its taste was excellent. we also had apple slice cake which was nice. all the 3 were covered in sugar icing.
the presentation was good.
i found the prices to be slightly on the higher side as compared to the dishes, maybe the location is the reason.
but overall a must visit for all sweet tooth.

Located on the ground floor of Quest, the ambience isn't ideal when you have shoppers staring at you eat. As for the food, it is a little on the expensive side although the quality is good. I personally loved the penne in vodka sauce but that has been discontinued. The 'oh my cookie!' and berry smoothie are refreshing and delicious. Although my experiences have been relatively good the 4-5 times I've been there , I don't find myself frequenting the place because of the numerous other options available at the mall

The place is on the ground floor of quest mall. 

We ordered Mud Tart. 
The waiter asked whether we'd like to add extra ice cream and sauce to it.
We said yes. 
The ice cream was still understood. 
But just one spoon of chocolate sauce worth rupees 50?
Although the tart tasted good, but taking additional charges for adding just a spoon-full of sauce to a tart (which should be added to it by default and on demand) was strange!

The Mango Summer Shake had a good quantity but a blank taste. Neither sweet, not creamy, nor mango-like. Wasn't as expected and the way it sounded.

Bad service. Food served not as per menu. 
A smoothie was too sweet and we returned for change. They tasted the drink from the same straw from our glass and added a shot to that drink and served us back. When complained, to tone down the whole scene they quickly then changed the drink. 
A corn jalapeno burger had no jalapeno in it and was instead spiced up using a mint dhaniya chatni.
Only the ambience is good, credit to the quest mall. Food and service not good.

Firstly , looking at the menu card we were like , "Could the menu card be any bigger?"
This place is basically an open space located at the ground floor of Quest Mall.
We ordered their warm chocolate pie with ice cream. It looks amazing as you will see from my picture. But it does not taste as good as it looks AT ALL!
Firstly, technically it is not a pie. It is actually a molten choco lava cake.
Secondly, the cake had WAY too much salt in it. With tax it was 228 bucks and as it looked so good I felt really sad because it tasted bad! :(

Had also ordered pancakes with maple syrup and fresh fruits. They were actually mini pancakes. A bit dry and not at all fluffy. Oh and the fresh fruit was nothing but scooped out tiny pieces of watermelon on a stick. Anyway, the service was ok. Price a bit on the higher side. A nice place to hangout.

We were a group of four who had some time to kill and were not really hungry. We thought we'd spend the time over some coffee and gossip. We saw a couple of empty tables at Q33 and thought we would go in there. However the waiters kept insisting that the tables were "reserved". We roamed around Quest Mall aimlessly and 30 minutes later those tables were still empty. This time when we insisted and pointed out the empty places and we were allowed to go and sit there. I still don't know who reserved those seats because they did not turn up all the time we were there.
We ordered glasses of cold coffee, which were pretty basic- nothing to write home about. The fudge brownie with Ice cream was also fine except that the portion was extremely tiny. All in all, my impression of Q33 was that it is an extremely pretentious place and I am not sure I would want to go back there.

Been here only once. Dont remember much about the food experience. All I'd like to say is that it's not a very good idea to have it in that open place on the ground floor of quest mall where anything may fall into your food, and u may or may not realise. I wouldn't eat here again because of this very reason.

Have stopped by quite a few times while shopping (usually window shopping :P)
Location: Inside Quest Mall in Ballygunge. 
Interior: Nothing great to talk about as its located inside the mall. 
Food & beverages: Hot beverages are really nice and you should definitely try their deserts. 
This place is quite nice. Great job.

A visit to Q33 for ¬†the 3rd time around wasn't lucky for us- in the 1st few visits, it had just been a stop over for a loaf of bread or a takeaway of their delicious chilli cheese toast or to pick up something sweet. And judging on the basis of those visits, this place was just fine.¬†

However, last evening (June 26, 2016), it was horrid from the start. First off, there was a very LOUD singer performing just adjacent to Q33 and we could not hear ourselves speak or think for most part of the 1.5 hours we spent there.¬†

The servers were just not able to handle the Sunday rush and we literally had to scream out 'Excuse Me!"to get their attention. They seemed to be running around like headless chickens!

And, one 3 separate occasions we were almost served what we had not ordered- once it was a non-vegetarian dish while we were only ordering the vegetarian ones. So, ironically, they were coming to our table when we didn't need them and not attending to us when we did want their help!

And, once we had placed our order, they were taking an extremely long time to get the order to our table.¬†

Ambience: -1 on 10

Next, we come to the beverages and food we ordered. The Small size Hot Chocolate was a mockery of Hot Chocolate- it tasted like a glass of milk with a dash of some sort of Chocolate powder. Two of us just downed it down as it was hot and helped relieve the sore throat we had. Terrible is an understatement. We almost sipped away our love for Hot Chocolate.¬†

Tentatively, we ordered for food- Vegetable Wrap, Spaghetti Arrabiata and Margherita. The wrap and pizza were nice. We ordered a second wrap since that was the most delicious of the lot. The Spaghetti was so-so, palatable but not delicious.¬†

We also ordered Cold coffee which was okay- too sweet for my liking.¬†

Food: 7 on 10
Beverages: 2 on 10

Overall, a poor experience. A great disappointment. We will think twice before stopping by Q33 again.

Went there for breakfast.. Really like their food very delicious but takes a lot of time to serve.. And a lot means a lot. Would have given a 4 star but we had to wait almost 20 to 30 mins for our food.. But apart from that the food are quite good you can go for a casual brunch or a little snack.

Just the food does not make a cafe or restaurant successful. My last experience with Q33 was very poor. When in rush hour, this cafe turns upside down. We did not get our order after waiting for 45 mins or so and the mall was shutting down. I had to cancel my part order which was undelivered. The portion of the order which we had received, was billed after 15 mins or so after asking. When I spoke to the manager he was not at all courteous. He said it happens and they cant help it. He did not even have the decency to apologise for the horrible service. Going here at rush hour might not be the right decision and you might end up thirsty and hungry.

Well last year when we visited quest mall, found this cafe at the ground floor of the quest mall. The ambience is nice and we went there with two of my friends.It was Sunday Evening and being a Coffee Lover how can I miss this place. So we ordered  Cold Coffee and the coffee was just awesome in taste. The pizza which we ordered it was margherita and the taste was good, would surely visit again.

Situated at the ground floor in quest mall just in front of lifestyle, this place is an open good joint which offers a variety of food, which is a good thing! What let's you down is the service. So yeah, when the ambience is good and the food is good but the service sucks, it kinda ruins your whole experience of the place. We ordered omlette and scrambled egg and a watermelon juice. The food was quite good.. But the time taken to deliver was enormous. Also, once we were done, they kept us waiting for twenty five minutes before we got the bill. There were other customers also there who were getting impatient. So if anyone from the management is reading this, id suggest you take care of your time management issues. Not going back unless absolutely necessary.

The rating is just for the desserts as we heard a lot about the desserts...so we tried Blueberry Cheesecake
Warm Chocolate Tart with Vanilla Ice cream
Chocolate Mud Tart

Warm Chocolate Tart with vanilla ice cream is a treat to the taste buds with the warm and cold coupling. A perfect blend of vanilla and chocolate
Blueberry Cheesecake is a bit low in sugar quotient but it was good as the other dishes were quite sweet. The nuts enhanced the dish.¬†
As we have heard positive comments about Chocolate mud tart we tried that as well. Taste is awesome with chocolate mud inside ans reasonably priced. But, a bit high on sweet quotient so choose the number of tarts accordingly.

Finally, coming to the decor and staffs. The ambience is great, located in the ground floor of Quest mall. But the staffs need training. They were a bit less attentive and hence need a brush up.

Today I went to Q33, Quest Mall! I wanted to go here for so looong! And the Veggie Pizza I had made it all worth it!? It was a thin crust pizza with a yummy soft layer of mozzarella cheese and various veggie toppings! üòç
The first bite made us go awestruck and then it became irresistible. üíúüòò
For a restaurant in a mall the price was also very reasonable considering the quality and taste as well!
I even had a dessert called 'chocolate eclairs'. It was sooo yummy! It had three layers with the bottom one of biscuit, then chocolate cream with chocolate chips and then the top layer was a kind of bread which reminded us of donuts. üòÄ Overall it was a tasty yummy filling dessert. üòçüòç

We were looking some peaceful options apart from the bustling food court inside Quest Mall. And to our utter surprise, We discovered this one in the ground floor. The cafe is almost open with it's pantry just beneath the escalator. The cafe offers various seating arrangements. The place is kept very clean and well maintained. Keeping in harmony, the waiters are very disciplined and cordial. Now, Let's come to the food. Their spread is small but each and every item in the spread is served with perfection at it's best. We had pizzas. mango summer drink and chocolate boat. Overall, I would enjoyed the time at Q33.

I had been to q33 a couple of days ago. Firstly,i loved how they've arranged the seating in a small but cosy place smack in the middle of the ground floor of the mall. You can watch people going in and out of the shops nearby and actually window shop while enjoying your food or just a cup of coffee. The ambience is like that of a typical European coffeeshop -warm and soothing.
Now coming to the food, i had tasted the margarita pizza,scrambled eggs,coffee paradise and chocolate mud tart. I loved all of them but probably loved the tart and drink more because of my sweet tooth. Full marks for the dessert section.
Would love to go back again sometime.

Recently tried there grilled chicken sandwich and espresso along with the butterscotch cupcake, well that was good enough for the quick bite,though sometimes they take a bit more time to serve the food,but otherwise it's great.

Located on the ground floor of the Quest Mall. Decorated in a very nice manner with great ambience. The waiters were quite friendly and sober. We had ordered for a Regular Cafe Moƒáha, Cappuccino, Blueberry Cheesecake & Chocolate Mud Tart with Vanilla Ice Cream.
Well to start with the coffee: Both the coffee were quite amazing. Had the perfect flavor not being too warm. Though the serving of the coffee was quite a lot but indeed a perfect one.
Blueberry Cheesecake - The Cheesecake was toothsome. The blueberry sauce on top was fresh and amazing. The flavor of the cheesecake was super delicious, sort of melted inside my mouth. Must try.
Chocolate Mud Tart with Vanilla Ice Cream - Tasted more like a brownie with powdered cocoa  and some liquidated chocolate. Though the vanilla ice cream wasn't on top but on the side. But it tasted good enough. Comparatively the cheesecake was better. 
The place is perfect for an evening coffee.

I founded a cafe and suffered the same aberrations this place is inflicted with.
Brilliant infrastructure in the form of great location in the ground floor of the quest mall,cool decor,muted colour palette and seemed a good place while I loaded my I pad pro in the adjoining Apple Store.
Cheese chilli toast and regular Americano it was.Coffee was served in ten minutes and on enquiring about the toast was told that I had never ordered it.On seeing my incredulity the person confessed that the waiter was new and confused.
I am more confused.Where have all the good servicemen for which Calcutta was once famous all gone?

This place was long there in my wishlist to visit. Yesterday we had been there for a snack in the evening after my college. It's a cafe located below the escalator of quest mall in the ground floor. This place has always tagged themselves as a luxury cafe for which people have refrained themselves from coming here. Yeah. It's true that the prices here a bit on the higher side for a cafe, still the mains are okay when compared with quality and quantity. 
We didn't intend to eat much that day. So we decided to go for Prawns Aioli, Chocolate Mud Tart and a Coffee Paradise.
The prawns were tender yet well cooked, all spices blended really well with it. I loved the smell of garlic and olive oil and the taste escalated when served with garlic bread. The coffee smoothie was good, crusted with walnut brownie. It was chilled, refreshing us enough after a long tiring day. But the best one was the mud tart. This is the best tart I have had till date. The tart base was soft yet crispy. Came out really well when broke with a fork. The milk and white chocolate frosting was like the cherry upon the cake. The ice cream and the hot chocolate sauce enhanced out taste buds to relish this dessert more and more.
Everything was fine at Q33. We enjoyed the food, the staffs were courteous, the ambience was nice, but the staffs need to be more trained about the course rules of a meal as they served us the dessert before prawns. Although when we asked to serve that later, they did this willingly. Otherwise this is really a nice place to sip a cuppa on a coffee date or enjoy your own company with a book or so. Happy Dining! :)

Just returned from q33. Nice place, I must say, as far as food and decor go. We ordered berry milkshakes and a prawn aoli. Milkshakes were pretty good, and the prawn was cooked to perfection, although I must say that the aoli was more of a garlic oil. Not many options on the menu, though, when there are only three choices for veg and two for non-veg appetizers. Breakfast menu needs more items too. There are comparatively more choices for the soups, salads and mains. Prices are quite on the higher side. The restaurant area seems to be understaffed  as well, although our server was very friendly and polite.
This is the first eatery where I was stopped from taking pictures, even when I mentioned they were for zomato. So I am attaching only those pictures which were taken long before the management intervened.

Chanced upon this little place one day while ambling my way through Quest Mall and instantly decided to sit down and try something out. The apple strudel was unavailable and so decided to go for the Cheesecake and truth be told, it was probably the best Cheesecake I ever had in Calcutta. It was superbly creamy and the best part being the use of real blueberries instead of the use of ¬†standard blueberry compote like everywhere else. I haven't tried any other thing on their menu, primarily because the place is a bit overpriced. After all who charges 250 bucks for standard breakfast pancakes?

Q33 is a small-big cafe located around d escalator on d ground floor of Quest mall.
I went der with a friend during d pujas for a little conversation. Little did i know dat dis cafe would so amaze me.
The cafe is crucially planned in a relatively lesser space area but it looks elegant.
The space was relatively empty but soon started filling up & at one point of time it was choc-a-bloc with people. The chairs were aesthetically designed. The couches were super comfortable.
My friend told me to have d Chicken Laksa soup & i was very determined to order it. God's grace, i wasnt disappointed. It had a smooth creamy texture with chicken chunks, cherry tomatoes, mushrooms & broccolli. The lemon stem added to d excellency of this masterpiece. Everything from the quantity to d smell was brilliant about it.
We next ordered d Cuban Chicken Panini sandwich alongwith d Raspberry yoghurt freezer & a mango mousse. D sandwich was crunchy & creamy, a combination which is killer. The freezer was very refreshing & it smoothened d palate.
D waiter service was very generous & friendly.
Overall, dis cafe, though small, holds a very high place in my heart.
Will be hoping to see more of its branches opening up pretty soon

This place. Such lip smacking desserts! It's in the ground floor of Quest Mall. In spite of the hustle and bustle of the crowd, this pretty little cafe offers a cheery ambiance and lovely decor. The service is really commendable; the staff is friendly and efficient. As for the food, I've only tried the desserts. We took the Warm Chocolate Tart with vanilla ice cream and a Caramel Crunch (with whipped cream as an add-on). The Tart was simply delicious, with a delightful molten chocolate filling and the perfect crunchiness of the crust. The Caramel Crunch was pretty good too, and the even the whipped cream and ice cream had great texture and quality. Though it was quite pricey, I'd say the food was worth the money. I shall definitely visit again to try out the other sections of their menu!

I wont say much about the ambiance in general, because it is located at the ground floor of Quest Mall.

Comfortable seating arrangements, it has a nice feel to it, once you stepped in.

Now coming to the food:

1. Chilly Cheese Toast : Really tasty. Soft, crunchy. I kinda liked it, as I was actually bored of the same old garlic bread stick, served at Pizza Hut and Dominoes etc

2. Chicken Ceasar Salad : Though not a very strong proponent of having salad at the expense of 300 bucks, but this dish really changed my conception about it. It was really delicious. Though with the amount of cheese and mayo the healthy quotient of salad was long lost, but it was a totally wonderful dish

3. Penne a la Vodka: Being a whisky lover, and not a vodka just because its essentially is sweet, still opted for it.. To my surprise considering the preparation to be creamy and thick I just loved it to an extent that now I prefer having Pasta at Q33, over Sphagetti Kitchen, Afraa Deli etc.¬†

To sum it up, although its not very light on pocket yet I truly savored each and every dish. Someone tired of the same old places in Quest, this one is a delight.

This cafe is on the Ground floor ...Quest Mall under the escalator near lifestyle.......its great early am or late evening......coz then one doesn't get too many people watching you eat your meal.......terrific Menu....good choice ....food is very tasty......I had the Chicken Salami Pizza and my husband had the chicken steak in mushroom sauce.....Both dishes were Awesome.....also the smoothies were delicious ...peach& yogurt......highly recommendedüëåüëç.
We were going to top up our meal with the lovely pastries on the counter but sadly it was not meant to be because the impatient staff kept pestering us to find out if we wanted anything from the kitchen ....3 different staff asked us in a matter of 5 mins if we would be ordering anything else.....my reply was some cakes...... This was during our main course.....then another member of staff comes along and asks me which cakes I will be ordering.......This was very off putting during ones meal and We decided against the afters which I was soo looking forward to having....Please train your staff not to harass clients during their meals coz they are in a rush to close shop....It was only 9.45pm......Overall food is good but Serviceüëé needs improvement.......your staff are letting you down.

Went there couple of days ago post-work around 6ish and it was relatively empty. The ambience of the place is pretty good.. At first,  Ordered Chef's Special Vegetarian soup. It was made in tomato pure√© with vegetables in it..was served with one slice of garlic bread and tasted good. Also ordered Chicken Puff, and 2 milkshakes, Strawberry Twist and Mango Summer. Served in tall sleek glasses, they just looked refreshing, tastewise both were very average, too watery.. Absolutely not worth the money. Puff was okay. Giving a 3 for the ambience which I liked. Rest is extremely average. They need to look into serving proper food n drinks.

Had the typical English breakfast after a long time. It was really healthy and appetizing at the same time. The staff was very courteous. The fresh fruit and the cereal is a basic healthy breakfast necessity. The whole breakfast composed of milk n cereals, freshly cut fruits - Watermelons, papaya and banana, omelette , veg sandwich, potato wedges, coffee and watermelon juice. I would definitely recommend visit this place on a Sunday morning for a great summer Sunday start. Needless to say a very satisfied experience with a great ambiance to take good photos as well...

One of the worst cafe ever visited on 28/08/15¬†
Employee seems good and quality even is up to the mark, though we had tried only cappuccino and peach based cooler. But seems one of his Boos , no idea who was that ¬†person sitting in restaurant fatty tall old man claiming himself as owner of Q3 or the Mall itself , do not know how to behave with customers.He was so rude and embarrassing that we had left the restaurant without eating anything. Carry on with this attitude Gentleman and we are sure one day you will pay for that.

If you think you're rather well-acquainted with Continental food, allow the unique, lip-smacking food at Q33 to open your eyes. Situated at ground floor of Quest Mall, this friendly casual restaurant serves Continental food with a twist. Offering really affordable set breakfast & lunch, consider this a good option if you're in the area. The food here is authentic, generous, and generally noteworthy.

Our order was very basic as we planned to sit back & relax here after whole day heavy meal. We ordered Caramel Crunch and Chocolate Excess Cake as desserts accompanied with Perfect Peach & Guava Passion to quench our thirst.

A must-try dessert is their Caramel Crunch - a truly innovative dessert topped with a layer of dark caramel sauce, whipped cream, caramel drizzle, and crunchy caramel. The Caramel Crunch was a very well executed piece of mouth melting surprise ‚Äì charred to perfection, wonderfully buttery and packs a punch of flavour. What's truly enticing about a good dessert is balance of sweetness, and the one at Q33 totally nails it with their Caramel Crunch.

The Chocolate Excess Cake was excellent as well: baked flawlessly and served with hot chocolate sauce. The Chocolate Excess Cake here was soft, light and airy. The Chocolate Excess Cake will delight those who love chocolate, with its strong flavour. If you're hankering for a really indulgent dessert and have mad love for chocolate, then you're going to want to get your hands on it. Its super smooth, extra chocolaty, rich, creamy showered with hot chocolate sauce.

One sip of Perfect Peach made me refreshed. Fresh peaches and frozen yogurt bring fruity deliciousness to this smoothie. It‚Äôs a perfect drink for this rainy season.

On the other hand Guava Passion was an interesting drink. The sweet guava was a great compliment to the chilly added taste, and the sweetness and spicy flavours work surprisingly well together. This surprise fizzy cooler was definitely mood lifting.

On the whole it was a nice experience in Q33. Not the cheapest, but check them out for the high quality of food served.

Just another Sunday n I decided to take my mom for some shopping .... After that we decided to chill over a cup of coffee ... Must say it was d a bad decision ... We ordered a cup of cappuccino and lemon iced tea... No evening is complete without some snacks so we picked up jalape√±o popper which was out of the menu but served for the day.. The person informs that it's not available anymore .. So we settle for a chili cheese toast ..the person who was taking out orders informs us that the toast would take time so shall he serve d drinks before ... we were ok with it... Food comes before after 3-4reminders the coffee came n it's a cold cappuccino and then another 2-3 more reminders and the iced tea comes .. Then we order a pizza and reconfirm with the guy if it's a thin crust ... He says yes and says to make it crispy it would take 20mins ... Busy in our chitchats .. We wait till for 30mins to be served semi thick crust ... 
Disaster !! These guys don't even know what they serve ... 
Why keep such untrained staffs ...
And the pizza was not done well at all ... we had sent it twice to get it crispy but d result the same !! 
What a disaster to a Sunday evening with family !!

The appetizers are good. The prawn aioli was nice, and so were the drinks. The Khao Suey could have been better, the service surely needs to be faster, and during our time we heard a couple of customers complain about the coffee being served cold etc. Overall, a so-so experience. Not worth the price premium they charge.

Hi foodies!

This would rather be a short review as I had tasted only one item, that too, something which is not on their usual menu.

-Decor- 
The strategic location of the outlet inside Quest Mall is something which may intrigue certain people but I found it rather to be an invasion of privacy. The seating arrangement is right below a busy escalator where people can directly look down at you while they get up or down the escalator. 

-Food-
The item that I had ordered (Chicken Mortadella Burger) is part of a burger festival that they had (Yes I love burgers!) and this particular item came highly recommended. Last I heard, they planned to implement the burgers into their regular menu. Apart from the sub-standard fries and dip they offered, I found the burger to be tasty. The salami was of very good quality. However, they could've provided a bit more mayonnaise to avoid the dryness. 

-Endnote-
I feel this review does not do justice entirely and so I will try to post another review with items from their regular menu (if I can get a proper private seating arrangement).

Bon Apetite. :)

Worst experience ever with the floor manager who refused to seat us. I was with my elderly uncle and aunt and we were made to stand indefinitely, and wait while others came in later and were seated. The manager was alerted to this but he said those people came much before although this was not the case. He refused to note down our name to keep us in the queue in the first place. I asked for his name so I could speak to the head manager but be refused to give me his name or that of the head manager. Please check who was on duty at 6.20 pm on Sunday 27 December and ask him to apologize to me. My uncle and aunt was shocked by this behaviour. I shall warn all my friends off this place if an apology is not offered asap. Disrespectful and@ unprofessional!!

Went here twice over a 15 day trip to Calcutta, but that was more because of the convenient location. And both times I was highly disappointed. The food was decent but the main problem was the staff. I don't know how they run a cafe at this location with such horrible staff. During my lunch I had to get up at least 4 times to ask for the menu, to place my order, etc etc. Extremely inefficient and grumpy people. I would never recommend it to anyone. If they had better service, given the location and the food I am sure it could be one of the better cafes in the city. However, as of now a big thumbs down.

The concept of an open cafe within the mall is quite nice and perfect for tired shoppers or a quick lunch/ coffee. 
However, more than often the servers seem to be at a loss in the maze like structure of the eatery. Service tends to be slow. 
I was in mood for a dessert break and ordered my all time favorite dessert, a slice of Blueberry Cheesecake and a Butterscotch Eclair.  
The cheesecake's presentation was quite unappetizing and the taste was even worse. They made the cheesecake with a substitute for cream-cheese, which hadn't set in yet. 
The Butterscotch Eclair on the other hand was a delight with every bite! I was amazed with this dessert especially since I'm not too fond of butterscotch as a flavor.

Q33, I am very impressed. This restaurant is one of a kind. Situated below the escalator in the ground floor of the Quest makes it completely different. It serves you one of the tastiest and best quality food in Kolkata.
I and my mom visited this restaurant for lunch. The seating arrangements were cool. The service was awesome and the food was even better. The sandwich "Q33" and the panini from your signature sandwiches was superb. Then the khowsuey was something I tried which was completely different and just so good. I also the blueberry pastry which was very good. 
I would have rated this restaurant 5 out of 5. But this restaurant has limited menu although it has a variety of desserts. I will visit this restaurant many more times because the food is quite tasty but one cannot visit it to try different items every time he/she visits.

Finally decided to try out this place after my infinite visits to quest mall.. this place is nicely decorated with a classy touch both in the ambience as well as in the food varieties in the menu card..  we ordered a margarita pizza and a cafe latte. The pizza was surprisingly delicious. With its thin crusts and the mouth watering cherry tomatoes and mozzarella toppings, we loved it so much that we ended up ordering another one! The coffee was average.. rather I think there are better places in the mall to have some great coffee time.. and yes, frankly the prices are high and I didn't really feel that the food was worth it.. according to me this place is not suitable for casual unplanned hangouts with college friends.
.....   and the name q33 remained a mystery till the end!!

The place tries too hard.
An interesting menu but the cheese on the chilli cheese sandwich is overloaded with cheese......

The service starts courteously and the orders taken with attention and the food arrives in just the right time for a coffee shop. 
But a chap appears towards the end of your meal and tells you 'others are waiting for your table'

Located under the escalator one can‚Äôt help wondering if the dust from the shoes of people on it is silently settling on your food..

The pricing borders on just above value for money and leaves you wondering has it been worth it? 
Sooner rather than later the regulars will figure out wisdom of relaxing in the large food court upstairs ‚Äì wider choice and no one tell you your table is needed

This is a good place for casual dining. There's a limited menu which is good in a way. When I went with a friend we tried the lemon grass cooler , which is very refreshing and had lasagne, the lamb burger and pizza. The pizza was okay , but the other two dishes were good. Desserts are good too. You can try any of the desserts. Overall it's a good place with above average quality of food.

A chance visit to the outlet.... Situated at the ground floor of Quest mall the place is pretty neat and contemporary. 
Menu is not really elaborate but believe the quality is better than most of the outlets serving continental grub. Prawn cocktail, caesar salad, grilled fish n chicken were really nice ( tried it with mushroom sauce which could have been a bit more thick in its consistency even though thats a personal liking). 

However they could do more with the service... Especially the tables which seat two are not visible from the counter and its quite cumbersome to look out for the waiters in case u want to order something more or just request a refill for ur glass of water. Also incase there are two of you make sure u tell the waiter to serve the both of you together as they might serve you first and your partner might get served once you are through!!!!!

My first visit to Quest and boy was I impressed !!!! Beautiful mall.... An array of brand name stores. Rolex, Canali, MK, Guess, lifestyle.... I had New Saurashtra Gujrati bf that morning n we were on our way to Tung Fong.... I needed a quick bite for a fill in or in between to be precise. We stopped at Q3 and the display was rustic, presentable n very appealing. We decided to order some cold coffee n Black Forest pastry to go with it... What I loved about the place is the open air feel, people walking by you n the undivided attention of the folks working there. Lot of attention to details. Check it out for yourself.  It's not cheap but then you are in Quest ...you are allowed to indulge!

As soon as you enter this new, swanky mall located near park circus, Quest, at 7 point crossing,   you would be amazed by this nicely done eatery located at the ground floor lobby area. Q33 is a casual dinning food joint with ideal coffee shop menu wherein you can be assure of spending quality time with peers and colleagues after work or just to plan your shopping spree schedule or just to discuss any random topics or just chill and pamper yourself. Well, having said that I wnould also like to add that being located inside this posh mall, expect the menu not to be very pocket friendly.  But yes, portion size will justify the prices as we found everything that we ordered were total value for money. The only thing where they need to improve upon is speed of service.  Although it wasn't very crowded, oue orders for cold coffee and a spicy guava based drink took almost 15 min to arrive.  This could be lil frustrating at times. I like the idea of keeping few coffee table reads for patrons.  Do visit if you plenty of  leisure time and want to experiment with your taste buds. Try any of the smoothies.

Fairly nice place,a bit on the expensive side but that's very evident because it's located inside quest mall! 
We ordered a couple of cold coffees ( whipped cream was not available, though it's clearly mentioned in the menu ),a chilli cheese toast, a chicken khowsuey and pancakes. 
The presentation of the food is nice, taste wise could be a little better, though the chicken khowsuey was more or less perfect. The pancakes served with fresh fruits and butter were soft and good to eat. The cold coffee was too sweet to drink, didn't like it at all nor could finish the drink. 
Staff is attentive and efficient. The restaurant is an open place inside a mall, decor is moderate and humble. Magazines and books have been kept so that one can enjoy a good read while enjoying a cup of steaming hot coffee or tea. 
All in all a good place to hang out. Will surely come back, hopefully the little things which are missing now will be taken care of by then.

Surprisingly good! I'm not really into restaurants in malls but this place makes a killer lemongrass tea (cold) and laksa. The omelette was great too! Good at listening to customer preferences - I asked for my laksa to be medium spicy and they did a great job of a traditionally spicy dish without compromising on the taste.

Visited Q33 last evening. Wasn't feeling comfortable enough as it is located just next to lifestyle and so many people were passing by. After waiting for a while waiter came with two giant menu card. Size wise it was giant but options are very less esp in non veg items and all boring. We ordered a chicken mushroom pizza, a mocktail. I ordered cafe latte and told the waiter to serve it before pizza. But it came late. Pizza was good but not out of the world. Don't have any idea how the mocktail was as my boyfriend ordered it..  Overall the place is OK type.

Nice place. I had went there with my family and some friends. We sampled several dishes and liked all of them including the mezzo platter. The standout was the grilled fish. I am definitely having it the next time I am there.

Where do I begin?? Each and every visit of mine to this joint has been lip smacking delicious, making me come back for more and more..being located very close to my house, quest mall is now my regular hangout and Q33 is fast becoming my favourite.
 
Ambience - Located on the ground floor below the escalator,first thing i notice is the clever utilisation of space.The decor and setting is classy and once you are seated, you will forget that you are in a crowded mall.

Food - I am in love with their flavours.. I suggest you try the following

   ‚ñ™Fish n chips- I would say, this is undoubtedly the BEST fish n chips available in Kolkata. ..hands down winner and a must try.. the fish is soooo fresh and the batter so light and crispy... please try it          ( btw it is not written on the printed menu but is available)

‚ñ™ Khowsuey- Aromatic and filling enough for two...really good dish

‚ñ™ Coffee- Normal..I liked the americano, and vanilla latte.

‚ñ™ Pumpkin soup- It was the special of the day and I am glad I ordered it....never imagined that a vegetable soup could be so tasty. I am in awe.

 Actually, I end up ordering the fish everytime but I intend to try more on the menu. 

Price- A bit high but worth every penny considering the quality and taste

Suggestions- Put fish n chips on the regular menu..And please explain what Q33 stands for.
Keep up the great work!!

The price is a bit too high for the fare they offer.If you must try it the aioli prawns are real good and so is the chicken steak in mushroom sauce.These are the only dishes I found worth ordering and which justify the rates.The ceasar salad I ordered had minuscule amounts of chicken and really dry bread along with it and the other salads too failed to surprise me.Its menu offers standard continental fare with a few Mediterranean options thrown in.Not worth it.

Location: Ground Floor, Quest Mall, Beck Bagan. 

Q33 had been on my visit list from a pretty long time and I was unable to give it a try for some or the other reason! May be 2014 wasn't meant for a visit here coz‚Äô I could make it here without any obstacles in the beginning of 2015! :P
 I was out with my family on a casual shopping round and were tired henceforth needing a bit of energy to get going again! So landed up here for a coffee break and a light snack.

About the PLACE & AMBIANCE, it's located beside the escalator towards the left from the entrance on the ground floor of Quest Mall. The chalk-styled menu on the wall with the loaf-stands on both sides at the entrance and the dessert case underneath the counter gives a classic look to its ambiance. The seating arrangements have been strategically planned below the escalator in a spherical fashion to make the most out of the space constraint. The interiors have been thoughtfully done to give it an American-type look with those classic watches hanging on the open cupboard inside the seating area and those showpieces, artificial creepers which add on to its elegance. You might be sitting amidst a crowded place, but, you would still feel away from it. 

About the ORDER, the menu looked like a big placard with text on both the sides. A well-drafted menu but, with limited options. After a bit of contemplation, ordered the following:

- Caf√© Latte (Regular)
A mild coffee with a slightly creamy texture. A sachet of brown sugar in it and it tastes heavenly. A couple of sips made me love it, but, I prefer a stronger one so ordered a cappuccino for myself. Nevertheless, Caf√© latte was great. 

- Cappuccino (Small)
I being an ardent lover of strong yet slightly sweet coffee, stuck to cappuccino and requested it to be a bit stronger than usual. Bang on! Got what I expected. A pretty strong coffee which tasted amazing with an add-on of a one and a half sachet of sugar. A smile on my face. *Ting* :)

- Chili Cheese Toast (6 pieces)
We just wanted something light along with our coffees, so called for this. Six pieces of diagonally cut toast (three slices) with a generous amount of cheese and a correct balance of green chillies was served alongside rocket leaves, ketchup and wafers. Also, had a couple of drops of sandwich spread for presentation, but, yes it complimented well if spread on the toast. The rocket leaves though didn't seem fresh. The toast as a standalone was good to it, but, having stale stuff alongside was bit of a turnoff.

About the SERVICE, had a good start as we were welcomed with a warm smile and were shown our seats, but, it started to take a downhill route when I had to call the serve a couple of times for penning the order and regular water. Thereafter, the service was back on toes, prompt and zero lapse. Wish it would have been a consistent one. :)
An update on it coming soon on the basis of future visits.

About the trained and uniformed STAFF, they were polite, courteous and well-informed about the menu.

About the PRICES, Q33 is a moderately priced place.

Overall was a decent experience. 
- Would revisit soon for the rest of the fare. 
- Heard the pizza and pesto pasta are great. These are on my next order list here, comments would be updated soon.

A cute little place on the ground floor of the quest mall is a place to hangout to avoid crowd or rush hour times at other joints of the same mall. Ordered a fried chicken sandwich and a Cappuccino Regular. The sandwich was good, sadly missed out on trying out desserts. Overall service was fast and good. The place loses its edge to other cafes on the price section, as they are on the higher side. Saying that it certainly deserves a visit from regular college goers who are looking for a good place to eat and hangout!

At the peak hours, this one is a better option, to avoid the crowd. So we went in, nice, comfortable couches. The waiter came with the BIG menu cards, that somehow caught our eyes. We ordered for Fried Khowsuey Noodles and Caramellato but the waiter was insisting to try some more dishes which we could not since we were already half full. A weird thing happened when I asked for WiFi (lately I am a little fussy about WiFi connections), the manager insisted on putting the password by himself and not divulging us the details. But as soon as the food came, all of these went out of my head, the Caramellato was absolutely delicious, and the Khowsuey had a nice curry taste with a twist that absolutely went well with the lemon they served and the fried noodles. Quantity-wise it was sufficient to be shared between two people if you are looking for something small (like us). Only thing is I would complain about is that the prices are a little bit high, but worth a try.

Yesterday while i was in quest mall me and my friend had a sudden craving for desserts so decided to try out this cute little joint by the name of Q33. We really liked the sitting arrangements and quickly made ourselves comfortable. The staffs were helpful and without even asking for suggestions they eagerly told us to try out their Irish pastry(I hope i have the correct name) which was approximately priced at Rs. 125 and for drink we ordered coffee paradise which was Rs.125. The pastry was amazing as it was so light and fluffy. In spite of being quite big in size we still did not feel uneasy after consuming so much of sweet. I will definitely try it again and the drink was very tasty and the quantity was satisfying. One can hang out in this place for a long time and this place really brought out my laid back attitude. Next time i would definitely try out other items apart from desserts.

This review is based on a solitary purchase from this outlet, situated on the Ground floor of Quest Mall. Our daughter was hungry and we asked for a Black Forest pastry. She just had a couple of spoonfuls and I had the remainder. It was dry, and tasted completely synthetic, like one would expect from a pastry costing Rs 20. There seemed no fresh cream at all. Hurts even more when they charge you about Rs 180 for it.

The place is otherwise reasonably attractive, with seating outside the main store. Service is at the table.

Location: ground floor of quest mall. The place is open without any walls. Furnishings are sobre and pastel shades suits the decor.
After shopping or window-shopping its a nice place for some rest.

Menu: the menu has got a nice variety. This is one of those rare places in kolkata where one can get fresh fruit gateau without giving prior order. As i have soft corner for coffee with cake, i opt for that at this place as well. Its nice. The gateau is ok, not great.

Service: nothing remarkable, no complaints to be made though

Price: once in a while its ok to chill here with dearest ones, considering one doesnt mind the seldom glances of the passer bys.:D

A very new joint in kolkata's Quest mall.
We ordered Q33 platter which the staffs suggested us which contained assorted breads served with hummus, muhammara, creme cheese relish and caramel Llato. Hummus served was brilliant. Haven't had such a dip for a long time, got the flavours of mashed chickpea, olive oil and tahini. Haomemade mayonaise left  me drooling
But we were disappointed by Caramel Llato. It was nothing but cold coffee served with chocolate sauce and caramel syrup-A strict no no.
Ambience was good and dats what we mostly liked about the place.

I am very disappointed with this place s service.As in I had given my debit card for the payment of a small bill of Rs 282/-only but the receipt never came out from the machine of these people but the amount got debited from my account.And this incident took place twice.And after that also these people took the money in cash from me and they committed me that the amount which was deducted from my debit card would be refunded back in my account in 6 working days maximum.But after 9 working days they asked me for my bank statement and all and started making stupid excuses for lingering the things.Its not a matter of 550/-odd bucks but it's about the giving your clients a word for something and not doing it.Hopeless place shall never visit again and I would also request all guests to beware of this kind of shit.

So I'm extremely obsessed with this place and I literally LOVE it ! Thanks to bf for insisting that I check this place out !! 
So where should I start from ? 
I love the food , I love the service. I love the ambience and everything else !! 
Just one extreme complain, that is this place should add more to it's menu cus it's extremely limited. 
So I ordered Pizza , penne in vodka sauce , Black Forest cake and today morning I had soup from here ! 
Pizza ~ this was a thin crust pizza with spicy chicken , jalape√±o and mushrooms. 
This was perfectly made and I wanted to eat more. I think that says enough. 
Pasta ~ one word for it FREAKING PERFECT !!! 
Actually two words. I loved it ! The vodka creamy sauce was just soooooo good ! I absolutely loved how the spices , the chicken the vodka sauce all blended in perfectly. 
Black Forest cake ~ *sigh* this was also really good. 
Soup ~ coming to this one. Well this was good but not the best , the lemon grass taste was way too rich, which isn't bad but it turned out to be a little bitter. But anyway it was also pretty good. 
Surprisingly the bill was as reasonable as 1200 !! :D

1stly the location of this restaurant in Quest is definitely a huge advantage. After a hectic shopping at Lifestyle this is exactly where you would want to sit down and relax and rest your feet! And of course you cant leave without tasting whatever is on offer!¬†

Oh my cookie! was definitely kept my hopes afloat as got a heady dose of chocolate rush. Caesar Salad was pretty perfect as well. We tried the Q-33 hoping for something very special, after all thats the name of the place. But it was just another hot dog served with a slightly exotic relish. But the disappointment part was the Chicken Khowsuey. Taste-wise everything was perfect, but i searched with a microscope but it was next to impossible to find more than 2-3 tiny chicken shreds in a bowl of Khowsuey! In the end the bill comes definitely at par with the stature of the place. Now I have always loved paying for my food to be perfect in all sense - quality and quantity. The latter is missing here. I will rate the place solely based on the food quality about which I have no complaints. Lets see if my view changes after 2-3 more visits!

As the sales season have hit hard ,like everyone mall hopping has climbed up my priority list ‚Äìand yes it was during one of these days that I found myself at Q33 at ground floor of QUEST MALL . I went there with  a friend of mine for the first time and then loved it so much that went back again within a week just for that APPLE STRUDEL & MONTE CARLO ¬† !! the LEMONGRASS COOLER was refreshing at its best . I quite liked the open yet cosy and comfortable arrangement of the place which has something very warm about it . I do plan to go back for a proper meal

I passed through this place so many times whenever I visit Quest ... But today I felt like trying out this place as I was waiting with a friend for my sister to come. so we settled at the outdoor seating there.
Since I had less time I wanted to order for some quick stuff ordered for a watermelon n creamy feta  which wasn't available so I opted for a lemon grass cooler instead which was more than average . I couldn't finished the full tall glass rather ¬†I had only half as my sister had already arrived outside hence I asked for the cheque and wow what I see is the cheque comes in a blue cup instead of any folders and I really liked that something different hhhhhmmm must say liked the idea and concept.
¬†What I liked about this place is the out door seating very comfortable n be your own as it got its own charm watching all type of people coming going neways one more thing which is ¬†like icing on the cake is ¬†free wifi ¬†what else do you want ?? overall nice place to be. will surely love to go more often.  
one must try its affordable too.

Well it was a normal order ,that is Cold coffee with ice cream (my favorite) !
It seemed to me almost like Cafe coffee day...but yaa with some added food platter obviously which includes proper lunch/dinner also.
Little bit pricey. For 2 cold coffee with ice cream..it happened to be Rs.450 . I thought it was a bit too much..anyway.. price conception may vary from person to person.
Otherwise,seating arrangement and the decoration was really cozy and cute.. I liked it.

Tired of shopping ? Sit down there and order great food..You will like there :)

Happy Eating guys ! :)

After a wonderfully depressing movie we wanted to just indulge in chocolate and some more chocolate. We went in here, which is a wonderfully classy and innovative place in the mid of the mall (center of a corner to be precise) but still the ambience leaves a mark. 
We ordered for hot chocolate and hazelnut mousse. Well the mousse was just awesome. So much so that we licked clean the glass with everyone staring at us and we just didn't care because we were in our happy place after a heartbreaking movie. 
Next came in the hot choco which was okay, not that great. The others loved it though while I was still relishing my mousse aftertaste. 
The bill came ‚Çπ400 but the mousse was just worth it!

My mom, grandmother and I visited Quest Mall today for a bite to eat. I noticed a new cafe in the courtyard and sped off in that direction. Q33 reminded me pleasantly of the open cafes prevalent in the atrium areas of malls abroad. The decor, ambience and menu looked great, so we settled for this as our stop. We ordered three cups of Assam tea, two plates of Chilli Cheese Toast, one tomato & mozzarella sandwich, a blueberry muffin, a chocolate muffin and a piece of English fruitcake. The savoury items and the tea arrived within 15 minutes. The plating was visually appealing and reminded me of the dishes we see on Masterchef! However, the portion sizes left much to be desired. The cheese toast consisted of five or six little rounds per plate, accompanied by sweet-and-sour sauce, topped with attractive-looking but tasteless greens. The toast itself was nice, and my mom and grandmother each have small appetites, but I wouldn't have been satisfied with it! My sandwich was open-faced and grilled - again, impeccable flavour, but just not filling enough. We were very happy with the tea, though. And the desserts were generously-sized and surprisingly light. I've had a ton of muffins in my time, and these were different in that they were much lighter and airier than similar ones in other cafes (though I can't say I mind heavy smooshiness when I want some indulgence!)
Our bill came to INR 1618. It's a luxury cafe, so I can understand the prices. I also understand the fancy plating and smaller portions quintessential to gourmet dining. But in a cafe - not both. If they want to charge these rates, they really should up the portion sizes. Most customers at meal times are hungry and want much more filling dishes. Taste wise I'm quite satisfied, but I have to say that my muffin was the major component of the meal. They should rectify this - it's the only thing keeping them from being full-blown awesome. 
Final verdict - top-notch ambience and delicious food, but it's best reserved for evening coffee with an accompanying dessert.

We were lured in the by the nice ambiance of the place. But as we all know the looks can be deceptive. We ordered a cappuccino, a Darjeeling tea and a lava cake. The coffee was middling at the best, although they charged 150 bucks (both CCD and Barista have much much much better coffee for lesser price). For the tea, they gave half a cup of lukewarm water with a Twinnings tea bag next to it and charged 110 bucks for that (I would understand the pricing if they were brewing the tea like any decent coffee/tea joint). The lava cake wasn't t to my liking as well although I am no expert, it just tasted wrong somehow. Anyways, apart from the food, the service was pretty good. However, I would definitely avoid this place. Booooooo

When I went to Q33 I actually had a good bit of expectations, thanks to the really good review I have heard - and I decided to drop in twice before I realized both times I was pretty disappointed. The first time, I did not have much time to peruse the meal, so decided on a quick Cappuccino and dessert - however, the desserts really did not look too great, so satisfied myself with the coffee. It was really good, I have to say, but the service left A LOT, and I do mean a LOT to be desired - I mean, I was made to wait for nearly 20 minutes for one coffee bill to appear before me - and after telling the server no less than three times. REALLY??? The second time, I was there with a friend and we decided on the coffee paradise milkshake for her and a latte for me. Again, coffee was very good, and AGAIN, the service was atrocious !!! We asked for regular water, and it came AFTER we had finished our drinks. Sorry Q33 but you have to improve upon service before I can be more generous.

A "full-filling" evening bite & sip at the luxury caf√©!! We ordered for Mumbai Xpress sandwich which was served alongwith crispy potato wedges, a small serving of salad, mint chutney and tomato sauce. We relished it! Lemon Grass Cooler, though cooled the throat, was disappointing. We had to ask for a little sugar syrup to get some taste. Oh My Cookie was Oh so awesome!! All chocolate lovers will surely guzzle it down. So overall its good. Though I felt its slightly overpriced yet I would love to revisit the place to try out some other items.

Dear Q33 if you are calling yourself a "luxury cafe" you gotta buck up guys. I get excited everytime something new opens in kolkata but I was mighty disappointed. Don't get fooled by the decor and stuffs coz if you ain't serving good food you ain't gonna go anywhere. I ordered a very simple watermelon and feta salad and what I got was a plate of watermelon scoops full of seeds! If I am willing to dish out Rs.400+ for something the least you can do is de seed the melon! We also ordered for a bread platter which the menu said has an assortment of breads but what was served was few cracker type bread and a few pieces of a kind of flat bread.  The dips that came along was however nice. Before I end I should add that the hot chocolate was very nice considering my very fussy 6 year old finished a glass of it.

This Cafe is somehow the "luxury cafe', although I fail to understand why! Its situated on the ground floor, on the common mall ground by Lifestyle and Imagine stores. Air conditioning is that of the Mall's which wasnt very comfortable when I had gone to visit. Menu choices are restrictive but Staff is extremely attentive and polite. Service is decent as well.

Now the food! Ordered for a Lemongrass Cooler, which albeit refreshing,wasnt to our liking; Razzmataaz, a raspberry yoghurt smoothie, which was too sweet, but I didnt have a problem with it! I kinda liked it, plus it was heavy!! A Blackened Chicken and Couscous salad was ordered. It was good. Shredded chicken on a couscous bed. There was a side as well but I'm not aware of what it was, as it wasnt my ordered dish. Since I have a thing for fish, I ordered for the only fish main that they had, a Tandoori Spices Marinated Fish! I LOVED the fish, it was extremely flavourful! Served with two sauces, one Chili Tamarind and the other Kasundi. I did feel that the portions were a tad bit small,considering the price but maybe this is what they meant by the term "luxury cafe"!! It came with a small salad side and spinach sauteed and placed on the fish.

Desserts were on display at the counter and they looked heavenly but we didnt order any as we were pretty full by then.

The price of the abv, plus taxes and service charge, was a little over 1400 bucks.

I would go back again, if not for anything but for the heavenly looking desserts!!
