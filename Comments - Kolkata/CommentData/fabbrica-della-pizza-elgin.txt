Great food, ambience was great. Interiors are beautifully decorated, gives a feeling of the pizza joints in Italy. Quite creative with the menu and serving pattern. I had the pollo piccante among the non vegeterian pizzas. It was a burst of flavours from the pesto and also the roast and spiced chicken. And also they make them fresh and serve them within 10-15 mins. Altogether a great experience :)

Fantastico!!!

Been here with my wife and my daughter for a dinner. Normally my wife doesn't like pizza that much but after the dinner the smile on her face was telling me that we can come here again and again. Same was with my daughter.¬†

Ambiance : Fantastic. We took a table for 4 at the ground floor. The upper floor has also live music area. Next time probably i'll try to catch a table there. The place was enough lit. The loudness of the music was a bit higher side in my opinion.

Food : As this was my first visit, I was a bit confused about the taste and size of the pizza. So I did not take any chance and ask the guy over there for suggestion. He shown us how to order and what to order. We ordered one "Create your own with extra Caramelized Onion and Garlic Prawns" and one "Pollo Piccante" along with some soft drinks. When they came to us, we were like "WOW". The taste of each of them blown me away. We ordered immediately one "Pepperoni" because I just love good pepperoni. This one amazed me too.¬† Fantastic soft crust, fluffy too. We ordered two "Pollo Piadina" which is actually wraps with lot of stuffing inside. Awesome tasty.

Staff: Very cooperative.

Overall Experience: Awestruck. Every pizza lover must visit at least once for Neapolitan pizza flavor in Kolkata. I'd highly recommend this place for pizza. I am coming back again with my family for sure.

This place radiates positive enery.
With Mediterranean decor and aesthetic lighting,  serving great food this is a hidden gem in the Allenby Road of Elgin.
This pizzeria serves equally good Spaghetti along with great Pizzas.
We had Parmesan creama spaghetti bowl with mushrooms. And trust me , I've never had a better spaghetti dish before.
Then we had Pollo Piccante and Pollo Caldo pizzas.
Pollo Piccante was indeed tasty but the pollo caldo was okayish. Oh the pizzas have only 4 slices by the way. 
The pizzas aren't typical of what othet joints serve. They don't have a thin crust or something of that sort. But I completely enjoyed eating.
The prices are on the higher side but that compensates.
If not for their pizza , I'll definitely visit there again for the Spaghetti.

Incredible pizza! I absolutely love pizza especially Neapolitan. I think Neapolitan style is the pinnacle of pizza.
This pizza is incredible Neapolitan style. Love the attention to authenticity by cutting the pizza into four slices. The crust is incredible as well. Very unique. It has this soft, fluffy texture. I really don‚Äôt know how they do it. However I think they need to up their game and put fresh mozzarella. A pizza of this quality deserves fresh mozzarella.
The mushroom pizza is a must! It is incredible! It has this rich truffle flavor that slides down your mouth and all the ingredients and flavors just blend so well together.
I highly recommend this place for any pizza lover. Definitely will visit again next time I come to Kolkata.

My friends are a fan of the place and couldn‚Äôt stop raving about it. On our annual reunion, we went in for dinner here after having drinks and snacks elsewhere as this place did not serve alcohol. I was kind of filled up by the time we got here and didn‚Äôt think I would have more than a bite.¬†I was surprised on having my very first Neapolitan Pizza, couldn‚Äôt stop myself from having one more bite. A defining characteristic of a Neapolitan Pizz is that there is often more sauce than cheese, leaving the middle of the slice wet or soggy, one needs to fold their pizza to eat it. We had ordered three different varieties and each of them was out of this world. The prizes are reasonable, actually on the cheaper side comparing the high quality.¬† 

On the negative, the kitchen is in the same room making the place feels hot and in need of a¬†better cooling system. With the huge demands on home delivery and the pizza being made from scratch one need to wait for quite a while before being served. 

The food itself is divine, this has become my favorite pizza place in the world as of now.

La Dolce Vita!
That's what it says on one of the walls. Dolce indeed. The interior, the unique menu, the food all of it really left us quite impressed.
We ordered the Pollo Piccante and a customized pizza with pomodero sauce and for desserts the budino. Both the pizzas were exceptionally soft (so much that if you're not careful the toppings will fall off, they warn you about that) and tasted extremely fresh. Pollo Piccante is a Fabricca special pizza and rightfully so. Also we managed to not mess up customized pizza choices.
The Budinos with their layers of vanilla, caramel, chocolate (dark and white) were absolutely divine.
Can't wait for my next visit ü§§

We ordered for a Quattro Formaggi pizza, a Parmesan crepe Spaghetti bowl, Berry and Peach Ice Teas. 
The spaghetti bowl really stood out, though it appears insipid but it tasted really good. Pizza was soft and tasty, had a good taste. 
The drinks were not that great, the concentration of the flavours were too overpowering. 

Ambiance: 4/5 
I really loved the ambiance in terms of the decor but it was a little too overcrowded.

Tried this new place in kolkata, much hyped zomato ratings, I am a pizza lover, I tried a piazza pizza out here, the flavours to the pizza were nice, however the portion of pizza is very small as they serve very soft base with bad base to the edges which somebody would not feel like having, so u have to have just the middle portions which is like nothing to your stomach. It was like having a mozerralla cheese base with few toppings and gud cheese, but I was disappointed with the pizza.The orange lemonade was gud. I would suggest the resturant to either increase the size of the pizza. Informing about the soft base before the order would not help u in the long run

To satisfy the craving for pizzas during lunch, decided to try out a new pizzeria. Located near forum mall, Fabrica Della Pizza is easy to find. The ambience and decor is really pretty and quaint and offers a slice of Naples, Italy right in the heart of Kolkata. 
For food we opted for create your own pizzas and a bowl of calamari. The pricing of the create your own pizza range is really tricky and confusing. At the top it mentions pizza at 330/- and below you have choices for cheese veg and non-veg toppings. INR 330 is the price of only the base and the sauce, which is not even a complete pizza in itself. The prices of cheese and toppings are added on top of that base price which takes the price to around INR 500. The pizzas served were average at its best. They used a little too much flour for the pizza base and we were literally eating raw flour along with the bread. We chose basil as a topping for one pizza and the leaves were merely added after the pizza came out of the oven and thus were completely raw, whereas it is supposed to be baked along with the pizza. One pizza is sufficient for one hungry soul if only you have other accompaniments. But unfortunately those pizzas alone  cannot satiate one's hunger. The quality of the pizzas do not justify such high prices. The bowl of calamari were decent. The squid rings lacked seasoning and consistency because not all rings were crunchy like it is supposed to be. 
The service was okay, but not something that could revive us from the disappointment of the pizzas.
Total bill came INR1498 for two people. They levy service charges along with GST and for me, the food they serve was really not upto the mark for such steep pricing.

As soon as you enter this place, it gives you a warm and fuzzy feeling. We went the day after Christmas and the decor itself was enough to give our spirits a lift. Coming to the food, the pizza was one of the bests I have tasted. It was a non veg pizza which was super cheesy and delicious. All in all, a good place to spend some time with your friends and even greater one for a date. Perfect food and ambience!

Congratulations Kolkata for yet another place with a twist. Pizzas with soft crust. Its different yet good. A nice cozy place for a quick bite. I would though recommend you to add to your drinks menu and increase the serving size of your drinks to last at least through one of your cheese loaded pizzas :P .

This place for long was on my bucket list. At a mere walking distance of 7-8mins from Forum mall(Elgin) will you find this posh eatery. Made a visit here last month and was awestruck by the decor.
Nothing less than a small italian village with beautifully scenic paintings on the walls, dim lights and eye-catching props.
Comparatively on the expensive side, fabbrica will not make you regret your decision of dropping in there. Their freshly made hand tossed pizzas are delectable to the peak. One big pizza easily serves two.
Fabbrica gives you the chance to choose in between their classic basic pizza recipes and 'make your own' pizza thing. I personally went for both.
Keeping aside their amazingly hot and cheese dripping pizzas , they've got some sinfully delicious desserts as well.
So, what we ordered: 1 Napolitan handmade pizza, 1 pepperoni pizza , affogato , budino.
Taste: 4.5/5
Ambience: 4.5/5
Value for money: 4/5
Total billing amount: rs1700.

It's a very pretty looking pizzeria located near Forum Mall. It's a 5 min walk from there. It is an Italian themed pizzeria. This place is beautifully decorated. Everything about this place is beautiful from the lights to the paintings. I was there before Chiristmas so i saw that they have a huge Christmas tree which you see once you enter the place. The staff were warm and courteous. Extra points for the quick service. 

The way they take your order is very interesting. What they do is that they will hand over you a leaflet in which you have to tick whatever you want to order and give it to them. I ordered the following items:-

1. Pollo Caldo - They have 11inches pizza which is more like a medium pizza. Thin crust with lots of cheese, spinach and caramelized onions on the top. Purely heaven!

2. Pepperoni - First time trying the pepperoni pizza. Thin crust with lots of pamesan cheese. Once you take the slice and fold it in half you could see the juices oozing out. Perfectly made!

3. Berry Iced Tea - Normal berry flavoured iced tea. It was a perfect combination of sweet and sour taste. Refreshing!

4. Fab Limonata - Lemon flavoured drink. Normal lemon drink tasted fine. I loved how nicely both the drinks looked. 

5. Budino - I had no idea what this was. Wanted to try something different. So experimented with this. And it tasted heavenly. It was more like a layered mousse. With vanilla cream, chocolate, caramel and cake at the bottom. It was a perfect end to our meal. The best mousse I had till date!

I strongly recommend this place to everybody specially to the pizza lovers. This place is perfect in every aspect. From the food to the ambience to the interiors. You can click alot of pictures here bcoz this place is instagrammable from every corner. Prices are a bit on the higher side but every single penny you pay is worth it!

You walk into the lane opposite Forum's back gate,into a quiet road and reach Fabrica Della pizzeria, right opposite Belgian Waffle Co. An entry into this eatery takes you on a voyage to a mini Italy with walls decorated like stone houses, cobbled paths and open windows decorated with blue pots and climbers. This place is so beautiful and gives you the right kind of vintage feels. We took our seats upstairs and ordered for a Quattro formaggi and a customised pizza with Coke (pizza and coke is still the deadliest combination) and 2 of the orange and basil based mocktail. Everything was on point. The Quattro formaggi pizza is to die for. You need to try this atleast once. The pizzeria specialises in the Neapolitan style pizza which has a distinct way of eating (instructions on the table). 
The service is quick and the food will disappear from your table even quicker. 
A minus 0.5 owing to their lack of space on the first floor.

So i visited this place very close to Christmas and therefore the decor was just so warm and festive!!the place has the vibes of an Italian villa with fresco paintings on the wall and quaint windows.
The staff is warm and courteous.
The menu is slightly restricted cause there arent really many options for a filling main course except pizzas and pasta...however since its a pizzeria u got to live with that!!!I had a custom pizza with pomodoro sauce,mozarella and mushrooms sundry tomatoes and fresh onions. It was actually delicioooooussss

For drinks we took a mocktail with strawberry, basil and lemon which was very refreshing and the cookie and cream milkshake was yum.

Overall an awesome place

An entry into this eatery takes you on a voyage to a mini Italy with walls decorated like stone houses, cobbled paths and open windows decorated with blue pots and climbers. This place is so beautiful and gives you the right kind of vintage feels. We took our seats upstairs and ordered for a Quattro formaggi and a customised pizza with Coke (pizza and coke is still the deadliest combination) and 2 of the orange and basil based mocktail. Everything was on point. The Quattro formaggi pizza is to die for. You need to try this atleast once. The pizzeria specialises in the Neapolitan style pizza which has a distinct way of eating (instructions on the table). 
The service is quick and the food will disappear from your table even quicker. 
A minus 0.5 owing to their lack of space on the first floor.

So i visited this place very close to Christmas and therefore the decor was just so warm and festive!!the place has the vibes of an Italian villa with fresco paintings on the wall and quaint windows.
The staff is warm and courteous.
The menu is slightly restricted cause there arent really many options for a filling main course except pizzas and pasta...however since its a pizzeria u got to live with that!!!I had a custom pizza with pomodoro sauce,mozarella and mushrooms sundry tomatoes and fresh onions. It was actually delicioooooussss

For drinks we took a mocktail with strawberry, basil and lemon which was very refreshing and the cookie and cream milkshake was yum.

Overall an awesome place

Great addition to the city. A cozy ambience coupled with lip smacking pizzas makes it an experience worth trying next time you are near Forum, Elgin road. The pizzas are a must try for the fresh crust straight out of the wood fired oven.

Wish to have an authentic pizza? Getting bored of dominos and pizza hut?
Fabbrica Della Pizza fulfills your wish.
They are one of the few places in kolkata serving authentic pizza.
We went for Quatro stagoni and Pepproni pizza.
Rightly wood baked, Delicious toppings and the mouth watering smell sums up for the perfect pizza.

The ambience, interior decoration and the staffs were all overwhelming.
Overall. A very good place to go for.

The pizzas, wafer thin, are of amazing taste. The selection of toppings, sauces and the cheese is quite up to the mark. Pizza is brilliant in terms of taste with a hint of garlic on the hand tossed bread.
Personal recommendation- Budino, as a dessert.
However, it could‚Äôve been bigger in size

We had abpollo picante pizza and a veg pizza along with hot chocolate. Hot chocolate was heavenly since it had marshmallows too! And the non veg pizza was great since we added mozerella cheese to it. In the veg one we aded feta cheese which did not make the pizza cheesy , so it tasted kinda tomatoish. Anyway great pizzas here and great ambience too
It's so pretty with beautiful music going on in the background. All in all a good experience :)

A really pretty pizzeria which has been on my bucket list for a long time. The fame and name for their amazing thin crust pizzas are real for sure. We started with a cup of cappuccino and Americano which was freshly made and the coffee beans used had a refreshing scent. The staff present was really well behaved and the ambience was pretty good although one has to use really high camera settings for pictures. One of the best thing about this place was the way they presented their menu cards which were practically a leaflet on which you have to tick the food items you desire to order. Tried a few of their signature dishes and here goes my review-

1. POLLO PICANTE-- An absolutely lovely thin crust pizza which ditched the conventional red pizza sauce and adopted the tasty pesto sauce. Filled with mozzarella and strips of roasted chicken and other spices and seasoning made the pizza a very tasty one. Also it was garnished with lots of caramelized onion and jalapenos.

2. BUDINO-- This was definitely an ice breaker. Well we definitely tried to experiment with our dessert and hence ordered this particular one without even having any clue how it will taste. To our very surprise this was the best dessert item I have tried in a very long time and the richness of it's triple layer delight just gave us a literal foodgasm. Made out of layers of vanilla cream, caramel and chocolate cream this is a must try dessert.

RECOMMENDATION- BUDINO
Refer to my account for pictures and more reviews.¬†
Will definitely recommend this beautiful and artsy place to everyone.

Coming to the food straightway, they really serve some authentic pizzas.
Each pizza is large enough for two people but don't worry one will always end up craving for more.
Starting from the crust, it's soft, and the entire preparation is simply commendable.
I also tried their Ricotta salad but I would rather say to stick to the pizzas instead along with the wraps, tiramisu and the other recommended food items.

Staffs and services : Cordial and prompt. A special thanks to u all for allowing me to make a video.

Another visit is round the corner.

Location : Located on Allenby road, the fourth bylane on the right hand side of Elgin road while going towards Sarat Bose Road.

I visited this place yesterday evening and felt like I was transported to a parallel universe of all things pretty .
The decor has a very vintage feel to it , with seating arrangements on two levels. It was done up for the holiday season with a Christmas tree, stockings, wreaths and fairy lights . The furniture is all wooden and they have vines covering the ceiling, all of it adding to its charm. 
Coming to the food, we tried the Pollo Picccante pizza, which is one of their signature styles. It contained roast chicken, fresh pesto, mozzarella, jalapenos, caramelized onions and feta. Decently priced at INR 400, I expected it to be amazing, going by some of the other Zomato reviews but it was a little underwhelming. 
I quite liked their aglio olio e peperoncino spaghetti bowl which we chose to top with garlic shrimps. Priced at INR 270, it was quite filling and appetising as well. 
I would highly recommend this place if you are in and around the Elgin road area and looking for a charming little place to hang out in :)

The pizzas served here are delicious loaded with lots of flavour. The pizza bread is so soft and is probably the best crust I have ever had. Though I feel that it is a little less cheesy than it should be, but the flavour and the taste makes up for it. 
I personally recommend the Fab Fungo pizza, it was absolutely gourmet.

What can be a better place for a romantic date than a classic Italian style pizzeria. Decorated with a catchy yellow vespa, wooden chairs, colourful windows and vines this place undoubtedly serves best pizza I have ever had. There unique menu with questionnaire actually helps you to customise your naepolitan style pizza so easily. 
We ordered pollo picante pizza along with Fab lemonada and berry flavoured iced tea. The wood fired thin crust pizza was soft and overloaded with cheese and just had a delectable taste. The drinks were just perfect addon to the pizza though I liked the iced tea more than the lemonada. 
The pricing is moderate and though they charge 6.5% service charge it is optional. Their service is very prompt and people are courtesous and helpful. Definitely going to come back soon and recommend it to all pizza lovers.

Undoubtedly one of the best pizza makers of Kolkata.

Ambience- the ambience is just perfect. Spanish and italian kind of decor with the extra effort in playing music of those origins, hats off to you guys. Seats are quite comfortable.

Food- The menu is a bit small. Can be expanded. The price is affordable.
We had Pepperoni pizza, oolong tea and cafe mocha. The pizza was really nice with soft crust and great pizza sauce. The fillings can be increased I believe.
The beverages were average.

Hospitality- The staff are courteous and always helping.

Overall a nice experience. Will definitely recommend this place for their pizzas.

This pizza outlet near Elgin Road is a must if you love good pizzas. Moderately sized, with one's preferred toppings, these soft crust pizzas will melt in the mouth. You can make your own pizza with your selection of sauces, cheese and toppings. Priced slightly on the higher end, this outlet provides good quality items. 
The place has a beautiful decor and ambience and will be a hit with the shutterbugs!

Authentic Italian restaurant interiors. There's one table in particular, upstairs on the left, that's really cool. Small one by the window. The place has a rare old-world charm; notice the switchboards.

Anyway, the menu is pretty innovative. A questionnaire where you tick the kind of toppings, sauce or cheese that you want. It's easier than having the server explain to you all the types of pizzas that are available. But then you have to really dig Italian food to know all of it.

So we ordered four large pizzas, one with pesto and another with bechamel sauce. Lip-smackingly delicious. They got everything right. And the pizzas are pretty filling as well.
The pepperoni is too good, albeit very thin, to the point where if you try to tear a slice away, all the meat and cheese stays with the pizza and you're left with bread in your hand. Have to carefully do it with a knife.

The best of the lot, though, is the Fab Fungo. Veg, but I bet this'll make even cannibals fall in love with vegetarian food. It's mushrooms and a lot of cheese with roasted garlic and pesto. This is the one to order.

We also ordered the Pollo Piadina, which is basically a grilled chicken wrap, and a Calamari Fritto. Too good, especially the calamari.

Recommended.

This is one of the best pizzarias in town. Here you can customise your pizza by choosing sauce, veggies and meat. They have set menu also from which you can choose, though number of options in set menu was limited. There was 4 of us and we ordered 3 pizzas, one among then contained egg with ham which was absolutely lip smacking. Loved the place. Will definitely recommend to the pizza lovers.

The moment one enters the restaurant, they can have a feeling of being in an Italian restaurant in Italy itself, the interiors, music and server's dresses are co-ordinated in that way.

Pizza: absolutely fantastic pizza. Soft and thin crust. I could choose what I want to add - sauce, cheese, toppings, etc.. While taking order, the server informed us on the pricing structure of make your own pizza. Served within reasonable time, the pizza tasted fantastic.

Spaghetti: We ordered Aglio-olio spaghetti,¬† it was half cooked. On complaining they retried and served another half cooked spaghetti. On complaining again, they were kind enough to take it back and apologise.

Priced reasonable the restaurant is a must visit. It looses on 5 star because of the spaghetti. Still a 4.5 star restaurant will be visited again by me. :)

Kolkata's new Italian baby. FABBRICA DELLA PIZZA. 
Located in Elgin area. In one of the by-lanes near Forum. Easy to locate. 
Not a very big place but a very cosy place. Two floors with floral decorations gives out proper date vibes. 
Coming to the food. Hands down Fabbrica Della Pizza is currently one of the best places in Kolkata for pizza. They serve Neapolitan Pizza. Very different from other pizzas as it is much more soggy and also the crust is very thin. They also has a very unique way of ordering. They will give you one order sheet and pencil and ask your own preferences for your pizza. We opted for one of the pizza from there menu. We tried only one pizza, Pollo Caldo, which was extremely tasty and mouth-watering. 
Service was very good. They explained the way of ordering pizza very politely. They did not take long for serving the food. Over all it was great experience. 
To all the pizza lovers, drop in at this joint as soon as possible and give your taste buds some great pleasure. :)

Was looking for a good wood fire pizza restaurant in kolkata.

Would go again but not before trying out other places first! Rucola salad was very nice!!

The ambiance is awesome and will make you hang out at that place longer. When i went there was live music and the singer was mind blowing. About the food, the pizza was a true thin crust that you can roll and take a bite of. The flavours are well balanced and the cheeze is Gooey. The desserts are not too sweet and thats good. I would say the weakling was their desserts and the pizza is to die for.

This is a very cute pizzeria opened near forum mall. Very well decorated, with special lights and that blue gate near the entry is just a perfect spot for clicking pictures. They have 2 floors : Ground Floor being the kitchen and the washroom, with near about 2-3 tables for 2. Upper floor is for people in groups.
We ordered :
Piazza
AL Diavolo
Both the pizzas were delicious and lip smacking. I have never had such an amazing pizza before.
The staff was also very friendly. Parking might be a problem though.
Price wise, it was a pocket pinch of Rs.1000. But after you taste their pizzas, this won't be a huge amount to pay. I suggest you to visit in a group.
Do give them a visit!

Had a good reception with a lovely pepperoni pizza that comes with parmesan cheese. The crust was very fine and made to perfection with that crunch on the outside and softness on the inside. Once you pick up a slice and fold it in half you can see the juices oozing out to be slurped and the sticky cheese strings get you glued to your next bite and until you polish it off the plate. Don't even try it with cutlery. It's blasphemous.
The wraps were not of that level and not generously long and thick enough, however the place was a very cozy and comfy as the service. Do visit the joint for those scrumptious pizzas

If you want to allow yourself a quick trip to an Italian eatery escaping all the hurlly burly of the city, it will be an excellent idea to give this place a visit. As soon as you step in, you will be greeted by the sight of a bougainvillea adorned pseudo-door and an oh-so-classic yellow coloured vespa which peeps out. The place is so exquisitely decorated with wooden chairs, Italian styled windows and vines that it will take your breath away. We went with cafe latte, peach flavoured iced tea and pollo piccante. The beverages were a delight. Soft crust, fresh cheese and shredded chicken made every bite of Pollo piccante, a pleasure. The soothing instrumental playing at the background adds to the charm. Icing on the cake is their prompt service and soft-spoken and helpful staff. The writing on the wall 'La Dolce Vita' justifies this place, it truly is an example of a good life.

This place is amazing. Their decor is so pretty. It actually looks like some Italian restaurant. ‚ù§ Their service is very well. The waiters helps to choose from the menu. They have creating your own pizza thing where we can create our own pizza with layers and toppings. We chose Pollo Piccante with crystal dunkin' dips. It had mozzarella, goat cheese, pesto,olives,jalapenos,chicken,etc. It tasted really yummy. The crust is soo soft and fluffy. The only complaint I have is the amount of chicken on it is very less. It felt nearly like a veg pizza. Rest everything was perfect. Having an amazing meal with such decor and music and hospitality is bliss. Its a MUST visit guys. üíï

Coming from the same team of Ballygunge's 'Alla Bella Mozarella' , this is a relatively new pizza junction at Allenby Road/Elgin.
The ambience of this place is beautiful, much like it's other branch. Though the place is not exceedingly large from the outside, it has two separate floors to accommodate a large number. The people from the staff are quite friendly and professionals in their tasks. Presentations' also on point, though much simple when you look closely. 
Unlike 'Alla Bella Mozarella' , the pizzas here are cut into four big slices and have a thicker yet a soft crust on which there are tons of delicious toppings to select from, you can even customize your own pizza if you want. 

1. Pizzas - Among pizzas , we had Pollo Picante, Pollo Caldo and Quattro Stagioni. These taste absolutely delicious , just like I said, these are rich, tasty combinations spread out on a soft crust.
2. Spaghetti Bowls - Totally loved them, served hot , in good quality as well as quantity, tasted amazing just like I mentioned. 
3. Milkshakes - Tasted good, nothing over the top. Hit all the checks quite accurately. Nothing to complain here either.

Overall, definitely a must try for everyone, if you love pizzas , you'll definitely love this place as well. 

Recommendations - Pollo Caldo, Quattro Stagioni and Parmesan Crema in Spaghetti Bowls.

The place comes with a big surprise. Not only the picturesque interiors, but also their flavorful and authentic napoletana pizza sends you on an ecstatic journey to Italy. We tried a custom made veg pizza which was very juicy and tangy, and a fab fungo pizza having loads of mushrooms and truffle oil, which was heavenly. The order took quite a time to be served, due to the rush on a Sunday evening, but it took only seconds to disappear. I would recommend this one for ardent mushroom lovers. Had one cookies and cream italian shake and one fab limonata to gulp the pizza down, and both were amazing. Any pizza fans here, you know the place to go. Highly recommended.

First entering this place the sober yet classy decor will attract your attention. The beautiful songs in the background will perfectly make your mood. We had Pollo Piccante and Calamari Fritto Misto. First came the squid rings in a little cute cycle. The sauce served with this was out of the world. Then came the pizza...no matter what I say about it will be less. Price is on the higher side but it's totally worthy. Staffs are very friendly. Overall it was a great experience.

If you are craving for an Italian cuisine, "Fabricca Della Pizza" should be the first name to strike your head. An amazing place to be at. An amazing restaurant to give the option to create your own customized pizza starting from the cheese along with your favorite toppings. The crust of the pizza was quite good, not too dry, and you could also have a dipping sauce for it. You can also have spaghetti with sauce and toppings of your choice. Your pasta will be loaded with cheese, toppings, saucy and well seasoned. The staff was very affable. The ambience was alluring and can even make you fall in love with the place. Overall, this is a place which can be visited as many times as possible! Happy eating!

"Pizza deliziosa"! This is exactly what we felt while having Pollo Piccante. The crust was thin and overwhelmingly mouthwatering. And the place was Italian in feels and decor. Beautiful ambience and friendly staff. It was like a piece of Italy in the middle of Kolkata. Do visit this place.

This one was there in my bucket list for a long time and finally made it last Sunday afternoon. People know this place for serving the best pizza in town which is absolutely true. First entering this place the sober yet classy decor will attract your attention. The beautiful songs in the background will perfectly make your mood. We had Pollo Piccante and Calamari Fritto Misto. First came the squid rings in a little cute cycle. The sauce served with this was out of the world. Then came the pizza...no matter what I say about it will be less. Price is on the higher side but it's totally worthy. Staffs are very friendly. Overall it was a great experience.

If you are craving for an Italian cuisine, "Fabricca Della Pizza" should be the first name to strike your head. An amazing place to be at. An amazing restaurant to give the option to create your own customized pizza starting from the cheese along with your favorite toppings. The crust of the pizza was quite good, not too dry, and you could also have a dipping sauce for it. You can also have spaghetti with sauce and toppings of your choice. Your pasta will be loaded with cheese, toppings, saucy and well seasoned. The staff was very affable. The ambience was alluring and can even make you fall in love with the place. Overall, this is a place which can be visited as many times as possible! Happy eating!

Delectable, finger-licking-good food. We had a couple of pizzas (a custom one included), spaghetti bowls and a wrap. All the food was uniformly good. The aglio olio & parmesan cream spaghettis were so bloody good, pasta cooked just right, super flavorsome and the perfect portion size. The pizzas nearly topped them. Made Neapolitan style but not overly drippy as it often happens, they were fresh and lovely, with the perfect crust. 
The beverages were the perfect coolers to go with it all. I can't fault a thing here (that's too many times I used "perfect")! Need to sample the desserts stat!

Definitely the best pizzeria in the whole damn city. The food here is excellent. We had a pepperoni pizza and a contadina pizza. The crust was absolutely perfect, perfectly executed neopolitan pizza. The iced latte was pretty basic but the tiramisu shake was amazing. The decor and ambience is very peaceful and cute. The servers were really patient and sweet enough to explain everything in details.So overall:
Pizza : 4.5/5
Service: 5/5
Ambience:4.5/5
Two pizzas, a latte and a tiramisu shake cost us around Rs. 2004 (including service tax which is optional)
This place is a little expensive compared to the traditional pizza places but its totally worth the money.

The little Pizzeria situated opposite Forum Mall gives you just the gala time you expect from an authentic Italian Pizzeria.¬†
The building itself looks very beautiful and looks large but internal space seems a little away from the larger side.¬†
Interior is quite appealing; like the one, we watch in European movies. The background music seemed all Italian. All together it gives the very nice feel. Ambience 5/5
The waiters were very friendly and gave suggestions just the way you needed. Service was quick and prompt. Service 5/5
The menu includes several 'pre-made' pizzas with the options to customer them as well. We chose to customize them. The sides were also sufficient enough for an Italian meal. The sauces were well made and spread evenly on the base, the cheese was quite a handful to be on the base. The crust was just so soft just like the way Italians had made. The toppings seemed quite fresh.¬† Overall it was a feast at the bite and you can't resist closing your eyes to get lost in another dimension. We had customized our pizza with Mozzarella, Pomodoro sauce with toppings of black olives, caramelized onions and basil along with sides as a Focaccia bread and Coke Zero.¬† Food 5/5.
Deducting .5 as the oregano and chilli flakes did not induce much of a taste.Unfortunately, my battery dies so could not get clicks of the place.

If you are looking for some authentic hand stretched pizza with amazing toppings on it.; this is just the place for you. :)

After fire n ice , this is my favourite pizza place in  the city. Ambience or decor wise i dont think anyone can raise a finger because its obviously the prettiest place in kolkata. Waiters are well trained ans quick. Ok so i ordered a pepperoni pizza and a chicken arriabiata, 2 cans ofcoke and 2 desserts(the names of which i donot remember but photos of which i have uploaded). The pizzas were heavenly. The desserts were recommended to us by a waiter and both were equally tasty. ‚ù§ ‚óèour bill was 1800/-  .

All pizzas on the menu are very good. They are all Neapolitan based pizzas which mean they focus more on sauce than cheese. Pizzas are absolutely delicious and mouth watering. Ambience is very good and the decor is great. Service is decent and the servers are always enthusiastic about your order. Pocket pinch is medium. Experience is priceless.

Located opposite cream centre, Elgin road.
Features in pizzas, shakes and wraps.
The pizza has a wide option.
The make it yourself pizza is one's own choice on how it is made. 
I had got a make it yourself pizza which had
1. Pomodoro sauce
2. Mozzarella cheese
3. Toppings- jalapenos,black olives and sun-dried tomatoes.
It was awesome.
I think I hadn't had a better pizza than that in quite some time.
The base was so well made. The sauce was better than most other places in the city. The cheese was worth drooling for.
I had ordered a classic tiramisu shake- it was good.
Another interesting dish was the Veg Pinidia(I believe this was the name).
It was a wrap of spinach and another English vegetables.
Fine in taste, but not recommended to those who despise spinach.
Next was a spaghetti bowl , which was an agli olio in pesto sauce. Might sound a little weird, but I am delighted that I ordered it. It was sinful.
The ambience is okay. The presentation is simple.
The staff is good, takes full interest in your order and gives probable suggestions.
Highly recommended.

Had the worst experience here. First of all, initial service was extremely slow. After ordering our food and waiting for 40 minutes, a waiter informs us that our order hasn‚Äôt been received and we should place it again. This was after we had repeatedly asked about our order earlier as well. On top of everything, no apologies or remorse from the staff as we walked out.

Fabbrica Della Pizza is a must visit for every pizza lover out there. It is located in Allenby lane i.e. the lane bang opposite Forum. 

The decor is SO Beautiful! It is an ideal place for a first date. You feel like you are in a little Pizzeria in Italy. It's super cosy with music playing in the background. 

The servers were also courteous and service was moderately quick. 

Coming to the best part now- THE FOOD!

Ordered the Tiramisu milkshake, the  iced latte and the normal latte for drinks. Loved the milkshake! 

The pies- you are served 4 big slices which are packed with flavour. 
We ordered the pepperoni- best pepperoni pizza I've ever had. 
The contadino- OMG! it was jam packed with flavour and tasted delicious. 

Will definitely visit again!

PLEASE CHECK YOUR BILL BEFORE PAYING.

got a bill with service charges added and gst charged on Service charge. Please be careful.

My bill of 480 had 31.2 as service charge and 18% gst on both the amount. So I was paying gst on service charge. 

Now Coming to the food. Ordered a veg wrap with bell pepper pesto. Turned out to be a dry roll with filling and next to no pesto. Was hard to swallow without sips of coffee after every bite. Opened the roll to see literally two dots of the pesto. I tried giving feedback but was met with resistance. Eventually had to force the server to get a bowl of the pesto as I was hungry and really wanted to eat the roll. So disappointed with a place with such good ratings.

This place, located in the lane exactly opposite forum courtyard, has a very special place in my heart because of the memories I made here. Two visits and both  never ceased to please. The place is not very big with seating arrangements in thr ground floor as well as a short raised first floor. The upper area is obviously more preferred because of the the view, the decor and the very antique wooden customizations. The food is extremely well priced for the served proportions and the taste is going to stick with you forever. Featuring their speciality of the Napoleon style pizza which is basically a really thin crusted fresh firewood oven baked pizza that is so gooey that you need to roll in up to eat it. Other than that the cookies and cream milkshake is totally worth dying for. The service is very prompt and the people are extremely courteous and polite. The music is soft and subtle and does not interrupt converstaions. The lighting is dim yellow to set that perfect mood to spend quality time with quality food. A must go for all pizza lovers and also people o  the lookout for cafes with best ambience.

Located in a lane just opposite the Forum Mall, this European themed cafe was a long awaited visit.
We ordered:
Al Diavolo: it had Pomodoro sauce, spinach, roasted garlic, red chillies and Feta cheese. One can't complain about the quality of their pizza. Everything was perfect, from the toppings, the cheese to the crust; their seasonings are good, I liked the pickle oil they served. The pizza size is sufficient for two.
Pollo Piadina: I guessed it would be the usual wrap, but it is probably one of the best wraps we've ever had. The light wrap, the fresh fillings and most importantly the smoke flavoured, extremely juicy chicken pieces were just amazing.
They live up to their rating and obviously the ambience is all the more wonderful with the happy tunes of medieval European music. The only factor is they are too pricey. Also they have increased prices, so be prepared for some more charges than the Zomato menu.
Nevertheless, the service guy was extremely courteous. One has the option to refuse the service charge.

Lovely food and good ambiance, the music is definitely an add on. Best authentic pizza place in Kolkata till now. Soft hand-rolled pizzas with good quality mozeerela cheese. And the best part is you get to choose the veg and non-veg  toppings of your choice. Also loved the spaghetti Aglio Olio and the desert with three layers of cream, caramel and chocolate. Only negative thing about the place is that they are still charging service charge which shouldn't be the case after GST is introduced.

Only one word can summarize my visit experience to Fabbrica Della Pizza - "Bellissimo". After my first visit there is no doubt in my mind that this is the best pizzeria in Kolkata right now.

I would detail my experience as follows -
The good -
i. Ambience - The music, the decor is truly amazing. Full marks to the decorator. The restaurant can be easily considered for both casual hangouts or romantic dates.
ii. Food - Gambiretti pizza i.e. pizza with shrimps was a unique experience. The pizza crust although thin, was tender and juicy enough. Pollo piadina - a type of chicken wrap, was also extremely delicious. Tiramisu - true to its name this sweet dessert will surely lift your spirit up.
iii. Staff - As courteous as can be.

The bad -
I do not have anything to complain about, but I would still be nitpicking on one thing that I experienced during take away. Unfortunately, the restaurant does not have large enough carry bag for pizza as of yet, as a result I had to carry the box which was not a very easy thing to do. Hope they improve on this small point.

Wishing all the very best to the staff, will be surely visiting again.

This is the best restaurant for having pizza in this city.

I ordered:-
1.POLLO PICANTE: this is the best pizza I have tasted till now. The base is softer than other pizza I had till outside.
2. CLASSIC TIRAMISU MILKSHAKE : it was good. Less on sweet , what I prefer .
_______________________________________________

I never judged a restaurant for its ambience, but oh boy ! This restaurant have one of the best interiors in Calcutta. Moreover the smell of pasta, pizza and cheese & traditional Italian music makes you happy for no reason.
Their staff are also very courteous. 
Price is on higher side, but it's worth it .

I love a good pizza. No, not the typical fast food joint kind of pizza, with its thick doughy crust and measly helping of not-so-flavourful toppings. So when fabbrica opened in Kolkata, I jumped at the opportunity immediately, making my first visit within a week of its opening. The array of chocies was amazing, and¬† I was paricularly thrilled to see toppings like feta, arugula and sundried tomatoes, the classic pizza toppings which are so difficult to come across in Kolkata.¬†

The place has a ambience that gives you the feel of a small Italian pizzeria. Although they had a typical western playlist earlier, in my latest visit I found the place playing some charming Neapolitan barcarolles and traditional Italian tunes, which I found pretty apt.

Okay, coming to the food. I have stuck mostly to pizzas in my choices. Among some of the other things I've had, I absolutely loved the arugula salad. A perfect balance of flavours and textures with the ideal dressing to tie it all together, it simply couldn't be better. I only wish there was more of it. The fab limonata was nice and refreshing.

Ok, now for the real deal, the pies. I've tried quiet a few already, ranging from the house specialities to a couple of customised pizzas too. The crust is near perfect.... not too crunchy so as to make it feel like a hard-shell taco, not too thick so as to overpower the toppings with its breadiness. Among the speciality pizzas, I absolutely loved the piazza, the pollo caldo and the fab fungo. The toppings balance each other out to give you a very satisfying and different mouthful every single time. The pollo piccante is pretty good too. The gamberetti and pepperoni were okayish though. The prawn pizza needed more punch in my opinion and the pepperoni pizza desperately begged for some acid to balance out the salt of the cured meat.¬†

They have recently introduced a tiramisu in the dessert section. Although it tasted great, the portion size was way too small in my opinion. I also hope they increase the dessert menu to include more classics like panna cotta and cannoli.

Overall, it is the perfect place for someone who wants to try out some proper pizza. I will definitely go back to sample more pizzas and some of the other items on their menu, particularly the burrata. Keep up the good work, team Fabbrica!

Disappointed

For Me ‚ÄúFood is love, but Pizza is Bae". Me and my friend were in a search for the best pizza in city and this way we ended up at the Fabbrica Della Pizza. 
Easy to spot and though not a big place.¬†

Situated in 8A, Allenby Park, Elgin, Kolkata. Just opposite to Forum Mall. Fabbrica Della Pizza is easy to locate and is a veg and non-veg pizza which provides wide range of pizzas along with some starters,beverages and deserts. They do not have valet parking services but parking is easy to find outside on the main street. But their decors looks awesome.¬†

I ordered¬†

Contodino Pizza,¬†
Fab Limonato,¬†
Hot Dark Chocolate¬†
and¬†
Pollo Piadina

Contodino Pizza tasted awful in fact few bites were tasteless. They didn't add give any oregano or dips. Personally I didn't like it. It looked and tasted burnt and was hard to chew too. 
I am really not sure if the crust was supposed to be that way or it was just a bad pizza. I didn't enjoy it at all.¬†

But only Hot Dark chocolate was TOO good AND Fab Limonato were also.

and Pollo Piadina were also disappointing.

The service was disappointing too. The place was not even crowded for the waiter to forget about the drink. They didn't even bother to apologize or ask anything further.¬†

I'm really disappointed and will never place an order at Fabbrica Della Pizza

This place made me go awestruck with its ambience. The decor touches your heart and the appropriate background music takes you to some Italian roadside cafe. The staffs were extremely cooperative. Since it was our first time they made us understand beach and everything clearly and we could order without doubt. The "make your own pizza" part is the best of the menu. We made a pizza with mozzarella cheese bacon and roasted chicken and it tasted perfect. They put a lot of cheese. It was an awesome experience. Keep up the good work :)

I loved this place. It won't be an exaggeration if I say that I had the best thick-crust pizza here. The place is beautiful. The Italian decor plays well with the warm tones and the statement blue door paints a lovely picture.
Coming to food, its delicious.. The pizzas are mouth-watering, soft, full of cheese.. They are absolutely heavenly. We ordered for margherita and pollo caldo, calamari fritto misto and fab limonata, lemon iced tea and strawberry milkshake.
This place is a must if you love pizza. And, even if you don't, go there to have your best one.

My favourite pizzeria in the city. Love love love the ambiance. Many of my friends actually went there after I suggested them and they loved it just as much. The music just takes you to Italy. The desserts taste like heaven. Budino is a must-try to please your sweet tooth.
I went there on my boyfriend's birthday. The staff actually helped me out with matches to cut the cake. That was a really sweet gesture. The walls are aesthetically decorated. Even the cart they bring for the bill is well thought out. I strongly suggest this place.

The first thing that strikes you as you enter this place is the decor. You feel like you've stepped into an actual Italian restaurant. They play Italian songs which adds to the ambience.
The food is really good. We had deep fried squid rings with garlic sauce for starters. For mains, we ordered 3 medium pizzas which was sufficient for 6 guys. The pizzas were thin crust and loaded (tad bit overloaded, rather) with toppings ‚Äî just the way I like!
For dessert we had the Budino which was a little chocolaty delight.
The only downside is the price which was maybe a bit too much. They also took 6.5% service charge along with 18% GST. When we pointed this out, they said that's their rule.

If u want authentic Italian pizza, then this is the place u r looking for.
Mouth watering pizza with beautiful ambience is going to make u come back to this place again and again.
The ambience here is to die for. The well thought decor right from italy with light music just works like a therapy.

We were greatly helped by the staff member who explained us the menu well and also gave us some suggestions..
Though, the menu is quite limited, but the more limited, the better u can expect..
So, for food we ordered
1) POLLO PICCANTE AND
2) BUDINO
Pollo piccante is their signature pizza and it just mouth watering.
It is pesto base, so it is best for those who wants normal, non spicy pizza.
The pizzas are freshly made and was extremely tasty.
 Still, was expecting some more pieces of chicken in it.
What actually stole my heart was Budino.
This dessert is divine and all my foodie friends who need to fix their sweet tooth has to try out this dish.. Highly recommended!!
Overall, we had a great experience with great food and a therapeutic ambience. The pocket pinch for two would be around 750 if u dont opt for sides as they charge extra service charge along with GST. But the food is worth the money.
Would be surely visiting this restaurant again..

Tucked inside the busy lanes of Elgin is this gemstone of a Cafe.¬†Easy to locate and its even more amazing to look at.Will get a 5/5 for its ambiance and decor.¬†Coming to the staff. They were courteous and helped us out on choosing the dish we might like to try out.We had ordered a Pollo Piccante along with Calamari Fritto misto.The Calamari was great but i personally felt a tad bit of seasoning would've helped it. The Pizza was a ball hit straight out of the park in terms of flavor and taste.A thing which asks for a second round.The first visit was pleasant. Looking forward to future visits.

Fabbrica Della Pizza is a medium sized, very pretty looking restaurant near Forum Mall. We luckily found seating space upstairs at 9 PM on a Saturday night. The ambience was semi‚Äìformal with tables occupied largely by family groups.


The waiter explained the menu as we were dining with them for the first time. It basically had three rules - you can make a pizza to suit your preferences and this is how much every item would cost, we don‚Äôt customise the predesigned pizza, and our pasta is al dente and we won‚Äôt it make 'al Indian taste.'

We ordered for ‚Äì

¬∑      Genovese Pizza ‚Äì It was a great looking pizza with lots of pesto. They did not use capers from the given description and also did not bother to inform us about it. There were plenty of pine nuts and olives and only about 4 pieces of cherry tomatoes. Baby 
So, this pizza has a thin base with fluffy edges, like a roti, though unfortunately I like my pizza a bit chewy and crunchy.  One pizza is filling enough for 2 people. 

¬∑      Classic Tiramisu Milkshake ‚Äì Sounds fancy, looks fancy, and tastes below average. Yes, it was less sweet, the way I like my milkshakes but however it completely lacked the strong coffee flavour.

¬∑      Veg. Piadina ‚Äì This was love at first bite :D
The thin wrap bread was stuffed with mushrooms and red pesto sauce. Beautiful flavours! Reminded me a personal favourite wrap at Nandos.  


We paid 1500 for the above order along with a cup of tea so I wouldn‚Äôt say it was a cheap meal. I wasn‚Äôt too impressed with my meal so I‚Äôd probably wait till a plan for Fabbrica is forced :P

Pizza, the kind of love triangle everyone deserves and most certainly this lovely joint is guaranteed to steal your heart away. Not just that, they have various Italian delicacies to try along. This is the first pizza place in Kolkata that makes Neapolitan Pizza that was originated in Naples, Italy. By far, this is the best pizza crust I've tasted. Their d√©cor will make you feel like a little part of Italy is added to the city. With cute little windows and great lighting by the staircase, it's apt to get some good pictures clicked. 

They have a 'Make your own pizza' option where we can mix and match the sauces and toppings. We decided to opt for that. Me being slightly figure conscious, chose for a no cheese Pizza with pomodoro sauce, capsicum, red chili, mushrooms and roasted chicken. And truly for all the people who are trying to avoid cheese and hence not able to have pizza, Fabbrica Della is there at your rescue. You can now hog on pizzas without any guilt. My companion being big Italian food fanatic ordered for a Mozzarella cheese pizza with pomodoro sauce mushrooms olives & green chilli. With that we tried the veg piadina & pomodoro spaghetti. Both the dishes were very very tasty and we were so full that we literally had to take a time out while eating. 
Each and every dish was absolutely delicious and lip smacking. They also had the authentic olive oil with chilli to add to the pizzas which most Italian restaurants miss out on. 

Coming to the service, it was absolutely fast and prompt. The staff was well mannered and very understanding. It was wonderful experience and had a great date along with some delicious food. Pizza fan or not, this is a absolute must visit for everyone of any age group.

Located near Forum Mall, in the Cream Center Lane, this place is pretty underrated for the kind of pizzas that it serves. We ordered a "Make it Yourself" pizza, where we got to check the sauce, cheese and toppings on a checklist kind of paper and the resultant 11" pizza was a bliss. Went with the Pomodoro sauce, Fresh Mozzarella cheese and Black olives, red bell peppers and caramelized onions toppings. The crust was thick and soft, so soft that you can roll the pizza and have it. It was cheesy and delicious. The only thing I regret is choosing caramelized onions over other better options. Also ordered a Fab Limonata which was very refreshing, perfectly sweet and is a must try.

This outlet is spread over two floors and has a beautiful decor. I liked the upper floor more only because of the rustic feel to it. The staff is also very friendly and cooperative. Looking forward to trying more of their pizzas.

Choosing your pizza toppings are not something extra-ordinary but choosing the sauce, the cheese and the extras are something noteworthy. The concept of heading out leaflets of ingredients is very unique and the suggestions are too notable. The staff knows which combination works. Beschemel (white sauce) pizza is very out of the box! I got extremely creative with the pencil ordered a pizza with Pomodoro, Mozzarella, Parmesan, caramelised Onions, Roasted Garlic, Mushrooms and the meat was Bacon. Bacon always makes everything better. The Pizza was amazing a Traditional Neapolitan Pizza in Kolkata is great. The Crust was fantastic and the experience was fantastic. This was my first experience after this I've been to this place 11 times then finally writing this review. Loved it. From Pre to Post meal Service and Satisfaction is Top Notch.

A Piece Of Italy in Kolkata.üòä Located just in the opposite Lane of ForumMall.Very easy tolocate.After seeing the reviews of this place I decided to go there. Ambiance is 10/10.No two ways aboutit.And to my surprise or luckily we got that corner balcony seat which I see the people crave for.Well it is a different feelingaltogether.The background music aptly suits theambiance.One of the staff came to us with the menu and with all due responsibility made us understand eachdishes.This kind of gesture we rarely find any otherrestaurants.Anyway the pizza that we ordered was also suggested byhim.It was POLLO CALDO.It taste heavenly.Soft and tendering(No Dryness).Along with that we also ordered CLASSIC TIRAMISU MILKSHAKE which was anothermasterstroke.Lastly for desert we had BUDINO.It had layers of caramel coffee vanilla cream and chocolate. So basically this place is a complete package of great ambiance, good food,cooperative staffs and also mostly important you will be charged reasonably.Hence you will depart from here with a smile on face signifying complete satisfaction .üòä

I am in totally love with the PIZZA they serve here. We had ordered Focaccia, their specialized Pollo Piccante pizza, Gamberetti, cookies and cream milkshake, Classic Tiramisu. Size of the Pizza were quite decent and it was overloaded with cheese and fresh vegetables. I loved the crust of their Pizza, it was so thin and soft. They had decorated the interior very Italian style. It's a MUST-GO place and if your partner loves Pizza then there is nothing best in kolkata than this place.

It was a summer day i visited this place with my friend. The place takes you to a subtle tour round naples and gives you hints of italy itself.
Beautifully decorated with detailed wine leaves and bougenvellia . An antic yellow vespa makes a favourite corner for selfies for its customers.
Now coming to the food. This place serves nepolian pizzas n its not like the regular thin crust pizzas. The place allows you to even choose your own toppings . The variety of pizzas in the menu is short yet interestng. Among pizzas we tried pollo picant√© and apart from the pizza, we tried foccacia and veg piadina. The taste was fresh, juicy and made us crave more. In dessert we tried classic tiramisu and budino. 
The location is also very easy to reach. Its the lane opposite to forum mall and beside "country house' caf√®.
I would recommend a seat downstairs beside the huge glass panes. I really enjoyed a view of the road with a little bit of italy within.

We wanted a serene atmosphere and we couldn't ask for a better place.
Highly recommend the Pepperoni and the Nutella pizza.
From the desserts section, we got Budino and it was lovely too.
Highly recommended for any occasion.

Food, it was fine. It wasn't that bad, price was quite reasonable. I can visit again because I do think they a taste which I may have missed.

We went to this last Sunday and were very disappointed with the pizza and the way the staff handled it. After repeating for I don't know how many times that the pizza tasted awful and burnt the staff were not ready to accept, instead claimed it tastes this way and we r not aware how a brick wood pizza tasted. At last we had to give in by asking them to charge us and remove the pizza. Highly not recommended !!!!

This place is beautiful. The decor is whimsical and dreamy, we were instantly charmed by the blue door. 
 Coming to the food, the pizza was delicious with the thin, soft, foldable crust.  It had pollo picante topping. The lemon iced tea was refreshing, and the dessert, budino with it's three layers of caramel, cream and chocolate turned out to be the highlight of the meal. Also, the soft instrumentals playing in the background was very soothing.

The pizza is simply amazing and milkshakes are exotic. Every pizza lover should definitely visit this outlet. The prices are on the higher side though with 18% gst and 6.5% service charge.

Went there with my significant other on a warm friday evening...had some trouble finding the place with google maps as they couldn't pin point the location...but had a fun time though searching for it..on the lane opposite to forum mall..and after a few sighs we were at this sumptuously decorated little italian joint which transports you to the scenes from the movie under the tuscan sun...we'll talking of the sun the place was well lit....and we managed a place on the "balcony" probably the best seats in the restro....a blue window by the side of the table with a victorian age lamp on top which lights the whole table..and with the added music..it's just what you mean by a proper themed restro...the ceilings with the vines and the walls with the murals of italian country roads..though not absolutely perfect still manages to give you that urge to wanna visit the country someday...
Okay coming to the food...they give u a card and a pencil and they explain every bit of the menu which is quite nice..for someone who hasn't scoured zomato..but it adds to the whole experience...we had the fab fungo....and the pizza with their signature naepolitan crust which is soft , their imported range of cheese...and with a generous amount of toppings has a rather feel good vibe to it... topping some of the best pizzas from the regular pizza makers...
We also had budino for dessert which is a multilayered dish with caramel,cream,coffee and crumbles... Which misleads u with the small cup but enough to satisfy your sugar cravings...the pizza and desserts are enough to fill up your stomach and your heart and the prices don't dampen the experience in any way...and when it's all over and u expect your bill tucked away between leather covers they serve it in in a little wrought iron rickshaw carriage...with two little candies...now this is where it all goes wrong..i mean why in the blue hell would u serve minto fresh....it's like one of those absolutely irritating ads in the midst of a really engaging movie...so try and change that...and we were waiting for the staff to take a picture of us before we ticked the Excellent box in the review card...but eventually got lost in the scenes..a big apology to the very friendly and courteous staff of the restro....and as real italians would say Sicuramente visita di nuovo( *Italian accent*)....for people who are too lazy to use google translate that's just italian for we'll surely visit again...

There are only a few places in Kolkata which serve authentic Italian pizzas and even fewer places which serve Neapolitan style ones. This is one such place.

Neapolitan style pizzas, originating in Napoli, in the south of Italy, have a slightly thicker and softer crust with a somewhat soggy center. In contrast, the Roman style Pizzas tend to be have a thinner and much crispier base.

Here they have a make your own pizza option where one can mix and match various cheese and toppings. But I tried the old classic Margherita. This is something I tend to do when I visit a pizzeria for the first time. Because if they can't get it right, chances are pretty slim that they will get anything else right. The main thin about any pizza is the base. It that is not properly done, no amount of fancy toppings can rescue it.

I am happy to say that they have got most things right here. The center of the pizza I was served was soft and wet with a nice balance of sauce and cheese while the edges were crisp and slightly charred. The Italians are quite fussy about their pizzas, with elaborate rules as to the types of wheat, cheese and tomatoes to be used. I don't know to what extent they follow those regulations here, nevertheless, the pizza I was offered, tasted quite close to the original.

The decor of this place spread over two floors is very nice and the servers efficient. The prices are bit on the higher side though. Overall a welcome addition to the Kolkata food scene.

After a long hunt for a good pizzeria, finally our search ended at this place. A quaint place on Allenby Road near Forum mall, their interiors are really cute and reminds one of Italy. The ambience is nice and the staff was helpful as they provided us with the information regarding dishes and ingredients.Their pizza is very different from the ones served at popular pizza chains. Their food is fresh, has good ingredients and in generous amounts. We ordered Pollo Picante and a Spaghetti bowl with Pomodoro sauce and chicken. The pizza was one of the best I've ever had. The savoury pesto copuled with the sweetness of caramelised onions, accompanied by creamy cheese made it absolutely irrestible. A must try. The spaghetti was more on the spicier side with a healthy dose of dried chilli flakes. We only hoped that they had put in some more chicken considering the extra charge. Overall a good place for pizza lovers. Looking forward to try their customised pizzas next time.

This is a small pizzeria with cute interiors. The service is prompt and good. Coming to the food, it was awesome. We tried the fungo pizza which was a mushroom pizza. It contained different types of mushrooms and was decadent. It's a must for every mushroom lover. Next we had the piazza which was pomodoro sauce based pizza topped with onions, pesto and goat's cheese. Another well made pizza which is a must have. 
Overall, every pizza enthusiastic must visit this place. And I would suggest just have the pizzas.

The new italian place near Forum mall , the ambiance is good , thought the place is small.

As for the food the Alio olio which was very good and a must try , the portion sizes are small and for per person only. We ordered the fungi pizza with home made pesto sauce to dip in, the pizza was ok and a bit chewy , if you expecting a crunchy base then this is not the place. Other wise the food was good and the homemade ice tea was also good.

Located near the forum mall. It's just 5 mins walk from the forum mall. It's an Italian Themed restaurant. 
Heard a lot about this place and it didn't disappoint. 
Ordered two pizzas couldn't resist with just one. 
It was 11 inches pizza more like medium size of dominos the crust was chewy like it was naan and not pizza dough. No complaints whatsoever with the crust. Tasted amazing with the packed mozzarella cheese.
Ordered Pollo Caldo and Contadina. 
Pollo caldo was better as Contadina had spinach which didn't taste all that good. 
Would definitely be trying other pizzas. 
And also to mention about their quick service and extremely friendly staffs.

Beautiful little place. Lovely decor. The whole place reminded me of the caf√©s in Pondicherry so much. And the food, oh my god.. the pizza was one of the best I've had in Calcutta. We opted for the Pollo Caldo pizza and it was delicious. I'm definitely going back to try the rest of their pizzas!! We also had lemon iced teas and calamari fritto misto for starters which were fine. The dessert was a big plus too. We had the Affogato, Budino and Pizza Al Nutella. I'd recommend the Affogato and Pizza Al Nutella. Loved the place!

I'd give a 10000/5 to this amazingly beautiful place!
I was crying about how I was in Italy last summer - and then when my friend took me here, I was complaining no more!

BEST PIZZAS IN TOWN, hands down! üíï
Moreover, SO BEAUTIFUL too!
Believe me when I say this, it felt a lot like Italy for the one hour I was there üíù
And if all of that isn't reason enough for you to visit this place - the service is impeccable and I'd say there's value for money too! MUST TRY!

I was insanely satisfied visiting this small and lovely joint tucked in Allenby road. The decor is classy yet warm :) the service was a lil towards the weak side, unfriendly staffs. The food could make up for everything! The al diavoli pizza was to die for, crazy and certainly one of the best I've had in the city. The polo picante was great too(just a little more cheese would do justice). The spaghetti bowl in Parmesan cream was perfect! The berry iced tea was yummy. I had no complains apart from the dessert I wanted being unavailable. A hidden gem and a must try joint in the city of joy!

There is nothing so special.
The new style of pizza is not good. We didn't even feel like we are eating a pizza. It felt like we were given a chapati with vegetables on top. The quantity of cheese was also very less.

Satiate your taste buds at Fabbrica Della Pizza with some authentic Italian delicacies! We ordered Pollo Caldo Pizza which had substantial toppings comprising Pomodoro, Fresh Mozzarella, Arrabbiata chicken, Black olives and Onions, and for dessert we ordered Cookies and Cream Italian Milkshake. Absolutely loved it! The detailed interior decoration is exquisite. The service was also prompt. Pocket pinch was ‚Çπ 1156 for two.

The only place serving nepotalian pizza, cost for 2 definitely way more than what's mentioned on zomato. Not a fan of these styles of pizza but definitely worth a try. Too much spillage, the crust is basically absent, you cant eat a slice without folding.

Tried many pizzas here, all pizzas has more than the required herbs therby overpowing every other taste in it.
The Quattro stagioni pizza was nice, varities on a single pizza.

The shakes is close to heaven, the classic tiramisu being the best among the lot, cookies and cream is also a good choice here. Fab Limonato was also good, very refreshing and so was Italian iced teas, didn't like the strawberry cream and hot dark chocolate though.

Heard so much about this place, from outside was expecting a different kinda italian place interior.. good thing was the life size painted wall,, bad thing was too much leafy canopy! Menu is very limited, bt then they specialize in authentic Neapolitan pizza made fresh inside the brick kiln.. its an open live kitchen, u can see your pizza baking,, u can chose ur toppings, sauce, bread, cheese to make a customized pizza.. no alcohol.. pinch in pocket 3/5
N yes vegetarian mushroom lovers, u got to try veg piadina.. it was amazing and so utterly full of best tasting mushrooms.. 
Very authentic pizza, made to perfection, select your toppings n cheese n sauce nicely.. go there only for the pizzas

A new entry in the pizzeria community of Kolkata, but will definitely leave a mark! Brilliant decor, well behaved staff & decent food, what else one wants...LIVE MUSIC!! Dropped in for the show actually and tried:

1. Calamari Fritto Misto - 3.5‚≠êÔ∏è
[The squid meat was tender, inside a deep fried crust. The crust, in time, made the dish a little monotonous and bland to some extent. Garlic caper dip to the rescue, but they should work on the crust though eventually]

2. Classic Tiramisu - 5‚≠êÔ∏è
[The show stopper. Perfect blend. Brilliant job with this guys!!]

A good 4.5‚≠êÔ∏è for the place. Still need to try out their speciality - pizzas! Repeat visits guaranteed.

Before commenting on the foods I would like to add my first impression of the place. Just wow! I might have just visited some quaint joint in Italy itself! What an incredible interior. Now coming to the food I had Pollo picante and Pollo piadina. I loved the former which is the pizza and in my next visits I will definitely try and avoid the latter. The latter is a wrap. But the taste of the pesto and the rucola is so overpowering that I could not taste the chicken at all. Saying that I would recommend all pizza lovers to try out their pizza at least once. It would make you fall in love with pizza once again and quite so justifiably!

Well, what can I say about a place who's only downside is it's apparently slightly indifferent but actually very cozy location?

The ambience is serene, has a sense of rural Italy to it and is charming. The lighting is soothing. Initially they played really garbage pop music, but the 2nd time I visited they changed it to more pleasing music.

Coming to the food. Thin crust Napolitan pizzas with chunks of mozerrela and well spaced out savoury toppings. Hands down a winner. If you want to charm your lady love and she's into pizzas, this place does it for you.

While the calamari wasnt too good, their pizzas are winners. Note, each pizza is 4 slices and enough for one, so order that way. They have the option of DIY pizzas as well as made up ones. I'd suggest if you are making one yourself, positively consult the waiters, who have pretty good knowledge of what goes well with what. Also, a bit of self research on what they are offering will help.
The one we made up had pomodoro sauce, lathered with fresh gooy and sticky mozzerella, topped with olives, sun dried tomatoes and ham. Note, you cannot order more than 3 toppings, so select wisely. Consult the waiter for which toppings go well with which sauce. Ordering a beschemel base and ham topping is a grand way to ruin a well baked pizza and anger the Gods of all that's good for your tongue(Ramsey anyone?)

I havent tried the desserts myself, but I wil definitely be back for more, because I'm still drooling over this place.

Bottom line: one of the best pizzas I have ever had! And this comes from someone who's a highly critical of all the pizzas she's ever had! Best part is how a small little place is changed into an Italian wonderland! Word of caution: only go there if Italian food is adored by your tastebuds since they have a highly concentrated menu !

Taste: whoever said that the easiest of things are the hardest to make, couldn't be more true! My favourite pizza there is the plain classic margarita ! None of the others could match it, accompanied by the classic aglio Olio also done to perfection , and the meal can be finished with the super yum visually and taste wise: Nutella pizza! Those who care for a three course, could kick start with some burrata on the side and the lemon drink is good too!

Sight: it's truly magical to see how one can convert a tiny place into a warm little Italian restaurant. I am a lover of tiny restaurants which are dotted across cities with their magical offerings and this totally reminds me of them 

Second in line, by the owners of Ala Bella Mozrella!

PS: they have limited seating and long lines, so be sure to book a place, esp on holidays

Fabbrica Della Pizza should be on every pizza lover's "to-go" list. The quaint dinner, located on Allenby Road, close to Forum Courtyard, is a gem of a place. The decor is artsy; gives you the vibes of an Italian pizzeria. The sitting area is partitioned into two halves, the lower one overlooking the not-so-bush Allenby Road and then a faux upper floor which serves as a full-fledged diner. The music is rustic and goes well with the beautiful theme of the restaurant. 
Now the most important part, the food. The menu is small and simple, yet effective. I ordered for a Fab Limonata while my friend went for a Classic Tiramisu. The Fab Limonata was outstanding. It was a concoction of strawberry and orange lemonade with basil. It was moderately sweet and tangy and makes you feel really good. I will certainly recommend this drink on summer evenings when you want to cool down and enjoy the hearty meal that's gonna follow. 
The Classic Tiramisu is one of their most appreciated items and it certainly looks good. It was creamy, it was chocolatey and it was everything my friend wanted. I didn't taste this one, but from the looks on my friend's face, I could make out that she was content beyond words can describe.
Starter was simple, Calamari Fritto Misto. It was literally an explosion of tasty deep fried squid rings. The accompanying dip was a bit too pungent to my liking, but the squid on its own, can win hearts. 
Next comes the most important part - pizza. Any good pizzeria is revered for its authentic and delectable pizzas and Fabbrica Della Pizza takes things up a notch higher. What you get here are not rubbery pizzas with humongous crusts (courtesy Dominos) or paper thin crusts (courtesy some standalone pizza joints in the city), but an entirely different Neapolitan Pizza. Now I'm no connoisseur of pizzas and I can hardly tell what's authentic or not, but their rendition of the Neapolitan pizza certainly won my heart. Neapolitan pizza originated in Naples and is characterised by having crunchy edges and a soggy centre. Neapolitan pizzas usually have more sauce than cheese and that's what makes the pizza soggy and wet. Now enough about the history of Neapolitan pizzas, let's dive into specifics. We ordered for Pollo Piccante which is a pesto based pizza with roast chicken, mozzarella, jalape√±os, caramelised onions and feta cheese. We intentionally opted for pesto as the base, since every other pizza uses tomato sauce. The pizza was finger-licking good. The pesto sauce had an innate earthiness and the feta cheese accentuated the salty earthiness to an altogether different level. Toppings were generous and the pizza was ginormous. 
Finally the meal ended with their much raved Budino which is an amalgamation of vanilla, caramel and dark chocolate cream. It was not too sweet, not too bitter it sour and had the perfect consistency. The Budino is a truly great end to a truly great meal.
Fabbrica Della Pizza is a venture of the guys responsible for Alla Bella Mozzarella at Ballygunge. I was a bit disappointed at ABM, since their pizzas lacked the wow factor. But FDP completely overshadows ABM and I'm sure will win many hearts. Service is excellent and prices are economical, so you can enjoy your lazy Sunday afternoons of evenings gorging on pizzas.

Location ‚Äì It is located in allenbey road in the lane opposite to forum mall.

Ambience ‚Äì The place is divided into levels. Ground floor had live kitchen & small seating arrangements with few seats having great view of road. Upper level is full dine in area. They have an excellent interiors.

Service ‚Äì Service is excellent.

Food & Description ‚Äì Two friends met. Both wanted to have pizza. Both loves mushrooms. Things can't be better than this. Heard a lot of this place for great pizza. Just cudnt resist myself to pay a visit. Coming to the food:


Fab Fungo Pizza - Thin Crust pizza topped with porchini, button, shitake mushrooms, parsley, white truffle oil and imported fontina cheese. I can say the best pizza I have ever had. Mushroom lover should not miss it. It has 4 slices but it's enough for 2 persons.¬†


Overall the experience was excellent. There were a lot of varieties of pizzas & other Italian dishes including customized pizza. Would definitely come back again. Highly Recommended.

Pocket Pinch - 1000 for 2 approx.

This place had been on my wishlist ever since its inception. So i could not contain my excitement when  a very generous friend of mine decided to turn the wish into reality.

Upon entering, i felt that i was immediately transported to one of those charming European cafes. The music they played just added more to the vibe. I was besotted by the prettiness of the place.

For drinks, we ordered the Strawberry and cream shake and Fab Limonata. I personally preffered the later over the former. But my friend raved about the Strawberry shake. The Limonata was tangy, fresh and would chill you down immediately. The shake would be preferred more by those with a sweet tooth.

Now coming to the best part, the pizzas! So we ordered two pizzas. Each consisted of four slices
The first was Fab Fungo, which was super cheesy and loaded with mushrooms and chicken. Guys, I kid you not, it was the best pizza of my life till date. 
The second pizza was from the category of "make my own pizza". We chose mutton, prawns, pomodoro, mozarella, onions, capsicum and mushroom. I was a little skeptical at how it would turn out, especially since I have never had prawns or mutton on my pizza. But, lo and behold! This too stunned me. It was  perfect.  

We decided to  try out their Focaccia Cheese bread and Aglio Olio spaghetti with prawns next.

The bread was soft and cheesy and I personally quite liked the pasta. It was a healthy option after the truckload of calories we consumed. 

We decided to finish off the great dining experience with their famous Budino as dessert. And I loved it to bits. Keep in mind that I am not quite a dessert person, but the Budino was really well made. It was neither too sweet nor too bitter. The cream just melted in my mouth. And the perfect layering of chocolate, caramel and cream with coffee just made it a splendid dessert.

The service was quick and prompt which made our wonderful lunch experience even better. Economically, it will definitely burn a considerable hole in your pocket, but trust me, your tastebuds will keep thanking you for it.

Fabbrica della is one of the new pizzerias in town.
The ambience is pretty attractive.
The service is quick.
Visited this place for lunch yesterday they are quite famous for their Fab fungo pizza which is filled with cheese and mushrooms.
Also they have alot of variaties in their pizzas we created our pizza with the following toppings:
Pomodoro,Mozerella,mutton,capsicum,mushroom ,garlic prawns and fresh onion.
Which tasted really good.
The spaghetti Aglio olio they serve is average.
You should try their strawberry and cream shake and fab limonato which is amazing.
We ended our meal with their dessert Budino which was like the cherry on the cake.

This place qualifies to be one of the top rated pizzerias in town.

I ordered Fab Fungo Pizza, and I created one Pizza. There are 4 slices in each, and is sufficient for 2 people. The pizzas are meaty, cheesy and tasty! You can be really creative and go all out with the create your own pizza. I personally added loads of cheese, mutton and prawn.

I also ordered Parmesan Crema with Bacon. This spaghetti was great, and the pork lovers would surely love it! 

For the beverage, I had Strawberry with Cream. This was okay, have had better drinks for sure.

To end my meal, I had Budino, which was a dessert made up of various layers of chocolate, caramel, and coffee, and this was yum. Not too sweet, just the perfect end to your meal.

Ever since its inception, Fabbrica Della Pizza was on my bucket list. From the makers of Alla Bella Mozzarella, they have come up with the most beautiful delectable pizzas you will come across. The place is beautifully decorated and it will remind you of Italy and Greece. Now coming to the location, it is located in the lane opposite to Forum Mall.

Coming to the food, we had:

Fab Fungo: The best pizza in kolkata i can vouch on that. This pizza consists of mushrooms, white truffle oil and imported fontina cheese. You wont be able to feel the happiness and pleasure i had while having the pizza. It was like heaven. If you had it once you will surely come back for more.

The next pizza that we had was a self created pizza with prawns, muttons, mushroom, pomodoro, capsicum and cheese was perfect.

Pollo Caldo: this was chicken cheese pizza with olive toppings. Ohh i loved this one. Yummm yumm yumm.

Now to satiate our thirts, we had Fab Limonata and Strawberry and cream milkshake. The former was refreshing and the fizziness derived a cooling sensation to our throat while the latter had a punch of sweetness from the strawberry.

The next we had was Parmesan Crema with Bacon. Well this was the creamiest and smooth spaghetti pasta i have ever had. Every bite was soo cheesy.

I also had Pollo Piadina which was basically a chicken wrap. Taste wise it was goodm but nothing special.

Last course always calls for dessert and for this we have Budino. This was a layered dessert with vanilla caf√© creme,caramel and dark chocolate. It was lovely. There was a hint of chicory coffee too. So you get the sweetness from the caramel and the beautiful combination of vanilla and dark chocolate.

Now coming to the price, well if you want quality and flavour, you have to overlook its price and trust me each and every bite is worth paying.

A neatly arranged pizzeria serving good food.

The place is nicely decorated and it made me feel like I was in Europe; probably in some town in Florence. I tried a pizza, spaghetti, calamari and a strawberry shake. I was happy and delighted.

"Pollo Caldo" tasted wonderful. Thin crust pizzas give me immense joy and PC was no less. You will get the details of the toppings in the A La Carte. The pizza was soft, cheesy and delicious - a must have.

"Calamari fritto misto" arrived in a small cycle. Although I am not a big fan of fish eggs I enjoyed munching on them.

"Strawberry and cream milkshake" was an added bonus. Its sweetness and bubble gum like taste made me finish half of it in one gulp.

"Spaghetti Parmesan Crema" had the quintessential aroma of oregano. Added ham made the dish all the more tasty.

I was extremely lucky as I got to hear some live music single handedly done by Miss Tapashi Bhattacharya. She has a mesmerizing voice.

A memorable evening it was at Fabbrica Della Pizza.

Fabbrica Della was on my bucket list ever since it opened its doors. The place is know for its eye catching interiors, straight out of a fairly tale and lip-smacking pizzas.

Located in Allenby road, Elgin a minute walk from forum mall.

And the day I visited, there was a live music performance which allover adds to the mood.

Coming to the food, we ordered -
For coolers we had iced tea (lemon and berry flavour)

For food -
1. Fab fungo- this one pizza, you will definitely be coming back for this. Pizza loaded with mushroom and cheese.

2. Pollo caldo
3. Gamberettie
What I liked most is the base which are hand tossed but not like thin crust pizza which we have mostly on cafes not the thick bread which dominos/pizza hut serves. And for the topings you have a lot of option to choose from. So definitely you can create you own perfect√≥ pizza.

4. Calamari fritto Misto
5. Spaghetti with ham and parmesan cheese.

6. Staberry and cream shake - must try
7. Bundio for dessert.

Do try out this place. Amazing experience and will be coming back soon :D

So, I finally get to tick off this Italian favourite from my list! And what a day to visit the place! Live music just adding to the perfect ambiance!

The place is a little small, but then, they claim themselves to be a Quick Service Restaurant. The decor is very pretty, straight out of a children's picturebook! There are ample opportunities to click the perfect Display Picture you have been looking for. 

And now, coming to the food - I fell in love with it! Their pizzas are undoubtedly one of the cheesiest and most filling pizzas you'll find in the city. My recommendations:
1. Fab Fungo - You will be coming back here for this one again and again, I can vouch for that!
2. Pollo Caldo (for a cheeeesy affair)
3. Gamberetti (for the prawn lovers)
The pizzas here are very unusual and different from the ones you're used to having in Kolkata. No crunchy American thin crust style or Dominos-style thick bread for you to complain about - am sure this is as authentic as it gets! And the cheese and the toppings blend beautifully - the aroma speaks for itself!

And the good bit is that you can select your own toppings as well, and they have quite a variety there.

I also tried their Calamari Fritto Misto, and Spaghetti with Parmesan Cheese and topped with Ham. I love pork, in and out, and am equally fond of Pasta. So I loved the latter, and as for the former, I think I missed the typical rubbery feel of calamaris, but as a snack, it does a pretty good job.

The part of the order that came as a sweet surprise was however, the Strawberry and Cream Shake. Now, I almost detest Strawberry but I just fell in love with this particular one! A must try here!

Concluding the meal with a good one is important, and here came in Budino. I won't say it's a unique dessert, but the taste certainly stays with you. 

Overall, Fabbrica Della has a the perfect ambiance for a lovely evening over pizzas and shakes. Their live music is sure to make you jig and who knows, you might even get to showcase your inner bathroom singer!

We friends were lucky enough to walk in on a music launch event. Located at Allenby road, this place will give you the countryside feels with the amazing decor.

We tried

The fab fungo pizza- So much recommended!! It is a blissful pizza with loads of mushrooms and cheese!

Berry iced tea- A must try drink for cranberry lovers‚ù§Ô∏è

Strawberry Milkshake- A blissful and generous amount of strawberry flavour makes it sooo good!

Pollo colado

I cannot recall an eatery which screamed "cuteness" as much as fabbrica della pizza... Before I move on to the food I have to commend the ambience... Simply beautiful, with flowers and creepers (artificial though, of course) strewn across the walls and ceiling and peppy Italian music playing in the background... The pizzeria takes u to Italy and back. So kudos for the ambiance... Now to the food, we had their two highlights--
Pollo piccante-- This is the pizza which leaves u starstruck and makes u leave the eatery cursing yourself for not having a go at authentic Italian pizza before... The pesto sauce serving as the base of the pizza compiled the whole dish together... The roasted chicken pieces scattered all around were cooked to perfection and melted in the mouth at the first bite... The slight sourness of the jalapenos balanced the sweetness of the mozzarella... All the ingredients married perfectly togetherüòá
Pollo piadina-- Everyone, please have this if u are at this place... It is happiness packed in a wrap... The chicken, spinach, and the cheese seemed to come straight out of heaven... The best part of the wraps was the caramelised onions. Absolutely satisfiedüòÑ
The service was top notch... The waiter who attended to us explained each preparation with care so that we didn't have a problem to choose among all the difficult- named Italian items. The best part of the fabbrica experience was that it is perfectly pocket friendly... Overall, a beautiful experience which doesn't poke a big hole in ur pocketüòá

Customised pizza is one thing you can look forward to, I can assure you that!
We had ordered squid rings, which was nice, but a little softer wouldn't have hurt my mouth. The pizzas were delicious. Order from a menu comprising of a variety of sauces, add-ons, veggies/non-veg alike.

Visited this pizzeria for dinner on a weekday. It's always crowded and a prior reservation is recommended. We tried their piazza which had sun dried tomatoes, roasted garlic, pomodro and dry pesto. For sides we took a veg paidina which was a wrap with mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, spinach, pesto and bell peppers. It was delicious. We had also ordered a dunken dip - Gorgonzola crema which was average. To complete our meal we ordered a tiramisu shake and a berry iced tea which were amazing.

So we were craving to go to this place for quite some time and ultimately did go to have a fantastic dinner. Located in front of Forum Mall. Every thing was perfect about this place, ambience, decorations, music, staffs and of course the food. If you tired of normal basic pizzas of domino's and pizza Hut, make sure you should visit this place once to try varieties of authentic pizzas. 

Now come to the food. In pizzas, we ordered Fab Fungo(recommended), Margherita, Pollo Piadina. The taste was amazingly great. 

In beverages, we ordered classic Tiramisu,  cookies and cream (recommended). Both are mind blowing and mood swinger and last but not the least the desserts. We had Affoggoto and Budino. As the name were unique their taste too. Budino was awesome with three layers having dark chocolate, caramel and vanilla ice cream. Service was good as well as staffs behaviour. Make your visit asap to have mind blowing experience.

The one thing constant through out my visit to this little pizzeria, was "AMAZING".
Interior , decor, ambience, music, staff, the walls, doors, everything was absolute perfection. 
Needless to say the food was soulful. Feeds the soul, and your tummy. 
We ordered for a Tiramisu shake, which was subtle. Cookies and cream shake- had a bite to it, loved the whipped cream touch. 
Special mention Fab Lemonata -strawberry lemonade, fizzy and refreshing. Love! 
Being a coffee lover , had to order a cafe mocha, it was a decent warm hug for me! 
Settled for Aglio oglio spaghetti with bacon. Authentic taste, with a tinge of chilly more than expected. 
Grilled chicken wrap - (piadena rollo) an average dish. Didn't like the rocket leaves in it, but the filling otherwise was tasty. 
Coming to the pizzas, we ordered for Margherita and pepperoni pizza. Fab pizzas. Tasty , delectable and finger licking good. 

Now the desserts. 
Affogato and Budina were our choices.
I liked the affogato, came with the espresso shot. 
Budina was a solid mousse with cake at the base. Decent one. 

Go there asap for amazing ambience and to enjoy authentic pizzas of Naples. üòç

This place is situated right opposite to the lane of Forum Mall courtyard. The ambience is amazing and represents a posh dining restaurant. The lighting is good and the ceilings are decadently decorated along with the wall graffitis.

Wow!!! Thats the first word that came to mind while writing up this review! This place is a paradise for pizza lovers! They are class apart and I really mean it! They have introduced this really cool idea of serving authentic Neapolitan pizza. The pizzas are soggy in the middle with crisp thin crusts which is slightly doughy around the edges. The sauce and the cheese will make it soggy in the middle and it is a treat for your taste buds.
The flavor profiles of the pizzas are really simple. Not overloaded with toppings and there is no fancy stuff. They have stuck with the original flavors and toppings as you would expect from an Italian pizza outlet.
Now I am not an expert on Italian cuisine but I do follow David Rocco's show on Italian cuisine and I must say the pizza looked very authentic indeed. Taate wise it was delectable!
So we had the following pizzas:
1. Pepperoni pizza: absolute delish. Loaded with big slices of pepporini, it tasted amazing. The cheese was not overpowering at all.
2. Fab fungo: Big chunks of sauteed mushrooms which were oh so good. The cheese and the pizza sauce complemented the mushrooms well. A must try!
3. Margharita: it had mozzarella, basil and tomato base sauce. It was a classic. Simple and elegant.

The thing about their pizzas are that they are light on your stomach and you can actually taste the simplicity of the Italian cuisine.

Next came the grilled chicken salad. It ha rocket leaves, toasted pine nuts, ample grilled chicken and a simple salad dressing ( olive oil predominantly). Not really for everybody's palate but suited mine quite well.

The agio olio spaghetti was a simple dish with lots of garlic, chilli flakes and a parsley. We had the ham add on to it and the dish was rustic yet tasty. Very simple flavors.

We had the tiramisu shake and the cookies and cream shake. Both were good. The tiramisu was really good to taste.

The dessert were Affagato and Budino. Both were good and presented in a unique way. Typical Italian desserts using coffee and espresso to build the flavor base.

This place is highly recommended for its pizza and its beverages. Although a tad bit pricy, the food will make up for it.

One of the premier restaurants in Kolkata, known mainly because of their eye catching and jaw dropping pizzas, fabbrica della was on my bucket list since the time it opened its doors! Better late than never, i finally visited this place and let me tell you, you are in for a treat! They have carved out a special place in my heart owing to their lip-smacking pizzas!

The location couldn't have been more prime, being a minutes walk from forum mall! Now coming to the food! Oh the food!
If you are a pork aficionado, then the aglio olio and the pork pizza (pepperoni ) would be your ideal pick! The pizza was juicy and succulent, loaded with pork! The spaghetti was spicy and classy with adequate pork fillings!
The margherita pizza was too good to be true! I could literally feel the different layers of cheese!

For all those health conscious people out their (me inclusive) the grilled chicken salad is a soul satisfying pick!

We had ordered a few shakes and drinks which were quite refreshing and ignited our appetites! The fab lemonala was the perfect summer drink, apt to beat the heat whereas the tiramisu and the cookies and cream shake literally shook me up with their brilliance! The presentation of the shakes was commendable too!
They make some really fine coffee too, i tried their cafe mocha and it was quite energising!

We tried a few of their deserts, namely the budino which was quite cute in terms of presentation and the affogato which was visually appealing, and it tasted, well! i shall leave that for you to find out! I was craving for one more!

The service i felt could be have been slightly fast, though i am not complaining! ticked off from my bucket list finally! Double tick coming soon!

This time the destiny took me to Fabbrico Della Pizza and it says i went to experience the best of the Manufacturers of Pizza who located themselves to a very fine location of Allenby Road,Elgin Road just opposite foot to Forum Mall. The place has been decorated wonderfully with some comfortable sitting arrangements starting from the ground floor to the first floor. Ambiance is surely a thing to mention about this place, they well know about the choices of ambiance about the Kolkatans and so decorated the interiors and ¬†exteriors with some fine lightings and Italian finish. Tried and given the best to make you feel like having a pizza hangout at an Italian pizza outlet. Service has been good and price pinch is kept friendly to your pockets.
We just got together and grabbed our seats and so it happened like this....

1. ¬†Fab limonata - A great looking thirst buster for this hot summer evenings very well complementing the Pizzas over the table. Try to grab one to make the experience a sweeter one with the flavours of Basil, strawberry and orange lemonade.

2. Pizza Al Nutella - I am a fan of nutella and what can make it even better if you got to have a nutella pizza with the crunch of almonds. The thick crust and thin layer of bread decorated with the sweet taste of nutella over just gave me some goosebumps.

3. Genovese Pizza - Taking over the sweetness here comes the pizza containing the spread of pesto, Mozarella, cheery olives and tomatoes. That giving some wonderful flavour to the spread over cheese.

4. Pollo Piadina - This one made me real hungry with the kind of size and shape and with the wrap of bread with grilled chicken, caramalised onions, tomatoes and creamy pesto just did the right thing to cover up my hunger.

This very new inclusion to the Pizza industry gonna bring some revolution for sure in making some mouth watering pizzas. I guess every other outlets should watch out their back because the Fabbrico Della is here.

Located near Forum Mall,Fabbrica Della is the newest addition to the city's pizza scene. And how good are their pizzas....Oh My God!! The ambience will totally win you over. It's decorated prettily with attention to detail. I loved the mural on the first floor, along with the quaint balcony which is perfect for taking great pictures. We had the following:
#Pepperoni Pizza- Awesome from the get go. Oodles of mozarella cheese with a generous amount of pepperoni, spread on a thin crust and baked to perfection. This was marvellous üíìüíì
#Genovese Pizza- This is a vegetarian pizza predominantly spread with pesto, olives,cheese and pine nuts. Unusual combination, tasted good.
#Fab Fungo Pizza- Loaded with cheese and couple of different types of mushrooms, this one was amazing as well.
#Focaccia bread served with pesto
#Pollo Piadina- Basically a grilled chicken wrap. Was good :-)
#Calamari fritto misto- Deep fried calamari with garlicky cheesy dip. I enjoyed this dish a lot. Good presentation too.
#Tiramisu Milkshake- Simply Amazing üòçüòçüòç. Must try milkshake!
#Fab Limonata- Great option for a fizzy drink. Very refreshing and flavourful drink.
#Budino- A dessert consisting of vanilla creme,caramel and chocolate. Loved it to the core üòä was yummy...!
#Pizza Al Nutella- Dessert pizza served with a generous smearing of Nutella with toasted almonds on top. Simply sinful is all I can say. Don't miss this one when ur here!
At the end of our dinner me and my friends were left rubbing our tummy with smiles on our faces. Thank you for the good times Fabbrica Della!!

Located near Forum mall, this Italian place is a marvel for pizza lovers. Not only does it serve the best italian pizza in kolkata but it also masters in the italian pizza joint ambiance. There are two levels. And both are equally pretty. I opted to sit upstairs where i could find yellow lights and creepers hanging from the ceiling. The paining on the wall was almost like i could see a scene. 
Now coming to the food, il just mention the best dishes which one should absolutely not miss 
For drinks 
Milkshake Tiramisu : a coffee flavoured drink with whipped cream and a tasty biscuit 
Fab limonata : strawberry based lime drink perfect compliment with your pizza when you are too bored of coke
Hot Chocolate : guilty pleasure with two marshmallows 
Pizza
Pepperoni Pizza: Heaven. Right amount of cheese or should i say a lot of cheese and pork! Must try! 
Genovese pizza : pesto based pizza which was surprisingly packed with flavours
Appetisers 
Fried Calamari : perfect start to the course. Served with a great dip
Pollo padina : a wrap which was so delicious that it filled up half of my appetite.
Dessert 
Budino: it was like indulging in the finest milk chocolate 
Pizza al nutella : a perfect ending dish to pass around the table for the quantity.

You just need to taste the finest things on earth once in a while and this place is definitely gonna give you an opportunity for the same ;)

Location : Opposite lane of Forum mall (the back gate).

As I entered this place,I was awestruck with its soothing flowery ambiance. Being a photolover I just couldn't resist my urge to get clicked against the beautiful Italiano walls and corners.
Music played in the background was so apt theme wise.
Well coming to the food I would start with the üîΩTiramishu shake. Having a sore throat, at first I thought of skipping this shake but then the visual treat wasn't just enough for me as it arrived.
I just couldn't give up on it! Creamy..yummy..n sugary at its best!
It's a MUST TRY guysüëç
Next came the üîΩPepperoni pizza. And how can it go wrong when its Pepperoni with whole lot of cheese you see üòâ
This comes from a non pizza lover so you can completely go by my take on this one! Superb in one word!
üîΩGenouse pizza would be a "bang on" meal for the veggies. Beautifully decorated with olives and cheese and it tastes great I must say.
üîº Focaccia,a flat oven baked Italiano product was served to us with an unique appetizer. Neither sweet nor spicy. 
üîºCalamai fritto misto was all about some amazing squid fries accompanied with mayonnaise. Wish it never ended üôà

Desserts lovers take a noteüòä
üîΩHot dark chocolate can never go wrong with marshmallows. This place surely knows the trick and topped in it!üëç
üîºIf you're a Nutella lover you can't go past this item. Spread generously with Nutella this sweet little Nutella pizza will steal your heart for sure üòç
üîº I would be biased with my favourite desert item now and that has to be Budino.
Perfectly coupled with whipped cream the iconic pudding like dessert tastes like heaven.
Rich and so creamyüòç
‚ù§Last but not the least comes BURRATA. Well intentionally I had saved this item to treat it as a showstopper!
Burrata¬†is a fresh¬†Italian¬†cheese made from¬†mozzarella and¬†cream. 
The outer shell was solid mozzarella, while the inside contained stracciatella¬†and cream, giving it an unusual, soft texture. It was more of a curious dish for me.
The soft cheese being teamed up with Italiano tiny bread pieces and olive oil tastes pleasurable. 
Fresh and brilliant presentation a whole.
Happy with the service too üëçüëç
Highly recommended.

This place was on my list for a long time. Finally managed to drop in today. Decor=simplistic and mind blowing. Pretty backdrops for the perfect selfies and dps. üòÅ
Apart from that the food is seriously good. Started of with a tiramisu shake which won't disappoint you at all. Topped with whipped cream and a lady finger biscuit it is yum. Then came the pepperoni pizza. The cheesiest pizza you can imagine. They have a manual on how to have their pizzas and I kid you not it will come handy. Then I tried the genousse pizza which was basically a pesto veg pizza topped with Cherry tomatoes , back olives and pine nuts. I loved the combination of pesto in a pizza. I will try it again definitely. The foccacia with a pesto dip was a basic item. The fried calamari is a winner in every sense. The fab limento is really fab. Strawberry crush with orange and lemon juice.refreshing and sweet. The burrata is the costliest item on the menu. Mozzarella cheese mixed with cream and served with olives pesto and two foccacia pieces. Only for crazy cheese lovers! 
The budino was a winner in my dessert section. I had thought that the nutella pizza would take that place but I was surprised that the budino won my heart. Oh the layers of milk chocolate caramel and white chocolate pudding was the perfect combination one could ask for. 
Everyone must drop by once. 
Kudos to the management for maintaining the place so beautifully.

Loads of carbs, stringy goo of cheese, soul-satisfying proteins ‚Äì I‚Äôm talking about my favourite kind of comfort food, i.e. Italian food with all the food groups on a single plate. And, it‚Äôs not just pizza. To be honest, I‚Äôm actually a little tired of the same items with different names on the menus of the pizzerias delivering the generic pizzas in 30 minutes. All right, I know that for someone who often catches the fascination to get fit and eat healthy, loading up on carbs and fat is not always ideal. But, that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not always on the lookout for a goof place where I can indulge in good Italian delights. And I just found an incredible place. Fabbrica Della Pizza in Elgin offers beautiful food and a festive ambience that will surely lift your mood any time you‚Äôre looking for some respite!

Went here for dinner as we were craving for pizza. This place is amazing- I was pleasantly surprised to really find the authentic taste of Napolitan pizza in India/kolkata. They use a wood fire oven which imparts a special flavour to the crust; a huge plus.
Ambience: 5*
Food 5* (we only ordered pizza)
Drinks- no alcohol.- this is the only minus. Fab Limonato tasted good, you can also have soft drinks.
Highly recommended for one of the best pizzas.

This place definitely serves one of the best pepperoni pizza I've ever tasted with loads of cheese. The reason for my marking it 4 is i found the place a little pricey. But nevertheless, bon appetite.

Pizza lovers in Calcutta have got a new place to visit, which boasts of authentic Neapolitan style pizzas. This place is located on Allenby Road, close to Forum Mall. I was invited here by First Idea PR for a bloggers meet.

The place is well decorated. The ground floor has the kitchen and a few seats, which give an excellent view of the road. The mezzanine floor houses the actual dining area, which is good enough to accomodate close to 20-25 people at a time. The beautifully designed walls and the ceiling covered with vines, present a unique decor for the diners.

The menu is quite huge and detailed, not just restricted to pizzas. It was a hot summer afternoon and a mocktail was quite a necessity. Fab Limonata, which contained starwberry and orange juicy, along with a hint of basil, served the purpose. It was chilled, flavourful and very refreshing.

We further went for the special Italian milkshakes. I tried two flavours - Classic Tiramisu and Cookies and Cream, where the latter was my favourite. The milkshakes were extremely rich, being the perfect milkshakes I've had since a long time. The flavours were on spot. The Tiramisu shake had a beautiful flavour of coffee while the Cookies and Cream had crushed cookies mixed well in the shake.

Next, we had the appetizers on our table. The first one was Calamari Fritto Misto, which had deep fried calamari rings served in a bucket in the backseat of a mini bicycle. It was served with a garlic caper sauce. The rings were crispy and well fried. The second one was Pollo Piadina, which had grilled chicken, rucola, caramelised onions, marinated tomatoes and creamy pesto wrapped in a flat bread. The wrap tasted out of the world. The stuffing was tangy and extremely juicy, with a special mention to the succulent chicken chunks

The pizza was what I was eagerly waiting for. I tried Pollo Piccante, which had fresh pesto, mozzarella, roast chicken, jalapenos, caramelised onions and feta. The pizza had an extremely soft crust and was very cheesy. It turned out to better than I had expected.

The Spaghetti bowl containing Spaghetti in Parmesan Crema with fried bacon was an absolute delight. The spaghetti was well boiled and the sauce tasted amazing. The bacon was well fried. This is something I would definitely recommend to everyone.

For desserts, I tried a lot of variants. The Affoggato, which is vanilla ice cream served with a shot of Espresso, tasted good. I loved the Budino, which had vanilla cafe cream, caramel and dark chocolate cream arranged in layers. This was my favourite among the desserts. The Pizza Al Nutella, which was recommended by the staff, turned out to be excellent. Pizza was smeared with Nutella and topped with crushed roasted almonds. The dough could have been a little soft, but the nutella made it a sinful affair.

Overall, Fabbrica Della Pizza is a must visit place for every pizza lover. They have a large number of pizzas and it's tough to make a choice. Not only Neapolitan pizzas, this place also has some great pastas, starters and desserts. I loved the milkshakes as well. I'm coming here soon to try the other amazing pizzas on the menu.

Ever wondered what it is like entering a place completely different and new to you in your own city ?Well i experienced something of that sort when i visited FABBRICA DELLA,PIZZA place in¬†8A, Allenby Park, Elgin road which is very close to the well known Forum Mall . I happened to come here by an invite sourced by Abhishek of First Idea Pr. And i must thank him for that abundantly as it was a reverie moment for me to be here.

Horrible pizzas!!! Half burnt and raw, the pizzas taste awful. With an above average decor, this place serves food that calls for a regret. The spaghetti was horrendous too. Good service though. The only good thing about the place is the decor. Not at all recommended.

All in all a good place and can be tried once. Located at Allenby road is convenient for people especially if you are headed to forum. The place is known for its pizza and sadly that's the only thing which is worth trying. The Spagetti and pasta are very ordinary and the quantity is very less. The pizza are good in taste as well as quantity. 'The Make your own pizza' is a good option and you may want to try it. But yes do take note of the add ons because the staff here is pretty inexperienced and as a result won't be able to guide you properly.¬†

Ambiance: 3.5/5
Food: 3/5
Service: 2.5/5

I went on a Friday evening to try this place out..the ambience was nice and good perfect lighting effect and the artificial flowers on the rooftop..I liked the idea..place was empty and it's a small place also.
Staff was courteous and fast in service.
Food-
They have options to customize pizza of your choice or select from amongst the options provided by them..we chose piazza..it's a veg pizza ..thin crust.. 11 inches 4 sliced pizza.
The side of the pizza crust was over baked and I personally did not like the aftertaste of pomodoro with cheese and basil and tomato..others may like maybe..
When in the feedback form I gave a poor rating to the food the staff head came to ask the reason. He was humble and said sorry and said he will try to improve on it.

Finally a place so elegant and classy has opened its door in Kolkata. From the gallery to the chandelier to the roof and the walls, there isn't a single thing that I would like to change there.
The attendants are so helpful in deciding just the correct type of pizza to be ordered.
The food, well needless to say is mind blowing. You get to customize your pizza, from the sauce to the type of cheese and the toppings you want in your pizza. These guys have it all covered. 
A must visit place for the pizza lovers and those who are not, I am sure they would certainly fall for it now.

P.S. these guys have brought back pineapple topping for you to add in your pizzaüòçüòç

I decided to check out Fabbrica Della Pizza today, having wondered for quite a while how the new pizzeria fitted in to the city's food scene. Their interiors are great, and really makes you feel comfortable immediately, with a mediterranean homestead feel to the place. I chose to build my own pizza rather than try their signature pies, and also ordered a Fab Limonata as a liquid accompaniment. Their pizza was delicious, with excellent quality toppings and the feel of a good oven fresh pizza. The service was also good, although perhaps a bit too intrusive for my liking. I was disappointed at their prices, though, as it proved to be a very expensive dining experience. While the pizza itself was priced as per standards set by other pizzerias in the city, the drink was a little too expensive for a simple mocktail, and despite the recent moves against imposing a service charge on the bill, the charge here was a hefty 6.5%. So although food wise I could not begrudge them lofty praise, the overall experience is something that was not very satisfying.

The location of this joint is quite easy to understand. It's on the opposite ally to the forum mall. Which fascinated us most about this place is their decoration and ambiance. You will certainly feel like that you have come into some  old Mediterranean  house with soft yellow light and old props.¬†

We ordered calamari(deep fried squid rings with garlic paper sauce) and our customized pizza with pesto, mozzarella, black olives and roasted chicken.... It was a 11"*4 pizza hence enough for the four of us. One thing I should mention about their customized pizza, that the base price of this pizza is 300/- with one sauce and base... Now if you want to add any toppings on it, it will be priced accordingly above that. Both of the dishes was good.¬†

On dessert we ordered Budino which was fabulous in taste. We really liked those three layers of vanilla, caramel and dark chocolate. Except that we ordered a can of sprite which has nothing to tell about!

Overall a nice place. Both as a food joint as well as a boozing point.

Too expensive and the crust of the pizza was burnt. We had ordered for a customised pizza and a strawberry nutella pizza but we're disappointed with both. Nothing worth the 4 rating that I had seen on Zomato. These days friends and relatives of the restaurant owners rate the place high and as a result normal people like me who like to spend money of good food gets misguided. Earnest request to Zomato not to promote such misguided ratings.

We were going to another restaurant in the vicinity when we changed our mind and decided to try out this new pizzeria.( Why???) Rue that decision, if only we hadn't changed our mind...We would have been happier and our purses wouldn't have been so much lighter!!! Didn't like this place at all, it's overly expensive and the food quality and quantity do not satisfy at all. It is definitely not value for money!! We don't mind paying more but you should feel satisfied and happy after a meal, which was not the case here.The Piazza and fab limonato were the only saving grace in our dining experience at this joint. Not that they were excellent but okayish. The parmesan creams and Pomodoro bowl, both were awful. The white pasta one was absolutely tasteless and dry. The other one too was simply a lump. The service was too slow and not up to the mark. The decor is good but one comes to be happy with the food which wasn't the case here.

Easily identifiable with its beautiful decor, this pizzeria could possibly be one of my finest experiences in town.
Prompt service, lip smacking thin crust pizzas and shakes possibly scores an 11 on 10.

P.S.: Update subject to subsequent visit ;)

To say that my friends and I are impressed by this new place, would be an understatement! 

Located very conveniently near Forum Mall, this quaint little Pizzeria was exactly something that Calcutta needed! The minute I stepped into the place, it was like being in Tuscany! The interiors have been done very prettily! The walls, painted with rural Italian landscapes and the tables would have you transported to the turn-of-the-century Pizzerias, found in Italy of yester years. 

Their menu is quite interesting where they have some pre-put together options for the pizzas and the pastas as well as the fact that you can make your own with individual choice of toppings. We tried 3 of their pre-defined pizzas. Forgive me for not remembering the exact names, but the first one we tried was with Spinach & Ham, with an abundance of mozzarella. Delicious! Following that we tried one with Mushrooms and Ham and this was even better than the first! But the best was indeed for the last. This one had garlic shrimps and Bechamel on it! It was like a burst of flavors in our mouths. We couldn't get over it! 

We also had their Spaghetti with Bacon in White Sauce which was quite yummy but the portions were extremely disappointing. 

For drinks we had their iced teas in various flavors as well as the Hot Chocolate & Cafe Mocha. The Hot Chocolate deserves special mention with its two Marshmallows & decadently smooth, thick taste. Best Hot Chocolate in a while for me! 

So great food, great place. Definitely worth trying out!

Went for lunch with my bestie and was quite surprised to see the place being packed. We ordered a salad with greens, feta, cherry tomato and almonds which is quite disappointing in terms of flavour and quantity. Next was the pesto spaghetti which again was very less in portion and I was expecting it to b cream based but it wasn't. Now the place is supposed to be known mainly for its pizzas and let me tell you even dominoes Serves better pizzas. The crust was soggy we had to scrape through to even manage to hold the pizza. A good thin crust pizza is crisp and cheesy .. this was so soggy and rubbery. Total waste of money.. the place is done up well.. but it's so small that their isn't much room for space and privacy will you dine here. The only thing saved it was the ice tea but I think in this heat anything chilly tastes good.Not going back for sure.

Food was good,but it can be more delicious. We were two people out‚Äã for a sunday lunch and couldn't be more excited to visit the most talked pizzeria in town.
It is located near forum mall and is easy to locate. The two floor restaurant has a beautiful Italian decor but the first floor sitting arrangement could me more spaced out.
We ordered two pizzas and two drinks but couldn't pick much different items. We could expect to have some good side dish options ( for non vegetarians).
I found the pizza average in taste.Food was more aunthetic and delicious in their first outlet Alla Bella mozerella, atleast you could have more options to taste Italian delicacy.
If you are hungry for a pizza then you can surely try this place.

My quest for trying out new eateries around the town, took me to Fabrica Della Pizza. Wood fired pizzas being the new darling of the city dining scene. This is conveniently located in Allenby Park Lane(the lane opposite the Forum mall on Elgin Road). Was easy to find. I try and take a window seat most times, the filtered day light always helps in getting good pictures. 

Being a firm believer in the KISS approach towards life
in general. I tend to keep things simple and stupid. Service was prompt and with a smile. I was handed a paper menu checklist and a pencil to mark my choices. 

After quickly browsing the options, decided in favour of the Quattro Formagio aka 4-cheese pizza. Having recently given up on sugary carbonated drinks. Ordered myself an Italian iced tea with a special request of serving the sugar syrup on the side. To be nothing short of brutally honest, the iced tea was just that, iced tea. Nothing Italian about it. 

The pizza was served in just  under 13 mins.  So far so good. I have to admit that this was clearly the best pizza I had in the city. Interestingly the pie was not round but almost oblong. 4 hearty slices. If I had to pick a bone. It would be with it being a tad bit too salty for my taste. I think the feta cheese had something to do with it. That apart, it just hit the sweet spot. 

It measured up well on my expectation meter. I paid my debt to society, which totalled to be a buck short of 750. I made a promise to return here with my pizza loving kids. Soon!

A pretty pizzeria with quirky decor. The quality of food is right up there with the best pizza places in town. The pepperoni pizza and shrimp pasta were both exquisite, but the milk shakes were a let down. The portion sizes, especially that of the pasta, are very disappointing and not at all corresponding to their prices.

1 ,This is the best I could give to a Fabrica which is a branch of my favorite Alla Bella. No where near it. Very limited menu. Bad and soggy pizzas, they just serve you the least possible toppings on pizzas. And to top it all the server told me that we only make soggy pizzas and cannot make it crisp. That's our speciality. Oh WOW!!

Guys with the big üê∂ in business like Pizza Hut and Dominos the pizzeria manages to tick its name as it serves authentic wood fire pizza.

Ya it's not the suddenly the best pizza still it's no wonders that the combination of the ingredients and varieties suddenly makes it stand out in the crowd.

Its crust was perfect and pomodaro sauce was üòä toppings was not evenly spread still the pizza was too good.

A very very expensive place, and the food is also not good. The portions are extremely small, can't be shared by ever  two people. 
I order spaghetti which came in 2 small bowls, very plain, nothing great. 
Pizzas had nothing, weren't baked properly and each costed at least 500.
The shakes were very mundane and not at all tasty. 
Service is very slow. 
Need to reduce the price by huge numbers. 

All over it was a bad experience!

I visited this place on the 30th of April with my best friend. 

We both like pizza and try to try pizza every where possible. As aficionados, we are rather particular about the stuff we eat ‚Äì should be well baked, crispy and have little mozarella but extra toppings. 
FDP had nothing going for it. 

The pizza tasted below par and the pesto pasta was absolutely terrible. With olive oil over flowing, the pasta was more oil less pesto. The waiter didn't acknowledge it and the first bill we got had the pasta in it. 

Little things go a long way in building a restaurant's reputation and/or loyalty. 

Dissatisfying experience for a restaurant which has the most European name and ambience. Underwhelmed.

Heard so much about this place and finally tried it today. It's a small place and it was quite loud with so many people so close by. The music only added to the discomfort.
The service was very disappointing. The Fresh Lime we ordered at the very start came almost at the end of the meal after two reminders. It was served cold when we had specifically wanted room temperature.
The pizza was served to us without the additional toppings we had ordered. It was quite soggy and impossible to cut with the knives on the table!
The spaghetti portion was small and served in a flimsy plastic bowl.
Absolutely no reason for us to go back again.

I heard of this place serving great pizzas for quite some time now. Me and my boyfriend wanted to spend a quite evening after a rather hectic day and so, we headed for this cozy little joint. Situated just a few metres from Forum Mall, this is a great place for a relaxed evening with your bunch of friends or your loved one. The interior resembled to that of a typical Italian cafe with wooden floorboards and artificial‚Äã flowers hanging from flower pots. The not-too-stark lighting added to the calm and romantic ambience.

Since we were not too hungry, we stuck to a basic pizza and something to sip along with it. We chose to customize our pizza: on the regular base, we selected the pomodoro sauce with mozarella cheese and added red bell peppers, capsicum and roasted garlic. To go along with it, my boyfriend ordered a can of Coke and I got a Tiramisu Shake for myself. The pizza was really good- soft from the inside and a not too dry crust. Cut into four slices, they were enough for those who aren't hard-time hungry. They could've filled in more with the veggies, though; I found it to be on the lesser side. But the taste was, nonetheless, amazing. Talking about the Tiramisu Shake, I really liked that punch of coffee into it and the sweet cream topping was just perfect. Overall, a good evening snack for the day.

Ambience: 4.5/5
Food: 4/5
Staff: 4/5
Pocket Pinch: ‚Çπ743 for two.

I would like to see some more options for appetizers and on the customizable pizza section as well! Only three choices ‚Äãof veggies aren't really enough. üòê

Would definitely come back for more pizzas!

We were a table of 5. The total bill came to approximately Rs. 4000 which isn't bad for how much we ate.
We ordered the fried calamari for starters and it came in this plastic black container. Then, as we dug in we learnt that the calamari was chewy and the batter it was fried in was soggy and mushy. We ended up paying for it but didn't really have more than a bite.

We ordered three separate pizzas for main course. The pizza's were good(1 vegetarian pizza and 2 non-vegetarian pizzas).

I don't have much to say about service because it was pretty basic - take the order and then deliver our food to the table.

Decor was the biggest plus point here.

I know its a new restaurant, so i'm sure there are still a lot of improvements to be made.

This place is a gem. Period.

When I first heard that Alla Bella Mozarella has a separate branch, that too a fully fledged pizzeria, I was excited as anything. My experiences at Alla Bella have been fantastic and therefore, the expectations from Fabbrica Della Pizza were naturally high. 
And boy, did it deliver. Amazing decor, amazing food, amazing staff, this place has it all. In my opinion,  there's nothing to nitpick. 

So we created three different pizzas. The exact composition is a bit too detailed to be mentioned here but I can assure the reader that you can't go wrong with most of the permutations,  unless you add Rocket leaves. The only reason why this place doesn't get a complete five from me is because of this veg condiment called Rocket leaves which none in my group liked. Not even a bit. Everything else was just perfect. 

Also ordered a Hot Dark chocolate and a Tiramisu Milkshake. Believe me, the richness of both the beverages were mind blowing. The cup of hot chocolate was the stuff of heavens. 

The decor is very admirable. The place is not enormous but it isn't cooped up either. Also, the place has a retro charm that works really well. 
As for the service, everyone was cordial and attentive. A brilliant place to have fun, and to gorge on possibly the best pizzas in the city. Highly recommended.

Had heard a lot about the place so decided to give it a visit. 
Not at all satisfied. 
The service was EXTREMELY SLOW and we had to wait a lot for the food. 
We ordered the Bruttini which was too less in quantity and looked like the complimentary breadbasket one is served before the main meal comes. 
The Spaghetti Agliolio was overpriced for its quantity and would barely serve even one person with a proper appetite. 
Next the fab fungo pizza and make your own pizza were equally disappointing. 
The pizzas barely had any taste. The crust was thick and soggy. And was just too cheesy which wasn't helping the flavour at all. 
All in all a very bad experience and too overly priced. 
Wouldn't recommend the place. 
Guess the only good thing was the ambience.

Had been hearing about this place for quite some time, and finally decided to go for a pizza lunch. 
The decor of this place gives that authentic Italian pizzeria vibe. The seating arrangement, the ceilings, the walls, is just perfect.
Coming to food, we first took the Create your own pizza, where we added garlic shrimps, ham, mushrooms, caramelized onions with pomodoro sauce.  Second, we took the Indalian pizza, which had minced mutton with coriander and feta cream. This was on the slightly spicy side. 
Both were absolutely delicious. Lots of meat, perfect amount of cheese. 
The server made it a point to help us choose the toppings, according to the weight our pizza crust can take. He was helpful, and efficient.
A pizza lover has to visit this place. ‚ù§@

The only reason for the 4.0 is because the waiter misheard me and hence it took a while for the bill to arrive. Other than it was a great experience eating here. The ambience is lovely, I was reminded of that original Casa Toscana in Chowringee i.e. Rustic romantic Tuscany. The pizza and the drinks were amazing. I would say that you will see the Nutella pizza and want to order it but choose another dessert. It's not bad but after the fantastic main course it will underwhelm you.

The best pizza I've had till date. 
Food: 4.5/5 
Ambience : 5/5 
Decor : 5/5 
Staff : 4.5/5 
(Held back those 0.5s because this was my first visit and I'm yet to explore it well) 

Went there at 1PM and the security guard told us they'll open in half an hour. So we went back around 20 min later and chose to sit on the mezzanine floor. The decor is beautiful, neither too much nor too little, just perfect. They really made good use of the space available and the decor and ambience ensures a pleasant experience. 

 I like their menu, it's a check-list, they give you the menu and a pencil and you can tick what you want; ensures that orders don't get mixed up or anything. That said, hope they would expand the options on the menu. 
You can experiment with toppings since they have option for "create your own pizza". We decided to try pollo caldo and pollo piadina. 

The pizza, pollo caldo, was the best I've had till date. Base was so soft, neither too thin (like that served at nearby Cafe Mezzuna) nor too thick (like Domino's & Pizza Hut). 11" pizza sliced in 4 pieces. Decided to try their Home-made pesto dip as well, didn't like the dip too much. 
Ordered the pollo piadina, thought they would serve it first but it came after the pizza. The place was packed so they probably struggled a bit, hopefully next time it'll be a bit smoother. 

Can't complain even a bit about the taste. Every bite was amazing. Though the pollo piadina, priced at 220 (+tax) felt a bit overpriced for the quantity. 
Pocket pinch 850/- after tax. 
Will update the review after the next visit.

The moment you enter this place it's like a little place in Italy! The interiors are beautiful. The staff is polite. 
The service is super quick. 
We tried the focassia bread with dips, the aglio oglio spaghetti bowl, pesto bowl and the pizza. Without a doubt one of the BEST pizzas I've had in this city. 
Toppings are also great. 

The only reason I'm not giving them a 5 star is because the portions are really tiny in comparison to the prices. Otherwise it's a MUST TRY!!! I see this place giving good competition to Fire N Ice!

Another new place with terrible service.

The name should be changed to the list world. All waiters along with one of the co owner looks lost. 
I was served twice the food which I didn't order.

Ordered aglio olio which was good. Ordered a fungi pizza which was undercooked , 11-12" pizza cut into 4 slices. When I asked the waiter to cut it into smaller portion they said the kitchen is bizzi. 

All pizza are priced at 300, but the mushroom was priced @600. They add mushroom worth 300????
STRANGE

Lastly when I called for the bill had to wait for 15 mins for the bill to arrive. I told that I don't want to pay the service charge , so that guy took the bill to rectify it and it took another 20 minute to rectify the bill.


Total waste of money & and a good evening 
I guess the guy at cash counter should go to school and learn to use a calculator

A small place that is well interiored. Every space is well utilised and has soothing ambience. We ordered a piazza which I found to be below average with no proper flavor. For pesto lovers, pesto spaghetti bowl is must as spaghetti is tossed in pesto leaves which gives a good flavor of pesto.

If you love Italian food then paying a visit to Fabbrica Della should be on top of your priority list! No one does pizza better than this place. Its been only 2 days since my last visit and I can't wait to get back there again.
Though the ambience of the restraunt is great too, its the heavenly food there which will keep pulling you back to the place. I was really tired of eating the same kind of thin crust pizza everywhere. And the pizza at Fabbrica Della is like a breath of fresh air - its so refreshingly new and delicious! Not just pizzas, everything else on the menu is worth tasting too. 
The fact that its centrally located (lane opposite Forum) is icing on the cake. Apart from that on the service front, you can place your order yourself by marking on the menu, which saves you the hassel of explaing everything verbally. 
Please make a visit soon to treat your taste buds to some serious Italian delicacies.

Reallly bad experience. Heard so much about the place but the food was a big disappointment. We ordered 3 dishes amongst 5 of us and that too was difficult to finish. We ordered: 
Focassia with dips - focassia was ok. Pesto was nice. Marinara was bad. They gave two cubes of bread which were so hard that couldnt be bitten. 
Aglio olio spagetti was semi cooked. The taste was nice. But the spagetti was very hard. 
Pizza- we made our own pizza. The only thing nice abt the pizza was feta cheese. Rest it was disastrous. 
A pizzeria not serving thin crust was a big shock. 

The staff is cordial n ambience is nice. Which make me give watever little rating that ive given

I finally managed to get a place here which seems packed all the time! But honestly waiting for a table here is worth it. 

We ordered for the pesto pasta (the portion was good for only two to share) and two of their signature pizzas. The Al diavolo and the fab fungo. Personally I loved the mushroom based fungi pizza but wasn't too happy about the other one since it simply tasted of spinach. 

Also tried their Burrata which was decent. Loved the pizza al Nutella, probably because I'm a Nutella fan! 

Overall nice experience, great ambience and nice music!

The pizzeria is beautifully decorated. The interiors are rustic and has a lot of European  essence to it. Checkered floors, blue gates, flower wales around and sufficient natural lighting. It's like being in Greece or Verona. 

I went here just to try out their Nutella Pizza. And this place absolutely lived up to my expectations. Nutella spread on a crispy crust with a soft centre, fresh strawberries and almond crumbs. This was the best Nutella based dessert I've ever eaten in the city. 

Definitely going back there to try their Pizzas and again binge on Nutella Pizza.

Vegetarians beware of going into this restaurant. The restaurant doesn't have a separate unit of veg and non veg . I got an opportunity to stand next to the chef making pizza and he left me in shock . They don't use any gloves . They dip there hand into vegetable and then they dip into the meat and the same process follows . When asked the owner he said we know and that's how we do it . Think before you go .. VEGETERIANS ..!!

There are places which make you fall in love with vibe, this is that. A decor which takes you back to medieval Europe and food that tastes heavenly, a combination worth trying. The service is quick and hasslefree. The lemon and peach iced tea had the usual dose of refreshing feel to it. The pesto pizza was one of its kind, laced with bacon and fresh mozarella. The condina was heavenly. They play great music to make you live up to the expectation of this dainty, two decker place. 
Do try.

The ambience of this place is like that of an eatery in a small Italian village. It has a very rustic appearance , with the painting of an Italian village on the walls. The lighting is sober and gives a special feel to it. Being a branch of Alla Bella , their food tastes similar. 
We ordered the pesto pizza and the condina. We also had calamari and iced tea. The peach and lemon iced tea were good and served in plastic cups. The calamari was tender inside and crunchy outside and was served with a dip where the flavour of capers dominated. It was creamy and had the right amount of seasoning. 
Coming to the pizzas , the pesto pizza was the first of its kind that I tried. It had roast chicken tossed in arrabiata sauce , bacon , jalape√±os and black olives , generously lying above a bed of pesto sauce and covered in  stretchy mozzarella. What I really liked about the pizza was its crust. It was fluffy and soft. And tasted very well. The Condina was also good , with a tomato sauce base and bacon , red onions and spinach. The red onions were juicy and the spinach had a great taste to it. 
Overall the place is lovely and the rates , decent.

Love love love it! It's like the love child between a thin crust and a pan pizza. The ingredients sit on an 11" thin crust circle with a thicker outer rim which you can enjoy with a dip. The dough is light where it ought to be light, and chewy but not dense on the rim. Make your own pizza or select from their fine menu. I had the Fab Fungo and the Pollo Piccante, both of which were delicious. Would definitely recommend it. Only reason I gave it 4.5 was because the bill took 15 mins to arrive (roughly the same time it took for the pizzas). Also a word of warning to the taller folk of Calcutta: watch your heads.

Dropped by this place for a late lunch after seeing the reviews on Zomato.
Very pretty place,great lighting and ambience.
Staff was friendly, helpful and warm.
We ordered a customised pizza with a pesto base,fiery chicken,bacon and caramelized onions toppings and mozzarella cheese. The pizza was fresh and tasty.
We had also ordered their Indanlia pizza which was also very good. 
For drinks we had the strawberry lemonade,which was not too sweet and seemed naturally flavoured. 
The bill was 1427 rupees with taxes.
Shall definitely recommend,and visit again.

The interiors of this place are beautiful and Inspired by the medieval Times. High ceilings, balconies, this place has it all. 
Coming to the food , we ate 3 kinds of pizzas , 
*Quattro for Maggio 
*Pollo caldo 
*fab fungo 
All the pizzas are cooked in wood fire and are very cheesy, the Fab Fungo is a must have ! 
We also ate the Veg Piadana( a wrap stuffs with spinach and mushroom) and Pomodoro Spagetti bowl.  Both these dishes were amazing. 
To top it all , we ate Budino ( A triple layered dessert) 

This place is FABulous but the only reason why I'm deducting 0.5 is because of poor service. They had all the supplies of the shakes but due to lack of proper service , we weren't served with our shakes.

Fabbrica della Pizza is the newest pizzeria in town. Located at the posh locality of elgin road/ allenby road one just cannot missout on the very attractive facade of this place. 

The 2 floor restaurant has the perfect italian decor to create the ambiance. The little balcony being my favourite spot here. Coming to the food we ordered for-
1)Margerita pizza
2)Fab fungo pizza
3)Veg piadina
4)Strawberry milkshake
5)Pizza al nutella

Keeping the fitness quotient on point we started with Rucola salad which is a lovely mix of rocket leaves , toasted almonds and balsmic honey served with focaccia bread. This is just the dish for the people who are calorie conscious and it scores well. Margerita was really nice with the bed of cheese in it. FAB FUNGO PIZZA just has the most apt name ever as it is just FAB. This mushroom topped pizza is sure to make you fall in love it. Simply wow. Veg piadina was equally good and had the right mix of veggies. The Strawberry milkshake was just off the hook due to its sheer consistency , taste and presentation. The cream topped on the jar really made it look upbeat and filling. Pizza al nuttela will just give you the foodgasm moment which one needs to conclude their meal.

Service was quick. Staffs are courteous. Will recommend this place to all pizza lovers. Overall a lovely experience.üëç

Well if you love pizza then this is your place to be.
Ambience is phenomenal and the decor is superb too. Service is quick. Servers are extremely friendly and polite. Coming to the food. 
Went for Quattro Formaggio, Pollo Caldo, Fab Fungo, Veg Piadina, Pomodoro Spaghetti Bowl and Budino.

‚Ä¢ Quattro Formaggio - It was really good and well made. It was melt in the mouth stuff to be honest.

‚Ä¢ Pollo Caldo - Another item which was really delightful both taste wise and quality wise.

‚Ä¢ Fab Fungo -  This was my favourite for sure. Simply amazing and soul satisfying indeed.

‚Ä¢  Veg Piadina - Another item which was brilliant.

‚Ä¢ Pomodoro Spaghetti Bowl - I'm not a big fan of spaghetti stuff but this was truly fantastic.

‚Ä¢ Budino - Yummy way to end a meal indeed.

Sadly there were no shakes or drinks available. Maybe next time I might get a chance to try them out.

Horrible, pathetic, don't know someone can go this wrong with pizza.
We ordered the salad, and it was just rocket leaves, we literally counted and there were 3 half pieces of cherry tomatoes, 3 pieces of black olives and only a couple of almonds pieces. Come on, at least make an effort. The pizza was rubbery, tasteless not even properly baked. And the drink. I couldn't have it because I had a cough, but my friends joked that it tasted like cough syrup so it may just work for me. So it was that bad. I am definitely not going back, and neither am I recommending it. Huge disappointment.

Dropped into Fabbrica Della Pizza todag with the aim of gorging on some authentic pizzas and returned home happy and trippy on all that delicious food. The pizza menu at Fabbrica is lavish and will spoil you for choices. Once over the initial overwhelming state, we were all set to order away and boy we did order a lot.  We ordered-
-The Margerita
-Fab Fungo
-Gamberetti
-Veg Piadina, and the
-Parmesan Crema.

With so much cheese to follow, we decided to start off with something relatively healthy and hence settled for the Rucolo salad. Once done with that we redied ourselves for the card overdose and enjoyed every bit of it.

The margerita and fab fungo are absolufe crowd pleasers. The former is generously basted with a fresh, tangy and slighly fleshy tomato sauce that I loved. The later on the other hand was heartily smeared with a muahroom-cheese sauce and topped with a much favoured selection of mushrooms. Not biting into these the next time you visit, is a crime you must not commit. 
We gulped all this down and more with the mega awesome Strawberry Shake and very refreshing Fab Limonate.

For desserts we settled for the nutella pizza, affaggato and the strawberry white chocolate. My chocolate and coffee addiction made me fall in love with the first two options. I will be dreaming about the nutella pizza today.

I am coming in again. Soon.

It has hardly been two weeks since Fabbrica Della Pizza has opened up and it's already pulling the crowd.
From the management of Alla Bella Mozzarella, this newly opened restaurant is located very close to Forum Mall on Allenby Road. 

Appearance-wise this place is sure to impress you. Amazing decor with sophisticated ambiance. Staffs are very swift and professional.

So we started with the super healthy Insalate di Rucola which is a salad of rocket leaves, cherry tomatoes, almonds.. all tossed in honey and served with focaccia bread.

We ordered two drinks : 
‚Ä¢ Fab Limonata which is an orange-based drink with a mild flavour of strawberry and basil. Very refreshing!
‚Ä¢ The Strawberries and Cream Milkshake absolutely won my heart! Too good to disappoint anyone. A must try!

Next, we ordered the following thin crust pizzas :
‚Ä¢ Margherita - Generous amount of cheese with mild flavour of basil leaves.. a great start to the pizzas!
‚Ä¢ Fab fungo - Cheesy, greasy.. full of mushrooms, this one can beat any non-veg pizza! Lip-smackingly good. Absolutely loved it!
‚Ä¢ Gamberetti - Comparatively less impressive than the rest of the two.

‚Ä¢ Veg Piadina which was again a mushroom wrap was impressive enough!
‚Ä¢ Parmesan Crema Spaghetti Bowl was creamy and delicious!
Desserts had :
‚Ä¢ Pizza Al Nutella - Heaven for Nutella lovers! But wait.. who doesn't love Nutella, anyway?
‚Ä¢ Affaggato - Very basic cold Vanilla Ice Cream served with a shot of hot Espresso. Nothing extraordinary but can set your mood right anytime of the day if you happen to love coffees!

Do give this new place a visit. You will absolutely love the pizzas and the milkshakes!
Best wishes to the management! :)



I loved the thin crust pizzas here.

A cute little pizzeria near forum with delicious thin crust pizzas. I went for the 'create your own pizza' option with pomodoro sauce, roast chicken and bacon. Although the order did take a little too much time, it was totally worth it. The pizza was cheesy and loaded with my chosen toppings. The tiramisu milkshake was nice as well. The decor makes one feel like being in Italy. And unlike most other places the person in charge of the music has done a good job.

First time I visited thsi place.  The interiors and the decorum of this place is very beautiful.  Its riight on the road side beside the country house cafe. The prices are a little high. I tried the margerita pizza and a coffee.  The pizza was made very fresh.  The crust itself was very delicious.  Make your own pizza also have a lot of choices.  Finally its a nice place to chill with family and friends as well as has the romantic aura of a date night!

A review after long , probably didn't visit new places in some time now , but this pizza joint I had to try being a pizza lover.  Located on Allenby road off elgin road the place is easily spotted from a distance . Plus the decor from outside makes you realize that you are at one of the European pizzeria . The long glass gates and windows along with a nice loft makes this place quite European in it's feel . I love the live kitchen as it assures me all the more about the method of preparation . They have nice way for taking orders , asking you to select your own sauce ,  cheese and toppings.  They also have standard menu but I loved getting them made to my choice.  They have home made crusts which are quite authentic , they are not crisp but are thin enough to be enjoyed hot and again they are cooked in the brickoven making it all the more great. Was lil surprised as they had very limited side dish options , but if you are hungry one pizza does good to you.  The staff was courteous and knew their job well . On the whole a good experience . I would say this place is reasonably priced . ( One hack for foodies , try places when they are newly open as they don't have their vat and service tax registrations in the initial days , so you save upto 20% of your bill ). I didn't try but have heard that the tiramisu shake is quite good.

1:Fab Funga Pizza
2:Veg Piadina
3:Spaghetti Bowls
4:Strawberry Milk Shake
5:Tiramishu Milk Shake
6:Peach Iced Tea

Small little place tucked in Alenby Road opp of Forum Mall. It's a ground plus a mezzanine.

There was a small waiting list when we arrived there for dinner.

Chitra, one of the owners happened to be taking down names of all those in the waiting. She held her smile even though I can understand her stress.

Soon we were given a table on the mezzanine. The place was full and the waiters were busy with orders including our.

The place reminded me of a few very very Italian eateries when I had visited Italy.

The aircon was working great so it was pleasant to be seated.

Parking was bit of a problem so one may have to park a little away.

Food was good. Our order was

Piazza .... pretty good
Fab Fungo .... excellent
One lime based cooler.... don't remember the name exactly but it was good.
Tiramisu shake .... excellent
Nutella pizza .... good or rather ok .... the base seemed a bit soft .... could have been more crispy

Service was a bit slow. I'll give them the benefit of being a new place.

The management is the same as Alla Bella Mozerella. The food at both places is very different though both are Italian.

All in all a good experience. Expecting the tething problems to get ironed out over the next few weeks.

I'll look forward to my next visit again. My daughter is going to visit again tomorrow but this time with her friends.

Gave it a 4 on 5 as service was a bit slow. May be next time it would be a 4.5 or even a 5.

Naman and gang .... all the best.

This one week old place is a must visit for all pizza lovers out there. The ambience is amazing. Theres a vintage door you'd love to be clicked with, we did that. The staircase that leads to the upper section with a Romeo-Juliet kinda balcony. I can keep on praising the ambience. It's that lovely. 

Coming to the orders, the shakes and iced tea we had were worth having 10 more of those. Strawberry and cream shake in particular along with Tiramisu shake.
Berry and peach iced tea were good too.

- Pork Pepperoni pizza was really nice.
- Indalian Pizza was a mutton based pizza which was good.
- Calamari fritto misto, loved that.
- Pollo Piadina was delicious. Wrap with genuine amount of chicken.
- Pesto spaghetti bowl, decent.

Also, the dessert we had was Budino. It was the best dessert I've had in a while. Could crave for it at any odd hour. Loved it. 
 There was nothing as such I could complain about. Was extremely happy visiting this place. Recommended to everyone for the same.

People come and go. But pizza is always bae! Everytime you think of some good pizzas in town, very few pizza joints come to your mind that serve the actual thin crust Italian pizza. Grace au Fabbrica Della Pizza! The outlet just next to Jhoomar showroom in Allenby Road is just seven days old. They have already shown how they are going to change the pizza scenario real soon.
Came here with a few friends of mine for a hi-tea. This is one of those QSR places which sports a pretty decor with essences of royal pink in bougainville and dusty shades of blue. The cute little blue door will definitely remind you of France Hodgson's Secret Garden. The checkered wall, the pebbled stairs does a very good justice in creating an ambience to dine at a roadside Italian pizzeria. Loved the use of natural light in the ground floor and also the paintings which make the place even more vibrant. The ambience surely carries a lot of weight and it is something over here which you have to be obsessed with.
Next what comes to my mind is their fabulous food. The service was courteous and efficient. The way how the management has put attention to every aspect at such a new property is really appreciable. We had a number of items, those of which are being discussed below -
Pizzas -
Indalian Pizza - A fusion of Indian minced mutton and Italian pizza. A thin crust bread, cheese and deeply cooked mutton is a killer combo here, trust me!
Pepperoni Pizza - Oh! What else can I say about this? The classic pizza featuring in every meme and emoticon has bowled us with a sixer strike. Must try over here.
Pollo Piadina - Italian wrap containing roasted chicken and rocket leaves. A good thing to try out as the wrap is not the usual thick dry one.
Pesto Spaghetti Bowl - The spaghetti bowl is a very filling meal over here that I think you shouldn't miss out. We added chicken with it. If you're alone, it's sufficient for a whole meal. The flavour of basil is really strong justifying its name and if you're a basil lover, you will fall in love with it.
Calamari Fritto Misto - Deep fried calamari came with a dip. Won't say anything because I always give biased reviews about this item as I am obsessed with it. Must try because the dip is awesome!
Dessert -
Budino - This was a completely new thing to me. I haven't ever tried this Italian dessert before. Came in a small cup with rolled tempered chocolate. Contained three layers of freshly whipped cream, caramel and chocolate mousse at the base. It was yummy in one word as I kept craving for more.
Drinks -
Fab Limonata - Strawberries, orange and basil Lemonade. A fab drink to refresh yourself on a sultry summer afternoon.
Strawberries and Cream - Ah hah! The best one from today's evening. Must have.
Tiramisu Shake - Well, this is a celebrity drink. Already got a newspaper feature for itself. A coffee lover's must have. Also, the subtle mascarpone cheese flavour makes it even more dramatic.
Peach Iced Tea and Berry Iced Tea - Honestly, I didn't like them much and won't recommend. I have deducted points for the exact same reason. If you're a tea lover, this maybe your 'cup of tea' but definitely not mine.
The overall experience was fantastic. I am definitely going to come back here again for the ambience and fab food - pizza, drinks, dessert, everything. Special mention must be made of their staff Marc, who is great at taking photos. Best wishes to the entire team! Hope they prosper and extend. Happy Dining! :)

There's a new synonym for Neapolitan pizza in town, and its none other than Fabbrica Della Pizza üòç
From the intricate arrangement of bougainvillea to delicious food, the impeccable ambience to the presentation, this is restaurant has the stamp of Naples, Italy all over it. 
This place is in the lane just opposite Forum mall, undoubtedly very easy to locate‚úî
The fact that you can create your own pizza by  choosing your own sauce, cheese, vegetables makes this place so unique.üíØ
I tried the following items:
MARINARA : The pizza was a perfect blend of Parmesan cheese and black olives.
FAB FUNGO: Must try for mushroom lovers.
VEGETABLE PIADINA: One of the best wraps I have ever eaten. 
SPAGHETTI BOWL: I tried PESTO with cherry tomatoes. 
BUDINO: A three layered dessert made up of vanilla, caramel and dark chocolate cream, served in shot glass was definitely the best dish.üòçüòç
TIRAMISU MILKSHAKE: The latest flavour to try.üëç
STRAWBERRIES AND CREAM MILKSHAKE: Must try.
ITALIAN ICED TEAS in Peach and Berry: Both the drinks were fantastic.
FAB LIMONATA: Very refreshing.üëè
The service was fast. The staffs are courteous and they make sure that you enjoy your meal ( Buon Appetito).
Highly recommended. 
My best wishes to the management.

Location : Near Forum Mall. Just beside Country House Cafe.

Decor/Ambience : I loved the ambience. The halogen lights, the wood fired oven, the long legged chairs gives this place a rustic feel.

Food & Beverages :

*Tiramisu shake : Awesome. The shake is thick and creamy with a customary biscotti on top.

*Hot chocolate : Delicious!!

*Pollo picante pizza : I loved it. The pizza was very delicious. 

*bacon pizza : I love porky pizzas and this one sure didn't disappoint.

*Spaghetti with bacon : Again, delicious combination.

*Nutella pizza : The Nutella is spread generously on the pizza. Nutella, strawberry slices and dusting of icing sugar : what can go wrong? This was yummy.

Service : staff is quick and attentive.

Fabrica della bags a recommendation from the big fat foodie!

Absolutely disappointing food, strange because I quite like alla Bella. I was super famished when I got there and the food was below average.
Only thing worth trying - fab fungo.
The service was quick thou. 
The spaghetti had no salt.
The iced tea was also not made upto mark.

I'm a big fan of Alle Bella Mozzarella... So without any delay dropped by this place as soon as got the news of it... The interior is top notch... So beautifully done... You can get the fill from outside also... The long glass panels will help you out... They have a mezzanine sitting area which is more attractive... I basically like the decoration of the ceiling... Seating was comfortable too... Now coming to the main aspect of the place... Yes the food... What can I say... It was dam good...

#Drinks & beverages#
üíù Tiramissu shake~ It was insane... #Recommend

‚óÜ Vanilla shake~ Very very tasty...

üíù Hot chocolate~ Another awesome drink... It was so so yummy...

‚óÜ Ice tea~ Good one...

‚óÜ FAB limonate~ Very refreshing... It's tangy twist will chill your mind...

#Food#
üíù Calamari~ Very tasty... 

üíù Pollo piccante~ Just mind blowing... So fresh n yummy... 

üíù Contadina~ So so good... The smell increased our hunger twice... And we gulped it like hungry monsters...

üíù Aglio olio~ Extremely well made... With added becon in it makes super delicious...

üíù Veg piadina~ One of the yummiest veg preparation I ever had... Just mind blowing...

#Desserts#
üíù Pizza al nutella~ A beautiful dessert to end with... Perfect balance of sweetness in it...

P.S. The freshness of the ingredients is need to be mentioned here... The acceptance of the dishes become very high when the ingredients are of top notch... And they need to maintain it...

Service was extremely fast... Also the staffs are courteous... A little bit of training will help them to do more better...

Overall I can say... It is an awesome place for hangout with friends n family... Highly recommend to all...

The management of Alla Bella Mozarella presents Fabbrica Della - A beautiful Italian joint in the posh area of Elgin, very close to Forum mall.¬†
This place will give you the feel of a classic Italian tavern. There all 2 levels and the upper level is good for group hangouts.
I will mention the must order items -¬†

1. Tiramisu Milk Shake - A Coffee flavored Italian milk shake. Tastes delicious and quite refreshing.¬†

2. Piazza - Though this is a vegetarian option but I bet the Non Vegetarians would love this pizza too. An absolute cheesy affair with sun dried tomatoes, roasted garlic and pesto toppings!

3. Pollo Piccante - This pizza with roasted chicken, mozzarella, pesto, jalapenos, caramelized onions and feta will literally melt in your mouth. Another delicious preparation!

4. Aglio olio e peperoncino - Basically a bowl of spaghetti which you can customize with your choice of topping. We had a vegetarian one with mushroom and it tasted pretty good.

5. Veg Piadina - It looks like a wrap with adequate fillings and tastes great. Quite filling too.

6. Hot Dark Cioccolato - Please do not miss this one! This might be slightly overpriced but I am sure you will not regret ordering this amazing, super awesome comfort drink! Warm, thick creamy and an absolute delight in every sip.

7. Pizza Al Nutella - Pizza with Nutella spread, topped with marinated strawberries and roasted almonds. What else do you need!

Price - Little on the higher side.

Service - Good.

Recommended!

Fabbrica Della Pizza is a newly opened pizza house at Elgin Road, the lane opposite to Forum Mall. I came across this restaurant a few days ago and decided to visit it then and there. I went to have dinner with my friends and therefore I would like to share my experience. 
This pizza place looks amazing from outside and it will leave you awestruck once you enter. This restaurant serves a wide range of Italian pizza and hence they have decorated the place according to Italian interests. The place is beautifully lit with Ianterns, grape vines, paintings hung on the walls, the woody walls giving it the look of an authentic Italian restaurant. 
The menu is designed is a very innovative manner and suggests that creative minds have worked really hard to come up with such unusual pizza and other food inclusions which also includes our favourite shakes as well. We ordered Tiramisu Milkshake which had a perfect blend of cream and milk and was very filling. We also ordered Vanilla Shake which tasted amazing with the vanilla flavour being dominant with whipped cream on top. Even the Hot Chocolate we ordered was not like any other ordinary hot chocolate that we usually have. 
For the main course we ordered Non-veg Aglio Olio which had bacon and cheese in a perfect combination. We also ordered Calamari, Pollo Picante and Contadina which took us directly to the kitchens of Italy and will definitely urge you to come back and have them again. 
We had Nutella pizza for dessert with strawberry toppings. The pizza has a thin crust and the creamy nutella on it will melt in your mouth giving it a heavenly feeling. 
I am glad that I am one of the first ones to visit this Italian pizza house which is surely going to make its mark very soon. The service is commendable and the staff is very polite and helpful. The prices are also reasonable and won't keep you in doubt before visiting this restaurant. The food is delicious and will compel you to visit again and again till you try all the items. The ambience gets full marks and the positive vibes it generates will make it grow bigger soon enough. Highly recommended from my side

This is a gem of a place that has opened up near Forum Mall (in the opposite lane). It has to be the best Italian cuisine restaurant in the area, if not in the city. I love visiting new places, so Fabbrica Della Pizza was already on my wishlist even before it opened. So decided to visit along with some friends for dinner.
Out and out the vibes are positive. Even from the fa√ßade, the place has a posh look with clear exteriors. The greatness continues inside as well with a pleasantly lit environment accompanied by authentic Italian style d√©cor. Wall paintings, grape vines, night lamps add to the ambience and feel.

The items on their menu are quite a rarity in the city and can‚Äôt be found in other restaurants. For the drinks we ordered Tiramisu Shake ‚Äì the flavours of a classic tiramisu transfused into a shake. Vanilla Bean Shake ‚Äì had a milky flavour with whipped cream on top. Both the shakes were wonderful.

We had Sundried Tomato Pizza ‚Äì it was remarkable. The quality and true flavour of feta cheese along with juicy sundried tomatoes really did the job. Bruttini is the olive oil flat bread and homemade focaccia, glazed with garlic, served with marinara and pesto. Both the dips were just amazing with distinct flavour.
Veg Piadina were amazing flat breads wrapped in sundried tomatoes, mushrooms and spinach. They were very flavourful and quite filling. For the dessert we had the Pizza Al Nutella ‚Äì which is undoubtedly the best dessert pizza in town. The pizza bread is covered with nutella and topped with chopped strawberries and roasted almonds. The entire combination is just mind blowing. Definitely recommended.

The service is a delight too. The staff was swift and steady while attending tables, which is the kind of service that is expected out of such a place. An incredible experience and no negative points in any area.
