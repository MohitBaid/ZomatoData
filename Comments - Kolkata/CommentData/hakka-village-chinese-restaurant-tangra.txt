One of the cheapest restaurants of china town. A plate of starters consists of 20 pieces of the thing you order so it is definitely a place where you should go in groups. But 1 thing I did not like about the place, rather it was a problem regarding all the restaurants if china town. All of them r sexists. They won't allow you to enter family zone unless you have any girl with you. So according to them father and son is not a family, nephew uncle is not a family, brothers r not a family but if you have a girl with you that's the best definition of family according to them. I wonder how they make such rules in such a progressive world

First there was expensive china town restaurants like Beijing, Big boss and Golden joy and then there was cheap yet mind-boggling places like Hot oak village, china pearl etc. And to add to this list, I happened to drop in at "Hakka Village". 
The place is very easy to locate, if you are coming from bypass, just take the turn from Poroma island and walk/drive towards park circus. You would get to see a nice Chinese decorated temple design gate on the other side of the road - cross the road and get inside that gate - walk for 2 mins and you are there.
Pros: 
1. Location
2. Smoking allowed inside
3. Very cheap
4. Card payment allowed (which has become a must to have factor in recent times)
5. No VAT/S.T

Cons:
1. Very mediocre interior
2. Moderate clean
3. No cigerette shop nearby, either u have to carry on ur own else have to pay 20 rupees extra for a packet
4. Waitors are not that pro

Crispy chicken and crispy chilli babycorn were all we ordered around 5-6 plates. Quantity was huge. So overall, for a one time visit with friends - definitely recommended.

A mediocre place to eat and drink. Not really a well furnished or well decorated or hyped place yet you will somehow like it if you want to spend some quality time with special someone over drinks and looking for a quiet and inexpensive place.

Mediocre restaurant but yeah, most of the place in chaina town tastes almost the same. 
But if u are willing to have a giant booze party in chains town in cheap, keep this place in mind. Pocket friendly. We enjoyed like hell.

One of those places in Tangra where you can enjoy the tasty chinese food and Alcohol while keeping your wallet healthy. The ambience is a lot shady but i didn't expect anything better considering the prices. Normal tables are laid and the service persons offer you whatever you need. Air Conditioner in place. Perfect for students and bachelors. 

Do try their Chicken Drumstick. A full portion of it contains 20 pieces and it tastes awesome. I even liked their Gravy Noodles. Do avoid the Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken which is one of the specialty of Tangra but sadly this is not the place for having it.

Quite a nice place to booze but ambience is a so-so one with limited service availability as they are always short of staff! Food is quite good,  try Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken and hot garlice chicken. 
Most importantly, its near milan mela as well as science city, you have to walk a little if don't have any kind of transit.
