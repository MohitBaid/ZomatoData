My go-to sweet shop since I was a kid. Located in my neighbourhood, this place gives serious competition to the other sweet shops nearby. Love their shingara and Nalen Gur er Barfi.

One of the Kolkata's best sweet shop located at Behala. Quality and taste is still the same as it used to be when I was a kid. They still maintained it. My favorite is Misti Doi and Lebu Sandesh.

A good and popular mishti shop in Behala, on Brahma Samaj Road. We had sweets from there on Ashtami day when we visited the Sonar Durga of Mukherjee Bari, a little further down the road.They had a good variety of sweets, we had variety so sandesh and all were happy, as they were soft and fresh. The taste was good with correct sweetness, not overly sweet. 
It seems to be a popular shop with the locals as it was quite crowded.

The best quality sweet shop you can get in Behala. Infact this is one of the best in Kolkata. You get real good quality sandesh. The Mishti doi here is to die for. Also you get singara and khasta kochuri. You need to try a norom paker sondesh with pista on top to get the real taste of the shop. Staffs are very cordial.

Gulabjamun stuffed with Pistachio. It's soft and tasty. 
Misti Doi (sweetened yogurt) : Tasty and recommended.
Dryfruit laddu: It has cashew, makhana, dates and it is really good.

If you're in Calcutta or anywhere else in Bengal, you're never too far from a sweet shop! Panna is a quite a household name in the Behala area and even beyond. They have their oil mill, a family restaurant, a fast food restaurant and the sweet shop - all within a 200 meter radius. 

They have a very wide variety of sweets for all occasions. But I'd recommend their "mishti doi",  "mihidana" (seasonal), shwor bhaja and rabri amongst other things. 

Don't let the grumpy attitude of the staff turn you off; just focus your attention on the sweets while you're there. During festivals and peak demand, the staff can get really unpleasant which is a sore for such a big brand! 

Also they're located on one of the busiest roads in all of Behala; so look around before your step out.

As a resident of Behala I have always been proud of this shop as I loved their sweets. They have no other branch and hence I felt people living in other areas are getting deprived of the best sweets of Kolkata. I used to love their sweets so much; I still do,just that my misconception of them being the best in business have faded away after trying a few sweet shops which are famous all over Kolkata.

Hence,I would like to start my review by designating this shop as definitely one within the top 3 sweet shops in Behala. The location is pretty simple,enter the road by the Panna oil mill which leads to Rabindra Nagar and take a few steps and you will find this shop.

I have tried all their sweets as I am a sweet tooth and my place being located very near this shop. Previously,it used to be the best in Behala until recently Kamdhenu and Ganguram have opened their outlets in close proximity to this shop. This has actually challenged the monopoly that was being enjoyed by Panna sweets. To maintain the competition even they have started making fancy sweets like chocolate mishti and a few others which used to be missing previously. Honestly,they are doing quite well in keeping up with the big names of Kamdhenu and Ganguram.

My personal favourites are their rasgolla,chocolate mishti,baked chom-chom,swar-bhaja,jalebi and amriti. I visit this shop as and when i cross it and I recommend you to try this place if you are around. You won't be disappointed.

Panna Sweets has its own craze in Behala. Everyone knows the taste and quality of the sweets. Located a few steps from D.H.Road and beside Panna Oil Mills. The sweets here are of great quality and they never fail with the taste as well. The sweets are fresh and always tickle your taste buds. The staffs here are friendly and are fast. The place is small and always crowded. The mishti doi and Rabri are my favourite. This place has been a regular place for me. Even the rasogolla here is fantastic.
If you are in Behala you cant miss this place for sure. The best has its own reputation and class.

4/5 for my love for sweets

Look who's finally on Zomato ! :)

It's very wrong of me to write about Panna Sweets because I swear every bit of this review is biased. This sweet shop has been such a sweet, constant part of my life since times immemorial, I can't possibly write anything bad about it. But then Good old Panna Sweets is in Zomato, how can I not write a review? :')
I remember as a kid when father would bring sweets from Panna for the guests and I'd wait like a hungry vulture willing with all my mental power for the guests to not touch any of those sweets so that I can gobble them up later. XD
Anyway, the bond between me and Panna has only strengthened over time. 
I never not leave Kolkata without a box of goodies from Panna and have never went straight home without stopping in here after a long time away from Kolkata.

Their Gulab Jamun, Rosogolla, Khirer chop, Gawja, even the Laddu and... (it's not a good idea to ask me to list all) is worth dying for. The Gajorer Halua and Mihidana gets double likes :') 

This place is of sweets and even sweeter memories. :)

It gives me immense joy to see 'Panna Sweets'  in Zomato finally. I have been suggesting it for a long time. Finally it is here.  This store has been a part of my life even before I was born. My mother occasionally tells me of the 'gorom rosogolla' that my father used to get for her from here when she was pregnant with me.... I have always been a frequent visitor of this shop.Panna Sweets is jusr beside the Panna Oil Mill in the Brahmo Samaj Road in Behala. From their gujia to rosogolla, and from their singaras to khasta kochuri, I love their every item, be it sweet or savoury. I love their singaras. The vegetables of the stuffing changes with each season. In the winter, you will get cauliflower in the stuffing as well as nuts, dried grapes etc. It tastes like heaven. I love thier gajar ka halwa. It is delicious. They sell a cornflakes  halwa which is delicious. I have had cornflakes halwa  elsewhere in Kolkata, but nobody can get the taste and consistency right. Thr behavior of the staff is amiable. I will visit this store again and again.

Dear Friends, please please please please try Panna Sweets Boondi. It's heaven ! But keep in mind it is available only from 6 p.m. in the evening & vanishes within few hours. It is succulent & worth the money ...... Give it a taste !
