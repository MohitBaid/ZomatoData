Ordered packets of chicken biryani with extra boiled  eggs , the biryani was aromatic and tasted really nice , though a bit oily . But for just 75 rupees , they get give sufficient quantity of rice , with a chicken piece, potato and egg ,its sumptuous and value for money.

Really tasty biryani.... And the chicken chap is awesome.. should try it... Affordable . Good food without making hole in pocket. I would suggest to take the briyani away at home and enjoy as the shop is very small and the dinning part is not well arrang. Apart from this the taste is really awesome.

Very good biriyani, sometimes I fell very less difference between aminia and mesban' biriyani.
The quantity is also good so one can try this if you want to taste good biriyani at low price.

Oily biriyani. Oily chicken chaap. Oily everything. The biriyani here is average at best. I'd recommend it on the days when you're really hungry , low on cash and dont want to dine in. Take away is the best option here as the place is a shabby run down little room. 3/5 only because I didn't get food poisoning XD
