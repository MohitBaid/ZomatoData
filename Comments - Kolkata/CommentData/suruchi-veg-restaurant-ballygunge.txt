We reached here casually but awesome experience, superb taste of pavbhaji and vada paw with accompaniments and delicious fruit custard.
 Such a mouthwatering unlimited dishes at resonable price.
A must visit for all who love quality veg food at reasonable price. Weekend prices are little higher but Ok.
My best compliments to the chef and welcoming staff especially Mr Ali.

This is khichdi what i have been told, let me tell you its cold, rice mixed with daal nothing else, and for that you pay 157 bucks. If you dine over there, they serve you well. But if you order online, they will definitely cheat you....thats suruchi for me

I absolutely loved my visit to Suruchi.The place is 2mins walk from the Quest Mall near Park Circus. The restaurant is on the first floor of shubh food court complex.At the entrance their is an vintage car and the entrance wooden gate and the decor with rajasthani paintings and dolls seemed very appealing.All the waiter's wear a turban like traditional marwari men and are very courteous and attentive. The moment we entered the restaurant we were welcomed with chanch. Though there is an option of gujrati, rajasthani and Punjabi unlimited thali during lunch hours we opted for the rajasthani thali as we had heard about it. I liked most of the dishes that was served.I would like the specially mention the gatte ki sabji and makai ki roti with was soo good.I even liked the daal bati churma that was served.There was also dhokla..papad...chatni..and many more sabji.For dessert there was custard and halwa both of them were not too sweet and I loved it. I couldn't finish everything. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who looking for a great vegetarian restaurant.
P.S.- The price of each thali has changed now and the menu card uploaded on zomato has not been updated.On a weekday two Rajasthani thali cost us around Rs700 inclusive of GST.

One of the best places to have vegetarian thali in Kolkata..there are mainly three varieties here which includes the Gujarati thali,Punjabi thali and the Rajasthani thali..all of them are good but the punjabi thali stands out among them..the dessert includes fruit custard and sewai both of which tasted heavenly..a must visit for vegetarian thali lovers in Kolkata..and the staff are really good, polite and very happy to feed you..:)

The service is not up to the mark. But, the food quality is very good. Total value for money. We can compare this with Khandani Rajdhani restaurant, and so many dishes are even better here. The prices here are bit low than Rajdhani. I would say this place is quite underrated. For vegetarians, it's must visit!

Apart from the speed of service and cleanliness,  which are basic essentials,  the taste of desi pure ghee would melt your taste buds. The Rajasthani Thali and all accompaniments were delicious. The crowning touch is the dessert where the Malpoha served with fresh cream truly gives a delightful experience.

One of the best places to have Thali in the city. With a variety of three cuisine thali's namely Rajasthani, Gujarati and Punjabi. They also serve couple of combo's, Vada Pav and Pav Bhaji combo's. To my utter disappointment they didn't have Gujarati thali the day i went. Never mind i chose Punjabi thali, while my other family members went for Rajasthani one. They have 3-4 types of sides which comes along phulka, paratha, naan and puran puri. They also serve a variety of accompaniments which go pretty well with the food. For desserts they had fruit custard which was average and Malpua with rabri, i felt that the malpua lacked mewa else it tasted great.
All in all it's a nice place to have thali's and also at a comparatively lesser cost than other joints of similar type.

When a hard core non-veg person opts for veg, there has to be a reason. And the reason is explicitly explained.

A royal ambience with great interiors and lighting conditions. Staffs were right on time and courteous. As far as the service is concerned it was amicable. The dining time is from 12-4 and from 7-11 at night. Even though we reached a bit late they allowed us to have our time and waited till we finished. That was appreciable.

Coming to food , mostly three varieties punjabi, rajasthani and gujrati food buffets were there. We opted for punjabi and rajasthani thali though there was an option of three in one thali. The food was in no way average. Every bite was smooth and mellowed within the mouth. Food was well cooked amd the taste remained the same even after i visited the place years after. With tastes like this , people like me who loves to have non-veg can leave aside and have fun. A must visit for all veg lovers and different culture foods.

Located just a few minutes ahead of Quest mall if you're coming from Park Circus area this place is a must try if you're a Veg Thali lover. They have a variety of thalis from Punjabi to Rajasthani to Gujarati and yes,not to forget a special Thalia that can give you a flavour of all the above mentioned thalis. Also, it follows a non sharing policy. Each one buy one type. There's a Thalia for adults and children too.The one for kids is at a lower price which was a good thought.Coming to the taste..I liked it a lot, service is good too, ambience is fairly decent,dimly lit also the Rajasthani feel with the puppets. Overall, a great place for veg foodies , non vegetarians should try it too.

I've been to Suruchi Veg Restaurant before but this is my second time visiting this restaurant, therefore my first review of this restaurant. Situated in Ballygunge, its nearest landmark is the Bata shoes showroom. Be warned that before visiting, this is a strictly vegetarian restaurant so those who never had thali before or is too fond of non-vegetarian food so keep an open mind.

Despite me being a complete non-vegetarian food, i have always loved the thali concept. Today we had three plates of Rajasthani thali. Besides that, they also serve Gujarati thali, Punjabi Thali, Paw Bhaji thali. Everything over here has unlimited filling, even including the desserts. I suggest taking a look at the prices of thali as they have different rates on weekend and weekdays.

The interior designing of the restaurant is neat and tidy, perfect lighting and the servers are really nice and polite. They play soft music, enough for people to communicate. The food is really delicious, unfortunately i am unable to recall the names of the side dishes. They serve plain rice, khichdi, roti, naan, puri and laccha. They also serve chaas as drinks. Besides that, they serve fruit custard, malpua, dahi vada, and different sauces. Overall it is really filling and absolutely delicious. I only wish the servers talk a bit loudly and talk slowly so i can listen to each names of the dishes. 

I recommend my non-vegetarian friends to try this place out at least once. You definitely wont be disappointed.

I ordered a north indian meal for home delivery. Taste was good, no doubt. But the quantity of vegetables, dal and paneer was very little, about 2 tablespoons hardly. peas pulao and butter naan was more than sufficient. but what to eat, the rice and naan with? the meal was sent in a plastic thali tray and the space for the curries was also very small. Overall, could not rate it very good due to the quantity of dal, vegetable and paneer

The aloo dum was great as well and so was methi malayi. The papdi chat was ok but they served super soft dhoklas which was great. Aam Ras was good but gulab jamuns were soft and juicy. Go on a weekend when even the sweets are unlimited. It's a huge place which was somehow empty on Saturday afternoon.

Went to Suruchi today. This was my second time since it opened doors. Enjoyed thoroughly the first time. Being a restaurant chain, heard loads about it from my husband when he used gorge upon the food there in Delhi. Went again today. Must say, HIGHLY disappointed. We were the one two people there. We ordered for Rajasthani thali. Too much masala, spicy, surely had food colour. Service was okay, definitely super fast. The aamras seemed to be made much earlier in the day. Buttermilk was the highlight. I had four glasses of it!! The cooked vegetables were oily. They didn't have bajra roti, which was originally a part of the menu of thali. Basically, am not going back there for sure!! Had a bad experience. 

Then came the billing part. They thrusted the cheque at us. No problem. Upon asking if they accept any cards for discount, they said yes. 15% off for Axis card holders. Voila! My husband promptly handed it over to the manager. He said sorry the bill is processed and the discount can't be offered. We said you should have asked us before getting the bill atleast. He went and returned with another guy. That other guy told me it's written on the net. I said the least you couldn't do it have a notice somewhere around your restaurant. You expect people to see your website before coming for a meal?? Anyways after much of the silly, headless argument we paid and left!! 

So that's a goodbye from us to #Suruchi #Suruchikolkata #suruchiballygune

This is a great place for veg thalis from north-west Indian states. The punjabi thali is quite good, but the gujrati thali has less variety. They also serve a very popular salted yoghurt drink ('chaanch') to cool you down. Their desserts were disappointing considering the fact that this restaurant is owned by the famous Gupta brothers chain of sweet shops in Kolkata.

tried the rajasthani thali which was full of variety that we couldnt even finiah at the end
but the flavours were spot on and would definetely be coming again

unlimited food which is not a self service buffet is pretty cool and gives you the royal feel
whats even better is that they serve traditional rajasthani and gujarati food which you will not find anywhere in the city.

Ordered vegetarian thali for home delivery. The delivery was quick but the food left much to be desired. The aloo Sabzi was stale and not edible. The paneer Sabzi was very sweet. Peas pulao, dal and gulabjamun was decent. They can avoid adding so much sugar to all gravies and must ensure that stale food does not reach the customer. Also, there should be an option of whole wheat rotis for those of us who do not like naan.

Awesome place, the thali's are one the best i ever had. Ambience is also great according to the price.
It's really pocket friendly.
Frankly speaking if this restaurant was inside quest mall, with the same ambience and same everything, they could have charged double or even more for the thalis they give.
Had a punjabi thali and a paw bhaji thali. Best paw bhaji in kolkata according to me. They even give "chas" as complementary and refill it timely like water.
Awesome.

Went there yesterday as it was in my bookmark list since long.we ordered 2 thalis,one rajasthani and one punjabi. I found the food quality was good(well cooked and hot) but as I always search for new places to have food that tastes yumm_  that particular word I was missing in the food. Taste can be improved   with proper balancing of ingredients and spices. But a good restaurant with good ambience.definitely could be given a second try...... :)

Would have been my last dinner tonight!

Was having Gujarati thali at Suruchi Veg Restaurant near Quest mall. All of a sudden, I sense something hard and sharp on my tongue - to my surprise, it wasn't any stone or any particle, but a METAL PIECE OF A UTENSIL SCRUBBER - of the length of almost 2 cm. sharp, hard metal.

The waiters first of all just took away the dish, and then came after a long time to apologise. On requesting a dialogue with the manager, they got someone else - who looked like the housekeeping staff. I insisted on meeting the manager, when someone in authority came in to meet. When I narrated the whole incident, he apologised and offered for a replacement dish.

It was not a question of that particular meal. The evening had been already spoilt. God knows what would have happened had i swallowed the piece of metal. I asked him what about the other customers who probably might be unaware of what they are swallowing and left the place.

Please, please be careful while you eat out! - no matter how posh the restaurant may appear!

You get 3 types of thaalis - Gujarati Punjabi Rajasthani. You will like all 3. The staff is very humble n sweet so just go and have a good experience üòÄ.

Awesome thalis, the sheer spread of dishes is amazing. They have punjabi, rajasthani, gujrati thalis, all of which are really good. Very attentive staff. Better than rajdhani. Ambience is also nice and it is generally not very crowded. Have been there many times. Highly recommended.

A must go place, not only for their foods but also for their hospitality. The quality of the food is just awesome and please manage a quality portion of space in your stomach before geting in, otherwise it would have been impossible to satisfy your apetite with the mouthwatering cuisines, which would make your tastebuds sad enough for not letting them continue their want...

This is a must go place! Spectacular Thalis and at a really good price.

So finally I've found a good thali restaurant in Kolkata, and i would say this is much better than Rajdhani as well for a couple of reasons...

It's not as jam-packed as Rajdhani usually is(maybe over time this too shall be!). And for me this improved the service and experience manifold times! There is no real rush from their side to get you moving which enables you to have your meal at your leisure. Also, the staff is very attentive...and they get you the dish you ask for in no time - unlike Rajdhani where sometimes you never get what u asked for because there was so much else to serve. The spread may be slightly slower than Rajdhani, but with a large spread you hardly eat everything anyway.

Next, they offer all three - Punjabi, Rajasthani and Gujarati Thalis. That is a killer concept as different cuisines appeal to different taste buds in a group and no one has to compromise. On top of that they have Pav Bhaji and Vada pav as well! I must try these out soon!

And now coming to food. I myself had Punjabi Thali and my friends had Rajasthani thali...and I can hands down vouch for both of them. We had khanan chura and aloo bhajiya for starters...loved the lehsun ki chutney especially. There were 5 subsidy - malai corn, aloo masala, dal makhni, paneer butter masala and punjabi chhole. Rajasthani thali had daal baati choorma, methi ki sabzi, gatte ki sabzi, aloo, etc. In breads there was a choice of bajre ki roti, fulka roti, tandoori naan and lachcha paratha. Papad and salad accompanied the Thali. In desserts there was boondi laddoo and fruit custard. Masala buttermilk served with the Thali was satiating throughout.

I highly recommend this place for a good Thali!

The mesmerizing decor and its soothing ambiance are the key features of Suruchi. Bright lights, spacious and beautifully decorated indoors, quilted seats. 
Situated in the lane just opposite to Quest Mall.
I would say, do skip at-least two meals if you want to complete a single thali over here with all the dishes !
The quality and taste of food is great. Authentic !
The staff was so homely and warm, they served with utmost love and care.
For a hard core non-vegetarian like me it's rather strange to write such beautiful things about a vegetarian restaurant, but then this place is just worth it.
Happy and Contented !

Normally I do not go to any veg restaurant. My parents don't prefer non-veg outside. So me , my wife and my parents checked in. I am glad I choose suruchi for that.
The location is just opposite to quest mall (tarak datta Lane to be precise).
The d√©cor is superb. We took 4 Rajasthan thali out of which two was Jain style (no onion garlic). All the items were absolutely delicious with unlimited serving.
End of the meal, I was bloated like hell. Must go place for those who want to try veg. The rate is also very economical.

we had ordered JAIN food for the THALI ¬†but to shocker this hotel is having given a food which contained onion and garlic food. Even i specific 4 time while while guys where serving the foodthe resturant also have not refunded the money for such nusiance act of serving NON JAIN food.¬†

we specifically mention JAIN food but resturant is now very soory for the act.¬†

In India where there people are so much religious are being served food without the act of the maintaining religion.¬†

beware ordering from such resturant.....

Just been there for the second time after a long time and it was definitely worth it. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone this place is a heaven for vegetarians, we tried Punjabi and rajasthani thali and pav bhaji as well, everything was delicious especially the pav bhaji which was out of this world.

I would definitely recommend Punjabi thali as it has some real good flavours corn malai and paneer butter masala were lip smacking daal tadka and aloo bhaja were average but they change the menu Everytime so you never know . As starters they give dhokla for Punjabi thali and daal baati churma for rajasthani thali along with Chach which by the way is really refreshing and compliment the pallet nicely. In dessert we got fruit custard and moong daal halwa which were decent but not as good as maalpua which we got the previous time but given the fact that they were unlimited on weekends it was fine. If in a group one can order different thalis and taste different flavours which we DEFINITELY did and it's wonderful to try so many different flavours.

Staffs are dressed in traditional rajasthani costumes with pagdi and are extremely well behaved.

The place although have some cons as well like in dessert we got fruit custard which was not cold and moong daal halwa which was not hot and in both the thalis there were some bad dishes like daal tadka and aloo bhaja in Punjabi thali and Kadhi in rajasthani thali.

But overall I would definitely recommend this place to everyone.

After hunting down non-veg restaurants for a long time, we visited Suruchi Veg Restaurant for a change.

The ambience is eye catching. The servers wear Rajasthani turbans on their head, which goes nicely with their rajasthani decor.

We chose unlimited Rajasthani and Punjabi thalis. First they welcome you with Chaas. Then they place their empty thali and bowls in front of you and start filling them. Dish after dish fills up your thali, which is a treat to watch.

The Rajasthani thali consisted of Dal Bati Churma, Kachori, Aloo Sabzi, Gatte ki Sabzi, Baingan Bharta, Bean Sabzi, Dal, Rasam, Bajre ki Roti with Gur, normal Roti and Papad.

While the Punjabi thali consisted of Aloo Matar, Chole, Dal Makhni, Paneer Butter Masala, Malai Corn, Naan and Laccha Paratha.

Dal Bati Churma had nice texture and perfect balance of sweet and spiciness. Malai corn, basically golden corn in sweet milky gravy, was delicious. Naan and laccha paratha was soft and fluffy and went well with their side dishes. Baingan Bharta and Chole were good as well. However, the menu may vary.

We rounded up with the complimentary Fruit Custard and Suji ka Halwa.

The beauty is, once you buy thali for each person, you can taste all the dishes and that too in unlimited quantities.

Overall...
Food 4/5
Ambience 5/5
Service 5/5
Value for money 5/5
Our pleasure became manifold higher for their polite and attentive service.

Was walking back from Quest to Gariahat and had plan to have lunch somwhere on the way. When alone usually ¬†i prefer my food with hot cup of coffee to give great company but this time as I was passing from this place thought of dropping here .
This is a part of gupta brothers and I have visited gupta brothers in salt lake and some what did not like there service that much so I entered this place with not that great expectation with respect to service but when I entered here through there sweets section I was amazed ¬†with there service. Person at the ground floor helped me well in understanding where I can seat and have food of my choice.¬†
I entered there first floor and ordered for rajasthani thali. Initially they gave buttermilk which tasted good with great consistency and the it was chilled as per the expectation.Apart from this they had dal bati churma,rice ,roti,puran poli,gatte ki sabji ,dal , kadhi ,mix veg,alu tamatar and in desert suji ka halwa and fruit custard. Each and everything was nicely prepared ,I would say in a home cooked way and served in a great way. I would say this was my best experience ever ¬†with ¬†a great rajasthani thali meal .

Well there is a ton of Marwaari and Jain folk in the city who are always on lookouts for places that serve the traditional Rajasthani and Gujurati cuisine, without compromise in quality or quantity. There are only a handful of restaurants that provide for an unlimited veg thali option and Suruchi is one of the greats. I would like to thank Shahbaaz Zaman for recommending this vegetarian fine diner as the experience was one of unique.

As stated above, Suruchi is a pure vegetarian fine dine restaurant setup under the Gupta Bros. flagship. It is located on Tarak Dutta Road, the lane adjacent to Bata store, opposite to Quest Mall. The restaurant is on the 1st floor of the Gupta Bros. building. 

The entrance to the outlet is through a big wooden door with tinted glasses around it, setting in a traditional feel. The interiors and d√©cor revolve around the fusion of rural Rajasthani artworks and furnishing with a modern finesse. The outlet remains crystal clear standards of neatness maintained to their utmost. The walls are covered with smooth blue wallpapers with custom peacock print design. They have also been adorned with props like handmade classic puppets and traditionally designed lamps. The seating arrangements are aptly suited for large groups, mainly aimed at family diners. The long couches are really comfortable too.
The servers were dressed in the attires similar to those of the royal servants of maharajas. The quality and timing of their service is also worth a mention which makes this place a complete fine dine experience.

Let‚Äôs move on to the food audit. For the traditional meal, the menu has the following options of thalis ‚Äì Rajasthani, Gujurati and Punjabi. All these options are conveniently priced at the range of ‚Çπ250-350. And the fact that all these are unlimited is just like cherry atop a cake.

Sandeep and Rajkumar, were our servers for the evening. They are absolutely praise-worthy for their commendable efforts and service. I have been to many fine dine restaurants and the level of service here was no lesser in standard. The place is a boon for vegans looking to get affordable buffets and what can be better than embracing your cultural cuisines !

So folks that was about it from Suruchi.
Check out my blog for a wholesome experience. Stay tuned and watch this space for more updates about restaurants in Kolkata.

And Be Suavy !!

This is a part of gupta brothers and I have visited gupta brothers in salt lake and some what did not like there service that much so I entered this place with not that great expectation with respect to service but when I entered here through there sweets section I was amazed ¬†with there service. Person at the ground floor helped me well in understanding where I can seat and have food of my choice.¬†
I entered there first floor and ordered for rajasthani thali. Initially they gave buttermilk which tasted good with great consistency and the it was chilled as per the expectation.Apart from this they had dal bati churma,rice ,roti,puran poli,gatte ki sabji ,dal , kadhi ,mix veg,alu tamatar and in desert suji ka halwa and fruit custard. Each and everything was nicely prepared ,I would say in a home cooked way and served in a great way. I would say this was my best experience ever ¬†with ¬†a great rajasthani thali meal .

Well there is a ton of Marwaari and Jain folk in the city who are always on lookouts for places that serve the traditional Rajasthani and Gujurati cuisine, without compromise in quality or quantity. There are only a handful of restaurants that provide for an unlimited veg thali option and Suruchi is one of the greats. I would like to thank Shahbaaz Zaman for recommending this vegetarian fine diner as the experience was one of unique.

As stated above, Suruchi is a pure vegetarian fine dine restaurant setup under the Gupta Bros. flagship. It is located on Tarak Dutta Road, the lane adjacent to Bata store, opposite to Quest Mall. The restaurant is on the 1st floor of the Gupta Bros. building. 

The entrance to the outlet is through a big wooden door with tinted glasses around it, setting in a traditional feel. The interiors and d√©cor revolve around the fusion of rural Rajasthani artworks and furnishing with a modern finesse. The outlet remains crystal clear standards of neatness maintained to their utmost. The walls are covered with smooth blue wallpapers with custom peacock print design. They have also been adorned with props like handmade classic puppets and traditionally designed lamps. The seating arrangements are aptly suited for large groups, mainly aimed at family diners. The long couches are really comfortable too.
The servers were dressed in the attires similar to those of the royal servants of maharajas. The quality and timing of their service is also worth a mention which makes this place a complete fine dine experience.

Let‚Äôs move on to the food audit. For the traditional meal, the menu has the following options of thalis ‚Äì Rajasthani, Gujurati and Punjabi. All these options are conveniently priced at the range of ‚Çπ250-350. And the fact that all these are unlimited is just like cherry atop a cake.

Sandeep and Rajkumar, were our servers for the evening. They are absolutely praise-worthy for their commendable efforts and service. I have been to many fine dine restaurants and the level of service here was no lesser in standard. The place is a boon for vegans looking to get affordable buffets and what can be better than embracing your cultural cuisines !

So folks that was about it from Suruchi.
Check out my blog for a wholesome experience. Stay tuned and watch this space for more updates about restaurants in Kolkata.

And Be Suavy !!
                                          ...

Location : This restaurant is located diagonally opposite to Quest mall. If you're coming from Gariahat, get down at the lane just before the "Mithai" one. Enter the lane and to your left, you'll notice Gupta Brothers. Suruchi is on the first floor of this very building!

I went along with Shahbaaz Zaman to this restaurant for a food tasting session!

Decor and Ambience :. The decor was typical Rajasthani. Beautiful lamps and hand puppets adorned the walls. The places was brightly lit up and the use of white color gave it an overall positive vibe.
Ambience was like that of any fine dine restaurant.

Service : I just cannot emphasize enough how AWESOME the service was. Every person there, was dressed in traditional Rajasthani attire including the colorful turban and all! Each of them was very courteous, polite and well behaved. They met our every needs with a s smiling face and explained the dishes whenever we asked for. Have to mention Mr. Raj Kumar's name, who was terrific in the service department. They really made us feel like royalty.

Now coming to the food. We were served with unlimited thalis of Rajasthani and Gujrati delicacies.

* We started with 'Chaas', which is basically buttermilk. It was beautiful and light, had the right amount of spices and a hint of coriander.

* Next, they kept the plate in front of me and started filling it with your watering food. Firstly they put green & red chutneys, some kind of a red sweet coconut-y thing along with khaman dhokla and moong pakodi. A small portion of salad was also served. The dhokla was soft and moist and was delicious. The pakodi or the fritters were crispy on the outside and mushy in the inside- Beautiful!

* Next I had the deal baat churma. It was basically a concoction of chana dal, small ' aata puri'(shaped like bowls) and smashed Gur. Thus, the name deal baati churma. It is a traditional Rajasthani snack and here it was executed to perfection. I cannot comment on the authenticity but it tasted very good.

Then, I proceeded with the other items :

* Gatte ki subzi : Gatta is basically small cubes of deep fried 'besan mixture'. The gattas are cooked in a yellow gravy and served hot. It tasted pretty good and went well with the roti they served us.

* Malai Corn : O MY GOD! This is the only item I refilled more than 5 times I guess. It was so delicious. Sweet corn kernels cooked in a creamy white sauce. It had hints of sweetness from the corn beautifully balanced with the overall creaminess from the sauce. Lip Smacking Delicious!

* Dal Makhani : Everyone is aware of this famous Punjabi dish and here it was done perfectly as well. I loved it.

* Chana masala : Kabuli chana cooked in a spicy gravy was served. It was delicious.

* Beans dal : this was a dal of Large kidney cooked in a gravy. I liked this as well.

* Paneer Butter Masala : whole doesn't like Anything Butter Masala? This Punjabi dish was again awesome. Loved eating this with the butter naan.

* Rajasthani paneer : This was paneer cooked in a yellowish gravy and tasted very good.

* Baingan ka subzi: this was like a mushy paste of brinjal cooked in spices. I loved it.

* Parwal ka subzi : parwal is 'potol', as we Bengalis call it. This was done so well, you wouldn't realize that's it's a parwal dish. Very good.

*Also masala : Booked potatoes tossed with 'bhuna hua masalas' and tasted yum!

* Aloo tamatar : Boiled Cube potatoes cooked in a tangy tomatoe-y gravy. Very good.

* Kadhis : they served us 3-4 different types of kadhi. I liked white kadhi the most. It was sweet and sour at the same time and tasted delicious.

* Bajre ki roti with Gur and ghee. The rotis were small, round and thick and tasted heavenly with Gur and ghee. The Gur was yum and the quality of ghee was commendable.

*Phulka : Basic Indian roti. It was made as expected .

* Laccha paratha and butter naan : The naan was so soft and buttery that I ended up eating a whole lot of those. And the laccha paratha had many intricate layers in it and was crispy on the outside. Big plus was it was not oily at all.

* Khicdi and plain rice : This khichdi was a little runny and the rice was not mushy. I am used to eating Bengali styled khichdi and this was thus, not my absolute favorite of the lot. The khichdi was again drizzled with that awesome clear ghee and we had masala papad to go along with it. The hot plain rice was cooked properly and the grains were long separated.

Desserts :

For dessert, we were served Suji halwa and fruit custard.
The Suji halwa was not too heavy which I liked. It was mildly sweet and tasted very good.

The fruits custard was oh so yum. Yellowish in color, had loads of apples and nuts in it. It was the perfect dessert to end the meal with.

Finally, after having all these, I cleaned my fingers in the finger bowl provided and ended the whole experience with 'misri' and 'saunf'( fennel seeds).

Being a hard core non vegetarian, I loved the food so much, coupled with the hospitality.. I had to rate it a complete 5. This is an experience u must have. Highly recommended!

One of those places which will definitely pop up in my mind whenever someone asks for suggestion about a good vegetarian place. Suruchi is one gem of a place for all the vegetarians. The place is just too good in each and every department. From the decor to food and specially the service is outstanding.

**Location:
Located just opposite to Quest Mall. You can find this place as you go in the lane next to Bata. First floor of Gupta Brothers and you reach your destination.

**Ambience & Decor:
Well, before the food arrives in your table, the first thing which impress you is the decor and the ambience of the place. And this place is too good with it. The traditional Indian theme gives a nice feel. The textured wall, the shelves with the famous Rajasthani Dolls, the lamp shades, everything giving the place a rich look. The antique bell clock and the paintings gives another dimension to the overall place.

**Service:
One of the firm believer of the fact that even if the food is not that impressive, the service heals the wound if its good. The service here is a class apart. Well dressed with the Rajasthani look. The staffs are super fast, knew their job well and courteous. A big thumbs up to this department.

Food:
This place serves three different thalis. The Punjabi, Gujrati and the Rajasthani Thalis. We tried all of them and it was really difficult to find any flaw in any of the dishes. From the welcome drink to the Dessert everything was perfect. The Dal Baati, the Dhokla, the Churma, the Butter Panner were the highlights of the evening. The custard gave the perfect end to the meal.

Last Words:
If you wanna taste some delicious Indian Vegetarian Cuisine this place is worth a visit.

4.5/5 for the amazing time.

From past few weeks I'm thinking to go to some traditional place and try some traditional Cuisine like Desi Thali's. So I pin some restaurants in zomato I asked some foodies which place is better and then many foodies specially Shahbaaz Zaman strongly recommended me to try Suruchi. So I check in here for dinner with some of my foodie friends and spend a traditionally Delicious evening.

Location - It was located in ballygung. Opposite side on Quest Mall next to Bata Showroom in a narrow lane. First floor of the same building were Barista and Gupta's was.

D√©cor- Well D√©cor was completely Traditional. Theme was Rajasthani. Wall was covered with golden Peacocks and trees drawings  in blue background wallpapers. Seats were like Gaddi very comfortable and royal. There are Rajadhani traditional puppets all over the walls. Devided in two rooms. One has a straight line long table to sit and single separate table to sit and other one is a big hall with some tables to sit fully separated with a big door. In this hall you see a old age bell clock and couple of Rajasthani paintings. Lighting were also equally traditional.

Ambience- very impressed with the Ambience. It was fantastic. Hospitality was heart touching. Service was quick and presentation was amazing. Staff was very friendly and confident. Impressed with service also alot. They were really good in that. You gonna loved their service and I don't think you find any complaint about it.

So now let's talk about love i.e. food.
They Served Thali's so we ordered all three Thali's i.e. Rajasthani, Gujrati and Punjabi and on special request they allow us to mix all Thali's so that we can enjoy all the dishes and write about it.
Okay so let's see what we tried and how good were that.

In thali first item we got was Chhas (buttermilk) It was spiced buttermilk with some chat masala, crushed cumin, black salt and some coriander leaves in it. It was very good but it will be more better it they add some mint leaves in it.

After then they serve us Dal Bati Churma in Thali which was an traditional Rajasthani snack in which Dal was an simply spicy and hot chana dal and bati was bolls made of Whole wheat flour which we fried in desi ghee and Churma made of finely smached gur. We mix all three together and pour some desi ghee on top and made a amazing snack which was very Delicious in taste and royal in look.

Then they serve us Khaman Dhokla and mung pakodi with some chatnis. Dhokla was very tasty. It was soft and Khaman was properly maintained. We can feel the tanginess of Khaman with rawness of besan and sweetness of water. Served with coriander and mint chatni which was also tasty. Mung Dal Pakodi was less spicy and salty just the way made it Rajasthan. Very tasty served with imli and chilly chatni & Garlic and chilly chatni they were truly desi, very tasty and best match for pakodi.

Then they serve us all the vegetables which were reviewed below-

* Gatte ki Sabji - This was the one which I'm having from my childhood atleast once in a month. My personal favorite and they mede it truly Delicious. The best part is that they haven't experiment with it. They made it pure traditionally. Gatta made with Dough of besan floor with some spices and red chilly powder. Cooked in yellow gravy with dahi mixed to it tastes finger leaking Delicious.

* Chana Masala - Kabuli Chana cooked in dry gravy with full of spices and ginger garlic paste tastes truly punjabi. Spicy and very tasty.

* Corn & Methi in Cream - It was punjabi dish. Sweet in taste made with boiled corn and methi cooked in Cream very Delicious.

* Beans Dal - Many people didn't knew about it so let me tell you what exactly it was. It was an north indian dal which was made with white kidney beans which were tastes like soya bean and rajma. With added some spices and cooked in tomato gravy. It was very taste and also this beans has large amount of proteins which helms in cure diabetes and kidney problems.

* Butter Paneer Masala - Punjabi dish made of soft and creamy paneer cooked in Cream and cashew dry gravy. Very Delicious, creamy and little sweet.

* Dal Makhani- No need to describe this one we all know what is Dal Makhani was. One of the pride dishes of north India. They made this with true love. Tastes just like tastes in home. thick, creamy and spicy. Very tasty.

* Rajasthani Paneer - Soft and creamy diced paneer cooked in yellow gravy with some spices and methi tastes spicy and little tangy cause of dahi factor. Very Delicious. Loved it.

* Sweet Bitter gourd - Yes you heard it right sweet bitter gourd. But no they didn't make bitter gourd sweet. Bitter gourd was in its actual taste. They just fried bitter gourd in sweet sauce and with sweet vegetable which name I won't reveal. You try and find out yourself.i can only say that you gonna love this experiment.

* Aloo Masala - Boiled aloo cooked with dry masalas and less spicy red chilly powder. Truly Rajasthani, spicy and very tasty.

* Brinjal - The most hated vegetable worldwide Brinjal is one of the most favorite vegetables of marvadi people  only because we made it so Delicious with of method of cooking with spices. First im double minded that they make it better or not but after tasting this I'm very impressed by them because they make it perfectly with right choice of spices.

* Parwal Bhaji - It was tasty but not up to the make. The method of cooking was perfect. The choice of spices was good but they use less spices because of that it was less spicy but still taste was good and it's truly Rajasthani.

* Aloo Tamatar - It was the most commonly cooked vegetable in marwari house. Boiled aloo cooked in tomato based red watery gravy which was spicy, little tangy and very tasty in taste.

With all this vegetables we have some breads to taste like Bajre ki Roti which was an traditional Rajasthani roti made of Bajre ka aata and it's taste best with gud and hot ghee.  and we have phulka which was normally called chapati and we have khulcha and naan. All were cooked under perfect limit and tastes good.

Then after they serve us Rajasthani Khichdi which was made of boiled rice and pulses. Well some people wouldn't like this because they used to eat the thick one but in typical marwari house you always see the Khichdi cooked little watery and personally I'm also used to like the watery one. It was perfectly made. Little watery with perfect amount of salt and aroma of cloves and cardamom. Served with Rajasthani khadi which was simple, plain and tangy made of besan tastes very Delicious & perfect suit for Khichdi and Gujrati Khadi which was sweet in taste and made of dairy products.

After then they serve us steam rice with Rajasthani dal which was made of chana. spicy, hot and very tasty. and Gujrati Dal which was sweet in taste because they add sugar in normal spicy dal that's the only difference.

We end our traditionally Delicious journey with couple of Desserts reviewed below-

* Halwa- Truly traditional Rajasthani Halwa made of Suji and sugar. Made by fry suji and sugar in low flame and add some desi ghee and some dry fruits in it. Sweet, perfectly soft cooked and very Delicious.

*Custard- Custard was very Delicious. Yellow in colour because of saffron water and Delicious in taste because it made deliciously with mithai made, little caramel, dahi and rose water with added apples, pomegranate and sugar in it.

It was an traditionally Delicious experience. Like to thank the service team Mr. Rajkumar and other boys for taking care of us so nicely. Personal favorite place. Must try. Highly recommended to all. Loved it.

With all this vegetables we have some breads to taste like Bajre ki Roti which was an traditional Rajasthani roti made of Bajre ka aata and it's taste best with gud and hot ghee.  and we have phulka which was normally called chapati and we have khulcha and naan. All were cooked under perfect limit and tastes good.

Then after they serve us Rajasthani Khichdi which was made of boiled rice and pulses. Well some people wouldn't like this because they used to eat the thick one but in typical marwari house you always see the Khichdi cooked little watery and personally I'm also used to like the watery one. It was perfectly made. Little watery with perfect amount of salt and aroma of cloves and cardamom. Served with Rajasthani khadi which was simple, plain and tangy made of besan tastes very Delicious & perfect suit for Khichdi and Gujrati Khadi which was sweet in taste and made of dairy products.

After then they serve us steam rice with Rajasthani dal which was made of chana. spicy, hot and very tasty. and Gujrati Dal which was sweet in taste because they add sugar in normal spicy dal that's the only difference.

We end our traditionally Delicious journey with couple of Desserts reviewed below-

* Halwa- Truly traditional Rajasthani Halwa made of Suji and sugar. Made by fry suji and sugar in low flame and add some desi ghee and some dry fruits in it. Sweet, perfectly soft cooked and very Delicious.

*Custard- Custard was very Delicious. Yellow in colour because of saffron water and Delicious in taste because it made deliciously with mithai made, little caramel, dahi and rose water with added apples, pomegranate and sugar in it.

It was an traditionally Delicious experience. Like to thank the service team Mr. Rajkumar and other boys for taking care of us so nicely. Personal favorite place. Must try. Highly recommended to all. Loved it.

the place is cutely decorated with a rajasthani set up and the waiters are dressed as per the theme which was quite impressive as usually eateries with themes forget about the dress code

 I went there on a sunday afternoon and was treated to a really tasty thali . 
The place has a soothing ambience with 90's hindi instrumentals in the background . 
The menu is almost exclusively thali's which makes life that much easier . 
I tried the punjabi thali . They have a rajasthani and a Gujarati thali too . 
The idea is pretty neat . Unlimited food and when on a hogg-a-thon the perfect place to crash with a group of friends or family . Do check it out .

Went here for a Monday nite dinner (Monday Motivation :p) Turns out it was an awesome find, from food to ambience everything was just right!
Food is served at a finger's snap (literally! No kidding!) Staff members communicate by snapping! Amazing hospitality shown by the staff especially Mr. Heera who served my table with a smiling face! Such warmth seems to be missing in most of the restaurants thus I hereby announce all other reviews of this restaurant catering inhospitable staff to be false!

Coming to the food me and my friend ordered two Thalis. The Rajasthani Thali brought the richness of the state to the table! Especially Gatte ki sabji was good, but the Dal baati churma can be improved though! Overall 3/5

The winner of the evening was the Punjabi Thali- Bhai Sahab maza aa gaya!!

Chana Masala, Shai Paneer, and the Special Creamy Corn deserves a special mention! 3.5/5

We finished the heavy meal with Fruit custard and Lauki ka halwa, where the former was average and the later was good! 3/5.

A neat place opened by Gupta brothers owners. It is located close to quest mall ( opp foot near the baat lane). The entire building has different options from the same group including a lounge. 

The place is a complete family restaurant suitable for a dine out with family. 
Earlier they used to house a lot of south Indian, north Indian and Chinese dishes. Now the concept has changed and they have moved to a thali and combo style meals.
I have tried their north Indian and rajasthani meal and both are equally amazing! 
The food is light so you can take refills. The taste palette suits marwaris and Gujarati's alike!
The interiors are nice and pleasant.
Prices are reasonable and service is good. 
Overall a nice place for a light dinner when you're not in mood of something fancy.

To say the truth ......I went there to have the unlimited thali....
But only after I sat downstairs and ordered my food that I was told that the unlimited section was upstairsüòëüòõ!
But the portions in limited thali is enough to make you full. Their spinach pasta was blunt......but the cheese garlic bread is a must try ........and not to mention their south Indian variety of food too .There's free parking too.

Loved the ambience of this restaurant,the decor gives a feel of " Rangeela Rajasthan",with the hanging puppets,the pics on the wall and the mirror studded lamp shades. The writing " padharo sa" is an additional touch of the desert state. This is a thali restaurant with fine dining exp. ( Loved it) They have three types of thalis... Rajasthani, Gujarati and Punjabi . We ordered Rajasthani and Gujarati thalis. The dal bati Churma was tasty.The meal started off with the server putting a steel thali with many steel bowls in front of us and then serving a fresh salad of cucumber and carrots.After that he served two chutneys,onne sweet tamarind and other hot red garlicone. Farsan was same for both thalis moong dal bajia,served hot with salt masala sprinkled on top. ( Tasty) Then the veggies and fall arrived,all put in the small steel bowls. There was dal,curry,gatta subji,alu subji,cauliflower subjiand a baigan subji( good taste),I liked the baingan and cauliflower I felt that the dal needed improvement.I also tasted the Curry and dal in the Gujarati thalis( both were different and way too sweet) For rotis,there was phulka,makai roti and puran poli( same for both thalis types. Then they served rice with papad.There was also a soothing glass of masala chaas,There was steamed rice and desserts was fruit custard,( this surprised me as I wondered when did custard become Rajasthani or Gujarati cuisine
 The besan barfi was authentic Rajasthani. All in all the meal was good. The waiters went about their service efficiently and smilingly. ( They even explained what some dishes were) In fact one veg in the Gujarati thali we couldn't make out what it was..( kundroo,)The Gujarati thali had a vegg preparation in yoghurt with veggies like. Capsicum. I liked it but my friend found it too sour!!
Overall it was a good experience and I definitely want to come back to taste more varieties.
H
( Haven't given a higher score for I felt that some dishes especially the dal was pedestrian lacking ng good flavours.)

Located opposite of Quest mall, just back of Bata building. Gupta brothers restaurant,  Suruchi. They have the Thali system consisting of Punjabi, Rajasthani, Gujarati. UNLIMITED food available, at a very reasonable price. And the best thing I liked if you have ordered for punjabi Thali, you could also take the items of Gujarati and Rajasthani Thali too. Several options. We had ordered for rajasthani and punjabi Thali. There was more than 25+ items. Staffs were cooperative and smiling.  Service was fast. Parking is also not a problem. Too much spacious. A must visit with your family and friends, but go with the empty stomach. 
Highly recommended. 
Cheers!

The BATA Lane, near Quest mall, near Beck bagan Mithai, has certainly on the verge of becoming foodie's paradise. Within a year, i guess the lane now houses 4-5 quality outlets all very different in terms of decor and the kind of food they specializes in.
Suruchi Veg restaurant is another edition to it. we were hearing a lot-of- not-so-good-not-so-bad-reviews of this place and always wanted to check this place out. So finally we hit this place on Poila Boishakhi day with one of my foodie friend.

Almost all the tables were occupied which was understood considering the fact that it was holiday and on top of it during dinner hour. we were given the menu very promptly. While enquiring we also were informed that on the first floor thali's are available and on the second floor they have a hookah parlour. we were not so hungry so we thought of going ahead with the a la carte section sitting at the ground floor.

We ordered Methi matar malai, Dal makhni with lachha parantha for the main course. Dahi vada as a starter and we also got one Malai kofta packed>

Positives:¬†
1. Restaurant was clean and overall it was giving a very hygienic feel.
2. Lightings were appropriate.¬†
3. food was served within the time frame. although the restaurant was packed to its capacity.
4. we were thing about ordering dahi vada and they actually made one as per our specifications for testing. which was a good gesture.

Area of improvements: ¬†¬†

1. I guess when it comes to serving people, they dont have sufficient manpower. i could see only 2-3 active people on the floor. almost all they tables having some food or service related issues.
2. The very basic thing, like serving water, they need reminders.
3. they forgot to serve accompaniments with the Indian main course.
4. they forgot to serve us Soda shikanji. we reminded them more than 3-4 times but they failed it to deliver us. finally we cancelled our order.

very pocket friendly at the pricing factor. meal for two would be within 400. food is really testy. and i really liked all of the preparation served to us .

While the Thalis here are tasty and good, the restaurant utterly lacks out in staff behaviour and service.
Also the other food items available here are not fresh and stink badly..

Located in a lane near Bata opp. to Quest Mall, many find it difficult to locate but it was pretty easy for me to reach there. Having visited all there individual eateries, Suruchi is like an traditional restaurant where you are served food the Thali way meaning a preset menu all served in a thali together, with refilling permitted.
With variations from Punjabi to Rajasthani to Gujrati the food served here has a different feel & taste than the one served at any outlet.
One must visit if looking for tasty vegetarian food along with a small hole in your pocket.

Before writing this review I must mention that I'm a hardcore non-vegetarian. So trying out a veg restaurant was quite nerve wrecking till I entered the place. I was simply awestruck by their hospitality. The place will surely give you a 'KHANDANI' feeling, having nice wall paintings and quite a comfortable seating arrangement.¬†

We ordered Rajasthani Thalis. They gave us a huge steel thali with 6 to 7 bowls on it and in the blink of an eye they were filled with some traditional rajasthani dishes which not only looked delicious but tasted divine. We were served with so many dishes that we hardly remember their names. But each of them had their own unique taste.

Overall it was wonderful experience. Looking forward to visit this place again !! :)

Super food..super service and the best part is they just won't stop serving you even if you ask..
All the dishes were prepared perfectly..nothing really missing..
Only one red flag they frequently provide the place for private parties so do make a call before dropping by to avoid disappointment...have been in the other side 4-5 times..so please do buzz them before going..super food keep that going guys

There are times when you are kind of looking for a restaurant which serves a speciality of vegetarian meals but seldom you get the opportunity to trace them due to the non popularity of its existence in the city . However of late many veg food restaurant options have opened doors in the city and are slowly getting the grip of lovers of veg as well as non veg folks who consider veg occasionally. For no dissapointment and no regrets SURUCHI VEG RESTAURANT has all that you need to fill your belly with a variety of foods only in vegetarian strictly but a sure treat of almost all from street foods to heavy eating options available here. The main aspect of this restaurant are the Unlimited thalis they offer in three varieties which is Rajasthani , Gujarati & Punjabi .

HOW TO REACH HERE --

Its a bit tricky for the newbies in the city however if you are familiar with BATA SHOWROOM located in the road heading towards Quest mall from ice skating stretch side if you are coming then get inside the lane as you see BATA SHOWROOM and you will see SURUCHI VEG RESTAURANT in the same building on the first floor where other restaurant named shudh is located probably the same owner is running it too .

THE AMBIENCE PART --

As you enter here you get the feel of a traditional Indian restaurant with a bit of modern touch with its interior and designs . But once you take the stairs upwards its totally different with huge royal mirrors , clocks , art works , glass cascades , crafted chandeliers , paintings , handmade folk and traditional based designs on the roofs and sides and not forgetting the floors to be fitted with granite tiles and the seating arrangement decked up with cushioned soft sofas resting the entire stretch of one part of sitting and chairs at the facing of each long tables placed . They have a huge TV set and play a lot of traditional folk music giving a drive and feel of the food more interestingly . The servers here are dressed in their traditional kurta pyjama with a turban and they seem to be very young and knowledgeble of their job .Then they have decorated dolls and puppets placed on top of most of the side walls highlighting the culture more and adding to the eye catching part of the restaurant . Its very close to a royal feel here with all this treatment that you get indeed.

THE FOOD & DRINKS PART --

Well as the whole environment was so mesmerizing so definetly I wanted to explore the real Indian veg food more now as I was excited so had placed my order for Punjabi unlimited thali and happily the waiter had showed some finger sign to the kitchen and the plates were layed out on my table . The table has steel big plates with 5 to 6 bowls and 2 glasses along for every individual who orders a thali . So at first CHILLED WATER and BUTTER MILK commonly known as Chanch was filled up in the glass and after I had a full glass immediately it was refilled which was quite nice on taste so I did not mind sipping more. Next came the CHUTNEYS one was red colour sweet one and another was green a little spicy chutney .Moving on came the chopped salads along with the first two starters DHOKLA & PUNJABI SAMOSA .
The dhokla was pretty nice and great on taste when dippied with the chutneys . The Punjabi samosa was a bit dissapointing for me as it had noodles inside which I relate very much to Chinese samosa not Punjabi . Next the pickle , lime and papad was served on my plate along with the 4 side curries which were

1) PANEER CURRY
2) ALOO ONION CURRY
3) CORN MALAI CURRY AND
4 ) CHANA CURRY

Among all of these curries I liked the paneer one the most as it was the best to try with any rotis or rice meal as the taste was very nice and yummy . The aloo onion was also nice in taste not that spicy . The corn malai was on the sweeter side as a side dish. And the Chana curry was the hot one in taste .

Now there were two types of Dal's also served along with all these which were DAL MAKHNI & another SPICY DAL .The Dal Makhni was very yummy and nicely blended with spices as well as the Spicy dal was yellow in colour and tasted superb with Rice mainly.
To have all these there were two different ROTIS and two different PARATHAS and NAAN as well as one SPECIAL BISCUIT too . still not finished they have more to offer like WHITE BASMATI RICE which goes well with dal and most of the side dishes from the mentioned ones above .
All these food dishes are on a unlimited course so the amount of refills I covered was mostly in rice and paneer mainly and yes plain soft Roti's too .
Lastly after this spread the desserts came in action which were GAJAR KA HALWA and FRUIT CUSTARD .
The Custard was a mix of cut fruits in a chilled sweet milky flavoured and yellow coloured served in a bowl which was amazing. The Halwa was also nice and red abd orange in colour but because I was almost full so couldn't go through it completely .

HOSPITALITY PART --

Right as you enter till you take your seat the waiter's here are very alert from making sure you get a refill and want to encourage you on eating more which is a very good thing about this place . They are happily serving and quick with the food and very kind .
I had a problem with my card so I had to get out cash from the ATM next door so I was happily allowed to do so and clear my bill amount which was very sweet of them and also reasonably priced at the end for such a royal like feel eating . As the strength of the work force is young mostly that creates a very brisk movement and are setting a good impression in hospitality .

So finally after this visit I am clearly very sure that this place will definetly be a wish list for many when I recommend this to my known folks as well as for the food lovers in the city as with this right spirit of food & service and also the affordable rates where will you get this royal like treatment in the city ? Probably no where else but only at SURUCHI VEG RESTAURANT .

Attractive decorations, bright n silent atmosphere, well mannered attendant and appetizing thalis. Being a non-vegetarian I liked the Punjabi thali the most but Rajasthani thali n Gujrati thali are also very enjoyable. :)

There is ala cart option on ground floor and thali option on 1st floor. The place is clean, comfortable and service is also good. The Gujrati  as well as punjabi thali is very good. The preparation is very good. I don't think such good gujrati thali is available in Calcutta.
For me, its a value for money option that I can definitely visit every 6 months for the yummy Gujrati thali.

I ordered for Home Del. on 15- Jan-2016. for TOLLYGUNGE Res. & they delivered well before time. I gave them liberty to put Delivery Charges. They were so reasonably charged me Rs. 30.00 only & that was quite justified. Now, Food- I asked for only Rajasthani dishes like, 1) Gatte.- 2 plts. 2). Raj.Kadi- 2 plts. . 3) Raj. Dal.-2plts. 4) Tawa Roti -5nos. ¬†5) Bajra Roti -1 No. I must admit that one of the best Raj. Food I've enjoyed in Kolkata. They have proved they are UNPARRALAL ! All the foods are sooo.... Delicious .The pocket friendly price is another area I must mention. Truly, I declare that their staffs are very customer friendly, Mr. Narendra took keen interest for this ailing person, I'm thankful to him & SVR. Thanks to Del. man Sri, Prashant also. I look forward for many more services in future or very soon. Had I ever ordered to the Rstnt. on Russell St. The amount would've been 4 to 5 times, thus causing a big dent in my pocket.

This place is known for their veg thali...
After trying out all 3 thalis on different occasions, this is my review...
A non vegetarian trying out veg at this restaurant can eat Punjabi thali, well that's my recommendation...its more masaledaar and tasty, u know what i mean... Rajasthan and Gujarati thali were not upto the mark, they were just ok...Punjabi thali is what I loved...we don't need to talk about the quantity because its unlimited... They will refill till your tummy fills :)
The price is reasonable considering quality and quantity...

So here's my rating...
Ambience: 4/5
Food: 3.5/5
Music: 3.5/5 (they play traditional folk music)
Hospitality: 4.5/5

It's worth a visit....

Update: went to this place again to try their paw bhaji...I though I would eat 4-5 plates.... But it was so filling that I stopped after 2plates....and then u get deserts with it too....the taste was really good....

Unlimited Food! Yayy! Everyone likes too much food and not too much to pay plus the added benefit of the great taste of the food. We had the Punjabi, Gujarati and the Vada paw thali. Some of the punjabi food was a little spicy and the Gujarati food was good,but being one myself i can say could have been better. But otherwise overall the thalis have a colourful variety and great taste. The people are very cordial and the location is quiet. Visiting this place would give you an authentic taste of Indian food for a change from all the brrad and cheese ;)

This place came under our notice one day when we was out for shopping at quest and was looking out for a veg restaurant. We were four of us and after a tiring shopping came to this place for dinner. First thing what I liked about this place is our Desipan total Indian style loved it and the dressing of staffs interiors of the restaurant everything was very homely and felt a totally awesome.
Let's come to the food part we ordered Punjabi and Rajasthani thali and the food was very tasty and quantity was more than enough as the staffs kept offering and we went on eating lol but trust me food quality n quantity both are great. Price is not at all expensive and worth. 
If you have not visit this place yet give a visit it's worth. Best wishes to the Suruchi team

Went today for lunch, very good ambience excellent service,  courteous staff but what is missing is authentic rajasthani and gujrati food. 
Just adding sugar doesnt makes any dish gujrati and i couldnt understand how the chef can add coconut in rajasthani or gujju dishes.. If they improve upon authenticity it can be a great place.

Really nice place with gud options and wide variety of food at a very affordable price.
The good part is that the food quality level these guys have is really great
I hope they keep up with the affordability and the quality
Next time will surely try the restaurant on the 2nd floor which is only thali

An average typical Rajasthani cum Gujarati cuisuine.
Three options to select from
Rajasthani Thali
Gujarati Thali
Punjabi Thali
Among the other options available are Pawbhaji combo and Chole Bhautre combo.
.5 for the decor which is filled with paintaings and traditional antiques.
One time visit place and if you are a die hard fan of tasting traditional Thali do try this place
.5 for its less expensive price @rs 268 Inc tax.

Suruchi Vegetarian Restaurant‚Äô is the answer to the prayers of pure veg diners who were soaringly missing North Indian ‚Äòthalis‚Äô, ever since ‚ÄòKhandani Rajdhani‚Äô pulled down its shutter in the City of Joy. This restaurant is located in the lane adjacent to ‚ÄòBata‚Äô shop, on Syed Amir Ali Avenue. This shop lies between ‚ÄòIce Skating Rink‚Äô and ‚ÄòMithai‚Äô sweet shop, both of which are popular landmarks in that area.

However, there exists some confusion in the nomenclature. Outside this eatery, the big rectangular signboard reads ‚ÄòGupta Brother‚Äôs Shudh Vegetarian Food Court‚Äô, and a small signboard outside a first floor window reads ‚ÄòSuruchi Vegetarian Restaurant‚Äô. Many get confused by this. Some also refer to ‚ÄòSuruchi‚Äô as ‚ÄòShudh‚Äô. However, both of them are ventures of Delhi based ‚ÄòSwati Group‚Äô. Their Kolkata outlet is in tandem with ‚ÄòGupta Brothers‚Äô, one of the leading local food chain owners. ‚ÄòShudh‚Äô is the ground floor restaurant with a la carta system, and ‚ÄòSuruchi‚Äô is the first floor based and decorated diner with ‚Äòthali‚Äô system.

‚ÄòSuruchi‚Äô comprises of two rooms, approximately 30 and 40 seaters respectively. These rooms are interconnected. Seating is in the form of chairs and sofas, which are wooden and upholstered. Table tops are wooden, but their legs are metallic. Flooring is made of granite. Ceilings are white with simple decorations. Entrance room is more artistically decorated than the inside room. The former is adorned with paintings and a couple of antiques. Loo facility is available on the floor. Overall, the place is clean and has a north-west Indian, royal feel. 

Serving is done in steel utensils, except for the welcome drink ‚Äòchach‚Äô (buttermilk), which was served in a plastic glass. The manager is attired in a suit, whereas, the waiters are in crisp white ‚Äòkurta-pajama‚Äô with colorful ‚Äòsafa‚Äô/‚Äôpagdi‚Äô. The waiters are young and north-westerners. They are attentive and well informed about their food. But they need a lot more professional training. While dining, we were the only group present, and still they were getting confused as to which person has ordered which ‚Äòthali‚Äô! They were also clueless about giving certain privacy to the diners. However, they happily and patiently clicked our group snaps upon askance.

The menu comprises of three ‚Äòthalis‚Äô  ‚Äì Rajasthani, Gujrati, Punjabi, and two ‚Äòcombos‚Äô - Pao Bhaji Combo and Vada Pao Combo. Each ‚Äòthali‚Äô/combo is available in two variations ‚Äì adult and child. Of course, the child one has lesser items and also costs less. Each ‚Äòthali‚Äô/combo has different pricing for weekdays and weekends & holidays. Jain option is also available upon askance. Unlimited servings are allowed in ‚Äòthalis‚Äô, and it‚Äôs mandatory for each diner to order a separate ‚Äòthali‚Äô or ‚Äòcombo‚Äô. However, once we all ordered individual ‚Äòthalis‚Äô, waiters were generous in serving, and did not mind, even if one asked for a particular item, which was not a part of her own ‚Äòthali‚Äô. In fact, they insisted upon tasting all items!

We ordered ‚Äì Rajasthani Thalis, Gujrati Thalis and Vada Pao Combos. Punjabi Thali was not available. Both Rajasthani and Gujrati Thalis comprised of ‚Äì salad, mirchi ka achar, hari chutney, imli ki chutney, lahsun ki chutney,  ghungra, dhokla, phulka, bajre ki roti, bakhri ke biscuit, ghee, gur, chawal, and papad. The former had additional dal, bati churma in it. Both ‚Äòthalis‚Äô had their regional dal, kadhi and four other sabjis. Dessert was an option between gulab jamun and custard. From when since, custard became an Indian regional food was a million dollar question. Vada Pao Combo comprised of ‚Äì two Vada Paos, potato wafers, hari chutney, imli ki chutney and a seasoning.

Both ‚Äòthalis‚Äô were good, though not very distinct. Achar was fresh and bakhri ke biscuit was a new item for all. Their taste was on the sweeter side. Among the sabjis, tindola and chawli were liked by all. Both were unusual to get in a diner. Lahsun chutney was also pretty well made. Vada Pao Combo was a downer. It was in no way near to the Mumbai Vada Paos. But if you will compare them with the local ones, they were OK.

Average costing of each ‚Äòthali‚Äô and ‚Äòcombo‚Äô would be Rs. 250/- and Rs. 130/- respectively. Their introductory prices are lesser than their other Indian outlets.

All in all, ‚ÄòSuruchi‚Äô is a nice and economic place for old style, sit-down, vegetarian family dining.

Another pure Veg restaurant and specially best place with Family....
Rajasthani theme based ambiance, spacious and those who prefer having Thalis must visit here....
In Ground floor area u can order ala carte and in first floor area u will be served Thalis.... Gujarati, Rajasthani and Punjabi Thalis are served and food here is really delicious..¬†
Many items are served and that too unlimited from achar, chutney, papad, chas ,3 types of vegetables, 2 types of dal, breads, farsans, rice-khichdi and dessert....¬†
Staff and service here is excellent... Full points to them and its a request to the management that special recommendation should be given to them... The way they treat and serve you, it feels like you are a special person getting lavish treatment ...
¬†I had ordered Punjabi thali but wana taste daal bati churma so i just asked for it and next moment without any delay i was served.. As we went in group and all had ordered for different Thalis but wana taste something or the other from different thalis so we requested and same was served and that too without any argument or any other further questions...
As far as rates are concerned its pocket friendly...
Definitely must try this place.....

Ambience is good....a typical rajesthani look.... They just serve three types of thalis...Gujarati, Rajesthani & Punjabi....and two combos.... Food is descent, however service needs to be improved.... I ordered for Punjabi thali and was also being served marwari food.... Also some items were finished..... So need to work or else ..... Not anywhere near Rajdhani.

Excellent food. Ambience excellent too. As of now had  Punjabi thali. Looking forward to Gujarati soon.  However they need to come up the curve as compared to Delhi karolbagh suruchi. - They are perfect.

Visited this restaurant for the first time with so much expectations but not at all happy with the service.¬†
actually I was looking for Veg Thali.¬†This restaurant has Gujrati, Rajasthani & Panjabi Thali along with other ala carte veg options of South Indian, Chinese, Gujrati, Rajasthani & Panjabi.

Good ambiance of Rajasthan with Rajasthani song. neat & clean. the staff were polite. We ordered for Gujrati Thali & Panjabi Thali.¬†
however they only served Gujrati meal to both of us. Food was good but as everyone was so busy didn't have time to check weather we have finished our food or not, we are asking for anything or not. we have any issue with the meal or not. They did repeat any of the item without asking for 2-3 times except Roti & Papad. We had to wait for long. this is very much disappointing. No sweet item was there at the end. khichdi & butter milk was tasteless. we asked for Paratha but they said we don't have any. where as they ware serving.
And the manager was polite but so much confused & didn't know how to handle the guest.¬†
But the surprise was about to come, they charged us for Gujrati Thali & Panjabi Thali both, which was not served at all. when we call the Manager he was surprise too & started asking others where as no one knows about our order. Then they changed the bill but it was very unprofessional behavior. When you are expecting something & getting something else more over on one is there to listen to you.
