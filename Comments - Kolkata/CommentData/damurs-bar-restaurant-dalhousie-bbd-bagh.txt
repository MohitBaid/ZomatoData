Ok, this was a visit that was quite a few months ago. I went with a friend who had heard of the buffet lunch offered here but on reaching we got to know that there isn't any buffet. So we had to do with the a la carte menu. The food was delicious no doubt. We tried out the biriyani. It was pretty good. The price is a bit on the higher side.

Had office lunch here. Ambiance was not so good, but food was better than avarage. I did not get so much low cost non veg buffet till now. It was only rs. 199/- per head. Too much cheap.

This is my favourite place since my childhood. My dad used to take us here. I love this place as many memories are attached to it too. Food is good here. The ambiance is quite soothing and the service is also good. A good place to visit with your family for a dinner night.

I have visited this place with my colleagues, disgusting seating arrangement dirty table cloth and uncomfortable stained seats. Ground floor Interior is very bad

Here i like paneer hariyali kabab... taste is awsome

I have ordered indian veg thali (Rs. 150inclusive of taxes) which contains matar aloo, matar paneer, yellow daal, jeera rice, half size roasted papad, one half size naan, salad, quarter size lassi, gulab jamun.

Taste is pretty good.

Two matar/peas dish in same thali i don't think is justifying.....they need to change the dish
Waiting time is too much for this restaurant. You have to wait for approx. 30 min for your ordered cuisine
Staff is slow, not well trained.
Yellow daal is very disappointing..... it is actually yellow paste i mean overcooked
Overall quantity is not sufficient for an adult one.

Never had the privilege to visit this place personly but have savored various food parcled from this restaurant. I really like their food. It's tasty and quite suptuous.be north Indian food be biriyani. The biriyani is really very different and simple yet tasty . The fish fry is big sized and quite good amount of fish stuffing

Situated just behind the KOLKATA POLICE headquarters and in one of the most busiest areas of the city the place is basically unknown to many people but trust me this is one of the best place to dine and wine. Food is good, cheap drinks, disciplined system, huge space and some awesome starters. Try the Tandoori Chicken and Reshmi Kebab here you will not regret. The only disadvantaged of this place is the location and congestion of the area. You hv to walk a bit to reach there from the place where your bus stops. Tram is the only option to reach there conveniently but getting tram in Kolkata is like getting an oasis in desert. Apart from all these I would like to suggest you all to pay a visit at least once :)

My father used to bring us here a lot for dinners. I loved the place. It had this old world charm to it. Gave you the feeling of being in a gone by era/time.
We had fixed items that we ordered.
Kebabs, butter naan and chicken bharta.
No clue how the food and service is now but then it was really good.

Dropped in twice. The best thing about the place is it's accessibility, just a few blocks behind Lalbazar. The Chinese main course dishes were adequately cooked and flavoured. The tandoori chicken however seemed a bit too spicy. The decor is sober and the ambience soothing. Overall, a fulfilling experience at an affordable price. Highly recommended.

This restaurant have 2 parts one is bar another one is restaurant but drinks are available here as well.. we thought to opt for non -veg buffet which was 475/- for dinner.. 
Ambiance is simple with instrumental music and good fragrance..
Coming to food... 
Starters they serve soups,fish fingers,chicken tikia kebabs and thai chicken..
The starters were really good fish finger was stuffed with fish,kebabs were perfectly cooked with minimum masala and they were not burnt.. and the thai chicken was tooo good the flavor of honey and chili were playing in my mouth.. after starters my expectation for main course was high..
Main course they serve: peas rice,butter naan,palak corn,mixed veg,paneer masala,fish curry,mutton gravy,hakka noodles and chili chicken.. 
Trust me it was the worst food i ever had in any restaurant.. it was leftover food the peas rice was pathetic it became chewy and dry,palak corn no corn in palak, paneer was fine but the gravy was spiceless,butter naan was burnt from the other side,mutton pathetic i had to call the staffs and tell them about the food and they cooked it again..
Dessert: only gulab jamuns and vanilla scoop ice cream..
Staffs were not friendly, they concentrate on those who order drinks because after starters (which they serve on the table) the plates were empty and we waited for 7-8mins to someone come down and take the soilled plates. We spoke with manager and told them about their service and pathetic food and they billed us 1150/- ,i.e, 475+20% tax..
**I would never recommend anyone,i would have rated 0 but because of the starters they deserve 2.

We have mostly ordered Non veg Indian. Food is as expected and nothing too much over the top. You know what I expect from each dish & one can order safely for their bosses as well.. Very easy to locate, which is a big scorer.. üòÄ

Was planing to visit this restaurant from many days, and finally hopped into it.
The ambience is good. Food is moderate.
Choose buffet; starters were awesum, main-course and desert were moderate.

Since its a bar and restaurant, maximum of the people were drinking.
I think they should separate family dining and drinks place to make it more comfortable.
Its very uncomfortable to dine with people all around you drinking, esspecially when you are with someone special.

I have been here a minimum of 7 times. If you are visiting with family, for lunch, do reach by 3 pm, or they close off the family section. Now coming to the food, the food is good. I have tried quite a few items, and have not been disappointed by any. If you are a fish lover, do try the fish fry and fingers. I sometimes just binge on them and they are gorgeous. Also the dip with French fries is finger licking good. Drinks are also available. So that's a bonus. And the staff are very polite and have a serving attitude.

Awesome ambiance accompanied with some tasteful music (2nd Floor), which is hard to find in the surrounding area.¬†
This place lacks parking facility during the daytime being in one of the busiest parts of the city. But this place fits in great for dinner, weekends and holidays. This place serves North-Indian, Continental and Select Southeast Asian Cuisine including Chinese. I was there with family and friends, food was awesome and reasonably priced.¬†
Even better they will be serving daily buffet from 21st December 2015, at a reasonable price of 475+taxes with a promise to serve nearly 21 dishes daily.¬†Will be visiting with family soon to taste the buffet.¬†

Wait, welcome drinks are free.. includes 30ml of liquor or a pint of beer/soft drinks.¬†
I could rate it 5.5/5 for "value for Money" - makes you feel great.

Today I went there with my girlfriend and my colleague. I knew this place as I have worked in Dalhousie for quite a long time. The  environment was elegant. the service was top notch. And the food! They serve the best fish in the city, I must say. Their fish finger with tarter sauce can beat any five star any day. And the fish tandoori, chili fish were superb. Only the butter chicken was a bit low. And all this at very reasonable price. Take my word, if you are in Dalhousie for anything, you should pay a visit here.

i agree with mr. bhatia.Very few people are aware of the existence of this restaurant. Even i was not till i joined my fathers office. But the food here is extremely good and very reasonable. We keep ordering for takeaways every now and then.

Location: This place is in one of the lanes of radha bazaar ( on the left if entering from near the church). 

Ambiance: just like any decent, 3 star restaurant.

Tried: 
1. Rajasthani aloo dum- Not on the menu but they make it if you ask them to. Red gravy, mildly spicy and very tasty.

2. Veg. jhaal fraezi : made the way it should be, tastier in winters when they add gobi.

3. cheese cherry pineapple stick: served on crushed ice. makes you happy.

4. Crispy chilli babycorn: quite crispy.

5. Yellow dal tarka: simply delicious.

6. Garlic naan: thin, soft, crispy- a must try.

Pocket pinch: between 250-300/head ( for veg. food,without alcohol).  very reasonable considering the quality of food.  


A place worth visiting, even with family. They have a separate family room.

I am surprised to see that no one has reviewed this superb restaurant, located in one of the busiest heritage business centers of Kolkata, yet. Located at 7, Old Court House Corner, Dalhousie, BBD Bagh in Kolkata, Damur is a fabulous restaurant I discovered near my work place a few months ago. My office colleagues and I planned a lunch party at Damur to celebrate the farewell of one of our colleagues. 

Damur is a complete Chinese and North Indian restaurant with a wide range of preparations available in their menu. As most of the buildings in this area looks like century old heritage buildings, one should not judge its outer appearance. Around 1.00 PM, we reached in front of the restaurant - an old building with the name 'Damur' shining brightly and elegantly. As we stepped inside by opening a small door, the interior decor with soft light simply amazed us. The outer and inner appearance was just contrasting. The doorman welcomed our group and asked us to go upstairs to the second floor. The entire stair case was beautifully decorated. As we reached the second floor, one of the waiters approached towards us and guided us to a table of six. The six of us sat comfortably on our chairs. 

In our group, there was one vegetarian. So, for the appetizer, we ordered two Chicken Sweet Corn Soup and Chicken Thai, one Chicken Noodles Soup and one Mushroom Noodles Soup. These were followed by two plates of Dry Chilli Chicken, one plate of Drums of Heaven and Crispy Chilli Babycorn. With all these superb dishes, we initiated our grand lunch party. As it was a weekday and that also in the afternoon, there was not much crowd in the large dining hall. Most of the tables were empty. As far as I remember, three more tables were occupied other than ours and we enjoyed our privacy. Every preparation was delicious. In the meantime, we placed our orders for the main course and beverages. Each of us opted for Lime Soda Water. And for the main course, we mixed and matched between North Indian and Chinese items. We tried one plate of Mixed Hakka Noddles and Mixed Fried Rice, both without pork, Peas Pulao, Butter Naan, Dal Makhani, Paneer Butter Masala, Garlic Chicken and Szechwan Chicken. 

All the Chinese preparations that we savored were awesome. But truly speaking, I didn't like their Dal Makhani and Butter Naan - probably because I don't prefer those, though others appreciated them. We had a great and memorable lunch party at Damur at an affordable price. After such a lavish and enjoyable meal, the bill came to nearly Rs. 200 per head.
