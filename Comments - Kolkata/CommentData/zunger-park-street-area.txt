Zunger is the nearest place to my office so we order food from here on a regular basis.
But day by day the quality and the quantity both are becoming worse to worst.
So now a days we prefer to have Egg Toast from Footpath rather than having something from this place...
Another thing is they are so late...It's just the opposite building and they deliver so lately...and as I said the quality is becoming horrible...
And they have written here that they open at 9am but they don't... Some of the items from the menu card are not available..
So before you go there please buzz them and ask whether they can make the dish that you want to have or not..
For quick bites yes of course you can go there...

The food just left me gawking at my friends. Turned out to be more Bette than expected, it did the purpose it was meant to fulfill. Lovely food. Just lovely.

Small food joint. Better than average food. Pocket friendly. Ambience could be worked on. Tried Fish Pakora & Pepper Chicken. Taste seemed nice. Overall 3.5/5.

Located near to my ex-school Assembly Of God Church School, Park Street. The joint is not so hygienic. Service is slow. We went for Fish Fry and Chicken & Mayo Sandwich. Overall an average experience.

This place was never in my cards ... but had to visit due one frnd's bday celebration.  Taking first step in... I thought ..hell where m I. .as the ambience is just below average. Very small place. Clumsy u can say. But the moment food came I forgot everything because the food was really tasty.  Too much of quantity. N not at all pocket pinching. Service was also good. So I would come again to this place fr their good food . Small suggestion...they should just work on ambience.  It will pull more crowd and be happening.

Being next to our workplace this has been a lunch hangout for me and my colleagues! What I wish is these people try to get it air conditioned as because of sweltering heat v normally r forced to get d food packedüò†

This place is kind of hidden in plain sight. Ordered two club sandwiches, and sat there thinking that we'd be getting two sandwiches. And then the waiter comes in with two plates each of 4 sandwiches each. Sandwiches were delicious and with every penny. Great place.
