Worst experience ..neither like the food nor the environment üòíüòínot up to the mark .
Ambience is good but it was totally empty .
We ordered bruschetta it tasted so bad after that nachos with twist it was just like nachos in Indiana style with potato and all ..

One of the most happening place in kolkata to party,booze & go crazy amongst the bestest crowd..
Went their twice once to celebrate a friends birthday on a weekday and next with my office colleagues again on a weekday at late night around 12:30 am, but never encountered the entry problem with high cover charges or so..
Really like this place, music that will blow your mind to groove ur best in the dance floor starts from 11pm.
No doubt its an expensive place but at the same time they serve good food,service is also accurately on time and most important the ambience is sover.

Only for members of THEIR category, you will find dozens better places in park street, If a pub or restaurant has any specific norms please do mention anywhere not at your doorstep , such places are a shame for the society.Acting high class but being the stupidest thing .Wish you a happy shut down soon

If you are not in for a very boombastic party experience and just want to make your body Do a silent dance to a music the DJ plays, This is the right place for you. With its rich soothing interiors and a comfortable place to hang around whether alone or with friends along with its rich combinations of mocktails and cocktails along with some other items, this place is a complete package for people who would love a bit of everything.

Welcome to Kolkata! A very, very reputed restaurant cum bar in question here!

We are a group of 7 people - 3 girls, 4 boys! We called them, they said "Open till 2, there is a waiting, come down - ENTRY on SPOT. Cover charge: 2000."

Fair enough! We were prepared to "pay" a cover charge. We reached at 11:15 p.m. 

These beautiful " well dressed, polished" people in the pic (sorry for the poor quality.) looked at us, top to bottom, bottom to top, and said - "You are not allowed."

Ummm...we must be dressed in rags, not upto his mark to visit M Bar and Kitchen, I am sure! To add to that, where did you mention in the call that "Only members are allowed."

So, dear M Bar and Kitchen, wish you all the very best, with your high endedness, your high culture which we fail to match upto! I really don't want to be part of "your restaurant culture where petty drunk people judge your guests. Wish you all the best!

HOPE YOU CLOSE DOWN VERY SOON, and evolve a better place for your customers.

This was put up as my facebook status on 14th July - still have not received an apology from them. I wish there would be a rating lesser than 1.

To write a review you need to get a feel of the ambiance and taste the food, but what happens when you are denied entry just because you are not a "regular" visitor even though you are ready to pay the cover charge per couple for Rs. 2000! Since we were 3 couples and were willing to experience their service, but the staff at the gate denied access, so from this stand point I rate this place horrible...

Quantity of vodka was less and so as quantity of mojito. Experience was really bad cause price was also high.

Rubbish management..when we called they said about charges n al and said we dont promise to give you a table but you will get it if you come here and talk. I confirmed this with him thrice. then we reached they denied us the table n said private party is goin on..so why the hell do u guys pick up calls n talk rubbish when u dnt have anything in your hand..they said 2k for couple and this amount for that but they should first learn to attend their customers n not only run after money..very very poor experience..spoiled the night..bullshit it was..please dont fool people like this..and the most shocking part was after we were denied the table and we tried calling that person he was not picking our calls only. So its a kind request to look after the management.

Went here on a Saturday night expecting good music and food. The ambience is okay. The staff was not very friendly. They were argumentative and non cooperative. The food quality is very okay. The only good thing was the mushroom pizza which they cooked really well. The rest of the things were not that great , specially the babycorn. The drinks were okay too. As t is a place for clubbing, it's supposed to have good music but unfortunately this was not so. The music was slow and didn't match with the crowd. Disappointing experience from a place I've heard so much about.

This place is definitely THE place for letting your hair down and unwinding if you've had a stressful week. One of the most happening nightclubs we have in town and lives up to every word- ambience, music and class. Whenever I've visited it's been jam packed and that definitely portrays the fact that this place is definitely the definition of Kolkata's nightlife.

A place can only be known by the service that they provide, while they were very courteous at the gate, once inside MBar was nothing more than a disappointment. They managed to mess up a simple mocktail like Virgun mojito which they not only served in a whisky glass but tasted below average. Giving them praise where due, penne with artichoke was very good. I am not very fond of white sauce and even I liked it. However service was very poor from not informing us that a particular dish was not available for 45 mins after it was ordered to not being informed of unavailability of a base for the sheesha.

I visited this place with my friend for Easter dinner. And we loved the place. The ambience is good and the price is reasonable than other bars. They asked us to sit in the lounge area which was cozy and cool. There was another sitting space near the bar. May be they have dance floor also. Alcohol is also reasonable. We have ordered Grilled chicken salad and spaghetti bolognaise. The quantity and quality of food was good. The staffs were really courteous. They made our day. 
Thank you

Used to be a good place! It's funny how they behave now with people! I was there recently with some friends. Some more friends from different city came up and these guys blocked them at entrance and asked for 2000 rupees each although all of them were couples. I went to the gate and saw the situation. And chose to leave! I mean common guys! Either you say you have enough guests and can't allow others or allow people to get in. Don't try to act exclusive when there are much better places around!

Dropped on a Saturday evening after going through some rave reviews on T2 & other platforms. However as we dropped in around 8 pm, crowd was thin. In fact when we came out at 10 PM, the situation was the same. Was a bit disheartened. I opted for John Collins - a whiskey based cocktail which was really nice. For Appetizers we took Morocaan Spice Chicken  (see photo), Grilled Basa (see photo), JD's Chicken (similar to Moroccan chicken but marinated with Jack Daniel's Bourbon) & Crispy fried fish. All these were tasty but I liked the Moroccan & JD's Chicken in particular. Left the place with an OK feeling. Maybe we need to drop much later to get in the dancing mood.

Went there in the Christmas evening and could really chill due to its off placing of the main road.
Personally, I am not a fan of loud music. they have loud music. Ambience was avg. 
Even if the quality of food is fine but less in quantity.
They have cool hookah beer offer

Hosted inside the Magma Hose building complex this place is dimly lit with a not so vibrant ambiance. Well decorated with a waterfall running down empty bottles being the bar counter. The place does not see a lot of crowd. Food is good but nothing extraordinary. Cheese and watermelon sliders, Moroccan chicken, seafood siciliana soup and Mr. Porky's chops are my best picks from the menu. They have happy hours with buy one get one from their IMFL menu and they also serve hookah. Price is little on the higher side. Overall a decent place.

Walked in and was greeted by Mr Hemant. 

He said "Happy hours offer has ended" and "we have updated our prices but the new menu is not there - so priced on the bill will be different" 

Not sure how a self respecting restaurant can say something like this (on the price change). Would love if they replied.

Liked the environment  lot


This place is mostly crowded after 10pm on Fridays and Saturdays. 

Live dj is also a nice addition .

A hot shot contender for the top slot.

Drinks are priced ok try mango mist at 175 or isle of jura at 525  or maitai or rob roy.

The best homemade pasta I have ever had. Anyone visiting M Bar should try the Three Mushroom Pappardelle. This is a stuffed mushroom with Pesto sauce and it's really amazing. The amazing bar nibblers are worth a try. The staff is great and would try to cater to you in the best possible way. In case you want to get proper service I would recommend you to visit during Lunch hours. The only negative I would point out would be the day music collection playing, which really sucks.

For the lack of a lower rating, I am forced to give a 1 rating to this place. 

In terms of etiquettes, the staff has none, I am aware that there is a huge crowd that they need to cater to, but I've been to Bangalore, goa, Bombay and even if space isn't there, the staff has the basic decency to talk to people at the least. I am a paying patron who is willing to pay whatever the entry charge is but I will not accept to be treated the way the staff has treated me. It is utterly unacceptable and unfair. 

The reason for denying us entry was based on the fact that once he has said no, it means no but other people, at the same time can enter. I could take the denial for a number of reasons. Maybe it's because I'm from a minority, honestly speaking, I could turn this a number of ways because i don't comprehend the reason for denial. And if there are terms and conditions on the entry, please put up a board which mentions every particular reason as to why entry can be denied.

This is absolutely horrible treatment and I am sorry, I have been the world over and haven't seen this kind of nonsense anywhere in this entire country. I think we as reviewers and as people of the city we shouldn't be taking this treatment as a whole.

The DJ is amazing! People who love to dance to good music would like this place.
One more plus is that you get good hookah out here.

I sort of loved this place. The music and the crowd, both were amazing !! ¬†the sheesha and the drinks were good too :) yes, ¬†the dance floor is definitely small but the party mood that it creates compensates for that and people start dancing near their tables. Would love to visit again :)

Absolute pathetic behavior and shitty rules.

Slippers are not allowed - no wonder the place is deserted even on holidays.

Visited this place yesterday, on the basis of its popularity and recommendation from friends and family.

I will start with the ambience. It is amazing. I like well lit places. And the lights of this place were perfect.

The high chairs were a bit weak and moving, and the seats weren't very comfortable. We asked if we could sit in the inner section which had sofa seats (lounge like) and seemed more comfortable. But we were denied with the reason that there was an ongoing party, even though we couldn't see any guests or hear any music.

We started with ordering beer and had ordered for Budweiser. But we were told that they only had Kingfisher Ultra, Hoegaarden and Corona. The latter 2 being very pricey, we had no other option but to go for Kingfisher. Later we saw some people ordering Budweiser. This left us a bit stunned. Maybe the person taking our order wasn't well aware of what was available and wasn't.

Next we ordered a veg peri peri pizza, which took some 15 minutes to come but was worth the wait. It was thin crust and was very delectable.

After that we ordered LIITs and 100 Piper's, each of them had 1:1 offer during the Happy hours. We had ordered for Jameson's first, but then again, they did not have it. This was quiet disappointing. The LIITs were okayish.

And then we ended with having tequila shots. We ordered for Jose Cuervo Reposado. But once again, they did not have it. They suggested us lanka something instead, which was of the same price bracket, although it was not mentioned in their menu card. Much to our disappointment, it was the worst tequila we had ever tasted. In fact it didn't taste like it at all.

Then the check came. It cost us some good 4k bucks. Though the price for the quantity was justified, the quality and service wasn't. While we were exiting, the inner room's gate was still open and still no guest had arrived. And lastly, even after drinking so much and so diverse types of liquor, it did not hit a single one of us. :/

Conclusion: I won't recommend it to anyone who likes to drink at good gastrobars. There are a lot of good options in the city than this for similar price, better quality and better service.

FINAL VERDICT-

Quality- 2/5

Service- 1/5

Ambience and Interiors- 4/5

Affordability- 2.5/5

On the Whole- 2/5

Hi My husband hosted my birthday surprise last Friday 16th September 2016.

The place is awesome, loved the ambience and deco the seating the light setting and the mostly love the English number latest and  old school these days all the places play only Hindi music love the idea of Hindi music after 12 so all are happy.

The food was great especially I liked their own version on Aljilo mushroom and prawn.

However all my experiences went in vain as the staff whole mop the floors and guys who clear the tables or bring food to the tables and the tables around kept brushing against me and by friends time and time again which was disgusting and really no accident but purposely it was gross my friends also noticed the Same and bought it to my attention when it happened to me I thought i must be overreacting.

Which high standard Mr Shaun has created his place and i think he should know and do something about it as the place is new but if must ppl experience this then they way they screen and only allow certain genre of crowd to come to M Bar doesn't make sense if the ppl working their as off now standard.

Also the bartenders across our table which was on the right side of the private party room they made a group in the bar and was checking out the girls abs commenting about them.

Would I go to MBar no would i recommend my friend NO

Sorry about the feedback this is not any competition stunt please feel to contact me.

Had a lovely time this Saturday...let me quickly go thru the likes and dislikes...
Likes:
Great ambience...the lounge area is awesome...good music...nice seating arrangement.
Nice collection of drinks..had a mojito...very well made.
Hookah was superb!
Dislikes:
Impromptu staff...very confused.
Food proportions are really small.
Taste of food should be better...moroccon chicken was not up to the mark...although the mutton peri peri pizza was well made.
In short, please upgrade ur services n quantity along with taste a lot...this place has all the potential to become one of the nicest places to hang out with friends in Kolkata.

Go there and have just the chocolate baklava and you will come out satiated! All chocolate cravings met in one visit. The ambience is like any other lounge, service could be better. One disappointment was the DJ. Pretty sad. But the food all in all is good. Not out of the world but good. But yes, please, keep space (loads) for chocolate baklava.

WORST BAR IN ALL OF KOLKATA! I will never go here. It's not worth the drive around to the crappy parking lot to get inside this tiny and terrible place. Their door attendants on a Friday night are rude and probably stealing money from them as they wanted to charge 2,000 ruppees a person to get in which is ridiculous for a small and inadequate place like M Bar I'm the middle of Kolkata. I am trying every single one of my friends to NEVER go to this place. I think it's only a matter of time before a place as crooked as this fails from lack of ability to properly run a business.  There are much nicer places to go to in Kolkata that have friendly staff, better music, better food, better space. If you're looking for a good place to go to try Bodega it's around the corner or Park hotel or The Grid or Myxx.

This is shameful and ridiculous. In what world does it cost 6000 Rs. for 4 ppl to get into a club? This place is completely and totally dishonest. Two friends from the US and I came to get in and they tried to cheat us out of money. I hope the owner and manager see this and know that their doormen are being dishonest and turning away customers. Peace mBar!! ‚úå

We've been there a few times and the place is just okay. Tonight we went there and they tried to charge me 6000rs to get in for a cover charge. The guy was obviously trying to rip me off and pocket the money. This palace is dishonest and not even that nice. They should be ashamed of the way they treat their customers. I hope the owner of M bar sees this and realizes his staff is stealing money from him and pissing off customers.

Been there a week before. The area being inside a narrow lane does not calls for a good crowd. I went on a weekday and there were no proper music being played even though there was a place for dj. Coming to the food.. It was however good . I ordered mango mist, blue lagoon, asian blasted basa, pasta with white sauce and garlic chicken popcorn. Ambience s quite good. Since i went for my cousin's hens party we were expecting crowd. Otherwise people can hit a visit.

I visited this place at lunchtime and was really happy with the decor. Their bar area looks amazing. I expected the food to be great but it did not meet my expectations fully.
I had the asparagus risotto and the veg peri peri pizza.
The risotto was good but I somehow felt that the quantity was a little less.
The veg peri peri pizza is for those who like their pizzas spicy.However for me it was way too spicy.
Another issue I encountered was the low number of staff. Maybe because it wasn't the peak time for the restaurant or maybe due to some other reasons there was only one person at the bar and two for the dining and the lounge area. We had to find people to take the order and bring the bill.
They have a separate lounge area as well.

Flavored foam, jellified pasta, whiskey spheres, edible ribbons. Yes, this is new age fusion food at its best and if you thought Kolkata is too conservative to have any of these in the menu of a restaurant, you are so wrong! M Bar Kitchen, the sprawling 4,200 sq ft gastropub in Park Street takes food art very seriously and has¬†introduced a whole range of dishes using the technique of molecular gastronomy. I was invited by M Bar Kitchen to experience the food created by the very talented young chef Tania and I was impressed.

The moment you get in here, you would notice the lovely ambiance of it. 

You would love the decor and the crowd. But the moment your orders start coming, it would keep you disappointed.

Had ordered asparagus risotto, pizza, onion rings, mix sauce and white sauce pasta, and mocktails. 

Asparagus risotto tasted like the typical DALIYA. Very bad! 

Pizza was upto the mark.

The pasta of both the sauces were not properly cooked. Mix sauce pasta was left uneaten but the white sauce pasta tasted okayish. There were no veggies in both the pasta's. 

Onion rings were good. 

Coming to the mocktails, we liked all of them excepting a particular kiwi based mocktail. It wasn't good at all. 

A good place if you go for clubbing with a full stomach and if you wish not to eat.

Flavored foam, jellified pasta, whiskey spheres, edible ribbons. Yes, this is new age fusion food at its best and if you thought Kolkata is too conservative to have any of these in the menu of a restaurant, you are so wrong! M Bar Kitchen, the sprawling 4,200 sq ft gastropub in Park Street takes food art very seriously and has¬†introduced a whole range of dishes using the technique of molecular gastronomy. I was invited by M Bar Kitchen to experience the food created by the very talented young chef Tania and I was impressed.

The moment you get in here, you would notice the lovely ambiance of it. 

You would love the decor and the crowd. But the moment your orders start coming, it would keep you disappointed.

Had ordered asparagus risotto, pizza, onion rings, mix sauce and white sauce pasta, and mocktails. 

Asparagus risotto tasted like the typical DALIYA. Very bad! 

Pizza was upto the mark.

The pasta of both the sauces were not properly cooked. Mix sauce pasta was left uneaten but the white sauce pasta tasted okayish. There were no veggies in both the pasta's.

Located in the heart of Park Street, this lounge is an absolute disappointment. Going by the review, had short-listed this place on a Saturday evening !! The experience is worse than that of being disappointed.

Where should I start. The hookah, well, was that a hookah at all. the flavour mint was nowhere close to that. To be honest, hardly did I get any flavour at all. Moving on to the drinks, be it the martini or the liqueur. Ordered for Black Russian but they didn't have it. Then changed it to something with Bailey's, they didn't have that as well.

Well, the only good thing is the Calamari and that is all. If possible I will give it an absolute 0.

Wow... That's what i exclaimed when i entered the place. Superb interiors, very courteous staff and an amazing DJ is all you need to chill after a long hectic week. Starters are really innovative and has a lot to offer. To be honest i was a bit buzzed but still i remember having a gala time. Hookah is also very well prepared and happy hours save you the pocket pinch. Crowd filtering isn't done at the entrance but still the crowd is usually very good.

NB : They have a separate smoking zone so non-smokers are at complete ease.

Have been wanting to visit this place for so long.. Got a perfect oppurtunity today on the occasion of a friend's birthday! Service was prompt and there was no crowd which was surprising.. Ordered Jim Beam Black & 100 pipers taking advantage of the happy hours. For the main course chose Cheese Steak with Peprica Rice n sauce. Food was okayish
 Could have been better..but the vibes was real good. Music was good but it got exciting when we started to leave around 4 .. Was hoping it would have been better!

Having visited this place quiet a few times for clubbing I decided to give it a try one of these afternoons. They don't let you drive up to the gate during afternoons so you gotta walk quiet a bit. We reached and were guided to our seats well. This is the first time I noticed a restaurant reluctant on serving regular water. We called for pesto sauce risotto, the sauce had turned bitter but was still served to us. Then a grilled chicken salad and with real hard prices of chicken in it. Very sad food... My 2.5 ratings are for the times I enjoyed clubbing here :)

One of the Best nightclubs in the city and a Restro Bar in Daytime, awesome interiors, nice ambience, good crowd, the food tastes great, and a big plus is the music in this place and another specialty is the international djs they get on Fridays, this place gives the value for your money.

The place is nice,rather i do fancy their bar and stuffs. The food was good. i would have given 4.5/5 but their service is horrible. I ordered something from the bar the only positive answer that i got in return was "sir we dont have this brand" and last but not the least I had to shuffle and finally decided to order something where as they served something else which they didnt even bothered to let me know that too off different brand which I came to know when I was about to pay the check. Its really not about the price ,the problem is #1 One follows few brands #2 you really need to ask before serving . I am rating 3.0 only for their food and decor or else contrary to their service its 1.0 from me. Thank you

The decor is funky for sure, right in the heart of Park Street! The food menu is surely interesting and the drinks menu is extensive! 
We went there on a weekday evening, the place was completely empty, had to ask for directions but it's easy to locate, right opposite Park Street post office inside Magma Complex, staff is courteous but funny thing was they allowed free parking only after 7 pm, since we arrived around 6:00 pm had to find parking in busy Park Street which took some time. 
Now coming to the food, didn't have any main course but ordered for some starters like popcorn chicken, cheese and watermelon slider and a crispy baby corn in Cola flavour ( can't remember the exact name! ) but all the dishes were great and nice to munch on especially the cheese and watermelon sliders were bursting with flavours and very refreshing. 
Happy Hour was going on, so that was an added bonus for us, their drink menu is pretty varied. Nice place to chill out with your friends and colleagues, but the day we visited it was eerily quiet and empty, didn't get a very happy vibe that day, even the staff was busy watching some sports all huddled together. The seats which were provided to us was a little uncomfortable small little sofas ( don't understand these kind of furniture where it's difficult to sit properly ) 
The smoking zone is separate which is again an added advantage! 
Good place to hang around! Would surely recommend this one to people!

Location : Beside the Magma Complex.

We visited this place on a fine Saturday evening to celebrate a friend‚Äôs birthday. It was a last minute plan and we didn‚Äôt have a booking. But when we reached there, found the place to be empty. The outlet has a rocking ambience. There is full-fledged bar which has a nicely lit cabinet to compliment the d√©cor and lighting of the entire outlet.

Now coming to food we had, which was no less than any other fine-dine restaurant in the city :-

‚òÖ	Funghi Risotto : It was very pleasantly prepared. Excellent taste of mushrooms complimented with porcini. Overall nice.

‚òÖ	Basilico Sauce Pasta : We had this pasta with white sauce. Again the dish was savoury having proper flavours. The sauce was creamy to the optimal level.

‚òÖ	Mad About Mushrooms : The best mushroom variant pizza I have had in town. The crust was evenly baked with absolute amount of cheesy layer.

‚òÖ	John Collins : It is a whiskey based cocktail. It is a variation of Tom Collins which is prepared with a Gin base. The sourness of whiskey was effectively subdued by the lemon juice. Fine presentation as well.

‚òÖ	Virgin Mojito : The classic mocktail, prepared true to its nature. The apt amount of sweetness refreshed with mint and ice.

We also ordered a hookah which was exceptional. The smoke was super dense and had an abundance of flavours. Also had couple beers.

The service is also pretty swift. The staff understand the orders well without any hassle. I have heard, the place becomes more lively after 10pm when the Dj drops his beats and certain tables are cleared out to make way for the dance floor. Pocket pinch for the above was around 3k which is really reasonable. An amazing place for hangouts.

Had heard of the place on my feed and a Saturday lunch was a perfect opportunity. Well first word of caution. This place is actually inside magma complex and the map location to it from zomato seems to be incorrect. Do cross check with Google. It has nice ambience and we parked ourselves at the lounge.
Food gets a 4.0 and they have a well stocked bar. Needs brushing up on its prices as for the quantity seemed a little high. But never the less, a good place to try out.

Located just beside bar-b-q nation but inside an old lane ,on the ground floor of a shabby old building . That gives you an odd feeling on entry . But one can skip that considering something great inside . But that's also not very pertinent ,as food was costly but not that great ,only popchick was something to boast about. Drinks menu was also very limited which was a surprise . Decor was minimal inside . service wise they tried hard but due to lack of experience or menu ,it was not that great as well. Overall not that great , u can skip this one considering the location its in ,there are many greats nearby.
Mbar improve your menu,decor,service to keep up in the competition.

How amazing is this new addition to the city's night scene. There's nothing that really stands out about the decor. The regular night club sort. However, the music they play is probably the best in the city. You just cannot stand in a corner with your drink. You gotta hit the dance floor which explains why this place is jampacked most of the time.

M Bar Kitchen has been on my wishlist for quite a long time. As the Gastropub culture is slowly building up with many places highlighting molecular gastronomy, M Bar Kitchen is doing the same too. This place could be a little bit puzzling to find for those people who don't visit Park Street frequently. It is present just at the ground floor of the Magma House near the Marco Polo and The Myx. The entrance of M Bar Kitchen don't do the justice about the interiors. Once you enter this place, you will find this place is huge with loads of seating arrangements to make yourself comfortable with. Although when me and my girlfriend entered this place I was guided by a staff to a separate large room. I reapeat, the seating arrangements are quite good with funky lights and decorations all around he walls and ceilings. Loved the interiors. We went there in the mid-day and therefore found the place to be quite empty.
‚Ä¢
What I found while ordering the food was that their menu has been revamped a bit from what Zomato is showing to its users.
‚Ä¢
Atfirst we ordered a mocktail, a Kiwi slush and a starter comprising Soft Shell Tacos.
‚Ä¢
0-Proof M Special Mocktail - A fusion drink with a strong and spicy punch. Their house special mocktail was presented uniquely in a round pot with lots of ices in it. It is a pomegranate based drink with infused ginger. Really refreshing and punchy mocktail I would say.
‚Ä¢
The Kiwi Frappe is a slushy mocktail which has all the health benefits of a fresh tangy kiwi fruit, along with a creamy consistency, due to its rich kiwi flesh. The beautiful light green colour of this mocktail was enticingly refreshing too.
‚Ä¢
Service was pretty good too with everything arriving within 5-10 minutes. Impressive.
‚Ä¢
Then came the Soft Shell Tacos. These soft shell Tacos are ultra delicious, seasoned with juicy and tender chicken and topped with cheese, lettuce, sour cream. Mouth-watering is the only word coming to my mind while remembering these delightful starters. Really loved them.
‚Ä¢
We were still hungry enough and I wanted to try out the Panini. The staff told me to try put their minced Mutton Panini. So therefore we tried out the Spicy Minced Panini. Among each and everything we had at the M Bar kitchen this was the yummiest of the lot. An Italian sandwich made with Italian bread. The Panini was so good, a bite of it and I was lost into the juiciness of the mutton and the crusty upper layers. The minced mutton inside was perfectly cooked with all the ingredients. Definitely worth every penny!
‚Ä¢
Time to try out some of their desserts now and I ordered Sincere Symphony. This dessert has Chocolate. Chocolate everywhere with a taste of orange in it. This devilish looking dense and dark dessert was a combination of chocolate & orange is not new to us. Fact is that, I don't like the combination of chocolate and orange that much, neither do my girlfriend. But it was good and would be rejoice for die hard chocolate lovers.
‚Ä¢
What came next was something I am still craving for as I write this. Chocolate Baklava. I'm sure anyone who will try this will love it. The taste of this classic Mediterranean dessert is simply outstanding. It was known as the Chocolate Heaven in the old menu card of M Bar Kitchen. This is a serious chocoholic's dream. Presented in shots glasses dipped in chocolate sauce, the sticks or the Baklava have a creamy delicious centre with a delicate phyllo outer covering. Lovely.
‚Ä¢
M Bar Kitchen is a nice Gastropub and lounge in Park Street, serving some lip-smacking food and drinks with great ambiance. The interiors are huge and nicely put up. Lots and lots of space for huge groups of people to have a nice time. Personally what I didn't like was the pricing of some of their desserts and drinks which a bit expensive to what you get. But what you get is absolutely delicious. I would definitely go back to M Bar Kitchen in the future someday again.

This place is not as posh as it will appear. But it is certainly expensive.
Food is not amazing, but the pizzas are good.
One visit is worthwhile, but make sure you have enough on you, because the pinch in the pocket will be hard.
The decor inside is pretty much fabulous.
p.s. Avoid wearing slippers if you do not want to be stared at by the receptionist and the gatekeeper while entering.

Situated amidst the oldest and most renowned eateries of Kolkata in Park Street area, this place boasts of amazing ambiance and great food. 
My first and only visit to this place has been one of the best experiences ever, and here is why: 
The mood, the interiors, the setting and everything are completely youth centred. It gives a nice peppy feeling as soon as you enter and are escorted to your seat. 
The food, is very good too. We had ordered 007 peppers which is a chef's choice for starter, a double decker pizza, lasagna, gratin and a few more of these sorts. Mindblown by all of them.
There is also a dance floor, complete with a DJ,l; you can dance away to glory for as long as you want; or just sway to the beats from your own tables. 
Amazing experience. Definitely going back.

Good place! The first thing I liked about this place after stepping in was the vibrancy of the place. A classy lounge and a cool bar just compliments the elegantly done interiors. They play newly trending and popular music as well.
The food tastes good and its also plated nicely for presentation. The drinks won't make you regret either, well the cocktails are worth trying though most of them are conventional ones but prepared to perfection.
The service is passable, I just wish the servers were a bit more enlightened about the menu.
The pricing is decent. Better to visit during happy hours if you want it to be lighter on your pocket pinch.
Overall its a beautiful Gastropub and I will be repeating this place again sooner or later.

My wife and me decided to go to M bar and kitchen, as we heard a lot about this place. We reached there at 9 on a Saturday and to our surprise the door staff said that entry for regulars only. We asked the person how do you become regular if you don't allow someone inside? He had no answer and just said Friday & Saturday only regulars are allowed. We asked him to take a entry charge which was redeemable, but still he said no. It was not that i was alone as a stag, i was there with my wife but still they did not allow us in. It was a very sad experience for us and was something we experience for the first time.  So people only if you are a regular or know someone from the management, then only come here or else you will be send back too.

M Bar Kitchen located inside Magma House Complex opposite to Park Street Post Office offers a taste of global cuisine..Definitely one of the coolest Gastropubs in the City this place stocks an extensive bar, some of the unique and expereimental dishes you will come across in a gastropub in the city and a new sense to partying..What impressed me most about this place is definitely the decor and ambience of this place..The interior is literally huge and can't be estimated from the outside..They have 2 areas, A LOUNGE area and a PRIVATE DINE-IN area..The decors are beautifully done with a dominance of BLUE colour,classy, comfortable, apt lighting to go with the theme, huge LED tv screening live matches and a floor with some cool music being played..The servers are extremely attentive, may be we went on a lazy afternoon, nevertheless they are knowledgeable about the menu and suggests us just us the perfect dishes to suit our palate..The food and beverages we ordered:
Long Island Iced Tea: Served in Pitchers..the blend was just perfect..what was more delightful on our request the Bar-tender made the drink extra strong..
Garlic Chicken Popcorn: A perfect accompaniment for our drinks..the portion was generous enough..the popcorns were crispy and tender, while the sauce was tangy, a bit sweet going well with garlic flavour..
Spiced Basa with Lemon Chilly Sauce: Again on our special request the chef made the sauce a bit more hot than the usual one..The fish was grilled perfectly..loved the freshness of the dish..would have been a better dish if made with beckti..
Bourbon Laced Chicken: Wow..that was our first expression after having this.. Spiced Chicken skewers roasted to perfection and seasoned with bourbon to add that extra kick to the dish..indeed a unique deviation from the common skewers we have everywhere else and the minty,soury yoghurt dip added an extra flavour to the whole dish..overall inspirational and recommended..
Spaghetti Bolognese: The portion was generous enough to be shared among 3 people..The good old comfort food for our group and a perfect dish to fill the tummy after loaded with a few drinks..the sauce was meaty, it was tangy, it was sweet, it was hot,overall a perfect balance alongwith the flavours of tomato hitting your tongue distinctly..surely the chef has cooked this dish million times..
Chocolate Hazzlenut Cheesecake: It was my friend's birthday and they were courteous enough to put on a candle with a greeting message written in cream to make it special for our friend..As far as the taste is concerned yet again it was just perfect..the concentration was nice..the cheesecake was well baked..only thing I felt it could have been a bit bitter with a hint of more dark chocolate..but nonetheless no scope to complain..
Alongwith it we ordered a few Beer to wrap up our perfect lunch outing..Also notable is the amount of calorie tagged with each dish mentioned in the menu card helping to make your oreder more informed..The prices are definitely on the higher side but given the service, ambience and the quality and authenticity of the Food being served here, its worth every penny and me definitely going back soon..Overall our total cheque comes to Rs.6600/- approx (incl tax) for 3 people..

I went there on my birthday. Treat from RV. As we enter it seems to have a bar with an attach restaurant too, it also have shisha, which has in separate room. At night it too changes to night life as in club. Place is amazing. I had just tried spinach ricotta tortellini in food. I had ordered for shisha, as well as in drinks cosmopolitan, white rum Mojito, and rainbow which consist of 7 different flavors in tequila or vodka. All its drinks were good enough. I visited on happy hours so some of the drinks we got 1:1. 
Highly recommended.
Cheers!

A little heads up- the review is going to be a tad bit long, I spent around 4 hrs at this place, that too on a dry day. Strange? Well it was a friend's birthday and we were a big gang. 
The place is located conveniently inside the magma house premises on park Street, near Marco Polo!
The place is done up beautifully, spacious, long chairs and tables, superb bar, a private area for groups. Loved the interiors! If you are planning to have a quick bite and leave, this is not the place for you. Go only if you have a lot of time to spare, drink, smoke, eat, talk and a big pocket to dig hole in.
We ordered for a lot of things, and that is why the review is going to be long but helpful nonetheless.
I think the food here is very over priced and over rated for the quality they serve. As far as the presentation is concerned, it was nice, just one thing that's very weird. Every food item was garnished with chocolate sauce on the side.
What we ordered-
1. Mixed sauce penne pasta- decent, full of exotic vegetables, the sauce could've been better. The pasta was not how its supposed to be, it was way undercooked. Not worth the price at all. 425+ taxes!
2. Penne pasta with artichoke in white sauce- loved the sauce, the exotic vegetables, and the prominent flavour of basil in the sauce. Here again, the pasta was undercooked which did not allow the sauce to coat the pasta properly, therefore giving a bland taste in some bites. Just this one problem, else good!
3) Thin crust pizza- the pizza was good, decent amount of mozarella, to compliment the goodness of exotic vegetables! Crispy!
4) Pesto risotto- I haven't had a worse risotto than this in a long time. The sauce was still OK, but the arborio was raw, literally raw. Like there is something called cooked, something called undercooked and then there is "raw".
5) Asparagus risotto- The same issue!
6) Spicy bean burger- It might be good for some people, did not work for me though. The bun was hard, toasted on both sides, very dry, lacked vegetables. Rs 325+ taxes for such a horrible burger hurt bad!
7) Falafel burger- the Patty tasted good, but the other issues were the same as with the spicy bean burger.
8) Mr Bean quesadilla- it was horrible. First, the tortilla was not cooked, the stuffing tasted bland and was too dry. No taste there at all. It's pretty hard to screw a dish as simple as quesadilla. We asked for sour cream along with it and we got a bowl of hung curd like thing. The only good thing about the dish was the salsa. The salad was stale too. 
9) Crispy chilly babycorn- the portion size was very less. The picture attached is of the entire serving and not just a single serving. So don't get confused. Did not like it at all, none of us did. Lacked a lot of things, lacked garlic, lacked chillies. Overall, not satisfactory at all.
9. Garlic bread with cheese- where was the cheese? And where was the garlic? Don't get deceived by the picture. It looked delicious and tasted horrible. Super bland, saltless, no garlic. I mean, how can such a basic dish at  such a classy place be so bad? 
10) Basil soup- one of the few things I liked. It was blissful. So flavourful. They totally nailed it!
11) Virgin mojito- very refreshing and tasteful. Couldn't stop at one.  Though a little too sweet, but still good!
12) The house's special mocktail with pomegranate juice as the base, infused with ginger. It was presented beautifully and tasted different. It was refreshing. Pretty good it was.
13) Watermelon sliders- Most of the people from our group did not like it. I loved it though. Refreshing. Cheese stuffed between two small cubes of chilled watermelons. Amazing work chef! Simple..subtle and classy!
14) Blueberry cheesecake- it was good, but I've had better.
The sheesha was a disappointment. Did not last long. Every time we got the coal changed, it came back only worse, with much less smoke!
Making a place look classy does'nt necessarily make the quality of food good, neither does charging exorbitantly and placing fancy words and descriptions on the menu.
Please take care of the quality of food, and you have a beautiful place in a wonderful location to make you go places! 
I won't recommend this place if you are in the mood for good food, however you should go for drinks and good music. Enjoy the ambiance, its pretty good. Watch yourself get poorer!
P.s: this review is totally unbiassed and entirely based on my personal experience!

The ambience is great, especially the bar counter, service is upto the mark as well. As usual the names of the dishes demand you to learn italian language in your kinder garden. Lolz...

Very good environment. Very hot looking dj girl with poor performance, playing Bollywood number all the time.  Menu is too costly as per the kolkata standard. And here is the main point, we went there and did not able to explore dancefloor and few places as some people's were there, as they booked for party, so why management opens for other ????? It was just disgusting experience...... Kitchen closing time is 12 and they refused to took order at 11:20pm . dear management guys show some professionalism....I was there with my foreigner friend, and u guys embarrassed me.

There's bad service, there's terrible service and then there's the service at M Bar. I went there on Friday night with 5 of my colleagues at around 9.30. They made us sit at a table (which had no reserved sign by the way), took our order, served us and only after an hour decided to inform us that this table was reserved and we would have to either vacate or pay a cover charge of 35000. And by informed I mean that their manager - the extremely affable Mr. Swaraj Bhowmick came and told us "I order you to leave".  Subsequently, when we demanded an apology before paying the bill, we were harassed, insulted and physically threatened for more than two hours. I won't even go into the details of the food or the ambience at this place because no number of fancy cooks or a great DJ can redeem the poor quality of service here. So if this is your idea of Friday night fun, do pay this place a visit. Trust me, it will be a night to remember but not in a very positive way.

And by informed I mean the manager Mr.  Swaraj Bhowmick came and told us "I order you to leave". I won't even go into the details of the food or drinks because in a place where the service is this poor, no fancy cook or DJ can redeem you.

Not a bad place actually - go at your own risk. You might just get insulted by the management and ruin your evening. 

A couple of friends went there on a Friday, and were asked to leave unceremoniously since our table was reserved. All we expected was a polite request, and instead got a really rude instruction from the manager. Seriously, could do better with some humility.

Been there 6 times. Amazing experience always. Straight from the door desk to the staff, everyone is polite and jolly.
The ambience is a cherry on the cake.

When it comes to food, every dish there is a treat to your taste buds. Don't miss out on the asian arancini.
Do try the kiwi frappe, chatka merry from the mocktail section.
Also try the apple cobbler from the dessert section.
To sum up, you can't miss this amazing place at all. Be here once, you'll forget other lounges to be honest.
Kudos! :)

M Bar Kitchen is the latest gastropub tht has opened in park street.. The plc offers a sophisticated and a classy ambience along with good food and good music.. The interiors are done up really well and the seating arrangemnts are great too.. This is one fine plc where you can get creatively made cocktails.. The service and the staff is upto the mark too.. The music out here is fantabulous.. Coming to the food, as we were not much hungry we opted for Pulled chicken burger, kiwi frappe, malta punch and chocolate baklava for dessert.. Kiwi Frappe was one of the bestest mocktail that i have ever had..the pulled chicken burgers were the 3 mini burgers served with french fries and a ketch up which was too spicy.. Malta punch was okayish though.. The star item of the day was none other than chocolate baklava.. Chocolate stuffed cigar coated with nuts and served with a rich chocolate ganache..it was simply outstanding.. Wud definitely recommend ppl to cum and visit the plc!!

The city has barely half a dozen hotspots and this is a new addition. Bit tough to find but convenient as well given the easy availability of parking. Has a bar area and a lounge as well and we parked ourselves in the lounge. Nice looking place and seemed to be quite busy as we entered at 2100 but surprisingly emptied out by 2200! Possibly a lot of people come for the happy hours that end at 2000. Decent food but really crappy inane music.

Hidden inside Magma House and a hoarding barely noticeable,this is the lastest "pub" added in the party-hoppers' destination at Kolkata's most popular eat-drink-make-merry spot-Park Street. Good lighting,a separate lounge area,good collection of spirits,music- overall had a good time. Way to go..just a little more publicity and the next time I might fail to find a place!!

Can't say about the inside part because the entry was handled by Mr. Souraj, who claims to be the manager, doesn't allow my team, my manager and his wife. My manager and his wife went there at first and at the gate he was told that his name isn't on the guest list without  asking the name to my manager. More... a month back Mr. Souraj did it to me and my friend, I was stopped at the gate because of my friend's improper dress code, I would like to say he was wearing white shirt, black trouser and black shoe. Isn't that a proper dress to enter a pub? I was astonished to the manager of M Bar, even suggested me to come on next day, oh god, I was in deep trauma when they did it to my manager with his foreigner wife, as I was the person to suggest him the M-Bar. for sure after yesterday's event I will never visit, and will  not recommend to anyone.
At last, being a hotelier we didn't find any reason of what the manager of MBar said... Anyhow it's not the part of hospitality...

Finding the restaurant was a tad bit difficult.
The first two drinks my friends ordered they didn't have that so they finally had to settle for a usual Heineken which was disappointing since they wanted to experiment.
Table booking is highly recommended
The DJ doesn't start before 10:30 which again was not something we were expecting and it was again disappointing.
In food,we ordered
Chicken Popcorn -- delicious and spicy
Spaghetti caranora -- delicious
Pork chop -- average(iv had better)
Chicken with works -- good
In drinks we ordered
I bottle of Heineken -- disappointing
Gandhoraj basil mohito -- was very seriously sour. When we told them they gave a shot glass full of sweet water which helped

The service was slow. We waited almost 20mins for main course. Our server was good but when he went out the others were just lame and couldn't process requests at all apart from 'Bill please'
Overall though the food was really impressive other things really let down our expectations from this place.

I had not visited M Bar because I barely drink and somehow I did not have much expectation with the food as I thought the focus would be more on the Drinks and Music with some Finger Food , however I was very wrong and happy to state on record that I ate some really good food there far above my expectations.

The Team at M Bar Kitchen headed by Chef  Tania Ghosh served up some delicious dishes and cocktails. I was also pleasantly surprised by their FOOD ART Menu which comprises of a selection of Molecular Gastronomy dishes and was impressed with the taste and plating. For me Food is recreation and fun and a great way to chill out and unwind and this particular section of the menu underlines that. It is indeed heartening to see the Culinary scene in our City develop in this direction not to mention great fun.
Now more about our meal there - the starters were -¬†

Edible ribbons - basil and arrabiata spaghetti served individually topped with parmesan/basil foam respectively and garlic dust  - beautiful plating and delicate flavors the food looks so different that its like playing hide and seek with your tastebuds.

Beer battered onion rings with garlic aioli - an old favorite that I am always happy to order and goes well with drinks.

Soft shell tacos ‚Äì potato and kidney beans served with home made tomato salsa - loved them and really liked the potato one - great option for the vegetarians there and goes great with your drinks

Italian pappad - called a panne originally, a thin crispy home made bread topped with chopped charred onion/jalapenos/black olives/basil/ garlic infused oil and baked ) - delightfully tasty - this is a great thing to munch on and am quite sure it would please almost everyone who has it.

Gamberi al ajillo - prawns tossed in extra virgin olive oil/garlic/white wine and a hint of chilli flakes served with a raisin compote - deceptively simple but lovely subtle flavors.

Along with the delicious starters we had some unique and heady cocktails - Molecular mojito spheres 
- the classic mojito cocktail served as a sphere complete with a mint leaf - absolutely lovely and even someone like me who barely drinks was tempted to indulge - if you like your Mojitos and want something that is fun, stylish and a conversation starter this one id for you.

Caol Ila spheres - Caol ila whisky with a hint of peach served as a sphere - stunning both the presentation and the flavor - a sure winner with the ladies and once in fr all will stamp out the myth that Whiskey is not a ladies drink the lovely fruity flavor of peach  blends perfectly with the smoky sweetness of the Caol ila Whisky which is a very good Single Malt Scotch.

Deconstructed tequila  - a shot of tequila, lemon sphere and salt foam - took me back to my parting days for obvious reasons ;-) 

Fantastic four - vodka, gin, martini rosso with lime juice and sugar syrup infused with smoke - truly fantastic and not to be missed.

Our Main Course followed with rustic , hearty Italian flavors which I really enjoyed -

Potato parmigiana -  layers of sliced roasted potato and vegetables on top of creamy cheese risotto served with roasted red pepper and garlic coulis - absolutely delicious and I would definitely order this on my next visit.

Pesto bake - pesto flavored vegetable gratin topped with cheese and baked, served with chunky garlic flavored bread - yummy stuff loved the chunky garlic bread which was perfect to soak up the pesto gratin sauce.

Smoked pizza - chicken and chilli pizza with an egg that‚Äôs smoked and baked - very good , lots of toppings and I loved the egg on it  

Little purses - home made chicken tortellini topped with truffle air - perfectly cooked tortellini's but I personally would have loved a bit more truffle flavoring .... would have given it a better definition of flavors.

By now we were totally stuffed up but being a chocolate lover I could not overlook the temptation of dessert - 

¬†Chocoholic¬†-  layered dessert of nutella dust, praline, chocolate mousse topped with orange-mango sphere - droolworthy indeed and loved the way the citrus taste of the mango-orange balanced the denser chocolate components of the dish.

Chocolate baklava - chocolate stuffed cigars coated with nuts and served with a rich chocolate ganache - sinful ..... however would have liked pistachio to be used rather than other nuts as that is the taste of baklava ..... chocolate ganache was super yum and ought our meal to a great close.

I have to confess that writing about our delicious meal has made me want to relive it and I shall make a visit back soon .... much more I want to try .... until then my thanks to the management for inviting me for such a delightful meal or else I would have missed out on some great food. Plus a special shout out for the service and wonderful ambiance with its delightful little quirks that I shall leave you to discover. If you like your Cocktails , Great Music courtesy DJ Girish and some excellent food M Bar & Kitchen is where you should head !

Frankly, music and location being its only attractions for me at least. Outlook of the plc too average ti be the best pub in town! Quality of servings good though. Found the huka really good. Rates are proportional to scale of the plc. Fooding is okay and normal like any kther good hangout. Outlook improvement should do the trick. Cheers!

This review has been overdue some time and could not help but finally pen it down. Well after having read quite a few reviews am not surprised with the management of this place. We decided to check out this place out after work on a Tuesday evening. By way of abundant caution we called to check in case a reservation was required. The manager on the phone assured us that no reservations would be required, however when we reached the place at 9:40 pm were told we could not be allowed in as we needed invites. On countering the manager and telling him that we checked prior to coming to avoid exactly such a situation and were told by him specifically that reservations would not be required, the tone changed and he informed us that invites are required to enter post 10. Once again we brought to his attention that it was only 9:45 pm, but seeing his reluctance we decided that there were far better places in Calcutta that we could visit and decided to leave. Honestly, invites required to dine at a restaurant, wonder who distributes the invites, especially when it is not even a global chain or a michellin starred property. Wonder how the owners can bear to put up loosing customers and leave it to the whims and fancies of a manager who stands all evening long at the gate and is probably not even a college graduate with any qualifications whatsoever to judge clientele. If you are cooking up reasons ensure that atleast the excuses sound more genuine rather than "an invite is needed to enter". Would definitely never recommend this place to anyone.

Really unfriendly and rude staff. Not at all customer friendly. Used to be a good place but with the sudden change in management and staff and changing policies, it will be a big hassle and bad places to visit. Not at all recommended. Is there a rating less than 5 stars in zomato, M bar new management probably deserves it. 
Since when did taking your laptop bags to a restro bar become not allowed. These people can learn some mannerisms.

The drinks are absolutely yum! And quite reasonably priced, and the food is good too. 
I had the Irish Cream Martini, which which was served with a shot of expresso, it's a light drink to enjoy over lunch. 
For starters, we order Pizza with plenty of Veg toppings. I liked the considerable amount of mozzarella cheese. 
For main course, I opted for the Lemon Basa. The portion was good, fish was perfectly cooked. 
Ambience is good, it's has an air of luxury dinning. If you want to just grab a bit and go, this place is not for you. However, if you want to chat, have a few drinks, smoke and eat, it's definitely one of the best options there are.

Went here today. The manager said that they do not allow flip flops when I was actually wearing Sandals!! The most weird thing one can come across. I mean seriously?? I have been to places like Someplace Else, The Street, Urban Desi, Plush which are much more posh and happening than this shit place and they never had problem with someone wearing a sandal!! Get a life!!

Just the worst  place in the city. Don't let stag entry. I went with 3 of my friends last night and guess what the gateman said, "We generally don't love stags. We can't allow them". Screw him man. I felt like punching him. Hello! Don't we have some respect. Aren't we humans if we don't go with a girl. I was deeply humiliated. That's the worst kind of treatment by any pub.

M-Bar Kitchen is a latest gastropub that has opened up at Park Street. It‚Äôs situated just opposite of park street post office and bit hidden in the eyes of general people but not for foodies. Though it‚Äôs a recent addition in Park Street but M-Bar Kitchen already offers a combination of sophisticated ambiance, great food, creatively made cocktails, plus perfect music to dance to. The dance floor is open, and the DJ is open to requests most of the time.

It was raining like cats and dogs in the evening, me and my fellow foodie Ryan Wbdm Prospect Basu reached M Bar completely drenched. Staffs were very co-operative and welcoming, warm greetings and smiling faces made us feel comfortable. Ambiance was really nice and sitting arrangements were also specious and comfortable.

While going through the menu I found that hookahs were not listed. I placed our order very specifically to the staff that, first we want ‚ÄòMoroccan Chicken‚Äô as starter accompanied with ‚ÄòBeer‚Äô and ‚ÄòO ‚Äì Proof M Special‚Äô and after we finish our starter and drinks then they should serve us ‚ÄòSpiced Basa with Lemon Chilly Sauce‚Äô side by side ‚ÄòApple Slammer‚Äô and ‚ÄòMango Mist‚Äô.

As there was no menu for hookah, I asked for X in the Beach or mix fruit flavored Madam X, after some time they let me know none of those were available. They offered plain traditional flavor like Vanilla, Pan Salsa or Double Apple hookah and I was ok with Pan Salsa flavor.

Beer, ‚ÄòO‚Äô Proof M-Special and Pan Salsa hookah arrived first and subsequently arrived Moroccan Chicken. Ryan went for chilled beer and M-Special was for me. After the first sip I realized it was not something I had tried before, ‚ÄòO‚Äô Proof M-Special was a spicy drink! It was so spicy and flavorful you could not just stop after one sip and like an addiction you have to sip 2-3 times to confirm / recognized the spices they used in the drink. It had brilliantly mixed of spices and unquestionably not for the faint hearted.

Braised Moroccan Chicken with stuffed Green Olives was an elegant dish. Boneless chicken breasts were stuffed with goat cheese and olives, a great starting point for a rainy evening snack. Making a pocket in the chicken breast to hold the stuffing was not easy, creamy olive filling turns these chicken breasts into a special meal. Moroccan Chicken became slightly rigid as it was getting cold in chilled A.C. but the olives give a nice kick in your mouth.

Next ‚ÄòSpiced Basa with Lemon Chilly Sauce‚Äô along with ‚ÄòApple Slammer‚Äô and ‚ÄòMango Mist‚Äô was served as soon we finished the first servings, hats off to their service and timings.

Apple Slammer was marvelous, excellent choice for those who think about their health while drinking. Mango Mist was another surprise, you might found it little sweeter than usual but definitely enjoyable with spicy starters.

The Spiced Basa with Lemon Chilly Sauce was very well executed pieces of grilled fish ‚Äì charred to perfection, wonderfully tender and packs a punch of flavour along with the accompanying lemon chilly sauce. Melt in the mouth basa was truly excellent, cooked flawlessly. You will definitely enjoy your drinks in company with this starter. The spiced basa had addictively rich, creamy lemon chilly sauce that keeps patrons coming back for more.

M Bar makes a great place for dining with friends and family and you can eat till you drop without burning a hole in your pocket. The starters are well-marinated and come in a good variety. With great value and a good selection, they're really bringing in the crowds! Not the cheapest, but absolutely check them out for the high quality of food served.

Visited this place for a lunch with my friends. Was hard to find it on a rainy day as it is located inside a building complex. The ambience is pretty and the food was good too. We tried the signature dishes. Nut crusted tofu and mad about mushrooms pizza. It Was great. The mocktails were great too, I loved the kiwi berry drink they prepared. The service is good and the staff is friendly. Love to visit again.

Since I have a weakness for European cuisine, my partner n I planned on celebrating our anniversary there. I loved the lighting n the ambience too was pleasant yet thrilling.There are two divisions-the restaurant area and the lounge area.We were seated at the restaurant.Service was swift but the attendants were rather confused when it came to dishes.We had Bourbon Laced Chicken,Moroccan chicken, garlic chicken popcorn and Chicken Olivetti for starters, of which I loved the last dish.For main course we ordered Jerk Chicken And Coconut Rice,Chicken Pasta, another dish (don't remember d name) and Double Decker Pizza. Now one amazing thing about this place is their pizzas! Must try if u r a pizza lover.The jerk chicken was tender and juicy too.Then we ordered Tiramisu and cheesecake with hazelnut for dessert which tasted moderate.The best of them all was Kiwi Frappe, a deliciously refreshing mocktail and the O proof M special is a unique spicy one.Beer lovers like us would love to have more options in the menu(most are either unavailable or not in the list).Another suggestion for the management,set up some signboards/hoardings/flex for the location or directions.For us it was easy cos we are a regular at Park Street, but for most it won't be.Overall a memorable n lovely experience. :D :)

Gastropub is a new concept in town and Mbar leads in it by example.  The place was very difficult to locate and there was no proper directions written anywhere.  The place is brilliant.  The food is great and they have a good collection of alcohol.  Hookah is also available. The in-house dj is brilliant and she knows exactly what to play.  Friday and Saturday nights are legendary here.

Must try if u r a pizza lover.The jerk chicken was tender and juicy too.Then we ordered Tiramisu and cheesecake with hazelnut for dessert which tasted moderate.The best of them all was Kiwi Frappe, a deliciously refreshing mocktail and the O proof M special is a unique spicy one.Beer lovers like us would love to have more options in the menu(most are either unavailable or not in the list).Another suggestion for the management,set up some signboards/hoardings/flex for the location or directions.For us it was easy cos we are a regular at Park Street, but for most it won't be.Overall a memorable n lovely experience. :D :)

Gastropub is a new concept in town and Mbar leads in it by example.  The place was very difficult to locate and there was no proper directions written anywhere.  The place is brilliant.  The food is great and they have a good collection of alcohol.  Hookah is also available. The in-house dj is brilliant and she knows exactly what to play.  Friday and Saturday nights are legendary here.

Any place which serves a pasta dish which doesn't have penne or spaghetti or fusilli becomes an instant favorite of mine. The mushroom pappardelle was really yummy. The cheesecake makes you want to eat more. A must go. A portion size is good for 2 people.

After what can be called a ‚Äúvigilant search‚Äù we located this place inside Magma House, Park Street for a dinner . The d√©cor has a ‚Äúlounge yish‚Äù flavor to it and you have their in house dj dishing out cool tunes ! Absolutely loved their cocktails ‚Ä¶ the M special kaffir tea and Negroni is highly recommended . The food did not disappoint us either especially their Watermelon-cheese sliders which was probably the best thing I have had I a long time ! Jerk chicken with coconut rice among the mains wasa stand out . However, the dessert we ordered .. wine granita was unavailable ÔÅå Prices are on the higher side ..service is good .

M Bar Kitchen has a location that is not very easy to trace for a first time visitor. It is located right opposite Vedas, inside Magma House Complex, on the ground floor.
It has extremely warming interiors that is just right to cheer you up, and the music is pleasing, sets your mood just right.
Very unfortunately, food is little bit of a disappointment, and would require much of an improvement to match the likes of the restaurants near around.
We ordered Water Melon Slider and Potato Bravas for starters. With the first one, being a signature dish of the restaurant, I honestly feel, they could do much better. Potato Bravas was decent.
For main course we ordered Al Genovese Pizza and Pasta. While I would recommend Pasta to Italian lovers, I found Pizza to be nothing but ordinary.
Hazelnut Chocolate Cake and Mango Mist was our choice for dessert and drink. If I visit again, this cake would be my first order from their long (and slightly difficult to comprehend) menu. Life is short, eat dessert first, holds true in this case :D

We visited this place with eight of my friends with IIM-CALCUTTA. It was raining heavily and I was wearing a rainy day footwear. However, we could not enter inside because of inappropriate footwear. I was amazed by the professionalism of the restaurant manager. Thanks for reading this review and wear a proper footwear beforehand.

Completely shocking that on a Saturday evening, they say they don't have any draught beer.. That too we were quite early in the bar and there was hardly any crowd inside it.. The waiters took the order and they served us everything but the beer which in a way is disgusting considering that the whole order was built keeping the beer in mind. They were reluctant to play the music also in the inside section and we finally gave up and played songs through our mobiles.. Food is nice and presentation even better but without the beer its a terrible visit.

M bar kitchen is situated in magma house complex, next to Marco Polo. Finding the entrance can be a bit tricky.

I went there last evening for a drink with a friend and found the ambiance really nice. Its a huge place which gives it a very fresh feel and tables are spaced out making sure no guest feels cramped up. The decor is nice and the staff are courteous.

We ordered for a bruschetta and i had the caprioska  while my friend had the 0 proof m special. The bruschetta was nice and my drink was also good. I only wished that it had a little more alcohol content as it felt really mild. My friend told me that her drink was also decent just that she did not like the presentation of the drink.

All in all its a nice place to chill with friends and i shall visit again to try out some other items on the menu which i could not this time due to the hurry that i was in.

It has an unfortunate location which owes to the place being empty most of the time. I am not complaining about that though, because right in the middle of Park Street, to get a place on a Friday evening is quite cumbersome. The ambience, the decor, the feel of the place is both vibrant and classy.

We ordered a teen patti hookah, moroccan chicken, followed by the dirty martini, jameson and j&b rare. The hookah was extremely smooth, but not as strong as I would like it to be. The chicken was pretty well made, except that it was a little hard to tear as soon as it got cold. That shouldn't necessarily happen with good grilled chicken. The cocktail was really nice, not exactly potent but had a good balance of alcohol in it. 

The MAJOR issue that needs to be noted by the management is definitely the service - we hadn't even finished our drinks when the waiter kept bugging us for our next order. We had the hookah on the table, so even if we didn't want to order anymore drinks, we shouldn't have been pestered. It happened thrice in a row. Then, one of the ice cubes served with the j&b had a SCREW in it!!! I am glad I wasn't high and bothered to notice it. I really wonder under what conditions/environment/hygiene do they freeze their ice cubes. 

On bringing this to the notice of the management, they were apologetic and polite, and even made our entire order on the house for the night. Much appreciated definitely, but not without the caveat of a weird experience on my first visit here.
Without a good service and hygiene check, no place can expect to thrive in today's competition, and I hope the management takes care of the needful.

Oh, btw, they play good music.

M Bar is location in parkstreet opposite to Veda. but is a bit hard to locate,you won't be able to gate creash.

Service wise they are top notch,simply excellent staff in terms of communication and with what they deliver.¬†

Food is really nice but not out of the ordinary,but they make sure what they lack in quantity is sufficiently taken care by the quality of their dishes.
Hookah is good and one good thing is they even have a separate lounge for it,where you can relax alongside as you trip on the music.

I like how they have amalgamated all aspects into one package,be it dining, hookah lounge, the bar and the dance floor,which is brilliant as it caters to all kinds of clienteles at the same time. ¬†

The decor at the bar is real neat, got a touch of class and innovation to it, I like the way they serve shots in tonic bottles and yes ,you can expect all your fav brands to be available as the bartenders shake up some crazy cocktails.

Music is bigtime new age,thankfully you won't be forced to listen to repeats of songs ,unlike the much renowned Older clubs of this city which i a saving grace.I also like the fact that they keep bringing in new artists who have something new to offer.

Lighting wise is basic but pretty jazzed up on the concept that the wall turns into a projector also, the floor has decent spacing so you wont be cramped up.

Yes the price tags are a bit on the higher side compared to the other clubs but it is very much worth its weight in gold considering the service ,music,ambiance and above all experience you will end up cherishing.

Its a really cool lounge. Interiors are good, but the furniture could be more innovative.
The food was served very well and tasted real good. The prices were reasonable too.
I was pretty much satisfied with the service, but considering its neighbourhood, the staff need to be more young, cool and convincing.
Overall its a new place in town to hangout with friends and enjoy your best choice of alcohol!!

Normal Italian Food spread in the Menu, nothing new or different  to offer. Food quality is not that bad, but they have really screwed up with servings in each portion.
Alcohol priced pretty much similar to all other night clubs in town.
Hookah is very nice out here, goes on for a pretty decent span of time.
Bar has been decked nicely, and certain portions of the area is also done up well, what I did not like was the dance floor section, which is the restaurant area as well(during the early hours of the night), it is too shabby and weird, they could have done way better with it.

Went to the place on Wednesday with couple of my friends at around 8 PM.It was pretty crowded some how got a table at the lounge area as we wanted hookah...
Starting with the alcohol we were highly obliged with the selection of alcohol they have with a decent price range keeping in mind with the exclusiveness of the place.
We had ordered for some house special cocktails like jalape√±o martini and 100 proof M Special.It was amazing and totally different from the regular one and was also testing great with there thin crust pizza like M Peri Peri.Very prompt service and also never the less good hookah.
A must try place in Parkstreet street.....a bit difficult to find but worth it.

I went to M Bar & Kitchen on 16th April 2015 place after reading so many good reviews.
When I reached I realized I am not wearing a shoe and was asked to come back wearing shoe(absolutely logical). So went ahead walked 500mtrs at 10pm looked for a shop and bought a shoe to enter.
 
After all the effort to prove that yes we are civilized people me & my friend could enter your Lounge bar. The ambience is undoubtedly good. Serving staff is good.
We ordered LIT which was average. Food was average. But since the service staff were so humble we were comfortable .
 
Then comes the real shocker. One foreigner enters the lounge bar with shorts & Bathroom slippers with 3 frns.
When asked the staff how they were allowed people with such casual dressing the answer from the reception manager was "We missed looking at the attire".
When I spoke to the Manager Mr. Souraj Bhowmick, he comes with the most weird explanation "They are owners guest".
 
I have never felt this insulted being in the same country with such high discrimination. How can rules be different for different people
 
If I had the time I would have loved to file a lawsuit against your manager.
 
The Experience is totally disgusting and forget about me going there again, I will never ever recommend anyone to visit the Bar.

This place has a good ambiance but the service is quite slow... Staff were courteous when called, but were busy chatting among themselves and we had to call them three times in the first place before anyone paid attention!
Food is good overall. Moroccan chicken is a bit too oily, the buns of falafel burgers are a bit too hard, and the dip provided with potato gravas should be a little sweet too; its only spicy.
I would definitely recommend the chicken panini and the garlic chicken popcorn! Those are perfectly made.

This is a new Party place in town. Joining the many eateries lining Park Street, this Bar-Restaurant-Lounge sits right in the middle of it (Magma Complex, beside Magma House). 

Today was my second visit to the place. My earlier visit was on a Saturday evening (8pm) with friends and found the place (surprisingly) a bit deserted. Today, being Bengali New Year, was a luncheon affair with family. The thing that was same on both my visits, was the quality of the food ‚Äì Awesome!

It was a combo-offer today, with 2 starters, 1 main, 1 dessert & 1 mocktail. The Starters ‚Äì Moroccan Chicken, Garlic Chicken Popcorn, Spiced Basa with Lemon Chili sauce were all good with Tempura Fish being the best. Among the Mains we tried Zesty Chicken Fajita wrap & Occhio Di Blue (6 pcs Chicken Pizza). The portions, as compared to the Starters were really good and tasted delicious. The only downside I would say is the waiting time. But the freshness of the food and the flavor makes up for it.

The portion & taste of the deserts (Orange Fool, Grilled Fruits, Chocolate Mousse Shots) for me, were a bit okay-ish. However, priced @ Rs 449 (for non-veg), this lunch menu is truly value-for-money.

The d√©cor of the Restaurant is vibrant & colorful and along with the music, gives a nice ambiance to the place.

Maybe it is not situated on the main road and some may find the location a bit discreet, but the food would talk for itself and the word-of-mouth publicity should help it to gain some momentum. However, being a foodie in this city, have seen many restaurants start on a great note and then compromising later on the flavor. Hopefully M Bar Kitchen will not follow that route and until that time I would continue to visit this joint.

Well to start with, the location is not really that convenient even after being on park street. It's inside the magma house complex and it does feel kind of awkard to come out of the place drunk with corporate eyes staring at you.
Anyway, apart from the location, i found the decor and the interiors with the lightings to be pretty decent with some good pieces of creativity. The liquor prices are exorbitantly high. Happy hours is affordable but not that convenient or rather perfect like The Irish House. Service is very slow. Staffs seem to be confused if u ask them a thing here and there. I remember ordering 2L of draught beer. It tasted like low quality kingfisher bottled beer. Draughts are supposedly the smoothest, but didnt really had that experience. Food is decent. Hookah @450 bucks is damn costly given that in a nearby lounge( OTT) it is available at 200. Music was low, maybe they were on cost-saving mode. Seats are not that comfortable.
Overall experience wasnt that good.
I'll still prefer Irish House to this.

A Bunch of Goons ready with the trap to extort money from you.

I went to M Bar and Kitchen in Park Street by an Invitation of a company.  Not a big place but nice interiors and music.  They had buy 1 get 1 ‚Äúhappy hours‚Äù offer on  5th of March 2015.

At 9 pm when I ordered for a beer the bar tender told me you have to pay first to get the order so I paid. Then I paid again for repeat and got another drink.  After I finished my drink and was talking to friends, bar manager randomly approached me and told me ‚Äúsir, you haven‚Äôt paid for your second drink‚Äù. I told him ‚Äúif their policy is first pay then get the order so how does this question arrive‚Äù?  Without paying why would the bartender serve me the drink? The manager was a dumb hoax, who didn‚Äôt have any answer to this.  He told me he doesn‚Äôt bother for that and right now I have to pay. I told him to check cctv cameras if I am caught not paying for 2nd drink I will pay him double. He declined lols.  I was talking soberly and giving him logical solutions. It was also their bar tenders fault that they didn‚Äôt give me a bill on both drinks. He didn‚Äôt have any intellect to understand the situation or this was setup to defraud. He then called some bouncers and told me deal with them lols‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Seriously bouncers for INR200 bill lols. So I paid the bill again for 3rd time and this time I got to know bartender gave me wrong prices. A beer is 170 they charged me 200 on first 2. (that‚Äôs the reason they didn‚Äôt give me bill). I paid once again 170 for the same drink for which I had paid 200 earlier.

Never visit them. A very average place with no Wi-Fi.  Rude bar tenders. And if you look like a gentleman and few pegs down then they will come up with a way to rob your money by showing bouncers. This a crooked place managed  by a bunch of goons. If INR 170 was worth my time I would launch a F.I.R against them in Park Street police station with IPC Section 94 and 415. But they knew very well a person who spends 1k on a drink won‚Äôt bother to go to police station for INR 170 so they could do this hoaxing with such confidence. Never go there I am very sure this a random hoaxing trick which they apply daily on random people. But this trick won‚Äôt be making them money for long as with people like me this INR 170 extortion will cost them INR 50000+ each time with this kind of reviews which will be going on all social media.  Take care friends. Next time when you buy a drink and bartender doesn‚Äôt give you a bill then take the heck of asking for bill, even if you are drunk. Because our country is full of such crooked places.

Brilliant ambiance, superb service, tasty dishes
M bar is the newest party place in Park Street. With a vibrant bar, lounge and restaurant areas, its where the glitterati of Kolkata come down to party. Located at the corner of Park street beside Magma house, the place has lively music and wide variety of drinks to bring home the party. What elated us was that we got the first round of drinks free sponsored by Uber. We ordered some signature kebabs and pizzas which were really tasty. The restaurant area doubles up as a dance floor after 11. Being a Saturday night, the crowd kept pouring in even after midnight. Clearly a must go place in Park Street.

Visited the establishment with fellow zoman @Petal. And my my M bar kitchen you guys were perfect. We went for lunch on a weekday got ourselves a reservation very easily. The staff was very courteous and polite and kept on checking with us something that is a fleeting quality in restaurants these days but a very important one. They have two separate section a lounge area and a simple dinning area which we were in. The decor is good. To start of we had long island iced tea and they made it perfect. All the spirits were in the right quantity. Next we had pork chops. The food was served with just the right temperature the khus khus delicious the pork done medium rare and juicy. We could not find a thing to complain about. For dessert we had tiramisu I strongly recommend people to try this if you are a tiramisu addict like US. Its arguably the best in town. Soaked in spirit this things is mmmmm.. We will visit you again and again.

Great food good service will be back a lot on the menu to try for sure. Had some starters and definitely the flavors are well balanced I'd say the only thing is I like my food a little hotter (temp). Prices are really reasonable but guys lets get the Veuve Clicquot back in stock.

Hasn't been a long time since the place opened and it's already a buzz. Located conveniently on Park Street, you need to know that it's there to go there: you can't stumble upon it. One of the few places that serve 'Kuch Nahi'. Hookahs are good, food even better - totally justifying the word 'Kitchen' in the name. Thin crust pizzas are lip smacking and there's a wide variety of appetizers - all good. Good music on weekends. There is a lounge, too, now - very spacious and comfortable. Should be the next big thing in the circuit.

Its a great place with great ambience hospitality is good. Food is amazing but only drawback is that there is no parking if you come during the day . The PR Ms. Aarushi had promised us a parking but she never kept her word. Otherwise it's a very nice place to hang out.

The place is really nice. Ambience, music, service is good and the food is delicious. I tried the Moroccan chicken, griddled basa with anchovy butter and the chicken with the works grill dish. All the dishes had a unique taste. The staff is courteous. They have a good bar too. They have a varied menu with a section dedicated to the low calorie conscious persons. The quality and quantity of food is worth the price. A great place to chill with your friends as well as to spend a nice evening with your family. I definitely recommend it.

Yes, last week I was in Kolkata for a short trip. Been to this place as my local contacts told me a must try out lounge.....though new. Trust me, if you are not from Kolkata you are not gonna like this place.To begin with, at 8 in the night it has a deserted look with we (went with 2 of my childhood friends)¬†being the first customer for the lounge & believe me we were the only for the next couple of hours. Ambiance per se average only....you cant request for a track of your choice, seating arrangements of the lounge area not at all comfortable. However,¬†interiors & bar work¬†were good to notice.Our order started with White Rum.......it took us 15 min to explain him what a flavored white rum is but our effort goes in vain....as in place of a lime flavored rum what he brought was rum with lemon wedges.For food - Sides were nice, decent nothing great or different. Then we ordered¬†a Veg Peri Peri pizza.....deep contrast with the specification¬†mentioned¬†on¬†the menu. It was supposed to be loaded with Jalapenos, Black olives,¬† Zucchini, Baby corn, but all we saw was a thin crust pizza with tomatoes & onions & onions & onions.... & split 2 olives into half & sticked on every slice of the pizza. When I protested, the person serving said something in Bengali (thinking I don't understand) that I am having a pizza for the first time in my life....no where in the world I am going to get a thin crust pizza......maybe his world is limited to Kolkata.In short I suggest an avoidable place in Kolkata. If you are not looking for hookah & a lounge kind of environment can try Bar-B-Que in Parkstreet itself as the other day I tried it & found to be really nice.

This place located at the hub of the city calls for attention! 
My first visit to this place has been a nice experience because of its extremely well prepared delicacies!
The dining area is more alive than the lounge where we were seated with no music and very dim lights! One should prefer sitting outside with regards to the menu being entirely same!
For drinks we had spicy twist and the basil mojito,both of which was well made!
Then we ordered for double decker pizza and funghi risotto! And to our delight it was perfect for our taste buds! A lovely dinner because of its perfect preparations! I would have rated it with 5 stars if it's lounge ambience would have been improvised To do away with the dullness! :)

Well I was bored of all the European cum Italian restaurants and Lounges ordering the same food and dining in the same atmosphere.. M.Bar and Kitchen stands out on all fronts. It has revolutionized the meaning of Gastronomy and has taken it to another levels altogether. 

Situated comfortably in the heart of Park Street one will think twice rather thrice before going to dine or chill at park street because of major parking issues but one does not need to worry when it comes to M.Bar because they have an unimaginable valet space for a bunch of cars. 

The Bar has been lavishly decked with all the premium spirits and the waterfall concept is an indication that liquor does not stop flowing here. The overall Atmosphere of the place is extremely lively and I was spellbound by the electric vibe the Lights gave which went in sync with the swanky tunes played by the DJ. It blew me away. One has never experienced such an atmosphere in Kolkata before. The Lounge area again is ideal for Private parties as well as to just sip a cocktail and munch on to a few nibbles.  Overall the Feel of the place is Subtle yet classy.

Coming to the Menu, It has been handcrafted to perfection. From the Entrees to the Mains to the Dessert's each dish beautifully compliments the other. All the dishes are new and shall leave you in a dilemma as to what you should order and what you should leave out. Exclusive combinations which you have never heard of before at any place. 
 To name a few the Pallette Cleanser was a welcome start. The potato bravas were light yet overloaded with flavor. The roasted potato panini made me rediscover my love for panini. The Cheese and watermelon sliders was an interesting mix which my taste buds could not get enough of.  

People who love Mushrooms cannot even think of missing this place. Right from their Mad About mushroom pizzas to their Funghi Risotto and the Three Mushroom Pappardelle pastas, All pesto and Mushroom lovers have to try this. 

I was almost full but had to try some of the desserts and I thank my stars as I had the best chocolate Baklava in my Life. The Dessert Pizzas are Brilliant for a group of 6 and the chocolate Hazelnut Cheesecake will melt in your mouth and leave you wanting more. 

Finally the best catch is that the place is quite reasonable and you can easily visit the place without thinking twice about your pockets. Overall a double thumbs up to M.Bar and Kitchen. Keep up the good work. Cheers.

New kid on Park Street. But it has made quite an entry.
Located in Magma Complex, one would never expect to find such a place located. One gets quite pleasantly surprised when you enter. They have 2 separate seating areas depending on the mood and since we wanted to eat, we went to the dining area.¬†
They have an extensive food and drinks menu and we wasted no time in ordering the food.
For appetisers, we had - rosemary & olive focaccia (freshly baked, tasted awesome with balsamic vinegar), bruschetta (you need to be really bad to go wrong with it and thankfully, they did not), feta rolls (very interesting with a thin peel of zucchini or carrots wrapped over a piece of fresh feta and lightly flavoured) and courgette cakes with roasted pepper hummus (great on taste, with hummus made of bell peppers as compared to chickpeas and making it low on calories).
For main course, it was expresso spiced cottage steak (it came rubbed with expresso which gave it a very interesting flavour and the same time, it did not have its bitter taste) and lemon basa with asparagus (the basa was really well cooked, flaky and tender, the sauce had a nice zesty touch to it but I just wish that the portion was slightly bigger :( )
The service was really good, and the staff can come up with good recommendations based on your requirements.
It can certainly pinch the pockets especially if accompanied with drinks, but worth it if you want to go for some good food over a relaxed ambience. The only downside is that towards the later half of the night, the DJ takes over making it hard to have a conversation.

It was such a pleasure visiting M Bar Kitchen recently, the few things my wife and I ordered were all served hot, were well seasoned and tasted superb. Even our special requests were catered to properly. It is a delightful place and the staff are well trained. The music was soothing and the huge bar area is a highlight. Three cheers to M Bar Kitchen, we shall return soon with family and friends. Recommended: Jerk Chicken, Pesto soup, chocolate bakhlawa

Rating is only for the "Mad about mushroom Pizza" since I had a good mushroom pizza after a long time. Long cheese spread with frequent breaks of mushrooms was perfect for 4.

Improvement part should be with the service since we were charged with a wrong order which wasn't acceptable at all for a first impression. Cocktails were overrated and pricey. Lastly the "Cheese and Watermelon Slider " specialty of the place was just like a cherry on the top disaster , very less in quantity and not so great with the combination also.

Situated in the Magma house building, M Bar Kitchen has a variety of toothsome delicacies in store for its guests. The interiors and the ambience of the place is great. Among the things I had I particularly loved the potato bravas, the asparagus risotto and spaghetti agli olio. Not only was the food absolutely lip smacking but even the service was great. The staff was really co-operative. Thus I give this restaurant a thumbs up.

Located in the heart of the city, this place is a must try. It is one of the very few restraunts which has a family-environment with separate dining and lounge section that serves modern European food. The decor and interiors are very eye-catching,the highlight being the wall behind the bar with bottles flowing like a fountain and the music literally gets you grooving.

The menu is very cleverly designed with a wide array of options starting from the calorie counters section for weight-watchers to the normal one. If you are a pizza lover,then this is the place for you! We had ordered the "Mad About Mushrooms" pizza and a "Double Decker"as it is a house speciality and it couldn't be more flavoursome than what it was. 
The "chocolate hazelnut cheesecake" was the order for dessert which took a while to reach our table but it was surely worth the wait!

Overall experience and service was very nice and looking forward to visit again!

Its a Gastropub in heart of Kolkata.. Very easy to find out the place.. Its in near Park Street, just near to Marco Polo, there a gate inside the Magma Building.. Also, there is a large hoarding for the navigation of their place..¬†

Visited the place on 15.12.2014, i made a reservation for table for two.. During reservation, you must confirm whether you want to be seated either @ restaurant or @ lounge... So, i made the reservation for the lounge

It is pretty big space cleverly designed and utilized.. The restaurant is spacious compared to the lounge.. I liked the interiors with colorful lighting and the bar has been made like bottles of champagne overflowing (few of them).. There's a inhouse DJ playing good music.. Sofa's in the lounge are comfortable...

Coming to the important part is "THE FOOD" - All VEG

Starters: Potato Bravas: - They are like nuggets of potato with crispy on the top and soft inside but only potato with no other ingredient used.. Dressed with coriander and stem of onion... It's served with chatpata dip.... It was good in taste and really liked it...

Main course: Smoked Grilled Vegetables - Babycorn, bean, bell peppers, zucchini, carrot grilled ¬†with smashed potato dressed with spinach served with caper butter sauce.... ¬†We liked it, the vegetables were nice in taste and also the smashed potato was super....

Cottage Cheese and Tobasco Pizza - We ordered a pizza .. Topping of Bell Peppers, Babycorn, Paneer (No onion in the pizza as we had said no for onions) - 8 slices of pizza - it was good.. Really liked the pizza.. Thin Crust, Crisp and not so heavy... You'll love the pizza

Drinks - Had Talisker 10 year old - I tried it for first time; Kronenbourg Blanc, Black Russian cocktail - She said that it was nice but not great...and Bacardi Breezer - Lime (Between me and my partner)

They even have a smoking place and they even serve Hookah - We ordered one - Kiwi Flavor with Paan Base - they suggested the hookah... It was very smooth; unlike other places we didn't feel any headache....

Service: Great service.. Very rare one find spoon, fork and knife all three at the table... They would come every time without updation to change / replace places and cutlery...¬†

Price: Total bill inclusive of taxes was Rs 3814... According to me, its moderately priced....¬†

The only thing i did not appreciate is that we asked them for suggestion for food / their specialty but they were unaware of the menu; including cocktails..

Overall; a good place... Do visit... Enjoy....

It's pretty spacious. The bar looks Flamboyant !! Interiors are not that great but definitely upto the mark. They serve the best pizzas in town. Trust me the variety for pizzas and the quality is no match !! Haven't really had such nice pizzas elsewhere. Mouthwatering cheesy thin crust !! Bar menu and the food menu is also pretty huge. Risotto we tried was also very good. Burger isn't that great over here. Must try are the cocktails and the pizzas. Service is a bit slow. Staffing again is a concern over here. They don't have proper knowledge over the menu. One good thing is they have a separate lounge section and a restaurant section. The Dj console is right in front of the bar ! Overall a very good dining place. Cheers !!

One of the very few good places in Kolkata. The new decor and food gives a vibrant mood to the place. Italian and European food that you have never tasted like in the city. Amazing cocktails and one of the best pizzas that are being served in the city currently.
Great music and lighting in the place, an amazing concept of gastronomic cuisine.
Keep it up.

Food like you've never tasted before, presentation like you've never witnessed before and the rustic ambience gives u an entirely new kind of experience. And the best part is u can visit the place just for a brunch and cocktails too, if not lunch or dinner. Double Thumbs Up to M Bar n Kitchen !
