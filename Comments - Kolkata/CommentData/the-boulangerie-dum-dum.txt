I saw the reviews on zomato this lazy afternoon and decided to try them but was too lazy to go to the bakery so decided why not try their home delivery. I had a sudden craving for cupcakes probably because I was watching How I met your mother season one where Ted was dating a cupcake baker.  I called up the number and a very sweet lady picked up. Her name is Amanda. I told her that I wanted to have their cupcakes. She took my order and said she will come to deliver. I said you can delivery by 7 pm no hurry. She came to my place with three different flavoured cupcakes, chocolate, butterscotch and red velvet. I just loved all of them. It is perfectly baked. Soft creamy with right amount of frosting. If they increased the size of the cake a little more I would be willing to spend more. Anyway loved it. We should encourage such young entrepreneurs. I am myself one. Keep going girl. I will surely order my birthday cake from your place.

The first thing that pops on our minds when we think about desserts, is the journey our taste-buds take while savoring with the profound, and enriching experience....  yummmmm. From some time our favourite desserts have been these lovely Tarts from the bakery 'Boulangerie'. French for bakery, 'Boulangerie', is a new initiative taken by a pretty home baker, Ms. Amanda Gomes, who is also a financial analyst in one of the leading firms of Kolkata.

The Boulangerie - Everything about it will make your heart melt. Be it the desserts and cakes or the owner herself. :) Delectable, Delicious and Sinful - all of which you'll experience in these beautifully baked cakes and tarts. If you want to comfort yourself when you're down or its just another 'Meh Monday' at work or if you just need a pick me up, then the chocolate and lemon tarts will certainly make your day a lot better. I can vouch for that. And if you are having a very good day then please please please share that happiness with others (or just yourself) by ordering from the lovely and yummy range of cakes which The Boulangerie has to offer. They will surely make you want some more afterwards. The cakes, made with such love, will surely satisfy your tastebuds. My personal favourites are the butter cake and the red velvet cake. They are just so good! But do check out the kit kat cake. It can surprise you as well. The Boulangerie will not disappoint anyone who has a sweet tooth and definitely surprise somebody who doesn't have the same. Order and find out for yourself! :-)

Over the past two years independent bakeries have sprung up like mushrooms in the Laketown bangur belt....Well if you get past them and then you will stumble upon the latest kid on the block, boulangerie. Operating from the kitchen of it's animated owner, the small outlet's menu is easily comparable to it's bigger rivals. From appetizing tarts to delectable fluffy cakes, its a paradise for sweet tooth stricken victims like me. The vivid lemon Ray tarts and gooey cheesecake lovers stand out from a list of adorable tarts. Moving on, the comforting butter and walnut cakes from the regular cakes section is sure to remain with you long after you have greedily gulped them down. Finally, the exotic cake section is a league of its own. The eye popping caramel popcorn cake is a must try. It's other siblings, the lip smacking red velvet and mousse cakes, will make you ditch your current choice of cake shop. It's new but but once you taste the items, you will know exactly why it will thrive.

This has become my one stop destination for all cake and tart cravings. I am simply in love with the lemon tarts, i could eat them all day. I also love the signature tarts which are very different from what u get at other bakeries and way better. As far as cakes goes, walnut cake and  and red velvet cake are my absolute favourites.I dont remember trying anything better lately. 
I no longer go to any other place when i want a cake or tart as my favourite baker is right here.

It was a great experience. I ordered it for my sister's birthday. Affordable and delicious at the same time. Cakes here are amazing.
I would definitely recommend everyone to give it a try.

An ideal place to satiate all your sweet cravings. The place is easily accessible and the home deliveries are on time. The owner was happy to customise the orders for us, which makes the whole experience unique and special.The red velvet cake was to die for and reminded us of the days when grandmothers would bake for us, these are more pleasing to the eye ofcourse. I bet the cakes taste as yummy as they look. Overall a delightful experience to order cakes from them and love visiting them every time I am in town.

I discovered this place some time around August last year when I was searching for a baker to place some back-to-back bulk orders. And yes, the moment I had my first bite of the Red Velvet cake served by the baker, it was my Eureka moment. The order was delivered on time, in the most sorted way, unlike other clumsy branded bakers. Since then, I have been ordering a fair share of baking delights from here, almost every month. I personally love the signature tart and the cheesecake tarts. Also, do try out the lemon tarts and the Red Velvet cake, I can kidnap the Baker to have those. They come with dollops of awesomeness, mixed with love. So, now you know where to order your next B'day cake from! Keep Baking! ❤
