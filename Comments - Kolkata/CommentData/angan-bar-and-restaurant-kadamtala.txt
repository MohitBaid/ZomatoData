the decor is good food is good too but it is over priced.the quantity of food is not good  according to  the price..I think they should look into it..the famliy bar and the main bar area is separate.and the both place and their service is not same..family bar (where the ldies are allowed) service is not good at all than the full bar service

It is just near ichapur water tank. Quality of food is good and tasty but over priced. Inside atmosphere is good and they serve ordered item quickly.

Back in those days when howrah was my not only my permanent residence but my only home, this used to be our address if you wanted to go for a little different food in a moderate budget. Those days we used to gather here for the kebabs and biriyani. We used to slurp away the biriyani in no time. I have even visited this place with my family a couple of years back and they still serve good food , even during the busy Durga puja days. I feel any place who still serves you good food during those crazy days, calls for appreciation , and this is definitely among them.

This place is little different form any other bar restaurants in our area. And the quality of the food is much better. Especially chicken 65 and drums of heaven those are good. And the behaviour of the service team is also adorable.

Took away two portions of mixed fried rice and one portion of chilli chicken...  The rice had ample amount of chicken and prawn and the taste was also good...  Chili chicken was light and tasty..but the dishes were too much overpriced.. 250rs for each portions of mixed fried rice was way too much..

It has been a long time when I visited this place. Located beside ichapur water tank it was a pocket friendly restaurant for the students. We ordered mixed rice and Hong-Kong chicken(may be). Both were good. But didn't like the ambiance.
