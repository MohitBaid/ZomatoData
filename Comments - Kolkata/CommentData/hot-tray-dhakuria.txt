Located right next to the entrance of Tandoor Park in Dhakuria.
More of a home delivery/take away joint than a dine in place. I've had their food a number of times.
The owner of the shop is a kind man and often manages the place in the evenings.

Their Chinese is the typical Bengali Chinese. Their fried rice/noodles come in good proportions.
Dry Chilli Chicken is good and has proper pieces.

The Chicken Momo is a bit oily and eating it is a bit tricky as the dough wrapping the filling is loose.
Chicken Bharta is salty and tastes different than those available in other places.

I had my maths tuitions nearby, so I used to often drop by this place to have an egg roll. They'll put aloo stuffing. And the paranthas were perfectly made. I'm a die hard fan of their egg roll back in my school days.

The small food joint is just below Tandoor Park in dhakuria. I happened to pass by this place today, so grabbed a packet of chicken steamed momos. The momos are a tad bit oily, but was juicy and succulent with generous amount of stuffing. The soup tasted bland. The sauce was more on the sweeter side.

This small food joint is located on the main road opposite to Dhakuria petrol pump beside Tandoor Park. They provide home delivery and take aways and the food is very economical considering the location of the joint. I once got my food parceled from there. I ordered Chicken Steamed momos, Crispy Fried Chicken, Chicken Fried Rice and Singapore chowmein. They give a good quantity and each can serve 2-3 persons. The food is tasty and price is dirt cheap. If you are hungry and you don't want to spend much then this is the ideal joint for you.

ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„I Am Glad That I Visited This Outlet Hot Tray, Dhakuria Branch For The 3rd Time In 3 Long Years. Located Near Tandoor Park, Dhakuria Branch. And Most Probably I Visited This Outlet Hot Tray Because India Won By 208 Runs Against Bangladesh In The Only Test Match And They Are 1-0 Up Against Bangladesh. Results India 687-6 Declare And 159-4 Declare And Bangladesh 388 All Out And 250 All Out. Come India Dekha Do Kyunki Aage Australia Ke Saath Takkar Ka 4 Test Match Series Hai. Coming To Food: I Ordered 1 Plate Pan Fried Prawn(8 Pcs) For Rs. 150/- And After That I Ordered 1 Fish Fry(1 Piece) For Rs. 50/- It Was A Lovely And Delicious Snacks Meal. Within Rs. 200/- I Was Done. They Charge 200 Rupees For 2 People But I Was 1 Person With Lovely Items For 200 Rupees. Thank you Hot Tray For Making My Day Lovely And Delicious.âœŒâœŒ

This is no fine dining, or a decent place to go sit and enjoy a nice dinner. It is basically a takeaway joint. The person at the counter is pretty courteous. 
The hakka chicken/mixed noodles, is one of my must haves. Do not compare it with fine Chinese restaurants, but the noodles is brilliant tastewise and portionwise.
Rolls here are tasty as well. Mutton, chicken, egg I have tried them all. And it's good enough. Filling.

Situated in Jodhpur park just beside tandoor park. A small outlet mainly for takeways. though a small dining place is there upstairs which can accommodate 10people maximum. An ideal place for desi Chinese. Excellent spicy Chinese dishes which tickles your taste buds. Affordable price and more than enough in terms of quantity. Quite good in terms of quality. We tried their red hot chilli prawn starter this. The prawn was tender and succulent. the preparation matched upto it's name it was indeed red hot. Excellent for an afternoon or evening snack. Eagerly waiting to try out other dishes.

Located just beside Tandoor Park, Dhakuria, this place was a regular for me when I used to go out with my dad to check out the Babubagan Durga Puja pandal. Their egg roll was the item we both prefered, and with just cause. It was actually quite nice. Although I've had much better rolls, Hot Tray's Egg roll holds a special place in my heart, as it was the source of some beautiful durga puja memories.

This is the place where i first tasted authentic bengali chinese food when i moved to calcutta i was only 5 years old then .. Â During my stint at salimpur this was the go to place for chinese delivery .. i remember they even had a person who would make rumali rotis outside while skillfully flicking the dough in air. Even after all these years
when ever i come back to calcutta i often oder take away from this place for self and also for Â movie nights with friends. The taste has remained the same and the quantity speaks for itself. Pocket friendly ? very i must say. The owner is a delightful person recognized me in an instant after years of abscence . Â Hot Tray will always have a special place in my heart looking forward to go back and dig in to some delectable hakka noodles and side dishes next year.

It is situated just beside Tandoor Park. If you do not know where Tandoor Park is, reach Golpark and ask for directions.
They mainly serve Chinese, the Indian version of Chinese. A small pocket friendly joint where you generally get lightning service, even if it is during festive seasons.
A decent place for a quick eat. Do not expect amazing food or wonderful ambience, as the place is very small and a little suffocating.
Tip: Avoid drinking the water at Hot Tray.

It's a very small joint right next to Tandoor Park and opposite to HDFC Bank in Jodhpur Park. With some really tough competition from Tandor Park, you might think the rates are more reasonable to draw more customers. Sadly, that's not the case. The price is almost equivalent to Tandoor Park and the food is way below the standards of TP. 

Just the other day we decided to gorge on some delightful momos from TP but unfortunately they could provide only 1 plate. Since we had planned for 3, i decided to pick up the remaining 2 from Hot Tray. This also gave me the opportunity to draw a proper comparison between the 2 neighboring joints. The Hot Tray momos looked bigger in size but the filling was too less. They actually charged more than TP .. so, it was not really worth it.

For a place which specializes in take aways, I have to say I was a bit disappointed with delivery time. The food experience has been decent, slightly above average I must say. For a price you're paying the food is a bargain. And lastly i have to mention their Pan Fried Momo, though I have my struggles against spicy food but those Momos are really really  spicy. Overall, this place is a go to place for all our office orders and that way they are pretty good.

Was in search of a place to get a quick bite, quite late at night. It was raining. Seeing this place was open, we walked in. The interior was dingy. I constantly felt like I'd bump my head somewhere. Anyway, they seated us and handed over the menu. We ordered chicken noodle soup. The waiter seemed oblivious to the contents of the menu. He seemed very confident and nodded vigorously when we ordered. We wait for 10 mins and he brings us chicken noodles! Not soup. Normal chow mein. Upon saying that's not what we ordered they made us wait for another 15 mins. The soup finally arrived. It tasted bland. Just some hot water with veggies floating around. Couldn't even finish it. While paying we asked if they don't make the soup often since it tasted horrible. The guy at the register refused to take payment since the food wasn't good. So we walked away with full pockets but sadly empty stomachs.

Word of advice, steer clear of this place since there are plenty good places in that area. I went out of necessity. Cheers.

I have been taking out food from Hot Tray for the last 5 years. Though , the quantity in the aluminium box has gradually reduced , the signature taste has not changed much.

My personal favourites remain the shrimp ball curry and dry chilly fish.
I would also recommend schezwan fried rice and gravy noodles.

The only good thing about the place is the food!!... And I guess that's enough :)

The other day I had gone to this place with a friend of mine. We ordered for a plate of devil's chicken and medium chicken fried rice. The food was served in our table in about 10-12min time. It was served hot. 
The devil's chicken was spicy and had about 16-18 small pieces of chicken. Being a spicy food lover,  I really liked it... People who do not /cannot have spicy food, do not opt for this item. The rice was supposed to be plain chicken fried rice. I was surprised to find it spicy with a tinge of chilly garlic flavour. The quantity of a medium plate was quite a lot. 
We had asked for soft drinks...but that was not available.
Prices were really cheap!! 
But the ambience... Urr well, it isn't really a place where you can sit and eat..it is non ac, and looked dirty too. I would suggest a take away...

Affordable and pocket friendly good food and good amount. The rice and noddles serving of a plate is good enough for almost three people. Soup and momos specially pan-fried momo is a must try (even though it might be bit spicy for some people). Dry chilli fish and schezwan chicken are my favorite. For main course Chinese and American Chopswey is also recommended.  There are some very good starters available also. Home delivery is dependable and the service is good. I give a rating of 4 out of 5 :)

TRY A LOW COST MEAL @ HOT TRAY!
3 out of 5

For low cost and affordable Indian Chinese meal, the people of south Kolkata turn to Hot Tray. The establishment makes both Chinese and some Indian fare. The quantity and quality of food leaves no room for complaints. But the fare, being Indian-Chinese, might prove to be too spicy for some. Yet, the food tastes excellent and the food standard is consistent. The menu is limited but whatever is mentioned in the menu is generally available. 

Their very limited starters are great options for any new foodie. The starters are filling and tasty. Some of their fast moving items are crispy chicken, fried prawns, chilli fish and devil's chicken. Their soup preparations are equally tempting. Soups like hot and sour soup and hot garlic soup are fiery hot preparations. They are well seasoned and scrumptious food options. Even though they can be very spicy, the flavours are not lost nor overpowered by the strong fieriness in the soup.

Their rice and noodle staples are considered by many to be the best in the area and come in two sizes - medium or large. Yet the quantity is such that even the medium sized staple might be too much for one person to finish off. Chowmein dishes like mixed chow (Hakka or gravy) and Sichuan chow go well with a number of their side dishes. The same can be said for their fried rice items as well. Coming to their side dishes, you can try their sweet and sour prawn (very popular dish), Manchurian prawn, tempura chicken or fish and lemon chicken (my favourite).

Their limited Indian dishes like chicken bharta, chicken butter masala and paneer matar are modestly prepared Indian options. Service is never a problem with this establishment. You have the option of having your food delivered to you or having it there at the outlet - I recommend ordering in.

Hot tray makes Chinese and a few Indian dishes. Their serving is good but there is no home delivery. The quality of food is good and it's Indian Chinese. The choice of food is not a lot. Do try the Cantonese cuisines. They are nice. The sweet and sour chicken or prawn they make remain the height of the dishes. The price is cheap and it's a good option for a low cost meal.
