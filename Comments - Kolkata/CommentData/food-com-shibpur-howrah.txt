Location-Fazir baazar,Shibpur

This place is a small kiosk which is built few inches below the ground.We have visited this place once and it was our last visit to this place.They serve north indian,chinese and south indian cuisines and alongside they sell snacks such as chips and chocolates.

Service-The service at this place was quite fast and reliable but their homedelivery speed is quite slow.

Ambiance-The ambiance at this place was extremely poor.There were no chairs to sit and only tables were placed to eat.This place also requires to maintain proper hygiene.

Food-This was the worst part of this kiosk.We ordered only  chinese at this place and as we ate our first bite we felt as if salt has been flushed in our mouth.After this we didnt have courage to take a second bite and we left.

Service-3.5/5
Ambiance-2/5
Food-1.5/5

Though this is the best hangout destination for many but for me the experience have never been good. Service is too slow. Cost is also high. However, Chinese is the best part of it which can be tried. Even Mysore masala dosa is not bad. Overall food is good but price and service is not satisfactory

It one of the few Chinese restra in howrah shipur region. Despite of this fact it's still like a street food outlet with tables and chairs. 
The variety is good but the food is OK OK kind off. 
Not much of anyone's favorite hers in this region.

Its a good hangout spot for friends...the food here is decent..but the space is quite small and suffocating...the food served here is good...mainly dosa's ...and the crispy chilly babycorn.

A perfect place for time pass with friends. Chinese is the only good cuisine one can find here. Can be visited. Sitting area badly needs a change

Place it just a normal food joint to quench your hunger but if you are expecting something good to eat , you should avoid this place it is very much congested and compact! Below average experience!
