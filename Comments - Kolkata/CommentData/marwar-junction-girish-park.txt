One of the rare places that I feel are a shame to the hospitality industry in Kolkata.

1. Portions are for babies while before ordering they claim it is enough for two people
2. Charge packing twice
3. Take GST by absolute forgery
4. Despatch butter rotis without butter
5. Don't know how to talk to customers. Owner claims that customer could choose not to order again if not satisfied citing that owner cannot pay much attention to one order. I mean, WAKE UP!! 
6. By the way, food quality, not much was expected and it turned out worse, pretty amateurish! 

One should definitely try this place for a once in a lifetime experience!

The details mentioned here are wrong the menu is outdated one.Got the opportunity to visit the place and the food was quite good.The staffs told that they never gave any menu to zomato.It's a small cosy restaurant on road,would request zomato not to mislead its customers by putting in old outdated pics.

I was very eager to visit this place. But it was very disappointing. I ordered chola bhaṭura and it seemed like the bhaṭura was not fresh. And the grilled sandwich was not upto the mark. We ordered brown bread and got white bread. Plus the filling wasn't tasty. I hope they improve.

My biggest mistakes not following Zomato for this non standard eating outlet! Even I am wondering how can this type of food joint exist in our city? Just entered in hurry and took their biggest thali "Maharaja Thali"(?)! Costed Rs. 399/-. Total waste. Zomato doesn't allow review without rating hence 1 rated. This shop just opened to earn short cut money in short time and fly away. We could have doubted when we entered two guys just left with half eaten foods! All the items in the thali was at least 2 days old, all become contaminated and sour...even the kulfi they served tasted sour! The guy in charge was saying 1000 times sorry. But the this was unforgivable! We could have created a chaos because they took money before serving food, but left in hurry! Beware beware! Hope this should shut down very soon! Can't write any more...
