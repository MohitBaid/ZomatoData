Located just opposite the entrance of City Civil Court this is a quite well-known place for officegoers . Not much to write about their ambiance which is very ordinary . They have a sitting area on the first floor which is much comfortable than the ground floor . Have visited this place on a few times to have Biryani & on multiple times for rolls ( egg , Chicken , mutton ). Quality is average while pricing is quite cheap .

The restaurant doesn't look convincing both from outside and inside but I found their mutton biriyani quite good... You can try this restaurant if your office is near high court...

It's a mediocre restaurant serving Mughlai and North Indian cuisine located at Dalhousie near New Secretariat Building. Very ordinary office para kind of ambience as this kind of joint only caters to regular lunch requirement of swarming office bound population. Service is below standard as one need to wait long after placing the order. Coming to food, they serve a palatable quality of Biriyani with good quantity but dishes like mutton rezala, korma or tikia are mostly full of oil and hygiene seems to be their minimal botheration. Price is just ok. If one is into hobson's choice then only one can drop in here.

Located near City Civil Court. We were so hungry and this restaurant caught my eyes. There is a normal section which is the ground floor and an AC section i.e, the first floor.. we entered the AC section. Maximum of the chicken dishes in the menu contain 1 pc chicken. So we had to order chicken bharta (though we did not want to) along with parathas. The service was good and fast. It seemed to me that there was some sort of smell in that chicken.. so it did not come up to my expectations. It was okayish..

This looks like a heritage old restaurant due to its name and location in the busiest part of Kolkata, and it kind of is. We went there in between the shopping hours for lunch and it's situated right at the heart of the Dharamtala market. This is the beef serving branch of Nizam's. We just had normal conventional rolls (egg chicken, paneer) last time, but maybe next time I'll try those beef rolls which makes this place unique. But they could work a bit more on their hygiene factor and service. The outlet is understaffed and those too are a bit indifferent ones.

The location is superb...great food joint after some shopping or just a trip around Esplanade.
Price is pretty reasonable.

This is the beef-serving branch of Nizam's and is situated just beside it. 
The ambience is a tad shabbier than nizam's , but they make a beef roll that had me going in raptures. Succulent beef filling layered inside a crisp paratha,seasoned simply with onions and a dash of lemon juice,these rolls are a steal at 33 bucks.
Have had their biryani and side-dishes,which are unremarkable.
I just keep going to this place for the rolls.

One of the best places for beef. Be it biriyani, kebab or the beef roll. With very affordable price. Don't miss the beef khiri roll here. Try paratha and kebab

located opposite City Civil Court nd New Secretariat Building, Mughal Garden stands alone with its pride..my advice to not try the "special" dishes, as normals are far more tasty and delicious..Add firni in your list too..Affordable for pockets..

At one point of time, before China White invaded High Court area,or before High Court had the new and modern cafeteria in its new building,Mughal Garden ruled. Now the crowd may have thinned compared to the old days but still old is gold.
I have tried all chicken items here, and did not find any scope to complain. Their food quantity and quality are both sumptuous. I did not like their firni though. I have also tried chicken biriyani and parathas, which are good enough.
I have at last tried their mutton pasinda with paratha. Nothing much to rave about. I think they make a standard curry and put any piece - chicken, fish or mutton- into it. So could not feel anything extra.

It's a refuge for many in the high court area..... Fishing or decent biriyani... Other mutual dishes and rolls... It's locational advantage opposite the city civil court gives a massive football. 

Stock to the normal basic food stuff and you may not be disappointed but I can't help you with kebab etc which you can skip in
