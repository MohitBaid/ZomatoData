Perfect place to taste some authentic Chinese food. It is a bit different from other Chinese outlets as they haven't incorporated Indian flavours into it. The chimney soup is a must try‚ô•Ô∏è ammmmmaaaazingly loaded with prawn,fish, egg droplets. And the medium one was more than enough for four of us! We had helped ourselves with multiple servings to finish that! 
For starters we had chilly fish which tasted nice. They serve bhetki.
Then we had prawn meifoon, garlic prawn, honey lemon chicken and mixed fried rice
The meifoon rice was okayish, nothing great.
We loved the garlic prawns‚ô•Ô∏è
The lemon honey chicken was really different but very nice. 
The mixed fried rice was again loaded with chicken and prawn but then again the rice is very thick and of inferior quality. I'm not sure if that's something authentic or if it's just an inferior quality.
Our total bill was Rs2420.
The chimney soup is a must try!!

This place is pocket friendly and quaint . We ordered chimney soup with spring chicken . The meinfoons in the soup made the soup tasty and filling ( small can easily serve 4 in small bowls) , it was tasty, but could have been tastier. The spring chicken was crunchy and over all good. But , the¬† Cantonese noodles were mindblowing. Pork mushroom as side dish was a perfect mix of vegetable and meat. Ambience decor and serving style will remind you of jackie chan movies.:)

The main purpose of the visit was to taste their legendary chimney soup, and also being able continue our search for the city's authentic chinese places was an added incentive.
The place is at the first floor of an old building behind a petrol pump at G.C.Avenue. The place is  clean and cozy for a dinner. Ambience is really calm.
We ordered the chimney soup, available veg/non-veg in small/medium/large, and their small is not small. We were divided upon the soup's taste, as my fellow foodie friend found it to be somewhat bland, but I on the other liked it none the less. The soup has meifoon and lots of vegetables in the veg version.
Then we ordered Mixed Fried Rice and Honey Lemon Chicken. The fried rice was absolutely delicious, with sufficient portion size for two, and the honey lemon chicken complemented the taste beautifully. This dish, what I found interesting, is that the chicken pieces are crunchy and rhombus-shaped.
The service was at a good pace, and the place does not add GST. But very importantly, the prices have been changed by Rs. 80-100 in most of the dishes. So, the zomato menu is absolutely outdated.

It's a traditional place. The ambience is pretty basic. The quantity is good but the price is a bit high, I must say. They are CASH ONLY. They charge 5% GST. Interior is fully AC but dilapidated AC's strain to keep the place cool. The taste, some may not like it. We're accustomed to eat Chinese in modified Indian style. But this place, since it's run by a Chinese family, offers the exclusive original Chinese taste. So every item will taste different than our conventional 'Chinese' restaurants. One time visit for any foodie is a must.

Please remove the old Price ASAP. It was really an embarrassing situation when I visited the joint. Request all the Zomato Reviewer please do not trust this app. I had a talk with the owner and she told me that he had requested Zomato several times to remove their page but Zomato is not at all bothered to do the same.

This place is not a very well decorated dine in restaurant. Rather little shabby. It is on the 1st floor of a petrol pump with small stairs to enter. The ambiance is also quite average. It's basically a family run restaurant. We took chilli chicken which was good but the chicken was a little stiff. But I went there for a preparation which they call Josephine Noodles. This was the recipe of the shop owner. It's a mixed chowmin in Cantonese style but with less gravy but the taste is outstanding.

Two weeks back we went to relive nostalgia and savour authentic Chinese food after a couple of years. But....1st they never had service which was up to the mark; it was barely passable, this time also they held on to that. Their was one old waiter who could barely give information about what was available and what was not, the lady at the counter was only interested about her phone. 2nd the food quality definitely has deteriorated. We order a simple fare - fried chilly baby corn, mixed fried rice and hot garlic chicken. The baby corn could have been rustled up by me at home with my basic cooking skills. It was insipid. The fried rice was chewy, obviously the rice was sitting in the fridge past optimum period. It ended up being equally tasteless. Cherry on the cake - the chicken gravy was stinking and the chicken pieces were balls of near rubber, hooray microwave! Really disappointing.
They have installed ac and spruced up the decor, in the past few years, hope they do the same with food quality going forward.
I hope there was a negative rating option. Few years back I had eaten their signature dish - Josephine noodles which was definitely good hence did not rate one.

The old and dilapidated building can discourage you but once you reach there then it's a bliss for near authentic Chinese food lovers. Chimney soup is just awesome and not easily available in every so called Chinese restaurants all over our beloved Kolkata. We like the whole menu, favourites are mix gravy noodles, chilli chicken and pineapple pork. As we heard it's a regular choice of many celebs who prefer for takeaway.

Want to taste some authentic Chinese food? Then this is a place, you must visit. From outside you may think that Is this a restaurant, so old with high stairs? Yes! It is a restaurant which will make your day if you're a Chinese food lover. Ambience is completely serene in this place. I don't have any complain about the quality of the food and the quantity is more than enough for a single person.
It's a vintage restaurant so don't go for it's outside appearance, it's much better than you see. ENJOY!

Hidden in plain sight yet a bit tricky to locate, this place has been serving probably the most authentic Chinese in the city. Almost a hundred years old, this is probably the oldest Chinese restaurant in India and the restaurant provides testimony to this fact through some of it's signature dishes like the Chimney soup which is served in the hundred year old chimney pots with coal inside them. They haven't contaminated their recipes by hiring cooks from around and have carefully preserved them within the family. Yes, the generations of the same family cook the mouth watering dishes that get served on your table.
Eau Chew is not just any other restaurant..it's vintage and a heritage of this great city. They do not care much about advertising themselves because they know they don't need to. However, the Chinese they prepare isn't Indo-Chinese... It's pure authentic, so you better know your order from the vast menu. For me, this place is gold and I love going back to them time and again. Don't forget to try their Chimney soup, Josephine's noodles, fish in black bean sauce, roast chilly pork and whatever you desire. It's more like becoming a part of an ongoing tradition. After all, this is the place that introduced Chinese delicacies to the gastronomic Bengalis.

Considering it is over 85 years old, "EAU CHEW" would definitely make it to every "Kolkata's Iconic Restaurants" List. Still family run (3rd generation has kicked in), in terms of ambience, this is probably one of the most homely Restaurants in Kolkata. Simple flavours, nothing over the top. I feel the type of food they serve here, can't really be compared to most of the other Chinese Restaurants.. As a result, people either Love the food here, or don't care much for it. I for one, am a fan. Be it the Chimney Soup, Fried Roast Pork Chili, Szechwan Pork (which they were kind enough to make dry for us), Stir Fried Pak Choy, or their Signature Josephine Noodles / Rice (named so after the present owner).

TL;DR - Avoid this place like the old 500 rupee notes.

This eatery sits in a woebegone house behind a long-dejected petrol pump which is just a stone's throw from the Chandni Chowk Metro Station Gate No. 5, on the opposite footpath of the Broadway Hotel. One of my friends, Aishee/Ghoton suggested me this place and described as the ultimate holy grail of authentic Chinese cuisine in Kolkata. Now, unlike her, I'm not an expert on this subject matter, but I do fancy a hearty meal at Asia Kitchen/Mainland China and possess a little idea about how the authentic preparations could appear a tad bland for the untrained Indian palate. Even going by that premonition, the Chimney Soup, Fried Roast Pork Chili, Eau Chew Fried Rice and the Veg. Mei-fun - dishes that we ordered after much deliberation 'cuz not all thingz on d menu are available, ain't u get dat? noobs- fell short. Their signature soup fared relatively better on its own, as its flavorful lightness was a jolly surprise, and so did the pork (but I still swear by the one served at Gunjan) but all these little bouts of happiness disappeared when the He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named of the foodies' world struck- read Food Poisoning. My companion started feeling pukish just after we unassed the place and shortly afterwards had to go back in to throw up (the long ordeal while booking the app-cabs that followed didn't help either).All this while I have been trying to restrain my own stomach-churning only to give in upon reaching home.

So, basically what I'm trying to say is if you have a couple of five hundreds lying around, which are of no use to you, maybe try lighting them up to boil some water for tea, instead of going to this godforsaken place.

Now when people mention Chinese, it's usually the palate which we Bengalis have consumed for years. When I mention Chinese, it is Eau Chew. On Ganesh Chandra Avenue, off Mahatma Gandhi Road, diagonally opposite Hotel Broadway, lies this wonder. Perched atop an old building and guarded by a dilapidated petrol pump, which is no more in use, this wonder of a place is woven around Chinese mystics. The bustle of business has never penetrated it's sturdy walls and the perverse transformation of culture and the near destruction of authenticity has never really bothered the quaintness of Eau Chew. From the stillness of time to the gracious presence of the host and their staff, the restaurant is more than an eating joint. It is an integral part of the city and its glorious accompaniment with gastronomes.
The chimney soup is as real as the Great Wall of China. It's as true to its root as probably any of our existence. The mixed Chinese fried rice along with the Eau Chew special is a combination any worthwhile stomach will never want to miss.
A word of caution though. This labyrinth of wondrous delight is for those‚Äã who seek authentic Chinese cuisine. Hence, the blandness of some of its fares might come as a rude shock. This is a place of magical make belief and if I am sounding patronising, it's because I am a fan and this is my fanboy moment.
So the next hunger hits you and you seem to be stuck somewhere near Ganesh Chandra Avenue, you know where to go.
Surrealism awaits you.

I heard that this restaurant serves authentic Chinese food. We ordered mixed rice.. Schezwan chicken chowmin... garlic fish and chicken with mushroom veg. 
Food was damn tasty and had typical Chinese flavour and very light.
But the quantity of chowmin and rice is  less than compare to other restaurants.

This is one place where people would probably go for nostalgia more than anything else. This is one of the remaining authentic Chinese family run restaurants. Do not go here if you are someone who gives a lot of importance to ambiance, table setting, crockery, cutlery and all. Also, it may be a difficult for you to find the place if you do not know the area. However, post these initial few hiccups, the place will provide you your happiness quotient, for the food shall be good. The place is especially known for their chimney soup and the roasted chilli pork.

This is probably one of the few remaining authentic Chinese restaurants of the city!
Obscure behind a defunct Petrol Pump, this is almost like a hidden gem waiting to be explored. Once you get past the confusing entrance, you end up at the door of this simply decorated restaurant with a few reminders of its heritage and past.
This restaurant has been a part of this family for past few generations, where they have continued serving their age old family recipes to their patrons. 
Ask the boss lady, Josephine for chef's special. She would happily oblige by telling you about the fresh catch and best recipe to go with it.
Neat and clean restaurant, with ceramic servewares adds to the charm of this place.
Priced moderately, a meal for two would be definitely within two thousand rupees.

Eau Chew was only a sign board outside a shabby looking building exterier to us, untill we decided to make our ways and step in through doors of this 80 years old authentic Chinese restaurant tucked inside the corners of Ganesh Chandra Avenue, one sultry Monday afternoon. The world inside the restaurant is completely different than it's exteriors and we were pleasantly surprised by it's calm ambience and neatly done interiors completed with a cute little fish tank at the entrance. A perfect get away from the outside noisy streets. So we took a table and went through the menu. A selective choice of both veg and non veg items (made our veg friends very happy). Our order arrived very fast considering that the place had only 1 server that day. Food was impecibly delicious. Quantities were amply for people to share. We ordered Noodles, vegetables, fish, chicken and pork and soft drinks for 6 adults and Bill did not exceed 2400/- (best part) 
However talking of a wholesome experience, the only disappointment was that they did not accept card payments. In this age of digitalization most of us professionals look for places that serves quickly and accepts hasselfree payments. I hope after reading this the owners will consider keeping PoS machines in order for patrons like us not to worry about bills before ordering. 
Keep up the good job Eau Chew. You will definitely be on our list of Fav authentic restaurants in the city. See you again soon.

They serves Authentic chinese food. Had spring chicken, special veg noodles & honey lemon chicken. Spring chicken is light & fluffy. Noodles was slightly stirr fried and loaded with veggies. Honey lemon chicken is something that i never had in other indo-chinese resturents in kolkata before.That was a delightful chinese food experience. I found food items are slightly overpriced. Otherwise looking forward to visit again to try other iconic dishes.

One of best authentic Chinese eateries in the city. The ambience is quite comfortable, with an aquarium with fishes and a couple of turtles, Chinese traditional artefacts and paintings. One would enjoy this quaint little place if one is fond of minimalism and simplicity. The food here is very good and easy on the wallet. Try the Chimney Soup and Josephine noodles if you end up at this restaurant one sultry afternoon. Have some good Chinese food, stare at the tiny little turtles swim about aimlessly in the tank, involve yourself in some oriental idiosyncrasies and conversation as you sip on Jasmine tea. 
Eau Chew is a gem of a restaurant if you know what you're looking for.

One of the hidden gems of Kolkata. This place is tucked away in GC Avenue in a very shady building. The restaurant is owned by a Chinese family and they serve authentic Chinese food and not the Indo-Chinese food. 

So I dropped by yesterday with one of my friends. It's hard to locate for the first-timers but you'll get there eventually. So we ordered one Mixed Hakka Noodles and one Schezwan Pork Fried rice. We didn't order any sides. The Hakka Noodles was a bit bland and I didn't like it much. On the other hand the pork rice was spicy, full of egg and pork and it tasted much better than other restaurants. 
The only thing that bothered me was the quantity. It's very less I must say. 

Lastly those who appreciate authentic Chinese food, they should give this a try. Would be visiting again to try other dishes. 

P.S. The rates don't match with the Zomato menu. So the restaurant should look into this matter.

Our friend's obsession with Chinese food led us here, a shady looking building with a great restaurant. This is authentic Chinese, which means food would taste a bit bland to our spice loving tongues. Having said that, the broth that comes with most dishes is spot on. ¬†We took an Eau Chew special noodle (its on the special menu, don't remember the name) and some regular chicken dishes. We also took the Jasmine tea, which is equally good as it sits for longer periods of time.¬†

Would I go again?¬†
Difficult to say. Amidst many restaurants that provide "authentic Chinese" cuisine, this one doesn't check the "unique" box. Maybe I should try some more items from the menu.

Recommended by a family friend, we went for dinner here. Ordered a chimney soup, fried rice, hakka noodles, garlic chicken and mandarin fish. The place is quite spacious and sparsely populated. They have a no-frill interiors with white walls. The food was also kind of bland. I did like the chimney soup, richly laden with egg, fish, chicken and prawns but the noodles and fried rice was okayish. A bit taken aback by the taste of garlic chicken as it was sweet with hardly any garlic in it!

Good food ... Authentic Chinese food .... You must come if you love Chinese food. The location is very convenient and easily accessible (at Ganesh Chandra avenue). Trust me it's good and clean.

Genuine Chinese!!

If you are looking for Chinese and not Indian Chinese then this is the place to visit. Situated on the side of a defunct petrol pump in an ordinary nondescript structure is this Chinese family owned restaurant. Once you enter it's almost like entering somebody's front room, spartan but absolutely spic and span. It's one of its kind serving Cantonese Chinese. They do have some of the the popular fake dishes like Manchurian 'blah blah blah' in their menu but that's purely I presume for catering to the non discerning tongues.

We started off with the much heard of Chimney soup that had a hot broth with egg drops, spinach, chicken, prawns, bhetki and bok choy. We knew that the evening was proceeding well. The Pork-prawn mixed dumplings were exquisite, the perfect balanced grounded meat covered with that thin flour skin. We had preordered the Chinese sausages with broccoli with that hint of aniseed came along with the main course items. The Josephine Noodles in a perfect Cantonese preparation, the saut√©ed greens ( Mustard leaves and stems), the ginger flavoured steam bhetki with green chillies - they were all like home cooked Chinese entries cooked with a lot of love. The roast Chilly Pork was quite different and worth repeating.

A treasure house of some authentic Cantonese Chinese is what you would get here. That the family believes in good food shows in the dishes that they serve. It's a welcome change from the normal run of the mill Chinese that is dished out. Go for it!!

Eau Chew is surviving on nostalgia. So I followed my nostalgic instincts and visited the place. First for the d√©cor. Sparse and silent. The aquarium deserves special mention since you don't find them much nowadays for d√©cor purpose.
Coming to the food I think this place earned it's fame when options were less. But today good Chinese is not an aberration. Anyway I ordered the signature dish Josephine noodles( gravy noodles/chow as we normally know it). Excellent proportions of Chicken, egg, mushrooms (am not a pork person) with a healthy dose of vegetables. But my issue lies with the pricing. It's charged at Rs.480/- inclusive of taxes. The best of places do not charge more than 350/- and that includes the ambience. Worth a try but not for regular visits.

Best authentic Chinese ever!
The patience of finding this heaven, safely tucked away in an archaic Calcutta building, is completely worth it!
Must try the Chimney Soup and Roast Fried Pork Chilli!! I bet you will keep coming back for these...

P.S.: The rates on Zomato don't match with the actual prices listed on the physical Menu card. When I asked Eau Chew about this, they said that zomato had visited long back and taken the menu from them and listed the prices without notice. They have been getting such feedback ever since.

We had real difficulty finding this place and entered random buildings before arriving here.
The food totally makes up for it though.
The chimney soup(medium) was enough for 3 people and we could not finish the whole thing.
The chilly pork had a homemade flavour different from the ones we eat in Kolkata.
The chilli chicken had big,succulent pieces and the balance of flavours was just right.
Highly recommend this place.

P.S-They do not have the most hospitable of staffs though. Adjust your timings accordingly.

Eau Chew is a place which you see everyday but somehow don't manage to go...ended up going on 11th December. The entrance is deceptive , the decor is simple , the hostess is cold but the FOOD IS OUT OF THE WORLD. Had Chimney soup. Chilly pork and Josephine Chow...tastes were subtle quality was one of the best and the quantity was enough  to feed 3 adults...the price is steep if compared to the location and ambience but the food makes up for everything. Only the hostess never showed any enthusiasm never acknowledged my thank yous that left me quite cold as we are expecting basic social interaction. It's highly recommended for exciting and super tasty Chinese food.üëçüëçüëç

Had noticed this restaurant many times while passing along G.C. Avenue, but never had the courage to step inside going by the looks of the entrance. But reading the rave reviews of other Zomato users and ultimately having had lunch at Eau Chew, I can say now that looks can be truly deceptive... even if the entrance looks foreboding, the rest of the experience was bordering on awesome.!! 

The interiors are quite homely and done tastefully, but the food was the thing which literally took our breath away. The Chimney Soup (small, enough for 2 people) was very light and filling at the same time. Although the Fried Chilli Chicken starters was a bit too dry for my liking, but the taste was good.

For the main course, a dish of Josephine Noodles along with Salt 'n' Pepper Prawn... and we were in paradise...!! Superb taste and very light with minimum spices, there was absolutely no chance of any stomach upset, even though we were quite well full at the end of the meal.

Loved the food. Would definitely go back again to sample more of their specialities.

Eau Chew is a hidden Kolkata Chinese eatery which dishes out amazing food. I ended up there alone after some work in the area. This place is tucked away in Ganesh Chandra Avenue, a climb up a steep north Calcutta staircase and you are there. Eau Chew is famous for the Chimney Soup... Which is exactly what is promises.... Soup in the most curious looking bowl, with a smoking chimney in the middle. The soup was gorgeous and very generous. The non veg soup has a mix of chicken, Prawn, pork and fish with egg drop and pok choy in a delicious broth. A little bit of pepper and soy sauce and you are on board! I also had dry chilli chicken it was delicious... Easily one of  the best dry chilli chicken I have ever had! The soup was so generous it will be enough for 3 people and after having 2 bowl fulls I brought the rest home! And it was delicious semi cold! I cant wait to get there and try the rest of the menu! 
PS: The place doesn't accept cards... Which is one little downer.

Located behind an old petrol pump on Ganesh Chandra Avenue, this is one of the few restaurants in the city that still serves Chimney Soup, which is the main reason why I go back there every time. The steaming soup with everything from prawn to chicken to pork and egg drop, and spinach too is served in a 'chimney' with a live fire burning underneath. Although sometimes, in case of the small size, they don't light the fire. The soup is nevertheless the most delicious thing that I have ever tasted. All their other items are wonderfully cooked and have the taste of authenticity. The service is good and the prices quite reasonable. It is definitely an eatery which every foodie should visit at least once in their life.

Eau chew is one of the oldest, best, tastiest traditional Chinese eatery located in the heart of the kolkata city. Unfortunately, with the passage of time and the mushrooming of glitzy Chinese joints all over the place, this eatery is becoming more and more unfrequented. But those who appreciate and know about authentic, tasty Chinese food will always frequent this place. 
This place has been shown on numerous foreign documentaries on television as a true - blue authentic Chinese restaurant. The owners are the chefs, using recipes handed down from generations. The place is economical for the quality and quantity served. 
This is the only place that will serve you the traditional and tasty chimney soup. This soup is a part of gourmet history. Meifoon is seasonally available. Pork dishes are served as well. The Eau Chew specials - noodles and rice are too good. 
Meat ball soup is also available. 
The only deterrent is the location. It is a pretty secluded, empty area, especially in the evenings. Afternoons are fine. Any lover of Chinese cuisine must go to this place with family and friends to enjoy.

eau chew...an old favorite..
on moving out of town, i hardly got the chance to revisit this place that i quite enjoyed. back in town for the pujo's, i thought what better way to relive the taste of the cantonese noodles that was great once upon a time!
so..how was the food??
not a disaster. was it worth it?? .... forget it.
the food was bland, (a bit burnt too, actually), just decent but nothing different from any regular chinese restaurant. is this the great authentic chinese that folks consider to be so different from the indo-chinese meant for the masses?? nopes. this is just regular kolkata chinese food.
eau chew has jacked up rates like crazy. for this price, jimmy's kitchen still serves some out of the world chinese stuff you'll love!!
who else is better?? ... mainland china and jimmy's kitchen, by light years. tangra joints beijing and kim li and even regular park street 'chinese' like barb'que are also much more worthy alternatives.

eau chew is just a shadow of its great past which served lovely comfortable and markedly different food. give this a miss for sure. just forget it, actually.

Can't deduct a single score from them. I am lucky that I could manage to visit this place many times mainly because we hold our office get together couple of time in this historical restaurant. Calm- quite and excellent food, what else one can expect from a restaurant. They are so normal in their restaurant decor and overall approach that made them unique and defiantly they have a great history behind them. I have tried many of their dishes and each one is awesome! Eau Chew- Pride of Kolkata.

Only chinese dishes and yes, at it's best.
No flashy decor or some signatures of being posh. They just make a point that everyone comes back every now and then JUST FOR THE FOOD.

There are MANY restaurants serving chinese dishes in the city but no everyone can come close to the authencity of Eau Chew Restaurant.

Non Veg Chimney Soup is a must have from this place. Beside that, my picks are:

Starters: Fish Fry fingers.
Main Course: Eau Chew special fried rice or Noodles with schezwan chicken.
Josephine Noodles or rice and chilli roast pork. 

You can try the Chicken Manchurian or Chicken with cashewnut if you do not like spicy side dishes.

No flashy decor, pretentious upholstery but what you get is what you sought on the first place. Absolutely authentic Chinese food without the excessive usage of the dark soy sauce and msg which would make you thirsty in a while. We had the pork mei food soup which was a meal in itself followed by mixed fried rice and schezchuan fish. The fish used was original bekti and was cooked to perfection. Looking forward to going back again.

Needs no introduction, excellent Chinese food and yes, this place is near to the old Chinese settlements in Kolkata... So obviously it carries a long thread of heritage recipes... 

Might look shabby and undecorated but still enough to decorate your tastebuds...

I did hope to taste some authentic Chinese here.. One of the oldest Chinese restaurants in Kolkata, still run by a Chinese family. The decor, fengshui, wall-hangings and family photos created the ambience of their authenticity. 
But when it came to the food, it wasn't great at all. The medium sized chimney soup was quite heavy for two, actually a small chimney should have been sufficient. The soup with all the choy, chicken and prawn tasted good, but the pieces of fish tasted somewhat raw, and marred the overall experience of the famous chimney soup. Also, the burning coal wasn't provided underneath the chimney, which is why the soup cooled down fast. 
Then, coming to the szechuan mixed noodles... It was bland and very oily, worse then the chowmein from street side stalls. 
The bill stood at 740... A futile visit.

At lst one item was not very edible during my visits. But the rest were fine so hence the rating. Also what i dont like is the irregularity in their service hours. A lot of time it happened that we went for lunch and it was closed.

As expected this Old Traditional Chinese Restaurant did not disappoint our group of 5 people. The items were tried and tested. We had Chimney (Non-Veg) soup to start with and Fried Roasted Chilly Pork. These took all of us walk down the memory lane. I took my 7 year old son to show our favourite Chinese Restaurant and he liked both the items. We moved onto J's Noodles and Mixed Fried Rice for the mains along with old favorites, Fish with Black Beans and Chicken in Oyster Sauce. There is no change in taste or the presentation and we all had an excellent dinner.

Eau Chew serves one of the few old time authentic Chinese cuisines which has survived the test of time. A lot of nostalgia is associated with the place.

Location: situated near Ganesh Chandra Avenue and Central Avenue crossing opposite Broadway Hotel and behind an old petrol pump. 

The entrance is very uninviting. The building seems dilapidated. But since the place is there for ages and generally visited by old-timers and foodies mainly they haven't done much about it. Once you enter the place in the first floor the d√©cor is nice and simple. 

Food: Just wonderful - must haves are their chimney soups, momos, fried chilly pork, mandarin fish, and ginger crabs to name a few. Their specialty is also the Eau Chew noodles, amazing flavours as it has a burnt  smell mixed amazingly well with the other ingredients.

Their serving quantity is huge so they have an option for half plates. Pocket pinch for 2 persons is Rs.600+. Good value for money.

I have been going there from my childhood days and will always go back for more.

The favourite old school Chinese lovers joint! Have been visiting this place for over 10years now, and the food and taste remain the same- old school and tantalising the tastebuds leaving a trail of nostalgia.. The Restuarant is situated on top of an almost haunted petrol pump opposite to Broadway's- which is a blessing in disguise.. One unlike other Chinese joints there is no alcohol on the menu, thus cutting out the drunkard community minus the alcohol stench.. Only the smell of good food invites you in.. The other point being- it's location ensures it's old buddies to dine in.. Cutting out the Chatter batter crowds.. Now coming to the food-- ummmmm what a taste! No unnecessary aginommoto clouding the natural flavours, the price that you pay for a mixed noodles or rice ensures you get a handsome dollop of all kinds of chicken, prawn, pork et all.. The pork preps aren't just dishes, they are delicacies.. Call me biased if you may.. But nothing is more inviting than the rich Chinese aroma filled minimalist ambience of the dining hall, where giving into gluttony for a day, won't hurt your calorie meter much; you will be rewarded with a happy tummy indeed.. Be sure to include the star of the menu- the Chimney Soup and be rest assured that it will never disappoint you a bit! Thanks a ton to the family who runs this place!

I don't understand why people dislike the ambiance at Eau Chew , this restaurant has a delightful and magical old world charm to it and it is one of the things which keeps bringing me back here. This restaurant is situated a good 45 minutes away from where I reside but I don't mind making the journey there.

If you love eating and trying out new things, trying out the Chimney Soup is a must. It is indeed a novel experience. The family that runs the restaurant may not be the friendliest, but they are very attentive to the needs of customers and never try to be too friendly. It is rather sad that people in our city expect waiters to act like slaves and maybe that is why they are dissatisfied with the service.

I have always found the staff rather polite and in addition to this, the food though a tad on the expensive side, is very worth it.

first thing first. if u r looking for typical kolkata-kolkata-Chinese restro then this is not ur place and if u r looking for a variety of menus and prompt service, then its not ur kind a place.
but if u want to taste a authentic chainese food this is ur place.
location: this restro is located in ganesh chandra avenue, near to chandni chawk metro station. beside a petrol pump. inside a old building . ( i dont know its proper adress,i just know its location.anyway google is always there for us). to find this restro a bit tricky, they dont have any ad or sign board outside the restro.
Decor and service: very neat and simple decor. because its inside in a old building u dont feet like very hot even in the summer also.U will find max 1 or 2 people those r taking orders.so dont expect vry propmt service.

Food: some of their speciality:
chimny soup
josephine rice
josephine noodles
chilly pork roast

In every item u will find fresh veggis and chunks of meat and medium sized prawn.
they use less souce nd corn flour. most of their item's non-oily and healthy. all the perp are different frm our usual chinese foods.So if u want a gastronomic delightful eating experience then go to this place. it's worth every penny.

I am not really happy with the experience I had here. The price given in zomato has been revised. We had fried chilli chicken, which was an utter disappointment. The mixed chowmein and the mixed fried rice were satisfactory with sufficient amount of chicken, egg, prawn. The garlic chicken though could have been slightly better. The main problem what I felt about Eau Chew is the price to quantity ratio. They should definitely consider mending that.

I had been here a year back or more. However the quality of the food is authentic enough to comment on it years later. It is lottle difficult to locate the place. From outside the place may look little shabby but inside it is purely a tru Chinese restaurant. Do not judge the book by its cover. The place is calm and quiet and very homely. The food tastes authentic. Price is reasonable. A good place for family dinner or lunch. As I said do not judge the place from outside, so one needs to go inside to relish every dish prepared here. I look forward to go to this place for authentic chinese.

One of the very famous names among the patrons of old-school Chinese in Kolkata, Eau Chew brings back fond memories for me. I actually got to visit this place very late, when I was completing my MBA, but since then I have been there for 3-4 times, and the experience each time has been simply great. Locating this place can get a little tricky, like most old restaurants of North Kolkata ‚Äì it is housed inside an old building by a closed petrol pump near the Chandni Chowk metro station. There are no indicators except a bright yellow and red cloth sign which reads Eau Chew Restaurant, and you have to climb a flight of stairs to reach a door that looks like any ordinary house. Once you enter the door, you know you are at the correct place ‚Äì a large hall with tables and chairs and a counter, with Chinese paintings hanging all around you. 

There‚Äôs an old lady who runs the restaurant and the kitchen, and on insisting she has been known to recommend some of the best dishes her kitchen can put together, off the menu. However, in these visits, everything that she had recommended has been listed in the simple menu card, and so far except the Lemon Chicken, nothing has been disappointing.

The first time we went to Eau Chew, we tried the Mixed Meifoon with Mandarin Fish and Fried Roast Pork Chili. I still remember the delight after the first bite of the fish, it was hands down the best quality Bhetki I had had at any restaurant for a few good years. It was melt in your mouth, exploding with flavor and not dominated at all by the gravy. The Meifoon, always a favorite, was top notch and so was the Fried Roast Chili Pork, fatty slices of roast pork fried with onion slices in chili garlic oil. Yum.

Over the next meals I have tried a variety of their dishes including the Mixed Noodles, Cantonese Noodles, Chili Fried Fish, Lemon Chicken and Steamed Fish. And yes, the crazy and brilliant Pork Wonton Soup, which was super but millimeters behind my favorite place, Tung Nam. Warm and soothing, this soup is a must try here. The Cantonese Noodles and the Chili Fried Fish were excellent, but a standout of all my meals here is definitely the Steamed Fish. Chunks of fresh Bhetki steamed and cooked in a light soya sauce gravy, this is what a dream is made of. Unbelievably tasty, and this is a must try preparation of Kolkata‚Äôs offerings, a must do at a pilgrimage that gives you hearty, simple and delectable food. Long live Eau Chew!

People talk about having authentic chinese, being served and getting to relish some of their delicacies.
I am a big fan of their food, and you will be in for a big surprise - after you visit this place. You may question other big name restaurants and their servings after a single visit here.

This place is run by a Chinese family for generations, and so it's attached to their residence and hence the environment is also of humble beginnings. The ambience, the set up and the location (behind a closed fuel pump) may not be suitable for many - but don't fall out for this. The set up is pretty adequate, with comfortable seats and air conditioning.

Let's talk business:-

Chimney soup (can serve easily as many as 4) - best in kolkata ( a T2, and a Telegraph article on two separate occasion was reported elaborating their masterpiece)
Apart from this definitely try the Chicken wanton soup if you are visiting in packs.

Starters are pretty cool to have, but they don't stand out like the rest,entitled in my review.

Main course:-

Gravy chowmin dishes and their amalgam of sauces really stands out. Some of my favourites:
1) Mixed Cantonese
2) Mixed Szchewan

In the side dishes:

1) Honey lemon chkn
2) Chicken cashew w/ veg
3) Fish and Pak choy
4) Mandarin Fish

are some of my favourites.

Apart from these if you want to try something different, go for the Chicken and the Fish pineapple dishes (both separate dish), these surely woo you!!!

And after having all this, and a belly fool of yummy foods, the bucks you have to pay at the end of the day won't even bite you.... Believe me, of you have not visited that place - you may regret, y u didn't visit that place any time sooner........ 

Happy hunting - - - - - - üòâ

A broken building,a shut-down petroleum pump,grumpy men hurrying along the footpath and a very plain sign saying "Eau Chew Restaurant". Going up a flight of stairs, we went inside this airy, big restuarant. The chinese owners' family sitting by you and eating will make you feel right at home. We ordered Josephine noodles, Chilli Slice Pork and Eau Chew soup. Each dish was delicately prepared and the flavours will make you go yum. The service is a bit slow.
P.S- Pretty pricey

Love this place for its Josephine noodles; fat thick noodles, lots of well made vegetables and a mild, tasty gravy and The Eau Chew Soup. The ambience is soothing and the service is extremely homely. Price is on the higher side for quantity; but for the quality of food, it is very well worth it. 
However the Chimney soup has a superb broth (very similar to what you get at Tung Nam's wonton soup) but albeit overpriced. Plus even on requesting it to be without pork, I found numerous huge pieces of pork all over in the soup. And there weren't an abundance of either proteins or a variety of vegetables in the soup. 
I'd frankly recommend you to stay with the Eau Chew soup unless you're a major fan of pork.

Reading the reviews here, I see the food ‚Äòcritics‚Äô here are quite divided. I think polarized reviews is a hallmark of something singular. I have never tasted ‚Äòauthentic‚Äô Chinese food to be honest, but I have tasted every strata of Indo-Chinese there is, from street food to the pocket-friendly ones like Kimli and Beijing, the ‚Äòmiddle of the pack‚Äô-s like Mainland China and even the great Yauatcha. Let‚Äôs cut to the chase now. While I can‚Äôt root for the fact that they serve original Chinese food (because I feel they don‚Äôt), I cannot deny that their food bears a signature style which is unmatched and unique in a good way. What I find commendable is the restraint in adding oil and abstaining from using ajinamotto in their food. The waiter (yes only one guy!) and the owner ‚Äì a young Chinese girl are very courteous and offered valuable advice in choosing our course. I will not name any special dishes because the reviews before mine already do a good job of that. The joint is easy enough to locate if you know what you are looking for. I found the fare a tad overpriced though, but well worth it when you consider the falling population of family-owned Chinese food joints in the city. Case in point - Nanking and Hou Hua. Perhaps the higher prices will even out the playing field in this capitalist-friendly economy and keep them from getting extinct. So go out today and experience a piece of Kolkata‚Äôs, umm, India‚Äôs history!

Indian chinese food and Kolkata have a long standing relationship, one that has not always produced great cuisine. Eau Chew is a little gem, tucked away over a car park/petrol pump on Ganesh Chandra Avenue, it's food occupies a unique space between authentic cantonese and comforting indo-chinese.¬†
The classics are the mixed fried rice, chili pork and mixed greens. The dining room has a cool retro aesthetic, complete with orange tables and a mysterious fish tank.¬†
No frills, well priced and deeply satisying food. This is true Calcutta-chinese, the kind that matters.

Located at Ganesh Chandra Avenue, this place on top of a garage, as a result of which this place looks very uninviting. But,once you enter inside it's totally different in terms of the quality and taste of food. This restaurant is run by a Chinese family, residing there only,for decades. Their staples like Fried Rice and Meifoon ( Rice Noodles ) are very different from other places and are unique in their own ways. And side dishes of Chicken, Prawn and Pork are simply divine, they serve as a great ingredient to the taste buds. Service is quite fast and the staffs are courteous as well. Will come again and again! :D

The thing that excited me the most was it aged same as my grandfather, and the idea of eating in a restaurant which happens to witness so much my city has gone through that it itself is a history. Did read a lot about this place, hence on a winter night me and my parents headed to Eau Chew.
Ordered one small portion Chimney soup, which was just about sufficient for three of us, not on the more side, brilliantly made, took away all the cold with a finger snap. Then came the Josephine noodles(2 plates) , chicken black bean and roast chili pork (2 plates).
Josephine noodles was full of vegetables/mushroom/chicken. Chicken black bean was milder on palate, black beans tasting salty. Pork was hot , full of chili slices, but tasty . I wish they could put up some yesteryear pictures of Eau Chew and that of Calcutta.
QUALITY: 5/5

Imagining Chandni Chowk without authentic Chinese food is little hard. So in lots of Authentic Chinese Restaurant, Eau Chew got my attention for its higher rating on Zomato. 

Location : This place is located at Ganesh Chandra Avenue near to Lalani E-Tech City. It is in the front building of petrol pump. You can see a small board of Eau Chew & directions to go to the 1st floor.

Decorations : Decorations was fairly at the simpler side. This restaurant have pretty decent space inside holding a large number of sitings. Basic sittings, basic lighting, old fans hanging, 4 old window AC that fills the large hall in summer days. 2 Chinese Chandlers hanging from roof & probably the name of the restaurant written in Chinese in front makes it easy to identify it as a Chinese restaurant. An aquarium with full of fish is also there to grab attention of the visitors.

Staffs & Management : At 7'O clock the restaurant was completely empty, as you can see in the attached images with this review. An Indochinese girl took the order from us, but even after asking she was unable to guide us with good combination of dishes. So me & my friend ended up with 2 gravy items. It took a bit longer than usual to serve orders to our table. But the orders were served well in a good way.

Foods : This restaurant is famous for its all authentic Chinese food. By following some of the reviews on Zomato we ended up ordering the following...

Chinese Chop Suey : The Chop Suey came in a bowl with decent quantity. Fine sliced boiled vegetables were on top of that. It was mixed with chicken & prawn but both were hard to find because of very less use of it. Where small chicken pieces were crispy fried but hard to chew. Chop Suey was half dipped into gravy that was spicy but not at all tasty. The gravy was making the whole dish tasted bad & it was hard to finish.

Chicken Chop Suey : Just like the Chinese Chop Suey it came with large quantity & sliced boiled vegetables on it. Where Chinese Chop Suey was on the spicy side, this one was very lite. Very less chicken pieces were there & they were just boiled, still not soft & tasty. The Chop Suey were dipped into odd tasteless gravy. The gravy was making the dish worst in every way. This dish tasted so bad that it changes the definition of Chop Suey to me in a bad way.

Chicken Mushroom Veg : As per the name suggest this dish came with lots of vegetables dipped into dark gravy. The mushrooms & vegetables weren't well cooked & the taste felt really odd with a bad fragrance coming from it. There was very less unshaped chicken pieces in it & they were just boiled & not even fried or cooked well. Vegetables & chicken pieces felt little hard & absolute disaster to taste bugs. Gravy on the other side was with some odd spices without any specific taste & doesn't meant to suit with other dishes. It felt so bad to me that I left the table without even finishing it. Even just boiled vegetables soup tastes better than this.

Price : The pricing was almost same with its competitive restaurants. The quantity of foods are good as per the price but when coming to quality it doesn't even satisfy the price point at all.

Conclusion : When Chinese restaurants like Crystal Chimney is nearby to this place then choosing Eau Chew is basically a curse on Chinese food. With worst quality Chinese food & not justified price point it is absolutely not recommended for any kind of people.

Before entering the place you might think twice to enter or not but trust me and get in else you will miss an experience.
An authentic family run chinese restaurant with minimal interiors done.The food available is very different from other places and will remind you of early days of jimmy s kitchen.
Chimney soup is a must try and a signature dish here.
Even pork and seafood preparations are well made and fresh.
Please do not expect a star grade service as it is a family run restaurant ,think that you are having a meal in a chinese home.

I was planning and trying hard to visit Eau Chew for the past few weeks. Finally last Sunday my wife and I decided it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s now or never. It was already 12:30 PM and we quickly searched the net for the restaurant contact details and timing. I tried the number twice but there were some problem with the connection. Also the search told us that on Sundays this place opens only for the dinner. Nothing to do we decided to wait for a few more hours

Situated on Ganesh Chandra Avenue behind what seemed to me like a deserted petrol pump (I might be wrong). You need to climb up a spiraling staircase to reach the restaurant on the first floor. The ambience is nothing special. Pricing is moderate. Food served per plate CANNOT be shared. It is sufficient for one person only. They take quite some time to serve. The place is quite spacious. The quality of the food is just brilliant and you'll be asking for more.

Well, from outside, you can't even imagine what's actually waiting for you. The restaurant is kind of in an odd place, but let's not focus on outside's looks. 
Homey ambience inside, you can sit and enjoy your food quietly. A good place for eating with relaxation.
Let's now talk about the food. Pork was the main thing for which I went there & they didn't disappoint me. Tried manchurian and shezwan pork, both are quite good. The fried rice would have been better though.
Overall, tasty food and not so much costly place. What else do you need?

Place is good clean, may b legendary but with an indianised chinese taste bud this place disappointed me. The chimney soup nonveg was extremely fishy and pungent. They should disclose key ingredients in the menu card so people can have more independence in choosing things. The spring chicken was actually like a spin & more of like a light battered chicken pakora, hakka noodles & chilly chicken was nothing great.

It's a pity I have visited this place just once, that too, when I was not in the pink of health . Apparently the oldest Chinese restaurant serving authentic Huang Recipes that's still open, this place is very clean and homey. We ordered a small portion of chimney soup (enough for 3) , josephine noodles and roast chili pork. The chimney soup had all kinds of vegetables, chunks of chicken, pork, prawns and egg; it was light, mild and so flavourful that it hurts to think I couldn't finish it all. The Josephine noodles is probably the best preparation of noodles I've had- thick noodles in mildly cooked veggies, chicken and prawns. The roast chili pork with fat was very good, in spite of the few pieces I found slightly dry. The preparation was sumptuous though, forcing me to overfeed myself. The quantity of all the mentioned dishes were enough for 2-3 people, depending on how much you can eat.

I am totally coming back for more. I have heard of the fried bokchoy. :3

P.S. If you have a delicate palate or you are exhausted with Indian Chinese and want to try an astonishing explosion of subtle flavours, this is just the place.

Wouldn't recommend the eau chew spl soup, though it tasted nice, had a lot of corn flour. Pocket friendly and good portions. A meal for 2 is around 800 bucks. And that includes portions where you'll have to say I cant eat anymore.

The best thing about Eau Chew is the fact that it has no pretensions of being anything else than a Chinese eating house. The food is old school Kolkata Chinese and the decor is uncluttered, unobtrusive. The restaurant is very instagram-friendly and you will know what I mean once you visit it. ¬†The Chimney soup, which comes in gargantuan portions and is served with a hint of drama, is their speciality and doesn't ever disappoint. Their fried prawns are beautifully crisp without being oily, and that's no mean achievement. The restaurant is conveniently located near the Ganesh Chandra Avenue exit of Chandni Chowk Metro.

The chicken slices were rubbery chilly chicken was served as chicken dipped in corn flour when asked they took my food and returned the same with few chillies and onions.oh I been eating in this restaurant for the last twenty years I never had such awful experience. Probably they must have changed the cook. On top of that the lady i the cash counter kept arguing her husband cooks well.

Their fried prawns are beautifully crisp without being oily, and that's no mean achievement. The restaurant is conveniently located near the Ganesh Chandra Avenue exit of Chandni Chowk Metro.

I visited this place with my cousin and heard that it was one of the oldest chinese food hub in the city. However, the food quality was not good as expected. Although the ambience is fine.

Pls never go on Sundays horrible tasteless food it seems all left over of the week are sold on this day. Wastage of money.and time . I ordered for chilly chicken fried rice chicken Manchurian and chicken noodles. The chicken slices were rubbery chilly chicken was served as chicken dipped in corn flour when asked they took my food and returned the same with few chillies and onions.oh I been eating in this restaurant for the last twenty years I never had such awful experience. Probably they must have changed the cook. On top of that the lady i the cash counter kept arguing her husband cooks well. That day I decided never to come or bring my family or friends again.......rating. 1.6

Great place to have Old style Chinese food...almost home-cooked! The food is fresh and is our only choice when it comes to Chinese. Plus, the Lovely family for company.

Would recommend the fish-ball soup in winter. Need I mention their Chimney soup...

Roast pork, Josephine noodles, Pak Choy among others.

Locating this restuarant might possibly remind you of games like hide and seek or Treasure hunt ... coz though its situated on the much popular Ganesh Chandra Avenue(across 'Supreme' retail store) in Chandni Chowk ,but still u might surprisingly find it difficult to locate it specially at night or post evening ..... the only identifiable landmark i found was after u take the street across Supreme store, just look for a closed(permanently) petrol pump on the left hand side ...and bingo ...u would find EauChew :) ....
¬†From outside it indeed looks uninviting, almost resembling a haunting place at night ..... As we entered the restuarant which is on first floor , we found the ambience inside was quite homely ...infact when inside, it didn't look like a restuarant but a large dining room of a typical traditional home in central kolkata ... the place was not dirty though ...it was ok .....it had AC as well which was quite welcoming as we went in the summer months ....
Now coming to food ..... We ordered Roasted chilli pork in starters ..... I have eaten pork in several places ,i would say ..i liked it here to a great extent ..... it was indeed tasty ..... then we had Flaming fish ... it seemed like a schizler dish when served ... it was tasty as well .... we also tried fried rice which i found nice .... overall the food was quite tasty and seemed to make up for other factors ....
Considering its location and pricing in other nearby restuarants, pricing in this one is not on the lower side i would say ... though its definitely not high¬† ..... i would love to visit it again ....

Decided to take away veg noodles and veg manchurian from the outlet.  Firstly,  the rates are on higher side...  Per plate manchurian costs rs 100/- with just 4 pcs that too small in size.  Now about food.  Pathetic.... Noodles had no salt... Manchurian was having high salt...  Manchurian balls were too tight...  Were not getting cut by spoon... 
Would not recommend it to anyone

It's one of the oldest Chinese restaurants of Kolkata which keeps up to its standard of ingredients. I have been visiting this place since college day and all I can say is the food has lived upto the standards. The entrance has a very period movie kind of a feel.. The Restuarant has been renovated in the past 10 years and its still my best bet for home cooked Chinese food in Kolkata! And yes you'll never be able to find another Restuarant in Kolkata, with the same size of prawn in soups n maimcouse!

One of the most hard to locate restaurants in the city and one of the best authentic chinese foods you can get in kolkata..the old staggering building and the awesome quality of the food inside are just contrasting to each other..go there during the winter and try out their chimney soup , mandarin noodles and pork sides .. they just cook awesome .. be careful and remember to carry cash with you as they do not accept plastic money ..

Visited Eau Chew on the 16th
of March 2015 along with my wife. Bill number F/9424.

The hooks of Eau Chew are 
specific few dishes along with Josephine noodles. The major drawbacks of that
place are:

Difficulty
in parking.We did not get any yesterday. The driver kept on taking rounds.Very 
cold staff. Specially the owners who sit behind the cash counter.Service 
staff looks untrained and not professional. No knowledge of food also. Grooming
needs to improve too.No 
bar.No 
waiting area.Only 
one waiter for the entire floor and one busboy kind of a person.Do
not accept credit cards.Chimney
soup container is not with heating arrangement anymore and thus gets cold.


Like I said, irrespective of the
lacunas as mentioned above we go for the hooks and specially since we have
grown up with the food.

We ordered:

Salt 
& pepper prawnsFresh
lime sodaBottle
of waterJosephine‚Äôs
noodlesFish
with Pokchoy


Review:

Salt & pepper prawns: Looked like boiled prawns (smelling too)
with some bland vegetables (mostly cabbage and some carrots). Absolutely low on 
seasoning and aromats. Prawn salt & pepper is a stir fried dish with high 
on aromatics from vegetables (celery, onions, coriander leaves, garlic etc.), 
sprinkled with Szechuan pepper and sea/rock salt. Nowhere near that and costs 
INR 700 plus taxes with absolutely watery sauce.

Fresh Lime soda was the blandest possible we ever had.

Josephine‚Äôs Noodles is our hook, for which we went there in spite 
of so many drawbacks. I must say, it was nowhere near to what we are used to. 
Small ¬†portion size. Hardly any 
vegetables (no greens and carrots at all), watery sauce, noodles were not crisp 
(the typical pan frying of this dish used to be amazing), only 2 small prawns 
and a few chicken. The lady at the counter was very cold about this. Our heart 
broke, not going to go there ever again. 

Stir fried Fish with Pokchoy pathetic. Watery product with small 
pieces of broken fish. Waiter promised Calcutta Bekti but we felt it was not. 
No seasoning at all. No thickening/binding. Should have had a few cloves of 
crispy garlic.
¬†

Total bill amount was INR
1723.22, including tips, it was INR 1900.00. They did not charge service tax
but VAT, yes. With those price points and such bad experience, surely shall not
visit for a very long time.

This restaurant was very close to
our hearts and once, used to eat 2-3 times a week. We are very sad.

For a foodie to reach pure chinese (not oriental) foodgasm, welcome to Eau Chew- arguably Kolkata's oldest operating Haka-Cantonese styled Chinese Food Joint. 

"Direction and Timing"

As soon as you enter Ganesh Chandra Avenue from Central Avenue- Ganesh Chandra Avenue crossing and heading towards B B D Bag, after around 3-4 minutes of work, there will be an old-car parking space and a closed petrol pump on your left. Behind that, lies an old building (clearly out of its best days) with a board- Eau Chew.... Welcome !!! 

Timing:- 1130 AM- 230 PM and 630 PM - 10 PM

Interior is nothing to boast about- you get an AC environment with comfortable chairs and an extremely hospitable host- the Huang family.¬†

Eau Chew means "Europe" in Chinese. The founders of this place opened it up when there was an European thriving in this area and hence the name. The current patrons - Mr. Joel Huang and Ms. Doren Huang are the fourth generation of the family tree running the place. Still, the entire food is cooked by the family members and only the mise-en-place is done by cooks/ helpers. Hence, you can be rest assured about the food quality. 

Interior

On the table, they serve you with the standard condiments, the only difference being the Soy Sauce. Its unlike something we normally come across in restaurants. The soy sauce here is salty, spicy and having a typical character of its own. 

We asked Ms. Huang to guide us about the menu that she would like us to take and the journey started with Chimney Soup.¬†

Now, this chimney soup is almost a staple diet is china among all class of people. Charcoal is put inside the strange shaped pot and half-cooked soup is poured in it and the while thing is put on the table. As the discussion on the table grew wilder, the soup would get its true flavor getting cooked to perfection on the table. Nowadays, as Joel Huang said, due to fire license problem and time constraint the "cooking on the table" ritual has come down to getting the full-cooked-soup in the soup pot and serving it. The chimney soup is a full-meal in itself and consists of egg drop, vegetables, chicken, fish cubes, prawn and pork and one small portion is sufficient for 3-4 adults. The taste-its nothing like ever tasted before- the subtle taste of the ingredients- perfectly blended together creates the magic. 

the next starter was "pork and prawn stuffed Siu Mai". Now, Siu Mai, in layman's language means dumpling. Its kind of the seamed dumpling with little crispy exterior (don't know how they achieved it via steaming) and juicy, succulent interior. Its to be had with the spicy red chutney provided with it. ¬†

Next came one of their signature dishes "the Josephine Noodles". This dish, as Joel said, is invented by Josephine Huang- the third generation Huangs in Kolkata. Its basically a huge pot of pan-fried noodles with lots of toppings (chicken, fish, prawn, vegetables, black mushroom to name a few). One dish is sufficient for 2-3 people. And it tastes just like heaven. We've tasted gravy noodles a number of times- everywhere, but this dish with pan fried noodles was mind-blowing.¬†

Along with it came a full army of gastronomically brilliance.... As follows:¬†

First one was Fish with chilly black bean. This is kinda dry dish with lots of chilly and a version of rajmah. And, the fish used was pure sweet water Bekti. This one was the showstopper among the side-dishes. The smoky flavor of the black beans gave this dish a distinct edge over the others. To good. 

The next one was chicken in wine sauce. This is cooked using smoked boneless chicken chunks in chinese red-wine. This dish has a love-me or leave-me kinda attitude. Either you'll fall in love with it or won't like it. My wife didn't like it while went well with me.¬†

¬†And their signature item- Dry Roast Chilly Pork. Very less fatty meat, rugged-no nonsense looks, lots of chilly and pure foodgasm.... ¬†

And , we were almost full, while the final dish arrived- the Schezwan prawn. Unlike what we're used to, this one was not of reddish color, nor it contained lots of garlic but was flavored with schezan peeper and was extremely good. Prawns were of best quality and this went extremely well with steamed rice. ¬†

After all, this, we're almost on the verge of food-explosion and happily full. The pocket pinch was nominal.... a final thanksgiving to Joel and Doren and off we leave. ¬†

Points to remember:-

They do outdoor caterings - pure Chinese food at a nominal cost

For a group of around 10-12 people, they present a set menu consisting of 12-15 dishes at the restaurant at a very nominal cost (around 500/- per head, might slightly vary)

Suckling pig, Whole picking Duck etc are available on prior request and a token advance

BTW, I share my gastronomical experience at www dot mohamushkil.wordpress.com. Please feel free to get updates from it ...

Eau Chew is located on Ganesh Chandra Avenue near Chandni Chowk.First of all the ambiance of this restaurant is not so good.It is located in the old house looks like a haunted house.One of my friend treated here for her internship fees.As a starter we ordered Chicken spring roll & fried chilli chicken.Both were same taste.Then we ordered main course like Eau chew Fried Rice,Egg-Chicken Fried Rice,Chicken Manchurian & Honey Lemon Chicken.All items were average taste.Honey Lemon Chicken taste so different.Price is high than their food quality.

Authentic Chinese..classic ambience..nostalgic flooring n lovely aroma all over the place as soon as u enter it. The place is hard to find out unless u have been recommended n well directed bout it. Good that it has come up with a banner recently... 
Well I went there specially for pork but unfortunately they didn't have enough stock so v cud order only 1 dish. So in case u r going for pork lik me...u better call up n confirm beforehand. The pork was yummy n was jus perfectly cooked. The josephian noodle is a long known delicacy of them n definitely the steam the aroma everything gets u the perfect combo with the slightly fried crispy noodle that again melts in ur mouth. N this noodle had everything in it from mushroom to broccoli babycorn prawns chicken yumyum.. V tried a soup called eau chewes special which was an instant hit... I might go back for the soup. N garlic prawn n chicken dishes were awesome too. Though they have crabs n Porks in menu ...they often don have the stock sadly. 
Overall experience I ll definitely go back again n then Again ;)

Homely? Check.Chinese? Check.
Conveniently located? Check.

Nestled within the bustle of Chandnin Chowk GC Avenue, this is a quaint little Chinese food joint that'll warm your heart and soothe your soul.
Run by the Chinese owners who reside there, you'll find this place wonderfully stuck in time, reminding you of the Kolkata you only get to read about.
Around that part of ton this December/ January? Do order the pork dishes available.¬†Order the Chimney soup or the Eau Chew special to indulge in some sinful gluttony.Order the mixed fried rice and savour the aroma of all things meat wafting at you as the steaming plates are carried to your table.
If you're from outside Kolkata and visiting with your parents who aren't really into music and uppity ambiance, take them out for a lunch at Eau Chew. Brownie Points are already on their way!

"One of the better authentic chinese restaurants in town. You are a die hard chinese fan and you have never been to eau chew? "
 I had just heard praises about it. And finally decided that I should finally drop into this one. It could be easily located. Just a brief walk towards R.N.Mukherjee road and you reach eau chew situated on the left footpath. Located on the first floor. My first reaction was, "authentic chinese and so clean?" Unbelievable! The decor was rather simplistic.  Just brief chandeliers hanging and dimly lit. Did not look much shabby. The attention grabber is of course the food. We were three of us. So could not possibly gulp in the huge quantity of chimney soup,  though I have heard it is their speciality. So decided to keep the order decent and simple. Started off with thw roast chilli pork. The cutlery arrived and it was delicate and beautiful, much contrary to the steel plates served in other chino joints. The pork finally arrived. It was perfect. The amount of chillies.  The amount of roasting needed. Everything just too apt. The taste was heavenly. Then ofcourse the main course was mixed fried rice and pork with mushroom and veggies. I can not imagine what was so great. But it tasted amazingly beautiful. Loved every bit of it. The mushroom and the veggies so fresh and tasty. I am definitely going back and listing this as one of my favourite chinese restro in town.

Had once overheard someone say Eau Chew is the first restaurant in town to serve authentic Chinese food. My pursuit to have that 'authentic' Chinese food began that very day and Eau Chew is what I headed for.

It's located about 50m from the exit of Chandni Chowk metro station. The locality is nondescript, shabby and dingy; to be precise, it's above a garage.

But, as the adage goes, "Don't judge a book by its cover"; it's true in this case. Even though there is hardly decor to talk about, the ambiance is homely. Even though the owners and the servers are a little straight-faced, the quality of the food is good beyond doubt.

While the Chilli Fried Pork was yummy, the Eau Chew special noodles was wholesome with lots of veggies, prawns, chicken etc. The Honey Lemon chicken had a subtle yet striking taste; while the Garlic chicken had a smooth taste. One noteworthy fact is that their chicken pieces are not heavily coated with cornflower unlike other places (including some popular ones).

The pricing is good given the quantity and the quality served. Have been there several times for these reasons only.

High recommendations for this place prompted a visit.The food is good but not the to die for Chinese taste. For example we ordered garlic chicken and sweet n sour chicken and it turned out we had difficulty in differentiating one from the other!  Alike tastes, and smaller quantity in dishes pretty much disappoint.The one recommendation is chimney soup, the traditional way of serving it with its bland yet nice taste is one thing you can come back for. The rice and noodles too are pretty much had it before not so impressive types. The thing you will remember for this place is the high cost for dishes that leave you wondering if it was worth it.

Went there a couple of weeks ago, after having suddenly happened onto the restro.. Was apprehensive because of its shabby exteriors, but after seeing some rave reviews, decided to try it out.. Ordered chicken Florentine noodles, and sliced chilli pork.. It took a long time to come,  but the food was nice.. It was not out of the world, but certainly not bad.. The pork was really good though.. The staff was a but lethargic and the experience could have been much better..

Disapointed! I had HIGH expectations but the food did not live upto my exoectations! Josephine Noodles as per EVERYBODY'S RECOMMENDATIONS was good but the rest? Nope! Over rated i feel. Ended up dishing out more than 1200 rupees for average food. Schezwan chicken and pineapple fish had similar tasting gravy. Black bean sauce was likeable. Manchurian gravy chow was surprisingly very similar to Josephine noodles... That's it! But quantity was great! Maybe today the cook wasn't feeling that great. I plan to try it out once more before dismissing the place from my list.

used to be my favorite Chinese Eatery since college days... but few days ago i visited them again 11/10/2014 ... unfortunately¬† the authentic Chinese¬† taste has been deteriorated...we have ordered Josephine rice and and garlic chicken...¬† Josephine Rice was one of my all time favorites... they used to serve well cooked rice in moist gravy, chunky pieces of chicken and full of prawn,¬†¬† (yumm) . but unfortunately they are not serving Josephine rice anymore. i mean they are, but what they are serving that is definitely not the Josephine rice which used to be my favorite ... the one they served that day was under cooked rice, just a lil gravy two pieces of prawns and three pieces of shredded chicken with lots of cabbages.. i hated the taste so much that i told the lady ( Sits at the counter) please make the dish again for us.. and told her we would like to have it with more gravy.. she refused to do that..she said if we add more gravy to the dish.,. then the veggies will become more soggy... we didn't get that. because the veggies were already cooked in the gravy and soggy as well. anyways we had that yak thing (so called) Josephine under cooked rice.. and the garlic chicken was horrible the it was no even edible... to be honest, i was disappointed with the outcome.
honestly speaking this restaurant is highly over rated.
Food portions are quite small.
excessively over priced.
and Oh! yes there is a plenty of factors can cause stomach pain after eating here. so refrain yourself from Eau Chew..
if the current standard in maintained i would request you Don't Go.
will miss you Josephine Rice (R.I.P) :'(

Chimney soup was very good. We took medium sized soup and divided into 4. After having that our stomach was full. So we had to parcel all other foods ordered.  We also took Josephine noodles, Schezwan chicken and mixed fried rice  -taste of which were ok.  Delivery was fast, as we were the only customers.

Wow!!!¬† Its just amazing how they cook such delicious yet simple food. Don't be fooled by the somewhat decrepit-looking building and the ordinary interior. Once the food arrives, you won't notice anything else. Ever since I read the great reviews on Zomato, been wanting to go there and finally we made it for lunch few weeks back. Boy!!! it made my day. Playing it safe, we ordered chimney soup, Josephine's noodles plus chicken black beans and fried prawns. Every single item lived up to the place's reputation. The cooking is balanced, executed perfectly and by no means bland. The taste of each ingredient seems to come out distinctly and the portions are more than sufficient. The prices might seem slightly on the higher side but hey, you do pay as much at many other fancy yet ordinary restaurants. 

If you love Chinese food and haven't been to this place, you have missed something. I sure did all these years.

One of the most authentic chinese food served in the heart of the city.
I ended up visting this place with my brothers and those gluttons couldnt get enough of everything that was served.
We lost count of servings as the food was extremely delicious and lightly cooked...so strangely enough we still felt hungry.
The chimney soup is a must try, not only for the yum factor but also because they serve it in the authentic chimney vessel pot.
The decor isnt that great, neither is the hospitality. .the review is purely for the love of food. :)

What an amazing place for a die hard Chinese Food lover like me. Who bothers if the decor is well done or sitting area is cosy or presentation is attractive when food is so authentic and yammy.. Probably the oldest Chinese eatery in Kolkata. I ordered for Joshephine Noodle and Roast pork chilli. Both are outstanding and I am very very happy.

Coming back soon..

After reading such good reviews, decided to give it a try, but to be honest, i was disappointed with the outcome.
Ambience-When one is hungry, it doesn't really matters.????
Food-Ordered a dry chilli chicken, chicken noodles, chicken fried rice and garlic chicken. Considering quantity and size of pieces, way too costly. People chilli chicken is just fried chicken with green chillies and fried onion rings. Noodles very plain, and not tasty. Rice on the other hand was good. Garlic chicken was way too sweet and at one point i was confused whether i ordered for sweet n sour chicken or not. 
Place was literally empty except the two of us and another guy.
This place is overrated, except the fact that the food served is light and does not feel heavy.

Eau Chew is a fine dining set-up, old fashioned style.We have been to Eau Chew quite a number of times, thanks to my partner. We love their chimney soup and i've had my first pork with him here.The noodles and meifoons are okay, most of the pork preparations are not available most of the time,which is a set back for us. We are yet to try their specialties, fingers crossed. 

¬†The food is good, ambiance just perfect for a quiet meal.Prices are a tad bit high, but decent quantity and good quality makes it worthy. Service should be a little better - a little attention and a non-angry smiling waiter would be great.

Overall verdict: good food, authentic touch.Nice place for a formal eating-out.

An absolute delight. Tucked away in a small corner of Ganesh Chandra Avenue is the what I believe is the best Chinese in the city. What makes it special?
1. Hygiene - A stark contrast from its surroundings, the restaurant is one of the cleanest I've come across. I literally couldn't find a speck of dust anywhere. 
2. Recipes - None of that oily fried hakka azinomoto filled chow. This is as authentic as it gets. Barely any azimomoto, fresh ingredients and served with love. 
3. Pricing - I wouldn't say its cheap but it is definitely reasonably prices. We had some of the most expensive dishes and the bill was around 400 per head. This might seem like a lot but for the quality and quantity of food, it felt like a bargain. 
4. Ambience - Homely and quiet, it has the setting for a delightful family meal. 

This is the standard that restaurants should look up to. What a pleasure its been.

Well I happened to visit this place 2 days ago out of sheer luck and i wont say i was disappointed.I never read any reviews of it before going so I guess I missed big time on the Josephine noodles..but what I had was simply mind blowing.
We ordered eau chew spcl soup and wanton chicken for the starters..The soup was out of the world with just the correct amount of spices..the wantons although a bit over fried..never mind didn‚Äôt taste bad :P We followed it up with mixed Cantonese noodles,mandarin fish and garlic chicken; where amongst them..the fish tasted the best (I might say I am a bit biased with fish though) while the noodles and chicken was appropriate.
Coming to the d√©cor and the ambiance about this place.. I guess people have already mentioned it right.The place is well maintained by a family and yes they serve a bit late but I suppose that‚Äôs because of the care they put into their food :)

Looks can indeed be deceptive!
 Went to this place for the 1st time on a Friday afternoon. Had never heard of this place before until i was told about it by my brother.  Being a regular at Chinese restaurants like Mainland China and Chowman which not only excel in their food but also have an enchanting decor, i was initially  a little apprehensive on seeing the shabby exterior of this place. Cross a petrol pump, go up the dark narrow stairs and there you are! 

We ordered Chimney Soup, Josephine Noodles, Roast Chilly Pork, Flaming Chicken and Fish in Black Bean Sauce. I have to say i was bowled over by the taste of all the dishes. It had an authentic Chinese taste which is very different from the food in other Chinese restaurants of Kolkata. The fish preparation was the best, the fish was so well cooked with all the ingredients mixed in the perfect quantity. The service too is pretty quick which deserves a thumbs up!

However, the only thumbs down factor was the prawns in the soup and noodles which I felt were a little undercooked.

Nevertheless, all the dishes were ineffable to push aside one minus factor. All Chinese food lovers must visit this place to get a taste of the authentic chinese food. I would surely go back again! :)

Bingo such a hidden treasure of Chinese delicacies can only be found in my beloved city of joy KOLKATA. Located near chandni chowk metro n ganesh Chandra avenue this restaurant is run by a Chinese family. The place may look just like a dining room of typical old kolkata households, but the quality of foods are just awesome. Go there n order chimney soup - you will be spell bound not only by the way the dish is served but also by its divine taste. Once you have this soup you will be hungrier. Among the starters dry chilli chicken is awesome. The dishes are unique over here with a subtle touch of home cooked food. Basically I love almost all their servings. If not sure what to eat just ask the waiter to suggest n they will advise the best.

In sum place is a must visit for all the Chinise food lovers to taste authenticity.

The rating is given only for the food. This is family run restaurant on the first floor of a shabby building close to Air-India office.
the building may look very tacky but once you enter the place you'll see a very clean, cool and calm place. There in nothing special to mention about the decor. They do not have any service stuff,the family members only do the cleaning and serving. And they serve with love and warmth.
Coming to the food, the chimney soup they serve is just superb. In other places you get only a huge quantity of chimney soup that serves 4-7 person but they also serve a small portion pf chimney soup enough for two people.
Their fried chili pork is a must try, trust me you'll not even see a single layer of fat on their pork unlike other places. The mixed Cantonese noodles, dry garlic pork, Josephine noodles, meat ball soup and non veg wanton soup, spcl steamed rice, steamed and fried momo.... are just out of this world. They cook with the perfect combination of spices and oil that is not too spicy or oily but just perfect as magic. 
yes the service is bit slow as said earlier that they don't have any service stuff but serve themselves which makes the service a bit slow but i can wait for that great food to come on my place.
Price of the food is reasonable rather the quantity they serve in each dish is more than enough for two people to finish at one go.
one motre important point is that this place never stinks like other Chinese restaurants of china town or Momo Plaza or Tibetian Delights, you can be quiet sure about the quality of food they serve and also the hygiene factor.
This place is a must visit for Chinese food lovers.

Having read so many reviews of the restaurant below, pretty much most of them could be summed in five points:
1. Dont judge a book by its cover
2. looks can be deceptive
3. Classic Chimney soup
4. Josephine noodles
5. Very reasonable, super value for money

Not that my review is going to deviate much from the rest except for that i haven't tried their josephine noodles since i am a vegetarian, i think the place definitely deserves as much reviews possible coz of the great food its been serving for such a long time.

Located in Ganesh Chandra Avenue, at a 5 mins walk from Mission Cafe towards bentick street, one has a good chance at missing it. It is located behind a vehicle repairs station on the first floor with a shabby kind of stair leading up to this place which is quite a good seater with not so much of a decor. A first time diner would feel relieved after entering the restaurant and really contented once he eats his food. The service is pretty fast and staff are polite.

The restaurant is quite old and serves chinese food which is not like any other local chinese cuisine at these prices. The food is much more authentic, prices are very reasonable but the serving size is a bit less compared to a grub club, crystal chimney, buzz etc. The restaurant is not open all day but only during lunch and dinner hours. 

Coming to food, chimney soup is really good and should be tried only if in a group. I am yet to try its veg wanton soup since it has not been available couple of times i have ordered. Options in starters are pretty limited for vegetarians and fried chilli babycorn/ potato are not too much to my liking. The fried rice is pretty good especially the szechwan fried rice which is just lovely. The hakka noodles are really good with an exceptional quality of noodles being used in the preparation that adds to its taste. Noodles are a bit oily at times but the taste at this price is just unbelievable. The vegetables in black bean sauce is one of the best side dish in its menu in my opinion followed by sweet and sour vegetables, garlic manchurian. 

Overall, the place serves really nice food at very decent prices but the menu is a bit small plus it does not deliver in the vicinity. This is an old gem which is priceless and i do not think new joints can provide such food at such prices !!

i visited this resturant after hearing lot of good things. its a typical chinese resturant from old calcutta. When u will enter u can hear nice music from wind chimes. A bit small cafe like siting area. 
But the good things about it is food. I have orderd for roasted chili pork, Josehine rice, and honey lemon chicken. Food was excelent, especialy the rice. Portion size is good. Taste is excelent. In one word a classic place to try.

Euw Chew is a good restaurant. It is likely to be enjoyed more by those who go with an open mind. If your definition of good Chinese food is Bar-b-que's Chilli Garlic noodles - then you are likely to be left wanting. It has regular guests of oriental/chinese descent.
I tried the {famous?) Chimney soup and liked it. Didn't love it. But I enjoyed deviating from the norm of what is popularly considered Chinese food in India. The prices are cheap. Portions are good. No-fuss. I recommend a visit. Don't expect plush interiors. It may remind you more of a mid-range Tangra restaurant appearance-wise but the food is exquisite.

Eau Chew is located on Ganesh Chandra Avenue . I would suggest that you avoid taking your car as parking is a huge hassle. This place can easily be reached by the metro. Get down at Chandni Chowk station and exit Gate no 6. Walk on the same side for about 50 metres till you reach an abandoned petrol pump which is a car garage/repair shop and you can see it on 1st Floor.

Word of caution -- They are not open for Sunday Lunch. They do not accept debit/credit cards and there is no parking at restaurant or anywhere around. So take a cab or metro. 

We ordered for 4 adults -- Chimney Soup ( Medium), Spring Chicken half as started, Josephine Noodles, Mixed Cantonese noodles, Roast Fry Pork full and Garlic Fish half . The chimney soup was extra ordinary with fresh herbs and a subtle clear soup with vegetables and chicken.It was my most favourite soup in Kolkata till date. Spring chicken was crispy outside and moist inside. It looked more like a pakoda. Josephine noodles was great but I felt the amount of vegetables has reduced since my last visit. Pork was lean, spicy and cooked just right ! Fish too was fresh and zestful.

A big plus -- the portions are large. For side dishes - you have option of half plate ( 6 pcs) and full dish (12 pcs). Service is good. This place is very busy on weekdays for lunch, not so much in the evenings.  
We really enjoyed the food here. It is authentic Chinese, so some might find it bland. But its low on oil/grease and high on freshness.

Since many years i was in China i really wanted to taste some authentic and good original chinese food. I got to knw abt this restaurant from a TOI restaurant review. It was a little difficult to find this place in Chandni. From outside i really was not sure whether to go thre or not...an old house, its shabby staircase takes you to the entrance of this restaurant bt as soon as you enter this place a typical chinese aroma makes you happy...feel good....i ordered a chimney soup(small),fried chicken wanton, eau chew fried rice and a chicken pineapple. the chimney soup was jst like china's hot pot (huo guo) tastes awesum and its a typical chinese soup with chicken and sum leafy vegetable(i dnt knw the name)...fried chicken wanton was crispy yet sum moisture inside. eau chew fried rice flavour reminded me of my chao fen only this was less spicy....pineapple chicken was not tht good compared to others....
I liked this place coz still thre are few places available in kol whre u dont get calcatian chinese bt good authentic typical chinese....with all those aroma....
this place is a little expensive bt i dont mind as it gives u more or less the original flavour of china... :)

Heard a lot of rave reviews bout this place but it didnt meet my expectations at all..  We ordered the josephine's noodles, cashewnut chicken, fried chillypork, sweetand sour fish, pak choy, chilli chicken dry. The josephine noodles were the only edible thing which I could eat. I got of the place dissapointed and 1912 poorer. A very nice lady  Sits at the counter bt d food is just nt upto the mark.

- Chimney Soup is highly over rated!!! It is simply chicken-prawn clear soup poured in a fancy serving bowl. Also it is too expensive for what it really is.

- Food portions are quite small. So people with a big appetite should stay clear of Eau Chew!

- This restaurant closes as early as 10pm and doesn't serve any food after the closing time. So if you are late make sure you order in excess before closing time.

- Ambience is horrible. Decor is worse than minimal.

Been there very recently on a Wednesday afternoon. I thought it would be difficult to find the place but my HERE maps pretty much nailed the location. Its true the entrance to this place is uninviting, n one would have to walk through a garage to reach the entrance. But once inside the restaurant, things change radically. The place is big enough, with tables spread across the room and two big windows on either side letting in enough light.
We didnt go with the ones suggested in other reviews and didnt try the chimney soup nor the josephine noodles. Instead we had chili chicken dry which was a bit too spicy. However we ordered chicken rice noodles and it was great. We combined it with manchurian chicken and chicken in black bean sauce, n both the dishes were extremely good. The service is satisfactory and basically there is nothing to complain about this place. Definetly looking forward to coming here again soon.

Aah a nice old Chinese restaurant for Chinese lovers. Went here last month with one of my friend. The dishes we ordered are as follows -

1. Josephine Noodles- The recommended noodles available only at Eau chew. It is the most nutritious noodles i have ever had. All the tasteful nutritious components was filled in this dish. The unique noodles u cant find anywhere else

2. Schzewan chicken - This chicken was same as u wud find in other Chinese restro. But the taste was really good and was nicely blending with the noodles

3. Roasted Pork- The pork was really good with the right amount of spicyness.

Overall i wud give 3/5 to the service and 4/5 to the food

When anyone says ‚ÄòChinese‚Äô that rings a bell in my head. When I watched a show where the ‚ÄòHarsha Bhogle‚Äô bragging about this diner, I found it pretty appealing. But matter of fact I am not good at directions so I banged my head to get this place right. When I achieved my goal, I found a dingy building was standing before me. Instructions said they are on they are in the second floor, so I climbed up and I found myself in heaven (not literary). This place has a giant room for dining, you will find it very ordinary looking archaic. But authenticity was reflecting from every bit of it. 

We ordered fried chilly baby corn to start out feast. When it reached our platters, it was coated with burning spices, and a sprinkle of green celery made it picturesque. When my taste buds were still in trance of Chinese spices, we were served Mixed Cantonese Noodles and Garlic Pork. Believe me it was for me a roller coaster ride of taste. Pork gravy was hot enough to survive; the pork was tempered with balanced spices. The noodles was not that spicy but left a mark on taste palettes. 

 This place is run by a Chinese family, so they don‚Äôt use helping hands. So I figure out this can be a major reason for their pretty slow service, but it does not matter when you taste the result after longing for food. I am just waiting for another opportunity to land myself at the doors of this place, and taste their authenticity.

This place is outstanding. It is one of the most authentic Chinese Restaurants in Kolkata.
It is more like dining at home, as the restaurant ambience is such.

The Chilli Pork, Josephine noodles, Pak Choi are a must order!

I feel this place is a foodie's delight if one wants really good chinese food. It is not meant for people who want spicy and indianised Chinese food.

A quintessential example of why one should not judge a book by its cover, Eau Chau does not look assuming and inviting from outside. Inside, however, is a different picture altogether. The feel is retro and old Calcutta, an emptier version of Coffee House. One immediately feels comfortable and cozy inside the restaurant even though it does not sport the top notch look and feel of the modern Chinese eateries. 

The food is fantastic and the smell hits you as soon as you bend over the steaming hot dishes placed on the table by the steward. We had ordered chimney soup, jasmine noodles and fried chilli chicken and each dish held its own. The flavor was mild and beautiful, starting from the smoky flavor of the soup infused with herbs, chicken, prawn and fish. The noodles had gravy and this the light flavor of the chili chicken served as fantastic  accompaniment. 

The food is fantastic and the restaurant is definitely worth revisiti g. I plan to visit again this week and this time I would love to try the Hakka noodles and the chili pork.

As you ascend the narrow stairs of an old central kolkata leading to this restro you can not resist thinking what lies ahead.
but in sharp contrast the eatery is quite a large one with hardly any retro feel.

i visited the place on a weekday afternoon and it was empty. we ordered the eau chew soup, fried chilli pork, special noodle, mixed fried rice and chicken mushroom veg.
the soup was well prepared and had a good balance of flavours. the fried pork was the star of the show. it was spicy and the pork was perfect mix of fat and meat. its one of the best pork dishes i have had. the chicken mushroom n veggies also left its mark on my palate. the flavours complemented each other.

the rice was decent but the noodles was not cooked properly n felt kind of raw. 
the portions are almost adequate and the pricing is on the higher side. the general service can be improved.

on next visit will try out the much talked about chimney soup

I had heard very rave reviews about this place and decided to visit there one day. Unfortunately, was greeted at the entrance with a notice that they will be closed for two weeks due to some family functions.
But being the true foodie, I returned eventually, braving the bylanes of chandni chowk area...
I ordered chilli pork since I had heard that pork is good here. Portions were generous but I was dissappointed at the taste. It was chewy, not well seasoned and for the larger part was the pork fat which was a bit rubbery. There was also a weird red coloring in the pork.
The mixed gravy chowmein was decent and so was the chicken in garlic sauce (I think).
The ambiance was okay and gave me the feel of someone's living room converted to a restro with plastic chairs and tables which was probably true. The place was nicely illuminated and airy from the two windows which had nice lacy curtains.
The experiance was not really memorable for me since the food was a let down.

The Chimney Soup with friends on a cold winter night...heaven!
Ambience: Nothing to brag about here. But I must say that this restaurant is very spacious (though the seating arrangement is a bit unplanned I feel) and quite unpretentious and it exudes the warmth of the familiar 'parar morer' Chinese restaurant!
Service: The service is quite prompt.
Food: The small Chimney soup and it was more than enough for the two of us (3, maybe 4, can easily share the small one! And then there is the medium and the large, in which you can bathe I guess!)! And for Rs.300 it is an absolute value for money! The Eau Chew Mei Foon, at Rs.175, felt a wee bit overpriced. 
Recommendation: I was a big fan of Barbecue's Chimney soup but this beats it hands down!

P.s: This place does not accept cards (credit/debit) guys, so do remember to carry some cash!

This is a very highly rated restaurant.Having heard good reviews about this place,my mom and I had visited this place quite a while back now.I dont know if our expectations were a bit too high but although we were more or less happy with the quality of the food,but the overall experience could have been a bit better.

This place is located in Ganesh Chandra Avenue behind a petrol pump if I remember correctly.The entrance to the place is quite shabby.One would probably not want to try this place judging by the exteriors alone.But as the saying goes "looks can be deceptive"!

Yes,this place serves good quality food.The popular items of this place are the Chimney soup and the Josephine noodles.Since neither of us are great soup lovers and also because we thought the price of the chimney soup was quite high for a soup after all,we decided against it.We ordered a Josephine noodles and a chicken with pineapple and a prawn item which I dont exactly remember.The josephine noodles was really nice.It was tasty yet homely.It had a nice feel good feeling about it.The two side dishes were also good but none of them were really anything out of the ordinary.

Coming to the ambience and decor,it is very simple and minimalistic.It has a nice homely feel about it.The space inside is much larger than one would expect.The tables are quite nicely spread out.All in all apart from the shabby entrance the ambience is decent and homely.

The prices are on the higher side and comparable to other renowned restaurants.I felt considering the homely nature of everything about the place,the prices are a bit high.The service was a little slow.The place is a bit short on staff and man power.They sometimes refuse orders when it gets a little crowded.We suffered that fate once before.The staff was not the best trained and the person serving us was a bit rude even.That is a bit of a turn off.I am not the sort of person to give to much emphasis on service ambience etc.I feel food is and always should be the most important criteria but the staff just cannot be rude!!But I hope it was a one off incident.

Overall this place with its resources does an appreciable job in providing good tasty and yet homely Chinese food.The Josephine noodles is really good.But apart from that I felt the other items are just a little over rated and over priced.

Don't go by the entrance and the not-so-famous look of this restaurant people...there's something more to it inside. The ambience and above all,the food is just awesome. The Chimney Soup, Josephine Noodles and Fish in Black Fried Beans are a must try and not to be missed at all. It's the kind of place you would always want to get back to once in a while. Do not give it a miss ...Superlike!!

horrid!!terrible food!!!i knew authentic Chinese is not spicy,but i never thought it would be just boiled noodles in starchy water with boiled veggies!!!!never have i spent so much money on such worthless food.....such a sad waste it was!if that is what is called food in china i really see why the average chinese is so tiny and thin....no one can eat that and be satisfied!!i perfer ghar ka bana,highly indianised chowmein and manchurian to the rubbish they sell as food there!and mind you,i am no fan of spices, but i do prefer proper salt and non raw stuff!!
i dont know how the reviews say that this place is good or legendary,but i do know that i was thoroughly misguided and dont want any other person to go through the same trauma as me!
if you want good chinese go to kimli,or maybe tibetan delight.its cheap and much much better.and if you really want to eat here then you can recreate it by just eating some raw veggies and raw meat while standing in the fish market...the stench will mimick the environ perfectly,and the food is just that too!!!
my last two words to all - DONT GO!!!

Had heard a lot about this place serving authentic chinese food, but somehow never got to try it..finally a friend's father said if we wanted to have the best chinese meal in the city then we should try Eau Chew.He said he used to go a lot but in the past few years he had not got the opportunity..that was the last nail in the coffin..i had to try it..so me and my friends went a few days back..we read up the zomato reviews and preordered the sugarcane drumsticks,chimney soup,Josephine noodles, mixed schezuan noodles,garlic chicken and the host suggested the chicken in bean sauce...We entered the place at exact 12:00 pm..it was empty to our surprise..not a single soul in sight..we waited for about a good 10-15 minutes before someone came to even see us..we were seated..nice small cosy place..i never expected to get great ambience or service, and that was the case..and then came the food..first the soup..its totally over rated..i have had authentic chinese food..its not supposed to be over spiced but has to be flavourful.The soup we got was Bland..not a hint of flavour but a typical fishy smell emerged from it.We somehow added a lot of pepper and chilli sauce and had it. The noodles{both of them} looked as someone forgot to drain the starch water from the noodles and put it directly on the serving plate.The noodles were almost bordering on raw. The chicken in bean sauce was like leather.We kept on chewing on it like undercooked mutton. We had to leave the place with more than 60% of the food left untouched. If you are looking for good chinese stuff go to Tibetan delight or Haka..would cost you almost the same and you wont be left starving.I know Eau Chew is a legend for its grub..but if the current standard in maintained i would request you to give it a miss!!!!

Eau chew is 2 mins from my office and the first place my seniors cajoled me to try out right after I joined! and since then, I have been a pilgrim to this place. I have been ignored, rebuked at for ordering wrong combinations, refused entry 5 mins before opening time; but I have always been served great food!
chilli pork here is great...not as spicy as tibetian delight's, not as bland as blue poppy's. I find their chimney soup overrated. other than that, all the dishes are right on the money!

Like everyone else I had ordered Josephine noodles & Chilli pork ,two days in advance for a takeaway at 12noon. When I went there to place my order I was surprised by their warmth (going by earlier reviews that they are rude) and promptness. They take the pains of describing each dish to you , open the door for you when you leave and they don't charge any caution advance for an order placed in advance. When I reached there at 11.55 am half expecting the order to be ready I was further, pleasantly surprised to find my order not only ready, but also packed and piping hot!
Kudos to them for their promptness and the food was par excellence! the quantity was also satiating. The flavor reminded me of old Chinese restaurants of the 80's,my childhood, that dotted central Calcutta Will be returning for sure for the chimney soup which I missed this time.
much recommended it was a deja vu for me n may be for you too!

Experience of living in Kolkata and being Polish give me a conviction that my taste is very different from the Bengali one. What to say about Eau Chew? Is so far the best Chinese restaurant in town!!!!
Why? 
That's why:
- They serve original Chinese cuisine - not only they use their own recipies, but they also try to follow the "tradition",
- Their food is very different from Indian Chinese - is very Cantonese, full of real flavours, not only "chili chili chili", spices, spices, spices. I can HIGHLY recommend the Josephine Noodles! 
- They have awesome prices (comparatively cheap food) and very private, quiet atmosphere and beautiful table service!

If you are looking for a very original, but also very Chinese food - go to Eau Chew, you want be disappointed!

I simply don't know why i haven't been to this for so many days

Well, this is not a posh swanky chinese restaurant... if that s what you are looking for ... in fact the entrance is quite shabby and modest.

but what people come here for are the Josephine noodles and chimney soup . both the dishes are class apart. this is not spice loaded and soya sauce added chinese.... it is pristine... white and simple to the heart... happy food on a monsoon afternoon is what i call it .

going again soon ...

i didn't quite like the regular chili chicken dry... will stick to the above to hits but will go for sure again very soon

one of the older chinese restaurants in kolkata but surely serves the most good chinese. the place is a bit understaffed and the waiter may refuse orders if it gets too crowded. the roasted chilli pork is awesome. the best dish undoubtedly has to be the josephine noodles. though the chimney soup is pretty famous there but for people like me who tend to rely a lot on the aroma the strong fishy smell was hard to ignore. all in all a nice decent place which packs quite a punch.

this authentic chinese heritage of eating is awe-inspiring in the quality of food it serves the foodies. dont go by the looks. come to enjoy the delicacies of orient. the culinary skills come at their best in the chimney soup (signature dish), josefine noodles(named after madam josefine, mother of the now owner girl), prawn pakora,garlic fish, mixed cantonese noodles,and mixed schezwan fried rice. that being said. the meat ball soup, chilli pork and so many are nothng short of a photo finish to the first mentioned dishes. eat your heart out here if you love the taste of authentic chinese. service is pretty first although a bit of harsh behaviour from the daughter of madam josefine sometimes can be a problem. but that being said, that cant ruin the taste of their dishes. just bon appetit and do write about if you try dishes not so popular (like flaming fish) and find that to be as majestic as the so called popular choices.

this award winning eating house is hidden away behind a steps and a garage on ganesh Chandra avenue.....
but the standards have fallen..... since the marriage of the main manager abroad the quality of food has suffered. I will think 4 times before going back. 
But of you haven't had chimney soup then you have to go there..... there is no alternative. 
mind you it's not very cheap

This place is Legen-wait for it- DARY! I've read all the reviews here so far and find it unbelievable that there's no mention of their SPECIAL stuff! Before you visit this place, please CALL joseph or josephine up (24 hrs in advance) and ASK them to whip up their specialities for you. They have a wonderful starter which is essentially, a drumstick - made of a mix of miced chicken and prawn, and instead of the bone, you have a sugarcane stick! Very innovative and VERY tasty! Also, do not miss out on the whole fish that they serve! It is mindblowingly briliant!

Special mention to the Pork Ball soup which I also tried recently. The subtle broth and the simple yet heavenly flavour will keep you dreaming about this place!

Please try these 3 dishes and if you like it, LIKE/follow this post, so I can know how well I did at spreading the love!

Chimney soup, Josephine noodles and chilli pork, these were the items that I ordered, and I loved the chilli-pork. Frankly speaking, after reading a lot of reviews I went to this restaurant for some authentic Chinese food. But I hated the Josephine noodles and Chimney soup. 

Maybe my tongues are not programmed for authentic Chinese dishes. The raw cooking style did not suite me. The chimney soup was served in an unclean chimney and the meat was too raw for my liking. 

Once again, I loved the chilli-pork as it was properly 'cooked' with oils and spices, unlike the Josephine noodles which seemed like a half cooked Chinese Khichdi.

Eau Chew retains much of its old charm. The crumbling exterior has been somewhat improved with a larger sign and some lights, and the rickety staircase replaced by one of concrete.

Went there as part of a group of three on a Sunday evening and ordered the chimney soup (small size) and a plate of roast chilli pork. The chimney soup was good, but I missed the impressive way in which the medium and large-size soups were served - half the fun of having that soup was taking off the huge chimney and ladling it out.

The chilli pork was good, and we wanted a plate of the Josephine Noodles that had been recommended to us by friends. Unfortunately, it was not available and we had to make do with chicken noodles (hakka style), which was average. We also wanted darsan, but was told that it was not available.

The place was almost empty - a total of seven people in three groups, with the rest of the tables empty. The service was quick and the waiter polite, but we had chosen dishes that wouldn't take much time.

All things considered, a good place to eat. The management might consider ensuring that all the items on the menu are always available.

One of the few restaurants left in the city which serves Chinese food as close as it can get to its authentic counterpart. The entrance is a shoddy one located within a walking distance of 1 minute from the crossing of Central Avenue towards the Ganges, inside a garage. Even though they open at 11:30 it is best suggested to visit at around 12 p.m. since that is when the restaurant begins its actual function and in case you enter  before 12 p.m. you can sit and have some time to just sit down on those extremely comfortable cushioned chairs with an iron frame. What I noticed was I was the first customer and they were busy cleaning the place. The place must be mentioned above all for its cleanliness. The decor is neat and clean. There are square shaped tables for four people and round tables for six. Being housed in a very old building the room does not even need air-conditioning but the moment I sat down they closed the windows and switched on the air-conditioner even though I was all alone. Having had the most authentic Chinese food including the chimney soup from the now defunct Hau Hua formerly located on Free School Street all my life till they shut the doors forever in 2007 the Chimney soup did not seem a novelty and I opted for the Josephine rice and Fried Roasted Pork. The place is well lit and the Chinese wind chimes murmur away softly. There are a few Chinese paintings on the wall and a clock which probably is as old as the restaurant or even older. The menu was one suitable for days when you feel like a King or those when you feel like a pauper. Their specialties is within the range of Rs300 to Rs600 The normal range is within Rs110 to Rs140 for the staples and 280 to 340 for the side dishes. It is worth mentioning  that they still offer half plate and full plate servings at half the cost for side dishes and starters which is a relief for lone customers  such as myself. My food arrived within a reasonable 7 minutes and it was only when I have had my first bite into the roast pork that I knew I had to revisit the place for nowhere would you find such soft succulent and juicy pork sliced paper thin. The onions and mild spiciness added to the flavour and did wonders for your taste buds. The Josephine rice from their special menu was a delight to see a bowl full of vegetables and meat gravy covering the bed of rice underneath it.  With the generous quantity my lunch and supper had been taken care for the day. The rice is delicious with cauliflowers , carrots, beans, black mushrooms, baby corn ,meat and rice complimenting each other. The complete non-oiliness and delicious amalgamation of rice wine vinegar (which I can vouch for since I use it at home and know the special taste it is responsible ) and stock of chicken with just the right amount of garlic and ginger paste etc made my lunch worth remembering. At the beginning of my meal I found it a bit strange that the rice alone even though a specialty  cost Rs300 but then with every bite and the quantity in front of my eyes I realized how appropriate it was. Drop in for this restaurant's delicious home cooked Chinese fares if you like your Chinese food to be simple , non oily , non spicy.                                                         The mild disappointment is that even after mentioning that I wanted the prawns to be left  out due to my unfortunate allergy there were enough prawns to make prawn lovers very happy when the dish was served and instead my pork was missing in the Josephine rice. As I was about to start my lunch the service person apologized for his mistake on his own which is commendable but when I mentioned I was allergic and wanted the prawns removed he obliged but did not add the pork which I had wanted and which was due in the dish. I am going back next Monday and when are all you lovely people dropping in at this place? I must make a special mention of its crockery which one can associate with the Chinese porcelain  of white floral images on a white base of heavy weight porcelain. To support my claim I have the entire 1/4th  floor of The prince of Wales Museum in Bombay with its Chinese Porcelain displays.

How I find it is a story.
On a summer evening I was searching for some fuel after a whole day search for a suitable new laptop for my friend in Chandni C area. I was very hungry and stopped by this not-in-service pump for some petrol, obviously no luck!
I saw the board of Eau Chew, it didn't impressed me at-all, but I was hungry.

I boarded in this restaurant and surprised that we are the only visitor that time. We ordered what ever is best as per the owner's thoughts. 

You wont believe, The food was extraordinary! 
The Chimney Soup, Josephine Noodles ,Chilli Pork, Mushroom Chicken, just mouth watering!
The owner told us their history
After that visit I have made number of successful & failed attempt to visit that place.

I can bet that in Chandni C area, no one can serve you better authentic chineese that EC.

Go for it. You will love this place forever but do call them before you reach that place.

So the thing is if you happen to find Eau Chew finally and looking at the old building from outside and denying your "let me go back " instinct you step forward and then you are on the stairs and you are asking yourself  "Are you sure its not going to be ghostly experience?" and you still deny it, climb on and finally you are in front of it. Step in into a light white room not so ghostly anymore, good lord! Seriously its hard to believe from outside that it even exists. I remember when I found it I asked myself  "Are you sure its the same Eau Chow you are looking for?" Hahah, so conquering self-doubts I stepped in and sat down, a big light white room with round white and rectangular tables spread across. It seemed peaceful.
I ordered Cantonese Noodles with Seafood and Chicken Schezwan. I ordered Schezwan Chicken specially to compare it with the others I've tried before, well Cantonese Noodle was a pleasant surprise. Its a completely different way of handling noodles, the noodles are par boiled and then deep fried (that's what my experience tells me), then served with blanched and fried vegetables, carrots, cauliflower, seafood. It was something new to me and as I dig in I discover the simplicity of the dish. Its Chinese and it was not loud and shouting, it was so subtle and light, the crispness of the vegetables, the mushroom, the prawns, thriving on their natural flavor and the flavor of the vegetable oil comes from the crisp noodles (I know the sense of the excess oil can freak someone out including me but not this time!). Here the flavor of the oil gets lifted with the Fried Noodles, the dish completely thrives on simple subtle flavors and this is not what comes to our mind when we think Chinese, right! Try Cantonese Noodles and you will know. It is a lot to eat, 2 person can eat completely satisfied with 1 noodle. A completely different noodle preparation and it made me happy.
Next was Chicken Schezwan, it was again very different from anything I have ever tasted in any place so far. In most places Schezwan is a very spicy and hot dish, robust flavors rule this dish but here it was much milder. The chicken pieces were juicy, the gravy less spicy and tasted completely different and homely. Yes you read it right! I can not say if it contained the original Schezwan Peppers but I enjoyed it. I wont call it superb, not even great but it was good but there is a surprise, the chef forgot to put salt in the chicken, hahah! I couldn't believe this, so I seasoned it and then I came to realize how it actually tastes, funny huh! Thank god it wasn't at least over-salted. When I told the young girl at the counter "the chicken was good but he forgot to put salt in it" her eyes immediately lifted up in surprise.
This place is dipped in history, its very old, still maintained by the same family and this is as close to authentic Chinese I've experienced so far without going to China (whatever we most eat as Chinese is Indo-Chinese). Sitting inside the room you see the photos of the family members hanging in the wall, it feels as if its part of a film, an old good film. Its a different feeling. I didn't feel I was in a eating house just doing business. It was being a little part of the heritage of this family sharing through its food. Food being a vital part of life.
There was a young girl at the counter and her behavior made me feel funny. She was weird and smart and typical teenager in a conversation with a group of eaters, while I was gobbling my food, she said "My mother works so hard from morning to night, hardly sleeps for 5 hours, wakes early, shops everything, prepares everything, then again prepares for the evening session, we r trying our best to run this place smoothly. She works so hard."
Now we all know how tiresome and testing cooking can be, that too at this scale. This place represents an old time still ticking that its flavor and I do appreciate all the hard work going every day behind a simple delicious meal. As for the young girl she was a bit rude to one particular customer and for that she was even scolded by the daughter of that person (hahha). So many things happened while I was there, so more more than food.
I would love to go there again and again, first for the food and then for tradition. I look at this place in a different way, good food served with history, one issue, they are closed on Saturday & Sunday! Seriously! That's when I eat more outside.
The big white room  feels more homely, its decent and clean, just another big homely room, nothing fancy, no glitter, think simple.
As for the price its slightly on the higher side and its a great place to go in groups in that way you can order lots of various dishes and enjoy together because some of their quantities are pretty big, so eating alone can be testing for dear stomach.
This place has so much going against it, the outside look of the building, the stairs(stairs of doubt I call them), still it surprises you and gives u something more than food. So if you are thinking whether you should go or not i'll push you and say - "hey there conquer those stairs of doubt and enjoy good food..:) I'm going there very soon again, so for all of u Bon Appetit!

"Don't judge a book by its cover " is a phrase that comes to my mind the minute I think of Eau Chew ! This place is part of the foodie history of gastronomic Kolkata !! If anyone likes good authentic Chinese food this is a place you cannot afford not to go to ! I had a wonderful meal at Eau Chew a few days back .... my association with this Eatery is special because it was a great favorite of my parents and both my maternal and paternal grandparents also frequented it. I am the third generation of my family to patronize this establishment run by the fourth generation of the Huang family ! To this day they team of Mrs Josephine Huang and her son Joel and his wife Doren do every bit of work from purchasing of the food items , to the preparation and all the cooking entirely themselves. The stairs that lead up to the restaurant have been repaired and cleaned up and though the building is not in best shape the inside is spic and span. There are some old paintings and basic red sunmica tables and chairs but I go to Eau Chew for the food not the ambiance which is very simple. 

Our meal consisted of some special items that need to be pre - ordered like Prawn and Pork SuiMai , Pork Spare Ribs , Chicken Satay along with the famed and my favorite Josephine Noodles named after Mrs.Josephine Huang and their Chimney Soup along with a Chicken in Chilli Bean Sauce. What I missed and want to go back for is the Roast Chilli Pork which is always excellent. The high point of my dinner was however seeing Joel Huang prepare the Josephine Noodles and click some pictures of his mother and him in action in the kitchen for my blog. A special thankyou for that privilege to them.

I have to say that the Chicken Satay was absolutely outstanding.... perfectly cooked chicken that was moist, juicy and delicious served up on a sizzling platter and dramatically flambed at our table ..... yummy stuff. The Chimney Soup is always lovely especially on a December evening and I love the delicate flavor of the broth. The Josephine Noodles are simply wonderful actually a meal in themselves... lovely starchy thick noodles topped with a mixture of vegetables perfectly cooked retaining the crunch and chicken. The stir fried Chinese Greens we were served were also delicate and lovely and the Chicken in Chilli Bean Sauce was nice as well though to be honest the Noodles as always stole the show. The Chilli Pork is juicy and tasty and one of the best in the city and I missed having it this time , the special Josephine Noodles with its distinctive flavors goes perfectly with the Roast Chilli Pork and is a combination I highly recommend.There is also a selection of vegetarian items with vegetarian versions of the signature dishes the Chimney Soup and Josephine Noodles available. Unlike a lot of Indian Chinese places the food is not oily and every dish is made and served fresh. The restaurant is only open for lunch and dinner so please check the times before visiting to avoid disappointment. 

This is a place I would recommend all foodies pay a visit too .... alas there are too few left and most have disappeared between the onslaught of modernization and the glamour of so called fine-dining. However the rustic but hearty yet surprisingly delicate flavors and the magic of recipe handed down through four generations will always hold a special charm for me.

One of the oldest Chinese restaurant in India, Eau Chew is still run by the same family and everything from cooking to serving is done by them. As a result they have managed to keep the same taste and standard. 

The must try items are Chimney Soup, Josephine Noodles and Chilli Pork. A small chimney soup can easily satisfy four people and the soup container had a chimney in the middle with burning coals inside to keep the food warm. The tasty soup is loaded with meat, prawns and vegetables. The Joshephine Noodles (named after Joshephine Huang who still is in charge of the kitchen) is a meal in itself. Boiled vegetables, meat, prawns, mushrooms and loads of them heaped over the steaming boiled noodles with light gravy. 

The place is a bit difficult to find. The decor is simple. But the food is great. Amount of food served per plate is huge so bigger the group lesser will be the cost per head.

I get a craving for Eau Chew at times, when I want to eat the Chimney Soup and it is winter. A big pot of steaming soup come in for four or five people, and you have to use a ladle to pour some of it in your bowl, add the condiments of your liking and slurp away. I have blissful dreams about the Josephine noodles and the roast pork too. But then again, I have always found Eau Chew to be unpretentious, taste-oriented and truly one of the few great places that has kept up its great standards for years.

Eau Chew...It was suggested to me by a friend and I decided to check it out.It took me and a friend quite a bit of asking people around and getting nowhere before we finally found it. Located in an abandoned petrol pump, it looks shady and you might find yourself ill at ease before you enter. Take the steep flight of stairs and you will find yourself in a large room which is pretty neat and very spacious. The lesser you try to talk to the waitress cum owner, the better it is if you do not want a bruised ego, she's usually cold and at times outright rude. On one occasion I made the mistake of visiting the place with my brother on a Sunday afternoon and finding the door closed my brother tried to get adventurous and rang the doorbell, the lady who I knew to be the owner/waitress opened the door and after having curtly made her point that it is not open for lunch on sundays, we had the door slammed on us.I had made a point with my brother as I had warned him earlier of her far from polite demeanour. They serve authentic chinese food. The Josephine noodles is a knockout with generous portions of meat and veggies along with a certain smoked flavour and the roasted Chilli Pork is an absolute stunner..It cannot be classified as cheap considering the Rs. 330/- and upwards price of the Josephine noodles, although one cannot deny that you would savour every bit of the food that is served to you, the food may seem a little bland to some people but think about it, authentic chinese is after all not the super spicy dishes we have in regular chinese restaurants..Talk Less Eat More, ENJOY..

Before I start mentioning the quality of food, I should write about the service. People expecting just a 3 star service should not come to this place. We, however, went to this place in search of good chinese food and we were more than satisfied. The chimney soup(small) can easily serve 3-4 people. I am wondering how many people can the large portion serve. Coming back to the quality, the chimney soup was light and tasted nothing less than lovely. The Fried roast chilli pork was the softest pork I have tasted in Kolkata. The ingredients used were fresh and left a beautiful aftertaste. We were full after having the food but it was not the uncomfortable full feeling that is generally offered by other chinese restaurants

Firstly Thank you Zomato for introducing me to this place! If I hadn't read the reviews, may be I would not have ventured into the place.
The building looks dingy from outside, but once you are inside it is extremely neat and peaceful; great for people who prefer chatting over background music during eating.
If you care too much for service as one of the yardsticks to measure the quality of restaurant, revise the mindset before visiting Eau Chew. This places promises no polite service or excellent ambiance, only good food, no frills attached.
The Chimney Soup is excellent. Its a very light clear soup and even the small serving suffices for 3 people.
Fried Roast Pork Chili was one of the best pork preparations I have tasted, less fried and more roasted. The Szchewan Chicken and Eau Chew Fried Rice was pretty good.
One thing for sure you will not get the uncomfortably full feeling that you get from eating out at some places, you will just be a full and happy eater!

Eau Chew is more about nostalgia and of old Calcutta. However, down the years the quality has dropped nil. I went with my dad, who had no problems spotting in in a dingy building, and he spoke about coming here many years back. If you want authentic Chinese, come here

The menu offers little variety. However, the food is brilliant. Chimney Soup is a must try, especially with fish meat. You could also try pork in you choice of sauce. The Noodles are also also cooked. MUST VISIT!

If you know your food history, you'll know how many times this small Chinese restaurant on GC Avenue has been reviewed. I remember reading a review about Eau Chew on an onboard flight magazine, not to mention newspapers and numerous other national magazines... The food is clearly a must for the Kolkatan Chinese lover. When talking to the owner on one of my visits I was told that apparently Vijaya Mallya orders his food from here when he's in town! Im sure right now Mr. Mallya's bitten off more than 'e' can chew.. he he (PJ I know!) 
Anyway back to the food. 
Its the chimney soup you need to be trying and thats what Eau Chew is famous for. Period. It is one of the oldest running Chinese Restaurants in Kolkata and people across the world come here for the Chimney Soup. The interiors and restaurant itself are still stuck in a time warp, as is the building which houses the restaurant located on the second floor. I would necessarily like to sit and eat here, especially with family. However you must try this place. A piece of history which I fear may not last long.

I'm in love with this taste bud arousing Chinese home restaurant run by the Huang family. Trust me on this. Their noodles are extraordinary. Try Josephine noodles or Eau Chew special noodles with Garlic Chicken or Chilli pork. Their flaming chicken is awesome. Their food is fresh, healthy, delicious & cheap.
Peaceful & nice interior, service is good but don't try to interact much with the waitress cum Huang daughter as she is cold, & rude sometimes.
