Tired of shopping and when the stomach is dying to have good food with pocket friendly menu, behala cafe is the perfect place! Dry chilly chicken is a must try!

Super affordable cafe . Though the location is bad(above the sulabh complex at behala tram depot), but the price and the quality of food makes up for it. One can get a cup of latte coffee at Rs 25 which is unimaginable these days. Tried their dry chilli chicken and chicken fry. Chicken fry was okayish but the chilli chicken was too delicious.

If you are in the centre of behala ,watch your top. Behala cafe is the right place to stop in. Short space with 1or 2  workmen, but air conditioned.

A quaint little cafe beside the AC market in behala tamdepot. Many have pointed out that it is situated on top of a pay and use toilet but trust me the place is clean and very well managed. Decided to drop in with a friend for a quick coffee. Orderd capucinno and fish orly. The coffee was just perfect but did nit like the orly that much. Saw a lot of good reviews so not judging it by a single visit. Will try other items on the menu soon and then only i'll give a full fledged review.

This place is situated just beside the Behala A.C. market in Tram depot. As many of them has already mentioned, this place is situated just above a public toilet. Yes but don't always go by the look from outside. This place is pocket friendly. Affordable. Ambient is most of the times empty as it is a newly opened café in Behala. Nice place to hangout with friends. The coffee is okay but the food they serve is fresh and delicious. The service is also good. These people are very humble. Have already visited their café 4-5 times with friends. Hope to visit this place more number of times.

Who knew that a café on top of a public toilet be so good? That was my exact reaction after coming out of Behala Cafe. 

This cafe is located in Behala Tramdepot, in the place  from where trams used to venture out in the past. It is just on top of a public toilet. One has to climb up the stairs to reach the cafe. The interior of the cafe has simplistic design,and is quite spacious with a good number of tables and chairs. The staff was one person who was  serving and doin everything else except cooking. 

Coming to the food, I ordered one vegetable fried rice, one chilli chicken and one moccachino. The food took ten minutes to arrive. The fried rice was prepared well with different vegetables and tasted delicious. The. quantity was also huge. Thr chilli chicken was nicely prepared and had 8 pieces of boneless chicken in it. There was no presence of extra batter and this impressed me. Thr chilli chicken went well with the fried rice. At last, the moccachino came. It was the perfect ending to the meal. 

All in all, a great experience and I will visit again.

This place took me to a surprise when I went there for the first time. One of the reasons for my surprise is that I didn't expect the food to be so good. Sometimes you can't guess things right looking at the ambience. Well, this place has recently opened and the location is just too good. Its located just in the centre of Behala Tram Depot Market and one of the easy places to find.

Ambience:
Its simple with tables and chairs, no decor, clean and hygienic. Well sometimes simplicity works. Well, the lights can be little brighter for a better experience.

Staff:
A lone warrior working and nailing the job. As the place is mostly empty there is only one person doing everything. What i liked is that he is very attentive and knows his task well. The person is courteous and well behaved.So full points for him

Food:
Well, the first thing which will make you happy is the price of each item mentioned in the menu. You get a Cappuccino at 25/- and there is no tax as well. 
I tried their Fried Chicken which is really good. The Chicken Hakka Noodles was okay with a bit more oil in it. The quantity of chicken chunks was impressive. The coffee was okay but you wont get a better coffee at that price anywhere else in the world.

Pros:
Very Reasonable Price
Good Staff Behaviour
Nice Food
Easy to Locate.

Cons:
Located just above a public toilet.

Well 3.5/5 for this place.

Please do not be repelled by the position of this place just above a public toilet. This is a great place which remains empty most of the times. No, that definitely does not mean it is a bad place. This is one of those places to have endless long chats. You could carelessly spend a couple of hours here or more. The food is good too. Mainly, it's very cheap.

A perfect meal over chat would be Moccacino, A cup of hot chocolate, a plate of dry chilli chicken or cheese chicken balls as you please.

The price of coffee is super cheap. You get cappuccino or a Moccacino in just 25 bucks and hoy chocolate in 20 bucks. 

No extra taxes.

05/04/16 Visited there today with mom this new outlet is very nice, though small still spacy. Decor is very simple which makes the ambience nice. Coming to food, really I must say one can eat delicious foods all they want when running a little low on their pocket.
In one word this should be under student friendly list.
I will be happy to visit again.
