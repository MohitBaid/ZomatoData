Location and Description: This place is near the Bata more at the Wellesley. You can have a complete taste of Chinese flavours here with very pocket friendly cost.

Ambience and Staff: Its a very small outlet with lots of variety to offer you. No sitting arrangement. just a bench for you to seat. Staff there making the stuffs are sound, listens to you properly what you wants.
.
Food: I went here for a small lunch purpose.. Thou i intended nothing much to eat so I went for a veg fried rice only..
It took 10 mins for my parcel to get ready. I expected a lot from them but lastly very disappointed. The rice was not well cooked, the flavor was very absent in the dish, and not getting any sort of feeling of fried rice. Though quantity was a satisfactory.

QNQ & Prices: Quality of the food is not at all upto the mark so is the quantity. Prices are cheap but stuffs are not worth those bucks also.

Conclusion: Nothing to tell about this place but its just good enough for the flying customers to have some Fast Food dishes. The food quality is not so good. Go with Less expectations.
Note: The review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.
