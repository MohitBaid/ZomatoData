লেক টাউন এর কাছে এই মিষ্টান্নটি তে এক বারই খেয়েছি । বেশ ভালো স্বাদ । মানেও বেশ ভালো । বিশেষ করে যেটার কথা বলতে হয় সেটা হল মিষ্টি দই । মিষ্টি প্রেমিরা একবার ঢুঁ দিতেই পারেন ।

This small sweet confectionary is located at Lake Town, Kolkata.

Service is quick with well behaved staffs.

Tried their Misti doi & Chamcham. Both were nice & fresh but still nothing to rave about.

Pocket pinch is reasonable.

Serves the need of local people pretty well.

Located adjacent to the Lake Town-Jessore Road crossing, this is a sweet shop that has been there since my birth. The staffs are very friendly. The milk products are quite fresh. The only con is that it isn't that much hygenic. The flies sit on the sweets inspite of having the net-doors. However, the misti doi and rabri turns out to be my favourite. Their chom chom and sankha misti is brilliant too. On particular occasions, they sell some special sweets with the event name inscribed on it which turns out to be best-sellers. Slightly overpriced though.

I find their Rabri to be very pleasant and tasty.  Within the neighbourhood of Lake Town, Kalindi and Bangur, Shree Krishna definitely stands out. Give it a try if you have a sweet tooth.
