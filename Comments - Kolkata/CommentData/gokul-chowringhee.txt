Located beside the Lord Singha road, this is a traditional sweet shop. Love their motichoor ladoos and the rasgollas. Though the prices are bit high but the sweets are very yummy.

This wonderful sweet shop joint is located at Rabindra Sadan Crossing going towards Minto Park. Its not just a sweet shop but certainly more than that. Rather than their great sweets this place has lot of food and drinks to offer you.
Went there with couple of friends tried their Tea, coffee and Burgers and Sandwiches. Everything was so amazing with the taste.
One of the most better vegteterian places Kolkata.

This is a very well known and popular sweet shop with a variety of traditional Sweets like motichoor ladoos and kaju katlis but they're masters of innovation as well. They reinvent the old sweets and give it a modern twist and turn. Lovely. This shop is in demand for people who order in bulk on festive occasions or marriages to send to friends and relatives. I've had sweets from here innumerable times and loved them all. Their rasgollas and Raj bhogs too are very good. This time had ghewar from there. Both the types of ghewar were good but the malai one was just too good!! 
But staff behaviour is not always good probably because they are swamped by work or rather they are more eager to attend to those customers placing bulk orders.

Want great sweets? Just visit this place! A varitey of sweets, and many new creations, that butterscotch laddoo, that was my favourite of them all! The rates are decent, I can't complain about the rates as I like the quality and service very much. Lovely to be here, keep up the good work.

This place is a renowned sweet shop of kolkata.They deal mainly in sweets and Namkeen in which they serve huge variety.Especially the sweets(mithai) variety they sell is hard to find with any seller.Their innovation with sweets is praiseworthy.

Service-The service at this place is very poor.Different staff at this place quote different prices of the same product and take a lot of time in packaging.But on the positive side,they prepare the sweets instantly if it goes out of stock anytime and is very punctual at delivery of sweets.

Food-Their sweets varies from season to season.We have tried almost all the sweets at this shop and found it excellent with the taste and concept but its too pricey.Some of the recommendation from this place is their-
1:Butterscotch ladoo
2:Sitaphal Sandesh
3:Butterscotch satu
4:Nareal Rabri

Service-3.5/5
Food-4.5/5

You must try the recommended sweets of this place as they have a dab hand on it.ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ

I just had a couple of sweets and got a few vadapavs from here so the review is just based on that. It's at a prime location so I think it'll attract customers irrespective of anything but I didn't like the quality of the sweets much. The vadapavs were okayish, I've had way better before in Kolkata, that's how I'm gonna put it.
