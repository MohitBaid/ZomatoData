In the search of trying new place at pocket friendly price, my experience with wow burger certainly didn't go so "wow". Availed the services of swiggy to taste the following:-

1. Chicken popcorn - Ordered a full plate of it which basically consisted of ready made chicken pops which you get of venky's/mccains etc. It only had 8 small chicken pops. Really disappointing for the price paid.

2. Fish fry - Medium sized ready made basa fillet which you get it from super mart. Tasted as a frozen ready made fish fry should be. Nothing to comment upon!!

3. Chicken mayo sandwich - This just summed up the whole disastrous meal. Barely grilled on both the sides with generous stuffing of shredded chicken,onion & mayo. But the whole sandwich wasn't cut into 2 & the stuffing lack proper seasoning. A very lazy & poor attempt to serve a basic dish!!

You won't get decent quality for the price being paid. Nonsense of an outlet.

For delicious food you gotta check out "WOW Burger". The quality of food at reasonable price is awesome and the staffs are friendly. Especially the Egg Burger is irresistibly delicious. WOW Burger, please open an outlet in Barasat too. So we can have it again and again.
All the best to " WOW Burger " And it's owner for taking the finger food business in new level.

WOW is what came out from my mouth. Delicious, mouth-watering, appetizing in such a hygiene environment.¬†
Chicken Burger ¬†is extremely toothsome .

Awesome food quality at reasonable price. Momo and burger's delicious test will take you new level of joy in the heart of Kolkata. Quality with guaranteed test are the synonymous meaning of their success. I have visited many food shops but haven't got the better quality momo. They are the top knot in their business within the area of Jadavpur.

Had Burger which is really best at its price range in and around Jadavpur. WOW BURGER , ia a small but very neat and clean outlet. For a change from regular food Burgers from this outlet can be a better option. All the luck to Wow Burger.
