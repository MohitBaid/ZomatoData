My visit to this place was quite good .. The decor is nice and the best part is the fantastic music which they play continuously .. Their playlist is quite good .. Ordered cafe latte , mocha, singhara, chicken sandwich , along with chocolate n mango mousse .. Order came in about 15 mins . Food and drinks were good . Service was good and staff was quite courteous .. Nice place for hangouts between office ...
