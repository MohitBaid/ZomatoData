The Poddar Court area has a pretty sizeable Chinese community, and as a result, a good number of small Chinese eateries serving great Chinese fare without burning a hole,in your pockets. D'Ley is one such joint, located in the busy Poddar Court area. A small place, it is very easy to miss it if you aren't actively on the lookout for it. The interiors aren't much to speak of either. With just a few tables, it was a seating capacity of about 20 or so. 

Then came the food, the highlight of the entire experience. We started off with crispy chicken wontons and the interestingly named Saturday Chicken. The wontons were classic and just as they should be, crispy on the outside with succulent chicken on the inside. The only downside? A bit too greasy. The Saturday chicken turned out to be pieces of chicken coated in thin wonton strips and deep-fried. These were delicious too, the crisp of the wonton contrasting well with the still-juice pieces of chicken. Both dishes were served with a hot chilli sauce which helped to cut through some of the grease and made it even better.

Moving onto mains, we ordered a pepper chicken, a roast chilli pork and pork phai kut. The pepper chicken was a flavour-bomb and loaded with the heat of pepper. It might be a little too to hot to handle on its own but tasted marvellous combined with the rice and noodles. The roast chilli pork, thew signature and must-have dish of all Chinese eateries like this one, was pretty good too. Lean meat with not too much fat, sweet onions and crispy bell peppers, it was a pretty good chilli pork, albeit not the best one I've had yet. The Pork phai kut, basically pork ribs, on the bone, in a sauce which I guess is mostly based on oyster sauce was pretty good too, although I found this dish to be the weakest of the three. We paired these dishes with a plate of rice and a plate of noodles. Both were good, but I tended to like a the flavour of the noodles just a little bit more.

Service is quick and unpretentious,, just as you would expect in a place like this. And the value for money is out of this world, again very characteristic. If you are in the area and looking for a place other than Tung Nam to try out some good ol' Chinese food with an emphasis on pork, D'ley is a good place to try out. Recommended.

D'Ley - Horrible Experience. 
=====
Intro & Location:

D'Ley is a very old chinese eatery. The ambiance of the place is very ordinary and nothing great. It has just 4-5 tables for serving the customers. 

It is situated in Poddar Court Area and very near to the Pou Chong Sauce Factory. I had been crossing by this place with my mom and i was craving for some good soup. 
=====
What we had:

• Chicken Manchow Soup - The manchow soup was served quite nicely. However, while eating the soup, i had observed that it had a fly in it and also the chicken pieces were quite hard to chew even though the soup was served piping hot. What i believe is that they had kept the chicken pieces for maybe few days? I had called the waiter and specifically showed it to him the fly and he was not agreeing to the fact. 

Just after sometime of relentless argument, he agreed and somehow went inside to get me some more soup. I told him to add less of garlic and green chilli. However, what he did was he just added some more soup gravy to the chicken soup which i sent him for changing without replacing the whole thing and it did not make any big difference. Such a thing is not at all acceptable. 

• Veg Hakka Chowmien - The Chowmien was fine. 
=====
Cons: 

• Bad hospitality with a 'Don't Care' kind of attitude.
• Just ordinary ambiance.
• Ordinary seating arrangement. 
=====
Meal for two: 400-700 approximate. As we took just chowmien and soup, it costed us around 200 bucks. (Prices are subject to change due to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, etc.) 
=====
Summary: 

Taste 3.5/5
Quality 3.3/5
Ambiance 3/5
Hospitality 0.5/5
VFM 2.5/5
=====
Conclusion: 

Hospitality does matter to me quite a lot and i hope not to revisit it again. Also, they should make sure that the food they are serving to the customer is clean and proper hygiene is maintained and just not serve for making money. 
=====
Unbiased review based on my eating experience.

I'm usually very picky with my 5 star rating, but this place deserves it. D'Ley is a tiny place hidden somewhere in Black Burn Lane, about 3 minutes walking from Central Gate no. 6. This used to be our regular hangout spot during my undergrad days in Presidency and I still visit for their absolutely delicious food.Having exploited almost every thing on the menu, I'd recommend the Chicken Wanton Soup, Pork Fried rice, American Chopsuey, Pepper Chicken, Chilli Pork, Sweet and Sour pork, Chicken Steak and Fried Wontons. I think the taste is even better than the 5star Chinese restaurants out there. They have generous portions, too. Three can have a meal in two plates. Bonus, you get to meet the cutest little Chinese kids if you manage to go around 2.45-3pm in the afternoon.

We were dying to taste a pork dish.. that's when I got recommend by a friend with D'Ley. The food is quite cheap. But they should really take care on the hygiene factor. The plates were smelling bad and were not properly cleaned. Tastewise and quantity wise, the preparations were good enough. Specially the pork item was tasty. :) 
We ordered Fried Wonton as starter. But that was too oily. :(

Another much popular Chinese Eating House in the Tiretti Bazar area. You can stop by for a quick lunch and the price won't bother your wallet much. You can try any of their dishes, though sometimes they can be a tad inconsistent, unlike their very closeby neighbor, Tung Nam. But, that doesn't mean I am giving any discredit to them.
Try out their Pork dishes (if you like/eat them, of course) apart from the usual Chicken, Prawn and Fish items.

Really a gem... Situated just opp to sing cheung sauce co. in between central metro and ezra street. Went out for lunch . Ordered chicken fried rice and hunan chicken. Both the dishes tasted great, specially the hunan chicken, which was spicy and little mintish flavour was comming out from it. Its a must try... ambience wise you will find nothing.

As the city is seeing a violent shift from the old nostalgia to the perks of the modern metropolis, It is the fate of old school restaurants that awaits. Like single screen cinemas, these small joints are soon being replaced with swanky franchise restaurants. 

One such place that i fear will not survive the test of time, is D'ley. 

Don't get me wrong, i say this in a negative manner. D'ley is an absolute gem of an eating house. While its more famous cousins Eau Chew and Tung Nam reap their names, this place remains more obscure, undeservedly so. D'ley deserves flocks of people outside its doors. 

Ambience is not that impressive, but neither is that a high point of any of the reputed old fashioned joints of the city. If the ambience itself asks you to turn yourself away, please do, because this place is not meant for you then. 

Now off to the food, One ginger prawn, one veg mei foon, one mixed yam mein and one roast pork fried 

The ginger prawn was better and cheaper than other outlets. The prawns were rather large in the manner that the prawn balls would have the occasional prawn sticking out. A delight nonetheless, with sweet hints complimented by hints of pungent ginger. 

The veg mein foon was ordinary. no better,no worse than other places. but for the cost, the quality and quantity surely wins. 

The same for the Yam mein, but only the latter part. The Yam mein was doused with giant pieces of chicken, pork and prawn that was a welcome change to the miser quantities of the said stuff given in other chinese places around the city. The noodles were dripping with flavor. a must if you ask me.

the roast pork fried was succulent, chewy and fatty, tossed in a gorgeous fry of onions,peppers and chilli. sure to make any pork lover orgasm, this will be the highlight of my trip there. 

I implore you to visit the place. if you love food, you can't go wrong. if you love restaurants, stay away because this is a small family joint.

I found this restaurant while searching for authentic Chinese restaurants in the city. And finally we visited this place yesterday. We ordered crispy chicken, pepper chicken, Sichuan pork and Singapore rice. Both chicken dishes were very good, especially the crispy chicken. Singapore rice was also very flavorful, with ample amount of chicken and prawn pieces. My only complaint is with the Sichuan pork. Although it was very flavorful and aromatic but the pieces of pork was too chewy and quite tough. That is only why I am giving this restaurant 3.5 star and not 4 star. Otherwise it was a pleasant experience. And I definitely recommend this restaurant.

Food - Underrated. 
Ambience isn't much of an option as this is a tiny outlet and not even a restaurant, it's an eating house. So if you believe in food first, this is your place. Best to visit during winters as it isn't air conditioned and there are less fans. 
Meal is worth the money and you'll be surprised at the quantity you get cause one plate is easily enough for two. 
Other than ambience, nothing else to ponder on.

The Food is one of the best Chinese I have tasted in Kolkata. To be precise, one of the best Indo Chinese.
The Decor or Ambience was'nt exceptional, quite okayish. We had ordered Hong Kong Chicken, Shanghai Chicken and Pepper Chicken, along with Schezwan and Singaporean Fried Rice. Everything was so lip smacking. Love the food.

Since childhood this small cosy restaurant has been my favourite Chinese food eating joint. Price is way too reasonable and they absolutely do not compromise on quantity. The owner and the staff's are very friendly and approachable. My all time favourite dishes 1. Fried pork wanton: these are my lifetime favourite. Perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft and juicy in the inside with a tasty stuffing.
2. Wanton soup (pork obviously): When somebody says comfort food this is what I relate to. Again these meaty wrapped balls of goodness are soaked and drenched in the delicious huge bowl of soup. Absolute love.
3. Pork gravy chow mein: I cannot get enough of this dish. Absolute bliss.
4: pork chilly: best pork chilly I ever had.
Don't ever judge good food by the way it looks. After trying it you will get amazed.

Well, if you’re from Kolkata, the name Tiretti Bazaar cannot be new to you. Not only is it the setting for the magical Chinese breakfast every dawn, but the area also houses Tung Nam, which is (un)arguably the best Chinese restaurant in Kolkata. And the region itself oozes history, dating back as far as the nineteenth century, when it was a hub for Chinese carpenters. There are a lot of Chinese establishments around – places that make authentic pork sausages, the Pou Chong sauce shop, and the small restaurants that call themselves “eating houses”. Well, everything traditional is slowly coming to an end in our world, and Tiretti Bazaar is no exception. The newer generations are not so inclined to take up the old trades, and who can blame them? It’s sad, but as we know, change is the only constant. Coming back to D’Ley, I had read extensively about the divine chili pork that this “eating house” in Tiretti Bazaar makes, and the place had been lying on my bookmarks for some time. I had the chance to pay them a visit last October, when I was in town for Durga Puja.

Well, finding D’Ley is a task. Not because the Google location isn’t accurate (it fairly is), but more so because the place is as small as any you could imagine, and you could miss it while you blink. The best bet is to ask any passerby to help you out once you reach the general area, and a few moments later, you’d be invariably looking at the joint, being met by the neutral gazes of its owners. You’d spot the dad and the son, two of the Hakka Chinese residents of the area, at the counter – and you’d probably find a seat if you’re not very unlucky. The place fits 6-8 people, and it is as basic as it can get – with some interesting Chinese artifacts, the calendar being one of them. Well, once you have reached, there’s no better bet than their Roasted Chili Pork. And trust me, it’s one of the best you’d find in the city. Strips of roasted pork and pieces of pork lard stir fried with onions, soya and chilies, with a hint of garlic – it’s the wet dream of any pork-lover. I would comfortably place D’Ley in the pantheons of Kolkata’s Chili Pork, and each bite is a revelation – the fat pieces are simply droolicious. We had also ordered a Thai Soup, and it was a good egg drop soup to go with the porky awesomeness.

Once we finished up with the pork, it was time to move on to the main course – we ordered the Mixed Foon Mee Mein, half a plate of Hunan Fish, and half a plate of Shanghai Chicken. The Hunan Fish was slightly sweet, as it should be, and very garlicky, again as the norm is. The quality of the fish was great, and there were four large cubes in half a plate. The Shanghai Chicken looked very similar, and tasted quite nice, much spicier than the Hunan Fish. Well, both of these dishes were nothing extraordinary, but quite tasty. The real surprise was the Foon Mee Mein. I knew that this would be a slightly sweeter version of the regular hakka noodles, but I did not expect what arrived on our plate. It was a prawns and chicken infested plate of noodles cooked with generous amounts of soy and black pepper with more than a hint of sweetness. I absolutely loved it, but this dish, as I learned then and there, is not for everyone. My companion did not like the taste, and we could not finish it since the portion size was enormous, and the amount of prawns was mind boggling. Go for it if you’re feeling adventurous but be ready to pack some of it, as we had to.

Overall, D’Ley is probably not as exalted a place as Tung Nam or Eau Chew, but it originates from the same vein of Chinese cooking, and serves up some delectable pork in the true Kolkata style. Do try the the Phai Kut as well, I later heard that these pounded baby pork ribs are quite unique there, and will try it during my next visit. Anything and everything you order will meet the basic standard (which is quite high) of Kolkata’s Chinese cuisine. I am not sure how many years this hole-in-the-wall joint will survive, but make sure you pay them a visit as soon as you can!

Highly Recommended for real Chinese exotic dishes at damn cheap rates. The yam wontons(available in both chicken and pork variants) are just wow and @each plate has 8 to 10 pieces . The taste is simply unique and different from any momos you have probably had before. Their quantity for a plate noodles is quite a lot (2 servings) . Its exciting to try out various cuisines here , since everythings a bit different from the normal Indian versions . 
Note: This is a simple and small restaurant and so , its recommended for casual outings or takeaway .

Whenever I think about cheap and best Chinese food this place is the first thing to pop in my head. This place was introduced to me by a friend of mine a year and a half back and I've been going here ever since. The place is nothing special with just a few tables lying around with one guy who serves who is neither helpful nor rude but the food here is simply just too good!This is one of the cheapest places to have pork which is in itself very hard to come by in the city. A plate of chowmin and fried rice can easily be shared by two people. A special mention to the fried wantons which are just divine! This place is really easy in the pocket and is an ideal place for college goers. A must try place for sure! It is according to me a hidden jem of Kolkata.

The place is near terate market and is owned by Chinese inhabitants.The eatery is small with no decor. But the only thing which takes me back there everytime is their authentic Chinese food.The food is simply amazing it's just what Chinese food is all about full of flavours. It's quite affordable but I would recommend according to my personal experience that pickup​ and delivery would be best as seating arrangement is not good and they don't have A.C.

The place is near terate market and is owned by Chinese inhabitants.The eatery is small with no decor. But the only thing which takes me back there everytime is their authentic Chinese food.The food is simply amazing it's just what Chinese food is all about full of flavours. It's quite affordable but I would recommend according to my personal experience that pickup​ and delivery would be best as seating arrangement is not good and they don't have A.C.

As some of the reviewers are mentioned this place as Hidden Jame, but truly I didn't feel nothing such..

first let's come to location, 
the place is bit odd.. but not much complicated..
Some steps ahead from Podder Coart towards Central Metro.. on the left hand side of the main road, no by lane or etc.

Decor and orientation is nothing to specify.. the place is only for come, seat, eat and go.. that's all..
Service is normal.. only one single person is there to take order, not much helpful.. not rude as well..

Foods are good, but nothing special.. just like any other roadside normal Restaurants...
Prices are within budget, but according to the Taste and service that should be..

D'Ley's was the chosen place for Sunday breakfast organised  by The Calcutta Porkaddicts. A curated menu greeted us. D'Ley is a small Chinese Eatery House. It is legendary, ad is surviving since times immemorial. The eatery is run a Chinese family. They have limited seating arrangements, and no AC. But the space is airy, and it is not stuffy. The adjoining room is actually a workshop room, and they were kind enough to let it out for 100 people. 
The menu included Pork Ball Soup, Steamed Pork Wantons, Steamed Pork Baos, Baked Char Siew Baos, Glutinous Rice, and Pork Steamed in Banana Leaves, Steamed Eggs with Minced Pork, and Chinese Tea.

Like all good things, authentic Chinese eating houses are also shutting down today in Kolkata. A place with minimal ambiance and no-frills professional service- yet people flock there in groups just for the great food with honest price.  One such place is D'Ley. When one talks of the chinatown in Kolkata, we understand it to be the Tangra/ Topsia area. But, the territti bazaar and adjacent area is one place where till date, the famed (or something like that) chinese road-side breakfast takes place (few shops on weekdays and in a grand scale, on sundays). The same can be found in my post here... However, couple of places are there which are proud to call themselves eating house, rather than a restaurant. They are mostly operated by families- the items are the traditional ones and sometimes on a special request, the hidden gems and prepared for a few special guests. Apart from Tung Nam (my eternal weak point for me for chinese food in city), D'Ley is one such place. This is a journey love. 

“how do I reach ? “

Say, you’re standing in front of Central Metro station at the Road towards Poddar court, Follow the road towards the Poddar Court. After around 5 minutes of walking (that road is a one-way for vehicles – coming towards Central avenue), you’ll fine a blue colored building on you left- that’s Kolkata Improvement Trust Building- adjacent to the Teritty bazar BSNL bhawan. D'Ley is situated opposite to that building and please remember, its a blink-and-miss kind of place. Please remember, the sign-board is put up on the next shop (as you can find in the photograph). 

Enter the place and please be ready to find some 4-5 tables and chairs thrown around and one cash counter with few on-interested oriental faces spending the sweet lazy time at it. There'll be nobody to greet you, and hopefully you're not even expecting that. Have a seat. Thankfully, immediately the cold water will be served to your table. Menucards are already thrown in front of you and remember, you're supposed to know what you're going to order. 

It's a long menu card, and trust me, it will be an entertaining read while the food comes. But, here let me suggest you something. There is a dish called Yam Mein in the menu. Its basically tossed noodles. Whereas, in normal noodle preparation, the meat and vegetables are stir-fried and then the noodles come into the scenario, here all the ingredients are cooked together, giving them a slightly soggy feeling but locking the full aroma. Go for that. I normally opt for the Mixed Yum Mein. The portion size is quite decent- 2 portions can satisfy 3 hungry souls, but as a first timer, also, go for their Mixed fried Rice- it's quite heavy in portion size and light in taste. Needless to say, quantity of meat and shrimps are pretty good in both of them. 

With the two main dishes, go for one strange named dish. Well, it's not strange, it's slightly unusual for the us, average chinese-hogging bongs. It's called Phai-Kut. In layman's language, it's the ribs of a baby pork, slightly pounded and broken into small pieces. I prefer it with oyster sauce. It's a semi-gravy dish and for the pork-rib lovers, it's simply yummy. The second item, that I always order is their Roasted dry chilly pork. This is like my first love. Like you compare all your flings and maybe even your wife with your first love, I tend to rate any chinese eatery with this single dish. In my opinion, Eau Chew and Silver Grill make it pretty good in town, but D'Ley is not far either. Go for it or if you feel, you may like to pack it for your home, I don't feel you'll be disappointed. 

Wash them all down with the half ltr soft drinks that you've already ordered and you'll feel good for the rest of the day. 

So, this is my tryst with D'Ley- another old school chinese eating house and hope you like it too. But, one word of caution. Unlike Tung Nam, these guys are not very consistent in food preparation and not that they care a lot. On a good day, they can give the biggies a run for their money and on a bad day, your friendly local chinese joint is better than them- but then when you get good quality pork in all the Kolkata localities ?

Bon apetite !!!

This eatery is located at Barabazar, near Central Metro station which mainly serves Chinese foods.

Location is difficult to trace.

Small place , nothing fancy.

Sitting arrangements available.

Average service.

Tried Chicken Hakka  chow  &  chilli chicken dry. Both were sufficient in quantity and were lip smacking with a pocket friendly tag.

A must visit for their pocket friendly tasty  food.

Yesterday I went there with one of my friends,and  zomato helped me this time also..It was a small eating house with cosy interiors. Quite easy to locate.Small food junction with reasonable price..We ordered there chicken dragon roll,mixed fried rice and schezwan chicken..Chicken dragon rolls were really superb, perfect seasonings,not very much spicy,yet it's mouthwatering.So delicious that anyone can experience the flavour of the herbs.These are served with homemade schezwan sauce,which tasted AWESOME,and it raised my expectation level..We had then mixed fried rice,with enough prawns and meat chunks..It was delicious and it was pretty enough for us two.As a sidedish we had schezwan chicken,but it wasn't that much spicy,I felt it so flat in tatse.I won't recommend this dish.But overall,they served us good food..No extra VAT.College-kids must try this one.

Situated in end of the black burn lane at new CIT road crossing just 2-3 walking from Central metro station. It was an old Chinese fast food outlet which serve the most delicious Chinese food in barabazar after tung nam. Decent sized restaurant maintained really good. Ambience was nice and so as hospitality. Service in reasonable time and presentation was superb. Price was totally reasonable. I tried their Chilly potatoes which were full of spicy and tastes amazingly delicious. And I also tried their veg hakka noodles which made perfectly, smells nice and tastes really good. Must try place. Highly recommended.

This place was a sudden discovery but an exemplary one. The interior was small and cosy, nothing fancy. We were hungry and ordered a mixed gravy noodles and chilli pork dry right away. Service was quick and the food was served in no time.. Both the dishes tasted amazing and came in huge quantities. The prices are extremely pocket friendly.

If you are a student in Kolkata, College Street have played a havoc role in your college and school life. Food at College Street points to the direction of Coffee House, Food Station or Gunjan Chinese Restaurant. But there hides a gem for food lovers just a minute walk from Central Metro Station. D’Ley.

Here is another pocket friendly chinese (read pork) heaven in central kolkata area.  I bookmarked it long ago and forgot it all and then today literally forced a friend to treat me there as I wanted to try a new place.

Ambiance and interior- This is a small joint with 25-30 people sitting capacity. There is nothing fancy about this place. But  with enough light, fans and comfort, you can enjoy the food peacefully.

Service- The service is prompt. The waiter knows about the food and portions.

Food- If you are expecting the authentic Chinese big restaurants in the Calcutta, it will be a disappointment. This is the pocket friendly joint fir the college goers where they can explore the varieties. But although this place has a touch of Kolkata chinese, it uses authentic sauces and do not load the food with onions, garlic and capsicum. 
The amount is really a lot. For a medium eater, one plate of anything is sufficient for two.

Pork Yam Mein- This is a basic noodle dish with ample pork i it. I loved the simplicity of this dish. There is no added spice or sauce in it. The good thing is that you can pair it up with any side dish.

Roasted pork fried- This is too good. The pork is perfectly cooked. the meat is smokey yet soft and juicy. The fried onions and little juicy oily thing that comes along with it, goes exceptionally well with the noodles.

Hunan Pork- Pork cooked in slightly tangy and sweet sauce. Loved the tenderness of the meat again. 

The pork served is of pretty good quality in all three dishes. The pieces are big and succulent. Both pork fat and lean meat are present in balanced quantity in the dish. 

I will go there with friends if I am in that area and want to try some tasty pork dish :D

D'Ley ended up being an unexpected disappointment.
Looking at the reputation it has garnered up in Zomato, we were prepared for the lackluster ambiance or the  underwhelming service. What we did not foresee was the quality of food being a major cause of concern.

We had ordered a Schezwan Chicken Noodles, a Hunan Fish and a Dry Roast Pork Fried. Quantity wise, there is nothing to complain about. Value for money is what you get. However, the Noodles were ordinary; the pork was dry and over-fried  & the fish had a distinct smell indicating at it going bad.

Even if I give it the benefit of doubt and take it as a one off incident; the fact still remains that if they do not step up the game, this place will remain inferior to Tung Nam (an undisputed leader in the cheap yet exceptional chinese joint league) &  Pou Hing (lesser known/rated/appreciated but better in quality and ambiance than D'ley) residing in the same area.

D'Ley is a wonderful Chinese restaurant. It is located at a few minutes walk from central metro. And its also very economic. Though its out look is very ordinary but its variety of food item, and its quality and quatity beats all. I have tried almost all dishes. The Singapore Fried rice and Schewan Chowmin both are equally very good. Hunan chicken which consists 4pieces of chicken with spicy gravy serves good as side dish. Chicken Cashews is also finger licking item of here. Pork items are equally good with very reasonable prices.

This place can quench your hunger with very pocket friendly budget without any service tax.This place is perfect for college peeps!

Must try: Singapore chowmin, any pork items,Lemon chicken.
I am frequent visitor of this place but everytime i find, strange behaviour of waiter. Otherwise everything is fine.Highly recommended.

D'ley is an eatery close to my heart. It is at walking distance from my college and a pocket friendly date spot for me.
The food is surprisingly good for the price with big portions.
Every single time that I've been to D'ley and had more than the standard chicken with mixed rice, I had difficulty walking because of the quantity of food.

Trust me on this review because there was a time I'd go here every other day. Or at least once a week.

I recommend:

The Chinese chopsuey
Saturday chicken.
Fried wontons
Chicken sweet corn soup
Chicken dumplings/momo
Mixed fried rice.
Hunan chicken/lemon chicken/chicken with mushroom and veg/chilli chicken/Shanghai chicken.

D'Ley is a small Chinese Restaurant, which locates at Barabazar area not in College Street area.

If you are going from C.R. Avenue, then go straight from which the bus are are coming from Lalbazar! After a walk for couple of minutes, you can locate Pou Chung at your right side! D'Ley is just next to it! The location of the restaurant is kinda odd, just like its name! A telephone pole box just taken almost the entrance space of it, so you might missed the restaurant, if you r not watching properly for the first time!

Basic sitting arrangement with some Chinese posters and wall hanging decorations are there, Nothing special about it!

When we enter the restaurant, no one was there to welcome us. An old man was there in the cash counter. We just took our seat ourselves and then after 7-10mins later a person come with water and menu card and go away! Then after few minutes, a man came from kitchen, noted our ordered and went back to kitchen again! This kinda hospitality was not in my expectation, still we look forward for the food!

Taking few minutes and after watching some reviews on Zomato, my friend

For food lovers who like to keep there pockets tight ...this place is a must go...

The restaurant is located straight from Central Metro towards Poddar Court, just beside Pou Chung.
It is a small Chinese eatery that serves authentic,delicious and cheap Chinese food with basic lights, non AC, wall hanging fans.This place might not have the best seating arrangements, but the quality of food more than makes up.

Items ordered : Chicken fry, Chicken fried rice, Szechuan prawn, Manchurian fish.

The service was very quick and the food was served within 10-15mins.The quantity was enough for two extremely hungry people like us.Prices of all the dishes were very affordable with no additional taxes.You must give it a try too.
A great place for a quick Chinese.

One bowl is enough for two people.. found a huge paradox   with the next item.. prawn wafer is super oily and it becomes a heavy burden for our little tummy... somehow We were incapable of finishing it.. a big NO for the health  conscious  people.... wonton soup is a must try..

This is a small, old, family run restaurant on the way to Poddar Court from Central Metro. They are well known for serving huge quantity food at an affordable rate.

The seating arrangement is small and congested. It becomes really difficult to eat here during the hot summer days. Service is fast. 

Mixed gravy Chow tastewise was OK. But the main problem was the veggies were not properly cooked. In Chinese we expect the veggies not to be cooked fully and remain a bit crunchy. But here they were almost raw. The capsicum pieces were raw and the onions too. Also there was an excess of cabbage, which again was not cooked properly.

The pork side dish was better. But again here the pieces were not cut properly. 

Personally think this is a good place, but the owners/chef lack enthusiasm and end up with a half-hearted attempt. If they can sort out these problems they can become the cheapest Chinese restaurant in town serving good food including pork.

If you are around and want a heavy meal at a pocket friendly rate, visit them.

A very small (NON AC ) chinese joint. Seating arrangement is very pathetic...They do not have any washroom..One thing amazed me when i asked for cold water they said that they cant serve that also as they dont have those facilites.... Any way now coming to the main part... Ordered for Mixed fried rice with dry roasted chilly pork... chilli pork was very good but the fried rice was pathetic .... The quality of the rice was very bad and stiff also... the behaviour of the waiter is also very strange... He was continuously staring at us while we were having our food.... anyway not all recommended from my end... But still a one time visit is ok....

I don't know what D'Ley means but the name, rating & positive reviews about this restaurant catches my eyes. I love to visit this kind of hidden gems & try their foods. Lets see how they are doing...

Location : D'Ley is located at Bara Bazaar not at College Street that is mentioned on Zomato. Its straight from Central Metro towards Poddar Court just beside Pou Chung. Just like what every other reviews says about this place, this one is really hard to find because the restaurant is hidden behind an telephone booth, so do take a look getting on the footpath.

Decorations : The restaurant is quite small inside. There is mostly 20 peoples sitting spread around but they aren't well organized. Its very basic, nothing on decorations. Simple wooden chairs & tables, nothing on the walls except some Chinese wall stickers, basic fluorescent white lights, non AC, wall hanging fans, all this basic things doesn't creates any kind of ambience at all. However its clean inside so hygiene level shouldn't be a question over here.

Staffs & Management : We visited the restaurant at dinner time & lack of staffs were noticed. A very old man was sitting on the cash counter & no one was there to give us menu card or take our order. After 10-15 minutes a man came out from kitchen & provided us a glass of plain water & menu card. He took our order & again he went to the kitchen. All of that seemed very odd to us.

Foods : Their menu layout is simple but lots of items are present. As per other reviews many people loved  their Foon Mee Mein, Hunan Chicken & Roasted Pork. So I ordered from them too...

Chicken Foon Mee Mein : Foon Mee Mein is the noodles tossed with sweet sauce. But what we got seemed like plain Hakka Noodles to me. The noodles were thick, spicy & highly fried. There was very less vegetables used, also very less chicken pieces were there. Chicken pieces were totally unshaped & not so well cooked. Sweet taste of Foon Mee Mein was completely missing over here what I found it in Tung Nam. However the quantity was pretty good to fill a hungry tummy.

Hunan Chicken : I took the half Hunan Chicken as I wasn't that hungry. That came with 4 small pieces of chicken with very less gravy in it. But as per other reviewers photos on Zomato Hunan Chicken comes with much gravy than this. So that means they don't have any perfection of making food & it becomes different by every time. Coming to the dish, chicken pieces were wrapped in a thick layer of corn flower that is not too good. The gravy was full of green chillies & garlic pieces. Excessive rich garlic taste of the dish doesn't felt good. Excessive spices were mixed with the oil & this gravy doesn't tasted good with the noodles either.

Pricing : Pricing of all the dishes are very affordable. The quantity is satisfactory for the prices. Our bill for the above mentioned dishes were Rs. 220.

Conclusion : As D'Ley is located just on the opposite lane of Tung Nam it gives them a direct competition to them & it itself got kicked out by its poor food quality. Being in Central if you are looking for authentic Chinese food then undoubtedly Tung Nam still stays the best option to try from. Still D'Ley is one time preferable for foodies looking for trying new restaurants.

Hunan Chicken : I took the half Hunan Chicken as I wasn't that hungry. That came with 4 small pieces of chicken with very less gravy in it. But as per other reviewers photos on Zomato Hunan Chicken comes with much gravy than this. So that means they don't have any perfection of making food & it becomes different by every time. Coming to the dish, chicken pieces were wrapped in a thick layer of corn flower that is not too good. The gravy was full of green chillies & garlic pieces. Excessive rich garlic taste of the dish doesn't felt good. Excessive spices were mixed with the oil & this gravy doesn't tasted good with the noodles either.

Pricing : Pricing of all the dishes are very affordable. The quantity is satisfactory for the prices. Our bill for the above mentioned dishes were Rs. 220.

Conclusion : As D'Ley is located just on the opposite lane of Tung Nam it gives them a direct competition to them & it itself got kicked out by its poor food quality. Being in Central if you are looking for authentic Chinese food then undoubtedly Tung Nam still stays the best option to try from. Still D'Ley is one time preferable for foodies looking for trying new restaurants.

We have been having this immense craving for Chinese food for the past couple of days. I immediately rummaged through Zomato in hope of a hidden gem that goes easy on the pocket while being able to satiate our hunger for some sauce-laden fat-dripping pork with a fine bowl of thin and spindly stir fried noodles. D'Ley, with its nice rating, decent reviews and an affordable cost-for-two caught my eye and we set out to have lunch at this tiny family-run restaurant near Poddar Court yesterday. 
The place is extremely easy to find being situated right next to the Pou Chong Sauces store. We went in sometime around 3 which clashed with the lunch time of the owners' family. However, a man came up from his meal and took our orders which comprised of Mixed Foon Mee Mein, Roast Pork Fried and a bottle of Sprite. They have revised their menu which will increase the prices of all the items listed on Zomato at the moment by 10 or 20 bucks.
The food came in within 10 minutes of waiting and the sight, though not exactly mind numbing, wasn't too bad either. We were told that Foon Mee Mein is a kind of noodles that's made sweeter than usual. The one infront of us looked a lot richer and darker than we'd expected. The first few spoonfuls of the noodles were greatly satisfying with the slightly burnt aftertaste, ample amount of large sized prawns and chicken and the not too overpowering sweet flavor. However, it contained a bit too much of soy sauce which made us feel overburdened with the taste as we continued to work our way through the dish. It was an exceptionally hot day, and the cold drink saved us to some extent by rinsing off the grease. The pork sadly wasn't too commendable as I felt that the meat could've been softer. What I loved about the dish were the small chunks of pork fat strewn all over, it was soft, juicy and full of flavor unlike the dry slices of the meat. Together with the sweeter noodles, the saltiness of the dish was nicely balanced. 
One thing which needs to be mentioned is the lack of concern showed by the owners. The 600 ml bottle of Sprite which has a MRP of 35 rupees was firstly charged 50 rupees and on top of that, it had already passed the expiry date two months back. Sadly, we noticed this only after having taken a couple of swigs out of it. They should have made it a point to check the date before serving to their customers and charge 15 rupees extra for nothing.
Unfortunately try as I might, D'ley failed to be the "hidden gem" I had thought it would be even though their food is tasty, cheap and comes in generous quantities. Maybe a few other dishes from their menu could change my opinion in the near future?

On a certain Tuesday afternoon, finding Tung Nam closed and really craving for some authentic Chinese food, my friend and I decided to give this place a try. Locating the place turned out to be quite a task as it is very easy to miss, a tiny eatery tucked in between furniture shops. This place,however, is truly a hidden gem. Especially for foodies like me who are perpetually broke. We order mixed fried mei foon and chilly pork. The quantity was enough for two extremely hungry people and food was delicious. And the best part is how easy it is on the pocket. So if you ever find yourself near the Central Avenue metro station looking for a place to eat, do give this place a try.

This place might be a little difficult to locate as it is situated in an extremely congested area near Poddar Court. The walk from central metro station is not a pleasant one, but that would take a backseat as soon as the food is served. If you are in that area and looking for some authentic Chinese food then this is the place to be. The amount of food they provide you at such a price, you would easily say its value for money. Given the sultry weather of Calcutta, one major drawback of this place is not being air conditioned.

D'Ley should be featured in the hidden gem category of Zomato. Not much known, it's a very small Chinese restaurant serving really good food. This place had been in my bucket list since very long. Finally I was able to make it possible yesterday. 
Last day I had been there with four of my friends for a birthday treat. This place is located just opposite to the Raj and Raj outlet near Poddar Court. You have to be a bit keen on finding out this place, as it's really small and as I also said, must be featured in 'Hidden Gem' category. Run by a Chinese family, you'll come across almost everyone in the family from the eldest grandfather who is stooping down of age to cute little Chinese kids and I assure that would be an absolute delight to your eyes. 
We had ordered Mixed Foon Mee Mein, Mixed Singapore Fried Rice, Roasted Pork and a plate of large Hunan Prawn. Each of them were really good. I meant to say awesome. The portions were really large, enough to feed four adults. The prawns in the rice and the noodles were big ones, well cooked and yummy. Even the amounts of mixture in both of them were sufficient, perfect and balanced. The best one was the foon mee mein. It was really like out of the world. The other dishes were also pretty good. I am surely going to come back here pretty often whenever I crave for good Chinese without making a hole in my pocket. And you must give it a try too! It's awesome guys. Definitely recommended. Happy Dining! :)

A family run restaurant near poddar court,d'ley offers pocket friendly & very yummy chinese food. So today after office i decided to have something from this place so satiate my hunger after a hectic day of work.

The place is clean & moderately spaced. So after getting seated i ordered the following items:-

1. Chicken friedrice= Very tasty & looked very filling with generous amounts of chicken & veggies. The quantity was just perfect & can easily be eaten by a single person. They use thick rice instead of normal thin rice but still it didn't affect its taste.

2. Hunan chicken= Since i was looking for a spicy side dish,the helper recommended me to try this item & so i went by his word. Took half plate of it & my god i did the right thing to go by his word. This dish was super delicious. 4 pieces of pure crispy chicken in garlic & chilli-soya gravy sauce took the dish to another level & complimented with my rice perfectly. This dish is a must try for all.

The service was very quick since the food was served within 10mins. They dont charge any extra tax & the pure chinese flavours would surely make your tummies happy. Worth a visit if you are looking for tasty home made chinese preparations.

Tiny place, satisfying food, rapid service. Easy to find, just keep walking straight towards Poddar Court from Central metro station, and it's on the footpath to the right. Wanton soup, Chicken momo, Chicken chilly garlic noodles all great. The portion size is huge. Their sides aren't that great, however, and the hakka can be seeped in oil, so that's a minus. Prices are pretty okay, considering portion. Alright for a quick lunch, that's easy on the pocket.

I'll always be biased towards D'ley because I have been eating there since forever. When I started going to D'ley with my dad it was an old, rundown and shabby little place with tools instead of chairs and broken walls. Now, they have renovated and shifted next doors. In the place of the previous restaurant they now have a parlour. It is still very small and cramped and not a place for a fancy date.
Coming to food. I've tasted most of the things on the menu and I'll highly recommend the following.
1. Soups- chicken hot n sour soup, chicken sweet corn soup, thai soup. The quantity they give for 1/2 is more than what some restros give for a single full soup.
2. Chicken schezuan fried rice is a winner (highly recommended) , plain chicken fried rice is great too.
3. Chicken gravy noodles has ample amount of chickens and veggies and a single plate is sufficient to feed two adults.
4. Chicken mein foon is great too.
5. Side dishes- I will recommend sweet garlic chicken, manchurian chicken, hoi sin chicken and dry chilli chicken.
6. Also in starters you can try their momos (they serve that without soup), fry chicken and chicken lollipop (pan fried). Pan fried chicken lollipop is not on the menu but they do make it on special request and they serve 8 pieces of the same in 130 rs. It's definitely worth a try.
Not everything here is good though.
I will NOT recommend the yam mein that they serve as it is very very oily and smells very strongly of garlic.

Added later: The food nowadays have gone down by quite a few notch. The fried rice is disgusting now. I'm changing my rating to 3.5 from 4. I feel now even the 3.5 is more than they deserve. I'll still be giving for old times sake. 

Update 2: changing back to 4 because in recent times they have gone back to their old ways with their menu ( both quality and quantity).

Food quality and quantity both were good. Ambiance was Ok. Quite far from college street actually. The area could seem a bit dirty to some people. This restaurant is actually situated near Poddar Court. Service could be better. Waited for around 20 minutes for a single plate of Chicken Fried Rice and Chilli Chicken. Taste wise no complaints, though didn't liked the Chilli Chicken that much. But the fried rice was very nice. A single plate is ample to feed two full grown ups.

Real hungry from a long walk around College Street, we came to D'ley for some Chinese. Ordered eight dishes for seven of us and had to take home an entire plate of Mixed Foon Mee Mein. Loved the fried pork wontons, Hong Kong Prawns, Sweet and Sour Pork, Chicken Manchow Soup, Mongolian pork, Hunan Prawns and the Roast Chili Pork. The mixed fried rice was pretty good too. Will definitely visit again.

P.S. We paid 170 each for all the food. ^_^

D'Ley, it's my favourite. Whenever I have the good fortune to pass by I am sure to go there.
The only problem is parking. So I have to keep the car parked in some other place and walk all the distance just in order to taste their supplies.
When I first chanced upon it, I was warned by many not to try it as the area is unclean. Well, till date, I have not had a stomach ailment after having taken their food.
The food is delicious. My favourite is chicken with cashew nuts. I take mixed Hakka chow with it. Since it is a family business, you should not be surprised to find cute little Chinese children taking down your orders or suggesting food for you. Ambience wise it may not be the best but good wise it may challenge the biggest Chinese restaurants in Kolkata.

My food hunts often take me to queer places, but this I found to be one of the weirdest locales for a food joint. Non the less, we ordered. Hakka chow, hunan chicken, chilli pork. Keeping aside the ambience, the presentation, only on the basis of food, it was a total knock out. Outstanding mix of spices in the soft tender chicken, ample quantity of noodles, n one of the best pork dishes I've tasted. A gravy dish with spices so subtle, u can still taste the texture of the meat. And so tender for pork meat! Those who say "never judge a book by its cover" probably refer to this place when they say it!!

The food here is absolutely delicious, and so cheap - its wonderful. I first came here at the suggestion of a friend, and since then, this has been my favourite destination for a quick meal. My favourite are the pork dishes, reasonably priced and finger-licking good. And this is really close to my college, so that's a pro.

This was literally a discovery.. A sultry afternoon , 3 hungry people, and this small eatery. We ordered veg hakka noodles, chilli pork, Hunan chicken.. And man it was alot, we couldn't finish. Service was fast. Easy on pocket... And tasted as it should be. One of the best pork I had.. And man the quantity they gave. It's run by a family .. So do not expect some hify ambiance but do expect same good gustatory experience. And honorary mention : I totally loved the kid , she was sooo cute

While looking for some Chinese sauces in Teritti Bazar area , we stumbled upon this place. It was around 5 in the evening and we were neither full nor empty. We decided to try some snacks in D'ley. Orders were simple , steamed momo and fried wanton. Service was prompt and we like both the dishes. Especially fried wanton with sweet chilly sauce was really tasty. We will definitely come back to this place to try main courses.

I visited ‘D` Ley’ after a long time with my friend Sayan to enjoy some evening snacks. The restaurant is located near Podder Court building and 2-3 minute walking from central metro station. This place is one of the oldest Chinese restaurants in this area. It’s a small abode with very little sitting arrangements but popular within the locals. As we have very little time to waste, we ordered ‘Chicken with Mushroom and Vegetables’, ‘Hoi Sin Fish’ and ‘Seafood Mei Fun’.

Chicken with Mushroom and Vegetables was wonderful, perfect blend of chicken and mushrooms. It was lovely if you were looking for something different to the traditional chicken and vegetable option. Hoi Sin Fish was charming, spicy, mouth-watering and very aromatic. Seafood Mei Fun was equally good and not at all greasy. The place is not too crowded in evening so you can just sit back and enjoy your food. The staffs are polite and very friendly and service is prompt and efficient. So to sum up I would like to say it’s a place where you can visit for Chinese food if you are in Podder Court area and the best part is that pocket pinch is almost nothing compared to the quality & quantity of the food.

This nondescript eatery is located on the way to Poddar Court from Central, between some furniture stores. It has been the best discovery of my college life so far. For someone with limited budget and in search of authentic Chinese food, this place is the answer. A single serve is good for two people. I am an avid fan of the pork served here, and often end up ordering just pork and soup for lunch. The honey noodles are very much like darsaan, and the wonton soup is a must try. Also, they serve a really tasty kind of sweet noodles called Foon mei mein. The Chinese family who runs it are very homely, and one can often find the kids playing around in the afternoon while their greatgrandfather manages the place. The decor might be minimal, but they serve you with love and that makes the food even more delicious!

I have been trying really hard to see d'ley featured on zomato. And finally it did occur. Now how is college street related to d'ley have absolute no clue. D'ley is a straight walk from central metro towards poddar court and this one is located on the right hand . Accidentally discovered it, when searching for tung naam. This one is a small little joint . The best thing it is a authentic chinese eatery , yet real clean. The decor is nil. What matters here is the food. I have visited here on many occasions . I am a fan of their wonton soup as well as the fried wonton. Thenir amazing chicken steak is highly recommended. And as for the main course.  The authentic mixed gravy noodles and chilli chicken dry steals the show. Their dragon chicken and amazing special fried rice is worth everything. The food here is too cheap anf amazing. Since i am chino freak, It is one of my personal favourite and I am surely going back.

This place being near my office has always been the goto place when I'm in the mood for chinese. Boy they are good! 
I can vouch for their Chicken hakka noodles for they are the one of the best noodles you'd get in town. 
Also the quantity is sumptuous, good enough for two moderately hungry persons. 
I go to this place quite often and simply order a chicken hakka noodle and I'm sorted for lunch under ₹100.

One of my afternoon ventures made me stumble upon this place after finding that the other Chinese eateries nearby had by then stopped serving lunch. This place is similar to the other nearby eatery that I had earlier posted a review on, in the fact that this too is actually inhabited by  a Chinese family with a little girl playing around in between spells of sitting down to read something from a book!!! This very thing makes you feel like having bumped into someone's household and on the other hand also lets you taste some home bred true blue authentic dishes which you might find nowhere else.
We had chicken lollypop first which was more or less a near cousin of the regular Drums of heaven and tasted very good.In the main courses I ordered for vegetable fried rice and mixed fried rice,both of which tasted good.Specially the mixed fried rice had real good proportions of chicken and was really tasty.The amount was ample and 2plates were enough for three people.The Hoi sin chicken was a thing that I had over here for the first time.This was cooked in black sauce and tasted equally good.The dish comprised 8pieces of chicken which were of good size.The coating on the chicken was thin and soft(which is often hard and a let down in many of our city eateries) and the chicken good to taste. Overall the food made me really happy and heavy ;)
If you are in search of well furnished places and decor this is not your place.The server had let the kitchen door open and I found that it was quite a clean one.Finally the price of the items will bring a bigger smile to your face as the pocket pinch is quite less than other places. If you are ready to experiment and are in search of good Chinese food at low prices,do pay a visit.
