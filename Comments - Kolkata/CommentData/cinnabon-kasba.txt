The best things to eat during a winter night is a warm classical preztel soft ,buttery and Soo savoury, a cup of coffee and finish with a cinnabon. Had been planning to try it for months and finally a friend and I visit the mall and got to try it.
Tatse-- perfect finger / coffee food.
Service-impeccable food felt hand made and well taken care off.
Taste- u fell like walking and eating this in a street side vender in Germany the pretzel is that good , it's a soft pretzel with sour cream on the side.Cinnabon is good soft warm and perfect to taste not too sweet and not too much cinnamon..perfect!
Value for money,-quite filling and I would say quiet light on the pocket too

This is my second visit to the Acropolis Cinnabon outlet and that is due to its very good quality cinnamon rolls. A bit too sweet to taste but they have a lovely smell of cinnamon and are soft and warm in texture. A single cinnamon roll is quite fulfilling by itself. The preztels however are not up to the mark. The bread becomes hard and tasteless after some time specially when kept exposed in air. Overall I prefer the cinnabons for a good dessert option. The service is good too.

Horrible experience.Visited this place on christmas eve.Since both of us were craving for hot chocolate we opted for cinnabon.The staff were rude and never bothered to reply back when we asked a few questions.The drink was way more expensive and tasted like monkey pee with battery acid.We couldn't even finish a single cup even after dividing the same

Am I the only one who found the rolls rather ordinary; even a bit bitter in parts with a strong medicinal  / synthetic flavor and aftertaste..?..I really was looking forward to enjoying the treat, but got utterly disappointed..!
I wonder what the fuss is all about...!!

Get a plain bun, sprinkle some Hershey syrup on top of it..and you get something very similar, and at a much lesser buck..!!

The mini bon rolls were complimentary but we got so completely smitten by them that we ordered a box for the go. Will visit again.

This outlet of Cinnabon is located in Acropolis mall foodcourt. It offers minibons,chocobons, muffins, many refreshment drinks etc. We have ordered for chocobons. It was made of sweet bread and there was chocolate sauce all over it making it really tasty but those sweet breads were a bit hard to tear apart.

Prompt service. Good food. Price is on the higher side.

Bring more flavors to the menu. A few more varieties of cinnabons... Looking forward to them! Even the dips. The chocolate and the frosting is amazing but something with fruits or berries.

Also if you had these assorted cinnabon platters it would be cool. I love this place so much and wish you guys the best!!

Just hanged around at acropolis and stopped for a quick bite over here, because of its increasing craze. But it wasn't up to my expectations at all. 
Not everyone likes cinnamon rolls, and I was one of them. But the rolls were baked fresh and served hot. 
Otherwise, we also ordered for coffee and raspberry lemonade - which actually disappointed me. 
The lemonade served was really sour and even after changing, it tasted the same. And coffee? I've had better. 
So that's that!

I have been waiting for this chain for I don't remember how long... Went there earlier this month (don't have any images, sorry...). Had one classic and one choco bon (take away, love the paper bag packaging but need to make it stronger). I was not disappointed. I am anyways in love with cinnamon flavored desserts.¬† The behavior of the staff was also quite nice. One suggestion, the choco bon does not have much chocolate in it any ways, other than classic, try the caramel or the pecan one. The taste of pecan or caramel goes better with cinnamon, have it worm. And yes, I will go back for more...

Located on the food court of acropolis mall, this place, as the name suggests serve these absolutely delicious cinnamon rolls. We settled for the caramel pecanbon and it was a delightful experience. Light sweet pastry layered with heavenly goodness. If you are alone I will suggest you go for their minibon as their regular sized cinnamon rolls are quite big and very filling. Teamed up with their hot and cold beverages the place definitely provides the ideal breakfast options to begin your day with. It's worth the price and definitely worth a visit.

Abit high priced in the acropolis mall. Cinnabon has a variety of cinnamon flavoured creamy buns, sweet puffs, rolls, cookies and more. Wht i tried was a classic creamy hot cinnabon bun. Request them ti heat it as it melts the sugar inside and the caramel flavoured cinnamon just melts in your mouth giving it a juicy feel.

Oh! If only I stayed next to Auntie Anne's, fresh-baked cinnamon rolls would have been my everyday staple. I would have started my day with the instant sugar rush. But since that is not the case, I have to make peace with occasional trips to Acropolis Mall.

My favorite is the caramel pecanbon! The gooey, dripping caramel melts my heart! Just dig into the roll and start biting off small pieces till you reach the centre of happiness! Highly recommended!

I have tried their coffee and snacks which I found quite good in test and satisfying in quantity.
Their coffee is quite light than others as CCD and CW! Prices are pocket friendly.

Cinnabon is one of the classic American dessert chains, featuring the quintessential cinnamon rolls. They come in several sizes and varieties. I have tried the regular cinnamon roll as well as the Chocobon - the one with chocolate sauce. I found them both good as an indulgent treat when warm and freshly made, but could perhaps do without the chocolate myself. They also have a very nice red velvet cupcake, that has a generous amount of frosting and tastes great despite being a bit on the dry side. The coffee is regular machine style coffee, nothing spectacular. Overall, I'd say it's nice for an occasional satisfaction of the sweet tooth craving.

Having heard a lot of great reviews and read a few on zomato I was too excited to try at Cinnabon.I ordered the Cinnabon Classic for a takeaway.But having coming home and trying, the Cinnabon looked different from the one I saw at the rack at the store.T he frosting was highly thick and the saddest part was that the Cinnabon was stale.It was hard and tough and felt like chewing a stale sweet bread.
        I'm highly dissapointed at the quality of the product.The taste differed from the ones they served for tasting.Unfotunately I could not have it and had to dispose it off.

They have a double combo of classic cinnabons and choco rolls which I ordered via zomato.Not being n ardent fan of frosting,I felt their fame precedes their offerings.Don't get me wrong,I have seen and I know people who'd drool over a piece of cinnabon,but it isn't everyone's cup of tea.firstly because,it would be rather be a giant grenade in arm and not and a harmless cup due to its size.secondly,it saturates the sweetbuds you have and leaves you high and dry for something spicy.But,It does look good, admittedly.exquisite, by the level of ornate cakes you find in Kolkata till now.Also they pack it in a cute little box. :)

This is a chain of American baked dessrts, which i am not very fond of even during my stay at the states. Tried classic cinnabon roll which is too too sweet. hence keeping my review very short.

Cinnamon roll has been in my bucket list since the dawn of time. I never really found a place where they sale cinnamon rolls until I stumbled upon this small eatery. They have a lot of things including cinnamon rolls and it is affordable. We had ordered Choco cinnabon and a chocolate cupcake. The cinnabon was filling and delicious. The cupcake was upto the mark.

I was delighted when I saw that Cinnabon is opening up in Calcutta. Having relished their delicacies in Delhi I was eagerly waiting. However, it wasn't as great. I donno what was wrong, but something was. I wish they get their standards to match their counterparts.

Having heard a lot of great reviews and read a few on zomato I was too excited to try at Cinnabon.I ordered the Cinnabon Classic for a takeaway.But having coming home and trying, the Cinnabon looked different from the one I saw at the rack at the store.T he frosting was highly thick and the saddest part was that the Cinnabon was stale.It was hard and tough and felt like chewing a stale sweet bread.
        I'm highly dissapointed at the quality of the product.The taste differed from the ones they served for tasting.Unfotunately I could not have it and had to dispose it off.

First time I heard the name cinnabon it ws on Todd Wilbur's Top Secret Recipes it is a show on History channel where Todd will try to replicate the original recipes of famous places like cinnabon within few days.
 So I got really intrigued about the shop after seeing that episode that how they make the dough's, hw they use imported cinnamon etc.
 So when the shop came to Kolkata in Acropolis mall near rajdanga(near ruby hospital)I thought I hv to try it n I did n I wasn't disappointed, Wow the flavours are good.
Must Try: Classic, Caramel flavoured

The food is good, albeit on the expensive side. But their service is nothing to write home about! I have visited this outlet quite a few times. But last time I was extremely irritated. I ordered a 2 pretzels, a choco bon and a velvet cupcake as takeaway. While taking delivery, I had a few packets in my hand, so did not bother checking the final contents. I asked them several times, though, to reconfirm if the pack contained all the items. They checked my bill with the items packed and confirmed. God knows what they tallied. When I came home, I found the velvet cupcake missing. It was not worth the trouble going back all the way for it. And their number is forever busy! So the only place I can convey the message is here.

To the surprise of "city of joy", another addition to the gastronomic map of Kolkata by "Mukund Hospitality Pvt Ltd" happens to be the flagship outlet of  the famous American bakery chain "Cinnabon" specialized in cinnamon rolls, located right adjacent to "Auntie Annes", at the food court of ACROPOLIS MALL. 
Anyday, the place can make any dessert aficionado to fall for, because of its droolworthy offerings, with a delectably delicious taste. The moment you take a bite, it takes you to a world of divine fantasy, with the melodious notes rolling down your taste buds.
A fantastic place to check in, and must visit for any dessert lover out there.
Well done

After hearing a lot about this american bakery joint in acropolis mall..  i thought of giving it a shot.. well, the worst coffee experience ever in my life. I ordered two regular cappuccinos which were served in two big glasses.. it seemed as if someone has handed me a big glass of milk where a tablespoon of coffee accidentally fell.. it was disgusting. Then i went and spoke to them to change it. They did without any further argument. The 2nd time. It seemed that they added a pinch of coffee more. But still it was edible. We also ordered a cinnabon classic which was way better and tasty. Well, nothing to say much. Had a horrible experience..

When I saw the American bakery giant coming to the town, in Acropolis Mall, I was excited to take a shot of it right away. Cinnamon roll is what it is known for in all the 30+ countries it operates. However, I was in an experimental mood and ordered a medium Chocolate Chillatta. The drink is a cold coffee based with a lot of cream topping containing good amount of coffee content. Overall it wasn't satisfying enough. Additionally I also went for iced mocha; a chocolaty drink with blend of coffee and cream and a much better option than chillatas.
Hope to visit again and try the cinnamon rolls next time.

Kolkata in the last two years have become home to some of the most globally recognized eateries around the world, and the latest one to join them are cinnabon. Situated on the 4th floor of acropolis mall it is the most attractive looking outlet in the food court and is bound to catch the attention of anybody and everybody around the food court. My review us solely based on a single item i had from here, so it might be a little biased. I was in acropolis mall for some work and was a bit hungry. As i wanted to try this place out from a long time so i decided upon this place at once. I ordered a mini chocoban and a cafe mocha. The mini chocoban was something very new to my taste. It was delicious and i enjoyed every bite of it. The taste was very palatable and the chocolate in the bun was amazing. The cafe mocha was good too, nothing extraordinary but the quantity was a lot compared to the price. I was so full after that mini chocoban that i coudnt order anything more. Highly reccomended from my side if craving a taste of something unsusual. For me, i am definitely going back and trying their famous pretzels on my next visit.

Came to Acropolis on a Thursday evening and I made sure to try Cinnabon. I had the Chocolate Chillata Shake. It was topped with whipped cream which looked pretty tempting. However the shake was a bit too watery. I wish it was a bit more thicker, it would have tasted even better.

The world renowned Cinnabon is now here located in the City of Joy. So why not try it? And I did try it and it really is yummy! Yes maybe it's a bit too sweet for my palate but people with the sweet-tooth would thoroughly enjoy it more than me just as some of my friends did. Plus the classic cinnabon looks so good it does 50% of the work! A must-try.

The Pretzel Pizza is a new addition to their menu. Well when they say on their billboards that you'd forget other pizza joints after having theirs', they very well knew what they were promising. And they kept their word. Crunchy thin crust, cheese almost overflowing out of the crust (thanks to no chewy outer crust border) and unmatched flavour. A must-try. They should add more variants to their pizza line :D Good job, Cinnabon!

I have had cinnabon in the USA for a long time. Really happy that this brand came to kolkata as well. the sweet ¬†cinnamon, chocolate buns are the ones I would recommend. You usually cannot finish the regular bun alone so the minibons are the way to go. (the sizes are US sizes which are huge)

I usually get a 4pack of the minibons packed for eating as breakfast. Dip in milk/coffee and it is yum. the taste is quite similar to the US version and the addition of the chocolate buns is great. I would warn that those who don't like cinnamon flavour should try the chocolate buns as the cinnabon is quite strong in cinnamon. The pecan buns are a bit of a let down without much pecan flavour in the frosting and only some chopped pieces on top as also the new blueberry buns with their artificial tasting sauce and are the reason i have given a 4.0 and not a 4.5 rating.
            

oh and if it is not sweet enough for you they sell frosting separately as well.

Is it weird I like their beverages better than cinnabons? *thinks hard*
The cinnabons look tastier than they are. The white buttery syrup is heaven, but that apart there's nothing much to the bun really. So it's not nice when it cools sufficiently for the syrup to harden. But the shakes are outrageously delicious! Totally in love!

They say cinnamon makes everything better and Christmassy. Cinnabon does every bit of that. The rolls are light, just crispy right, and not overpoweringly sweet. The 'classic' cinnabon is the goods, bettering even the blueberry makeover. The rich and deep taste lingers in your mouth and the intoxicating aroma stays with you for a very long time. If you are dining at a restaurant at Acropolis, choose the dessert option from the cinnabon bakery . You can take the bakery home with their packs- cinnapack (pic attached) for the ultimate indulgence!

The aroma of cinnamon called me to this stand while on my way to watch a movie which is right next to the entrance of the cinepolis. I got a mini cinnabon as the regular ones are HUGE. The bun was soft and fluffy, had a nice cinnamon taste and was not overly sweet. Wish they had an own cafe with nicer seating arrangements.

Went to the outlet to try a cinnamon for the first time, priced on a higher scale cinnamon classic was great full milky and sugar, though it could be better with less sugar, but the chocobon was totally awfull, just a cinnamon with chocolate sauce poured over it disgracing the taste a classical cinnamon has rather than adding value to it.

It's a food court, so ambience as-is.
Food is decent. I ordered pepperoni pretzels, chocobon (essentially a cinnamon roll) and a regular latte. 
Firstly, pretzels were good but missing the distinctive crunch. The pepperoni was not that well-salted and was pre-prepared meaning it lost most of its flavour.
Chocobon was again alright, it was not too sweet, there was some salt to spruce things up. It was missing the sugary taste you'd expect on the inside and was way too chewy.
The latte was well, satisfactory. I'm literally a coffee buff and that felt like foamed Bru Gold. The quantity was alright. Also, they failed to provide us with stirrers and plastic cutlery knives. 
The service time was average and employees were courteous but kept insisting us to buy more and better food.
The pricing is not that good, to be honest. 700 for 2, with some items costing way too much and others as normal.

While in Delhi Cinnabon used to be my soul comfort,  and when they opened  in Calcutta,  I was really  excited. 

Picked up some cinnamon  and some chocolate ones for my family,  and they were terrible,  nothing like Delhi.  Dry and woody and so overtly sweet that one would get a sugar rush. 

Just plain old disappointed.  

P.s. Those cupcakes look like a 6 year old made them .

I've only tried their classic cinnamon bun and i really liked it. There was too much of cinnamon in it but it was worth a try. Each cinnamon bun had a sugar and butter icing , which added to the richness of it. Since I got it packed , there were specific heating instructions in the box which I think was pretty considerate for them. Would definitely order / have their food again.

Being a food buff, I remember seeing one of the popular TV Shows at TLC, where one day, the host would venture out to a cafe which specialized in making Cinnamons. No different than donuts, these are just swirled and twirled in a certain way with the icing and then a handful of syrup is poured over to it, something similar which might happen to our traditional Malpoas.

This is the first time, I was having a thing of this kind, so I wouldn't be speculative enough! However, I could certainly tell, that the Cinnamons were not properly made. The sweet sauce didn't pierce through the entire surface. The sugar was mostly visible and went undissolved. Even though I had ordered for Minibon Classic, I found a major portion of Chocolate in between. Hope, they did not confuse something else for Minibon.

The trick to warming these things are to keep them in the oven hardly for 10-20 seconds max. Any longer,and the crust would get hard and chewy. The pricing is definitely not on the lighter side and would hurt your pockets if you have a sweet tooth tickling your taste buds quite often. I hope we get ventures of similar kinds in our city so that we can compare the likes between them and helps us choose the better one!

I had the cinnabon bites with caramel sauce. The bites were fluffy and tasty but the caramel sauce was TOO sweet. Actually it could hardly be called caramel. It was like someone had melted a roll of alpenlibe and added some more sugar and packed it in a tiny bowl. I also got a vanilla cupcake. The cupcake was dry and again, the frosting is too sweet. In fact, it had so much sugar that the frosting felt sandy on the tongue, the surface was crusty with undissolved sugar. A big no.

I was quite eager to try this place out after reading some really nice reviews. I must say my experience was quite okay. Don't get me wrong, it was actually nice, but I guess I just expected excellence and as a result wasn't quite impressed. 
I tried the chocobon (loved by everyone apparently) and it was quite tasty. But after a few bites, I couldn't take it anymore. It was nice, buy only to a certain extent. Also, the icing by itself had a flavour (which I have definitely tasted before but can't put my finger on!) which I didn't quite like. So yes, a decent experience.......above average...........but was it really that great? No. Would I be dying to come here again? No........ And hence the rather average rating. 
Though I do think, that one must definitely try this place out because palettes differ and maybe you might actually love it like a lot of other people! Happy Dining!

Was very excited to have cinnabon in Kolkata!!! Had wonderful food the few times that I had visited. But today was a disaster. Ordered pepperoni pretzel and sausage roll, the order took 20 mins and the food was uncooked. The outside layer was black but inside the dough was still uncooked. They agreed to replace it. The second time it came burnt and we had to cancel and leave. They did gracefully refund,but we left with a very heavy heart. Hope the quality standard improves,very disappointing!!! Will definitely want to go back.

This is the most attractive looking food joint in the acropolis food court. One is bound to get attracted by it. Planning before Hand to try some dessert from this joint I ordered red velvet cupcake and chocobon.  The red velvet cup cake was priced at rs 75 (excluding tax). The size is quite small and it was very very sweet though soft and was not dry. I have had much better red velvet cakes so it did not impress me at all also the price is pretty high considering the quality and taste. The chocobon was very new to my taste bud and really delicious and one must definitely try it out. It was priced at rs 125 excluding the tax. I remember clearly writing a review long ago but suddenly I noticed that it got deleted some how and I have no clue how it happened. I would definitely visit it to try their other interesting items.

[Intro]
A small joint but yet here you will find some good foods as well as drinks too.some of the unique foods,consist of cadbury filling all over it,not only outside inside too.too yummy foods,cheesy chicken filling inside some of them.excellent collection of cup cakes.the decoration of foods will blow your mind,the foods they serve here sweet and very fresh.

Went for a food audit with my foodie friends and out special food group,it was a marathon food tasting we started our food tasting from this section,located in Acropolis mall food court very near to cinepolish and just beside the auntie Annie.

[Foods & drinks]

It's all about the sugar, cinnamon, fresh baked buns and dogs and cheese and pretzels and muffins and oh my god, I can go on and on about. Tell me who wouldn't like all of this in one plate and still keep asking for more. There's nothing about this place that won't make you happy. Go there if you've had a hard day at work and want to treat your self to  a warm Pretzel Dog or if you are really kind to yourself grab a Pepperoni Pretzel, that my friend is the winner! Oh don't forget the warm sugary syrup dripping Classic Cinnabon, it will almost be a crime to walk out of that place without tasting that little beaut! I love going back to this place because the food here is what the happier things of life is all about. 

Psssssttt. There's also amazing coffee for coffee lovers. Or so I have heard from some. :D

Cinnabon- The new outlet at the food court of the Acropolis mall reminds me of some old english TV series and movies. Finally Kolkata people got the chance to taste them as well.

What I tried:
1. Classic Cinnabon: Loved it .. Must try but my friend took chocobon which tastes even better if you ask my suggestion.
2. Pretzel: It good as expected
3. Red velvet cake: I completely loved the red velvet cake and they tasted so nice.

USP: 
->Brand name 
-> Live counter which serves you fresh made stuffs you order.

I would recommend this place to all the food lovers as it's a must try unit for you all. Go ahead and enjoy :)

And thus began the whole new food journey again. #revamp_kolkata
The food audit
Meet Courtesy: Panch Phoron

Since we were all dog tired in the heat, we wanted to start off with some refreshers. That is when we chose to start off with Cinnabon. The first outlet of Cinnabon was a major surprise as it was an official launch of cinnamon sticks to the Kolkatan palate.

Location: Food court of Acropolis mall. Walk straight towards Cinepolis and on the extreme right corner stands Cinnabon.

Decor and Ambience: since it is a joint in the food court, the decor ambience is marked by the hustle bustle. But the fact that the red velvet cake, cinammon cakes, cupcakes are on display will make you feel hungry.

Staffs : the manager of the floor introduced us to the manager of Cinnabon and he was extremely happy to meet us. The other staffs were very welcoming and amicable.
 
Coming to the food of course.
Beverages:
1. Raspberry lemonade - the Raspberry lemonade was fizzy and the taste of rasperry itself stood out. Although if it was a bit more pulpy, I would have definitely loved the affair.

2. Pomegranate lemonade- similarly tasted quite like what Pomegranate tastes like. It was light and cool. 

3. Blue lagoon lemonade- this was really very refreshing. The cool blue lemonade left back a fizzy pop on the taste buds to cherish.

4. Mango chillata - the concept of chillata dates back to Greece where in smoothies was an accompaniment to the evening snack. The mango smoothie was just made the way it should have been, the pulp, the smooth blend and the rich taste created all the difference.

5. Strawberry chillata - the smooth , frozen blend will be quite a relief when you have to fight the tropical summers of kolkata. The strawberry flavour stood out and I wish I would never have stopped sipping it. 

Desserts:
1. Cinnabon classic - it is indeed an undeniable experience . The cinnamon roll is possibly made from the best quality cinnamon and the aroma, flavour , taste- it all stood out. The fresh-baked dough is the stuff that dreams are made of. Sweet, rich cinnamon-filled dough creates all the magic and the taste retains in the taste buds for ages to come.

2. Chocobon - this was indeed a sin , rather I would say it was death by chocolate. I believe this is one of the best Desserts that kolkata can ever think about. Its intoxicating, intense flavor and sophisticated aroma is impossible to imitate. the cinnamon-laden dough and the amazing cream-cheese frosting alternating with the chocolate that decides to explode from in between is hard to resist. This is surely an experience of a kind. I would definitely recommend this to the whole of Kolkata as it is not worth missing.

Value for money : from what I feel, the prices are decent according to the quality that they offer, especially thr cinnamon rolls and the chillatas.however I feel that the lemonades are on a steeper price range.

I have possibly visited the joint innumerable times, because it tends to be addictive. Cinnabon classic and Chocobon is hard to resist and you can never have enough of it.

A huge thank you extended to Acropolis Mall Management for the warm invite.
Buddy

Their Minibon is probably one of the finest confections in the world ! Not too sugary, neither too syrupy, the warm roll just tantalisingly melts and vanishes in your mouth. Had their Cafe Americano which too was a great refreshing beverage. Located in the bustling, comfy food court of Acropolis mall, a sweetaholic or a dessert lover should definitely try out the snacky treats at Cinnabon, if not their delicious cinnamon rolls.

Went for dinner to Asia Kitchen, after that we stopped at Cinnabon. We ordered the pretzels and the classic Cinnabon. I din like the pretzels, and most my family members also did not like that. But the classic Cinnabon was great. It was actually very nice.

Cinnabon is a chain of renowned American bakery and cake shop (or kiosk) founded in 1985. After few change of ownerships the headquarters of Cinnabon was shifted to Greater Atlanta in 1999. It is normally found in malls and places where you find high public gatherings and it is well-known for its signature cinnamon rolls! When it first started off in December 1985 it only served these classic cinnamon roll at the SeaTac Mall, Washington. Today Cinnabon is found at airports, malls, universities, rapid transit stations, casinos, and amusement parks. Apart from US, it is also present in Canada, UK, Poland, Egypt, etc. And now it is also present in India and at our very own city of joy! Kolkata got its first Cinnabon outlet when it opened up a kiosk at Acropolis Mall (Kasba) at the Food Court.¬†

These wonders are prepared with some instant yeast, unsweetened plain almond milk, butter, salt, unbleached all purpose flour, ground cinnamon, organic cane sugar. But there is another secret which I can share - the cinnamon used in their Cinnabons is called "Makara" cinnamon, discovered in the mountains of Indonesia, and is exclusively used in all their products!
                                          ...

I have been to Cinnabon more times than i can count. Whenever i'm at Acropolis Mall, a visit to Cinnabon is a must. Most of the times Cinnabon's the reason i go to the mall. It is located in the food court of the Acropolis Mall and the aroma of the cinnamon rolls will draw you to its exact location-just follow your nose.
I have tried the Cinnabon Classic, Minibon, Chocobon bites, Chocolate cupcake and loved all of them. The Cinnapacks are ideal for takeaway- all you have to do is reheat the rolls and enjoy them. The Cinnapack is a pack of 4 or 9 but after you've had one,you're left feeling full although you want to reach out for one more.
Will surely visit again soon.

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION:

CINNABON, Cinnabon is a chain of American baked stores and kiosks, normally found in areas with high pedestrian traffic such as malls and airports. But this brand of kiosk is located inside the Acropolis Mall Food Court at Kasba. The look of the place from far make you drag urself to this outlet and the confident look of the desserts and bakery they provide certainly crave you for more.

Went there being a respected Member of the #PanchPhoron group. It was an invite from the Acropolis Mall food court Management. It was an honour to be at the awesome place for the food audit and been a part of the most dynamic Expert Panel.

AMBIANCE AND SERVICE:

Its on the food court of the Mall at the third floor so its a common sitting for everyone, thou we were given a separate sitting for our comfort. Its a Self service so you have to serve urself.

FOOD AND DRINKS:

DRINKS tried were in the forms of  Chilattas and lemonades:

1. Raspberry

2. Blue lagoon

3. Pomgrenate 

4. Mango Chillatta

5. Strawberry Chillatta

We began with the welcoming Raspberry drink which came on the table. Was looking decent filled with couple of ice cubes. The first sip was simply not so pleasing to be honest. It was sweet but there was more of water flavour than of raspberry because of the melted ice cubes. 

Blue Lagoon was decent to me not the very best i can say as it lacked the fizz in it and the charm. The pomegrenate was the pick of the drinks we had for the afternoon till then. It consisted the flavour, every sip was equal even taken after 10 mins. 

Chillattas were on the other hand were something to be talked about. Three flavours were tasted here with Mango doing the job perfectly. The mango taste never fails and they really made it sure than it hits our tounge. Strawberry on the other hand was also satisfactory to me. It may differ with many people but i liked the taste and flavour. The coffee flavoured Chillatta if i am not wrong then it was disappointing. It lacked the taste. It was very thin and ordinary. All the Chillattas were whiped with ice cream topping over the  drink which made it look cute.

1. Chocobon

2. Chinnabon Classics

3. Original Pretzel

4. Pretzel Dog Chicken

5. Cheese Sticks

Later the table was served with some very fine Chocobon and Chinnabon classic. With these stuffs it proves they mean business over here. For all who love sweet dishes are recommended to try it ones. Chocobon was soft and topped with Chocolate sauce. Breaking easily and simply awesome is the word. Whereas Chinnabon was equally kept us interested wit the attractive looks. This time it was topped with cream sauce and perfectly done. These desserts needs to be on the top list.

Going down to the Pretzel, Pretzel Dog Chicken and cheese sticks at the bottom. So the pretzel is all bread with sweet on the top. It is mainly to be taken with Tea or coffee or related drinks. Not to be eaten solely.

The Pretzel hot dog was amazing. The bread crust crust was soft and the chicken in between was soft and tasty. It was beautifully made. Cheese sticks at last was fine. Long bread sticks were topped with cheese and yet it is also to be taken with a drink or sauce.¬†

QNQ AND PRICES: 

Quality of each and every item we tasted was spot on with the quality and quantity. No questions on that. Prices are pinched very pocket friendly with the type of drinks and eateries they provide.

CONCLUSION: 

With the first visit here was a mixed one but still very satisfied with the items we had. All the preparations are right in front of your eyes. Everyone here surely gonna love this place for the desserts. I wish them all the luck and hope they come up with more of those in coming future.

And finally Thanking the Acropolis Mall Management once again for the oppurtunity.

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

Cinnabon is one of the newest International brand to arrive in Kolkata. located in the food court of Acropolis mall. its their fourth outlet in India, first one in Kolkata after one in Delhi & two in Bangalore. So does Kolkatans have a new reason to celebrate? Let's find out.
As a member of #PanchPhoron group we were invited for a food tasting event on 18.03.16.¬† A brief review of the food we had is given below.

1. Chillatas & Lemonades:
They offer milk based Chillatas which are a variation of smoothie with whipped cream on top. The strawberry & mango ones were good. the mochalatta & nutella weren't. Add to that the fact that the lower half of the drink was too runny, while the top part too thick. I for one, would like a more consistent drink.
They offer Soda based lemonades in the cold variety & a selection of coffee based drinks in the hot beverages too. The summer afternoon compelled us to go for the cold ones.
I tried raspberry,blue curacao & pomegranate lemonades. Honestly speaking apart from the pomegaranate, the raspberry was too sweet while the ciracao was too sour for me.Personal opinion, others may find them better.

2.Cinnabon & Chocobon classics:
These are their signature products. & ofcourse these didn't disappoint. Some may find the excessive sugar icing on the top a bit too sweet, but these are desserts remember. They are a treat for sweet lovers. Their claim of using imported cinnamon powder shows in the taste. Also the really soft layers of dough is as heavenly as the cream wrapped in between & on top. If you are not that much of a sweet lover keep to the chocobon & don't order cinnabon.

3.Original Pretzel ,Pretzel Dog & cheese sticks
The Pretzels are freshly prepared here, which shows. However they are very lightly sweetened on the top, so don't try that after a sweet dish. Also they are best enjoyed with tea or coffee, so don't make the mistake of having it all by itself.
The Pretzel dog. A variant of the standard Hot dog was outstanding. Remember to order the Cheese variant which tastes more than outstanding.
The Cheese sticks seemed pretty average to me. May be a li'l bit more cheese will do the trick or some accompanying dip.But still a good snack nonetheless.

The drinks were unimpressive. Some too sweet, some not just attractive enough. But as for the bakery items those are too good. Freshly prepared the breads are soft, while the outer crusts'light sweetness doesn't overpower the inner bread. Best enjoyed as an afternoon snack with a cup of tea or coffee, these can satisfy our midnight cravings as well.Loved their Cinnabons.. Will visit again for those. Next time will check out their signature coffees for sure.
Till then happy eating.
Cheers

Finally Cinnabon opens its first outlet in Calcutta in the food court of Acropolis mall, just beside Cinepolis. It was a food tasting event in the food court of Acropolis Mall, arranged by 'Panchphoron' group. We decided to start with cinnabon.

Since we were thirsty, we wanted to taste their drinks. We ordered lemonades and chilattas. I didn't like the lemonades, specially the raspberry and blue laggon. The raspberry was very sweet and the blue laggon lacked fizz and was somewhat bland. The pomegranate lemonade was however good. It was not much sweet and was fizzy. Among the chilattas, I liked the mango and the strawberry ones. They were awesome. Chilatta is a milk based drink, topped with cream, similar to a smoothie. The nutella chillata was however inconsistent and less dense in comparison to the others.

Coming to the food, we tried chocobon and cinnabon classic. In both the cases, the bread had a very soft texture and was well baked. The chocobon was topped with a chocolate sauce which was very nice. This was a great dish. However the cream cheese sauce at the top of the classic cinnabon was too sweet for my palate.

We also tried their famous pretzel which is a baked bread shaped into a twisted knot. I felt it was a little dry. Moreover, when dishes like chocobon are there in the menu, then it won't be wise to order a dry dish like this. However, the pretzel dog chicken was excellent. The bread was soft and was filled with cheese and a chicken sausage. Lastly, we tried the cheese sticks which were good.

Overall, cinnabon is one of the better places to dine in the food court of Acropolis. The pricing is actually cheap, keeping into account that cinnabon is an international brand. Would surely recommend the chocobon, chillatas and the pretzel dog chicken to all my foodie friends!

Would like to thank the management of Acropolis mall for organizing this event and making it a successful venture !

Overall, cinnabon is one of the better places to dine in the food court of Acropolis. The pricing is actually cheap, keeping into account that cinnabon is an international brand. Would surely recommend the chocobon, chillatas and the pretzel dog chicken to all my foodie friends!

Would like to thank the management of Acropolis mall for organizing this event and making it a successful venture !

It's been a while I have started to have a huge craving for dessert and patisserie. So how could I be missing on this joint ? It was my first visit to Cinnabon.
It's a small outlet they have opened in Acropolis Mall Food Court. The service providers have been maintaining a good hygiene which is quite impressive. 
We had ordered for:
‚Ä¢ Mini Cinnabon Choco Rolls - The Cinnabon Rolls were fresh and soft. It had an intense falvour  within with lots of liquid chocolate over it. Tasted amazing and also totally satisfied my craving.
‚Ä¢ Red Velvet Cupcake - This was a tiny red cupcake topped with lots of white cream. This cupcake also tasted great. It was soft and fresh.

The service was quite fast. And I would surely look forward to make a visit again to this place.

Located in acropolis mall, this is the first ever outlet in Kolkata. I heard a lot about this from my brother. Though I was in a hurry so all I could pick was a chocobon for myself and it was delicious. The staffs are quick and helpful. It is on my list for another visit since I want to taste their other items too. Will be back soon :P

Expensive and worthless.
Cinnabons are just pankcake/waffle kind of dough buns with added sauce and syrups. There is absolutely no significant difference in tastes of waffles and pancakes or even crepes too. I tried the chocolate mini bun, that small piece of ___ costs 100 bucks. Its rather better to satisfy yourself with a good piece of cake. Its only made to try once, nothing special. 
They claim to make fresh buns daily but the as expected the dough comes from cold storage. The same philosophy is followed by Dominoes, freshly baked pizza with old dough and toppings from cold storage, Americans at their best of fooling and deceiving people.

Never been much of a fan of Cinnamon Rolls really and American food do make you fat, so I try and avoid American fast Food joints as much as possible, but chancing upon Cinnabon at the Acropolis Mall, I decided to give it a try and made a mental note of Jogging an extra Kilometre afterwards. The Classic Cinammon rolls were soft, moist, topped with a thick cream and a little too sweet for me, so much so that I couldn't finish the whole thing off alone. Service was prompt and I was actually enjoying seeing them make the various Pretzels and Cinnamon Rolls live. Also, they need to work on their cupcakes. They looked sad and dead with clumsy pink frosting, I didn't taste them though.

I havent tried cinnamon rolls before. So even though I cant compare it to a previous experience,I can say the chocobons I had here didnt convince me enough about this particular item.
However,not considering my personal preferences,they were pretty nice. The rolls were soft,fluffy and served fresh. Toppings were good too.
But I am not sure if I'd like to try them again.¬†
Besides that,I feel its a little costly considering what it is made of.

I was bowled by the freshness and d quality of food Cinnabon serves. We had 4 sets mini Choco rolls n 1 big classic roll one chocolate cup cake n hot dog. The Chocorolls were glazed properky n d roll itself was fresh n just d right bite. The cup cake couldve been softer as the cake itself was a lil dry n grainy in texture. I just fell in love with d classic cinnamon roll with the pearl white glaze. The hot dog was d best I ever tasted n as if it was an example of freshness. Properly baked it was a delight to devour. Poolng forward to sample d pretzels n other goodness in d menu

I was very excited about Cinnabon coming to Kolkata since I was waiting to try their cinnamon rolls as shown in many movies of the West. I had been to Acropolis Mall last week to do some work and in spite of visiting the new restaurants that have come up recently, we came to try here. But I was utterly disappointed. We decided to try the Pepperoni Pretzel, although the staff suggested to try their Pepperoni Strombolli. Stuffed with cheese and pepperoni, it was okay because that didn't taste like anything either. The chocolate and classic cinnamon bites were okay, below average to be specific. You can try out other places at the Acropolis Food Court as they have much better options than this place.

I always wanted to try cinnamon rolls. Though it is a small take away but they sell oven fresh products all day long. The baking process is continuous. The aroma of freshly baked pretzels nd rolls will capture you from far. The taste is awesome. Will try pretzels next time. I had mini chocobons nd chocolate cupcakes.

Tried cinnabon last weekend. The place was quite crowded, as expected. 
I liked the variety. Having tried pretzels in Germany i wasnt really interested in trying. Though they looked pretty decent. 
I opted for 4 mini choco buns and 4 pecan buns. As per the instructions i heated them in the micro. Being a fan of cinnamon buns i really liked them and im really happy that we finally have an outlet in cal. 
Friendly staff and great service. 
Looking forward to my next visit.

Growing up, I had seen too many youngsters in foreign movies and sitcoms, hogging on pretzels and cinnamon rolls. I often wondered how they would actually taste, and would conjure up a particular smell and taste in my head to match the image. Finally, when I got to taste them in Delhi last year, I was ecstatic to realize my imagination was spot on. Thankfully Cinnabon has opened up in Kolkata too, and has made me a happier soul. Yayyy!

I went for their best selling Classic Cinnamon Roll and needless to say that true to their brand credibility I enjoyed every bit of the swirling cinnamon roll enveloped between dollops of cream. What set it apart from the usual desserts well it has to be the the fusion of cinnamon.

Finally the city of joy gets to taste the much lauded pretzels and cinnamon rolls. This outlet ¬†in the food court of Acropolis Mall, is quite eye candy and you cannot ignore those shiny sugar dusted pretzels or the oozy chocobons on dispay. We thoroughly enjoyed our pillowy sweet-savoury  Sesame pretzel and Latte. Red velvet cake was just about ordinary though. I wish to taste their savoury pretzels the next time around. prices are tad bit high for just a cuppa but then you do get fancy at times! Overall an exciting new place you cannot afford to miss.

Good to see a true American confectionery at the nearest mall. All those sweet tooth Kolkatan's tired of having the traditional pastries and sweets should certainly try Cinnamon rolls, which are yummy and has a fresh flavour to it. Its soft and refreshing, and works wonders if its paired up with coffee. It should be enjoyed with time and will definitely lift up the dull mood. Just one suggestion is to provide the prices of the stuff in the showcase as some are really exorbitant. cheers !

Another American fast-food joint makes its foray in Kolkata. Cinnabon is globally famed for cinnamon rolls. This joint is conveniently located at the newly opened Acropolis mall. The menu is at par with global counterparts and offers almost all of the items that Cinnabon has to offer. I tried the pecan minibon. It was delightful, the pecans giving it the right crunch and the caramel leaves a sweet after-taste. The mini one was good at about INR 110. However, be warned that its too sweet and you may feel like u wouldn't want another bite after the first few ones. So, a good thing would be to start with the mini rolls (mini rolls are available for most of the flavours).

Its good to see chains like Cinnabon finally make there way to Kolkata. Their Cinnamon Rolls which are their signature dish are pretty yummy and good for sinful indulgence. Not the most pocket friendly option though I must confess I enjoy the guilty please on occasion. Pairing a Cinnamon Chocolate Roll with a steaming cup of Coffee is sheer happiness.

So the Cinnabon opens in Kolkata.

I really give it to the Americans for taking an ordinary product and make it a worldwide spectacle...e.g : McDonald's,KFC,Windows by microsoft,Ford......the examples are numerous.

It depends on clever marketing,sharp positioning and having at least one U.S.P in this case being the cinnamon flavoured or filled buns.

I had a chicken hotdog with cheese which was seriously good.The sausage cooked perfectly wrapped in a sheet of cheese and rolled with bread.....filling and tasty.

I had the mandatory Cinnabon signature roll which was quite ordinary and elastic.

The Americano was pretty ordinary as well.

In short there was nothing that someone's grandma will not do better in the kitchen but that's the ingenuity of the Americans I was speaking about.

Hi foodies!

=Brief Intro=
So Cinnabon finally makes its presence felt in the City of Joy after Mumbai and Delhi. My fellow foodies were quite excited about this but frankly, I didn't like the look of them. I Googled about it and saw that it was quite famous abroad. So basically its an American baked goods store that is famous for it's Cinnamon Rolls. They use 'Makara' cinnamon which is supposedly, the best. Also used is the fresh cream frosting and brown sugar.

=Food=
I was apprehensive but as a foodie, you should experience everything. If you're wondering whether you'd like it or not, try the Cinnabon Bites like we did. They're the smaller versions of their Cinnamon Rolls. To be frank, I kinda had a mixed experience. You may like it after the first few bites like I did. Or you may like it at the first bite and after a while, the sugar may be overwhelming, like it was for my friend.¬†

=Endnote=
They have other items you can try too! Overall, not totally distasteful. May give it another go. ¬†:)

-Bon App√©tit.

Located inside the food court in the newly opened Acropolis mall, Cinnabon was on my wish list for long!
I ordered for their caramal pecan cinnamon roll and was impressed with the portion.
The taste was good during the first few bites.
Thereafter the taste started bothering me and it was too sweet for my liking!
Maybe, cinnamon rolls aren't my thing.

The one I had was for 190 bucks, so I guess it's not pocket friendly either.

Visited this new tempting and sought after stall in Acropolis food court. I was absolutely lured by the smell of the freshly prepared pretzels and other rolls and deserts!!!!! I gave it a first shot for Mini peacabon and it actually was yummilicious!!!! With bread thoroughly dipped in some honey and caramel syrup and topped with dry fruits. A simple preparation yet was finger licking!!!! Would surely like to hit this place again to try their other items!!! A definite add on to the list of leading bakeries in the city!!!
