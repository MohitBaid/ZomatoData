The menu in zomato is old and prices are almost 1.5 times as mentioned.

We ordered Crispy chilly babycorn and Coffee.

Preparation was Normal

Prices are on higher side as compared to their servings and preparation. Their Garlic bread is worst.

we especially went to drink Tea which we like most.

But that day, "they said they got more crowd so they cannot serve tea and asked to go for Coffee."
We could not understand the exact reason for that statement because barely their were 15 people excluding us and within 3-4 min we were the only group of 4 sitting there, then also they didn't bothered for our choice.

Located in a narrow lane near the Netaji metro station, this cafe has become popular mainly due to the severe lack of such places in the area.

Ambience: Dropped there on a satday morning. It was empty. So it was nothing fancy.

Food: I had a spicy chicken roll, it was average but keeping the price in mind it was good. Fair amount of small chicken bits make it a perfect evening snack. They also offer some popular shakes and ice creams sundaes. Also have cream bell ice cream. Pasta menu looked appealing although i wont comment without having it.

Staff : It was ok.

Overall: A small place with loads of room for improvement but keeping the pocket friendly price, the place is good. An ideal place for college n school students or those with a strict budget.
I surely give it a thumbs up.

It takes 2mins from my place to reach this so called 'cafe'..
Ambiance: Not good
Food: Worse
Staff: Worst
It seems they had a small space so they just ended up with the idea of a cafe without any proper research..
If somebody is not willing to sit in nearby park but spend some free time then Ice Choco Cafe is the place 👍 .. otherwise it will be a mischoice if somebody is willing to satisfy the taste buds..
p.s. plastic glasses are used to serve water.. 😅

Today I went for the first time here n I had cold coffee n pita bread with chilli chicken. I must say the cold coffee was really good, the pita bread was very soft n the chilli chicken was juicy but the gravy I found was extra tangy. It's cheap n the ambience was good.

This cafe located near Netaji Metro Station is a cafe which provides good food and the service is well friendly. One should try out the Brownie shake, the chicken shawarma roll and also the pastries available. The prices are pocket friendly and does not ask for extra tax. The quality and as well as the quantity of the food is good. The only drawback is the space as it is way too short to accomodate large groups. The ambience is nice and brightly lit. One can spend the evening with a small group of friends.

We bumped into this place quite suddenly near kudghat metro mostly run by women.. We had stopped by for coffee but ended up ordering fish fingers and a kit kat sundae.. The coffee was not bad.. And the fish fingers were decent.. The sundae was any day better than a CCD sundae.. The service was on the slower side n a bit disorganised.. They had completely forgotten abt our icecream and after waiting for around 20 mins we had to remind them again. We also noticed there was some confusion with the orders at the other tables as well.. But im sure they will work on it and make it better.. The cafe is a much needed one out there and i wish them well..

This place is located near Kudghat metro station, about a 1 min walk from the metro station towards the right. This cafe does not has a very good ambience. When I stepped in, the cafe workers were sleeping on the chairs,  it had a foul smell and I felt that the place required urgent need of a room freshner. Coming to food, we ordered a white sauce pasta and a chicken egg club sandwich, which was just not upto the mark but edible. Overall, I didn't liked the place really.

Staffs are not well behaved. The quality of the food is definitely not worth the price. Cheese in the pizza smells awfully bad. Also there is a problem of congestion due to small space. None of the spicy items are worth eatable. So, this place is definitely not worth to spend your pennies on.

Well visiting this café actually surprised us
Its cheap over all 
We visited this place on the occasion of a friends birthday
Firstly the staff had some allegations regarding the cake cutting, as a solution they demanded 500 INR extra for just letting us cut the cake
Secondly the staffs seem to have received their training at a slum, they believe in misbehaving with their customers and the time they took to prepare the food was enough for completion of an episode or two of friends
And lastly the food, smell cheese, Smelly items and things enough to give one an experience of diarrhoea. 

So if anyone is looking for getting frustrated and angry followed by a diarrhoea, I highly recommend this place 😑l

It's located near netaji metro station...Just a 2 min walk from the metro station. 
It's a small cafe..apt for students. Service is not so fast and quick. Ambience and inner decor is not so bad.
Coming to food..I bought chicken swarma roll and cornetto mousse. Both of them disappointed me. Chicken swarma roll is just tasteless. If you have tasted swarma before then it will not satisfy you. The chocco cornetto mousse also didn't please me by it's taste. The presence of excess sweetener and too much proportion of nuts have decreased it's taste.

A well needed cafe near Kudghat area , beside metro station n one of my favourite hangout zone, also a very pocket friendly one. Good ambience n decor with some good stuffs also. 
Tried - Mocktails (Mint Lime Soda , Sea Blue) 
            Cheese Chicken Sandwich

            Mango Shake 
            Chicken Burger

All r tasty except chicken burger . Dont know why but it tastes really very poor , too much oily n looks like an unsold item from so many days. Otherwise till now my experience with this cafe is very good . But i would like to suggest them to improve the sitting arrangements i mean if they can extend the area that would be good :)

Cornetto mousse (with dark chocolate cone & fillings , too yummy)

Chicken burger (Very poor quality. It was stale, don't know how many days old !! Burger has mayonnaise & kept in that showcase).

There was no hangout zone or sitting area in Khudghat. So the new cafe is really needed. A cool and colourful place. On our first visit we have chicken tikka wrap, brownie shake and mastani shake. Wrap is tested good. But don't like the brownie shake. It is too watery. Mastani shake is mango flavoured and it's nice. Till now I have visited this place twice. As a coffee lover I have ordered cold coffee on my second visit and I really like it.

*Update* Rated 3.0 now!
Service:2/10- there were 5 diff orders, cakes were served first! Then the nuggets and then fries and burger from the counter at the last and there were quiet a lot of time gap in between! So when I was having my burger(somehow), my friends had already finished waiting for me! Orders should be brought together!

Went there again with my buddies, but was disappointed with the service and food.
Chicken Burger(4/10): It was stale, don't know how many days old! And the thing is, the burger has mayo, kept in that showcase, for hours and maybe days! Mayo is not safe if kept outside(room temperature) for more than a 3-4 hours! Plus, it was stale!

Black Forest Pastry(4/10): Too much of cherries in between the layers of the cake! It suppresses a lot of the flavor!

French Fries(8/10): Was good in quality and quantity. They mix mayo and ketchup to make a sauce, bit they can't serve them separately on request! It saves them some of the effort in mixing!
Chicken Nuggets(8/10): No raw stuff this time. 7 pieces for Rs 90, well cooked. They had put ketchup and mayo on top of it! What if someone doesn't have mayo?

*Older* 4/5 rated
Went there on a Monday afternoon with my buddies.
Not tough to located and the location on the map is accurate.
Ambiance:7/10
Service(7/10): They were friendly and well behaved. Served water when we were midway of our meal.

We got,
Chicken Burger(7/10): The burgers on the menu aren't present, you got to take the one on the display counter. For Rs 50, it's a good deal . Big and juicy, with a delicious patty and a stale cherry on top(I doubt it's cherry) so, keep that aside.

Chicken Nuggets(7/10): It's the frozen stuff from Venky's or Yummiez, so don't expect anything special. For Rs 90 you get 6 pieces with ketchup. In our case, 2 pieces were fried on one side, on complain, they freshly fried 2 more and replaced.

Blue Sea Mocktail(7.5/10): A good serve, but expected a bigger glass. They need to reduce the ice cubes in there. But tastes good and refreshing on a hot summer noon.

French Fries: No rating because we didn't pay for this since, they ran out of actual frozen fries. Trying to complete my order they tried to manage with simple potatoes, fried, which was a disaster. On serving, they did inform me to complain if it's not good, since they made it that way. Did that and they made it complimentary. If they hadn't been honest, it would've had 3/10 😒. Just telling us, that they ran out would have been better at the first place.

The most you see on the menu can't be ordered! So, reduced the rating. Will visit again very soon.

They have to work upon their ambience and service as their was only one lady who was serving the whole crowd. Also the Card could not be accepted due to server error.

This place was much needed in Kudghat area, where an eatery with sitting arrangement was missing. You will find this place really crowded during the evening as they are good :) . The food they prepare is delicious, but the was they serve is even more pleasing. Its quite pocket friendly with many options to choose from the menu. I often visit this place, and love to order Chicken pasta, French Fries, Cold Coffee and Chicken Shawarma. Guys this place is a must visit for all the cafe-hoppers out there near Tollygunge!  A piece of advise to the management of Ice Choco Cafe, the quantity of the food you serve is getting less day by day. You are awesome with quality and taste of the food, just improve the quantity as well. :) :P

Reasonably priced and targeted to college students. Nice food at cheap rates are their speciality. Consequently you cant't ask much for the ambience and interiors. They serve in paper plates and that ok with me as long as the service is fast. Staff is very courteous but are little inexperienced. This locality lacked this kind of place and am happy that it no longer lacks.

So Kudghat finally welcomes a cafe with a proper seating space.Though the place is small the cafe nevertheless doesn't disappoint to foodies like us😊
Located near to the Netaji metro station it has become a place to hang out with friends.Recently went there with my boyfriend.
Ordered KitKat sundae,chicken shawarma,cornetto mousse,chicken kebab roll and brownie shake😊
All tasted delicious😊
Just the place is not sufficient enough for a large group of people to sit😊
As this place is close to my college I tend to visit here whenever I am running out of time.Visited today again.The special mention is peta bread and chilli chicken which is really delicious and tasty.Food here really tastes amazing and is quite cheap.

This cafe is located near kughat metro station...Nearly 2mins walk from the metro...The decor of this cafe is quite impressive..they also play mild music..that really feels good..Now coming to the food..We ordered chicken pasta,french fries,chicken sandwich,chicken tikka wrap,brownie shake and kitkat sandae.

Chicken Pasta:It was amaaazing!!!They provide good portion of chicken..And the white sauce..its soo creamy and delicious...one Advice..doont try their pasta in "red spicy sauce"..cause its really very bad!

French fries: it was also good..though i didn't like the sauce they provided..it was okayish..bt the fries were good...

Chicken sandwich:Sorry i forgot to click the picture..bt anyways..it was okayish..they alot of chicken in it..bt it tasted like "Chaat" i had a feeling like i'm having a chaat on the street..so i wont recommend this one to anyone!!

Chicken tikka wrap:It was good..its not like proper wrap..its more like roll..with egg and chuncks of chicken tikka pieces in it..it has kind of tangy flavour..you can try...

Brownie Shake:It was realllyyy good....there are brownie pieces filled in it..the taste was awwesoome!!Must Try This One!!!❤

Kitkat sundae:It was really good..with kitkat pieces and vanila and chocate ice cream scoops..topped with raspberry sauce...was good...

This cafe is a new and quite a good place to hangout with friends or go with family..will recommend it to everyone😊❤

Located in a lane opposite to the Kudghat Metro Station, this is a small shabby cafe with a modest seating arrangement. We were a group of 5 and we ordered Chicken Wifi, Chicken Sandwich, Spicy Chicken Roll, Oreo Shake and Brownie Shake. The Chicken Sandwich and Spicy Chicken Roll were quite large, larger than the ones at Mio Amore or Sugar and Spice. The Chicken Wifi was not upto the mark. The Oreo Shake and Brownie Shake were quite similar in taste and did not differ much. Overall, this shop would prove to be a much needed taste changer from the same old products we have at Mio Amore, Sugar and Spice and Kathleen.

Kudghat area lacked a eatery with sitting space. So this one is first of it's kind. Sluggish service but compensated with quality of food. Pretty clean, colourful and a feel good small place to sit and munch over coffee and snacks. On my second visit we ordered chicken soup which was not so good to taste. On a single feedback without any hassle the staffs wanted us to try something else in place of soup. The staffs as well as the special chicken tikka wrap served both were pretty impressive ❣😊.

It is located near Kudghat Metro Station and only cafe in the locality having seating arrangements with AC. A newly opened joint just 2 mins away from my college, so had to visit it anyway. So, yesterday as the exam ended we decided to give this place a shot.

The ambience and decorations are good for college students like us and the staffs are friendly as well making the place a good one to spend some good time with friends over some good food.

Now coming to the food, we ordered -
Chicken Pakora
Chicken Pasta with white sauce
Oreo Shake
Brownie Shake
Mastani Shake

Chicken Pakora was okay as it was a little more on the softer side than expected and Oreo shake was average as well as it was less sweet than it should be. Brownie Shake was good with chunks of brownie in it. But what made me give the place e (4/5) rating was their Chicken Pasta and Mastani shake.

One of the best Chicken Pasta I had, the sauce was cheesy and delicious and it had a good amount of big chunks of
chicken in it making it worth every buck I paid for the dish. On the other hand, the Mastani Shake was so thick and delicious which complimented the pasta pretty damn well. It had pieces of mango at the bottom of the glass with mango puree on top of whipped cream on the top.

Overall a good first experience. Will surely visit this place a lot as its just 2 mins from my college and can be our spot to spent a good time after college over some good food.

We ordered for:
✔ Mushroom Pasta.

Ice Choco Cafe can be rightfully described as a modernised cafe serving "almost" all the necessities expected from a cafe ; first of its kind located near Netaji metro station is really serving as a tough competitor to the other business enclosures ! A book cannot be judged by its cover, similarly the low reviews does not make this place cornered ....food altogether good , ambience has slightly decreased from day 1 but the decor n hard work of the other working staffs and manager should be praised !!! Price reasonable,at times quite high for the same food served at other places(can't complain much about quality) ; service timings are a bit sloppy....and another negative , they don't serve everything on paper !!! The chicken wi-fi ,brownie shake, burger and few of the mocktails are good ; Seriously needs to have a boost in their work ... anyways thumbs up from my part !!!

Worth it. Nice ambience. Service is not so prompt. Lacks experience. Food was quite cheap and good quality. Now they have revised the price rate recently. Pastries are nice too. Perfect for an evening snacking.

First of its kind in Kudghat area. Ice Choco Cafe has become one hell of a competitor of the nearby food outlets. Though they don't serve everything that's on the menu, but still I'd say the items they serve are pretty decent and very reasonably priced. The quality of the food is maintained from day one, the service may be slow but I won't blame them. They definitely need some time to get accustomed with the business. People are complaining about the food, but I don't get it! Which outlet in the area offers sitting arrangements with AC? I guess not a single one does that. The manager is very friendly, the food quality is pretty good, and they serve some good mocktails too! Keep up the good work. Thumbs up from my side.

Located near the Kudghat Netaji Metro Station. This place is almost like a water-body in the desert. Newly opened and quite popular amongst​ the school going crowd, this place offers a good range of ice-creams, smoothies and juices. Although the food is below average, still I gave a rating of 3.5 as there is a scope for improvement. To open a cafeteria in this part of the city is a blessing anyway.

The new cafe in the town...
Located just near Netaji Metro station, just on the side road from Kudghat bus stand, stands out the cafeteria which provides nominal typical confectionery foods with varieties of Ice cream shakes.
Went to this place last night, as expected in a relatively new food joint, most of the services weren't available and card payment services is not yet installed.... The overall ambiance was extremely stuffy and noisy
Coming to the food part, I had Burger and Cornetto Mousse. Taste wise it can be shortly summed up as I had very ordinary and poor quality burger but somehow, the Cornetto Mousse made up for the taste....
The reason I gave 3 out of 5 instead of 2.5 is because, I still feel that the cafeteria is as new as a-month old and the basic services  will be hopefully improved in about a few months time.

This joint is located just beside the Kudghat bridge.By the look of this place (from outside ),I had high expectations, but I was absolutely disappointed.During my visit(last month),half the items on their menu were not available.
         We ordered Chicken kabab roll and veg pasta.The bread of the kabab roll was dry,the filling was ok. The pasta was also average. They had added a lot of seasoning to the pasta,as a cover up.
Inspite of being empty,the service was slow.
          There are no eateries around the Kudghat area,where we can hangout in the comfort of A.C..In that respect, Ice Choco Cafe has something new to offer.But they should work towards improving the quality of their food and service.

A nice little cafe situated right in front on Kudghat Netaji metro. Its fairly a new place so every item on the menu isn't available yet. Food is affordable and people are friendly. In fact it is the only sit and sip cafes in this part of Tollygunge. A welcome addition.

Ice Choco cafe is situated just down the lane opposite Eastern end of Netaji Metro station at Kundghaat. It is hardly a month old and is a welcome addition in this part of the city where one have only budget takeaways. In this sweltering summer they are providing moderate munches and sips in ac comfort @ budget rates. Not everything in the menu is available yet. And the service is not yet smooth on Saturday evenings. At least they are having a full house. We had chicken wrap, spicy chicken roll, chicken sandwich (listed in decreasing order of taste) along with green tea...mango milk shake and cold coffee...good place to hangout ...in fact the only place here....
