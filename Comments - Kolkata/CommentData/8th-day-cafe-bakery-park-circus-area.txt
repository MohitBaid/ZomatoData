The absolute Best Coffee and bakery in Kolkata . Try the banana pudding or the cinnamon bun for a real American Treat in the ❤️of the city. The nitro coffee is AMAZING.

Nice place to sit back and enjoy with friends. The uncommon interior decor with range of indoor games to chose from adds that uniqueness to this cafe. Tried the red velvet cupcake and it was absolutely divine. The smoothness of the creamy inside and the softness of the exterior was really satisfying. Coffees tasted absolutely perfect with the ingredients added in right proportions. However, the snacks were not that good as were the baked items. Nevertheless, this place is highly recommended for those who is keen to indulge in a different kind of cafe experience.

Last day went to this cafe to grab some brunch. The decor is pretty chic. Now coming to the most important part that is the food. We had ordered Grant's sandwich, and BBQ wrap, a brownie and the day's special Pumpkin pie. The sandwich was decent, so was the wrap. Brownie had the right texture. The pumpkin pie is worth mentioning.
 The downer was that the lady who served us didn't check that there were strands of hair in the pie. Although they promptly changed it, I suggest they pay a bit more attention when they are laying the tables. We had to ask for water, since we didn't take mineral water, and ketchup as well. 
I'm not quite pleased with the service. Hope to be surprised the next time I visit. Don't want to give up on this place so soon.

Amazing. The food . The ambience. Everything. Together was a really nice experience. Gonna definately go back there. 
The owner is so sweet. 
Only thing is they do not serve water. 

I ordered a ceasar salad. A cappuchino. And for deserts an apple pie.  
They were just amazing.

It was on my bucket list for a pretty long time. So I took out the day to tick this off.
The menu was very descriptive, but really did not translate to reality much. I ordered the Peach blossom tea and was nothing like peach blossom. Had I not mixed some sugar, it would be just hot water.

The K-town was good. A bagel turned into burger with a curry than the patty in the middle. This is a total attraction at this place. Do try.

The red velvet muffin was another disappointment. The muffin was very dry. The icing on the top was hard. The sugar levels in the icing was so high that the muffin was literally tasteless.

I really hope you keep up your food to the reputation you carry.
Service is good, clean small place. Lighting is upto the mark. The Ambience is perfect for a nice conversation, though it is a little noisy with all the crowd.
Unfortunately no compliments for the holiday season, I got compliments in a few restaurants and cafes- this definitely add the "wow" factor to your service.

Must visit for people with a sweet tooth. Had some coffee and a red velvet cookie. The location of the place, in a building at a corner of a crossroads, is excellent and the glass windows gives you a nice view of the streets outside.
Prices are just a tad high but be sure to check out the specials of the day.

Visited this place quite a few times. Elegantly painted in white, this cafe emanates a feel-good vibe. Tried their cafe latte, quiche, west range omlette and grant's sandwich. Items were good but they could be improved upon. Latte could have been made more milky, it tastes more like a cappuccino. But their quick service and amazing hospitality will win your heart.

A very, very expensive place. A simple cup of tea will cost 100+ GST, whereas in other similar cafes it will cost at least 20% less. Ambience is good. They sell coffee of their own making, which is obviously extremely high-priced. The snacks are not upto the mark. The preparations are not good and hence do not taste well. But as everything else, these items are overpriced also. The hot chocolate, too, is just plain Cadbury powder being sold at a premium price. It is targeted to mainly the upper-class people who will eat anything, definitely not meant for all.

Went there the other day with my friend after seeing great reviews and ratings on zomato.
First and foremost, the building, it's entrance has a charm to it. It looks like those vintage buildings and its beautiful. The interiors is pretty as well.

Since my friend and I were meeting after a long time, we had a lot of catching up to do, and this place provided the right ambience for it.

Now, coming to the beverages/food. We ordered, Hot Chocolate and Peppermint Hot Chocolate and the least I can say is that it was one of the best that I've had.
Next, we ordered Southwest Hummus Wrap, Bagel Chips with Bean Salsa, and Veg Focaccia Pizza. Each and every dish that we ordered lived upto our expectations. They were scrumptious.

Between the two of us, all these were enough to fill our tummies.

Overall, I am all praises about this place. A big thumbs up!

What a pleasant surprise! You walk in and get an eyeful of bagels and cookies and all things yummy. Quite liked the whole upbeat mood of the place, such a contrast with the (slightly) lazy air of this city.

The decor is pretty sharply done, with nice wooden tables, some of which allow you to stare out onto the street. Plenty of plugpoints, and some board games and books in case you (oh the horror) choose not to stare at your phone while eating here.

Coming to the food, well it's a bit of a hit and miss. The bagel sandwich I had was good but didn't have that "bagelness" that comes with an NYC bagel. Yes, that is vague but I have no other means of describing it. I didn't see a cream cheese option though I'm sure you could get one. The cookie I had (some sort of cinnamomy delight) though was great, and the coffee was pretty good too. 

All in all, a bright little place that I would definitely visit again whenever in that part of the city. Recommended.

8th Day Cafe & Bakery is located at West Range In Beckbagan, near to the Bangladesh Deputy High Commission .It’s really a nice place for breakfast, hangout with friends and also for solo visit. You can also play board games with your partner with the cup of your coffee.

In coffee, Espresso Set was dark and energetic one.

Tried the coffee with Auntie Kay’s Chocolate Chunk Cookie, one cookie is large in size and it’s really amazing ,tasteful.

Red Velvet Cupcake was mind blowing ,freshly baked, delightful.

Service was very good and servers were kind, friendly. Planning to visit it again in a fine Winter morning for breakfast.What a great place!

I have been to a number of cafes but 8th day Cafe has made me feel different about it. Not only good cupcakes or good food, but most importantly the service provided and the ambience was very impressive, and very smooth.The staff were polite, no hustle and bustle and the ambience was worth the time there. Its a pleasant place to hang around with your friends for a nice time and with good food and beverages. The prices are also very reasonable according to the menu which they have put up. To sum it up, If you want a hearty laugh with less of crowd or you want a "Me" time with you and your work or book, then this place serves every bit of it. Yes! I would and will this place again! Thank You so much for the services, it's been a while since such good cafes been put up in Kolkata.

Our visit to the 8th Day Cafe and Bakery was a pleasantly surprising one because they have 'pumpkin specials' on their menu right now! Cute seating arrangements (we were lucky enough to get to sit near the window), aroma of freshly ground coffee, positive vibes, friendly staff, lots of games and books to keep us happy, warm lighting, goodies, gift items and yes, good food at decent prices!

We were there today and spent almost 2.5 hours chatting, eating and photographing the place. This cafe looks warm and inviting even from far away, and adorable drawings on a chalkboard placed just outside the entry lets you know what's special/trending on their menu. That's something we found really cute!

A cab dropped us on the circus avenue, AJC road flyover where we saw a place- Idea Cafe. From there we walked for almost 5 min till we saw the 8th day cafe situated just opposite of the Cordlife India building.

And yes, we did have their very popular NITRO COFFEE. A lot of coffee lovers are interested in knowing how it tastes. Well, it's totally upto you to decide. We loved it! It is a black, cold brew coffee with creamy bubbles on top but It's NOT an iced coffee. We felt it was smoother, silkier and less bitter than a regular cold brew.
It wasn't served with any sweetener or sugar sachets. Good for us, because we never have our coffee with sugar.

The pumpkin pie was something we tried for the first time. Creamy, super smooth, not too sweet, just mildly spiced and well prepared. If you hate pumpkin in your curries, don't cringe. This is perfectly safe to try!

The cinnamon roll was big, sweet and yummy. However, we felt it could have been softer. The cinammon-ey aroma was so good, you'd almost want to wear it as a perfume!

There are plenty of stuffs to buy for yourself and for your loved ones. Paintings, coffees, cookies, jewellery, bags, wallets, coffee equipments, artisan chocolates to name a few.

For us, the only con would be the unavailability of a basic thing- drinking water. We didn't ask them, but we would like to know whether it is available. If yes, the servers could let us know while taking orders. If not, they need to look into this matter. Couldn't see free or packaged drinking water anywhere around us.

Finally, if you love Bengali Cinema, the famous filmmaker ANJAN DUTT dropped in today for a coffee! 😉

Our pocket pinch-
Cinnamon roll- INR 99
Nitro coffee- INR 179
Pumpkin pie slice- INR 119
Taxes- INR 70
Total - INR 468 (no service charges)

From salads to quiche, from burrito to some amazing omelettes, you can choose the best type that suits your taste bud. That apart, they have some fabulous freshly baked cupcakes and cookies. The smell of the coffee makes you feel at home. The French-press is a must have. The prices are extremely reasonable compared to similar places in town. Overall an overwhelming experience.

If not for the Uber that we had booked, we would have never found this cafe. Therefore for those, who want to visit in the near future, the most prominent landmark is the Bangladesh High Commission Building. 

We reached the cafe around 12, and it was already filled with people, mostly foreigners. There was a lot of hustling bustling, and everyone was busy doing their own job.

We got a window side table for 2 and started swiping the menu.

The 2 things that we ordered were -

Cappuccino (Simple): While we were expecting a cup of hot brewing cappuccino, the coffee was served in a coffee mug, and the amount was enough to please us.

Grant's Sandwich: They asked us for our choice of Bagel, and then served this Grant's sandwich. It was pretty big in size, enough to make you feel full. The sandwich contained, lettuce, onion, tomato, omelet, chicken pieces and mayo. 

For those who love spicy food, the food here is not something that your taste buds will appreciate. But then if you like light and English type food, you will love their combinations.

Let's get straight to business
1) Location: Had a hard time to find it. But take my advice if you know Alliance Française du Bengale (the Red Building) just look opposite to it and you will find it.  Another landmark is Bangladesh High Commission, take the lane which is situated beside it and walk for few minutes  and you will be able to locate it.
2) Look and Feel : nice and cozy, a small place where you can sit and spend a good time having coffee and doing some light work or simply read a book.
3) Staff : Nice, friendly, helpful. I think I met the owner ( as a staff member told me) and he greeted us.
4) FOOD: I tried their Grant Sandwich, it comes with fresh veggies, chicken and egg along with your choice of bagel. The sandwich was good and filling and yes tasty. 
Mocha:  It had a subtle bitter sweet choco flavour and the amount they provide it is almost good for two people. 
Apple Pie: It was the star. nicely baked with good amount of apple pieces inside, a little towards the sweet side and will make those with a sweet tooth happy.

will visit again.

Located in the lane beside KB MOTORS on AJC Bose road, near the Bangladesh High commission back gate.

This cafe has the most sleek and classy decor and is well maintained l. Glass door walls and a corner plot beauty!!
Nice comfortable wooden chairs reminding of heritage French cafes and a lovely ambience for a nice evening filled with a long conversation.

They offer sandwiches, quiches, burgers, salads, etc.
Shakes and coffees too!! And then they have a large spread of sweet dishes.

We ordered, a quiche, a chicken barbeque wrap, apple pie, break up brownie, red velvet shake and cold chocolate.

The quiche was excellent, so was the wrap. The red velvet shake was good too but the cold chocolate could have been better.
The best of the lot for me was the breakup brownie!!

Staff was courteous and service was quick!!

Pocket pinch is pretty affordable too.

This is the ultimate cafe to go for a light evening snacks, specially for all those who have a sweet tooth!! We ordered brownie, red velvet cupcake and cappuccino. Everything was perfect...the brownie was moist on the inside and just enough chocolaty. The red velvet too was very moist and the sour cream was not very sour (sometimes it leaves a bad after taste but not this one!!). We did get the GST shock and the bill left a hole in our pockets but it did fill our tummies and our hearts!!

A cosy spacious cafe cum bakery situated at a walking distance of 5 mins from the intersection in front of La Martiniere Girls' School is easy to locate. The decoration is nice and simplistic with some beautiful paintings adorning the wall. The ambience is quite nice and calm. The staff is helpful and helped us select our order. Service could be a bit quicker though. We ordered a hot chocolate, a chai latte, cheese omelette with capsicum and onions and an egg sandwich with cheese and veggies. Both the beverages were simply delectable. I have fallen in love with their hot chocolate. The omelette was fantastic too with enough stringy cheese to make a cheese lover happy. They serve it with a bagel which I found to be tough and not that great. As for the sandwich, it wasn't that good as they used the same type of bagel which turned to be tough as well. It lacked seasoning too. However the other ingredients were nice and fresh. 
A nuisance which came in the form of some houseflies disturbed our meal and we informed the staff regarding the same. Hope they take care of it. 
Overall a satisfactory experience, will visit again to check out their baked items.

Nice place for your occasional sweet cravings. A little expensive but definitely worth it. It's got a nice ambience but the service is a little slow.
Definitely a place to remember

The worst place I ever visited.
Staffs are so cold and lazy as if customers are burden for them.
After a long wait they took order and served us food with a long hair. Yuck.
Such an unhygienic and pathetic service.
Never gonna visit again

Pretty little cafe tucked in the lanes of Park Circus. Its one of its kind giving tough competition to its contemporaries. My personal favourites are BBQ Chicken Wrap, Ice Cream Sandwich & Cold Chocolate. Budget friendly and definitely recommended.

If there's anything that will make you visit this place again is the warm behaviour of the staff. They always have a smile on their face . The crowd is amazing.

A bit disappointed with this place. Went on a Sunday at around 6:30pm, it was full and so we had to wait for about 10mins. The service was not very good, in fact we had to go to the billing counter and ask for a spoon. The menu was also very limited. Coming to the things we ordered were:
Hot chocolate and bagel chip nachos (which were both okay), potato salad (which was very good), auntie Kay's chocolate chunk cookies and the breakup brownie were good, lastly, we had the aubergine ( it wasn't really good).

The decor goes along with the food and gets an 8/10 
The food out here is not THE MANDATORY STIFF WE HAVE EVERYDAY.The latte with extra chocolate makes things tastier ❤
The service staff make us feel HOME.
THIS IS WHAT MAKES CUSTOMERS HAPPY ❤💯

One of the best cafes I have visited in Kolkata. The baristas ( i love to call them so ) are no doubt genial, and prompt. Now, coming to the main part, the " Pourover " was nothing special though the cappuccino made up for that. And the list of teas, its amazing.
Being a tea person, I will make it sure to taste all 15 of them ( if i am not making a counting mistake ) later sometime. Coming to the red velvet cupcake, I just cant forget it..Its an out of the world delicacy. A must recommendation. And the last but not the least, the signature cinnamon rolls, I hoped u were not that sweet.
Overall, a really good place to hit all cafe hoppers, u will also love the ambiance and the price of the items is darn cheap.

8th Day Cafe is a quaint and cosy little place close to Park Circus more. An unexpectedly early class dismissal led us here and it was the best decision ever. Not only is the ambience calm and aesthetic, with large glass windows, a well-stocked book shelf and an array of fun board games, but the food is also really delicious!
We had Red Velvet cupcakes which were just the right amount of sweet and creamy, a BBQ ranch chicken wrap with crispy fresh lettuce which was absolutely mouthwatering and the quite popular Breakup Brownie with a scoop of ice cream on top, which has the ability to heal souls, no exaggeration. Given the quality, the price is quite okay!
Also the staff is really polite and patient, which is an added bonus!
So if you do find yourself in the Park Circus area and are looking for a place to unwind, with some great music in the background and the perfect lighting for your Instagram photos, 8th Day Cafe won't disappoint :)

The location of this cafe is a bit odd but this is one of my favourite cafeterias in Kolkata. The decor and service is amazing here. This place gives you a western vibe and also this place is frequented by foreigners.
Food we had :
BBQ Ranch Chicken Wraps: (4.5/5) it was very filling and tasty as well as healthy too.
Bagel chips with tomato salsa: (4/5) it was yummy too.
Garden fresh salad and cup of soup: (4.5/5) the cup soup was tasty with full of boiled veggies and salad was fresh and colourful.
Cinnamon Roll:(4/5) it was fresh and good.
Chocolate Cupcake: (5/5) best cupcake I ever had. (creamy, fresh ) I just loved it and anyone can surely skip their dieting plans over this.
For beverages we had Iced Latte and mocha, both of these were quite strong.
Pocket pinch is low. Recommended :)

A tad bit disappointed. Even though the service and ambiance was perfect , they lacked in the food department. Auntys kay chocolate chunk cookie was too sweet and the bbq ranch chicken wrap was also not appetising. Even though the portions were generous , i was not happy with the flavours. Coming to the coffee department, i had the conventional latte which was perfectly made. My friend ordered the cold chocolate , which was at first too sweet but they were kind enough to fix it. Service is prompt and the overall feel is good, but i would want the food section to up their game

After all the great reviews I read, my visit here has left me thoroughly disappointed. While the interior design and service totally gets a thumbs up, I can't say the same about the food. 
The service was swift and the lady that took my orders was pretty helpful. 
The food though...

Out of the three cupcakes available here the only one that was actually good was the chocolate cupcake (No, I am not biased towards chocolate). The other two were far too sweet and the cream topping was not soft at all. The sandwich bagle, again, was pretty hard to chew. The hot chocolate had far too much milk and very little chocolate. 
It's a pretty good place for a conversation over some coffee though (I hear the coffee is good, if I do visit again, it'll be for that).

So I went to this place on an evening with my friend over a cup of coffee. This cafe is really warm and on few special occasion they have live jams too. The ice cream sandwich is a good option for people who like cookies. The size of the cookies are large and it's quiet filling . You can also try their pastries as you spend some time playing monopoly or suduko. The place is affordable and is good to spend some time unlike other cafes.
PS - Do check out the painted walls outside the cafe.

Loved this place, the typical "pretty little cafe" feel.
We went on a rainy evening, for having coffee.
What we ordered?
Hazelnut latte , Hot chocolate, Caramel cappuccino.
So satisfied with the hot chocolate :)
The coffees too were nicely brewed and smelled amazing.
Perfect place to catch up have a nice chat and great food .
I would love to go back and try the sandwiches very soon.

This cafe is an absolute must try, simply for its scrumptious delicacies.
Decor of interior is simplistic, nothing extraordinary to be noted except for a few sketchy artistic murals. Ambiance however is cozy and comfy, almost friendly and inviting, well suited for conversations and chilling out with friends. Some light music would have added to the atmosphere.
The food here is the best part. We gorged on their Red Velvet Cupcake, Banana Bread, and drank their popular Hot Chocolate.
The banana bread was crunchy, tasty, and as the menu suggests one perhaps really has to close one's eyes and relishingly savor a slice of home while munching on the sweet bread straight from the oven.
The red velvet cupcake was simply gorgeous to taste, one of the best cupcakes I've ever tasted. With its rosy red hue and snow-white cream cheese frosting (as described in the menu and as it surely flaunts) it indeed was too stunning to ignore!
The chocolate drink was made of house-made chocolate ganache with steamed milk, decorated with pretty heart-shaped latte art on top and served in sufficient quantity in a large mug, inscribed with the Cafe logo (the napkins and plates bear similar inscriptions as well). It's one of the most delicious beverages I've ever tasted, perfect for sipping on a rainy afternoon or a winter evening armed with a good book.
Overall anyone who just loves to eat surely must visit 8th Day at least once. One wouldn't be disappointed. However I am deducting .5 from my rating simply because of the slow service and poor management of guests which need to be improved.

I like the pour over coffee, chocolate cookie and the cinamon rolls.
The food here is nothing to brag about, it needs alot of improvement.
You can come here just to enjoy the coffee and cookies and to play the games or read a book.

A picturesque outlet that's cozy and hushed and has very polite staff. Perfect ambience to spend quality time alone or with others having a quick and light meal or just a little treat for the sweet tooth with coffee. 

Light and sweet Iced Coffee was refreshingly perfect and hit just the right amount of sweetness with a rich taste of coffee that wasn't killed by the cream.

The K Town was average I would say. Significantly messy to eat and a specific spice that I can't put my finger upon in the dressing personally put my taste buds off. 

Shortbread cookie was deliciously crumbly and again hit the right balance of sweetness. Most places tend to overly sweeten their baked goods. This cookie did not have such an issue. I ordered a coffee but this would pair delightfully with tea. 

In conclusion I would say this place is definitely worth a visit. And one visit would be enough to draw you back again and again to try out more things on the menu while having a pleasant experience.

I had first been here and had bought just the cookies which are one of the best the city offers. Huge and chewy. Visited the place few days earlier for a proper meal. The hazelnut coffee was good and the cinnamon rolls were pure sin. Soft and freshly made. The quiche can be worked upon a bit though. Overall a amazing place to spend some quality time.

A very calm and quaint place. Tastefully designed and a perfect place to unwind.
We ordered the cold chocolate shake and the bbq chicken wrap.
The shake was lovely and very refreshing. The wrap, however, tasted a bit bland and lacked the punch.
This place really needs to work on it's presentation skills because in today's world before you eat it, the eyes have to be visually glued onto it too. 
The servers should also write down orders to avoid any hassle or confusion.
It's definitely worth a visit!

Fresh food yet inexperienced cooks make them so the taste and texture of food is not consistent and great always.  Service is average. All Day Breakfast is a good option and their Hot Chocolate is heavenly. Cinnamon Roll is also nice.

The place is a little too small for my liking, though the décor is nice considering the limited space. The bagel with aubergine was slightly on the bland side, though it tasted much better than the vegetable itself!( Honestly, I thought it might not be edible, but it was much much better than my expectations!) The cold chocolate was wonderful! Full points to that! The beans were okay. All in all, not a bad place. :)

I tried their Fresh Green Salad with hummus and dip and it was so filling and yummy, I can have it everyday.
Next we ordered the Bagel chip Nachos. It was something unique and we loved it. The bagle bread was crispy and topped with beans and veggies and cheese.
Then the chocolate cupcake, OMG really yummy.
Couldn't try the coffee there, hence got a reason to go back again. 😝😝
A great place to hangout, with amazing ambience.

I tried not to get my hopes up after placing an online order but after having the first bite I realized this was the brownie I was looking for that tasted like home. Amazing! The best brownies in Kolkata! Can't wait to try the other items off the menu

Went to this place with a friend yesterday. It was her suggestion to visit this place and I didn't have an idea what to expect from this place. After reaching the cafe we decided to settle for the bakery products only . So we ordered the cold chocolate, ice cream sandwich and the red velvet cupcake.
First, the Cold chocolate was very delicious and super chocolatey.
Second, the Ice cream sandwich- I've to say this is the best ice cream sandwich I've had till date. The cookies tasted out of the world. 
Third, the Red Velvet cupcake- this doesn't disappoint either. 
So overall, a good experience for me.

Oh we had such fun here! We had ordered:
For drinks-
Cold Coffee (Dark and Simple) which wasn't that nice and with an extra scoop of ice cream, became quite messy.
Lemon Iced Tea which was pretty good
Cold chocolate which was to die for!
For food-
Southwest hummus wrap- Now this is the ideal option from the lunch section for health conscious people. I love hummus so I loved this.
Bbq ranch chicken wrap- This tasted pretty amazing and was quite filling
The Aubergine- We had replaced aubergine with mushrooms and it tasted fabulous. I loved their bagel so much and the cheese used for this dish. Fabulous!
Thek-Town- Now this was by far the best item that we had ordered today. Loved the bagel, the chicken and the lettuce. This dish is what I'll go back for.
For Dessert-
Apple pie- Wasn't that great. I've eaten much better elsewhere.
We were 5 friends who had a gala time here today, eating delectable dishes, playing board games and having a gala time. Thanks 8th day for helping us make new memories.
Ordering the humongous no.of items mentioned above, the bill came to Rs.1626, which is a decent price to pay for the experience.
Attached few of the pictures we cared to click. :)

The décor and ambience is good with dim lighting and the staff is helpful. These are the only good things about the cafe. We ordered a chicken wrap which was tasteless with no spices at all. It only had  vegetables in it that were not even cooked properly. The caramel cupcake and red velvet cupcake were decent but the icing on top of it was too sweet for my taste. One time visit.

Food was terrible. 
The salad was limp, bland and not tasty. We couldn't finish the plate. 
The roast chicken in my grant sandwich was so hard and overcooked i had to take it out of the sandwich and waste it. 
My friend's omlet bagel was also bland and dry. 
We left without trying anything else. 
Nice place for coffee and desserts.

This comparatively newer addition to the ever growing list of cafes in our city has been on my bucket list for quite some time. And I can categorically say that 8th Day Cafe and Bakery has a uniqueness among all that is there...they are indeed here to stay.
LOCATION: Arcadia building, Mullickbazar. Few minutes walk from the AJC Bose road flyover.
DECORUM and AMBIENCE: This is the USP of this cafe. A board displays the "Special items of the day" on the outside itself. The Victorian facade building will instill in oneself the old European vibe even before he/she enters. As soon as you enter,  you would see an assortment of people belonging to multiple races and nationalities. The cafe has a corner with books and boardgames. They also sell bakery items and trinkets from their counter. The walls are decorated with beautiful abstract paintings, a unique clock and colourful wall hangings. The room inside however is marred by placement of sacks of flour/potato at the entrance. Guys...clean the place up and you will take the appeal a notch higher. They badly need to expand too as those 2 small rooms account for a meagre seating arrangement.
FOOD: For coffee-heads like me, the menu will bring in pure joy. Unlike most cafes, they have a wide assortment of coffees and chocolate preparations along with unique desserts.
1. Salted caramel cupcake-
Caramel cake topped with caramel icing and sprinkled with salted caramel. Sweet and saltiness playing on my tongue...it was plainly delicious.
2. Aunt Kay's chocolate chunk cookies-
Crispy outside and gooey centre... overloaded with chocolate...exactly how I wanted it.
3. BBQ ranch chicken wrap-
Chicken roasted in BBQ sauce, topped with creamy garlic dressing and wrapped in a tortilla with tomatoes, onions and lettuce. It was well prepared...but too dry for my taste.
4. The K Town/ The Aubergine-
Now here is a gargantuan mess-up by the management. We ordered the K Town, and instead were served the Aubergine. It took us a few bites into the item, to understand the switch. The K town is a curried chicken salad topped with romaine lettuce served on bagel.
The Aubergine on the other hand is composed of roasted Aubergine (fruit of the tropical old world plant) topped with caramelized onion, melted cheese, pesto and mayonnaise, again served on a bagel. The latter dint impress us at all. It was dry and was simply devoid of any taste. On contacting the management, they apologised and packed up the K town for us free of cost (as they already had charged us for the Aubergine), which was a nice and professional gesture. The K town on the other hand was found to be moist and palatable.
5. Coffee-   
I chose to opt for a "coffee tasting flight" (highly recommended)...ordered the Coffee Trio (a preparation allowing comparative study to 3 basic types of coffee- neat, with steamed milk, filtered/expresso). It took me half an hour to sip through to the bottom of all 3 cups...all 3 were extremely professionally prepared and well served. The neat is raw, the steamed milk makes it tastier. The filtered coffee has the highest concentration of coffee beans and hence has the best aroma of all. We also ordered Cafe Mocha (chocolate ganache mixed with steamed milk and a shot of expresso) which I felt was much better than its counterparts in other cafes.
Couldnot try out another two of their signature preparations for lack of time...the Breakup brownie and the Icecream sandwich...but hoping to go through those in my next visit.
SERVICE: The servers are young and well- mannered. But they lack coordination and the service was a bit slow. Also remember that, they dont serve you water unless you ask for it.
Overall...I was happy that we got such a cafe in Kolkata after such a long time. This is an ideal place to visit on a slow sunny quaint Sunday morning and sit through most of the day with a few books or best friends, sipping coffee and stomaching desserts.
There is need for improvements...but with those taken care of, the cafe can reach to unimaginable heights. Hoping for an even better next visit...

The place is situated near Bangladesh high commission. This place was suggested by my friend,for it's in house bakery. The decor is quite cool. Coming to the food,we ordered auntie Kay's chocolate chunk cookies and oatmeal raisin cookies,along with macchiato and mocha. Macchiato was more of expresso than mix of expresso and milk,a bit strong. Next we ordered the must try dishes that are  bagel chips with hummus,and ice cream sandwich. Another thing I liked was one will not feel bored,one can either read books or try board games. Overall the foods r tasty,ambience is cool, will love to visit the place again.

The most chilled out place for a Sunday afternoon. Painted in white, this place looks cozy in a quaint corner, tucked away from the bustling AJC Bose road. I discover this place with my sister and we freaked out on the HUGE chocolate chunk cookie. They have an assortment of books and games to indulge in in case you are alone or with a group of friends. We had hazelnut machhiato and tied some teas along with quiche and cupcakes. The chocolate chunk cookie is definite recommendation and they also brew Blue Tokai coffee, sell French press and other cool stuff.

Great experience, amazing food, coffee, and environment in general! Different games and books available, hosting occasional open mike nights and even live music, to birthday parties...really a home away from home or a cozy getaway that really gives a sense of being connected to the larger community rather than simply being a great cafe&bakery, and the coffee and food were excellent as well! So whether it's a one time visit or a regular hangout, 8th Day Coffee is a must visit while in Kolkata!

I visited this place a few days back and it was by far the best cafe experience I've had.This place was suggested to me by my girl so we decided to visit this place.The decor is great,it gives a typical western feel and the ambience is also quite cool with good natural lighting but the best part is the food we ordered the BBQ Ranch Chicken wraps which were the best wraps I have had and also the bagel chips with tomato salsa was great,for pastries we ordered the cinammon roll which was quite different from anything that I have had and the chocolate cupcake which was fresh and the cream on top of it was super smooth and tasty,for beverages we took the iced latte and the mocha,the coffees were quite strong but still tasted good and we finished it of with a good old can of coke 😁 The service was good and the pocket pinch was also quite less.

We reached this place with a great hunger and was totally disappointed! Though I loved their interior decoration but Food!
We ordered CINNAMON ROLL which had nice flavour and sweetness.GRANT'S SANDWICH, in this the bagel they used was hard otherwise fresh ingredients, nothing special. With this my CAPPUCCINO did tasted perfect while the other ICED LATTE was like just a normal cold chocolate shake.
This wasn't enough as we were still hungry and we asked them for something heavy to have and a BBQ WRAP was suggested. Didn't liked this dish at all!!! It was a cold wrap with raw spices. We can even taste and feel the grains inside!! And again it was not a filling dish. So from this visit,

If there is one fancy cafe you wish to visit in the city, it should be 8th Day cafe. From the moment you enter the white building, you feel a relaxation of spirit. The interiors are great if you're interested in them as much as me. From the coffee, to hot chocolate, to the desserts and bagels, everything tastes great. However, what steals the show is their ICE CREAM SANDWICH. Must have it if you're here. With taxes, the price is high but worth it. Also, games and books.

Stopped by to pick up bagels and coffee after a morning of cycling. Figured I'd have a very Idealistic Sunday.
I was not disappointed.
The coffee, the two or three types i had, was genuine in flavour and really made my morning. 
Spent a lot of breakfasts there since. 
The curried chicken bagel sandwich remains a favourite. And the coffee I just try different everytime, and it holds up well.
Great staff service too, friendly and helpful for the confused foodie.

Despite being super excited to visit this cafe, I was unfortunately extremely disappointed! To begin on a positive note, the decor and vibe of the Cafe is incredible - very London bistro kind of atmosphere. Loved the large collection of board games available, incredible wall art and cute coffee quotes. 
Now to the food. We ordered one cold latte with added caramel, BBQ chicken wrap and a pesto egg Bagel. The first item only arrived at our table 30 minutes after we ordered it, and none of the food came together. The cold latte had no caramel in it although we specifically asked for the add on. The pesto bagel arrived with a long black strand of hair in the filling of the bagel - like INSIDE the sandwich mixed with the filling. Luckily we hadn't started eating so the management replaced the sandwich. The BBQ chicken wrap was ordered specifically without onions but it arrived PACKED with onions. So we had to ask for that to replaced as well. 
Not a very fulfilling experience on the whole. Loved the ambience but the food and coffee could definitely  be taken up several notches.

Located at mullick baazar. This cafe is a good place to hangout. They have a lot of books and indoor games so it's a perfect place to chillout over cappuccinos. Hazelnut cappuccino was nice and so were the cookies. Friendly staff and beautiful decor. Pretty much liked this cafe.

A good Holi-Day


We went for a snack to 8th Day Cafe and it was a good place to sit down and avoid the disgusting colours all around. 
We ordered a home made lemon iced tea, 3 coffees, hummus and peta wrap and bagel chips with salsa. 
It was surprising that they charged extra for more salsa. But the food was average. 
Another peculiar thing was that there were people working around with their laptops and there was no wifi in the cafe. 
A good place for a snack and very reasonable to. 
If there was an 8th day in the week, I would visit this place.

Catan - my favourite board game. As soon as I entered this absolutely chilled out, quaint little place, I spotted the various games and I was sure I will be a frequent visitor to this place. Cappuccino was just as I wanted extra extra strong and the apple pie was delicious, with subtle flavours and low on sugar. Will definitely visit again.

This cafe is set up beautifully on the ground floor of an old vintage building at the end of the lane. As soon as I stepped in, what first caught my eyes were the cakes and muffins that was showcased right infront and the classic decor. I wanted to be seated by the window but the cafe was pretty packed by then. 8th day cafe has done a wonderful job with the different flavours of coffee. We went for a mint and hazelnut cuppaccino's that was thick and creamy, bagel chips with pesto sauce, westrange omlette which was loaded with melted cheese along with chunks of chicken and a red velvet cupcake. The order was served in no time. This one is a hidden gem and could be a little hard to locate.

This was long time coming. The place is just amazing right from the very second you see it in front of you. And the moment you enter it, it's nothing less than heaven. I'm glad kolkata has such cafes. The place is just too good to be spoken or written about in zomato. The cupcakes and the iced coffee was just too satiating for a person like me. The decor has a nice comfy feel to it. The staff was good.
A must visit for a cafe lover!
Cheers to the whole team for setting it up!

This cafe had caught my attention every single time I would drive past by the old world colonial building it is set in,regal & mysterious.So when I had to meet up an old friend I decided to give this place with a 4.1 rating on ZOmato a try .
Me walked in & what a royal let down! Sacks full of potatoes/ onions strewn on the floor of the cafe tucked away against a wall greeted me in. I decided to pretend like I never saw that & settled down into a table for four & whoa! No leg space straight or sideways,i felt sorry for my 6 feet something tall friend who was about to walk in.He walked in & he complained!
Nevermind I thought it's a 4.1, the food will compensate for it all.
Ordered a potato salad ,2 lattes ,1 cold latte & a ice cream sandwich.
Potato salad was about half a potato sliced and tossed in mayonnaise, another bummer.
The coffees both hot & cold were good.
Ice cream sandwhich, ok-ish.
Overall just another place.If you like what I say find yourself another place.this one's a total bummer.

Guys clean up your place,because your decor is your usp,get comfortable furniture & you'll up your game a long way.All the very best!

Ater my maiden visit to this place today,it has become my favourite adda haunt in the city right now.

The baroque facade of the building,the warm,elegant interiors and the inviting smell of all things coffee and caramel wafting through the air are a hedonist's dream come true.Thankfully,even the food, rather the desserts, match up to the promise.

THE COLD CHOCOLATE (4.75/5) was like an Iced Americano with rich chocolate ganache in place of espresso.This hands down is the best iced drink that I've had in the city,in such a price range.Rich,chocolatey,undiluted flavours in stark contrast with the creamy-frothy-mud water that you get elsewhere.They served it in a tall glass and it had just the right level of sweetness with a near perfect consistency.It wasn't very thick and could be slurped without any effort, something that I struggle with at all other cafés.

The BREAKUP BROWNIE(4/5) again was stellar and could be an instant pick-me-up on bad days.Good quality dark chocolate+rich,fudgy consistency=match made in brownie heaven.It leaves a bitter after-taste in the mouth so if you're a dark chocolate connoisseur, this should be on top of your wishlist.Otherwise, have it with a scoop of icecream.

Again it might sound like an exaggeration but the service is the best in the city.The boys manning the place are genuinely sweet and affable but not in a fake this-is-my-duty kinda way.My friend and I lost track of time while we were chatting up a storm but not once were we bothered.They have books and board games,also a small counter selling trinkets and jewellery.

The whole vibe of the place immensely struck a chord with me.I always prefer places with character that are conducive for great conversation over run-of-the-mill cafés cropping up at every nook and cranny of the city with half-hearted attempts at themed concepts,monotonous food and loud music.This one's a class apart.If you have a knack for good quality coffee, chocolate and conversation, then do yourself a favour and drop in here with a friend or even by yourself with a good book.An extra 1 point just for the vibe.

Sunday morning breakfast option. This place has comfortable seating  - perfect for good coffee alongside great conversations. They also have indoor games -  monopoly etc.  if u feel like spending some time over there. 
The West range omelette is absolutely the best thing to wake up to -  the dish alone would fetch a 4.5 on 5.
However,  the aubergine bagel sandwich was a bit bland and dry as well. 
The staff is professional and courteous.  Oh,  and also -  there is a little jewelery shop right at the entrance, if you ever feel like picking anything up. 
Overall,  it's a nice joint to catch up with someone over coffee,  some food and desserts.

I had serious expectations from this really well packaged place. The ambience was up there but the dry, crumbly salted caramel cupcake with icing that would make your soul cringe, the BBQ chicken wrap which was basically cold chicken curry and lettuce wrapped in a warm roti, the hideous chai latte that tasted like spiced rasgulla syrup really, really let me down. Unless you are desperately craving some french-pressed coffee don't brave this place. If you do, just smile and click your selfies, the food is just b.a.d.

Loved loved loved the decor...even the outside is done up nicely...very close to my sons' school so a great place to hang out...the staff is just great...know when to come and go and do it with a smile...and last but not the least the food is really interesting...we had cinnamon rolls and banana bread with coffee while the boys had hot chocolate and the amazing cupcakes- red velvet and chocolate. What we all enjoyed was the huge portions of everything...must go back for all the savoury items 
Visited again on 16/03/2017 and tried the savoury items...fully satiated with bbq chicken wraps, the wholesome Grants sandwich and omlette with bagels accompanied by cappuccino and iced mocha...we couldn't resist the red velvet cupcake...must mention the large portions again...will be visiting again 😊

Happen to find the place by chance and just wanted to have some coffee before a meeting. I loved the ambience.. the server's went about their business with a smile.. I had asked for a filter coffee which was   brewed well.. the bagels on the side were quite nice..

While the menu looked intersting , did not have the time to order anything else.. next time I am in Kolkata, will surely drop by..

Cheers.

Now this is what a cafe should be. I came to this area a long time back and i came here with a friend of mine to have some healthy breakfast. The outer design is really nice and as you enter, there is a lot of people of different race and culture all under one roof, which is something that you don't see everyday. Though the service is kind of slow, but the food is absolutely delicious. We ordered for hot chocolate and a French press as our drinks. Then we ordered omelette with cheddar cheese and assorted vegetables. The bagels were really nice. We also had a salad with balsamic vinegar. It wasn't that costly, around 1033rs. I would definitely like to come back here again.

It's located just opposite to the Bangladesh High Commission office in a corner and from outside it looks quite good. Inside the atmosphere is quite cosy along with the smell of fresh baked cookies & cakes. The taste of the chocolate muffin is one of the best I've had for quite a while, the brownie was quite good too. You can stay there for hours with your laptop & your hot chocolate. Definitely a place where you would like to visit if you want to spend a lazy afternoon.

A great place to unwind!

Friendly staff, wonderful coffee and do not forget to try the snickers doodle. Thinking of it makes me drool already..it is worse than any pregnancy craving!! Sadly they were closed for tvree days over christmas and a weekend and i had a hard time to survive and on reopening day no snickers doodles due to the holidays before. Tough luck! They have many games and changing exhibitions on their walls. The stuff they sell is from their own bakery. Coffee they roast i believe. You can buy some coffee things, utensils and a choice of earrings aswell.

Staff is superfriendly, their baristas excellent. In case you are in the hood a must try!

On a chilly Friday afternoon,my sister and me decided to visit this elegant cafe in Park Circus.It is located opposite Alliance Day Francaise, Kolkata and i termed it "elegant" because of its beautifully whitewashed Victorian style building located in a cozy corner in between two criss-cross lanes.As we entered the restaurant we were awed by the chic interiors with pretty canvases, statement wall decor and a board-games corner. We sat on a two-seater wooden table reminding me of my school desk and  one of the very friendly staff members handed over the menu cards with a smile.I was interested in trying the bagels and ordered the Non-Veg Bagel Chip Nachos and the very tempting "Breakup Brownie".We were not in a mood for coffee or tea (though the options were galore) and there was a variety of cold-coffee delicacies too.We opted for a Coke Zero soda can instead.As we looked around at the wonderfully done interiors we discussed that the venue was a good hang-out area for friends.Our bagel with cheddar cheese,lean meat strips served with baked beans arrived and we munched our way through the crisp bagel chips.The "Breakup Brownie" was delicious with a very soft and caramel-like interior and a dollop of vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce on top.It should be named "the feel good brownie".
P.S. You'll get a variety of pretty trinkets like bead earrings and necklaces.

A cute little cafe inside a narrow lane opposite to LA Marts. The entrance is very pretty. The bakery section is displayed just when you enter which includes cupcakes, mousses, shakes, cakes and others. There are table to sit inside with WiFi connection and they also provide board games which is of special attraction. We ordered Beagles, Cafe Mocha and Chicken Wraps. There are different board games- we played snakes and ladders. The ambience is really good but the service and price needs to be looked into. The quantity is also not great but the food is delicious. Also, the coffee and the cupcakes are to die for.

This is one of the nicest cafes in Kolkata, and the only reason I don't come here very often is that it's a little too far from where I live. But I love it! It's got a New York theme to it and serves items that are typically identified as American favourites. The seats are a little on the small side, but quite comfy all the same - try to get one with an outside view, it's delightfully sunny during the day. 
I mostly come here for coffee and snacks - they do a great French press coffee that's huge enough to satisfy your worst cravings! And it tastes smooth and rich, which is a welcome relief from the monotony of the machine made coffee you get in most places. The cappuccino is nice too. I have tried their shortbread cookie and found it nice, light and crumbly, a great accompaniment to your coffee. For a heavier bite, try Auntie Kay's chocolate chip cookie - every bit as indulgent as it's supposed to be! The apple pie is another item I like - a little too tart, but that can be remedied by some ice-cream on the side. And when you want something extra decadent, try the ice-cream sandwich, made of two chocolate chip cookies and vanilla ice-cream. You'll want to keep eating it all day. Plus, for when you don't feel like much sugar, they have really nice bagels served with a generous dollop of cream cheese. That has always been one of my favourite light meals - pair it with the French press coffee and you're set to rule the world! 
A must visit for cafe lovers.

Very cool and relaxed ambience. Everything about the place is so nice and amazing - food and coffee was good, service was awesome and the pricing is also right. This place gives you more than one reason for a visit. The only problem is finding a parking space in the small lane. It can really be a pain. However, the pain is all worth the gain and this one is a must visit!

Had heard about this cafe, on visiting, found it to be a nice place well maintained, the food was good, enjoyed the coffee French pressed, however the staff was in a hurry to close shop and the manager virtually thrust the bill and wanted the payment instantly. that was the only jarring note in a otherwise great experience, price was it's slightly expensive.

8th Day is to us what Mclarens Pub was to TED and the gang in HIMYM. It's our spot to meet and catch up on life and have meaningful and pointless discussions. We fell in love with their coffee (it's the best in town) and the cinnamon roll, bagel sandwich, quiche, salad are not so bad either. It's the perfect place to chill with your friends and family while playing board games available at the cafe.

A place which looks good, where you feel good and you get to have great food, desserts rather.

Location may be the only con, otherwise this cozy cafe is too perfect!

We ordered: 

Chocolate Cupcake: Perfectly described in the menu. Rich chocolate cake with a delicious fudge icing. I've never tasted a better chocolate cupcake. Recommended! 5/5.

The BreakUp Brownie: Another "Must Order" dessert. The quality of the chocolate that they use to make the brownie is really really good. You will literally get small bites of chocolate truffle inside the gooey brownie. Loved it! Recommended! 5/5.

BBQ Ranch Chicken Wrap: We actually ordered a Grant's Sandwich but we were informed that it will take time due to unavailability of certain ingredients. Hence we ordered a wrap following their suggestion.  
We got a tortilla wrapped roasted chicken in BBQ sauce, with lettuce, tomatoes and onions, topped with creamy, garlic dressing. Quite filling and tasty. 4.5/5.

Autumn Crescendo Tea: Rich, malty, earthy with caramel and chocolate notes. A great comfort drink. Recommended! 5/5.

Golden Tips Tea: Rich and strong Assam tea with a malty finish.  4/5.

Cinnamon Cookies: Egg less cookies with subtle cinnamon flavor. Bought a gift pack containing 3 cookies. 3.5/5.

Service: Good.

Price: Extremely Reasonable.

Highly Recommended!

Now a million dollar question is why am I rating this place 3.5 when the whole world says upwards of 4??!!
Explain my dear Watson?

For me the joint is about food but it's also about ambience, presentation and common sensibilities of staff....today was again a time to celebrate a friend's birthday, but regular cakes aren't available, so I request them for a cup cake with a candle, the cake arrives without the candle in 15min, then on requesting again a candle comes in a while without the match sticks which again on requesting reaches another few min later....so much for common sense!!!

The food was ok and the ambience and location had an old world feel and charm, if not for the kolkata sun, they had kinda got the "old english inn/tavern" look alright... 

But talking about common sense, at the end you have water being served in coffee mugs, I asked why mugs, one guy says "it's ok"!!! and that its part of practices, I asked then why did u serve water in glasses earlier....guess the guy ran out of answers now & went speechless....

For all the efforts ₹741 isn't that bad...

To the management.... please train ur guys and supervisors.... little bit of finesse required, rest all good

This one was on our wishlist for a long time. A weekend evening we chose to visit the cafe. White washed building walls greeted us. A corner entrance added to the charm of the place. On entering we realized, it was quite full. Seated on the table right next to the entrance. Minimalist decor added to the enthusiasm of the place. Ordered for second flush, autumn crescendo, mocha and chocolate cookies. The cookies were baked to perfection. The menu is quite crisp, prices are on the higher side. Recommended.

8th Day Cafe and Bakery is a small café near Park Circus. The interiors are nice. The staff is well mannered. The food is average. Tried the omelette, bagel with bean salad and the ice-cream sandwich. Didn't really like the thin bagel chips but the bean salad was refreshing and well made. Loved the warm cookies encasing the ice-cream of the ice-cream sandwich. Just a small advice, is go introduce other bread options as well as there was too much of bagels on the menu.

When you have the plan to seat with friends and to opt for useless chitchat, a perfect cup of coffee worked best in that situation! My friends were late so I decided to have a hazelnut cappuccino to kill the time but started reading a book as I found my coffee just perfect so why not utilize the ambiance and time! However, they somehow reached when I completed my coffee and the next 2 hours were dedicated to us only and we had iced latte, mocha, mushroom quiche, cinnamon roll, apple pie and a cupcake to indulge us. It was my first visit there so I relied on my friend's recommendations which obviously worked well.Decently priced, good quality coffee and food and with an American ambiance located opposite Alliance Française at AGC Bose Road 8th, Day Cafe & Bakery is indeed worth visiting.

I was looking for a place to spend some quite time with my little daughter. I was really tired of being in over crowded places. This place is just ideal for spending that quite moment with your loved ones or when you want to rediscover yourself. Sip your coffee, go through the pages of your favourite novel or enjoy being in the company of your favourite people. Not to forget, we both enjoyed playing the board games. The music decibel was just perfect, neither too low nor too high.
Now, coming to food and ambience. 8th day cafe...gives you the rustic look, which is quite different from the regular cafes. Tried cinammon roll and the red velvet cup cake. Cinammon roll was just awesome. Red velvet cup cake was not bad either.
I would rate this place 4 out of 5. Would visit the cafe again.

A great cafe always gives me a positive vibe even when at the entry. 8th Day Cafe & Bakery on that note is high points. From its spacious entry to an apt decor took my attention. We've ordered coffee alongwith Grant's sandwich (a bagel s/w) and BBQ chicken wrap. They were looking great but I'm not overwhelmed with the whole result. The tortilla bread of wrap tasted like a mere Indian Roti, the filling too doesn't had that required punch on taste buds! The Bagel s/w also didn't reach up to my expectations. But the coffees were awesome. The plus points for the cafe is their service, they are so prompt and fast over my order.

A small place with decent ambience. They can remove the sacks etc which are kept right infront of the eyes. The billing counter looks nice with colourful desserts on display, plenty of items from jewellery to t shirts add to the look. 

Coming to the food:
Tea: tried different flavours. Good and flavourful. 
Brownie: good
Chocolate chunk cookies: nothing great  
Omelette: tasty

Staff is not easily visible if one is sitting inside and have to wait for long to grab their attention. 

Overall a good experience  could be better

I've been visiting this Café quite regularly for some time now. Their cappuccino is to die for, I prefer mine with caramel. The K-Town is a must try, just the right amount of creamy from the mayonnaise and the crunch from the lettuce, the chicken is flavourful to say the least. It also happens to be a tribute to the City Of Joy, and rightly so. I've found the BBQ Chicken Wrap to be a little bland for my taste; but I suppose it's a very healthy option. Give the red velvet cupcake a go, if you have a sweet tooth. Oh, and the heavenly cinnamon roll!
The potato salad is creamy and tangy, perfect to snack on. The ambience is inexplicable, you must be there to know it. All in all, they've done a great job with this place.

The beginning was good as in the ambience to start of it and the detailing to tea lovers but when it came to food , very few options for vegie lovers and the coffee even after getting it replaced was pretty sad . A place to chill out with friends and njoy a bagel or two but calcutta deserves a higher standard for sure . Buck it up 8th day . Looks u guys could improve it

The 8th Day cafe is a cosy little spot situated at a convenient distance from the madding crowd. Minimalist decor and soothing ambient lighting makes the interiors look inviting. One of my pet peeves with most eateries in Kolkata is that they never, NEVER get the music right. This place is finally an answer to my grumbles. They play a perfect mix of alternative, country and other genres that blend perfectly into the background. Plus, board games! 
The bagels and pastries are well-made and delicious. Their quiches are especially so. The Philly cheese bagel seemed a little overpriced, though even if one accounts for the high cost of Philadelphia cream cheese. 
All in all, a lovely place to spend a mellow evening.

It's one of those places where you just want to go and be there for hours, either reading a book by yourself or playing games with your friends. I went here today with my friends and we had the iced mocha, hand brewed iced coffee( dark) , hot chocolate and coffee mocha. For food we had the grant sandwich , the vegetarian bagel sandwich and a chocolate chunk cookie. Everything was good and I particularly liked my iced coffee as it had concentrated coffee and the soothing ice. The presentation of the drinks was good. 
Coming to food , I only had the bagel sandwich which was basically a tomato cheese and pesto sandwich, my all time favourite. The bagel was well toasted with a generous smear of pesto, juicy slices of tomatoes and stringy soft mozzarella. I loved every bite of it. 
The ambience, of 8th day cafe is warm and cozy, giving a positive feel to it. The smell of freshly brewed coffee dominates the place and the dim lights really give a comfortable feeling to the place. There are packed goods you can buy such as cookies, bagels, baked goods and also shirts and jewellery. It's a small and pocket friendly place and wonderful for spending an evening on your own or with friends.

Just after i stepped out the server came running after me and gave me a pack of 3 cookies and a coffee voucher for my next visit. I didnt get a table it wasn't there fault but still they made an attempt so that i don't go disappointed. 
P.S. the cookies were yummy :)
Am definitely gng there again.

Coffee is beyond a beverage, it's a therapy that leads to innovation, discovery, solutions, infatuations and a lot more. Being around the city i was thirsty for a good cup of coffee and this is the place that satisfied my soul beyond words. This place lovely cappuccino and if your hungry then it has some real good options for sandwiches. The barbecue chicken wraps were outstanding.  Keep going team, only refrain from showing guests that if they are sitting beyond your cafe timings so they deserve to leave, coz it becomes evident from your expression. Cheers!!

Hearing so much about this place, thought of trying this place out
Ordered just a normal bagel with Nutella which wasn't good, bagels aren't supposed to be that hard it is supposed to be very soft which it wasn't not even near to soft it was very hard.
Ordered all the 3 types of cookies which was pretty nice, loved them all
Ordered red velvet cupcake which again was hard and wasn't that good
Then ordered old fashioned apple pie which was pretty good and lastly ordered a lemon iced tea which was no where near to lemon iced tea it was a classic iced tea they served in the name of lemon iced tea
Pathetic experience, wasn't worth going there.

I have a showroom besides 8th day cafe n never really got to try it . Today i finally decided to give it a shot . I ordered an omelette with everything bagel n butter . Time taken to serve 15 mins. . Worth it . Omelette was made to perfection can't really point a single mistake , coming to the bagel it was slightly under baked but that happens with food sometimes . Other aspects like decor was good . Service was great  . Condiments were also great . I liked their idea of disposing off the left over  bagels at 50%  very clearly certifying that they use fresh bagels.

Few suggestions. 
1. Have some combos .
2. Have free WiFi .
3. Serve regular drinking water in a glass n not a coffee or tea mug.

All the best . Hope to drop by again soon.

Totally love this place. Grunt is such an amazing interactive and courteous person to come across. And what awesome work has done with the cafe. Love the ambiance. And the curator wall. And located on the corner it is such a pleasant place to be at. Love the theme the fact that you can play games and read and relax. There is so much to do and much to be amazed by. 
And the service was so great. Everyone was so casual and friendly and smiling and ready to take care of you.
I am awestruck by the Cinnamon Rolls and it serves one of the best red velvet cupcakes of the city.

A place to be at. Totally. Sunday brunch. To catch with friends. It's a must.

A very cozy cafe located near the Kalamandir PetrolPump. They are the specialist in Bagels. Though i am not a Bagel fan, hence I ordered the Grant's Sandwich - the stuffing of chicken strips, veggies, eggs in a wrap. The taste was good and a latte with ice cream with an instant service.  I like the ambience and specially a corner stuffed with all kinds of games for the guests to play.

I am a regular here and I love this place. The ambience, the food and the people! Out of everything I've had, I'd recommend aunty k's chocolate chunk cookies as a must. Apart from this, bagel chips with hummus and all varieties of teas are great. An upbeat, pleasantly lit place with games to play and books to read.

This place has been in my bookmarked list since it has open and finally  got a chance to visit this place. Since I had already read that this place is little difficult to locate I wisely used my god and managed to reach there . Very casual  European ambiance  and crowd visiting this place also enhances this ambiance. Went there alone and was welcomed well but later there service became slow and nobody came to take my order by once the order was given everything was fast and well before time. Coming to menu , food menu does not have a good options whereas drink has a decent option. I ordered chai latte, aubergrine and apple pie. Chai latte was good but aubergrine was disappointing due to hard bagel and apple pie too was not that great. Good place to visit if having tea or coffee in a little different ambiance

While i've enjoyed the food and ambience at the 8th Day cafe immensely, today I requested for an urgent special cupcake delivery... 

The cupcakes were spectacular ... especially the red velvet ones (must try if you like red velvet)... they also went out of their way to ensure service was top notch. Thank you!

A cozy little cafe, the staff is super friendly and the ambience will make u feel at home. If you wanna catch up with friends over coffee, maybe try your hand at a few Board games, it's ideal. Plus the food is also good. I am not a huge fan of bagels, but I like the ones here. A big thumbs up, we were in dire need of such places in the city!

I instantly fell in love with the interiors :) The staff were friendly and welcoming. We were two of us, and had ordered the meal for two, opting for a potato soup, a hummus wrap and an option from the build-your-breakfast section. The soup indeed reminded me of my nani's recipe <3 The sandwiches were very tasty and what started out to be an evening snack ended up being early dinner that day. Lovely food. Good job you guys :)

I stopped by this place for a quick desert.

I ordered the break up brownie and a chocolate cookie. 

The brownie was chocolaty and fudgy but a tad bit dry and crumbly.
The cookie was delicious but a little too sweet for my liking. But the flavor was spot on. 

The place is simple and comfortable.

There is a wide array for games you could play with friends and family. 

What I loved the most was the smell of coffee.
The whole place smelled of coffee beans and that's the reason why I will be going back here soon.

Today we checked in here to have sum mid day brunch. But they completely disappointed me. Interior decoration was awesome. Staffs were Courteous. But the food quality was a great low. 
At first we ordered Autumn Crescendo in Tea section. Which was quite good. Also they offered a vast selection of Sweetners. 

Then came the disappointment. 
We ordered spring mix with feta and dried cranberry with added chicken. The sauce lacked tartness and taste. Also did not understand what they were trying to do with the lettuces. 
Then came BBQ Ranch chicken wrap. 
The fillings were good. But the wrapper was a bit letdown. It tasted like cheap flour Chapati 
The biggest letdown is cold chcolate. We have ordered cold chocolate. But, they gave something between cold coffee and chocolate lassi. It was a bomb. Too much overpriced. Other cafes provide much better food in lower prices. 3 star is for the interior design and courteous staffs

They have low salt problems. Their sauces don't have the perfect balance of sweetness and tanginess. Their hot beverages are nice but don't try the cold ones. They are too watery. Disappointed. The quality of food doesn't fit up to the price.

If sitting by the window and sipping coffee while you read a nice book or simply seeing the world go by is your idea of relaxing, then the city's newest 8th Day Cafe and Bakery is the right place for you !. Coffee at 8th Day Cafe and Bakery. Started by Grant Walsh about 5 months back, the cafe introduces the charm of an American cafe in Kolkata. Housed in a white heritage building off AJC Bose road, this quiet little cafe is perfect for rainy afternoons when you probably just like to spend some quality time with your loved one.

A very nicely done up, bright cafe located in Park circus. Finally a break from the hookah parlours, that are termed as 'Cafes'.
It is very conveniently located- close to Afraa & Mocha.
The ambience is amazing. The decor is very relaxing and soothing.
I love the Iced latte here. It's not like the thick cold coffee that you get in other cafes. It's light & delicious. 
The desserts are very sinful, my favourite would be the Chocolate chunk cookie & the breakup brownie (tastes a lot like the Theobroma brownies). 
Only drawback: The options are very limited.

8th day cafe has a very cool vive to it - the decor is typical of any cool place - white decor, unusual props (like gunny bags, which might as well have had some functional use) and yes, posters and quotes hung around which style has now become mandatory for all cool type cafes. 

Since we were done with lunch and full to the brim, we settled for some sweet nibbles. The apple pie was sweet but pretty decent (though the crust on top with powdered icing sugar looked unappetising), and I wish it had some tartness to it. We also had a light and creamy cold coffee shake, which was bitter coffee but I quite liked it. If you don't like bitter  desserts or drinks, then do ask for an additional scoop of ice cream.

Overall, my experience was very limited, given we tried only two dishes. But a place like this needs a much more detailed visit and that I must.

The staff is super friendly. And the food is the best you can get! Best part is they have several indoor games which you can enjoy with your family or friends. 8th day has almost become a second home now! :D

Quite a cosy and beautiful eatery for baked foods and varieties of coffee , this place stands out with its well structured entrance and sitting areas. From all that we ordered i would recommend the Cinnamon roll, Bbq chicken wrap,Salted caramel cupcake and ofcourse the Red velvet cupcake. For your favourite cuppa you get many options to choose from. Loved the cappuccino :) So, if you are a fan of cakes, coffee and desserts look no further, this is The place to go to.

The black-board scribblings,array of paintings,soulful songs,indoor games & collection of books stir up sweet emotions while you're savouring sumptuous portions of food items off the menu.
Mushroom quiche, banana bread slice along with a mug of hot mocha goes high up on my list of recommendation.
I'll be heading back soon for the all-day breakfast, in particular,to taste their decorated omelette.Until then,keep your sunny side up!😉

situated near the end of ajc bose fly over in between the small lanes.
we had silver needle tea & green tea. both of them were equally exotic in taste.
we also tried their everything bagels & short bread cookies.
i loved the short bread cookies and i recommend it to every sweet tooth out there! 
it just melted in my mouth.
bagels would be good if u have it with butter or jam or cheese.
ambiance is good. they have beautiful wooden chairs and tables arranged.also the service is impressive.
they make the dishes fresh just after you order it..so it tastes really good.there is a wonderful smell of coffee when u enter the restaurant.
overall it is one of the best cafes in the city!

What a nice cafe! Located at a street corner on a bye- lane in West range, mullick bazar. Wooden tables and chairs, full length glass windows and lovely wall arts have made the ambience pleasing.
Went there on a fine morning and was privileged to get a seat just beside the road side window. With help from well-behaved, helping staffs I chose my own breakfast made of bagels, mozzarella cheese,pesto spread and veggies. It was fresh and delicious. 
Then came the chocolate cup cake. Though the topping was delicious, body of the cake was not so good. Next we ordered oatmeal raisin cookie which had balanced softness and crispness. It was perfect with a glass of oolong tea.
Overall a nice breakfast. Will visit again to try other dishes.
Cheers.

Finally after much awaiting I got to take a day off from the busy schedule and spend some quality time at this happening cafe in the city. The ambience is good. And the sweet music in the background just added to it. The decor is pretty and I loved the shelf showing off a mini collection of books and indoor games. My friend and I ordered HOT CHOCOLATE which I believe is one of the best hot chocolates in this city. The ganache was delicious. Perfect hot chocolate for a perfect rainy day. We also ordered the BREAKUP BROWNIE. It was sprinkled with powdered sugar. It not only looked great but tasted great too. AUNTIE KAY'S CHOCO CHUNK COOKIE was a bit of a let down. It was soft and gooey in the centre and crunchy on the periphery. The soft centre which was chocolaty to the core was the only good thing. However I prefer my cookies perfectly crunchy. So the soft centre of the cookie didn't impress me much. And the young man who served us was very friendly. It's always great to be greeted with a broad smile in the morning. Overall a great place to enjoy quite mornings with good food. A must-visit.

Visited this Café yesterday i.e. on Friendship Day. Themed in white, the outside of the café as well as the inside is beautiful. The decor is really nice. It gives the feel of an English Café. They've got Board Games as well as Novels, so one can easily spend a good time (even if alone) over these, accompanied by a coffee and their oh so delicious cookies.
Coming to food, well we had ordered the following;
Aunty Kay's Chocolate Chunk Cookies
Ice Cream Sandwich
Southwest Hummus Wrap
Bagel Chip with Bean Salsa
The Aubergine
Potato Salad
Pizza
Garden Fresh Salad and a Cup of Soup
along with a number of Beverages.
Food was a mixture of both good and bad. Like for example, the Potato Salad was too good, The Aubergine and Bagel Chips were also pretty decent. But the Southwest Hummus Wrap and the Soup was a total turn off for me. The sweet delicacies were were quite good!!
Good hospitality and pretty friendly staff. It actually suits the definition of a Café though I would suggest to make some additions to their Menu which I felt was a bit too exhaustive. Overall, a positive experience.

Loved the ambiance of this cafe. The service was nice too. Friendly and fast. 

Coming to food, loved the quiche here. Excellent. The dark and simple cold coffee was great. The cold chocolate was good too. 

Another thing we loved was the cinnamon roll. Awesome it was. 

But we didn't like the cupcakes. Tried all three varieties available, and, though the toppings were tasty, the cake body was absolutely tasteless.  The chocolate chunk cookie was a disappointment too. The chocolate chunks were no doubt tasty, but the plain cookie body was tasteless. 

Will be back to try the Sandwiches and more quiche ofcourse.

I was in the mood for something simple yet pleasing and I decided to order from this café. I only ordered a chocolate cookie and their 'break up' brownie. 

The cookie was nice as long as I tasted the chocolate portion. Which I must say was around 70% of the cookie, so no complaint there. However the non chocolate portion seemed eggy and a little unpleasant. It wasn't bad but it just wasn't great either. 

The brownie was a whole lot better. I personally would have liked it a tad less sweet but that really wasn't that big a deal. It was rich and gooey and quite filling as a sweet treat to end lunch. 

I would love to try their other dishes and I do recommend this place for a casual treat. 
Happy Dining!

It was my first time there as I wanted to try something new.The staff was friendly and service good.They have chairs and tables which they keep changing in accordance with the number of people in a group.Seemed weird at first but it was not much of a disturbance.The best item was the mocha.Tge other items were too blank to be precise, not any such flavour or taste.Maybe u can try the salads , they looked nice on the table beside.The cupcake was yummy on the outside but the base was too blank again.The ambience was good.Its a small cozy place for a nice little time.They also have uno for you to play

What a brilliant cafe! I'm sad that I didn't visit this place before today. Located at a corner near Beckbagan, it looks quaint. The staff is very polite and the owner is exceptionally hospitable. We tried the hot chocolate (great), ice cream sandwich (heavenly), cinnamon rolls (a bit too sweet and overwhelming in taste) and butter bagel. The food is priced modestly. On the whole I had a great experience! :)

I visited the diner alone on a mid-week afternoon to take in the aura of the place. I had pre-ordered a Pumpkin Pie that I wanted to take back home with me and surprise my family on Christmas Eve and was consequently as excited to enter the café as I had been the first time (which was incidentally a week earlier). I first ordered a breakfast item of Granola and Cranberries with yoghurt on the side (given in an espresso cup). My granola was served with raisins instead. Still, I decided to not complain and ate my very yummy granola-raisins mix. Satisfied and hungry, I ordered an Ice-cream Sandwich that came with a lot more sweetness and a lot less vanilla. Still, not bad.

This cafe being featured in a number of collections in Zomato urged us to visit there. First of all, I would like to say that the seating or considering the space it did not impress us much. But you are really lucky if you can grab those seats just beside the road during the day. Well, they don't have a very wide menu but they really do good with what they offer. The staffs deserve a special mention. Each of them is very young and full of warmth which they shower on their guests.

Visited the 8th Day Cafe & Bakery today evening. Its situated near the Ajc bose road flyover. The cafe is located at a quiet corner so its perfect if you want some time off from the hustle and bustle of the city.
It is an American style cafe serving Bagels...coffee....salads....carrot cakes....banana cakes....wraps and cupcakes.
Coming to the ambience....its just perfect. The American style gates..lights....walls...coffee counter. The best part is they have a mini library as well as a few board games like uno and scrabbles.
Now coming to the food. At the beginning...we ordered for a cappuccino, a mocha, potato soup and a red velvet cup cake.... They know how to make good coffee as it tasted perfect. The potato soup was also delicious but had too much potatoes compared to the soup. The red velvet caka was amazing with butter n sugar icing. It was a bit sweet but that's alright.
All of them tasted amazing and that raised our expectation.
Now comes the disappointing parts. We ordered for a chicken bagel sandwich....a bbq chicken wrap and a salted caramel cupcake.
All of them were really bad. The bagel bread was not soft and the sandwich was dry. You will not be able to taste any mayonnaise in the sandwich. It was still edible.
About the bbq chicken wrap which was supposed to have bbq sause and ranch tasted completely indian. There were no traces of bbq or ranch but had a very strong flavor of cumin paste. The peta bread used for the wrap was awful. We had to throw it off as it was not edible ( I hate wasting food :( )
The salted caramel cake was just out from the fridge i suppose. It had no softness and the taste was not good.I definitely had better cupcakes.
The menu mostly have vegetarian options and the non veg options are very limited.
I will not be able to comment on the vegetarian food.
The staff members were very cordial and they are pretty quick with the service.
They actually serve water in coffee mugs and i found it pretty interesting :)
If you want to have coffee n want to chill out with friends or read a book...its a good place.
Ordering food here is not a very good idea.
This cafe has a sale counter of coffee beans, coffee machines as well as clothes and jewelry.
If at all I visit this cafe again...I will only go back for coffee and nothing else.

8th Day is a pretty cafe and bakery run by an American couple, located on a quiet corner in a by-lane near Karnani Estate.

On my first visit around 6 months back, I had the Aubergine Sandwich, Red Velvet Cupcake and a cup of Hot Chocolate. The whole-wheat bagel sandwich served in the dish had a slice of roasted aubergine, tomato, mozzarella cheese with a sprinkling of black cumin seeds. Personally, I felt the sandwich lacked any distinctive flavor and the elements used in it failed to complement each other. The red velvet cupcake with the butter-cream frosting tasted quite fine. However, what impressed me was the hot chocolate. A mug of the thick chocolate ganache was first brought to the table which was then infused with steaming hot milk poured from a separate jar. The concoction was thick, rich and creamy without the sweetness overpowering its overall taste.

The weather today was perfect for mulling over a cup of rich hot chocolate and I was reminded instantly about this place. Without ado, we dropped in here and ordered for two cups of the steamy beverage and a BBQ Chicken Wrap to go with it.
To my disappointment, the mugs of hot chocolate were brought to us with the milk already stirred into it and one sip out of my mug revealed how much the quality had deteriorated. The consistency was runnier than before and it lacked the overall creamy texture.

The BBQ chicken wrap was another let down as the bbq flavor was completely overshadowed by the excessive amount of raw onions and what felt like chat masala mixed into the filling. At least, the filling was quite generous.

Even though the prices are competitive and a bit on the higher side, their quantity of food is still better than most places. The service is pretty good as well. Sadly, the beauty of the cafe surpasses the taste and quality of its food.

The 8th Day cafe with its biblical name and white interiors looked pristine.

#Location: Close to Circus Avenue, Park Circus; near deputy high commissioner of Bangladesh's office.

#Service: Though the staff were smiling and friendly they were not well trained or diligent. We had to call them a numerous times for a spoon, or taking the order. One of them was sipping coffee at a corner.

#Ambiance: The name 8Th day Cafe refers to the Biblical Phenomenon of a new beginning, meaning a new order or creation, and man's true 'born again' event when he is resurrected from the dead into eternal life.  Interiors done in immaculate white, with colorful baked goods on the counter, posters & wall art gave the place a vibrant vibe and the name resounded in the interiors.

#Food: I had heard great things about this place but I was frankly very disappointed. While i loved the interiors the food was a let down.
*Dark & Simple Cold Coffee
*Lemon Iced Tea
*Cold Chocolate
The tea too watery. The others lacked flavors and were not creamy enough. One of the drink was not even properly cold.

Wish the team all the best for the future.

Bottom line : Literally at a street corner, it has the authentic American-European cafe feel, with the ambience and the crowd adding to it. Go here for the best desserts in town and good original coffee recipes. Savoury food isn't their strong point exactly.

I got to visit this place on a lovely rainy evening with a lovely set of friends. The place has minimalistic decore which compliments it's concept by the highlights reserved with their star product- Coffee! The coffee grinding machines are right there for you to see. Not only that, they have several sacks of coffee casually spread on the floor, probably for you to know where your beans are coming from. They have very many intricate art works depicting local charm. This carries forward to even their servers' uniforms. This could one reason why so many artists are attracted to this place as you would find many lone visitors, either lost in their books or artwork in progress. The ratio is highest here as compared to other cafes in town. This could also be owing to its American ownership who I had the good fortune of coming across at several occasions . They even stock a decently big collection of games both for kids and adults. However, only one thing which I would request the owner to fix is the dripping water from the air con ducts at various points.
Coming to what we value the most at any given hang out : Food! I would go as far as saying that this place makes the best cinnamon rolls and apple pie in the country, at least as far as my experience goes. The apple pie is right called the "old-fashioned" what with its pie shaped serving. It is the right amount of sweetness and temperature for you to indulge your sweet tooth in!  Jumping to the cinnamon roll, it isn't your regular looking, flattish roll, rather a taller version of the same, with custard sauce flowing in its veins. Hence, when you dig into it, it makes for a great combo and does not feels too dry as rolls can be at times! Next up, drinks! They pride themselves in their pour over coffee and serve it in a stunning manner, however our lot tried hot chocolate, lattes and cappuccinos and they were all yum! Not to thick, not too thin. Not too milky and not too strong for regular coffee drinkers. Please do stock back the caramel flavour as our city primarily has a sweeter Pallette. Somehow the chickens rolls and bagels weren't a big favourite and this has been a common feedback. I did like the spring greens with feta and cranberries.
The severs seemed to be trained personally by the owners, not the ones who have been high jacked from other eateries. I can tell by their casual professionalism and warmth which was much appreciated. 
Looking forward to more such beautiful evenings :)

Though difficult to locate because of the meandering lanes in Park Circus the cafe is worth a visit.Even on asking the cafe staff you won't get any clarity of the location. It's only GPS that would save you from the misery.The front desk says "Put Love First" on welcoming the guests.Quaint décor inside,vintage stacking tables,aroma of freshly brewed coffee is what you get as you step inside.The staff is polite,helpful but not much informative.We expected them to be a little more well-groomed.
Our orders: The K-Town,Bagel Chip Nachos,Ice cream sandwich,Mocha,Cold Coffee and Signature Cinnamon Rolls.The sandwich was packed with chicken cooked in Kolkata style(as the name suggests but the taste is widely different) and filled up in between the bagels.I'm not too much fond of bagels but the filling was really sumptuous.The Bagel Chip Nachos was actually a big helping for two. Beans with a bit of onions, tomatoes tossed in salsa coupled with roasted bagels(chips) was toothsome. And the presentation grabs a perfect 10/10!!The coffees were as usual,nothing extraordinary.Two big chocolate cookies with vanilla ice cream filling and hot chocolate sauce makes the ice cream sandwich too much on the sweet side.But unfortunately the dish was stinking of egg.Though I was pretty excited to try this I couldn't eat it for long due to the smell eggs.We were so overwhelmed with food that decided to parcel the Signature Cinnamon Roll.The Cinnamon Rolls were not able to live upto my expectation.Having heard so much about these I was totally pumped up to try this white beauty.But it was sheer disappointment!The combination of cinnamon inside and white sugar coating outside did not do wonder to my taste buds.But my husband was moderate on his views.So I would say, try the Cinnamon Rolls to check if you are open for it!In a nutshell the milieu was warm,food options were sufficient,quality and standards won't let you complaint at all.

This is a petite, quaint and cozy café to which I would return over and over again. It doesn't cost you a lot to eat here. It provides for the perfect resort to spend time with your friends, have a conversation and just catch up with your loved ones over a cup of tea or coffee. I recommend their Salted Caramel Cupcake and The Break-up Brownie. Sometimes their service is a little slow, but that shouldn't bother you as you get to spend more time playing the board games provided.

The cafe name seemed quite interesting so as I entered, I popped the question. The reply? 8th day is the day of happiness. The place is done up in white and dark wood with some lovely wall art that instantly makes you cheerful. The aromatic coffee (cappuccino) served here is great and so are their teas. The Oolong and Assam we tried were excellent. You can even buy a pack for home(pix attached). Their signature items - old fashioned apple pie and cinnamon rolls are a must try- instant mood lifters. In case you want to keep it light try their oatmeal cookies, freshly baked and great with your sugarless tea.

They open early at 9am and you can choose to have an American breakfast with sandwiches or bagels with your choice of eggs. A happy start to the day ahead!

Went over here based on a review I read in The Mint. It was a date and I must say it's a great place for a date. In the heart of the city nestled into a quiet neighbourhood. We ordered a Grant's sandwich, a chocolate brownie, iced latte and a caramel latte (or something like that I can't fully recall). Anyways, the food was great. Very well made. We put off eating the brownie for a long time because we were so engrossed in conversation that when we actually did eat it, it'd become slightly hard. But the center was still soft and it was sweet and amazing as a brownie should be. The sweet British (sorry if I got the nationality wrong) chef passed by our table and complimented my girlfriend's bag too. Overall, a must visit.

Tiny little cafe located at AJC Bose Road, this place looks damn pretty from the outside with a grand beautifully done door in the center of a white building. Once you enter you see a neatly done seating area with wooden tables and chairs and full length glass windows to daydream and look out while sipping a hot cup of coffee. My first visit to this place was on a Sunday evening and it was quite crowded which made the place look cramped up. We had ordered mocha, cinnamon rolls, bagels, ice cream sandwich, red velvet cupcakes. I feel the food was good but could have been better barring the cinnamon rolls which were fantastic. Also, it could have been priced in a way that it would've been more economically viable. Service was prompt and the staff was extremely well behaved, polite. There was a wall with books and boardgames on it which was a new concept for this city, so thumbs up for that. :)

8th day had been on my list since long, yesterday i visited this place with a friend, easy to locate , with a handsome facade and those white tall pillars add to the exuberance of the place. We ordered the hot chocolate which was served pipping hot, and trust me was one of the best i 've ever had. Must try for everyone. Next was the apple pie with a scoop of vanilla icecream which was decadent as well. The pastry well cooked and the filling melted in the mouth, perfectly sweet enough. The mushroom quiche was well baked and had a lovely earthy flavour to it. We also had bagel with hummus which was flavourfull too. Although the bagels got a bit chewy after sometime. Coming to the ambience, this small bakery is one of the best in town, the seating, lights, interiors are pleasant and perfect for a dayout or in the evenings. The menu is fairly priced which was the highlight. We had two hot chocolates, one apple pie with icecream, bagel with hummus , mushroom quiche which amounted to 600/- . Definitely going to visit again.

I would just tell you to try the Bagel and the Red Velvet Cupcake. Totally worth it. You might not just be okay with one. The ambience and the service is very well too.

The decor is all white and luxe. Its a cosy little cafe with great ambience and great people around which has impressed me so much. Be it the polite nature of the staffs or the food, nothing fails to impress. The service is excellent. The food is great. I think this place in Kolkata serves the best coffee i have tasted so far. The desserts too are amazing! The salted caramel cupcake is the one to watch out for.. also, the icecream sandwich! Even the cookies are the best! 
So the 8th day cafe is probably the only cafe in the city which has impressed me so much after Mrs. Magpie. :)

Small cute place. Baked stuffs are good. Nice varieties of exotic teas they have. Nice place to hangout, board games, cards, uno, books they have it all. Also if u like those grey tees that servers are wearing, u can buy at 500 bucks. Do try ice cream sandwich, which is in-house icecream smashed in between two freshly baked cookies, with oh so big chunks of chocolates in them. Do not order of u r to eat that alone. Its too sweet n filling for one. Also eat as soon as it arrives, because ice cream goes all runny in 5 minutes

As I am bed ridden, I decided to get fool delivered so ordered through zomato. Called for their hummus south west wrap or whatever the exact name is and desserts.. Was eagerly awaiting the food but all my excitement went down the drain as soon as I tasted the food. The dessert was pretty ok. Didn't taste that fresh but the wrap? Do not even ask! They served me a horrible experience. Twas so soggy that as soon as I unwrapped it it started to fall and when tasted with the fork, it tasted horrible. It wasn't fresh for sure. The cream in it was stale and giving a foul smell. Immediately I had complained it to zomato. Today I was asked by zomato to point it out here so I have.. Also I had called up the cafe to speak to the owner to bring it to his notice but they couldn't speak well and I was not connected to the owner. Horrendous experience.

Looking around for a cafe that can give you a feel of the American streets and serene ambiance giving you the opportunity to spend hours sipping coffee and working away at the laptop? Then this is your place!
Location: Turn right from Shakespeare Sarani at the crossing after Kala Mandir, and walk along the footpath of Jagadish Chandra Bose Road. Take the second left turn, and you cross Afraa Deli. A few more steps and you have reached the white building.

Ambiance: The cafe is small, but the ambiance is lovely. They have two separate regions, one allowing you a place by the window, and the other in the dark, allowing you to carry on your work without much disturbance. I had opted for the latter.

Food: Well, I had primarily visited the place to complete an assignment. Besides, I had a heavy breakfast at Flurys a few hours before and my stomach was too full for go for anything but a Mocha. On second thoughts, I ordered the Cinnamon Roll that is so talked about.
1. Mocha: It was beautifully presented and had the goodness of chocolate and coffee with the heavy aroma filling up your senses.
2. Cinnamon Rolls: Boy! Was it big! I couldn't even finish half. However, I felt it to be too sweet with the sugar coating on top. It didn't live up to the hype it had created.

The staffs are very polite, and the three young ladies are scurrying about, trying to look into the needs of the guests. They were also generous enough not to throw me out in spite of spending nearly 2 hours over just these things!

Overall, a good experience. Hope to return soon for trying out the other things.

White washed walls and beautiful art is what I loved the most when I entered this cafe. Being a total iced tea freak, I loved the iced tea they served! Its so refreshing and not the usual powdered ones that is served in most of the cafes. Also the staff is very friendly and welcoming. The only drawback is that you cant find a lot of options in the menu. Its very limited and mostly meant for ppl who are looking for something light and healthy. So if you belong to this category, you can just sit here all day and read and play games and talk and have fun or just sit by yourself and have a good time.

Perhaps the BEST thing to hit the coffee loving city is the advent of 8th Day Cafe and Bakery. In all honesty, I have NEVER come across a place that lures you with just the aroma of their grinded coffee beans; so you can definitely brace yourselves for what will be hitting your tongue once you order your flavour of sin.

 Established by Grant Walsh, an American who was so mesmerised by Kolkata’s culture, that he decided to stay on- 8th Day brings forth an amazing selection of Black and milk based coffees. Though everything on the menu are the best choices, I go there personally for the Pour Over, French Press and the Caramel Latte (cold).

Coming to their food, do not and I repeat DO NOT miss their signature Cinnamon Rolls, Lemon Tart, Short Bread cookies and BBQ Ranch Chicken Wraps.

 Look forward to the Christmas time for the best and only place to have the authentic Holiday Pumpkin Pies you could sink your teeth into.

This clubbed with a chilled out ambience filled with books, games and conversations makes it the PERFECT place to chill with friends, family and intellectuals alike.

The first thing I loved about the place was the interior, totally had an out of Kolkata touch to it. Those wall paintings, those black wooden simple tables and chairs and the warm lighting have made it a very beautiful place indeed. 
.
Though the location is very tough to locate at least we had a tough time finding it. 
.
Next thing that I will really appreciate is the fast service, really loved that.
.
.
Next the FOOD! 
We ordered the K town sandwich, iced tea and cinnamon rolls.
.
The K town- it was something I have never tried, simplest yet very tasty. It had curry chicken, lettuce and resins. That's all, but tasted heavenly. And the funny part is its made with begels, yes you read it right. 
.
The iced tea- very good, really, 
The cinnamon rolls- it's huge, please if you are alone don't try it. I think it had too much cinnamon fr my taste buds I couldn't try it more than a single bite, but my friend loved it. 
So that could be just me.
.
So the verdict is a big thumbs up! Definitely heading again.

New York style bagels, American scones and sinful cinnamon rolls. If you’ve been craving for these staple American dishes in Kolkata, there is now a place where you can go to indulge – the newest American cafe in town, 8th Day Café and Bakery at AJC Bose Road. It is the brainchild of Grant Walsh, an American who first visited Kolkata nearly five years back, fell in love with the city, left his job in his country and came back to open 8th Day to give the city a true American cafe experience. And why the name 8th Day? Because Grant believes that there are seven days in a week and the 8th day is the day when good things happen!

Since the day I had read 8th Day Cafe serves Bluetokai coffe it has been on my list. 
The moment we entered the cafe we were greeted by the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Our server greeted us warmly with a big smile on his face and offered us a table. We ordered a cafe latte, a pour over coffee, one Grants's sandwich and a salted caramel cupcake.
The bagel sandwich took a bit of time but it was worth the wait. I loved the layers of textures and flavours. Moreover, the bagel was soft and fresh. The salted caramel cupcake too was delectable. I loved my pour over coffee as well.
The service was efficient and warm. I didn't mind the prices either. Definitely worth going back.

8th Day Cafe is one of my most favourite cafe in Kolkata. Their coffee is just out of the world. I had Mocha which is always my go to order and it was simply awesome. But I must specially mention another coffee I had, which is their Macchiato..it is undoubtedly the best one I have had in a long time with the correct portions of espresso and milk making it a heavenly concoction! I would like to visit this place again and again whenever I feel like satisfying my caffeine desire :-)

All your parking woes will be erased once you sit yourself down at 8th day cafe. I had an all round fantastic meal here a week back. It is the quintessential quaint cafe; baked goodies at the front counter, a cosy space, small tables and a personable, efficient staff. Primarily though, the food was A+. 

We were famished and gorged on the red velvet cupcake which was very close to perfection. I've had ones with a chocolate center which I've enjoyed but felt don't stay true to concept, so this was a delight. We also asked for bagel chips with hummus, the aubergine, the chicken wrap, a couple of iced teas and a cinnamon roll. A little later, on a whim, I added the soup of the day to our already bloated order. 

At the end of that delicious bowl of creamy, heartwarming potato soup, I had no regrets (Pro tip: stick to the cup, ample quantity). Suffice to say, that went for the rest of the meal i.e. heartwarming good food served in deceptively small portions. The aubergine which is a very unique take on the burger, felt like a classic to me. Except for the lemon iced tea which was too lemony, everything was pitch perfect. 

In the background were the proprietors passionately discussing cafe strategy while consulting the staff intermittently. Such a wonderful thing to watch.  

I was blown away by this place. Can't rave enough. Cannot wait to go back despite the limited menu. Those tarts in the Zomato pictures look bloody tempting.

Ask anyone and they’ll agree that Calcutta has a reputation for being a comfy cushion, that you could just sink into and stay. The laid-back pace and evening adda being its trademark features, when a mélange of cafes started sprouting all over the city, most of us expected the Cal vibe to filter into them. I sampled quite a few of them for a quiet afternoon of work or to catch up with friends and It was a real bummer to realize that it’s still difficult to find a place where you could spend a few hours without getting disapproving stares. Once my cup of coffee was over, “shall I bring you the cheque?” would follow quite quickly, even though most of them were half empty. Of the very few places that did manage to capture the essence of the city and channel it into their space, my go-to spot is (surprise!) actually an American-style Cafe and Bakery called 8th Day. This place will not make you want to leave quickly.

Biblically, The 8th day gives the world the hope it badly needs casting away all the sadness & mourning.. And this Cafe aptly does justice to its name.

Liked the warmth & welcoming aura of this place. For ones having a sweet tooth the Signature Cinnamon rolls are a good option. Also the Hazelnut Latte was warm & soothing.

Didn't like the bagel chip nachos though, the chips were really hard & the bean salsa absolutely cold. The only savior in the dish was the cheddar cheese to top it.

The staff was really well mannered & generous though! So good place & good company turned out to be a good evening all together :)

My sister recommended 8th Day to me about a week ago and yesterday I finally went to the cafe. I ordered Bagel Chip Nachos w/ Bean Salsa for lunch and an Iced Mocha. The ambiance was simply wonderful. It is a peaceful place to read a book. 8th day has a shelf full of board and card games and books you can pick up and play with your friends, which I think is pretty cool. The staff is good too. Definitely going back today.

Tucked away on a corner in the same lane as conclave, the 8th day cake and bakery was on my wish list for long. I fulfilled my wish last week when I, accompanied by my friends went there for coffee and desserts. 
The interiors are neat and I found the place to be cosy! 
Not to forget that this place looks like an American cafe from the exteriors as well

My friends ordered for cold coffees while I went for their hazelnut cuppachino ( my go to order always!)
The hazelnut flavor was missing in my coffee and I couldn't help but feel disappointed. 
Chicken burritos and make ur own sandwiches wre ordered.
I went for their multi grain bagel, pesto, veggies and egg. The sandwich was decent, but I was missing some side, maybe homemade fries?
The only standout were the desserts. 
We ordered for their famous salted caramel cupcake and trust me, you must must must visit this place only for this! #recommended 
The chocolate cupcake was tasty as well. 
Since we werent happy with our food, the server noticing that got us a complimentary cinnamon roll which was delicious! ( a very good gesture )

Overall a very average experience and honestly I'll come back here for those salted caramel cupcakes only! 

The service was good.

A lovely little cafe situated in a bylane close to Conclave club in Park Circus Kolkata. I generally have not been able to give cafes in Kolkata anything above a 3.5 but this one really made an impression. A neat place with a cozy feel to it. Somewhere you would probably spend a couple of hours chatting with your friends or catching up on some board games while sipping a hot chocolate. 

The bagel was good although the cream cheese needs to be better in quantity. The bbq chicken wrap was also good but the bagel chips were a dissapointment. Maybe they are meant to be that hard on the teeth but it was something we did not enjoy. Yet the feel of the place will make you go back to it. Prices are reasonable but menu options are limited. They could do with a few more items on their menu. Yet, a place you would love to go and hang out at !!

IDK (I don't know, I'll be using that) if it was the weather or an evince resemblance to something I was searching for, this Café, I meant the time I spent there after stepping in through the door, was like a 'phase'.
Rain drops, cloudy sky, calm environment of 3pm. And some imaginations.
Warm and homely ambience. Cheerful and courteous staff.
Only thing the scenery lacked, was tall trees on both sides of the lane leading to this classy English Café, rhomboid lamps, and a cherry blossom tree. I'm an avid anime watcher, and it was like one of my favorite cafés, from Tokyo Ghoul.
Never mind the buffoonery.
We had tea, 'Moonshine' and 'Silver needle.' Being not much of a tea-taster, couldn't make hell of difference. Both were pleasing to taste buds.
Then was 'The Aubergine'(eggplant) sandwich which was meh kinda, while 'The K-Town' was a chicken burger quietly healthy and filling.
'Spring Mix with Feta and Cranberries', with chicken add-ons. They were succulent.
'Quiche' was absolutely delightful. This French, open faced pastry crust incorporating a layer of egg and assorted with cheese, spinach, mushroom fillings is a
party setter for sure.
There is something tantalizing about fresh baked bread, and that's exactly what 'Signature Cinnamon Rolls' has to offer to you. With sugar syrup spread on top, it mimics a volcano erupted and approaching yer oral cavity.
Not to forget about a sweet epilogue to the story I've had; A 'soon-to-wed' American couple was congratulated and celebrated with a cake and cards by the staff. That was such a happy vibe all over.

I'm so glad I found this place. I might sound a bit hyped, but can't help when things really strike a chord! :)

8th day is lovely cafe that serves good coffee with a lovely ambiance restricted by limited options to eat.

Located in lane that hosts club conclave, cafe has small sections with high celings that feel spacious. Aroma of freshly ground coffee is what greets you as soon as you enter. Decor is subtle and elegant. Staff are very warm and courteous.

Coffee here is nice and well made with a lot of options to choose from. Bagels are served warm and taste good. I liked the wrap here but would love it further if am given an option of a filling inside like a patty or falafel. Potato soup was superb. Have heard a lot about chocolate chip cookie here but yet to try it. But I felt that my options to eat were extremely limited.

Overall it's a great cafe but I could skip the same if too hungry.

while I haven't had the oppurtunity to visit its interiors,zomato order brought up the occassion to order online.In the peevish frenzy of an afternoon wthout supplies,i went on to order a quiche,a burrito and a wrap.The  bbq ranch chicken wrap and the quiche would later save the day akin to the  law of averages-something that I find to be immutable in life.the breakfast burrito delivered a punch,not to appease any taste bud,but as an assault to knock out a few senses along with their respective organs,with its peas and pods all scrambled unsafely within a big pallid tortilla roll.other than the uncertain looking egg,nothing says florid in the burrito and proportion of succulent non veg remains agonizingly disappointing.The quiche smoothens the experience with its fine mix of cheese and egg,hidden beneath a cumbersome crust.The wrap has a rich vein of bbq sauce and the poultry(chicken) is dished out with a well versed generosity,and therefore,it placates with welcome alacrity.I have seen their pictures in zomato,and the imposing white edifice  doesn't fail to impress.To then equate a botched burrito as representative of the entire lexicon of a marvelous looking joint seemed like an insult to the intellect and mostly,sentiment of the owners,and i feel quite skeptical in rating the place below an easily deserved 3.5.Yes,I am partial to the cute and suffer from pangs of ethical dilemma when the pretty turns to incursion,so I am opting to reserve judgement until I visit this place.

The restaurant is not particularly one of its kind, but one with a beautiful concept, although slightly over priced, the food there is all freshly baked and typical of an american bakery. The feel of the restaurant is very american. The apple pie there is a must try. Will surely visit again.

8th Day Cafe & Bakery was on my wish list for quite a long time, and I finally managed to visit this cafe with a friend of mine last Sunday. The interiors have been kept simple yet sophisticated, which really complements the entire ambience of the place. The air was filled with the strong aroma of freshly brewed coffee, and the pleasant chatter all around set the tone of the cafe really well. 

Our order was simple - a Salted Caramel Cupcake, a Chocolate Cookie, and two Cappuccinos. The Salted Caramel Cupcake was the only thing we didn't like as it was too sweet, and we couldn't find the salty taste of caramel. I was expecting it to be kind of similar in taste to the Nutty Praline of Mrs. Magpie, having that strong salty taste, but it wasnt so. It was overly sweet. But other than that, there were no negatives. The Chocolate Cookie was very tasty, and as soon as we broke it to pieces, molten chocolate oozed out of it. The Cappuccinos were excellent - the best I have had in Kolkata.

Now coming to the best part of the evening - the service. The owners Verienna (not sure of the spelling) and Matthew were very warm and friendly, and we noticed them treating the people at every table very politely. They chatted with us for a long time.. Verienna attended to us individually, and Matthew told us about his three children, and that his 5 year old daughter wants to work in her daddy's cafe.. :) The other waitors were very friendly as well. The guy who was serving us himself offered to click our pictutes.. The entire team's hospitality made us feel very much at home, and this is one of the reasons why we would like to visit this cafe again. It felt really good to see that they value interaction with their customers so very much.

Good job guys.. keep up the good work :)

Heard a mixed review about this place before actually visiting . But still i wanted to try and explore .

 First thing first The Decor its really amazing like an eurpean cafe. It can beat any branded cafe in terms of decor -5/5

The service was amazing i got my food on table within few minutes , since i did not like their sandwhich so i left that only eating half so the service guy immidiatly offered a different snack free of cost. This showed how well they care for their customers. Although i declined to accept his offer before leaving the place they packed two cookies for us without even asking for it.

Such a level of customer care can only be seen in 5 stars.

The food: well this the only aspect where they lack. I ordered for one latte , one chocolate cupcake and the aubergine . The sandwich was not good at all. the bread was very hard to eat. The fillings inside the sandwich was of no taste. infact i left the half of the of the sandwich. I feel the value of the food is defined when i want to eat that food again. But i seriously never want to try that sandwich again . Please change your few food menu or improve the taste .this will make it a great place then. But now  I did not find it worth of my money. Probably will not visit .
Thank you

I was immensely impressed after my first visit at 8th day cafe and bakery. Small cafe with minimalist decor and a limited menu which serves just right as I don't like getting spoilt for choice. The coffee was really good and the old fashioned apple pie melted in my mouth. From the black wooden sitting arrangement to the colour of the walls, everything inside the cafe is soothing to your eyes and your mood. The owner has done a pretty good job and I am looking forward to my future visits. At the same time, one must also acknowledge the service they provide.

Walking into 8th Day feels great. There is always a warm welcome and the promise of good coffee! 8th day is one of the few places in the city besides my own home where I happily eat salad as hygiene standards are very high. I am so happy to have this place in walking distance.

It's also a cafe which somehow facilitates meaningful conversations with friends. It's a great find!!!!

Nice little place to hang out and sip on a cup of coffee. Ordered hot chocolate which was really yum! The red velvet cupcake was also nice. Had heard a lot about their aubergine bagel so i had decided to try one.  Although it had quite an interesting mix of flavors and textures, it isn't quite something I'd opt for again.

It's a great place to sip a cup of coffee and chill with friends.
The way in which the coffee was served to us was really different.. The milk in the coffee was added in front of us and designed according to our demands.. 
The games in the cafe kept us hooked for a long time..
The cappuccino and omelette were excellent but the salad and the breakup brownies were a bit of a disappointment.  However on complaining we were immediately offered an exchange of the dish.

It was a great overall experience with really good service.. Its a cool cafe with a very warm ambience ! I would definitely visit the cafe again !

Thou it is a small cafe but trust me one feels transported to retro American cafes😉 having a game corner for its customers it gives u a different level of comfort thus providing u a feeling of being at home✌️Regarding the food it was jus lyk any other cafe in the city👍 the purpose of giving extra point in my rating is for the uniqueness & the owner who interacts wid his customers in a vry friendly way®

Read about this place in t2 and decided to check it out. It's situated in a lane in the Beckbagan area diagonally opposite Alliance Francaise in West Range. It's a cozy little place with a great ambience. They have various objects to keep you engaged...board games,books,newspapers or you can while away your time gazing at the passers by out of the big glass windows as you sip your tea or coffee. It has a friendly vibe,with the owner  enquiring about the food. It's run by an American,Grant Walsh. The staff too were very helpful and courteous.The food was very good. We ordered the Garden Fresh salad served with pesto garlic mayo and the veggies were fresh and crunchy. Moreover the quantity too was ok.This was the first time I had aubergine sandwich,was slightly hesitant at first but surprisingly liked it a lot. It had caramelized onions and cheese and served in a bagel. Tasty.Rhe drinks too were good...iced mocha was good as was the lemon iced tea. Their red velvet cup cake and the salted caramel cup cake too were soft,moist and well yum. Overall a good experience at this place. Definitely recommended....should visit.

Limited menu but what is on the menu is great food. Tried the cinnamon roll, apple pie and their signature teas. The cinnamon roll was nice and gooey (just the way I like it) and the apple pie was soft from inside and crumbly outside. The pastry was nice and crisp and not too dense. Had the earl grey (Brewer longer than required) and Silver needle (yummmmmmm). The decor is informal and cozy. You can relax inside for long and the staff won't trouble you... Sit by the window and let the afternoon sun and good food work their magic..

Since I am an avid Zomato user, going by the reviews I went for Breakup Brownie, and it wad the best brownie I have ever tasted, it is loaded with chocolate, chocolate melts inside your mouth! The chocolate cupcake is nice too, however the menu is extremely limited, they only have a few items, overall I am satisfied!

It's the perfect place to hang out with friends, sit with a book or work on a laptop. I had the good fortune to observe varied activities the customers were involved in starting from finishing homework to playing scrabble!
The ice cream sandwich was totally divine! They serve a lot of tea in the pot! The cupcakes are fresh and delicious. The wraps are healthy and well made. It's definitely worth recommending as a cafe!

It was an amazing idea to visit 8th day cafe and bakery im Decmber.
You get the exact christmassy feel that you want.
A very cute cafe established by an American
Amazing decor with old school dark wood furitures , high seats and waitress to serve you. 
When we went there was this cookie decorating event organized by them for kids. It was such a cute event
The place is ptoperly decked up for christmas.
Tourists from abroad flock in this joint most. So when you are sitting there, this place feels like someplace abroad.. 
The waiteress are properly trained and very cordial
Coming to the food.
Their SALTED CARAMEL CUPCAKE is the best i have ever had. THE BEST.
The apple pie was good. The mocha , very creamy and tasty . The hot chocolate was nothing unusual.
They even sell there merchandise (cups, bags , tshirts) and junk jewellery
Would loove to come back here for the cupcake and the warm, cozy feel.

Its the place where you will like to go, if you want a nice comfortable place which plays slow music, and without the loud crowd.  
A pro tip: check for the day's offers. Because, i got 2 cupcakes at the price of one the day i visited this place. *_*

I fail to understand how 8th Day gets any bad ratings. I have been here a dozen times or so, and it impresses every time. The newly introduced Truffles are extraordinary! Yes, the food menu is pretty limited, but the Cranberry Salad, Sun-dried Tomato Quiche and the weathered wooden tables more than make up for it. The hot chocolate here is probably the best in town. 
I have two requests though: 
1. Please stay open a little longer. Especially in the weekends. 
2. For whatever reason, don't ever shut down!

Very nice n quite place to spend quality time. I had a chat with a owner, he was really very friendly. He came up to us asking if we need anything couple of times. He even served me water once, which is quite rare. I had a long chat with him about his cafe and all. Coming to food, we ordered ice cream sandwich and bbq chicken wrap. Both were amazing. I just loved the BBQ chicken. Very friendly atmosphere. Looking forward to going back and try something new.

I went Zomato hunting again as I decided to hang out with my closest friend. We clearly needed a place that would serve good food and leave us alone for a few good hours! After careful delegation I decided upon this one, cause it seemed very very interesting.

Situated in a cross-roads near Shakespeare Sarani, the entrance is down-right beautiful! The cafe has old-school wooden furniture which goes with the feel of the cafe. The interior is simple in black and white,but the "LOVE" sign makes a special impression.

We started off with a cup of Hot Chocolate and a French Press. The hot chocolate was a tad bit sweeter for my taste, but the Latte Art was beautiful. It was rich and filling. The French Press was indeed full bodied,a strong creamy coffee to chat along with. ( it didn't have cream! duh! it's an expression, cause it was really smooth). We then ordered the BBQ Ranch Chicken Wrap, which was filled with chicken ( thankfully)! The sweet and tangy BBQ sauce was abundant. This refreshing wrap is a great addition to the menu. We ended it with the Signature Cinnamon Rolls and Old Fashioned Apple Pie. The apple pie was dry, tangy and not at all smooth, I say they should work on that. The Cinnamon Roll however had an opulent cinnamon flavour and beautifully made pastry. It was an absolute delight to taste it.

We were there for three hours. Yes,you read it correctly,three long hours and not once did I found them irritating. They kept on serving with a smile. :) The bakery manager told me all about the live performances and invited me over on a Tuesday.

The ambience is great, the staff is friendly and polite. Moreover it's perfect for people who enjoy hour long chats. The cinnamon rolls are a must try for every customer who sets foot in that place! The price is quite reasonable. Last but not the least it has one of the cleanest washrooms I have seen. Every foodie must check this place out. They won't be disappointed!  With

Nice place to hang out. The decor, nothing out of the box, but pleasantly fresh... may be a wee bit understaffed. We saw only one waiter running around, as others were lazying about. The poor girl was a mess!
Now rhw food. We had potato salad with sour cream and cilantro and green chillies. It was really good! I mean really! Humble food made well. We had grilled chicken wrap. Nothing amazing. A let down, after the amazing potato salad.  Then we ordered for quiche. The filling was good, but the base was, umm.. Undercooked. The outer wall crust was over baked. It went brown and was crumbling down. The dish lacked cheese! Not a good thing for quiche!
We then ordered, cold 'chocolate'. It was like drinking cold bournvita. Totally not worth it!

The ambience is certainly very soothing. White interiors present a striking contrast with black furniture. The omelette and Cinnamon rolls were delectable. The cookie too was nicely warmed. The coffee wasn't steaming hot. Also, probably the number of staff waiting at the tables need to be increased.

Visited this place during the puja panchami.
Ambience:- warm and cosy..on entering u get the feeling of a casual and laidback atmosphere which is kinda cool..the decors are good and they have kept some board games as well as books for their customers i suppose on the shelf..neat and well mantained..the ambience is top class.. the concept of this cafe is quite appealing.
Food:- we ordered for an expresso and a macchiato as our beverage..
They are served in relatively small sized cups.. the expresso was a tad bitter to my taste even aftr adding a few pouches of both brown and white sugar.. may b i m not used to it, nor have i tasted this kind of strong expresso in other famous coffee shops.
The macchiato had the same strong bitter taste..it was good..but i guess we were not habituated with the strong bitter taste of coffee bean extract..
Next came mushroom quiche...it was an outstanding dish..Hats off...small in portion..however simply delighted the taste buds..the crust was crisp and thick and the mushroom filling was very tasty..cheesy with nice flavour.
Next ordered for the KTown sandwich. Bagels are used here as base instead of burger buns or plain breads.. tasted different.. Bagels were quite hard and chewy so not sure if freshly baked..However the filling was really good..
The lettuce was fresh and crisp and complemented the chicken filling dressed in mustard sauce..unusual flavour but great taste..the portion of filling was generous.
Next for dessert we ordered cinnamon roll as well as apple pie.. apple pie is something i ll not recommend..the crust was good but the filling didnot taste good at all..the filling looked good with grated apples but had overwhelming taste of sugar and mint jelly.
Cinnamon roll was good.. strong flavour of powdery cinnnamon will hit you at every bite and best had with coffee..however i have had better cinnamon rolls in kolkata itself..
Service- Well mannered, well behaved staff.. attentive and took our orders with care. Also the serving plates were cleared away swiftlyaftr we had completed that particular dish.
Overall a nice feel..may b the food cud have been better.. +0.5 for ambience and service and the concept of this cafe..

A cozy corner café.. Awesome coffee nd tea which is brewed on ur table hence fresh.. We ordered an Ice Cream Sandwich that was foodgasmic. An experience worth remembering and a place worth revisiting. The coffee beans are roasted in the cafe so there is a beautiful coffee smell to the place along with some good bakes.. I happened to have a meet with my best friend in this place and we had some serious long chat for over two hours and there was no hurry from the staff. Friendly, peaceful and an awesome place to chill. Thumbs up to this one.. Happy to have some new hangouts in the city..

You can come here to chill or after visiting the conclave, for deserts and tea/coffee. The hot chocolate is good. Their cinnamon rolls and salted caramel cupcake was great. Delightful place with simple yet sophisticated interiors. It is very well lit up by natural light as well so the overall feeling while being inside is great. Service was good. Such a cute little place which stands out almost artistically in that lane. (Excuse my patronizing, huge fan of kolkata architecture)

The ambience and the decor of the place is beautifully complimented by the 8th day delicacies. Cosily situated in the Beckbagan area, the Chocolate chip cookie melts in your mouth and the K-town Sandwich is a jewel, with chicken deliciously wrapped in mustard between bread slices. All in all an evening beautifully spent!

A good cafeteria with some cool offerings on the menu. Their coffee is good - that's something which we can't really say about too many places in Kolkata any more, particularly with Barrista taking their standards south.

Few, but promising Mexican dishes on the menu. Again something which is almost missing from the food scene in this city. We ordered the breakfast burrito and they did do justice to it (just add rice to it, c'mon you got to know one all the chief ingredients!) Sandwiches come in a bagel which is a welcome change.

Decor is good, and so is the crowd. Guess it's a good place to go for a nice cup of coffee and some short-eats when you're not really up for the whole ging bang!

Coffee and cupcakes are good. Need to improvise bagels quality. They're too hard to chew, we had twice and both times they were hard. Overall, I love the ambience and the staff is cooperative and friendly. And it's very close to my place so a convenient option for weekends. Though it would've been good if they would extend the shop hours till 10pm on weekends.

An interesting place to say the least. The coffee is really good. Especially their French press. The food is average. The bagel was  stale and chewy so didn't particularly enjoy that but the lettuce and the chicken were very fresh so it made up for that. And the cinnamon rolls were rather nice. The decor is simple and the wall art is interesting and rather pretty. Would definitely go back for the coffee again.

A smell catches u off-guard just as u enter the place, and only a true coffee lover will understand by the aroma that he/she is in for a treat.
The coffees are excellent. I lyk my coffee strong, for which the Macchiato was quite a revelation,too good. Although I wud suggest casual coffee consumers to stick to cappuccino or latte as u prefer, as the Macchaito can be a little bitter for your liking. Aunt kay's cookies were lovely. I wish it was more chocolaty. For the first time I had cinnamon rolls. It was more on the sweeter side, with good flavours.
Good service, nice ambience,fresh food, games to play and even comedy nights on tuesdays. This place is surely here to stay.
I had been longing to visit it for quite sm tym, and after todays experience I want to come back for more.

This is a small hangout place I came across while crossing Mocha. Didn't want to wait till I could go there and try out their desserts as the pictures on Zomato were quite tempting. My colleague and I decided to get some desserts packed and got it to office. We picked up a Chocolate Cupcake and an Apple Pie. We missed the ice cream with my apple pie as we had to carry it to office. However both the desserts were quite good. Looking forward to visiting this place soon!

Have visited this place twice, and during both the visits, the cafe was filled with foreigners. It's situated very near to conclave club in beck bagan.

The cafe is not very big, bit the interiors have been done well and gives a bright and spacious look. The cafe also provides with a number of games and books so that one could enjoy it along with a cup of coffee.. The tables next to the windows provide a great escape into happiness when the weather turns a bit cloudy and it starts to rain.

Coming to the food, I have had Hot chocolate which was exceptionally good. The Potato salad was very tasty and a good snack to have in breakfast without feeling too heavy. The whole wheat bagel was warmed before serving and it was nice. I've also had aubergine and wraps which were equally well prepared.

In total, there were no negatives from the place. The only thing which I wanted was a bit more spread in the menu. Otherwise a very different cafe and a nice experience to visit this place.

The location itself is not really convenient. It's in a narrow alley and parking is always a nightmare. A little away from normal thoroughfare. 

The ambience inside is really nice. It's well done up with a good vision that stays true to this coffee shop's name. The lighting is welcoming and the staff is friendly. The coffee shop makes a sincere effort to offer events beyond just coffee brewing to build a sense of community. There are concerts, free board games (though they're in much need of an update), books, book exchanges, stand up comedy nights to keep one interested and wanting to come back. 

The quality of the coffee is really good as they source their beans from Kerala. I've had the pour over and the americano and have not complaints. However, this place needs to improve its to-go cups! I've taken out coffee twice and both times my cup almost fell apart because of the heat from the coffee. (Tip: Either wait a few extra seconds before pouring scalding hot coffee into the cups or get better/stronger cups.) 

The food is okay. The bagel is doughy at its best and stale at its worst. The cookie, scone, and cupcake, however, are wonderful and home-y. Also, if the mushroom quiche is available, do yourself a favor and order it! 

Overall, this is the kind of cafe you go to on a first date or go to to hang out with your friends. I'll go back, for the coffee, if nothing.

Visited on a weekday afternoon- the simple, straightforward decor and the easygoing vibe sat well with me. Had what quite easily was my best cappuccino in the city (the macchiato was excellent too). The spring salad's mix of flavours worked very well for me, the aubergine bagel sandwich was pleasant, not extraordinary. The cinnamon roll, served warm, was the highlight of the meal- it was the right amount of gooey, sugary, buttery cinnamon- my friends and I went quite lyrical over it (okay, mostly I)- and went beautifully with the coffee. For dessert we tried the chocolate chip cookie, the lemon tart and the salted caramel cupcake. The first was decent as far as cookies go, the lemon tart was more lemon-soda tart and did not appeal in the least, the salted caramel cupcake was disappointing- there was nothing caramelly or salted about it, it was Sweet, cold buttercream frosting on a nondescript cupcake. (Confectioner's Touch makes all three of those amazingly well, for those interested. For those not, perhaps you should be. :D)
         For the sake of the coffee, I really hope 8th Day does something about the 'bakery' bit in its name. If it doesn't, I'll grit my teeth and return for the cappuccino and cinnamon roll anyway.

I had been planning to check this new café out since the last couple of weeks and it happened today, finally! So glad we have such an uber cool place to hang out with friends.. Very nice ambience, perfect for chilling with friends. Ordered Cafe Latté, Bagels and Chocolate Cupcake. The Cupcake was extremely sinful and it was over within 5 minutes. Latté was strong and hot, just as I like my coffee to be. Loved the vibrant walls and ambience the most. The staff is very sweet and doesn't mind at all if you ask to click pictures time and again. :D The bill came upto Rs. 256. A Saturday evening well-spent. Will be back sooon.

8th Day Cafe and Bakery has a distinct architecture (both from inside and outside) and feel which makes it quite unique in Kolkata. The look is pretty American and the staffs are cordial. I found the atmosphere in the cafe to be fairly refreshing. One can spend hours reading books, gazing outside through the glass panes along with some really good coffee, or just chit-chatting with friends and loved ones over coffee. I love their Auntie Kay’s Chocolate Chunk Cookies and it is one of those reasons that I would love to visit this place again and again. This place is surely turning out to be one of my favorite cookie joints.

Also, I like the fact that they often arrange various sessions, be it comedy or musical. They should continue doing such stuffs.

The bagels are really delicious so are the salads.
Sweet, small and homely. 
Brilliant experience. A bit crowded over the weekend. I didn't get place here and had to take my date to mocha instead. Hope they get a bigger place soon. But two big thumbs up on the food and service.

Finally! Coffee the way I know it! I'm a huge CBTL troll but here in Kolkata, best tasting coffee so far. Ratio of milk to coffee is the way one would expect it anywhere else in the world. It's definitely not the latte tasting soup other baristas are offering. 

Place is a bit small but I guess cozy is the idea. Lots of books to read and games to play so plenty of distractions for kids and adults alike. Any place that inculcates reading and has coffee is heaven for me. Only one major setback; food is terrible. Pastry in pies and tarts are blonde and undercooked. Even cookies seem under baked. And this is my third try for food. Can't be this consistent in bad pastries. Should've improved by now.

The elegant white building and the name '8th day cafe and bakery' written in gold with a blackboard at the entrance displaying some chalk written quote fills you up with expectations. The place is owned and run by an American family who lives in the same building. So of course, there's an unmistakable American feel, starting from the menu to the ambience. We had hot chocolate, scones, artisan bagels with philadelphia cream cheese filling, red velvet cupcake, Auntie Kay's chocolate chunk cookies and a K-Town sandwich. While I couldn't get enough of the cookies, the K-town sandwich disappointed me a bit. It had too much mustard and I personally feel it would have tasted better with mayonnaise. They probably wanted to Indianise it, but I love the tradional American sandwiches way better!! Also while their beverage menu is pretty extensive, I somehow felt their food menu was inadequate. They should include more non vegetarian titbits. But I am mightly pleased with their desserts. A real treat for your tastebuds!! The staff are really nice and ever helpful. I have heard a friend speak highly of their cinnamon rolls. Looking forward to a visit next time to try those! Thanks to the team for a good meal. Hope you guys become bigger and better!!

With one of my college friends, i visited this café on a weekday afternoon. Both of us have heard a lot about it. It's located very close to mocha near AJC Bose road flyover. First we couldn't locate it and had to call them up. A person with an accent guided us. A white building with the name of the café above the entrance.
A person welcomed us. It was almost full. We occupied a table at one side of the glass window. I like the interior. It was well air conditioned with white brick walls and black false ceiling, well-lighted interior. The road side concrete wall is replaced with clear glass. Beautiful paintings are hanging on the walls. A counter at the entrance showing bakery items and a black board above it with the day's special recipes are there. Since the joint was almost full, people were shouting and talking and this chaos was a drawback for me.
We ordered THE K-TOWN sandwich and iced latte and iced mocha first. Within 15minutes we were served. The sandwich was stuffed with chicken, mustard sauce and raisins and lettuce.The bread was not at all like the regular one and it was rather U shaped,hard with multi grains. Taste was average to me. Both the latte and mocha were good and chilled.
We wanted to try some bakery items and went for salted caramel cupcake and chocolate cupcake. They were truly awesome. The cakes were so soft with the fresh chocolate and salted caramel made an outstanding combination.
One thing i want to mention is that you have to ask for a glass of water.
Service was fast and good. But some house flies disturbed us a lot. I would like to ask the management to solve this issue asap. Price reasonable.

8th Day Cafe has received rave reviews from local publications and Zomato regulars, which is why I was more than eager to try it out.  And like most over-hyped eateries in the city, it ended up disappointing me. The decor though,is pleasant and offers a nice view of the quiet intersection where it's located. We ordered Darjeeling first flush tea, salty caramel cupcake and cinnamon roll. They arrived soon enough and we eagerly tucked into our salty caramel cupcake. what a disaster it was! Cloyingly sweet, without even a hint of saltiness, even the texture of the cake seemed granule-y (or maybe my tongue was coated with sugar crystals) . Why call it salty at all if you aren't even offering the most basic play of flavours? The cinnamon roll was chewy and rubbery. The tea was the only saving grace and frankly we were surprised by that because god knows you can screw up a cup of Darjeeling tea in so many ways.

I was at the 8th day cafe this evening with a friend having heard nice things about it. In fact liked the place too and what we had ordered - especially the 'Aubergine' - Aubergine, Caramelised Onion, Mozzarella, Pesto..served on a Bagel of your Choice, Iced Teas and Lemon Tart. It was slightly after 5:00 pm when we arrived - we noticed there were people - ostensibly musicians - who were practising. One came to know there was a concert slated that very evening. We didn't mind the practice sessions which was fairly noisy - because we do appreciate that they made an effort to play live music and give musicians that space. We however started feeling a bit uncomfortable after we paid up on our first round and decided to stay back for some more coffee and because it started pouring outside. Little did one realise that the contrived politeness of their replies to one reviewer's review "Rainy days are great here! Bring your friends and get something to munch on and more of that delicious coffee" was just that - contrived!  When our coffee arrived it arrived with the check which we hadn't even asked for with a terse 'Please pay first' instruction - I even asked the steward if they wanted us to leave right away which we would have had they been honest. We had already paid for our sandwiches and our iced teas and we promptly paid up for the coffees too. I gathered they were preparing the space for the music session which was to begin at 7 pm. Twice did the servers come and ask if they could remove the coffee presses - with coffee clearly left behind. The music session was to begin a good 45 minutes later. I noticed eager musicians (those that were playing that evening that is) jumping on a woman who had just come in, drenched - saying "Do you want to stay for the concert - there is a cover charge of ...." - She hadn't yet caught her breath having come inside from the torrential downpour - she kept saying she was looking for her friend who may already be in - but people seemed more eager otherwise. Those were disturbing notes for a musical session, one must say. The last straw was when we saw the management getting fidgety - A White guy comes and with the same smirk of contrived politeness starts a conversation about the food. 10 minutes later (and there was a good 20 minutes for the musical to begin) comes and says "We need the table cleared in 5 minutes". Well my friend hadn't finished her coffee and we were not lingering there without having bought cafe food. We have no issues with them wanting the space empty for preparing themselves for any event - however then they should know when to stop services, give their customers who are already inside time to finish their food and conversations - and not hurry them so impolitely. We left with a very bitter aftertaste and it wasn't just the rather ordinary coffee. I also feel expats who open enterprises here especially concerning hospitality would do good to unlearn some of their prejudices and take a cultural crash course or two about what the word 'hospitality' means beyond the cultural posturing of lending out your cafe space to upcoming musicians and hanging a painting or two to be seen as some sort of 'gallery'. My friend and I did certainly feel a lot of hostility at your cafe this evening - and it WASN'T a very pleasant experience.

Have been seeing this place for a very long time now. Finally went there for a quick bite yesterday evening. The first thing I noticed was the well lit up beautiful place. Talking about the food, the menu is extremelyyyy limited and especially vegetarian options. There was very little choice. I called for a mushroom bagel and it was quite different and tasty. But they could work on the menu a little more.

I went to 8th day about a month back and have been deferring my review ever since. 
Since my wife is a vegetarian, she ordered a veg quiche for herself and I an egg bagel. Both were quite average. 
The coffee was quite good. 
My only issue with the place was the lack of options available. 
Serious coffee drinkers should definitely visit this place.

Finally went to 8th Day after hearing a lot of good things about it for an hour or so and was not disappointed. But wasn't overtly excited, too. 

Its right between Mocha and the Conclave (Afraa) near the AJC-Sealdah staion road flyover.

It's simple, warm, well-lit and different - has an American feel to it in it's own small way. The coffees are really good with strong flavors (presentation of the pourover coffee was nice) but the cinnamon roll and scones (what we could order on a short visit) were a little too sweet and gooey to my liking; though I am pretty sure most people like it that way. People are warm and friendly as you have the usual coffee table games and books and stuff. 

There's apparently an Open Mic every Tuesday and an Arcadia Session featuring Nischay Parekh on 21st. These guys knows how to make this place really popular really soon. Will re-visit soon, preferably when it's raining.

One of the best coffee houses in the city. From the decor to the owners and staff, everything is very welcoming and warm. What I mostly appreciate about this place is its simplicity. Its not loud, it does not need to be. I really like the coffee they serve there, the flavours are very robust. Hands down the best chocolate chip cookie in the city if not the country. So moist and chewy that it will take you straight to hell. The cinnamon roll, oh, the cinnamon roll. It is huge and requires focus and determination, easy when the thing is so god damn tasty. I wish they add a little more to their menu, I say this because I am mostly interested to see what the put on offer as most of the things on the menu are pretty tasty. Good job guys, keep it up. Cheers.

A beautiful aroma of coffee flooded my senses as I entered 8th Day Cafe & Bakery and that was followed by a cheerful smile from the person at the counter - a warm welcome indeed. The ambiance was very upbeat sans garish lighting, deafening music or flashy interiors and that, I believe is a novelty in Kolkata. 

This place serves THE BEST ICED MOCHA in town. Period. I love chocolate and strong coffee; now combine the two and give me THE PERFECT BEVERAGE and I am in my own personal heaven. Dear 8th Day, I absolutely love you for this. :D
My friend ordered Hot Mocha; so everybody reading my review - trust me and order the iced version and do thank me later. :P

I also tried the Wholewheat Bagel Mushroom Sandwich - the bread being a little hard, the sandwich was average-y good (a 3/5 basically) and the Quiche - which TBH, I didn't like as it was too too buttery and dense. 

My first experience was good and I hope it will be better next time. :)
A few suggestions: - Please improve on the savoury menu and also, your servers need a little more training as they are not very well informed. 
 
Note to self - Read reviews BEFORE visiting the cafe, as then you would have known that you shouldn't miss the cinnamon roll, the brownie, the scone and the cookies.

Review Update:
Second visit - 19/01/2016
I ordered Garden Fresh Salad, Iced Mocha, Iced Latte, Signature Cinnamon Roll, Salted Caramel Cupcake, and an Omelette with Cheddar Cheese, Tomato, Onion & Capsicum.
Except for the omelette, every other item was UTTER RUBBISH. It pains me to say that the Iced Mocha, which was a coffee lover's delight the last time, was pathetic and watery. ;'(
Sorry 8th Day, I don't want to come again.

Lovely start to my day. Enjoyed the breakfast throughly. The bagel was served hot and fresh. The pour-over coffee gave me the kick I needed. 

The cheese-chicken omelette was succulent. However, the best was saved for last - that magnificent cinnamon roll! 

Definitely worth a few more visits :)

Finally went to the place that was on my wish list from a very long time. Its a must go place for coffee lovers.
There hot mocha is very good, but a special mention is needed to be given to their Ice blended mocha, the best cold coffee I've ever had . Don't miss it.
Bagel sandwich was a new thing that i tried but was not so good. There quiche was much better than bagel.
The decor is quite nice. They have wooden chair thats rare in a cafe but are very comfortable.

A much awaited visit to this American cafe got fulfilled today morning!
No skepticism is there about the gaze that the building and its interior possess.The place was nicely utilized with wall-arts,paintings,table and chairs, though a larger space is always desirous.
We ordered a Quiche and a customized egg-sandwich.The Quiche(which had tomato filling as per today's menu) was soft,but considering a breakfast dish,should be a tad bit larger in size.The bread of the customized-egg-sandwich was pretty hard and chewy and should have been way softer.Though filled well,again considering a breakfast dish,should be bigger in size.And the sandwich was more of a burger than a sandwich. (So,please have a note on the food.Just a suggestion.) All in all,the first visit was marked by nice food,nice ambience and equally pocket friendly. Hoping to have more visits in the days to come.

Just went for one day ....but wasnt satisfied at all..it is situated in such a place,it is difficult to find out,thanx to google map,i found out abt this bakery..my intention mainly was to find out what makes this cafe unique in terms of bakery..ordered few of them--the aubergine sandwich with bagel is what they recommended..and it was average..it was prepared beautifully but the filling was ordinary...it reminded me of CCD's chicken sandwiches as it tastes just like that..i dnt knw why bagel is so special here it tastes nothing like bagel,if you say bagel is a special thing..coffee isnt tasted so cant tell abt that..tasted chocolate tart and the chocolate inside tasted nothing special..cupcakes have too much sugar and you can almost feel biting pieces ..didnt dare to try vanilla cupcakes as salty caramels have that much sugar..the only thing i liked were the scones..filling was good and overall it gives you a good taste with the sugary coating outside..
Very dissapointed because i was really hoping for good mouth watering food..however if i missed anything, let me know !!

My brother insisted me "8th Day" when I asked for  "Adda". I was spellbound when I saw the restaurant. The outer design was very unique and so was the inner decoration. The tables, the chairs, the small sitting arrangements are done so intelligently keeping in mind the privacy of lovers and the excitement of a group. Fortunately I met the owner who is an American and the master mind behind the restaurant. The K Town and potato salad was ordered and I was curious to taste the new bee. After it was served I was no more concentrating in any sort of incidences or sounds happening around me. The first bite and a Mocha made my day. I will suggest each one of you go and have a "ADDA" or give a special moment to your lover.

The staffs are very cool and serves you with a smile.

8th day! The name amused me and on enquiring I figured it's a new day.. as a week has on 7 days.. love the name but also loved the place... In its dark wooden basic furniture against white walls and tons of games like monopoly..scrabble to choose from it also offers a very upbeat cafe.. though calcutta is high on cafe but this place has breaks from the clutter.. 

Tried the latte... bagel with cheese cream .. mushroom quiche and short bread.. The food is not that different in taste. . Though I believe there quiches should be served warm and not at room temperature... 

The staff is very jovial..and super courteous. My friend did order a drip coffee whose pic I have attached..and he did say he loved it.. 

Will be making more visits to experience more of it..

This was a place on my to-go list for a while. So with the husband in town we decided to hit the place towards the evening. The location and the facade of the building got a quick thumps-up from us. The decor inside was simple and the ambience was pretty relaxing and though it was packed with people and there was a waiting of about 15 mins the staff was very pleasant and attentive. 
The husband being a tea drinker was super excited to see the variety of tea on offer as usually most cafes do not serve leave tea and he is mostly on the losers end while visiting cafes. 
So we ordered a first flush -tea, a French press coffee, a cinnamon roll, a velvet cup cake, a carrot cup cake and beagle chips with humus.
The tea n coffee were a ten on ten. The humus we loved as it was not the grainy synthetic garlicy thing that most places serve.
The cinnamon roll was big enough to split between the two of us. Very cinnamon-y..I liked the husband did not like it that much. The red velvet we have had better though the carrot cake was very nice. In the cup cake however the icing was a little too heavy n sweet like the old Kathleen's icing.....
All in all a good experience but a little less variety on savoury snacks.

Heard a lot about this place so finally decided to visit it. Went With a friend and instantly loved the vibe the place had :) called for a chicken tikka bagel with pita chips.... The bagel was hard but the filling was nice. We called for a mushroom quiche and I loved it. The cold coffee was too strong for me taste but nice and creamy! Then finally the chocolate chip cookies was utter bliss! I loved it :) I even packed them for home :) the service guys need to be a little well informed henceforth.

With clean, white, bright interiors and dark wood table tops, 8th Day Café & Bakery is a great space for some chill out time with a good book and has very quickly become a hit among cafe-hoppers for capturing perfect shots. Situated opposite lane of Mouchak sweet shop and close to Mocha in the Park Circus Area, this contemporary venue serves up dish after dish all day long. They also offer a range of pastries and desserts to be enjoyed with a cup of coffee or tea. This is the kind of spot to enjoy some "me" time, the serenity certainly calms you.

We ordered pretty simple menu, ‘The K-Town’, ‘Quiche’, ‘Old Fashioned Apple Pie’ accompanied with two cold coffees ‘Coffee Latte’ and ‘Coffee Mocha’. The K-Town looks attractive; curried chicken salad topped with romaine lettuce served on wheat bagel, we were expecting something heavenly. But one bite I am down to earth, bagel was chewy even chicken pieces were stiff and gristly. We were not at all satisfied with The K-Town, even for an instant we thought about talking with management regarding this issue.

Now it’s time for Quiche and yet again we found it tempting, flavourful pie crustes. But this time no false promise, I found it truly unique and awesome. It’s an open faced pastry crust with a savoury filling of eggs, cheese, caramelized onion and mushroom with gruyere and was perfect for ravenous people. Definitely try out this incredible, melt-in-your-mouth quiche for your inner ecstasy.

Both cold coffees were nice and I even sipped from my friend’s glass. I especially liked Mocha but I missed that wow feeling. I think they need lots of improvement and little innovation in cold coffee section. I also request management to improve their menu and add more options in cold coffee and smoothie.

In desserts Old Fashioned Apple Pie was just amazing. It was filled with real crisp apples, tossed with sugar, topped with delicious ice cream scoop and fragrant spices for a scrumptious pop of natural sweetness in every bite. Flaky crust with a homemade taste was sure to be everyone’s favourite.

If you're itching for a refreshing caffeine fix on a hot day, stopping by 8th Day Café & Bakery for a cup of their famous coffee would be a wise choice. Just a 3-minute walk from AJC Bose Road flyover, this cafe dishes out light cafe bites, desserts and coffee.

Spoiler Alert- HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!Finding this place was not a hassle. follow the directions on google maps and it pretty much right there.Classy and sophisticated with old school interiors, the place is jam packed with foreigners! Going through the menu I pretty much settled on the cinnamon roll on seeing that they served it here. along with that we placed an order of a combo of a curried chicken sandwich called the K-town and tomato soup along with an order of a bagel with Nutella. The sandwich was good with the entire chicken and salad in between the bagel being well covered in the dressing. The soup was nice but there is so much a tomato soup can do for your palate. The cinnamon roll though very sweet was awesome!!!!! Slightly crumbly in the sides and soft and gooey in the center, its a delight!!!! The bagels were nice and hot with the perfect combination of crunchy, soft and chewy along with a somewhat just adequate amount of that delicious elixir of life known as Nutella!!!On the whole, this place checks all the right boxes! good food, classy atmosphere, friendly waiters and awesome food! Though I thought of awarding it 4.5 stars I deducted half a star as some interior decorations could be improved upon ( such as the partially see through curtains which takes away from the old school vibe this place desperately tries to exude). But its nitpicking really.Not very expensive, yet truly sophisticated this is one place I highly recommend!

This was on my list for quite sometime and i finally got the chance to visit this place. All thanks to Google Maps. Not that it's too hard to find but still. It's near Belle View, just a few steps ahead and on the other side. Opposite Afraa Deli.

Went there and the building with its white exteriors looked great and the interiors even better. The area is big enough and you can go with a group or just two people and you will be comfortable inside. Very classy with it's looks, something i really prefer over ' swag '

Ordered a Cinnamon roll, Bacon with Nutella and a K-Town sandwich with Chicken inside and they gave a tomato soup, was a combo meal. And i must say it's impressive. All of them tasted well and the size of the sandwich was really great too. Provided enough Nutella separately to eat with the bacon's and service was relatively fast enough and they people over there are really nice and friendly. The meal didn't look too much but our stomach was more or less filled and it was a good evening meal.

The price is not something that should bother people really. It's neither that expensive as it looks or that cheap. Pretty much affordable. So if you love a quick snack or two. Go for it. Lovely place.

And yes an advice, the cinnamon roll is pretty sweet, do take something along with it otherwise it's tough to handle, the sweetness.

Seriously recommended.

Oh my god ... I just had the most amazing chocolate tart and cookie in town .... Very casually I enter this newly opened cafe and decide to try the bakery .... I take it home... Once I open the box .... I see a warm chocolate cookie and its gooey and chewy .... And the chocolate tart it just melted in my mouth it was so fresh... I wish I could post a picture of it but it's long gone.... Can't wait to try the other items on the menu....

8th day cafe and bakery- opened near mocha. My first experience was really tantalizing. The get up of the cafe was really nicely done. It is something not common, something out of your routine life of 7 days. Here you get the experience of an 8th day. As soon as you enter you get the smell of coffee. Service is too fast. Staffs are cordial and happy to serve. We had ordered breakup brownie, latte, chocolate chunk cookies, Aubergine(sandwich), old fashioned apple pie. Highly recommended.

8th Day Bakery - A newly opened Cafe Near Mocha. 
=====
Location: Head Straight in the lane towards mocha and keep going straight and the road will bend on the right, there you discover 8th day Bakery on the right side. 
=====
Intro: My first experience about 8th day bakery was really tantalizing. The get up of the cafe was really nicely done. From the outside it was white. Inside, they have really good lights and two rooms with wall paintings, games and much more. I was recommended by one of my friend to visit this cafe and as i visited this cafe, the staff courteously handed me over the menu card. I was quite happy to see such a cafe opening up in the city of joy. Nevertheless, after looking at the ambience and hearing the soft music, i continued with my order. On the front, i could see quite few items written in the chalk board and Quiche. 
=====
Food & Beverages ordered:

1) Golden Sunrise - It was a traditional english breakfast tea. Robust and strong as they said. ;) #musttry

2) Whole Wheat Bagel with Chicken - It was quite chewy and i personally have given the feedback to the owner and will be looked up on it. I did not like it. 

3) Signature Cinnamom Roll - It was too good. Specially the sweet white stuff and cinnamom made a really good combination. #musttry

4) Bagel Chips with Hummus - Quite Crisp. Tasted really good too. #musttry
=====
Pros:

1) Ambience is quite nice. 
2) Staffs are courteous. 
3) Food quality is good.
4) They personally care for the feedbacks. 
5) Reasonably priced. 

Cons:

1) Need more items on the menu. 
=====
Expert Suggestions:

1) Bagel needs a lot of improvement. 
2) Get more items on the menu 
=====
Meal for two: 300-670 max
=====
Summary:

Food Presentation: 4/5
Food Quality: 4/5
Food Quantity: 3.8/5
Ambience: 4.3/5
Hospitality: 4/5
Value for money: 4/5
=====
Conclusion: I would LOVE to visit it again and give more reviews on the dishes. A really good place to chill. :)

I visited this place only once. There's a unique aura about this place, which is very warm and welcoming. The smell of coffee that greets you on entering is so refreshing.

I had ordered The K-Town. I felt it was a bit too dry and chewy, though the taste was different and nice. Also, the menu is very limited (not too many options). The cupcake was delicious and so was the coffee.

The staff was very friendly, helpful and accommodating.

It was a decent experience and a good place to visit.

I finally visited the place after having it on my list for a long time, and was really fun.!
8th Day Cafe & Bakery, really gives you the feeling of the 8th day, as soon as you enter the place. It is something not common, something out of your routine life of 7 days. Here you get the experience of an 8th Day.

As soon as you enter the place, you'll be taken by the smell of coffee. They serve freshly roasted coffee and so the smell is heavenly.!

We had Pourover Coffee, and it was amazing. It was the first time I had a Pourover Coffee and the experience was really nice.!

Ice Mocha Coffee, the coffee was strong, and tasted delicious.!

We had a Build-your-own Breakfast Sandwich with  Everything Bagel, Cheddar Cheese and Pesto, that was also different and tasty, the bagel was chewy and was good.!

The Carrot cake with Cream Cheese Icing was good, but not that great. I was expecting soft cream cheese, but it was hard and extra sweet.

The Signature Cinnamon Rolls are really nice. I've had cinnamon rolls earlier, but this one is something different. The cinnamon filling is thick and in good quantity, and so we loved it.!

The ambience of the place is good, the staff was very cordial, and so we enjoyed our evening.

P.S. "There are no bad choices here..you're safe.!"

This place is quite tricky to locate , but this place is very decent and refreshing. The staffs are very cordial and happy to serve. I am a cappuccino lover and thus ordered 2 cappuccino and the signature cinnamon roll. This place really serves good coffee. My friend is very happy with the coffee and I am coming back to this place for sure. The cinnamon roll was average according to me as it was very sweet for my taste buds.
Overall this place serves really good coffee, will try their sandwiches next time.

This cafe is located right opposite the conclave in the park circus area. It is quaint and the decor is pleasant and simple. My friend and I visited this place for hi tea post lunch and it was a nice experience. We order for a chunky chocolate cookie, apple pie with ice cream and two lemon iced teas the cookie was delicious given it came for such a reasonable price and the apple pie is one of the best I have had in town. It was very good and cinnamon-ey. The staff was also very welcoming and amiable as well. I think a visit to this cafe is not a bad decision to make especially if you're looking for a quick bite.

I am unable to understand what's good to eat or drink in this cafe! I went 1st time and ordered a chicken bagel sandwich and iced tea. Bagel sandwich was way too bland and bagels, which apparently are their forte was stale n soggy. The iced was way below the average.
After reading the reviews, I thought of givin it an another try. This time it was worse. I orders bagel chips with a dip and chocolate chip cookie. Both were inedible, especially the cookie.
Coffee is just about average.
Ambience is nice but there has to be somethin good to eat to support that.

The best coffee in Kolkata. At least among the ones I have had at the cafes in Kolkata. 
I was there on a weekend with friends and found it to be a place I would like to be again to. Located near beckbagan, its marked out in google maps, else finding it would have been a little difficult. 
The decor is excellent, like a little american cafe, keeping in with the food served here. I had a cinnamon roll and apple pie to go with my press coffee. Their bakery is also good, though I would say the food is still in the stages of development ! 
It closes at 9 though, else I would have liked to sit some more and soak in the flavor of the place. 
In short, highly recommended if you want  your coffee not good, but perfect

I'm someone who personally digs small cafés that are filled with positive vibes and this place fits the bill perfectly. The interiors and service instantly make you happy. The food can be improved upon. 

Visited this place with two friends and we ordered for an ice mocha, French press coffee, quiche, bagels with cream cheese, bagel sandwich and apple pie. Everything was good. My only complain was with the quiche and bagel. The quiche was not quite up to the mark and the bagel was extremely chewy.  

Prices are easy on the pocket and despite a few hassles, you end up leaving the place with a huge smile. 

Would definitely be back again.

Still looking out for that most impeccable and authentic blend of coffee ? then this newly opened place near park circus area is your best bet ! I can vouch that their press coffee and latte is one the best that I have had in this town . Food options are not that great. However, you can enjoy your tea/coffee with a some cookies or cupcakes . Service is a tad bit slow … but then you can always look around the chique and smart interios while they bring in your blend ! Surely going to revisit .

If you romanticize cafes and streets, you'll have a good time here. Rough feel of pale white walls, warms lighting, dark wood chairs and big glass windows will provide you with an ideal setting for hot cup of coffee/tea. You might enjoy reading a book as well, unless the table next to you wants to eat up the peacefulness of the quite cafe ( true story). 
I was excited about the salted caramel cup cake but was disappointed with the bland taste.

8th Day is a cute little cafe that serves awesome coffee,breakfast sandwiches and salads and added points for great service and super curteous staff. There is, however, one problem that I have with this place: they add a enormous amounts of sugar to their cookies and cupcake icings. The muffins taste lovely by themselves but the icing almost made me puke. The red velvet cupcake icing tasted powdery , had too much sugar and almost no cream cheese and same goes for the other cupcakes as well.  
     I would suggest they add less sugar to the cookies and icings and increase the whipping time for the icings. For the chocolate cookies they could even add a little bit of sea salt for a slight variation.  So much of sugar will only make people ill and this needs to be acted upon as soon as possible. This issue made me give thus lovely cafe a 3 star rating.

I had bookmarked this cute cafe for pretty long. Visited today for breakfast and had a very fine experience. The decor is elegant yet has a funky outlook, the entrance is pretty, food tastes good and service is prompt. We ordered Quiches, Auntie Kay's chocolate cookies, cappuccino and Autumn Crescendo tea. Sumptuous it was. Do try

Located diagonally opposite the alliance of France, 8th day cafe and bakery has a very appealing look. The ambience is wonderful and the staff is courteous. They have limited menu, which I think is great as all the items in their menu are good. As soon as you enter you get an aroma of coffee and baked goods and you see these really delicious looking baked sweets. We tried the iced mocha, cafe mocha, brownie, salted caramel cupcake and the aubergine (sandwich). All were delicious, however I felt that the bagel could have been a little softer and the cupcakes could be less sweeter. Otherwise great taste. The coffee was mouth watering. One of the best coffee in town. Finally nice cafes are opening up in Kolkata. Kudos to that. I definitely recommend it.

HORRIBLE FOOD !!!

I think the place is best described as a cafe where u can sit back order a coffee and kill time !!!
absolutely horrible food the bagel was stale the coffee was cold the coleslaw was too sour and the cinnamon roll was under cooked but the red velvet cake was okay !!!! almost nothing that I ordered was good !!! I am extremely shocked that how all the tables were occupied !!!
one of the worst places in kolkata, I'm extremely disappointed !!!

ambience was good it was neat and clean
service was poor
very few items on the menu 

I will never ever visit this place again and neither will I recommend it  to someone!!! 

Please do not go by the 4.2 rating you'll be extremely disappointed !!!


P.s  zomato should have a negative rating system too for places like this!!!

The coffee is great but the food is bad. Had the bagels and it was raw. They changed it but again it was not properly baked or the batter was not made correct.

Have been seeing this new place come up right opposite to my french classes(near conclave, theatre road); the name for some reason built the curiosity in me to check it out.
The ambience is simple, minimalistic and elegant. Smiling staff, from what I could reckon from my visit the place is rub by a group of sudanese nationals- so expect a foreign touch to the food(in a good way).
Ordered sandwich which came with a side and lemon ice tea- both were good, especially the side- garlic hummus with baked bagel chips. All in all a good place at a fairly reasonable price given the location and ambience they are providing. Looking forward to more visits. Cheers.

Nice place , nice ambience , nice staff and mouth watering food. 
We had Break up brownie that is basically chocolate brownie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream , chocolate cupcake and Salted caramel cupcake. The break up brownie and chocolate cupcake were so tasty, soft and perfect that I can go again and again only for those 2 things. A must visit Caffè , I recommend.

Best coffee in the city! A proper american coffee shop! Their pour overs are an amazing experience. I love their cappuccino too with an extra shot of espresso! I love the wood feel of the interiors. Very smart. Very casual. Grant and his wife, an american couple living in city for the last three years are the proud owner. They are very passionate hosts and everything in 8th day cafe has been conceived with a lot of passion. The service is excellent. The quality of the bakes are really authentic. They serve the best scones and cinnamon buns in the city. And not to forget their quiche...and ofcourse their mini apple pie. With or without ice cream they are to die for! What I like most is their menu- its a minimal menu perfect for a cafe and prepared to perfection! I will keep going back!

Having heard a lot about this cafe, i visited it for breakfast with a friend. The menu was intriguing with scones, salted caramel cup cakes, bagels, quiche and a range of fine tea. We ordered a cinnamon roll, herbed scone, caramel cupcake, sundried tomato quiche, pourover coffee and an earl grey tea. The cinnamon roll, while well made and the favourite of many, was too sweet for my liking. The salted caramel cupcake had a lovely flavour for the icing and the scone was buttery and flaky. The quiche sandwiched the sundried tomatoes and had good subtle flavours. The cupcake base, quiche and scone could have been a litrle more moist, which would have made them even better. The pourover coffee is a lovely strong filter coffee which has a portable single mug filter capacity. All in all a decent experience and an opportunity to try some unique flavours and scones in the very city.

Found out about this place through zomato and since then wanted to visit this cafe! The white exterior photos and the creamy frothy cappuccino was tempting me to no end! 
This place is a little tricky to find but convenient, just located opposite  Alliance Francaise, but the address doesn't mention the landmark at all! I had to call up the cafe to find it's exact location. The place is impressive, nice seating area, very cosy, filled with board games - perfect place to hangout with your friends !
As promised by the zomato reviewers the coffee was one of the best coffee I have tasted in Kolkata ! It's creamy, frothy, smooth ..everything you expect from a good cappuccino ! 
But I was rather disappointed with their baked items. 
I ordered a cream cheese plain bagel ( very nice but would have preferred a crispier bagel )  and a K-town sandwich which is basically curried chicken inside a bagel with a salad dressing ( good seasoning, nice flavours ) a Darjeeling tea ( refreshing ) a quiche ( didn't like the taste ) and a chocolate chip cookie ( yikes ) 

The chocolate chip cookie is the worst tasting cookie I have ever had. It's overtly sweet, doesn't have the crunch and the chocolate taste doesn't reach your mouth! I didn't even bother to finish the cookie after two bites.
The place is full of overexcited teenagers so it's rather noisy ! Staff is very earnest and attentive. This is a pretty new place, hopefully in the near future they will improve their quality of baked items and incorporate a more interesting menu.

This place is very newly opened. Finally a new cafe in Kolkata without Hookah!! Have been tired of all hookah places opening up.n me being allergic to smoke have few to choose from. Visited this cafe twice already. Lets get reviewing:

Pros:

Love the ambience.. Very different from the other cafes in the city.

Coffee is to die for.. Amazing roasted coffee.

Drink order: cappucino, French press strong coffee, iced tea, iced latte n they all were BRILLIANT!!

Food order: American scone, chocochip coffee, oatmeal cookie, brownie, grilled chicken salad. N all I could think was only if I had more appetite!! I was wanting more..

Play ur favourite card or board game while u enjoy your coffee

Cons:

Limited seat n place gets full. Waiting can be hectic.

Great work done with this cafe. Am always trying to find a reason to go here :)

Update:
I had the cookies yesterday for the first time. Absolutely fantastic and very good value :) 

------------------------
So the apple pie and the quiche with the sundried tomatoes absolutely had me. They are amazing. The apple pie was perfect. The pastry was rich, the apples smelt amazing with all that cinnamon and all. Had the bite to it and them it all disappeared. It was such a lovely warm apple pie. The kind which gives you that warm fuzziness inside after you have it. And the quiche. It was so good. Rich, with a really great pastry (which is guess they are just really good at) and fulfilling. Also, sundried tomatoes!

I had the pourover coffee and it was terrific as well. Full of good coffee flavour. Also, I love that drama it brings to your table. The cinnamon roll was so incredibly sweet, but so incredibly tasty. I mean it's supposed to be really sweet with the absolutely decadent sugar glaze and all. But you actually couldn't stop having it. And that speaks volumes of it.

I also had the roast beet salad, which was really fresh, most importantly. How I yearned for a bit more of the feta though. If I had one slight complaint, it would be the bagels though. Nice and crusty they were definitely, but just somehow just felt a bit dry. I am not sure whether it was just me though.

I adore the fact that the owner puts in all that effort to go from table to table talking to everyone who comes in. Definitely coming back. I have my eyes on those scones. And I am going to finish all the quiches and the apple pies they have.

There are places that do injustice to coffee & this is not that place.
This small coffee shop has the best coffee makers from across the world. The aroma of baked cookies & bagels will melt the heart out of you. And, if you haven't visited this place already, you are doing injustice to them. And to yourself. And to the coffee. And to the adorable American owner who'd probably come to your table casually chatting away with you, while filling your empty glass of water.
Congrats 8th Day, you just earned yourself a loyal customer.

One of those days when you hear about a new place serving the best coffee in town and you look it up on zomato more than three times, can't hold it any longer and call your friend and ask them to visit it with you, which they are more than happy to do because they love coffee too. And at the end of it all, it turns out to perfect. 
8th day cafe and bakery makes you feel so happy, you wouldn't want to come out of it. 
When we went at the later time of the day, most of their stuff was over. So we ordered for a cappuccino and their popular pourover coffee. We also called for a chocochip cookie. The cappuccino was rich, smooth and creamy. I loved it. My friend loved her pourover as well. The cookie was delicious, fresh out of the oven.
We stayed there for a while and had a little chat with the owner, Mr. Grant, who was friendly and supersweet. 
The staff was helpful. The place has an American feel to it and a lot of foreigners drop in at this place. 
Well, officially my new everyday place.
Also, their Barista is hot. ?

Frankly speaking, the unique name of this place and not so usual decor got me interested in trying it out! Hence, i landed here on a lazy Saturday evening with my friends.
Upon entering we realized the space is not too big but, is well organised and still in-the-process of enhancements of the interiors.
We occupied a table by the window and started with the beverages. 
We ordered few cappuccinos and a cup of First flush. Tea was decent while the coffee was pretty good, lightly creamy but intense and served with a pretty leaf pattern :)
Moving on, we ordered two sandwiches which are served on a bagel and small cup of sides of your choice. 
We picked The Aubergine with Coleslaw on the side and The K-Town with Potato Salad on a whole wheat bagel.
The Aubergine stuffing was really nice, different, tasty and so was the other curried chicken filling. Potato Salad on the side was nice and fresh while the Coleslaw was less than ordinary. Also, the bagels used were served cold, hence hard to bite in as a sandwich.
It would have been definitely better if they had slightly warmed it before preparing as a sandwich to make it soft.
Following the savory items to satiate our sweet-tooth we ordered :
A Cinnamon Raisin Bagel with Philadelphia Cream Cheese - The bagel was just okay but the cream-cheese was disappointingly bland and not cheesy at all.A Date scone which was lightly sweetened, crumbly and soft, as scones are usually expected to be.
Finally, the item which topped my list as a favorite among all the items i tried here is Carrot cake with cream-cheese icing. It was perfectly sweet, moist, fresh and the icing was decently cheesy. Although i would love it more if they dropped the grainy sugary texture of the icing and kept it smooth.

Overall i would give this place 
3 for Taste & Variety
4 for Service  
4 for Pricing and, possibly another try as well for their other variety of Cupcakes :)

Good coffee has finally arrived in Kolkata! Came back to the city after a while only to be surprised by the simple yet impressively done menu of this place. The bagel sandwich unexpectedly reminded me of the bagel I had in Paris. Yes, it was that good. A little towards stiff side and not soft, just the way bagels are supposed to be. Thank you guys for getting drip coffee to the city ( a must try if you're a black coffee lover)
Unexpected and surprised - are the two adjectives that describe my experience at this cafe. After long a cafe in my homie which I look forward to visit again soon.
Hope they keep it up and don't dilute their standards like many other cafes in the city have.

Rumor said it has the best coffee in town, and I wasn't disappointed. The place has a nice aroma of freshly brewed coffee (pourover - their self brewed flavored espresso is a must try) and it was mesmerizing to say the least.
I was always the kind of person who likes to have a sweet breakfast, a nice hot cup of coffee coupled with waffles or bagels or donuts. And this place was just right for me. They have the best cinnamon rolls and bagels in town. You can play some boardgames till the time your order arrives. Don't expect much of the regular breakfast menu which you get everywhere else. This place is more of a bakery type.
They haven't overdone the interiors, yet a kindof foreign charm is present. The owners and their cute little kids are very warm and welcoming.

Hope the service and quality of food is maintained and improves as the days go by. As i would love to revisit again and again. Even my fussy dad liked the apple pie which says a lot about how brilliant the food is. All the best to the owners and staff.

Visited for the second time. The Caramelised Onion and mushrooms quiche was really good. So was the pesto garlicmayo, mozarella, mushroom sandwiches. The salads keep disappointing though :/

After a friends recommended this cafe to e, I landed up there today. Surprised to see a few white guys running the place. Nice change to the crappy and underpaid staff that you see in most other cafes in the city. I ordered quite a few things on the menu. Top Picks: Sundried Tomato Quiche, Potato Salad, Coleslaw. Bagels were good but the bread could have been softer. Very clean and prompt service. My 3 year old had  a good time with the board games they have on offer and the story books. Overall a great place to chill, fresh look. All the best and maintain your existing standards. See you soon.

i visited recently and ordered a cappuccino , there signature cinnamon roll, the salt and caramel cupcakes as well as the chocolate cupcake, all were mouth watering and of great quality which is such a treat in itself in this city .

The coffee is really good, a quaint place to enjoy a quick cuppa 
will be back a million times for sure.
oh and the owner is really welcoming and friendly , reminded me more of the service back home.

After a few updates by friends decided to head out for a lazy sunday breakfast. The sough after pourover coffee experience was quite delightful and the coffee itself tasted divine with no bitterness. The almond scone was soft,buttery and yielded quite easily, the bagels are an easy delight and the Potato Salad itself was creamy and had a nice bite. The soup of the day -Cream of Potato was well seasoned and although the menu is a tad limited but the options works really well. The owners and staff are a friendly lot and paid a lot of attention and care during the service. Will definitely visit again and try the other options! :)

I had seen an update on FB about this cafe roasting its own coffee beans, and after a short conversation with myself, decided to head over for some coffee after a very heavy meal. I was persuaded to try the Pourover, after I declared my love for black coffee, and it is a little bit of an experience in itself, and a lot of fun. The coffee itself, after it was brewed, was great - with little hints of wood in the background. This coffee is 100% chicory free, so it is not as bitter as most. My friend ordered a cappuccino and he declared it to be pretty good too. Hopefully I would come back here to sample the food!
