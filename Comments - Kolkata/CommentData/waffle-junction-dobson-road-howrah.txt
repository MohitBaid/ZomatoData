Well one of the best places to indulge your love for waffle. 
I would especially recommend the kitkat crunch as it satisfies your desire for something chocolaty. The classic Belgian if you would prefer the authentic feel to your waffle.
Easy on d pocket but filling for your soul this place is a must try for all waffle lovers and especially if you have a sweet tooth.
If you are in the area and looking for a quick snack this is the place to be.

Blueberry waffle was good and Kitkat waffle was very sweet.Overall experience was good.One thing to remember is that they don't accept card.
They take 15 min to serve waffle.

It's is very conveniently located near howrah ac.....it opens at around 2am. The attender was very helpful and well behaved and the atmosphere is very soothing with loud songs. I took the Oreo waffle it costed me around 145 rs half waffle. It was quite tasty but didn't find anything special or unique. It's a little costly compared to the food. The quality of food is high.
