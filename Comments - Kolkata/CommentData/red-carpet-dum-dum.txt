My best friend,who visited all the five star hotels but still is just crazy about the Fried Rice and Chilli Chicken which this place serves and as a result he took me to this place once. It looks shabby but yes my friend is right...fried rice and Chilli Chicken of this place is awesome. I have not tried any other dish so cannot comment on that. Price is very cheap. Service is quick.

This place is located at 2no Airpot Gate. It's a small joint which renders you good food in cheap prices.
There's nothing fancy about this place but the food which they serve is absolutely delicious.

I ordered Chicken Chowmin and Chilli Chicken. The Chicken had 8pcs and it tasted really good. The quality they serve is pretty decent and the service is promt.

Have been to this place multiple times. The place looks small and not-so-fancy from outside with an average ambience. The ac restaurant serves delicious food. 
The quantity of food they serve for each plate is for 2person actually. It's hard to complete alone. 
The best among the menu is 
Chicken fried rice, chicken butter masala, chicken Manchurian, schezwan chicken, fish manchurian,chilli paneer,butter roti and the special biriyani. The quantity is ample. Plus,there's no extra tax. Such a relief!
The services are absolutely prompt and staffs are very polite. 
Since this place is near to my house,I keep on visiting!

I frequently order from this place as it's near to my home. Biriyani is really good as compared to rest both taste and money wise . Chinese is good, rest Indian items are fairly OK.One issue is that their card machine remains out of order most of the time.

Had a layover of 2 to 3 hours at Kolkata airport. This restaurant is quite nearby to gate no 2 of Kolkata airport. Had chilly paneer and kashmiri pulao. Food was quite good and quantity was liberal. The staff was quite helpful. Returned to this place after 4 or 5 years and found their restaurant bigger and better.

very good restuarant though.. cheap and cosy comfy but regularly there is a problem with the menu... one of the best items and popular one is masala kulcha but when ever u odr it is denied by the staff.. at evenings its too crowded  to prepare that.. only one pcs cannot be done... in afternoons the staff members are less so it cannot be done... there is a list of excuses... if u r not preparing remove it... or increase price if necessary to keep up standard of the dish....or else give a timing when its available... i being a regular customer weekly almost and face the same problem ....@debanjan seal

Went yesterday to have dinner at red carpet. Ambiance was not so convincing and so didn't found quality service. We had ordered chicken bharta, chicken chilli, tandoori roti with salad. It seems like chicken bharta was filled with red chilli powder. Chicken chilli and tandoori roti was good. Overall found average food and service.....

Trust me guyz this looks like a very poor restaurant, but they surprised me by giving an amazing dish of chicken Biriyani. The quality and quantity is very good and the price is reasonable. Their Chinese items are also very good to taste. Please visit at least once. 600 for 2 lunch

A place for quality food in the locality. In spite of very limited seating and long waiting time, this place is chosen by the localites for the quality food. Fish fingers, salt & pepper chicken, drums of heaven, chicken chilli kebab and tandoori legs are the signature starters. The mixed or chicken noodles, both gravy and hakka are loaded with meat and come in huge portions. The Hong Kong chicken, schezwan chicken are pretty decent, so is the fish in hot garlic sauce. Among the Indian main course, shahi paneer, chicken patiyala, mutton hundi, roasted chicken, and mutton korma deserves special mention. The naan and the kulcha however are not great. They make good float punch, however it is not available most of the times.

In comparison to the taste and the quantity of the food, the price chart is insanely cheap. It would have been great if this place accepted cards.

Cheap food. Moderate taste. On-the-go joint.
The Handi Biriyani here deserves a special mention though, especially with the Mutton-Do-Piyaza. The Chinese preparation was quite bad. However, the Biriyani is worth a try, because the less oil and soft rice and an above average taste.

This place is very nearby to airport gate no 2. We tried there twice but the quality of food is awful. We also had to wait for long for the food even when the restuarant was half full. The interior and atmosphere is also not that good for family. Take away is available. The only thing could be tried is biriyani. Not recommended.

This is the nearest restaurant to my home. I have been here many times. It serves Indian and Chinese mainly. The Chinese is good, especially the chicken dishes. I also like the biriani served here. The north Indian dishes are okay, but the mughlai preparations are not up to the mark. 
The pricing is moderate, not too high but not very low either. The quantity of the dishes are decent. 
It is quite small inside and the ambience is OK.
So, all in all it is not a bad option for a quiet family dinner.

Chicken pieces are small and the food quality was average.I have mughal dishes some days ago i think the Biriyani
or other mughal dishes are better den Chinese cuisine.  
Ovarall if you try then try Mughal dishes its preaty good never try Chinese.

Foods quality and quantity is not so good. Chinese is OK but the Indian dishes are really bad. Ambiancce is OK and so is the service. 
Prices are OK. 
But if you are a food lover then avoid this place. Overall Below average.
