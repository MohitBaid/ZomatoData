The tea was all right though the coffee wasn't. But the cold beverage was good though. We also ordered a pizza which was really small.
It is a place just to chill for some times. The interior is good and cozy...

Overall a decent and a pocket friendly place to hang out with your gang. Staff service is good and overall you can relax for long hours as this place has comfortable spaces to offer. Food is pretty average and can be improved further

We went to this place for the first time. The interiors is good . Staff are prompt and polite. We ordered Hookah, Red Bull and Masala Chai. The masala chair was good but their hookah was not satisfactory . We didn't get the flavour we ordered. They gave us a hookah of different flavour, we told them about this they were not ready to listen . Overall the experience was not not good.

It's a small place near Metro Shopping centre. Offers quite a good menu though the service isn't appealing. Comfortable and nice sitting. The mocktails we ordered were tasty and pizza was good too. Overall an average experience!

It's an alright place if you have nothing else to do on a slow afternoon.. The hookah is not that great. They do have some good flavour combos in their menu. The ambience and decor is good. The music collection could be a lot better.

Firstly I had to face a little difficulty in uncovering the place. However, it does not affect the rating. When we reached there, we found the place to be a claustrophobic one. Boys and girls were having Hookah. Smoke and a awful smell were dominating the small cafe.Loud music (Extremely loud)was being played. We ordered Burger,Sandwich and a masala tea. The food turned out to be insipid. Probably not my type of place.

not the best tbh.¬† just very average.
their hookah is fine but the food sucks. only thing we liked was the red bull.
the cheese maggi was really bad the pasta¬† was fine but kinda salty. definitely not going back. but the hookah is much cheaper than most places so thats the only positive aspect of this place!

Located just opposite to Chowman, the entrance of The Tea Factory isn't that decent and you might find the place pretty shady.We still decided to give it a shot as we had planned.
On entering, we realized the place isn't that big, can accommodate just about 15-20 people at one time.It had just 2 people to entertain us, including the cook, probably it being a Monday(weekday).But they were well-mannered and responded quickly.The decor is decent, good & having a soothing, relaxing ambience.Only another couple were there when we entered around 8pm but with time, 2-3 more groups did show up.
Now coming to the food -
1)Penne Pasta(White sauce) - Was simply delicious.At a price of Rs.190,it had pretty good quantity & the best part about it was the abundant,beautiful "cheese" !! (5/5)

2)Nachos Bhel - Now this dish took time.The person literally bought Nachos in front of us from outside and then prepared it.But it was yummalicious !! Decent quantity,awesome sensation on the taste buds. (4.5/5)

3)Cold Coffee(with ice-cream) - Was okayish, nothing special.In fact, they put negligible sugar in it & we had to ask for more.(3/5)

4)Veg Grilled Sandwich(had this item packed) - Was okayish. At Rs.100,the quantity was considerably less.(3.5/5)

Overall,a nice place to chill out with friends.Calm, quite and really comfortable with pretty good food !! They serve hookah as well.Prices are considerably cheap(no taxes on the menu price were charged)
But yes, they should have more people at service & really tighten up the time they take for each dish.Decent experience.May give it another visit.

On our second visit, we had almost the exact same items.Just this time, we took cold coffee(without ice-cream) which was simple & tasty(4.5/5)

Wonderful place, would be visiting it a lot more !! :D

The quaint lil cafe in Russel street where you can chill with a cup of freshly brewed tea and snack upon various options! 
I went there on Sunday evening. It was quite crowded because of which the service was damn slow! 
However, the food was above average and the staff were really courteous. We ordered ginger Pudina chai, chocolate fondue, cheese macroni and kiwi ice tea. Kiwi ice tea wasn't as refreshing as expected. The pudina ginger chai was excellent! 

Overall, this place is quite apt to sit and talk endlessly.

Was facinated by the varities of tea available, so decided to visit. Tried sulemani tea, loved it without sugar, quantity is enough for two people. The coffee‚Äã I tried was also great. 

For food tried cheese maggie which was as expected fully cheesy. Cheese fondune was great full of herbs in the fondune. The show stopper was the vegetable lasagne, wow man had such great lasagne after a long time. The service speed is decent and staff are very cordial. Loved the fact that they offered a complimentary dessert after we were done. It was a orero kitkat sundae. Had kitkat and Oreo in every bite, loved it.

Coming to the ambiance, the seating are great for moment's to relax and spend time with ease. The grass deco, the cups the led lights and the yellow lights at the front seat wall is the highlights of the cafe.

Come here for trying new varities of tea and to relax with the soothing music.

Entrance of the place is small and dingy, it's located on the street behind metro plaza thus making it a bit difficult to locate. Thanks to Google maps, after reaching the place we ordered for sheesha, mocktails and pasta. They don't have a menu for sheesha yet, but their starting price is quite high but after we got our stuff on table we did not regret the amount, it was that smooth. The mocktail and pasta both were okayish nothing above average. 
Interiors of this place just reminded me of cafe omg, but the decor made it unique with diy lights, cool wall hanging and the series of mirror on the ceiling. Overall it's a quiet and cool place to chill out for sheesha lovers! 
One suggestion to the management would be to look after the service quality and servers. :)

I went to this place 2days ago. I came to know about this place through Zomato and the place is just amazing. This place is easy to locate and the decor is quite interesting. I really like the place because it is an ideal place where you can hangout with your friends over sheesha.
 Coming to what we ordered we went for Brain Freezer Sheesha, Margarita, Arrabiata pasta and Aglio e olio pasta. Both the pastas tasted fine but the pizza was not up to the mark. But the Sheesha was really good. And its a pocket friendly place which makes it even more awesome. 
But the only problem is that they don't have a sheesha menu so ordering sheesha can be a bit problematic. Other than that everything is fine.

I spoke to the manager and he said the billing system is not yet set up. Not at all a justified explanation.

One fine evening we a group of friends decided to visit this place to have some fun. It is very easy to find. The place is decorated very intelligently. There were cassettes, coffee mugs etc on the wall. There is only one table and the rest was kind of mattresses with a centre table but they were quite comfy. The lighting too was very good. The thing that bugged me big time was loud music. I liked the concept of using tyres as stools. We got ourselves perched quite comfortably and ordered capucinno, virgin mojito and pinacolada with masala chips. Well the coffee was really nice. Among the mocktails virgin mojito was the clear winner. Ok I was very dissapointed with the masala chips. It was merely plain potato chips which can be got from any shops selling maybe 20 rs a packet. Only some kind of masala was sprinkled over it and then it was price tagged at Rs 80. It was such a waste.
Next we orderd 

Butter cheese paneer sandwich - It tasted so bland. There weren't anything there without a slice of raw paneer and a vew veggies. It was even so hard to gobble down with ketchup.

Veg cheese burger - This was a little better over the lot. I liked the stuffing inside but still needs a lot of improvement on the taste. The cheese in it compensated to some extent.

Paneer cheese burger - It was just the same as the sandwich. Nothing worth mentioning.

Brownie with ice cream - Now this was delicious. This was perhaps the best choice that day. It was just awesome.

The service is really very slow. We had to call for the waiter maybe 10times to inquire about the food.

The food needs a lot of improvement. Untill then not visiting this≈ï place.

Yaa 
Kinda affordable..


And this comes in my recommendation now...

Overall a perfect place to take your date. we went to this fabulous place . It was one of my friends birthday . It's so awesome by interiors . Lets jump to food . I can say the food is the best .¬†

Totally on it's own and went great with cheese. The cocktails were equally good. ¬†They made an awesome cake for us and was rightly served. Totally enjoyed our time.Superbly trained and groomed staff.

Ordered a drink and the bread that was given along with it was really good.Thank you so much.

Moving around and searching for cafes, we then found this cafe, Judging by name we thought it to be a simple cafe littel did we know that this cafe would be coming up to an amazing cafe. The food was AMAZING and the hookah was well made which let me go in this cafe again and again. The service of this cafe is very good and the people here are   very well behaved and they serve you the best. I'll suggest to try this cafe once you'll surely come here again and again. THE TEA Factory has an amazing interior too.

Went to this place few days back it is located beside Kenilworth hotel. It's a small cafe, but they have a decent staff, the food was awesome and the music was mindblowing, it's a great place to hangout with your friends the only thing that disappointed me was their hookah. Hookah was not up to the mark.

Visited this cafe cum hookah bar on a Sat evening just to have some light evening snacks. Ordered Mango ice tea and stuffed mushrooms. Mango iced tea was good.¬† Service is too poor.¬† No staffs around - you have to raise your voice to call them. If you have ample of spare time to sit over hookah, then visit this cafe. They took more than 30 mins to serve stuffed mushroom and the cafe was not crowded at all - just only one party was there. Have to leave this place by cancelling the order. This 2.5 rating is for the ambience and the mango iced tea.

If you are up for throwing a small party in a proper themed manner,with delicous mouthwatering snacks and ofcourse elegant Shisha...Keeping in budget as ur constraint.Then this should be your one stop destination to give a try...A very fairly priced cafe just opened next to Metro Plaza..Amazing ambience..and great delicious food...Must try its baked pasta and veg paneer burger..and list of sanwitches to ur taste buds..They are newly opened..but the quality and the service they mantain from the very beginning itself proves that it will really do well in coming time..They have proper sofa sitting..And very soon some more items will be added to their menu..plus lots of surprise coming in as assure..So guys worth a try

Location:5/5,
Ambience:5/5,
Food: A foodie like me couldnt stop trying all..
IN SHORT RECOMMENDED..!!~Great Job Guys..!!

An ambience better than any such small space, well the place is amazing and truly speaking I never expected their pasta to be this mind blowing and plus faiz Bhaiya your sheesha is just amazing.....
If you ever end up dropping in, just tell this guy to make something for him and he will seriously give you the best sheesha in the world.
