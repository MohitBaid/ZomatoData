Was been bored at home when the Mexican wrap came to bring my mood back. Trust me it was far more than what i expected from a never known random place like this. One might also try the roasted basa which tastes amazing as well. May b not excellent but A very pocket friendly place to order online from when u r bored at home or workplace n you wonâ€™t get disappointed atleast

Tried their Mexican wrap combo.  The wrap was just perfectly cooked,light on stomach and delicious. The drink tasted fairly good. But the chicken fingers were too oilyand overcooked..  Would not recommend the chicken fingers!
