"Never Judge a book by its cover" - fits this place perfectly. We had a small gathering of 35 pax at my place over this weekend and we decided to opt for Sidd's Hospitality. We sure can say that we were bang on. Their starters, Crispy Chilly Baby Corn/Chicken Fry and Chilly Chicken just rocked the party. We opted to their special Chicken Biryani and Chicken Chaap with made our palettes come alive. Not only was the food delivered on time but was hot and of the best quality. Surely would recommend this place to my friends for their parties. Keep rocking....

way below par. if this guest house outfit wants to survive as a catering and take out outfit it should source for a proper chef. i have stayed in B&Bs at Chandigarh, and the chefs out there are a dream. even our local dabbawalas are better than this. atleast they don't charge us the premium for street food. disappointing.BTW there's no dine-in available.
