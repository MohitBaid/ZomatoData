Thank you for ruining my Christmas by selling me a  FUNGUS smeared fruit cake. 
Also dear customers, beware of the cashier who destroyed the magnetic tape of my card by swiping it inappropriately. Now I have long queues to endure in the bank for money till I get another card!

I need to know what remedial action will Cakes take for the above?

I've tried cakes over and over again. It's my go to place for birthday cakes. Give their "Chocolate Ganache" , " Lemon Swiss Roll" , "Chocolate Mousse" and "Nutty Corner" a try. They are absolutely heavenly.

"Cakes" is regarded as one the most reputed and reliable confectioners in the town. This outlet is located a few blocks ahead of the Ekdalia Evergreen club (where the Ekdalia Durga puja is held). There are parking spaces available and the traffic rush is relatively less in the area. The outlet isn't so spacious and does not have sitting arrangements. So, one might just have to stand and enjoy their food if planning to grab a quick bite!

Having a strong penchant for lemony pastries, I take a special liking to the 'Lemon Tart' and the 'Lemon Swiss Roll' they make. The 'Chocolate Pyramid' and the 'Ganache Pastries' are excellent to say the least. When it comes to savouries, they have lot to choose from. The 'Chicken Quiche', 'Chicken-Mushroom Puff', 'Tuna sandwich' are the items I keep going back to. Veg lovers can choose from 'Veg Quiche', 'Corn puff', 'Veg puffs' etc. The quiches are hands down one their best creations. The Whole Wheat, Garlic and Tomato breads are always fresh and not to be missed.üò∫

The one aspect this outlet has always lagged behind is with service. On one of my past visits I had an altercation with one the staff members as I was left waiting for several minutes while the person attended to other customers who showed up after me!!üòº However, their dedication to quality and an affordable price range are the things I always look forward to!

Very easy to locate. In case one is not acquainted with the ekdalia pujo, take the lane just after baazar Kolkata, it'll fall on your right hand side.
I had ordered for a chocolate truffle cake the previous day, because their cakes are a huge seller. I couldn't take the risk. I also had their very famous chicken shawarma and egg chicken sandwich.
The egg chicken sandwich was orgasmic. Perfect to satiate the hungry stomach. The shawarma was well prepared and can give the Lebanese joints a run for their money. Coming to the truffle cake, it was delicious. Cakes had never disappointed me as a confectionery.

Their pastries are without any doubt one of the best in town. They also have a lot of options in savouries. 
I had a Turkish pizza. It's basically a flavourful pocket of a curry based chicken filling. 
Then I had their chicken wrap. It was very filling and heavy. The taste was okay not really good.
At last I had the praline crunch pastry. It was just gorgeous and was a delight to the palate

CAKES is a great place with a huge range of snacks and  pastries. The snacks range consist of both veg and non veg and tastes absolutely great and are totally fresh. Then the pastries which are absolutely Devine. So these are the few things that i tried from the menu -

CORN PUFF- it was perfectly baked with corn stuffed from inside.

TRUFFLE SLICE - with its great taste and texture, it just got melted in the mouth.

COFFEE CAKE -it's perfect for coffee lovers as the flavour is induced in a cake,and the caramelised nuts present over it ,when comes in contact with ur tongue blends perfectly together.

CHOC SLICE - the cake was quite fluffy but lacked in moisture and the cream present on it complimented quite well with each other.

CAKES is definitely the best confectionary shop I have encountered-because of their products. It is a takeaway shop mainly. Also available for pre-orders. The chocolate is always of the purest quality and so yummy. Their variety is huge. The offer pastries, cakes, cupcakes, brownies, patties, gifting chocolates and many other things. Very suitable for ordering on occasions as customizatios can be made as you wish. We always order our birthday cakes from here. You can choose a variety of snacks-from veg or non-veg category. My personal favourite is their tarts-lemon tart and chocolate tart. I also love the Ganache Pastry, Nougat Slice and Truffle Slice.

Yesterday was my parent's wedding anniversary and thus without thinking of any other bakery I straight away headed to Cakes and got a cake for the occasion. Yes it is pricey as it costed me 580 bucks but when it comes to taste, a mouthful of their cake can sway you to another level. Got a chocolate cake. Simply superfine. Only one con that options are way too less, only two options I had, one for 400 and the other 580. Since the former looked very plain I opted for the second. Overall thank you Cakes yet again for keeping the taste same over the years.

I was coerced by a friend of mine to go to Cakes. He was so ga ga over Cakes' Ganache Pastry that I decided to give it a go. Cakes is located at many places over Kolkata, we visited the outlet in front of the Ekdalia Evergreen Durga Puja venue. It is a small outlet. The crowd in there gave a heads up about the popularity of Cakes. We ordered the famous Ganache Pastry and Moroccan Tart. Seriously, the ganache pastry was simply mindblowing. The Moroccan Tart had a crispy base with a great filling that was delicious. I highly recommend Cakes to all the food lovers.

It's a small place located near ekdalia club in gariahat, south kolkata. No sitting arrangements so take away is the only option. Menu was full with lots of items. Tried Special vanila cake and chocolate cake. Both items were delicious. Snacks are also available. Chicken lasagna was good. Prices are little bit high. Overall not bad.

They make the best chocolate based cakes and pastries in the city. Be it my daily morning pastry for breakfast or my birthday cake, I always get it from this place. The service is prompt and the place maintains a good level of hygeine.

All were very well made, they tasted pretty good. From the snacks section, I tried their chicken envelope, and tuna sandwich. They were pretty good too. The service is very good, the pricing is pretty okay for the quality of products they serve.

Be it sweet or savoury nothing can disappoint u here. The 1st time I ordered after my cousins recommendation was two chocolate cakes of 2lb each for my grand parents anniversary function . And that day I became a fan of it. It has that excess chocolate feel with a crunch inside. It was wonderful 
Post that I tried a lot of their stuff off and on .  Best part is they are a gud fill to your stomach. 
Had tried there 
1.Garlic bread 
2. Chocolate pie 
3. Chocolate boat
4. Brownie
5. Corn puff
6. Chicken envelop
7. Chicken burger

Cakes has always been my favourite place for birthday cakes and still now it tops my list. Recently we ordered this cake called as the Crunchy Praline..and this one will absolutely make you drool over it! With crunchy nuts and caramel crystals, this cake is pure love. At the Cakes outlets, you'll only get these in the form of pastries..we had to separately order for 1 pound of this cake. The cake looked BEAUTIFUL, and the message was very nicely written just the way we wanted! 
This beautiful piece of love came for 700 bucks which according to me was a pretty good deal.

One of the best cake shops in Kolkata I believe. It has class of its own. 

I have been visiting this place since long time, it being one of my favourite places. I have tried ganache pastry, fruit pastry and praline pastry countless times.

Yesterday, however, I wanted to try something else. I chose chicken cream roll. It was predictably served cold. And it was delicious, a beautiful mixture of chicken pieces and mayonnaise.

I purposefully did not give this outlet full marks because of the cold behaviour of the staff.

The price is at par with the quality.

Cakes has been one of the most seasoned confectionaries in Kolkata. The cakes they make are debauched and of predominant quality. The chocolate truffle cake specifically is great. It has a rich chocolate ganache with a delicate cake and caramelized nuts in the middle. Going to the cakes, the truffle cut, chocolate vessel, pineapple , all are an unquestionable requirement attempt. They have an assortment of flavorful snacks to offer too, for example, sandwiches, pizzas, quiches, puffs and burgers. I especially like their cheddar quiche and the chicken sandwich.

The presentation of chocolate and the lip smacking taste of the items easily are worth the price.
For this brand, one should just not think about calories while consuming it. Not every brand provides the same proposition like Cakes does

Cakes has always been synonymous with freshly baked and delicious savouries. This outlet near the ekdalia evergreen club came as a savior to us during the pujas. All of us were pretty hungry after a whole day of pandal hopping and thankfully even at about 8pm the place was well stocked. We tried a number of items - Chicken quiche , Chicken garlic puff, Vegetable patty, Hot dog, Chocolate chip cookie and pyramid. The puff tasted exceptionally good and was absolutely fresh. Chicken quiche had ample amount of chicken in it and was the best I have had so far. Pricing is very reasonable too. They also have a nice collection of cookies and breads. But I personally feel their savouries stand apart from others. I'm yet to try their Cakes. Will order soon :)

We went there on 'Panchomi' after visiting Ekdalia Evergreen Puja and had Egg Chicken Sandwich and Tuna Sandwich.
Both the sandwiches were delicious with enough stuffing inside them.And we had to pay only 100/- rupees for them.
This is such a place where you will get all the good quality cakes and savouries at an affordable price........

After having a word with Zomato folks, my review was taken down since the people at the shop was not aware of their listing on Zomato as well as the availability on online ordering. (There was a brawl before with the front office person and me). Apologies!

After receiving the mail from Zomato, I immediately ran down to the store and picked up some pastries, tarts and sandwiches for some honest reviewing.

The chocolate tart and mouse was really good, must say!
The chicken sandwich was good, didn't like the tuna sandwich really!

I would have given a 4 but well, none the less, my experience over the phone wasn't really pleasant.¬†
Please do let me know if you had the same experience while trying to chat up over the phone with the front desk person!

I was delighted when Cakes opened up in Gariahat years ago. No more did I need to trek to Loudon Street for the freshly baked goodies - top grade pastries and a handsome selection of savouries. This boutique bakery actually catered to the discerning pastry lover and did everything to satisfy them. 
As you enter, a distinct chocolatey aroma engulfs you. The pastries are excellent and they specialise in various kinds of chocolate pastries - The evergreen pyramid or blackforest, the regular brownie or a new brownie with a twist, the chocolate mousse or the mocha biscuit. They also have a good collection of breads, from the regular brown and whole wheat to masala and tomato. But before you dive into the pastries, do bite into their freshly made savouries 
Very few places serve the Tuna sandwich like Cakes does and it's a favourite on- the- go lunch. The chicken quiche and chicken- mushroom envelope are always a quick fill me up during a shopping break. The veg lovers can try their corn puff or veg quiche. Their selection of celebration cakes is praise worthy. Place an order 3 days in advance and they will make your celebration cake worth the wait.  Never been a fan of their chocolates but a box of freshly baked cookies is always welcome

Undoubtedly one of the prime bakeries in Kolkata, Cakes bakes desserts of a vigor which is unparallel to any other cake shop in Kolkata. Their collection of chocolatey bakes brings you sinful death out of sugargasm. The CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE CAKE is all things tempting and delectable.
I won't be doing justice if I don't take mention of the palmiers cookie, a great quick munch.

I, Somnath Sinha, hereby declare 'Cakes'  as the best confectionary shop in all of Kolkata and I swear it by the old gods and the new. I have never thought that this shop of 'Cakes' located near Ekdalia Evergreen Club in Gariahat will dethrone 'Kookie Jar' as my favorite confectionary. I went here today at 4. 30 p.m after visiting 'Agdum Bagdum'. The decor inside is more or less ordinary but you will be amazed at the huge variety of cakes  and pasttries inside. I ordered one Turkish Chicken Pizza first. This was a wrapped pizza which contained a good amount of chicken and veggies inside. It was tasty. Then I ordered one 'Ganache Pastry'. The pastry looked delicious. The moment I took the first bite I instantly had a foodgasm. It is the most delicious pastry that I have ever tasted. The chocolate coating outside, the chocolate cream with  chocolate chips inside and the chocolate shard on the top made it the best pastry that I have ever tasted. I wanted to buy each and every item after that. I will visit again and again till the end of time.

Let me confess that I am a CAKES freak :D
Whether its the Camac Street outlet, the Kasba outlet or this one, Cakes has always maintained its supremacy.
From the cakes section, I love their chocolate truffle cake, chocolate pyramid, chocolate cake, fudge cake and the ganache pastry.
I am also very fond of their corn puffs, chicken pizza slices, chicken turkish pizza and chicken mexican puff.
The chicken turkish pizza and ganache pastry tops the list when I in the mood for a quick bite.
Birthdays, anniversarys or any happy occasions are incomplete without the CAKES ka cake :)
Few days ago, I hopped into this outlet for sinister date with My Ganache Pastry.

If you know where Ekdalia Evergreen Puja is held, this place won't be hard for you to find out. A popular brand of confectionery, previously a part of Kookie Jar, now has their own identity but shares their menu with their parent brand. The offerings here are of higher quality and there are many, including me, who would not think more than once to shed a few more bucks and consume something better, when compared to the likes of Mio Amore and Kathleen. Had Chicken Sandwich and Ganache from here. An awesome combination, perfectly filled up my hungry appetite. Small chunks of chicken laid down in a sub, the Chicken Sandwich is probably one of the best selling items in all of the Cakes outlets combined. Pocket Pinch..? Absolutely negligible!

Conveniently located at ekdalia park just beside dominos,this little outlet of cakes packs a huge with their pastry items. As they good things come in small packages.

Well after a heavy lunch with my friends,we decided to have something sweet & hence we took the following among the varied spread:-

1. Chocolate nougart pastry- A slice of dark chocolate infused pastry with chocolate filling inside & crunchy caramel chips in between topped with a cherry slice. To simply put it was outstanding. The dark chocolate gave an enhanced taste & the bits of salty caramel provided an unique taste. Recommended item!!

2. Chocolate pyramid- This was also made up of dark chocolate but simple in taste. This item was also good in taste.

They have savoury items as well & also different kinds of bread loafs. Will be coming back again to try more of their varied items!!

Hands down the best place to visit for mouth watering pastries! And also the paradise for chocoholics like me. :P
I keep visiting this outlet when I'm loaded, because well, we all know cakes is pricey. :P
Today as I was roaming around Gariahat, my sudden chocolate craving was satiated as I entered this place.
Got myself a Chocolate Truffle pastry and Choco pyramid and I was left wanting for more. 
Amazing place. Always makes me happy!

Cakes is undoubtedly one of the best bakery on the city presently. I really love this brand and its worth a try if you have not tried already.
Starting from their birthday cakes to pastries to savories all are excellent in terms of quality. My experience with cakes has always been really good and tasty :)

This outlet of cakes in located at Gariahat near the Ekdalia Evergreen Club. Very popular and a small sized one. Went to grab a birthday cake for an occasion and got one of the favorite one. It was fresh and tasted divine.Good one indeed.

This outlet of Cakes is located exactly in the location where the Ekdalia pujo is held, so people who do not have much idea about which street goes where around Gariahat, this should help. 

Cakes, is without a doubt the one of the best bakeries in the city and falls amongst the legendary top circle of confectioners. It produces a great accumulation of chocolate cakes and other savory products. 
¬†My staple choice, whenever I walk into any of the Cake outlets is the Ganache Pastry, I am just absolutely and overly in love with it. I also feel undying affection for the- truffle cakes, the chocolate pyramid, Chicken pasta, CHICKEN QUICHE, Nougat slice and finally THE MOUSSE CAKE.

I would also love it if the management took orders for white chocolate cakes. Something like a white chocolate and raspberry cake will be divine.

Cakes - Although, the outlet at Rawdon Street, is my favorite, but the taste of pastries and its softness remain the same. I love the pyramid. Reasonably priced and delectable. With due respect, it beats Kookie Jar and Mio Amore. There is a showpiece of a monkey , made of coconut shell just above the cash counter. I like it, too. :D

This Cakes outlet is located close to¬†the Ekdalia Evergreen Club, near Gariahat. It is not a big outlet, there is no seating area, staff is neither attentive nor polite enough. That apart, it serves the best cakes I have had so far. My rating is entirely due to their cakes which are delicious! Try their chocolate ganache pastry, choco nougat slice and the crunchy praline pastry-creamy, buttery, chocolatey delight! The brownies are good too and so are the black forest pastries.¬†
For my sister's birthday, I bought a double truffle cake from here and it was yum :) ¬†Cakes uses good ingredients for all their products and it shows. The veg/ chicken/ chicken-egg sandwiches and the chicken quiches are nice too.
Looking forward to my next visit.

What can I say! They are undoubtedly the best cake-maker in the city. Be it any occassion or not, you just can't ignore their presence. Been multiple times there.... this time jolting it down. I bought the "Choco Truffle Ring" Cake for my cousin's birthday. A perfect thing to make an event special. It melts as soon as you put it in your mouth. No question should be raised about the quality. If you want an eggless option they can provide you with that too. Go with friends or family, grab some super delicious pastries. You can't leave without longing for more.

This cake outlet is situated in Ekdalia Road,near to the Gariahat xing. It's quite a popular place and crowded most times because of the location and the deliciously sinful cakes,pastries,souffles and savouries. Being part of a chain their items are the same here as elsewhere. Good place to go to if you crave a pastry or even a savoury tart. YUM.

This is the only cakes outlet in this part of the city, and that does account for its popularity. Another thing that reasons is its fantastic collection of cakes. 
Nearly all the chocolate preparations are equally well made, with the quality of chocolate offered being splendid. They draw all the attention away from the fried preparations which are pretty good in their respect. 
However, my personal favourite would be the lemon tart, whose exclusivity here is apparent from its great taste. 
The shop is well maintained and cleaned regularly. The people are nice, and everything together makes for a good experience.

Absolutely sinful and drop dead delicious are the only attributes I can think of when I speak about eatables available in all the outlets of this chain. They also have great breads and loaves. The Gariahat outlet is all the more special for me as I am a regular there since my school days which is just in the neighbourhood and also they made me the most cute and yummy birthday cake about a year back. I am sure I am going to visit them yet another innumerable number of times.ÔÅä

This outlet of Cakes is very close to my school and I have fond memories of coming here everyday after school and gorging on those gorgeously delicious Pyramids and Swiss Rolls. It's hard to find a bakery as affordable as Cakes who also happen to make the best quality cakes and puffs. Usually quality is compromised on most occasions when the prices are this low. But not with Cakes. In here,  taste, quality and affordability goes hand in hand and this is what makes Cakes one of my most favourite bakeries in Calcutta. 
Recommended eats:- Pyramid Pastries, Eclaire s, Swiss rolls, Chicken Roll and their puffs.

I frequent this place more or less once a week for my evening snacking.

I love their Chocolate Ganache pastry- its like a small gift of chocolate made personally for you! One can also try their tarts, mousse, pineapple pastry- with ample amount of fresh cream and pineapple slices & chocolate pyramid.

Chocolate truffle cakes is my special go to cake and I usually order that for any occasion!

For the savoury part- I always remain confused as all of them are so yummy, but my personal favourites are chicken parcel & chicken sandwich!

One should most definitely try out cakes!

The cake is beautifully decorated and topped with cherries and it tasted even better than it looked. Last year on my father's birthday i chose their chocolate fudge cake which is too dry but tasted great . Overall i loved their cakes . Their pastries and brown bread sandwiches are good so is their chicken quiche (which i ate long time ago and i don't know if it's still available).
They also have 3lb cakes in their showcase so if you forget to order prior you can always find them here.

After kookiejar the second best place to have cakes,pastries and patties is Cakes. This is the second outlet which was opened in the city , the first being the louden street shop next to kookiejar. 
The menu is the same of kookiejar but it is priced a bit lower than that of kookiejar. 
Black Forest and pineapple slice and macaroons tarts r great here along with chicken and mushroom patties . U should also try their breads which r sold by the loaf. Masala bread and cheese bread is quite good.

I love each and every item on their menu, be it the Chocolatr Ganache or the Choco boats or the truffle cakes. My birthday cake every year inevitably is from Cakes! The Chicken Egg Sandwich is also very fresh and light with a unique taste. The pastries and sandwiches are loaded with flavour which melt in your mouth. For all the people out there with a sweet tooth, a visit to CAKES is a must!

Cakes is one of the leading confectionery in Kolkata having many outlets all around the city. This one is located in Ekdalia, very near to South Point school. 
Their signatures pastries like chocolate boat,chocolate mousse, nut corner, Black Forest pastries etc though obviously good in taste and quality, I personally don't think they are the best in town for sure. Also since many years they have been serving the same old pastries, seldom I have seen anything new in here. The must try item surely would be the vegetarian and non vegetarian pizzas, oozing with mouth melting mozzarella cheese,obviously if served fresh, which sometimes they don't. The bread collection is worth mentioning from white to brown to multi grain they have it all and is always well stocked. The only problem would be their staff, they are a little rude and can't seem to manage if the place gets crowded, which it does because it's a tiny shop and even if five to six people enter the shop there's hardly any space to stand. The staff usually seems confused and a little lazy, the pace at which they move from behind the counter to the micro oven is worth mentioning and should be sent to Guinness book of world records for the slowest walk on this planet.
The location of this shop is its prime advantage and I feel they just take their customers for granted. I personally don't think their pastries or other baked items are the best in town (you will obviously find better ones ) but in case you disagree please feel free to visit this outlet.

It is indeed one of the best! I have not visited it in a long time and now I am tempted to!!! I cannot wait! I miss it so much! Oh I miss my school days, I could go any time I wanted when I was returning from my school! Nostalgia! Nice to know Cakes always stands there with its doors open for me to relive my childhood and forget my diet!

Cakes are no doubt one of the best confectioners of kolkata.

But they need to take a little precautions during preparation in regards to hygiene.

I purchased 6 pieces of the same category of pastries. In one of those a strand of hair was found. I had to throw away the whole lot.

The matter was conveyed to one Mr Dutta, who was in cash, on the same evening.¬†

So one is to be careful while purchasing.

Cakes is no doubt one of the best confectioners of kolkata. Their lemon tarts are the best and the Ganache pastry is to die for. The croissants and the chocolate eclair are also very well made and a must try :)
I also strongly recommend this place for birthday cakes, ( you wont be disappointed).¬†
Service is cordial and quick and all this comes in a very pocket friendly pricing

Invisible just beside the ekdaliya evergreen park. Small shop but very experienced in bakery. I love the eggless truffle which has a regular order from my office on any celebration. It is very soft and the chocolate is seductive. If you don't worry about calories it is a must try.

Cakes for me is the best confectioner in town in terms of quality,consistency and price all taken together.This outlet located near Ekdalia Club at Gariahat being the closest to my place is the one most frequented by me.

I am a huge fan of most of the products.The lemon tart is my favorite.It is absolutely brilliant.The chocolate based cakes truffle,ganache,pudding,black forest etc are all consistently good and fresh.I have taken birthday cakes for various friends from here and never been disappointed.

Among the savories the Chicken and egg sandwich,the chicken quiche are the ones I particularly like.They also have a wide range of fresh breads available.

The service is nice and swift.The outlet is busy at most times like all other cakes outlets.The prices are a little on the higher side but the quality justifies the price tag.

All in all Cakes is my favourite. Be it a Birthday cake or a quick bite or a sweet craving Cakes has the answer to it all.

Fast food is also very good quality that also you can try all of them. It's location is very good, car parking is also available infront of the shop.

Cakes as the name suggests, is a bakery joint that deals in all kinds of delicious pastries, truffles, tarts, cakes, brownies, pudding and what not. This particular outlet of Cakes is located near the Ekdalia Crossing, Gariahat and is always crowded like anything. Even when it is just opened, the store is very crowded.

Apart from desserts, Cakes also deals in some nice and yummy savories such as cold sandwiches, puffs, patties, quiche, hot dog and many more. The Chicken & Egg Sandwich is the best, it has mashed Chicken in a lot of mayo and cheese which tastes great. It is also available in submarine sandwich (Subway like sandwich) variant.

Since Cakes is a complete bakery, it also deals in breads and cookies. Breads such as Milk Bread, Cheese Bread and Pizza Bread are easily available in this outlet.

One thing which I never understood about Cakes is their uneven distribution of stuff, for example this outlet of Cakes has many items which I would never see in other outlets (especially in Kasba outlet). I think this may be due to the size of this outlet.

Service is okay but at times a little lazy and you will have to wait for some time as there is a huge rush in this outlet anytime you enter.

So, all and all a highly recommended outlet of Cakes and an all-round solution for cakes and pastries. It is also recommended for birthday and other occasions (for cakes).

The place is actually, way better than similar shops like Sugar & Spice, Monginis, etc. The items are different and food is delicious. I've got special preference for the chicken wrap or something like that ( Don't remember the name but it looks like a wrap and tastes a bit like shwarma) and the corn puff.

Second review: After almost one year i visited this joint to have some cakes. I and my friend went there in the evening. We had chocolate cup cake, nut corner and butterscotch roll. Cupcake was over baked and became dry. Butterscotch roll was good and fresh. Nut corner was full of nuts and raisins and excessively sweetened as a result after 2-3 bites you won't feel like eating it. So, i had to cut some points.


After a long period time visited this bakery with my friend . A fine morning having nothing to do we went to this joint. Since i was so overwhelmed, i wanted to taste almost all items but realising that i couldn't have all we restricted our order to egg chicken sandwich, mixed fruit pudding and chocolate cup cake. All the items taste really good specially the pudding decorated with Kiwi,plum, cherry and fresh cream. Price is quite high but worth it.. One visit is must for cake and pastry lovers..

This Particular Cake Shop can be a Instituition Itself at Customer Srevice. The Staff Specially Mr. Arup goes out of the way to make his customers comfortable. Be it any function in my family...Cake from CAKES' is must. I just love they way they incorporate Customized cakes...and trust me taste of the cake is beautiful as its design. I am specially a huge fan of their Butterscotch Swiss Roll and BlackForest Cake. Their Fruit Pudding is delight for every human being alive and should be tasted once atleast in a lifetime. I love their huge options in Savouries. Mushroom and Chicken envelop and Chicken or Veg Quiche tops the chart for me. When I was in South Point Junior School My Stap Father used to often treat me to their Egg and Chicken Sandwich which is a way of my remembering those good moments spent with him. Even their veg Sandwich is a mouthfull and i just love the concoction of simple and fresh veggies with classic mayoneise.¬†

I had once heard Stephen Fry say that when women eat chocolate, their eyes go dreamy and their thighs clamp together or something along these lines. I can honestly say that some of the confections available at Cakes do make me act that way.

First of all, I am tired of low-end/mid-range bakeries selling dark and glossy looking chocolate cakes which, on the first bite, makes you feel like you have contracted diabetes. After trying one to many chocolate cakes that have sugary, more cocoa than pure chocolate icing, the rich chocolate filling/frosting of Cakes tastes like something else entirely. Of course there are great bakeries in Kolkata, but none of them are as affordable as Cakes. For reasonable price, you get great quality. The chocolate mud pie and praline pastry are just amazing. And the ganache pastry... The thin layers of cake, sandwiching smooth chocolate buttercream and chopped praline, coated in a thick, fudgy layer of chocolate ganache...Oh my... *eyes glaze over and thighs clamp together* :P

But I do have a bone to pick with them. The trays of the cakes and pastries sit on chilled shelves and as a result a bit of moisture condenses on the trays. This is not a problem for the pies and some of the cakes that are placed on individual cake rounds. But some of the cakes are kept on paper cases and these get their bottoms soaked. In fact, the chocolate eclair had a soggy bottom and just ruined the taste and texture of the choux pastry. And this is not just a coincidence, I saw this in both the New Alipore and Gariahat outlets. I really hope they solve this problem. For the uninitiated, a wet bottomed eclair may well turn out to be the first and last thing they have at Cakes.

P.S.: I tried the chocolate pudding, and a word to the wise, do not try this unless you're really curious or have a penchant for watery pudding because that's exactly what it is. I can still taste the soupy bottom and the soggy middle of the pudding. The whipped cream was so bland. When I complained, the manager/cashier said that 'fresh cream is like that'. First off, it is not fresh cream, it is whipped cream and secondly no cream separates into water.

Cakes is the only name that comes to my mind  when I'm craving for a chocolate pastry or chocolate cake. I have been a regular to cakes for the past 7-8 years and their cakes have never disappointed me. It originally came up as a substitute to Kookie Jar, offering the same cakes, pastries, tarts and savouries at a somewhat lower price point. I guess Cakes dnt enjoy that price advantage any longer, coz it has become quite expensive. 
But leaving aside the bad bits, all the pastries and cakes here taste good. The chocolate ganache is any chocolate-lovers delight. Rich, dark chocolate with nuts......it cannot get better than this. The praline pastry is another favourite and offers quite a "crunch" for the price. Among the cakes, the black forest, normal chocolate and trufle cake are delightful. The chocolate excel cake is simply marvellous. They offer a variety of fruit custards or soufles, but I havent tried much of these. However, I do enjoy the lemon Swiss roll. 
Among the savouries, my favorite are the chicken quiche and the chicken envelope. Btw.....they were one of the first people to introduce Kolkata to shawarmas.

I am in complete love wid their lemon tarts and macaroons....love their other bakery products. Cakes are simply too gud.... since these days people watch lots of cook shows on tv and are also well travelled, they come across lots of delicacies which are not quite available everywhere. But thanks to cakes you can now get tarts and macaroons nearby your place. The price is also good so whenever you want to indulge into your sweet cravings you can easily do that without the pocket pinch.

I loved this shop since my childhood days when I used to have their items specially with my family During Puja days at Ekdalia. It is a small shop but its rich aroma and taste have satisfied my tummy and taste buds quite well. Mainly I love their rich pastries, be it  Chocolate Pyramid, Chocolate Swiss role, Black forest pastries or Chocolate brownie, I am just a big fan of their food joint. And yes, try to have bite of Chocolate Ganache Pastry , its simply out of the world, rich chocolate and its aroma have made it succulent. 
I have also tried their several snacks items like chicken spicy puff, hot dog etc and they are of good taste and yes , I am planning to taste their bread items on my subsequent visits.

Variety? Check. Aroma? Check. Taste? Check. Quality? Check. Affordability? Check. 
Enter Cakes, the one place where you can enjoy a hearty and delicious meal at well under INR 100. And boy, are you getting value for money! The range of items here is quite wide, but not humongous enough to become confusing - just the way I like it. I've tried the chicken and veggie pizzas, the chicken corn puff, the chicken tikka puff, the chocolate swiss roll, the chocolate pyramid, the lemon and chocolate tarts, the jam biscuits, the chocolate slice, the plain bun, the garlic bread, the marble cake and 1lb chocolate cake...and I have nothing but praise for each and every item. This is my go-to place for birthday cakes and delicious snacks. 
Full marks and more from me.

Breads!
Ambience: It's more of a takeaway shop, even 6 people on this side of the counter can make it crowded. But yes, for the famished and starving there are a couple of stools. The decor is warm and nice. The big well-lit display glasses with all the delicious goodies serve their purpose well...that is to make your mouth water! The savoury items are placed in bamboo baskets on a rack on the wall opposite to the entrance. Basically this arrangement is to help you select your order, but I somehow get lost among all the delicious food items, displayed in their full splendour, and end up taking ages to decide on something! My bad really.
Service: The service is prompt and the guys behind the counters are patient all through your selection process. :P
Food: Delicious! I am in love with their Tomato Bread which at just 60 bucks is a steal! I love their pastries and savouries as well and tend to bulk buy them as a takeaway!
Recommendation: Yeah I know once you are here you'll want to try almost everything but make sure you take a Tomato Bread home with you just once and I know you'll come back for it again...ohh crap that is a bad idea! They run out of Tomato breads by 6/7 so I've gotta reach there before you guys do!
LOL :)

I love this cake shop. This particular outlet is close to where i live and hence i keep dropping in. Almost all the cakes are delicious, particularly the chocolate truffle cakes. The Ganache is also quite good. from the savory part of the spread, the chicken shawarma is my favorite. I believe its the best shawarma you get in this city. The chicken egg sandwiches are also good.  another fav is the nutwedge.
 Its the cake shop i keep going back to for birthday cakes, for quick bites and when my sweet tooth takes the better of me.

Memories of school days flash inside my mind when I think of this place. I am a regular here from the time the price of choco ganache was only 30 bucks. Now it has increased many folds, but still it remains an awesome pastry and still makes me salivate. The fine crunches, the soft cream and the smoothness of this pastry is just brilliant.  Now you need to spend at least 150 bucks to make your stomach full, but during my final school years with just 50 bucks to spend on food, this used to be a common destination for us. The shwarma is still as delectable as before and to be very honest, unlike other places, Cakes has not compromised on quality, even a bit in the years of inflation. The prices have sky rocketed but that is only very obvious. This is one of the finest bakeries in town and their cakes and pastries can put even the most cavil persons into a never ending search for errors but not hitting upon one. I have more or less tried everything that they offer and have liked every single item, be it the chicken quiche, chicken burger, egg and chicken sandwich. Cakes truly reflects top notch quality.  I Don't have anything to criticize about Cakes and hence no marks to deduct. A perfect 5.

Yummylicious (I know there's no such word in English dictionary you stupid auto-correct, but I'll use it anyway ) Cakes !! Although, I have visited this shop hardly twice in my life, I have had food/cakes from this shop a number of times at several parties. Cakes are super awesome are far better than the typical ones that you get at your next door Monginis/Kathleen/Sugar & Spice et all. Cookie Jar comes close, but I would still rate cakes from Cakes higher than those from Cookie Jar. Highly recommended, though I would prefer a takeaway from this outlet, since it's quite small and remains crowded most of the time.

So be it the Chicken Tikka or the Pineapple Slice... it's such a delight to sink in my teeth. And there are 2 SPECIAL items why love this place.... the Chicken Shwarma and the Tuna Sandwich. These two are so yummy and heavy that I often have them during lunch or dinner hours. Doesn't matter at all.... can live on them for my entire life.

During my stay in Phari my friends gave me a surprise on my birthday in the midnight with a fabulous chocolate cake from Cakes! That's when I fell in love with Cakes. The cake is so soft, it tends to melt in the mouth after each bite. The only negative is that they serve snacks on tissue and charge extra for plates!

The fare availabale may be excellent but the service of this shop is appallling. apparently, they serve anything that you want to eat in store on tissues only. The explanation given rather highhandedly by the staff is that if they keep plates, they have to pay extra tax.

This is the first time I am seeing a food shop doing this, and they proudly say they have been doing it for fifteen years. I wonder if the owners also do not keep plates in their houses as that will save money on the maid cost, the cost of the washing soap, use less water...Do get your basics right before you open a shop...

I love my cakes and pastries and sandwiches and I love Cakes !! Very close to my school, we were regulars to this place. It may still be moderately expensive but you have to see that they give you quality. Recently had the Turkish Chicken Pizza and it was an instant hit. Other things which I really love are the Chicken Sandwich and the Chicken Quiche. The Shawarma here is the only one I ever really liked and I have tried it from a lot of places. But, the one thing which is the star is the Chocolate Ganache Pastry. Smooth, soft and heavenly. Just heavenly. I have also got a lot of birthday cakes for friends' birthdays and they were always top draw. 

Love Cakes. Pure quality.

It's a cake shop-  not a cheap one and not of big repute like the french loaf . But I do love their offerings quite a bit . Its like if I go with my wife for her Gariahat shopping,I am allowed to visit Cakes:)
At first, few years back when we were younger we frequented this place as it was often full of good looking girls, after that it was for their Eclairs and now it is for quite a few items-  thanks to my growing sweet tooth.  

Cons : very small shop with little standing space even . 
The staff will ignore you (a guy) over housewives who probably will outbuy you every time :)

Since its near Gariahat and South point schools, place happens to be crowded most of the time! The staff members are pretty friendly, and they know my favourites by this time! I love their Lemon tart, Jam ring, Nut Corner,Double decker....list goes on. Their ganache is absolutely sinful! For snacking the have sandwiches and quiches etc! I love their veg sandwich, tuna sandwich and shawarma! Please visit! :)

Another ideal place for having pastries,desserts and sandwiches. Ambiance is fine and serving is pretty well. Very frequently i visit there and mostly have chocolate pastry and pasta. The sad thing for me is that the pasta is now currently unavailable and price is also reasonable. Cakes are just mind-blowing followed by other stuffs. The biscuits with cartoon drawn i have too. Those biscuits are luscious and birthday cakes also i order from there. During pujas it remains crowded cause Ekdalia Evergreen Club is just held beside that. 4 stars for it. Folks,you can try to have pastries here as u will fall in love with them. (LIKINGS DIFFER)
