Foods here are awesome..they totally know how to cook great food. The best is always Mutton biryani And Ramzan special mutton Haleem. On desserts, firni is the one..

Chownringee square street in esplanade where you get to taste all sorts of traditional biriyani at dirt cheap prices ranging from the famous alamir & other small hotels, jannat restaurant also comes in such category of diner where you get to taste traditional mughlai food at pocket friendly prices. 

This is located at the end of the biriyani street. The place is spacious enough to accommodate good amount of customers in peak lunch/dinner hours. We went there for our lunch & took the following:-

1. Butter naan - 1 butter naan comes in a huge size divided in 2 with adequate coating of butter over it. The naan was soft & the dough was just perfect.

2. Chicken reshmi butter masala - 5 pcs pieces of tender reshmi kebabs coated in super delicious gravy with butter. The gravy just blew us away with its flavours. Very subtle & rustic. We kept on licking our fingers as we took a dip of it everytime with our naans. Highly recommended!!

3. Half chicken tandoori - 2 decently sized charred tandoori served with pickled onions & a magical chutney. The pickled onion & the chutney deserves special mention since those 2 condiments where the star of the dish. The chicken were charred to perfection & chicken were also nicely cooked.

4. Firni - A mughlai meal is just incomplete with a firni. The firni was rather a disappointment since it was too dense & too dry.

The pocket pinch is on the lower side with the total bill coming to 430 for 2. No additional taxes are charged. The service was super fast & the staff are very courteous.
