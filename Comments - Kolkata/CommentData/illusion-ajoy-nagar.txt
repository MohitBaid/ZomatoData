Not sure why it's rated so low. 
Pretty good food I'd say. We had some starters, very basic. Chilly baby corn which was really crispy and gold fried pawns which pretty damn good. And some noodles with chilly chicken. All of it was quite nice and tasty I'd say. Ambience is also pretty cool if you're looking for a restro pub feel. Efficient staff and service. I'd recommend this place for the Chinese they serve.

Please zomato dont make your name bad by sponsoring this type of clubs. They are allowing underage girls and boys. And the black tie entertainment is doing all this stuffs in each every party. Fake promises!! No hookah!! Playing with future of underage girls and boys is illegal in India. If needed I will go to consumet forum. The host Hassane parvez is also helping small kids to make fake id's and make business with it. I will also complain to nearest police station about this and they make me banned due to the previous review I made with my another account. That guy hassane parvez is forcing me to edit the review.

I could have given 4 stars to this pub. Everything is fine- fooding, ambience, etc. apart from one person MR.RAJA. Probably two weeks back me along with my husband and his friends visited this place, when we were entering we heard this person saying utter nonsense to the girls who were standing just infront of the entry gate. He was so damn desperate that he openly said to those girls that if they agree to what he says then he will give them entry. Being a girl I was just shocked to hear that from a staff of a well known pub. It was just unexpected. And one more thing I would like to clear it out that when the party was getting over I along with my mates saw that person dancing with those girls. It was really surprising to see such behaviour from a staff. Anyway, I would like to visit here further in future days and hope to see something good n better this time from the staffs. Last but ofcourse not the least Illusion Lounge is such a good place to chill!!!

Bad food quality. Drinks were way too expensive. High Price. Cheap crowd. Music kept on repeating, just so disgusting! Not gonna visit this place again.
