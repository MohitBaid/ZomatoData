Today, I ordered egg chicken roll as evening snacks. It's a roadside small restaurant. So, my expectation was not that high. But, unfortunately the egg chicken roll didn't even meet my expectation. The roll was just pathetic. Salt was very less in the chicken. Actually it does not make you get that spicy feel in your test bud, rather it feels like you are eating partha with inlet and some spiceless chicken.

Pathetic food.. Today we ordered Paneer butter masala,rice,chicken kasha,laccha paratha,kheer kadam. Paneer butter masala was 75% submerged in oil which i am prety sure anyone will die after eating that. Chicken gravy was dark blackish.So disgusting that you will never at chicken after eating that. Laccha paratha are like locally available Rs3 paratha too oily and hard. Kheer kadam these are just 2  Rs5 sweets which cost Rs. 40.Only the name is fancy. Considering other items quality i simply threw it. The pack was dirty too.

So guys never ever order from here if you really care about your family or friends health. Pay some extra but surely go for better restaurants. I don't know how zomato allowed such restaurant. So do they really validate before on-boarding any restaurant????

After reading some review in zomato, I decided to order from this restaurant. I ordered 1 veg manchow soup, 1 crispy chilly potato and 1 chicken fried momo. I was very hungry and was waiting for food like anything. But guess what when I finally received the order, the moment when I opened the package it was like a nightmare. I really want to suggest you guys to Google what is manchow soup and check in YouTube how to prepare it and same goes with chilly potato. Chilly potato which I received was nothing more than a desi version of French fries. Coming to the momos it was equally awful. I had to throw all of it in trashcan. The only good thing about this restaurant was the delivery boy, he was very courteous. That's all. I will never ever order from this place again.

Ordered their food via zomato. I have tried there "Non-veg Hot and Sour Soup", "Veg Hot Gerlic Rice" and "Chicken 65". Everything tasted nice. Specially the hot gerlic rice was awsome. After a long time I have tasted such a rice preparation which itself is so tasty that no other side dish was required with it. It was a really mouthwatering item. This place is really a hidden gem of Kestopur.

Fish kobiraji it was like a budget food - more fillers and small amount of fish, hey come-on what do you expect for rs 50??

And a chicken pakoda that was also ok.

It is a street food experience dont compare with restaurants.

Placed next to SBI ATM, Majherpara - Kestopur.

A small eatery; good place if you want to have good food on the go. It is home to some of the most appreciated cuisines.

The place is really good in terms of food, but has no seating space . 
They have some chairs/stools provided outside the eatery if you want to sit there and eat. 

They make really good at Chinese.
Apart , the Garlic Fish, Honey Lemon Chicken and the Garlic Chicken are must try items. They do have some good breakfast options too.

Pricing is reasonable and so is quantity. Preferable for takeaway.
Bala Kitchen makes sure one has a great food experience by offering highly palatable food !!

This is my second time eating from Bala kitchen. This review is based on a home delivery through Zomato. I did not see or visit Bala kitchen in person. This restaurant is very very reasonably priced. It got delicious food and the delivery of the food is usually before the estimated time. Today we ordered for mushroom fried rice, egg roll, double chicken roll and onion salad. All of this costed around rs190 but zomato promotes 10% discount so it costed us only rs180. All the people who stays in Kestopur or nearby, if you're low on budget then order from here. Not only you get cheap food but its good too.

Well, I love this place. Very small and mainly takeaway outlet but a lot of options. They almost serve all the items they have in their menu. So, far I have tried their rolls,noodles,momo,fried rice,cutlet, fish fry and few other options and in my opinion they taste decent. I love their fried rice , particularly chili garlic rice. A must try. And these guys are so friendly and humble you will enjoy. If you need some item customized (like you need less/more spicy, you dont like garlic/red chili) , just tell them and they will prepare the dish separately for you. I am a frequent visitor.

A great place to have snacks with egg roll or egg veg roll (try this please) or momos. Well last time I ordered paratha, chilli mushroom dry, hot garlic chicken and egg-chicken fried rice from Bala kitchen. Must say I was amazed by the mushroom. Never had such a great mushroom chilli. The rice was good as well. But the thing that disappointed me was the use of red chilly in the garlic chicken. Red chilly is not good for health and I didnt like its use in the chicken. I didnt find The chicken tasty but the rest of the food was good.

From breakfast to dinner.. U can get every cuisine here.. It opens at 8 am morning and closes arnd 11pm night... Indian,  Chinese are available here.. For breakfast they prepare parathas which are good for stuffing ur hunger.. I have tried many dishes here.. All are okay.. Nothing extraordinary...the place doesn't have place to sit.. So best option is to take away.. The behavior of the staffs are very polite and friendly.. It advised to try Chinese rather than indian here..
