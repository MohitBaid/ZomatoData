After a good meal at the 6BP outlet of Acropolis Mall we headed staright for some ice cream at this place. Took a double scoop of Butterscotch icecream and it is just okay. Lacked the actual taste of butterscotch. Dont know if we made the wrong choice. Not sure if i would give it another try

Located at a corner, right next to KFC. It's a bit difficult to locate. Not much variety of ice cream available, have only 8  - 10 flavours on any given day. Make your selection wisely. Some of the flavours do taste really good.
Pricing is similar to any other ice cream parlour.

Searching for quality ice cream in the mall, situated in the Acropolis Mall, this is the perfect outlet for you. The various cup shapes, ranging from child to adult, will make you feel child again! Price is comparatively high.

Stopped at this kiosk located right beside KFC after having dinner with friends at Hoppipola and we all were craving for some deserts to give ourselves a  sweet tooth.

As always we wanted to check the reviews on Zomato before trying any new stuff and we saw recent negative reviews about the staff and how they push you hard for add-ons to increase the bill value, 

What we found was that the staff were supper curtious and very patient to make us try all the flavours we wanted to try even when the kiosk looked little busy dispite that to make us aware of all their ingredients and prices and to give time was really sweet. We Tried few flavour and found Butter scotch caramel cake, Cho hazelnut, Rich belgian Cho and strawberry cheese cake were all amazing.

Must say over here we all went in with a different perception as per the old reviews and left with a very pleasant and humbling experience. 


Would love to visit again

This small outlet of gelato vinto is located in the Acropolis Mall food court. They offer a variety of flavoured ice creams. But the staffs are just want to increase the bill value. Prices are on higher side. But the service is not so good.

This small outlet of gelato vinto is situated in Acropolis Mall foodcourt. They offer a variety of flavoured pure-veg ice-creams. We tried the strawberry cheesecake one in a cup. It was good in taste and their chocolate ice-cream in a crunchy cone was also good.

But, what is offending is that they insist on trying or adding more elements and scoops of ice-creams just to increase the amount in the bill. This kind of behavior is strictly unprofessional. 

Overall a good kiosk to try different flavours of ice-creams and the price range is varying but if you want to have a good proportion of ice-cream then prices are on the higher side.

Just rubbish.
The staffs are such that they just want to increase the bill value.
Asked for a mixture of two scoops with choco chips,strawberry sauce and chocolate sauce.
What the served is a scoop of bitter tasted belgium chocolate icecream,it was the worst one.A scoop of caramel or some thing that turned to be the saviour for my bill and ONE TEA SPOON of some chocolate crust or something,which was anything but not at all choco chips.
They didnt had strawberry sauce and choco chips.Yet they fooled me that those wont taste good in this.
Moreover,both the scoops were not mixed at all.Yet the fooled me at 1st that they will mix it.
In short,I will never visit such a fake ice cream parlour.
Staffs are just horrible.
They again fooled me saying cards are accepted.but to pay them,i had to go to the food court cash counter and wait for 5mins.they do not have any way of accepting cash or cards except foodcourt cards.
They just lied.
Shame on you guys.
Such high prices,yet such worst service.

Just not worth the price. All the chocolate flavours taste the same, they just put a different name and charge a higher price. The so called wild berry is basically vanilla ice cream with a tart jam. Might as well visit baskin robbins. They serve larger portions and the icecream is creamier. Highly annoyed with the visit. Would never recommend or visit again.

Tried gelato from this kiosk located inside the food court of the Acropolis mall. They have good diversity of flavours and I found the gelatos to be fresh and nice.
Tried the butterscotch on a cone and liked the flavour. Though it should have some sauce to go with too.
The chocolate fudge in a small cup was delicious. It was dense and creamy. 
The prices are okay, though some flavours are pretty expensive here.
Overall a nice try at the food court.

It was so yummy  , it is not so crowded maybe because of price but the icecream was truly superb , i ordered for 2 scoops of 2 flavours strawberry cheese cake and dark belgian chocolate with wafers and toppings . The strawberry cheese cake was a bit sour on top due to strawberry jelly but otherwise we could feel the cheese cake inside and that too in a icecream , it was really good , the chocolate scoop was a bit bitter but it was also good . Overall a good experience at gelato vinto located just beside kfc

The Wild Berry flavour and Coffee and Brownie combo flavours are fabulous. Wild berry has to be this unique taste that I've never felt before. Their Gelato is a 100% vegetarian and 96% fat free. And if I were to believe their advertising then this little ice cream stall at Acropolis Mall could be your answer to really healthy and tasty dessert. Delicious!

Though I love all the chocolate flavours,
My absolute favourite is chocolate fudge cake ice cream . The chunks of chocolates feels heavenly in the dark chocolate base.
They have sugar free ice creams as well.

This new ice-cream parlour which goes by the name of Gelato Vinto is located in the food court of Acropolis Mall just beside KFC. We went here today after having a sizzler from Wow! Momo. We were looking for some good dessert options and my eyes fell on this shop. The ice-cream over here are color coded i.e yellow coded ice-cream has a specific price whereas pink and orange colored ones have different prices. We went for one large cup of the 'Chocolate Red Velvet' ice-cream. It was made with chocolate ice-cream and red velvet cake along with chocolate chips. This dessert item was sinfully delicious. We will definitely go here again.

Generally I don't take chocolate ice creams. I tried the Milk Belgian Chocolate from this outlet at Acropolis Mall yesterday night. Somewhat I liked it. The gelato wasn't very creamy still liked the taste of the chocolate. That is it. Couldn't take pictures of the ice cream because it got eaten over long before I got my hands into the bowl. My sisters dug into it. I am definitely going to hit back this place again. Until then, please wait for the pictures. Happy Dining! :)

Gelato Vinto as the name says is a gelato shop located right beside KFC, Acropolis Mall. The staff here is polite. They make it a point that they get the right flavour for your taste palette. I found the ice cream choices in this place to be of a large variety however they fell short when it came to flavours. 

I had ordered their Vanilla Ice Cream Milkshake. The milkshake was neither heavy nor creamy enough for my taste. I had very little hints of vanilla. It was
watery and the flavours didn't seem to come through.

Although this joint has lots of positives, like hygiene, fast service, it somewhere failed to deliver what I originally came for, which was the food. Gelato Vinto, until we meet again, it's going to stay a three from my side. Cheers!

Tucked inside at a corner of the food court in "Acropolis" mall, there is a small kiosk just beside the KFC outlet, named "Gelato Vinto", serves delicious gelato that any dessert lover will love to grab. In fact, the wide range of multicolored gelato visible from the glass  of the shelf, itsef triggers a dopamine punch, that immediately generates an impulse to walk in and dig in to some melodious notes of mesmerizing flavors, that touches each of your taste buds with a mellifluous note of fantasy.
A very good place to try out some delicious gelato.

Tried this outlet last week and I loved the belgian chocolate flavor along with the ferrero rocher flavor. Price is okay and at par with the dollops they serve. This rating is based only on the ice cream I ate.
Thumbs down for the rude staff (the oldie had a bad temper). They refused to make us taste the various flavors available and said "I can't make you taste all, just choose what you want to!" Shocking, isn't it? Absolutely hated these guys and definitely not visiting this place ever again.

Another gelato outlet in the city and the second ice cream parlor in acropolis mall.

#Location: Acropolis Mall food court, beside KFC.

#Service: Even though when I went the kiosk was busy, service was good.

#Ambiance: This is a small kiosk at one corner, so its easy to miss. Ambiance typical of any food court but since the mall is new the eating space is still clean and looks new.

#Gelato: I tried Choco Chip & Belgium Chocolate; both were good. But the Jamun falvour won my heart. It was so so refreshing and tasted of pure fresh jamun. Prices were lower than other gelato parlors in the city.

After a late night dinner at Chili's, went to this small kiosk to grab some ice-cream. This small kiosk is located in a corner beside KFC in the food court and good thing is that they deal in cash rather than food court card. Very basic 14 flavours are available to choose from in the form of cup, waffle cone or tub. Add-ons are quite limited and not many fancy items are available. For me, I tried out the Chocolate Fudge flavour and it was really good. One scoop was descent enough and pricing was very economical. Staff were good, they took time to explain all the flavours.

If you are done eating really well and still have the space for some guilt free dessert , then just walk briskly to an option which is 96% fat free yet 100% satisfying. The options from gelato for this silky, smoothly 100% vegetarian desserts is plenty. Choose from the original After 8 dark chocolate with mint or treat your taste buds to the original ferrero rocher. If you are keen to try their sugar free options, do try their butter scotch or chocolate flavours. From musk melon to black currant,tooti frooti to vanilla, you are spoilt for choice. And if you don't like it plain and want some crunch added, ask for toppings of gems, nuts, biscotti to feel  like you have had a real dessert. If you are in no mood for a cone or a cup, try their ice cream shakes poured in a tall glass. Close your eyes, smile and enjoy!!

Looked new and it will take some time to make a name. It's located in the food court at Acropolis, right beside KFC. Don't mistake it to be the well reputed Gelato Italiano.

However, these people have some good flavours to offer at a decent rate. But quantity should be a bit more for my liking. Otherwise, a decent place. Would have been a 3.5 if there was a bit of sitting arrangement or at least the quantity had been a bit more.
