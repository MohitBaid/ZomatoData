A small shady outlet that serves fast food. Nothing much to say about any of it's dishes. Serves average rolls, chowmein, momos and fried rice. If you are hungry and want something in a hurry this might be the place if you are around the shyambazar 5 point crossing. They also serves kebabs but their hot items are egg/chicken rolls and momos.

A very popular and quite populated food joint in Shyambazar. You will always see people buzzing around the counter. Tried their momos, chicken roll, chowmein and fried rice. All dishes were served hot and were quite tasty.

Located near Golbari, Shyambazar in a very convinient place. 

Ambience - It's a roadside stall so there's nothing unusual. Besides the hustle & bustle, you won't be disappointed with it.

Food - Had Chicken Kebab Roll, Chicken Fried Rice & Chilli Chicken.
*Chicken Kebab Roll was good and reasonable.
*Chicken Fried Rice was sufficient in quantity and well prepared. So is the Chilli Chicken. 

Service - Quick.

Since it doesn't a burn a hole in your pocket and gets you Good food, so you may visit. Especially for College goers and Office goers. üòä

It's situated at shyambazar in A.P.C road just opposite Mohonlal street and A.P.C road crossing.. If you start walking from shyambazar five point crossing,you have to walk towards sealdah..It's basically a roadside joint where one can have tasty food in a very reasonable price...I ordered Egg chicken Fried rice and Dry Chilli Chicken.. The quantity was satisfactory and the quality was very good for both the rice and chicken..

Located at Shyambazar, is a roadside joint, with shabby & untidy ambience, and with limited sitting  arrangements.

Service is quick.

Chicken Kebab roll is pretty tasty with juicy stuffings and crispy paratha. 

Price is low.

A nice place to have quickbites sans the ambience.

Tripti Snacks bar is located at Shyambazar, is a roadside joint  with zero ambience, unhygienic  and poor sitting arrangements.

Service is prompt.

Tried Chicken steam momo, which had good stuffings and was decent. The soup provided with it was bland.
Also tried Chicken kebab roll, which also had juicy chicken pieces stuffed and paratha was nice too. It was very tasty though a bit oily .

Pocket pinch is cheap.

Final verdict - A nice place to have quick bites if one is okay with the ambience.

Located near Shyambazar 5 Point Crossing. Just locate 5 Point Crossing and then a few steps towards Shealdah or Khanna Crossing and you find this snack joint at the eight side! There are many street food stalls are there, so you might get trouble to find it!

Tripti is a Bengali word & it means "Satisfaction". A restaurant with satisfaction in its name & a higher rating on Zomato forces foodies towards it.

Location : Tripti is located near to Shayambazar 5 way crossing towards the way to Sealdah. Its just a few steps from the very famous Golbarir Kasa Mangso. Dirty banner of the restaurant makes it hard to locate between other footpath food counters over there.

Decorations : Its just a food counter, sittings are on footpath as benches. You can't expect very hygienic food, everything is very casual.

Foods : A very small menu including Chowmein, Fried Rice, Biryani, Chicken dishes, Rolls, Momos & thats all you will found here. They serve really fast so you don't need to wait here for trying those. We tasted the following...

Chicken Momo : 5 pieces of normal sized momos came in a plate with soup obiesly. Momos were full of chicken pouring. Momos tasted wonderful where the soup was below average. Unlike other footpath momo counters their soup was mixed with small chicken pieces & bones. At the time of writing this review for Rs. 35 expecting something more would be injustice.

Egg Chowmein Hakka : Noodles were thin, vegitables were very nicely sliced, bit oily but very well fried. Eggs were crispy fried & felt delicious in mouth. Overall it tasted very very good & the quantity was tummy filling too, especially for the price. 

Pricing : Just like you expect the prices from a roadside food counter, they doesn't burn you pocket. Everything is priced very low & they offer tummy filling quantity for that price.

Conclusion : If you haven't any problem with poor hygiene & footpath dine then its definitely an option to grab a bite. Good taste without burning the pocket that is how a hungry tummy get satisfy with.

It is a good street food joint. Once you compare it with other street food eateries, this place stands out. They offer mainly the Indian version of Chinese like chowmein, fried rice, chilli chicken, momo and the usual stuff. They make pretty good rolls I must say. Quantity is good enough. taste is also better than most. A small place with limited seating arrangements on stools on the road. The food is very good in this price range. In this area this is one of the cheaper and better places to have your spread of chicken

A roadside stall offering tasty food at cheap prices. Zero ambiance, with minimum sitting space, this is more of a take-away stall, that is if you despise unhygienic conditions. Tried the Chicken Kebab Roll here. Succulent pieces of Chicken wrapped within a flaky paratha. Super yummy and was way better in quality than most of the Roll joints I have tried till date. They are also popular for their Dosas and Noodles, which I plan to try during my next visits.

Note: My previous review got deleted due to any technical issue so its a repost...

Date Of Visit: 18/02/2016.....¬†

¬†The Place : Its near the crossing of Shyambzar on A.P.C Road. Its one the finest fast food junction in city with almost all flavours and items. They provide quality food with good quantity and in awesome reasonable price. Though they have a small place and very less seating arrangement but still its always crowded with elders and youngters. There is no compromise with the quality of food even there is huge rush in the evening. The servie is quick and they maintain proper cleanliness and hygine. I went to Shyambazar yesterday for some official purpose and felt hungry. I had visited this place numerous times so i knew where to feed myself and straighaway went to this joint. Because its not a restaurant so they have made the seating on the foothpath itself with tables and chairs....¬†

¬†The Food : I have tried only one item because of shortage of time. I took Veg Fried Rice. The rice was very nicely cooked with almost all veggies in it. The taste of fried rice was coming nicely but less salt. The dish was juicy in tatse and the quantity just filled me upto the edge. The combination of vegetables and spices were good and it was looking quite presentable. Overall a good dish to fill your stomach... My Rating : 3/5...¬†

¬†Overall Experience and Recommendation : I just tried only one dish so could not tell about overall experience and recommendation but yes its a good place to have chinese food and snacks in budget for all. A 100 bucks is enough to feed two people easily and get satisfied mentally.

A great place for street food in North Kolkata. Always crowded with people they offer a great variety and each item is very cheap. The momo and rolls are very good here and I personally just loved their mutton roll in which they use minced mutton amd the combo of paratha and chicken kebab is yummy. Try out this place to make your evening delicious. :)

This is arguably the 1st Restrunent in Zomato that I am giving a bang on 5 out of 5!
'Kolkata er Street Food' taste ke Jodi represent keu kore then it would be this Tripti Snacks Bar!
I've been there 'end' number of times lastly on 27/11/2015 and 28/11/2015. Located at the classic Shyambazar er 5 Mather more this is a Oshadharon Restrunent to try the taste of street foods in Calcutta!
I had almost 1.5 plates egg chowmein on 1day and 1 plate egg chicken chowmein on the other.
The QUANTITY and the QUALITY are both perfect!
You get fascinating rolls and momo's here as well.
Highly recommend.  

* Postscript - The chowmein of this Tripti Snacks Bar can be compared to high fie Restrunents like Mainland China and others.

Tripti Snacks Bar is one of the best street food restaurent near the five point of shyambazar. I visited here many times. Whenver pocket is not friendly with you, & you are at the five point, wondering something to eat, this restaurent is very much pocket friendly with you. The chicken momos are the best item so far. You can't get better momos in such cheap price.
I tried the spl chkn reshmi kebabs, but actually they are kathi kebab size, not proper kebab.. But you can't expect proper kebabs in below 100 bucks. The rolls, spcly the kebab rolls are yummy. The chowmin is also very tasty here. But don't go for the mutton tikias.

When at Shyambazar one has to try out this eatery. 
Nothing much to say about the shop since it looks like any normal eatery that makes street food. However, much to say about the food itself. It is more famed for its momos. You have to arrive here by early evening to have your plate of momos. Then there is their rolls. They provide a variety of it. Beside rolls and momos, there is fried rice, noodles, biriyanis and preparations of chicken as well.
Service is quick and price is also pocket-friendly. Recommended to street food lovers

It was yumm. 5 succulent pieces of juicy momos served with a bowl of soup. I liked them a lot. I thought of trying their rolls but was too full to have anything more. Definitely going back to try their rolls and of course momo. And the best part is prices are very less.

Location: Shyambazaar Crossing. 

This place is nothing more than a hole in the wall near shyambazaar crossing. Accurately, it's located on the road towards khanna/ultadanga. You'll find it on your right while travelling towards ultadanga just after the shyambazaar crossing hidden behind hawker-stalls. 

About the ambiance?
No such ambiance, just a little eatery which is divided into two eateries adjacent to each other. One is a takeaway stop and the other has¬†a wall-side table which accommodates exactly four heads and a few benches placed on the pavement which can seat nearly twelve heads. 
Has a wash right behind the wall-side table but, has no drainage pipeline to it nor does it have a tap. Little place, use a jug to wash your hands clean. I wouldn't mind a little negative of a barrel below the basin to collect the dirty water which they dispose off once quarter full (opt to sit on the bench outside if it effects your experience), if the food on offer is so delicious!

About the food on offer? 
As mentioned above about the place being divided into two, ¬†one caters to south indian food (has a wall-side table) and the other (takeaway stop) to rolls, kebabs and momos. 
Happened to discover this place while on my way to tuition, tried it out on my way back home. Seated myself at the eatery serving south indian. Ordered the following: 

- Masala Dosa
The dosa was big and slightly soft with generous masala in it.
The masala was flavorful and properly saut√©d.
Recommended. 

- Plain Dosa
The dosa was of the same size as the masala dosa, but, was crisp. 

- The coconut chutney here was runny yet, delicious and the sambhar was disappointing as well as cold.
- Had a look at the vadas, which were quite oily, didn't feel like ordering one.
- Idli had run out of stock, comments due. 

About the service?
The service was quick and the staff was friendly. 

About the pocket pinch?
Pinch, impossible. A reasonably priced place. 

Verdict?
A hole in the wall that manages to serve deliciousness in their fare.
- A visit to the takeaway stop remains due 

Was a good experience (with respect to food).
Minus 0.5 for the low hygiene level. 

Three and a half stars from me.

Any time I have to have a quick bite, I prefer this small shop and it is always worth especially with the locality of shayambazar and the perfect environment of a street side snacks bar.

A place very much attached to my growing up years.. My mom's office was nearby this place and I used to ask mom everyday for a Snacks item from Tripti! My HS days.. when we used to get very little time to rush for our tutions after school.. Tripti used to serve me with their momo.. sometimes their chicken kabab roll.. sometimes a full plate of noodles, shared by two of us! All those memories piled up when I was standing in front of this joint.. yesterday evening.. amidst a number of hungry stomachs munching on their favourites!!

Though I was quite full ( thanks to a roadside biryani joint, which we have named 'Rajnikant Biryani'!! ), could not avoid the temptation of trying out some.. ordered a plate of chicken momo... the server recognised me instantly and greeted me with a big smile.. and served the momo immediately! The plates have got cleaner.. the size of momos have got bigger.. but yes, the quantity of chicken in the filling has decreased.. thanks to inflation! The chutney is the same chilli-tangy tomato mix.. the soup is the same veg soup.. and yes, the flavour is intact!! 

Took a takeaway of a chicken kabab roll for my mom.. when she had it, she also felt the same old flavour.. crisp paratha.. with the right amount of lemon juice and chilly... juicy chicken kababs and onions fried properly... just the way she loves it!

Please dnt expect much hygiene out of this joint.. its pretty near the 5-point Shyambazar crossing.. if you know what I mean!

They still keep the price really cheap.. this gives it a competitive edge over other joints and makes it the busiest stall in the whole lane in a weekday evening... I just wish they maintain the taste in their food.. like they have been doing for 10 long years!

The Description: I often go to my Friends house at Shyambazar. Its just near the Five Points ¬†beside Garam Tawa. A place where you get Variety as you require. Both Veg and Non veg are available here with Good quality and quantity. Chinese is a must here for the Non veg lovers. And they also don't disappoint the Veggis as they offer the south Indian too just beside.

The Ambience : It is a small store with a open sitting arrangement on the footpath with Long benches and chairs. The center is always be seen the guys making something for the customers.¬†

The Food: I always love to eat the Mix rice here, its very good. The Momos, rolls & kababs here been ordered quite frequently. As i said the Mix rice is a charm here, With such an affordable cheap price they provide some very good rice with all the ingredients. The rolls are made well with less oil and the paratha is rolled hard and fried red with two tissue for you to hold it hot.. Kabas are fried well and they maintain the quality as well. Momo is also tasty as well with the soup. The Chilli chicken is a bit of a disaster here. They provide good quantity of gravy and chicken sizes are also satisfactory but the taste is not upto the mark. I always find The taste of Chilli sauce more than the spices and chillies.

The Conclusion: ¬†Prices are very affordable. Quality is quite good.. Cant see any other Fast food outlets offering so many variety at these prices.. Try this place u will love it...

Note: The Review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

24/11/2014----------------------------------Again a visit with friends at shyambazar for a haircut and we decided to eat something and there was no good place than this... We took two Chicken Hariyali kabab roll and a Panir kabab roll for a veggie friend. The roll was as usual very good, the chicken was also well made.. but the thickness and crispiness was a bit missing this time.. Thou it was not so bad... Tripti rules here..

I just love their chicken hariyali kebab roll and their momo. if you are at the shyambazar crossing this is the ideal shop for having some snacks. the shop may look a bit dirty and clumsy but the food is really very nice. I loved it.

commenting on previous review I want to correct that its a veg stall so o rolls etc n parathas too...only dhosa,idly,vada,chola bhatura etc...price is very reasonable in competition to street hawkers ...not a restaurant but a full time running street shop with ok ok tasty items ...

Tripti Snacks Bar......no review , no favorite and of course no rating at Zomato.....but once you are at Shyambazar crossing.....you will see numerous number of people are thronging at Tripti....for a munch of roll.....or a plateful of momo.....or a dish full of Chowmein. The place is just like a road side stall , much like Paav Bhaji counter....preparing and handing over hot rolled parathas with fillers inside. I have been there several time, predominantly whenever I am at this crossing I prefer to have these at my behest. I had rolls from Nizam's....but very eager to say that I preferred rolls of Tripti more than Nizam's. The Chicken Kebab Roll.....is very delicious....with added lime juice and extra onions. Others are Double Egg Roll, Chicken Hariyali Kabab Roll...... are also good to eat. The prices are cheap , very cheap. Please, have a taste of rolls and preparations made by them.
