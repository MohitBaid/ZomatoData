Could not serve Mutton Biriyani but had mutton dishes. Strange. 
Not that great food for the popularity it has. Priced high for the dishes like kababs

The location of this place is just opposite of the Quest Mall. Was there with my friend for dinner. We ordered Galaouti Kebab,Lucknowi Chicken Biryani and Firni Mousse. Biryani was good but not happy with the taste of Galaouti Kebab. Felt it was overcooked so the taste got changed. The firni was good . Decor was fine and the service was great.

Opposite the Quest mall.
This is a simply wow place for Biryani.
I had their 
Calcutta Aloo Biryani and Lucknowi Biryani.
Delicious.
The Calcutta Aloo Biryani is okay just like what you'll get in most other outlets.
But the Lucknowi Biryani is showstopper.
It is topped with dry fruits.
You discover the meetha kismis and the salty cashew as you eat. A taste and experience one of its kind and not to forget very soon.

Don't believe?  Visit and you'll know for yourself...
Different experience? Let me know in the comments section below.

Visited this place after a decade. I still remember how much regular we were with our college friends in 2012 when it was just started. But I could literally feel the change in qualities of food. It’s really amazing.

Highly recommended- Zafrani Murgh, Laaccha Paratha. 

Go fetch!

Awesomely uneatable sweet biriyani and disgusting flat gulab jamun shaped galoti kabab which almost made me puke...

Had an amazing experience. 
One of dens of Mughlai cuisine in Park Circus. There dishes are still in my taste buds. Inside the restaurant ambience was good and designs on the wall will remind you of the Mughals. We have ordered Zafrani tangri kebab and bhattiwala murgh as starters, Calcuttiya mutton biriyani and lal Maas as Main course, and firni mousse as desserts.
The staffs are well behaved, and quick in service.
Well, I had great time there and good food also.

One of dens of Mughlai cuisine in park Circus. It stands tall beside the newly opened Royal in park Circus. A cool breezy petrichor evening led 2friends to this place. They decided to tame their hunger with Galouti Kebab and Calcutta Mutton Biriyani. While they were waiting for their delicacies they marvelled on the decorative paintings and a soothing view of fast paced life in the city. The kebab felt a little offbeat to their expectation as it easily crumbled to pieces. Ah! But the aromatic mutton Biriyani added years to their life. The mutton melting into the mouth spoke of a far away tale from a Mughal court. The courtesan plays here with the tune of dishes. Well some dishes to be precise.

I've been a regular of this outlet since last 4 years and have never been disappointed on any visit yet. Their biryani is pure indulgence, served with a flavourful boiled potato and a chicken piece neatly falling off the bone. I have managed to taste most of their kebabs and chicken gravies of which their galouti kebab, malai chooza kebab, dum ki chooza, masaledar murgh are my top picks. Special mention for their amazing firni mousse that's one of a kind, with just the right amount of sweetness and light consistency. Decor and seating arrangements are simple and comfortable. The service is prompt and staff is courteous and helpful. Definitely a must visit for biryani and kebab lovers.

We were a group of 3 people and we got a table immediately. Few restaurants have tables for 3, it's mostly in multiples of 2.

The service here is pretty slow. We had to wait for almost 25 minutes. We were quite disappointed to see only a very few dishes were available and not the plethora of dishes on display here on the menu.

We ordered Calcuttiya Chicken Biriyani, Dum Ki Chooza, Rogan Josh, and Butter Naan. The Biriyani tasted good, the potato in my plate was well done. However. the one in my friend's plate was overdone. This lack of uniformity was also there in the Butter Naan. One slice of Naan is has butter, while another does not have butter. The Biriyani was served in a handi. If you put a big aloo and a big piece of chicken in the handi itself, how much space is even left for the rice? I feel the quantity of rice was too less.

The Rogan Josh gravy was spicy, I liked it. Dum Ki Chooza was the best dish here. The chicken pieces were just the right amount of cooked and the gravy was perfect.

Value for money.

Had an amazing experience dining here today. 
We were a group of 9 and easily got a table because restaurant wasn't that crowded. Ordered gilauti kebab as starters, six big perfectly cooked  pieces were served, the best I've ever had.
For mains we wanted to have Lucknowi biriyani but since Durga Puja special menu was ongoing, they recommended us to take Calcutta style biriyani. We ordered both mutton and chicken calcutta style biriyani. The main attraction aaloo wasn't well cooked, it has bit hard , but rest the rice quantity and meat was well cooked, quantity was satisfying. Ordered mutton bhuna and mutton Rogan Josh for sides, bhuna gosht deserves special mention, it was the best bhuna gosht I've ever tried, pieces were tender and gravy had perfect amount of spices in it. 
We finished off the meal the meal with Alibaba special Phirni mousse, this is a dessert that I've tried for the first time and totally in love with it. Phirni mousse is a mix of fresh cream and Phirni topped with raisins. 
Had an amazing experience all together, parking isn't an issue, staffs were courteous, service was quick and food is outstanding. 
P.s : pictures coming soon

Few steps from quest mall. I went to this restaurant on nabami night around 10:00 pm. We had heavy lunch at late hours. We decided to have a short dinner. But the taste of mutton biryani and chicken made us hungry again. 😀
I really did not expect these awesome taste on a crowded festive evening. Will definitely visit this restaurant when I will go to quest mall again.

Horrible customer service. I asked for home delivery and had to order over the phone using their number 033 4021 2222 as their website was not up and running( I don't think it ever works, they get to the point of sending the verification code to your cell and then they don't) anyways coming back to the point..the person taking my order was not very customer centric but was still bearable, he took my order and when asked for the final bill amount kept me waiting on the phone calculated the amount and finally gave me an amount. I placed the order..the order arrived after 2hrs ....the bill sent was in worn out condition and the amount exceeded by rs100 than the said amount...so I called the same number to get an explanation...the person who received my call, Mr.Soumen Pal was extremely rude..he refused to take any ownership saying he was not the one taking the order  when I asked him if they had a system where they kept all records...he answered impolitely and shouted, I asked him not to shout and he started using bad language at this point his behaviour was unbearable so I hung up and refused to accept the delivery, however considering the delivery person's politeness I decided to give a second chance...when I called the person back confronting him for his bad behaviour he was still rude..but finally said he would apologise for his behaviour...but he had lied...he did not apologise and instead started falsely claiming that he was threatened...(it's a pity they don't record calls..they absolutely should) I had nothing personal with him but his behaviour was foul and unethical and unprofessional..in fact it was more so as he yelled and misbehaved with a lady..it's appalling how people like this are allowed to sit at a service desk...people who don't have basic etiquette..let alone customer service...I feel so disappointed and I was a loyal Alibaba customer...He also said he would mail me a copy of the invoice..which he didn't. Customer service and human behaviour at it's worst.

Inside the restraunt ambience was good and the Griffiths on the wall will remind you to the mughals.
Coming to the food it was just fabulous.
I ordered resmi murg malai,butter naan and mutton biriyani.All the dishes were relish though I felt the biryani was less in quantity or may be I was too much hungry that time.
The staffs were well behaved,quick in service.

The order was delivered on time, nicely packaged. The Lucknowi biryani was nothing exceptional, just a few nuts and raisins on top and the potato was missing. The biryani was just like that available at any other place. Galouti kabab was good, Nalli ka Salaan was also good. Chapli kabab was pretty ordinary. Musallam Chaap and Masaledaar Chaap were standard, nothing different here again. All in all this was a mixed experience. I believe they do have scope for improvement.The taste of a few items can certainly be improved. The quantity was pretty good, certainly no doubts about that. The menu has variety and looks good on paper.... hope they do justice to the flavours too.

Complaint: 
Pathetic Delivery Service and Cancelling Last moment orders after 45 minutes at night is totally unprofessional and not acceptable. How can you do like this with a customer? I am totally disappointed with your service. Treat customers with respect or else close down your restaurant if you can't service properly. Disgusted as they kept me waiting hungry in the night for no reason. If they would have cancelled the order at the same time, it would not have been any issues at all. It happened with Zomato Order Online service and i am surely not going to order anymore from here anymore. Thank you zomato for not delivering me the food on time and making me stay hungry.

This restaurant is very easy to locate, opposite of quest mall. Went there on saraswati pujo. I loved the ambience. Place is small & smartly decorated. Tried their calcuttyan chicken biriyani, dum ki chooza, green salad, coke. Loved their food quality as well as quantity. Specially dum ka chooza was mouth watering. Price is affordable. Service was good. We didn't have to wait too long. Would like to visit again.

Picked up a Calcutta Biriyani and a Lucknow Biriyani. 
Both tasted just average. There was no difference between the 2 varieties except that the Lucknow one had few dry fruits added to it.

Portion was okay. Price reasonable.

It's a snack eatery. I went there with a friend. We ordered pretty simple menu - calcuttiya mutton biriyani and dum ki chooza( a chicken item ).
Quantity was sufficient, biriyani tasted nice but dum ki chooza was passable, nothing to rave about as compared to its hype and price.
Service was  ok, staffs were  not so cordial, definately not the best place to hang out.

I have been here twice and had different experience. I always have a soft corner for Only Alibaba for it's mutton biryani. To serve all my expectations they have a wonderful menu with lot of surprises. I enjoyed it to full on my first visit 2 years back. However my last visit wasn't so pleasant like before. I ordered Mutton Boti Kebap and Mutton Biryani, and I was stunned by the under cooked mutton which was not at all expected at Alibaba. I guess, lunch wasn't a good idea specially having mutton since it takes time.

So be careful to chose your lunch menu ;) service was good and the ambiance was all okay. Of we talk about price, I think it's worth if the mutton is tender and juicy :)

Ordered in twice from this restaurant in the recent past, and they've been very decent both times. I've never expected a whole lot from Alibaba, which probably helps their cause. Most of their food is very dependent on the gravy they serve, and it's hard to complain when the do a fine job with it.

Their dal is a very strong dish, something I would recommend ordering most of the time. I haven't tried out much from this place, but the little I have had seem to suggest big things. Definitely one to try out more.

For me, they cook the best Biryani in town. Kebabs are also delicious. The only problem is that Biryani is limited on special days, like christmas or new year. I ordered chicken biryani for 4 but they just had mutton biryani only for 2. Anyways, the rest of the days, they are awesome. Must try according to me.

One day, my partner and I had an episode of misunderstandings and resentments. So when we successfully got over the mad phase and forgave ourselves, we decided to end that chapter on a foodie note!And we landed up here for a weekday dinner.

Location:   Very conveniently located at Park Circus, just opposite the Quest Mall

Ambience: Nothing extraordinary, the eatery houses two rooms for its diners; the plain white walls are adorned with pictures from history

Food:
Bharwan Kalmi Kebab- We had this for our starter, and must say it’s one of their most amazing creations. There are four big, fat, leg pieces, fully stuffed inside with chicken keema. The portion size is humongous, although the taste wasn't something that would keep lingering inside your mouth.. worth a try.

Calcuttiya Chicken Biriyani- Because it was for dinner, and because we were already too full from the kebabs, we ordered one plate of biriyani for the two of us. It was good, though not overwhelming.

Raita- quite thick and tasty 

Service: Service was good, the waiter being very polite and responsive to our queries

Pocket Pinch: The meal cost us 575 INR.

Was craving for Kebabs, and hence while returning from Quest Mall, decided to drop by here. Spotting this place, has become very easy these days due to Royal Restaurant, which has come up just beside it. Ordered for Tandoori Chicken for take-away. The meat was very flavorful and succulent. They weren't the chewy types one can usually find at most of the places. The marination was excellent. Can easily beat some of the best restaurants specializing in this particular Kebab item!

Perhaps the only place where the Kolkata style biryani can provide competition to Arsalan's. The mutton biryani here is sumptuous, and much less oily compared to Arsalan's, hence easier on the palate. The mutton stew or roghan josh accompany the meal well. Top it up with a masala thums up.

Only Alibaba Gold is the fine dining restaurant of the popular brand.

**Location**
Near the Quest Mall opposite to Zeeshan.

**Experience**
Dined in for a lunch here with kebabs , Biriyani and Mutton Kassa. Kebabs were not that good as the chicken in it was stiff and didn't blend the taste also the Biriyani was blunt and not so tasty. Only the mutton Kassa was OK but oily as well. 
Service and ambiance is good though.

This is probably the oldest Alibaba outlet and is located opposite to Quest mall.
With two friends I visited this place few months earlier. There was hardly anyone around as it was 1.30 at noon.
We had mutton biryani and lal maas. Biryani was nice and quantity was also pretty decent. Mutton pieces were well cooked. I found one of the mutton piece with less meat and mostly bone. Lal maas was really spicy and I liked it personally.
Their service was a bit slow according to us and ambience was just okay, nothing to about their ambience.
Overall it was a satisfactory experience and pocket pinch was acceptable.

Alibaba changed there name to Alibaba Gold, I don't know why name change but maybe this was there first outlet that's why..

Now coming to deco and ambiance and from tjose deco was average looking fine diner and ambiance was good.

I went there minimum of 6 to 7 times and after Name change they changed their prices and dishes. 

This time I were full because I ate pizza from nearby store so I opted for fresh lime soda and Galwati Kebab, taste was good but i think the kebab has so much moisture in it, 

After that I ordered their biryani, that was pretty good. 

Staffs were prompt and courteous. Anyways that was a mixed experience.

This is one moderately good place. Some of the dishes they serve are no where up to the mark but some can actually give you a pleasant surprise. 

They have a hodgepodge decor and the ambience is kinda odd. Like, I have never seen this place full with all the tables occupied. There's always only two-three tables occupied at the most. Feels a little strange to sit there and have a meal with more waiters than guests around. 

Service can get slow. And the waiters are moderately efficient but polite nevertheless. 

Food, as much as I have tried so far, is better than just good. 

Their Chicken Tandoori and Peshawari Murgh Tikka is surprisingly good. The meat is very tender and succulent and with flavours seeped into the core, it is actually better than the Tandoori Chicken served in some of the mainstream Mughlai cuisine restaurant chains.
Try these, do. :)

The Calcutta style Dum Biriyani is average, thick with spices. The price they charge for it isn't justified at all. 

They make beautiful, absolutely delightful Tandoori Rotis and Naans. I mean, so good that they actually deserve a mention here. The scrumptious aroma of the whole wheat flour baked rotis combined with the sight of butter dripping down the surface can surely elevate your hunger.

Patthar ke Gosht. It's one of the good Mutton main course dishes that they serve. They gravy is red and spicy with the right amount of smooth creaminess to delight your taste buds. The meat is generally cooked well, tender and falls right off the bones. 
Funny thing, some of their dishes can taste alike. For example, Patthar ke Gosht and Laal Mas, they have a nearly identical gravy with different garnishes. That's actually disappointing. 


At any rate, if you do come in here and order the Tandoori Chicken or the Peshawari Murgh, you won't regret it. I highly recommend those. And the bill doesn't burn a hole in your pocket either. :)

Had the displeasure of ordering in from here for an office lunch. The galouti kebab that was ordered was rotten. It was stinking of rotten meat. The Biriyani too was not upto the mark. Their Lucknowi Mutton Biriyanis are priced at 250 bucks but only contains a single piece of mutton. Not at all pleased with the quality of food and not at all recommended. This is not expected from an Alibaba Outlet.

After a long time, from the monotonous biriyani and the same Mughlai cuisine, I finally visited a Mughlai restaurant that serves very authentic and delicious Mughlai dishes. Unlike other Mughlai restaurants, this one also serves better ambience along with a well managed staff and system. 
Coming to the food, it's just so delicious. The kebabs were just so good. I tasted the DIL KA RISHTA kebab which was soft, tender and mouth-watering. Next up, I had tasted the keema kulcha, a naan, a Romani roti along with the very very tasty Mutton Roganjosh. The mutton was so well cooked and so tender. It just melted in the mouth. I was taken by surprise when I had the keema kulcha. It was like no other. It had so much stuffed kulcha and tasted awesome. 
Earlier I had also tried the biriyanis-Lucknowi and Calcuttiya-both of them. They too tasted awesome.
Being said about food, this place pinches a slight more in the pocket than the regular Mughlai restaurants but the food is completely worth it.

The second time I went there I wasn't satisfied like the last time probably because I couldn't find the flavour I liked the very first time. So the third time I visited there to finally have a strong feeling about the restaurant. Again it surprised me with its great food. Biryani here is very good and the chicken rezala cooked very well but not satisfied with the firni. I expect it to be served in that earthen vessel as it helps retaining the aroma. A place worth consideration if you came out hungry from the Quest Mall

Ordered Galouti Kabab, Calcuttiya Mutton Biryani, Peshawari Keema Kulcha, Bhuna Gosht and cold drink. Baked Rabri with Kulfi wasn't available. Food quality is not upto mark (except Biryani). The Biryani was yummy, less oily and less masaledar, but more aatar or water based essence was used for the aroma, mutton piece was very juicy & softy. Galouti kabab was good, but it's smelled like burned chapati, served with dhania & imli chatni. The imli chatni was so tasty. Peshawari keema kulcha was just okay. Bhuna gosht with 4 big piece of mutton, tested (eYaak) very bad, mutton pieces wasn't properly boiled. I'm not really happy for having this type of food. Overall just OK.

Only 1 word. PATHETIC. The food was stale. we took a home delivery of galauti kebabs, khakori kebabs, keema kulcha and baked rabdi kulfi. only the baked rabdi kulfi and the keema kulcha to some extent were edible.
Poor quality of food. will never order again nor will recomend.

A number of items of different tastes is available. I had to ask them which one is better starting from the starter to dessert. Which they suggested were great. Kulcha was one of the bests, far better than that of Arsalan.

The food at this restaurant is probably the best iv ever had! There have been multiple occasions for a visit here and every time has been like the first time you get blown away by something amazing! The Biriyani, choose whatever you like, trust me its awesome! And the chicken tandoori here is by far the best  have had in the city! Not just that, try the kebabs, gravy dishes all in all they serve some of the best food money can buy!

Only Alibaba Gold is situated near park circus seven point opposite to the Quest mall. The added word 'gold' z perfectly appropriate, coz, it z better than any other alibaba outlets from all aspects.The location z good. I liked the ambiance very much. Waitors are well behaved n helpful. Service z prompt. Price f the food z reasonable. Last of all food is tasty.. I tried calcuttiya mutton Biriyani, masaledar murgh n masaledar kulcha. All of them were better than my expectations. Baked rabri with kulfi is the dish, I would like to suggest u.. It z awesome.. N a new creation.. Loved it most. Wish to visit it again..

The restaurant scores in all departments, i.e., location, ambiance, cost, hospitality and most importantly food. Visited here in July with a friend. Tried chicken biriyani (most reviews praised their biriyani for being less oily and light, I was even more impressed with the presentation and the taste) and Gilafi Sheekh Kebab ( it has been a while and I still remember its name because the dish tasted awesome and the quantity was more than enough for two of us).

The Worst Chicken Tandoori and Biriyani ! 
These guys charge much extra ! Rs 300 for Special Biriyani where you can get special biriyani from the any of the other Biriyani Shops for Much Less !
Guys don't make the mistake of Ordering From Here ! Worst Experience!  
Couldn't Manage to Eat the Biriyani it was so Inpalitable !

Well it was a long time desire to have biryani at this place and when the same was fulfilled, it is aptly to say that the desire was surely a worthy one.
One of the best mutton biryani of Kolkata - it is the appropriate term to describe the biryani of here.
We also had Butter Nun, Reshmi Kabab, Murg Massallam and Kulfi with Rabri - All were perfectly cooked and highly appreciated by our taste buds.
Thumbs up for this restaurant.

The ambience of the place is good enough and the service is pretty good too. Now coming to food its not upto the mark. Both the chicken and the mutton biriyani are not bad but nothing extra ordinary either. The sides and the starters are better. If u like kababs do try the galauti kabab.

The first name which comes in my mind when I think about Kebabs is Alibaba Gold, It remains one of the finest mughlai experience yet.
Situated just opposite of Quest Mall on the Syed Ahmed Avenue, this is a very famous restaurant.
The decor is fine with wooden chairs and tables, few paintings of the mughal age can be seen, ambience is OK but the staff need to be more professional and organised. What irked me was the song on the music system inside the restaurant, it should relate to the bygone era,instead it was pop.
The service was fine, but it took them very long to serve the food.
We ordered zafrani kebab, banana parathas, biryani and a chicken dish.
Voila! The wait was worth it. Zafrani kebab was the best I ever had. 4-5 pieces of it was ecstatic, soft on the inside while the crisp layer on the outside. The size of pieces were big. The best item in the plate. Now came the  paratha and chicken dish. The banana parathas is simply big enough for a hungry person like me. The chicken dish was also superb with the typical egg in it.
Biriyani was fine.

Ratings
Food:- 4.5/5
Service:- 3.5/5

I will highly recommend you to try out their kebabs and parathas. Its a must eat.

Located Opposite Quest Mall. Beautiful place to visit with family and friends. Interiors are sublime giving a mughal era feeling. But the food items were sensational. Started off with Kakori Kebab which was great then ordered Chicken Biryani rice portion was ok but the chicken piece was soft and tender. Mutton Biryani was good too but had issues with the mutton found it hard to swallow. In gravy Chicken Sahjahani was unforgettable loved it to the core and then ended with Tawa Paratha which was ok not that good. Overall fine dining experience.

We went the restaurant on 11th August 2015 for dinner. The food at "Only Alibaba Gold" appears simple, but the flavours have remarkable depth. It is known best for its range of kebabs and mughlai delicacies, and the reputation is well deserved. The Galouti Kebab and the Peshawari Tikkia Kebab are served warm with fresh salad and two types of sauces complementing the taste even more. A host of other goodies, including Zafrani Laccha and Dum ki Chooza makes a wonderful combination. Other than that they served Masale dar Murgh and Zafrani Pulao, offering something for the whole family. The Firni Mousse was a wonderful experience. The place is both clean and tidy - despite having limited space and more customers than can fit inside at one time - and all the staff members there greeted us with smiles as warm as the Kebabs they serve there. I would thoroughly recommend "Only Alibaba Gold" to anyone with a Mughlai tooth. I know I'll certainly be returning soon.

I had been to many Only Alibaba outlets in the city. I heard that Only Alibaba Gold is a bit different than the others. And Yes, it was true. we tried the Calcutta Mutton Biriyani. It was a bit different. The biriyani was less spicy with some fried onion strips over the plate. The mutton piece was really awesome. It was damn soft. We also tried the Malai Choosa Kebab. This one could have been a bit less dry but Anyway, it was again awesome. The place is not much big but the waiters are very friendly.

So tried biryani at this joint when it first opened. Wasn't very impressed. But looking at the recent good reviews. Gave it another chance. The kababs are all different and excellent to taste. Well prepared. Unique combinations. The calcutta biryani was fragrant and had a unique flavour which is a challenge in Kolkata especially in park circus which is full of biryani joints in every corner. The gravy however was very bad. The mutton piece undercooked. And the gravy base itself not at all appetising. The kabuli naan was tasty but would have been better with a hint of salt added to the flour. Without which it tasted a bit bland. The shirmal was a huge disappointment as it looks nothing like its namesake. 
To summarise do give this place a try but only for their mouthwatering and unique range of kababs. And their biryani too.

I was here only once, and that was also quite a long time ago. I think this is the main branch of Alibaba.

Location: You have to go towards seven point crossing from Zeeshan's crossing. It will be on your left hand side.

When we were there we, we were the only one in the restaurant. To our surprise, there was no one from restaurant side also. We had to wait for 2-3 minutes then one person came up from inside.

Interior was well decorated.

Food was not up to the mark. Ordered chicken biryani. The taste was okayish type. Also the potato served with the biryani was not good and not properly boiled.

So, it was not at all a pleasant experience. I was a fan of Alibaba's biryani, but after being here I have doubts on it.

The first thing I would say about this restaurant is that the ambience is good, e.g. the decor and the service. But the most important thing missing here was a single dish of food that was worth noting (amongst the ones we ordered at least)! The price was on the higher side which absolutely was against the quality of good they presented. Need to work on their culinary skills. I would say the Alibabas with green boards have a better food quality.

Location: Park Circus, opposite Quest mall.

 I'd been itching to try Alibaba gold for sometime now for a couple of reasons, one- they have a completely different set of menu from other Alibaba outlets in the city and secondly- their firni mousse, which was recommended by many friends of mine as outrageously unique. 

The ambiance is quite refined, soothing decor, white marble surfaces and comfortable chairs, soft lighting, it's what you'd expect from a good diner. Service was on the slower side but the waiters were well behaved and very accommodating for our various requests.

In starters we ordered Malai choosa kebab and Peshawari tikka kebab, the latter one was far better, it was succulent and appropriately spiced... and the problem with malai choosa kebab was its tenderness but taste was good. 

Chicken calcuttiya biryani- aromatic and flavourful...good quality long grain rice, tender meat, well boiled potato makes it worth trying. Quantity wise sufficient for one person. 

Zafrani Pulao- no presence of real zafran though but aroma and flavour was there, sweet in taste...tad bit greasy, nothing special.

Shirmal: one can find its preparation details in the menu...a good alternative from those naans’ and  kulchas’...

Dum ki chooza and Reshmi murgh malai, both dishes were very decently prepared...moderately spicy, flavourful; chicken pieces were succulent...goes well with rotis or parathas but the preparations were extremely oily.

Kulfi- pretty decent dessert to try...taste wise good but it was extremely sweet.

Firni mousse- it was so delicious that I actually start to salivate just thinking about it....creamy-perfectly sweetened, a brilliant modified version of traditional firni....perfect way to end a meal; a must try.

Overall, the experience was enjoyable but nothing extraordinaire.

Hello foodies!

I am pretty lazy when it comes to writing reviews. I visited this place during October 2014 and I'm only getting around to writing about it now.
Anyway, I do remember my experience very well. It was quite distinct. This was not because of the ambience which was nothing extraordinary. It was because I was introduced to this very delicious item on the menu by my best friend: Dil Ka Rishta. I have included a picture of the same. This is chicken and mutton and cheese all together. What more can you want?
The Calcuttiya Chicken Biriyani was decent, although I found the oil used to be on the higher side.
For dessert, we had Firni Mousse, which again, was very good.
If you're around this area, I highly suggest you bunk the age old 'Arsalan' mania and to give this underrated restaurant a try. It'll be worth it.

Bon Appetite. :)

A good restaurant to have the Mughlais specially the Biryani, though the tastes can be bettered by other Biryani Joints out their in the city, the amenities, the decor, the arrangements are perfect and has a very good location as it is very close to the Quest.. But need to have some good and trained man power along with service back up, yesterday went around 10:00 in the night and they were exhausted and can't serve Biryani, on high dates like 15th April (bengali New year), they do not have proper planning and service back up,... I feel that's the biggest drawback they have.. Food quality is good and well prepared..

No place in town can beat Park Circus when it comes to serving Mughai cuisine. With so many options in this area, this has become one sort of a Mughlai destination for foodies in town. Only Alibab Gold adds to that kitty to a great extent with good quality food at somewhat reasonable rates. Though the taste has fallen by little, the place still remains as one of my favorites. The ambiance looks good and the service is prompt and I believe, this outlet serves me the best of all compared to any other. Hope to visit soon.

This place is a makeover of the previous only alibaba, and the 'gold' is for the face-lift of the place and the quality of food as well. The sitting is comfortable but not lavish. The entire place has nice paintings depicting the Mughal era. The kebabs, here, are to die for. My favourite is the tangri kebab which they serve with a pudina chutney and a tamarind chutney. The leg pieces of the kebab are huge and juicy, very well cooked and has the aroma of saffron. The biriyani is standard, with a huge piece of meat, though, they don't include boiled egg in it. But i felt, if the biriyani would have been a little less oily and had a bit less of the powder garam masala, then it would have been just great!!
There is an awesome dessert, the firni mousse. they serve it with grated almonds and basil leaf. Its a must try. 

N.B. Though it says open till 11pm they tend to close it by 10:40pm, so try to get in before 10:30 pm

The kebabs they serve are great. People can come and have some rare mughal delicacies. The common mughlai and awadhi cuisines are also good especially kakori kebabs, Lucknow biriyani etc. The ambience is moderately good though I think they could have added a little bit more space.

If you want to have mughlai food and be healthy, this is the right place. They use refined oil and I never had any stomach problems after eating there. The biryani is light and has a reasonably good taste. For the gravy items I would suggest chicken bharta. Starters can be Chicken Tandoori and chicken reshmi kebab (always a safe bet). For any treats in my lab, whenever we want indian food, by default this is the place to order from.

Alibaba Gold is located just opposite the Quest Mall. The place has a medium sized seating space with a capacity of about thirty odd. The walls are adorned with paintings depicting the Mughal era which actually goes pretty well with their cuisine.
We were in a hurry and hence had just 3 dishes. 1. Shirmal - which was a cross between Naan and Tandoori Roti, but tasted great. The salting was perfect and it had a nice combination of crispiness and softness. 2. Murg Reshmi Masala - the chicken was great too. The pieces were juicy and tender. The gravy was rather tasty.3. Kulfi - a fine ending to a satisfying short lunch.  
Looking forward to visiting this place sometime soon to try out the other dishes. :)

On 31st Dec 2014 we visited this restaurant, one thing I really feel at the time of entering that the price will be higher. We ordered lots of dish includes kebabs, special mutton curry, salad and luckhnow special biriyani. Food quality, ambience and behaviour is obviously very good. I would recommend this place for best mughlai khana on Kolkata as on date.

I and two of my college friends decided to meet on a fine shiny Sunday to have lunch together. Basically it was my birthday treat after 20 days of my birthday. I came here after the renovation and i must admit that the changes are for its betterment. Décor is really nice and the seats are very comfortable. Well dressed waiters is a special mention. Beautiful paintings of kings and his soldiers are hanging on every wall. Coming to the food, we ordered jugal bandi as starter and shirmal, masaledar kulcha, chicken sahjahani and lucknowi chicken biriyani as main course. The starter is a combo of chicken and mutton preparation where in a single piece the middle portion is of mutton and the outer portion is of chicken. Taste is good and unique though the mitha aatar (scent) should be a bit less since i don't like it. In main course, shirmal is a must try and is very unique in taste. It is thin roti having zafran n yellow in color. Masala kulcha is soft n good as usual. Chicken shahjahani is for those who like less spice n less chillies. It is neither hot nor sweet but a perfect balance of both. It is served with fresh cream on top. We teamed biriyani with mixed raita. Biriyani is excellent but the consistency of raita is less thick n more liquid. They kept us waiting for a long time to serve the starter. Amount is good. Otherwise, service is nice. Price is reasonable. One visit is must.

I don't usually write a poor review especially on biryani joints but I have to do it this time because I don't want others to made the same mistake. It’s a small eatery located just opposite of Quest Mall. I went there few days back with one of my friend for lunch. We ordered pretty simple menu, two ‘Calcuttiya Mutton Biryani’ and one ‘Dum Ki Chooza’. The quantity was sufficient for both of us. The Calcuttiya Mutton Biryani tasted nice but the Dum Ki Chooza was passable and not something to rave about. I mean they tasted alright, but not at all worth the hype or price. While we were eating I found there was a hair in the biryani which was a total mood spoiler. When we complained to the staff about it, he said “Sir, chul ta ki ami sorie debo na apni nije sorie neben” (Sir, shall I remove the hair or you will do it by yourself). We found a hair in the biryani and the waiter did not even bother to apologize, I was shocked at his audacity. Even small restaurants always change the dish immediately regarding this type of issues. Advices from a person, who love to eat regularly a lot of restaurants, do not waste your time and money here. Service was probably never a high point of this place. The staff is perpetually disinterested and don't seem to care much beyond doing the bare minimum.

My last visit to Alibaba was a rather bitter experience. This time for a friend's reunion thankfully we decided to give it another go. Food Quality and taste has really improved a lot. 
Calcutta Biryani, Laccha Paratha with Pathar Ki Gosht (Highly Recommend this.) and Bhuna Gosht

One thing that you need to keep in mind that the recipes found in this (Gold) outlet cannot be found in the others. Price seems honest to it's quantity.
A good experience if you're ready to defy Arsalan's legacy :)

Only Alibaba Gold is a premier restaurant in park circus area. Ambience is good, clean and very well maintained. This place is mainly for spendthrifts. I ordered  Lucknowi Mutton Biriyani, Zafrani Pulao and Murg Musallum. The Biriyani was good but not up to the mark they tired there best by introducing Zafran and a lot of Cashew Nuts, Raisin on it but the taste was little bit sweeter. The Pulao was unbelievably tasty. I think they cooked the best Pulao in kolkata. I don't know how they prepared it because the amount of sweet was exactly appropriate. Murgh Mosallum was nothing special but it was good. I expected a lot from this place but it disappointed me. I would say that if Biriyani is your primary goal then you must visit Shiraz Golden Restaurant.

Located near Seven point , opposite to Zeeshan , this place has become the neo mughlai destination. I liked the food here better before it went through changes in its menu and cooking staff. The Biryani before was comparable to that of Arsalan . Now they come in earthen pots as they are cooked individually in dum style. Last I went with friends we tried GALAUTI KEBAB and DIL KA RISTA for starters. The Dilka rista is a must try here and it is an amalgam of chicken ,mutton , spices and what not . We order CALCUTTIYA CHICKEN BIRYANI and LUCKNOWI CHICKEN BIRYANI ,both of which were not up to my expectations. The biryanis were accompanied by ROGAN JOSH and DIL KA TUKRA.  The PHIRNI MOUSSE was more like kheer , but I savoured every scoop of it. The ambience is good and waiters are patient . They also have a separate room to cater large groups . Alibaba, I might have moved on , but I still have feelings for U .

First off I do not stay in Kolkata so my review is not relative to other restaurants there. I was visiting the Birla museum with my dad and since it was lunchtime we decided to head to a decent place that was a short drive from there. The lady at the counter of the museum suggested this place. It was quite good. The menu is quite limited in terms of meat options but whatever we had ordered was delicious. Staff was a little too laid back for my taste but maybe I'm nitpicking. Had a delicious meal here and will probably visit the next time I'm in kolkata.

Firstly the decor is very simple nothing over the top,but yes the service is really good and the staff are friendly and helpful in giving inputs when it comes to food.I had gone there with my friends for lunch, we ordered two biriyanis and firni.One thing that really struck me was the quality of the food::Biriyani:: Unlike other famous cousins of its in the nearby vicinity the biriyani served here won't cause you any  un-easyness once you've devoured it. The oil/ghee quotient is very much on the light sight yet the dish is prepared well. The quality of the rice used is really good and its cooked in such a way that they don't stick together which one can find at some well-known brands in the area. Coming to the chicken is was cooked well enough to hold the spice and remain supple.Firni:: The firni mousse was a good fusion dessert , it had perfect combination of the two and yet enticing enough for you to be craving for more. Once again its on the light sight on the tummy. Pricing is very much moderate compared to the quality and quantity on offer.2 biriyanis+ 2 aerated beverages + 1 firni mousse = 1600 inclusive of taxes.

Located just opposite Quest mall  it had its tempting posters all around the city when it opened some months back. On a  week day aftr office me n my cousin was terribly hungry and was in park circus area,instantly we decided to try this.we wre late n hungry so very quickly we decided to order bhattiwala murgh,baked kebab, shirmal n laal mans.
They took some time to prepare n we started to look around. The decor is typically traditional with old paintings, wooden carves etc.
Then came the food. Bhattiwala murg n shirmal.
For your refernce shirmal is rumali roti with kesar as far as is remember and tastes heavenly.its went so well with bhattiwala murgh.this murgh is spicy tandoori chicken .i loved thia combination and expactations went up.
We wre disaapointed with baked kebab n laal mans. Baked kebab was very cheesy.kebab wrapped in tons of cheese and lal mans was too oily n meat  quality was bad.
My mughlai dinner never ends without firni.so ordered one.this time it was firni mousse. It was presented so well and looked so tempting but tasted pretty weired.cant compre this with firni at all.lacked the originality.
Overall not a very satisfying experience.
P.S:must try shirmal with bhattiwala murgh!!

Usually i dont used to take biriyani or mughlai dishes as dinner at some outing. But after deciding to have a mughlai dish I always love to have it on Alibaba gold.. In my opinion the best ever biriyani in kolkata.. And its so light that it doesn't create any kind of hessitation after taking it. And the other mughlai dishes like Dum ka chooza or light dishes like naan and kasa is good. This branch of alibaba has well mentained and the quantity is good enough.. At last but not in list the firni.. I am requesting to all of the review readers please taste the firni of here. Its 75/- . Better than the best.. Full marks from my side..

Considering the area they're located in, this place gives a tough competition in their quality of biriyani to the other popular biriyani places located nearby. Very light and quite oil free, they provide a good quantity for a voracious biriyani lover. The other item on their menu that i have thoroughly enjoyed was the murgh methi malai... Surreal in it's taste and difficult to forget...

I and my partner dropped in at this place yesterday evening as soon as the place opened .  It was just 7 and we were not in the mood for dinner. A special biriyani split between us, was what we had in mind. On being seated , we found that the special biriyani option is not available in the menu. Finally we settled for  one Calcuttiya Chicken Biriyani split up and a plate ( 4 pieces ) of Galaouti Kebab. Being a hardcore Reshmi Kebab person, I think it was my first experience of Galouti Kebabs and I found them pretty brittle and flavorful. My partner didn't like it that much though. The Calcuttiya Chicken Biriyani which followed just fell flat on its face. It was on the drier side, and the chicken seemed tough on the teeth. We began to miss Arsalan, two of which lies on either side of this outlet ( not adjacent but both are within a couple of minutes walk ).  

The decor of the place is quite good, with  nice paintings depicting the regal lifestyle of the Lucknow Nawabs. There are a couple of ornate works on the ceiling, which seemed to be the best thing about the whole experience to my partner. Considering that we were not there for dinner;  but some good food to fill ourselves up for the time being, a bill close to 520 /- including VAT and service tax seemed a bit on the higher side on reflection.

 I ( we ) may be back here someday to try out the Kebabs; but if I am in the mood for biriyani , it's going to be Arsalan all the way ( till I get to know that things have changed ).

Visited this place last week with frnds....on a weekday..at around 12.30 pm.even though,we were the only customers,the staffs seemed to be quite ready to serve....they were courteous...now,the interiors are fine too,pretty decent and there are two window side tables,just beside glass window,through which u can watch the street and the people outside...oh,i missed the location--its opposite Quest Mall!!! now about the food..we ordered calcutta chicken and mutton biryani and murg musallam and drinks...even though chap is not in the menu provided,they do serve it if asked for...well,the biryani was nice..came in sealed handi,which looked great..the murg musallam even had an egg with it!! the dishes were both nice,tasty...little oily,which is considerable regarding mughlai dishes!! no such complaints about this place..other than the fact that..the prices were pretty high with respect to the amount served and that the drinks were served about 10-15 mins before the meal,which i would have preferred just at the time of serving meal...looking forward to visit again!!

The galouti kebabs were a complete let down. Do not make the mistake of ordering here. Calcuttan Biryani was pretty average, the biryani served before they went from Only Alibaba to Alibaba Gold was better. The curries were pretty good. The firni mousse was a nice twist.

Lovely kebabs, awesome food quality but too damn slow service. It's very small place, so sitting arrangements very unorganised and unplanned. Tables are very close and it has small rooms like a house with 4 tables tables or so hardly any place to move around, in order to serve they have to actually do excuse themselves and jump over from one sides to other to reach the other end of the table. I don't mind going back again but this time it will be only parcel no sitting please. I would suggest others to do the same please.

 I ( we ) may be back here someday to try out the Kebabs; but if I am in the mood for biriyani , it's going to be Arsalan all the way ( till I get to know that things have changed ).

Visited this place last week with frnds....on a weekday..at around 12.30 pm.even though,we were the only customers,the staffs seemed to be quite ready to serve....they were courteous...now,the interiors are fine too,pretty decent and there are two window side tables,just beside glass window,through which u can watch the street and the people outside...oh,i missed the location--its opposite Quest Mall!!! now about the food..we ordered calcutta chicken and mutton biryani and murg musallam and drinks...even though chap is not in the menu provided,they do serve it if asked for...well,the biryani was nice..came in sealed handi,which looked great..the murg musallam even had an egg with it!! the dishes were both nice,tasty...little oily,which is considerable regarding mughlai dishes!! no such complaints about this place..other than the fact that..the prices were pretty high with respect to the amount served and that the drinks were served about 10-15 mins before the meal,which i would have preferred just at the time of serving meal...looking forward to visit again!!

All is fine but biriyani mutton pieces needs to be looked into as they were in different sizes and some had too less Meat. Price is also on the higher side than should be.

The galouti kebabs were a complete let down. Do not make the mistake of ordering here. Calcuttan Biryani was pretty average, the biryani served before they went from Only Alibaba to Alibaba Gold was better. The curries were pretty good. The firni mousse was a nice twist.

Lovely kebabs, awesome food quality but too damn slow service. It's very small place, so sitting arrangements very unorganised and unplanned. Tables are very close and it has small rooms like a house with 4 tables tables or so hardly any place to move around, in order to serve they have to actually do excuse themselves and jump over from one sides to other to reach the other end of the table. I don't mind going back again but this time it will be only parcel no sitting please. I would suggest others to do the same please.

I was pretty intrigued when I saw the Only Alibaba Gold adverts almost everywhere around the city, particularly in the Ballygunge Phari area and the Seven Point crossing junction. So, I decided to give it a try. And after tasting almost of their Kebabs, I can undoubtedly say that it serves the best kebab in town currently. Be it Gulouti or Dil ka Rishta or my personal favourite Mutton Burrah Kebab. The quality has improved by leaps and bounds. However, it may just seem a little bit costly but what the heck, you will not be disappointed. Oh, and the service has also improved quite a bit which is also a plus. The only noticeable negative thing is the carpet area. And the fact that during the weekends you have to wait for quite some time before your turn comes.
