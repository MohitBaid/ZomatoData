The one thing that people in Kolkata can't live without is the Biryani. And this is the reason that many small to big Biryani makers have come come up with outlets. Ashraf Biryani is in the Park Street area, walking by the lane beside the Quest Mall I ended up here. Took a plate of Chicken Biryani as parcel. The Biryani was decent at such a low price of Rs.65.
Chicken piece was good in size, also the rice was good.

Ashraf biryani located in a place where we have too many biryani centers nearby. It was good until adil opened up. Rolls n all r nothing to mention about. Biryani can be tried once.

It is a small restaurant located on Shamsul huda road. They serves chicken and beef biryani. Biryani is average in taste and satisfying, ghol is enjoyable.They also serves rolls in the evening, rolls are not up to the mark and very oily. Not enough space to dine,it's better to carry away.
