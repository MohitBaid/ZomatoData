Have often heard about the Pao Bhaji of this place, but had never got the chance to try it until today. Ordered an Ordinary Pao Bhaji and a Special Bread. The Pao Bhaji was good, but not something I would revisit this place for. Special Bread was just an extra Pao with more butter, and some special masala of garlic & onion, but that too was average in taste. To be true, one can get better Pao Bhajis in Kolkata. Didnt try anything else apart from juices, which were fine too.

Vegetarian food at costly range, comprising of dosas, paw bhajis, chola batura! Pizza etc. A small restaurant on Lord Sinha Road with a fresh fruit juice bar infront, the food tastes reasonably good and the quantity is fair. The ambiance is ordinary, nothing fancy but the food is nice. So is the service. I would recommend this restaurant over Ridhi Sidhi, for a quick snack or meal. Paw bhajis are very hot and spicy. Definitely not the best in town.

Whenever i fell like having ‚Äúpaw bhaji‚Äù - Mayaram was one of the places i would love to go..But unfortunately the quality has degraded..

Had ordered special ‚Äúpaw bhaji‚Äù but to my surprise the veggies were not mashed properly,there was no taste in the bhaji what soever..
The experience this time was a bit disheartening..

Have given 3/5 just because i have some relishing memories from this place and assume the last couple of times were just odd days..

Would update the review going forward üôÇüôÇ

Carving for some good pav bhaji? You must visit this place to satisfy it in every aspect. One of the best pav bhaji of Kolkata is served here. We tried the ordinary pav bhaji here because their special pav bhaji contain dry fruits and for me the two doesn't go well together. Along with pav bhaji we tried other dishes. We had masala dosa, chocolate shake, cold coffee. Everything was nice. It is a great place for vegetarians.

This place has been here for quite a long time. Situated right beside Emami Market, it is most famous for its special Pav Bhaji. Recently, it has done a makeover of the place and extended a bit, but I have been here before this happened. The food is no doubt delicious and perfect for tired shoppers to relax in the AC and have refreshing Kulfi and Juices. For fast food lovers it is a must try.

This place is popular for its Pav Bhaji. One of my friends and I were walking down this lane after shopping and thought of having a quick bite of this famous Pav Bhaji. The place is very small but clean. The service is fast and staff is friendly. We ordered for one normal Pav Bhaji and one Cheese Pav Bhaji with soft drinks. Honestly speaking both the Pav Bhaji were nothing extra ordinary but were good. I have had better ones also in this city. However, since it was all good hence the rating.

Well a few days back me and my wife felt like having some delicious pav bhaji . I told my wife about this place that it serves mumbaiya pav bhaji and very famous for it she agreed to give it a try . We went all the way from Howrah to Mayaram to have pav bhaji but sadly we didn't found it as delicious as we heard about it .It was jus an average plate of bhaji and a single pav which cost you 90 bucks .I mean they should at least serve a pair of pav with bhaji as its a standard portion known to every one. overall I found it  not so good worth a single visit only.

I went with a friend and ordered 2 special half pao bhaji , the waiter got the same but was full which i didnt realise,
I ordered for a bottle of water and we were 3 people on the table,
The indecent waiter just got one glass and when i told him the same he gave me an angry glare hahaha
On the whole the mayaram then and now is totally changed,
Not the same anymore!!!!
Go at ur own risk as they r busy chewing every penny out of your pocket then providing you quality food n service

1:Kala khata gola
2:Chilli paneer 
3:Onion Uttapam

Among them kala khata gola was good but the other two items was not liked by us.

I have never written any reviews. but this experience forced me to write one..Had heard a lot about maya ram n had a desire to try out their paw bhaji. But it was a disaster. Its hard to say it was average also.. tried their special pawbhaji n it was no where nearby average also. It was pathetic..with ful of low quality oil dribbling of the plate which made the taste even more awful.i even saved another customer from making the blunder of trying their paw bhaji.

This is a small restaurant serving vegetarian food. The uttapam‚Äôs and dosa‚Äôs are good. But this place is popular for its paw bhaji. They are really good. It is a good idea to order for ordinary paw bhaji as the special paw bhaji comes with four pieces of cashew thrown into the bhaji and dollops of butter at Rs. 40/- extra. Not worth the money. The other thing to try out here are the kulfies. The sitafal kulfi and mango kulfi stands out and are easily the best. In fact the mango kulfi is made keeping the original mango intact. They somehow deseed the mango and mash the mango flesh to make it into kulfi. The mango is then cut into pieces (with the skin intact) and served. It is yum yum yum.

This place was among the best in the city during the late 90's period. With time it has evolved quite a bit. The only dish that still holds that charm is pav bhaji which i bet, can only be topped by very few. If you want to have pav bhaji in Calcutta look no further. Avoid the regular bhaji and opt for special. Oodles of butter and cashew is what makes it "special" and don't forget to ask for the free masala pyaaz. The place thrives on simplicity and its the simple pav bhaji that makes this place a gem. #Zenfood

I was in theatre road few days back with a friend and we were hungry. Then, she suggested that we could go to Mayaram. She had visited earlier but it was my first time. It's located a building or two away from Emami Market (Lord Sinha Road).
Service- Decent,nothing extraordinary.
Ambience- Decent. Cleanliness can be worked upon a bit.
Food- Great! I've tried both their normal as well as special pav bhaji and both were remarkably good. Though the pricing is on the higher end its a must try!

We were always repelled by the sight of a ‚Äúvegetarian only‚Äù restaurant and would religiously avoid entering one under any circumstance, but the greed for kulfi egged on by positive reviews brought us here on a nice and rainy evening. It‚Äôs a clean eatery which looks bigger than its size due to its mirrored interiors. Pav bhaji is not something we dig, but Mayaram seemed quite the place for it as people kept on coming and packing them away constantly the entire time we were there. Nevertheless, we decided to have the Chili Babycorn (cause, no one can possibly get it wrong!) followed by Sitaphal Kulfi.

The quantity of baby corn was below satisfactory and the taste was too sour for our liking. They had simply cooked up a Mumbai street food version of the dish with an excessive amount of lemon juice and coriander. It was sad to see our assumption falling flat on its face. Next served was the small whitish kulfi, sliced up into tiny pieces.There was only a very slight hint of the fleshy fruit amidst the kheer and malai, which only added to our disappointment. The taste was fine otherwise, nothing beyond normal. 

The prices are pretty high given the quantity of food they serve. Sadly, Mayaram failed to change our perception towards ‚Äúvegetarian only‚Äù restaurants. Maybe a plate of their seemingly revered pav bhaji in the future might make us think otherwise.

A small eatery located on Theatre road is famous for the Pav Bhaji it serves available with extra butter. The melt in the mouth Pav is an old Calcutta favourite and over time it has added grilled sandwiches, dosas and even Chinese food to its menu. Priced at Rs. 100, the Pav Bhaji from Mayaram has a legacy of its own and gives total value for money.

I hope that the makers bring back the quality that this joint once had . FOR NOW AVOID THIS PLACE !!!!

This place is overrated. Honestly, why? I have been hearing this amazing paw bhaji place in my street (I stay in Lord Sinha) but never tried it, even though everytime I crossed this place, my mouth watered. ????
So on a fine sunday afternoon, we went to this place for lunch. I was excited. We ordered two special paw bhaji and coke. 
Disappointment stuck me on the very first bite.  The paw was yellow and greasy. And the bhaji would have been better had it not contained all those extra dry fruits. Really now. Adding lots of dry fruits doesn't make it better, ok? I have had better paw bhaji in Kolkata. So, I am so sure I am never visiting this place again.

The oldest and most authentic paw bhaji maker of kolkata..
It had its 1st stall outside Victoria and soon it progressed to this outlet..
Their paw bhaji hasn't changed over the years but its price has been hiked over the years..but still its passable..
They dont have any extraordinary flavors but still its worth a try..

Looking for a lip smackin pav bhaji's? Well mayaram has the answer for this question..being a college goer of this area,I along with my friends drop here as often as we can to fill up our appetite and offer our taste buds with finger lickin bhaji..the kesar kulfi is also a must try along with rose soda sikanji..:)

Second dinner - well it's the Puja's so no can complain right..????REALLY Busy and hustling - good place to take the Delhi frankly friends to - to serve them Their - pav bhaji and kulfi and noodles ... Just a simple living - Dhaba types; good food 
Pav- well buttered and even without- really soft (could have been warmer) 
Bhaji- lots n lots of cashews (that was new) - really filled with all the veggies & thankfully less of the potatoes!
Kulfi- mango and malai - nice but honestly really lacked flavour...Disapponting 
Rose Sharbat- more like a roohafza  soda - pretty peppy n cool.
Sada Paan- Yh well I'm not a Paan person in the 1st place so not My area atleast :p

Their opening time is 11.00 am. I with a group of my friends went there at 11.30 still they were not open. Said abhi ek hour aur lagega. Saw around 10 to 12 more customers retirning back. UTTERLY UTTERLY DISGUSTING. WONT VISIT EVER AGAIN

Mayaram is a very popular restaurant among my vegetarian friends, if it may be called a restaurant at all. It looks more like a dhaba in the heart of the city, with a juice shop right outside, and very simple chairs and tables arranged neatly in a hall with no air-conditioning. Being a strict non-vegetarian whenever I eat out, it required quite a bit of coaxing by the vegetarians in our group to get me in. The plain dosa was just perfect, with the entire surface area crisp, unlike most dosas which are a little soggy on the insides. The cheese dosa had slivers of cheese neatly lining the inside of a crisp dosa, and added just the right amount of creaminess to the dosa. However, the pav bhaji it is most famous for was a disappointment for me, as it was a tad too spicy and very oily indeed. Cold coffee was the worst, as it tasted sour, which may have been due to the milk gone bad. Am I glad I didn't fall ill after the meal!

My fiancee's school was at Lord Sinha road and since then Mayaram has been her go to place for chitchat, some light snacks and loads of adda with friends. We recently went there and ordered A paw bhaji platter because she loved it when she was in school. A masala dosa and a plate of Hakka chowmein.
The place is good, simple interiors and seating arrangement. They serve only Veg dishes and sell many Pure Veg snacks and Dry fruits etc.

They took around 10 min to serve us the dosa and paw bhaji but took another 10 min for the chowmein to arrive. The portions were good and cost effective. The taste is also ok. The serving time should be improved. 20 minutes for a plate of chowmein is a bit too much.

The place is great if you are nearby and are looking for a place to have a quick snack.

once upon a time it served best pav bhaji.
If you are walking by lord sinha road then you are certain to get tempted to walk into mayarams.
 now it is far from what it use to be. mayarams only selling point is its food, which is not at all consistent. ambiance is not something you should be looking for.
prices are high for road side food.
You can also try sev puri..dosa..they are decent

Ask any calcuttan where to go for paw bhaji...answer - mayarams...I have lost count of the number of times I havebeen to this place...they make some of the bet paw bhajis you can have anywhere...the varieties arw large and each one of them excellent. Chilla is another good eating option. The rest however is okay types like any other restaurant.

Mayaram restaurant. Now who hasn't heard of it?
The legendary paw bhaji and the chillas are to die for. 
My mom and I are pretty regular here.. My mom swears by their food. 
We usually order Momos chillas special paw bhaji and pizza here. The Momos are served with the chilla chutneys which is pretty funny honestly. 
The chillas are super yum and so is the dahi chaat as well. 
The special paw bhaji is just perfect!
Coming to the pizzas it is very basic.. Saut√©ed veggies on the pizza bread baked with cheese. My brother loves it somehow! Pair it with chilled thumps up or masala thumps up and you're good to go!
We end our meal with kala khatta gola and it's perfect. 

The service is super quick despite the rush that is always here and the prices are very reasonable too.

As you cross the busy lord sinha road you are bound to be enveloped by the smell of the wonderful pav bhaji from mayaram.Mayarams is the oldest restaurant that started of with pav bhaji.Their restaurant now has expanded their menu to south indian,chinese and even pizzas.I grew up on their special pav bhaji (the owner is a family friend).The special pav bhaji is an absolute favourite with a generous serving of butter and cashewnuts.The pavs are so soft and you just need to dung them in the bhaji and youre in for a treat.The south indian here too is good, the masala dosa,mixed uttapam are tasty and so is the sambhar. The chinese however i think needs to be worked upon. Snacks like paneer pakoda and babcorn are good too.The kulfi here is a must try, follow it up after a plate of special pav bhaji.The sitafal, orange,mango,litchi kulfi are just wonderful to taste.

Had visited the place after a long long time.. Ordered PAv bhaji which the place is famous for.. Initially they served within 5 mins without onions for garnishing.. We requested the server to make the bhaji more hot and they did that reluctantly .. Salt was slightly more but it was an average experience ..

I have always heard good things about mayaram mostly for their paw bhaji. But i happened to try it only a couple of years back since am not so much of a fan of chaats, paw bhajis etc.

Actually when i went inside i was quite astonished to see an air conditioned restaurant with so many seats and a pretty long menu. Since we were a group of 8-9 souls , a lot of dishes were ordered and the pricing was pretty reasonable for us to stop experimenting. There is not much of a decor. Staff is polite and service fast enough.

Coming to the food, i would say they are a street food joint basically serving you the street food on your table in an air conditioned room. You are served on the paper/ thermocol/ dry leaf plates as on street but i am fine with it as long as the contents taste good. Paw bhaji was the only item that was worthy of a re-order. Other than that, chaats and chinese were very mediocre. Fresh fruit juices are always a great thing to have on a menu and though not so great, they were decent. South indian food is not so great either. They have a variety of kulfis on their menu which was liked by my gang.

Overall, mayaram is a decent place for chaat and paw bhaji lovers. Same could be inferred also from the rush you see inside at any given hour.  ordinarily i would rate it a 3.0 but for the really nice paw bhaji which is its speciality i would give it a 3.5.

I‚Äôve lost count of the number of times I‚Äôve been to Mayarams ! Mayarams ‚Äì the famous Paw Bhaji destination , is perfectly located at Lord Sinha Road..! To be more precise , just in between Theatre AC and Emami Market. This place is famous only for two prime reasons :
a)Paw Bhaji
b)Strategic Location- Its very close to Shri Shikshayatan College, AC market and Emami Market and hence caters to a wide audience of young and old people alike !

The place doesn‚Äôt have an extra ordinary ambience . It just simple plastic chairs and tables. The only good part is that its Air Conditioned and in Calcutta- that itself is a big relief- especially during summers.

Coming to Paw Bhaji ‚Äì which perhaps makes me write this review ! The Paw Bhaji is delectable and Lip smacking ! Rather it‚Äôs one of the best in the city . The Bhaji is coarse and perfectly spiced. The aroma is so strong that you can sniff the smell of Paw Bhaji even when you are several meters away from the stall.
They are generous enough to use butter in heavy quantity in their Paw Bhaji and that makes the dish simply Killer (obviously not in the real Killer sense ;)
Served with finely chopped onions, Coriander leaves and lemon , this dish is served with two Paws , perfectly roasted in butter upon the tawa.
I do not remember a single time when I haven‚Äôt ordered another round of Paw.

They also serve a royal version of the Paw Bhaji called Special Paw Bhaji - which has lots of dry fruits and apparently some more butter , but to be honest that makes no sense for me. I love the Paw Bhaji in its authentic form and which indeed is the best ! 

The other items in its menu include a few Chats , some Chinese (Indianised version ) , South Indian, Kulfis and Juices . They are however not a very good option to try out at Mayarams. If you‚Äôre in here ‚Äì you should only stick on to their signature Paw Bhajis.

The service is very unstable. It actually depends a lot on the quantum of people present. At times their super-fast and sometimes they could be compared to a snail. The Paw Bhajis are served in throw away paper plates , with wooden spoons which at times is disappointing because they could make the presentation a bit better .

The bottom-line is:
This place is highly recommended for Paw Bhaji lovers ! If you accompany this with a bhaand of Soda Sikanji- it‚Äôs truly delectable and a treat to your stomach!

First off, the hype over this extremely pathetic eating joint astounds me. I don't see the big deal.
The Paw Bhaji is supposed to be extraordinary but it seems pretty average to me, if not inferior. Also, being served in 'pattas' and paper plates along with those cheap flat ice cream spoons for such an extravagant amount of cash is something I find extremely unappealing. The ambiance is no good either. Neither is the service. Overall, this place has nothing. No good food. No proper ambiance. And certainly not friendly to the pocket. This unhygienic, creepy and degenerate place is surviving solely due to it's once past glory.

wen it comes to mayaram, mango kulfi hits me instead of paw bhaji.
mango lovers dnt waste anymore tym n indulge in dis true treat. its a treat.  its not d regular kulfi, its unique. they actually give u a full mango, inside which dey fill d liquid kulfi, which wen served is like kulfi inside a mango. isn't that amazing? ??
not to forget the paw bhaji, i love d special paw bhaji der. 
service is ok. place is shabby, but der r tyms wen taste n quality matter d most.

it is really a very nice outlet mainly for PAW BHAJI lovers. The special paw bhaji is very tasty. I disliked their chinese section. I had tried their gravy noodles and momos....they were not that well made, very okay types. The butter dhosa was also tasty. If you visit this outlet then go for dhosas and paw bhajis..sanwiches, pizzas and chinese section is not that good.
i will rate 3.5 for MAYARAM RESTAURANT.

again being a regular lord sinha road visitor, this place has always grabbed my attention due to the smell of the "bhaji" when fried in the "tawa" smudged with the melted butter. though the juice stall outside it serves healty musambi juice and somehow manages to cut off the calories gained having the buttery bhaji (rather called masala bread) inside the restaurent. if you working in the theatre road area, and hungry..... this place is a must visit offering all kind of street foods, chinese, along with south indian ! :-) ting!

Any college goer who has been to a college in and around the erstwhile Theatre Road, currently known as Shakespeare Sarani is bound to have had visited this place on the end of Lord Sinha Road where it meets Shakespeare Sarani. The place is friendly on one's pocket and serves excellent coolers and the best part is having the option of enjoying it inside a restaurant without any change in taste. I have usually noticed that restaurants fail to bring in the taste that street food offers but that is not the case with this ever popular joint. I have never enjoyed the particular dish called paw bhaji ,not even in its place of origin and usually steer clear from it but Mayaram's kulfi is what I enjoy to the optimum. Their unique feature is the offering of flavoured kulfi which is seasonal and with one spoonful you feel there actually is the pulp of the fruit which flavours the kulfi. Their chuskis are delicious and getting the opportunity of enjoying the cooler while sitting inside a restaurant is an offer few can resist. I do not personally find their savoury items exceptionally good  but it has a certain degree of standard but their coolers are wonderful. The juices are freshly pressed and their offerings of soda are great when you have had a heavy lunch and need something to give you a sense fo relief in your system. My rating is solely based on their offering of coolers.

Drop into this pure vegetarian restaurant when you want to have mouthwatering South Indian food clubbed with equally good pizzas,sandwiches and all time favourite pav bhaji.
You just cannot miss out the paw bhaji here. This place is worth a try and must a try.Go for their special paw bhaji if you don't mind those extra calories or opt for the ordinary one which is special in its own away.Serving for the last three decades, this joint also offers Chinese dishes. Those who like spicy food can dig into mix chaat,dahi kachori and chilla. Sip on something while you munch with a choice of soda shikanji, fresh juices and lassi.

Mayaram's is an institution for the Paw Bhaji lovers of Kolkata ! For those of you who like your paw bhaji and have not sampled it here head over for a taste. Wash it down with their equally famous soda sikhanji and your tastebuds will thank you.Their dahi kachori and chilla are quite nice too in case you still have space. Just a tip though be careful to avoid ice in your soda sikhanji and ask for a cold soda instead as the ice is quite dirty sometimes.
