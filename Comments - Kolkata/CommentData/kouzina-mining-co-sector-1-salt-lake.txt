Lovely food lovely environment and courteous staff. The food came to our table very quick. The dessert was very good. The fried ice cream the cheesecake the ice cream and the brownie was brilliant. The starters were great. The galouti kebab, the kala Pathar and garlic prawn were delicious. The 1 less is just that they charged service tax and GST. That’s not quiet fair.

Located just beside fly kouzina, but unlike fly kouzina...this restaurant serves non veg. The ambience is that of a coal mine, a nice dark themed restaurant. Food is good but a bit expensive. I tried the grilled chicken with jus and the grilled bhetki...both the items were delicious and well cooked. Overall nice. Would love to try the indian section as well

Theme restaurant is the latest trend of Kolkata; Kouzina mining co. is the new addition to that list. The interior is quite well impressive if you don't go to the minute detailing. 

We ordered mocktails which are-
Green apple mojito- very refreshing; definitely recommended
Virgin sex on the beach- it has a tangy taste
Barman's Pitcher- it contains red bull which I personally didn't like
Berry Blast- sweet flavour; recommended

In starters we took-
Tandoori fish tikka and they use fresh bhetki for that. It was definitely a good start. 
Kaala Patthar which is basically chicken prepared with herbs; not up to the mark.

Main course-
Chicken tikka masala- it was super spicy and utterly butterly delicious; best of the lot. Cheese garlic naan was the perfect acquaintance with it.
Thai green curry chicken- it has lots of coconut which was served with rice. 
Dessert-
Blueberry cheesecake- it tasted good though I am not a fan of cheesecake
White chocolate mousse- it was just the perfect ending of our meal, though it is made of white chocolate it is not that sweet.
Pricing is on the higher side and I think they need to get liquor licence to match up to the expectations.

Overall experience-
Food- 4/5
Ambience- 4/5
Decor- 4/5

This coal mine-themed restaurant is one of the newer additions to the restaurant scene in Salt Lake.
It has gained in popularity for its North Indian and also Chinese and Continental food, such that on a Wednesday night it was jam-packed with diners eventually warming up for their meal when we visited it.
The attendant at the reception was missing from his place leaving it empty and none of the staff were availabe to write down our name in queu, which led to some initial confusion for we were wandering inside the restaurant vaguely lost, with the busy servers brushing past us and none of the suited attendants coming over to help us acquire a seat. Later however a cozy table was given to us after the leftovers from a recently-celebrated birthday party were cleared. Such small but disorienting mismanagent can be looked into and further avoided in the near future for guests, like arranging for a replacement in receptionist if the original one leaves his station to check on the table arrangements inside, as we were duly informed by the polite floor manager. Nonetheless we got a comfortable seat, though after around 15 minutes of waiting which is okay considering the restaurant was full for the evening, excluding the careless reception. The footman however helped in the parking of our car, which is appreciable.

The reception area plays the sounds of coal being extracted and the workings inside a coal mine, along with replicas of miners' attire and tools like helmets and gloves on display to give the eatery an authentic touch to its theme.

The inside, dimly lit with dim lamps, felt more like a warm wooden chalet somewhere in the snowy mountains on a cold winter night, rather than the inside of a coal mine. The ambiance is a bit noisy, filled with voices and conversations from surrounding tables, drowning the Western pop music in the background.

The water is served in champagne flutes (like in many other restaurants in the city), placed on coasters flaunting posters of classic Hollywood and Bollywood movies on coal/gold mines, such as Mackenna's Gold and Kaala Patthar. The cutlery is also uniquely matched with the theme: heavy brass-handled forks and spoons and kintsugi-style plates, dishes and condiments set.

Additionally to be noted and not to be overlooked are their hospitality (despite fault in reception which they tried desperately to make up for, not wanting to taint the reputation and goodwill of an emergent competitor in the restaurant business scenario), swift cleaning service and praiseworthy service of food in general, with servers being courteous, amiable and helpfully suggestive. Their efforts to please, look into and rectify the angry complaints lodged by dissatisfied guests (like us) won me over afterward.

Coming to the food, we ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and Veg Hakka Noodles.
The noodles were long and thick, the way hakka noodles should be, and tasted very typically Chinese, the likes found in common Chinese eateries in Kolkata, with nothing extraordinary to add to it.
The chicken, with a gravy sprinkled with nuts, was also standard tasting, and could have been made a lot more appealing for the taste buds.

Overall, the dishes were of above average quality but not greatly memorable that their tastes shall linger in one's mouth long after they've been consumed. Toothpicks and refreshment like sweet saunf were provided post-dinner in a cute wooden barrel-shaped bowl, but napkins were absent which should have been made available at tables.

For a casual dine-out once, Kouzina Mining Co. is a preferable choice, considering one is too hungry to even hunt for any other good place to feast on.

Visited this place with friends the entrance gives you a feel of coal mine even there is sound of hammer on coal we ordered veg tandoori platter and jalpeno cheese ball both were good but a special mention to the mango floverd dip with the platter was auwsome. We ordered Indian food consisting of exotic vegetables  and dal makhani and Italian lasagna .I found the food to be a bit spicy than normal so if you have a spicy palate do visit this place .I gave this place extra .5 point for ambience and service or else a 3.5 is good enough. They do charge you service charges so Chk bill before giving a tip. Happy eating

This is not the first time I am giving a restaurant 5 points, but surely this one deserves this rating the most.
The reasons being
1.LOCATION- this place is easy to locate, with enough space for your car parking.
2. RECEPTION - the well groomed staff and their service from the moment you enter to the moment you leave the place,deserves a special mention
3. FOOD now coming to the best part about kouzina chains!
we ordered, KALAPATHHAR, KEBAB PLATTER, ONE VIRGIN MOJITO,ONE JAMAICAN MOJITO AND ONE BERRY BLAST.
for the main course, we had THAI GREEN CURRY, MASALA KULCHA, MAKAI ACHAARI and another mutton dish( I forgot the name :p)
And in dessert we had,white mousse!
Both quality,quantity satisfied us with an amazing style of presentation.
And...  this place deserves an extra star for the music they played.. from cold play to Ed sheeran! top notch!  ♥

The decor is good, I mean real good, but sadly except for the mining sound nothing related to the mining interior. Regarding the food , it's good honest food, but again, nothing extraordinary. The prawns were fresh and kebab platt@er was good. Cheesecake was a revelation and really good (except it lacked the hard biscotti base). And milkshake is defiNitwly recommended. 

But considering the ambience and environment, a beer license might be needed.

After a long wait and poor queue management, we managed to hit this colliery themed restaurant. The decor is interesting with dim lighting, hard hats and other mining gear. The food is pretty average. Tried the afghani chicken tikka which was well cooked. The galauti kebab failed to make the mark. It wasn’t melt in the mouth and didn’t have the whole spices well blended. Utter disappointment. Dal makhani and chicken lababdar had rave reviews and was recommended by the restaurant but they very pretty average and not at all worth the hype.

I have not heard or seen any gastronomical joint built on coal mine theme. Well the fact is Kouzina have achieved this extraordinary feat. The moment you step in will give you an impression of stepping into a deep dark tunnel with hammering sound of coal mine in the backdrop. Extreme effort been given to all detailing.
Now, the main fun starts to select your pick from the huge menu. Anyways, we have put our fingers on Garlic Butter Prawn Chermoula, Kaala Patthar and Afgani Chicken Tikka.
Prawns were perfectly tossed with generous amount of butter and garlic must be hold with its tail to dip it in Tzatziki to feel the taste pallet. Chicken Tikka cooked inside clay tandoor gave that smoky flavour and must to tried with mango chutney to get the burst of taste. Kaala Patthar is the weakest link here which is nothing but chicken satay served in skewers while tossed in some black sauce. Chicken was though and chewy and I personally it's a hyped dish.
Wait, don't get disheartened. No story is over without sweet ending. So here comes the Classic Cheesecake. The cheese cake topped with Blueberry sauce served warm which enhances the taste. One of the best cheese cakes I ever tasted.
OK, now before you think to head for here ensure to reserve your table. The restaurant is very popular. The price of the dishes are on the higher side. Service was very smooth. Do check the final bill if you are not willing to pay optional service charge. Till then, keep digging your taste buds.

From the house of kouzina comes another themed restaurant very close to the old one. With the theme of a mining company, the interiors are designed in modern industrial tone with balance of wood and metal. The golden lights are dim, enough, just to not blind you. The place is spacious and the seating area is ample.
For the starters we ordered,
Cream of asparagus soup, Amritsari tandoori aloo and American corn pepper salt, which were all very good.The mocktails were good too. For main course we had the Italian veg platter and veg lasagne. Both of them very equally amazing. I loved the grilled cottage cheese steak, served in the platter. I was thrilled by such amazing food. The service was quite good. Pocket pinch- on a higher side.

Food : completely satisfied.Ordered cream corn soup with fried noodles, mining fire chilly blast chiken, Italian nonveg platter, fried icecream.
Soup has perfect consistency. The chiken is very spicy and tasted sort of chilly chiken. The platter is very delicious and sufficient for two after starter. It includes chicken, fish, prawn, egg omlette,breadstick, mushroom, sauted veggie and Italian rice. Fried icecream is vanilla scoop rolled in coconut powder. They serve with chocolate sauce and masala cashew which only enhance the taste of whole dish. The garnishing is superb.

Service : quick and satisfactory. They attain you as soon as you complete your food and serve the next order in no delay.
Ambiance : Mining themed. Interior is made up of wooden walls and mining related inspirational and knowledgeable slogan written all over. The lighting is little dim and hanging above each table. They decorate with some mining caps & dresses and blows customary sounds of mine at the entrance to give you the feel. Also you can wear the dress and cap for a quick selfie.

We have visited this place on the month of June when it first started.. From then till now we happen to visit 4 times and will continue to do so.. You talk about ambience, it is superb and extraordinary with pleasant songs and coal mining effects will make you feel like you are in a real coal mine. Now food. You can have plenty of food with almost 4 different type of cuisines... My favorite Chinese and oriental. The service is utmost good. The price of the food is a bit high than other restaurants buy if you are thinking to spent the evening at park street in any restaurants then this might be a good option for you. I recommend everyone to visit this restaurant atleast once.

This is one place where you can eat and rave about. You will definite leave the restaurant satisfied.
Food- 4.5/5
What we ordered- For the starters we ordered Kala Patthar from their Appetizer World cuisine menu. It's a chicken dish and they serve five pieces that is extremely juicy and is cooked a really flavourful sauce. It was yum and a must order.
For the main course we ordered Thai red curry (chicken) from the oriental menu. It comes with a portion of steamed rice and it was one of the best curries I have had till date. The veggies retained the crunch and the curry was overwhelmingly flavourful. This dish was a definite 5/5.
For our indian mains we ordered masala kulcha, butter naan, paneer lababdar and chicken tikka masala. The breads were super soft and tasted yum. Paneer too was good but my heart belonged to the chicken tikka masala. You really have to try it to experience the heavenly taste of the rich flavourful gravy and the tender grilled chicken pieces.
Next we went the Italian way and ordered their Italian non veg platter and honestly after being so high on their excellent food we were left disappointed. The platter consists of a small portion of fried rice, grilled chicken, fish, prawn, mutton galti kebab and fried egg. Each of the items were under - seasoned which made the platter taste really bland.
We were extremely full after our food so didn't go for desserts.
Ambience, Theme and Decor (3/5) - since it has mining in its name, one would expect to see miniature mining tools and machines replicas or even cutlery, unfortunately it doesn't evoke the feel of mines.
But the place is nicely done up with comfy chairs and couches with lil music playing in the restaurant.
Staff - 5/5
They were corteous and prompt.

Not visting this resturant again. 
I visited here because of my last visit which was wonderful. 
Hoping to relive the same experience,  we went there again but little did we know that this would be the most disgusting and embarrassing situation i would ever face. 
The staff didnt let us in because he wanted to count the heads and assemble in a line as if he is the Principal of a school. 
His behaviour was rude and extremely unwanted. When we said that the others are parking the car,  he refused to lend a ear. 
It seems like they are doing a favour by letting us inside their resturant. 
Definitely not visting again. Will stay starved but will not visit this resturant again.

We were around 10 people,  as we were parking both the cars opposite to resturant,  one of us got out of the car to get a table,  Somnath Mondal,  one of the restauraunt staff,  refused to give us a table without a head count and  behaved ike a complete hooligan. In anger we had to get out and proceed to any other restauraunt.
Never visiting again and will make sure my friends and collegues will also avoid.

If you feel you like to be humiliated and are served a langar,  go for this else HIGHLY AVOIDABLE

The cost is similar to other big name restaurants all over Kolkata, but it's proximity to my house in Salt Lake is why I chose this place. I can safely say I will keep going back to this place for a long time to come. 

Apart from their delightful food I really liked the huge variety of choices they provided.

To keep guests entertained they have also managed to recreate the feel of being in a Coal Mine with an amazing backstory about the miner Milo who with his amazing golden spoon produces brilliant Food! The staff is warm and cordial and loves to help out with special requests.

It would be an understatement that there is a lot of hype about this themed restaurant. I don't mean to rain on their parade, but apart from the lobby playing ambient sound, I found nothing connected to the theme. It's certainly interesting with an industrial look but it's not a lot to do with mining :) The service was good but for some confusion over the availability of dessert. The food was consistently of a high standard. I highly recommend the mushroom ki galawat and laccha paratha. Aparagus soup and bagar e subz were also very good. The final course was white chocolate mousse which I didn't like at all for several reasons. It wasn't a mousse as much as it was a cream. Unfortunate for both parties that the good meal ended on this note. Barring this, it would have been a 4 star meal for me.

Visited this place yesterday. The exterior and interiors give the vibes of being in a mine. It's a bit dark but well done up. You get to hear the sound of tools breaking rocks in the background. Overall the ambience is fine. Coming to food we ordered the veg Italian platter. I was there with a friend who had visited the place before and really liked the platter and found it quite heavy. So I took her suggestions. But when the same was served it looked totally different from the last time. The quantity was very little considering the price. The taste was also nothing great. And they didn't serve any dips with the potato wedges. The sauce which was served with that one piece of paneer (cottage cheese) was very little. Overall the platter was on the drier side. I believe the main attraction of any restaurant is the food...the environment is secondary. So I would suggest that they give more attention to the quantity and quality of the food that they serve.

What's amazing?
▪️Ambiance : dimly lit but spacious seating.
The place gives you a diner vibe. Cutlery and hygiene is up to mark.
▪️Service : upon arrival they will note down your name and notify you via mobile or person when your turn comes up. Inside too the service is pretty smooth. Waiting time can be 15 to 20 mins considering the crowd.
▪️Food : The best tandoori tikka and chicken tikka masala ever. My garlic naan was superb.Menu is diverse and had some tempting items but we were in a hurry so ordered the regular. 

Miss :
▪️Food : mutton was chewy. That's uncalled for. The gravy was great but meat was a a spoiller.Tandoori roti was very hard.
▪️Pricy: it's not very affordable but I will let that pass because the menu and food were tasty. However portion size for starters can increase significantly. All items are 300 to 400 range.
Am definitely visiting again to try the continental dishes and hoping to give a 5 star rating because it has every potential.

We reserved a table through Dineout app and got 10% discount and additional 20% cash back. So 2156 bill was lighter on our pocket. Use my code : RJWZN while downloads and get 100rs off on 1st bill payment. Happy dining.

To start with, this place would have got 5 stars when I started my meal. A break up of my experience:

Ambience- 5/5- the restaurant has a theme of mines, and the interiors are quite cool with industrial lighting, mining tools for display, great playlist and beautiful coasters. The seating area is pretty big. 

Food- 4/5- being a group of seven, we ordered chilly baby corn, amritsari aloo, galouti kabab and xacuti fish fingers as appetizers. The kabab and baby corn were really amazing. Main course was garlic naan (good), laal Maas (not upto the mark), murgi bharta (good) and spaghetti (good but spicy). The desserts were fried ice cream (has loads of coconut, so if you don't like the smell, avoid), cheesecake (good) and white chocolate mousse (good). 

Service-2/5- though the staff was friendly when we entered, they could not manage the "crowd" on a weekday evening and asked us to change our table when we were about to start with desserts. They couldn't wait for another 15 min. When we told them that we would be leaving in 10-15 min, they hesitated a bit and obliged, but however, handed over the bill even before we asked or even finished the food. One staff member in fact commented over our shoulder as to how we have been "occupying" the table from 7.30 to 9.30. I hope the management does understand that we are paying for every dish and the experience as well. As such, a big group occupying a table for 2 hrs and still paying over 4.5k as bill should not be that difficult to manage. It is their problem if they have overbooked. FYI, we had a prior reservation.

What an awesome place for some awesome food.
Decided to go for Indian menu today.
Ordered paneer Banjara tikka and mushroom duplex. It would be fair to say that paneer Banjara tikka was the best variant of paneer tikka we had in ages. 
Ordered paneer lababdar and dal makhani in the mains and Peshawari naan in the breads. Paneer labadar had the right amount of gravy and beautify dark brown gravy just the way it should be. The highlight of the night though was peshawari naan. The sprinkles over naan just made it so unique and delicious.
Overall a beautiful food and moving out with a smile.

Kolkata's first mining theme restaurant with golden lights and wooden interior  gives a dusky look to the restaurant giving an illusion that you are dining in a mine. There are query and relevant props like muners hat, shoveld and spades along with iconic quotes from movies. Sharply dressed servers welcome you with a smile on their face and serve with impeccable hospitality. Fun Fact: All their menu price end with 7. 

I ordered Murg Tikka Masala and it was delicious. The flavor were a bit on the spicy side as clearly indicated in the menu with a chilly sign. The chicken was marinated and cooked well. The portion size is good for 2. 

Naan: i read that their breads are awesome and the other reviewers were spon on. The naan was soft and moist. A good compliment to the main course. 

All together the experience was good. The ambianc, the food and service everything is top notch. The overall experience was great.

Visited this place with couple of my friends over lunch. Their facade is very appealing, and rugged look of the ambience gives a nice feel. We ordered for their chefs special Kala patthar and Oriental Salt Pepper Prawns for starters. Chicken was super tender and Jumbo prawns were juicy. For mains we stuck to Grilled Bhetki and Pan Seared Chicken breast with jus. Both were one of the best dishes we all had tried since quite some time. I would highly recommend this place . Thumbs up.

Lip-smacking food and never-seen-before ambience.. 
My personal favourites are Killer corn tikki, Paneer Banjara, Dal Makhani and Peshawari Naan. Their classic cheesecake and white chocolate mousse are to-die-for. Double thumbs-up to the Kouzina brand, and best wishes to their future endeavours. Cheers

A beautiful coal mine themed multi cuisine restaurant that offers not just a plethora of lip-smacking food but also assures a soothing ambience. This is the most comfortable coal mine you'll ever be in. It is beautifully decorated with some mining props and also very well lit. They've also incorporated a short story regarding their mascot named Milo of how he dreamt to dig deep into the culinary treasures around the world and hence Kouzina Mining Co. was born. Along with that, as the place reminds you of various coal mine themed movies they've put some of the famous dialogues imprinted on the coasters. Their idea is absolutely unique and very well executed. From service to food every part was well taken care of. 

We started with some really refreshing mocktails. We ordered: 
➡Berry Blast : mix of cranberry, blueberry and strawberry juice. This was one of the show stopper drinks according to me. 
➡Kiwi Margarita : a blend of kiwi with lemonade. Very refreshing.
➡Virgin Sex on the Beach : mix of orange and cranberry. 
➡Blue lagoon : the usual. Tastes good. 
The food we ordered:
➡Asparagus Soup : thick and creamy soup. Tastes good. 
➡Afghani Chicken Tikka : very well cooked and the sauces served along with it deserves a special mention. They were fabulous. 
➡Tandoori Fish Tikka : the fish nearly melts in the mouth. Flavourful and absolutely delish. 
➡Sliced Mutton with Three Pepper sauce : the sauces were good and it's had a palatable flavour.
➡Oriental salt & pepper prawn  : top notch dish. This is definitely recommended. 
➡Paprika & Garlic Marinated Grilled Bhetki : big chunk of juicy fish. If you're a fish fan, you'll love it. 
➡Dal Makhani : perfect balance of the spices. Tasted good with the cheese Naan.
➡Dal Tadka 
➡Murg Aap ki Pasand Lababdar : the chicken was really soft and gravy was superb. This is definitely recommended. 
➡Cheese Naan & Peshawari Naan 
➡Fish & Chips : again the fish deserves a special mention. All their fish dishes are an absolute delight. 
➡Thai Green Curry Chicken : this was one of the best.  The flavour and consistency couldn't have been more right. Don't miss this out.
➡Kolkata Dum Biriyani : it was good and slightly low on the spices. 
And for desserts we opted for - 
➡Classic Cheesecake : topped with blueberry sauce this was super yum. 
➡ White chocolate mousse : had this till the last bite possible. This was so delectable.

Overall had a wonderful experience and a great time along with some of my friends. If you still haven't tried this unique eatery as of yet, go down to have a surreal gastronomic experience and explore the coal mines with great comfort.

A good find within Saltlake and thanks to Zomato for helping me locate this. This place is located at AD block and can enthral you with it’s out of the box interior. The restaurant is themed on a mining site with dim lights perfectly adding to the theme! For selfie enthusiasts, they also have props such as mining helmets & coal carriages.

Talking about food, this restaurant will not leave you spoilt for choices so you have to make your mind well before you step in. I found most guests ordering Indian dishes such as naan & Daal Makhani but we ordered Italian platter that had poached egg, chicken, prawns & mushroom (very much the same you get in Indian platter) but they added Risotto to give it an Italian essence. They added mutton kebabs in the platter which was a complete mismatch! The platter tasted good but I am not too happy with the assortment & the way it was prepared. Nonetheless, the staffs are courteous and the concept is unique. Good place & worth a visit!

Kolkata's first Mining concept resturant... They already set their level... As Fly Kouzina is one of the best vegetarian resturant in the town... Also those who visited the resturant knows about the ambience... It has perfect airplane theme... They already conquered the Air... Now it's time to conquer the underground... And another good news is... This time they are serving non veg too... It's a challenge for them to maintain the standards... But they are doing undoubtedly well... The ambience is amazing... Service is flawless... Now coming straight to the food & drinks...
We tried a long menu... 

❤ Asparagus Soup~ Extremely yummy... 

# Kaala Patthar~ Very well presented and tasted good too... 

# Xacuti Fried Fish Finger~ Nice one too... 

❤ Sliced Mutton with Three Pepper Sauce~ Excellent... 

# Oriental Pepper Sauce Prawns~ Tasted good... 

❤ Fish and Chips~ Very very tasty it was... 

From the Mains we had... 
"Laal Maas", "Murgh Aap Ki Pasand Lababdar", "Dal Makhani", "Dal Tadka", "Assorted Breads" and "Kolkata Dum Biriyani"... Among all I personally didn't like the biriyani that much... It need to improve a lot... Otherwise all were just delicious and yumm... Their breads are just insane... 

For a change we tried the "Thai Green Curry Chicken" & "Paprika & Garlic Marinated Grilled Kolkata Bhetki"... The green curry was just mind blowing... Prefect blend of lemongrass and coconut milk with succulent chicken chunks... Gone perfect with the streamed rice... But again the Bhetki was bit disappointing... Although the fish was extremely fresh... 

And from the favorite section... We had...
# Classic Cheesecake~ Very tasty... 
❤ White Chocolate Mousse~ Just insane... Must try from here... 

We also had some mocktails... I didn't remember the names... I personally ordered for the "Cold Coffee with Ice Cream"... And it was just too good... 

Overall an awesome experience... Will visit them again for sure...

I have always loved to visit themed cafes and restaurants and it’s a jubilation to see a bunch of options opening up in Kolkata, the most recent one being Kouzina Mining Co. The theme, as the name suggests, revolves around a mine with the dark and rustic interiors paired with raw wooden furniture and sequenced dull lights. The walls are lined with continuous lights just like in a mine. There are some quirky and relevant props as well like Miner hats, shovels and spades along with iconic quotes from movies and signboards, the whole shebang!

Starting our luncheon with some mocktails, we ordered Virgin Sex On The Beach, Cranberry Mojito and Jamaican Mojito. Of the above I would definitely recommend the Jamaican Mojito as it had subtle flavours and a nice mix of strawberry, lime and pineapple juice with mint spicy ginger syrup, which also provides a bit tangy taste.

For soups, we tried Asparagus Cream Soup and Man Chow Soup. I am really found of asparagus hence I absolutely loved it. If you are looking for something different, definitely recommended.

Coming to the starters, we had Jalapeno Cheese Balls, Mushrooms Duplex and Puktan Ke Sholey. All of these were totally amazing and surely worth your money. For cheese and mushroom lovers, these are a confident yes. Do not miss out on the special mango dip that is served with the kebabs.

For the main course, we ordered Shahi Malai Kofte with Cheese Naan. This naan is quite heavy to digest, so order accordingly, otherwise the taste of both was pretty good. We also tried the Asparagus & Cheese Risotto. Creamy asparagus and Arborio rice cooked to perfection. Just amazing.

For desserts, we had a Classic Cheesecake and White Chocolate Mousse. The cheesecake was nice. I personally preferred the mousse which had an appealing presentation and an apt texture.

The staff is friendly and service is swift. All over, the restaurant deserves 4.0 but an extra 0.5 for the theme and concept.

So folks that was about it from Kouzina Mining Co.
Check out my blog for a wholesome experience. Stay tuned and watch this space for more updates about restaurants in Kolkata.

And Be Suavy !!

Located in one of the lanes and bylanes of Salt Lake, the place was a little difficult for me to locate. Once you reach it, the decor that greets you is quite charming. Being a Mining themed restaurant, I can say they have done quite justice to the place. When you walk through the main gate, you can hear distinct shovels hitting the coal kind of sounds running in the backdrop. A narrow alley greets you first, which then takes you to the main dining area. The decor is very chic and calming. They also have added props like mining helmets and shovels to give your selfies an added boost. It feels very nice when you realize that the owners take care of the all the nittie gritties to make your experience a pleasant and satisfying one. 

Coming to the food, since we were a group of six, we opted for quite a lot of dishes. And thankfully this place had a LOT to offer.

Soup :

♧ Cream of Asparagus -  The consistency was thick and super creamy. 
♧ Man Chow - Go for this undoubtedly if you are craving oriental.

Mocktails :

♧ Barman's Pitcher - It has redbull in it and should be your choice if you are looking for that added zing.
♧ Green Apple Virgin Mojito - Very refreshing and thirst quenching.

Starters :

♧ Afghani Chicken Tikka - Soft and Tender.
♧ Kaala Patthar - Rectangular pieces of ashy chicken with the right amount of spices 
♧ Tandoori Fish Tikka - Melted right in my mouth and came with a special mango dip which was ahhhhmayzing.
♧ Xacuti Fried Fish Fingers 
♧ Oriental Pepper Salt Prawn - I LOVED it. It is so unlike any of the prawn dishes I ever tried so far. Tangy and soft.
♧ Paprika and Garlic Marinated Grilled Kolkata Bhetki - The name says it all.
 
Main Course :

♧ Fish and Chips - Tasted amazing.
♧ Assorted Breads - A must try.
♧ Dal Makhani - Very aromatic and filling.
♧ Thai Green Curry Chicken - It had the perfect blend of veggies, chicken and spices.

Dessert :

♧ White Chocolate Mousse - Apart from looking beautiful it tastes great too. 

All together the experience was too good. The ambience, the food, the management, everything seems top notch. It was a very satisfying lunch indeed.

Located at AD block Sector 1, Salt Lake, this place is a gem. As the name suggests, it is a mining themed restaurant. All the decorations are done accordingly. You can see mining helmets and other mining equipment around.

We ordered Asparagus Soup as an appetizer. This very first item won our heart! It was so tasty and smooth. Then we placed the order for Kaala Patthar and Xacuti Fried Fish Finger. The dish Kala Patthar was a chicken item. It was amazingly decorated and the taste was equally nice. Having these two chicken and fish starters, we craved for a mutton based starter and hence, we ordered for Galouti Kebab with Canopies. My friends ordered for Jheenga Khai Bari which was a prawn dish and Paprika and Garlic Marinated Grilled Kolkata Bhetki.

Then we moved on to main course items. As we didn't have much space left in our stomachs, we just ordered Kolkata Dum Biryani, Murgh Aap Ki Pasand Lababdar, some assorted breads such as Peshwari Nun.

We ordered some mocktails such as Jamaican Mojito and Green Apple drink. For desserts, we chose Classic Cheese Cake and White Chocolate Mousse.

The overall experience was simply amazing. Each food item was perfectly cooked. Their courteous staffs make your dining experience far better. Their cutlery sets along with the entire decorations will surely impress you.

Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

Ambience - A new concept of mining and digging into new concept of food. 

Service - Attendants are very friendly and helpful.

Rate - Appropriate

10.KOLKATA BHETKI : Paprika and garlic marinated ,this was one of the best bhetki dishes I had. Do try it out .

11.KOLKATA DUM BIRIYANI : Our main course , wouldn't have been complete without a Biriyani delicacy and it was unexpectedly good.

I have been to Fly Kouzina before and now I gave Kouzina Mining Co. a visit. Both different themed restaurant owned and run by the same management team, is doing a pretty good job when it comes to food.
My experience has been equally good. And by equally I mean I really loved it. One will know if he ever happened to read my Fly Kouzina review.

Started off with Cream of Asparagus Soup. I personally do not like asparagus much but how surprisingly I loved this soup. I mean the flavour of garlic blended in it tasted super good. One of the best soups I have ever tried.
I ordered Berry Blast from their mocktail menu. It was good but given the sweetness dominated the sourness, I'd have preferred the other way round.

For starters I will definitely recommend to go with the Xacuti Fried Fish Finger. Prawn Lovers must try the Oriental Pepper Salt Prawn. And the mango dip they provide with it is out of the world!
Fish & Chips were also good but doesn't stand out in comparison to the other delightful stuff.
I just cannot get enough of Kouzina's Dal Makhani along with their Cheese Garlic Naan.
This time I tried their Thai Green Curry and it didn't disappoint either.
Only the Kolkata Dum Biryani was not upto the mark hence, 4.5.

For desserts, even though I am personally not at all a fan of white chocolate, I happened to like their White Chocolate Mousse. Especially because of the blueberry sauce they garnish it with.
And Cheesecakes are always my favourite thing in the world and there couldn't have been a better way to have ended my meal other than their Classic Blueberry Cheesecake.

Chicken Afghani tikka
Fish and chips
Lachcha paratha

The theme of the restaurant came out pretty well. They have a great mouthwatering varieties in their menu. Ambience is classy with peppy music at its background. Quite spacious. Comfortable seating. Cutlery were interesting. The staffs were courteous and helpful.

Manchow Soup: It had a tangy and spicy taste. It had good portions of shredded chicken. The Soup had a perfect flavour to it.

BEVERAGES:-
Lychee Colada: Lychee and Coconut milk gave a lingering sweet feel in the mouth.

Virgin Mojito:  Its a great summer time drink. The sweet taste accompanied by the fragrance of Mint and the addition of tangy lime makes for a really refreshing drink.

Overall my experience was quite good. Food & Service are both top notch. 
A must visit for everyone. :)

Visited today with a group of friends . Amazed at the concept . Loved the theme and the ambience . You literally feel like you are dining in a under construction tunnel . 

We started off with the Asparagus Soup which was very creamy and we loved it . We ordered a variety of starters next , pick of the lot being : 

⚫️Afghani Chicken Tikka 
⚫️Tandoori Fish Tikka 
⚫️Oriental pepper Salt prawn 

These three were amazing . You have to try all three when you visit this place . 

Coming to the mains , we ordered Continental and North Indian both . 

⚫️Paprika and Garlic marinated Grilled Bhetki 
⚫️Dal Makhani 
⚫️Lal Maas 
⚫️ Fish n Chips 

Each item had a flavour of its own and we couldn't point out a single flaw . Commendable 👍 

I also ordered Shirley's Temple for myself which was a bit if disappointment . But when you get such good food , we can ignore an odd mocktail . 

And the best part was the blueberry CheeseCake . Wowww . You don't find such amazing CheeseCake anywhere barring a few places . Full marks 😍😍

Service was prompt and quick . KTT time was also quick . The server's were helpful . 

All in all , a place you have to visit with your friends and family .

This place is definitely one of the best themed restaurants in the city, depicting a coal mine. The beautifully designed interiors set the mood for a perfect meal. This is located near Island No 3, Salt Lake and offers a vast array of delicacies from North Indian, Oriental and Continental Cuisines.

The dishes which I had here are :

| Mocktail |

• Shirley Temple - This was served in a tall glass and was a mix of grenadine, lime juice and sprite. The drink was slightly tangy, chilled and refreshing.

| Soup |

• Chicken Manchow Soup - The soup was light and flavourful. There were abundant chicken pieces in the broth. The crispy noodles tasted great with the soup.

| Appetizers |

• Kaala Patthar - Though the name isn't appealing, it tasted great. Chicken Satays were served in a glass. The chicken was spicy and well cooked.

• Sliced Mutton in Black Pepper Sauce - Mutton slices were marinated with soya sauce and cooked with garlic and black pepper. It tasted amazing. The mutton was a little tough in texture, but that's how it was supposed to be.

• Xacuti Fried Fish Fingers - Fish fingers were crumb fried and served with tartar sauce. The fish was very soft and juicy.

• Tandoori Fish Tikka - This was smoked Bhetki served with a spicy coriander sauce and a mango mayo sauce. The fish was smokey and had an amazing texture. But what I loved the most was the slightly sweet mango mayo sauce.

| Main Course |

• Paprika and Garlic Marinated Kolkata Bhetki - The fish won my heart in terms of texture. The lemon butter sauce was beautiful. The potato mash was smooth and creamy. This is something one must try here !

• Thai Green Curry - The curry was fragrant and well cooked. It was slightly on the sweeter side, but tasted good.

• Dal Makhani - The dal was rich and creamy.

• Lal Maas - The mutton was soft and tasted amazing. The gravy was lipsmacking.

• Bread Basket - I tried the Peshawari Naan, which was sweet and the Cheese Naan, both of which were nice and tasted great.

| Desserts |

• Cheese Cake - This was perfect and had a beautiful texture. The blueberry compote tasted good as well.

• White Chocolate Mousse - You can't leave this place without trying this out. Yes, this is that good ! White chocolate mousse was topped with passion fruit syrup. It tasted heavenly.

Overall, being a new restaurant, this place is quite impressive. The service is of top notch. The quality and quantity of food is equally good. Would definitely come back soon 😍

The newest addition to the Kouzina family is this (gold) mine of a restaurant! Yes, it's a themed restaurant and it's themed as a mine, complete with miners' hats, shovels, Men at Work signs, iron caged dim yellow lights and hustling mining sounds at the entrance. The interior is really well thought out and the ambience does make you feel like you're dining underground inside a mine. Even the plates have ghis beautiful stone polished finish to add to the over all theme.
Coming to the food, we tried :
Starters:
1. Cream of Asparagus Soup : Thin and light but creamy, with a good hit of garlic. (4/5)
2. Afghani Chicken Tikka : Big, succulent chunks of chicken marinated in a flavorful and creamy yogurt marinade and grilled to perfection. This one is completely safe to order. (4.5/5)
3. Xacuti Fried Fish Fingers : Juicy chunks of fish coated in a spicy, flavor packed crumb and crispy fried. It was served in a Martini glass on a bed of greens. Quirky and Delicious. (5/5)
4. Sliced Mutton is Three Pepper Sauce : Generous slices of mutton coated in a sweet, sticky, tangy sauce. The meat was over cooked and chewy but the sauce was delicious. (3.5/5)
5. Jhinga Khai Bari : Large prawns grilled in a spicy yogurt marinade. (4.5/5)

Main Course:
6. Dal Makhani : Creamy dal with a good hit of sweetness as well as heat from the subtle spices. (5/5)
7. Cheese Naan : Absolutely awesome. Soft naans baked with grated cheese on top till the crust goes golden and crispy in the edges. Must try. (5/5)
8. Pudina Naan : Pudina Crusted soft naans. Really good. (4.5/5)
9. Murgh Lababdar : Succulent boneless chicken in creamy gravy with some heavy heat of spices. (4/5)
10. Thai Green Curry with Steamed Rice : Rich, thick, coconut flavored curry, with a subtle hit of lime. A little more lemon flavor would be great. (3.5/5)
11. Kolkata Dum Biriyani : Light Biriyani with a heavenly aroma of ghee. Not like the usual Kolkata Biriyani. Give this a try. (4/5)

Desserts :
12. Cheesecake : Beautifully presented with a thin biscuit base under a soft cheesecake topped with tangy berry compote. Tasted decent. (3/5)
13. White Chocolate Mousse : Generous scoops of white chocolate mousse with a berry compote, beautifully decorated and served in a martini glass. (3/5)

Drink :
14. Litchi Colada : Litchi juice and concentrate blended with vanilla ice cream. It was nearly warm when served. Could taste better with a little more ice cream (3.5/5)

The service is really courteous and efficient. The staff are friendly and communicative besides being nicely attentive and caring.

Prices are decent.

Overall a beautiful experience. Do visit this place with your gang!

Few miles away from Ultadanga. Kouzina Mining Co is located near 3 no island. Ambience is cool and different from other restaurant. Coal Mine theme of the restaurant is too attractive. Started with Manchow Soup. It was hot and tasty. Kaala Patthar is a theme dish of chicken. It's was really juicy. Next one was Galauti Kabab with canopies. It was soft and mouth melting.Xacuti Fried fish fingers were also good.Fish and Chips were crisp and lipsmacking.I had Virgin Margarita with Kiwi. It was chilled and refreshing. In Main courses  Murgh Aap Ki Pasand Lababdar, Kolkata Bhetki,Dal Tarka were good. In breads we had  Peshawari Naan, Cheese naan. Peshawri naan was mind blowing. Finished the feast with Classic cheese cake and White Chocolate Mousse. Mousse was  exceptional. Service was also very good.

Located at a stones throw from City centre, you will be greeted by warm smiles from the doorstep! The kouzina mining Co. Is quite a quirky restaurant with an eye catching ambience and decor! 

We had a wide spread of elaborate dishes ordered for us and it was quite a lavish meal! 

Now coming to the food and beverages, they were quite delectable and i loved each and every dish! 

-- The chicken manchow soup served as the perfect kickstart. It was quite light and tasted well with generous proportions of chicken and eggs. 

-- the Afghani chicken tikka is something which you should definitely have. The chicken pieces were tender and succulent,. I personally Loved this dish and it came along with a fine dip. 

-- The kaala pathar is basically your chicken skewer's and the chicken was well marinated and the quantity of sauce used was just perfect! 

-- The galouti kebab with canopies was really good. The presentation of this dish was highly commendable. 

-- The fried fish finger is an extremely well decorated, well prepared and quite the well presented dish so you wouldn't want to miss this one out! 

-- The marinated grilling Kolkata bhetki was extremely tender. It was just perfect and the proportion wss more than generous. 

-- The fish and chips was a classic! The size of the fish was worth the appreciation. 

-- The Kolkata dum biriyani was pretty light in terms of oil and it was quite stomach friendly. One portion is good enough for 3 people. 

-- The assorted breads platter was a pretty good order. It consisted of laccha paratha, cheese naan, peshawari naan and there was one more variant of nun. This is definitely a good buy if you are coming in a group. 

-- The classic cheesecake was definitely a classic in every sense and was worth the hype. 

-- among the mocktails, i had ordered a kiwi virjin margarita. The presentation, preparation and the taste was really good. Definitely a must have. It was quite pretty to look at too .

This restaurant is quite spacious and being located at a prime place is definitely a big plus point. Looking forward to my next visit!

First things first, the place has a really good ambience. It has a coal mining theme and the execution has been really good. The service was also satisfactory.
               We tried Munchow soup which was really good. For starters we ordered Afghani Chicken Tikka, Tandoori Fish Tikka and Galouti Kebab with canopies. All the dishes were pretty good and the Afghani Chicken Kebab was nothing short of outstanding.
              For the main course we tried Laal Maas, Dal Makhani with Lachcha Paratha and Pudina Paratha. We also tried out Mutton Kolkata Dum Biryani and also had Fish and Chips. Really no complaints with any of the items, I specially loved the fish and chips that they serve.
             I went for Virgin Safe Sex on the beach for mocktail and it was really refreshing and I definitely recommend it.
             For desserts we had Classic Cheese Cake and White Chocolate Mousse. The White Chocolate Mousse was absolutely lip smacking.

FINAL VERDICT- I would definitely recommend this place to all and must say that it is a great themed restaurant to visit.

The interiors look like inside of a mine and the decor and cutlery match the theme. The servers are prompt and well mannered. Coming to the food, the menu was not very different, a typical multi cuisine restaurant/ cafe menu. The taste though is good. All dishes were well prepared. We had the killer corn kabab. The aam sattu dip with it was excellent. The cochiolgle pasta dish with mushroom and broccoli sauce and saffron was good too. The Mezze platter was fine too. But the show stealer was asparagus and cheese risotto. The rice was good and you could actually taste the asparagus in it. 
Can go here!

I visited this place for lunch with a couple of friends and was absolutely bowled over by the innovative decor and the varied dishes they offer. The interiors mimic a coal mine somewhat and the props are in accordance with the theme. Located a few paces from the city centre one, this place serves Italian, North Indian as well as Chinese cuisine. We decided not to stick to any particular cuisine and ordered accordingly. For starters we ordered chicken manchow soup. It was delicious with the right balance of flavours and we loved it. Then we ordered afghani chicken tikka and oriental pepper salt prawn, both of which were superb in taste and left us wanting for more. With sliced mutton in three pepper sauce we were in for a treat. I personally loved the preparation.
For the main course, we ordered fish and chips (quite a plateful this was and lip smacking), dum biriyani and thai green curry chicken. The last one was the star of the day. Smooth and creamy, the thai green curry was to die for. With this I had berry blast and it was decent.
We were too full to take desserts but ultimately did take the white chocolate mousse and it was heavenly and I can go back to this place just for this dessert.
Overall a wonderful experience... great ambience, attentive staff and delicious food. The prices are on the steeper side but the food absolutely makes up for it.

Diners turned Miners...

We dug deep in the main course - Non vegetarian Lasagna and Pan seared Chicken Breast with Jus.
Courteous service
Innovative Themed decor - Inside a Coal Mine
Good Food
Cozy Ambiance

However they disappointed us with a Not Available reply for Deep Fried Ice Cream as dessert.

I guess they need to equip their kitchen and upgrade their chef to make all items on the Menu available for foodies dislike getting a NO for an answer.

We arrived on Sunday evening,  half an hour before it's opening time at 6.30p.m. So we decided to come back in another hour.  Well, in that one hour it got filled up and we had to wait to get seats. So that's how crowded it gets on Sundays. 
The restaurant is located near its veg counterpart (Fly Kouzina) in AD block,  and the prices are pretty much the same. 
The interiors are themed on coal mine,  and they have used audio cues for simulation. Personally,  I did feel the tables are a little crammed up.  The staffs were courteous and kept checking on us to see if we need anything. 
We ordered Jamaican Mojito, Crispy chilly babycorns, Veg Pad Thai noodles and Cheesecake.  Absolutely loved it. 
Highly recommended. 
First aircraft, then coal mine,  lets see what theme they come up with next.

Finally went here for lunch yesterday after a failed attempt earlier last month thanks to them being closed for renovation. The decor does resemble that of a coal mine. Ambience is good. Staff is courteous.
We ordered carbonated mezze platter,spaghetti chicken bolognese,paprika and garlic marinated grilled kolkata bhetki. Dishes were good. Price is on the higher end. Glad that this counterpart has non veg options.

Ambience: As the name says, it is designed to make one feel like being in a mine. Dim lit restaurant with wooden planks on the wall..

Food: I went there for the third time and the food was  as nice as during my earlier visits. Double thumbs up for Thai curry and Paneer Tikka.

Service: The servers are polite and attentive. Thumbs up again.

Reasonably priced, the restaurant is definitely worth visiting multiple times (for me) :)

Very bad experience here. Was very much excited to be there, but all goes in vain. Starting from the front door.

Ambience - good, well decorated
Service- average,
Food- poor.

We ordered for crispy mushroom and babycorn, then Panfried paneer, fish tikka, veg biriyani, paneer lababdar, veg noodles.
They missed to give mushroom in the dish, the starters were too hot and spicy, we are literally crying. Biriyani smells something different, little smoky don't know about the vegetables in the biriyani. It's a really bad thing. We lastly ordered a cheese cake, but our mood is already gone.
Overall a overpriced restaurant which is not up to the mark in food quality and taste and service.

Great place to spend time with family and friends. i simply loved this place. Unique interior will make you feel you are in a coal mine. they even have coal mine sound effect.  It is a thrilling experience having food inside a coal mine. Food was awesome specially Paneer Tikka and Bhatti ke aloo. Dal Makhani is the best I ever had in Kolkata. I liked Litchi Colada Mocktail very much. Peshawari Naan is the one which you must try here. Cheese Cake is simply awesome. Service is fast and staffs are also very attentive. We enjoyed every bit of our stay. we would love to come back soon.

Went there on a Friday evening and the place was packed. It is a coal mine themed restaurant ( theme was largely on the outside where you have equipment and sound of coal mine). The interiors didn't seem very coal mineish considering fly kouzina.
We had 
1. Paneer Banjara Tikka - This was downright amazing- very flavourful and tender paneer piece which went well with the accompanied dip.
2. Amritsari Bhatti ke a look - This was also very good and spicy. The cued based sweetish white dip was also bang on.
 Now the part which was a bit messed up. The mains
3. Dhingri mutter - This was very bad. Bland and despite a request for amendments it turned out to be same on re arrival with a strong doubt whether it was corrected at all or not or was is it just heated.They didn't end up charging us for this dish as we had returned more than half of it owing to blandness even after them changing it ( not sure if they did).
4. Chicken bharta - The gravy was delicious and I could easily have had the breads with just the gravy. The chicken provided was super dry and this did let an otherwise super dish down. Charging Rs500 for a chicken bharta and giving super dry chicken is not good.
The breads were bang on.
Starters 5/5
Mains 2/5
Ambiance 3.5/5
Service - 5/5
Pricing 3/5 ( can't get over the 500 rupees bharta) 
The staff seemed to be very helpful and it was clear that they were trying really hard.

Is this a place i might go again? Maybe.
Wishing the team of Kouzina Mining Co. all the best going ahead.

I’m sure that this place is going to be one of the many famed names in the Kolkata food arena. I went to the Kouzina Minning with my office collegues on a Friday evning.
Dark and soothing the ambiance is perfect for a early weekend dinner. Service was prompt and to the mark. Though the place was crowded, we were swiftly attended. Coming to the food. It’s one of the best place to try continental dishes. If you are a foodie interested in continental line up this place is sure to tantalize your taste buds...Must try is the Italian., Grilled Bhekti is one of the best here and u can wash it down with some Mocktails like Berry Blast, Orange Mojito if you want. Price is slightly on the higher side of the graph but the food is worth it. This place is going to bamboozle you with its menu.

Last night we visited this place. Their warm hospitality, interiors and professional  service will immediately life up your mood. The theme is really uncommon and we all enjoyed our stay there. we had very good time and took a lot of pictures putting the mining helmets on. Now coming to food I should say that their Indian food is too good. we had Dal makhani, Paneer Lababder and Chana. Garlic Naan and Masala Kulcha were awesome. Mocktails were also very well presented and tasted perfect. over all it was a good experience. Good luck

Kouzina Mining Kolkata is Kolkata’s newest luxury restaurant near Salt lake island number 3 

Kouzina Mining is a 86 seater restaurant.

Ambience - Very classy and sophisticated and well decorated with cosy sitting arrangements, mellow lighting and music would made your day.

Staffs & Service - Staffs are well trained, courteous and service was prompt.

Virgin mojito - A non-alcoholic drink with mint, lemon, sugar syrup, was very refreshing and a perfect thirst quencher.

Berry blast- A non-alcoholic drink with berry flavour was very refreshing and cool.

Maharani Platter- Vegetarian platter which serves Paneer tikka, Tandoori Aloo, Tandoori Gobi and Corn Tikki is awesome. 

Maharaja Platter- A Non-veg kebab platter which serves Tandoori Prawn, Fish Tikka and Chicken tikka is a unique dish to order.

Murg Biryani – well cooked, aromatic and very yummy with succulent meat pieces.

Dal Makhanii & Peshawari naan – Black lentil dal preparation which was very thick as well as tasty. It was served with Peshwari Naan.

Cheese Cake is simply mind blowing and enjoyable. White Chocolate Mousse was yummy with a perfect sweetness balance. So don't waste time and come here and enjoy the atmosphere and food. 

Thanks to the Kouzina Mining team for their warm reception and hospitality.

Their warm hospitality, and extremely neat interiors and systematic service will immediately life up your mood. I've been here twice in last two months  On our first visit we tried Veg Hakka Noodles and Hot Garlic Chicken. The quantity was more than enough. Coming to the quality,it is the best among all the Chinese joints I've tried so far in Salt Lake. Not too greasy, or saucy, Good food and amiable staffs. Full points on cleanliness. 

On our next visit we tried the North Indian delicacies that were on the menu. We had ordered, Fish Tikka and Chicken Tandoori for starters and Butter Chicken with Peshawari Naan for the main course. 

And we were surprised. they stand out for their Indian menu as well. Every dish was extremely flavorful. The fish was fresh, juicy nicely cooked. So was the chicken, not too dry not too spicy. Just like you'd love to enjoy it. 

The prices are decent for the quantity and quality that they offer I would say. Looking forward to more such visits.

Came here for lunch. The restaurant was full with customers -which is a good sign -No doubt. Ordered "Carbonated Mezze Platter"-a dish which should be boycotted from the menu. Complete waste of money -it was tasteless and not served hot.
Why do I still rate it 3.5?-Because the kadhai paneer and kulcha was fine. So you can go here but do not experiment with multi-cuisines even if the staff affirms any particular dish! Safely try the patent north indian and be happy. The staff are otherwise hospitable and well behaved.

The ambiance is great. A perfect place to spend time with family and friends. The staffs are courteous and helpful with the dishes. The coal mine interior has an appealing effect.

Cream of Asparagus. It is a thick soup with green gravy. It did not have too much masala. It was mild and easy to the taste buds. 

Maharani Kebab Platter. Soft succulent kebabs which were "melt in the mouth" delicious. The masalas had not overpowered the taste.
Mocktails are very well presented. and good to taste.

Overall a very good experience. A must visit for foodies.

There are absolutely few places you can go to in Kolkata with the assumption of never being disappointed. Kouzina Mining is definitely tops that list. 
 
From the Kala Pathar to the Mutton Galouti Kebab, the dishes stay in your aftertaste for a long time. I'm someone who prefers Pasta I can say this with confidence, the Pastas here are one of the best you'll ever taste.  
Top that with the ambience and the class, a good dinner or lunch (or anything in between) deserves a Kouzina Mining experience if you've not had it in the past.

Cool and cozy place. Absolutely new concept of decor. As I entered the restaurant I felt like I'm in a coal mine. They even have coal mine helmets. The sound effect at the entrance is awesome. Cool music inside. Food quality is equally good. We had Italian and Continental dishes. Pastas are delicious and presentation of Continental dishes are good. Virgin Mojito is a very common Mocktail but I liked it here.  We even tried Lemon Iced Tea which was equally good. Staffs are courteous and service is fast. It was a good experience having dinner at Kouzina Mining Restaurant. Good luck and keep up your good work.

Ambience and staff courtesy gets a thumbs up but when it comes to food... it immediately requires some intervention by the management. End of it we go for food and not just the look and feel which makes it only a one time visit. Quality of chicken- ‘stale’. Most of the mutton starters were not available.. all food items were too highly priced compared to the quantity. Packaged water was also overpriced ... it includes ‘establishment charges’... don’t know what it is, what we know is packaged water is supposed to be sold at mrp. To summarise- you get much better quality / quantity food in other TOP RESTAURANTS of Kolkata at this price.

Eating inside a coal mine wearing mining helmets is a thrilling experience. Only thing is that this place is very crowded. Good to see a new restaurant doing so well. We had kebabs and Mocktails. Kebabs are delicious. Mocktails are also good. Service staffs are always attending with smiling face which I think gives a lot of positive energy. Great place to visit. 10 on 10.

Prison themed restaurant. Ocean themed restaurant. Airplane themed restaurant. Joining the bandwagon of themed restaurants in Kolkata is Kouzina Mining Company - the coal mine themed restaurant. Don't be disillusioned by the "Kouzina" brand name - this is a completely non vegetarian restaurant! :P

Located quite conveniently in Salt Lake AD block, it is quite a spacious a multi cuisined restaurant. The decor is without a doubt first rate - dark walls with graffiti, dark ambience, bulbs for lighting such as one might use in actual coal mines, coasters with famous coal mine related movie trivias, even sound effect of a coal mine.

Food is very expensive, but not exactly overpriced. The pasta in red sauce was excellent, and the Thai green curry was sumptuous - very authentic flavours!

Staff is excellent - very courteous and helpful. All in all, if you don't mind a bit of a pocket pinch in order to try out some good food, surely go ahead!

Kouzina mining is the younger sibling of Fly Kouzina, and located very close to it. They have tried to recreate a mining experience here, with trolley tracks, dark ambience helmets, mining sounds,etc. However, since this is the inception, they haven't yet launched happy hours or next visit discount like Fly Kouzina.
Otherwise in culinary department ,they are at par. We tried Jamaican mojito, chilly fried corn and pad Thai noodles. The Mojito was a delight, and the noodles were great.
It got crowded quickly by 8, but the service was still prompt.The only reason I am rating this one 3.5 and Fly Kouzina 4 is because the pocket pinch is stiffer here.That,and we liked Fly's bright interior better. This one is roomy, but also seats more people. Fly has a more private setting with facing couches,while this one has an open setting; its difficult to chat in midst of a noisy crowd.

I feel like sharing an incident. Four guys were seated in the adjacent table. They ordered a few dishes and were served soup first. Apparently they didn't like it. So, all four of them decided to leave. It was already half an hour past the placement of order and surely,most of their items were ready to serve. But they just abruptly left expressing their disgust over the soup. On enquiry, the manager informed me they neither paid for the soup nor offered to pay for it. It was sad to see.
Very often, restaurants get bad rep because of poor service. But there are also some very unsavoury customers who get away with equally bad behaviour or worse. I hope Zomato becomes a platform like Uber some day, where the both the service provider and customer can rate each other. I for once, wouldn't like to share an evening with such people.

Today as I was passing from Saltlake, Kouzina Mining Co. caught my eyes. Just from the outset it looked damn attractive the whole setup of Entering a Mine. The Interiors are as per the theme low light, Helmets hung on the walls, Trolleys carrying Coal etc.
- 
Now for the Food Part... The Menu is spread over 3 Cuisine Indian, Italian and Oriental. Right from the Appetisers to Moctails u can have lots of varieties. 
I am Vegeterian so i would stick to veg food only as they offer both veg and non veg food. The Food was great as it comes from the same banner alike Fly Kouzina.
 I munched on jalapeño cheese rolls and Asparagus cream Soup and Creamy Corn soup Wid noodles followed by Vilayati Subji Takatin and Aloo Dum( my Hubby’s favourite ) with Stuffed Kulcha and Cheese Naan.
-
The Staff was very courteous and the service was brisk.@vinaysrimal
 Parking is not a problem here in saltlake. In Total it was a great Experience👍
So Definitely I want to visit it Next Time too

The place has been built on the concept of mines. And my knowledge on the matter also increased due to the fact that they include lot of mining related terms and pictures on the wall. So well done on the research for that. Then we have the food which is pretty decent. I didn't find it too extraordinary but was decent to eat. Though i didn't find Nachos at the level which is expected. So big thumbs down on that. Then we have the staff who are very responsive and even if i ask something from a person who is not serving my table they make sure the table gets what they asked for which is what i look for in any restaurant as its a comfort that i need. So the management is good and so overall a very good experience.

We went to this restaurant on a weeknight and we reserved our tables before reaching there. Place was moderately crowded. Interiors are designed to give you the feel of a mine but not done so well. Little more light should have been better for a family dining restaurant. Staff is courteous but poorly trained. We decided to order some soups manchow and tomato and simple basket of fries. Manchow was good and tomato was ok - too watery. Basket of fries was as usual frozen McCain ones. For main course we ordered paneer, Dal Makhani, breads and Hakka chow. Service was pretty quick and food came within 15 mins. Paneer was a bit hard and dal was really good. Breads were standard. Hakka chow was really good and probably best dish of the day. Little too expensive for the kind of restaurant it is. Though we didn’t try much - probably next time but with little improvement this place can become a good diner like it’s other outlet fly kouzina.

This place is reminiscent of the films like KalaPathar & Gunday.. The mining co. used right from the sound, to the use of helmets, to the use of meshes all around & finally its evident on the cutlery used. Lets start the Gupshup:

Ambience:
Perfect mining feelers from the word go.. Loved the concept of using different theme based restaurants. And following it is a task coz even the cutlery used were black with hints of white. Made me feel like am dining on the cobwebbed plates!

Moving on to the Food:

So this place had really good starters but fails terribly when it comes to Cooking Italian. Here’s what we ordered:

Crispy Chilli Babycorn: Twas crisp and yum. Clever use of sauce and garlic enhanced the flavours.

Tomato soup: This soup was presented with lid over it and twas piping hot. My camera captured the smoke oozing out of the bowl. Tasted equally good.

Crispy Aloo: The aloo had gone lil soggy as twas tossed in honey and other sauces. Taste wise twas nice.

Corn Chikli Pasta: I really dint understand the word Chikli coined in this dish. It had no chilli if that’s what the staff meant. Coz the dish was absolutely creamy sans veggies. Another weird thing was the menu promises pasta with veggies which sadly is missing coz we din ask for it. Only if you ask for the veggies will you get it. Otherwise be happy with the Chikli( fool) they make out of u when u place the order for this dish..

Pesto Pasta: Pesto Pasta was yet next level creamy pasta with scarce use of pesto. A suggestion: please remove the word Pesto from the menu and save us from ordering and then getting disappointed.

Corn Tikki: Corn Tikki was slightly sweet and had mango chutney served with it. Was good in taste and the sweetness of corn went well with the dip.

Service & Pocket Pinch: The Service is quick and the staff are courteous. Given the main course experience, methinks the price quoted is on the higher side. I feel Fly Kouzina is way better in terms of main course & starters!

I had a great experience here. Not only the staff were polite and friendly but their food was also praise worthy. Also the presentation took the added point. For me the prensentation is very important. Tried their crunchy fried chicken and butter garlic prawn. Herb wrapped grilled chicken with 
 couscous. Grilled fresh water prawn catalina style. Pan seared chicken breast with jus. They recommended a dish of mutton. I dont really know the name but it was the best. I loved the food. The ambience. The light. It was value for money as the total cost came around 4000 for a group of 5. Would definitely visit again.

1. Food quantity/servings are minuscule. 1 portion would barely suffice 2 people

2. Very congested, and becomes extremely noisy if tables are filled with people. Bad furniture, unbalanced tables, uncomfortable chairs

3. Food prices are over the roof. 3 starters n 3 main course dishes cost us over 5000 INR, not to talk of the forced service charges

4. Washroom entrance is too congested. You need to stand in a queue ;)

5. Staff is ok. They try to pass Italian as continental, oriental items as Italian. A fried rice we had was fried in GHEE :)

6. A single slice of cheese cake, which was mostly stale or not fresh, costs 300 (incl tax). A glass of fresh lime soda costs 160(incl tax).

Overall, daylight robbery for under par food.

Very high rates for not such delightful food. Starters (xacuti fish finger, chicken kala patthar and mushroom duplex) were very less in quantity and not worth the high price. Service was quite slow too, testing our patience each time. In main course we had ordered pasta, pad Thai noodles and chicken fried rice which were good but still we could not justify the high price tags. Only positive was the decor and music. They were providing with safety helmet for posing for pics. Staff were courteous never the less.

Worst start-ups...The new joint of the fly couzina in d name kouzina mining Co. is just pathetic.. Service is so bad that the water took 10 minutes to come...We were 12 people n only one waiter was serving us.. Coming to the food, all d soups were awesome, bt the main course (indian) was below average... Considering the prices they r charging its not worth half of it guys..So people.can skip dis for a change

This is the second themed restaurant from the Fly Kouzina brand. Loved the theme of mining as they placed quotes from movies like Kala Pathhar & Mckenna’s Gold which had mining as a backdrop. Coming back to the ambience, its great. Food and service are both top notch.

Let me start with the decor
As the name suggests, the ambience is kind of a mining place, helmets are also kept for the show to make it more like a proper underground mining state.
Price was averagely kept according to the quantity and quality.
Would like to repeat my visit.
Had tried north indian, next should be italian probably.

Oh , I just loved this place. From food to ambiance to staff everything was amazing. They had personalised plates with a diffferent quote on every plate. There were quotes written over walls, all around. The dim lighting and the decor was going with the name. The staffs were well dressed and courteous. The cleanliness was adequate. The food!!! The quantity, quality and taste of the food, was perfect. A must visit.

This place is new. .  It has beautiful  interior as the name suggests,  like that of a coal mine and at  the entrance  they have some machinery  music playing.  We visited this place yesterday .  I and my father had my birthday.  It's a great place for family dinner.  Decor and cutlery  are pretty.  Staff is courteous.  But most importantly,  the food is lip smacking good.  And the quantity  is even great.  Best dal makhani  and paneer lababdar  I had recently.  Best place according  to me in recent  times.  We feasted,  like literally.  10 of us were there,  and the bill was only around 4k. This is quite reasonable.  Very good place. Current favorite.  Just one tip,  please introduce more Indian breads and If possible play some music in the background.  Anyways,  Marvellous ,  that's the word which describes  our experience.  Keep the good work going on!

Went with friends for dinner. I have been to Fly Kouzina quite a number of times and keep ordering at home too. So given that this place is from the same group, we expected good food. And yes, the food almost lived upto our expectation. But there's definitely scope for improvement. The menu is very much similar to that of Fly Kouzina and has a good variety to offer. The portion size can be larger. The place has a grungy look and feel but the ambience doesn't really stand out. Now coming to service which is very important as it can either bring a place down or really take it up. And this place can go down if they do not improve the service. Our breads were at the table before vegetables and by the time our vegetables and dal arrived and were served to us, the breads were all hard and inedible. So despite the good taste of the food, you don't enjoy it. So yes, overall a decent place to go with family or friends.

An impromptu luncheon found me at Kouzina Mining Company with my friend and her family. The restaurant is another one to join the culture of themed dining. The wine glasses and plastic slippery coasters aside, pretty much everything tries to give you the vibe of a mine. As a fan of yellow lights, I loved the ambience! You could also pose with helmets and shovels if you were so inclined.

-The portions for appetizers (Mushroom Duplex and Jalapeno Cheese Balls) were rather small though the food in itself was worth savouring. 

-Cottage Cheese Steak was a novelty to me and I liked it despite the occasionally burnt bits that were to be found here and there. 

-Mint Lemonade was as refreshing as I expected it to be.

Service was pleasant and fast. Located just off island number 3, this place is hard to miss and a welcome addition to Salt Lake's new crop of restaurants. I thoroughly enjoyed the various experiments with vegetarian food that the menu had to offer.

As the name suggests, the place is a "theme based" restaurant with its interiors trying to resemble that of a coal mine. The place is owned by the same person who runs Fly Kouzina and is located near 3rd number island in Salt Lake City ( 50m from to Fly Kouzina). 

On visiting the place I realized why it has gained so much popularity in such a short span of time. The interiors were very good, however they do not exactly resemble a coal mine. We ordered Cottage Cheese Satay, Panner Banjara Tikka, mixed sauce pasta (penne), Subz Jhalfrezi, Blue Lagoon and Tandoori Roti. The service was pretty fast and the food was very tasty with Cottage cheese satay being the best of them all.

Pros - Nice ambiance, fast service, friendly staff, perfect family restaurant.

Cons - The interiors could have been a little better to resemble more like a coal mine.

Ambiance- excellent. 
Theme- fun. Perfect for pics with shovels and helmets with search lights as props.
Food- average. Butter naan had no butter. Very tasty chicken malai kebab. Very tasty white gravy of methi Chicken korma. Cheese naan and kulcha was not upto mark. Indian bread section was weak.
Staff - very polite and mannered.
Cutlery - glass was stylish but spoon fork kept falling off.
Interior - tables, wall decor, dim amber lighting were all classy.

Let's start with the ambience - it's just delightful to sit in a themed restaurant to have quality food. There are separate entry n exit points and the tracks are made exactly like a coal mine. The dim lights and graffiti makes you feel the essence of the mine. All in all, it's a well thought and well crafted theme. 
Coming to the most important part - food - the best part about the food is the wide variety on offer. So we were in a group with everyone having varied tastes and the variety was such that everyone could order as per their liking... At the same time generally you find a certain cuisine better than the other in a lot of restaurants, well it wasn't the case here. Everything ordered was so delightful and relishing that we couldn't figure which one was better. 
Add to that the super friendly staff (miners as they call them) who went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. 
This is a place which is definitely going to be visited by us quite frequently. Very Refreshing!!! Highly recommended!!!

Themed restaurants are talk of the town since last couple of years. The latest kid in the block is this cozy place in Salt Lake Sector 1...Well, went to this place tonight for dinner with family; Must say that wasn't expecting to wait for almost 45 mins to get a table at this newly opened restaurant... 
Once we were in, we were not very much impressed with the interiors and grafittis. Apart from the crockery nothing was much to relate with a colliery themed restaurant...
As far as the food is concerned, that zone is definitely something which will surely overcome all the minuses... Whether it was their juicy appetizers like Dahi Jeera Ki Tikki or Jalepono Cheese Balls , or their main course dishes, all were toothsome. Special Mention for the Italian dishes especially Lasagne, simply outstanding.  They also serve a good range of mocktails. So overall one is gonna enjoy the food...
The staff seemed new however was courteous and helpful....
Overall it was a fine dining experience at this newly opened joint. Maybe post my next visit there I might increase the rating.....

Positives: Great ambience. Comfortable seating and soothing lights. Good choice of music too. Interesting curtlery. Easy to locate. Fresh change. Good mocktails. Good appetisers. 

Negatives: Being absolutely new, a bit of mismanagement. Food is not at all at its best. Some dishes are good to the palate. But not everything is as finger licking as expected. Galouti kebab aint authentic. Lobster wasnt cooked fully. Mutton bhuna wasnt up to the mark too. 
However, one needs to visit and try a few more thinhs before jumping to conclusions. 

Must try at least once and then decide. Buckle up guys!

Awesome food ... great variety in the menu.  Lovely presentation and ambience.  The theme has come out pretty well.  We ordered for soup. Preparation was ws quite different.  Starters were yummy. Mix sauce pasta was a little on the drier side. Could have been better.
