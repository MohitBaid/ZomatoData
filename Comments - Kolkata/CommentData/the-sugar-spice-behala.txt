Located at Sakher Bazer more a very small outlet of this franchise.Got a layered Chocolate cake of the shelf for a small occasion .
Cake sponge was absolutely spongy and literally melted in the mouth and perfectly moist.Evenly creamed with whipped cream(Surprised that they used whipped cream a better product than Butter cream,a rather cheaper rudimentary product).The sides were covered with chocolate vermicelli‚Äã, though the chocolatey gueyness was missing  in the overall product .Over all an above  average product,  for the excellent quality of sponge and usage of whipped cream but nothing to be bowled over by.A plastic cutout of Happy wish and a plastic cake cutting knife was provided in an eye catching cake box.

Generally I don't have food from here. 
Pastries are just horrible, cream is not smooth and excessive sweetness. 
One thing I love that is Chicken club sandwich.

One of the renowned confectionery joint names in Kolkata. Their Chicken Club Sandwich is heavenly. The pastries are great too. Chicken as well as fish items are also tasty. Recommended for a quick snack.

The chicken club sandwich is a winner üòç
And their newest addition chocolate tart wins over the heart in the cutest way üíï
All the other items are good and the pocket pinch is pure bliss specially for the students. üòâ

It's a pocket pinch snack bar. Always there to satisfy the sudden cravings after tuitions, etc. However, no seating available. Fresh pastries, sandwiches, hotdogs, tarts and even Birthday cakes are available here.

Normally the pastries here are fresh and so are their other items. Recently tried their few items. 
1. Mutton kebab roll- it did not taste good n coating was not crisp
2.paneer kachodi- filling was good but coating wasn't 
3. Chicken hot dog- it was really tasty 
4. Choco glass- it wasn't fresh

Overall they need to improve their service.

It is  in the very heart of Behala Tramdepot.  A little outlet but full of  sweetness and joy.  Their cakes and other munchies are delicious.  Always fresh and tasty. Be it anybody's birthday, anniversary or just a get together with friends this little outlet comes to the rescue with its yummy pastries, sandwiches, pizza etc.

Mini food joint. Convenient for take-aways and food on the go. Love the Butter Chicken Masala there. Sweet eats available there can be deemed average.

Very small outlet. Same as the miomore. Nothing special in it. Highly regarded for the school tiffin. Popular among the school kid. Burger was good. Though they don't have a microwave oven. So naturally it was not expected.
