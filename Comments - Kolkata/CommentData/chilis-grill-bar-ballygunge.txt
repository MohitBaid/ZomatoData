Much better than what you get in the US. To begin with, the staff are genuinely polite.
The food is overpriced, in a generic sense. But when you consider that a lame cup of coffee costs Rs 150 right next door inside the INOX, the food price seems very reasonable.
The taste of food is ....... decent. I have had better at other Chili's.
They have decent variety of drinks at a slight inflated price.
Overall, a place I would go to if I need to eat out after 11pm.

The food would not disappoint you here. You will some authentic taste of American food. They played really nice music.
The ambiance is just ok and you might struggle to get a table here. This place is little clumsy.

The best place for American food in Kolkata,Chillis is located on the top floor of Quest mall.There are two floors inside the restaurant and there is ample space.We tried the grilled chicken platter,chicken fajita,bloody mary and strawberry yoghurt shake.The grilled chicken platter consisted of a large chicken leg,rice and broccolis.The chicken fajita is a large piece of chicken with a cheese crust.The bloody mary is a vodka cocktail.The food was excellent.Its the best continental food I have tried in Kolkata.The ambience was pleasing with beautiful lighting.The service was also good.Only downside is that the price is a bit high.

Having tried their South City Mall outlet, was keen to check out the Quest one as well, and believe me when I say it, this has been the BEST gastronomic experince for me so far. They serve the most exquisitely scrumptious Tex-Mex cuisine in the city.
Food offered here is simply incredible, of excellent quality and taste, and served in sufficient quantity.

The ambiance is extremely pleasant, peppered with preppy popular Western music in the background, while the decor flaunts the picture of a typical quaint American diner.
We were seated at a cozy table beside the huge glass window overlooking the busy glittering street below. Water was provided in huge beer mugs.

We gorged and relished on the boneless CREAMY JALAPE√ëO WINGS (bone-in ones are also available) and the extra crispy CHICKEN CRISPERS with prawns as an add-on.

The jalape√±o wings are boneless chicken wings tossed in flavourful Santa Fe sauce with a swirl of Chile Garlic sauce and sprinkled with queso fresco and fresh cilantro. Perfectly boiled, they tasted gorgeous, like creamy dahi vada, but with their very own distinctly tangy divine flavour.

The chicken crispers are Chili's classic hand-battered chicken served with corn on the cob, freshly-fried home-style potato fries and a honey-mustard dipping sauce. As per the suggestion of the server the prawns were added to the dish.
The crispers were so very crisp, served fresh and hot, along with the crispy batter-coated prawns and crunchy French fries that seemed truly fantastic to the palate, and absolutely heavenly to taste once dipped in the awesome honey mustard sauce. The corn was lightly sweet, and quite an appetising accompaniment to the delicious platter.
Even the After Mint provided at the end of the hearty meal was also splendidly refreshing.

All the items that we had at Chili's were of proportionately lip-smacking tastes. Servers are also very warm, friendly and polite.
For amazingly mindblowing Texan-American gourmet fast food, burgers, steaks, seafood, Mexican fajitas, quesadillas, enchiladas, Italian pizza, pasta and other such culinary delights Chili's Grill & Bar at Quest is a MUST VISIT for any foodie or anyone who loves to eat! :) üëåüëç

Its inside the quest mall so no need to stating the location again. Went there on the new year evening, and surprisingly we got our seat after very little amount of waiting. We even got a window seat, as described by so many other foodies the view from the top is surely amazing <3¬†Now coming to the ambiance of the restro its amazing, no need to elaborate anything on that, just visit there you will feel it.The staffs are amazing also, they courteous and professional. They helped us a lot regarding choosing the menu.We had ordered Blue Pacific Margarita, Berry Delight, Non veg triple dipper having chicken crispers, chicken wings and southwestern eggrolls, Smoked chicken leg and grilled chicken platter.Both the drinks were amazing. The 3 types of dippers with the Non veg triple dipper were absolutely astonishing, I personally loved the Southwestern eggrolls the most, although the other two types were also very good. Grilled chicken platter was tasted okay in my opinion, nothing that special, though the Smoked chicken leg platter was mindblowing, the chicken piece was huge and soft and juicy. But the rice provided with them didn't tasted that much special and also the quantity was very less even for a single person.So overall a great experience here, all the food and drinks items were amazing. Nothing to tell about their ambiance and hospitality, as both of them were top notch. Would love to visit here again.Thank you :)

I will definitely give this place a 5.0 rating because of the food,service, ambience, presentation etc. They are highly professional with a big commercial chain. Coming to food I love Mexican, perhaps you will think that my review is biased because I have a soft corner for Mexican Food. Go to this place and you will understand what I am talking about. Once they had the BOGO offer on Mondays and Tuesdays and I am not sure if it is still valid, mark my word if you missed the offer you missed a great deal. As I am teetotaler I have no idea about the liquor menu. It was 3 of us and the bill was around 2k more or less I don't remember precisely. Gst(5%) is only charged and no other service tax. Highly recommend this.

Located on the third floor of Quest Mall Chili‚Äôs is one of my favourite place to hangout with friends, it being situated very close to my College.

Ambience: 5/5
The ambiance and outlook of Chili‚Äôs in Quest mall is simply stunning as like the posters of Chili‚Äôs spread all over globally this one adore‚Äôs the same standard. The interior works are pretty impressive, from the ceiling to the wall all are done with special wall like brick finish and nice bright colours. The ceiling has pretty sets of colourful light all throughout. The sitting arrangement has a wide spread to choose from as you enter. Ask for a seat near the window, from where you can have a lovely view of the busy 7 point sipping your share of beer with your tastebuds dipping in the aroma of Triple dippers.


Food: 5/5
‚Ä¢Triple Dipper- The signature appetizer of Chili‚Äôs and a must try. Guests are allowed to choose from a pentagon of dishes which includes Chicken Crispers, Chicken wings, Country fried crispers and Southwestern egg-roals. My personal choice includes Southwestern Egg Rolls, Chicken Wings, and three long Chicken Crispers. There are also some long slices of carrots to go with it. The three dips that came with it were Avocado-Ranch, Cool Ranch and Honey Mustard, and I had a lovely time dipping them in each, arousing my taste buds. The chicken wings had a slathering of hot sauce, which made it perfect for dipping in the ranch dressing and consuming. The egg rolls were a revelation, and they were perfectly crisp, cheesy, and very satisfying. A perfect appetizer to go with chilled bottles of beer. Enough for two people. (Highly Recommended). 

‚Ä¢Signature Chicken Wings: I loved the juicy awa crispy wings so much that I went on to ordering a full plate of Chicken Wings.

‚Ä¢Cajun Pasta: Ain‚Äôt much of a Pasta guy, hence didn‚Äôt try it. According to my friend it was pretty good. But I took a bite from the garlic bread, and it had more of Parsley than Garlic, didn‚Äôt like it much.

‚Ä¢Chiptole Chicken Pizza: Topped with red chilli and spicy grilled chicken, with ample amount of Cheddar and Mozzarella melted to perfection, and crust baked to golden brown, the Chiptole Pizza is the one I‚Äôd crave for any day. Enough for two. (Recommended)


Service: 5/5
Quick and well behaved staffs, takes good care of your needs (even if you‚Äôre drunk enoughüòâ)

Quantity: 5/5
All the dishes are served in abundance for two.

Pocket pinch: 4.5/5
Bill came around ‚Çπ2900 for three people including tax and a pitcher of beer. A bit on the higher side, but definitely worth it.

Will be back soon to try Chili‚Äôs newly introduced Baby Back Ribs.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

The flag bearer of authentic American, tex-mex cuisine in Kolkata, Chili's has been an absolute favourite since it's inception in the city. Over these years, they've been consistently serving amazing food and brilliant cocktails. Amongst the three outlets, I like this one the best. Their wide range of cocktails are sure to impress you. Have tried Presidente Margarita, LIIT, Watermelon Mojito and some of the mocktails as well. Coming to food I'm am ardent fan of their Pizzas, mix and match fajitas and other than that, I also quite like the famous Tripple Dipper & few seafood mains. To sum up, I'll always look upto Chili's when it comes to some comfort food in a homely laid back environment.

We were welcomed by a host who explained us about the food. He also clicked our picture. The services were very prompt and the staffs were very helpful. We ordered Smoky Chicken Quesadillas and the bill amount was Rs 525/- including taxes. The food was enough for two people and tastes amazing. We experienced authentic American Cuisine. A must visit for everyone.

Located at Quest Mall, Kolkata, chili‚Äôs bar & grill is one of my all time favs. The ultimate bacon burger is a must try if you LOVE bacon, like i do. Another fav pick is th fried calamari here, which i coupled woth draught beer. Absolutely amazing. Th staff here is amazing as well, especially Ms.Dorothy who served us throughout wih her best services. 
As a whole, I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for good American food.

Just visited the mall for family dinner. The food was good. Suggestions by Mr. Abishek, the coordinator of our table was quite nice. 
The cooking could've been better though. 'cause some of the menus were a bit salty. 
Overall the experience was good. Hope it gets better with time.

Chilli's is one of my favourite restaurant in the town for its American cuisines. Perfect place to hangout with your friends. This Christmas eve I visited this place, although there a queue which was quite obvious for lunch during the festive time. The staff was courteous and helpful.This is my third time and I ordered my favourite fish and chips, tuortilla crusted chicken and molten choclate with my friends ordering   bacon burgers and non veg starters. Overall it was delicious and it is worth visiting.

This is one of my favourite restaurants serving american food in kolkata. I have been to other chili's outlets and have never been disappointed. But this outlet has really impressed me a lot, specially with their service. Great music, good ambience, great service and great food adds up to a great experience. Coming to the food, they probably serve the best Quesadillas and enchiladas in town. The burgers taste really great and quantity wise its good too. The enchiladas have a very tender cheesy touch which makes it even more mouth melting. The thin crust pizzas are a must! The fajitas and quesos,served with pico de gallo and sour cream serving enhances the taste and experience. The texas spicy chicken wings are very tasty,but extremely spicy, so beware! Previously, the tax rates with service charge was very high,but post gst, the rates have gone down and it just makes people like me very happy!
Food quality-4.9/5
Food quantity-4.4/5
Service-5/5
Value for money-4.5/5
Looking forward to visit again to taste new dishes!

Highly overrated...  apart from blackened salmon which was more than awesome the rest were just average. Decor and staff courtesy service are excellent.they have a unique style of taking order..The will kneel on their legs with their face just above the table which is a signature move of showing respect as per their policy but I personally didn't liked it as it was demeaning a person ( as if they are your slave). Another point if you are into American dining which is purely meat based you may like it more

This is a place that feels almost like home. I have been here innumerable times and have tried a lot of things on the menu, primarily the sandwiches and the burgers. Some of the must haves are -¬†

The Non-Veg Triple Dipper
Texas Cheese Poppers
Chicken Nachos
Baby Back Ribs - this is amazingly soft and juicy
The Tenderloin Steaks
Southern Smokehouse Burger - Excellent one¬†
Cajun Club Sandwich - this one is good but I guess the earlier club sandwich wasn't the Cajun one, so I liked the earlier one better
Chicken Burgers

The desserts are another outstanding set here - the best one being the Molten Chocolate Cake closely followed by Chocolate Chip Paradise Pie. The Raspberry Chocolate Cake is pretty good as well.

The staff is very courteous as well but at times they pester a bit regarding rating them.¬†

Will visit the place again and again.

Excellent food, excellent service, good ambience. We've been to Chilli's many times before and have had enjoyable dining experiences. Yesterday was no different. We had gone in for dinner after an evening movie, and were served by Gopal. We had mushroom soup and grilled fish (basa and salmon) and came out feeling full and quite happy.

Well decorated American styled foodjoint. The staffs are very much well mannered and cordial. We asked them for a window side seat and from there we could see the entire ciry. Basically we were there for our breakfast. So we ordered crispy chicken tacos which comes along rice and black beans. The tacos were very much soft but I didnot like the fillings. Then they recommended us the old-timer burger. We order for two burgers. It's a large sized burger stuffed with meat patty ,lettuce ,garlic dill pickle and mustard. French fries and pickled cucumbers. The burgers were very much delicious. We also ordered for twisted blue lemonades but we missed the happy hours. :( But the lemonades were refreshing and perfectly blended. So it was a nice experience there.

So..Am a regular at Chilli's! And by regular I mean "Regular"! Atleast twice a month!
The best thing about them are their draught beer. After a strenuous day at office.. Nothing could possibly beat their chilled beer! An ultimate refresher.
Food..Simply awesome..We generally order their burgers and Tortilla crusted chicken.. Both of them are fantabulous.
I think one who haven't tried Chilli's yet ..They are missing something exceptional!

The ambience and the decor was excellent and the stuffs were really well behaved.

Almost all the restaurants located within Quest Mall look lucrative enough to us for repeated visits. Last weekend we decided to try out an American ‚Äì Continental kind of lunch and that is how we decided on Chili‚Äôs Grill and Bar. This is a fabulous place to visit with friends and family. The welcoming atmosphere, extraordinary service and fantastic range of lip smacking food items available add up to a great dining experience. I definitely intend to go back soon again to try out few more alluring items on the menu.

Chilis has always been a favourite. 
I couldn‚Äôt count the number of times we‚Äôve been to eat there. 
On our very recent visit to this outlet of chili‚Äôs, we ordered a portion of chicken nachos which were cheesy and brilliant as usual. For our mains we ordered two ultimate bacon burgers. 
Honestly I always find these burgers too big to like till the end but I guess that‚Äôs the difference from fast food burgers. 
However, the ones we got lacked flavour somehow and the patty was absolutely dull. 
We also got a vanilla milkshake which was out of this world.

I have been a fan of Chili's.  I have always loved the food and the hospitality of this place. However, this time when I visited Chili's on 6th Dec to celebrate my friend's birthday I was very much disappointed. In order to surprise my friend I had asked the staff to get us a cake as it was her birthday. At the end of the meal they did sing a birthday song for her and brought a mango cheese cake for her. All was good, she was very happy until the bill arrived. They had charged us for the Mango Cheese Cake which I thought would be complimentary as all the places give a birthday cake for free on someone's birthday. Chili's if you had to charge us for that cake, atleast you could have given us a dessert of our choice. This place has always been one of my favourites but because they did this,I had to give them this rating.

Chili's is a big brand in the US and the fact that they have come to Kolkata has given a window to people like me to sample the awesome food that they serve. I have been to this Quest Mall outlet the most and I loved the experience everytime. The service here is top notch. Coming to food, I like quite a lot of things from their extensive menu. The Triple Dipper is the most popular starter here. I also really like the Texan Cheese Poppers, Chicken Nachos, Barbeque Chicken Wings and the Creamy Jalapeno Wings. For main course, my go-to dish is the Roasted Red Pepper Chicken which comes with a side of Mexican rice and Steamed broccoli. Other dishes which I like are the Classic chicken burger which comes with a side of fries and pickle, the jumbo sized Half Chicken, Chicken Crispers and the Ultimate Bacon burger.. For the desserts, the chocolate options are very good here.. I love the Brownie and the Skillet Cookie.. I had once tried the Mango Cheesecake, but didn't like it that much.. But undoubtedly the overall quality and quantity of food at Chili's is excellent. A must visit place for all!!!

Amazing place. The fajitas are excellent and a must try. Undoubtedly, they serve the best tex-mex dishes in town. 
They also have a good selection of burgers. Kudos to the team. 
Happy dining. :)

With the classic slick and contemporary Chili's ambience, this place will win your heart with its quick service and courteous staff. The smoked chicken and roasted corn pizza was the best pizza I have tasted in a long time. Tequila sunrise that we ordered was perfect, better than most places. Strawberry lemonade was good too. If you are visiting this place during an afternoon in winter, sitting beside the large glass windows will make the sun kiss your cheeks and fill you with a sense of warmth and happiness.

Chili's serves up some of the great, gastro-pub food I have ever had. But every time I eat here, I inevitably come home with a bad stomach. It's a curse really, because I love their food - I just can't digest it! (weak stomach problems 101). Albeit the prices are exorbitant, but for your average eater, the quantity is great so you won't regret the splurge. Some of the dishes I had were -
1) Chicken Cajun wings - This didn't sit well with me at all, I don't know why. I didn't like the base sauce they used. I like my wings to be sweet, sour and tangy and these were anything but. They confused my palate. 
2) Fried calamari - The only place where I can eat squid. I love it but it gives me a loose stomach EVERY SINGLE TIME. I guess their oil is really bad.
3) Chicken Quesadilla - These are one of my favourite dishes, served with sour cream and black beans. They're honestly SOOO filling and yum. I liked it when they served it with mexican rice (honestly I can make a meal out of their mexican rice and black beans), but now I have to ask for it on the side, which is devastating.
4) Non-veg triple dipper - didn't like the dips, and the chicken was just about okay so meh.
5)¬† Chicken Nachos - One word. Y U M 
6) Santa Fe Salad - Just really not the place for a good salad. Would not recommend it at all
7) Blackened salmon - Honestly. YUM. The only dish my stomach can hold. If you're a fish lover, must order!
8) Spicy smoked pasta - a cheese lovers paradise. A good plate of food
9) Mix and match Fajita - LOVED IT, IT WAS YUMMY 
10) Baby back ribs - delicious 
11) Southern Smokehouse burger - Yummy and super filling albeit the buns were too big
12) Molten chocolate cake - Goes down as a favourite for centuries to come
13) Mojitea - this is crap, don't order it
Overall, if you stomach can hold it, eat here!

This was on my Wishlist for long time. Finally I got a chance to visit this American restaurant last week. Firstly the ambience was pure American. Staffs were very friendly and knowledgeable. We were attended by Sarojini and she was really good. Now coming to food.

Watermelon Margarita: refreshing and served in a big glass. They have both alcoholic and non-alcoholic versions.

Tomato Soup: very tasty and creamy. Served with a garlic bread which was too good. They made it 1/2 portion on our request.

Blackened Salmon: a healthy portion of Salmon served with Aromatic rice and some veggies. It was very tasty specially rice.

Orange glaze Salmon: this was tasty too. But both the Salmon was little hard compared to the one I tasted in USA. Probably they use frozen Salmon.

Molten cake: this was very yummy and not much sweet. Portion was very big and more than enough for 3-4 people.

It was overall a nice experience will visit again. Only bad thing the plate was rotating in which they served Salmon which was really disturbing.

Chilli‚Äôs is surely one of our favourites.. The ambiance is cool and sitting at the bar table with your buddies is altogether a fun experience.. My friends and me have been here so many times and one of the main reasons is ‚ÄúFusion‚Äù. It‚Äôs one of the best mocktails in Kolkata.. it‚Äôs too refreshing and complete satisfaction to your thirst.. the burgers here are too stuffy and so was the ceaser salad.. the veg triple dipper will totally suit your taste buds.. but my all time fav is ‚ÄúTexas cheese popper‚Äù irresolute u r a cheese lover or not u r gonna love it..
The Grilled chicken was little hard to chew which was the only thing that was a let down though..

My suggestions would be:
Fusion
Texas cheese Popper 
Burger

A must visit..!

This particular outlet at Quest mall was the 1st one in Kolkata before Chili's opened at South City mall & Acropolis mall, hence this outlet has always been close to my heart. 
I was invited by the Management for a special Tex Mex food tasting session. However, along with the Tex Mex, we were served few regular bestselling items too!

The location takes away the brownie points besides the delicious food and excellent service! Let me mention the name of Arshi, he offered the most courteous service and we were bowled over by his warm hospitality.

The must order cocktails -
Cosmopolitan
 LIIT
Presidente Margarita

The shake lovers can try the yummy Strawberry shake.

The must order dishes -
Craft Burger Bites
Old Timer Burger
Chicken Crispers
Quesadillas 

Highly Recommended!

We ordered: 
Chicken wings served with carrots n smoky sauce : the sauce(5/5) was perfect with a woody flavour infused.Wings(2/5) were skinnier than expected,but had they been thick we could have never gotten to the mains..
8pieces in total.


Chicken and buffalo Fajitas served with 5 dips : the sauces and dips were good.The buffalo was a little tougher than expected and had a mutton-like smell which my friend didn't quite enjoy.The chicken was good.
3.5/5


Buffalo steak served with a plate full of fries,mashed potatoes and a dip : 
I ordered for a medium-rare steak but I was served a medium-well. perhaps it's their policy not to serve medium- rare?I'm unsure.
It tasted okay.The portion was again huge for one, perfect for two.
The mashed potatoes with two kinds of shredded cheese on top was good.
I used the leftover ambrosial dip from the wings which was the perfect possible condiment complementing the steak.The dip that was served with it, doesn't even compare.
I liked the steak, however I would have preferred it to be juicy,medium-rare.
3/5

Fratelli red: beautiful... flavourful.Smells fruity.Not too strong.
Blueberry Yogurt smoothie: well.just as how one should taste like.
Yes I tasted them both.Yes,I know I shouldn't have had anything milky when I'm having red.
Both were just so tasty!

Molten chocolate cake: 5/5 
Just enough sweetness,just perfect warmth,served with a scoop of vanilla,covered by a delicate chocolate shell.And chocolate sauce on plate.
One of it is more than enough for 2.

Chocolate Truffle cheesecake: 3/5
 It tastes more like chocolate mousse and cream than cheesecake.
Portion enough for 2.
We didn't like it as much as the cake.Halfway through it we thought the Chocolate mousse cake would have been a better choice.

Ambience: 4.5/5
Completely American pub cum diner like interiors..had bar stool-like seating at the bar and .The ceiling had pipes! Glass wall separates 3rows of seating..our seat was by the glass door on a table meant for 4.Expected a two -seater.

May revisit to try the smokehouse burgers,but none of the ones we already had.

It is an honour for me... that I got an invitation for tasting their newly launched "Tex Mex Menu"... Positive thing about this place is there is no negatives... Weather it may be the food, food quality, food quantity, ambience or service... They never fail to maintain their standards... 
Recommend drinks are...

‚ù§ Presidente Margarita~ Must try from here... Really refreshing... 

‚ù§ LIIT~ I'm a die hard fan of their LIITs... They all are just mind blowing... 

# Mojito~ Also very good... 

# Cosmopolitan~ Decent one... 

‚ù§Strawberry Shake~ Yummiest shake I ever tasted...

Recommend dishes from the Tex Mex Menu...

# Boneless jalapeno Wings~ Good one... People who likes tanginess in their food will surely like it the most... 
‚ù§ Smoked Wings~ One of the best wings in the town... 

‚ù§ Crafted Chicken Patty Burger~ Awesome one... 

# Oldtime Burger~ It is all time favorite... Beef burger... Very good too... 

‚ù§ Blackened Bhetki~ Excellent... Soft, succulent, yummilicious bhetki... Perfectly marinated and grilled to perfection... Highly recommended... 

‚ù§ Grilled Tenderloin~ Ask them to make it medium rare... And wait for the magic in the mouth... 

And in desserts... Try their... 

# Skillet Cookie~ Very well presented... Tasted decent too... 

# Truffle Cake~ Awesome one... Give it a try... 

Overall an amazing experience... It's very difficult for someone to leave unhappy from this place... Same happened to me too... 

A huge thanks to the Management Team again for having me over there... 

Keep making everyone happy as always... 

Cheers...

Yesterday I went with my friend over here for lunch and some drinks for the first time and the experience I had was just awesome.
Ambience was okay, but the best things you will enjoy over here is the service and the drinks.
Staff over here are really good with thier job and really friendly (specially Amit).
We tried some cocktails and Strong Long island ice tea and Adios amigos were the best, you may not fit d these drinks in the menu. But you can ask Amit(bartender) for the drinks and you will remember them forever.
Food was quite good, we tried Mex rice, Crispy chicken wraps and steak. The food and drinks both were really good, but will not say pocket friendly.
Moreover it will be a really good experience if you visit the place for the first time.

I had been to Kolkata for official work and since I have friends staying there we thought to catch up and Quest Mall was recommended by my friend.
So we came across Chili‚Äôs which is also in Powai(Mumbai) .
We ordered their Veg Pizzas which were pretty decent; though the varieties of Pizza in Veg are only 3.
A bit costly but Ambience wise i would give them 5/5 and also the service was prompt with courteous staff.

Daughter wanted to treat her friends from school on her birthday. I arrived an hour prior to that, informed Chili's , booked a table, requested for a 'surprise' birthday cake.
Chili's said, they don't have anything like that. So brought a proper cake from the bakery downstairs, handed it over to the Chili's staff and requested to do the rest. They said they would.
When the girls were all settled at the table, I gave the staff another reminder before leaving.
After a couple of hours I went back to settle the bill and found out that some of the girls have already left after finishing their meal, some are preparing to leave and the Chili's people have most delightfully forgotten about the birthday cake!!
How worse the service can get than this?

Among the plethora of outstanding options at Quest mall, this place is a definite stand-out. Be it food, drinks or ambience, this place excels at each one of them. The cherry-on-top is the friendly and swift service offered by the staff. Specifically, I would like to highlight the efforts of Gopal (Lapog) and Rasheed (Deehsar), who spared no effort to ensure that we had a good time.¬†

Chili‚Äôs has a good ambience with an American diner feel. Starting from the push-glass and metal frame doors to the seating style. Music is also quite good. The menu is pretty much tailored for everyone's palette and any item with cheese is amazing. Prices are on the higher side but portions are right enough.

It is now our regular dinner place when in town. Classic must-try‚Äôs are Grilled chicken breast with chipotle sauce, BBQ chicken, signature wings, classis nachos and the Texas trio. The standout dish would be the Blackened Salmon - A thick fillet of salmon tossed up with spices and served with fried rice and cherry tomatoes. The salmon is so tender.

Taste is always on point. Recommend this place 100%!

This has been one of my all time favorite places to be.. The ambience, the music and above all the food is simply beyond awesome.. The staff is also very friendly and they really give good suggestions on the menu. Recently I went there with my friends and we were served by Sushmita and it was a really nice experience. I generally have chicken shrimp fajitas or herb fish fillet. But this time we tried blackened Basa and we loved it. The dessert was out of the world.. I look forward to visiting again..

I visited this branch of Chilis with a lot of expectations especially since it has the highest rating. To be honest, none of the foods really impressed me to that extent, the service was pretty average and at times inattentive.
We ordered from the BOGO menu as it was a Monday:
‚óáChicken Tacos: These were served with rice amd black beans. The dish was filling for sure, the rice they serve is always good but the Tacos they seemed so ordinary.
‚óáSmoked Chicken wings: I disliked the fact that the wings were so bland, it was smoke flavoured and that was it. The BBQ sauce they served with it barely managed to save the day.
‚óáMango Cheesecake: First of all this doesn't taste like a proper cheesecake. I would prefer a proper cracker crumb crust even if it's of oreos or chocolate biscuits but what's with the brownie cake layer? The cream cheese part was as ordinary as a Mio Amore mango mousse filling to be honest.
‚óáBrownie Sundae: I appreciate the fact that it was a huge piece of brownie filled with walnuts but it is so difficult to finish a dry brownie with just a scoop of vanilla ice cream. They should definitely serve more chocolate sauce. Surely for the restaurant pic there's loads of sauce given, the one they serve lacks it.
We sat by the tables overlooking the roadside, and that was pretty good.
I would just conclude saying that I expected much better from a 4.9 rated restaurant being a foodie.

Went to chilli's today and order the bottom less nachos and bottom less coke. The menu doesn't say anything about "not sharing" one class of coke with anyone. However the waitress, after seeing that two of us shared one glass of bottomless coke, quickly came to our table and said that we are not allowed to share bottomless coke and then ask for refills. This doesn't make any sense. Who decides how many people drink a glass of coke? Moreover it's anyway an overpriced coke which is barely 250ml. If I'm already paying 4 times the actual price, why such weird rule? And to top it, the taste of their food is so mediocre and lacks spice. Chilli's turned out to be such a big disappointment.

Went there quite a few times.
Everything is perfect about this place. Be it their lavish decor, soothing music, enchanting wide spread food and drinks menu or warm hospitality!
They make some definitely lip smacking food to droll upon.

Few things i will definitely mention (everything else on the menu is synonymously perfect)-

1. Grilled Tenderloin - They will prepare the way you want your tenderloin to be. Mine was perfectly done as per my buds. Comes with garlic bread, chili's special mash and any two other sides according to your choice. The best grilled tenderloin i ever had.
2. Creamy Jalapeno Wing- Cilantro sprinkled juicy chicken wings in chilli garlic sauce.
3. Non Veg Triple Dipper - choose any 3 appetizer.
All are equally delectable. Comes with heavenly dips.
4. Bacon and cheddar steak -
Comes with mash and assorted veggies. Cheddar cheese makes it even more melt in mouth. Get it done as you love. Pork lovers don't ever dare to miss, giving it a try.
LIIT- Too good. Definitely gave a good hit!üòò
Try any food you wish without a second thought.
You will fall in love surely..

Definitely top of the list for the last few years!
A bit price-high. But it's absolutely worth it üëç

Amazing prompt service.Staffs are too courteous. They value feedbacks.
Thanks Team Chili's for making my visit better everytime !

The ambience is very good. Quality food and and a fine collection of drinks both alcoholic beverages as well as non-alcoholic ones. The staff was amazing especially gopal who was our server for the evening. However, the burger- the ultimate bacon burger to be exact was a waste of money to be quite honest as i found the Buffalo meet patty to be too dry. Having said that, the buns were fresh and the bacon strips were well smoked but the whole burger fell apart because of the dry patty instead of a fresh juicy one.

Well people say this place serves some real good food ,so finally ended up costing this place. Didn't find the hospitality much worth.We asked for one table but was refused because of number of person was less ,but the same table was given to same number of guests just as ours a little later.
Coming to food we ordered Veg Nachos which was the best amongst all that we ordered.Tasted better amongst all the items that we had.
Then we had the crispy chicken tacos ,which was served with black bean sauce & herbed rice. Didn't find any difference than the normal chicken burgers.
The next dish was grilled chicken with herbed rice ,the Chicken was hard didn't feel like fresh.Herbed rice in both cases tasted same , nothing out of the ordinary.
The beer tasted good & crisp.
Overall it seemed just an okayish kind of place ,when there are enough options available throughout the city.

The skillet cookie is my favorite here with that soft warm cookie with chocolate chips an the scoop of vanilla ice cream that tops makes the perfect combination.

FINALLY I visited this Quest mall outlet. It's an American, Mexican restaurant. Located in 4 th floor. 
The ambience is cool. Staffs are attentive, efficient, friendly & helpful also. The service is quick. 
Coming to food... 
We ordered in Mocktails Blue Pacifico & Evolution. Both were outstanding.. MUST TRY... 
Next in Starters ordered v famous Classic Chicken Nachos. Nachos were salty, spicy & crispy.. 
In Main Course we ordered Red Pepper Chicken. Red Pepper Chicken was my favorite...  Grilled chicken breast covered with cheese & served with Rice, broccoli & red pepper creamy sauce. Specially Rice was too good & Chicken Breast with cheese yummy.‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
In Desserts we ordered Brownie Sundae  & Choco Mango Cheesecake. Both were Outstandingly amazing. But over The top was Mango Cheesecake. Soo creamy & wonderful in taste... Also Brownie with icecream was also good. Brownie was warm & full of walnuts.‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Overall it was tasty & lip-smacking food & good service. Would love to visit again..

For drink we ordered Kingfisher Ultra Beer and Bloody Mary. It was a Monday. So, we got the offer of 1:1 on drink. And coming to food, we had to pay the price of the one item which is higher. Everything was cooked and served to its perfection. I wish to come back here to try more other items from the variety of foods they offer.

Highly recommended.

Last time I had great time at chilli's Delhi, so I have been to this place for lunch with my boss on this Wednesday and we were very hungry and ordered for BBQ chicken salad and chicken platter urgently.  Then after 15 mins we want to add some drinks and big mouth wings.  So we called and ordered same and we told them that we ordered our main course already.  Then that girl came back and said that our main course not ordered till that time. I don't know what to say.  Service is very bad.  Food was good.  We asked for dash of lemon with Diet Coke they couldn't understand. 3 times different people came with different things.  I don't know this place is having such high rating.  Sorry guys.  I have very bad time.

I tried out their Quesadilla Explosion Salad. The lettuce was crisp and fresh. The diced tomatoes, tortilla strips, corn and beans were tasting flavourful. The Southwest chicken was thoroughly cooked and tasted wholesome. The Quesadilla wedges were stuffed with cheese and tasted heavenly once inside the mouth. It is a healthy option for those who need to feel satiated yet full. Chili's has always been memorable both in terms of service as well as food. A big thumbs up

Who serves the best Tex-Mex food in the City of Joy? Chili's is your answer. It was the eve of my birthday and what a better place to celebrate than here!

The Quest Mall outlet has the finest interiors compared to the rest two. Also the music and the ambiance here are always right on bounce to lift up your mood. 

Another oomph factor apart from the food here would be the staff. Courteous, polite and humorous , they're all of it combined. That day we were catered by Shadab. 

We had ordered: 

‚óèChicken Mexican Rice Bowl- a mix bowl of chipotle rice, Mexican beans, cheese blend, grilled chicken, nachos, veg mix topped with sour cream. 

‚óèCrispy Chicken Taco- soft tortilla stuffed with crispy chicken tenders , coleslaw , guacamole, sour cream and ranch dressing. 

‚óèChicken Barbeque Quessedila -this is one of my favourites here. It comes with a side of sour cream, salad and Mexican beans. 

‚óèChoco chip skillet cookie-undoubtedly one of the best desserts I've ever had. A dallop of ice cream over a baked bed of cookies is just the right end to your meal. 

To sum up, a perfect birthday !

I have been to Chilli's on numerous occasions and have always enjoyed the food. Being a foodie I love the portions of food that Chilli's serve.
Yesterday I had been to Chilli's and had a wonderful experience. Special thumbs up to the staff for excellent service, accomodation and friendly behaviour.
Since it was a Monday we had availed the BOGO offer which was 1:1 on food and 1:1 on domestic liquor.
We ordered the following. Texas cheese poppers, Classic Nacho's and Grilled Chicken Platter from the BOGO offer. Ultimate bacon burger and Triple Dipper was ordered separately since it wasn't on the offer menu.
For drinks we ordered A Mai Tai cocktail, Frozen Mochachino and Watermelon Moji Tea.
The food was too good. We were blown away by the Texas cheese poppers and the Ultimate bacon burger. But the grilled chicken platter needs improvement. The drinks were top notch. It was a hearty sumptuous meal. And at the end of the day you would feel it was money well spent.
Even though Chilli's is on the higher side when it comes to the pocket it is worth it. You can't be disappointed, with an array of dishes which they have to offer. You will always have a smile on your face at the end of the meal. Worth the visit always!

There's a reason why a restaurant gets 4.9/5 rating (the highest on zomato probably!!)... Chili's clearly deserves that. What an ambience, what a d√©cor, staff , food, service, view- SUPERB!!!! IT'S AS AMERICAN AS IT GETS!!!
Chili's was in my bucket list from a long time n finally we decided to pay a visit today. It was a gloomy day, so we took the seats overlooking the entire city. It was a majestic view I must say. 
Ordered: draught beer and margarita, triple dipper & ultimate bacon burger with extra bacon. Food was uncomparable to any American food I ever had in the past. I take a bow!!!
Service: waiters were very polite. Quick service.
I already mentioned about the d√©cor n ambience. There was a quote "Kolkata. Like no place else" brownie points for that cz I couldn't agree more. 
This quest outlet was my preference bcz of it's rating and location. I wish I could rate it more than 5.
Thank you Team chili's for my wonderful post-diwali experience. I will visit you someday soon:))

We have visited this place quite often and every experience is so pleasant that we keep coming back to it. This time we were greeted by Rashed and he made our outing even more memorable.

After having tried out almost every popular dish here, my wife (non veg - grilled chicken platter ) and I (veg - classic veg fajita ) settled for our respective favorites. However, for our son, we first time tried the kid meal option, as recommended by Rashed, and it turned out to be a great choice. Also, on his recommemdation, we tried out quesedilla explosion salad and loved the complete preparation. 

More than the food, the ambience inside is so peppy and cheerful and the service so prompt and courteous, even though at a slight premium, that you always take back lots of memories and a desire to be back here again!

Service was great, specially by Abhishekh. A very friendly person who was serving us. Food was great as always.  I ordered tortilla crusted chicken and tried the new jim beam supersonic. It was good enough to get me tipsy. Even my mom enjoyed her big fat burger.

Chilli's is one of my favourite chain restaurants in the city, I‚Äôve never been shy about it in public or in my postings and I don‚Äôt see any reason to be cause I absolutely LOVE the place!
The one situated at Quest Mall is huge but is usually full. The outlet even plays amazing music which adds on to the boisterous charm of the lively restaurant.

The service there is very prompt and the servers are quick in taking orders and providing helpful suggestions. I've been to chilli's a lot of times and hence I'll give a rundown of the food I like the most here :

Veg loaded nachos - this has no match, nothing ever compares to each nacho covered in cheese and a jalape√±o on each one. The sour cream and salsa are perfect accompaniments to it.¬†
Big Mouth Wings ‚Äì Currently a part of their new menu, and hopefully in the future will become a permanent fixture with them, these chicken wings are all I can think of since I ate them! HUGE pieces of chicken, amazingly tender and full of Cajun spice flavor. Honestly, these wings have spoilt all other chicken wings in Calcutta for me. To every chicken wing maker out there - this is the one to beat!¬†

Roasted Veggies Fajita ‚Äì Again a part of their new menu, the lovely part about their fajitas is the freshness of the ingredients. The vegetables were well cooked but still held their textural integrity. All the sauces were freshly prepared, I could literally mop up a bucket of that sour cream. Perfect guacamole and to put it all together, you get the perfect Fajitas! My Veg followers MUST try this!¬†

Blackened Bhekti with rice ‚Äì If you‚Äôre in Bengal and love fish, you usually avoid restaurants like Chili's for their fish, but that is exactly what Chili's has gotten up and done. They‚Äôve taken our favorite Bhekti maach and made it even more amazing! The fish was so tender, it literally gave way for the knife! Marinated for over 6 hours and paired with rice and boiled vegetables, the elements literally sing together!

Coffee and chocolate mousse cake ‚Äì If you‚Äôve seen my reviews earlier, you‚Äôll know I love my desserts! And believe me when I say this, this dessert was literally a piece of heaven in my mouth! The coffee mouse was light and airy and had the perfect amount of coffee hit in it. The chocolate cake was slightly dark and beautifully moist. It is a match made in heaven and I literally beg you to go and try this dessert at Chili's as soon as you can! PLEASE!

The supersonic bourbon LIIT ‚Äì This cocktail is one of the best ones I‚Äôve ever had. Prepared using Jim Beam, it was beautifully mixed and gives a good hit while leaving a delicious  taste in the mouth. Is that not what all of us want?¬†
The old timer ‚Äì A timeless classic made with Jim Beam again. This one absolutely hit the right spot and is perfect for a summer evening, or night or morning!

Find more about my Chili's visit and more on Instagram and Facebook! (Same name in both places)

Allright so ill try to keep it short and simple. 
Ambience: 7/10 
The place was well lit like a typical american small joint but on the contrary the place is big. The siting is comfortable and the music is not too loud as wellüòå. Bathroom was clean and the place maintained hygene. 

Service: 9/10
the service guy ming was an awesome fellow. He definately made the experience a lot better. He was very friendly and helpful. The chicken in the platter was not tender and upon informing him he immediately changed it for us. The service was prompt but not too fast. 

Food:9.5/10
Now coming to the food i must tell you that i am a burger freak and have tasted burgers in a lot of places in india. I must say they served us one of the best if not the best bacon and tenderloin burger ive tasted. The patty was made medium rare according to our demand. We ordered chicken platters which tasted good too.

Drinks: 6/10
 Here what i believe they lack a little as there is no option of a tower of draught beer. When you go in a place like this with a big group of friends the pitcher seems a bit off. The long island ice tea which we tried was not at all good. We couldn‚Äôt feel any taste of the alcohols inside. It was a sheer dissapointment. 

Lastly our host promised us a membership which she clearly forgot and a free brownie is due the next time we visit them. So this is it. Thank you for reading it. Please give a thumbs up if it helped you. 

P.S did i mention they have a special buy one get one free offer on the entire monday and tuesdays and it is valid both on food and liquor?? Probably not.üòÉ but that brought our pocket pinch to just 2500rs. 
Ok,peace out!‚úåüèª‚úåüèª

It was my n-th visit to chili's.
I must say that it was one of my best experience with chilis.
I visited chilis innumerable times with friends and colleagues. But this time it was different ball game altogether. We tried to experiment with the dishes and it wasn't a troublesome experience because of the amazing suggestions put forward by Mr Rashed. 
Each and every dish he suggested was  surprisingly luscious. Plus the ambience was worth mentioning. 
Whenever we visited chili's we never got out of our comfort zone,  we ordered their specialities and their clich√©d favourites and we were really satisfied. 
But today's satisfaction was on a different level,  and it was all because of Mr Rashed and his Coworkers. 
Things which makes Chili's standout is their variations in their food. 
Top notch ones are 
Herb fillet 
Chicken platter 
Cajun burger 
Cajun pasta 
Southwestern pasta 
Baby ribs 
Cheese pops 
Chipotle 
Quesadillas
Ancho fish 
Steaks and the list goes on and on. 
Noteworthy mention is the behaviour of their staffs. 
Each and everyone are the sweetest of the lot.

Chili's is not New to me. I visit in Chennai as well.
Anyway this branch was new but I was unconsciously aware that am gonna get the same feel as I got in other places as well.
Coming to the food menu like always I got confused and so I left the work on my friend who took me here for post Durga Puja lunch. 
‚óè Cheese poppers. My God it was so cheesy!!! All I felt cheese throughout. But that was too yummy!! The dip enhanced the taste more.
‚óè Smoked chicken quesadilla. With shrimps as add on. Crunchy on top and the inside it was staffed with delicious mixture of veggies, chicken pieces and shrimps which tasted more nice when the dip was used with some lettuce as well.
‚óè Blackened salmon. A thick fillet of salmon tossed up with spices and served with fried rice and cherry tomatoes. Tasty. Salmon was so tender.  How nicely the dish was garnished. Colourful. 
‚óè Molten cake. You won't feel like eating after u see the dish. (Take it positively üòâüòâ) it was So beautiful to look at. Like a chocolate lava erupting from the chocolate mountain. A chocolatey affair all through. This is enough to make u full. Highly sinful üòÜ
As always all the dips provided with each dish was something should get credit. Taste enhancer!
No doubt Chili's maintains a good brunch of staffs who are very courteous and compassionate. I must mention the name of Mr. Rashed who took care of our table very well and provided us whenever we demanded something ‚ò∫
This outlet is something different from the other 2 which is there in Kolkata , as u can have a very nice city view, definitely if the tables are free on that side.
You won't mind the bill when it's Chili's üå∂

The first Chili's restaurant to open in town. And as lady luck would have it, it was the last one remaining for me to pay a visit. The wait finally ended during a fun Pujo meet-up on Choturthi. There's nothing new worth mentioning about the Chili's decor. They get everything right : from the music to the lighting. A perfect ambience to have a nice time.
We ordered : Calamari(5/5) , which is basically fried squid. The best delicacy I've had in Chili's till date. Definitely coming back for this.
Fried Chicken Wings(5/5): Well fried, well presented.
Alcohol (Not going into the details)
Desserts ( Chocolate Chip Paradise Pie : 5/5) : Best part of the meal.
Over-all, another quintessential Chili's experience, and, like always, another experience where the franchise gets a perfect score.

I couldn't get chance to try much in this place, in hurry me and my friend ordered  chicken crispers original which was okay and sweet soda lime(came in big beer mug) , I thought chicken will be  crispy but it turned out little soft. What we liked most was the dipping mustered sauce... It came with 6 pieces of chicken fries, some french fries, and a boiled corn. 
Though i heard lot about this place, but it didnt satisfy me well.  All the staffs are very courteous and generous. Looking forward to revisit chilli's in different location.

Went to Chilli's yesterday, it was pretty crowded for a Wednesday. We were ushered to our table by two well mannered hostesses. Our host for the evening, Gopal, extremely well mannered, soft spoken and polite,  took our order and even made a few good suggestions. The food was delicious, as expected. The big mouth wings were cooked just right and came with a complimenting mayo mint dip. The chicken pasta was very good and cheesy. All in all it was great food, great ambience and great service. The staff at Chilli's deserve a pat on the back and I would definitely visit this venue again the next time I shall be in town.

I came here with my husband. Firstly we would like to  thank Dorothy for the wonderful reception and help she provided to choose our menu. We ordered Texas Cheese Poppers first. Its an wonderful veg starter. We tried Fish and chips after that. Well cooked basa fish with potato fries. Next up was Herb sole fille. Very well cooked bhetki fish with some veg top ups. Oh and did I mention the two lovely mocktails,  minty melon and fusion. Both were excellent. Lastly we badly wanted a desert. Dorothy rightly suggested molten cake. A mouth watering combination of ice cream and browny. We had a wonderful time. Highly recommended. Only thing is if you are a first timer then go through some recommended menu items before going.

It's always my favourite place for Mexican and continental dishes. The cheese and chicken nachos and the cream of mushroom soup are my all time favourite. Even the beer batter fried chicken with corn on the cob on the side and the pasta dish with shrimp in white sauce are very delicious. Among the drinks I really loved the Bailey's Irish cream. The desserts here are also to die for. The wide variety of dishes on the menu will really leave you puzzled and confused as to what to order. The service is really fast and the staff are nice and friendly. The prices are bit on the higher side but it's worth the money. A place you must visit. üòÅ

well it was my first time visit to chili's !
It was an amazing experience.

ambience : very good and decent look. 
server: very well behaved. explained food details with perfection. Simply 10/10. 
 food:  we have ordered
1. fried calamari : outstanding.
2. pizza : i will say just nice. 
3. nonveg triple dipper meal: very good. specially the crispy fried chicken was outstanding. 
4. big mouth wings : these spicy  chicken wings were outstanding, soft and so good in size.
total bill was around 2300/- 

the only drawback was because of the  lady outside who was attending customers and noted names. she skipped our name and when we asked she said
" i have called so many times ". whereas we were standing there  for all the time, just near that lady. 

overall it was a good experience inside the restaurant.   
waiting for next visit.

Well known for its intriguing italian, mexican And American cuisine. The food here is sure to tantalize your taste buds. The look and feel has a perfect setting for an ideal restaurant. Hospitality was good and the service was really Quick. I had ordered for - blackened salmon, Mix and match fajitas (with Chicken and shrimp) and bottomless coke.
The Salmon was really beyond my expectations. It was really flavoursome along with the dips and flavoured rice. The fajitas with Chicken and shrimp was really the star of the show. The Chicken was cooked to perfection along with all perfectly seasoned shrimps which went Really well with the vegetable salsa and the dips. Bottomless coke added to the never ending conversation. It was a great experience being there. I would highly recommend everyone to visit this place as its both value for money and completely sumptous.

Excellent food! Had Barbeque Chicken Salad, Grilled Chicken Platter, Raspberry Cake and Margarita. Finally I find a good destination for Salads in Kolkata!!!
One observation: when you are saying in the menu "BBQ chicken Salad and with shrimp it's Rs.425." Then you are making a bill of the same dish - Rs. 395+225=620 ( Rs.225 extra for the shrimp) ---it's too much confusing and irritating. Make a user friendly menu card please.

All the dishes were superb and we were highly satisfied by the way theu present the dish. Each and every dish tastes amazing. This place and these dishes are highly recommended.

The restaurant is over hyped and over rated. Food is standard cafe type. Decor is ok. But what i disliked the most is the behaviour of the staff. We entered the restaurant at 11pm. We were told that the bar shall be open till 11:30, hence we need to place our order before that. We ordered few drinks - which came to our tables at around 11:15pm. All of a sudden the waiters along with the floor managers, turn by turn, started coming to our table and insisted us to complete our drinks. The reason being that probably as per the excise law, consumption of alcohol needs to be completed by 11:30. Cutting the long story short, in a very short span of time we were kind of pushed to gulp down our drinks. This resulted in throwing away most of our drinks. Even the managers were not courteous. They also even misbehaved. Advice to the restaurant is that please train your staff to communicate these kind of issues at the time of taking the order itself. The guests definitely would not want to waste money by throwing away their money like this.

Chili's has a delightful assortment of delicacies for the ever hungry foodie. Though I am particularly partial to their steaks that are absolutely delicious and juicy and served with boiled veggies and mashed potatoes. The Creamy Jalape√±o Wings (you can opt for either boneless or bone-in) deserve special mention with the wings tossed in sauces that are both spicy and tangy, causing your mouth to explode with flavours that are hot and sweet at the same time.

The Mix and Match fajitas from Chili's is another offering you should try, especially if you are a meat lover. One can opt for a combination of meats (two/three) that usually contains pork, grilled chicken, buffalo steak and shrimps.

Chili's as a food joint is reasonably priced and serves quality food that is generous with quantity as well. Service is a bit slow but that is something I am willing to overlook for the amazing food experience they offer. A food joint that I keep going back to no matter the number of times I have been there. This is one place every food lover should try. Highly recommended.

I've actually lost count of the number of times I've been here. Being located at a stone throwing distance from my hospital, I've always chosen chili's whenever I wanted to have some good food and good time.
Ambience-- I love how the decor is done giving a very American bar kind of vibe and also the fact that it's well lighted! I always prefer to sit on the side overlooking the main road below..gives a beautiful view!
Food-- over my multiple visits I've tasted a lot of items from their menu and I don't really have any complaint regarding any dish! All are delicious, come in good quantity and most importantly make my soul happy!
Top picks-- cocktails- daiquiri and cosmopolitan. One of the best in town I say!
Starters-- texan cheese poppers- I'm a hardcore non vegetarian but these cheese oozing beauties don't need meat on them, yes that good!
Cheesy jalapeno meat balls and country fried chicken crispers-- to satisfy your meat cravings!
Mains-- their southwestern chicken makes it to my top 5 pizzas of all time..and the pasta is also one of the best I've ever had!
Orleans jambalaya deserves a special mention due to it's unique taste and the beautiful prawn & bacon toppings telling us a rice dish other than biriyani can also be yum!
Blackened fish with rice is also another item to watch out for and so is the red pepper chicken with rice
Some other favorites are the tex mex rice bowl and the tacos!
Desserts-- this is my favorite part cuz they have the BEST desserts section. Their molten chocolate lava came is insanely famous in the city because of the way it looks and tastes but I can die for their choco chip paradise pie. I can't explain in words how good it is. The choco skillet cookie and chocolate berry cake are other favorites!
Pocket pinch-- if you visit on Mondays and Tuesdays they have this special offer of 1:1 on food and drinks and it will cost you around 1200 for two for a full hearty meal. For non-offer days it will come around to 2000 for 2 but trust me its total value for money!
Overall-- this place exudes a positive energy. The staff are also radiant and make you feel comfortable. There are some places which you don't mind visiting again and again and this is one such place for me. Yes totally in love with chili's!

I have just one thing to say..... LEGENDARY!!!
I went on my birthday and thanks to chilis it turned to be a marvelous day indeed.
The staff greeted us warmly and was attending to all our needs pretty politely.
Priya, our waitress made it a wonderful experience for us.
Coming to the food we had
Imported baby back ribs- It was the most juicy and delicious pork ribs I ever had. Tender and soft, One above all. Just the way I like it. üíù

Grilled Chicken Platter- A wonderful treat to have.
The rice was intense and spicy... Really liked how its made. It was complimenting the grilled chicken perfectly.

Grilled Chicken Burger- This was without doubt the best burger I ever had. I savored its taste to the last bit.

Molteh Chocolate Cake - The ultimate Cherry on top was this.
All I can say is you've try this out, you just have to.

For drinks I wanted to have a margarita since it was my special day but unfortunately they needed one of your ID cards to verify our age but we weren't carrying any so had to skip that one.
This made me really sad.
We ended up with coke that has free refill at this place. I wish to come back soon to try the other items.
Highly recommend!!!

The mini watermelon tea was a too sweet but after adding water it came out perfect. I have to emphasize on the quality of service. The memory and eye for detail of Summita never ceases to amaze me. When she is present I know the occasion will be perfect.

Located on the 4th Floor of Quest Mall, Chili's offers a wide range of Texas Mexican style cuisine items and does not compromise on taste or quality. 

The restaurant has a very lively ambience and the waiting staff is very cordial and efficient in their work. 

The food was absolutely delicious and the serving quantity was ample. The Chipotle Fresh Mexican Rice Bowl and the Handcrafted Burgers are a must have!!

It was an enjoyable experience having a meal here and I would definitely be visiting again.

I had a really good time. The environment is very friendly and fantastic. The portion of food served here is quite large and worth every penny. Personally I like the smoked chicken fajita and the grilled chicken burger. 
Everything was good except that this time I felt the spices in the smoked chicken wings were too bland and so was the grilled chicken burger. But this was a one time thing so I would excuse them as I've been a regular in this place for over 6 months
My server was Sushmita who was prompt and friendly

I had a steak with bacon and chedder cheese. It was not that great to be honest. I had many gud steaks in my life and this was sure not one of them. It was dry and not succulent or seasoned properly. I am sure they used a lower grade of meat with very less marbling. Disappointing that for 700 or 750 odd bucks u get such steak!

The 4.7 star rating makes me wonder as to what I missed or did not notice ar Chili's. Visited this place on the insistance of my teenaged son. The menu looks exhaustive but once you order some items....you realise that the all taste the same. Literally....they are mostly deep fried stuff with loads of rubbery cheese and calories. The prices do not justify the quality or the ambience. Perhaps nowadays its the rule to be simplistic yet charge a fortune. The deep fried stuff left me restless throughout the night snd resolute not to visit again. Its entirely your call if you want to succumb to such unhealthy "American" stuff. Not my cup of tea....err....bowl of friesüòâ

We started with a steak fajita and the meat and the guacamole dip deserve special mention.Things just come together so beautifully when you dive into that fajita!The ancho chilli basa is that kind which shuts you up with your first mouthful because you are trying to form a memory of exactly how the fish melts in your mouth.Its breathtaking! Try the chocolate paradise pie because it is just the right kind of not too sweet dessert with the walnut setting off a beautiful burnt brown sugar taste.

For people who need to look at the blue sky while you eat and day dream(stimulated by that surreal food ofcourse)do grab a window seat.

Their service is very efficient,non intrusive and seamless.Look out for Mr Rashed for his naturally warm behaviour and great service.

Overall you get a full stomach, a full heart and you bless yourself for earning your own money.

P.S. If you want someone to desperately fall in love with you, coerce them into eating out at Chili's.

Never really got to review the place despite several visits throughout all the outlets in Kolkata. First things first, the ambience and the customer friendly service gets a 10/10.
Chili's has always amazed me when it comes to their food. My recent visit with family allowed me to order my favourite Chicken filled nachos with fillings and a mug of draught beer. Along with that, we ordered a chicken burger and a Tenderloin steak (medium rare). The overall experience was great as always. I've fallen in love with the chicken nachos that it becomes hard not to order another one when in the group.
The pulled pork burger ordered was also a popular dish I order in most occassions, and it was treated with love when I made my uncle try it's taste. Overall, it was a great Friday afternoon snack that we all enjoyed to the fullest. Will always come back for more.

A nice first time dining experience at Chili's @ Quest mall.
Sunday lunch with Colleagues could not have been better with variety of good dishes.

AMBIENCE (5/5) - Really nice...we were lucky to get a seat beside the window...

FOOD -
1) Creamy Jalapano Wings (5/5) - Really vry tasty...plz do give this a try...had a subtle flavour to it.
2) Smoked & Grilled Chicken (3/5).
3) Smoked Chicken & Roasted Corn Pizza (4/5)

4) Roasted Red Pepper Chicken Fajitas (4.5/5) - A must try if u r in Chili's...will satiate the taste buds of those who like their food a bit spicy...overall a vry nice dish.

5) Tortilla Crusted Chicken (5/5) - Yummmy.... Again a must try in Chili's... The bottom crusted chicken breast served with rice & sauce was the best dish that we had.

6) Ancho Chili Salmon Fish (3.5/5) - Presentation similar to Tortilla Crusted chkn...but the Citrus-Chilli sauce was the highlight of this dish...theres an option of taking Basa if u dont like Salmon.

7) Grilled Tenderloin Steak (1/5) - Although it was medium cooked...but the steak was quite tough...

8) Tenderloin Steak with Bacon & Cheddar Cheese (1/5) - Ordered with lot of expectations but unfortunately the steak was vry tough... difficult to chew...
If u r ordering any of the Steaks then u hav the option of selecting 2 sides out of six...Sweet Corn-on-the-Cob was vry good as a side...

DRINKS :-
1) Long Island Iced Tea (4.5/5) - vry nicely prepared cocktail.
2) Watermelon Margarita (2.5/5)
3) Blue Pacific Margarita (3.5/5)

SERVICE - Good, Cordial staffs.
Although they levy 10% Service charge on the total bill but they dont even Serve the food portions on the plates...

0.5 deducted for this extra 10% Service Charge...
0.5 deducted for vry tough Tenderloin steaks.

Made a sudden plan with my homies. A perfect place where you get the posh american restaurant feel. Meant for burger lovers like me. So we ordered for a cajun chicken burger & two ultimate bacon burgers. It totally justified with our taste buds. The staff also had good attention to detail. So one of my friends found the bacon quite stiff. One of the staffs over there named Diya was very proactive and informed her supervisor named Imran about the same, so he got two bacons for my friend. He was wowd! by the gesture. Amazing service. This is what anticipation of guest's needs mean. Cheers to Team Chili's. Way to go! Would definately like to go back.

Seems this place is famous for customer friendly staff?
Doesnt seem to be the case when d man in charge of the place stated, if I didnt want to get hurt I should end the conversation with him about why was I being charged extra service tax on the existing 18% GST.
This person threatened me in front of my wife and other present customers.
I have been coming here for years and after this behavior by this staff I will gladly take my business to TGIF
I have the bill and will file a formal complaint with the consumer forum.
Also the management contacted me to give in writing my grievance however that seemed to be farcical as no one has bothered to contact me back despite repeated emails to their inbox

The food although the portions were great for the money, but unfortunately was too American for my Indian taste buds. 
If you've a a knack for authentic American food, I'd suggest to check this place out.

Though the ambience was good but i found the food to be pretty ordinary when compared to the other competitors in the same genre such as TGIF... frankly it has been a disappointing experience n way overrated.. not going back to that place again

We ordered Grilled chicken burger and Chicken wings.  The Sauce on the wings was delicious. Personally I think the burger is overpriced by what they put inside per se. The food was 10/10. The staff is Very nice and attentive. The mistook the order of Grilled chicken burger üò´ but they changed the order üòÇ  Good place for a group hangout. ‚òá‚òá

Been with friends this evening. Had good time there. We ordered Cheese popers thrice as we liked it very much. Veg Santa Fe salad was also great. The only thing we didn't like was the paneer pizza. not tasting good. It was horrible. They did have mocktails . I ordered 2 of them which almost tasted same. Offers on some dishes and drinks was one plus one which was good. We asked the waiter to serve the salad but were told that it was self service restaurant. Well they can bring the dishes to table but cannot serve. Strange isn't it.

2nd visit at Chili's (1st one was at Acropolis outlet) As usual. Chili's never fails to impress me.. Had plans of going to The Irish Cafe but that was a fish market and Chili's saved our tummy.. The ambiance was amazing and the Food was Delicious..
We were 4 of us me and my wife and her two cousin brothers wanted to celebrate and Chili's was just the perfect place to hangout and eat..

We ordered for :
Southern Smokehouse Burger , it was in my wish list for a long time and damn! this was too good...
Southwest Caesar Salad, it was good but my fav will still be Terminal's Caesar salad..
Smoked Chicken Quesadillas , this was delicious, must try if you haven't.. Amazing preparation ..
Bacon and cheddar streak , well prepared with bacon and buffalo meat..
Grilled Chicken Platter , chicken breast with rice and veggies Loved the preparation ..
Tortilla crusted chicken was amazing too ..

For drinks we took a bucket with 4 Buds and Pina colada for the wife and long island iced tea .

Healthy food may be good for the conscience but these taste a hell of a lot better. A day well spent...

Me and my husband frequently visit this place. It's ambience and decor is of top notch and would give the 5 star hospitality a run for their money. The food is exceptional and classy and so is their service. A special mention for GOPAL for his most humble and professional behavior. 

Coming to food, I love their food menu, their deserts are lip smacking and so is their drinks. 
Just I would like to suggest that in the burger section, please use fresh patty rather than frozen which will give the dish a much better and fresh taste.

Whether u r on a date with your special someone or want to hang out with ur friends or just want to eat, chilis will never disappoint u. And the best part is its completely reasonable and pocket friendly.
I am definitely looking forward to visit chilis in the near future and would recommend to others as well. It won't disappoint you.

Pulled Chicken Burger and Fresh Mex Rice Bowl is my all time favourite here. Every bite of the burger has just the right amount of flavour without being extra spicy or extra cheesy. The Fresh Mex Rice Bowl has a lot of ingredients in it and probably will leave you believe it is there best dish. It's a dish that grows on you, the more you eat, the more you will like it.

3rd time, yes u ve seen it right, 3rd time I am visiting chili's outlet at Quest with different companion every time, and It never ceased to amaze me. This time It was 'Rashed' from Chili's team, who made my visit special with his delicious suggestions ... From Cocktails to Appetizers, Main Course to Dessert it was a 'cr√®me de la cr√®me' experience for me at Chili's. There is no dearth of restaurants at City of Joy, Bt there isn't another Chili's like this one in Kolkata. Thanks Chili's and Thanks Rashed fr such a evening.

Atimhsus' service was excellent. Very courteous and helpful. When I asked for something spicy for my sister in law, Atimhsus did not just gave me tobasco sauce, but she brought a bowl of chilli's hottest sauce! Kudos to her! 
Food-wise, some were great, some not so much. However, the quantity was massive. We couldn't finish our meal and had to pack some back. We ordered a pitcher of Campriska (not too sure about the spelling) and it was just the right accompaniment to the Mexican food. :)
We would have preferred the music to be a bit softer coz we ended up shouting over the dinner table to have a conversation.
All in all, a great experience! Would come back again.

I have been going regularly to Chilis.  I feel it is the best joint for Tex Mex food in Kolkata.  I used to go regularly when I used to stay in Philadelphia, USA.  The food and service is as good here as it was in the US.  I suggest they can add Margarita Pitchers which were very popular in the US.  I would also like to add that our visits are made extra great because of the service provided by Sushmita.  Her perfect order taking, appropriate suggestions and quick service makes it our number one choice in Kolkata .....

One of the well-known American casual dining restaurant chain that features Tex-Mex-style cuisine. The food is topnotch in terms of quality and presentation. The interior gives an American feel and their hospitality is worth mentioning. I visited the Quest Mall outlet for lunch and the ambience is a class apart. It is so lively and warm which makes you feel more comfortable. So let me take you through the food that I chomped on:

Starting off with Cocktails: 

Mango Yoghurt Smoothie, Chocolate Martini, Virjin Mojito, Appletini, Minty Melon, and Evolution. These will not only quench your thirst but give that satisfactory feeling. Liked all of them, but Appletini was best of the lot.

Starters: 

Smoky Chicken Wings ‚Äì Grilled, tender, chicken wings served with a barbecue dip. This was amazing, and just vanished in no time, a must order!

Creamy Jalapenos ‚Äì It is way beyond description, the taste, the texture the ranch dressing, mayo and the southwestern spices tossed in creamy sauce was  amazingly balanced giving the dish a perfect flavor. This is also a must have!!

Mains:

Pizza with chicken and roasted corn ‚Äì The first thing you will notice is the shape, this is not an usual round pizza but a rectangle one. Tasted good as usual.

Chicken Burrito with Chipotle Aioli ‚Äì This is a meal in itself. The burrito was enfolded with rice, pulled chicken, cream, corn salsa, avocado-based dip, spices and sour cream. It was coupled with tortilla, lettuce salad and black bean.

Roasted Red Pepper Chicken Fajita ‚Äì The main ingredients were onion, red bell pepper, grilled chicken breast. The melted cheese and sauce gave it a creamy coating with lots of flavor.

Sea Food Fajita ‚Äì This also contained red bell pepper and onion, in addition to it was fish and south western Cajun spice. The grilled garlic lime shrimp took the presentation to a next level of visual pleasure, it looked really tempting.

Sunrise Bacon Burger ‚Äì The legendry American style burger, topped off with a sunny side up poached egg and lots of cheese and fries. Again a must have!!

Desserts:

Mango Cheesecake ‚Äì I finished my meaty journey with a mango cheese and a Chocolate Raspberry cake. The sweetness was fabulously balanced and tasted heavenly. I would highly recommend this.

Over all a very nice and unforgettable experience, keep up the good work!!

I forget the name of the cocktail but it was too good. The food we have orderd, was more than sufficient for two of us. I have heard about their salad from so many friend and it deserve such complements. The salad was served with one piece of grilled chicken. And now about the blackened fish. this dish is also very testy and mouth watering. Planning to visit once.

Chili's is one of the best eat outs in quest mall. The menu is vast and offer more than enough quantity to fill your stomach. All the dishes on the menu are amazing and you wouldn't find even one dish which will disappoint you. Have tried the southwest pizza and pasta over there. The pizza is super cheesy and extremely filling. The pasta was nice too. Apart from that they offer happy hours on drinks everyday. They have limited dessert options but all of them are really nice. Mind you, the desserts are filling too. The dishes are a bit on the expensive side.

The "all time favourite of our family". We have visited the Quest Mall outlet...well,can't count ...,innumerable times....in lunch, in dinner,for snacks in the afternoon... The view is superb in both the Quest Mall outlet and the Acropolis one....specially if you can manage a window seat.If not,nothing to be disheartened.The ambience of the restaurant will always uplift your mood.The service is prompt.(though it was a bit disheartening for a couple of times in the Quest Mall outlet months ago but during some recent visits we have found they have regained their earlier status.)Options for cocktails are a bit limited.It would have been better if they would have introduced some new one periodically.Coming to the food I am feeling shortage of words to describe how  good it is.The proportion is really huge....even for the salads..a typical for the American standard.The mix and match fajitas,the chipotle chicken fresh Mex bowl, The Enchiladas with the Mexican rice ,the smocked chicken burger, blackened fish,crispy chicken with corn are not just foods but mood lifters as well. To merge taste with health there is hardly any option than ordering the salads at Chilies.  Santa Fe salad is one of my favourite though the grilled chicken one is also  equally good.The former one is a bit soggy But if mentioned while ordering,they will even serve the dressing sauce separately in a container..,you can add it according to your choice of measure or even omit .I don't use it and still enjoy the salad as mouth watering  because of their specialty marinated grilled/smocked chicken used in it in a large quantity.May be it is because of their special marination or whatever be the secret,we never tasted chicken so delicious anywhere except in Chillies.The Mexican rice they serve in fresh Mex bowl and with dishes like Enchiladas,Blackened fish is also my favourite.The most appreciating feature of the restaurant is their flexibility.Most of their dishes contain bacon or pork ham in it.But if you want to omit that they will happily do so or even add it to any other dish you prefer. To sum up,if from consumer's point of view we define  the term "brand" as  an assurance of a  certain quality with a never-to-fail consistency,Chillies is the best example  that comes first in our mind.

Went in to celebrate my birthday yesterday. Decided to start at the bar and then get a table later for dinner. The restaurant was packed, however, that didn't bother the staff as all of them were very courteous and alert. That happens with good training and a great team. 
We enjoyed the drinks and special shoutout to Amit at the bar, he was very friendly and informative. He recommended 3 drinks and they were all very good. 
He clearly knows what he is doing as he happens to have a great knowledge about the drinks. A great asset to the team, kudos!
Dinner was, as always amazing.. we had a great time!

This place has and always will be, special and close to my heart as it was here that we came for our very FIRST date. Over time, we started visiting this place regularly not only because of the emotional attachment but also because of its great ambiance, freaking good food and the overwhelming staff. Everyone makes sure you have a smile on your face while you leave :) i have been to numerous eateries and bars and pubs and clubs but very few in the city have such amazing staff! I would like to give a special shoutout to the amazing bartender, Amit! My boyfriend being a mixologist himself awes amit's work. Such a talent he is and on top of that, an amazing soul. Lots of love and best wishes Amit. Keep up the good work üëçüòä

‚ÄúEXCELLENT FARE TOPPED UP BY FRIENDLY SERVICE‚Äù

¬†
My wife and I are regular visitors to the Quest Mall in Kolkata. After shopping or after watching a film, we generally find ourselves in 'Chilis", a restaurant that we simply love. As you enter, the staff welcome you with a big smile. Their approach and demeanour is a perfect example of professionalism coupled with hospitality and it come off as natural and not put on. Last night, we were served by Sushmita who helped us with our orders of food and drink. My wife ordered a veg soup with Santa Fe salad while I ordered the non veg soup with Texas Trio. The soup was filling and both the salad as well as the main dish were made to perfection. The bartender too knew how exactly to mix the drink and the cocktails I had (Manhattan) was also made to perfection. The ambiance is cheerful and inviting. Of all the restaurants we visit in Kolkata, this definitely rates amongst the best.

This was my fifth time visiting the Quest mall outlet.And I must say that this time around too, the food did not disappoint me. a must mention that I had the wonderful server Riya to guide me through the new set of menus launched by them.Got my favourite window side seating too :)Though the only let down was the staff's lack of knowledge on app booking probably....because knowing it will be a weekend visit, I had pre-booked a table through a certain app. Neither my booking gave me any help or edge otherwise nor did I find somebody at the entrance of the outlet, which in my previous visits had the receptionist with a really perky smile, to help me out in this matter.But nonetheless, since the food was scrumptious, I can let this one slide :)

We also ordered ribs which were delicious and had an excellent crutch to the edges. I only wish the temperature was controlled better, it was freezing cold in some parts of the restaurant. But besides that, it's a great experience. I'd come back again!

My friends and I visited Chili's last evening. I have already been here thrice and my experience was  pretty good. Thus, we chose to celebrate a birthday at this venue yesterday. We ordered a Texas cheese popper,a Texas Trio, grilled steak and shrimp fajita and roasted red pepper chicken. Along with the food, we ordered a minty melon and cosmopolitan. Unlike other times, yesterday's meal was highly unsatisfactory. The Texas cheese popper and the salmon in the Texas Trio was good but the pork was smelling and my friend could hardly eat it. The fajita was pretty much tasteless and I've eaten the same fajita last year, portions have definitely reduced. The minty melon and cosmopolitan were not that great either. However,Chili's sung for the birthday girl and treated her to a brownie and ice cream. The ambiance was cheerful and service by Gopal was prompt. I'm definitely going to think twice before visiting Chili's again.

I went on a Tuesday with online seat conformation . While shown the same at the entrance they told me to wait like other few customers. so dineout online seat reservation won't help you once you check in. I get inside in few minutes only . ambience was good but I personally felt little noisy . ordered Ancho Basa and Red Pepper chicken. while about to order Draught beer , they told its just finished . Hence bound to order bottled beer .( kingfisher ultra). the attendant came with 2 bottles of chilled beer to show how cold are they. I had some cold and calf so asked for lesser chilled one. he taken that back after opening the other for my companion. about 10 mins passed none came up with that beer. while reported to floor manager , I got that. Seems the guy forgot that pending one. Food was ok. nothing special to me nor I can complain . for buy one get one its ok. but if ordered individual:  the price is too expensive. while about to order another pair of kingfisher ultra  they told its finished . how disgusting . 1st the draught beer now the brand we had taken finished . they told us to order other brand but we didn't . how a restaurant runs with such edgy inventory ? somehow it was not a happy dine out for us. Lastly they charge 10% service charge . For this service why one should give 10%.

Have been here loads of times, but yesterday I was very impressed with my server. I beg pardon for not remembering her name although she had mentioned it twice to me. 
So I dropped my beer on the food by mistake and she replaced the whole dish. It was a fajita platter. Big cheers to her and the whole chili's team. Great hospitality!

This is the third time I am visiting chili's and first time for quest outlet. Unlike my previous visits this one somehow left me unhappy. Most noisy outlet among three. Service is not up to the mark. Moreover I am totally dissatisfied with the burgers (pulled chicken & sunrise chicken). Too small options for mock tails. Out of four we took three although taste good (fusion, blue Pacific & evolution). Smoked chicken wings are different & good though not great. It seems that experiment with different items did not work for me.

Just fantastic. Do order triple dipper and chicken bbq burger , the chicken will just melt in ur mouth, it is so soft n tender. 

Thumbs up- superb food, great serving and goes along with ur drinks. Plus the occasional offers like BOGO are like cherries on the top. 

Thumbs down- at times the starters were very oily thus was not able to eat it.  Had to cancel it later on. Prices are quite high couldve been cheaper.

It was a  busy place, on a Thursday evening, located on the 4th floor of Quest mall. Food was ok but service was indeed dissapointing. First impression was the worn out plastic mug in which they served water. Badly need to replace them with new ones! We were 3 of us and ordered non veg ultimate dipper with fried shrimps and sante fe quesadillas. For drinks we ordered blenders pride whisky and mango yoghurt smoothie. 
The chicken crispers were really oily and we felt a bit salty too. They forgot to bring the dips along with the ultimate dipper. After repeated reminder to their different staffs it finally got served. They bought the drinks too late and again had to ask them over and over again for refilling. Pricing was a bit on the higher side considering their sluggish service. I also noticed that the waiters in a group of 3-4 often gather beside the entrance (where  they have kept the computer for placing orders) and joke around and sometimes even discussing about a customer whom they were servicing.
I think the place is over hyped with real poor service and would definitely recommend Cafe Mezzuna (in Forum Mall) over it. CHEERSüòÉ

I was let down by this outlet of chili's with snail paced service and misorganisation regarding reserving and allotment of tables.

The buy one get one menu items lack that quality of taste which is present in the main menu. 

Texas trio: this was really awesome. Salmon, chicken and pork ribs. Served with veggies, corn and mashed potatoes. 

Tenderloin burger: this was from the offer menu and it was not delicious. Better less said about it.

This was another dish from the offer menu and name of which I don't remember. It was chicken served with rice and dip. Again this lacked the lusture of quality taste. 

Draught beer:: this was good
Blue pacific Margherita: this was good too

We went there for dinner, and would like to mention some highlights 

We ordered French Fries, Trio Rita, cottage cheese fajita, corn on the cob, penne pasta, skillet chocolate with Ice cream and Molten shake.

French Fries - aptly cooked and correct serving temperature.
Trio Rita - three mini margaritas, nicely served. Blue lagoon one could still have been better.
Cottage cheese Fajita - I like the presentation and portion size but paneer should have been a bit fresher and softer.(was a bit on the harder end)
Corn on the cob - tasty and flavourful
Pasta - Really delicious and authentic taste served with good quality bread.
Skillet Chocolate with Ice cream - a perfect dessert. Great fusion of hot and cold products
Molten Shake - regular Choco shake.

Quality 4.5/5
Service 5/5
Cleanliness 4.5/5
Value for money 4/5

Overall a good dining experience with comfortable seating and baby chairs available.
Good service and timely preparations 
An overall  4.5 out of 5 from my side.

We visit this place regularly
Cheers team Chili's

I have heard alot about this place and finally i visited this place to enjoy some vegetarian options and i was not at all disppointed. The Cheese balls and Nachos were exactly the way I thought tasty and cheesy I would like to thank our waiter Imran who made us feel like an old and regular customer and served us with a smile on his face during our entire outing although the Liit can improve a bit.

Stepped into the Chili's at Quest after spotting an offer for a free starter for those holding a movie ticket. This turned out to be a pretty excellent deal as the only stipulation wast hat one must order a main dish and the starter must be of lower cost, and most of Chili's vegetarian starters and main courses were similarly priced.¬†

We got the vegetarian dipping platter as our starter which turned out to be just too much-fried food though all 4 elements were fine enough on their own. The vegetarian fajita was pretty excellent with surprisingly excellent rice and beans. ¬†Enough to satiate two people and more at the price of a single main!¬†

We got a table by the window and it was an early lunch so the place was unusually empty and quiet making for a nice meal

Even though we are regulars at Chilis, we had a horrible experience last night. We had called them up and made a reservation; however when we got there, they did not have any noting of it. After waiting for half an hour, we were lead to a table but due to miscommunication of the staff and the manager it was given to someone else. We complained to the manager about the whole issue but he was very rude and wasn't ready to believe that we had been waiting for so long. Finally after the long wait, we got a table and ordered some margaritas but they weren't up to the mark. When we asked about it, we were told that the sweet and sour syrup they usually use was not available. Why not say this before we ordered??
Im only giving a 2 star rating because our server Deepayan was great and went out of his way to make our evening better. He even got us a few complimentary dishes. Overall though, we won't be visiting this place again and will be recommending that others don't as well.

Horrendous food. The beef and pork is probably of the lowest quality. If you are a vegetarian pretending to be Americanized you might give it above 3 stars. If you have been to any other chillis outlet this is going to be the worst by far.

Visited this place on a busy time with India Pakistan match on. The place was almost full. We got a seat in one corner. Service was slow from the very beginning. 
We ordered for few pints of Beer. A Classic Milk shake which tasted average.
For food we ordered Chipotle Chicken Pizza, tasted average. And Smoked and Grilled Chicken wings which was good enough.
The food came around half n hour later, service should be improved a lot.

When it iz about exotic flavours, Chili's add some real flavour to the taste bud of every Kolkatan. With A-class ambiance and wide varieties of food, Chili's come with Bang. Located at the 4th Floor of the Quest Mall. Been there few days ago, when my taste buds were craving for Steak. So lets come and explore this place.

Positive Point -

1. Food - In one word, amazing. Every dish is made of lotz of skill, perfection and love.

2. Ambiance & Management - Chili's have both Simple dining part and Bar Part. During entering to the Restaurant, they will ask you where to sit! Well decor and helpful stuffs are really something that increase your expectation level in a certain height. Stuffs are all very suggestive and take care about the satisfactory factor of their each customer.

Negative Point -

1. Pricing - Pricing of most of the items are towards high. But with some real special exotic flavours, you can compromise it.

Now come to food. I ordered -

1. Blue Pacific Mocktail - Actually I was trying to place the order for Blue Pacific Margarita! But as I was failed to show them any of my Id, they refused me to served any alcoholic drinks and I got their point. So kudos to the rule and discipline they follow. Although I was not served any kinda Alcoholic drinks, the stuff who was taking my order, didn't disappoint me. ¬†She offered me the same drink but with non alcohol based which was not in their menu. It reflects how much they take are aware to take care of the the taste of their customer. The drink was based on water and soft drinks. Like it. Distinct flavour of lime and mint add the refreshness to the drink. As a startup drinks, it is just perfect. Full recommended it.

2. Grilled Tenderloin - I love the steak they served. Probably of the best tenderloin, I've ever tasted. I choosed my steak to be medium grilled and took Seasonal veggies and homemade fries as my side item. Tenderloin were perfectly grilled, not too oily in nature and the fries were too good. Overall a must try item for every steak lovers.

With two item mentioned above, it costs around 950INR, which is high when it is about a single person's dining bill. But with the quality of food, exotic tastes you can compromise the high pricing. Overall a good dining experience.

Love the ambience and the warmth with which the staff greets you ! There are good many options in non vegetarian section as compared to vegetarian course . We had ordered for cheese quesadilla , rice and vegetable fajitas and pasta. Love the first two items . The presentation of fajitas is really good specially how they serve the various dips . Deserts are mind blowing . It simply amazing . 
Overall the experience is nice 
PS - you should be comfortable with the kind of they serve . It's very different from our Indo Chinese or Italian

Went there on a friend's birthday treat.. and in a few words the experience was overwhelming.. the friendly staffs who exactly understood what we wanted and what not..thereby helping us choose our meal because it's not everyday that you come across places serving chicken, beacon and buffalo meat with same endeavour..
The view--- it started raining yesterday and saw my rain-soaked city through the moistened glass walls..heavenly.
As it was my friend's birthday-- so the entire team of the staff came with the cake,decorated with candles and sang a lovely happy birthday.
Meal-- we went for ongoing BOGO offer..
Starter--(2)cheese balls and chicken wings
Main-course---chicken taco, (2)grilled chicken platter, burger.
Cheese balls were just to die for so much so that we ended our meal with ordering a second helping of cheeseball on a-la-carta basis.. the taste was amazing..service is quick..
We were four. Cost was ---‚Çπ1860. But the taste and experience was priceless..will definitely go again..

We went on Monday ..the day where they offer u 1:1 on selected items and drinks.
We ordered a chicken platter, chicken wings , veg tacos and veg nachos.
The food items were okayish in proportion.
However the rice which they served along with the chicken platter and veg tacos tasted a bit bland.The chicken wings were good which comes 10 piece per plate.The chicken platter consisted of a chicken  breast piece along with rice and sautte veggies.The best part was the Nachos which were crisp and tasted too good.
We ended off with Chocolate skillet and brownie.
The chocolate skillet was the best part with vanilla ice cream on a baked chocolate dough.The brownie too tasted good.
The ambience is nice with loud beautiful music playing.
The only complaint is ..I felt it would be good if the choicws on 1:1  menu was made a bit more extensive.

It's Always an Excellent experience at Chilli's Quest Mall. The food is consistently good and service is friendly with a cheerful attitude and ambience. My servers were Sharik and Sudip and they took great care of us. In a group where we had 1 toddler and 2 children special care was taken from start to finish and the kids even got balloons at the end of the meal. Souvik the manager on duty runs a great outfit! Congrats and I will be back soon.

The place looks staight out of one of those American movies. The decor is not over the top, yet way too elegant and charming. It seems like a perfect place for any kind of a gathering as well as a date.

The food is mindblowing to say the least. I have had their non veg triple dipper, the old timer and the margarita pizza. And savoured every single item. Totally droolworthy. Their oreo shake as well as the cherry coke were amazing too.

Will definitely be revisiting soon.

Been to Chili's at Quest mall yesterday n had a delightful experience... We ordered chicken wings for starters which ws light crispy n succulent. Blackened Basa Fish for entr√©e was d most delicious selection... d fish was melt-in-the-mouth kindof soft n properly cooked. The grilled chicken platter was perfect n d chicken steak ws perfectly seasoned. Both dishes were served wid veges n rice which overall made a perfect combination. For desserts we tried Brownie Sunday... d best brownie with icecream experience I have had in recent times. Food was overall superior in both quality n quantity. One more thing which amazed me about this place is the ambience.... Proper grill-n-bar yet kid n family friendly. The staff has been very courteous n prompt at their service. I strongly recommend dis place n I myself will look forward to visit again n try out big variety of other delicacies this restaurant offers!! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Great place to visit with family and friends. Have been out there before as well and liked the food and ambience too. Have ordered Strawberry Lemonade and Simple Lemonade for refreshments. Quite like the taste. For starters we had ordered Southwest Ceaser Salad. I really liked the dressing and the quantity. Well sufficient for 3-4 people.

For main course we ordered Veggie and Cheese Quesadillas also Classic Margherita Pizza. TBH it was really a lot of meal so 3 people. But we really enjoyed our time. The gesture of the staffs were very gentle as well. Would love to visit again.

Apps like zomato has taken our dine in experience to a different level. Even before we have booked our table we know what to order, what not to' how much ur pocket ll pinch and so forth. As a downside, it robs you of the 'exploring a new place' xperience. Moreover, some reviews are so detailed that you can almost taste the dishes. With Chilli's everything was beyond stererotype. As i munched down the best burger of my life, i wondered, how underrated this place is. A 4.7 seemed conservative to me with the most exotic salad and mocktail. What better place i thought to celebrate my wife's bday. She personally wanted to go to Barbeque Nation, but i m sure she must be so happy the place was overbooked for lunch. Kudos Team Chilli's.

Excellent food, nice ambiance, staffs are friendly. Prices are a bit higher, but that's understandable. Burger, steak, pork ribs, tex-mex foods all are delicious. Chocolate truffle cheesecake is just out of the world. Try to grab a window-side table because it offers a good view of the ol' city.

Honestly speaking , Chili's is definitely overhyped! Food is good but not mind blowing .
We ordered 2 dishes - one was chicken fajitas and the other one whose name I forgot, sorry for that!!

Dishes were well cooked because obviously that's the bare minimum one can expect if one is paying 380+TAX for a single piece of chicken with little amounts of side dishes!!!! I am amazed at people never complaining about how little they are getting for such huge amounts . U spent 1k and then wonder what did you actually eat ?! 250 for a piece of cake ? None of our stomachs were full !! One seriously needs to observe this !!

Staffs were polite and gentle. When we visited it was mostly empty so ambience was good . We got the window-side table and I simply loved the view .

To sum it up , nice experience, good food , peaceful ambience but definitely OVERPRICED n OVERHYPED.

Finally, visited chili's for the first time. The experience was really awesome. I loved their menu. My order for yesterday was a smoked chicken quesadilla n peach moji-tea. While my mother ordered a mushroom and chicken soup and a grilled chicken mexican dish(don't remember the name). I'm so in love with their menu. I would visit them soon to try their tacos,burritos and burgers. Their service is quick and nice. And now,the most important part- food. They taste delicious. And the portions are also good. Enough to fill a over-hungry stomach.

If you feel like having something different from Indian food, that's one of the best places where you can go!
The menu is quite wide, they have a big range of burgers, different kind of meat, fish, quesadillas..and any other kind of Tex mex food. You can also get pizza there, but I haven't tried it yet.
Oh, and the desserts are just delicious, after finishing it you will feel like having more and more.
The staff is very friendly and helpful in the choice. 
If you get there ask about Sushmita, she's super kind and always smiley!

I must say they have a wide variety of choices, quality and quantity commendable.. and if u go during the happy hours then u r surely in for a treat.. I had their tortilla chicken and fajitas and tacos which simply tastes exotic. And definitely not to forget they have a wide range of cocktails which atleast costs less than the other food outlets at quest. And last but not the least I would definitely like to mention one thing about this outlet of Chilli's they have a very well maintained and courteous staff especially there is one named 'Riya' who was extremely polite and attentive towards our needs.. Will drop in shortly, whenever I'm in quest this place is always there in my bucket list..üòöüëçüëç

The food is finger licking delicious, the music is just right to set up ur mood, the waiters are very friendly and helpful, they don't let u order excess, which shows that they care about wastage of food and customer satisfaction over money. Overall a should goto restaurant for peeps who haven't visited it yet. Thank u sushmita (our server) for makin my visit a memorable one.

Chilis' is a favourite hangout because of the ambience and the wonderful service and friendly staff members ( e.g. Rashed)
The food is delicious and one must try the molten chocolate cake!

It was my second visit to Chili's and this time too it was a delight. I met an old friend over a Long Island Iced Tea Pitcher and the rendezvous added to my favourite memories list. We went there during happy hours and we were literally giggling when we got our second pitcher free. The staff there made us more happy. Would love to mention Ria Halder who helped us all through . From choosing our drinks till the end , she was a fantastic support. Kudos to her and her team. Well done Chilli's.

Truly was a an experience to remember as my service was on point. Dorothy, an employee of Chilli's Grill & Bar, in particular was exceptional. She was dedicated and hard working, making sure all his customers and not only me, were made to feel comfortable. I should really think that shea would deserve to experience the Chilli's atmosphere that your headquarters in Dallas, Texas possess as I have visited the Chilli's outlet there as my time as a student. Please take this review into consideration and look into this young upcoming man. Thank you

Today a very close friend and I were meeting after many months üòÅ
We almost always choose chilli's and this time we decided on the buy one get one free offer available on Mondays and Tuesdays
They have a special menu for this which is way more limited than the regular menu.
We chose crispy chicken tacos. I had mine with bacon. It was served with rice and we chose french fries instead of kidney beans. The bacon pieces are microscopic and there is a fairly sized portion of chicken and plenty of lettuce and cheese. We got 2 large pieces of taco each and a small basket of fries. The rice was not too good. Fries were good. Eating tacos is a messy business so beware üòÇ

For dessert we had brownie sundae. This was okay. The brownie wasn't too chocolatey though

My personal opinion is that the offer menu yields dishes which are not as good as the regualr dishes. I have had the choco lava cake before and that brownie is more gooey and yum. Go in for this if you are broke (which we are üòÖ) but you might not enjoy it as much as the regular dishes.

Cost wise this is a steal. 4 dishes came to 747 bucks. Cheaper if you choose not to have bacon.

Come a little earlier than one since after that the restaurant starts fillimg up

Service is good. as you enter and leave i think 10 people in total will thank you for coming ‚ò∫

Hope this helps. Cheers !

Staff was courteous as ever and Susmita.kar@futuregroup.in   was more than courteous to suggest the menu and helped in our choice. The best part of the chain is that the standard is same whether you are in Chillis at Quest, South City, or at DLF Mall in Noida or in New Delhi.

I've been here multiple times already and have had a different experience each time! Chili's is a brand in itself, so to begin with, it's gonna be expensive and their food, doesn't suit everyone's palate. 
I've had their LIT and I feel it's a bit diluted and could be stronger! Their country fried calamari and molten chocolate cake are excellent. I've also tried their zesty chicken pasta and grilled chicken platter. Not bad. However, it was their non veg triple dipper that disappointed me.

We were there in the chilis grill for the second time. Today the host was Ms. Dwarathi and Ms. Sushmita. Both of them were extremely well behaved and they were very keen to make us feel comfortable. Sorry if I have spelled your names incorrectly. The other person who was Ms. Ria who took the order. She also was well behaved and good. She needs to improve in her English a little bit. She tried to help us in every possible manner with the order we placed. Thanks to her. I believe that people who work hard achieve success and in chilis grill everyone is giving their best. I would thank whole team of chilis grill. Thank you for your hospitality.

Chili's is usually a place that has great happening ambience, good food and great staff. But unfortunately not this outlet is what I think. We went there yesterday for lunch and they had this Monday Tuesday offer going on. The menu they had was little confusing as there were appetizers and main course and desert so it looked like u have to buy a set of three and the second set comes for free when we asked the service guy he explained it in a way which made it more confusing. However, we placed an order of two chicken platter and one chicken pizza in food and three mojitos. The pizza was very well done crispy and hot but had less cheese and the chicken in the chicken platter was so hard and bland but the rice saved it somehow, but again the dip was so watery and bland, the beans were whole and not done properly. We were going to order desert but did not having a bad experience with food. Also a mention on the service, I had to ask a girl there who's handling our table because no one seem to bother. The guy she pointed out was behaving as if he's been forced to work. I have been to this outlet earlier but the previous visit was fairly better however after this trip I am not visiting this outlet again

Oh... whenever I hear Chilli's I remember that so awesome huge glass of molten chocolate shake and the ultra delicious triple dipper.

The staff was corteous, organised and well mannered.

We also had veg quesadilla, it was good, but nothing beats the veg rolls in the triple dipper, oh I still drool with the name. And the shake was beyond awesome, simply delicious and filling.

The cost came around to 2800 for three people but was totally worth it.

Food - Excellent taste!! Really good. The burgers and Fajitas are something you won't be dissatisfied with, ever. Quantity and quality both are upto the mark.

Ambience - Quest one has a bit of compromise here - not due to there fault the crowd is always very energetic here.

Drinks & Beverages - Innovative and has a feel of celebration to it. The drinks look amazing and so is the taste!üòã

Highly recommended!!

We went there on a Tuesday, and availed the Buy One Get One offer. We ordered crispy chicken tacos and classic bacon burger. We had planned to order tenderloin steak too, but it was unavailable. Both the food items tasted really good, though I believe, the food needs to be served hotter, in order to be enjoyed fully. Crispy chicken tacos could have been crispier too. Overall, we had a lovely time. We were filled to the brim, spending less than 500 bucks, thanks to the offer !! :D

Oh boy, I've heard so much about this place. I have been there just once. Ordered Mexican - Chicken and Steak Fajitas, and Cottage Cheese Fajitas. Nothing else really. It wouldn't be fair to write a review based on just this. But I can't hold back. For anyone who has tasted real Mexican food, I have to tell you how bad this was. Just easily the worst Mexican I have ever had. In fact this was not Mexican at all, by any stretch of imagination. I presume they are better at other dishes like Burgers etc . . . but the quality of world food in Kolkata is something that I have learned the hard way. Simply horrible. Oh! Calcutta is about the only thing worth spending on. Everything else is a waste of time and money.

Chilli's hasn't been new to ma as I have been living in Bangalore since 2012 much before the bongs in Bengal got the taste of it .. I am the bong in Bangalore 

And this was my second visit to Chilli's, Quest Mall .. 1st was around the time it had opened and the 2nd was on the 30th of May 2017 .. Must say the second visit was 5x better than the first. I have a travelling job and it was imperative to have a kickass lunch after serious Morning board room experience. 

So I was at Chilli's and went for Tripple Dipper ( hope I got the name right ) and the super tasty mango cheese cake .. I can still savour the flavour of the food. It was super awesome and super sumptuous. And I mean it .. I work in the customer service industry and always look forward to great service wherever I go .. "Sudip" - Yes you got it right "Sudip" was super awesome and the man who made our lunch even better with the tireless and super friendly service .. Man you rock and you have created a benchmark for other fellas in the house . 

Super impressed and next time I am there, I am surely gonna buy this gentleman a drink and hope the management will not have any issue with that .. 

Cheers Guys !!

This particular visit was a quick dash on our last day in Kolkata and we partook of a triple dipper and some drinks. As usual the triple dipper was fabulous.

This is an international chain of restaurant known for its Mexican and American cuisine. This outlet is no different. The ambience is pretty similar to the airport outlets of Chill's in US. Staff is friendly and noninvasive which is the way it should be. Food is of international quality and Margarita's are top notch.

This place always pleases us with the perfect combination of components in whatever they serve. The ambience is a cheerful one with totally American decor. We had shrimp fajitas and chicken rice bowl with additional prawns to eat, and a mixed fruit smoothie to drink (they could not serve us a hot beverage). Both the fajitas and the chicken bowl were perfectly made, full of taste and quite generous in quantity. The mixed fruit smoothie was essentially a strawberry one - so there's an improvement point. Because of the rush, the service had been a little slow - however thats explicable. We recommend this place very much. Special attention is given to the kids by greeting them with an activity sheet and two crayons. Cheers to such a fun filled place.

This was my first visit, and I'm in love with this place. Full points on the service, the ambience and the food!
We ordered a grilled chicken burger, a non veg triple platter with 6 dips and 3 cocktails. 
In all this place deserves multiple visits.

Pathetic..!!! Is one word... NCR chili's much much better... we ordered smoked chicken... and bloody marry... chicken was sobby and taste less... missing on the touch of herbs and not roasted properly... the drink was missing several ingredients and thus the taste... cocktail making is an art which is yet to be learnt by them... even the glass differs with different cocktails, which to my surprise, they are unaware of and expressed an indifferent acceptance of feedback... 
way to go.... dont know how these food joints get raving reviews... starting to feel uncomfortable now about kolkata foodies... or am i missing the reviews by seniors... i dont know...

Visited the food joint again. Again satisfied...

Food wise rating:

Santa Fe salad 5/5

Excellent taste. Thanks Riya for the suggestion.

Buffelo Steak 4/5

Medium rear steak, almost cooked to its perfection.
Almost because the steak was less seasoned with salt n pepper. So it was blunt in taste. I have to pour a lot of salt n pepper to make it testy. 

Ancho Salmon 5/5

Again a great suggestion from Riya.
Perfectly cooked. Superb testy. 

The lunch as a whole was great.

Looking for a place that could satisfy your taste buds, then one must definitely drop in here. It's a best place to hangout with your friends, grab a cocktail and enjoy the music with definitely some extraordinary delicacies. Table reservation recommended on weekends.
We ordered overloaded chicken burger,Quesidillas, grilled chicken fajitas with some cocktails and had a finger licking experience. One visit isn't enough to explore the scrumptious cuisines.
PS: Always keep a room for dessert.
The place is little expensive but the ambience,service and food quantity makes it all worth it.

Now lets talk about the main part which is food. We ordered one Smoked Chicken Wings, Tandoori Grilled Platter, Salmon Steak and one Non-Alcohol Mojito. Smoked chicken was very good specially with the sauce which they gave. Salmon steak was very juicy and soft. It was served with rice and it tasted so good. I am not a fish person but I would recommend all to try caus it was awesome. Tandoori platter which was chicken steak was also great. I just loved the food. My ratings are below -

Just one word of caution though, the chocolate molten cake is huge and sinful. It is not meant for one person. The portions are sumptuous and Chili's remains my favourite place in the city.

I had been wanting to visit chillis ever since it opened in the quest mall but couldn't for a long time.
But finally did make it to this American restuarant.
The ambience is relaxing especially the city view which you get is very pleasing.
The service was quick.
I had tried the Roasted pepper chicken, chipotle chicken pizza and the molten chocolate cake.
Loved the roasted pepper chicken and molten chocolate cake.
But the chipotle chicken pizza was not upto my expectations.
Overall it was a great experience.

Except the tacos, everything was pretty fine. Initially I didn't like the place where we were given seat. It was too sunny for my liking but as we were already late for lunch and by the time we exited, it was evening so I didn't mind when it got cloudy outside to block the light. The basa fish was the most interesting one. Chili's never fails to give us a good time.

As always maintained the usual Chili's standards- great food with excellent quality of service! The food was wonderful, justifying it's a-little-too-high price tag! The starters.. the main course.. and even the desserts... all were quite enthralling to my taste buds! But yeah! I would have to say this.... the desserts were a bit too sweet for my liking... but that'll differ from person to person!
Coming to the service... This was one of the highlights of my visit to the Quest Mall branch of Chili's! I was greeted and escorted quite cordially to my table, where I got introduced to my server RIA (just to tell you, I don't know her personally and this is in no way a promotional stunt... its just a recommendation on the basis of my visit)! This lady was a really jolly person.... which is pretty nice to have as your server, to talk to and discuss about the various foods and offers, instead of having someone more 'bland'! She was really courteous... helped us decide our choice of food quite emphatically, gave information on all the offers that were available which helped a lot in saving some cash (l.o.l), and delivered it to us pretty quickly too! The food came from the kitchen really quickly! And up until this point I couldn't say that the service got at all sloppy at any point! 
But yes... we got the bill(or 'check' as they call it), a bit late.. due to some communication problem among the staff... but no points cut for that!
All in all a 0.5 marks deduction just so that they dont get over confident :-p

My friends have raved about the quantity and the quality of the food at Chili's, so much so that I began to nurse quite a hankering for the mouthwatering delicacies of the famed establishment. Hence, it was with high expectations that I walked into Chili's on an early Sunday afternoon. The thing that immediately struck me about the place was the ambience. There was only one word to describe it: rustic. The music appealed to all walks of life. From easy R&B to classic, unadulterated rock. After claiming my seat in one of the numerous booths, a waitress swooped down on me with a menu card. Since, I was ordering for a considerable number of people, I ordered the Ultimate Dipper. For those who don't know, the ultimate dipper comprises four types of poultry and egg rolls. It came with a literal tower of dips. The food was piping hot, but for six people, it wasn't feasible have equal portions for all. Hence, ordering two of those is recommended. In order to compensate for the unequal distribution, we ordered a Classic Nachos with chicken. 12 pieces of crispy, cheesy goodness. For the mains, we ordered three bacon and tenderloin burgers, a bacon and chicken burger, a chicken fajita sizzler and a Tex Mex rice bowl. The burgers came with copious amounts of thick and crispy French fries. The meat was juicy and filling. The burger was perfectly sized for that messy satisfying eating experience. Again, a tower of dips was provided for our convenience. The service at Chili's was professional. The details were expertly elicited from the customer, of the cooking time of the steak, any eating restrictions, etc.
I have only two qualms about the magnificent piece of work that is, Chili's. The price of the items is a tad on the higher side, although the quantity matches the number, I still feel that there could be room for improvement. For six people, I had to shell out about ‚Çπ5000.
Secondly, the waiting time could be shortened considerably. The Ultimate Dipper, for instance, arrived 20 minutes after ordering.
All in all, Chili's is the perfect spot for large crowds, provided you have slightly deep pockets and a fair amount of patience.

Super fast delivery!!!! That's one thing u will see. The waiting time for food was so less that it got us by surprise. The menu is spread out nicely but u need an attendants help to know certain terminology. Taste wise its very good. Probably the only thing that was a bit negative was the noise around. It was a bit too loud.

I went to The chili's grill and bar today.The staff was really welcoming and the decor was really amazing.
I ordered just a countryside chicken pizza and a sprite.
The food was really good.
No disappointments at all and this is a must go.
Enjoyed a lot there.

I have lost count of how many times I have been to this place. Cozy ambience. Good food.

I love their Classic Nachos, Chicken wings and Calamari Rings. I have had the best Fresh Lime Soda at this place!

I think Veg Quesadilla is not the dish for me. That's the only dish which I did not like.¬†

P.S. if you order Pizzas, ask for a thin crust. That tastes much better.

Wanna try some casual American fast food? This is the place to be. Although you might have to wait a little to get a table but the juice is worth the squeeze. Try their American cheese balls and quesadillas. For dessert i would recommend their chocolate truffle. The food is fresh and well prepared and the staff is professional.

Went here with some friends a week or so ago when they had the buy one get one free deal for certain items. The chicken wings were a little overly sour, but they were extremely tasty. The rice bowl was, according to my friends, somewhat underwhelming, but the fajita was good. However, my dish, the honey chipotle crispers, was simply out of this world. Absolutely amazing taste and texture, and the french fries were spot on, too. Now, I've been to Chili's quite a few times before, and here's a tip: They have a side dish called mashed potatoes with gravy. I don't know what they put on it, but it might be the most amazing thing I've tasted in my life, and it's just mashed potatoes! You MUST try that, no matter what else you're eating. Their brownie sundae was also extremely delicious. All in all, great place.

I had heard very high praise about Chilli's which drove me to visit the moment I got a chance. While the ambience of both the restaurant and the bar section is really great, neither the service nor the food met my expectations, which were high to be frank. I've never imagined mexican food could be bland! Also, the server was kind of an one upper; when I ordered a medium steak he said that 'it'll be too bloody for your taste'! How does one assume that I've never had a steak before! I had to ask for cutlery and also for water, repeatedly. We over ordered, and they did not even say what amount of sides come with each plate their only concern being why we did not want any beer with out food. The 'well done' steak was very leathery, and chewy. They served every dish ordered together, which did not help at all. Getting sneered at an restaurant is not cool. I'll not visit this particular restauran again, at least.

As the rant is over, the non-veg dipper was super tasty.

2 stars for food, 1 for service, 5 for ambience.

Got acquainted to chili's first when I was in Hyderabad in the year 2015.. It was my first experience with American soul food.. The menu was amazing... my opinion changed when I paid a visit to the Kolkata outlet at Quest mall.. The quality, taste and quantity fell down..A brand name like Chili's should maintain their standards right throughout their chain..

Heaving said that the level of service is the same and commendable.

Chili's...probably the cheapest place in Quest where you can have great food, other than the food court.
I have been to this place a number of times and I have really enjoyed it on almost every occasion.

I tried the following dishes :

1) Grilled Tenderloin - Served with a side of mashed potatoes and veggies, this dish probably just made the mark. The meat was too tough, but that was probably because I ordered the steak to be well done.

2) Blackened Salmon - Probably the best dish of the entire menu. The fish was so soft that it seemed to melt in the mouth.

3) Orleans Jambalaya - Rice, bacon, shrimp... What else do you need for a complete meal?

4) Grilled Chicken - Nothing special. Served with veggies and rice.

5) Red pepper chicken (I guess this was the name) - This was pretty nice. The chicken had a nice zing to it.

6) Blackened basa - Bland. Even with the tartare sauce. Couldnt have more than a few spoonfuls.

Also, recently they have started a 1+1 offer on select dishes. People who are looking for a cheap dinner with good food may give a try.

Will surely come here again.

I still dream about my short stay in heaven when I was having the cheeze balls @ Chillis this Sunday. After killing a substantial time in the quest mall, i became suddenly hungry. A little craving for good "Veg" food yet unique pushed me to enter chillis around 5pm. We were 4 so i had power to order multiple things(i like this kind of oppertunities). The first choice was no doubt the CHEESE BALLS. Other then that we ordered onion rings(crispy and light). We also ordered quesadilla with mushroom and cheese filling. It had spicy tangy rice and gravy by the side. We order a crispy chicken for my friend. The order was mostly cheezyy, but whoever is not fond of cheezyness has something wrong in their head.

Ordered Non-Veg Triple Dipper, Big Mouth Bites and Skillet Chocolate Chip Cookie.

Chicken Crispers taste great.

Burgers were great as well and came with Onion Rings and French Fries. However, one burger patty was a bit undercooked.

The Skillet Chocolate Chip Cookie is the best dessert I've ever had. It was fabulous.

While it might seem the pricing is a bit on the upper side, servings are good enough for two to three people.

However, service was lousy. Would've given 5 stars otherwise.

This restaurant has been in my checklist for many days. But somehow I could not manage the time as well as proper company to drop in this place. Finally I have put a tick mark in my check list... 
Straight way coming to the point. 
Ambience:- 4/5... brilliant environment to be honest.
Decor:- 4.5/5.... The decor is equally good. Probably one of the best decor I have seen in recent days.
Food:- 4.5/5... the main attraction of this place. As a foodie I have definitely like the items that we have ordered. If you are epicurean and have taste of various cuisines then chillis will not dishearten you.

Chilis i had already been to the South City outlet. And this one was equally good in terms of the food and the ambience and presentation. One thing did bother me the most was how bad the staff were at explaining a simple concept of free cocktails and the drinks on which the 2for1 applied. Get your staff together guys.

I went to Chili's to savor some meat or maybe some good food. I ordered a steak , and it was not something that any sane human being¬†would serve to another even for free( it was nothing but a semi-quarterly cooked buffalo meat.u cnt run a knife through or poke a fork into it ) let alone they have high charges to empty the pockets of some RICH income tax evaders that go and lounge there. Moving on , although the stuff were nice but they didn't even tell me the wifi password as if i can access it even when i m outta there(they took my cell away from me , put the password and then gave it back) . I mean this sort of sordid behavior is not acceptable in such restaurants. It is simply¬†disgusting .

We visited the place with  lots of expectatations in mind from the one in Acropolis mall. We entered there and ordered a salmon. I was there with a friend of mine. She knows how a Salmon tastes. Now when it came on our table, i was way too excited for this food as it was first for me. When i landed the spoon filled with salmon and rice(it come with that dish) in my mouth, i felt like to vomit out. It stunk, tasted aweful as if we are having fish directly from water. I called the manager and his behavior will make you admit that he is right. He was polite but still u cant make them understand that there is sth wrong. My friend, she knows the taste but she also admitted the fact that salmon tastes aweful. I m not gonna visit there again as they had no courtsey and they mocked the next time we ordered somethng. We ordered a chickn item and they were telling us the ingredients and the taste. It was as if we never went to chilis. The managers are least helpful and they know evrything. Worst place they have become.

My long wish to explore this eatery got fulfilled last December when I got the sudden chance to have lunch with my family here. The ambience was pretty decent I would say. They provide drinks in large mugs (for plain water also). After taking the suggestion from one of their staffs we ordered triple dipper, grilled chicken and shrimp Fajita and a strawberry margarita. Price is definitely on a higher side without any doubt. However can't complain because of ambience, quality food, well mannered staff etc. Need to visit this place soon to taste their other items.

This outlet in Quest Mall was the first one to open in Kolkata paving the way for the other two outlets, in South City Mall and Acropolis Mall. Since the Quest outlet was the first one it was the Pioneer in introducing Kolkatans to an American style diner and Tex Mex food. The foodies of Kolkata loved it and the crowds at this outlet encouraged them to open two more elsewhere in the city. Coming to the food, whatever we had was delicious and tasty. They had an offer of 1:1, buy one get one free on food and drinks. Unfortunately it was only on alcoholic beverages and not on mocktails.  So we couldn't avail on the drinks offer but we did avail on the food offer and really binged!!! Had Nachos which were superb, one of the best I've had in the city. The free option with that was the Caesar salad and it was good.
The Margherita Pizza too was excellent.anf the veg old timer with it was great. One friend had the grilled chicken platter and praised it. It was a complete meal in itself with rice and Exotic veggies as accompaniments. The only dish which wasn't up to the mark was the pasta, it was penne pasta in red sauce and was tasty enough but was lacking in veggies.( But maybe their preparation is without veggies). L felt a few veggies would have elevated the dish.We had Coke, which was served in huge beer mugs and with unlimited refills
A good experience with good service.....Happy to have visited.

Located on the 4th floor of Quest mall it has an amazingly suave ambience. The staff is helpful but at times they did appear too forthcoming. Can't rate it higher simply because haven't tested even a fraction of what it offers.

We ordered calamari, Caeser salad, grilled tenderloin and bacon cheddar steak and spicy smoked chicken pasta. My favourites among these are the pasta and the calamari. For sinful indulgence we ordered the molten chocolate cake, chocolate chip paradise pie and cheesecake. All of this was so amazing that I can't wait to go back there!

I visited this place long back just after this place was opened its doors in Kolkata. Probably this was the first Chilis outlet in town. We sat near the glass side. I visited this place just for it burgers and it was AWESOME!!! The service can be improved a bit. The food quality, the decor and specially the ambience is the reason i visited this place many times later. Specially known for tex mex but you should try their big fat chicken burger with bacon of course and with a beer. CHEERS !!

OVER PRICED, OVER HYPED and OVER RATED.

After watching a movie in Quest mall, we decided to pay a visit at the famous 'Chili's'.

The ambience was good, but not out of the world. Anyways, we grabbed a window seat for a better view.

We ordered Chicken and Shrimp Fajita which was served gorgeously on a sizzler plate along with a variety of condiments and warm tortillas. Making fajita is huge fun..but taste wise it was not as great as we expected. 
Next we ordered Orleans Jambalaya which was rice tossed with chicken, shrimps and spicy jambalaya sauce. We felt utterly disappointed tasting it and got it packed.
Since, there's an offer going on that you get a starter free for movie tickets. So we got a complementary Triple Dipper. This dish was the saviour of the day. However, we had better chicken wings and fish fry at other places.

Overall we enjoyed because we had a nice time with each other.

Please not that Chili's impose a 10% extra service tax..which makes the bill heavy on your pocket.

I'll straightaway start with the food of Chili's. In one word: paisa vasool! We ordered the classic nachos with fajita chicken, the fish and fries and the Southeast Caesar salad. The taste was good and something even better was the serving size. We ordered two mocktails, Evolution and Fusion, both fruit-based and citrusy. And lastly, we had the famous molten chocolate lava cake which was extremely chocolaty and delicious. 
Also, on a different note, the lighting is amazing for selfies! Very good experience. Do visit!

Location-Ballygunge,Kolkata.

A brand like chili's needs no introduction in the food community.All over the world they have been known for serving lip-smacking Ted-mex food.We went to this place on weekend and found the whole place equipped and when it was our turn we were extremely surprised by the service they provided to us.Inspite of such a heavy crowd they finished our dining in less than an hour and the staff was also friendly and helpful throughout.We had-

1:Nachos
2:Watermelon Margarita
3:Long Island Tea
4:Black current margarita
5:Margherita
6:Ultimate Dipper
7:Chipotle Veg Mex Bowl
8:Skillet Chocolate Chip Cookie

Among them the must try are "Nachos","Ultimate Dipper" and "Skillet Chocolate Chip Cookie".

After a long time finally went to eat here...and this place has been amazing!! Probably will go there to try everything!!! What's best is that you can produce your movie tickets and get a free appetizer after the order of a main corse dish!! The ambiance was open and liberating(I don't know why) the interiors very chic and bistro like , service was very good according to a jammed in place...sit with your buddies and catch up with the best Mexican and Tex mix!!
Orders included a triple dip plate with 3 dipping sauces and choice of 4 variants chicken wings ,fried chicken in batter a crunchy veggie and chicken crisps with sauces including a sweet mustard and mayo based, salmon in anchovy brassing and chipotle rice bowl with chicken and prawns.

With so much variety in a single place you are really spoilt for choice. You need multiple visits just to try all the stuffs you like after going through the menu.
And my first visit was worth it. The chicken bbq salad and fajitas were awesome as were the smoothies.

We had triple dipper that contained southwestern egg rolls,country fried crispers,boneless chicken wings. We also had grilled chicken enchiladas.
The food was awesome along with the beautiful ambiance. It is located at quest mall 4th floor.
The dip sauces were mainly of sweet and sour flavours.
Quantity is really good.
Service was fast.

The beef burger was too dry since it was tenderloin and i was bewildered whether they served pizza or just a biscuit with toppings..... Ovrall chilis a place where you can have a visit once..but it wont grudge u anything if u dont......cocktail lovers please dont go fr the mojito and liit....there's a hell lot places out there who make better cocktails

A beautiful bar cum restaurant in quest mall. It's worth a visit for its amazing atmosphere. Classy music in the background, low light and tables beside long glass windows are another attractions. Staffs are really well behaved. I liked the way they took order and served food.We ordered 
smoked and grilled wing..it was new in the menu, Smoky flavor has always been my favorite though I didn't like it much. We had chicken triple dipper followed by grillied chicken platter. Triple dipper is a must try. It was lip smacking good. Grilled chicken platter was good too, chicken breast served with signature rice. In dessert we had Molten lava cake. Again a must try. Perfect lava it was. Beside these we had a huge glass of non-alcoholic mojito. Price is a bit high. Will visit again.

Chili's Grill & Bar offers us an unforgettable experience in dining. The ambience is fantastic & if you manage to get a table by the large windows, the view of the city (and the traffic) is excellent. As expected from a place with so much reputation their service is also impeccable. Must try items from the bar menu are the Margarita's & Martinis; my favourite is the Pepperita. From the food menu check out the variety of salads; their portions are large enough for sharing between 2-3 people.

This is an amazing place to pamper your tastebuds with American, Mexican and Italian cuisine as they have a wide range of variety to choose from. Even it comes with good ambiance, quick service and warm staff it stands out in this area. 

We ordered Twisted Blue Lemonade and Hurricane along Non-Veg Triple Dipper (we chose Chicken Crispers, Chicken Wings and Country Fried Crispers), Smoked Chicken Quesadillas and Grilled Chicken Platter. The first sip of Hurricane made my day and it was greatly accompanied by the Country Fried Crispers. Chicken Crisper was basically fried chicken and it didn‚Äôt impress me much. 
The Chicken Platter had marinated chicken breast on a bed of spicy tasty rice, served with veggies and a sour sauce. The chicken was juicy, soft and it managed to tickle my taste buds. 
The Smoked Chicken Quesadillas was stuffed with lot of chicken and cheese which topped the list.
But, this was not the end. Our stomach was full but my heart still craved for something sweet so after a round of discussion we finally ordered Chocolate Chip Paradise Pie. The base was a combo of chocolate and nuts topped with ice cream. I only have one word to describe it- Heavenly!

We ordered Cajun rubbed wings as starter & Ancho chili fish with salmon along with jalape√±o watermelon, blackberry & mango margarita. Out of 3 I loved the blackberry one most. Wings was awesome but fish was not up to the mark. Still giving this place 4.5 because of its ambiance. Price are bit on the higher end but the portion served worth it.

I went with my family in the evening on 28th December. I liked the overall ambience and the presentation of the dishes. The behavior of the people serving was also good. I ordered BBQ Signature Wings, Smoked Chicken Quesadilla and Smoky Chipotle Chicken Fajitas. I loved the BBQ flavor on the wings and the Ranch sauce which came with it. I felt the Chicken Quesadilla was a bit dry, it needed a bit more of the sauce or a bit more cheese. The Fajitas were served with 3 tortillas. I liked the cheesy taste of the Fajitas and wrapping with the tortillas gave it a really good taste. Overall I had a great experience. Thank you for hosting us @Chili's!!

Staff are very welcoming and polite.
We ordered
1. Smoky chipotle chicken fajitas: more than sufficient for one person. It had tortillas, chicken breast grilled with cheese it was heavenly and 8 types of different salads and dips.
2. Grilled tenderloins : grilled meat with French fries, smashed potato and veggies.
Both the dishes were great.
Will surely come back again .
Price is the higher end.
2 mains and 2 mocktails costed us around 1.7k

Your expectations are always touching the top branch when you are visiting Chili's.. In Christmas, Santa brings gifts and surprises for children, but for us he brings the opportunity to have good food. This time around the year is probably the best time to go out with family and friends and tickle your taste buds.
Chili's was there in my wishlist for long. So on this Christmas day when we finally got the opportunity to fulfill our wish, we practically grabbed it. Surprisingly inspite of it being a Christmas day and Sunday also we didn't have to wait for our table. Nice courteous attendants guided us to our table and made us feel comfortable. I personally felt that the atmosphere was quite buzzing and loud specially with the loud hard hitting music. We simply ordered a chicken appetizer(forgot the name) and a Mexican rice bowl with chicken. The appetizer was out of this world. It took us in a food heaven with its crispy crust, succelent chicken pieces and the tangy sauce all over it..we were quite blown out with the light hit of lime aroma. It was lightly spiced perfectly suited to our palette. The rice bowl was mix of Mexican rice, black beans, pico de gallo, chicken breast pieces topped with crispy nachos, a ranch kinda dressing and parmesan cheese. After the tangy and spicy chicken appetizer the rice bowl cleaned our palette and provided us 'little good relief'. It was quite lightly spiced with variety of taste and flavours. We enjoyed both the dishes to the fullest. After finishing our meal they also served us a complimentary desert with hot browny, vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce.
A place that I will definitely visit again specially to try their burgers, pizzas and Mexican delicacies..

The service is great and special mention should be made of Mr Kasif who attended us with a warm smile and quick service. I ordered triple dipper and chicken quesadillas and lemon ice tea. Food was great and quantity can satisfy almost 3 people if they are small eaters.

Chili's is brilliant if you need a place where you can unwind with friends or family and stuff yourself with food. A tad bit expensive but the portions are great! The steaks are cooked to perfection though they could be slightly more generous with add-ons like bacon. The pastas are wonderfully cheesy and filling. Tried the mini burgers which were bite size but scrumptious. Coming to the desserts, the chocolate mousse is to die for! So is the cheesecake! Bottomless beverages are quite a bonus.
The ambience at the Chili's in Quest is casual and happy. The service is courteous and prompt. 
A place I'd go back to many more times because you can trust them not to mess up your food.

If you are a foodie and yet calorie counting the first two dishes would be a blessing for you! And the food was completely more than enough for 2people as we were hoping we had brought a third person to finish the meal. And all this for Rs.1278. Trust me it's worth it!!

Heard a lot about the restrautant so planned to visit it on Sunday eve...We had ordered texes cheese poppers which came out to be too oily and Chipotle rice bowl veg taste of which was also not up to mark.. It seemed as if rice and other items in the bowl were prepared too long back and when we ordered it was just mixed and brought .. freshness of immediate preparation was lacking.. felt the place was bit hyped as compared to the food offered to us.

Chili's is a chain restaurant in US and popular for its Mexican offerings. Though I live in US now but haven't tried it there. I visited this place last week with my mom n her friends. It was a casual evening snacking. It has lots of options to choose from. We ordered ultimate non-veg dipper and cheese poppers. They were good. We took Lemmint Margarita, suggested by the server, it was mild. Ambience and service is very good and upscale. Great place to hangout and try something different.

The Chipotle Chicken Fresh Mex Rice Bowl and the Non Veg Triple Dipper with a selection of Chicken Crispers, Chicken Wings Boneless and Southwestern Egg Rolls were something more than the word delicious and stomach filling can describe. Friendly staff, quick service and ofcourse a good place to hangout with friends and family. Keep it up Chilis!!! :)

Visited this restaurant with my parents on my last birthday when they had just opened this outlet in Kolkata. I was looking forward for a proper American menu and my wait was successfully rewar and my wait was successfully rewarded.  The quantity served was more than sufficient for one person which I couldn't finish but the taste of everything was excellent. The streak was very tasty - I had ordered pork. Dessert was especially lip smacking - I had ordered the hot chocolate cake with icecream. If you want to want a proper American when you can visit this.

One of my favourite outlets in Kolkata. I've been visiting Chili's at least once a week since it opened in Quest, Kolkata. As a vegetarian, I can't comment on the non-vegetarian dishes, but the Veg Triple Dipper starter is amazing. Choose any 3 starters from the 5 lip-smacking choices. The cherry cola is one of the best I had. It's available in both Cherry and Strawberry flavour. Although, the Chocolate shake is great, I'd suggest you to try the Cherry Cola since you get chocolate shake in many more places. For the main course, I love the Cottage Cheese Quesadilla and the Chipotle Rice. The Quesadilla is a must try. The Cottage Cheese filling, the cheese sauce, the dressing and cream, all make it a perfect combination.

Went for my birthday treat today. 
The staff is very friendly, the food is also very good. 
Drinks need to be chosen, they vary a lot from drink to drink. 
A little expensive but it's alright for such a service. 

Cheers. 

There was this very young waiter, maybe the youngest of the team who was extremely sweet in ordering, I'll find out his name next time and surely update it :D

Chili's has been ¬†one of the most happening places in the town for last couple of years. Their american and mexican spreadsheet is really lip-smacking. The best part is that they serve each dish in huge portions. Pocket pinch is slightly on a higher side but absolutely worth it.

Landed on this outlet for dinner.. N luckily there was an offer of one for one free meal.. 

I ordered Chicken Burger,  Chicken Platter along with Chicken Nachos.. Food was delicious as per the expectations but I feel quantity is little less..  As for deserts I tried brownie sundae which just melts in mouth but brownie was too sweet.. 

Staff services r friendly n helpful.. 

Overall it was a great experience n it's the best place to hangout with friends..

Food was so delicious and quantity was up to the mark. For me it was the best restaurant inside quest mall . Though looking at the menu card you may feel it is overpriced ,when you start eating you just feel it is indeed the best .But again after you look at your bill you will be like how is that possible, obviously taxes are added . But overall i liked it very much, dont be in a hurry ,take you own time to taste and feel each bite.

An expensive place but worth it if you like continental food in a great ambience - not a place for quiet dinners but a good one to hang out with friends. Must try are cocktails and the dips (we like the non veg ultimate dips) ..in cocktail margariata and sangria are my choices though when with friends they server super tequila shots which can pep up the party mood! Southwestern Eggrolls too are highly recommended. Maincourse opt for mix and max fajitas or maybe a grilled chicken platter. Whatever be it food for sure is great and so is ambience though albeit a bit noisy.And yes get a window seat if you are pair and look down at the road below to savour the magic of kolkata.

Finally visited this one and had a good experience. The ambience is good though a little loud. The staff is very courteous. Coming to food, they have some really good combinations. Fajitas are a must try here which they serve with tortillas and 6 other sides along with the sizzler. 
We even ordered smoked chicken leg which was very tasty.
The tacos and mex rice bowls were equally tasty. 
Coming to desserts, though there are few options but they all are great. 
Overall the food is really good and tasty and a very good experience.

Not sure how many times i visited this joint since its inauguration - first joint at Kolkata. They meet my expectation in terms of taste and quality to satisfy my western palette except the steak¬† - as i have been to their joints in US for years. Now a days somehow i feel that they have squeezed down a bit¬† in their serving portions. But i still love this place to hang out with friends and staffs are extremely friendly and courteous to the guests.

Thank you Chillies !!

This is the fifth time we have visited Chilis. Awesome food, great hospitality, warm cordial welcome. I remember an incident when the Pizza was not so tasty and the restaurant manager Sakya Sekhar Bhattacharya, came forward and behaved so humbly gifted us a diary along with a free starter.....

His behavior was so good, so modest that I felt that I should not have complained for the food. He is a real good person and ensured us that there is no grievance.

Well as per the food, wonderful Pasta, Enchilladas is awesome. If you take one plate, they serve you 2 which is good enough for 3 people. Fajita is superb and the pitta bread is of great quality. For children it is very healthy and good. There is also a very good item called rice bowl which tastes good.

Salamond fish is better than Basa fish. They serve you with Mexican rice and the Basa fish is served with broccoli. The price is a but high, but you should try it.

We tried the mock tail ones, it was not worth it pricing for Rs.150/-¬† We never tried hard drinks so cannot tell on that part.

Well Chilis have won our heart. Next time definitely we are going to visit. If you want to learn customer service, you should visit Chilis.

On 2016 Kali Puja night, my husband and I went to this place. Earlier, we visited Chilli's South City Mall outlet. My husband had a notion that Chilli's of SC is better than that of the Quest Mall as he had visited both previously. Mine was the first time here.¬† Fajita fiesta was going on. But we are not Fajita kind of persons. We are rather Steak persons :P. As preferred, we ordered Becon & Cheddar Steak (sides : Seasonal Veggies and loaded mashed potato)¬† and Ancho Chilli Fish with Salmon.

The food was served right on time. Steak was medium well ( I guess they refer medium rare as medium well). The steak was cooked nicely. It was moist, juicy and it tasted really good, but somehow the crust on the upper side was missing.¬† Bacon was very good and crispy. Cheddar became hard instead of nicely melted. Seasonal veggies had baby corn, long green beans, broccoli and mushrooms. I loved every vegetable on the plate except the beans. Beans were under-cooked and almost raw. So, I had to keep those on plate. The dip was good.¬† Mashed potato was good in taste, but I guess they forgot to remove the potato skin. Unfortunate! Last time when I had grilled tenderloin with the same sides in SC mall, the loaded mashed potato was buttery, tasty and free from potato skin which was expected this time as well. 

Ancho Chilli fish was very good here. We chose Salmon as the fish. It seemed that the fish was a bit over cooked, but still tasted good. The rice underneath was good in taste. The veggie part in this dish was having half done broccoli unfortunately, but the mushrooms were good in taste. The star part of this dish was a green dip. I guess that the dip was made with mayonnaise, cilantro and a bit of garlic. It tasted awesome and so good that I could have gulped another small cup of it. 

In dessert, we had Chocolate Truffle Cheesecake. The upper layer of this one is chocolaty, smooth and very tasty. Cheese cake was more like sweetened chocolate mousse. But, it tasted good. The Oreo layers are bit of hard. Overall, a good dessert. It's better to share this one as it is huge for a single person. 

The ambience was good.¬† The service was fine. The experience was good overall. I hope to give a 5 rating to Chilli's in future. Some under cooked veggies restricted me this time to do so. Hope for the best for the next time!

There r few chefs able to cook a chicken breast to perfection- moist, succulent and full of flavor: the chef @ chilli's cracked it. From the chilled beer to the crisp calamari , from the fresh Caesars salad to the Fajitas, this outlet gives a new meaning to quality and service. Kudos to the team.

Returned to Chili's yesterday but was left wondering if I'll return. Tuborg....not available but we r doing a promo on scotch etc. Carlsberg.....not available but we r doing a promo on scotch etc. Softly but menacing I pointed out to Carlsberg beers on other tables....hey I had no problem getting them hereafter.
With a very well stocked outlet in the basement of the same mall, does chili's management think their patrons are idiots.
Terribly disappointed. 
Returned to have the fried calamari and chilled draught beer. Indulged in a beef tenderloin steak. Guess that's life!

A nice place to chill out with your friends.

Situated insude queast mall, quite spacious, well decorated space. Stuffs are quick and prompt, provided good service. Coming to the food, we have ordered Smoked chicken Quesadillas, chicken wings, spicy smoked pasta with grilled chicken (2 plates), chicken enchiladas, molten chocolate cake, chocolate chips paradise pie. We were 5 and these food was enough for us. We enjoyed everything. We ordered for 3 glasses of cold drink and 2 glasses of chili's lemonade. Lemonade was really disappointing, nothing but water and lemon. These drinks are unlimited but the authority should seriously do something on this particular item. 
Pocket pinch is slightly on higher side but given to the taste of the food, it's a good deal.

Chili's is an eatery frequently visited, the last being on Nabami, for dinner. The food, ambience and service are the reasons to keep coming back, that too so often. This time, however, I discovered that there are different sets of meals, exclusively for kids. Our 6-year old niece was accompanying us, and she chose Pasta, Corn on Cob and Orange Juice, from the variety of combinations available. The quanity of her meal was optimum for consumption and she thoroughly relished it. 
I choose something different every time. So we went for Chipotle Chicken Fresh Mex Bowl, and Bacon and Cheddar Steak along with Watermelon Mojitea; needless to say, the dishes were appetizing. The staff are always helpful and you'll really enjoy yourself in there. For those few who've still not paid a visit, it's high time you did.

The problem with an American franchise like Chili's setting up shop in Calcutta, is that it'll be mired in all of the social issues plaguing the city. Spent 1K+ on a less than ordinary LIIT and a Margarita, but not before being plagued by the staff for TEN MINUTES on how I was making a mistake ordering these drinks (pegged as their signature cocktails) instead of ordering Ballantine's whisky or Chivas and availing the 2+1 offers. The fact that my companion said she doesn't drink whisky, and that I said I specifically wanted a cocktail which looked pretty didn't seem to matter, as the hardsell continued. I was tempted to snap and ask the waitress to do as she was told, but my inherent politeness prevented me from doing so. The new and world fresh whatever Margarita was just an ordinary drink in an ugly glass. My LIIT was neither potent, nor long, in an uglier glass. What boggles my mind is that the management at this place is probably driving staff behavior that incentivizes sales, and disregards customer preference. I mean we were literally hounded about how one always chooses cocktails and we should have whisky instead, yadda Yada. I'm dreading the thought of what would have transpired if I'd chosen something from the food menu that the chefs didn't approve of. The kitchen brigade would probably have paid a visit to my table to dissuade me. Not surprisingly, the cheque took 15 minutes and 2 reminders to get to the table. Of course I was charged 10% for this superlative service. Pseudo-american joint for folks who want to spend good money in a bad way. If you have class, dignity, civility, or taste, you'll do well to steer clear of the place. Unfortunately that also seems to be increasingly true for the city too.
I wish I could get my time and money back.

Even after taking into consideration Puja circumstances what this place had to offer just blew my mind and palates away. The wait wasn't that long. Although I was disappointed with Johnny Walker red label not being available. But the Fajita and salmon were like pure food porn. Added orgasms for the taste buds were ushered in by the rum infused chocolate cheesecake. The steaks were perfect and I must say the visit was worth the wait. A must visit for those who haven't yet.

Pretty disappointed. It started with us waiting patiently for being called in. After too many people went in, we enquired and the lady said we were already called and we didn't respond!!! We were standing right in front of her staring at her face. Anyways... Once in, the food was below par. The steaks were all messed up. Well done and medium orders were all over the place. After the five of us got and completed our meal, our sixth friend got her plate. The meat was chewy and lacked flavor. Wasn't@ even seasoned. And the mashed potatoes very intentionally had skin in it and lumpy. No butter, not creamy nothing. On a table that ordered steaks, fajitas, chicken wings and more, the mugs of coke stood out. Very very sad. In the end they messed up our bill as well. Thank god we checked. Very very pricey and bad bad quality of food.

Last time we went here we were a group of 23 people from office. Normally for such a big group, buffet is more suitable. But people who had earlier tried this restaurant gave so much positive feedback that we were ready to take the pain of a-la-carte ordering for the gang. The restaurant people helped us fabulously to make this hassle free experience. For a smaller subgroup of 5 of us we ordered Texas cheese poppers, smoked chicken quasidellas, south western egg rolls and smoked chicken wings. Everything was just perfect. In main course we ordered 2 herb fish fillet with grilled prawn, blackened salmon, grilled tenderloin steak and south western chicken pizza. We opted for normal pizza bread but flat bread was also available. The rice served with the fish dish was a very good fit for the dish. Each of the dish contains satisfactory and sufficient amount of fish/meat. In desert we ordered skillet chocolate chip cookie. It was heavenly. We were super excited and ordered molten chocolate cake. This was good but not at par with the previous one. Overall, all of us agreed that we need to visit this restaurant again and again to try their other delicacies as well.

Cocktails are very glamorous and unique- margaritas worth a special mention . Beers are limited in variety so are wines. They have good people in the team, friendly and all smiles . 

Must have : Coronarita , chicken nachos 

Not so great : chicken wings , wine collection

Was a regular here at quest. But on Maha Ashtami today on the 9th of October 2016 wen I visited with my wife is was really shocked to find out that they did not have Draught beer , then the salmon they had served contained too many bones and finally the chicken which I order was hard and rubbery.

I understand that it's a busy week but they have a reputation to maintain and a brand to upkeep. It's sad.

Best in class. Beats all competition. Consistency in quality, service, taste everything I can think of. Kolkata is blessed to have Chili 's. With the huge no.of options in the Menu one can't be bored how many times ever you visit. Cocktails are delicious

There is a reason this restaurant is a 4.4 on Zomato. And yesterday I got to know why! We ordered a plate of vegetarian nachos. Fajitas and choco lava cake. 
The nachos to die for. Filled with cheese it was almost like eating a margarita pizza. Fajitas came with rice and vegetables and 6 sauces. It was yummy yummy. The choco lava cake was just okay. That's why I gave them a 4 star.

A special mention to our service person Rashid. He treated us very well. We had an incident but they made it up for it as well. So hats off. Great job. Keep it up!

I and my wife had a really bad experience here this afternoon. We ordered for drinks & asked them to serve it with the food. The food was almost over but the drinks didn't arrive. We refused the drinks. They tried to teach us that with the food we ordered, drinks are better after eating! I mean, it's our drink, right? Should we have it when you have time to serve or when the manager desires?!

Situated in the Quest Mall this is the oldest among all the three Chili's outlet in the city. Ambiance is excellent, the tables by the glass covered end of the place offers a wonderful view of the city below. Food is delicious and most of the items which i have tried till date have  offered a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Overall a wonderful place which offers a complete package for you.

I have been a fan of chili's for several years but some how outlets in India are not even half as good as the ones abroad. Specially when it comes to shakes other drinks. The chocolate shake tastes horrible.  Though the food is good as usual. The staff is well behaved and pleasant to talk to. Hope that a great chain chain like chili's can actually be as good it is abroad.

One thing Chili's has done and done well is they've kept their best-selling margaritas as the highlight of the establishment along with the satisfying tex mex nosh we have come to identify with this international chain. Whenever an international chain opens in Kolkata, there's always that nail-bitting 6-month period to see if it is "as good as abroad". I'm glad Chili's has found the right balance between adopting local flavours and keeping true to their fundamentals. Definitely one of my go-to places when I'm searching for a familiar taste. And the familiarity doesn't just end with food. It's the familiar service and familiar decor which really brings it all home for me. Wish there were more steak options, but I guess that really can't be helped.

CHILI‚ÄôS is a big name in the food and drinks circuit globally and there is no doubt that they are very much loved by all. QUEST MALL has a lot of eateries under one dedicated fourth floor which has it‚Äôs food court and among them as you reach up to the floor with the escalator on your left the very first thing to greet your eyes and invite your belly to indulge in some good lip smacking food will be CHILI‚ÄôS itself . So Chili‚Äôs isn‚Äôt something to be ignored as a restaurant or just as a bar but it‚Äôs more than the two as its a full on place for a great food extravaganza to be remembered .Chili‚Äôs in Kolkata has taken up 3 spot‚Äôs as of now and all the 3 location which are Acropolis mall,South city mall and Quest mall of course the one which i visited are simply a game changer for the food and drinks exploring folks .

Mouthwatering Fajita Fiesta at Chili‚Äôs, Quest Mall ..!

Chilli‚Äôs is celebrating a much anticipated ‚ÄòFajita Festival‚Äô, to bring to its loyal patrons, a wide array of flavors and a taste of Tex-Mex cuisine, until the end of November. For the uninitiated, Fajitas are an inherent part and parcel of Tex-Mex cuisine, which sees grilled portions of meat, served upon a Tortilla Bread. For a restaurant, which is already popular for its smashing and lipsmacking cuisine, which includes Baby Back Ribs, Burgers, Pizzas and other mouthwatering dishes, receiving an invitation to try out their Fajita Festival was like an unspoken wish coming true.
            

Gracing the City of Joy, Chilli‚Äôs has its outlet located inside three prominent and buzzing malls. This invitation of mine was for their first outlet ever, the one inside Quest Mall. Located right beside the Food Court, the place keeps getting thronged by people all round the day, and pleasing everyone‚Äôs tummy and keeping up to everyone‚Äôs satisfaction, is no easy feat to be achieved. This is the same outlet, where once when I had some issues with my steak, I was offered a complimentary desert on the house.

Following were the drinks and dishes on offering:

1) Tequila White Sangria: White Wine and Tequila shaken with Triple Sec and Fresh Lime Juice, which was then topped with Sprite. This concoction is perfect for those who aren‚Äôt hardcore drinkers, and want to take drinks light, without tickling their senses. The drink had a fizzy touch, due to the presence of Sprite, which also helped in balancing the food.
                                          ...

I have been longing to go to this place for so long! And that finally happened last Sunday.
We looked up the menu on Zomato prior to the visit and Subhra Sankha suggested we take the tenderloin steak as it was recommended by so many out here. Well, to be honest, I never had buffalo meat before. I am big on pork, I've tried beef, but buffalo. What?
So I was a little worried as to if I will even be able to eat it. Anyway, we took that, accompanied by mashed potatoes and home style fries. The person who waited on us, suggested we take medium, as we had no idea; and it was definitely one of the most amazing things I have ever tried! I would Go back just to try that again.
We also ordered for half a flatbread pizza(California Grill) and a Southwestern chicken pizza. Both of which were delightful! And we were so full we had to take a small break between each item.
Our bill was Rs. 2065, including two beers. Which was definitely much less than I expected.
The staff were friendly and helpful.
However, I was a little annoyed by the loud music that almost gave me a headache.
I would definitely recommended this to my friends
And I am already planning on another visit real soon!

Chili's is a Tex Mex restaurant situated in the 4th floor of the Quest Mall. This place a great ambiance and elegant decorations. Through the huge glass walls the city looks amazing. The hospitality is extremely good and the servers are very friendly. The food served is extremely tasty and quantity is a lot. One dish becomes difficult for a single person to complete. As a result the price is a bit on the higher side which is justified because the quantity served is exceptionally large. The beer is also quite affordable. This place is one of the bet eateries in the Quest Mall is a sure recommendation. :)

‚ÄãChili‚Äôs isn‚Äôt a new name for us. With its inception in Kolkata, this place had always been in the hype, much due to the fact that it stands undoubtedly as the best restaurant in Kolkata serving Tex-Mex food. Their tripple dipper, burgers, fajitas, baby back ribs, blackened fish and everything else had been very famous among all of us.
                                                                ...

Our fajita journey ended at the place where it all originated. Chili‚Äôs opened its first chain in Kolkata with this outlet a couple of years back. Located in the Quest Mall ( a place which I believe makes most money from the food I believe than selling clothes & stuff), this one is probably the most popular outlet among the three they have in Kolkata . Though the place is quite spacious, even on weekdays the outlet remains surprisingly full. 
Coming to the invite, the management had invited us to try the ongoing fajita festival. The special festival menu has a selection of delicious Tex-Mex style make yourself tacos along with a starter, a festival special cocktail & dessert. The festival runs until the end of November. We tried each & every item from the special menu, a short description of which is given in the blog.

I could stay here if I am allowed to.  American breakfast or diners or grill for that matter intrigued me always.  This wasn't an exception,  one of the first places I wanted to visit once in Kolkata and I wasn't disappointed.    The interiors and ambience is pleasant but the food is awesome.  A simple menu,  not to confusing.  Beer is cheap but not hard drinks though.  Ended up having fish and chips,  grilled cheese tenderloin steak and a sea food fajita.  The portion sizes would rather blow your mind and does justify the prices quite a bit which orcourse is on the higher side.  Ordering a burger after all the above was the worst decision that night. A classic bacon and cheese tenderloin burger which was so intimidating that we had to pack it all up for later.  However the burger doesn't taste the way it looks,  you might blame it on the fact that I didn't have it fresh but then I have had burgers packed before in my life. Definitely visiting again and highly recommended if you wanna hang out with your gang.

This place never disappoints you when it comes to the quality of the food. Everything that I tried there was just amazing. Located in Quest Mall and hence convenient as well. The ambience here is good as well and so is the service. Went there late and was told that it was the last order. Ended up ordering couple of beer at one go. Was approached again after 30 mins to be asked if I wanted to order anything else. I wouldn't have ordered 2 mugs of beer if I had this option. Also, the pizza was served along with the starters. Looks like they were just trying to wind up. Anyways I do understand that it was late in the night and will not take anything away from the overall experience which was good. Must visit!

Venue:chili's,quest mall
Menu:starter:country fried calamari
Nonveg triple dipper( chicken crispers+country fried crispers,chicken wings in tangy sauce)
Main course:we were so full after the starter so we had to take something light...so we took chicken enchiladas.
Dessert:paradise pie
Drinks:beer( miller)
Very berry mojitea
Review: don't take fried calamari if you are 2 in number..they gave a huge amount and it tastes so crunchy and yummy..triple dipper s a economic one with a flavourful taste..but never take chicken wings in tangy sauce..its not nice..try wings in some other sauce rather.coming to the chicken enchiladas its just a rolled pizza..I have tried original enchiladas so I would like to suggest that please don't have it here..desert was okayish.mojitea Was a combo of tangy and sweet..

My favourites are - chicken fajita , smoked chicken quesadillas, cheese cake and their cold coffee is just so perfect ....a glass full of happiness. Pizzas are mouth watering. Chill's is simply amazing in everyway. I am looking forward to return to this mexican blockbuster soon, need to try their tacos. :)

The first Chilis outlet in Kolkata. This was probably my 10th or 11th visit to the outlet. I have been here before and the sole reason for coming here is the amazing ambience and the super friendly staff along with the mouthwatering food on offer.

The menu is vast and that is yet again another reason for coming here so many times. I have probably ordered different things on different visits.

This time here we ordered the Planters Punch, a vodka based mocktail with a good amount of baileys and orange juice.

For food we ordered the Ultimate Dipper Veg and The Chicken wings.

The ultimate dipper evoked mixed reactions. I loved 3 out of the 5 varieties that were served to us. The wings in Honey Chili Sauce was really flavourful.

All in all we had a good meal. Would love to visit again.

Chilis has come out with a number of outlets in the city. They are serving American as well some of the Brit dishes. Visited their Quest mall outlet on a rainy afternoon and got a table by the window from where the view was quite nice. Now coming to the food, their Texas cheese poppers were really nice and the cheeses they have used was of good quality. Tried their fish and chips, which was not at all impressive. The fish itself was not flakey so it ruined the entire dish. Honestly I have had much better fish and chips in India and even at Chili's VK, Delhi outlet. Their classic lamb burger with bacon was very good. The lamb patty was very well made and juicy. I would highly recommend it and will go back for the same myself. Now another disappointment was the BBQ Pork Ribs. It had that typical bad smell of the pork which needs to be eliminated while cooking which they couldn't. Very limited places in India can do so and Chili's definitely doesn't fall in that league. The pork quality was however good and their mash potatoes was impressive.

Recommendation from my side : Classic bacon burger with Lamb patty. (They will charge ‚Çπ50 extra for the lamb patty but its worth it). Cheers!

Chili's is a go to place when I am in a mood for some burger or steak. Had never been  completely disappointed but can get monotonous. Thus, when I have my intense meat cravings( beef!) and I want to play it safe Chili's is an option. Beef, chicken and fish are good. I especially like their batter fried Calamari rings! The rings are yum and the quantity is good. Generally, people like their wings but I am not a big fan. I like their quesadillas as well but taco seems like a massive task. A great place to tuck in some meat and beer!

This is one place that never lets me down. Be it the ambience,service,quality of food served and the presentation.
Though i had a misconception that when you are broke u cant set foot in this place. This got cleared recently when i had a caesar salad(veg) and chicken chipotle rice bowl just for 318 rupees!!!
Chilis had an offer of 2course meal for rupees 295 we opted for it.
The caesar salad was good it was light and tasty
The chicken chipotle rice bowl was too good..especially i liked the way they presented it..kudos to you guys u increase the palatability of food by presenting it in an awesome style.
More visits,trying new dishes is definitely on the list!!

A planned family dinner on a Sunday eve is how we ended up at Chili's .
All the tables were occupied and we were lucky enough to find a suitable place for a family of 10.We ordered Smoked Chicken Wings with some sweet corn kernels and some fills of nachos.The corn was really well made but somehow wings being the signature product of this place,I did not like it.For main course we ordered Grilled Chicken Platter with wing sauce , Red Pepper sauce Chicken and a portioned smoked chicken fajita.The sauces they served were precisely made to compliment the meat.The chicken portions were perfectly blended with the correct set of spices and the temperature was also very well maintained.

Delectable menu and pleasing ambience have made chili's a restaurant to reckon with. A perfect place to take your date out on dinner with comfortable seating arrangement. Coming to the food, filling for sure. Nachos and fajitas are appealing and appetising. Big mouth buffalo burger is tad too much for my liking. Molten chocolate cake has to be the best dessert offered by them. With handful of money one can visit this place and enjoy their time here.

Our experience turned out to be different and its was a very satisfying venture from food to ambience. We were fortunate enough to have a window seat. Next came the food.. we had tripple dipper.. chickn wings.. western eggrolls and chickn crisper.. next in line was their newly introduced chickn pepper fazita. It was excellent with the grilled onion and cheese grilled over chicken. In drinks we had blue pacifico.. it was served in a great way and tequila sunrise.. !! Had a great time and looking forward to frequent visits at this place.

Well this is my first review on Zomato and Chili's undoubtedly is my personal first choice for a new beginning.

Chili's was a perfect host last evening to 15 years old friends who decided to meet up after a long time.It was a perfect Sunday evening and Chili's as always was more than welcoming. 

Food: Words are less when it comes to write about Chili's food, they are just awesome.

Well we started with Country Fried Calamaris and Smoked Chicken Quesadillas and they were just perfect.

Though we were little disappointed with their beer stock but I guess the food covered for that.

Now going to Chili's and not having steak will be obviously nonsensical so we opted for Bacon and Cheddar Steak. There is nothing more satisfying than seeing the knife glide through meat easily and let me tell you it was perfectly cooked but a little more extra cheese wouldn't have harmed. I still give it is 5/5.

And after the lavish spread and too many beers before calling it a night as true bengalis it was time for something sweet so we ordered our self a 'Skillet Chocolate Chip Cookie' and it was just WOW!!!

Before I end my first review it is worth mentioning that Chili's staffs are one of the best friendly staff that I have seen so far in Kolkata. 

Can't wait to be there again...

Visit to this place was an absolute delight. The ambience and decor is simply brilliant. Sets the perfect mood for a romantic date. We had ordered the triple dipper. The sauce accompanying the dishes were really tasty and the chicken was deliciously juicy. We ordered the tandoori chicken leg with Mexican rice. I was very impressed with the quantity and the quality of the dish. The lovely d√©cor is pulling me back !

People across the world knows this place for its continental food. The first outlet came up in Quest mall and my brother got super excited as he had tried this brand while in USA. We went for lunch there, it's not a big place and you have to wait on weekends. We were allowed a window side table which overlooks the busy thoroughfare. Had ordered chicken nachos,grilled chicken, burger. Loved the food, it was really tasty. They have opened two more outlets in South city and Acropolis mall. I had baby back ribs with BBQ sauce and calamari there ,didn't find the ribs that tasty though. Recently went to the south city one, and I took chipotle rice with barbecued chicken.. Yummilicious. Do try this place.

A big love to this place. I think if you really wanna taste American food, then you must visit this place. Yes, you can say it is little bit costly, but it gives authentic taste of casual dining. The most attractive part of this joint is the window seats. If you can manage that, then you can view outside so amazingly. I was there in a rainy day, & it was just awesome feeling.

Ambiance is not a factor here as it is a place for good food & drinks. I must say, they serve one of the best salmon dishes in the city. The service is really good with humble attendants. According to me, a must visited place to spend some quality time.

Went to chilli's for the second time . Had already tried out the tacos and nachos earlier and didn't quite like it..Upon repeated recommendations,decided to try it for a second time.
The ambience and decor is the best part of the restaurant. The city view from the window side seats is very good. The staff behaviour and reception was courteous.But was disappointed again with the food..we ordered tenderloin steak and southern Smokehouse burger. The quality of the steak certainly not up to the mark.the burger certainly didn't live up to the hype. The bread was ordinary and the veggies were not fresh.and nor was it well grilled.
But the worst part of the experience was probably the intentional wrong information we were provided about a discount available on beers..3 pints of corona beers were available for 1335 and the offer price was 1295.but the waitress decided to camouflage the information by telling us the original price including tax and comparing that to the offer price without tax. And the fact that our query was poorly responded to did little to ameliorate our feeling of being cheated.
Would recommend people to be a little more cautious than normal while visiting this place.

I've been to Chilis umpteen number of times, and it has always impressed me. They have a perfect way to making customers feel comfortable and give you a very casual and relaxed enviornment. Its perfect to go there after a hectic day of work.¬†

Coming to food, I'm a big fan of the Chicken caesar salad. The portion size is good, and the taste is also perfect. Veg triple dippers, enchiladas, quesadillas are some of my favourites and I do recommend these dishes if it is your first time in Chilis.¬†

Keep up the good work.. Cheers!

Only issue i faced was the liit that they served was not that strong, but when i asked them to look into it then they went and made it super strong. Taxes are heavy on pocket! That hurts a bit!

Ordered - Fish and Chips, Beer and Baileys Irish Cream.
Excellent food as always.

I was quite excited when this famous American ¬†restaurant opened up in Kolkata. Want to binge on some good food, don't think twice. This place hardly disappoints.¬†

Location - Quest Mall. Location is a big plus point. Now they have opened up in the other malls as well. Come up with a new outlet in Salt Lake already :P

Ambiance - Lovely! Done in red. Comfortable and spacious seating arrangement. Always, always, always go for the window seats. The view is simply amazing!!¬†

Drinks - ¬†They have a lot to offer in the drinks department, and they put on a lil show when they serve the drinks.¬†

Food - In one word - "DELICIOUS"

Starters -¬†

Triple Dipper (Chicken wings, Country Fried Crispers, Eggrolls) - Wasn't quite impressed with this one. Although Country fried crispers were crunchy and delicious

Texas Cheese Poppers - I just love Cheese. And Fried cheese. Yummm!!
¬†
Classic Nachos - Nachos with toppings of melted cheese, jalapenos and beans. Nacho lovers munch in!!

Salads -¬†

Chicken Ranch Salad - Normally I never order or like salads , because well i love unhealthy fatty, crunchy, delicious food. Salads for me are just blah! So this one was a pleasant surprise. I loved it. And the highlight was the crispy Tortilla strips. :P

Fajitas - Grilled Chicken Fajitas - With chicken so tender and full of flavors. Loved it!

Main Course -¬†

Country Fried Chicken - Crispy fried chicken served with mashed potato. Chicken perfectly cooked with just the right amount of seasoning. Although I didn't quite like the mashed potato. Mashed potato should be creamy with a buttery texture but this one had the potatoes along with the skin. So that was a letdown.

Roasted Red Pepper Chicken - Grilled chicken with cheese, served with rice and broccoli. Just perfect! Loved it.

Star Dish for me - Fish & Chips - If you haven't tried it yet, please do. Absolutely fantastic!!!¬†

Desserts -¬†

Cheesecake - Oh this one was a total disaster. The texture wasn't right. Incredibly sweet. A total no for me.

Service - Staff polite & friendly. Quick service.¬†

Price - A bit on the higher side, but absolutely worth it.

I tried Chillis many times before and finally decided to write a review this time.¬†

Let me first talk about the decor. It is like a typical American restaurant and they have followed each and every bit of it. Big sofas, big tables, wall mounted TVs, high ceilings and brick like interior - I like it very much.¬†

If you like American food, this is your place. The quantity always overwhelms you - you can take a single plate and share between two. That also allows you to try multiple options.¬†

¬†Try the Tripple dipper - cheese balls, quesadilla and cottage cheese crispers are my favorite ones.¬†
And I will recommend trying the Quesadilla separately - ¬†this is heavenly with cheese staffing inside.¬†
I have tried Fish n Chips here as well - the fish is too soft. I liked it very much. Though I found the outer layer very oily for my taste.¬†

Staff - are ok. They are busy, they sometimes pay attention, and sometimes 1-2 of them show attitude (sorry to say this!)

Price - bit high. But ok because many other restaurants serve half of this quantity.¬†

Surely worth trying couple of times. A thumbs up from my side.

Located at Quest Mall, this is a fine place to go for a group meal. However the interior feels a bit congested. The service is average. Nothing too bad but nothing special. As for the cuisines, the cocktails and mocktails are excellent. However I felt the Mexican dished lacked punch which was expected at their pricing. The dishes had nearly the same taste. I would recommend them to take special care in the area, as I personally was not much satisfied with the Mexican cuisine.

Chili's, Quest Mall is one of my favorite eateries in town. I absolutely love their fish and chips and their chicken wings. In the main course, their burgers are absolutely lip-smacking. I am particularly fond of the Southern Smokehouse burger. The patty is soft and tender and well complemented with fried onion rings, bacon and cheddar cheese. The Orleans Jambalaya is a great option for non veg lovers with a spicy palate.¬†
I love their grilled tenderloin steak. I usually have it medium-well done. The steaks come with a choice of any two sides and there are quite a number of options. I once tried their bacon and cheddar steak. Although the steak itself was good, the cheddar and bacon did not quite mingle with the taste of the meat. Besides, the mashed potato I ordered on the side had potato skin in it and the seasonal veggies consisted mostly of sweet corn. That was not a great day. Another thing I did not like on their menu was the blackened salmon, which had a strong stench of raw fish about it. It is either an acquired taste, or that was a particularly bad day.
I am usually not one to order vegetarian food, but I had the chance to taste their cottage cheese fajitas once thanks to a vegetarian friend of mine. I have to say they tasted really good. The dips, particularly the sour cream dip was really nice.
Chili's also has a number of alcoholic and non alcoholic options in the drinks menu. Their Presidente Margarita is of course their pride and joy, and very rightly so. The only weird drink I have had there is a sip of their chili mojito, which is a mojito made with jalapeno and green chilies and quite literally makes you smoke from the ears. My personal favorite is the Cherry Cola, which exactly as the name suggests, is Cherry flavored cola. It is slightly sweet, but I love it that way.

Chilli's with the iconic red chilli as logo which is background to so many selfies. Well its essentially a Mexican food joint but to be honest the items may have authentic Mexican food names but in reality they are not. The soul of Mexican food is chilli but sadly this place forgot the chilli to add in the dishes despite being named after it. After eating here I hv literally grown to hate Mexican food. 
Ambience - well ambience is spot on n have been designed Lk the taco restaurants in us. 
Food- well I hv already mentioned the food is bad but only thing I liked was the flat bread fajita pizza.
Service - the usual,nothing special. The servers were polite enough.
Price- highly overpriced. The kinda of food the serve the prices are not justified. Trip down here will certainly blow a whole in ur pocket and a pretty big one.
Overall thumbs down to the place,at least I won't be returning to this place any time sooner.

You get that American cafe kind of a feeling especially when you enter this outlet. The ambience is very good with good music. We ordered orean jambala, chicken platter and bucket of corona. Food was certainly very delicious, especially the orean jambala. If you are more of a rice and sea food lover, certainly go for this. Rate was comparatively higher than the two other outlets, but the location explains it all. I will keep coming back because the food here is meant for the heart. :D

Decent decor, Expensive drinks and below average cocktails. The Quintessential upmarket Bar with Nachos thrown in. The food quality is not bad and they have bottomless soft drink option, which if you ask me is a marketing Gimmick. Recommended if you love Nachos. Do not have the platter, it's bad - like real bad.

On my first visit to Chilis, Was greeted well üòä
They happy a happy hour where they serve one on one for Certain cocktails and what we ordered was Long island iced tea . It was strong enough with lots of ice added 
For starters we had ordered chicken ranch salad . It was ok with too much of lettuce and less chicken compared to it. a mayoneese dip was also served with it . they mentioned about serving bacon in the salad but unfortunately we didnot find any.
On the main course we had tachos , where 2 taco wraps were served with veg rice and a rajma type dip.
The staffs were extremely polite , courteous and well behaved with us. they have an extra 10 % service charges along with the government taxes

This is ¬†a perfect American grill bar in the town. Since it's first step in Kolkata Quest Mall, this was in my wishlist. We finally stepped into the place this week. This outlet is spacious. They offer ¬†very long menu. Literally, we took almost 15 min going through each and everyone in the booklet before we could finally make our mind about what to order. We had burgers, the dippers and some grilled platters. Food is too heavy out here. We literally failed to finish up all we ordered. Each and every item was delicious. Would look forward for a second visit.

This was my first visit to Chili's at Quest Mall so I was pretty excited. I had been planning to visit this place since a long time as it was recommended by my cousins and friends many a times.
As soon as I entered with my friends we were directed to a comfortable corner overlooking the road outside. It was a cosy place to sit. Next it was time to order the food and we were split for choices. There was so much to order from dippers to burgers and rice bowls to pizzas and pastas. We finally settled for two Chiptole Chicken Fresh Mex Rice Bowl(Rs.335 each) and Signature Chicken Wings(boneless)(Rs.375). The food was served hot within a few minutes and we were ready to dive. But before that we made sure to click pictures of the dishes and ourselves.
The first bite was enough to please our taste buds and we didn't stop till we had finished. It's a wholesome dish,the fresh Mex rice bowl and it goes well with the signature wings which is very juicy. The sauce served with it was a perfect match too.
Alongside our dishes we had also ordered a Water-melon Moji-Tea(Rs.145) and a Strawberry lemonade(Rs.125). We were sipping them occasionally keeping the most part for the last. By the time we were finished we were so much full that there was no place left for the desserts and I was really feeling sorry for that. We promised to visit very soon and make up for this loss.
Finally I would like to conclude that it's a great place for an eat out with friends with a beautiful ambience. In fact I prefer restaurants which have a great outside view to offer and I got it there. The dishes were out of the box and the taste was unique - a bit different from what we usually eat in Kolkata. So I would like to suggest that you pay a visit to this place if you have not and enjoy the food. I too promise to be back very soon.

Food is just awesome here. One must try out this restaurant atleast once and then you will find yourself going to this place over and over again. This is exactly what happened with me.

I had Non-Veg Triple Dippers, a BBQ Chicken Salad, a Santa Fe chicken Salad , Classic Chicken Nachos, Fajita Trio, Smoky Chicken Fajita, Blackened Salmon, Full Rack of Baby Back Ribs, Chocolate Truffle Cake, Molten Chocolate Cake and Presidente Margarita. None of them were disheartening! Best of Tex Mex are found here.

Their ambience is really soothing and their service is great. I have only one small complaint which is customers are often not informed about the offers available on drinks or any other dish, unless they themselves ask for it.

Chili's is little costly maybe but it's totally worth it! After dinning, happiness will follow. it's better if you have table reserved else you will have to wait for sometime depending on the rush. Dish Recommended: Well, all are at it's best, but you must try Non- Veg Triple Dippers, Smoky Chicken Fajita, Molten Chocolate Cake.

I visited Chili's at Quest mall long back, when they were just new in Kolkata. We had the non veg triple dipper which was reasonably good and well presented. The ambience is really great with a view onlooking the streets. I loved the place. But over time i have been across some not so good reviews. Lets hope they resurrect well for the good.

My first experience at Chili's was not as good as the second one. Since I'm a vegetarian, I didn't expect much from them except good Mexican food.
Cuz lets face it, if you have Mexican or Lebanese on your menu, you'd better be able to do justice to it.

The first time off we ordered Fajitas which were quite non-sensational. The second time round the food was much better. 
We'd gone in around 6pm and the sun was just setting. Seated just across the glass wall, the beautiful colours of the sunset flushed across the sky was a treat for the eyes. 

We ordered a plate of crusted paneer quesadillas with cheese sauce, served with salsa and sour cream, along with a pan seared n grilled fish with herbed rice and veggies for my friend.

We got coke and a mocktail which is served in the huge beer mugs which are so comfy to drink from.

The service was good as before and the food arrived well in time. I'll only say this about their Mexican having tasted their salsa twice. It really needs to be chopped more finely, such that it can easily be scooped up with a morsel of food. The flavours of the salsa needs a lot of work.

The quesadilla was amazing. It was crisp and light on the outside filled with the right amount of cheese sauce and spiced paneer.

The grilled fish too got a thumbs up from my companion. 

One of the things I like best about Chili's beside the great view of the skyline is that the music they play is never so loud that you have to lean in for having a conversation or ask them to turn it down.
The pricing on the menu is a bit on the higher side, but given that it is located on the top floors of the Quest mall, I can live with it. The view through the glass wall is worth the price you pay, so try and get a seat across the great view if you go in the evening.

Its a good joint to frequent with friends or take a date to and spend a good couple of hours, just unwinding and talking; except if you go on a weekend night! ;D

Nice place to visit.  food quality and ambience is no doubt good.  service staffs knows their job well and they are helpful. Special mentions to the desserts after spicy nachos and tacos. And,  location wise, it is located absolutely in the heart of the city, if you manage to get the window seat,  be sure to gaze around the busiest seven point crossing.

I don't know why I never wrote a review for the mother Outlet of Chili‚Äôs in kolkata, well it was long overdue in that case.
Firstly I am a humongous fan of Chili‚Äôs. Not only did this global chain bring the Tex mex revolution to India but also made it‚Äôs place in the heart of the people here in doing so.
This casual dining restaurant has got all things right with its chilled out ambience and calming decor.
The extended menu offers all things best of Tex mex, and every item in the menu is just spot on.
Naming a few favorites is very hard but I would highly recommend their Burgers, the southwestern smoked chicken Pasta, fried calamari ( yeah, that's the best in town ) classic nachos, big mouth bites, Fajita Trio, veg quesadillas, tacos and The Desserts..
The desserts are just to die for.

While the ambience is amazing, the decor is beautiful with good music, the staff aren't well versed with the menu.
The portion sizes are not value for money. But, in the same breath, the taste is very good. Tender, juicy meat with well seasoned sides. It's a good place to eat at when you have money to splurge and are looking for a hearty meal.

Visited this outlet of Chili's this week. First things first - loved the food. Opted for the ultimate non veg dippers and beef steak with red wine. Service and ambience were satisfactory as well. The red wine was lovely but I had hoped for a wider range of selection in terms of wines & champagne. Overall, thumbs up!

This is the first outlet of chili's in Kolkata. Decor, ambience is great like that of every other chili's outlets. Well spaced. Service is nice. But somehow little lagging is there if compared to other outlets. Food is great as alwz!
1. Chili's is famous for their fajitas! I lov fajita trio!
2. Among the 3 amazing nonveg pizza California pizza is my favourite.
3. The baby back ribs are a must try!
4. Also try out tenderloin meat.
5. Roasted chicken is a great side.
6. Burgers are awesome and served with lip smaking french fries and dips! But dont try Buffalo patty in the burgers. They are less juicy and a bit hard which will ruin ur burger.
7. They have their unique collection of mocktails as well.
They have small variety in deserts but each n every desert item is lip smakingly delicious!

If this place could've been any cheaper, it would be the best place. The food is really good and quantity is adequate. The staffs are friendly and helpful. The ambiance couldn't be any better.

Pretty disappointing experience. We ordered the margherita pizza, nachos and veg burger. The nachos were not at all crisp and the cheese on top did not taste good either. While their menu states that the nachos are served with beans, we were informed by the waiter that this does not imply black or red beans (I am not sure what beans it means then!). We asked him to give us beans separately along with the nachos as an extra, which he agreed. However, the beans were not served along with the nachos and were given to us later after we followed up twice. I did not find the pizza any good either. The burger was decent though. While the service was otherwise quick, the waiter had difficulty understanding what we were asking for most of the times.

Best out of the other two restaurants.This chili's has the best ambience,bar,services and food.No wonder its one of my all time favourite food joints.Been here for more than 30 times now i find their smoothies beat any other,anytime.If you have a sweet tooth i recommend you to try them out.The chicken crispers is a famous starter here.The burgers, quesadillas and sizzlers are very tasty here.For desserts my favourite has to be the paradise pie-one word.Heaven!!
Now coming down to liquor their bar is stocked well.Happy hours is the best time to order a drink as it a lot of pocket pinch.
Tip-use the bill for getting a free brownie on the next dine in.The details will be provided on the bottom of your bill.

I've been her multiple times since it opened and had very varied experiences. The burgers are delicious as you would expect (surprisingly even the seemingly ordinary chicken soup is excellent) and so were the ribs though they're fairly expensive for the price. What I wasn't impressed with was the fact that I was served tamarind even though I'd repeatedly asked for BBQ sauce. When I sent it back they told me "that's all we have". Also you need to pay extra for the honey mustard dip and the desserts aren't really worth talking about. I do like the ambience and the service all the same.

Went here for dinner after a good movie. The happiness i got from watching the Warcraft movie was extended by eating here.
We started with a triple dipper which had boneless chicken wings, southwestern egg rolls and country fried chicken. Was sad to see that 2 out of 3 dips were ranch (i like ranch but was expecting 3 different dips with 3 different starters) and the other was honey mustard (at least thats what one of the server said but tasted different).

Out main course had a smoked chicken leg, chicken and shrimp fajitas and country fried chicken.
All 3 of which were overshadowed by the awesomeness of the starters.

The smoked chicken leg was really good but the mushroom served with it was only boiled. The mexican rice was also good.
The fajitas were also very good as was the country fried chicken. The mash with the fried chicken was exceptional. A dip was needed here with the chicken though.

Overall a nice end to a nice dinner to a nice movie in a hot day.

Another place to hang out, every now and then. Nice ambience, lovely bar, very courteous staffs and a top view of the city from the tables adjacent to the window.

The food is nice, tasty, and comes in very good portions. I would recommend the items that include quesadilla, pork taco, cheese poppers (ask for additional BBQ sauce), smoked chicken leg, steak fajitas, cheddar & bacon steak, bacon burger. Tried a pasta based dish once. Did not like it much. The pasta wasn't al-dente and the sauce wasn't creamy enough.

There is a good range of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages to choose from. I however would recommend to skip the long island iced tea, pinacolada, and the mango smoothie. These three are not up to the mark.

I seldom order for the desserts, however, the one time we ordered the molten chocolate cake and the chocolate paradise cake, both the dishes tasted almost similar.

I first went to Chili's about six years ago when it opened in Mumbai in Hiranandani, Powai. I ordered a pasta which I didn't like at all. I went there again a couple of years later and I liked the place. But the Kolkata Chili's in Quest mall, I absolutely love. Hearty food served right, big glasses of drinks and generous happy hours. I have had the soy patty burgers, regular burgers, cottage cheese enchilada, chicken enchilada, burrito bowls, nachos, number of drinks and probably more and enjoyed it every time. I did order pizza once ¬†and like my first time in Mumbai, the italian dish was not very good. But it is undoubtedly one of the best tex-mex in the city. I enjoy the ambience and the general atmosphere in this restaurant. This is my go to place for filling free evenings, taking a break from shopping in Quest, enjoying a drink with my husband or friends, even enjoying a good sport on their tv. There has never been a dull meal in Chili's for me.

Chili‚Äôs is a respectable restaurant chain and it‚Äôs opening in Kolkata at Quest Mall was one of the best news we got right before my birthday. On we marched to the restaurant on the day of my birthday and enjoyed quite a lovely meal in the way only Chili‚Äôs can provide. Since then, we have been to Chili‚Äôs quite regularly and have enjoyed the food and drinks. Here‚Äôs an abridged version of the food items that have made their way to our table so far: 

-	Non-veg Triple Dipper: Consisting of a platter of chicken crispers, chicken wings and Southwest egg rolls, the non-veg triple dipper was reasonably good, but not extraordinary for my taste. The chicken crispers and chicken wings were nice, but for some reason, the Southwest egg rolls did not taste as well as I had anticipated. 

-	Blackened Salmon: The salmon was sweet and tangy in taste, with an addition of rice, cilantro aioli and spinach-tomato mix, but it was felt that the salmon was just a bit imperfect. 

-	Burgers and Shakes: I cannot pinpoint my exact orders, but the shakes and burgers were genuinely well-received at our table and we loved the same. 

Positives:

-	Sufficient quantity

-	Fine ambiance

-	Good service

-	Unlimited coke at a minimum price

Negatives:

-	A more interesting drinks menu would be wonderful. 

Peace.

I just realised that this outlet being the most visited one apart from all the other Chili's outlets in the city,and I missed to give the review of this outlet only,well better late than never.

The first outlet of the Chili's in the city which just spreaded its magic like so easily, the much awaited American resto...deliciously spreading it's wings.

Talking about the food starting from the famous triple dipper,the yummy southwestern egg rolls,chicken crispers,country fried chicken,chicken wings,Quesadilla explosion salad with chicken,bbq chicken salad,big mouth burgers,the spicy smoked chicken pasta with added shrimps and grilled chicken,chipotle pasta,the tacos,enchiladas,fajitas,blackened salmon,blackened fish,country fried chicken l,roasted pepper chicken,Californian grilled chicken pizza,the newly added chef cuts etc....and my most favourite molten chocolate cake,loaded with nuts hot served with the combo of cold vanilla ice cream.

The dishes I tasted and mentioned above undoubtedly they're all equally good,softer perfectly made and served,You just go on eating,it has been more 20-25 times I've been visiting this outlet,and the ambience I appreciate the most compared to the other outlets in the city... The service is good to and the cocktails,special mention to the Rita trio and the classic martinis aand margharitas...no words!!!!!

Couple of days ago my wife took me for a lovely dinner at one of our favourite restaurants, the Ballygunge Chili's.

It is located on the fourth floor of Quest Mall just adjacent to Inox.

Once you enter the place it is well lit with wooden tables and comfortable sofas. The d√©cor is vibrant and the place has a feel of lot of energy.

Service is extremely good and the staff is very polite and helpful. They fully explain the ordered dishes and then give their suggestions after finding out what our preferences are. Kudos to the service team.

Their food quality and taste is just wonderful and would always want to come back for more. Their sauces are so different and so yummy.

This time we went for the non veg triple dipper , pepperoni pizza, and the New Texas Trio from the Chef Cut Menu. The last had baby pork ribs with chilly barbeque sauce, salmon in Honey chipotle sauce and smoked chicken. Loved the Texas Trio - it's a must try for all foodies.

Also a must have is their grilled tenderloin steak. I like it well done with mashed potatoes and broccolis.

For all chocolate lovers you should not miss the molten chocolate cake. Yum yum.

Pocket pinch is about Rs. 2000+ for two persons.

Keep up the good work team Chili's. We will be definitely be back for more.

First ever dining at Chili's and yes finally!
It's a must visit and the food is really good.

Servers and the staff looked quite lost and weren't very fluent in english which was a let down. I had to ask at least 5 times for a glasss for water for self and the kids.

All the deserts are yummy. We spent more on deserts than the actual food
Fish and Chips is really really good. ..
            

10% service charge is included in the bill.
There is not much of service beyond ferrying the food to the table... to the extent that the staff attending our tables refused to even serve the tacos to the two of us who shared the dish but weren't seated next to each other!!!!!

Chili's is the latest addiction for the upmarket Kolkata youth. Truth to be , it stands apart from the other restaurants in the swish Quest Mall for the simple reason that it is not fine dining. It does offer a sumptuous collection of burgers ( both chicken and bacon). We settled for a couple of the Ranch burgers, which were tasty as hell. Portions are massive and prices are reasonable- no cause for complaint out there. Big bonus was the decor , with a Texas feel. Enthusiastic staff members and quick service adds to the appeal. All in all , a superb experience. :)

Located at Quest Mall on Syed Amir Ali Avenue. 
This new American style themed place was a rage in town for more than a year. And luckily its next to my place, so this became my no.1

The decor is pretty simple red walls, dim lights, American fast food type atmosphere. 

The food is pretty much A class over here. But that is also because there is no parallel match in town.
You could start up with Texas cheese poppers or Quesadilla Explosion salad.
Cajun Chicken Burger and Bacon Ranch Quesadilla is something your palate would relish. 
Never tried the pizza though.
But for the mains, Country fried chicken is my evergreen choice.
The Grilled Chicken Fajita and Smoky Chipotle Chicken fajita are delicious as well.

Desserts and drinks are worth the try. The pitcher is always economical, with Molten Chocolate Cake an overall favourite.

Pros - Location, ambience, Food Quality and Quantity, Courteous staff, Quick service.

Cons - On a weekend or holiday or even a weekday dinner, you probably got to take a good waiting time, a little more variety in the mains would be better, Taxes.

So after yearning for almost a year, I finally got to visit Chili's. I had heard a lot of praise about the place from my friends, and was pretty stoked to finally taste some respectable Mexican food here in Kolkata. And I am glad to say it lived up to the expectations.

The setting is pretty much like an American gastropub, and the music was refreshing too. I went there to particularly taste Tex-Mex food so we steered away from the pastas, burgers and ribs. We ordered the triple dipper platter with country fried crispers, boneless wings and southwestern egg rolls. The crispers were the hands down winner, and the wings were 'salty and tangy' but to be honest that's how they were described beforehand by our server. The rolls were crispy and filled with all sorts of goodness. The ranch and honey mustard dips were also addictive, and it is a good thing they give you free refills.

For mains I would definitely recommend the fajitas, since that's authentic Mexican and such an interactive dish. Like who doesn't want to stuff their corn tortillas with succulent strips of grilled chicken, peppers and onions and generously dollop over the delicious toppings, before applying it duly to face? One negative point though; the veggies were a tad bit too greasy for me, but eh, it didn't make much of a difference to the taste, which btw, was awesome. This is not an exaggeration. I was a bit bummed there was no guacamole, and wish we had ordered it on the side.

We also ordered a chipotle chicken rice bowl because my mother is not a big fan of breads, and it was a pleasant surpise. Seasoned rice, black beans (yum) and corn, huge chunks of chicken, lettuce and crispy tortilla strips. It was all doused in their 'chipotle' sauce but I didn't taste any chipotle in it, it wasn't even borderline hot or smoky. But tasted pretty delicious nevertheless. The crispy tortilla strips and the tiny squeeze of lime brought it home for us.

We also had their moji-teas (extra points for the name) in very berry and watermelon flavors and they were as expected- fruity and refreshing. Just one thing though, the portions are pretty big and all this was too much for the four of us, who btw, are voracious eaters. That's a plus I guess.

Next time I am definitely trying the ribs...here's keeping my fingers crossed.

We had Chili‚Äôs bookmarked since it opened its first outlet in Kolkata. But due to several reasons the plan kept postponing. Finally one fine March afternoon we entered the Quest Mall outlet for a wonderful Tex-Mex lunch. Quest Mall is on Syed Amar Ali Avenue, just before the Beckbagan crossing on your left, if you are coming from Park Circus crossing. Chili‚Äôs is on the fourth floor of the mall.
                                                                ...

I don't know I had missed reviewing this awesome place. Have been visiting since it started operation in Kolkata. One word. awesome. Located inside the quest mall this is the best of the chili's outlet. Although I haven't gone to the other two but I love this place. Huge portions and awesome taste. From the mocktails to dessert I love and want them all. :-P 
Paradise for food lovers. :-)

This is my current favourite restaurant in Calcutta. Service, food and drinks are just too good. I always end up ordering the select few favourite dishes and drinks whenever I go. My fav dishes are the Chipotle chicken flat bread pizza, red pepper chicken and the mushroom quesadillas and for drinks it's the President margarita and the margarita trio. The red pepper chicken is too die for. Already craving for it while typing this review. üòù

Guys, what all should I write in here....It will not be enough to explain for a place like Chili's, you have to experience the beauty of this place by urself. Unbelievable Mexican, American and Italian cuisine will drive you crazy and the innovative drinks are cherry on top. Amazing decor and ambience, wish to be here everyday!!

Was really lucky to have managed the window seat on a rainy day with the raindrops running down the glass and the view of the wet city from top was beautiful. Inside, there was nice decor, great ambiance. The lady staff that was attending us was not attentive.

I LIKE THEIR: Non Veg Triple Dipper (the first two times, there were 3 different dips and the last time, one dip was repeated). Tried them all. Love the Southwestern Eggrolls. The chicken is moist and perfectly cooked in both Chicken Crispers and the Country Fried one which are very similar. The Chicken wings was, kind of, sour because of the tangy sauce and was ok-ok!

I DIDN'T LIKE THEIR: Big Mouth Bites, the 4 mini burgers were very bad. We ordered without beacon the first time and it was very dry. There was no onion or ranch dressing, I'd say. Smoked Chicken Leg (again, I just liked the rice and the broccoli). Chocolate Truffle Cheesecake, the top layer was only the part that I enjoyed. After it was gone, it was all dry and hard. Couldn't finish it. Also, the Berry Shake was very regular.

My favourite of all places right now.. Everything is beautiful here as you can taste the chief cooking with his heart and soul.. However, the quality of the fish is not up to the mark at time.. But cummon for a place for which you have a soft corner for the joint, ofcourse you would give into temptations to walk in again once you've walked out of it! And their big mouth burger is to die for!

A place where one can go a million times, and still not have enough of it!

We went there on a perfectly  rainy afternoon  for lunch, and took the window seat. 
The staff was extremely  cordial and they took enough care to make sure that we were comfortable.

Now coming to the integral part, we ordered  for grilled chicken fajita, and classic mojito. The fajita was a beauty! Served with 6 different interesting  dips, and 3 pieces of tender bread, this dish struck the right  chord. The mojito was pretty refreshing!   
   
Though we were completely  full after having the fajita, we still decided to go for a dessert. We ordered  for chocolate  chip paradise  pie.
And my, it was amazing! The caramel blended in perfectly  with the flavour of the vanilla and chocolate. And as they say, dessert goes straight  to the heart, and definitely, it did. 

It was overall an amazing experience,  and I shall definitely pay a visit again soon!

This is now one of my favorite joints in Kolkata . It's quite spacious... But despite that there is usually a waiting over weekends ... Which just goes on to show how good the place is.

While the food is great the cocktails are quite average . The sangria was actually quite average... I have seen such a tiny glass of sangria:-( the mojito is nice though. Try the orange mojito it's quite nice .
Coming to food... I love most of the dishes I have tried. My favorite being their nachos , grilled herbed fish. My sister had the burger and loved it. The cheese cake was also quite yum. 
The service is good .. Friendly people. But be prepared to wait if you happen to go there over the weekend.

This was the first outlet of the famous American restaurant brand here in Kolkata, before it went onto opening its doors in other two prominent shopping malls in the city. Situated in Quest Mall, this outlet has been attracting a considerable amount of foot fall ever since the very beginning. This branch also served as my first experience of Chili‚Äôs food.

We were a group of six and our table looked as if a tornado had just passed the top of it, after we were done with our platters. We ordered for an absolute mountainous amount of appetizers and main courses, which sadly left no more place for desserts (Which we coped up with in subsequent visits). Everything on the table was loved by their respected owners. I ordered the Tortilla crusted chicken for me and hogged my through it, way before most others could complete their food. I also loved the southern fried chicken and the jambalaya. The golden fried squid and the triple dippers were absolute crowd pleasers.

Apart from the food, the service was well received too. Attendants are mightily aware of not only the different dishes on offer but also about their ingredients. This makes ordering so much easier. The first experience always builds the way for plenty more future visits, and that is exactly what this experience has done for us.

I need not mention the location I believe. I straightaway come to the food and ambience.

Try to grab a window seat to get the beautiful view of the city below. The staffs are well trained and courteous. Prices are high but every penny is worth it. 

We started with a molten Choco chunk for myself and some beer for my friend. Then we got a southern smokehouse burger stuffed with bacon, cheese, onion rings, tomatoes and lettuce which came with some crispy french fries and classic BBQ sauce. It took me a while  to finish this entire thing. The burger tasted amazing and it overloaded my stomach. 
The new glazed shrimo fillet which was basically buffalo steak served with corn, spinach and a cheese dipper was simply brilliant.

IQBALl!!!!!! Thank you for the lovely experience. It was the first time I visited chili's With my mum n sis. We were greeted with a smile by the lady and iqbal. We asked him so many questions about the food that we wanted to order and it seems he is perfect at what he does. We ordered for the food and 99% of the food was on the spot and amazing delicious. From the bbq salad where the chicken was absolutely soft and the dip was amazing. The boneless chicken wings was soft and both the dips complemented each other . The nachos were pretty big in size with cheese and the jelepeno on the top yummy. However chili's is missing that .5 cause the tenderloin that I ordered was rather abit chewy. I asked for a medium rare but din expect it to be chewy. The other main courses Texas trio was mind blowing and for the baby back ribs I'm pretty much speechless. Ty for the wonderful experience had an amazing time and keep up the good work.

This is a great restaurant! Awesome ambience and finger licking good food. The cooking style is authentic and the portion sizes are really nice. The drinks options will satisfy everyone's needs too for sure. Then why the rating? It is the pathetic service that I received.   The server was the most disinterested person they could have hired. He was visibly upset when we wanted to keep a menu card to go through and decide the main course. In general it was difficult to draw anyone's attention to the table for any service! What should have been an amazing experience for my parents, as it was their first time to Chili's, it turned out to be good food at the place where the service was horrible! Thankfully I won't have to return to this place and as there are other options now.

The feel n look, the staffs, the buzz , the music makes me feel am outside in a foriegn country, enjoying.. We ordered beef steak and quesadillas.. The quesadillas wre new to me as a dish and i loved the taste. It was cheesy, juicy, loaded vd chicken and sauce... Beef steak was good.. This place is a perfect place for partying like crazy vd ur friends.. The food and quantity is great as per the price.. Authentic mexican and italian cuisine takes u out of india and makes u feel like ur actually in those countries and enjoying the food.. Would love to go there again.. :-)

Chilis is one of my most favourite places in Kolkata. I had the triple non-veg appetisers costing 365Rs which had Chicken crispers, Southwestern eggrolls and Chicken wings!
Chicken wings were tangy and a bit spicy, it was really good. Southwestern eggrolls, the name doesn't seem to match with what I was served at all but it was cheesy and yummy.
Crispers were very well fried and after a bite or two , I saw the chicken inside which was soft and tender and very well prepared. I was full and it was a happy tummy. Along with the food, I chose Cherry Cola which was cherilicious and perfect and refreshing for this heat!
Overall really happy with the service and the behaviour of the staff and food was tewwww good, but the taxes are actually pretty high which adds up to the bill.
Would definitely love to visit Chilis again and try some other of their mouthwatering delicacies.

Went to this supposedly awesome place for treating my friends on my birthday after reading reviews and recommendations. The service was inadequate and had to wait for a long time to get hold of an attendant. The BBQ wasn't working and as a result majority of the dishes were not available. There was no prior information about this before taking seats. So we had to settle for whatever little was available. The main intent of visiting here (Baby back ribs and tenderloin steak) were obviously unavailable. The fish was smelly and seemed pretty old with very ordinary taste. Had been here in 2014 and never after that. The first time experience was summed up as - overpriced (as per quality), no customer satisfaction. I personally can never recommend anybody or would want to visit myself. A spoiled birthday treat and lots of money wasted.

A friend and I had ordered a non-veg triple dipper and a tortilla crusted chicken. I love the Chili's in Delhi and Bangalore so I had high expectations from the Calcutta one too. We were greatly disappointed as the chicken seemed to be really bland, and lacked the usual taste and flavours. The main course dish was served with some veggies: dry beans, and extremely hard carrots which we struggled to cut with a knife. The staff were apologetic when we complainedcomplained, so they replaced the veggies, but it took quite some time to reach our table by which time we had already finished the main course. Highly disappointing!

On the 5th floor of Quest Mall a true continental restaurant with nice pub. Wide varieties of dishes and alcohol to choose from. Cocktails and Mocktails are simply superb. We went for Stella Beer, Country fried Calamari, BBQ Chicken Salad, Blackened Salmon, Chipotle rice fresh mexican bowl. Each and every dish was amazing-Light but tasty. The ingredients were very fresh and crispy. Moreover you get a good crowd to dine with. Fine dining experience at it's best.
P.S- The food there may not be of everyone's taste, but it's a heaven for Continental lover.

People now days very much talking about this restaurant,specially there Mexican and American cuisine.So with a heartful expectation I finally managed to visit it.
So start with the interior: The interior is decent.Simple and the vibrant red color have added some of American bar type feelings.There are two sections of this restaurant ,one is the Bar counter and another portion is dedicated only for dining. So me and my partner chose to have a on the dining portion and luckily got it with 5mins.
Now coming to the Menu.one thing I must say as we are not much familiar with the American and Mexican cuisine now so it will be better if someone who wants to visit here just check out there dishes and speciality once through Zomato and research about the dishes from Google.Or another easiest way is just have chat with the waiters(as they are very helpful).
So coming to my order we have ordered 1 Herb Salmon(a newly added dish to the Menu),1 Grilled Steak Tenderloin,2 mojitos,2 truffle cake.
Now coming to the food quality
1.Mojitos- The mojitos are so refreshing and quantity wise also they are worthy to pay.So out of 5 it can rated as 4.
2. Herb Salmon- Best dish of the evening.The Salmon was well cooked served with veggies,rice and a dip of Mayo.This is recommended by the waiter.And I really felt  the flavours of the Herbs(like-thyme).so out of 5 it scored 4.5
3.Steak Tenderloin- This dish need to take some sort of care. Because the piece of the steak is very appreciable in size.But the issue with the cooking.The steak was juicy initially and within 10-15mins the juciness was just evaporated. And the mashed potatoes it need some more buttery flavour and some more veggies inside it.so over it is rated as 3.
4.Chico cheese truffle cake:This is one of the best dish.The layering of the cake was so prominent,well maintained,and Chico flavours are well balanced inside it.So u shud have try it.Out of 5 it scored 4.5.
Now coming to the service: The service men are well behaved and knowledgeful about their Menu.So it would have been help for the customer to discuss with them about the order.Else the service was a bit of on the slower side.Avrg timing around 15mins.(I think it depend upon the dish u have ordered,cause people who have ordered burger and fries are getting the dishes faster than others).
Now the main concern The Price.Honestly speaking the restaurant is definitely on the High priced restaurant.Yes some of the dishes are some what over priced but most of the them are worthy to have the price.But on contrary there was an extra Tax in this restaurant and that is Service Charge under the TAX(don't get confused with the service tax) and the amount is 10% of the total.That is only wetied thing I have facedin this restaurant.
So overall it's been a pleasant experience for me.

Chili's, a little different from your South City outlet look wise, has a big glass window from which you have a good view of the city. Okay, maybe just Ballygunge.

*food quality: 3.5/5
*food quantity:4.5/5
*ambience: 4/5
*service: 4/5

Location: Syed Amir Ali Road's Quest Mall introduced Chili's about two years ago. Located on the fourth floor on the left before you enter food court.

Food: Chili's, known for its Tex Mex style food with big quantity would impress you on the first go.

Chicken Wings: this features in their appetizer menu. A bit too saucy for my taste palette, comes in a little basket with six pieces of wings complemented with one mayonnaise based dip. (2.5/5)

Southwestern Chicken Pizza: most brilliantly made pizza with thin a crust, perfectly balanced base sauce and as far as I remember, comes in four slices. Strong recommendation. (4/5)

Crispy Tacos: not very impressive. Crispy Tacos with a good amount of filling. Skipping this and ordering their famous Tex Mex Chipotle Bowl would be a better option. (3/5)

Premium Margaritas:
Corona Rita: *fresh *chilled *refreshing *colourful *totally would beat the heat (4/5)

Management: Service is quick. Place, well maintained. Well lit. Staff more or ess courteous.

One of the finest places to have continental and American cuisine. Chilli's offer a great range of dishes to make you water your taste buds. 
The ambience was good with light music. 
Service was very quick and the food was fresh and tender. 
We ordered Chef Special Fillet Fish, Chipotle Pasta in red sauce, Chocolate Lava Cake and Caramel Pie Cake with Ice Cream. 
We also ordered cocktails. 
1) Mojito. 
2) Long Island Ice Tea. 
3) Mint Jureto 
Drinks were good with good amount of quantity to offer doing justice to their price. 

Pasta was good, I won't say great but the preparation of the chicken in Chilli's is awesome. The chicken is soft and juicy and you will not feel it hard to swallow. Thumbs Up for that. 

Coming to Chef Special Fillet Fish : This was one of the best fish dish I have had in Kolkata. The grilled preparation of the fish was spot on. The rice bed under the Fish was a little oily for my taste but over all an amazing dish. 

The Deserts : The only word I will say is Awesome. No complaints on this one. They have only 5 dishes on the desert side and we ordered 2. The chocolate Lava cake has a very good theater doing justice to its name. 
Caramel Pie Cake with Ice Cream is a must to finish your meal in Chilli's. It's different, it's special and its tasty. 

Cheers to Chilli's.

I am writing this note with lot of disappointment. Went for lunch today afternoon. Ordered for mini Burgers with buffalo and bacon. Guess what I get? The burger buns are not buns but Pao. Slightly sweet and bigger buns cut into two. I have had same dish in south city, completely different and good. Very dry hardly any cheese. Bacon were chopped and not sliced. We were a group of 8. Veg pizza was ordered which came first cold, then again replaced. Another dish don't remember the name, was told without bacon and with veggies, however came with bacon and French fries. Not to forget strawberry lemonade was too sweet. Asked for soda atleast 4 times and then got it. Overall extremely disappointing and not worth spending here.

This is one place where more than satiating your physical hunger, it fulfils your inner desire for food, you know, like when you dream about having good food, you come to this place. I often end up here with my girlfriends to satisfy our hunger for good American style dining. The cocktails are amazing. Strongly suggest the deserts here, truly orgasmic! Try all if you can!

I am absolutely in love with Chili's! Its located on the 4th floor of Quest Mall. Nice ambiance and try to sit in the tables having the city view. ¬†I love the American cuisine here. My personal favorites are BBQ BabyBack Ribs and Calamari Fries. Also do try the triple dipper and the Sangria cocktail. Will come back yet again soon!

Summary review of Chili's food:

Their signature mojiteas were refreshing and great. The triple veg platter, was as warned, a crumb fried fiesta. The ever classic cheese and jalapeno balls (can there please be more¬†than one piece per head?), the over-oily, under-seasoned potato wedges and the too-heavy,¬†curious (might be a good choice to not have the fried variant in this basket?) quesadilla¬†bites. Overall, middling satisfaction. ¬†

The veg fajitas platter was a sight to behold. It looked truly fresh, colorful and exciting with its assortment of accompaniments. The tortillas were warm out of the oven. I couldn't do justice to the dish but I'll give it credit for getting most of it right.¬†The flat bread pizza was a simple margherita and was quite good. The base was just right, critical to the flat bread pizza. Also the right portion size, so this was a hit.

Been here with my hardcore non-vegetarian friend and this restaurant impressed both of us very much. Very impressive ambitious and hospitality. Service was quick and staff was soft spoken & very friendly. Impressed with presentation as well. Come to food this restaurant serves us Mexican, American and Italian cuisines in both veg and non-veg. American cuisine was good nothing special but Mexican and Italian must try. For me it was one of the most tastiest Mexican and Italian cuisines restaurant of kolkata. My friend had all the non-veg dishes they looks very beautiful and according to him tastes very very delicious. I've tasted some dipper which were crispy, spicy and with dip very tasty. In main course i have Mexican in this visit which impressed me alot. They made it just perfect. In desert we had a hot molted brownie which was delicious and must say fantastic. Wonderful experience here still being an vegetarian. Personal favorite. Highly recommended to all Mexican and Italian food lover.

Quality of the food, staff behaviour and ambience are good but the only  problem is the service charge (or tips@10%) which they add to the bill. I think it should be the  guest's prerogative.

I have come here only once and that too, to have their lunch combo. 
But well, this place is good. The food is pretty good. 

They serve a two course lunch of a soup/ salad and a main course dish for ‚Çπ 249/-
We tried the soup of the day which was cream of mushroom, a creamy delicious cup of awesomeness. 
There were few options with the main course dish, equally balanced between vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. We had tried the Red pepper grilled chicken and the Chipotle-something-dish of Paneer. 
Both tasted good. The chicken was well cooked. Had a sinful cover of cheese on top and one even better gravy, served on a bed of rice. There was a lot of steamed broccoli too, to play around with them on the plate and make grumpy faces at. :P 
The quantity was appreciable. No, they did not cut it down savagely just because it was served as a part of a combo meal. I loved that. 

The staff is courteous ( a little robotic at times).
Lastly, some pretty good music. Thumbs up to that. 

In short, I'm coming back for more. ;)

Simply awesome...its a place to treat yourself, and if u are kind enough, to your friends too. Really gives a feel of luxury dining and the food is worth coming here again and again. Chicken Club Tacos and Chicken crispers were enough for me to decide. My friends ordered steaks and burgers which also looked really delicious. Must visit if you want to enjoy good food with beer

Had been to this place 4 / 5 months back with some of my office mates. Whatever was ordered was super duper testy. I am not familiar with the item names but everything was really good.

Planning to visit Chilli's at Quest Mall again with my family this time. Can you suggest me a good non-veg menu to order which we and our 5 years old kid can enjoy.

On the 4th floor of Quest Mall, Chilis have a nice casual decor. Servers are friendly and food comes fast.¬†

We tried Chicken Nachos which was great. Portion was good too. Loved the sour cream dip served along with it.¬†

Grilled tenderloin was average. Firstly the steak was rubbery. Secondly did not like the mashed potato served with it. Was full of lumps. I love mashed potatoes to be soft, smooth and creamy. The veggies served along with it was tasty.The shrimps served over the steak were perfectly done and tasty. 

Had truffle cake as dessert. It was served in a nice mug. Good presentation. Tasted great too. 

In all a pretty decent experience. Will go back for more.

Amazing ambience.Very classy.
Burgers are very filling and hence the price.
The mocktails are out of the world with respect to both the presentation and taste. I had classic chicken burger, Caesar salad, grilled chicken platter, fusion for drink and molten chocolate cake for dessert. This dessert is by far the best dessert that I have ever come across. Attaching the picture of the mocktail(fusion)
Been here multiple times and will keep going.

It has a good, lively atmosphere during the evenings, and you may find it difficult to get a seat.

We were 3 of us - we ordered a couple of soup, burgers, pizzas and many more. The soup was really good, so were the the salads and the burgers. We liked the ambiance too. The serve was a bit shoddy though, but cant complain a lot since the place was packed.

So, I have had food twice in Chili's and both my experiences have been fulfiling and baked to perfection. Today, there was a 2-course meal offer and I tried out a chicken mushroom soup and a chipotle chicken rice bowl. The soup was thickened to lusciousness, it had the perfect blend of flavour with softly cooked chicken and mushroom. The entree was stupendous, filled with vegetables, dipped in chipotle and the pieces of chicken grilled to tenderness. Halfway I was full,the quantity was monstrous and the quality was just somewhere near wonder. My friend tried out this Oldtimer's burger with the buffalo patty, honestly, I didn't like it much but he said he never had a burger as good as that!

Chilli's is all about food - filling food, comfort food, food that makes you forget all about your diet. Quesadillas, chicken crispers, tacos, salad... It's all going to make you happy. But the absolute must-haves are the baby back ribs and the tenderloin steak. A word of warning - the chicken wings are extemely sour; not lime and lemony sour,but rice wine vinegar sour, and equally pungent. The problem for me is the setup. Lack of privacy and irritating music playing at unnecessarily high volume kill the mood. Will I go back? Yes. But i would much rather go to a quieter place if I have the option.

Was planning to visit this place for a long time,and finally went to spend our anniversary some days back. Ambience of the place was quite good but nothing outstanding though! Service was quick and satisfactory,and the food was good too.. What u must must must try there is the buffalo meat,I'm sure it'll win your heart,but the lamb used in the handmade burgers was bit coarse.The non-veg tripple dipper was simply awesome and anyone surely will love it(we chose chicken crispers,boneless chicken wings and southwestern eggrolls). The big mouth bite burgers are served with french fries and sauteed onions, and are quite heavy and will stuff your stomach for sure. And then there's Sante Fe quesadillas where you must try the buffalo meat,they're served with rice and black beans(tastes more like rajma dal though!),which is enough for two people and is again going to fill your stomach like anything!But in the end,I'll like to say it's bit overpriced,just because it's 'CHILI'S' they will charge you with an extra 10% tax!

Went on my anniversary with Rusha..The ambiance is cool with good music..¬†We had :

1. Non Veg Triple dippers: (Chicken crispers : too blunt.. seriously didn't like it at all; Boneless chicken wings: its really soft, too good and a must have; Southwestern eggrolls: soft and tastes really good)

2. Big mouth Bites: ( took lamb and which turns out to be not that good and she found a slight smell in it.. else it was fine.. I liked the french fry and the dip)¬†

3. bacon Ranch Quesadilla: ( took buffalo meat and it was just awesome.. all the stars I have given is mainly for this dish..)The service is really good. we were there for almost 2 hours and once we have even requested for re-heating the burgers, and they did with a smile. also we got a free wifi.. thumbs up to that..
Pricing: ¬†its okay but keep in mind they take a separate 10% service charge on the food bill other than the normal VAT+ ST

Another one of the relatively new restaurants to have become a popular choice for experiencing good food is Chilis. It is located in one of the most popular malls in Kolkata, the Quest Mall. I had gone here quite a while ago and though I could not try much, since I was alone, I saw a lot of promise in their menu. The happy faces of the diners evidently proved that the food was loved by all. I went with a rather safe option of Chicken Fajitas and a Cheesecake for dessert. 
The fajitas were really really amazing. They were fresh and vibrant and refreshed my palette. I savoured every bit of it and it was quite a generous serving for one. I was nearly full by the end of it. The cheesecake was also quite delicious! Till that point of time, I had never had a better cheesecake in my life! Though subsequently, I tried the cheesecake at Rouge and it has become my absolute favourite without a shadow of a doubt! Nonetheless, the cheesecake here was also up there in terms of quality. 
So, to sum it up, I had an enjoyable meal and the pocket pinch was okay! I mean it's certainly on the higher side, but the food actually felt worth it and so I won't complain about the price too much! For now, I have settled at a 4,because there's lots to try before I give the verdict :P 
Though based solely on what I have tried so far, I would say a 4.5 would be a decent judgement. 
I look forward to going again soon and based on my experience, increase the rating to what I actually feel this place deserves, which is a 4.5 at least!

It was a Saturday, when we four (me & my girl friends) landed up in this place hoping it to be turned out to be a great evening. However we started with a bucket of corona which had four of them. As we all know how corona tastes, it was chilled good. Food started with cheese poppers which had six cheese balls deep fried. it was very okaish nothing extra ordinary. There was very less cheese in it. Next came tripple dipper. It had three types of starter. Only best part were the carrots. As these over priced food weren't helping our hunger to go away we decided to order a pasta, chip SW veg pasta. It tasted bland, honestly a very bad experience ¬†apart from the beer nothing was good at this place and the worst thing happened when the bill was for 4000/-. i don't think I'm ever gonna pay any visit to this place.

We ordered the bottomless chips ( it gets refilled free when u finish it and ask for more),  chicken tacos , santa fe salad and a vegetarian sandwich. The rice and beans with the Tacos were out of this world and i had to fight with my son for it. Obviously he won.  Luckily we did not have to fight for the chips as it gets refilled.  Salad was too good to be true. I could bot stop the  fries with the salad sauce.  Enjoy the ambience and the food.

Decor is good . Service is fast and courteous . Have been to Chilli's outside india so food was little disappointing as the expecting was higher .  Price is premium so they  should improve  on the food , just putting up Mexican and American dishes on menu is not enough they need to prepared with authenticity.

If you have to spend a special day with special someone and taste one of the most special cuisine in town, this is the place you can go to. The staff @chilis would wish your loved one/someone special in the most special way and make his/her day even more special.

Try the nachos. I've tried the chicken nachos and the taste is simply out of the world. I loved the smoky chicken fajitas and crispy fish tacos.
I won't say much about the desserts. Try it yourself to experience the heavenly taste.
Be there at least on one of your special days to experince what I have experienced....

Firstly, the good aspects
Great ambience. Good food! And they started serving liquor. We ordered a few beers, a lunch combo (that had a soup and chicken crispers) followed by Fajitas. The serving size was good as well.

However, the whole experience was almost destroyed by the behaviour of one of the staff. We ordered a single lunch combo and he brought two. There was some confusion in the way he took the order. However, he kept telling us that it was our problem and he can't do anything about it. When we insisted that he should take the extra order back, he again told us that we should order properly and he did not mishear us, before he took the extra order back after 5 minutes after consulting someone. Never before, I am made to hear so much for a confusion that arose because the waiter didn't confirm our order. It didn't stop there, when we ordered the next dish, and repeated that please bring only one, he again kept telling us that it was our problem and wasn't ready to let it go. Till the end, he didn't even realize that he made a mistake and wasn't even apologetic about it. Almost destroyed our experience. Staff must be trained better. Particularly, this person.

Finally, it's off the bucket list. :D My friends and I had been waiting for quite long to go to Chili's. I am completely smitten by its lovely decor, music and ambience and obviously, the main part, the Food. :) We started off with Triple Dippers. The Chicken Crispers and Country-fried Crispers were just too good, whereas the Southwestern Eggrolls were a bit bland. The dips were amazing and together it made a great combination.
We ordered a Presidente Margarita and a Blue Pacific Margarita and the moment they served us, we were extremely happy seeing the huge glasses. :) The generous proportions are worth the pocket pinch.
Next we ordered Chipotle Chicken Flat Bread Pizzas and let me tell you, they were delicious with soft crust and great topping.
The staff was very friendly and cooperative.
I am looking forward to going to Chili's again, as I have many things left to taste.
This is probably the best Mexican-Italian eatery I have been to. This place is a must-go for everyone.

The quality of food was too good. The burgers and the mocktails were delicious. Would definetly recommend to others. With other outlets of chilis coming up in South City and Acropolis Mall, it would certainly create a good customer base within a short span of time. The staff is quite friendly. Overall, 4.0/5.0.

Went to Chili's at Quest today. The ambience is really good and you get a good view of the city if you manage to get a table by the window. The staff is very friendly too.
Coming to the food, we had ordered fresh mex chicken enchilada, crispy chicken taco, tortilla crusted chicken, homestyle fries and finally chocolate truffle cheese cake for dessert. The food was great as usual and authentic tex-mex. The quantity is more than adequate.
Looking forward to visit again soon.

Chili's gained its name in the culinary world by serving exquisite from Mexican and American style of dishes.This particular outlet is located in the food court of Quest mall and has long ques outside right from its opening.The decor is excellent and the bar set up with 6-7 bar stools deserves a special mention.
We were given preferred seating on arrival. For starters we had Triple Decker ( which had chicken wings,southwestern egg rolls,country fried crisp along with 3 dips like honey mustard,avocado etc) and Tacos.This was followed by Baby Back Pork Ribs with BBQ sauce,Chicken Fajita,Blackend Basa and Salmon Fish.The Fajita came with 3 tortillas,sliced juicy chicken breasts,caramelized onions,sliced bell peppers,cilantro,garlic butter and various condiments like dry grated cheese salsa etc for wrapping it.The pork dish was served with mashed potatoes. We had non alcoholic mojitos as refreshers.
Overall a very nice experience and i would highly recommend this place to people who look beyond Indian & Chinese,the two most readily available cuisines in our city.

I wanted to visit this place because heard so much about it. ¬†Ordered Chicken Club Tacos which was kind of OK, taste wise. I was really disappointed with the quality of ¬†the Fish & Chips served, which was greasy. /- Waiters are friendly but overall a little too over priced.

Honestly ... Kinda disappointed . Probably one of those rare off days these guys probably experienced . The chicken honey strippers were soft ... The promised grilled shrimps were NOT SPICY as suggested by the server. Friendly waiters . Prompt food delivery. 

P.s - the VEG TACOS HAD NO TASTE #justsaying

Had been long planning to drop here  and one day finally went for Lunch.
The place is very sophisticated and well planned. We took the window side seats where the view was really beautiful. We had ordered Southern Smokehouse Burger stuffed with bacon, cheese, onion rings, lettuce, tomato which was served with French Fries & Classic BBQ Sauce and from the special menu we had ordered New Glazed Shrimo Fillet which was Buffalo Steak served with Corn, Spinach, Cheese Dipper. In drinks we had Molten Chocolate Chunk which was very good and happy hour was on so we got Mahou Pint 1 + 1. The staffs are very polite and helpful. Overall it was an amazing experience.

Chili's- it was my first visit to the world famous tex-mex food chain. And oh boy! I can say it was a mind blowing experience. I went with a friend. We had shakes in beverages and triple dipper along with it. Although I thought the prices are high, seeing the portion of the dish, I had to change my opinion. This place is worth every penny. And I have not even come to their best part: the service. The staff at chili's is amazing. They are courteous, welcoming and vibrant. Seems like every one on work is quite passionate about what they do. 
Food :4.5/5.   
Service :5/5.

My introduction to Mexican food was here. We tried their thin crust pizza, AL pesto pasta and the black bean tortillas. Taste wise they're all good. The service was great and the staff were also friendly. (There's free Wi-Fi, but you have to ask them for the password;) ) It's a bit expensive but you won't eat here every day, anyway so... Perfect place for trying something new!

Authentic Mexican is still a rarity in the town so it was welcome to have an American casual diner set up shop. Located on the top of the Mall, the airy space inside gives a nice panoramic view of the hustle-bustle of Ballygunj. Seating was on sofas or chairs, both of which I found to be a bit on the cheaper side. The d√©cor was pretty peppy with a lot of color going on. Didn't sit in the bar but it felt okay. I ordered a grilled tenderloin medium cooked with steamed brocolli and fries. The dishes/utensil in which food were served felt to have been chosen as a cost-cutting afterthought. The steak was a little undercooked and chewy, but juicy at least. Fries were pretty darn good. We ordered a calif. chicken pizza which tasted amazing. I was blown away by the quality, taste and care with which the pizza has been prepared. A side of boneless chicken wings was equally great; the meat was tender and juicy, and the crust had a very interesting sweet, tangy flavor. Thumbs up for service and requests; the staff were going the extra mile to make our dinner enjoyable. I felt the price justified the food, sans the serving. Washrooms were really great and spotless.

TLDR: Food and ambience are quite good, as is service. Seating and serving could use some work. Highly recommended.

One of my fave restaurants In this city.. I've been to all of the 3 outlets but I find the decor and the ambience of the acropolis one and this one to be better than the south city outlet.
Food is great, staff very polite and oh we even got a free dessert with our bill which we can redeem the next time we visit Chili's. üòÅ
Personal faves-
The tenderloin steak.. Cooked to perfection(I like it medium rare)
The nachos with guacomole- bliss!
And their burgers.. Good stuff man. Cheers!
P.s.- pasta in white sauce was quite bland and hence the 0.5 reduction in rating!üòù

I went to Chilli's on a winter night with a group of friends. I love squid so we started of with their Calamari and it was fantastic. Then we had Enchiladas and Quesadillas. They were good, though could have been better. Finally the had the chocolate truffle cheese cake, this is must try for all. But when it came to alcohol we ordered two Long Island Iced Tea and both didn't have the slightest amount of alcohol. I was really disappointed.

This places remains crowded always. I had to wait few minutes to get my seat. It's very average , I don't know what the hype is all about. They don't have standard way of serving food . presentation was quite unappealing which was a complete turn off being such fine place it should have appealing serving. The staff was very friendly and service was 4/5. Very average place you should rather visit smoke house deli in quest which is far more better than this. Food was regular rather it could be better. They gave a coupon for free appetizer on next visit to be redeemed within 30 day which is nice effort to lure customers.

Chili's is a nice place with good food, ambiance and amiable service. I grabbed a late night dinner recently. I was traveling alone and had to fly back home at midnight so decided to drop by here as I was craving for Mexican for quite a long time. 
Being a lone foodie, I ordered a fresh mex bowl with cottage cheese which is basically a naked burrito. Being an ardent lover of guacamole I ordered it in sides, surprisingly for two small spoons of guacamole I was billed 60 bucks.
Moving on, the tex mex bowl was great, the serving was huge making it difficult for me to finish.  I paid 450 bucks for these 2 items which is not terrible given the good food and service. If you want good mexican do check out Chili's.

Really nice interiors, friendly staff and good service. We went there as a group of five and were given suggestions as to which item to order so that it would suffice for all of us. The calamari is my favourite appetizer, it is really delicious. for mains we ordered Cajun Pasta which was creamy. I didn't really like the honey chipotle chicken crispers. It was way too sweet for my liking. We also took Bacon ranch Quesadillas which were wholesome. The molten chocolate cake, for me was molten but for one of my friend, the chocolate didn't ooze out as it is supposed to.

Been to Chili's twice and both times left with a happy stomach. Their reputation matches their quality of food. Their staff very well trained and prompt to answering questions.¬†

For starters we had the Triple Dipper and onion and capsicum fry. Both were exceptional and the quantity was amazing as well.¬†

For the main course we tried their "amazing" burgers and their burgers did definitely live up to their reputation of being amazing.¬†

There isn't much more to say about this place other than the fact that it definitely lives up to it's name and ratings. Maybe a little pricey but there is absolutely no compromise on their taste or quantity.¬†

Would love to visit the place more often

I tried the non veg tripple dipper last week and I got to say I loved the Country fried crisper. The California Grilled Chicken Pizza was delicious (with a hint of freshness from the diced tomatoes and herbs on top). This was the first time I tried out the Long Island Iced Tea and to be honest, I'm more than satisfied. All in all, a good experience. 
P.S.- Their Brownie Sundae is the best. <3

My wife was having a craving for burger for the last few days, and so we decided to visit Chili's. This was our 2nd visit, and I was already impressed by their steak during the last visit.

The staff greeted us, and quickly arranged a table for us. We ordered mango youghurt smoothie, watermelon moji tea and triple dipper for our appetizers. You can order three things out of two types of crispy fries, chicken wings, egg rolls and boneless chicken wings. The three dips are very nice. The chicken wings were a little too tangy.

For mains, we ordered lamb shanks and herb grilled fish from their special menu and Cajun chicken burger. The lamb shank looked awesome and tasted very well also. The fish was nicely grilled, and was very soft. The burger was good and tasty as well.

The staff were courteous and were prompt as well. The decor is very American.

Chili's is one of my favorite places. To eat, to drink with friends. Even for birthday treats. Almost everything I've tried tasted amazing.
I recommend:¬†
Starters: ¬†Quesadilla , don't have tacos (Not that good, well I tried sometime back, so they might have improved their quality.)¬†
Nachos is great!!
Country Fried Chicken or chicken crispers

Calamari (yum!!)
Mains:¬†Fajita!! They were amaziiiing. I have that every time! Baby back ribs is also really good! Try the flat bread pizza for a different looking pizza, and it's delicious.
Definitely try one of the salmon dishes. Extremely good!¬†

I never had the burgers, but I've heard they are really good.¬†
Drinks: Must must try the margarita. They serve it in a huuuge glass and it's brilliant. Just amaaazing. They also have happy hours till 8, so maybe you could avail that. :D
This place always makes me happy!

Came to know about this restaurant while strolling in the mall. The moment I entered, the loud music and the cordial staff welcoming actually set the mood to another level (like giving an assuring that you will definitely have a good time). We ordered quite a few dishes and we were delighted. Food delivery was quick. Overall experience was good.
It is since then we keep going often and by now I have tried quite a few dishes. To name a few..Ancho chili salmon (fish was tender and juicy), Cajun club sandwich and chipotle pasta are some dishes which they have never go wrong. Coming to the dessert, try their signature dish molten chocolate cake. That is one mouth watering sweet. Apart from this, even chocolate chip paradise pie is good. 
A big thumbs up to chili's for the amazing food they serve, to the friendly staff and the quick service they provide.

It was a lovely day out at chilli's. Thumps up for the place.

I have been to this place 3-4 times in last 2-3 months. The menu is refreshingly good and elaborate. The best item as of now is the smoked turkey sandwich and southwestern chicken. The drink options are quite good and this place has the best Mojito I had I recent times.

Service wise - The attendants have been quite good and well mannered. Sometimes there is a delay in service but overall the food quality suppresses this shortcoming.

Hi!:)
So this is my first review.Hence I decided to start with one of my favourite restaurants. I had visited Chili's first 2 years back on my birthday.Since then it has been an absolute favourite.I like their ambience, their staff is extremely cordial and I feel that the food is value for money.
I will definitely recommend their non veg triple dipper which is absolutely amazing and a regular favourite. On my recent visit I found out that now you can choose the three different kind of appetizers that you wish to have,which is great.Their fresh me bowls , roasted red pepper chicken taste amazing.For desert I love their brownie sundae!
BUT the baby back ribs is extremely disappointing.We had ordered half rack pork ribs in BBQ Sauce and it was a complete waste of money.Despite this,it's a great place to have a meal!Dig in to the food! :)

We ordered what not! - Nachos, Burgers (Grilled Chicken, Classic Bacon etc.), Pizzas (Margherita, Chipotle Chicken), Quesadillas (Bacon Ranch), Tacos (Crispy Tacos). Apart from the Tacos, everything else was mouth watering. In dessert, Chocolate Truffle Cheesecake and Chocolate Chip Paradise Pie were delicious. In drinks, tried J√§gerbomb for the first time, and then later again had a shot of J√§germeister. The latter one was worth it!
Service is great and quick. The staffs are cheerful and friendly. Not to mention again about the yum food. Loved the place.. Gonna visit there again soon!

Like always it was overcrowded and we needed a seat for 2 they wrote our name and told us to wait outside for 10 mins but in about 2 to 3  mins two gentlemen entered asked for a seat of 2 and he was immediatly given a seat..  When I reported the same they said we are sorry we forgot please wait for 15 mins.. I would request you guys to please throw that useless waiting list book of yours and also the podium outside your restaurant cause you guys really don't know how do use either of them..  Sick..

What a great place to meet up with old buddies and have a feast !!. Their cocktails are great and their starters are lipsmacking. The place is lively and in between a sports pub and a cafe.¬†

Their chicken starters are great and having tried most of the non-veg on their menu, almost all the dishes taste nice. While I am not a vegetarian, people around me who had the veg food said it was decent but nothing spectacular. All together a satisfactory experience, especially for burger and fries cravings.

We had dinner there today. The entire experience (food, service) was great except for an unfortunate incident that happened at the end. The waiter who was serving us bought the bill and left. I put my credit card along with the bill and gave it to another waiter who was passing by. He took it without any issues. After sometime another guest came and asked me if the card lying somewhere on the floor was my card. I was surprised to find that it was. He informed me that there was an altercation between the previous waiter and the waiter I handed the card to - after which the previous waiter just threw my card on the floor and left. The surprising fact is that even after complaining to the previous waiter she behaved as if she did not know about this incident - though her manager apologized and mentioned that he would look into it.

Chili's is an American chain restaurant serving Mexican American and Italian cuisine and its counterpart here in Kolkata is serving sincere ,honest and true to its cuisine food.Completely following the norms of its origin country,the lightning arrangements,decor ,ambience ,serving style and even its huge water tumblers are reminiscent of American pub style eateries.
    Visited The place seeking some genuine Mexican and must say was not disappointed.Tried the cheese poppers and classic nachos ,liked both of it.
   For the mains tried the vegetarian black bean burger,which was good as well.The veg quesadilla was quiet tasty and was pleased to see that they did not miss out on the sour cream although texture wise it was quite different from the real stuff,also the bean tasted more Indian than Mexican,however points for the effort.Visited this place umpteenth times,and never disappointed.
 Even tried a veg burrito bowl which was great.Very American as food is always in good quantity and thus value for money.For dessert never really experimented or went beyond its patent molten lava cake.
 Must add that true to the American traditions,they are mindful of their little kid guests.Always providing crayons and something for them to scribble and keeping busy,not to forget the separate kids menu which have always provided simpler alternatives for little ones.
   Great place to go to.Perhaps a remarkable thing which sets them apart from their American counterpart is the wide array of sumptuous vegetarian options.Kudos for that!

My sister went to Delhiwala Chili's and had food there and she was amazed so she took me and my parents to Chili's at Quest

We had :-

¬†Triple Dipper - Portions were small. there were 3 Chicken Crispers , 4 pieces of wings and some Southwestern Egg rolls. Egg rolls, I personally didn't like and other two were okay. I liked best the Chicken Crispers.
Roasted Red Pepper Chicken - I liked it. It was nice. To rate it out of 5, I would give 3.5
Fajita's - Now that was great. Crispy Onion rings with yummy chicken and veggies

Blackened Fish - It was alright

Overall feedback -
Food - 3.5/5
Staff - 4/5
Ambience - 4/5
Value for Money - 3/5, Tex-Mex wise

They have so much to offer that one visit won't be sufficient ever. The staff is very friendly and do their job well. Calamari rings is the best thing to start with. You don't find any thing to complain about. Price is slightly towards the higher side but then its in Quest mall.

Checked in here when I visited kolkata to meet a friend. 
The place looks cute, isn't very big. 
I liked the menu. The food was good to taste too! I ordered a pasta and tortilla crusted chicken. 
The chicken was very delicious to taste and pasta was okay  I've had better. 
The service was "too friendly"! 
Overall a good place to have good food.

Outstanding is the word to start with. Amazing food along with super hospitality and service. I went for dinner along with my @wife and to friends to celebrate our first anniversary. It was only four of us and we never mentioned it was our anniversary still somehow they realised and to our serprise all the stuffs celebrate it with an amazing cake and wishes. This is the extra mile they went for customer service. Food was amazing as expected. But the mango drink was stand out for me.

One of the leading destinations for unprejudiced  meat lovers in Kolkata. If you are willing to spend more and have a great time with firends, you can visit this joint. They serve drinks to so its always a bonus.

Food: We had boneless chicken wings, classic bacon burger, chocolate chip paradise pie and nachos along with a few pegs. Foods tastes pretty good and you can choose from a huge menu of tacos, wraps, salads and burgers. The only pinch is the steep price I felt. You can easily get billed for 5-6k and still feel "inadequate".

Service: Service is awesome which can be expected with the huge taxes and class this place offers

Ambiance: A cafe/lounge experience, one of a kind I would say, its definitely not generic, quite refreshing I would say.

Verdict: If you are willing to spend 5k and have a good time, this is your place, I could not rate it more than 3.5 because of the steep price tags they put on the dishes, which seems bit excess at the end of the day.

Very much over hyped. Despite all the people talking about it in glowing terms, I would not recommend it.

Pros: I have been to both Quest and South City Chili's and the following holds true for both. Ambiance is fantastic including the decor. South City Chili's have even got a smoking chamber for those who needs it. The overall atmosphere is sure to captivate you. The management and staff is helpful.

Cons: I will be very brief. In terms of the money you will be spending, the quality and quantity of each food item is below par. Everything is damn expensive to the point it will bother you. There are lot of fancy named items on the menu but from my two experiences, they are all above average at best when you compare the cost.¬†

Entirely my personal opinions. No issues if you happen to disagree. I would suggest going to some fancy dining place instead. If you can afford Chili's, you can pay a bit more surely.

I see people crazy about this place, but i dont find one good reason. I guess all of them are cheese lovers, as chili's add cheese to all their dishes. Nothing  apart from the service, is excellent. But still every time i visit quest, i see a long queue waiting outside the restaurant. It doesn't appeal my taste buds though.

Furst visit was  been almost forced to enter this place coz of  the hungry souls(read my sister and husband) after a movie. At a glance I fell in love with the ambience  and then came the food. yummilicious.... my favourite  dish is #barbequechickensalad
I would highly recommend to try out the margaritas they serve here.
Now there are quite a few outlets u can choose from but I still go back to this particular outlet.

Another late review for this eatery. After an afternoon show at Inox Quest Mall we were famished , headed straight to Chili's. We were greeted well and shown a comfortable sit out. We ordered the Soup of the day which was cream of chicken n mushroom, nachos with fajita chicken and a three dip chicken platter for appetizer. The nachos were extremely palatable. Big n Crisp nachos loaded with cheese, chicken served with salsa. The dip platter had hot wings , country chicken crispers, boneless hot wings. Loved the country chicken crispers. ....the dips were excellent. Mains I had a sizzling chicken n shrimp fajita. Kids had chicken ranch burger and classic bacon burger. The fajita was mind blowing. Served with 8 condiments including assorted Jack cheddar n Monterey cheese, guacamole, salsa, Pico de gaullo , mayonnaise and warm tortillas. The Chicken was superbly grilled. ...tender and juicy.The shrimps were big and amicably grilled. DIVINE. The burgers were gigantic and served with generous amount of fries. The Ranch Burger had a crispy fried chicken fillet with ranch dressing. Wholesome and flavoursome. The Classic Bacon burger with chicken patty  had a medium grilled patty, loaded with crisp bacon and cheese. My son loved it thoroughly. This place is exotic and gourmet. Pocket pinch is obviously high for gourmet food. Worth trying if u have an acquired taste for Mexican, American and Italian cuisine. Verdict : Enjoyable.

This place is never quite being the 1st outlet in the city... I love this place for its vibe and ofcourse food...there sandwiches and burgers are really nice worth mentioning.... Their famous item Triple Dipper is what I ddnt like though... It tasted very local, and so was their chicken pasta in white sauce...it was nothing international like there burgers and sandwiches were...on the other hand nachos were really good and cheesy...the last time I went there I tried there soup called terlingua buffalo chili, it was something very different and tasted good...crispy onion rings very really good too...

Food: 4/5

Starting with triple dipper and moving to fajita trio and last but not the least tortilla crusted chicken...a day can't be more apt than this. The best was the prawns of fajita trio..literally mouth watering and sumptuous... Tried beef for the first time.. And waiting for another chance to gulp it down...just go and enjoy a lavish dining.. :-) :-)

This is the first outlet of the well known Tex-Mex restaurant. Chili's is nothing new to Kolkatans these days. Two more outlets have opened their gates. One in South City Mall and the recently opened one at the top floor of Acropolis Mall.
‚Ä¢
My experience at Chili's started off here at this outlet in Quest Mall. Located on the floor of the Quest Mall Food Court the restaurant has a great warm ambiance with a good choice of music playing in the background. The seating arrangements are quite comfortable and the staffs are very much courteous. About everything you ask them, they are very polite and give you a warm smile. A good behaviour gives a good feeling about every place.
‚Ä¢
Lets talk about food now. As we had a very heave breakfast we kicked off our lunch with some starters by ordering Classic Nachos. My God! They are just awesome. Crispy on the outside with moreish toppings, these are some palatable Nachos served with Pico de Galio, Guacamole and Sour Cream! The Nachos are topped with some delicious melted cheese, jalape√±os, cheese, beans etc. Probably the best Nachos I had.
‚Ä¢
For the mocktails I ordered Non-Alcoholic Orange Margarita & pints of some flavorous Evolution mocktail. Evolution Mocktail is made with Pineapple & other mixed fruit flavors and was my favourite among the two of them. Both were quite refreshing to have.
‚Ä¢
Then I ordered Cajun Chicken Burger with Swiss Cheese, Lettuce with Smoky Ranch Dressing. Super yummy with lots of cheese and crispy french fries served along with it. What I loved the most is the thick chicken in between the burger. I freaking loved it. Till now my tummy was almost satisfied but the quality and taste of the food was not letting me to stop.
‚Ä¢
Next came Smoky Chipotle Chicken Fajitas. This one was pure bliss. One of the best Tex-Mex cuisine I've ever had. The dish contains trips of tender bell chicken with bell peppers and onions, topped with Jack cheese, chipotle aioli, cilantro & crispy onion strings. Damn good it was. But both of us were struggling to finish the dish.
‚Ä¢
Chili's is a great restaurant with top quality service, delightful ambiance & great food. One will have very few complains about this restaurant after experiencing it. Would love to go back to this place soon.

If i compare this to Delhi's Chili's, this one stand no near..... seemed a big big mistake to recommend to my besties and going with them..... felt so low down.
The staff said they don't book tables, we can wait there and we get tables in 5-10 minutes.... so we came after 15 minutes & she asked to wait for 1 hour and wrote my number down.. since we were in mood to try chili's we waited for our table.
The food- kids combo of pizza, french fries-- too oily, Classic Nachos- where not crispy and werr soggy, vegetarian Tripple Dripper- the Cheese balls had all the oil in the world ; the paneer fingers where bad version of paneer pakoda and southernrolls smelled of eggs, veggie and cheese quesadillas- lack all the flavours, garlic bread- can't taste garlic in it, watermelon mojito- it wasn't chilled, &tasted like iced tea & classic mojito didn't had any fizz, even after asking to check the drinks, the server just filled the glasses and gave us.... overall A Bad Experience and a lesson learned... a brand can't be equally good everywhere.

The only Chili's outlet in the city of joy which means the place is always crowded and sometimes the only place to sit can be at the bar. The amazing and great food for a budgeted meal is to be found here. Perfect stomach filling Mexican food such as the chicken wings, Cajun chicken pasta, fish and chips , pizzas and burgers and so on are a variety to choose from. Being a huge Chili's  food fan, my personal favourite has always been the fish and chips which wins my heart. Also the desserts are a to die for specially the mud cake. The outlet also offers great variety of drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic. Few recommendations would be the cosmopolitan, the screw driver, the daiquiri and the mojito.

Good service, good food and "great" prices...
I mean literally the prices were great...
There were 4 of us and the bill came to about 5000 bucks..
Also there weren't many drinks one could choose from. They only had pitchers of Kingfisher light which wasn't that great either..
But there was 1 silver lining, the food. I have just one word for it- Awesome...
I mean the country fried chicken, pork steak, trio fajitas were all amazing, but the best dish hands down was the bacon and cheese burger. It was like this big platter of melt in your mouth goodness...
I would seriously recommend people to go to Chili's for the food...

Coming to the food. Ordered tripple dipper and baby back ribs(classic). For desserts molten lava cake and choco chip paradise pie. I loved them all. Specially the tripple dipper and molten lava cake. Though the price is on the higher side but you won't mind it. Would like to mention here that the staff sang a beautiful birthday song for a little boy who was celebrating his birthday. It was really a nice touch. overall I am very satisfied and would like to visit soon.

A chain restaurant but has lived up to its name chilli's one of the biggest in the food industry just because pf the food they serve.
The food at chillis is just amazing. 
The burgers the chicken wings the pizzas etc etc just makes you wana go back again and again. 
The best i found about this place was the humble nature of the servers who while taking the order sit down so that you dont have to look up to them. You are at the same level and thats the respect all diners deserve. 
So just the food doesnt matter the overall experience is what brings back a customer to the restaurant agin and again.

Coming down to food section I tried few of them but believe me all of them were awsum tasty.. From drinks to appetisers to main course all are fantastic. But I must say one should try Zambolia rice and fajitas.. They are superb. The ambience is also very nice. One area of improvement according to me is the menu card which i think can be more explanatory for the first timer as the cuisines are bit different. Really kolkata got an unique restaurant in terms of cuisines..

Coming to the drinks ...margaritas were ok nothing great about them. The innovative drink was the coronarita. Looked really good but then the taste was not great! Brahma mama and Mai tai tasted the same. So over all I was not impressed with the drinks. Coming to food: triple dipper is a must have. The items cheese poppers, southwest rolls are really good. So as the quesedillas. I am impressed by the food. For the next time the flat breads/pasta are on my list here. Definitely coming back here for the food.

Infinitely satisfied with everything it has to offer & equally dissatisfied with the final hefty pinch in the pocket, missing out the happy hour & disaster being made right there itself....... Well that's Chili's!!!

even when your conscience pushes you repeatedly towards self restrain given the fact that you have just missed a "must" in their happy hours ... their exquisite offering often blows the barrier off & as a result the flow continued.....Jagerbomb, tequila shots, pitcher of beer on fajitas, steaks, crusted chicken & the triple dipper!!!

Great ambiance with informal setup & above all extremely courteous waiters, a must in Kolkata and equally must on that is to meet their happy hours üòâüòâüòâ

Chili's rocks.....

Chilli's is one of my favourite continental restaurant in the city. I think this one sentence pretty much sums up my opinion of the place. And a special dinner on a new year's day is definitely an added bonus. The place was pretty crowded when my friends and I reached over there. But they provided us w@ith seats within no time at all. We ordered grilled chicken pizza, chicken and shrimp fajita, smoked chicken ham sandwich, pinacolada and paradise pie. Well, to begin I just loved the pizza. I have a fascination for thin crust pizza and this was perfect for my taste buds. The pinacolada was just what you need with your smoking hot fajita. But the pick of the lot will definitely be the dessert. It was just yum. The cake just melted in my mouth and I couldn't just have enough of it. A great  foodie start to a new year!

I keep going back here. No matter what food i've tried, nothing has ever disappointed me. Quantity wise, the fajitas and the burgers ate the best. The lamb patty mini burgers or grilled chicken ones, very yummy. They come with fries and onion rings. I recently tried the grilled steak fajita. It was amazing. The meat was really tender and they came with an array of really yummy dips. I was a little disappointed by the happy hours though. For, you could only get two same drinks on the BOGO offer which is not the case in Chili's Gurgaon. Hope the acropolis mall Chili's and south city mall Chili's are as good and they get their bar licenses soon. I missed the Bailey's cocktails on the menu. And I loved the molten chocolate cake. <3

Especially like the Margarita Cocktails!

Food Favorites are Nachos, Burgers, Cheese Poppers, Texas Fries, Pizzas....basically everything!

Cheers! To many more great evenings at Chili's :)

Went for a "Fat Christmas lunch" with my family.I am so glad that this place made my Christmas so special.Though the crowd rush was huge due to festive season,but we just had to wait for 15 ¬†mins for our table.The staff was really polite,quick and helpful.They really know what kind of food to suggest to their customers.
For cocktails- We ordered Hawaiian Margarita,Bahama Mama and Mojito. All the cocktails instantly energized our mood.The blend was just so perfect. <3
For mocktails-Berry delight and Mango refresher.The juices were fresh.For Appetizers-Non veg Triple Dipper(Chicken Crispers,Chicken Fried Crispers,Southwestern egg rolls with glazed carrots).The finger food was hot,crispy and with enough portions of chicken in them.The dips were yummy. :)For Main course- Ancho Salmon,Smoky chicken Chipotle Fajita,Chicken Shrimp Fajita

The food was piping hot with fulfilling portions and it justified the price we paid.
Lastly,the ambiance was cozy,tables and the cutlery were clean.The Christmas decoration and the staff in Christmas costumes gave us a warm Christmas feeling.Choosing Tex-Mex cuisine for the day was indeed a good choice.But would be better if you can increase space in the restaurant.The walking spaces were too narrow.

A very small and nice place to spend your evening. Been there with a friend. Ordered their signature dish Tripper dipper( which was a bit salty as per my taste), Smokey chicken fajita(accompanied with salad, cheese n tortillas) and mango refresher(liked it very much!). Foods are nice but highly overpriced.

If you like American food in the Tex-Mex style, Chili's is MADE for you, being one of the very few food joints in the city that serve the cuisine. In kolkata, i wouldn't hesitate calling it one of the best eating joints catering to all age groups. And the food, is mouth watering-even as i am typing this out, i'm craving their Texas Cheese Poppers! Their Quesadilla Explosion Salad is SO TASTY, with an accurate balance of flavours that you're almost full! Even though the restaurant serves more Non Veg, than veg-the lipsmacking food makes up for it! their burgers are large and filling, along with the fries and dips that come along with it. I have tried a bite from all the burgeers they have to offer and i have liked all! what i really liked about the place was that, not only did they have Thin Crust Pizzas but also oven baked 6 and 9 inch pizzas!- even though i wish, they had MORE VARIETY of VEG PIZZAS! Yes, you can always add garnishing-but thats not the point, of coming to a food joint to make your own pizza-some might like it, some dont. The Parmesan Crusted Cottage Cheese Quesedilla's cottage cheese was very moist and lacked consistency and didnt quite look like what it was shown in the picture. the Beverages were REALLY NICE though!-specially the Cherry Cola and the long island ice tea. They even had Robert Mondavi Cabernet Sauvignon!-which absolutely made my day.
the desserts could have done with some MORE QUANTITY, and more genrosity with the strawberry sauce of the cheese cake.however tge choco cheese cake was OUT OF THE WORLD!
if you want to have a nice evening out with family and friends-this is the right place. however it isnt suitable for fine dining, or a formal dinner! :)
best wishes to Team Chili's!

We went today,that is on Christmas 2015. Though we had to wait outside since it was crowded, we got our seats by 15minutes. The place is simply cute. I loved the decor. The service is too good. The staff are really well trained and well mannered. We ordered for Country Fried Chicken, Chipotle Pesto Chicken pasta in white sauce and Chipotle Pesto Chicken pasta in red sauce. The food was simply awesome.( But I didn't like the sweet corn served with it. It was too sweet for me.)¬†
We didn't try any drinks so cannot comment on that.¬†
The food was a bit expensive, but as far as the taste goes, I think that its worth it . Also we got 3 pieces(small) fruit cakes, freshly baked as it was Christmas. I would totally recommend this place if you are looking to eat something different. Cheers !

Every food lovers paradise.. 
One cant just stop eating when you visit Chili's.. The only way you can stop is your valet giving up.. This restaurant offers so much variety & everything is so top notch that one needs to visit multiple times to acknowledge the wide range of cuisines.. The staff are courteous.. Ambience is apt and interiors are beautiful.. 
Must try quessadilas for the engaging mayonese and cottage cheese which they use.. Never tasted something similar before.. Loved the experience..

What a day ‚ù§Ô∏è 
My brothers bdae ! He always wanted to go there for his bdae ! So we decided and went up there ! He was so excited and started by ordering Classic Nachos, Strawberry lemonade , evolution mocktail , Drilled Chicken Fagitas ! And the longest wait started.... After like waiting for an hour one of staff took the initiative and asked us why we were waiting so long , my brother told him we already had ordered but still no food and not even water we got ! And it was so sweet of them and apologised and within 5minutes we got all our foods ! As it was my brothers bdae they wished him with a song and a molten brownie which was so nice ! Everything was so perfect the food, service, ambience ! Will love  to go there again and again ! Have fallen for Chilli's ‚ù§Ô∏è

We went in for evening snacks. The place is a good place to be. No problem with the service, staff courtesy. But the food is a bit different. May be i don't have the taste to understand it. The restaurant chef loves pepper sauce and uses too much of it.
The mocktails were decent. The lemonade has unlimited refills.

Courteous stuffs make warm welcome to set the mood for a great dining experience. Check if you manage a seat by the window, so you can get a nice view of surroundings.

Now coming to the food, if you have tried Chili's in US, you can see some similarity in drinks and food menu. Also they have intoduced bottomless soft drink ( unlimitted soft drinks for one @ Rs 95).

We have tried CHICKEN ENCHILADAS, which came with 2 enchiladas, rice and black beans. It was topped with cilantro, sweet corn, onion and tomato. Rice and black beans was full of fresh flavors. Only complain is, both the enchiladas were hard at the ends, it tasted like papad at last and first bites.

Next thing we tried is, CHIPOTLE RICE BOWL WITH CHICKEN. This was having generous anount of grilled chicken, spiced rice, black beans, onion, tomato, bell pepper, corn, lettuce, cheese and a lime slice.the only thing missing was sour cream, maybe it was too less to get noticed.

Ambience - 4.5/5
Food - 4/5
Service - 4/5

Worthy for a next visit?? A big YES!!

Went there for my birthday dinner yesterday with my bff. The place was crowded,but we managed to snag a windowside seat infront of a flatscreen. The ambience is one that sets you in a chatty and fun mood.
Being football freaks,both of us enjoyed the live screening as we munched away our boneless chicken wings,paired with a couple of beers. We wanted Millers but it wasn't available, so had to settle for carlsberg elephant.The chicken wings were beautiful...soft,juicy with a tangy sauce and went well with the dip provided.
We followed it with an LIIT and a watermelon margherita. The cocktails were brilliant,and really elevated our moods as we chatted and guffawed our way through the evening.
For mains,we ordered a classic steak fajita and a bacon burger. The burger I did not like that much,there was something lacking. The patty was juicy and delicious but the dish overall lacked the punch. 
The fajita was a different story,we wanted our steak medium,and it was beautifully cooked,just soft enough to be easily cut by a knife. We had a good time experimenting with the six accompaniments and the fresh tortillas that come alongside the steak.
The bill came at 3006(they levy a lot of taxes).
I'd love to visit this place again, if only for the steak and the cocktails.

A Neel (namesake) at the bar is always a joy to have at any restaurant! Although, the food is not the most healthy it is ideal for a get together or anything which involves a decent amount of drinking. Like the pub next door, this place is highly recommended for chilling out both on weeknights and weekends.

The best Mexican experience I've ever had. Exactly what I needed.

1.
AMBIANCE
Excellent. Everything melts your heart.

You walk in, sit and look around. If you are seated with a view of the outside, you can look at the busy traffic snaking its way through the crowd.

There is a bar that is aesthetically pleasing. You can look at the waiters looking their best. You can look at your table and find menus and skim through them.

In the end, you can look at the person you came with and feel awesome for picking such a place.

2.
SERVICE
Excellent. They amaze you.

So when our food came this guy walked with a small stool and flipped it open. He out some of the dishes there and some on our table and casually left.

When my margherita arrived I got it with the shaker. I could shake it myself and pour it as much as I needed. Over the course of the meal, I must have filled my glass to the brim thrice.

When we couldn't understand how we were supposed to eat a particular dish, we were helped with a nest little demo.

What else could anyone want? There is nothing of complaint. You go in and rely on them to take care of you, and they live up to the expectations.

3.
FOOD
Excellent. I can't even.

I won't insult the memory by trying to talk about the food.

I do agree that I have had better nachos in the neighboring bar, though. Here the nachos were left with the want of a bit more of generous topping. Also, they were a little, tiniest of bit, soggy.

Everything else is fantastic. I will try attaching pictures that do justice to this review because I so not want to comment more.

I loved the food and I will visit again if chance be.

CLOSING WORDS
If you have some money to throw away in exchange for an incredible experience, come here. It is worth the hype.

Last month we went for dinner. My second outing in chills at quest mall. My daughter tried baby pork ribs, and it turned out to be outstanding
Blackened basa was also upto the mark, however the triple dipper was a disappointment! Except the boneless@ chicken strips rest were not up to the standard we expected.

Visited this "renowned" place finally today. The ambience in quest mall itself creates the atmosphere initially. Service was OK and quick. Coming to food, ordered tripple dipper initially. Thought of rating 3.5, so u know what I mean. In main course, order chipotle rice, quasedillas and chicken & shrimp fajitas. The chipotle rice compelled me to give the 4 rating. Quasedillas was good, but for me the combination was a lil odd. Overall, expectation was so high that meeting that was almost impossible and precisely that is what happened. Good continental food in good ambience - that's my experience.

Personally i love the music played and the special celebration song all the staff sings for the birthday pal.

One of my most favourite place. Whenever I am in Quest a visit to Chili's is a must. Its quite hard to get a seat during holidays or weekends but the staff is super helpful. Made sure we got to sit inside the restuarant to wait. The ambience is very nice. The Quesadilla is a must try there. Its just superb. The one they serve with beans rice salad and yoghurt. Its quite filling too. We tried the Texas cheese balls too..it was nice. The staff is very helpful too. I have loved every visit of mine there and waiting for another one.

My d√©but to Chili's happened last week, along with my bro n sis. So much heard about and so wanted to try this place. It didn't disappoint much, except for one thing, which is stopping me to give it a 4.5 rating, will come to the details in a while, but first let me share what we ordered. TRIPLE DIPPER, CLASSIC NON VEG NACHOS, QUESADILLA & BIG MOUTH BURGERS.. the triple dipper is a thing to crave for, nachos are good, Quesadilla are very good, but the thing that disappointed the most are the big mouth burgers, I have ordered the chicken patty as my bro doesn't eat beef, but to my surprise I found it very very bad in taste. I know that beef patty is the best solution for the burgers but that doesn't mean that the chicken patty won't taste good. There are many examples that proves chicken burgers are a thing to die for. I would like to ask the Chili's authority to look into this matter. Also when we wanted to order Beer, we found that Hieneken wasn't available & to my surprise Budweiser was not included in the menu itself.. we were left with less preferred options. Would like to ask to look into this matter as well.¬†
other than these, everything else was quite a good experience. a great place to try TEXAN cuisine.

Pictures are uploaded at different times so all of them aren't attached to the review.
UPDATE: been going here for the past 2 years and they don't disappoint. Have tried several of their dishes though never the triple dipper.
I'm a chicken lover and for health reasons limit my intake of red meat. So can't tell exactly how good those are but the chicken dishes are great.
Several times have tried their pizzas both pan pizza and flatbread, enchilada, tex mex bowl, burgers, fajitas, quesadillas, etc. The molten chocolate cake is to die for. They have introduced some new dishes for a limited time and among them from their Social menu I loved the creamy chicken wings. Recently they introduced "the art of burger" menu and the pulled chicken burger was amazing. But the show stealer was the mango cheese cake. And one thing they don't serve is disappointment.
Their service is prompt and unless the place is totally packed, they are very attentive.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
Dec. 2015 : Been here 5-6 times and there is nothing new I can write other than the good words that have been written about it already. I can only be another fan of Chili's to recommend others to visit this place and become a fan themselves. Because they never serve disappointment.

My introduction to Tex-Mex cuisine, this place might appear to be a little tough on ur pockets but sure is high on the American feel be it through the ambience or the food.
Having a friend behind the counter meant that I cud be flexible in choosing my dishes and make changes in them as it suited me. I think the folks here giv everyone this offer. I ordered the Tripple Dippler and Blackened Sea Bass. This was enough to feed two hungry stomachs. The chicken is succulent and dips new in taste, although u cud feel that they use frozen chicken rather than fresh. The fish was smooth and buttery and u get quite a big fillet too. Its gentle flavours though didn't quite match with the stir fried rice accompanying it. And the dessert-Chocolate eclair was just awsome-crumbly and chocolaty. All in all a nice place and must go for classics as Fajitas and Quesadillas.
(A big word of advice for those having high expectations from American food as they are quite different from Asian. They concentrate mainly on a few flavours rather than mixing and matching a whole lot of 'masalas' as we Indians do. For some this might be the best they hav had, while for some this may turn up to be a bland experience. So choose ur dishes wisely üòâ )

It was my second visit to this unforgettable food-heaven with an old friend. Luckily this time we didn't have to wait for long, mostly because it was a Tuesday. We were warmly welcomed and given a table at the window. The view of the busy street was pleasant from that height. Soon enough, our friendly waiter handed us our menus and we decided on two molten chocolate chunks for drinks, a bacon burger (with added bacon, of course) for me and a plate of southwestern chicken pasta with white sauce for my friend. The drinks arrived first, we didn't have to wait very long, inspite of the place being almost filled and with the first sip of the melted chocolate, my friend and I, we melted too. It was cold, not too cold, but just the right temperature cold, the right degree of sweetness and just so chocolatey. I wished it would have been a little less heavy, though. As we finished our drinks, the main course arrived and we spent the first five minutes staring at the attractive presentation. My bacon burger was served with home-style fries and what I loved about them was how perfectly crisp and fresh they were. I have this weird fear of my fried being grainy but these were pretty near perfect. The burger, meanwhile was a piece of paradise. The tenderloin patty was cooked to a well done perfection and the taste was absolutely mind blowing. Where I was disappointed was when i realised they had forgotten my extra bacon. Anyway, the bread was not dry, the lettuce and the tomatoes were fresh and crunchy too and I must confess, it proved too big for even my healthy appetite. Not that i had a problem with it. The southwestern pasta I LOVED, maybe because it was topped with flakes of parsley and I have always been desperately in love with parsley. The flavour of the chicken was something I had never tasted before and it was amazing. Pasta was cooked right and the creamy, cheesy sauce was probably the best I have ever tasted. It took us no time at all to finish the whole thing and then we ordered one molten chocolate cake for dessert. As soon as it arrived, we were overawed by the presentation again. It had the most perfect looking chocolate cake with warm chocolate running down its edges and a scoop of vanilla ice cream covered with the frozen chocolate. My friend broke into it with a spoon and out came the element the dish is named after. The molten chocolate. We melted. Again. Then we finished every crumb of it, our breath taken away my the gooey chocolate, the soft, perfectly baked cake and the dollop of vanilla on top of it. One cake was good enough for the two of us after that deliciously heavy meal. Employees here know their jobs well and are very, very friendly. There were a couple of birthday celebrations on that day and the entire staff sang a cute little song to the people who were celebrating, after which I made a mental note to bring my sister here for her birthday in March. We left Quest that day with full stomachs and happy hearts, only waiting for opportunities to visit again.

It defines out of the way food for fellow Calcuttans who are usually limited to Indian and Chinese cuisines... The food here is delicious... They're not spiced up and 'Indianised' like every other Indian restaurant... They're just perfect... The waiters are friendly and guide the first timers with honest suggestions...  The only thing that bothers me the variety of dishes... U go through the menu and everything looks so mouth watering but u have to order only one... The beef tenderloin is my personal favourite... Its juicy, tender and remember to order for medium rare(That's what I think is balanced, not too chewy or hard, neither too raw...)...If ur a fan of fishes... Be sure to try out the Blackened Salmon... You'll also have lots of options to choose from when ordering alcoholic or nonalcoholic drinks...

I went there for the second time today. My first experience was not very good. But now that they have changed the menu its a much better experience.
Veg starters platter- We had Texas poppers,  veg rolls and a paneer roll kind of thing. It was nice.
Queso- Its like cheese fondue with tortilla chips and spinach and cheese dip. The dip was a bit salty.
Margarita Flat bread pizza- It was pretty tasty.
Quesdillas- It was nice but nothing extraordinary.
5 cheese pizza- Very average. Won't recommend it. Other dishes were much better.

I visited the place two days back. This was my 2nd time. Well the staffs are friendly. Food is as usual maintaining it's quality. But the glasses they provide are disgusting. I can't even call it a proper glass in a restaurant like chilis.

1 Calamari,1 smoky chicken fajita,1 crispy chicken Taco along with some walker with a stick.This was chillis for us.Ambiance was perfect,great dining experience.
We started with Calamari.Crispy and perfectly cooked.Quantity was more than sufficient.However I like Teriyaki batter more than this one.Reminded me of Goa.Followed by Calamari we ordered a Fajita.
Tortilla is a strange stuff.In Arabia people call it Kubbus. Any Turkish kubbu wrap with lots of homus,tabouli and other fresh salads and smoked chicken tastes lot better than any Mexican Fajita.So Fajita did not do surprisingly well for me.Mexico lost to Turkey big time.But with respect to Chillis it was perfect.You cannot prepare a better Fajita.It was time for Crispy Chicken Taco.Good one but again,Tacos are good but Pitas are great.So Mexico lost to Portuguese big time.Given a choice I will consume 2 Pitas than a Taco.Overall I like Mexican stuff because It plays good with Indian taste buds but you know the world is a better place to live with Italy,Turkey,Portugal and Indian foods around.If you give me a choice between 1)Nandos,2)Mocambo 3)Chillis and 4)A combo of a Turkish Kebab center along with a beer bar, I will pick the fourth.However ,Chillis - overall was awesome and definitely worth visiting repeatedly.Have lot to explore and too early to review though.

First i must admit that it quite a well designed....had ordered fr steak...medium rare...now no issues with the presentation but a medium rare steak that was a bit tough and raw at places wasn't something i was expecting...though the other dishes were really good....

Her warm, sweet smile welcomed me, making me feel good as I allowed the weight of my frame to create it's own contour on the red leathered upholstery! 
"Yes sir, we do have the drink you asked for. My colleague was not aware of the same; I apologise for that". Already Chilli's had begun to make me feel good by the hospitality of its staff. 
As I settled down after requesting that the TV on the wall opposite me be tuned to beam the latest ISL match, I knew I would definitely like Chilli's!
Chilli's is  huge; it has tables to seat groups of different sizes all around  the room. As the hour progressed, it buzzed with activity and reverberated with sounds of friends' banter. Bounded by glass walls on both sides it offers the diners the option to make outsiders  feel jealous by displaying what they eat or displaying their happiness quotient! 
As regards food, the prices are cheap and there's plenty of options in form of  burgers and pizzas for  vegetarians as well as non vegetarians. The fries however were a little oily and the dips, I felt, a little too sour for my taste. 
As I walked out of the place, I wondered if there was another place in Kolkata which could pose a challenge and lure the clients away from Chilli's.  The thought of Mezzuna came to my mind and with it my mind begun to make a mental comparison of the two places! Both places were lounge bars, meant for groups of friends to meet, sip, gossip and bite into bits of food. So which was better? Mezzuna was much classier in terms of its ambience, comfortable seating structure and better quality of food. But prices of food at Chilli's was probably cheaper, it stocked my favourite Bacardi black rum and scored high on the capability quotient of its serving staff. And, most importantly for me, it had the lady with the charming smile!

This place has redefined the taste buds. Food is excellent, staff are friendly and cordial. 
They offer 1:1 on Domestic liquor and 2:1 on Foreign liquor on weekdays, 4 -8pm, which let's you go easy on your wallet.
This is a place you must go to, for mouth watering food. 
The quantity they serve is great, so order one at a go. 
I ll sure visit again. 
Special thanks to Iqbal, the person who attended us to make the evening special indeed.

How do you review different outlets of a franchise which seem to be absolutely the same everywhere in the country. Well I'll give it a try. For starters, this place is exactly as good as the one I've been to in Pune. Really great place to go out to for a drink. Well, I visited this one on a Saturday evening, with a friend. It was full, so they offered us seats at the bar counter, which we were delighted with. I've had drinks at a bar counter many a times before, but this time it was way more awesome because they had five screens, playing 3 live soccer matches simultaneously, two of them being EPL games. Not to mention the fact that at the counter the service is practically the best. The burgers , the fajita & the drinks all were great. The only downside to the evening was that the bartender convinced me try Ballantine's as it was on offer. Well, to my disappointment I found that no matter how much 'Harvey Specter' endorses it, it just doesn't taste right. Jokes apart, A perfect place to chill out and grab a weekend drink.

Been there before, and it was an absolute delight then. Amazing quantity, and an equally amazing taste. It had been an all time favourite of mine until yesterday. The quality of food has reached an all time low.
For starters we had their new veg triple dipper in which u get to choose 3 items out of 5. We chose cheesy pop, cottage cheese crisper and qusa bite. Qusa bite was like a road side cutlet (except that a road side cutlet will have more filling), cottage cheese crisper had a pungent smell; and seemed to be straight out of gutter. On complaining, we were served additional cheese pops. The oil in the cheese pop complemented the pop as a rosogolla's ras would (The image shows the oil content from one pop).
We moved on to the main course for which we ordered a grilled chicken burger, smoked veg burger and a veg quasedilla. The chicken patty, though soft, was dry and chewy. One good thing about the quasedilla was that it was loaded with cheese but hardly had any paneer. The fries served along with the burgers was thankfully not oily as the starters.
We also had a couple of drinks, the mojito and the mixed fruit smoothie. Those were the best among others.
Even though we had a bad experience in terms of food, got to make a special mention of the service and staff. They were very welcoming, friendly and prompt. But would I want to go back for the friendly staff or the food?
P.S they do not have a physical feedback form (their reason - "because Chilis is an American brand and none of the American restaurants don't")

I loved this place every time I walked in. Specially the chicken crispers with the corn on the cob with ice tea. I did enjoy their T-bone steaks and done Mexican dishes as well. Perfect American meal is what you can expect out of this place. This is still s little formal in nature than what I noticed in Chicago , where chilis is a very chilled out casual place . Overall a big hit in kolkata !

Went there during pujas.We ordered for tripple dipper,blackened fish,tortilla crusted chicken,grilled chicken burgers and margaritas. Tripple dipper had 3 diff types of chicken served in a basket with various sauces. Blackened fish had grilled fish fillet served with rice and veggies. Grilled chicken burgers were huge stuffed with chicken,bacon,lettuce,tomato etc.
Out of all these, I found the tripple dipper better than the rest.
In margaritas I have heard a lot about President margarita before going there but I personally found Water melon margarita better than President margarita.
Ambiance was really good filled with good music.
When it comes to pocket, this place is quite expensive in terms of quantity and quality.
Only this much of orders for 4 of us cost us 900 rs each.

Heard a lot about its american/mexican delicacies and it will nowhere dissapoint you for sure.The prices are on the higher side but it's definitely worth a try.We  had Buffalo steak and triple fajito with buffalo,chicken and shrimps.Both the dishes were excellent.The sauce provided with the buffalo steak was yummy.If you want to get a feel of proper American meal in Kolkata,there is no better place than Chilli's.Also heard a lot about its drinks, especially the cocktails.Next time I'm definitely going to try some of them.

It was always favorite when I was in Houston,Texas...its basically Texan cuisine and almost loved all of the listed items. Items are unique in its nature and preparation is just Mind-blowing. 
Now in India they maintained the same quality but somehow I felt the dishes are more spicy...I have tested chicken wings as starter and Chicken crisper as main dish. All are awesome...also a very positive environment is maintained with smart staffs. Will visit again..

Its like a sudden rush of adrenaline in your body as soon as their food hits your taste buds. Words are too less to describe the awesomeness they have put into their food. My all time favorite will always be tripple dipper. Chilli's is like a diamond in a gold mine. The menu almost anything one would crave from an American joint. Popularly known as an American dhaba in Indian style, this place will just not disappoint you rather will provoke you come back again and again. Oh! And if there is a birthday celebration just let them know and leave it upto them abd wait for the surprise!

Previously I had visited the other outlet at South City. This outlet at Quest Mall is a bit spacious, with great decoration and ambience. We ordered Blackened Salmon, Tortilla crusted chicken, Chipotle pesto chicken pasta (we chose spaghetti in white sauce). The fish was delicious and so was the pasta. But i was slightly dissatisfied with the tortilla crusted chicken, as the chicken was a bit harder than the other chicken dishes. But overall our lunch was a lip-smacking one.
I would strongly recommend the salmon, pasta and fresh mex rice bowls to everyone. Waiting eagerly for my next visit.

True American Style food - Texan actually ( Texas) 
The atmosphere was pretty good but pretty over-crowded , interesting to find Water or any Aerated drinks served in Beer mugs .
The ' Cheese Poppers  ' were pretty good  - perfect amount of Cheese and herbs, Pasta was definitely not amongst the best ones tasted till date - felt it should have been a lityle spicy atleast . Also , the Chicken Fritters were good - the coating was crispy but the chicken ; wish it had some herbs or spice in it 
Overall - was okay : maybe not the 'perfect day'.
But I am so gonna visit it again 
( Ohhh , and not to forget the corn and french fries as sides were good :p , and the dip to go with the cheese poppers were excellent)

To be very honest with you all, after a long time i found a place in kolkata which is worth a mention time n again. Otherwise kolkata lacked that concept of new age restaurants and we were left to all those age old places where even out great grandfathers had dined. To start off i would say that this place is something qhich u might miss out as a normal eating joint inside a mall and that too amongst the food court. As u rise on to the 4th floor and take a left turn past Inox,u can see wooden tables laid out and people enjoying their drink in exxxxxtraa large glasses with mouth watering burgers and fries and toritillas and nachos...... The list would go on. The first time i visited this place and ordered a Margherita, i was awestruck by the sheer size of the glass. I mean u could just have a Margherita and that would b enough for your dinner. We hav ordered burgers, nachos,toritillas, chikn wings, and what not and everytime they hav surprised us with the taste. 
One very imp aspect they hav taken care is suppose u get a imp call and u need a absolutely calm place to talk-simply head to the washroom, turn off the speakers inside and the person at the other end would feel that u r at your workplace. 
During my last visit wen we ordered a portion of chikn wings and to out surprise they didnt taste well,we called the waiter and he happily accepted to replace it with another portion as per our taste buds. 
They hav the American concept of having unlimited Coke at 99bucks and thats another thumps up to them. I could keep on writing but would continue on my next review. Stay tuned.

Nearly redundant are the reviews that spring up for a place that has already seated itself in the hearts of many and earned a name for itself. Like Chili's. Nevertheless, as a foodie, you cannot help but write about some place you visited for the first time.¬†

TexMex food is becoming a trend now in Kolkata, thanks to this establishment. And why not? I have been to TGIF, New Delhi a number of times, so I am pretty familiar with this cuisine. My first visit to Chili's was during this Durga Puja and I departed with a smile on my face. This is just a short review as we didn't order much, just a classic. Don't look at the content of the review, just mind the intention (which is heaps of praise).

Straight to business!! Two shots of tequila and then we only ordered the half rack of baby back ribs with classic BBQ sauce, served with fries. Glazed beautifully, really tender meat coming off the ribs nicely and effortlessly. Prepared so uniformly. Not the slightest flaw in the preparation.¬†

Tends to instantaneous service by really friendly, courteous and knowledgeable waiters amidst a good ambience.

Cheers!!

Ah well this place is already famous for me to post any reviews. Nevertheless I would like to mention few things I liked. The guys take orders almost kneeling down so that they can hear the patrons clearly. From the Menu I tasted Tripple Deeper and  Roasted Red Pepper Chicken. Both tasted delicious & was feeling as well.  Both dishes were served with fantastic deeps. The ambience is similar to other Chili's outlets. Next time I need to try the alcohols.

A comfortable and relaxing place to meet up with friends. The food although expensive is tasty and the very fact that it is one of the few restaurants in Kolkata that has tried to bring about the flavor of American diners, it is a refreshing place to go on a particular occasion. The pizzas are the high points of the entire menu. While, the squid is not too shabby either. The service is a bit blotched, simply because the crowd tends to be massive at times. Do try the pizza over all the dishes if you are bent upon visiting this place.

It was my first visit here and quite impressed with the overall experience. We had Tripple Dippers and it was awesome starter to start with. Very fresh one something very unique in Chillies.
In main course we had Smoky Chipotle Chicken Fajita. Now one was very interesting full course meal, sufficient for 2 person. Smoky chicken with tortillas were a nice mouthwatering Mexican delicacy. Along with two mocktails we completed there. Unfortunately it was dry day so couldn't explore that section but felt like for non alcoholic beverages their should expand a bit more. But overall nice experience, good staff, very much chillies hospitality. Thanks.

Their beverages were awesome,we took the the watermelon flavor,couldn't remember the name.but it's so refreshing.After that we ordered tripple dipper, tortilla crusted chicken,both the items were superb!

Coming to staff management, they were very cooperative and tried their best to take care of their customers.

So if you haven't tried this place yet , then don't waste your time and go there asap...Highly recommended!

Was eagerly waiting to visit this place. I realized my wait was worthwhile. An excellent food fiesta on an asthami night. Beef fajitas, Orleans jambalaya and tacos. Just yumm. Only downside was probably our server. He seriously lacked communication skills. But no complaints as the food satisfied very much everything.

I have been quite regular to Chili's, but am writing this review quite late. The food in Chili's is amazing, I love their Chicken Wings, Burgers and One of my favourite dishes is Tortila Crusted Chicken which is served on a bed of rice with broccoli. 
I just love one of their dessert, which is Chocolate Truffle Cheesecake, it's to die for. I get craving to eat it so often. The staff is really courteous and very active! 
Without doubt it's one of my favourites and would keep visiting till reach the saturation level

Finally made it to chili's which was long on my wishlist. But I must say its not at all overhyped and the food is just lip smacking.
Coming to food,the chicken mushroom soup with its slight tangy flavour was the best I have tasted in kolkata and I have tasted a lot.
Tripple dipper was again such an amazing dish that will surely rejuvenate your taste buds.
In the main course we ordered chipotle pesto chicken pasta in white sauce which was quite fulfilling.Some more garlic breads would have been better though.
The dessert section was limted. We ordered a cheese cake and molten chocolate cake which were again great to taste.
The bill made a little hole in the pocket but I think that's worth it.

Cheers and happy pujo to all my zomato friends :)

Now many of you might think of this place to be extremely posh and expensive, but believe me, in spite of the steep prices, the platter is quite fulfilling if you choose wisely and correctly. 

Welcome to Chili's. 

As usual, here is my list of its KEY FEATURES: 

1. Quality of Food: Tender and Delicate. We had ordered Triple Dipper which is "you-can-sort-of-say" a Chili's specialty, and being on a hungry stomach, those crispy bites were more than amazing.

2. Desserts: Paradise Cream Brownie - true to it's name, it was the perfect sweet ending after the spicy nachos and tacos.

3. Variety: From Mexican to Sea food, you will be in for a joyful gulping of nachos, tacos and pastas.

4. Ambience: Proper. Neither too soft nor too loud. If you manage to get a window seat, be sure to gaze across the busiest seven-point crossing of Park Circus. 

5. Service: Professional and Polite. Fast service. 

Some of the other special features include:

1. Drinks: Try any of the Margaritas, it would surely blow you away to a new kind of freshness.

2. Desserts: If I had taken this earlier, I would have cancelled my original snacks dish and ordered two plates of Brownies only. An absolute delicacy.

3. Location: An apt location, with plenty of transportation available (thanks to the Park Circus crossing)

A few factors which might compromise the above:

1. Price: For a middle class family, this might just be the only and large barrier towards a filling meal. The price IS a bit steep in my opinion, however, it is compensated with the variety and quality of the dishes.

2. Quantity: At first,I was skeptic if I could fill my full with just one dish. However, the quantity was just abut sufficient to make me burp. However, it depends from person to person and might vary a tad bit.

.  

Ratings: 

1. Quality: 4.5/5

2. Quantity: 4/5

3. Ambience: 4/5

4. Variety: 4/5

5. Price: 3/5

6. Availability: 4/5

7. Location: 4/5

Well, its a mixed experience.
For the brighter part, the food is AWESOME. No compromise with the quality of food.
For the second part, service lacks a proper backbone. But the thing is, they DO complement for their technical faults.
All in all, it was really good.
Looking forward to more visits.

Had just 45 mins approx, to catch up for a movie at Quest. and Chili's being one of the my most favorite restaurants decided to give it a visit once again !!

As always an electric atmosphere and ever attentive staff greeted us two, to a nice little place at the corner. Had to resist the urge of trying a cocktail as I had to watch a movie after that, and I am generally not done with only 1 of them, and also resisted bacon/beef/hamburger owing to some personal issues had to be content with :

1. Fish & Chips: My all time favorite.. For a typical Bengali, the fish might not be made of "Bengal Bhetki" per se, yet the creamy, juicy deep fried stuff along with the french fries was absolute heaven. I pity my girl who like fish to be missing out on something as delicious as this.

2. Grilled Chicken Burger: As I was gorging on my fish & chips, I couldn't help but notice, the Cadbury Silk type expression on her face when she was having this. To be honest "foodgasm" !! :) :)

¬†Although the fries with it, is a ¬†bit too much for two people to complete and moreover it was not perfectly fried, but still we did manage to wipe out almost 60% of it.

Again would visit soon, and try to experiment more. Probably a three course meal.¬†

P.S: Do not let your quality, quantity and your standards down. People are visiting, but please do not take them for granted. Its excellent till date, please maintain that !! :) :)

Not only food but ratings are given on various parameters like ambience, behavioral attitudes of waiters and waitresses etc etc.
And I must say Chili's have done very well in it's test. :-D
Anyway, this restaurant is situated on the 4th floor of Quest Indulge.
We had a warm welcome by the receptionist.
In food we ordered Pepperoni Pizza, Southwest veg pizza and chicken wings. And I like the appetizer more.
In cocktail we ordered Manhattan, Mandrin Blush and Long Island Ice tea and they are all good.
Atlast we ordered 3 pints of beers viz. Carlsberg, Tuborg and Miller.
It was a great experience. Really some restaurant must took lessons from this type of restaurants. Hope to visit soon.

Chili's is a favorite haunt whenever I go shopping at Quest. Have tried almost everything on their menu. Mexican fare is very, very good.

At times, they have Happy Hours from 4 pm - 8 pm with 1+1 drinks.

Love their country fried calamari (best thing on their menu!!), chicken wings, boneless chicken wings tossed in tangy wing sauce, southwestern egg rolls, and entire assortment of fajitas, (pronounced fuh-hee-taas, and not fudge-eetas) especially Fajita Trio.

Their chili is good, so are the chicken crispers. Orleans Jambalaya is a good option for people who need a little bit of rice in their meal. It's topped with juicy prawns. Fish and chips isn't that great and neither is the fresh lime soda - avoid!

All margaritas are made well and come in these huge beer mugs. Prices are on the higher side and food service is quick.

Usually packed on weekends, so book a table beforehand unless you are alright with the 15-30 mins wait.

I'll give a 5 for this Chili. 

Staff very courteous, friendly, suggests good food and serving with a smile.

I was having an issue with a fall in blood sugar and these guys served me some food in 5 minutes max. I just loved the gesture.

We were 9 people. Ordering was super fast. Food delivery was even faster. And we could wash down the tenderloin with beer and / cocktails.

Overall every one in the group enjoyed the experience. Every small action and item added up to make me give a 5 star.

You should definitely try the meat platter....I forgot the name :-(

If you are hungry and really want to fill up your tummy then you need to go to this outlet.Had sandwiches¬† and deserts after my office and it was value for money.Chicken sandwich came with thick pieces of tender chicken and more finger chips than I and my friend could eat.The desert i.e some choco lava cake with ice cream on it makes you close your eyes when you put it in your¬† mouth.Outing with friends can be best at this place which made us visit this outlet twice in a month.

This place is a real spoil sport. Once you come here. You will always feel like coming here. You try a different restaurant then you will get 90% satisfaction and 10% dissatisfaction. Why? Because in your mind you will say "Had I been in Chili's then I would have had that dish...". Such top class quality of Food and Service shows a really good example of what a perfect restaurant should be like.

I went to this branch of Chili's on a Sunday afternoon along with my 5 friends. I really like Chili's and its ambience which is in sync with their other outlets to which I have been.

This is just beside the food court of Quest Mall (4th Floor) and to you left is the bar and sitting arrangement is mostly on the right though their are 3-4 tables along the bar also. We opted for the left side which is less crowded.

The ambience and decor is quite good and lively as is their other outlets. Nice music was playing and staffs were prompt, suggestive and cordial.

We following was ordered

Draught Beer Pitcher
Vodka Shots
J√§gerbomb (of which I am a big fan)
Roasted Red Pepper Chicken
Tortilla Crusted Chicken
Fajita Trio (buffalo, grilled shrimp and marinated grilled chicken)
Tripple Dippers
Grilled Chicken + Smashed Potato with Gravy and seasonal vegetables.

It was quite an ensemble of food and though the price was on the higher side with taxes and all but taste wise its awesome and you can easily go ahead and say the best available Mexican food in Kolkata.

The sole motive of coming here was to enjoy the Corona bucket that was on offer that day. 4 pints @ 1000 bucks. A real deal. 

Along with the chilled beer, we ordered ourselves quite an ensemble of food. Some beef burgers, pizza, some starters, if I recall correctly, quessidilla too. The service was quick and prompt and the waiters were helpful. 

The ambiance was good and quite lively. In fact, we found another IIM C group just beside us. The place could have been a little better with some good music. 

All in all, unlike us, do go there to try out the Mexican dishes!

Chilli's is a great place for Mexican cuisine. be it Tortilla chips or Fajitas you ought to love this place. In fact, it's one of its kind in Kolkata. The one at Quest Mall is spacious with perfect ambience. The staff is extremely courteous and know their jobs well. This place has perfect lighting and a beautiful view from the 4th floor. Coming to food, they are delicious and contains low fat. Take my tandoori burger for example, it contains no cheese or mayonnaise. Most stuff is covered in sauce and a little spicy. Also, the beverages are great. I absolutely loved this place.

I had much expectations from this place. But, things fell short somewhere down the line.

Service - 3/5 Service was fast, waiters courteous enough; Having said so, I would have expected the waiters to ask if I needed something else from time to time. Instead, I had to look for them and call them to my table.

Sitting - 1/5 They need to ask themselves if the seats meant for 6 people can actually fit 6 comfortably in. When people are paying a premium price, they expect these things to be taken care of well. We were 5 and we literally struggled to fit 3 of us on one side. Leave alone the pains when the rest 2 have to get out and give way when the 3rd guy wants to go out for a call. I feel they crunched up the space so that they could fit more people in. That's wrong and is a bad experience for certain.

Food - 4/5 Presentation and food were pretty good. Although, there are numerous places for improvement, still they deserve a 4 coz the fish, chicken and every other stuff were cooked to be juicy and were melting in my mouth.

Cost - 2/5 For the price you pay, you would definitely expect a lot more. To start with, a good sitting place and a li'll better service.

Ambience - 3/5 Nothing that special. Most American Restro-Pubs offer you the same flavor.

Well partly, because of a more formal company, I couldn't explore it that well. So, I will definitely visit this place next time.

Thumbs up for it's cheerful ambience, which makes it perfect for a hangout with friends. This time, we started off with Country Fried Calamari, and I must say, it was AMAZING! Who cares about it being deep fried when you are having a taste of heaven! :D Must try for all! Next, we ordered the Triple Dipper, which is a combo of three appetizers, Chicken Crispers, Chicken Wings and Southwestern Eggrolls. The Chicken Crispers are my personal favorite, but I simply loved the tanginess of the Chicken Wings as well! This is a place you can visit again and again, and find a new foodgasm-worthy dish each time!

What I'm going to write might shock all of you. 
I was here with my family and was shocked to see a metal screw in my food. 
I asked the manager and he was eager to replace and take no money for the food we had. 
I opposed and asked him for the standards they follow. They said that they will fire the guy who made it. But how will that work. 
They never replied back to my email and due to my job I didn't get much time to follow up. But I'm coming back to India will make sure they learn it the hard way that Indians are not to be taken granted for. 
Will add pictures and the details once I get back home.

Food tastes even tastier when it is bought with one's hard earned money. This was exactly the case when me and my friends decided to visit Chilli's. 
Just a glance at the comfy decorations is enough to fall in love with this place. The food is just an added bonus. The Southwestern Chicken Pasta just melts in your mouth amd the taste of it lingers on till very late. ;) The Quesadillas are awesome and the whole food washes down well with huge mugs of beer. 
The staff is very customer friendly. An amazing expirience.

Chilli's is creating a lot of buzz these days in the city and it's all worth. The decor, the food or the service everything actually do justice to what people say. Had a perfect Sunday lunch today. Started with the Triple dipper and the southern style egg roll and chicken crispers are the winners there. The roasted red pepper chicken was delicious and perfectly cooked with a tasty sauce dip. Though the rice could have been better. Finished with the most popular dessert of the place the molten chocolate cake which tasted like drops of heaven. And not to forget the drinks, the lemon margarita and the strawberry lemonade both deserve a thumbs up. Will visit soon. Again.

2.5 is because of the service & ambience. I along with my wife been to this joint at quest mall. I was thinking that my evening is made. I will have my fav continental cuisines. The starters were so bad that after a few bites, I was done. I ordered southeastern eggroll. So salty it was that a person having normal blood pressure will have bp the next day. My wife was having vegetarian so thought of trying from there, she ordered Classical natchos.. God!! It was awful..then I started eating my main course blackened salmon.. It was so so, but some part of the fish had bitter taste.. So I called the service guy, asked him why is it tasting bitter. The answer he gave was salmon tastes little bitter & they have grilled. The poor guy thought or rather underestimated me probably.. I have lived on salmon for many years.. Anyways then I enquired my wife about her main course, she ordered pasta with mushroom & steamed broccoli.. Her answer was in this joint only the beer is good. I then got French fries, 1 of the worst fries.. Foodwise this joint is big zero from me.. By the way, the bill has service charge & some tax on it.. Recently saw the campaign on service charge on tv, thinking to expose it on the tv..

If you ever wish for an experience larger than life then this is it ! The ultimate TexMex style restaurant of Kolkata ! 
We visited Chili's just the day after Eid . The waiting time was merely 15 minutes . Staffs were courteous enough to take us to our table . 
Then came the blazing quick service for what Chilli's is known for ! 
We started off with Classic Nachos . It was a mindblowing start as the portion's were big !
Then came 'Smoky Chipotle Chicken Fajitas'with complimentary Tortillas . Yes - you heard it right the Tortillas were complimentary ! The dish was fantastic to say the least . The chicken was juicy while the calamari was fresh ! 
We complimented it with non-alchoholic mocktails which came in giant over -sized glasses ; the signature Texas style !
The service was super quick as food arrived almost in 10 minutes from the order . 
Perhaps a bit of personal touch and a bit more care towards the customer would have made my rating 5/5 easily . 
The experience was superb but not unforgettable :) .

This is like coming home after a long day. Chili's had been my constant companion in Delhi whenever I had a craving for a good burger or just wanted to gossip with my girlfriends over their amazing cocktails and finger foods and it has continued to be that in Kolkata. The food remains as hearty and lovely as ever, the staff is wonderful and it has been a part of my every visit to Quest. For beginners do try their country fried chicken, old timer burger, any of their salads (all of them being fabulous) and my personal favourite the Calamari basket.

Chili's. 
This is THE BEST restaurant in Kolkata. 
A tex-mex chain, it offers American food in huge portions without compromising on taste. 
I have visited this restaurant over a dozen times and each time the food has been equally good. The servers are polite, friendly and very helpful. 
Coming to the food. 
The triple dipper: Hot wings, egg rolls and chicken crispers. Best appetiser to start with. 
Country fried chicken: Name says it all. Even corn on the cob side dish is delish. 
Deep fried calamaris: deep fried squid. To die for. 
New Orleans jambalaya: A dish with rice, shrimps, veggies in a tangy sauce. Really tasty.
Blackened fish: Never had fish softer than this.
Buffalo burgers sliders: cooked to perfection
Tortilla crusted chicken: Comes with a side of rice. Heavenly. 
Dessert: Each and every dessert is amazing. I especially love the cheesecake. To die for. 
Looking forward to the next trip. 
A foodie's paradise

I had recently visited Chili's, which is located in Quest Mall. Located in the top most floor of the mall, this restaurant has a superb elite ambience with a separate Bar inside.

Coming over to the food, we had ordered Chicken Wings, for our starter. The Chicken wings platter has 10 small pieces of chicken winglets, served with red tangy sauce and a ranch dressing. I was very disappointed with this item, as Chicken Wings is supposed to be crispy and crunchy. But the Chicken pieces, although warm, lacked the crispy feel.
For the main course, we wanted to try Fajitas and Quesadillas. So we ordered a plate of Chicken Fajita Quesadilla. The dish was accompanied with sour cream, rice with beans, house made pico de gallo and a sauce(most probably it was chipotle sauce), The Quesadilla was delicious and different, the filling inside had generous amounts of cheese and chicken. The tortilla was soft to eat, easy to bite. Unfortunately, the rice with beans did not go very well with the quesadilla.
To end it up on a sweet note, we went for Molten Chocolate Cake. This Cake was superb, both in presentation and in taste. It is basically a choco fudge cake, in triangular shape, topped with vanilla ice cream, shelled by a Chocolate layer. It is a must try for the sweet tooths visiting this restaurant.

The service was quick and prompt, but the sad part is that they charge huge tax for the items, It is a good place to visit, if you want to try continental cuisine or want to try margeritas/drinks, as they have a good variety of drinks to offer.

Recently visited this outlet again and this time we ordered a plateful of Country Fried Chicken. The dish consisted of a piece of fried Chicken, sweet corn, a slice of garlic bread and mashed potatoes, topped with Cheese. It was delightful to taste. The Chicken was crunchy. as the name suggested and had a Cheese filling. The Sweet corn was roasted properly and was sprinkled with black pepper, when served. The Garlic Bread also tasted good. This restaurant never fails to satisfy my tastebuds. Good work guys!!

Let's start from Ambience- Soothing and Chilling which is best to chillax with friends and Family far from work and stress sharing few drinks and snacks. We munched over Quessedillas,  white sauce pasta and Long Island Ice Tea. All over the experience in the Mexican Hub was Good. Waiters were friendly and jolly which takes 4star from my side. The backdrops are they have very less items for Vegans and their different taxes on the bill which is huge half of the amount consumed of the items. For fridays and Saturdays Chilli's is one of the best destination in Town.

I went to this branch of Chili's in June. It was a pleasant experience with some mild hiccups. 

the ambiance in this place is nice. with a good view of the outside, but the day i went it was pretty cloudy and it was raining a bit so that dampened the view a little. The service was ok-ish. Not anything that can be bragged about, details of which will follow.

Now coming to the food....

When we went there, a very good offer was going on that if you buy 2 Presidente Margaritas you get another for free. So we took advantage of the offer.

We also ordered Fajita Trio, Chicken Kicked-up Quesadillas, Pepperoni pizza and choco truffle cheese cake.

The food was not bad.. I really liked the fajita trio where you make your own fajitas with the stir fried meats and veggies. The Pepperoni Pizza was rather disappointing. the choco truffle cheese cake was a good experience.

Now the service i did not like that much. It was kind of sloppy and slow. Then when we got the bill i was a bit surprised that it was so much but then we thought that we must have order so much & we checked all the names of the orders and they were correct.  So a little dumbfounded we paid and went out.

But then after like 5 minutes one of us realized that they had charged us for 3 margaritas whereas one was supposed to be free (increasing the bill by almost 500) !!! We went back and told the staff about it .. they just paid us back the printed price of the margarita. They did not redo the bill. Hence they just ripped us off by pocketing the extra tax/service charge etc that was calculated based on the extra amount. So that was unpleasant. 

So in conclusion 

Food: 4.5

Ambiance:3.5

Service: 2

Maybe my next visit will be perfect.. Looking forward to that. 

P.S. The glasses they give water in are really awesome !

One of the best place to be.They serve some of the world's best dishes.A completely different experience for me..very different cuisine, something that we usually don't get here and of course with world class taste.We ordered for Pacific blue margarita, Pomegranate margarita, Triple dipper, Taco pizza and Fajita Quesadillas. All the items were excellent in taste but I still think they could improve on the pizza. The staffs are very courteous. Very good ambience. A nice place to sit and gossip while enjoying your food. I would have loved to give a 5 but I am taking 0.5 out of it because of 2 reasons. Firstly its not at all pocket friendly. I didn't understand what for so many variety of taxes were deducted - 5 taxes they included don't what were they for. And secondly, the staff did not serve the food and yes they could have given a bigger dish to eat..small snacks dishes were given with only fork and knife to have your food..no spoonüòû
Inspite of all these small factors still I would like to visit this place again to try out their dishes but this time South City outlet to avoid the unnecessary taxes.

I almost waited for a year n at last yesterday my wish was complete to eat here. We started of with the triple dipper which consisted of chicken wings which i didnt liked mch as it was a bit salty,whereas the southern rolls n crispy chicken were really good. The chicken ranch burger n fries were good too but there was lack of sauce in the burger n a masala lemonade n whisky in drinks. Then we had the chocolate truffle dessert which was the best part in the whole meal, the dessrt consisted  rum which enhanced d flavour more.

Of you are planning for a group outing with friends,then this is quite the place for you. However it's a place for couples if they are looking forward to spend a quiet romantic evening.
Their dishes were GOOD. But there is still the room to be better. I am saying this as I had ordered 3 dishes out of which I liked 2 of them. 
 I didn't quite like their Tacos. They served a preparation of rice and dal along with it which nearly killed my appetite.  However I liked their chicken wings and their non-vegeterian quesadillas. They were good both in taste and in quantity. The flavoured was amazing,so were the dips.
Their Margarita's are worth mentioning. They have a huge menu for margarita's and I tried Margarita President√©. It was amazing.

Chili's never disappoints me and I'm sure, others. The Chili's on the 4th floor of Quest mall has a great ambience. The food is delicious and  the drinks are great. You can order individual drinks or a pitcher for al your friends and family. They have a huge menu to choose from which ranges from veg to non veg items. They have great stakes as well ( which I have heard but never tasted). I will not specify what is good and what I like best because every time I go I try something new and trust me each and every dish is worth trying. I definitely recommend it.

- BBQ ranch burger - A tad undercooked. But it was too minimal to create a fuss about. Crunchy fries went along perfectly with it.
- Cheesecake - Brillante!!! Was absolutely brilliant. One of the best I have had around here. A real treat.

Chilli's is one of its kind in Calcutta. There are not many restaurants offering genuine Tex Mex food. The ambience is quite fun like and sporty. The service levels are excellent and time to serve is also very good. Coming to the food, there is a good variety to chose from in terms of taccos, nachos, burgers and bitings. As starters, do try out the Chese nachos and Chicken wings. There are a couple of fries like chicken fingers and prawns, but these are pretty standard dishes. Main course has some pork ribs, steak and stuffed chicken platters to chose from. The chillers are ok. Deserts are fewer to chose from but are delicious. Some chocolate and brownie based deserts will be good to try out. Overall Chilli's provide you with a good option if you want to have a biting and munching kinda meal in mind and want to spend some quality time alongwith friends for an early afternoon Sunday lunch.

Good food, good staff, good drinks.

That really sums up my experience at the Chilli's in Quest Mall.¬†

It's surprising since I've never really been a fan of the Tex-Mex chain, after a harrowing O'Hare Airport experience in 2012.¬†

I ordered a beer from their beer list (which is pretty stacked for Kolkata standards) and a bacon buffalo burger. I'd not eaten buffalo meat prior to this experience, and was surprised to learn that Chilli's doesn't use beef in their burgers (well, at least this Chilli's location.)

The burger was exactly how I wanted it: juicy, succulent, flavorsome (or in other words: medium well.) The bacon was a delicious add-on. I could have done without the lettuce and tomatoes, but that's only a small critique.¬†

I'll definitely be returning for whenever I'm craving some buffalo meat! Also, I do want to try out their Tex-Mex fare and their Happy Hour.

I went to this place with my wife and daughter on a Sunday night. This was my wife's birthday and I wanted to give her a treat. While I don't regret visiting this restaurant, my experience however had not been a memorable one. I somewhat got a feel that the place is living on a hype and you should not visit with an expectation of¬†a fine dining experience. Let me come to the positives first. The ambience is pretty nice and vibrant. We ordered non-alcoholic drinks and their mojitos and shake with molten chocolate chunks were decent. The citrus chicken and shrimp fajita was good but not extra-ordinary. However, the desert - molten chocolate cake deserves a special mention. Now comes the bitter part - service. I understand it was a crowed Sunday night but it seemed that a bunch of waiters (with red¬†tees) had very little coordination or professional skill to serve the customers. First, upon arrival I gently mentioned that one of the guests has birthday and the waiter simply nodded and uttered "oh yeah, birthday !" After that I did not hear a single word on whether I would like any arrangement etc. Second, we had to ask for basic things such as paper tissues. Since we were three, along with the fajita only three tortilla breads arrived and nobody bothered to ask if more bread is necessary (I am not sure if the no of breads¬†is fixed per plate or just determined on the no of people sharing the dish). Overall, the service was indifferent and lacked¬†professionalism. I find here many¬†reviews and ratings that hinge upon the¬†friendly stuff ¬†but certainly my experience had been otherwise. May be it's a good place for couple of drinks with some food but not recommended for a good dining experience.

Some of the dishes they serve is truly world class and live up to their name. But the quantity of food they serve is not satisfactory. Compared to the price they charge and the service tax they extract out of our pocket, the quantity definitely should be more. 
I recommend their queso , orleans jumbalaya and fried calamari rings.

The triple dipper being a classic favourite..the burgers and tachos are the ones to die for..not to mention the beautifully combined meat and fish dishes that come with complementary rice or mashed potatoes..the desserts are also one of their kind..though on d last visit I was not much impressed with the cheesecake..on enquiring the staff serving at our table confessed that the traditional mascerpone cheese is not used..and hence it is not as soft and melt in the mouth as it usually is..anyway..a crime confessed is a crime forgiven.. ;) moreover i was more than glad to find an attached smoking room which i hadnt known earlier..overall I have no complains and would love to visit again as soon as I get an opportunity..cheers!!!

First and foremost, those expecting a gourmet experience are living in a fool's paradise. Chili's, across the world, is a watering hole that serves what can generously be called 'sophisticated fast food'. And with that established, they do a pretty good job. There's a wide variety of appetisers, burgers, steak, pastas, sea food, Mexican and some grilled items. Portions are massive, and the food tastes pretty good. The dessert menu is decent as well. They don't claim to serve health food, so don't expect that. My personal favourites are the buffalo wings, the southwestern egg rolls, almost any burger (buffalo, not beef), the Orleans Jambalaya and, of course, the molten chocolate cake. Hit the gym the day after.

Not many places like this . so I find no reason not to give 5 stars . u get nice draught beer while u waiting for ur beef to cook , a smoking room too. Don't like beer , no problem , they have amazing milkshakes , I always order 2 for myself coz one is just not good enough. Ambience is nice and service is good. Sad place for vegans though. So the chicken wings are awesome and come with lovely dips. The steak is lovely so are the burgers . u can surely have a happy meal here .

Celebrated my birthday at this joint this year ... !!! Thankfully did not have to wait too long to manage ourselves a seat . We had ordered the tripple dippers , some fried calamari , and cheese poppers and buckets of Margarita ... Yes buckets , literally . The quantity was too much for us small eaters to manage and taste wise it was quite upto my expectation . I especially dug into the dips . The calamaris were fresh and crunchy. They also got me a cake and did a little twirl dancing to celebrate the birthday spirit. Not bad , not bad at all. Oh.. not to mention a very good smiling waiter who helped us through the menu. Will surely pay this place next visit very soon .

After a long wait finally we got a table for ourselves. The ambience is really nice. The bar has a sporty vibrant feel. Though theres a lot of chatter and noise it all adds to the environment of the place. The seating is comfy with a lot of privacy. The waiters are smart attentive and proactive. The service was fast though the place is always packed. The food is typical Tex-Mex-Italian cuisine, or American comfort food. Add drinks to it and the place is it. One of the more professional and upmarket gastro pubs in the city. The prices are pretty steep but the portions are huge both food n booze. Definitely try there mojito's, quesadilla, chicken wings, fried calamari and egg rolls.

We had assorted non veg appetisers.

If you are looking to dine in a happy. happening, colourful ambience, Chili's is THE place to be!
The food is great. The quantity quite filling and adequate, and the exotic Mexican flavours are friendly with my Indian spice-craving taste buds.
The staff is cordial and pretty cool! Their menu is awesome, with all the delectable-looking images and painstakingly done up explanations, so that the customer faces no issues in deciding what to order.¬†
Love their bar menu as well.
Double thumbs up for their Triple Dipper starter, Country fried calamari, tacos , fajitas, crispy honey chipotle . country fried chicken, which are served with corn-on-the-cob ¬†and fried potato crispers, pizzas and burgers!

Oh what a taste....!!! Loved it. The fish is very very soft and tasty. Prawns and chicken were also very good. Quantity wise also it was good.
We ordered once blackened fish and Orleans jambalaya. Both were extremely tasty.
Another day we had ordered tortilla crusted chicken and smoky chipotle chicken fajita. Again these two were also good. 
Hope they keep up the good work.

Well what to say high expectations results in poor results.Well to start with ordered the classic nachos which was not at all tasty.Then triple decker a platter of starters.Well tasted horryfying then the grilled chicken for main course.Which was too dry and difficult to'swallow .My negative review is for food.The only thing good is the drinks and the service
And behaviour of the staffs.But please improve the food standards.

All the Mexican dishes were there on their menu and we started off with nachos (which they proclaimed to be their speciality) along with Masala Cola (not good) and Lemonade. The nachos were presented well but the portion was a little less for that hefty price. They served regular nachos with cheese and olives on top. I personally did not enjoy the nachos as I‚Äôm not an olive fan.

For main course we ordered Fajita‚Äôs and Tacos, I really liked the concept of make your own Fajita, wherein the waiter served the tortillas, salsa sour cream all separately and this huge sizzler platter of veggies and Mexican rice separately.

The Tacos were another of their delicacies with appropriate portion of kidney beans salad, iceberg lettuce, salsa, sour cream and pickled jalape√±os.

Overall a great Mexican food experience.

Visited this place for a Sunday dinner and had to wait for half an hour to get into the restro at 9pm. My friend and I ordered 1 plate classic nachos,1 plate chicken quesadilla,one margarita and one sangria. The service was quick but the food was absolutely horrible. I am very fond of Mexican cuisine but Chili's absolutely ruined it for me. The drinks were good but the food was not at all put to the mark especially considering the price on them. And it was not only us,but a family of four sitting in front of us were also having a heated discussion with the waiters regarding the quality of the food. I will not recommend this place to anyone.

One of the hot and happening places in town..and now they have even opened up in south city mall. I have been to the quest outlet twice. As soon as you enter you get a feeling like u r in one of those american diners. 

The decors and ambience is very hip and very now..great crowd and a very lively place. I'll only review based on wat i had. I had a philly cheese steak which was good and very filling..the helping was huge . 2nd time i went i took the baby back ribs. Believe me it was awesome. There r lot of mentionable dishes to try.. That baby back rib along with a beer. That made my day.

The service is good, the staffs r helpful too. The price is a bit on the higher side(again its a place located in quest mall so can't complain there). Overall i enjoyed it and i'm going to try the south city outlet this time.

Chilli's is a famous international food chain ,  so it is not nescessary to write a review , but itis new for us , so I will write . The food is good and the menu is iteresting and is easily accessable as it is in quest mall   . Its food is good , but still it has a tough competition with other restaurants like yauatcha , serafina & the irish house which are located just above it . Overall its food is good , the prices are a bit high but is reccomended for a casual lunch .

It was my sister's treat in the late afternoon hours when we were searching for a place with good continental cruising and yeah with a nice ambiance ( perfect lighting and slow music ) so chilis suits our description and within few min. we were inside Quest mall 
(Outlet) 

Service : well the receptionist greeted us with a curve on her face mentioning there special offers for the day. They were very helpful and will definitely help you with the selections :D 

Coming to the food we ordered ' triple dipper'  as a starter along with Jim beam white whiskey, well the combination goes well. 
For the mains we ordered ' smokey chicken chipotle fajitas' and I must say its an artistic dish , the plating , the smoke , the onion rings 
Mama mia :D 

We had to prepare the base of cheddar cheese , veggies , and curd or tortilla bread along with the fajitas , yummmm ! there it goes. In one word ' HEAVEN '. It was fun and delicious :D 

I would love to visit this place several times unless I finish trying all the dishes. 
Hahaha !!

Chili's is definitely one of the best restaurants in the city if you wish to splurge on a heart as well as stomach filling American affair. Located in the food court of Quest, this restaurant has a perfect ambience for a nice family lunch or dinner. The staff are courteous and ever smiling. They'll help you to your table, assist you with your food and click your pictures without a bit of irritation.

Coming to the food, we had ordered triple dipper as a starter along with mango refresher, molten chocolate and strawberry lemonade as mocktails. The starter was a basket of chicken wings, chicken crispers and southwestern egg rolls, four pieces of each item along with three tasty dips. All these were decent in taste. Among the mocktails, apart from the lemonade, the other two drinks were absolutely awesome. Special mention : Molten chocolate.

For mains, we ordered Monterey chicken, smoky chicken chipotle fajitas, chipotle pesto chicken pasta, roasted red pepper chicken. Each of these items deserve praise for their brilliance. The Monterey chicken was chicken fajitas served with mashed potato and veggies. The taste was perfect. The roasted red pepper chicken was spicy and delectable. Even the rice served with it was very tasty. The pasta had big chunks of chicken and a thick cheese dressing. It is surely one of the best pastas I ever had. The smoky chipotle chicken fajitas was one artistic dish. We had to prepare a base of cheddar cheese, veggies and curd on tortilla breads and had it along with the fajitas. It was fun and delicious.

Overall a grand experience; worth every penny.

Chilis is one of my favorite places to eat food . The classic American Diner Ambiance is something that's hard to find in India and chilis offers that. They have a huge menu offering American food as well as some Mexican and Italian. They have an amazing range of beer and the amount of helping per dish Ensures that you won't leave with any space in your stomach .

It was my brother's treat in the late afternoon hours when we were searching for a place with good continental cuisine packed with a nice ambiance. Chili's fitted the description perfectly, and in a few minutes we were inside Quest Mall.

‚òÖ LOCATION : Top floor of Quest Mall, beside the food court.

‚òÖ AMBIANCE & SERVICE : The receptionist greeted us and escorted us to our table. The warm, sophisticated ambience about our four seater table was really pleasant. Sports were screened live in the TV while the courteous staff (in their red " Chili's " tshirts) helped us in everything, starting from helping us decide what to eat, to clicking our group photos. 

‚òÖ FOOD : The food served here are like works of art. On a serious note, I wouldn't touch a single dish until a proper photo was clicked. 

> TRIPLE DIPPER : We started off with the platter consisting of 3-4 pieces each of Chicken Crisper, Chicken Wings and Southwestern Egg Rolls, alongside three delectable dips. Heavy and awesome.

> MONTEREY CHICKEN : Chicken fajitas served with veggies and a blob of mashed potatoes with a soft and spicy cheese topping itself sounds delightful, which it is. Although the mashed potatoes and cheese didn't go too well with my tastebuds, the overall offering was nice.

> SMOKY CHIPOTLE CHICKEN FAJITAS : The dish which I could eat over and over again! The experience of 'building' the tortilla with the bread, the sauces and the chicken, is worth remembering. Added to the largely flavorful base of veggies and a topping of fried onion rings, the dish is a delight to its entirety.

> CHIPOTLE PESTO CHICKEN PASTA : The spaghetti served in the creamy white sauce with generous servings of chicken is undeniably the best pasta I've had in the last few years.

> ROASTED RED PEPPER CHICKEN : A tangy and delicious chicken breast piece served with rice and broccoli comprised the platter.  The rice was good. The soft and juicy chicken won our hearts.

> MOCKTAILS : We tried the Mango Refresher, Strawberry Lemonade and Molten Chocolate Chunk. Barring the second one, we loved them. Special mention for the chocolate based drink, it was heavenly!

‚òÖ PRICES : The individual prices are slightly on the higher side, but the quantity offered in each dish together with the combined offering of food, ambiance and service is worth every penny. 

Cost for two would range within ‚Çπ1200-1600.
This is one place worth visiting if you haven't already.

Located on fourth floor of quest mall this place is like any other good resturants nothing spcl to mention. The food is not 1500 for two but on higher side if u r in for dinner or lunch n not for snacks. They have got a number of different cocktails to choose frm. there was this beer festival going on when we visited this place plus there was offer on specific cocktails. We took long island tea a plate f fajita (dnt remember what the name was) tripple dipper and molten lava cake for dessert and the bill came aroun 1800 with tax.  There is nothing spcl to mention about the food but yes definitely the ambience is great. Visit it if u havent visited but if tight on budget therz other better resturant to look out for. 

P.s sry :( forgot to click molten lava choclate cake n tripple dipper

Undoubtedly one of the best places in Kolkata to have Mexican and American cuisine. . 

Visited the place numerous amounts of time and wouldn't mind to keep visiting until I get bored...

Decor : nothing exciting or new it's a trend we see in many upmarket restaurants now... wooden tables and chairs... nice quirky lights... one can relate it with the normal dine in restaurants seen in Hollywood movies.. though it's better...

Ambience: well it's always very lively.. pop music playing in the background.. waiters are courteous.. a perfect place to hangout  with friends.. though i have always visited the place with my
significant other but never felt awkward.. and enjoyed a lot...

Food: this is what I'm excited to write about... everytime I visit this place I come out with a heavy stomach... every bite i took from various dishes... I enjoyed every bit of them....

My favourites are :- 
Orleans Jambalaya.. South eastern eggroll.. Fish and Chips.. Cajun club sandwich... BBQ Chicken salad & Southwestern Caesar Salad..

For dessert I only like Paradise Pie.. it's one of the best deserts i've tried in Kolkata.. once me and my significant other came here while returning from another restaurant just to have paradiseI pie...

Love their premium margaritas and martinis... 
Specifically the Tropical Sunrise Margarita.. & I'm a fan of their Dirty Martini..
They pulled off The blue lagoon cocktail from their menu.. it also was my favourite among the drinks...

Anyways it is one of my favourite restaurants in the city.. Looking forward to go there again soon..

That's the only rating you can give to Chili's. Good for everything. A bit expensive though but the food is worth the money. I visited Chili's on Poila Boisakh(Bengali New Year) and inspite of being overcrowded the staff was cordial offering quick service. We ordered Triple Dipper, Tortilla crusted chicken, Orleans Jambalaya and Cheese cake. The food was yum yum, the decor was amazing and the food was sufficient for 3. Good place to visit with your gang or your family. Even better when the treat is on someone else ;-)

Chili's serves the best cocktails and the best sour cream in town. I would pretty much try a lot of food that comes with that sour cream, but my favourite is the kicked up quasadillas which also come with a home made pico de gallo which is great. In fact I think Chili's serves an extraordinary range of sauces, dips and dressings, that's the secret to all the good food.

So here's how I like to order - I would like to limit myself to the (a) starters (tripple dipper, chicken wings and chicken crisper are very good and I love anything that comes with corn) which comes in very big helpings meant to be shared, (b) cocktails ( all so yum but I recommend the apple martini and long beach iced tea), (c) salad ( the chicken ranch salad is my favourite) and (d) desserts ( don't miss out on the molten chocolate cake). I have not tried the burger or the tenderloin steak, which I have been told is great.

Does it mean the main course is bad ? Of course not. It is pretty good. I have sampled few chicken dishes (country fried chicken and chicken crisper) and nearly all the fish dishes ( the blackened fish and fish and chips are for the risk-averse eater and the jambalaya /shrimp rices with its strong smell and taste for the more adventurous ones). I am not a big fan of the sides ( the veggies are usually unseasoned and dry with an even more lack lustre rice), or a deep fried southern chicken for main course. Personally, I prefer to stuff myself with the starters and finger food because (a) most of them are two to three grade above the main course in addition to suiting my personal pallete and (b) come in huge helpings which are pretty filling if you dont have a huge appetite like me.

So I basically I like to treat chili's as a pub with lots of finger food and starters as opposed to a proper fine dining place and it has worked for me brilliantly.

I downgraded them by .5 because their service is slow and one has to keep doing funny antics to get the attention of the servers and they charge a really hefty service charge. I am against any place that charges service charge even when the service isn't satisfactory.

Great location. Great ambience. Good crowd. Good food . Price bit high. Not at all 1500 for two if you go for dinner like the approximate given. Tried baby back pork ribs full rack(the reason why i went) and crispy honey chipotle and smoothies.. all of them were amply tasty.. pork was just what i expected .. very filling. staff isn't quite professional.. overall a good place for an elaborate meal.

The experience at Chili's was simply great. We managed to snag the happy hour offer and got good deals out of it. The burgers with the fries are good in quantity and pretty much enough for a meal. We order drinks such as Long Island Ice Tea and Daiquiri. Though the Daiquiri tasted fine I was disappointed with the LIIT. Most of the glass was just filled with ice which ruined the taste completely. Desert was way better. The molten chocolate cake was delicious and lip - smacking. I might just come again only for that. Prices were not too much. Since we managed to come across happy hour offer, bill for 4 was 1800/- which was pretty cheap considering what we had.

It was in my wish list from a very long time. It is located on 4th floor, of Quest mall. Staffs were welcoming and friendly. They always smile when we call them or place any order. Bright decor, mood lightening ambience. Wide variety of menu. You would love the range of food they serves. Being vegetarian it was difficult to make ourselves comfortable here. The portions were huge and the taste was pretty fantastic too. Chocolate molten cake was fabulous. Worth visiting here.

Secondly the interior is very nice. And lastly the food!! Wow :D I had Kicked-Up Quesadillas and Corn on Cob! Both were incredible :)

Every time I visit this place, I make it a point to try out something new! This time, the Fajita Trio and Big Mouth Bites! 
I don't usually go for starters but the mini burgers were to die for! Medium well was just perfect and so juicy, the bacon just as yum. Fajita Trio turned out to be a huge hit  with the family. Sizzling, the shrimp was cooked to perfection (I just wished there'd been more!). 
Apart from these, we ordered the usual Ribs, steak, Jambalaya rice and burger. All were up to the mark as usual and to be honest, Chili's just keeps me wanting to go back again and again for more!

I just love this place. Food is amazing. Service is too good and have great ambience. Fajitas, roasted chicken,  grilled chicken, crispy honey-bunch Chipotle chicken krispers is a must try. For dessert one must try choco molten cake and fudge brownie. It's little pricey but it's worth it.

Fantastic from the word Go. Starting with the waiters to the dishes they serve. A full on American yard where you get mouth watering dishes including desserts. Try out the juicy steak or the buffalo meat burgers. 
End it with a slice of Cheesecake. The coke comes with unlimited refills. To sum it up...this place though a bit high on the pocket will do definite justice worth your money and tummy.

The food is not hygienic.. We had dinner a day ago and out of 13 of us, 8 of us fell sick.. It has to be something to do with the food..  No more Chilli's.. And everybody should be careful before visiting this restaurant.. 8 out of 13 became bed ridden after eating there.  You be the judge.

Something is wrong with the tap water, I think! We were 13 people in a group, yesterday. they gave us tap water to drink. And after drinking when we returned home, 5 people got sick immediately. Fix your water, this might take the restaurant to the consumer court!

The best american food i have ever had in kolkata. Ambience was good. Stuffs were friendly & well behaved. The triple was just awesome there dips were finger licking good. The cajun club sandwitch along with loads of french fries was tasty & i couldn't finish that as it was of large quantity. A bit expensive but for this kind of experience one can spend money.

I have an instant liking towards places which offer half pizzas and that too serving them in rectangular plates making  them look complete! And if the same place has such an amazing menu that leaves gluttons like me totally confused about what to eat and what to let go, so much so, that only some amazingly innovative cocktails like coronaritas (that looks like a physics lab experiment, by the way) or a mug of good draught beer can settle that confusion, then we are probably talking about Chili's! Looking forward to checking out their South City Mall outlet.

Finally! Like finally I got time to visit Chili's and I am still wondering about that experience I had there yesterday!

Reached Quest Mall on a Sunday Afternoon at around 5.30pm. The mall was hugely crowded and I was expecting a long wait before entering Chili's. To my surprise, we were called in within 2mins and given a window seat! From there you can get a beautiful landscape of the city which was really an added advantage to me! Those graffiti and posters hanging around gave the decor a chic feeling, but amidst the bustles of Quest Mall Food-court, some loud music were being played which I dint like much.

I was almost acquainted with the Chili's menu (courtesy: my friends and fellow foodies and their praising about their food!) and I quickly settled for a Triple Dipper in starter along with a Strawberry Lemonade and Blackberry Moji-tea. The restaurant was full to its brim and still the food got served by 5mins exactly!¬†

Triple dipper is a combo of generous portions of Chicken Crispers, Southwestern Eggrolls and Chicken Wings, with 3 different types of dips. 

Chicken Crispers : This was absolutely blissful, giving me a touch of nostalgia about my favorite ‚ÄòButter Fry‚Äô... crisp coatings succulent chicken strips provided a kick start to our meal! 

Southwestern Eggrolls : These too were interesting, more like spring rolls, tasted great with the mayo dip. 

Chicken Wings : This was a miss for me... it tasted so sour that I was about to ask the waiter if they had literally dipped it in a tamarind paste or something, in spite of me being a big pickle-lover! 

All of the dips were blended without fault, acted the perfect accompaniment with the fries!

Strawberry Lemonade and Blackberry Moji-tea arrived in between‚Ä¶ in huge beer mugs... The Strawberry Lemonade tasted cool! With the right mix of strawberry crush and lemonade, it was a real thirst-quencher. Blackberry Moji-tea was a regular ice tea with almost no flavor of blackberry.

In main course, we went for Country Fried chicken and Crispy Shrimp basket. 

Country Fried Chicken: It was a platter containing a large crumb-fried chicken breast, mashed potatoes, sweet corn on the cob and toasted garlic bread. Everything was so simple yet perfect in this platter! The corn was soft, sweet and buttery‚Ä¶ the chicken was juicy and perfectly fried‚Ä¶ the mash was silky smooth‚Ä¶ the toast was buttery yet crunchy! Authenticity at its best!

Crispy Shrimp Basket: 9-10 good sized prawns, crumb-fried were served in a bed of French fries along with Tartar Sauce. The prawn was crunchy owing to its freshness, tasted ideal with the Tartar dip. But the French Fries were really huge in quantity and we faced a real tough time to finish them off! Somehow the balance in quantity should have been kept‚Ä¶ with more prawn and less fries! Nevertheless, this can be a very good side with your pint of beer!

I had heard a lot of their dessert and as pre-decided, we ordered a Molten Chocolate Cake. The dessert addition in their new menu tempted us like anything and we added one Chocolate Truffle Cheese Cake as well. And there we made the mistake of the day! We were three and we got so stuffed in finishing one single dessert, we could not relish the other one!

Chocolate Truffle Cheese Cake: Served in a huge hand crafted glass, this contains chocolate cheese cake, based with Oreo biscuit and layered with rich truffle sauce. Heavenly is the only word for this piece of dessert. Probably the best of the cheesecakes I have tasted in my life... This has got such richness within, that I can come back just for this item, really!

Molten Chocolate Cake: Frankly speaking, we could not enjoy this dessert after experiencing the richness of Chocolate Truffle Cheese Cake, but this was again a masterpiece containing warm chocolate fudge with vanilla ice cream and a crunchy chocolate shell. Wonderfully crafted!

Definitely a very memorable experience‚Ä¶ with 2499/- as our pocket pinch! Coming back very soon to try out their Fajitas!

I am gonna give this place full points bcoz I couldn't find any flaws in the place...
I have been waiting ever since I checked the menu of this place on zomato...i developed an instant liking for this place...
We went there on Sunday around 8pm...we were asked to wait for 25mins but we were called in within 5mins...
We ordered one grilled chicken burger,one chicken ranch burger, one blackened salmon,one grilled chicken platter,one grilled shirmp Alfredo and citrus fire chicken and shrimp fajita...
The service was prompt and quick...
Each and every dish tasted amazing...the fish was delectable...chicken grilled burger was amazing....the best burger I have ever had...pasta was good...and the fajitas were superb...especially the tortilla breads which were soft beyond imagination :D
I really wanted to try some of their deserts especially the chocolate truffle cheese cake but I was stuffed so bad that I did not dare order any more....but I would definitely like to try some on my next visit...
The prices are on the higher side...but they serve huge portions and the food is worth every penny

Had Chicken Crispers, Pork Ribs,Peach Fantasy, Banana Strawberry Delight. 
Below are the things that i would like to mention: 
¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†
¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†1. In Chicken Crispers quantity of French Fries was more than Chicken part. But taste wise it is a must try.
¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†2. I am a big fan of Pork Ribs(Baby Back Ribs). It wasn't upto the mark as i found a bit less salty. 
¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†3. Peach Fantasy was very bad kinda tasted like Syrup. That's why i opted for Banana Strawberry Delight to make me feel better.
¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†Overall i enjoyed the lunch very much¬† and would want to visit this place again as there are so many items to enter with.

Went to chili's this Saturday!
A place I can hangout without giving a second thought
Was feeling little low so had thought of catching on some drinks with my friend
As was expected there was a line of people waiting to get a table ( what else can one expect of chili's on weekends)
So after twenty minutes of wait when I finally got the table, it was a true delight!
Now where shud I start from .........
This American joint truly exports u to another world from simple yet completely trendy decor, to the green n red logo, to amazing crockery n glassware ( being a hotelier yes I notice that too), the table setup, the menu and what not
And most importantly the constituents of the menu i.e. food n drinks
It's a place that never disappoints you when it comes to experiencing some mind blowing tex mex cuisine
On a quest of trying out different foods n flavors I gave a try chicken crispies that was simply mouth watering ( the dip and side portion add on to it) and a pepporoni pizza which again did not disappoint me at all!
The doneness, the blend of flavors and presentation of food ( even when the restaurant is busy) make u marvel at how do they do it!
And how can I miss out on service, which is professional yet with a personal touch to it
It's evident from the way they do it all that it's not just another food n beverage joint
But an effort that comes out from a complete team
Kudos to them!!!!!!!!!

We had ordered the Blackened Salmon, Jalapeno poppers and the Honey chicken crispers. I felt the poppers could have been better if the cheese was inside a fresh jalapeno and then deep fried. The chicken crispers were yummmy. I had gone there with my parents and my father has a lot of food restrictions, so we had requested for a non spicy fish. Their effort to make sure the food was as per order was much appreciated. Even non spicy the fish was delicious.¬†I loved my Blackberry Mojitea. Overall the food was good and definitely worth going back for.¬†

But, what was disappointing was the service which started off quite well but became slow and sloppy. Our order of extra rice and corn never reached our table. And, it took us around 25 minutes to get our bill.

It was my boyfriend's birthday when I went to this place. The ambience , the decor all are quite impressive.  Staffs are helpful. Lets talk about food now. We odered for two mocktails, tripple dipper, blackened fish , country style chicken. Blackened fish is really tasty. The fish was well cooked . It was juicy and tender, country style chicken was pretty good. But all the items of tripple dipper was not impressive.  Among them only one satisfied my taste. Shortly chili's is opening at south city , so eger to visit the place ^_^

This place serves amazing tex mex food. You would love the range of food this place serves. Things to try out are Tripple dipper and tender loin steak. We did try out the grilled chicken platter and one Fajita as well. All were awesome. Have been there thrice and everytime you need to stand in the queue. One thing to note here is about the tax they charge. It is on the higher side and I think the highest in kolkata with almost 30% in total.
Half star deducted for this. I think they should rectify this as i dont understand the logic behind this.

I visited this place on last Tuesday. This was my 2nd visit after October 2014.
The first visit was good.. No bad experiences i could think of. But the 2nd time i felt i would not recommend chilli's to others. Here's my story:

First while entering the staff at the gate gestured at me from bottom to top. I don't know if my outfit was not suitable or what ( i wore a full length skirt and a tee ).
Second, we ordered a snack on calamari, a bur-born whiskey and a cocktail. The waitress told that d drinks will come first and the snack, later. We were okay with that. She went away and came back asking... The starter you have ordered is based on sea food. Its squid.. Kind of octopus.. Is it okay?
I thought....Yes, i know what is squid.. And told her its fine.
Again she came back after 2seconds asking me.. The drink you have ordered is a cocktail.. Its an alcoholic drink.. Is it okay ma'm? ........ This time i was like.. What the hell? Does she think i don't know what cocktail is? Or does she think i am under aged??..... I said i've gone through the ingredients and thats what i have ordered.

Now comes d service part.. Our snack came first and we had to call the waiters twice to have d drink.
We wanted to order a second snack.. But couldn't find a waiter for 5 to 7 minutes.



From this experience of mine, i wont visit this place again because of poor service quality. Food quality is satisfying.

Being vegetarians it was a little difficult to make ourselves comfortable here but the staff was really friendly and polite to begin with. After confusingly sifting through th big menu, we eventually decided to try a new mexican bowl dish and a signature special new burger. The portions were huge and the taste was pretty fantastic too. We went for the popular liit choice for the drink, which wasnt extraordinary but not shabby either. Overall a nice fun lunch at a fun place! Vegetarians should consider it as well.

Visited chili's in kolkata for the 1st time.Terrible experience. This outlet is spoiling the brand name. My kids always like the pasta (kids menu) of chili's so ordered pasta, fries n sprite for them. To my utter surprise they served soda instead of sprite.After my complain they accepted their mistake. Such mistakes r not expected from chili's.  Even the pasta was not tasty as the other outlets of chili's outside India. Very poor service also.  Total wastage of money.

Coming to food, the Triple dippers, the Fajita quassedella and the Chipotle pizza all worth mentioning due to its one of a kind taste. The moccachino was an average one but every other food marked a cult of their origin. The price .... Going by the quality and experience, "Itna to banta hai boss" ! 
Would visit again to experience their burgers !

‚ñ† Recommend you all -  Tripple diper, Classic Fajitas combo , south western egg roll.
‚ñ† Waiter service - very good
‚ñ† Interior - FABULOUS !!!
‚ñ† Pocket pinch (for two) - 2000/-Rs. Plus.
One thing that's unique for chili's, QUEST MALL is it's a big view of kolkata.

Though I am fond of north Indian cuisine and not much accustomed to American cuisine, for a change this place could be a nice destination.

I got a taste of this place shortly after it opened and I remember a fun family celebration, where all the dishes were tasty, the highlight being the strawberry lemonade. A second visit disappointed me as the food quality had dipped and so I stopped going there for a while. However, a few visits this year has restored my faith in this joint and I've had a good time with both large groups and small. Food portions are generous, the nachos are more real than most places and laden with cheese and toppings. The quesadillas are quite tasty as well. In drinks, the President's Margarita is one of a kind and a must-try. I am a vegetarian, but I've still enjoyed myself at this restaurant, so vegetarians, don't write this off as a meat-only place!

I dont need any reason to visit this place. If you are carnivorous in nature, you have ofcourse visited this wonderful dream like place for meat lovers. The prices are on the higher side, but the brilliant taste and the huge quantity makes up for it. There are a huge variety of cocktails that they serve and their signature beer bugs which are just Huge. Fried calamari, triple dipper, quesadillas, fagitas are a stand out. The blackened salmon, the country fried chicken, chicken crispers is a good choice if somebody likes to keep it safe and simple. The ambience is truly good and the try to get a place beside the window. It gives a great view of the city and the whole experience becomes delectable. The staff is courteous and very polite. The dessert menu doesnt attract me that much but you can always give it a try.

Visited Chilis yesterday. A great place for mexican and american cuisine. Me and my husband ordered a Triple Dipper, Non Alcoholic Margarita and Evolution. I liked the south western egg rolls and chicken crispers but however the chicken wings could not satisfy me much. The dips served with the entree were just awesome and drinks were good too. It seemed they had served the Evolution in a giant size tumbler!
Although we thought of ordering the main course after we finish the starters, we could not, thanks to the quantity served! We are surely going to visit again to try different dishes next time.

A great place to go for the best of the lot TexMex food. The next best thing is an open bar where you can rest yourselves over on the high bar stools over drinks with a few bites too. Located next to Inox you can conveniently plan you dinner or lunch, coupled with movie and make the most of your Sunday without hopping around too much. Great cocktails and mocktails make the food more pleasurable, and they know it well enough!!!

Chili's is always a good option if you want to have American/Mexican food and drinks with a group of friends. They have a good collection of cocktails and mocktails. I tried their Dry Martini and a Cajun Chicken Burger which was really good. Their Cheese Poppers and Classic Veg Nachos is also delicious. The Nachos plate actually feels like a thin crust pizza.

Chili's, located on the top floor of the Quest Mall, beside Inox, is relatively a new joint in the city. A great place to hang out with friends. I went there twice. So summing up my experience into a single review. My personal favourite in alcohol section is the 'Presidente Margarita'. Both the times we had it. The way they serve it (continuously shaking within the shaker) makes it more fascinating. In food section, we had 'Citrus fire chicken n shrimp', 'Kicked up quesadilla with steak', 'Turkey burger' and lastly my fav duo 'Fajita trio' & 'Baby back ribs'. Hospitality is superb, all staffs are well mannered. They are also masters of some "hatke" ideas to surprise u, if u need it, specially in birthday parties or so. Overall a fabulous place to chill with buddies :)

A mixed feeling really. The ambience is good. The burgers were great and so were the tacos. But, the main reason why I went there was the steak and I was thoroughly disappointed. I asked for medium-rare but when they brought me the dish it was not even cooked properly! Upon complaining, they cooked it again!

Chili's has been my all time favourite place for the kind of quesadillas they serve. But one thing which I have realised in the past few visits to this place is that there is a huge inconsistency in their food quality and taste. Though the service is always very good but the food taste had deteriorated. The veg quesadilla that we ordered was horrible. Cold and soggy. The rice had a burnt pungent taste. The black beans that they served was a runny gravy completely tasteless. Though at our request they changed the entire dish but the overall experience had already gone down. They cannot match the service and food level at a global level.

If you can eat well Chili's is the place for u.. I went there with my family..The decor is nice... But the food is goood! We started with the triple dipper.. It was yum.. Then we ordered a pepperoni pizza for my dad, a chicken  ranch burger for my boyfriend, and a smoked chicken  chipotle fajita for mom and me.. There was plenty of food on the table so we had loads to eat along with a beer pitcher and a glass of wine. I have never had beef so missed out on the steaks as they serve tenderloin nd buffalo ribs. But those who do can definetly give it a shot.. 
For the desset we had choclate truffle cheese cake, and chocochip cookie pie with ice cream.. They were hands down great!! 
Overall the experince was awwwsum..

This is a brief review/rating of Chili's.
Probably the only place in Kolkata to get Ribs, Steaks, Salmon and Mexican dishes under the same roof.
I visited this place thrice in last couple of months¬† and this rating is based on my overall experience.
Food Taste - 4/5
Service - 3.5/5
Price/Value for Money - 3/5
Ambiance & D√©cor - 3.5/5
*************
OVERALL - 3.5/5
*************
Although expensive (specially if you order drinks), visiting this place is quite an experience. Suitable for both family and friends. You can spend your birthday or anniversary while the whole restaurant will sing a jingle for you. A nostalgia if you ever visited the chain in the USA!

Located on the food court floor of Quest Mall. My friend took me here. Not a bad experience. I am a huge fan of grilled stuffs, so i ordered for Grilled Chicken Platter. Taste was quite good. More than taste what i liked was the serving style. It was very nice and innovative. I also ordered Roasted Red Pepper Chicken, Tortilla Crushed Chicken, Blackend Fish, Crispy Shrimp Basket. All of the above are must must must try out here. Best goes with some whiskey on the rocks or beer ;). All the foods were finger licking good. I became a fan of their food.¬†
Ambiance-¬†Ambiance is quite modern and exotic. Wide sitting arrangements.¬†
Staffs- Very friendly and attentive. Understands your order well and serves very professionally and nicely.¬†
A totally recommended resturant from me. CHEERES !!

Chili's - this recently opened restaurant is becoming the new craze for foodlovers of Kolkata... well, why not! it claims to serve one of the best Mexican American and Italian food in the city.. and the decor itself is unbelievably attractive and lively.. specially the seats along the big window sides!(that's where we sat)!
The waiters are always at help.. helping us to choose our dishes and also explains the unknown dishes quite well!
We ordered crispy honey chipotle chicken crispers( oh, what a tongue twisting name!) and grilled tenderloin steak. I tried my first ever beef steak here and I loved it! The chicken crispers were very tasty.. and that special sauce and sweetcorns served along with it made it taste even better.. the steak- well, found it a little bit difficult to cut off the pieces initially but, taste was good( but later on, I've discovered many good places serving much better steaks though)!! And their huge glasses for beverages and water was quite eye-catching!
Prices are definitely on higher side.. but afterall its inside quest mall!!
And I totally love the awesome aroma of the American-mexican-Italian food every time I visit quest mall and pass by chili's!!!!

One of the best in Kolkata, located in Quest mall. ¬† ¬†Ambiance- is very simple yet classy. The waiters and managers are extremely courteous, attentive and well behaved. They would help you to suggest menu as per your requirement. As far as Foods are concerned, we had their very own Triple Dippers and needless to say it was just out of the world. We also ordered for Roasted Red Pepper Chicken and Blackened Salmon. Each of these are served as portions which contains fired rice, veges, dips along with chicken or fish. Both of the dishes were excellent and having pure Mexican touch. We also had mock tails which were quite accurate and refreshing. The prices are on the higher side and it is total value for money. One should not regret after visiting this place and for all the foodies this place is worthy of visiting once. Because from the next time onward you will start suggesting others.

They say that even the size of a toothpick in Starbucks is the result of long research.The moral of the story is that these chain restaurants have perfected a plan after years of customer survey and then stuck to it.

Bright interiors,a propensity of wood,a lively bar,jazzy uniforms,concerted participation by servers in case of a birthday,in your face menu......these are common to places like Chilis,Pizza Hut,KFC etc.What sets Chili apart is the taste and the aftertaste.

Excellent lemonade,beer served snazzily,kick ass starters like triple dipper,chicken wings which we had,my favourite blackened fish,fajitas,and my favourite baby black ribs.......who needs anything more?welcome addition to Kolkata food scene and a benchmark for services for other eateries for sure.Its early and the queue already forming.Hurry!!!!!

It was my second visit to Chili's. I was not that impressed with my first visit there well, i would say the second visit managed to change it a bit. 

Location-

¬†Very easy to find just adjacent to the INOX Quest. 

Ambiance-

Very lively. Its not over decorated. The look is kept casual.Since i love subtle decorations i loved the place. A perfect place to Hang out with your friends. Dont worry the waiters are extremely courteous and would help you to decide the menu in case of doubt, They are never in hurry to throw you out of the restaurant even if people are waiting outside.But yeah they did forget that we have ordered a main course after the starters *disappointing_face palm*

Food-

We have ordered there famous Tripple Dippers. Yes! it was indeed delicious. i genuinely liked the sausage fry, it was crispy and mouth watering.we also ordered red pepper fried chicken. We expected it to be spicy as the name suggested but it was dull. It was not similar to the one shown in the pictures. The bell pepper-tomato rice was small in quantity and not that tasty.It had a little too much broccoli. ¬†The chicken had a cheese coating but it was not juicy. If you take a starter and then this particular main course then yeah it is filling. Also we have ordered a soda lemon mixed mocktail which they served in huge beer glasses.

Price-¬†
Definitely on the higher side. some dishes are worth it though but not red pepper chicken. we payed almost Rs 2000( for two)

Pro-
The causal carefree ambiance, the quantity of cocktails and the delicious starters

Cons-
The main course, lack of varieties in steaks and price.

Suggestion-
for the foodies- nevertheless the place is must visit for its variations in food. One should always try new cuisine.
for the restaurant- why dont you include plain and classic steak in your menu...like the one which is juicy and served with barbecued sauce, mashed potatoes,mushroom and a poached egg on it :D The culinary skills your chefs have it should be an instant hit!

Finally manged to visit Chili's after months of delay. A place with a great mix of Mexican, American and Italian food which will blow your mind away. Each item is prepapred with its distinctive style and each retains its authencity. Almost every dish aims to satisfy a foodie.

The special drinks and margaritas need special mention. But the tasty food that followed distanced us from the drinks. The dishes were served with perfection and not to mention the quality service provided by the staff. But the real deal at the end of the feast was the Molten Chocolate Cake. It is a must have for the first timers.

Located in the posh Quest Mall, it is a posh experience that you have here. You enter the place and it is suddenly America.
Yes, it is expensive.
The quality, however, is probably higher than what would be A grade.
I recommend:
# Blackened Salmon
# Tenderloin Grilled
# Molten chocolate cake (MUST TRY)

I cant tell you much about the drinks, but I guess, it is a good deal for drinks at Chili's too.

  You can find yourself lost in the midst of loadz of riddle dishes unless get a helping hand from the waiters which we actualy found genuinely warm.. We started with a Fuzzy Navel and Lynchburg lemonade. Its a perfect nerve relaxant..bringing up a full chillout mood.
   The food we orderd were Triple dipper, Blackened Fish, Crispy Honey-Chipotle chicken Crispers. All were hit and achieved to conquer us from all aspect!..
  Its a perfect hangout spot,nobody gonna rush you out..so if u can grab a sofa corner and order some choicy dishes you can well say.. its your day..

Heard so much about the place..the ambience was rocking as well..But a new waiter suggested me a burger which had buffalo wings in it in spite of me asking for a vegetarian suggestion. A veteran watching over the waiter came to my rescue But that is what the first impression I had about it. I ordered a jalapeno burger and fried tacos..to be very honest I thought the food was ok...nothing like what I had heard..it may be possible I have to go again as the menu is vast to order better. But then any good should be able to sweep you away if it's good. Overall not a very good first experience but will go again.

This place is a little overhyped,I feel. Or maybe its just the cuisine. A little expensive,yes. But ¬†the quantity is pretty good,more than enough for two.
Cottage cheese quesadillas and fajitas were light and okayish.
Crispy Honey chicken is lip-smacking.
Chocolate molten cake is a dessert-lover's delight.
There's another dish we had,it was the blackened fish maybe.Didn't like the taste of the fish much.

Would like to try the Triple Dipper,Jambalava,Pizzas and Burgers during future visits.

The ambience is chili's is pretty good . With good music and the occasional laughter from a group friends you feel comfortable right away . The food is again amazing . We had the grilled chicken platter and the chicken was outstanding . However the sauce that was given along with i tasted like nothing . It was absolutely flavourless and murky . My friends took the prawn and chicken fajitas and every element of that dish was very well made but the sauce deserves a special mention . However the prices are on the higher side atleast for a college student . All in all it was a wonderful experience and I cannot wait to gather the group and again .

I guess this was the only decent place for food in the quest mall to visit with your family (apart from the food court of course). Staffs were very much cordial and professional. Probably the best I have seen. The food was finger licking good. Yes, I mean it. The classic nachos   were the first item served. Our expectations shooted up like anything after this. They had an item named Fajita- with a lot of varieties. This was the first time I tasted a Fajita and just looked it. The steamed broccoli and the salads  also demands mentioning. Keeping the food quality in mind, I won't say it to be an expensive place. Only demerit : Tables are too tiny for accommodating 3 plates and a couple of serving bowls. A bit cozy ambience would have been appreciated.

A charming place with colorful and variety of offerings which trivially demands multiple visits to cherish all its charm with no leftover. This was my first visit and with high expectations and undoubtedly, none of my expectations were turned to be unfulfilled.
It is a very well decorated cozy place with perfect ambiance. Staffs taking orders are extremely well-behaved, cooperative and expert in explaining the menu. I ordered Triple Dipper, Grilled Tenderloin, Fajita Trio, Watermelon Moji-Tea and Peach Moji-Tea. All were served perfectly. In the triple dipper, I liked chicken crisper the most - supersoft chicken coated in fried wrapper. Grilled tenderloin was excellently cooked and tasty and same was the fajita trio. Worth mentioning the floor supervisor who helped me out to make fajita as it was new to me. Moji-tea was perfect. Sober flavor with huge quantity. All the items were perfectly cooked and had excellent taste. Only negative can be the price which is on higher side but sometimes acceptable for the delicate and uncommon items and undoubtedly the quality which is typically of international standard. After lunch was over, a lady came to take feedback on a tab and it generated number which was manually written on our bill. They requested to carry the bill on our next visit to get identified as an old customer. I think they should start maintaining customer database and implement the concept of membership ID. Keeping and carrying an old bill can be difficult in such fast life of this era.
Overall experience was fantastic and memorable as expected. I would like to visit this place again and again to experience the other items on their menu. Definitely a new feather in Kolkata's cap.

Chilli's. My junior lab-mate gave me a treat at there. It was a nice experience for having "hatke" food for Bengali people. We mainly try Chinese, Indian, Mughlai, Thai maximum. Here mainly American, Mexican food is served, for example Nachos, Tako, Fajitas. The dips are also so tasty. When I found this kind of taste, my stomach and heart force me for the visit here more and more times. The preparation price is a little bit costly for me, but when I compare with the taste, I forgot the price. In one sentence - I am loving it. I try many preparations in every time I visit at Chilli's. Still, there are lots of food preparations still to be waiting for me. The Triple Dipper is my favorite one. And in desert Brownie Sundae. Just mind blowing taste. These two are common in my each visit. The atmosphere is really cool and music is also very nice and the serving people are really helping us to choose any unknown food, Finally, If you participate in the survey, Chilli's give you some benefit on your next visit.

The hype and stardom associated with this renowned American-Mexican eatery is boundless. And what better place to celebrate your birthday than a humdinger in town? So yesterday happened to be my birthday and Chili's was the chosen destination to dine in. The ambience of this place is like the pubs in those Western-genre Hollywood movies, greeting you effortlessly and signalling you to relax and enjoy the evening. Well, that is what I indolently embraced about this place. The food, at the point where the marginal utility was dipping, became malicious to my interests. Mexican Nachos kicked things off for me and my partner, portraying enough benevolence to us. Having said that, my partner looked a little precarious towards the end. The triple dipper might well have been a better choice. We followed that with Taco Pizza, which I could pretty much relate with a normal Italian Pizza, devoid of the Southwestern touch. Decent, but not as inviting as the pictures in the menu. We wrapped up the savouries with Orleans Jambalaya, consisting of Shrimps and Bacon, which, despite not being served a great deal in terms of quantity, tasted good. After quite a dilemma, we ended up ordering the Molten Chocolate Cake, a mouthwatering dessert, the ooze clearly poised to stimulate minds. For a verdict, I wouldn't say I had the most extraordinary experience, either becuase I'm more of a sauce person, or because the choices were wrong. A second visit is imminent, pertaining to the number of options they have, but as I walked out of the restaurant, it didn't quite compel me to think I was wrong.

Chilli's is one of my favourite restaurants in Kolkata . The ambience is too good , especially if you manage to get those window seats . The decor is too good and kept simple. I like that. And the bar is tempting. We ordered a Tripple Dipper for starters and for main course we ordered a Blackened Salmon , a Classic Chicken Fajitas and a Grilled Tenderlion. The dippers of our starters were too good. The mayo and cheese was absolutely mouthwatering. Coming to the main course the fish was smoky flavoured and very soft . The rice which accompanied it was very tasty. It had a strange kind of garlic flavour I loved. The brocolis were buttery and soft . It was a complete and satisfying dish . The fajitas- what am I going to say about them? It was heaven. The bread was so soft and when you have a bite of the chicken wrapped in the bread you would feel a burst of different kind of flavours inside your mouth. I loved it. Though I managed to get only a bite of it from my friend. And then coming to the Grilled tenderloin , I was waiting impatiently to taste this dish. I could not in fact wait to cut my knives through the steak. But alas the tenderloin was overcooked and we complained about it. The server changed it in a few minutes with a perfectly cooked pink tenderloin . It was very juicy and paired with the buttery corn cub and the soup, it was yummy. This is the best tenderloin I have ever tasted. We ended our lunch with the heavenly Cheesecake. The staff and servers of chilli's was very friendly and they helped us a lot. The bill was around 4k with alchohol. I plan to visit again during the pujas.
Thank you chilli's.

A must go for Continental food lovers. But the Happy Hours from 4pm-8pm in weekdays is the real attraction..Apart from the Fajitas and Steaks, the availability of wide range of starters add to its speciality for Cocktail lovers and college-goers during happy hours. One must try Margaritas and Long Beach Iced Tea. Chili's is cheaper than the Irish House and undoubtedly bartenders know how to blend it Perfect!!

Visited Chili's at QUEST Mall and it was a rather enriching experience. We entered the restaurant before 8 pm, hence it was happy hour! We got 2 mojitos for the price of one and it was awesome. For starters, the triple dipper is a good deal and the portions are really generous! Special mention for the quesadilla which was very tasty and a must order. Would like to add that the ambience is friendly and the music really sets the mood. Great service! A must try :-)

Chilies is One important PitStop when you want to spend a Friday beer night with your friends or Weekend Mall Hopping. 

And what an interesting place this is. 

They are located in the Quest Mall right before the entry to the Inox Cinemas. 

The finger licking good Chicken Wings and their burgers are to die for.  Wash them down with Pjnts of Beer or Delicious cocktails that are there in the wide array of drinks. 

Find a seat next to the glass walls over looking the Main Road and you ll immediate be at ease. The place has got a positive / feel good and happy environment  

Overall a super good place to grab a drink and head for the movies

I went to chili's for the first time, it was my friend's birthday party. We did enjoy a lot there, I had a strawberry lemonade and it was delicious. The food was ok but the dessert was mouth watering! The ambience was very nice. Also as it was my friend's b day and we informed the staff about it, so they came up with a complimentary cake and sang a joyous birthday song for her! So the staff is very co-operative and polite. Overall I liked the place!

need a 4.8 rating option.. alas... it ain't there... went there yesterday with friends and had a memorable time... courteous staff and superb ambience... lip smacking south-western/tex-mex stuff yeah!!! btw... the posters of their signature dishes with brief descriptions can really tempt you into indulgence !! :)) all of us shared 4 pitchers of draught beer and since we went around dusk, not much of main course but only starters..But who cares!?!! They were delish indeed!! We had Classic Nachos with Fajita Chicken, Triple Dipper, and Texas Cheese Poppers... All of us have fallen in love with their Nachos... Itz as Latino as you can get in India!! ehhhh!! Cheese was smashing! Chicken Fajita pieces as good as they get.. & it had cool sour cream with the pico de gallo a la el Mehico‚Ä¶.!!  Yeahh!! Overall an absolute pleasure experience!! It was almost like anything going to every table seemed so fab that it was nearly a visual and olfactory orgasm!! You heard me right!!! :)))))

Really the best place to hangout at. Ordered Baby back ribs with honey Chipotle sauce. Well cooked and really enjoyed it. It could however have been a lot better if some more sauce was used on it. Wasn't as saucy as ribs should be. Still was pretty amazing though. 

Very reasonably priced food. Loved it! Had tried various other cocktails and drinks. All I remember about them is they were nice ;)

Chili's was a family favorite when we lived else where in the world and is a refreshing restaurant to have in Kolkata's ever increasing list of places to eat. The food quality has certainly improved from when we first went there. Today we enjoyed the fajitas and the crispy honey chipotle chicken crispers, washed down with some bottomless coke. Good food, great portion size and service.

Let me start by saying, you won't be disappointed on your visit to this chic Mexican eatery. Ambience- check; food - check; derive and quality - check. It is truly a great place for casual haangout or fun night out with family and friends.
The portions they serve is amazingly monstrous is proportion. So make sure you go empty stomach.
Had ordered Tropical sunrise, beer, chicken pizza and fried calamari last time, and everything just tasted amazing. I especially loved the cocktail. It was just the right proportion of everything and made my day. Surely going again and will keep going till I try all the options on the menu.

Located at Quest Mall, Chilis (stylised with a single l) is a small hole-in-the-wall joint with monochromatic decor and wooden chairs for seats. Chilis purports a chilled vibe coupled with a dash of hot sauce to challenge the quick service restaurant industry. This spacious restaurant is already a popular meeting spot for many Easties, and it undoubtedly looks like there is a steady growth of visits from Westies too! Grilling their patties over an open flame brings out the flavours within to make the sacrificial meat proud, especially when mingled with additions of skin-on natural cut French fries and slurps of fizzy cocktails. Made-to-order burgers ensure each chomp is fresh, warranting favourites like the Grilled Chicken Cheeseburger, Nachos Chicken and the Triple Dipper as fail-safe choices.

My fellow foodie come brother Rayn decided to throw his birthday party here. We started with the ‚ÄòClassic Nachos Chicken‚Äô & ‚ÄòCorona Extra‚Äô beer‚Äî Crunchy nachos coated with fajita chicken, mayonnaise, melted cheese, jalapenos and beans on every chip ‚Äî a typical Mexican street food. Nachos chicken served with house made pico de gallo, sour cream; tastes splendid and flawless match to enjoy with the Mexican beer.

Next we want to explore ‚ÄòTriple Dipper‚Äô, ‚ÄòGrilled Chicken Burger‚Äô and ‚ÄòStrawberry Daiquery‚Äô.

The must-try here would be their Triple Dipper, servings were big-hearted and the chicken crisper actually taste like tempura bits add a surprising crunch factor. The Triple Dipper will satisfy those who want something more chicken-ish, the melt-in-your-mouth chicken fries were sure to please meat-lovers. Dips were also awesome, faultlessly blended. The triple dipper was a combo of three favourite starters, generous portions ‚ÄòChicken Crispers‚Äô , ‚ÄòChicken Wings‚Äô and ‚ÄòSouth-eastern Eggrolls‚Äô; perfect for ravenous people. The Triple Dipper was perfectly cooked to mouth-watering succulence and perfection.

Now it‚Äôs time to go for their massive Grilled Chicken Burger which generously comprises of a soft, marinated grilled chicken breast with two epically soft buns, smoked bacon, lettuce, sliced tomatoes, caramelised onions, swiss cheese and honey ‚Äì mustard dressing played tasty supportive roles. Don't forget to splash a generous glug of Strawberry Daiquiri all over that perfectly cooked chicken for a legit experience. Grilled Chicken Burger was quite literally a party in your mouth.

Of course, no lunch is complete without a kick of cocktail from their classic beverage menu. Chilis earn loyal patrons by offering great affordable drinks alongside delicious bites. Strawberry Daiquery looked gorgeous and simply too good to resists! Bartender added his own twist to create some uniqueness in this plain and simple strawberry & white rum cocktail.

One more thing to talk about, that they don‚Äôt serve water until or unless you asked for it, I was bit surprised. Price is definitely high if you compare with quality and quantity of food but another draw is their free Wifi and ample seating, good omens for those who love browsing net from restaurants. Definitely a try out place if you love americanised food.

Chili's mixes American flavours with local Indian tastes to provide a new dining experience. Loved the crispy honey chilly chicken. Try the triple dipper too for a feel of original American flavours. The mocktails and desserts were both good to look at and good to eat :-P. Decent ambience with a good service really makes it a worthwhile visit.

This is a must try out place  in kolkata . This mexican-american restaurant is in quest mall and very popular among youngsters who are eager to try out new places and cuisines and one will find it packed up usually in the evenings . First time  i went there when it was just opened with my father and sister and had their chicken steak and CHERRY  COLA (which one aught to try). Then again i went there one weekend with my sister and her friends for dinner last month . We ordered chicken tacos , thin crust pizza and shrimp pasta penne. They had the best tacos in kolkata. Pasta was just yummy and creamilicious. THIN CRUST PIZZAS , again a must try out here. Their trio fajitas are too good.
On my next visit i am planning to try their burgers and beef steak.

its a complete american style restaurant with a full of non vegetarian food...oh yea. Its a nirvana for american food lovers. hard core food from pork ribs to meaty burgers. i have visited this place 2 times. on my second visit i saw some changes in the menu. They have increased the number of vegetarian dishes. the bar is looks superb. love the wood finish all over this place. coming to the food they all taste great, the chilli soup is worth trying, just the way i like. nachos and burger both taste great. but the show stopper for me was the brownie. loved it. the prices are a bit on higher side specially after taking all the taxes.

The prwan basket was very nice, the torture sauce was exceptionally well blended, the prawns were perfectly cooked and was very juicy.  The same was with the shrimp pasta, nice blended, perfectly cooked and was very juicy. Its a mouth watering treat that you will remember for some time. The budget definitely fits in well when we look at the quality of food and service. I am definitely going to be there again. Till then enjoy the food basket and the drinks. Cheers.

Located in the heart of the city quest mall best location.
Jumping on the food just shifting from all cuisines here is what you would desire and like.
Mexican, American & Italian style dipped in indain flavours just go in with great taste and amazing presentation of dishes just wow.
Price will be a factor to look in its expensive but the dishes carry a good quantity and it feels they do justice with our money.
Surely have to try this with friends and family with anyone . Do try it .

I am going to start this review by saying that I am very partial to Mexican food. I completely love it! Like the last time we started with a plate of Tripple Dipper which is the best starter here....honey mustard mayo...you're a star! The surprise of the evening was the piping hot bowl of chicken and mushroom soup..it was like a comforting hug. For the main course we had the newly introduced Mexican Enchiladas which came with sides of black beans and red pepper rice. It had the right amount of cheese and was quite delicious. For dessert it was the beautifully crafted Chocolate Molten Lava cake. The hot soft sponge with the cold vanilla icecream hit the spot. Perfect meal! :)

I've tried the Nachos overloaded with toppings, the BBQ Ranch Burger, the Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich with perfectly cooked slices of beef in it, among other dishes. My dad adds that it has the best Bloody Mary in the city. I'm going back here for every special occasion that I can possibly think of. I would recommend it. There will be no regrets.

Went today with a friend.Actually we had gone to Quest for some drinks at The Irish House.But,while we were coming down,we felt kinda hungry and went in.Being an early Friday evening,quite a few tables were empty.First, let me tell you, they have got the most professional,polite and awesome staff.Secondly the ambiance,decor and the overall appeal of the place really will make you wanna sit there forever.Now to business,I ordered a dish of Southwestern Chicken Pasta and my friend ordered a Cilantro Rice fresh Mex Bowl.And no words can describe the awesomeness of the food.Delicious and served with so much attention to detail, the dishes really were heavenly.Oh,and the chicken.B-E-S-T ever!!!!.Its a bit pricey but that is really not an issue given the level of service they provide.
I would have given 5.0 but the only downside is that the menu is kinda limited,for such a large and famous restaurant.
But,if you are looking for a good time,good meal and awesome evening out in the city of joy,Chili's is the place to be.Go enjoy people.Just make sure you make reservations for weekends.Those days can be very crowded.

I am absolutely in love with this place. A meat lovers delight but on the other hand serves lovely veggie food as well. The whole ambience is amazing and uplifting. The staff is outstanding and they are just world class. The taste and sound of this place will leave you wanting for more. I highly recommend this place. Be there to feel it.

We went there last night after having heard (and read) many good reviews of Chili's, and we were certainly not disappointed! We ordered a Tripple Dipper as an appetizer, Smoky Chipotle Chicken Fajitas and the Orleans Jambalaya as the main course and cheesecake and Molten Chocolate Cake for dessert. The menus all have pictures and descriptions of each item so it's easy to decide what you'd like off it. The Chicken Crispers and the Eggrolls (part of the appetizer) were delectable. Next, we were served the Jambalaya which was good (and spicy) but nothing exceptional; very little bacon had been added though the shrimp tasted excellent. We were served the veggies, dressings, and the Smoky Chipotle Chicken along with the tortillas and made the wraps ourselves after a waiter made one for us to demonstrate. The fajitas were really yummy. ¬†The cheesecake was ordinary and could have been tastier and creamier. The Molten Chocolate Cake was quite good. I'd rate the food 4.5/5; it was mostly delicious and had good quantity. The pretty decor made a pleasant ambiance (4.5/5) and the staff were friendly and served us very promptly (4.5/5). In a nutshell, great Mexican food and well worth a visit!

I wish I knew why people love this place and its food so much. To me, it feels like people are following some kind of trend that is new in the city. The portions are large, I'll give them that. But what use is that if your steak is hard enough to kill a man, your fries soggy and everything on the plate just a BAD combination of food. It is like the chef did not cook the food, he/she just put it on the fire until it wasn't raw anymore. The fajitas were a little tough to chew, but compared to the steak, it was fine. The decor was alright, but nothing great about it. All in all, Chili's was an experience I wish I hadn't experienced because I spent money on jaw-ache (from chewing tough steak).

I simply love this place, having been here numerous times.
On my visits so far, I have managed to try their cajun club chicken sandwich/ fish and chips/ classic fajitas/ grilled chicken burger¬†in seriatim with their taste.

The cajun club chicken sandwich is simply amazing. Its stuffed with chicken/cheese and fresh veggies, served with fries. Highly recommended.
Their fish and chips has a fresh authentic taste and is quite filling.
The classic fajitas was good but didn't appeal much to my taste buds.
The grilled chicken burger was lil bland and had a lemon flavour which I didn't like.
In desserts I have tried their cheese cake and find it too sweet for my taste and the strong vanilla flavour overshadows the real taste.
I love their mango shake which is a delight to have!

Well Chili's never dissatisfied me. Today it was my 4th visit and as usual I enjoyed my food completely.

In Appetizers we took Country Fried Calamari. It was nice and crispy, the way it should be. Then we ordered for Blackened Fish and Grilled Tenderloin. Blackened Fish was nice whereas the later dish didn't impress me a lot. Tried it for the second time but it seemed it's not a dish for me. In past I tried Trio Fajitas and Chipotle Pesto Chicken Pasta in white sauce and both were simply yum. The best pasta I had in Kolkata.

Ambience wise it's good if you are getting a window seat otherwise it has a decor of simple western country side eatery. Another nice thing about this place is that the staffs are really warm which just adds to your "good-food" experience.

If you haven't been there yet please go. You won't regret.

My favorite place in Kolkata! I keep going there time and again for the great energy this place emanates.
Food: Chili's serves the best Tex-Mex cuisine in the city. Special mention about the tacos and the triple dipper. The classic Nachos are a must-try as well. As for the drinks, I love their Margaritas which is served in huge glasses and taste like heaven. And if you are lucky enough, you might land yourself into one of their offers (buy 2 get one margarita free).
Ambience: Full of energy. If you are celebrating your birthday, the staff is sure to make it a memorable one. The music is great and the service is super fast.
Pocket pinch: A gastronomically delightful meal with alcohol would come to around 800 INR per person which is quite reasonable given the whole experience.

Thus was my first visit to Chili's.loved the decor and ambience of the restaurant.initially was a little displeased with the delayed staff service but the food compensated all o it.we had availed the happy hour and so we had the opportunity to get an extra drink..the margarita we had ordered was heavenly.the alcohol content in it was perfect!!!!we also ordered the tripple dippers appetizer which was equally good..Chili's had been the right in fulfilling my meat cravings.lastly we had honey chicken chipotle which was undoubtedly a feather to the crown.had a great first experience..would like to try some more dishes there in the near future..

Its a nice place to be at be it with family or friends. The ambience is good and food too. The good thing is they serve dishes that are not very famous in Kolkata. Starting from the appetizers to drinks all are good. The quantity is also quite a lot so of you are looking up the menu n thinking it is an expensive place then it is actually not. I was not even able to finish my meal and had absolutely no place for desserts. My favorite in the menu is the triple dip chicken starter. The salmon they serve is also amazing.

Chilli's is another one of those overrated restaurants in Kolkata which fails to match the standards of 'decent' food. Firstly, I thought serving water to a customer is the basic etiquette of any restaurant. We ordered a chicken ranch burger and a Chipotle pesto chicken pasta. Both were utter disappointments. The burger was no different from a KFC burger (much cheaper) in terms of flavours and ingredients used. The pasta was really bland. I fail to understand why the chefs of such renowned restaurants forget to put an ingredient named pasta seasoning into the pastas. It just felt like boiled pasta put into a mixture of tomato puree and onions. The chicken was just okayish. Could've been made to taste a LOT better. If you cannot prepare an item the way it should be, might as well remove it from your menus. It'll help you from losing out on customers. If you're trying to be innovative with the flavours of your items, make sure it's worth the price and conduct a food testing session before actually putting it on the menu. Above all, serve food with love. The warmth was something that lacked so much in here. Do not treat a restaurant as a mere business. Chilli's for me and my friends was a huge let down. Definitely not worth a second visit. Do look into the matters mentioned above and try improvising. Lastly, treat your customers with care. A hint of love goes a long way!

One of the finest ambiences I've seen around here. The menu's good and variant, but didn't feel the love there :( The burgers were too bland and not so special... And the arrangement of threw items on the plate was very lousy. Moreover, worst part of the afternoon - no water was served. Should have been a mistake on the part of the staff, but these things aren't well received. The place looked very promising, but sadly let this foodie down. Better luck next time I guess :)

The window view of this place is to die for, especially if you happen to visit around sunset like I did.
The food is spectacular without a benefit of doubt. Cannot have enough of their southern fried chicken, with corn on the cobs. The molten chocolate cake was the best I have had till date. But the Pasta was slightly bland.

It's located at the 4th floor of quest mall. A very popular American-Mexican chain of restaurants. I have been to this outlet 3-4 times. Food is quite decent. The best thing of this restaurant is its margaritas. Chose any flavour or the classic one. All are simply WOW. Must say the best in city. Now they have an offer on margarita, you can get a free margarita with the order of 2, which is simply great. Country fried calamari goes really good with this poison. You can also try their triple dipper( combination of southwestern eggrolls, chicken crispers and chicken wings. As I don't like chicken wings always replace the wings with Texas cheese poppers) and shrimp basket though the fries come with the basket is not very crispy. In main course baked chicken in red pepper sauce is very good . Their newly introduced chocolate truffles cheese cake is very good. I am yet to taste  thier new inducted mex bowl. At last a nice place to hangout with great margarita and good food. Recommended.

Not worth the hype guys! The guacomoli burger(not sure ofthe spelling) sucked big time! Dont ever have that here! Triple dippers had a batter fried chiken(one they cook in stalls onthe road), bites of 4 chicken whch had some sauce which they called chiken wings which was bad! It also had some kinda roll whose name i am not intrested in knowing! But not all was bad , you can also find some avove avergae food here- like the chicken crispers which was comparitevely better than the rest! The drink was good! I had strawberry limesoda! But all in all the food wasnt worth the hype or price!

Have been visting this place frequently for quite some time now..and as such have tried most of their dishes. For starters my absolute favourite would have to be "classic nachos" and "fried calamari". The nachos is undoubtedly the best I have ever had..they are warm and crispy with molten cheese on top.. you just never want them to get over! For the main, nothing beats the good ol' "smoky chipotle chicken fajitas". Then there is the "chicken ranch burger", "crispy honey chipotle chicken crispers" and "mergharita flat bread pizza"..all of which are worth trying.
The tacos and quesadillas here are good as well, though I didn't like the enchiladas much. Haven't tried any of their pastas or the newly introduced fresh mex bowls yet, so can't comment on them. Be wary of the flavoured iced teas they serve..not all of them taste good. Service is fast and the staff is really friendly. Arguably the best place to try American-Mexican cuisine in Kolkata.

Chili's is a restaurant I have been frequenting almost since the day it opened doors.... Some how reviewing it never occurred to me....
Having said that... I found myself with a friend on a scorching summer afternoon within the comfort of the ranch like interiors of Chili's. The Presidente Margarita and the Mojo-Rita were delivered to the table and we were delivered from the heat.... And like the icing on the cake.... You get a free Margarita of your choice on ordering two... We sampled the Watermelon one... And that too was deliciously refreshing! Now for the food.... In my opinion the Country Fried Calamari is by far the best served in town partnered with two delicious dip.... So that was ordered and polished off.... The chicken breast in a peppery sauce served with a spicy Caribbean inspired rice and broccoli was amazing... The chicken succulent and the made to perfection..... The pepperoni pizza (9")... Yes we are gluttons.... Was delicious too... With two cheeses which was the added bonus .... The only complain I can make is that the pizza base was a little doughy for me... Though my friend loved it and polished off the ones I had discarded!!!
Oh.... Though we didn't order theses on this visit but.... My all time favourite remains Baby Back ribs in BBQ sauce and New Orleans Jambalaya..... Yum... Do try them if you haven't already... The triple dipper is a dapper too!!! But I miss the 5dipper they were serving during the cricket world cup.... I hope that returns to the menu...
I never have desserts at Chili's for I love to savour the scrumptious meal... Each time I visit.... :)

Though a bit expensive but Chili's is an awesome place for fine dining. The Ambiance was perfect combined with the Wow quality Mexican food. We ordered the tenderloin steak, chicken quesadillas with rice and black bean, blue pacific margarita, cheesecake and paradise pie. The drink was outstanding so were the quesadillas, crisp and tasty. But I didn't like the buffalo meat steak. We asked for a medium rare steak but was scarely done,if done at all! Didn't prefer the raw taste and should have chosen for a more well done version. Cheesecake was flat but the paradise pie was out of the world. Loved it. Will definitely visit again for their fajitas and triple dippers and burgers and more....

I went to Chili's for the first time, for lunch with a couple of friends on a Sunday afternoon, and was pleasantly surprised because I'd expected a larger, louder crowd. We ordered a fairly generic meal of a burger, pasta and a cheese balls. The server was courteous and calmly pointed out the intricacies of each dish we enquired about (the cuisine being alien to us.) The food was tasty, but costlier than you'd expect. Go only if you're acquainted with the Mexican cuisine and know what to order. The restaurant's location is convenient, as lunch or dinner is an easy decision for shoppers/movie-goers at Quest, thanks to Chili's.

My second review. 
Everything great as usual but this time wanted to celebrate a friends anniversary on the spur of the moment and approached one of the manager type guys but the said personnel could not come up with any idea as to how to make it special. If he couldn't do a cake then at least suggested we pop open a bubbly with some simple flute deco...be imaginative guys...people are anyways spending at your place ...no one would mind shelling out a couple of extra grands so long the moment is made special.
FYI - the Spanish song routine for birthdays is getting a bit old.

A rating of 4.4 on zomato made me visit Chili's and I had very high expectations. After reading few of the reviews I decided to order Triple dipper and Ranch burger for appetisers. 
Triple dipper was way too oily,  and the taste mediocre ( or it seemed so to me because of the oil content ). The Ranch burger was nice but I wouldn't say it was great. The two dishes however were very filling and we (3 of us) did not have any space in our stomach for the mains.
A special mention goes for the Paradise pie, which definitely stole the show- a true winner. 
I would like to visit Chili's again in future to have the main course :p

OVerhypedis the word that will describe this place. 30 mins of waiting, it takes them 10 mins to get u a glass of water and unfriendly service. TOo casual approach, waiters squatting and bending in front of ur tables to take orders, just goes against the principle of hospitality. Dry nachos and dry red pepper chicken is what we got. THe mocktails tastes similar and harldy i could identify the difference and add to that a 10% service tax makes ur experience even shitty

Great place to hang out and indulge your taste buds in Mexican cuisine. Although the menu can leave your hungry brain in tangles regarding what to eat,for a first timer,one should try the qeusadillas,fajitas and  gulp them down with a beer or a margarita.

This is a well known brand there in the United States specially for its mexican delicacies. And this one at quest has really kept that standard of food. Wonderfully decorated with the vibe of a perfect hangout for brunch or evening snacks. Bored with the bririyanis and kebabs and still wanna try out non veg.this is the place to be. U get both alchohols and non alchohols with perfectly blended mocktails. And most importantly do try out turkey here and the mexican foods for which it is so well known.

Fantastic decor and an amazing ambience! This place is a must go for any foodie in Cal. The servers crouch down beside your table while taking your order which just makes it so warm and adds a personal touch to the whole experience. 

The Food! Been to this place so many times and i always order something new (the menu is very vast). For the appetizers try the Triple Dipper. Chicken wings, fried chicken patty and egg rolls make this up and the dips are truly mouth watering. Had also ordered chicken nachos which i regretted later as they became soggy. But good in taste. You cannot miss the honey chipotle chicken, the baby back ribs, the tenderloin steak, blackened salmon and just try one of their big mouth burgers if you dare! 

And do not, i repeat, DO NOT miss out on the Paradise Pie for dessert. 

Chili's is truly a one of a kind place and a must for the Cal Foodie!

Located in the posh Quest Mall, this Mexican-American happening place is one such place I have visited so many times that I have lost count.
Beautiful lively decor!¬†
Amazing friendly service.
A whole lot of options. You are spoilt for choices.
In the drinks menu they have all sorts of alcoholic drinks as well as non alcoholic including coffee based drinks.¬†
1)Cold Coffee-Nice
2) Mocktails- Pretty good
3)Beers, Gin, Vodka you can choose from the menu.
4)The best-Presidente Margarita ! It is heavenly. Blend of tequilla , brandy and Cointreau ! (Y)
¬†
Coming to the food menu: I have tried more than half the stuff but I have got my favourites.
1)In appetizer, Triple Dipper is a good option since you get three types of appetizers in it of which Chicken Crispers are amazing and my favourite.

2) Smoky Chipotle chicken Fajita- It melts in your mouth. The chicken is cooked to perfection and the tortillas are soft. You get salad, cheese along with it.

3)Classic Steak Fajita (My brother's absolute favourite) - He never eats anything else when he's at Chili's.

4) Crispy Chicken Tacos- I still feel hungry at the thought of it. Soft tacos filled with crispy chicken and salad and dip! Yummmm!

5)Grilled Tenderloin Steak: You need to have this here . The perfect steak!

6)Monterey Chicken, Grilled chicken Platter,Country fried chicken crispers: Dishes that are wholesome. You get the chicken, the dip, the vegetables, rice, potato, fries ! Absolutely fulfilling and yumlicious!

I have the burger, salad in my list next! Though my favourites take all my attention away every time I go there! Lol.

So with the alcohol charges, the bill in the end can be a little heavy but the food amount and taste are so fulfilling you wont mind it that much.

Recently went to Chili's. It was a pleasant experience! We ordered:
3 mugs of coke (Bottomless)
1 plate of Fried Calamari.
1 plate of a pasta dish (I don't exactly remember the dish but it had 'chicken' and 'southern' in its name).
Starting with the ambience, Chili's hits the nail. A typical upmarket American bistro, it has very prompt service too. Now coming to the food, the fried Calamari was absolutely delicious. Crispy, hot and succulent (and not chewy at all) it ticked all the boxes. Next came the pasta. The pasta was pretty average and couldn't maintain the standards that the calamari had already set. Not moderately priced, our bill came to be 1386. However, I'll go back to Chili's because its plush yet warm ambience makes it perfect for a 3-hour long adda and OFCOURSE for its fried calamari. Do not miss that. DO NOT.

What I loved about Chillis is the way they serve. The restaurant is a little cramped but the service is good. Fast and neat. Very good Mex and Italian food and hence. I could not miss it... Went there few months back and wish I could go there again...
So, for ambiance, I would give 4 on 5, service gets 5 on 5 from me and so does the food!

Go Mexican, after trying it's Delhi counterpart, this was a happy opening in Kolkata. For people who want to experiment go ahead and enjoy your share of ribs. We ordered the Cajun Club Sandwich, order this if you are really hungry, one of this and you don't even have space to gulp down a bottle. This is too filling. If tortillas are your thing, go for the go for the tortilla crusted chicken. Amazing texture to the dish. For the appetizer, I would recommend the Tripple Dipper or classic Nachos. And ohh, really difficult to finish off the cheesecake post all this, but you don't want to miss it either !

This place deserves a 10 star rating. According to me chili's is the best mexican/ american/ italian restaurant in the city. I'm greatly thankful to my friend who urged me to step inside chili's. I had previously thought the prices to be too high and so never dined here. But actually i discovered the prices are not that high. I visited this place last sunday afternoon with my group of foodie friends after watching a movie at quest.

The ambience is pleasing. They have provisions for both family dinner as well as for having some drinks with friends. The menu card was quite attractive. I was not quite knowledgeble about american food but the menu card had details and pictures of almost all the items on the menu which helped us selecting the best items. The waitor who attended us was courteous and suggested some of the special dishes of chili's. Our order was placed quiet quickly.

The items we ordered were:

1. Chicken ranch burger- the size of chicken was double the size of the bread. There were fresh vegetables and every bite had an awesomeness. It was served with french fries.

2. Veggie ranch burger- There was a veg patty inside the bun and some fresh vegetables. I dint taste it so im not writing about its taste.

3. Classic nachos- It was very good. Every nacho had a cheesy tasty and the sauce was also good

We wanted to try the tripple dipper but we hadnt tried the menu course. So we kep it for our next visit.
We were full after having the starters. So for main course we ordered:

1. Blackened salmon- This was recommended by the waitor and indeed it was great. There was a huge salmon fillet garnished with sauce and served with spinach and flavoured rice. We all jumped into the dish and finished it in no time. Such tasty it was !!

2. Fajita trio- It had fajita along with grilled chicken, steak and shrimps. I previously had grilled chicken sizzler at peter cat but the taste of this dish is superior to it by many times.

Since the waitor suggested us to try some desserts, we ordered:

1. Cheesecake- It was served with a strawberry sauce and every bite was full of flavour.

2. Chocolate chip paradise- As they say "all is well that ends well" - this tagline goes with the dish. It was too good. We wanted to have another one but we were running short of money. There was a vanilla ice cream over a layer of walnut and choco chips. The ice cream was garnished with hot chocolate fudge and caramel :)

I loved each and every item i had. I never had such a great experience in any restaurant. I feel like tasting each and every item on the menu. :D

Went to the Quest Mall outlet a couple of times. Love the superfast service. The food is great. If you are a newbie who doesn't like pork or beef/buffalo, try out the Chicken Fajitas. They taste great! Those of you who thrive on Pork.. must have the baby back ribs with a side of potato mash.

An excellent place. As we were planning to have some diferent kind of dishes, we choose to go there on Jamai Sasthi, with my mother and husband. In our opinion-

Ambiance - 4/5
The restaurant was divided¬† into dinning section and a bar counter. Every thing has a comfortable casual look. But the sitting arrangement was a little congested, will give you a cafe like feel..¬† But the music they play was very good.

D√©cor - 3.5/5

Stuff - 4.8/5
Stuff who attended us, was very helpful and well mannered. generally all stuff were very prompt in service and always happy to help. They will certainly help you in choosing your dish.

Food - 5/5
We ordered Blue pacific margarita (without alcohol), Strawberry Lemonade, Triple dipper, Blackened Salmon with shrimps, Grilled Tenderloin, Baby back ribs with classic BBQ sauce and Cheese cake.
Each and every dish we ordered was great, but the Baby back ribs with classic BBQ sauce was really amazing. 

Both the blue pacific margarita (without alcohol) and Strawberry Lemonade was excellent. the decoration of those drinks were too inviting.

Blackened Salmon was soft, tasty and full of flavours. it comes with cheese dip, tossed rice, baked tomatos. We took shrimps as add ons.

The triple dipper consists of chicken wings, chicken crisper and south-western egg roll comes with three different dippers, except the chicken wings all other items were very good, but the chicken wings were little over fried and stiff.
The tenderloin was little stiff and hard to cut.

Cheese cake was OK. But there is definitely a scope of enhancement in this dish. Because we have tasted better cheese cakes at other places (Have it from 'The coffee bean & tea leaf' or 'Cookie Jar' or 'Crazy for chocolates' they are outstanding).

But recently 'Chili's' has introduced a Chocolate truffle cheese cake, it looks mouth watering, I'll surely try this one next time I go.

Value for money - 3.9/5
Though food was great, the price was little inclined to the higher side. Say, if your order amount worth 3000 bucks you also have to pay another 1000 bucks for tax,vat, service charge etc. !

Overall this place is wroth trying. Amazing food with nice stuff will welcome you. But have your wallet full...

In short : if you haven't been, go NOW!

Now for the long version, chili's without a doubt has the best american cuisine in Calcutta. It may seem pricy but it's worth every penny. You get what you pay for, which is excellent quantity and quality of food. I don't think I've ever visited any restaurant as many times as I've been here! ( apart from bar b q!)
Having been here a dozen times I've tried almost every single thing on the menu! They're all delicious! The only disappointing dish for me was the triple dipper. The tacos i feel could have better quantity, and the fish and chips is sometimes a hit and miss! Apart from that, it's all golden!

My favourites would definitely be the honey chipotle chicken, country fried crispers, calamari rings, baby back ribs, boneless wings, nachos, cheese poppers!
I could go on and on! Also fantastic, are the salads( esp the barbeque chicken) , burgers, fajita trio, blackened salmon.

You really can't go wrong with whatever you choose to order!

Even if there place is empty it always has such a fun vibe to it! It's definitely my go to place to eat !

Chili's will spoil you if you're willing to shell out cash. It gives you a American deli meets Mexican hang out kind of a feel. The food and the quantity will not disappoint you.Recommended: Baby back ribs if you're going all out. The Montery Chicken with wrapped bacon is delicious. Pick the Chicken Crispers if you're in the mood to share it with others at the table. Fajita sizzlers if you want to try out new and fun things.

Thumbs up: Good deal on beer and burgers if you hit the happy hours. ( Personal shout out for the pitcher glasses that they serve you beverages in. )

P.S : Hit early if you're going for Sunday lunch or you'd have to wait for seating!

I have been planning to visit the place for a long time, since I love their Singapore outlet and been there few times. They do have a long queue on wkends but if you can manage on bar stools, you may get the seats on arrival. I liked the overall ambience, the not so loud music and the polite and helpful staffs. We asked for the recommendation and they happily helped us. The Mexican food was good as everywhere and we tried chicken ranch burger, quesadillas arroz con queso. Overall a nice place to be with your friend and family and have a good time. Thumbs up for them.

Ambience is something that reminds you of the american bars. Mexican food is worthy of praise. I had a $3 molten chocolate shake and it was smooth and exactly the same as everywhere. The quesadillas and arroz con queso were maravilloso. A long queue is not such a problem if you can sit on the bar stools. Its not mandatory to have alcohol if you are on the bar stools. The music is actually billboard top 100 playing but too much of chatter to hear it. You have to strain your ears to catch a tune you might like. They dont pump up the music and that allows one to have a nice easy conversation. So thoughtful! Oh and the knives are really sharp. I propose the management to ditch the serrated saw teeth knives with some rather blunt ones that suffice to only cut a burger. Any fine day someone may erupt with a bout of alcohol and use the knife on anyone. The world is getting crazier by the day. Better safe than be sorry! :P Ohh and I liked the way they kneel down to take your order. Kingly treatment! Staff is super polite and bang on with their suggestions as everywhere else in the states too. Thanks for keeping it up...Here's to you....

To sum it up, you cannot help not returning to this place. Amazing food and great service. The items worth trying out are the tripple dipper, calamari rings, the Cajun club turkey sandwiches, pork ribs in barbeque sauce and the mini burgers. To wash these down, the long island iced tea is great; alcohol is very reasonably priced here, especially if one can order them during the happy hours, which are until 8 pm. Went there all the way from Salt lake three weekends in a row. I really hope they soon come up with more outlets, especially near Salt lake.

Wanna taste some mouth watering and impressive American or Italian delicacies? Head straight to this food joint in Quest Mall, Park Circus ( with a fat wallet or credit card ;) ) . Being a meat lover by heart, loved this restro the first time when it offered me with its exquisite collection of beef/lamb/chicken dishes!! Each one had a taste of its own!¬†

To name a few:

The Triple Dipper: Mind blowing starter! Just the perfect thing to ignite your hunger engine!(after which there is no stopping! ) .. Consisting of three amazing appetizers : the chicken wings, the egg wrap and the crispy chicken! ¬† ¬†

The Texas Cheese Poppers: ¬†A delight for cheese lovers. Bursting cheese inside with crunchy exterior!¬†

Classic Stake Fajita: Had better steak before, but this one had a class of its own.¬†

Grilled Tenderloin Steak: ¬†Yes! Did justice to this famous dish! But when it comes to beef steak I set the goals pretty high! :) .. so 7/10 to this dish from my side.¬†

Chicken Ranch Salad: One friend of mine ordered this! He liked it, but complained it was loaded with too much veggies! A bit less would have made the dish perfect!

Grilled Chicken Burger: Taste - splendid! But the size! Oh My! U can't expect and american burger to be so TINY! Yes! It was ! They should seriously increase the size of their burgers! Specially when its priced at almost 400 bucks!!!¬†

Southwestern Chicken Pizza: ¬†One of the best pizzas I ever had! Loaded with fresh toppings, chicken cubes and creamy cheese! A captivating experience !

The interior is nice, gives a feel of an american food joint! Staffs are courteous and friendly! Great place to go with friends as well as with family!¬†

Pocket pinch definitely on the higher side! The taxes on their food and alcohol is outrageous! We ended up paying a whooping 800 bucks tax on a bill of 2200 !!¬†

Overall, a great place to enjoy american or Italian cuisines provided you have fat wallet!¬†

Food: 4/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service:4.5/5

One of my favourite restaurants of recent times. Although I only tried a couple of dishes off the menu, I am craving to try more. I am sure I'll love them as much as I loved the ones I had. The ambience, the food, the staff make Chili's an amazing dining experience, one that you want to revisit over and over again.

Went to Chilis about a month back just before the Bengali New Year.. This was our 3rd time at Chilis and we are totally in love with the place.. The ambience is just awesome.. We were given a table beside the big glass wall overlooking the food court of Quest. But somehow I wasnt comfortable with the table coz it was feeling eerie that people walking outside would be able to see what we are eating (I know it sounds stupid but it was making me extremely uncomfortable). So we requested the waiters to shift us to a table that is not adjacent to the glass wall. He responded to our request very politely and gave us a table on the other side that became available next even though the place was very crowded & it was the peak lunch hour on a weekend.. We thanked him coz this is what good service is all about- making your customers comfortable and happy.. Very happy with the service coz it added on to our overall enjoyment.. and yes, I am sure I am not the only one to say it that the ambience of the place is just awesome..

Coming to the food, we ordered a Tortilla Crusted Chicken, a Cilantro Rice Fresh Mex Bowl (chicken) and a Strawberry Lemonade.. The Tortilla Crusted Chicken is one of the best dishes that we have ever had.. It was heaven on a plate.. the Fresh Mex Bowl was also light, fresh and tasty - a perfect dish for the summer.. & the Strawberry Lemonade was the perfect accompaniment.. It was a great meal for the two of us.. I am salivating even while writing down this review ;)

The only downside is the pocket pinch. It is a bit high, but the food surely makes up for it.. once in a while, you can surely visit this place and enjoy a scrumptious meal.. Looking forward to our next visit :)

-------------------------------------------------------------
Updated:-

In my next few visits, I had tried the following..

Classic Nachos - very tasty. Each individual nacho is quite big in size and comes with a layer of cheese. Both the veg and chicken versions are very good.

Crispy Chicken Tacos - this comes with side portions of black beans, sour cream and salsa. You can either opt for soft flour tacos or crispy corn tacos. I have had the crispy corn ones and they are quite tasty, especially when paired with the sides.

Chicken Crispers - around seven pieces of chicken with a crunchy batter coating. The crispers are very succulent and tasty, but a bit oily, and I can have a maximum of two during a particular meal. A good dish which can be shared easily. It comes with fries, which are okay, and a corn on the cob. And I have to say this, their buttery corn on the cob is one of the juiciest and best corn I have ever had. It is quite big to be handled in a restaurant, but if you dig into it shamelessly, you will definitely love it.

Orleans Jambalaya - spicy (little bit, not too much) mexican rice with a generous amount of veggies, chicken and prawns. The prawns were extremely plump and succulent. Tasted good.

Chocolate Chip Paradise Pie - an awesome dessert. Love it more because of the nuts and the caramel drizzle.

Basically, Chili's is one of the top choices when I am craving for Mexican food.

Well, how do I pen down what I just experienced. It has to be an essay. So this would be the perfect time to scroll away if you don't have patience.

1. This place is known for its friendly staff, Zomato said. And you could totally take it upon their word about this.

2. Huge beer mugs. Right on. Huge and heavy.

3. Chicken Wings. Tasted the way it should. That is, great.

4. Pork Ribs with barbecue sauce. The best ribs I've ever had. Ever. Must have. Do not step out without having these.

5. Santa Fe Salad (chicken). This would be the third time I've had a salad at a restaurant and this has to be the best. Recommended.

6. Cheesecake. How do I describe this. I'm going to make a series of guesses here and I might be totally off the fact. It has a hard base that seemed like honey, but probably wasn't. The cake itself tasted kind of like vanilla, but probably didn't have any vanilla essence. I wanted the cake to last forever. It tasted HEAVENLY, and I meant to press the capslock. Another thing you mustn't skip. Highly recommended. If I could, I would make everyone have it at gunpoint.

All in all, there isn't a better place I've been to in Kolkata. Also worth mentioning is the huge variety in the menu. Definitely worth checking out.

I was here a few week back and I was really happy and satisfied with this place. Located in the food court of Quest mall this is the perfect place to spend your evening and dinner.
Coming to the ambiance, ChIlli's is moderately lit with well decorated sofas and cutlery.
The staffs and waiters are really nice and would guide you throughout. You just need to tell your choice and they would select you the perfect dish for you.
Now.. the food.. you will find some awesome stuffs out here. I came with a friend of mine and thus could'nt try much. We settled for 1 triple dipper, 1 smokey chicken fajita and mago refreshner. Mango refreshner was too good with a large glass. Triple dipper as known to all , the signature dish of chill's need no introduction amd everyone is just a fan of it. I liked the fajita too.
The service was really quick.. There was a birthday girl in the house that day and the waiters sang and celebrated for her like anything. Really liked the way they made all of it. I would live to be back at chilli's and try more of their dishes.

Before going into the food, just wanted to say something. The waiters , they kneel down on the floor to take your order and thats their custom. So yeah " you did nothing wrong ". Thats just introduction to this weirdly good resturant. Now the food.. Well we went there as a group and had -The Fajitas Trio, The Country Fried Chicken and one of my friends had the weird idea of trying the buffalo and bacon burger. The Fajitas trio is a combo of grilled chicken and prawns with layers of cheese and caramelised shallots. The shallots were a bit sweet to my taste but thats hardly anything. The cheeses kill it.. then the Country fried chicken is a whole piece of chicken breast off the bone crispy fried with layers of cheese sauce( yeah right ) with a side of mashed potates and a corn on the cob. Finally the Buffalo burger. No need to get creeped out, cause it wasn't as weird as it sounds. Or may be the bacons did it for me. I will let you be the judge of that. Finally to the atmosphere . It gives you a very authentic pub like air with the whole brick layout walls and stall setups for sitting. All in all, a must try for all foodies.

Located inside the Quest mall, Chilli's has a modern d√©cor and a youthful vibe. I went there for lunch and was warmly greeted at the entrance. The service was prompt and friendly throughout. The menu card is nicely designed with attractive pictures. 

Now I come to the main thing, the food. I asked for the pork ribs with BBQ sauce. The meat was indeed tender and tasty. But I feel that the dish is way overpriced. One can find similar dishes at similar upmarket restaurants in Kolkata at half the price. The dessert, chocolate chip paradise pie, was also quite good.

Overall a nice experience, but the management needs to look at the pricing of some of the dishes.

Located in the only luxury mall of Kolkata, if you love continental (Mexican or Italian) this is the place to be. The ambience is pretty good but found the service a bit sloggish. But, this really jiggles up your taste buds. And yes, how can I forget, the gigantic beer mugs....if you are ready to pop out some cash and love continental, this is THE place to be!

I went in for a dinner with high hope but it turns out to be a damp squib. For a premium ¬†price the service was seriously lacking.The erroneous choice of cutleries were really shameful as steak knives were given out to be used with even nibblers.

Three heads ordered ¬†the "roasted red pepper chicken/ ¬†blackened fish/ tortilla crusted chicken " ¬†and we were awfully disappointed with the portions offered.

The selection of beer looks good but except "Carlsberg" they had nothing to offer which was a let down.

I am sorry but this place cannot hold a candle in front of any half decent eatery.

The cocktail tasted good not too bitter while the veg mix bowl also tasted good. The staffs are friendly and service is swift. Overall had a cool experience:)

Our favorite, FAVORITE joint!

The Philly cheese steak sandwich is to die for. The tenderloin can be improved upon. The baby back pork ribs just melts in your mouth.

The fajita trio holds an array of fish and meat for you to indulge in. All in all, an excellent place. The martini's served here are good as well. MUST TRY.

One must try the Country Fried Calamri and the Triple Dipper, they are heavenly. A bit pricy, but definitely worth it! Oh and yes for dessert, Chocolate Truffle cheese cake ;)@

..and this is one of the better places in Kolkata if you expect to have the best quality food not considering your pocket.

The best in class continental and American food they've ever served in Kolkata with this amazing ambience.

What we had was a Triplet for starters which included three different appetizers with the perfect taste and flavors served with three types of dips. 

As of the main course, we had a dish which was served with some buttery rice topped with saucy fried thick slice of chicken which was a pretty heavy thing for both of us to finish. The taste and make was beyond expectations. It was perfect. 

Lastly, came our desert and trust me, that's where I simply had to bow down to whoever made it. We had a "Cheese cake" and probably the best I could ever have. That taste, with perfect layers, the beautiful blend and the perfect dense material. Everything was just too good in it. 

P.S. The bottomless glass of Coke is something I didn't expect to see here in Kolkata. But that surely would give me another reason to mark this place as my favourite.

Chili's: *Firstly, it is a very special place for me as I met few very lovely people of my life here.*

This is a place which is happening, peppy music with good food right inside the quest mall. Ambience is very uber and cool. Staff courtesy is pleasant. It has fantastic american dishes to provide. Well ordered for Classic nachos, Boneless chicken wings, Cajun club chicken sandwich and Cherry cola... Everything I wanted was there in my sandwich. It do gives a pinch to your pocket but one can give it a try.

Thank you

I jumped on the opportunity to eat here while in Kolkata.Haven't eaten at tis places in years.Ordered the full rack of ribs. Sadly, it wasn't beef/bison ribs but they had pork instead and, in all honesty, that's as good. Tender and fall-off the bone.There must have been about 5 pieces. It looked small (the whole slab), but they were definitely chunky (definitely not as much as beef/bison), but superb nonetheless. Came with a blob of mashed potatoes. Sad thing here is that they only give 1 side with your meal. That's very strange cause usually you get 2 or 3.My friend tried some dish of the day which consisted of a full chicken leg (marinated in possibly rosemary or something like that) on a bed of veggies and a bit of pilaf rice. He said it was great as well.Definatly not too great on the price though. Rs.2,000 for a full rack ??¬†That's the price of most decent buffets when compared to a single dish.¬†Rather hard to digest. But still, worth it if you're going to be eating like a pig once in a while.

One of d posh looking lounge-bar cum restaurant in town .they serve mediterranian dishes as well as europian and american dishes. D hosts r always warm and happy to help.on Monday and tuesday they offer 1+1on indian

We were there to celebrate my beloved's birthday and we ended up ordering country fried calamari,orleons jambalaya,steak, brownie sundae, peach daiquiri ,mocha martini and corona beer.d journey through the food was incrediably awesome.d calamari was crispy and sour-salty and melted in our mouth. D pork in jambalaya was so juicy and soft tht it actually felt like pieces of cheese.d beer was cold and d martini and daiquiri tastes good.we wud always like to come back to d place

Nice, loud food. The food that you need when you want to "paaaarttttyyyy". Mexican, spicy and not-at-all subtle, your plate will be colorful. The sizzlers, grilled stuff and the tacos.... I think it's the best you can get in town. One reason for which Chili's will have my gratitude is it introduced me to the beauty called Jagermeister. On a casual Sunday evening, you can make "a plate of tacos and a Jag-&-Coke" your top priority in the to-do list ( if you have a to-do list for Sunday :P ). The service is good. The music, very loud. Not a good place for a date. A rocking place for a band of college-goers. On a personal note, I won't encourage the decision of ordering desserts here. All in all, can't complain. ;)

Well...after fourth attempt we finally landed up at this eatry which has recently created buzz in the city. We were a troop of five gourmets who can push any barrier to pamper their's taste buds. The food joint looks enormous in size , considering the fact that this resides at the top floor of the poshest mall in city. Getting inside, will instantly give you a feel of quintessential Tex-Mex restaurant. Illumination is perfect for dinning. Decor will remind you of a western eatery that you often come across in Hollywood movies . The waiters are very courteous.
Now, let's get into serious business...I'm not sure, how many eateries are there in the city which serves such authentic tex-mex dishes (They also serves Italian but we didn't try) . We had ordered 5 dishes of appetizer and 4 main courses...these were accompanied by cocktails as well... My poison for the evening, was Mojito. They made it simply awesome...I believe, the ingredients were so aptly blended that it tasted heavenly refreshing. Now, talking about food... on our table , we had ... Orleans Jambalaya,BBQ Chicken salad, Boneless chciken wings, Crispy honey chipotle chciken crisper, Roasted red pepper chicken,Blackened Salmon, Smoky chipotle chicken fajita, Citrus fire chicken & shrimp, roasted red pepper chicken... All of these are palatable. However, you just can't afford to miss the following...
‚äô Blackened Salmon
‚äô Citrus fire chicken & shrimp
‚äô Smoky chipotle chicken fajita
‚äô Crispy honey chipotle chciken crisper
After treating my taste buds with all of these delectable delicacies, my sweet tooth were craving for some cheese cake or brownie but unfortunately my stomach seemed to be reluctant ... Never mind ... on my next visit, I'll keep some space reserved for desserts üòú

The best Tex-Mex in town! As soon as u enter you get transported across the seas and feel like u have entered a quintessential american tex mex diner.

The menu heralds whats so great about this place. Scrumptious pictures confuse u and make u want to buy everything on the menu.

Love most of the food here so difficult to pick favourite dishes. For those who are hung up on their softdrinks, should try cherry cola. A varient offered by coca cola which is loved by warren buffett (i am a fan of his).

Word of caution: helpings are LARGE. Dont order too much.

Suggestions for improvements to management: try and reduce time taken from stove to table as much as possible. Food could have been hotter.

For Kolkata, Chili's sets a benchmark for others to live upto in tex mex. For food lovers, it offers a unique cuisine for people to fall in love with.

This place has a nice feel to it. It is located inside quest mall and I would think of it as a place I would visit for some nice food after a bout of shopping. 
The food is good, the portions are decent and the price is good enough. The hamburgers over here are really good and the bartender is one of the friendliest persons I've ever met. The servers are also extremely polite and all in all - this place is really really good.
P.S - the bartender on request whips up any drink you want and trust me he is really good.
Must-visit.

Chili's is one place I love to go to whenever m in the mood for some warm service with equally good food! Specially when I feel like quesadillas! ? The ambience takes u to the original chili's and it's a feel good kinda place! There r fewer options for vegetarians but wateva they prepare is upto the mark! Quesadillas with mushrooms n cheese tops my list! Followed by their nachos n fajitas!
The sodas are well made as well! I'm not too fond of their burgers since I find them okaish! Fries they serve are crisp! They do a good job with their desserts! :) so overall with the prompt service the dining experience is always great here! :))

It's been a long, long time since Chili's has been on my wishlist and am I happy to mark it off as 'been there'! It was a special occasion, which turned doubly special due to the incredible meal. However, I'm getting ahead of myself; here's the analysis. Upon entering we were greeted and guided to our table, which to my delight was a window seat. You have a great view from there, but sadly the curtains were drawn. I secretly wish to visit them once more in the evening while the curtains are open and you can see the city, but that's for later.¬†We started with starters (well, obviously). Ordered a plate of the texas cheese poppers for two, as we wanted to save space for the main course. Eight poppers are served in a plate, each roughly the size of a ping-pong ball. Now I know you're thinking that why would you want to shell out nearly 300 bucks for that. But the dish is every bit worth the money. The poppers are so tasty, that you can't help but sigh in delight every time you take a bite. Though the ranch dressing served with it could use a little less salt, but all in all it was delicious; which you probably got by now.¬†For the main course, we ordered one tenderloin steak each (we saved lots of space). They are served with garlic bread, and any two sides of your choice. We wanted the steaks not cooked rare, but not chewy either, so the waiter suggested a medium-well, which was perfect; soft and cooked at just the right proportions. As for the sides, the french fries were crispy and salty (as they very well should be), the mashed potatoes creamy and nice. Even though we had humongous appetite, towards the end it became a struggle to finish of the steak, so a whole steak is not for you if you're weak hearted. The steak might feel a little dry at times, but that's why they provide that bowl of gravy. To wash it down, we had beer and watermelon flavored virgin margarita (can't find that mocktails section on the zomato menu, probably it needs and update). The virgin margarita was a very different kind of drink, and definitely worth trying again. Even though by now we were almost close to bursting, you can not leave the table without having dessert (obviously!). So we ordered a chocolate chip paradise pie to share, and it was spoonfuls of heaven. The bottom layer was a cookie-like chocolate crust, the middle layer sponge cake, followed by a top layer of nuts and caramel. And it does not end there, because it's topped with more chocolate sauce and nuts and caramel and vanilla icecream. Also, even though I saw on zomato how it looks like, the portion was unbelievably huge. So you obviously get why you have to have that. It was nutty and chocolaty and crunchy at the same time and I've never had anything like that. The pocket pinch quite obviously turned out to be a little high, 2.5k for two people. But every item was absolutely value for money. In spite of all the words of praise, the place is not without cons:¬†One word. Service. Service should be a hell lot better, right now it's more comparable to a fast food chain than a high end restaurant. We had to keep asking them to clean the table after the starters were finished, but that never got done until the main course arrived. For a place which takes 10% just as service tax, we expect more. Also, the music is uncomfortably loud at times. However, all cons aside, I know I'm gonna go there again soon, because good food beats sucky service any day.

Had been waitng since a very long tym to visit this plc as i had a heard a lot of positive reviews fr this plc and upon my visist this plc didnt fail to dissapoint me at all.. Bng a weekend this plc was full and we had to wait fr 5 minustes to gt into the table.. The plc is really well done and it gvs a classy touch.. Cumng to the food we opted fr chicken ranch salad which was simply delicious with the right amount of lettuce, deep fried chicken, perfctly cut carrots, tomatoes sumthng crispy type chips which i fl it was either nachos or tortillas.. The salad was really well done.. I jst loved it.. Nxt cm the tandoori chicken burger which was grt too.. The chicken piece in it was huge too.. And the burger bun was soft.. It had lettuce and right amiunt of tomatoes.. The chicken was tasty too.. Loved the burger which came with huge chunks of french fries.. Fr drinks we ordered Non Alchoholic Margarita.. The margarita was good too.. I find it to b a perfct summery drink as it had lots of ice and the drink is not heavy too.. For desserts we ordered molten chocolate which was simply Divine.. It was one of the best molten chocolate tht i had eaten. The food out thr is grt.. The only thing which i didnt lyk was the container in which thy bought my drink.. It was too heavy.. I wud really appreciate if thy served in sum lighter container. Looking forward to visit this plc again!

For Birthdays .
For Family Dining.
For hangouts and booze parties.
For immediate meal after movie .

Yes, i prefer Chilli's anyday.
What if i say you're getting everything under a single roof? 

From family dining to dim light couple dates and beer in a bar, 
The perfect ambience you're getting here.

The plus points about chilli's are-
‚Ä¢ According to the quality and quantity of the food, the prices are not too much.
‚Ä¢ A single platter of triple dipper can make two of you full.
‚Ä¢ Cokes are served in big beer glasses . 
‚Ä¢ If its your birthday, you can blindly choose Chilli's for celebration because till you're done cutting your cake, the whole squad wont stop singing birthday song for you,  *Birthday goals*

Disappointments-
‚Ä¢ You may not like Fajita's because they smell horrible.
‚Ä¢ Cheesecake is not upto the mark.

Rest , Enjoy.

The presence of Chili's has been such a good news for all the foodies of the city and specially lovers of Tex-Mex like me :)
What hits me first about a place like Chilies is the typical American feel of the restaurant. Starting from the  wooden interiors to the the way the menu card is printed to the portion of the food being served and then down to the biig mugs in which your basic water is served. Everything is very American if you know what I mean. Starting from the waiters to the hostesses who take you to your table are very friendly and helpful. The waiters know their job very well and their suggestions are abs spot on.
Now to the food..this would be my 5 the time to Chili's and so by now I am quite well verse in the menu. The last time that were in the restaurant, we were 7 of us. The liquor menu was quite exhaustive and we chose beers(Budweisers) and spirits(Jack Daniels) to start off with. After a couple of rounds of these and once we were little spirited, we ordered 2 bottles of Shiraz to go with our meal.  
We always always have the Triple Dipper as the starters. So we ordered two baskets of of it. As always they came brilliantly tasty. The chicken wings were perfectly cooked and tasted perfectly tangy with the sauce that it was dipped in. The deep fried chicken pieces that always looks like mammoth size fish fingers also was fried to a golden perfection. Lastly the corn and the  bean stuffed and fried spring roll kinda thingy was also a delight to munch on.
Next on our table was the main course. Well I as usual chose the tenderloin served with fries and veggies on the side and I had asked for mushroom sauce to go with it. The meat was cooked to medium done and it tasted and heavenly....a sheer bliss for any meat lover all over the world.  I have had steaks and steaks as they say....this was amazing. Most of us chose steaks as the main course apart from one who had ordered a grilled chicken with veggies. Well I didn't get to taste the chicken cause I was horrible full by then. But my friend was full of praises regarding the quality of the meat and the brilliant way it had been grilled.
By then we were absolutely stuffed our selves and no way we could have had desserts. That means another trip to Chili's  is on the cards soon ;) Can't get enough of the place.

Not even once out of the 5 times that I have visited the Chili's fraternity, both in Kolkata and San Jose, have I had to return home disappointed and feeling dull. This diner is right up there for me. Value for money, if not more. Each time I've completed a meal at Chili's, I couldn't help but let go of a burp which makes you feel the best. We've had the Margaritas(Sometimes it was too addictive to only have one), the iced tea, mojito. Though the first time we visited here, they didn't have their alcohol license, but made up for it in leaps and bounds. We've tried the Chicken Pesto, which probably is the best-o. We've tried the burgers here which have tender meat and fresh dressings. We have tried the Tacos, which was standard. Also, do try the fajitas! Then comes my favourites, the Baby Back Ribs and the Grilled Tenderloin! I personally guarantee the amazingness for these two. The meat is made to order. I like the meat little on the less done side. This keeps it nice and tender and juicy! This makes it taste even better than it sounds right now. As for starters, you can try the Fried Calamari or the chicken wings. Classic american diner. Classic Yummy.¬†

And also, the classic Diner feel can only be brought by the staff working there. Not just the waiters, but the floor managers are amazingly helpful and very courteous. We have taken their suggestions often and it has never ceased to impress.

Cheers!

First n foremost no fixed timing makes this place a go-to esp for people like us who have odd working hours. Love the ambience as in not formal and non-stuffy. The decor gives u a vibe of just chilling out. Coming to food its definitely delicious . My fav being country style chicken with corn on cob. The assorted starter platter s also a steal. On days we r nt drinking we order bottomless pitcher. Cocktails are good bt can be improvised on. Overall good value fr money. The 10%service tax pinches u a bit bt the service I guess makes up for it

I have been to this place a few times... It's very nice if you can get inside.... There is always a long queue which tells you about the popularity of this place.... 
I love the tacos and the milk shakes.... But many love the other Mexican food...
Usually the place had a fast food ambience but it's quite nice and not as bad as a Mac.

Hi foodies!

This was my third visit to this awesome place. It was on 15th April (Bengali New Year).
The first thing I'll like to point out is that they show the same attention and earnest approach even on crowded days.
After we got our table, they gave us a new menu in which there were four new items. We tried one of them. (Chipotle Rice Fresh Mex Bowl, with Chicken)
The item was very well prepared. Each part of the dish had its distinct flavour. As usual, their chicken was very succulent.
The second item I tried was Crispy Fish Tacos. This was my first time tasting tacos and it was lovely! Although I found the preparation resembling that of a shawarma, their preparation of the Basa fish made up for that.
All in all, a highly enjoyable visit yet again.

Note: Pictures are provided for all the dishes I tasted here.

As an endnote, I would like to say that the only reason I'm not giving a full rating because I really feel their extra 10% service charge is a bit unnecessary.

-Bon Apetite.

Finally wanna share my experience about Chili's.  It's awsome place. The food is too good n so is the beverages. Love their burgers n  cocktails. 

I only wish they introduce some happy hours or 1:1 on alcohol like a irish house. I guess they can pull a lot more crowd that way.  The only thing I dont like is whenever we wish to have a table next to bar we never get it even when it's empty. God knows y. 
In spite of all these facts I love thr place.

As barney would say it,this place is legend-wait for it-dary...legendary!!! Awsome food...check..!! Lavish decor...check!! Incredible hospitality...check!!Value for money...check!! Satisfaction...double check!! This totally summarizes my experience in chili's. My maiden visit was just after it first opened and my next one was just a few months back. Undoubtedly,this is the best tex mex place in kolkata. Located on the fourth floor of the quest mall in beckbagan, chili's is one of its kind. The mexican food served here is simply unparallel. I would have given this place a 5, hands down,if it had not been for their tripple dipper. Though a very ensembled dish,this dish lacs completeness of taste. The chicken crispers and wings served are delicious but the southwestern rolls are very dry and tasted just average to me. But apart from this very tiny snafu,everything else here is flawless. The other dishes I had here are of top notch and kudos to the culinary experts over here. The choice of menu here is quite interesting. Among the small bites i have tried their chicken wings alone,and the dish was yummilaceous. The tangy taste along with the softness of the chicken wings blended perfectly inside the mouth. Among the main courses I have tried their tortilla crusted chicken and the blackened fish. The former dish deserves a high five for both its presentation and taste. I have never tasted this excellent level of crisp chicken. The crusted tortilla and the chicken on a bed of brocolli with rice was just a world of joy. But the show stealer was the blackened fish. This dish was a wow from the first to the last bite. The presentation of this dish was classy and the taste was impeccable and unmatched for. The fish and the prawns were just perfectly cooked and they just melted smoothly inside the mouth. The rice,the dip and veggies served along with the dish were equally delicious. Among the drinks,my favourite here is the long island ice tea,and any visit to chilis would be incomplete without it. The price of the food is at par with its quality and quantity. Overall, this place has an exqusite choice of foods and drinks and I really hope they keep up the good work and maintain their standard in the future. I would highly recommend this place for all the foodies out there!! As for me, I am planning to visit this place again and again for a long time now for trying out their different dishes.

I had been here today for the first time and it was my birthday so I had gone out for dinner with friends. 
The ambience is really good and its better if you're early to get a table soon because its quiet filled on weekends. I had Vegetarian food and we took the appetisers and pizza which was good. The food was amazing and the service was also good. Because it was my birthday the people sang a song for me and it was amazing. Overall I would recommend anyone to have a experience over there for once at least.

Chili's have been one of my favorite place for American cuisine.. I am a great fan of Shrimp basket without which my every dine out at Chili's is incomplete.. Both the outlets I have visited in Gurgaon and Kolkata have good ambience and cordial staffs.. I am a regular visitor of this place and will continue to do so till the time they serves these delicious varieties.

Classic Nachos, Baby back ribs, Chipotle and many more to recommend.. Food lovers should be here once...I loved the blackened fish as well..

Service is pretty good... liked the decor and ambience too..

But one thing that stuck in my mind is the birthday Brownie.. I went once on a bday of a friend they offered the song greetings and Brownie.. we thought the Brownie was complimentary but it was charged that's where I got a lil disappointed.. otherwise it's a great place to visit..

This is the place I was desperate to go to after it opened and finally had the chance today on the Bengali new year! With an ambience like an american diner this place receives a thumbs up from me with respect to everything starting from food to decor. We had ordered a full course meal starting from drinks to desserts. Our order consisted of a watermelon moji-tea,chocolate shake,grilled chicken burger,chicken ranch burger,chipotle chicken pizza, honey chipotle chicken crisper and their signature dish the molten chocolate cake !! I liked each and every dish specially the Moji-tea and the pizza. The burgers where also delicious with large proportions of chicken. It is a meat lovers paradise serving everything from burgers,sandwiches to lamb ribs and steak. I would definitely visit this place again and try out the other wide variety of dishes that this eatery offers!

Excellent ambience, equally tasty food. 3 of us had gone for lunch rather early @ 1 pm. We had ordered Fish & Chips, Blackened Fish & Smoky Chicken Fajitas & all were equally tasty. We followed with Molten Chocolate Chunk & Mango Smoothies & they were pretty satisfying too. Quantity was good & in the end we felt filled to the brim! Bill came of Rs. 2187, may be slightly on the higher side, but considering the location & excellent quality & filling quantity, it is not too high. Overall rating is excellent.

Chili's has been a great experience. I have been there twice and both days it was same experience. So I felt their service standards are consistent. The servers are very attentive and pleasant. The hostess at the front gate can be more welcoming though. Coming to food and beverage.....I tried their Fajita platters....they are really awesome....presentation and taste both.....and their cocktails are superbly presented too. I tried Reggae Sunplash....and it was a "wow" feeling.... few setbacks i experienced were.....the seating section next to the Bar is always closed. In the both my visits I wanted to sit in that section but was told its closed. But overall great place in Quest Mall... Kudos to the Team....keep up the good work.

After a long time my desire to visit this place finally happened last night...on my birthday with my friends... Hailing from a customer service back ground i wouldn't have expected anything less u would provide for my customers so lets start with that... Service was really good.. From the time i went in spoke to the lady at the front desk for the seat till the time i was done.. They were polite,prompt,quick and exactly what i was expecting.... The guy who served me goutam was polite patient and answered all our queries... They food was served in the sequence we had asked...so i am very pleased with the service... Now coming to the food....food was good...it was not up to the expectation that i had i mind...after reading all the reviews i presumed it to be something very amazing... Honestly its good not amazing....what i really liked was the chrispy honey chicken chipolte crispers.. The pasta was also good..the pizza was ohkay not that great... It was a fun experience though...

They are serving Coronarita here too and it's out of the menu card! Looks good! Price isn't that good!
Chicken wings were as usual very lip-smacking with buffalo and ranch sauce! Blackened fish too was pretty good which comes along with rice and boiled veggies! Was thinking it to be bland l, but no it was spicy and tasty!
Ambience is top class, no doubt, but an imitation of american grill! Could have Indianized it!

This place has a nice vibrant happy feel to it! 
Friendly staff, good value for food & comfort food are the three mantras of this place! Giant mugs filled with beer or aerated drinks, nachos dipped in tons of cheese, the melt in your mouth desserts - they have it all! 
The portions are good enough, price is worth it, located inside the quest mall it's a nice place to hang out with friends or have dinner with family - the place is a bit loud but I guess that's supposed to be "fun"! All in all a nice place hopefully they will maintain their standards in the years to come! Highly recommended! Worth a visit for sure!

My college buddies and I spent a very Good Friday, thanks to Chili‚Äôs. With their prompt service, friendly casual ambiance, lavishly decorated interiors and cheerful customer-friendly people, Chili‚Äôs have won our hearts.

We started with a couple of triple dippers, a BBQ chicken salad, a Santa Fe chicken salad and individual cokes to accompany them. In the triple dipper, the chicken crisps and Southwestern egg rolls were deliciously crispy, and the chicken wings tasted amazing although slightly more salty than needed. The Santa Fe Salad had a delightful creamy texture with perfectly cooked chicken. The BBQ salad's chicken tasted even better although it was basically dry, but the dressing was separately provided.

We moved on to our main course with Fajita trio, Smoky chicken fajita with a side of bacon, Blackened salmon with a side of shrimps and a full rack of baby back ribs. In the fajita trio, although the steak (buffalo meat) had a very slight stench, once inside the tortillas with the various accompaniments, it tasted amazing! The shrimp and chicken were also cooked to perfection. The smoky chicken fajita tasted awesome with jack cheese dripping from the sides and crispy onion rings and mouth-watering bacon. We ordered too much not knowing that the tortillas are repeated. The salmon was good but nothing out of the world and could easily be given a miss. The best of them all was the scrumptious baby back pork ribs with honey chili glaze and crispy French fries.

We ended with chocolate truffle cake served in handmade glass and molten chocolate cake which is a must try for anyone who visits Chili‚Äôs. Every one of us loved our visit to Chili‚Äôs and hope to be able to go their soon.

Chilli's is a remarkable place with such good quality food and drinks, you cannot have any complaint regarding this place. The service and ambiance is also worth mentioning. I tried triple dipper, honey chipotle chicken crispers and blackened salmon. The quality of every food is exquisite and one must try these items including fajitas and baby back ribs. Chilli's also have a very good bar menu. The cocktails were pretty good and they go perfect with the food. I am definitely visiting this place often to try out rest of the dishes. Don't leave out this place guys.

If you want steak, please go for medium rare. Do NOT let the staff convince you that you won't be able to have it cause there'll be blood. Medium steaks are just plain bad. Chewy tasteless mess. However the mashed potatoes which come with it are great.

My maiden visit to Quest Mall, Chili's and exposure to American/Mexican cuisine. Visited the joint in the late afternoon on a Friday with a friend only to find it quite empty. D√©cor is bright, colourful with different seating arrangements-at the bar counter, comfy sofa benches and along the glass panelled exteriors overlooking the Kolkata skyline. Staff are young, energetic, cheerful and suggest the right items to order. Service-not that attentive though-we were served drinking water half-way into our meal.¬†Lucky for us that it was happy hours. Thus our booze bill was reduced considerably. Had the Absolut-Mandarin flavour which was awesome and packs quite a punch indeed. Kudos to the 1:1 offer.Ordered the triple dipper to wash off our drinks. The dish had three types of starters-chicken wings, batter fried crispy¬†chicken and eggrolls served with three types of sauces. The dish looked attractive and presentation was decent too. But sadly lacked in taste and flavour-chicken wings was too salty, crispy chicken was too basic-just batter fried stuff with no masala stuffing inside and eggrolls were too bland for my liking. I guess Westerners like their food the bland way. For the mains we ordered the red pepper chicken and the good old fish n chips.The red pepper chicken was chicken breast grilled in cheese served on a bed of rice and steamed broccoli on the sides. It was the best amongst all the items hands down. The fish n chips comprised of golden fried basa fish served with French fries and tartar sauce. Quantity wise very filling but lacking in taste.To sum-up a satisfying experience which could have been better.

Have been to Chili's on quite a number of occasions. Their food will never disappoint you. Period. It's one of my top choices after work, for catching a drink and a small bite. Have even celebrated friend's birthdays there, and it was a fantastic experience.¬†

Would recommend:
1. Fried calamari
2. Fajitas
3. Nachos
4. Taco pizza (It was surprisingly delicious)
5. Long island iced tea
6. Brownie sundae (MUST MUST HAVE!)

Wasn't very impressed with their burgers. Staff is courteous and highly prompt. Would go there again and again.

I straight away went for the Steak with 2 sides (Mashed potato & Home fries), it was awesome. Had fosters too. My wife craved dessert and I was not done. Ordered Fajita Trio. An excellent dish to end the food fiesta, but I am not done yet. I'll be back for even more, watchout for my next review.

Recently been there to this wonderful restaurant. The food was really wonderful. Tried the Fried Calamari, Trio Fajita. Both were excellent. The staff were also really good and friendly. Since it was V'day I guess it was too crowded and we had to wait for 30 mins to get a table. I guess you cannot pre book table via phone unless you have a real big group. Also it is at par with the USA outlets of Chilli's. Overall one of the best place to have Mexican and American food in town.

I have been to this place quite a few times and tried different items each time, just to b bowled over by the diverse flavours and the varied preparations. Now, I have a soft spot for pink lemonades and trust me, the one u get here clearly beats the ones that I had at Hyatt and Taj Bengal. 
Coming to the food, I dont think that there s much left to b said about a place which already has 760+ reviews in Zomato. But still, for all that it's worth, the fajitas(buffalo meat),  the wings, the enchiladas and the Chipotle pizzas are to die for. My mother, who religiously hated sandwiches,  is now a convert and never leaves the Quest Mall, until and unless she has had her fill of the Chili's club sandwich.

First of all, located at a very convenient place. Easy to reach. There are restaurants which are so difficult to find. I had dropped into this restaurant on a Saturday. Thank god,it wasn't crowded. The ambience was great. The staff are really courteous. I loved the Bbq chicken salad which had some bits of pork in it.. It had an overdose of iceberg lettuce which I didn't really like a lot. The next came blackened fish. It was served with rice and blanched veggies. The fish was light and flavourful. Next, was the chicken Chipotle steak with fajita bread. It was beautiful. They also serve alongwith it, shaved bits of cheddar cheese,tomato salsa and tartar sauce. The price was 1500 bucks but the taste was worth it. It has a brilliant collection of tacos and tortillas too. It's a must try for all the Mexican food freaks.. ;-)

So I have been to Chilli's to six times in the past year (most recent one being today) trying from steaks, fajitas, burgers to pizzas with the chicken crispers or triple dippers being the constant and the absolute favorite one. This has become one of my favourite restaurants in town owing to the exceptional quality of food they serve. 
Considering the list of items I have tried I would rate the burgers (bacon burger especially ) right there at the top closely followed by the steak. The fajitas were good too, only the pizzas left me little underwhelmed if compared with the rest. 
In the desserts section I had tried the warm molten cake and the paradise pie, of which the former is in my "must haves" list whenever visiting Chilli's.
They serve pretty good mocktails as well. Mostly I had gone for Cherry Cola, but today on insistence of the guy who was serving us tried something different and ordered for the Evolution mocktail, and it eventually turned out pretty good. 
Overall I will surely be visiting here again. Thumbs up from me.

Chili's an exciting place to be. We kicked of our binge with Beer buckets. Food was very delicious and the taste speaks for itself. We had chicken Cajun sandwich the signature of Chili's it was good portions and well made. Country fried Calamari was an appetizer that was more than a great fit for the beer. Boneless chicken wings did not meet expectations , southwestern egg rolls well a different taste of egg rolls. Orleans Jumabalaya the shrimps and the rice make it a must have. Smoky Chipotle Fajitas when u roll well they taste fantastic. Visit frequently Zomatians :)

Chili's feels like the Kolkata version of Denny's but with a la carte dining. 

The food comes to the table pretty fast which is great when the family is hungry.

The food is of a very high standard for a family restaurant. And the waiting staff is very efficient.

If you are looking for a place to feed your family, it's great. 

If you are planning to go thee with your significant other, it may pay to check beforehand if you will be surrounded by a birthday party for kids, as it can get a little raucous.

Bon apetit!

Worth the money i spent.I had a old friend dropped in town and this place didnt let me down.I tried the tripple dipper.Awesome choice of dips.Very filling.Love the variety offered in a single basket of happiness.:) Also we ordered classic beef steak as we people from northeast love red meat. The taste was awesome however the meat was utterly cold when arrived.Also the side dish which came alongside needs to be improved.Otherwise the service was truly worth it plus we loved the drinks.The cosmo was yum.
Loved the ambience.And lastly,more focus on good music please.
Cant wait to visit again Chili's.

We celebrated last year's Christmas at Chilli's. The long queue was obvious and so was the amazing mexican food! The deco is very cool, very uber. ¬†The staff is also very friendly and up and about. We had the Triple dipper, Fajita Quesadillas and a glass of Peach Fantasy. They are very generous with portions because of which there was no room for dessert ! We went home happy and full. Thank you Chilli's. We will see you soon!

I've been to this place just twice in very recent times and simply loved the way it is. I remember trying Mexican and beer both the times and it was great. The ambiance is glamorous and has a great vibe to it. The place is quite cozy and is very well organized. The service is smooth and people are friendly.

The prices are a bit on the higher side and it is supposed to be. The place is huge, ambiance is beautiful and the food is outstanding. I'd love to visit again anytime possible.

Chili's is a must visit restaurant for all food lovers! I have visited this place 5 times and never been disappointed!On my last visit yesterday, I had the best experience which made me write down this review. The ambiance is amazing and the loud music makes it all the more perfect. An apt place to hang out with your friends or family. Make sure that you visit this place with a big group because the food is served in huge quantity. The waiters are very friendly and comfortably guide you to select your dish according to your preference.Texas cheese poppers, country fried calamari, chicken fajitas and nachos have been my favourite starters. Triple dipper is popular but I somehow did not like any of it, though I loved the chipotle dip.
For maincourse, since I am a fish lover, Fish and Chips and blackened salmon have been my favourite. Fish is usually very tender and juicy which adds to the good taste. Apart from fish, barbeque ranch burger and veggies and cheese quesadillas are a must try.¬†Beverages are served in huge beer mugs which is a main attraction of this place. Cherry Cola and strawberry lemonade are some of the beverages I have tried apart from coke but they were too sweet, so be careful about the order for beverages. They serve amazing cocktails too.¬†I am coming back to this place to taste those pizzas that they have added in their menu and also desserts. I am usually so full each time that I miss out on the dessert.This is a perfect place to eat, drink and make merry!

One of those places on my list ever since it started. Chili's, somehow, never happened. Until yesterday, ofcourse. 
The ambiance is okay. The place is huge. From what I know of, they initially didn't serve alcohol but have now started with it which is good.
They are basically a continental serving restaurant, so the choice for me as a vegetarian was very limited. Also, all their cakes have egg in them which is fine by me but my companion thought otherwise. 
After much thought and a quick look at zomato, we ordered veggie jalape√±o burger and the popular strawberry  lemonade. 
The burger was served with a generous amount of fries (yay!) and a dip. The fries were delicious, better that I have ever had. And first bite of the burger and I was a fan already. It was just the right amount of juicy and loaded with jalape√±os. It was fresh and probably the best burger in town.
The strawberry lemonade was a bit too sweet for both me and my companion so negative point there. Otherwise, it was good.
The burgers are delicious. I am coming back to try whatever little they have of vegetarian in their menu.

It is one of those diners which you find in every American city. The food has been "modified" to suit Indian taste-buds. The namesake dish "Chilies" does not come anywhere near to what is served in the USA.¬†

But the best part of it is the size. If you order fresh lime soda or any mocktail they serve you in huge mugs and you can jolly well expect it to last throughout your meal.I had ordered grilled fish and the fish was well grilled but to go alongwith I had asked for veggis instead of smashed potatoes .That option they donot have which is suprising and the selection of veggies that come alongwith comprised of only some beans, two pieces of brocolli and smashed potatoes.¬†
My companion had ordered for steak medium done but it was soft and rubbery.

For desert having been fond of American cheese cake, ordered for the same but what was passed off as cheese cake was hard and cold, having been refrigerated maybe for months.¬†

my companion who had ordered a steak didnot fare well. It was supposed to be medium cooked but it came and unappetising.

This is one of the hotspots that everyone is speaking about these days. Ever since this place opened up it has become a fan favorite. Kolkata was alien to proper Tex-Mex food before which was an added advantage for this place.¬†
At Chili's I always feel you need a plan if you are going in smaller groups because you will be full by the time you order your main course. So my favorates here are the Triple Dipper, the Fried Calamari and the Chicken Fajitas.¬†
You can get a wide variety of food in the main course be it Tacos, Fajitas, Pastas, Burgers, Steaks etc. My personal favorite is the Baby pork Ribs in Barbeque sauce which comes with you selection of mashed potatoes or fries. You can also try the tendorloin steak to your taste and make it bloody, medium rare or well done. Also the blackened Salmon is another treat to have. Browse through the menu, and you will not be disappointed.
Also do order their mocktails or cocktails and be amazed by the size of the glasses. A great place to go if you are going in large groups I feel.

I give it a 4.5/5

I have been here more than 5 times and by that you can tell, I liked this place very much, it has a good ambiance with good service. It gets a¬†little noisy though when it is full house may be because of people get loud or the sitting arrangement, which is little closer to each other, which they should look into.

Now come to the food, till now I have tried -

Classic Steak Fajita served with finely chopped tomato, green onion and cilantro¬†as a garnish with well cooked chicken and steak, and of course tortilla with nice Guacamole), it was good. 

Twice I had Grilled Tenderloin Steak, which served with garlic toast and I went with mash potato option as a side dish, it was good but not very good, may be because the way they cooked the steak ( or may be the best steak I ever had till now is in Spaghetti Kitchen - Elgin Road).

Bacon Burger nicely served with vegetables and fries, I still don't like the fries they serve with any of their dishes, I feel, it is not tough, grainy or I say lack of second cooking process of fries.

Big Mouth Bites - which was good and should give a try. And yes, their Masala Lemonade is really good and this is the only refreshment or you can say drink I go for, whenever I come here.

¬†

So, overall on all of my past visits, I still find it a good place where you can eat good food with good ambiance, specially if you are going on a date or friends get-together. My rating will be 4 for here.

Well, sadly enough we landed up at the restaurant on a dry day ¬†which meant no alcohol for us to celebrate the occasion of a friend's birthday and to top it they couldn't provide us with the dishes we wanted. As an ardent pork lover, I was disappointed that they did not have any of the pork dishes on their menu and I had to make do with an added Bacon topping on a Chicken pasta. No complaints on the quality and taste though from the Triple dippers we ordered for starters to the Kicked up Quesadillas (which were beautiful I must add) or the Southwestern Chicken pasta topped up with bacon ( still sulking on that though!). We had also ordered the Blackened fish which was great , though the sides in the form of the rice felt quite bland. For drinks we had to choose the Mango Iced tea and the strawberry lemonade as no alcohol was being served. About the mango iced tea, it had very faint to no hint of the tea .. I have experienced better versions of this drink in other places in Kolkata itself so as an alternative its just passable. The delight came in the form of Chocolate chip paradise pie which was buttery , warm, fuzzy and flavoured, contrasted with the chilled vanilla ice cream topping. We had also ordered the Cheesecake : the one served here would be a baked one and I am more a bit more partial to the unbaked type so it was nothing exceptionally great. Overall, it was a pleasant experience with friendly staff and good food ... but the management should ensure the availability of the stuff on their menu at all occasions,

After all those brilliant reviews from friends and colleagues this place was one of the sought after ones for me as a foodie and finally visited the Chili's for a weekend lunch. Must say the ambience was really good and something I never experienced before. Music was loud and the lighting was perfect. Now to the main part, ie food. It was mindblowing and cooked to perfection. We ordered bbq chicken salad,chicken wings and blackened salmon and got bowled over with their taste. Also had watermelon moji-tea which was awesome as well. All in all it was a great experience and would like to revisit soon.

I wanted to visit quest mall for long time but¬† due unavoidable circumstances I was unable to go there.So, one fine day we visited Quest mall & D wanted to go to chilly's¬† badly. We ordered strawberry lemonade, triple dipper, Chipotle Honey chicken crisper & chipotle smoky chicken fajitas. The strawberry lemonade was great. The triple dipper had this awesome crispy chicken crispers and Egg-rolls. but the chicken wings had a weird taste. The chicken crispers were tasty, they were tossed in honey and chipotle dressing and served with fries & corn cob. the chicken fajitas were great.The ambience was great.

This is one of the best places for american/mexican cuisines. The ambience is amazing , food excellent. I agree it's a bit pocket-pinching but worth every penny shelled out. Lynchburg lemonade and JD are the only two drinks which I enjoy. But hey, if you enjoy a brewski once in a while like me, they've got heiniken. ;) texas chilli cheese fries is the only starter i've been eating ever since i've been there and it is amazing. Over all simply amazing.

I was bowled over by the water melon mojitto...strawberry lemonade was at par. Tripple Dipper was actually interesting. Three different types of items served in a single basket; with 3 types of fab dips. The Country Fried Chicken is a must try as it a shizz and so wickedly delicious...A platter having a huge slice of chicken fry, a big tasty corn, cheesy yummy mashed potato and a piece of crunchy toast!! Im sure you are already craving for it!! :P  overall a cool experience..!! Yo Chili's, you rock!!

This is one of the best places for american/mexican cuisines. The ambience is amazing , food excellent, location ideal since it's 5 minutes from my place. I agree it's a bit pocket-pinching but worth every penny shelled out. Lynchburg lemonade and JD are the only two drinks which I enjoy. But hey, if you enjoy a brewski once in a while like me, they've got heiniken. ;) texas chilli cheese fries is the only starter i've been eating ever since i've been there and it is amazing. The baby back ribs are quite delicacy itself so is the tenderloin steak depends on how meaty you're feeling. The sizzling fajitas are quite amazing too. But my personal favourites are the burgers. They're huge and meaty quite the adventure for the meat lovers. It's as they say nothing ventured , nothing gained.  Over all simply amazing.

Been here a month back...an amazing place to hang out with your friends!! We had chicken pasta which was awesome(filled with cheese and cream and lots ..n lots of chicken) and more than enough for 2 people. Try country fried chicken, I had this again when I was in Chilis' Bangalore. The foods here are so fresh and servicing is a thumbs up!! But ¬†I personally did not like fajitas...so would recommend not to have fajitas. But the place is very cool and its expensive.

A perfect place for some lips smacking Mexican, Italian dishes! Awesome decor and a perfect ambiance to hangout. Starting from the garnishing to the taste of the dishes...i loved them all. I had gone out with friends to enjoy the weekend and we had chosen Chilli's to be our destination. We had ordered Triple Dipper Chicken for starters and Orleans Jambalaya, Blackened Salmon and Chicken Grilled Tacos for the main course along with Mocktails. We ended our meal with Molten Chocolate Cake. The display of each and every dish made us all the more happy. The amount was more than enough for the four of us as we had shared the dishes. Highly recommended place to visit for everybody reading this! :)

The post valentine day was spiced up with India winning against Pakistan and having a great dinner at this awesome restaurant. It is primarily a Mexican restaurant which offers variety of mouth watering dishes. My friend and I ordered for bar b q chicken salad and southwestern pasta in spaghetti form l, white sauce and topping of bacon. Both were good. And it sufficed the two of us. We had already had lots of junk food before entering there so we were full. But i heard their mocktails and the special cherry coke is to be looked out for. I hope I have not missed out too much. The bill was kind of okay given the ambience and the quality of food. I hope they retain their uniqueness. Highly recommended by me. Happy eating!!!!

When in doubt, eat at chili's.
The food and beverages at chili's has never failed to impress me till date. The advantage of going to this place is that you are provided with a free brownie on the occasion of your birthday. I have celebrated birthdays of 5 of my college mates there (none of which was a genuine one).

For a long time I wanted to visit this place but due to many unavoidable circumstances I was unable to do that so without any proper planning I dropped there and as usual the place was crowded. We waited for 15 mins and den got a place. The service was fast and even though it was crowded the staff maintained the crowd very well. Food was yummy. Chicken crispers were awesome and BBQ chicken salad was very fresh and yummy. Chicken wings were a little different but delicious. Egg rolls were good. Margarita s are well made. I liked the tequila sunrise a lot. I wanted to taste many things but I was full so I will taste it next time for sure.
Chicken nachos are awesome. Chicken fajita was good.Deserts are heavenly.

This is probably the most visited restaurant in Quest Mall, compared to the other overpriced restaurants there. And very aptly so.. The staff are very courteous and the service is excellent. We were a group of four friends and started with fajita quesadillas. We moved on to monterey chicken, tortilla crusted chicken, fajita trio and cajun club turkey sandwiches with added smoked bacon. Each of the dishes were equally delicious. We wanted to try the baby back ribs but they were not available at the time. They may not have a wide variety of choices in the desserts menu, but the cheesecake and molten chocolate cake we ordered were probably the best dishes we had over there. A sweet ending to a superb meal!! One simply does not visit Chili's once....

This is the best ever place i have ever visited in Kolkata with my friends.. place with great ambience great decor and nice place to hang out with and even to relax in ur own dramatix modd. What i especially like is the food quality and the people who are serving actually. .. 

The food quality was perfectly up to mark no doubt we have ordered one veg as well as non veg both quesdillas and alfredo pastas... and believe me as i am a chicken eqter i love the chicken preparation, the way especially its been cooked. This four items doesn't end it up we have tried even the Rita corona to taste up our pallette with Margherita. .. This was something unusual but worth buying. .. The service personnel as well as my friends all have make my this weekend unforgettable. ..

As I write this review, Chili‚Äôs sits in the top five restaurants list on Zomato in Kolkata and it has done so for a while. Chili's gleaming reputation speaks for itself and no wonders their mouth watering preparations attract foodies from all corners of Kolkata.

Went to this place to celebrate a friend‚Äôs birthday, it was a Sunday and the place was packed. After 15 mins of waiting we got a table. The first thing that catches our eyes was the d√©cor- simple but neat with comfortable seating arrangement and this place have a lovely casual vibe. Make sure to be patient with service and do not get offended in any case.

Our order was Crisp chicken taco, Monterey chicken, Fajita steak, Back ribs in BBQ sauce. Each dish was superbly prepared and beautifully presented. The ribs were really good, they make their BBQ sauce in house and it's so good and is probably one of my favourite of the night.

Overall, the food here is amazing. It's creative and very unique. The menu has such a wide variety, and it seems like there is something for everyone. They are quite pricey but that is to be expected and it is actually quite good value for money. Generally the quality of the food is very good. We will be back for sure.

Highly recommended.

I stuck to the chilis fan choice dishes.. Bbq chikn salad, grilled shrimp alfredo, chkn burger, blckened salmon... The grilled shrimp alfredo was a disaster. Come on 5 almost raw shrimps on top of pasta, that too cms wid a hefty price,  its surely nt my cup of tea.. No complain about the service bt highly over priced.. U surely can hv better nd plentier in many othr resturants... College students beware- u may end up exhausting all ur pocket money at one go.. :p

After a lot of impatient waiting, I finally managed to get my fangs into the awesomeness called Chili's. A friend was visiting from Mumbai and being a big foodie, it was mutually decided to visit Chili's for a grand lunch. So on 28th of Jan '15, we headed out to our destination, and after a LOT of struggling, (Due to the sudden taxi strike in Kolkata), we ended up here, hot and hungry. 

Let me start with the ambiance..It was just like a hangout would be, cozy and comfortable, though we wished the A.C would have been a little higher. 

We were served water in big fat Beer mugs.. something I quite liked.

Coming to our order, we started off by ordering for separate servings of the Terlingua Buffalo Chili, to go with the Jose Cuervo Gold shots... It was AWESOME! The chili was fantastic, well-seasoned and tasted great. 

Next, we ended up ordering the Triple Dipper, Country-fried Calamari and something called Chicken corn cutlets? I forgot the name... 

The triple dipper was superb, especially the crispy chicken, and the dips, OMG!!! But the Calamari stole the show.. I have NEVER had such crispy, crunchy and yet perfectly cooked calamari. The corn chicken thingy was alright, not too great. 

Next, we ordered some Peach Martinis... very yummm..

Then it was the Blackened Salmon, a good dish, but the Salmon could have done with a little seasoning.. 

We also had the Fajita Trio, another superlative dish. The accompaniments, salsa, guacamole, sour cream, mixed cheeses and tortillas were great as well..

Sadly, we didn't have space for desserts, so that will have to be reviewed another time. 

Personally, I LOVED the food and the ambiance. The only shock we had was the bill, 27% tax!!!! Our bill came to almost 9000 bucks!! And let me tell you, shelling out that much is a LOT. Also, the servers could do with a little speed...but it's not too bad really.

I'm definitely going back again, after all, there's so much more food to be sampled!!! :D

The ambiance is cozy and comfortable. The place is neat and spacious. I think they need to look at the shows they put up on their T.Vs. Chota Bheem cannot be shown on T.V. at such a place. Come On!

¬†¬†¬† The food was the best I have had in Kolkata. We guys ordered Chicken Sandwich, Turkey Sandwich, Calamari Fries plus other vegetarian stuff that I did/do not care about! :P 
¬† The sandwiches were light and crispy on the outside but at the same time not too buttery. The inside had fresh and crunchy veggies with good meat and served with a hand full of fries and tartar sauce (i guess). It had everything going for it! The calamari fries where good too. It is too easy to over cook calamaris and make them rubbery but this was done right. A bit too oily but definitely tasty! 
¬†The dessert was the star of the night. We ordered their cinnamon caramel cake with ice cream (I'm sorry but I do not remember the exact name of the dessert). It was warm and rich. The flavours were coming through nicely and was a hit amongst all the 4 of us.

The service was courteous and warm. It blended well with the ambiance in making us feel comfortable. That's something I liked a lot.

Overall it was a brilliant experience and one that I would recommend to everybody!

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† And Chilli's, Keep up the good work lads!

Visited here after hearing rave reviews about this place.. The occassion was a simple get-together for two families, and I suggested Chilli's. Immediately after entering the place, I knew it was not a good choice for a get-together. The large tables sit only 6 people, and that too, was not quite spacious and comfy. Our 7th member had to get an extra chair in the aisle to sit. So beware, if you are visiting Chilli's with a large party.The ambience was okay, the music was too loud for our linking and we literally had to shout to make ourselves heard.. They offered a complimentary drink, the cherry cola, which tasted absolutely awful..
Coming to the food, we had triple dipper and nachos chicken, along with lemonades for everyone in starters. All the items in triple dipper were equally good, and the dip was exquisite.. The nachos chicken was also far better than other nachos that I have tasted.. The crunchy feel, along with the taste of cheese, was brilliant, which I didn't find anywhere else..In the main course, we had, Jambalaya, which was great, the prawns tasted brilliant.. The blackened Salmon was again superb, though compared to the other main courses, it was a bit light.. Monterey Chicken was okay, not bad, but not great either.. The Big Mouth Bites was indeed big though.. It's almost impossible to finsih the dish up, if you take something else.. The best two preparations were by far last two.. Grilled Tenderloin Steak was smiply mouth watering, and the decoration was also eye-catching.. The steak could have been more cooked, I found it a tad under-cooked, but because of the taste, I forgave them.. The best is saved for the last, the Smoked Chicken Fajita, was undoubtedly the zenith of the main course dishes.. The chicken melted in my mouth, the roll was as soft as it could get..We were in a hurry, and also, had our bellies full, so we skipped desserts, much to my dismay..
Some notable points are:¬†I found the service to be quite poor. The waiter first attended us after 20-25 mins of repeated calling. They did not provide garlic bread with the steak, which they are supposed to do.. The fajita came 50 mins after placing the order, when everyone had finished with their main course.. In the end, we had to pack the fajita home.the food was great.. There is nothing to say more about it, the quality and quantity of each item is more than enough for one. Extremely satisfied by the main course dishes.

They take a ridiculous amount of taxes, so be careful when placing the order.. It's very expensive for college students, so beware..Overall, I would say a great experience, one I would like to have again, and the next time I visit, it will be specially for desserts, along with their burgers.. Recommended for anyone and everyone who loves to have a good drink and good American Food

In my opinion one of the best Steak 'houses' in town. The ambience is perfect and resembles any American pub. 

If you think, this is the ONLY place in Kolkata where they serve you beef steaks, pork chops and grilled salmons. But the cost is on the higher side, be prepared to shell out 500+ bucks for any dish.

I have been looking forward to eating at Chili's after hearing much about the place, both good and bad, and I have to say that I will be saying good things about it. It was semi-full on a Sunday afternoon and we were seated immediately at a table of our choice, overlooking the street below. The place looks and feels comfortable. The drinks menu listed a good number of imported beers but none of those were available and we had to settle with Budweisers. We ordered a starter of crumb fried prawns which was nothing great. I had a jambalaya which was quite good, though I had to eat very carefully as I am allergic to peppers and the dish was loaded with red, green and yellow peppers. My friends ordered the chateaubriand steak and a chicken quesadilla. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare and the portion was huge, though the meat was buffalo, which is strange considering the fact that good quality beef is not hard to find in Kolkata. The steak came with a huge serving of mash and a lot of broccoli. The quesadillas were also quite good, my friend wanted an avocado dip with them but it was not available. The food portions were so large that we were hardly able to finish the orders between the three of us. The bill was quite a surprise and unexpectedly low, considering that we had ordered beers as well. Overall it was a good Sunday lunch and I will be going back to Chili's again soon.

Honestly I dont know wats the buzz about. 
We ordered Triple Dipper, Cheese Popper and Chicken Crispers. Cherry Cola n Corona.
Staff n service is great, but the taste.
The crispers chicken was soggy n tasted somewhat like those dry cold chilly chicken, but corn was ok. The cheese popper was ok but not that great. N in triple dipper I just liked the fish.
Their dips, none was good.
I guess its too soon to pass a verdict. May be i would go one more time n try some of their other items to finally decide.
I am thinking that their fish items would be more promising but the chicken certainly  aint..

Chili's is a restaurant which offers a great variety of flavours.Everytime I visit I order a different dish as their menu is so huge.Having been there quite a number of times I must admit that most of the stuff being offered is quality and I seldom go home unsatisfied.
This time we had ordered Chicken Club Tacos,Bbq salad with Mango Mojitea and Watermelon Lemonade.
1)The tacos were super crisp,the veggies,chicken and bacon filling was refreshing but I like to have a hint of spice in my dish and that was missing.Though,they tasted better when I added the beans to it.Also the dip which I got with the tacos was wonderful!
It was made of tartar and mayo combined with some other elements.

2)The bbq salad was simply fab ! The chicken was soft and had that not so sweet but amazing bbq flavour.The salad was fresh and crunchy.Great salad !

3)The Mango Mojitea was basically a Mango Iced Tea.The mango flavour was a little understated , I liked it.

4)The Watermelon Lemonade was just the perfect drink.Just the combo of watermelon and lemon is mindblowing !

And you know what ? At the end of our meal ,the waiters suddenly gathered and starting singing a song for my friend as it was his birthday ! We also got complimentary brownie with icecream, with a small candle on top.Great hospitality ! 
Though I was slightly disappointed with my tacos,it wasnt the correct order for my palate.Also,the salad and drinks made up for it.Thus I'd still rate them a 4.

Now this is the place i was dying to visit since it opened doors in the City Of Joy but due to some reason or the other i couldn't :-(  To almighty's grace i did manage to give a visit to this place in the cold wintry afternoon of early December :-))))))) So here's how my debut went like....
Ambience is good as expected...crowded hence service was a bit slow. It was a tough job seeking the waiter's attention towards our table ;-)
I and my friend both ordered nachos with fajita chicken and fish n chips. We had already eaten at two other places that afternoon so we were already full ;-) hence we could stick to only two items. The nachos were crazily good with cheese dripping from them and a very generous filling of chicken. The best i have had...portions were superb as compared to the price. Fish n chips was a bit pricey with two medium sized fish fries along with french fries coming at 375 per plate. The dish was prepared very well and the fish( which i assumed to be was basa) was juicy. They even serve you water in oversized beer mugs which was interesting.
Overall i had a great experience at the place and my new year resolution is to try out each and every item of chili's :-D
Do make it a point to visit :-)

This restaurant; wow, just wow. The food, the decor, the ambiance, just splendid. I've been meaning to visit for a long time, and now that I've had a taste of chili's, I just can't stop going there. The water is served in huge beer mugs, which I absolutely loved. The lighting is quite soothing, and TVs hang from every nook and cranny of the restaurant. The staff is also quite courteous. Now coming to the food. I had the bacon burger, which was simply delicious. The amount of fries they give is more than enough. My friends had grilled tenderloin, chicken fajitas, and Orleans Jambalaya. The grilled tenderloin was simply amazing. So soft and juicy, one of the best steaks I've had, ever. The Jambalaya had the perfect amount of spices and was lip smacking. The fajitas were also pretty good. Coming to the desserts, the cheesecake is the best I've had in Kolkata. Even the chocolate chip paradise pie was spectacular. The thing is that when it comes to Chili's, I run out of adjectives. This place is a must visit for everybody, irrespective of whether you like this type of cuisine or not. Chili's will not leave you disappointed.

One word for chili's? Kudos.  The food, the decor, the ambience. A-class. So finally I did make a move today. A good four of us decided that we would finally take in some time out of our busy schedule to dine in at Chili's. Mexican cuisine was what we basically wanted to opt for. Even though it was a thursday, it was overtly crowded and we had to wait for about 5 minutes even though the 6 seaters lay empty.  That really pissed us off.  Finally the manager in order to manage our solemn grumpy behaviour took us to the table and it was quite a comfortable corner where we could easily resort to our hooliganism without being heard. The waiter appeared in 2 minutes. The waiter was well versed with the menu. So we ordered for basic coolers. we went in for cappuccino, strawberry lemonade , lemonade and the munching brownie. The lemonades were served in super huge beer mugs and this made us happy. I had heard praises about their tenderloin steak so that had to be one of the dishes that we wanted. The biggest disaster was that the waiter enquired "medium" or "well cooked". We decided on well cooked and of course it was hard as never. The taste was amazing though. But definitely medium cooked is recommended.  Then it was crispy honey chiptle chicken crispers. It was amazingly good. Righteously spiced and the dip that they served was amazing and the french fries and whole steamed sweet corn added to the it. The crisper along with the corn tasted amazing. This is highly recommended again. Then we ordered for a smoky chipotle chicken fajitas with pita bread. This was another amazing affair. And the extra sour cream and cheddar cheese added to the league to make the food taste even better. What was another disaster was we order all the food at one go. And all the orders just arrived together in no less than five minutes. Not giving us time to chit chat and thr food started to cool down. So order should be one after the other. And another amazing part was the dessert.  The molten chocolate cake was out of the world. The cake could have been a a bit softer. But the chocolate spilling out of the cake made us reach the cloud 9. And we were done. Bill was quite decent in accordance to the amount we hogged. We were full till our throats. And came back all happy.am definitely going back to chili's soon.

I had a friend visiting from Switzerland to ensure quality I took her to chillis. It was a big mistake . Since my last visit (a year ago) the quality has dropped drastically. Both of us had running stomachs and what took the cake was the fancy discounts ¬†displayed on the table . Don't reflect on your bill ( they charge you the full price ) you have to argue . So please be aware of food quality and billing in chillis

Went to chili's on New Year 2015.I had been hearing great reviews about this place from a foodie friend based out in Hyderabad. So when Chili's finally opened an outlet in Kolkata , was really excited to try it out. But was saving it for a really good mahurat, and what other reason than New Year celebration day...

Ambience: 

Just awesome. We were lucky enough to get a window seat with an awesome view. The whole feel of the restaurant with the big typical Chili's wall hangings and pictures is breathtaking.

Service:

We had to wait for around 20 mins since it was on a New year peak lunch hour time. We were handed over the food and the drinks menu. We were served food after 15 mins of placing the orders, which I felt is quite quick enough considering the crowd it was.

Food:

We ordered 'Country Fried Calamari' and 'Blacked Fish'. The calamari was very fresh,crispy and heavenly tasty.The soft calamari rings with a crusty crunchy outside coating dipped in sauce and with a dash of lime...ummm..nomnom...

The blackened fish had 2 salmon fish fillets, spicy rice, few seasonal boiled veggies and spicy fried shrimp. Leaving aside the fish, rice and shrimp wherein all these tasted just heavenly (I would leave it to you to have a bite and then decide as writing anything about it would be a complete understatement). But the seasonal veggies.. we were served tomatoes and broccoli. I never knew tomatoes and broccolis tasted sooo goooood. I can eat them daily and go complete vegetarian.. Ha ha just joking :P (that's not possible).. 

In all a really foodgasmic experience and definitely a must try. Will I visit this place again? Well definitely but only on the first week of the month :P...

Awesome place! The food is great and service is superb! Must order cocktail - presidente margarita, they serve it with so much vigour (1 margarita = 2 serves). For food - don't order too much as the quantity is good. We ordered classic nachos, bbq salad, chicken & shrimps and quesadillas. Everything was tasty. 
In all, loved the place, food, service and ambience. :)

Now don't get me wrong. Chili's makes one of the best cocktails. But what I hated about this place was the lack of service. On a Monday, there was only one person attending an entire area covered by two seating bays. I pay a hefty "service charge" and as a customer, expect the charge to be justified. Would I visit again? No, because I stay in Mumbai and the one there is better).

If u are trying to go for a buffalo (u get loads of variety) then it isnt that filling none the less..pricey but flavouracious!!
And an important thing once u take any cold drinks YOU CAN REFILL IT FOR FREE!! AT NO EXTRA CHARGES.u pay only once thats all.

As an outsider in the city, I was completely enthralled by this place. You always expect  great food in Calcutta, but such a casual setting with peppy ambiance and great engaging staff who offer quality service are a novelty offered by Chilli's . I loved their huge, flamboyant menu which is a very rare thing these days. Both their Mocktails are good but Berry Mojito is amazing. Their starters have some good variety to choose from. Main course ranges from a solid steak to a good old thin crust pizza. I absolutely loved the way the cook their chicken and their Pizzas, great raw material used. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to have a nice evening with friends though you might need to dutch in a little bit extra.

Been here quite a number of times, and i am finally writing a review about Chili's. First of all i would like to recommend this restaurant to everyone simply because of the food they serve. Never have i ever been disappointed. The first time i had ordered classic fajitas which were great , the next time i had burger which was even better . Also the calamari basket , the shrimp basket and the chicken crispers are worth every penny. Special mention to the molten chocolate cake!
The only down side is the service. Had to ask the waiters to serve the order as they took time in between. But again, everyone there was quite friendly.
Il give it a thumbs up for the food. The proportions they give are quite a lot. If u are a big foodie, this is the place to visit.

Well I along with my husband decided to pay this restaurant a visit during our Kolkata tour. It is quite popular among Kolkatans so was very excited to try this out. We went there on a weekday and got to know that happy hours were going on. So ordered 1 Classic Mojito and the offer was 1+1 so got 1 free which was a great deal. Ordered one Triple Dipper to go along with the drinks. The cocktail was amazingly done. We both just loved it. The tripple dipper had chicken crispers,chicken wings and south western rolls along with 3 dips.. the 3 dips were really great. The chicken wings were inedible as it was too salty.. the other two were good enough. Service was quite good and friendly. Ambience wise it was nice too. Had loads of expectations but it was slightly below par.

This place is one of my favourite simply because it has never disappointed. Being a veggie if you see the menu you will be thinking how a vegetarian can love the place with so less options but trust me they have the best of the vegetarian stuff and you will not be disappointed. I had gone with family n ordered texas cheese poppers which was jst the way it should be. It was soft with a crunchy texture having soft cheese coming out of it as you as you bite it with a dip that just compliments the cheese poppers overall. Next we ordered veggie & cheese quesidillas which was made to perfection. It a corn flour tortilla which is filled with mushrooms, veggie and cheese and baked to perfection (not sure if it is baked or not) it came with rice and rajma with salad n cream which just added flavour to the entire dish. Last we ordered taco veg pizza 9" base which had 8 pieces and was baked to perfection. Really loved the entire meal and am sure am visiting again with all my friends n family. 
One more thing that you can order is texas cheese fries which is a huge amount of fries which comes with ranch dressing over it and a dip. 
A highly recommended place to go 
N if you are a non vegetarian then m sure this place is no less than a heaven for you. 
The staff is also very courteous which made my review to 4.5.

Am a die hard fan of american food, so if I talk about the food and its quality then you can understand my rating. 4 of us went there yesterday and the first thing we ordered was a triple dipper! Yumm... It tasted great. For main course all of us ordered different stuff. I ordered a big mouth bites, where you get 4 mini burgers with french fries and onion rings, again yumm.. My girl ordered a citrus fire chicken and shirmp which had a lot of stuff in it including indian 'rotis', weird. My brother ordered a grilled chicken platter and his girlfriend ordered a classic fajitas combo. All in all the dishes were excellent. The total bill was around rs.3200 including taxes! (the taxes are huge there!). Oh and i also ordered a beer and the girls ordered cold drinks!!! Must try once atleast!!

Food was great sadly missed Baby Back Ribs which was the reason for my visit it seemed out of stock so instead opted for tenderloin which was really hard for me to handle alone for the main course , had a triple dipper which was really a thing to try and my friend opted for salmon with seasonal veggies which was good according to her and the few spoons I gulped down.Great ambience and service, a restaurant to try out in Kolkata but remember you need some bucks in your pocket.
Unavailability of Baby back ribs lost it some points.

IT WAS MY SECOND VISIT TO CHILI'S . I ORDERED THE TRIPLE DIPPER, BIG BITE BURGER AND AN EVOLUTION. IN THE TRIPLE DIPPER THE SOUTHWEST EGG ROLLS WERE TYPICALLY MEXICAN BUT I COULD'NT TASTE THE INDIVIDUAL ELEMENTS, ALL I COULD TASTE WAS SOME CHEWY SUBSTANCE IN¬† CHEESE ALTHOUGH THE PASTRY WAS GREAT. THE WINGS WERE A LITTLE UNBALANCED BUT THE BEST WAS THE FRIED CHICKEN. THE BATTER WAS AEREATED AND THE CHICKEN WAS JUICY BUT I WOULD PREFER THEM TO FRY THE CHICKEN WITH A LITTLE MORE SEASONING. IN THE BURGER THE FIRST THING I HATED WAS THE FLACCID ONION RINGS WHICH WERE ACCORDING TO ME BECAUSE OF THEIR OVER EXPOSURE TO MOISTURE AND THE PATTY WAS ALSO UN PREPPED AND HAD A TSINGY SMELL TO IT. THE EVOLUTION TASTED GREAT AND REFRESHED ME ....

If the first lunch of the new year is any indication of how the rest of the year is going to be, then 2015 is a mouth-watering prospect. Having seen almost all my friends in Kolkata mention this place in Facebook for the better part of last year, I finally managed to visit Chili's on the 1st of Jan. Now chilli isn't really one of my favorite items, but the same can't be said about Chili's. 

The restaurant has an easy-going charm about it, with the bar on the left, and the dining area on the right. The dining area windows offer a veritable view of the city skyline, and the sleek wooden table-chair sets add elegance to the place. The bar is done up in a slightly darker tone, with the chandeliers adding their touch of class. Being the festive time, the place was done up in traditional Christmas fare, and it went really well with the interior. 

We ordered Orleans Jambalaya and citrus fire chicken and shrimp fajitas, and some coolers to go with it. The jambalaya was pretty good, although the rice could have done with some more seasoning. The fajita, now, tasted excellent, and making tacos was real fun. Do try out this dish. 

The pricing is very reasonable, and Chili's is worth the second and the third and the umpteenth visit. My only grouse is that I couldn't identify any of the songs playing there.

Service is quick... We got a table by the window within 10 minutes. The food tastes pretty good.. We took cosmopolitan and pinacolada for cocktails, tenderloin steak and chicken fajitas and skipped deserts because by the time the two of us finished our main course, we were pretty full. I felt the food could have been a little spicier ...just a personal thought... Ambience n decor n all were nice... You can actually see the sprinkler pipes and exposed ac ducts up above... We visited in the afternoon btw

Even though im not a fan of Chili's back in the States, I went ahead to give it a try. Since then I've been here quite a few times. HANDS DOWN the best beef burger joint in Kal (obviously considering the price). Ohh and great service aswell.

A new &  totally a different concept of a restaurant. The menu card is too long and to choose a food from it is difficult for beginners, though you can ask them their speciality it will help you. Good service,friendly staffs. Huge place. The bar design is really awesome. For couples 1500 will be a good money to spent to fulfil their appetite. As I said a new concept you will like it.

Had heard so much about Chili's, that we just had to visit! Went for dinner and it was packed- as usual. For starters, ordered Calamari. Squid isn't readily available at most eateries, so this was quite a treat. For mains, we had Orleans Jambalaya and Grilled Tenderloin. The portions were enormous, more than enough for three people. The tenderloin was a bit tough, though. The pricing, while not inexpensive, is satisfactory. Would definitely like to try out more dishes at Chili's!

Grandiloquent Ambience..The place lives up to it's fame for great steaks..Had the Beef Tenderloin steak- Aah! Juicy..served with mashed potatoes, a slice of toast and concentrated chicken stew it tasted great on a wintry December evening.Also tried the Pork ribs, umm well it tasted good but not a sumptuous finger lickin good stuff.To end on a sweet note the cheesecake was like poetry.Service, food quality were fair enough but the pocket pinch really pinches( If you ask value for money, well NO!) Cool place to hangout nonetheless.

I have been a regular to Chilis in the US. Back there, Chilis is a normal American diner, but over here, its one of the finest fine dining restaurants. 
What attracts me at Chilis is the bar with high stools and you can literally see the tender shaking your Margarita.
I have been to Chilis at Quest today and was overwhelmed. My favourites are the egg rolls and the smoked chipotle fajita. Though I love steaks, but I have not had an opportunity to have one here. The Margaritas are a favourite, so is the cheesecake and the pie that I tried the last time.
Chilis US offers deals from time to time, mostly on starters and entrees and I would be truly delighted to find Chilis offer such deals here.

Well as you all know it does resemble the old school American hangout places we see in movies or shows.Chili's is definitely a must try if you are in for some excellent food. Once you enter you will see the bar to your left and the interior of the place will surely catch your eye. With music playing in the background it just adds to the charm of the place.
Now the most important thing-food. Since i was with my friends we ordered a pitcher(happy hours so we got one more for free) and started with country-fried chicken and crispy honey-chipotle¬† chicken crispers and both were delicious.the chicken were properly fried and the garnishing just makes it more appealing.trust me all their dishes are garnished very nicely. then we ordered a chicken ranch burger which was very good.not exceptional.then we order classic fajitas with chicken.an excellent dish with chicken grilled to perfection and properly garnished. But it was orleans jambalaya which stole the show.its a must try if you are there.bacon prawn chicken with rice and all made to perfection is a treat.
we ended with cheese cake which we could have had more if we weren't full.
Taking all this into account it is expensive though.
Service was prompt and proper.

Visited Chili's with my boyfriend on my birthday. Loved the ambience. But the  service could have been better. The stewards are intern I guess as when we asked him which wine would go better with the main courses we ordered ,he simply told both would go well instead of suggesting a particular wine. But I must say food quantity is really good. We were struggling to finish off.. Loved the blackened salmon and paradise pie,so yummy.

Mexican is what the menu shouted complete with nachos and enchiladas, cheese poppers to pan pizzas, lot of varieties for non vegetarians but veg people are left wanting for some more options to be honest. It has a full bar section even though the Monday evening crowd comprised mostly families and some guests from abroad. Order everything that's Mexican coz the pizza was really bad.
It has comfortable seating with LCD screens to give company.

Chili's at Quest Mall is one of the most popular food joint in Kolkata right now. The Desi franchise of this American outlet is already a hit in our city of joy. It was a lazy sunday evening when my husband and i suddenly decided to eat outside and Chili's being the latest hot spot was on the top priority. We reached around 9 PM and ¬†were asked to wait; it being a full house then. i loved the signange; its very bright and attractive. The interior was similar to a typical Texan outlet with a bar counter where you can sit with your choice of alcohol and have a gala time with friends. The dining area is also very American (though i have only watched American restaurants in various travel and food channels only :p). The staff is very cordial and they were pretty quick in serving. The menu has it all... starting from alcohol you also have burgers, sanwiches, pastas, quesadilla,enchiladas,roasted meat, fajitas, etc etc. The dessert menu is equally yummy. We ordered for the newest item on the menu which was Orleans Jambalaya... This dish had shrimps, bacon, rice, etc and had a tangy flavour to it; typical mexican flavoured condiments added to the flavour. The Chicken Fajita was a better choice as the portion of meat in it was very very soft and tender. Both the dish was filling enough for the two of us. We also ordered two pint beers to add to the flavour of the food. Best part here is you can order pitcher beer if you are in a group and the price of it is pretty reasonable. We left the dessert for another day as we were too full this time. Overall a must visit place for foodies of Kolkata.

We had planned visiting Chili's at Gurgaon over a month back and lastly ended up visiting the branch here at Kolkata. Chili's is now operating in around eight Asian countries including Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, etc and ofcourse in India bringing the taste, aroma and ambiance of Texas to our very own city of Joy, Kolkata. We were really all geared up to try out the tex-mex cuisine right here at our very own Quest Mall and that too during the Christmas holidays. 

The eatery here has got similar ambiance as it is found there in the US serving the same items, even the menu cards are just the same (with ofcourse the prices in INR!). The staff here is very knowledgeable having all the necessary information about the dishes which is really appreciated. We had been to this place on a Saturday without any reservation but did not face any issue finding a table for three in no time. Now let's come to the main part - the food. 

We had ordered for - the relatively new Orleans Jambalaya, Country-Fried Chicken, Bottomless Coke, Cheese Cake and the very yummy Molten Chocolate Cake. The Jambalaya according to me could have been a tad better and more intense in terms of flavor, it is actually a mix of veggies, chicken, shrimp, smoky bacon tossed with spicy Jambalaya rice. But we really enjoyed the Country-Fried Chicken - a crispy chicken breast that comes along with mashed potato with country gravy, corn-on-the-cob and garlic toast. The mashed potato with country gravy was really the star item, overall the dish was really delicious. And ofcourse the Molten Chocolate Cake topped with the ice-cream was simply yum! A must try for sure. The cheesecake could have been better, not like the ones available at their US branches. Quantity-wise one plate should be good enough for an adult. Pocket pinch - our bill amount for three was Rs.2036, which was quite reasonable.

Overall, a must try joint. I'm coming back for sure to get the tex-mex taste, a feel of a land thousand miles away. Will be back soon at this place to try out more of their dishes. Highly recommended!

Cheers!

The drinks are brilliant. I had the chocolate based non alcoholic drink. It was really good.

Okay.  So I had my first calamari at this place and I can happily say that now I'll always order their fried calamari every time I visit the place.  In spite of visiting the place at the rush hour, food was served within only a few minutes.  Don't go by the size of the pizza because looks can be deceiving.  Not only does the pizza ooze oodles of cheese, it also tastes divine! The decor and the seating are a bit too clumsy for my preference.   But the food more than makes up for it.

Brilliant atmosphere, great food. Got a taste of Texas cuisine and boy, it is indeed good.Even though I really wish they start serving beef steaks as well. Ordered two mocktails, Triple Dipper, Blackened fish and Country Fried chicken. Overall, really satisfied with the food quality, quantity and service.

Overpriced and wonderful. Well the food is amazing ,no doubt but the price is very high considering the quantity. Ambience ,cleanliness and food quality is very good. The service needs a bit improvement , I found the service slow and seemed they were understaffed. We had ordered the triple dipper , a baby back ribs and few more dishes , the baby back ribs was the best among all of them , the ribs very well cooked . 
Overall visit the place once,¬† just to have a taste of all the goodness but there are better places where value for money is more appreciated.

I visited Chilies thrice since it opened about year ago in Kolkata.

My first Visit was the best in terms of Food, service, ambience over all cleanliness. We ordered Triple dipper, medium cooked steak and pork ribs. Pork wasn‚Äôt that great but liked the triple dipper. And I decided surely visit next when they start serving alcohol.  

And I did‚Ä¶. last November was my second visit, we ordered Beer, Pomegranate margarita and crispy honey chipotle Chicken crispers‚Äô which were too good, in mains we had grilled tenderloin and cheese cake..These two were ordinary still service and ambience was up to the mark! Make me happily decide can visit again‚Ä¶ 

So my third visit was last weekend we again ordered Triple Dipper‚Ä¶ Pomegranate margarita and peace martini to start with. Sadly the all three starters were too much salty and test bad with my surprise! And drinks were not same what it should be and waiter missing the TREY while serving the drinks on our table! Poor service! When I mentioned to him, he was surprisingly arrogant!

As we already ordered Monterey chicken for mains‚Ä¶that seems ok at least.

This place is just one year young in Kolkata and placed in one of happening malls in the city, as regular diners would expect good quality of food and of course service‚Ä¶to make foodies like us visit again and again!

Howwdi partner, you have reached old Wild West. This place packs all the cultural culinary fusion of Texas and Mexico and adds a very worldly fast food decor to everything they serve. High praises for the portions as they may read less from the menu-card but on the plate turns quite a mouthful. Beef lovers will love the stakes and tenderloin burgers, while others have  a large assortment of other meats to choose from in burgers, pizzas, enchiladas, sandwiches, quesadillas, nachos and fajitas to name a few. Best for a Sunday lunch.

I love chili's. Them opening a branch in Kolkata was a delight! 
Monday to Wednesday discount on BURGERS!! 
I love their burgers. Not a thing on the menu that isn't yummy.
My first visit to Kolkata chili's I had GCB and a BBQ ranch burger.

GCB is THE BEST!
 
All their items are must try.

I disliked the fries though. Very tasteless. Blame the potatoes maybe. 

I Basically entered for desserts, which are a must have! But the burger discount and the big burger pic tricked me into ordering them. 

Overall a good experience.

Staff needs to pay more attention to customers.

Located in quest mall, its one of d most hyped places in Kolkata where great steaks authentic are offered.
The place has nice decor and an awsm bar n superb collection of drinks.
We had ordered a tenderloin, chkn burger, Texas cheese poopers n cherry cola n lemonade. The steak was done medium. All the food was very yummy Bt the seasonal veg were stiff and the fries lacked seasonings.
A special mention of the lemonade which had gondhoraj lebu, it elevated the simple lemonade to another level.
The waiters are friendly enough.
One must have a fat wallet to enjoy the place.
Definitely not a place for regular visit, but a place you would like to visit always!!
I would give a huge thumbs up

Well this place has a an extremely Western feeling. There's a small bar next to the eating space which I feel looks very cute :P The look of this place is like that of Pizza Hut. Food here is quite costly for students who save their pocket money to eat. Otherwise its nice. I have had chicken steak burger with fries, the BBQ fajita, shredded chicken salad and another something with cheese that I can't remember now. It was very tasty. What I like most is the huge beer mug and the steak sides. They have come up with an innovative style of cold drink serving. Its their signature style and I simply love it. Its perfect for throwing a birthday party :)

Quite easily the best joint inside Quest Mall. Chili's rises head and shoulders over its neighbouring restaurants - Serafina and Smoke House Deli (yet to try Yauatcha). You feel that sense of comfort when you walk in, assured that you'll leave with a full stomach and a big smile on your face.

The food I cannot fault. Contrary to what I had heard about Chili's, they're portions are brilliant! The food is without a doubt one of the best in Kolkata, and this comes from someone who has a bit of bias towards the older Park Street Restaurants. The fried calamari just blew me away! I had the same at Smoke House Deli and it was nowhere near as good there.

I also fell in love with the way they served their drinks. Large mugs, soft drinks. I missed out on the free refills bit, but I'll state it anyway - free refills on fountain drinks, but not on alcohol. I went for the Grilled Tenderloin, and also ordered Fajitas, something I will never regret. There are far too many mouth-watering dishes to be satisfied with visiting just once.

The staff too is great! Friendly, quick and professional. There isn't much to say apart from that they're efficient, and that's all that matters.

Be assured, whatever the bill may come to, it is well worth it.¬†
Thanks for reading, and pardon me for any grammatical mistakes I may have made.

At the outset I ought to tell you that I went more than a month back. So I might miss out on finer details. Apologies for that. Chili's basically exploits our love for all thing American, in this case food. As far as I remember, we had taken three plates of starters comprising cheese pops and some assorted non-vegetarian finger food. Considering we took two portions of the former and exercised much self control to not order another plate of the latter, lest we were too full for the main course, I was kind of depressed. And then arrived the gigantic main course. Six of us and here's what we ordered: buffalo meat burger with loads of french fries, fish n' chips, jambalaya and 3 beef steaks (rare and medium) with cheri colas and Budweiser's. All of them tasted great. Unlike, most standard continental restaurants, you can choose from a sub menu of 'steak sides'. So while two of us ordered the standard stir fried veggies, I went for black beans with mashed potatoes and gravy being the common part of all three platters. Honestly I didn't quite like my steak. But more than half my portion was polished off by the 'authentic steak lover' amidst us, (of course along with his own portion) and hence I am bound to say 'damn good Yankee apers'! I did like the black beans though. That's that as far as the food goes....But I have an issue with this weird custom they have. The waiter takes down the order by almost squatting down, the logic being you're at level with the patrons...if only societal disparities could be taken care of, that easily as well! Anyway, what I mean is, doing something different to grab attention can be off putting, to say the least. As for the decor, it looks like a typical American Diner with bright red sofas and largish tables in most part with inane posters on the walls. Bright yellow light and partitions at strategic corners. The price they charge is justified for the quality and amount of food on your plate...So yeah all in all, it was quite a good meal experience. Try it out!

Well lets just start by saying I just lovee Chilli's. Its an awesome place to try out american, mexican food. Unlike other restaurants in Kolkata who serve american food Chilli's food is authentic,  delicious and they give you huge quantity, thus value for money. We are almost regulars at Chilli's.  Some of thw dishes that I love and recommend are Cajun Club Chicken Sandwich,  Chicken Crispers, Crispy Shrimp Basket, Country Fried Calamari, Bbq Chicken Salad, Santa Fe Sandwich,  Molyen Chocolate Cake, Brownie Sundae. They have a great bar and make somw amazing cocktails, I personally love their Mojito, El Nino Margarita. This restaurant is a must for all foodies.

If you really want to come out of the conventional cuisines like Italian Chinese or Lebanese which are really common these days , I think chilli's is the place for u. With several Mexican delicacies and an American styled restaurant , the food at chilli's fill your soul along with your belly. One thing which you have to try is their desserts. They have 4-5 items tops but each one is as good as others.. Being at Chilli's is a treat indeed.. ????

Average American/ Mexican food. Casa mexicana is a better option however for true Mexican. Beef tenderloin is good, considering you almost don't get anywhere else. However it was a bit dry. Ask for extra gravy along with it. Mashed potatoes were good. Taco was okay-ish. Different experience, that's all.

The only reason for taking away half a point from my rating is that nothing in life is perfect. Chili's however, is almost there!

My husband Craig and I have been wanting to eat here for the longest. So we finally visited for our 9th anniversary lunch on the 23rd of November.¬†

First off, we didn't have to wait, yay! Taken immediately to a lovely table by Sarfraz. When I protested saying that it was just the two of us, and this table could seat 6, he said, 'First come, first served, Ma'am!' Isn't that lovely? :-)

Started on a bit of a miss - no Stella Artois or Hoegaarden. So we settled for Kingfisher Ultra with the calamari, the portion of which was gigantic (we were still eating it with our mains), deep fried to perfection and served with two awesome dips.¬†

Both of us, of course, wanted Ribs or Steak for mains. The baby backs were super inviting, but we ended up ordering the steaks (beef or buffalo, not sure).¬†

The Steaks were med-rare, as ordered, on the blue end of things. The generous accompaniments - yummy mashed potatoes, gravy, veggies. Craig got a huge portion of broccoli, which he actually finished!¬†

With no space left for dessert, all we ended up doing was selecting what we'd be eating on our next visit. And next. Hallelujah!

Last Thursday, for our anniversary lunch, we went to Chili's for the first time. We went there with high hopes, after reading the many good reviews, here. We literally "fell in love" with the place. The decor is amazing, staffs are friendly and their service is really good. We ordered Country fried Calamari for starters and Bacon Burger and Monterey Chicken for the main dishes with a mocha martini for me and a beer for my husband dearest. Perfect food. Satisfying portions and really awesome drinks, it was an anniversary well spent. Thank you Chili's. Hope to visit there, again, really soon.

This is no doubt my favourite place if you wanna feel the US old school eateries.. Visited here today again.. had some beer, Bacon burger and Classic Nachos. The portions served in the burger and Nachos are wholesome and delicious as they are...the cheesy Nachos just gives the in-your-face flavour! The beer was served chilled and the waiter was courteous enough not to bring the entire order together so that the food remains fresh and hot...also he was polite enough if I liked the food. Overall a must visit...especially on Mondays and Tuesdays if you are a pocket friendly person.

I know i might be a little out of place with a bad review for a really happening place of ¬†town, that has everyone going gaga, but this had to be brought into notice. Had visited this outlet earlier and was immensely pleased both by the volume and quality of the food.It was "Chilli's" from the US, and it was in Kolkata.

¬†The fabled triple dipper- i suppose the name goes more with the hype and less with the quality- 3pieces of chicken strips, ¬†wings,and egg rolls, along with 3 dips. Strips were awesome,large,juicy perfectly batter fried. wings were too small, too sour a sauce , lastly the egg rolls. i felt they were the worst of the lot. even the dips were average, barring the honey mustard mayo. My advice- go for the chicken strips with fries and extra helpings of honey mayo.

Country fried chicken is awesome, with its huge portions and a lovely well made corn on the cob.

Fish and chips are huge and filling, only complain- they use basa, large portions but kinda flat tasting. Suggestion- try Bhetki. Trust me, in kolkata we swear by it and you will find the difference.

Fajita Trio- is huge. One of us did not ¬†eat beef and they were happy to replace the same. Comes with a lot of dressing and accompaniments. Chicken steak was standout winner.

They serve their colas in a huge mug, and make a rich , too creamy choco milkshake. Mocktails and cocktails come in giant sized glasses and are yumm.

Booze is pricey- for the tax they charge is too high. but a pitcher of beer is the best way to go over there.

This negative review is based mostly because of the fact that this guy serving us repeatedly tried to impose some Jagermeister based shots when we were exploring our drink options.It was a weekday and i was in no mood for a drink. Then they strangely kept on forgetting ¬†about serving my milkshake although i tried to repeatedly ask for ¬†it. It was after i had almost ¬†finished off my meal , the guy in charge was nearby, he got to know about my order and served it to me. I was pissed. well almost. So please look into this matter.
Else- lovely place to go. and finally- Kolkata going Global. cheers guys.

What can i say about world renowned and majestic "Chili's. It has completely dictated its reign all over the united states and other major nations and finally made its way to the city of joy. This is the first branch of "Chili's in kolkata. It is located on 4th floor of Quest Mall. The presence of such a legendary restaurant has fostered the grace of quest mall. After hearing about the mouth watering savories of chili's i finally to taste it myself. Since then i am almost a regular over here. When you enter insidebthe den you forget about all your diet regime and fitness resoution. All its tantalizing cuisines ranging from American, Mexican, Italian etc you
are bound to binge like anything. My personal favorites among their world acclaimed offerings include- orange glazed salmon, bold taco, bacon burger, old timer with cheese, big mouth bite burger(just succumbing), and the anticipated "STEAKS"- TENDERLOIN STEAKS(mouth watering), baby back ribs etc. After my experience i can only say that your visit to quest mall is incomplete without visiting "Chili's and on the other hand dining out in "Chili's would be meaningless without devouring their majestic "STEAKS"(baby back ribs). So if you are a
don't forget to visit the "Mecca" of food i.e. "Chili's.

Chili's is one of the major reasons why Quest mall is a food lover's paradise. I've been there 3-4 times, and each time the food has been marvelous. Best dishes among the ones I've tried are the Mushroom Jack Fajitas and the Country Fried Chicken Crispers. Their mocktails, however, sound much nicer on the menu card than they taste.
The restaurant is mostly busy and a real crowd puller, which is more than justified. It is best to visit with a group of 3 or more if you're a person of moderate appetite-their portions are rather large!
The ambience, service and staff is all satisfactory, though on the slower side. Slightly on the expensive side, but no better place to hang out with friends over great food!

Chili's does no longer need any special mention now to the Kolkatans!! Ever since the Quest Mall came up and Chili's opened here, it has become a great crowd puller.
Kolkata is known for its food. And the people of this city are known for their apetite but the only thing which was missing from this picture was a place offering American Diner style food. As per our bong definations these food may not be proper main course but neither they are simply finger food. It fills u up enough for next few hours...but leaves you craving for more!! Good hangout place....go there with your girl gang (ohh...screw the diet regime) ;)....or simply catch u few bites while shopping. Not a fine dining option here but bar is well stocked!! So beers...i mean, cheers!!

Mexican food available--quality is good--review will be updated in details¬†shortly--ambiance is nice--well-decorated.Yes obviously costly.Bar available.Would recommend people for parties .Once I find the names in my bill--I shall upload more details--just photos uploaded as of now-however I don't know why I am unable to upload more photos. The food is no doubt delicious but not sure whether will be loved by all as I personally dot like baked mutton pieces.

Heard about this place a lot and so paid a visit . The visit was worth it . Great food in good portion . A perfect place to chill out with freinds . In drinks we ordered pinacolada and jager shot . In starters we ordered triple dipper and in main course we ordered fajita combo and tenderloin . The steaks were prepeared well and with a beer it felt awesome .

Worried about your visa to Texas?
All you need is to hop into Chili's at Quest Mall in kolkata. One of the most happening grill bar in your neighborhood. The Tex-Mex and American cuisine is on your platter.
The new flavor of cherry coke would make you nostalgic of your days in Texas. The Fajitas, classic tortilas and whole range of succulent and mouthwatering burgers are an absolute try. The prices are moderate and the staff are very courteous.

Ok so we had heard abnout this particular joint opening in
Kolkata‚Ä¶and were pretty much excited about it..what with the only Michelin star
rated joint in Kolkata‚Ä¶and yes it does live up to it.

Ambience ‚Äìthe d√©cor is not too opulent,but just how a Mexican/steak
joint should be‚Ä¶wood and wood and wood‚Ä¶with subtle lighting and ambient music!

Food ‚Äì ¬†Oh yes‚Ä¶they
all taste so good‚Ä¶yummy good‚Ä¶ ! so we wanted to try almost everything and till
now I have had the - - -¬†¬†tenderloin steak ‚Äì eat it while its still hot ‚Ä¶decent qty
and I love the potatoes !
the smoky chipotle chicken fajita steak was nicely done‚Ä¶the blackened salmon‚Ä¶very
very less in qtity‚Ä¶and‚Ä¶nothing extraordinary to my taste buds !

Triple dipper is a popular seller there‚Ä¶but d only good bit
are the wings‚Ä¶ ! HRC beats them though !
Texas cheese poppers were great‚Ä¶ juicy and soft !

The bacon burger may not be that big in size‚Ä¶but it
certainly is a bid deal when¬† it comes to
tase‚Ä¶juicy tender‚Ä¶but they may consider increasing the size what with Burger
King and HRC extending their arms in the country !

the cheese cake‚Ä¶a bit over priced but YUMMY‚Ä¶u need to have an acquired taste
for it though and yes‚Ä¶eat every spoon with the crust !

The brownie sundae‚Ä¶A Must Have ‚Ä¶ no explanations and no
details‚Ä¶ !

Service ‚Äì well behaved servers‚Ä¶chatty‚Ä¶at par with global
joints !

This is one total kickass place to "CHILL" out !! ;) A total All American dining with various & different food to eat out along with the drinks ! Visited this place with my uncle the day after Dussehra. Good crowd , good music was an instant hit for me because these 2 factors decide any damn place ¬†!! The Triple Dipper was fantastic !! It well went along with my Jack Daniel. The Sweet Onion sauce , I believe , was a drool factor. We wrapped off our dinner with the Orleans Jambalaya. This serving was pretty good & heavy. Loved the overall taste & quantity of the food served. Price a little bit on the higher side but the food is worth every penny. A highly recommended place from side !!!

Cheers !

Went to this place today evening to celebrate my better half's birthday. Was surprised to see a full house on a Monday evening (which quite shows the popularity of the place). We ordered for Country Fried Calamari and Tripple Dipper for the two of us and were planning to place the order for main course once we get the starters. Thank God we didn't give the order, the quantity was enormous for two and we didn't have any portion of our stomach left for anything else. The food was excellent and the service was superb.
Hope to go some other day with a few extra people so that we can also try the other delicacies as well ;)

Despite the fact that I'm not much fond of Mexican food, this place in Kolkata is great to hangout with friends. I would give full scores to the ambience and servicing. Texas cheese poppers were indeed cheesy and tasty in the starters. The maincourse quantity they provide in a platter can be easily shared with more than one. The chitpole chicken pasta and the smoky chitpole chicken fajitas was average. The chocolate chips smoothie was super! The sweet lemonade for my friend wasn't that sweetly appealing. Our stomachs were full for the day and couldn't permit us order the dessert. :P

First thngs first... my rating is not abt the taste of Chilli's. We all kno what a wonderful chain of resturants this is. My review is only abt this particular outlet in Quest Mall.

Having been to their other outlets in Delhi on multiple occassions... it was an obvious choice to try out tis place on a holiday afternoon.

Ordered my fav tortilla crusted chicken alongwith heinkien beer. Asked the server (just to confirm...though I was pretty clear in my mind alrdy)...if happy hours were on (time was arnd 5pm). He said "No sir! However we have this (blah blah) offer gng on". (Shock #1). So I repeated my ques bt the answer of the server didnt change.

So I had my one pint of beer and munched on my chicken. The server came to remove the empty beer mug and plate once I was done. Another guy cleaned up the table. Upon my asking for the cheque... after 5 mins... another server comes over and asks if I would like to have my other "complimentary beer..happy hours"!! (Shock #2).

I brought the issue to notice of the store manager...who accepted the fault saying that he himself wasnt clear if they were sposed to offer the happy hours for that day (being Gurunanak Jayanti) (Shock#3).

I had to tell them that my appetite was done and I do not wish to have the "complimentary" beer... which the manager gladly accepted. I was presented the bill for the due amt, without any discounts/consideration for the fiasco created by them!! (Shock #4).

But not being the one to create a ruckus over a "free" thng... I paid the full amout (I forget the exact figure..but lets say 555 arbitarily). I paid an amt of 600 (arbitarily) and the cash returned to me was Rs 40/-. I again called the manager to find out what hapnd to my bal 5 rupees... to whch he says... "Sorry sir.. we dont have Rs 5 change". (Shock #5). Finally I had to gv a him a piece of my mind in ethics and customer satisfaction... upon which they gave me a 10 rupee note... n I put a 5 rupee coin back in the bill jacket/folder.

What a ridiculously pathetic service and experience. They really need to get their act together!!!

Is someone from Chilli's adm staff looking into this? Pls respond.

The place was pretty cool. The waiters are very knowledgeable

Ordered chicken ranch salad, jambalaya and smoky chitpole chicken fajitas. Evolution and fusion mocktails. Ranch salad with bacon was awesome. Did not like the jambalaya that much, except the delicious juicy shrimps in the delicacy. And the best of the lot was fajitas. The chicken was like "sitting in eden with wine, cigs and pink floyds music".. It was served with tortillas, which were of usual taste. Mocktails were like not good not bad. But fajitas are still on my mind, man they were delicious. U get awesome food for some "awesome" pocket pinch.

I am not a fan of Continental or Mexican foods. But my brother and sister in law had dragged me to this place few days back. The ambiance was very good, we had to wait for all most 40 mins before we got a table. The attendants were very helpful and cordial. As i don't like this kind of cuisine, so might seem biased. We had Nachos, Crispy Shrimp Basket and Boneless Chicken Wings. As I was Ok with the tastes, that means they are very good for people who like this kind of cuisine. ????

Have always expected more from this restaurant. Maybe because of my run in with them in Mumbai. The food there was always awesome. However here it's not the same. Half  the time items would not be available. The staff avoid telling you the offers available. It gets its flow only by being in the mall. On its own I don't think it would have done well. Very average for a name such as chilies.

Tried the above mentioned dishes and when their menu tells u they "serve generous portions" please believe them. 

Would love to go back and love encourage others to this place too.

Chili's is a restaurant which impressed me a lot in Mumbai, and when I learnt that they have opened an outlet in Kolkata, I was beyond excited.

One of the things I really love about this outlet is the view. Fortunately, we went there on a stormy day, and we insisted on a table beside the window. We were rewarded with a majestic panorama of a rain-drenched city which just made our day.¬†

I was a bit disappointed when they told me that they were out of baby back ribs as I was really looking forward to it. We ordered the Country Fry Calamari and the Tenderloin Steak. The squid was crunchy and not too dry and the dips served with it really enhanced its flavour. The steak was cooked to perfection. One just had to cut it to see the juices oozing out.

On the whole, a truly delightful experience. Will be returning again in my quest for the ribs.

Well where can i start. There food is mouthwatering. Simple yet delicious. They have given there style to many classics bringing them alive to another level. A must is their varity seafood section. Also do once try their tenderloin. As for the people who need a glass in hand . This place has every thing to please many a connoisure plus those who want huge mugs of a good broth. Special mention to their bartender Neel. Though a scotch guy myself, i have tried many a cocktails at many famed places. But have ro say this guy knows his way around a bar and can whip up anything according to ones personal taste .

This place is a perfect gateway to relish quality mexican food and american classics.It is a well known restaurant chain all over world and the each time it just suprises you.

Location : Quest Mall.

Ambience :The is very ideally planned out to cater the requirements of all the age group.It has both dining as well as over the bar seating arrangements.

Food :Th most important part of any review is the food.We opted for a tripple dipper,classic nachos for appetizers.
    Triple dipper : The chicken crispers and the southwestern egg rolls are crispy and tastes good.But the chicken wings were bad in my opinion as excessive vinegar covers the taste of the chicken.The three dippers are the best and specially the sweet one.

We went for chicken quesadillas and cottage cheese fajitas with two non alcholic bewerages ( blue pacifico and fusion).

Chicken quesadillas are amazing.They serve the US version of it as they first melt the cheese and thereafter add the ingredients.

Cottage cheese fajitas : They come with three tortillas and sizzling cottage chhese which provides an exciting dimension to the food.The dish is good for non spice lovers.

The mojitos were the best part of the meal.My suggestion would be to go for blue pacifico as they had the perfect blend of virgin curacao and pineapple.

Price : The price is pushed towards the higher end.But as compared to the quantity,I would say it was veryy decent.

Try them out....I bet you wont come out with a sad face .

Can't really believe what happened 
The two big points are one for the third time in a row no baby back ribs (a signature dish) and then the regular blame aways on suppliers etc point is you can't be out of stock again and again . This is worse since in bangalore which had more than one chillies this has never happened

Secondly taking a cue from my last line it is about experiencing the same restaurant in different cities and not only about judging this restaurant alone over others in the same city (having said that chillies in Kol is not as great as a lot of other restaurants)

Lastly no Calsberg beer available and when my second choice dish (blackened salmon) arrives and I am just about to start s waiter comes and says we didn't cook blackened salmon but blackened Bassa !! Wow ever heard that !!

Ambiance : 3.5 / 5. Fun, slightly noisy, but quite easygoing and relaxed, good atmosphere overall and nice place to just hang out!

Service : 4.5 / 5. Very good, courteous staff.¬†

Food : 4.5 / 5. That's the best part about this place! We went for the kicked up steak quesadillas, and wow they were delicious, the steak was done to perfection, with the perfect amount of cheesiness. The dips that came with it were great too. We also ordered bacon burger, and must say, they were amazing too, and the burger patties were also cooked perfectly medium well. We also ordered beer, and it was served ice cold.

Value for money : 3.5 / 5. Here is the tricky part, we went on a Tuesday, so we got the one on one menu, and thus we got one bacon burger, and half the beer for free, and the bill was still 1500/-. So it was value for money. Now if I had to pay full price for the whole meal, then, no i would definitely say it is way too pricey, but worth a shot, and you should definitely go on Mondays and Tuesdays since they have happy hours on drinks AND food all day! Although keep in mind they take like 35 % taxes.

PS : The buy one get one menu for Mondays and Tuesdays is great for vegetarians.

Chili's was on my wish list for quite some time. All the reviews & photos on zomato, not to forget the international reputation of this joint were teasingly inviting me & I was waiting for a chance to check it out. Got that chance yesterday ... also the 'buy one get one free' (BOGO) offer on Mon & Tue on selected items & drinks was equally tempting !
So we walked in yesterday evening & the place was absolutely buzzing unlike the other ones in that mall. Decor was hip ... Crowd was hot ... Service was crisp & our beer pitcher was chilled & was served in huge frosted mugs. 650 bucks for a couple of those 1.5 ltr ( remember BOGO) droughts was a sweet deal !
Coming to their food ... we had chicken wings & cheese & mushroom quesadillas. Chicken wings (300) were crispy on the outside & juicy inside ... perfect ... except the sauce which was way too salty. Quesadillas (325) were great ... crunchy & oozing with rich cheese & mushroom sauce on the side of sour cream ... went well with our beer.
Thought of trying out their bacon burgers but by that time we were quite full & happy.
So now eagerly waiting for a second chance to try out their burgers & tenderloin steaks. Hopefully my second shot at chili's will be even more exciting !

The foods extremely good. Drinks are cheap. The ambience is nice. The staff is very polite and friendly. The only problem with the place would be that not too many  options for vegetarians. On Tuesdays they give away one dish free with every dish you order but on selected items. The place is a little expensive but then it's quest mall.

Always wanted to visit this place. Specially after visiting Smoke House Deli. :)¬†
To begin with, the interior decor is pretty attractive. Reminded me of TGIF. The menu could have been more properly spread.
Love the mugs in which they serve water :) Ordered for a BBQ Ranch Burger which was pretty neat. Didn't taste exceptionally good though. But it was overall a pretty satisfactory one.
Service was also okay.
Definitely a one time visit with your gang!

If you want to feel Texas, GO. The ambience, service and value for money are spot on. The waiters are friendly and you can do with some advice. The food is delicious and some dishes come with a corn on the cob. The mocktails are amazing and cheap. Absolutely lovely experience. 
Must tried
The pork ribs
The shrimp alfredo
Virgin pina colada
Black salmon

Great ambience, mexican food and free refill of beverages! The quesadillas are really light and crunchy, the stuffing is delicious! Cheese poppers come a tad too oily but they are the right amount of cheesy... Overall, it's a good place to hang out with friends on a special occasion... they make a big fuss if it's your birthday ;-)

The place has some great tasting food to offer in a wonderful warm environment with comfy seating and soothing lighting. The food is reasonably priced, cooked to perfection and served in generous portions. The spinach queso was a delight and so were the veg quessadilas. The waiters were extremely courteous.. also the service was quick. The strawberry lemonade is an absolute must try for anyone who likes fruity coolers.

To start off, the new Kolkata outlet of Chilli's doesnt fall short of delivering good food as according to the expectations set by its other branches. The order came on time, and the person attending was very cordial in his approach. One suggestion, a lemon ice tea couls have been a tad bit better, but then it doesnt compel to say anything bad for the overall experience.

After visiting the Hyderabad Chili's outlet almost once a week , I was truly excited when Chili's opened in Kolkata. Finally got a chance to visit it today and was highly dissapointed. The onion and pepper rings were nothing compared to the ones I had in Hyderabad. The onion pieces were not even rings.... the sauce was flat... we choose roasted chicken with cheeses which came with a side dish of broccoli (fresh and crispy) and rice (inedible yet again)..... so we decided not to spend anymore... we also ordered two beer during the happy hour with the one plus one scheme.... and the bill came to us with prices charged for both... Alas!! I decided to keep my encounter with another of my Chili's favourite,the big mouth burger for another day.. service was ok but the ambience of Hyderabad Chili's was dearly missed...  duh!

Visited the place for the second time yesterday.the old school bar and low-hung lights just pump up the ambience to another degree.Our first call was the most popular appetizer here,Triple Dippers.perfectly fried meat and some 'wow' dips,this one is a people's favorite here.The southwestern rolls and honey mustard sauce are a personal preference though!Quesadillas were up next and were the best i had in kolkata.Crisp buttered tortillas,fresh sour cream and tangy pico de gallo-people,you cant miss out on this one.For main course,we ordered roasted red pepper chicken which i presume is new in the house,and blackened salmon.Chili's gets a thumbsup for how well they cut and prepare the chicken everytime! It just melts in your mouth. Though the spicy glaze was good enough,i prefer chile lime chicken to this.The salmon,just the way it should be-ladened with fat,soft and creamy to the touch,and mild. I wish it was cured a bit more.And to end the entire experience, my 'must-have-dessert' award goes to Paradise Pie!The name of a dish has never been more apt.From the first spoon to the last traces of caramel,this is a beautiful wedding of icecream,crumbs and cake put on a plate.This one choice can never go wrong.
Would i visit this place again?- definitely, never been surer :)
P.S: Chili's,dont run out on tenderloin next time please :)

Visited for the first time when my best friend took me out to celebrate my 22nd birthday. Nice ambience, awesome view by the window. The food is really nice and the price is also legitimate. The waiters are very well behaved and friendly. They sung me a birthday song and made my day even more special! Definitely gonna visit again. Credit goes to her who took me out to this awrsome place to hangout.

Really loved the blackened smoked fish with shrimps! Yummy :D

Chili's had been on my wishlist for long and finally made it on my visit to Kolkata this Durga Puja. Had to wait around 15 mins to get a table which was perfectly fine. The place looked impressive...warm and casual.¬†

As both my friends were veggies, we decided on the Texas Cheese Poppers for starters along with Strawberry Lemonade. The stater was yum....crisp on the outside with melting cheesy goodness inside ! Wish the quantity was a bit more though. Loved the lemonade...some may find it a bit too sweet for their palate but I personally love strawberries.¬†

For mains, my friends decided to share the Veggie and Cheese Quesadillas while I decided on the Country Fried Chicken. The food didn't take too long to arrive and looked awesome. I jumped right into my dish....a chunk of the crisp fried chicken along with a bit of the well seasoned mashed potato and the sweet corn made for the perfect bite ! My friends loved their dish too and found the quantity to be more than enough. I found my dish to be just right quantity wise. We were too full to try any dessert.¬†

Overall, had a great time catching up with old friends over delicious food. Made for a memorable day....4.5 stars from me. :)

Massive Let down, lets get to why:

1) Table policy- We decided to go during the Pujas and of-course there was a rush so we were told to wait, when I gave my name at the entrance the lady wrote it down and I was maybe 4th or 5th in line and I counted at-least 10 people that went in before us. So immediate disappointing start.

2) Service staff- More interested with putting on fake accents and giving me a thumbs up and selling me alcohol than service. We had like 2-3 different staff during the course of our meal. Had to ask 7 times for a glass of water.

3) Menu- Ok I've had better, much much better to be honest, the Triple dipper was a big let down, the cheese poppers were ok. They did not have RIBS ( another big bummer, u have like this entire Americano thingy going and no RIBS). Please never try the Tandoori Burger no matter how hard the service staff try to push it or even if they offer it for free.

After the disappointing wait time, disappointing service staff and mostly disappointing food we left as we didn't want to risk dessert. A big NO NO from me.

went to this restuarant a couple of months back on a january evening. had never visited the newly opened mall in the city, Quest. so decided to go there. saw this huge food joint and made our mind to have food there. its good, the food is deliciously tasty. but be sure that it will burn a hole in your pocket. had planned to have just evening snacks, but the food tasted so good that we ended upon having our dinner there instead.

went there twice, even have visited their Mumbai, powai-wala branch! ¬†:) ¬†its too good, lip-smackingly good! ¬†:) ¬†In Mumbai, their fish-filet is damn tasty!

One of the few places reaching remotely close to Hard Rock Cafe standards in the city, in this budget range. Cool and friendly staff, nice ambience, good music and fantastic food make it a must visit destination! A nice bar counter where you can drink as well as dine and some cosy seating with privacy. Don't forget to try out their fan favourite steaks (Baby Back Ribs especially), fajitas, quessadillas, tortillas and seafood. It tends to drill a moderate hole in your pocket. But the food served is of quite decent quality and quantity as well. I would say quite a good value for money spent! Birthday celebrations at this place are truly fun.. thanks to the energetic staff... try it.. throw a party here!

I went to this place during durga puja. It was full and we had to wait for 15 minutes. One thing I must mention is that, even though it was full, service was very prompt. I had gone there with my fiance. We ordered a mock-tail, blackened salmon with shrimp sauce and questadilla explosion chicken salad.¬†
My fiance was apprehensive that the salad wont be enough for my dinner (I eat a lot), but when the food arrived, we were totally impressed by the quantity.

¬†The salad had lots and lots of iceberg, cheese, shredded chicken and vegetables. It came with a delicious dip. 

The blackened salmon was baked and a shrimp sauce made with tiger prawns was served on top. It had a portion of stir fried vegetables and rice. A tangy dip was served with it.

We loved the food and the interior. As for the price, I think its totally worth it.

There are some restaurants which always give you the feeling that you are at the right place even before grabbing the first bite. Chili's is one such place. Having seen updates from many of my friends, I decided to serve my palate with an awesome lunch during the festivity of Durga Puja. I must say was pretty lucky to have got a table within 15 minutes of waiting. Do go in with time on hand.
Coming to the food, was a little surprised to see the number of menus they have. Too many options to choose from. Perhaps one would need to make a number of visit to get through all of them. The collection of cocktails seemed impressive as I decided to go for one of the many varieties of Margarita. Though was not able to try many of the options in food, the quesadilla was really impressive.
Overall a must place to visit in kolkata. Awesome food and drinks coupled with just the right ambience for a lovely dining experience.
Keep up the good work.

Having food at Chili's was about fulfilling a wish. I went there with my beloved ob this puja on ashtami. The restaurant has a feel-good ambience and the service was very friendly. The price of the food is a bit costly for young ones but still one can afford once in a blue moon. I ordered Tripple Dipper ( 3 types of chicken preparations in a basket wid dips), BBQ Chicken salad and Chocolate Chip Paradise Pie in desert. I will hv to emphasize on the desert as it tasted deliciously lip smacking. Perfectly made...each layer of cake, cream, pie and nuts can be felt. The dips was really good specially the mayonese dip. Food was well cooked...soft...and the flavours can be enjoyed. I was really overwhelmed after having food from CHILI'S.

Went to this very tempting restaurant on the day of shubho bijoya. To start with we have to wait for 25 minutes which is quite expected on a holiday. Ordered a strawberry lemonade and a chocolate shake with an appetiser called a triple dicer. The drinks were really nice. The appetiser was really nice to eat. The chicken was juicy and very tender. The ambience is nice as well which makes it in my list of recommended restaurants to visit.

Chili's sounded very inviting to me since the time they have opened. I have been meaning to visit but could never make it. This puja, I strengthened my resolve and made it a point that we take that detour to park circus. Quest is probably the most beatiful mall in Kolkata. We took a leisured your of the mall to work up the appetite. Finally, we arrived. The hostess noted our name down and asked us to wait. We obliged happily. What good things in life are not worth some wait??
Finally we were invited in and seated inside while they were readying our table. I lived the decor, especially some statement pieces. Seating seemed cozy yet not crowded. The bar was a vision, very very inviting. After about 5mins we were seated at our table. We decided to order a round of drinks and we went the cocktail way. We ordered a long island iced tea, president's margherita and a blue pacific margherita. The LIIT was very good, refreshing and punchy. President's Margherita was lip smacking too. Personally, I did not like the Blue Pacific so much. But overall, drinks made us pretty happy. 
For appetizer we ordered, fried calamari rings and the triple dipper. It took about 15 mins. I was really looking forward for the Calamari rings but found most of it to be tough and chewy. My companions didnt like it at all. There were two dips with it which were good. The triple dipper had boneless chicken wings, chicken fingers and southern style egg rolls with three dips. The chicken fingers were perfect. Golden crunchy batter coating a soft perfectly cooked chicken strip. I did not like the boneless wings due to the barbecue sauce coating it which tasted stale. I just loved the egg rolls. Diced chicken, corn and spinach inside a crisp golden pastry.
For mains I wanted to order the Buffalo tenderloin steak but sadly it was not available. So I ordered the tenderloin fajita instead. My companions ordered blackened salmon and a Chile Lime Chicken. When the food arrived it looked downright mouth watering. The fahita was a sizzler, with 3 white tortillas and a plate of salsa, grated cheese and a dollop of creme fraich√©. The task was to wrap the meat, pepper, onion, salsa etc in a tortilla and eat. After a couple of tries it felt like  a chore so i had everything separately. The buffalo meat was nicely done. Bite sized slices had a wonderful smokey flavor complemented well with the sweet caramelized onion and peppers. The fish, although we ordered salmon, was in reality a white fillet, and they did not inform us. Anyway my friend did not mind. Sides included some mexican rice and steamed broccoli. The fish was  a huge portion, well cooked, white and flaky. The rice was spicy. Steamed broccoli was like steamed broccoli.  The third main was a sizable piece of chicken breast covered in a chile lime sauce with mashed potato. The mashed potato was good but not the creamy fluffy version i expected. But it tasted pretty decent. The chile lime sauce was very nice and the chicken was moist.
We were bursting at this point but still could not resist the sinful looking desserts. So, we ordered a single slice of cheesecake. One bite of it and we were in heaven! The high point of the whole meal.
Service was good but considering they failed to mention the availability of salmon, i cant say its very good.
The bill came to about 4000/-, 900/- of which consisted of tax of various kind. Price is on the higher side considering the food. My experience in this place was average. I am not very impressed with the quality although i cant really complain about their quantity. I would love to visit again to try the burgers and the pastas. But i dont think my expectation will be sky high.

Great food and super service. We went on the 3rd night of Durga Puja. We didnt book but landed up around 10 pm. Had to wait for about 20 min for a table but was worth it. Ordered the chicken cheese nachos and cheese stuffed poppers as starters. Followed up with chipotle chicken pasta, chicken quesadilas and home made fries. Mexican food at its best with oodles of cheese, guacamole and sour cream.

Planning to go again soon.

Having heard quite a lot about this food joint, I had agreed to give it a try during a brief visit to my hometown.
The ambience was very much like a regular bar n grill joint which wasn't amusing and not disappointing either.
I was accompanied by three friends and one more was about to join us soon. So we decided to spend time by ordering a round of drinks and starters.
We found the food prices to be a bit on the higher side.
The drinks were marked at expected pricing. However we later got to know that a 27% alc. tax was there on all drinks. This meant a pint of beer would cost around 230 bucks. I would consider this very overpriced.
A good thing about chilis is its warm and polite service. Inspite of there being quite a queue outside, not once were we rushed.

Now let me discuss and rate the food and drinks we had:

Drinks: Long Island Ice Tea & Bloody Mary
Not the best that I have had but acceptably mixed.
Starter: Tripple dipper
A mix of chicken wings, chicken crisper and southern eggrolls. Nicely done.
Main Course: Classic Fajita with tenderlion steak, Citrus Fire Chicken and shrimp, Blackened Salmon served with rice, all very nicely done
Shrimp Basket consisted of 9 pieces of shrimp and a lot of fries and costing around 375 bucks was definitely overpriced.

If you are ready to let loose your pocket, chilis is worth a visit or two. Definitely a good place to hang around with friends for a drink or two.

Really good food. I went there with some of my friends. Ordered the really highly rated country fried calamari and it indeed is worthy of the highest praise. We also ordered some other dishes and they were also good, but the calamari is really the one that sticks to your memory. The relatively low rating is because of the fact that for the price that they charge, the qty is really low which was surprising considering the fact that people couldn't stop gushing over the large portions on this website. Also, we thought the waiters were not up to the mark as we had to ask twice for both water and ice. So if you want good food and have a lot of money to spend then go on ahead and enjoy the really awesome food. If you dont have the money however, there are cheaper options out there.

Chili's is one of my personal favorites however my last visit to this outlet literally changed my opinion.The service was literally disastrous& not any where near the courteous service I have received there earlier. I had ordered for a pulled chicken burger with a lamb patty, Cajun chicken pasta & a paradise pie for dessert . They served us a burger where the burger bun was so soggy that it was literally falling apart. On communicating the condition of the burger they were courteous enough to replace it but the replaced burger had visibly half the portion of stuffing as the first one(I have showed the pic I have taken of the initial burger to the manager & his expression itself made it evident that I was in no way misrepresenting it) to which the staff meekly replied as no the portions are as per their standard measurement. We were served the bill halfway through the meal although the dessert & the other ordered dish( pasta) was not even served to us. such kind of a messy or irresponsible service is never expected out of a food joint like Chili's.

Chilli's was in my wish list for sometime now, finally visited the outlet on Tuesday, Durga Puja eve. We were greeted with warm smile, shown to a table at the far side and promptly served with food and drinks menu. As appetizer, we ordered a tripple dipper - a combo item with 3 types of starters and 3 dips. Upon insistence from the waiter, we ordered the main course as well along with the appetizers - a BBQ Chicken Salad and Chicken Enchiladas. The person taking the order confirmed the order in which the food needs to be served - so far so good. 

Dissapointment starts when we were served with the salad first - god knows what were they thinking. We kept the food untouched and waited for our appetizers. Seeing this, another house staff approached us and tried to sort out the problem. His solution was to start the salad since the tripple dipper will take more time. And within seconds the tripple dipper was served - horrible management. Southwestern eggroll and chicken crispers in the tripple dipper were good, didn't like the wings much. Salad tasted good but nothing special, enchiladas might do with a bit more spices - tasted shabby. 

Everything in the outlet is so punctilous, the greeting, order placing, friendliness of the waiter, the food isn't bad either. And we were in the "happy hours" time, got a free cocktail as well. But one cannot ignore the fact that they served main course before appetizers and that too after confirming the order of bringing the food to the table.

Great ambience, wondeeful service, lip smacking food. Ordered for a pepperoni pizza which was delicious. Sitting arrangement very comfortable and above all I can bet you wont feel a pocket pinch atall considering the prices are very competitive and reasonable. Bar menu is stunning, liquior price is very reasonable indeed. 
The only thing they can improve on is the music they play. In that case Irish house which is just beside would have a serius competitor under the same roof.

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† The price is on the higher side

We ¬†were three people . we had 4 blenders small plus one for happy hours. one paneer pajita, one Triple dipper ( ¬†MUST TRY AWSOME) ¬†and one cold drink.. The bill amount was around Rs 2000.

I was so happy to hear about opening of Chilis in Kolkata. So the first thing i did during this holidays after coming from Delhi was to visit this place.
The food taste is as usual awesome and started off with my favorite triple dipper. The burgers nd fajitas are also worth every penny. A special mention to the child menu as my nephew also went along. They had a good choice of food nd beverages for the kid.
If you like Mexican and american food this place is a must visit

Since moving out of Kolkata for quite a long time and missing the opening of Chilis in Kolkata, i made a point to try in here after coming back to the city only though i had it in Delhi also..still..anyway, came home yesterday and 1st outing had to be in here. Located in the top floor of Quest Mall near park circus, this place just cant be missed. A young charming lady welcomed us and assisted us to the seats,had to wait for like 5 mins because it was packed on Saturday night. The ambiance is very international, with wooden finishes and a glamed up bar counter with bottles of Chivas regal, Johny Walker resting on the shelves. *sigh* :P¬†
Anyways, coming to food, we ordered
1. Grilled Buffalo Tenderloin- A slow roast medium well done buffalo steak that comes with an option of 6-7 sides from which you can choose any 2. We chose French fries and Corn on the cob. The meat was a pretty big portion of Beef, entirely juicy and a mild burnt scent on the outside..tasted lovely with the Corns, but fries were a letdown, not enough crispy and relatively less salty.Later felt that mashed potatoes would have been a better option.
2. Orleans Jambalaya- A new addition on Chilis' menu , cooked jambalaya rice with diced diced chicken, bacons and sauted shrimps generously mixed with crispy bell peppers, tomatoes and onions. This dish was a bit on the spicier side, with strong presence of black pepper but quite tasty.
3- Carlsberg- Needs no mention..a chilled pint of this in a forsted beer mug to accompany or rather complement the Steak.

A bit pricey you can say, but the portions and quality justifies it.¬†
Service is good, waiters are knowledgeable and waiting time was never more than 10 mins inspite of an packed restaurant which is surely appreciable.

Overall a really nice foodie experience and a must try place for foodies who¬†loves to munch on some global cuisines. Cheers!!

We went to this place on a friday evening it was little crowded...

We ordered tripple dippers and chicken wings..which was quite nice...but the sauce provided was pathetic...

We ordered classic steak fajitas and roasted red pepper chicken...chicken was good but the steak was no way near to what one might expect...

The waiters dont have any idea of what are the different ways the steak can be searved....
We asked for medium rare and they gave us well done...so that made the meat quite dry.

For the dessert we ordered molten chocolate cake..that was quite good..

But since this is like a franchise of the American Chillis we expected the same or at par quality..but it was no way near to that level...

The ambience was quite cool but food not upto the standard to visit twice.

One of the first Restaurants to open up in QUEST Mall, CHILI'S is situated on the 4th floor (adjacent to INOX ticket counter). As soon as you enter the Restaurant, the ambiance strikes you and you feel that you are entering an American Food joint. The Restaurant serves Italian, American and most importantly Mexican cuisine. The separate Bar Counter is a great addition and apt for friends who want to drop by after work for a drink or two. The staff is polite and cheerful and the service is quick - Average wait time is 7-10 minutes. Lastly and most importantly, the food looks and tastes great. The pictures on the menu give a good idea and you start salivating from then onwards. The food portions are good and so one should be careful before ordering. The Must Trys - Triple Dipper, Classic Fajitas & Burgers. The Salmon dishes are good too and could be tried. Unfortunately the Calamari didnt work for me. The downside? the amazing amount of Taxes and Charges - more than 30% of the Bill amount!

Still, a great place to dine with your friends and family and is a Hit on a weekend as well as on a weekday!

I've been to chili's in the US and I loved the experience there. I believed to get somewhat similar experience here too.. Since it's a chain. 

The items don't have the same standards. Being located in a premium mall, it should maintain the same international standards with the food and service, which it does not. The staff is not trained as per the international standards. The sauce offered have international names which again might be unknown to common people here, but the chain should not hide behind the lack of knowledge of others.
My suggestion is that they should do a self check and invite a group of foodies having international taste who would visit secretively and provide their honest comments.
I hope the management learns fast or this place will become a one shot stop for many like me and my family.

After drinks at Irish House, this is the ¬†right place to get your grub.. Highly enthused and energetic service, smiles all around.
The Price does pinch a bit, but the quantity and the quality of the food makes up for it. For drinks we only had a Margarita which comes in a small cocktail shaker and is good for 3 servings each.. Overall a Filling Experience.
P.S.: - To avoid the Que purposely reach a little late..

And oh my gosh i love desserts so i loved their cheesecake. One thing to complaint and its that i ordered the ranch burger for take away and at home i saw there was hardly any ranch at all. Sad.

I am writing this review after almost one month of my visit as it left me a lasting experience of dining in kolkata.

The ambience and decor were impressive resembling more of a pub. We ordered Grilled chicken platter, Chili's chicken enchiladas and Smoky chipotle chicken fajitas. The chicken was tender and tasted delicious with cheese and sauces. The vegetables were properly steamed. Then we ordered Minty melon which was just too minty. For people like us with not much appetite a platter might be too much for one.
As for the service, it was fast and the staff was polite and friendly. 

Overall the experience was awesome. . Worth many more visits!

There has never been a time when everything on the table didn't taste good. Just had a dinner where nothing except then side of broccoli was good. There was guacamole missing in the nachos which we were not informed about. The worst ever was after our complains two of the staff members who heard us said they would check what they could do and just disappeared until the bill appeared.

It is a beautiful place but is a bit over priced.. the food quality is excellent .ambience is good and also the service. Very good american dishes..quality nd quantity both are very good..loved the burgers and tacos .yet to try out fish nd pasta dishes.. a must visit place..ever monday and tuesday u gt a buy 1 get 1 free offer but the items are very limited on that offer.. over all a gud place but pinches ones pocket.. a very unique and satisfying experience..worth the money spent...

On our next visit ..tried the fish and chips.. the big mouth burgers..nd fajitas( nly d chicken variant) and the tacos.. nd triple dipper nd cheesecake fr dessert...
coming to the fish nd chips..it ws awesome..the fries were crisp..the dips complemented the light battered fish fry( basa fish i think) ... the burgers as usual were huge with nice grilled patty...however given the price i think they can increase d size of the patty..newyz ample fries to eat with..
the fajitas were good nd are served with warm tortillas..the tacos were not that gud..the amount of chicken and bacon very less and scattered everywhere....
coming to the triple dipper..xcept the puny chicken wings..d rest of the items which included southwestern egg rolls and boneless chicken crispers were great.
last but not the least..the cheesecake was a delight..small in portion but tasted yumm..specially d nutty base which complemented d soft cheese cake on top..
again i felt its a bit overpriced considering d vat..service tax and some other charges which is around 30%

But its not a place for Vegans as they have least options and the food in veg is not very good, i ordered a Margheretta Pizza and a Jalapeno Poppers, and i could finish them as none of them was good, the drinks blackberry iced tea and mil shake was good though, K ordered for a Chicken Dish which she liked.¬†

So they just need to work on veg food, rest all is good.

We had the following:

Turkey Club Sandwich - Good, the french fries could have been better though!
Country Fried Chicken - okayish, the mashed potato that came with it tasted heavenly, the corn was too big to handle :P
Roasted Red Pepper Chicken - too good, however they could have spared the rice¬†
Iced Tea - average
Cherry Cola - too good

Overall it was a very good experience. The waiters were quite friendly and helpful. If only they could soften the music a bit for us, the addabaj Bengalis, it would have been perfect.

Eagerly waiting to go back for their renowned beaf steak.

Though not that huge areawise, the place is pretty lively with the ambience.
Classic Nachos and Country Fried Calamari were the top ones in Zomato review and it was all worth of it .
For main course we had ordered Blackened Fish and Enchalidas and both tasted great!
Coming to desert , Chocolate chip Paradise pie is simply Heaven! We immediately ordered once we finished one.¬†
Overall a great place for foodies :)

I just couldn't help but gel out a heart felt 5 out of 5 for this place... :D.. The Zomato menu caught my eye, which had a certain page which said that you order one plate of food, and get the other for free. Well I was surely eager to try how true that was, and the very next day we went to Chili's! This offer is only on Mondays and Tuesdays, and we went yesterday. We were four people and ordered the crispy chicken tacos, the BBQ chicken salad and the classic chicken fajitas. Knowing from beforehand, that Chili's serves in large quantities and planning to order desserts, we kept our mains in check. We were not at all disappointed when they served us with assorted fillings and three extra tortillas on the side complimentary with the Fajjitas. The tacos were nice and soft. Although they said it came with bacon, we really couldn't find or taste any. Next came the Fajiitas. It was searing hot served in a pan, and was good to eat. But our personal favourite was the BBQ salad, which was tasty and fresh. The lettuce and cabbage was well dressed in olive oil and cream, and blew our minds away. The staff was really courteous, and took quite a few group pics of the girls gang :) Must say, they were really persuasive so as to we do not miss out on any frees, and we explained that we would opt for an extra dessert as a free to the 3rd main. Must say he was really happy with our full utilization of the order :D
Next came the desserts. We ordered two brownie sundae and one paradise pie. Must say this was the first time I didn't like the brownie that much. But the paradise pie was plain and simple awesome. It had the right amount of nuttiness and crunch to it.¬†We had also ordered for two Tuborgs, as they too were one on one (for domestic liquors, and one on two for imported) and it has really low alcohol taxes too (only 10%, same as the rest of the food ) . We were really impressed. Would love to come back and try their famous mojitos in goblets, baby back ribs, tenderloin.

When I first decided to get dinner at Chili's and read the reviews on Zomato I was utterly confused. There are some real bad feedbacks, and some saying it is amazing.

And I did not know what exactly to order when I get there. I wanted something special, it was an occasion, and I have recently started eating healthy.

So here goes my experience. The ambiance is more like an American pub, if you get to sit window side you will get a good view. The service is very friendly, which feels good, specially when you are not sure what you want.

The appetizers looked very heavy, so we directly went to the mains. We ordered Maushroom Jack Fajita and Orleans Jambalaya. And a iced tea. The tea was really bad, too sweet. The prawn in the Jambalaya was very good, fresh, but the rice was too tomatoey for my taste and I didn't get any other taste in it. The rice if served with prawn should have some prawn/seafood taste in it. It did not. But the Fajita was really really awesome. I made it up, with the chicken, salad, sour cream, guacomole and cheese inside a tortilla, it was amazing.

But about the portions. We were not heavy eaters, and each of the plates were too much for one. So next time we went we got the soup (it was chicken and mushroom) and Fajita (this time we tried Smoky Chipotle Chicken). It was just the right amount.

We tried the Kicked-up Quesidillas once, and it was lovely too, with the dip and the sour cream.

I am really looking forward for our next visit, when I will try the fajitas with black beans and rice. :)

Today we visited chili's at quest mall, kolkata. We are pure veg Jains and we ordered veg mushroom soup but were served chicken mushroom soup inspite of mentioning that everything would be veg before ordering anything. This is a criminal offence and we can sue you for this. And on top of it while leaving, the staff had the audacity to say that they did not charge for the soup with no guilt no apologies. This is not at all expected from a restaurant like chilis.

Quest Mall has given the people of Kolkata ¬†Chili's

I have visited chili's in mumbai which was nice and then when i went to chili's kolkata it was the first ¬†restaurant to open in quest mall and people went crazzy..there was a que to enter this place at any point of time during the day

¬†The ambiance is superb and the way they invite you, it really feels like a guest ¬†They have huge a menu but that basically targets the non vegetarians.I tried the nachos and few other items from the menu in which i found the nachos to be the best. The mocktails/cocktails are amazing and the bartender prepares them in a very delicious way which leaves you wanting for more...
Its a nice place overall serving good food but the target audience is basically non vegetarians as the menu offers them more choice then it offers to veg people.

Wonderful place to grab a quick bite or have a meal or just watch a game with beer/margaritas and the whole decor and cheerful and happy staff makes the meal all the more delightful. They serve and awesome chili (living up to the name of the place I suppose) and even better fried kalamari rings.  Their steak is good and filling (though I realised mini burgers aren't my thing, too much bread too little meat but then again that's the way it is designed to be. Their steaks are good too and service EXTREMELY prompt. On a very busy day our food hardly took 10 minutes to reach the table. Even their desserts are good and the cheesecake deserves a special mention. Now for the minuses. In 3 visits I'm yet to taste the sought after and famous baby back ribs which seem to be eternally unavailable and on the beverages page be ready to be short changed. While the page heading says bottomless drinks (the menu at the restaurant now is different from what's uploaded here) it is only applicable to aerated fountain drinks (though not mentioned anywhere) so you want a 2nd diet coke (served in a can) or another lemonade (that too is to die for) prepare to shell out double.

located in the sprawling quest mall..chilli's is hard to miss for those catching a movie at inox!!
went there on a monday afternoon n still had to wait for a good 20 mins to get a table!!after getting a table the first thing i noticed was the expression of the ppl around me tucking in their food!!so expectations rising, we ordered for veggie bbq ranch burger and onion rings and strawberry lemonade and veggies as sides!!
as our server told us that the order wil take time,we asked him to connect us to the wifi , to which he said was down for the past two days!!while going thru the menu i saw that the options for vegetarians were quite limited as compared to non - vegies!!well,soon the food arrived!! and i think saying that the steamed veggies was the best part of our order would be enough!!the onion rings was too oily and the burger cold and soggy!!expectations ruined and being a hectic day for the servers, there was none who could do something abt it!!well,i can just hope it was a one off incident but as they say- the first impression is the best impression!!

Though I am not very fond of American food but this is one of my husband's favourite restaurant purely for the kind of food they serve. The food served by the restaurant is very unique as compared to other restaurants in this part of the country. One can always go to this place to try out their Tex-Mex delights.
The stuff members are very cordial and well behaved. The price is at par with the other restaurants in the premium mall.

i have been to the chili's in pune and was less than impressed by that outlet, so wasn't expecting much here.¬†
the servers are well trained and extremely cheerful! :) the kind that would get away with serving bad food...
BUT i have no bad food to report,¬†
we ordered¬†
the fried calamari and lemonade to begin with, calamari was crisp and satisfying and HUGE portions! the lemonade was also pretty perfect. the calamari came with two types of mayo, one great the other ok.
next was a classic beef burger, and the grilled tenderloin steak. again... the portions are enormous. having ordered two plates of food, we realised that after the crisp calamari starter, just one plate of food would have been more than enough. the burger came with fries and with the steak you can pick two sides.¬†
the only thing i can say that was not positive about was that the steak was cold by the time i was halfway through it. maybe i am too slow an eater for steak. but despite arriving on a hot plate the beautiful steak went cold before i could finish it. having said that i must admit that it was yum. the sauce that came with it- i completely ignored. just added a little salt to my taste and some of the freshly ground pepper.¬†
for dessert there are limited options and after questioning the waiter for a while (barnik saw someone being served something that wasn't covered in chocolate) we ordered the cinnamon and vanilla molten cake. this too is big enough to be shared.¬†
all in all a great dinner and i would like to go back for more!

Located at 4th floor of the Quest Mall.

** Brief = I have been itching to go there and finally the day came today and was accompanied by TB :P Ofcourse I wanted to have 5 pointer place to score my century of reviews :D

** Ambiance = The ambiance is superb and the way they invite you, it really feels like a guest :) They have huge colourful menus having pictures which make u drool for more. One thing I would like to mention that the pictures of the menu are not misleading, they really serve the same food. You must see the pictures to believe it :)

** Things tried = We went for the all famous Triple Dippers in the appetizers along with Cherry Cola and Chili's Frappe.
The Cherry cola came in a huge mug and had minty taste to it. The Frappe was thick,smooth and perfect :)
The dippers had 3 different chicken dishes with 3 of the most tasty dippers, i loved the thicker one the most though. The chicken were perfect, fresh and fabulous. This is must have for all !!

In the mains we ordered, Southwestern style Chicken pizza(6") and Chicken Club sandwich.
The pizza had so much cheese that it almost melted in every bite. The chicken club sandwich was huge. It came with french fries. The chicken slices were thick and superb. We decided to order for desserts earlier, but when the server came to ask for it, I immediately said NO, we were literally filled till our throats !!


** Recommended = Triple Dippers,Chicken Club Sandwich.

** Purse Check = Rs.1800/- for 2 would be perfect.

** Overall = I just loved their dishes.Though I couldn't have their fajitas or the steaks. But ofcourse with the Durga Puja coming soon, & I would try to hunt this place down again and try them out.¬†
I AM GOING BACK FOR MORE :P

Thrice in a row had, extremely extremely disappointing experience. We deal with enough scorn, rudeness and disdain in our daily lives, and need not visit a restaurant and be in their receiving end. Food / menu for Chili's are standard everywhere so would not go into that. But the staff refusing to acknowledge your presence and followed by almost refusing to take the order I'm trying to place and trying to push their new menu to the point of being brash and adamant, when I actually had to call in the floor manager (Who himself had a very rude demeanor) . Throwing down food and beverages on the table like we had come in begging for the food. The list goes on. No I'm not a glutton for punishment to return thrice, unfortunately my Son is very fond of the Chili's menu, and hence the returns, but in my books the third strike is definitely 'Out'. Thankfully there are other outlets now available with exponentially better service. I have sworn not to return to this outlet again. I sincerely hope if you visit that you have better time. If anyone reads my previous review you'll notice I had a very high regard for this place, but I guess complacency is setting in. I had changed my rating as well, and that essentially covers the food and the view,and absolutely nothing else because they do not deserve a score....

My earlier review for reference I had scored it 4.5 then-

A much hyped joint, so had to finally check this out, and if I may add very pleasantly so.
From the word go the stewad(ess)s¬† were very cordial guiding us to the table and following it up with there own little inputs whilst ordering, they had the menu by heart even had the answer for the most insane Q's my wife (who's very finicky about her food) threw at them. The food was brilliant, the steak, the salmon, calamari all fresh and done to perfection. I was a bit worried regarding the salmon being a bit dry as the tendency is of imported fish and the local chefs mostly have a habit of overcooking a thawed fish but thankfully I was proven wrong.

To add to the list plesant surprises we were there on a Tuesday where you have¬† 2 for 1 offers on domestic liquor and¬† also on a special menu, so my suggestion is to be there on a Monday or a Tuesday to avail this. Our bill for four came to around Rs 4200/- (money well spent).¬† Add to that a spectacualr view of the city, warm cozy decor, helpful friendly staff. Well needless to say I definitely would be visitng again.

Every review here tells me how good Chilli's is but i was a tad disappointed after my visit to Chilli's. Let me tell you why
1) fist i ¬†ordered ¬†southwest style eggrolls which are supposed in to come in tortilla breads which were unfortunately they were made from white flour.
2) ordered a rare done tenderloin steak- they brought me a well done one, gave it back, finally got me a medium done one, ¬†but i was really hungry by that time so ..... i have to admit the quality of meat was good and the seasoning perfect.
3) then i got myself a ¬†cheesecake- ¬†they got the crust wrong, had an intense flavour of vanilla which should have been more subtle and the filling could have been more cheesier, maybe they should use a ¬†cheese with a higher fat content.
Considering they price they charge they have to keep an eye on the quality of ingredients they use. Overall a satisfying experience.

Chili's is special, mostly for its out-of-the-box menu. This is the second time I dropped by, and it didn't fail to surprise me in more than a good way. One piece of advice, though. You have work on your presentation, that'll just be the icing on the cake. Keep it up.

In a mood to have proper continental food? Then Chili's is a must visit place.. 
For the starter we ordered triple dipper which had three types of starters of chicken and fish  along with three great dips. 
The pepper jack grilled tenderloin and  blackened fish with lime shrimps were the dishes we ordered. Both were made to perfection and served with great garnishing. 
The brownie point was that the place serves draught beer which compliments the steaks you will order in the perfect manner..
All in all the ambience, the food, the drinks and the service will pump up your mood and leave you with a content feeling of happiness..

Chili's had been in the wishlist for a long time and finally made it there on a Saturday lunch with a friend. ¬†The decor is simple and the ambience is impressive. We had decided to try steaks and ordered A Grilled Tenderloin Steak. It was really nice with generous proportions of mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli and garlic bread and tasted really nice. Next up, we ordered a Classic Fajita Steak. It was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious with the sour cream, cheese. The service was really prompt.

Overall, a very nice experience and looking forward to ¬†try some other dish in the next visit.

First up, I have been there just once and that is a shame. We went for a few bites and a drink or two. I managed to eat enough to have to skip dinner. Had couple of their frozen margaritas and they were nice. Bloody Mary followed and those were nice too. Not sure why they were stingy on the celery with those. We ordered the veg nachos which were loaded with cheese but I didn't like them much. It was more like a nachos pizza. I prefer liquid cheese all over like the one in Irish House. We also got the quesadilla and they were amazing. I generally prefer my own version of quesadillas but these were way better. The cheese cream mix and mushrooms. I found the rice a bit odd but doesn't matter much. I may revise their rating up after I sample more of their stuff. Oh weirdly enough they don't the burritos!

Second time here in as many weeks.. Chili's will keep you coming back for more. Robust, fiery, colorful Tex-Mex cuisine that tastes as good as it looks. Portions are huge, be prepared to get stuffed; drinks, fairly average stuff. Its soaring popularity, though, brings with it soaring decibel levels, so hearing and getting yourself heard might not be very easy. Overall, a place that holds promise.

The Great American Hard sell - an escort to ur table and u are told the name of the waiter who will serve you, multiple gaily got up menu cards, steel and glass ambience and the waiter when he appears after a slightly uncomfortable delay crouches next to your table and u are talking to only a head if ur are seated in the farside.

The food is good enough though there seems to be some trouble with standardization across the country as reported by those who have been to outlets in other locations.

But coming back to the Kolkata outlet, there seems inconsistency in the taste even between visits in two months. To be fair the standard did not fall to unacceptable levels. Meats are juicy, sauces tempered to enhance the main dishes, and servings substantial. The desserts are forgettable.

The real problem is that there seems to be a glitch in the operating process. In both the visits the waiter - separate ones- got orders mixed up. In a neighbouring table orders were forgotten. 

In the second visit a happy hours menu gave one on one free that did the much needed value recalibration. 

But I still wud recommend a visit for there is no comparable place in ambience or menu (need to check out Dixie at Kidderpore)

This is an upmarket joint and does not pretend to be value for money but the service charge ensures you end up tipping for indifferent service.

This is a place which like really impressed me. Starting from ambience decor to music and food. Loved every bit of it 
Went for a grand dinner here. We took the tripple dipper starters. It was tasty and had generous portions
Next we ordered a Grilled chille lime chicken and fajita trio. The chickn was grilled and dressed to perfection.  The fajita trio was a combination of chciken shrimps and buffalo meat. Just too good. 
For beverage we stuck to sweet lime soda which came in beer mugs. 
This place is a must go.

Think about burger, next thing comes in my mind is chili's. To an extent this restaurent have failed to maintain the standard specially when it comes to burgers! Been there for quite a few time now. I liked fajita, south eastern eggroll, nachos but I would say I had better food in delhi and hydrabad chilis!

I don't know why, but maybe I visited Kolkata at the wrong time of the year because this was another restaurant where I was disappointed with the service. The food was amazing and the waiter was courteous enough to let me know that a particular meal I was ordering had pork in it, which I had overseen. Looking forward to visit the place again since the reviews have been good throughout by others.

It took me three delightful visits to make a firm point this if one wants to eat worth every copper Chili's is the place one Must must must and again Must vist. the ambience just calm you and makes you feel that you are a part of wild wild west movie....you are relaxed the connoisures treat you like they you have been there regular customer though it's probably your first visit...and then when you go through the well concocted and structured menu you know you are in for a treat tonight. I would like to extend my heartfelt apologies to all the KFC's and McD's in India...but hansdown the Burger's at Chilis are the best best best one could get. Whqatever you take comes in Huge Huge Quantity. I have become an ardent fan of their Cherry Cola. The first we went we ordered A triple Dipper which was three Western Starters and we enjoyed every bit of it and a Counbtry Fried Chicken. I would not like to tell anything else as that would be a begger talking about a gucci gown....Taste,Quality Quantity impeccable. Next we Had Chicken Crispers and again Triple Dipper and their Mouth Watering Gooey Molten Chocolate cke....man it was indeed a sinfull delight. Last visit was on impul;se with anoffice collegue and i tried their Cajun Burger with extra helping of bacon and that uantity was toooo much even for a hogger like me. For the first time i had a perfectly cooked chicken burger with the right amount of accompaniments and huge helping of fries....My friend's husband had their FamousTenderloin Steak and it was Medium Well ...perfect to the T. Now what surprised me was You get free refils of Soda and The Pinacolada came in a huge huge tumbler unlike other restaurants.
In a nutshell...Worth every moola that left our Pocket.
Thanks Chilli's for giving us the best gastranomical journey as of yet.
Kudos

What a place. Simply in love with this place. Been there a couple of times now with my girl friend. To start with its at the 4th floor of the Quest Mall at beckbagan, ballygunge. the interiors is just so soothing and the ambience is awesome. I chose to sit at one of the window sits at the back. The menu card was just bringing waters in my tongue and so it took us some time to decide what to go for. 
Going more by the pictures we ended up with Grilled Tenderloin for me which comes with grilled toasts and two choices of seasonal side dish where i selected mashed potatoes with gravy and steamed broccoli. And she selected Quesadilla explosion salad with chicken. Believe me we had one of the finest quality of food there. They were just delicious and handsome in quantity. 
I would suggest you not to give a miss to the grilled tenderloin ever. 
Price is though on a bit higher side, the food compensates all. 1200+tax for two.
The staffs are good and polite and keeps confirming the orders.
Looking forward to visit soon.

Starting with the ambience it was such soothing and enchanting. Food portions were massive. We started with buffalo steak and enchillads with colesaw.Food quality is no doubt fantastic :)
Would love to visit der soon.

Visited Chili's few days back on weekend and it was almost packed. We ordered 2 Triple Dippers,1 crispy chicken tacos,1 grilled tenderloin,1 Blackened Fish with shrimp,3 cocktails and 1 beer and the bill amount was 4300. The most shocking part was they charge one extra 10% TAX by their own which is the worst part of Chili's. I asked the waiter about that TAX and he told me that it was their own TIPS which was Rs 317 (10% of the bill amount excluding taxes). I mean who the hell are they to decide how much tips i will give!!
The food and ambiance was good,service is awesome.
But with respect to value for money, I should have rate it a big 0.

Located in Quest Mall - Chili's is one of the most trendy place to chill out..

Almost the kind of restaurant Kolkata had been waiting for.....cool seems ideal word to describe this joint. The brick finish , the view from side, the trendy bar all add to this feel. Mayb it was just me , but i sincerely felt tat the ambience had a real out - of -India feel to it..

This place has lot of Mexican, American , Italian options available for both veg & non veg. If u r a meat lover u r just going to love this place...for vegetarian - u hv to know d menu very well to make d r selections... 

V ordered one 5 cheese pizza which i believe is d most juicy cheese pizza . Vegetarian fajita and zesty cilantro veg pasta were simple dishes wid fancy name. But d veggie & cheese quesadillas served with salad n sour cream was soo delicious n mouthwatering. The taste still lingers in my mind..  Had some really gud food in some really ling time..

For drinks v ordered minty melon- looked catchy but was not tat great. Chilled frappe was ok... 

Service here was quick n prompt. The staff here r friendly, knows their menu well enuf to help u make ryt choices..

Overall a good experience n will look frwd to visit this place soon. 

P.S - a little expensive place but totally worth it.....pocket pinch ( Rs400-500per person )

This place remains packed on weekends. Unfortunately, that is the only time I get visit Quest. Therefore, one such weekend, I took my mom along with me to Chili's. This was her 1st visit, so she wanted to try an assortment of their choices. 

We took Calamari fries, Grilled Chicken, Garlic Bread, Side of Tortilla and Mashed Potatoes, large colas. 



As you might be guessing by now, the quantity was overwhelming for the two of us. We had to ditch the dessert obviously. Summing up, its a good, hearty place full of comfort food.



P.S. - Need to try their newly upgraded menu.

Have been hearing about this place for quite a some time now.But very frankly speaking the hectic scedule of my work was preventing me from visiting ds place.So finally one fine afternoon me n my frndz decided to just push aside evrythng n satisfy our tastebuds.
The moment u enter the place u get a feeling dt ur in a typical place whch u see almst evryday on some food channel.The place to me was not very impressive.......quite small for a hyped restaurnt lk ds one.
Coming to d food.......for starters we ordered the triple dipper,country fried chicken and the bbq salad......frankly speaking I loved the fried chckn n salad but for the dipper.....I wasnt dt impressed.....specially wd the egg rolls.
Next came d main course: Kicked up quessadillas,smoky chipotle chicken fajitas.....nice,tasty n filling.......d mocktails dt we ordered cosmopolitan n margarita were refreshing too.......
Nice place for once in a while visit wd frnds to splurge on food......my nxt target....baby ribs????

It was my friend's birthday party and we decided to go out. We had two choices....either flame and grill or chili's. In the end we decided to go for the latter. We didn't regret our decision one bit. The mall itself is very beautiful. The ambience inside the restaurant is very well maintained. The waiters and the manager is very courteous. The food was served pretty quick and it was absolutely delicious. I can't remember the last time I had such good food. I would recommend going to this restaurant it you live in Kolkata.

Heard about this joint for quite some time now...I got the opportunity yesterday...though The Quest Mall has thrown in various choice-able and palatable options to choose from viz. The Irish House, China South, Smoke House Deli...me n my wife opted for Chili's because we both enjoy Italian Food...We loved the ambiance...American Diner Style...courteous staff and a enthusiastic Supervisor - "Sarfaraz"...For starters we ordered French Fries and Classic Nachos along with a pints of Heineken to wash them down and make us ready for the main course. Nachos were crispy as we like with excellent toppings.

For the main course I ordered Crispy Chicken Tacos with bacon and my wife ordered Orleans Jambalaya without bacon. My Tacos were crisp and chicken inside them were crispier outside with juicy inside coupled with black beans masala creation...awesome to say the least...Well I tasted the Jambalaya and found the combination of the spices very good to melt in our mouth...the shrimps were well cooked but found the diced chicken pieces not soft enough...

Overall it was a really good experience with my 3.5 yr old son also enjoying the bits...I do have a lot of other dishes to try out from...hope to visit in near future.

Was out with friends on a Saturday evening to chilled out for some time went to quest to check out Irish Pub but since it was full we settled for Chilli's and I don't regret my decision as it was an absolute worth visiting this place. located on the 5th floor of Quest was quite full on a Saturday evening but no waiting scene.
¬†So we went in and settled down in the sofa area and within a span of few seconds we knew what we wanted to order.¬†
as we were in a mood to eat we did not waste any further time and ordered Classic Nachos (total yummy )
Crispy Shrimp Basket & BBQ Chicken Salad and the food was just awesome to taste and totally worth super yumm specially the Nachos and since we frequently travel to a lot of countries I guess I had such good quality food in Kolkata after along time serving such good Mexican food hmmmm loved it totally and we hogged till we finished.

Ambiance nice with good music tho it was a bit loud , staffs are courteous and friendly and they love to reconfirm their orders I guess. lol okay over all a very nice experience with quality people and had a great quality evening. one should definitely try out this place sure shot recommendations.¬†
looking forward to visit again.

Been to Chili's a couple of times. Once when it opened up and second during the first week of August 2014. To simply put it this way " I liked it" - the ambience, the crowd, the music and the food. I do not want to build an over expectation but if you are answered what you are looking for, you tend to be satisfied and so was I. A hangout place with family friends was needed and it satisfied. Now that booz is also available, makes it complete. On food, I liked chicken nachos, baked salmon and shrimp alfredo. What missed out was that many of the beers on menu weren't available like I wanted Hoegarden but could get  Corona only. The waiters aren't good in english much ( which you expect to be in an Americano kind of rest o pub) but they are courteous and have been trained to take orders in style....you got to check this on a visit. Another plus, they have a smoking room within the restaurant which saves you the long walk out in between meals. But saying all this, its a family joint as well as I could find kids during my both visits and especially, they have a special kid's menu....

I went to Chili's yesterday with my family. We ordered a Triple Dipper, a BBQ chicken salad and Orleans Jambalaya. The service was pretty quick and the server was quite knowledgeable. The salad was a bit bland and had an excess of cabbage IMO but the other items were good. Will definitely go there again!

I had visited this place earlier but the bar was yet to be opened. Last night i went in with a couple of my friends. We were more in the mood for pubbing so our first choice was The Irish House but as luck would have it there was no place to even stand there. So as the second best option we went to chillis. We ordered spinach qeso and chicken quesadillas. Both of them were really delicious. A special mention for the spinach and cheese sauce and the sour cream served with the dishes. In the drinks department we ordered for LIIT which was very well made and we ordered for their presidente margarita which again was exquisite. They say its one of the best in the world and i would be inclined to agree with them. All in all a great experience once again.

Taking time out of our busy schedules, my and my girlfriend finally had a chance to visit this popular restaurant in South Calcutta on a rain drenched Sunday afternoon. We reached at 1pm, just in time to avoid standing in a slowly building queue, considering it was a Sunday. Reaching after 1:30 pm would invariably delay your weekend lunch at Chili's by at least 45 mins, but it's definitely worth the wait!
The ambience is nice and the staff are courteous. The menu offers a wide spread of mouthwatering delicacies, each of which are served in generous proportions. This being our first time at Chili's, we ended up ordering way too much for two people. It's therefore advisable to assess your group size ( and appetite!) before placing your order to avoid any wastage of food.
Coming to our order, we went ahead with a Triple Dipper to start with, followed by one plate each of Blackened Salmon and Roasted Red Pepper Chicken. The Triple Dipper was a delightful appetizer, with chicken wings, chicken crispers and egg-rolls served with 3 dips completing the experience. The Blackened Salmon was a tad disappointing and bland though, but the Roasted Red Pepper Chicken made up for it. The succulent chicken breast topped with cheese was cooked perfectly and served with rice and steamed broccoli. We were extremely disappointed on learning about the unavailability of the Baby Back Ribs on that day, and so decided to go for the Grilled Tenderloin Steak - a favourite among the customers. However, the Tenderloin steak was not so tender, and we had a tough time cutting it into pieces - so make sure your steak is perfectly cooked. All this while, we quenched our thirst with a Strawberry Lemonade and a Cherry Cola - two refreshing drinks served in huge beer mugs - enough to last till the end of the meal.
Desserts at Chili's meant that the Molten Chocolate Cake had to be on our wish-list! It is the most wonderful cake and ice-cream combination that I had ever had - a must-have if you're visiting Chili's. 
Overall, our maiden Chili's experience was pretty satisfying. Would love to come back again!

Chili's,located at Quest mall in Beckbagan, is a gastronomic delight for the Calcutta foodie. This is a great addition to our city's eating out options which for a long time bordered on the boredom of staple Chinese and Mughlai cuisines. I visited the place last month on a cloudy afternoon with a friend. We got a seat by the window overlooking Syed Amir Ali Avenue. The view was itself worth a million bucks.
The decor was artistic yet simple. Service was prompt and professional. We went for a Triple Dipper which was highly recommended by friends who had been there earlier. It was nice with the egg and the chicken nachos making quite an impression! Following the wholesome crunchy starter, I tried to be experimental and ordered a 'Jamboulaya'. The decision turned disastrous. The rice portion of the dish was unpalatable. But, I must admit, there was a fair amount of diced chicken and prawn in it to keep us interested. The preparation is quite heavy and it becomes arduous to dig into more after this speciality! 
The bill came around 1100. It was great fun surfing the menu which boasts of some exquisite mexican and spanish delicacies. Will surely go back and try some more in future!

I would advise my friends to visit some other restaurant. Food was just about okay but service not apt at all. ¬†Firstly no temp. Control for the air conditioning. Extremely cold inside , when we asked for them to lower the temp. They said it was not possible. Thats really silly. Only a handful of vegetarian dishes. Anyway the worst part was when we had to wait for 20 mins when we wanted to pay by card. ¬†A chilly experience at chilly's.

Poor service to say the least.¬†

Vegetarian Food is average, if not below par, but way far from being good.¬†

Costs are nominal wrt quantity. However, too much of money is contributed by service charge.¬†

Again, yesterday, we had a chili served cold. then it had a lot of spice in it. People have to be called twice or thrice to entertain you.¬†

I would only go there, if i have no other option in Quest Mall as a Vegan.

I have visited this place quite a number of times ... In fact,the first time i tried chili's was when i was in Hyderabad.The one in quest mall is hyped. Atleast i would say that.The triple dipper is obviously the common man's choice when it boils down to ordering something with beer as it consists of 3 different stuffs.The chicken wings are too tangy ..otherwise the southwestern rolls and crispers are fine.They havent still introduced beer pitchers and towers which i disliked.The happy hours are a crowd-puller and its best to visit this place during this period.The strawberry lemonade was prepared nicely.The tax is whopping and creates an unnecessary hole in your pocket.But one cant help it either.After all,it spells and exudes Americano..3 stars from me

I am happy to know that Chilli's have opened their outlet in Kolkata. The ambience and decor is very good. Bears little resemblance to the original US outlets. Staffs are very polite and courteous. Food quality is awesome. In just 2-visits, we are yet to explore all the flagship items here. But I would like to recommend "Fajita Quesadillas", "Kicked-Up Quesadillas" to those who likes Mexican Delicacy. These are so delicious!! In most of the item you will find bacons. After having a scrumptious dinner you won't feel much about the price which is bit expensive (Rs.1200 per couple)!

Worst Mexican I've ever had. The first time I went the food was uncooked and the second time it was quite atrocious. Do not recommend it at all. I felt sick after eating the food.

I don't understand the reason for the huge hype about this place. The Triple dipper i ordered for starters and didn't like it one bit. The Burgers and sandwiches aren't that extraordinary in taste! The Baby Back Ribs with Honey Chipotle i loved a lot, but the serving wasn't enough for a foodie like me.

I came to know about via friends and zomato only and with much expectation I went to this place and ¬†I must stay that Chili's surpassed my expectation of the place by a fair amount. The ambiance and the decor is worth mentioning and the service is also very good and the people are very nice and friendly, a bit too courteous I guess. The place is a bit expensive, the quantity is also average as compared to other places, but the quality is not compromised at all. The club sandwiches and fish quasedillas is simply highly recommended for those who want to explore their taste buds.

We went there simply because its word of mouth publicity was very very good. To tell the truth, we were not a whit disappointed. But be warned; they do not take reservations so it is best to go early if you want to avoid standing in a queue at the lunchtime rush. This restaurant has a bar as well which is at the other side of the family seats. The wooden feel of the place coupled with large windows that open out to an expanse of blue sky gives the place an airy feel.
The food...the menu is mostly North American with occasional forays into Mexican and Caribbean foods.We were greedyto taste all the appetizers but realised it wouldn't be wise to fill up before the main course so we settled on the Triple dipper which had three appetisers, the Chicken Crispers, Chicken wings and Southwestern egg rolls. The last was a little ho-hum but these were served with three dips which were quite generous. Pork and beef are on the menu but on enquiry we were told that pork wasn't available at all throughout its chain of restaurants ¬†in the country. We did not ask about the availability of beef.
We had the Chicken Ranch Salad, the Country fried Chicken that was served with a huge helping of mashed potatoes, a slice of garlic bread and a piece of corn on the cob. This is a crumbed and battered chicken breast, a little too big for one person and a little too small for two people to share! The Orleans Jambalaya was delicious with its mix of bacon and prawns not to say the herbs that seasoned it. The Blackened Salmon that we ordered didn't quite live up to its hype...the juices hadn't infused the fish but the accompaniments to it the saffron infused rice, the honey-dijon sauce and the spinach tomato mix were tasty enough.
A word of warning...Indians tend to share the food that they order in a restaurant but this is a purely western style one so individual servings are given. Those often prove too much for a single person and too little to actually share so prepare to order adequately.

I entered chili's with great expectations and great reviews from people. 

And I am happy to write that chili's surpassed my expectations.

Quantity of food: too good for medium quantity eaters.

Quality of food: too good. I have tried and tasted their club sandwiches,  roasted red pepper chicken, country fried chicken, fajita quesidillas a few mocktails over my  visits to the place. 

The sides served are also good. I love especially the smashed potato and corn served with country fried chicken (one should keep the thought of calories apart once inside chili's :-P)

The fried calamaris,pizzas,tripple dipper all are very good.

I am yet to ffind something that I don't like in Chili's:P
 
Service: that will pull you again to the place. All the people are very young, very courteous,  helpful and have a smile on their face ol d times. They are able to describe the food well on asking.

Price: though on a bit higher side, the food compensates all. 

 While coming out you will be so full and content money won't matter!

After the disastrous experience on its second day of operation, I had pretty much sworn off the place given the unappetizing levels of dripping oil and the ridiculously slow pace of service. But I am glad to say that after an affirmation from many friends I decided to give it another shot, and another and another ha ha. Now, I knew my first experience wasn't the real deal as I'd been to the chillis in Delhi and Mumbai and loved it, but first impressions often do effect you immensely so when I was forced to go again, I am pleased to say that I went again and again.
The Fish and Chips are simply one of the best I have had in India and definitely the best in Kolkata. Honey Chipotle Chicken, Fajitas, grilled chicken, burgers and ribs are all great. But a word of advice, since we are Indians, take the servers suggestions otherwise some of the typical TexMex fair thats more inspired by American faves can be very bland and boring, like the chicken crispers and egg wrap.
But speaking of American, the portions too are very american. My wife and I have a hard time choosing since we always want a third dish but we know two is more than enough. Plus, I it's disappointing they dont have onion rings as a side as their onion rings in some of the dishes are scrumptious.
So heres how I would rate it:
Food: 3.5 (They can give smaller portions and lower prices so people take more variety. Plus I WANT ONION RINGS and it would be nice to have options other than just chicken and beef mostly) Oh all right, its a close 4
Ambiance: 4.0 It delivers what it promises. Love the bar side section.
Service: 4.0 They have really picked up.
Value for money: 4.0 The portions are excellent for the price.

The name was in the air as soon as Quest Mall was unveiled. It was a sudden plan on one of my friend's farewell party and we ended up at Chill's. We were overwhelmed with their service and were amazed to see the vivid menu they have. If you're a Mexican foodie, do try this place as they are their best. ¬†Calamari which is made up of squids and for what people travel all the way to Goa, is one of the best delicacies you would expect there. ¬†And if you're looking for something special in Meat, Chili's serve well done Buffalo meat which is worth a try. And considering it price range , Chili's isn't a bad investment to bring Mexico to Kolkata.

Praise the Lord, I finally have a proper place to eat all the Tex Mex cuisine I want. Chili's is the best place to try out burgers, fries, shakes, and everything related to American fast food. The ambiance is brilliant, service is top notch and the most important thing, the food is excellent.

I ensure that I visit Chili's at least once every two weeks. The portions are huge as well, you might say its a tad expensive but who cares when the food is so good?

I don't mind waiting 30 minutes, like I have had to do every time I have visited Chili's and a piece of advice, you have to try the Cherry Cola.

Thank the Lord for Chili's, am one happy, stuffed , regular customer.

Jeet ke aayenge!

Update: Things are still the same old and that is a good thing! Gopal, our Chilli Expert as I call him, was extremely courteous and helpful in our ordering and the friendly staff is another reason to visit the joint!

This place is just great. A visit to this restaurant can make a foodie's day. The ambience is too good,service is pretty fast and the most important thing the food is awesome,starting from soups to desert everything is great. The creamy mushroom soup was too good. The appetizers are very delicious,especially the honey chicken crisper was amazing. Their burgers are gigantic but tasty at the same time. Even the fajitas taste good. I was only disappointed with one dish which they calimed to be a new  dish in their menu. Coming to the cost, its a bit expensive for a students point of view but otherwise its ok. Its a must visit place for meat lovers and people who eat pork must try the baby back ribs. They will serve u the best ribs u ever had.

Chilli, Quest Mall, Kolkata

Our visit to the super dooper Quest Mall on Park Circus , Kolkata had us rather exhausted and pooped, besides being hungry. On 4th Floor we discovered massive signboard for Texas steaks. Being steak aficionados we decided to check out the menu. Bags and baggage we walked into Chili‚Äôs and parked by the large glass window pane. 
Appetizer extended from Nachos, Wings to Quiso, Onion Rings and all things Texan bordering into Mexico in the range of Rs.175/- per plate to about Rs.350/- . Seemed great and comfortable to the pockets as well. The soups seem rather Nuevo, something different from the usual we Indians are pushed into since decades, such as Terilingua Buffalo Chili , a thick wholesome soup with Terilingua, Texas, tender chunks of buffalo meat, slow cooked in onion, chili and topped with cheese, besides other soups of the day. . The range was from Rs.125/- per cup to about Rs200/- for a bowl. I know most of us would tend to abhor the type of meat in discussion, but honestly ‚Äì Its different! Isn‚Äôt it? However, am not a soup/zouppa person so we went straight to the main course.
The offerings were loaded with Quesadillas ( pronounced Kaise di ya) basically Fajitas wraps with meats, Tacos crisp wraps with salads, meats and the quintessential ‚Äì Steaks Grilled Tenderloin at Rs.500/-  or Baby Back Ribs at Rs.1500/- for a full rack or Rs.800/- for a half rack with BBQ (Barbecue sauce) with choice of fries or mashed potatos. 
Word of advise in sauces Chipotle sauce, Barbeque sauce, Ranch dressing, Pico de gallo also called salsa fresca, is a fresh, uncooked salad made from chopped tomato, white onion, and chillis (generally jalape√±os) making it a bit crude or sharp. As for the  Chipotle sauce recipe it can also be called a chipotle salsa because salsa means sauce in Spanish. I think of salsa in the more traditional American way and that is as a salsa cruda  or pico de gallo. One is really spicy and sharper whilst the other is more like a chutney. Ranch dressing is a type of salad dressing made of some combination of buttermilk, salt, garlic, onion, herbs (commonly chives, parsley, and dill), and spices (commonly black pepper, paprika, and ground mustard seed), mixed into a sauce. Sour cream is also frequently used, and some home cooks may substitute yogurt for the sour cream to create a lower-fat version. Long story short, I prefer BBQ (Barbeque sauce) or given the availability prefer the Jack Daniels BBQ sauce.
Wife went in for the Kicked up combo which is a Fajitas marinated chicken steak with grilled onions and Jack cheese in buttery toasted  tortillas ( pronounced Tor ‚Äì tiyas) and the combo at Rs.375/- came with yellow rice with a bowl of black pinto bean curry) and tortillas with chicken fillings served in a bed of house salad, sour cream, pico de gallo and chipotle sauce with mashed potato. Whilst I ordered a grilled tenderloin at Rs.500/- with veggies a the most divine mashed potato with cream over it. I did ask for the steak to be made ‚Äú well done‚Äù and re-emphasised the same to ensure it well cooked over the fire. Note: ensure re-emphasising in the US and Europe cause they not only fail to understand you but do not want to understand ‚Äú Well done‚Äù.
The tenderloin was superb, well done and the mashed potato so well done that it was smooth creamy like paste which just melted in the mouth. The Beef was high quality, chunky, well cooked to perfection. The Quesadillas was a new experience in India with a bit of complication with the Indian palate with the unacquainted Mexican version. The Tortillas were great with excellent generous fillings of chicken and house salad with the sauces and cheese. But the rice and bean curry was horrible. We Indians love our beans (Rajma) well done and easy to chew and digest because we soak it in water for 12 hours before cooking it in a pressure cooker but unfortunately this pinto bean was hard, difficult to chew, curry bland and rice which tasted like sand in the Mexican desert.
The cocktails were an eye opener  as I ordered a Long Island at Rs.300/- a glass ( tall one) and my wife ordered a Pomegranate Margaritas at Rs.395/- per glass. My Long Island hit me as the whiskey in it whilst the Margarita divine, refreshing and a wonderful elixir for the tired soul. My second drink became that. Total bill was Rs.2553/- inclusive of Vat and taxes.
¬†Excellent atmosphere, superb d√©cor with a great ambience of a sports bar.

Chili's has to be my current favourite diner.¬†The quality of the food, the quantity, the service, everything is too good to be unnoticed.The most favourite dish hands down is the Crispy Chicken Chipotle. Its like heaven served in a plate.Chili's can summed up as a food lovers paradise.¬†The quantity deserves a special mention. Going to Chili's makes me wish for the American appetite I lack.
However, the Grilled Steak is a bit of a disappointment. Whenever we ask for medium rare, we end up getting well done.
Of late I've grown a fancy for the margaritas served at Chili's. So often me and my friends go and slurp a goblet of margarita like as if we are from the Royal family.
Overall, this is one place I can never get bored of!

Friendly staff, buzzing atmosphere, ok food is how I would summarise Chili's

The layout with a large bar in one section and seating in another, alongside this one makes it look much larger than what it actually is. 

I was intrigued by the waiter's reluctance to give us a seat on the 'Bar end' of the restaurant though given all were operational at that time.

Not a place I'll say one has to go to but a palatable option if you're in the vicinity and feel like Mexican

Went to Chili's yesterday and tried the Ranch BBQ Burger and the Paper Cheese Loin Steak. I was craving for a burger and it just served my purpose. Highly recommended for Burger and steak lovers. Didn't like the triple dipper starter. Too greasy for my taste.¬†


Went to Chili's last weekend for a late lunch with wife. The staff at the gate were very warm and welcoming so were inside the restaurant. Th decor was great, it reminded me of Nando's in Exeter UK where I used to go a lot. Liked the staff uniform. The bar looked really relaxing. We found a table for two quite easily. The menu itself looked visually very appealing and we ordered the fried Calamari, The Big mouth Bite (four mini burgers with fries) and the Fajita Trio. Also ordered some drink. I have to say I did not expected that it would be too much for two as lunch, the portions where really generous ones, all of them. 
The Calamari---well I have had better. It was over fried so was very rubbery. But the surprise was the burger. I always like medium done steaks and it was a perfect grill and the meat quality was really nice- prefect tender loins for me with perfect dressing, however they could have done better with the buns specially the hill (bottom bun) was a bit soggy in the middle. I wanted to go for the steak initially as I wanted to have a good one for some time now but was sceptical when I saw the price (it was cheap) so went for the burger instead. I can now say that, after having the burger, I am going back to try the steak and they better not disappoint me. The Fajitas were great with great fresh condiments, the chicken was really tender, the prawn really tasted great and the steak was well done (I would prefer a medium though), my wife was especially very happy to see such generous portion of cheeses. Everything had a really nice fresh flavour.
Overall the ambiance was great, food was good so was the service and I had enjoyed my lunch to every bit. 
Only down side if I have to add-- the staff seems to clatter a lot in front of the gate just as one enters when they are not busy.
Price wise there are some items which really surprised me with their price as I expected them to be pricier. So I think it was worth every penny I spent. 
So its highly recommended for food lovers.

I went to Chili's with huge expectations but sadly the food did not live up to the hype.

After hearing a lot about crispers we ordered a honey chipotle chicken crisper. The dish consisted of 5 chicken strips dipped in honey chipotle sauce. It tastes good but nothing great- it was hugely overpriced and something you would fnd at KFC for chrissakes at a much lower price. The chipotle sauce was a saviour, which tasted nice.

Then we had chicken fajitas in chipotle sauce. The chicken had a great soft succulent tecture dipped in cheese but a few bites and it seems pretty flavourless.
 
I also had a strawberry lemonade which was like big babool chewing gum.

All in all a pretty overhyped, overpriced restaurant.

On the plus side, the ambience, the service were awersome.

Chili's is climbing to the top of my favourite list. I just loved the food, ambience, the decor and the fact that it's value for money.

I had heard so much about this place from my friends and acquaintances that I couldn't resist going. I liked the variety on the menu. 

For drinks we got a cherry coke, and the Strawberry lemonade. Both of which were good. The soup of the day was Minestrone Tomato soup which was quite good too.

For entr√©es we got a Triple Dipper- Chicken crispers, Chicken wings and eggrolls, Terlingua Buffalo Chili, Kicked-up Chicken Quesadillas. All of the appetisers were really good, especially the Terlingua Chili. 

Next we got a Crispy Honey-Chipotle Chicken Crispers and a Cilantro Pesto Shrimp Pasta. These were great too...

On the whole the experience was Gastronomically Satisfying and I was quite impressed with the portion sizes as well.
Pocket Pinch: 1300 for 2 people.
Highlights: Shrimp pasta, buffalo chili and honey chipotle chicken.

Must visit. :)

Good old comfort food. In portions, that are almost too much for one.
Infinitely satisfying starting from the Cherry Coke and Strawberry Lemonade that were served in big tumblers to the wholesome Country Fried Chicken, Fish and Chips and Jambalaya.
Fried Fish is the best one I have ever had anywhere and since it happens to be one of my favourites, I've have had it at many a place.
We had ended with their Cheesecake, which simply is out-of-this-world and Brownie Bites.

Gastronomically satisfying food apart, their decor is pretty informal and this it adds to your enjoyment of the food even more.

So get your buddies, bring some appetite and tuck in.

P.S. Burgers and Tacos. Pick any. Not one disappoints.

I have been hearing about Chili's for a very long time and was really excited to go there.There are very few restaurants in Kolkata where you can enjoy a glass of beer along with some tacos,burgers and pizzas.The ambience and the staff is really good but I was disappointed with the food.My friends and I ordered chicken ranch burger (average),pizza (bad) and grilled tenderloin (good).I wanted to try the baby back ribs but unfortunately they couldn't serve.There are a lot of items in the menu and I would surely go back again to try those but I will avoid the burgers.

Tex-mex at its best. Fried  chicken, those toasty quesadillas, generous dips n sauces.... Heavenly. The quantity of food is really awesome... And this is coming from a giant like me...i went there twice... The 2nd time.. I tried the grilled tenderloin steak... It was heavenly... And their signature pork ribs with barbecue sauce is so lovely... The meat actually falls off the ribs while you eat... It's so tender... the "bottomless" coke thing was actually great...Will never get tired of visiting this place...

I was lazing around and kept from reviewing a lot of places , but today I was just like. Let's do it !!! 
So yeah chili's I pretty much always wanted to come here , cus everyone was talking about the cherry coke. 
So one evening I walked in with a bunch of my cousins 
We ordered 
- cherry coke 
- veg Texas fries 
- south western pizza 6" 9" (I guess the pizza was a new add on to the menu ) 
Cherry coke ~ this was actually really really good , absolutely loved it ! 
Veg Texas fries ~ this again was perfectly made and I loved the dipping which came along with it. 
- south western pizza ~ well about this , it was just fine. Not too bad not too good. Just fine. 
The bill came something around 2k which was totally okay ! 
Over all a very good experience and surely coming back !!!

After all the hype and thegood things I heard about this place, I finally decided to visit chili's..
Was very impressed by the ambience and decor and the service inside the restaurant.
The service is quick and nice.
Coming to the food, I wasnt satisfied with the quantity of the food(given the high prices associated with each).
We had the crispy honey chipotle crisper which was well prepared and the smoky chicken fajita.
The fajita was soft and tender but was tasteless...expected more
The strawberry lemonade was a disaster...it tasted like big babol as pointed by my friend..
Had high expections from this place...not sure if I want to visit again

Feeling "blessed"...yes I had my dinner at chili's! Trio fajita.. ie. tenderloin meat + shrimps (large enough) + chicken !! The exact quantity of each..ur tongue nd stomach will mamage to love! Seasoned with pepper, salt and I don't knw what else ! Flesh was juicy..nd soft..nd not at all chewy ! Fajitas served with a combo of four types of salads n tacos! Offffff heaven...that dish was ! Then we..self acclaimed foodie-giants as usual over ordered..with our (going to burst) stomachs..three plates of steaks %) That was again a dish..to which u can again think of making love! U can have two sides with each steak! So for three steaks we ordered SIX sides! Broccoli (2) + seasonal veggies + rice (2) + mashed potato !! Each n every side was mouth watering! But again if u ask me...mashed potato nd rice was best ! Nd u better mention tht the steak shud be medium done..it wll become chewy if it's full done!

It's a cool place,howsoever wannabe it may sound, cool seemed the ideal word to describe this joint in Quest. The brick finish, the view from the side, the trendy bar all add to this feel. 
We ordered 
a) Strawberry Lemonade - Rather perfect. It was served in beer mugs to add to the quirkiness of an already quirky drink. Liked it. 
b) Triple Dippers - Had 3 different appetizers. The chicken wings were different from the ones we usually have. This had a tangy sauce coating the wings. The crispy chicken was plain ordinary. Too much oily, almost seemed like the 'televaja' or 'begni' with a chicken filling instead. However the best of the trio was the southwestern egg rolls. Tortillas filled with cheese, chicken, corn and some other stuff I didn't recognize, the concoction was perfect. 
c) Fajita Quesadilllas - It was decent. The rice, black beans served complimentary were pretty okay-ish too. Standard stuff. 
d) Chocolate Chip Paradise Pie - We had ordered something else, but the person serving convinced us to take this. The plating, I must say was brilliant. Taste wise it was quite good too, though some may find it on the sweeter side. 

We could not complete some of our food(not really a surprise if you know us well :P) . However the staff readily packed it for us. Except for the price pinch and one bland dish, an ideal place to hang out with friends.

I had heard of this place in the context of Mexican food, but I have to add, they serve fantastic pastas too. If you are a vegetarian, this isn't the spot for a meal. The choice is very limited. I like the classic nachos, they are like mini thin-crust pizza slices. The quesadillas, tacos and fajitas are out of the world. Haven't yet tried the steak and the calamari, but I am sure they are great too.

Heard from my friend that this particular restaurant serves authentic Mexican and Italian cuisine. Been there yesterday with my family. We started with triple dipper as an appetiser. That was too good. Specially my father liked it, who is very sensitive about foods. Being a pasta lover, my brother and I ordered chipotle pesto chicken pasta and shrimp pasta. Crispy chipotle chicken and country fried chicken for Mexican cuisine. Quality of food was very good and well served, but I had to ask four times for a spoon. That was not expected from a food joint like Chili's. So overall service was not up to the mark. Food was very good.

Being from the southern parts of the city, mostly shop, eat & watch movies at south city mall. This sunday, we decided to change that and made sunday plans for lunch followed by a bolly flick, at quest mall.

chili's was the immediate choice from my end, as I have always enjoyed their fnb experience, and it being next door to the cinemas was an added bonus. My first time to chili's kolkata was a pleasure, as anticipated.

We reached on a sunday afternoon, around 2 pm. A wait of 20 minutes and we were ushered to a table at one end of the eatery, which flaunted a beautiful view of the city. It was an overcast gloomy day, or else would have got some good shots of the howrah bridge, which was somewhat visible from our table. 

Coming to the food :

- To start off, we ordered the triple dipper with bottomless glasses of areated drinks ( i simply love this part - my trainer doesn't ) 

The three appetisers came with carrots & 3 dips. A meal in itself. I personally love the eggrolls. 

- The main course was thereafter chosen, wanting a steak I decided on the grilled tenderloin steak. The steak comes with 2 sides, which one can choose from an array of about 8-10. I, Initially chose the veggies and mashed potatoes in gravy. But after a few minutes had a change in mind & instructed another nearby ordertaker to replace the veggies with fries. A goof up somewhere & the steak came with the veggies. Once pointed out, they quickly had a complimentary portion of fries brought to the table. Im glad they did, for the veggies were undercooked, needed to be boiled n sauteed a bit more.

The steak was ok, slightly overdone/burnt at some spots, which didn't go down well, as I like my meat medium.

- She opted for the classic chicken fajita, which is by far one of their best - I tasted a mouthful as well, delicious. A very generous portion, she couldnt finish even half of it. Takeaway.

- Molten chocolate cake - no matter how full you are, must try this at the end. I make sure I leave that little bit of space for this delightful sweet ending. The hot cake goes down so well with the icecream. Love it!

Service - very prompt & friendly. 

Decor - warm & inviting. comes from the extensive use of wood.
             if you have a choice  - opt for the tables to the right of the restaurant, next to the glasspanes, overlooking the city.


Pocket pinch - 2k without liquor

Verdict - great. will come back for more.

I went there for a quick dinner. They were full on the Saturday evening but we got a place pretty soon. The food is good and the ambience is pretty upbeat.

Again being located in the mall makes it easy to locate. One can go with friends to have a good time. Try the burgers and the choco drinks. Will visit again.

Been on my wishlist for quite a while. Finally ended up going there. There were five of us and Sunday meant we had to wait for quite sometime. Maybe it was just me, but I sincerely felt that the ambience had a real out-of-India feel to it. Anyway, down to the food. Started of with the safest choice: A chocolate shake. It was sinful. Onto the starters, we ordered a Triple Dipper and a plate of BBQ Chicken Salad. Both of them were decent enough. Now the main course. All five of us ordered different dishes. I'll review them one by one.
Grilled Tenderloin: This was a MEGA dish. A generous cut of medium-rare tenderloin served with garlic bread and buttered corn-on-the cob and mash. Now, for people like us who are not used to eating proper steaks, it becomes really boring after a while. The food tasted great, but after a while, just as the steak starts to cool off a little, the meat gets tougher. And there comes a point of time when eating it becomes cumbersome. But, by no way is this Chili's fault.
Fish & Chips: You really can't go wrong with this preparation. But special mention for the fillet. I think it might have been Basa rather than the usual Bhetki but whatever it was, it was simply melt-in-the-mouth stuff.
Blackened Salmon: Again, salmon isn't the typical fish that Bengalis would like. It's gotten a particular odor/aftertaste (much like a hilsa) which, some people might just not like. Otherwise, the preparation was top notch.I personally felt that the sweet-tangy sauce was a super addition and made it even more awesome.
Fajita Trio: This is a choice I made which, I will always be proud of. Buffalo, prawn, chicken; you always get to change the taste as per your liking. This was the first time I had a fajita, and I loved the do-it-yourself style. It had a multitude of tastes and you can tweak little things here and there to explore all of them. A must try for people going there.
Mushroom Jack Fajitas: Like the trio, the person who had it gave very favourable reviews. The only dish I didn't taste because I don't quite like mushrooms.
I almost forgot to mention the Molten Chocolate Cake. A lava cake with ice cream and dollops of chocolate sauce. Need I say more?
The food is pricey. But the portions and the taste more than make up for it. The total bill came to 5K but it was a well spent one.

After all these long reviews posted here let me keep it short.... "The BEST American food you can have",price is reasonable if you compare it with the size and the way it fills and better then any Mc D burger or some other in fastfood joints.A burger is enough for filling out the stomach.The wings are awesome and the best you can have.
Staffs are warm and they do cater to your needs.An a great ambiance is an add-on.
A great place for meets with friends

It has become one of my favourites!! 
The Strawberry lemonade and Cherry cola is very good so is the Mango margarita.
Triple dipper did not meet my expectations. The blackened  salmon didnt taste good to me.
What really made up for those are the classic nachos with fajita chicken, smoky chitpole chicken fajitas, grilled tenderloin and country fried chicken!
The cheese cake is simply yum!!! 
The molten chocolate cake is also great.
Overall its worth visiting!! :)

Heard a lot, ogled over the sumptuous photos, put it on my wishlist - you know the diagnosis. 
Today we just made it a point to check the new place out. Thankfully, it being a Tuesday, no queues. In fact, we stepped into the semi-filled restro, nevertheless all customers seemed completely happy and enjoying. Wooden tables, a view from the 5th floor at the rushing taxis down in the road, cozy dimmed light. Courteous, non-obsessing and smiling waiters. Bar available. I like this place, man!
The choice was Fajita Trio and Veg n Cheese Quesadillas with some beers to wash it down.
I asked for the drinks to be served first, the answer came "Of course drinks come first, ma'am!!" Not everywhere in Cal, young man, not everywhere. Frozen mugs, chilled beer. Cheers! Kolkata is winking at us with traffic lights and stars..
The food comes in an impressive way - a huge black tray and a foldable stand for it. It's sizzling (music for my ears). And it's like - a lot!! 
The quesadillas are a nice line of triangles with accompaniments (check out in the pics section), taste good although a bit bland for me. Fajitas have seasoned prawns (juicy and nice), steak strips (okay) and seasoned chicken strips (better than steak). Plus a plate with guacamole, cheese, salsa and cream cheese. Help yourself.
To be very frank, I have had much better meals from food trucks and immigrants districts  in US. But this is one is a really good restaurant, the kind Kolkata still has a huge need for. It's neat, clean, appealing, non-cluttered, with a good consecutive menu (I seriously don't get places which mix Thai with Italian), music and awesomely clean bathrooms (I have an obsession point on these). A BIG PLUS for me - waiting staff. No attitude, easy going, smiling, just doing what they are supposed to do - making your meal enjoyable, unlike some patriarchs in greasy pants in our "legendary" restaurants in Park Street, who give you an attitude of Queen Elizabeth. Anyway. We finished our meal at our own pace, enjoyed and ate it the way we wanted to, and no one looked suggestively at the watch :) The quantity was quite enough, as for me. Did not try any desserts. The bill for the above mentioned order was abt Rs 1600.
I would say, I wont stand in the queue to have a meal here, but it's a super place to have a dinner with friends or even your significant one. Something different from kababs and chowmeins, democratic atmosphere, clean, user friendly. Maybe after I try their burgers and steak, I'll have my head blown off and write an ode to Chili's, which is already  sizzling hot in the Kolkata food scene.

Chili's have climbed my favorite list very quickly owing to their excellent menu, service, ambiance and pocket-pinch. A visit to Chili's with parents saw an order of the mixed platter for starters -- The Triple Dipper , Crispy Honey Chipotle Chicken Crispers and Fajita Trio for main course with Cold Drinks!! An order for each of these was more than enough to fill our tummy. The Pocket Pinch was Rs. 1800+ for 4 people. A must visit for every age and anytime. Will visit soon again to try out their other menu!
And Chili's of Kolkata has a better vibe than Chili's of Bangalore! Kolkata foodies rock!!

The fries were good, the nachos were good, the onion rings were good. You'd be happy with that if you were just going to a restaurant for the sides of your main meal. We ordered the fajitas, the pizza, the chipotle steak and the sliders. Meat - medium rare. Well, the meat tasted like it had been picked out straight from your average buffalo cemetery. The smell in the "buff" meat, not beef so bad we could barely even eat it. The pizza was dry and papery. All in all a terrible experience. 

Drinks are good and happy hours are the only reason I would probably come back for. 
Oh, service sucks too!

I was craving Mexican food for quite a while when my husband found out about Chillies from Zomato on a Saturday evening. It was an impromptu decision to try the place out soon after. We initially went there for a light Mexican snack, just to get the hang of the place. On entering, we immediately changed our minds and decided to have dinner instead. This was prompted by the look of the place and the authentic aroma of south American food. I have to admit that the Margarita glasses on the bar table played a role as well. As for dinner, since everything on the menu looked so tempting, we had a tough time choosing. We decided to start with the drinks and appetizers and then move on to the main course. However, being absolutely honest here, the food and the Margarita was so good and in such generous portions that we couldn't go for the main course. This place is truly good in terms of food quality as well as portions. Best part is, the whole experience is easy on the pocket, and you get value for money. We had a plate of triple dippers (too good) and classic chicken Nachos, with a Margarita and two pints of beer and it cost us Rs. 1400 plus taxes. Everything about this dinner, including the ambience and the music, made us feel great. The only regret is that we were so full that we couldn't eat more. So my husband now wants to go back to Chillies for his Birthday once again and I am ready to go again and again to try ALL of their cuisines. So if you are a Mexican/Italian food lover, don't think twice, Chillies is your place!

For Chili's, it just WOW! Some really good food in a really long time. I love the decor, I love the in house music, the ambience and oh yes the food. Its THE place for delicious finger licking food. This place might feel a little heavy on the pocket but its totally worth it. My personal favourite is the country fried chicken and the classic tenderloin burger. From appetizers to desserts the food is spot on. If you're planning to go to chili's, don't think twice. This place celebrates good food.

The menu took me by surprise. Chilli‚Äôs has a variety of dishes to offer and it kept surprising me with every platter I have had. When having a full course meal, starting with TRIPLE DIPPER, BLACKENED FISH and finishing with the CHEESE CAKE, all I was thinking about visiting this place again to indulge into another sumptuous trip. I wanted more but my stomach disagreed.
A very pleasing decor and amiable ambiance. Try to visit early to avoid queue.
But lastly, I want to draw your attention on one thing that may have gone wrong, their mocktails are a bit too sweet.

My first visit to the place- I quite liked the bustling, frenzied, slightly chaotic atmosphere surrounding the place which was a result of the place being full to capacity with stewards hurriedly running up and down to take orders and deliver existing once. The place was interestingly done.

Coming to the business end of the deal- ordered Bottomless Tostada Chips, Veg Jalapeno Burger, Veg Bombay Burger, Strawberry Shake and a Cold Coffee. The salsa dip served with chips was spot on. Personally I feel it is quite easy to either under-do or over spice the salsa dip, but Chilli's got it absolutely on the mark - tangy & tantalizing. I liked the presentation of the burgers served along with a generous portion of french fries. Both the burgers had nothing that we could complain about. I found my strawberry shake to be a tad too sugary for my liking. The cold coffee had a stronger than expected coffee flavour to it. 

On a different note, I found my eyes searching for the stewards on more than one occasion for the order, water, my bill, etc and that leaves me with a feeling that once full, the place might struggle to optimally serve all the tables.

Chili's is situated in the Quest Mall and is an amazing find.  I visited this restaurant two nights in a row this week (both weekdays) and experienced difficulty in walking out of the restaurant on both occasions. :P Firstly, if you're going on a weekend, do make a reservation in advance. 

We had the Texas Cheese Poppers, the Spinach Queso and the Classic Nachos as appetizers. While the Cheese Poppers were ordinary, the rest of the dishes more than made up for it. The Spinach Queso was brilliant (read: Cheesy) and the Toastada Chips served along with the Dip were crisp and I could go on munching on them forever. Finally, the Nachos were great too- very cheesy, baked perfectly, and accompanied with raw tomato salsa, sour cream and guacamole. A special mention to the Guacamole, which was AMAZING. It perfectly complemented the nachos. This was accompanied by a Peach Iced tea and a Peach Martini. The iced tea was average, but the Martini (recommended by the server) was perfect- it was peachy and it hit you. :D

Coming to the main course, we had the Chipotle Southwestern Vegetarian Pasta, the Vegetarian Fajitas and the Veggie and Cheese Quesadillas. The Pasta was creamy in texture and yet it did not feel very heavy. The Fajitas  (which you're supposed to make yourself) were superb, accompanied with salsa, sour cream, beans, rice, guacamole and a number of other condiments. They serve three soft Tortillas, and though it may seem small, you realize how heavy the portions are once you eat them. We also had the Margherita flatbread pizza with add-on mushrooms. It was crisp and yet melted in the mouth with ease. :) 

My friends tried the Triple Dipper (which according to them, was OKAY), but the Oldtimer (A massive burger with a tenderloin patty accompanied with a generous serving of fries) , the Blackened Salmon, the Grilled Tenderloin Steak, and the Baby Back Ribs (with Honey Chipotle Sauce) were highly appreciated. 

Finally, moving on to the desserts, we had a number of servings of the Molten Chocolate Cake and the Chocolate Chip Paradise Pie, and since I was very full at that time, I had gotten a Cheesecake packed for myself to devour later. The texture of the cheesecake was nothing short of brilliant! One of the best I've had. 

The ambience at Chili's (on weekdays) is relaxed and you can sit there for hours, enjoying every morsel. The servers are polite and were patient with us on both occasions, when we occupied their restaurant till 12 midnight. The bill came out to be around 10k for 10 of us, which makes the place slightly over-priced, but then, for the quality of service, the serving portions and the immense satisfaction, it is worth it! 

So, the ratings for Chili's would be as follows:

AMBIENCE: 4/5
FOOD:4.5/5
SERVICE: 5/5
VALUE FOR MONEY: 4/5

Chili's is one of the best places to grab an all American meal in Calcutta. The tenderloin steak is beautiful, served with a generous helping of home fries and corn on a cob ( you can choose from other sides as well). Also, the quesadillas are highly recommended. 

A beer or an LIIT goes perfectly to wash down that steak or ribs portion that you've just gobbled down. For dessert, try the molten chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream.

The decor, ambience and service is par excellence.

Slightly on the expensive side, especially by Calcutta food outlet standards, be prepared to shell out atleast 1k per person for a full meal.

Chili's is a nice addition to the gastronomic repertoire of Kolkata. Almost always teeming with an impatient crowd waiting in the queue, this deceptively small place is a meat lover's treasure trove. From tenderloin to lamb rib, the quality of cooked meat is imperial. However, I was not impressed with the Salmon they serve here. Waiters are a bit phony with their apologies, which sometimes can be pretty vexing. Taking an hour to bring you drinking water is unconscionable, and trying to make it up with a grin and a fake accent doesn't help it. Nevertheless, one won't mind the occasional discords as long as the succulent, toothsome and inviting flesh on the table is waiting to be ripped apart.

Being the nth person to write a review of CHILIS I would rather keep it simple ‚Ä¶ if you love all that is meaty and more then this IS your place . I have been there a couple of times and I am just in awe of their food, service and staff. If you love yourself you just cannot deprive your taste buds of that FAJITA TRIO , BABY BACK RIBS or TENDERLOIN STEAKS  . I must mention that the portions are real good and the mocktails come in this huge beer mugs which I find quite difficult to finish off ! Weekends are real rush so plan your visit in advance and gorge !

I have been traveling to different places and exploring famous food chains. My friend took me to this place for lunch on hot and humid day where i was looking have some drinks to get refresh and something to eat which my bad stomach can sustain. The menu was self explanatory with the pictures of the dishes matching with the actual dish served. I got a pint of beer served in chilled glass enhancing the taste of the beer. I love the choice me and friend made for food and had BBq salad, Seabass n chicken. Perfectly mouth watering, nice quality of cheese used. After long time i had something good like this in India.

Finally chili's come to kolkata. I have been to their delhi outlet and instantly fell in love with their food. I am a big lover of american salads and this place serves the best in Kolkata so far.

I have been trying to hit this place for sometime now but their queues are usually sooo long that i just dint have the patience to wait. Luckily this time i dint have to wait for long for a table. Went here for lunch with a friend and hogged like we were starving for ages. Everything served was cooked perfectly.Their bar-b-q salad, blackened fish (sea bass) and classic nachos with cheese, the thought of it makes my tummy growl and mouth drool. Till date i felt Taj served the best sea bass but now chili's have made me change my opinion. 

Apart from their elaborate american mouth watering menu, their service too is very friendly and accommodating. The ambiance is perfect for friends, family and couples. Considering the brand name and food quality and humongous quantity, prices are perfect.

I just cant wait to visit the place again.

Today afternoon me and my friend went for lunch in chili‚Äôs in quest mall. Heard a lot about this place. As we entered I must say the ambience was good..u will love it.a good place to visit. They were playing English songs‚Ä¶1 of which was one of my fav. 
didnt know it had an liquor section.i was xcited as I love liquors.:P.first we ordered tequila shots.name was patron.it was coffee falvoured.awesome I must say.coming to the food part.we ordered triple dipper,blackened salmon,orleans jambalaya and mango margarita. i must say  one thing.we were not given water.i mean its basic manners to serve water.i asked for water.still didn‚Äôt get.asked for second time .then we got water.maybe they forgot. the triple dippers were superb with three sauce dips.it was awesome.while we were having the triple drippers  they gave us the other two dishes  also before we finished the triple drippers. blackened salmon was very good.salmon tasted very good.baked salmon.very good taste.the jumbalaya was also good but the  blackened salmon was bettr. i think the jambalaya had a bit more gravy kinda thing and ad more tastes than it shud have.but lyked it too.the mango margarita was superb for a non-alcoholic drink.can try this for non-alcoholics.
I really wanted to try baby back ribs and grilled tenderloin as these are the best here.it was so unfortunate as I couldn‚Äôt have those as my friend was uncomfortable with pork and buffalo meat.i  would definitely go later to have these.dese two , especially baby back ribs is a definite try  here.
Food quality was very good.taste was also good.the waiter was  very helpful.all these costed me a total of Rs.3165/-.i was a bit shocked to see that the tax almost  amounted to Rs 800/-.i think a bit more for your pocket because the food items are slightly costly and the prices r given without taxes.
Overall a very good visit .wl definitely visit again for the baby ribs.a kool place to hang out.overall liked it very much.

We've been thinking of visiting this place for a while now, so finally visited it yesterday. The ambiance is great, the staff was courteous and attentive. However, the food we felt was, at best mediocre. My husband ordered for a buffalo chili and a fajita trio and I opted for the non veg soup of the day an Orleans Jambalaya. The soup and the chili were really good, albeit a bit less quantity wise. However, the main course was pretty average. Mine had chicken and prawns om a bed of rice. Well, prawns and the chicken were well cooked but the flavor didnt leave me asking for more! The rice on the other hand was bad, felt like an amalgamation of spices, not very appealing to the taste buds. My husband too commented that food was average but that apparently was the typical Chili's fare, according to him since he has visited the chain before. 
Anyway, the quantity of the main courses were pretty generous but taste wise, I'd say it was blah!

I had heard a lot about this place and last Sunday I convinced my friends to try it out.It was really spacious with a separate restaurant and Bar section.The decor and ambiance were just too good and had the whole New York feel to it.It was very crowded which is understandable being it on a Sunday.It seemed like a perfect place to sit on the Bar top,enjoy a drink or some grabs.But we were there for proper lunch this time,so after some wait we finally got a table.The restaurant staff were trying their best to be pleasant and helpful.We were a little confused about the quantity and how much we should order and they suggested each of us .should go for separate dishes which later turned out to be a Big mistake since the quantity of the dishes were huge which turned out to be the only good thing about the food .And we had tried to cancel a dish within two minutes of placing the order but they refused saying it was already under process.However they offered to pack it if we wanted later on.

The things we ordered :

1. Country Fried  Calamari - It was a big disappointment. The squids came plain fried,tasted very dry and the flavors were missing.Only when dipped in the accompanied Dips that we could manage to eat it.Even though I must mentions the Dips weren't too great on the taste either.

2.Chipotle Pesto Chicken Pasta  - Firstly it didn't match the photo given in their Menu chart.Secondly,this is exactly the kind of Pasta that is available in all the coffee shops around the town that too for one-third the price charged here. We had ordered it with red sauce and I swear it tasted as if the dish has an overdose of Maggi Masala in it.The smoked chicken that was on top of the pasta was drab too but I love chicken and meat too much to waste it.However half of the Pasta and the toast we left untouched.It was unbearable to eat.

3.Kicked Up Quesadillas with Chicken - Ungenerous filling of coleslaw and chicken in paper-thin corn starch wraps when dipped in sour cream were still okay to eat.We like coleslaw,we like sour cream,we like chicken..but let's face it,we can probably get coleslaw and cream sandwiches elsewhere for 80 bucks.There is not point for throwing almost Rs.400 for such dishes.This dish also came accompanied with the same Dip that was served with the Calamari,vinegar tossed cabbage and salsa,a spoonful of each made us want to throw up and one of my friend was so agitated she refused to eat any farther.( She later had chicken rolls from outside and vehemently promised to never visit this place again)

4.Cherry Colas -  Coke mixed with Cherry syrup.Need I say more?

The Bill came around Rs.1900.

My Verdict - I really didn't understand what the hoopla is about this place.Maybe it is because of the ambiance and decor which I agree is superb and very classy indeed.But I have to stop right there as the food was unappetizing and a complete horror.The dishes I tried didn't taste like authentic  Mexican food and all of which were very very bland and overpriced. If you want I can suggest you lots of coffee shops where you can find similar dishes and tastes similar or much better.I don't find myself going back but if you do,avoid the food that we ordered and "May the odds be ever in your favor" !!

Good ambience and good food. I ordered the Smoky Chipotle Chicken Fajitas and Kicked-up Quesadilla Chicken. The portions served are more than generous, and if you don't eat much in general you might find it difficult to finish! On the positive note it is excellent value for money, both in quality and quantity. Service is good and prompt. They have also opened their alcohol menu, so you have that as an option as well. Overall, good place, and I liked the food. If you eat less, better to order one dish and share, and order more if need be. The 2 dishes I ordered totalled to Rs 775 and then they added taxes and 10% service charge and the final bill was Rs 1018. Expect about 30% more in the bill on the actual price of food in the menu.

After long and tiring shopping session I stepped into chilli's, on my wife's suggestion. I chose a corner couch and started going through the long menu...finally ordered for a veg pasta and a non alcoholic mango margarita... The service was very quick and prompt ... The very first sip of margarita was so tantalisingly refreshing, that I wanted to have more and more of it.... Then arrived the pasta .... Mmmm the invigorating aroma .... The served quantity was huge .... By no means could I have eaten all of it .... The staff members were courteous n polite .... However the music was lil too loud .... All in all a fab food experience at the chilli 's ! And a must visit suggestion for all .... ????

The only American Fast Food joint has really made its name in Kolkata with its lip smacking food and charming service. The dishes itself look to come into life right from the menu cards and when you are sitting in one of the cozy seats having your eyes glued to the giant screens waiting for the food to arrive at your table , all you have to do is keep yourself calm as the culinary from other tables might create a strange greed inside your heart. So save your appetite and enjoy the food , cause the price you pay for wont disappoint you.

Ive been to the pune branch and the kolkata branch. Both the places will make you go gaga over the food. The ambience is sooo mexican-ish and the food is just super awesome. The salad the fries the chicken stake the mashed potatoes the list of good food is endless and trust me none of the food item will make you sad. Every bite of all the food available will give you food orgasm. The place is not too harsh on your pocket too. Be it  breakfast brunch lunch dinner they have food which will suit any time of the day. The food will make your diet plans crash effortlessly. Awesomeness is the word for this place. Btw if its your bday then chili's special bday song is what you should ask for.

My first time at Chili"s was on a lovely monsoon afternoon and the view form where we were seated was beautiful! The ambience is lovely and i knew the food would surpass my expectations! My friend and i ordered for a beer and went ahead to order the main course. I went for  a steak and my friend with a classic burger! the food looked delicious and i was really looking forward to it only to know that my bubble was going to pop!  The food arrived..and not served infornt of me but just kept on the side of the table..were we to help ourselves?? the portion could'nt get sadder..the steak looked like a chicken breast..dry and so unappetizing!! Clearly they have no idea about food presentation..kfc does better! the sauce looked like it was standing for too long since a thin skin had formed on top..the garlic bread which was supposed to come with the steak had to be reminded of..they had clearly forgotten! the burger patty was supposed to be well done..but it was'nt! after consuming the meat there is a disgusting aftertaste that follow..the patty was'nt seasoned either! Apart from all this the staff,location and the corn that came with the steak was great! :P

I went to this famous food joint within one month of its opening. It was a treat by my uncle who is an NRI residing in Canada. Obviously they had been to chilis before over there. Much to my surprise, he pointed out to me that the menu is exactly the same. Isn't it amazing?
Having been there twice so far the dishes which really grabbed my attention are-

Appetizers: TRIPLE DIPPER,COUNTRY FRIED CALAMARI.TERLINGUA BUFFALO CHILLI(i don't like chilli-s though),this is their signature dish..

Southwest Grill(Quesadillas,Tacos)- FAJITA QUESADILLA...loved it

Chicken and Sea Food: BLACKENED SALMON,ORLEANS JAMBALAYA(prawns were delicious)

Fire-Grilled Steaks-GRILLED TENDERLOIN: you can choose the two sides you want to have with it. We had sweet corn and mashed potatoes with gravy. Look no further. These two sides were brilliant.

Desserts-CHOCOLATE CHIP PARADISE PIE-the hot chewy bar at the bottom and the ice cream with hot chocolate sauce on top blended perfectly...had it last time that i went there with there with my friends. We shared one and we were literally gulping each bite down to have the biggest share of this amazing dessert.
BROWNIE SUNDAY-my all time favourite dessert. It tastes amazing even if you have it at home. It was obviously great as well...

Chili's certainly lived upto its name and reputation worldwide and its a must-go for all the foodies of this city...Loved the ambience,it has got the USA- feel to it..oh and i almost forgot to mention.. You can have a large glass of any soft drink you want to have for 100 bucks. The best part,if you can manage to finish it you can get a refill and they won't charge you extra for that..beat that!!!
Be there and let your mouth and tummy fo the talking...

When this place first opened and checked its offering, the Buffalo Chilli struck me the most. Sweet memories of Beef Chilli from Leopold Cafe came fleeting and I knew I had to be there and soon.

Luckily my partner in crime, Aankita was in town. The plan was to go on that very day. Post office I rushed.

The staff was very friendly. They behaved as if i was an old patron of the place. I felt extremely comfortable being advised by the staff on what all to try.

The Buffalo Chilli was definitely ordered and it did satisfy me well. The waiter advised a Triple Dipper and I thank him even now for that. But it wasn't all that I was gonna have, after all I have came to this place urgently, there had to be some extra incentive for the effort. So followed a Grilled Tenderloin, it was done to perfection for our taste buds and the gravy to go with it was exotic. And everything was washed down with their quirky mocktails, that what I liked the most about this place, concept-wise.

After a long day at work yesterday, went to Chili's for dinner with a friend. My friend is leaving the city on Friday so it was a "goodbye & good luck" treat to him so it was suppose to be special & memorable. Firstly I would mention that the service was very good, smiling staff & football fever on the TV screen... Good combo :) . We ordered for a Chicken Fajita, Big Mouth Bites & Lemon Ice Tea (peach & lemon), which was a lot of food & as expected we couldn't eat the whole thing. The food was DELICIOUS. But, a person needs to starve for the entire day & then go & eat there :). Another good news: Though we didn't drink but the much- awaited bar has opened. Overall very good experience. Memorable, of course with all the pictures I have clicked disturbing the staff. Another visit is a must.

We went to chili's for a lazy Sunday lunch..have to admit it is one of the coolest place in Kolkata..the ambience is perfect for get together with friends. 
Good news for people who were missing the bar there...they have opened it! 
We ordered a chicken wing for starter and it was pretty good. The winglets tossed perfectly in the tangy wing sauce.
Special mention for the drinks and the glasses it were served..pretty impressed with both. Try the margaritas or iced tea if you do not drink alcohol.
Ordered steaks with brocolli and mashed potatoes  for the main, was bit disappointed. Was expecting the steaks to be little more juicy and soft and a hint of olive oil dressing over the boiled brocolli would have made it great.
However, loved this place and will be visiting again to try other stuff :)

I have been planning to visit chili's for a long..but yesterday was my lucky day.
The tex-mex cuisine restaurant who are serving their delicacy for more than 40years in US are now in kolkata.The restaurant is situated at the 4th floor of Quest mall and provides nice view if you are allocated seats along the glass wall.
The ambience greatly matches the tex mex cuisine style.. Multiple television all over the place.. The place is full of life conversation, laughter and good music.
The staff are very friendly and prompt.. Greeted me when i entered,I don't remember the last time i was served so well..theirs always a big smile on the face of chili's guys and bent to squat to take the order.
We ordered triple dipper and the famous baby pork ribs.
Though i didn't like the Chicken wings in the triple dipper apart from that it was great..Aaaahhhhh nothing to write about the Baby Pork ribs with BBQ sauce just one word outstanding but still its not enough to describe the soft juicy baby ribs in chili's,
Just out of this world.
You won't find any other place rather than chili's.
Soon I'll be visiting there again for their steaks..till then it was an awesome experience.

Date - 05.07. 14

The second visit to this American chain restaurants even pleased me more than my earlier visit.
Yesterday me and my friends visited chili's for celebrating my bestieeezz birthday.
I was blown away by their gestures.. When we told the manager that we're here for birthday celebration.. Instantly they gave us the seat..and brought the brownie with candle on it... Even i love the way all the chili's guys gathered and sing a birthday song together.. Watching everybody sing in a chorus was amazing.Even they gave us discount for the birthday.
Coming to the food.. I'm already a fan of chili's tex-mex cuisine.. As i reviewed earlier.
But yesterday we were not that hungry.. So decided just to order something in light.. Texas cheese popper were delicious..The creamy cheese filling inside was something to die for.. And nachos were crunchy and the same time juicy because of their cheese spread.For mocktails we ordered fusion and lime cosmopolitan.. It was just perfect..Proper blend of lime and other juices.
Its a delight to have their food..

All in all it was a wonderful experience.. Surely visit again soon.
Keep up the good job chili's.

Chilli's at quest Mall ,the ambiance is great matches the Tex max cuisines style same as in USA  and the boys are quite good at reception. Asked about a suggestions and ordered chicken crisper and Chicken fajitas ,portion are really value for money. They have  bar which is just like new born baby limited choices ,My wife ordered a cosmopolitan but not up to the mark served with a lime twist instead lemon, whereas  I grabbed a domestic beer.
Service was prompt enough ,evening was not that busy,surprisingly no feedback taken by the wait staff about the food and drink.We got privacy instead. Hope to visit again.

Went to this place for lunch today after a long planning and hearing a lot about this place. Had an AMAZING experience.

We went to find it fully occupied as didn't had any prior reservations. However they were quick to offer us a table within 15 mins. During the waiting time, they requested us to go through the menu and become familiar with the dishes. We already had browsed the menu on Zomato but were happy to find they have a supplementary menu for Pizzas too which they have newly introduced. The menu booklet is like a Brocheure itself rather than a menu.

They offered us a Window side table with probably the best view overlooking the street below and the view was amazing. The ambience felt awesome with the interiors warmly done and welcoming. The place carries a relaxed feel with energizing color combinations and sure to up your gastronomic desire.

The servers were jolly, smart and well-groomed. They add up a zing to the place.

Food here is of truly International standard (read Mexican/American) and simply awesome. We ordered Beef Tenderloin Steak and Cajun Chicken Burger along with a Mango Margarita and Strawberry Lemonade. The drinks were served first in large Pitcher like glasses which were so large that they continued throughout the meal. Food was served within 10 minutes. Beef Tenderloin Steak was served with two sides, we ordered Seasonal Veggies (sauted Brocoli, Tomatoes & Beans) and Fries. The Steak had a large dollop of butter on top and a sauce. Chicken Cajun Burger had a large piece of chicken breast grilled to perfection, but was a little disappointed to find only sauted cabbage and cheese as they claim it includes other veggies too. But the food tasted really good. The Tenderloin Steak was griiled with all the juices locked inside and was enormous for one person. The seasonal veggies tasted a littel bland, the fries were perfectly done and tasted fresh. The Strwaberry Lemonade was refreshing, but the Mango Margharita was surely a winner. It's probably the best Margarita I had ever.

We spent well over 1.5 hours eating slowly through out our lunch.

Talking of the price, it is definitely on the higher side. We had a bill of around Rs 1500 for 2 people. But the place is surely a to-go to try out the experince. Am surely looking to visit the place again.

Chili's is a great place to be since the ambience is great.The resturant overlooks the main road & the view is great at night.We ordered Country fried chicken & Blackend fish.The chicken was great but the fish disappointed us.It was falt & tasteless.Even the seasoning did nothing great.The rice which was served with it was average to taste.

Overall the experinece was good but the staff seemed to be in a rush...in terms that they wanted us to order fast & finish fast so that the table could be occupied by other guests.It is very strange since we have never come across this kind of an attitude ever.

We do understand the weekend rush but this kind of an attitude was uncalled for.

CHILI'S located adjoining the Food Court of Quest mall has been given a fresh and interesting look unlike most of the restaurants in the city. The place has a lot of Mexican, American, Italian options available for both veg and non veg food lovers. The place had just started serving alcohol the day i went there to grab a quick bite and experience the place. Along with a bottle of domestic beer i had veg tacos. The tacos were crunchy, nicely lined up with mushrooms and others veggies. The white sauce which they gave with the dish was very different  and a delight for the taste buds. The staff was very cooperative and friendly and this made the whole visit worth it. When i come back will defiantly try the burgers and pastas.

bb chckn wings were too salty.. when asked for reason.. they turned it to our choice of sauce..not convincing though.. bbq chckn salad was ok.. we liked the buffalo tenderloin in medium rare.. salmon fish n chips were too good..red pepper chicken was good also.. baby back ribs were precooked, full rack is not that much long which goes towards higher price, this item we consider.. strawberry shake was good but only synthetic version available.. cheese cake and browny were good.. I recommend this place..

Finally to the Chili's... was looking for an excuse to visit Kolkata's new fab, got a chance at last.
Satisfied greatly with their triple dipper, grilled tenderlion, fajita trio and strawberry lemonade. The ambiance, hospitality and service was very good.
 A 2nd visit coming soon.... :D

I went to Chilli's with my friends a couple of days back.It was a wonder experience.The ambiance and decor was awesome .Simple you will feel that you are sitting in a countryside restaurant in UK.The service was also very good.

Coming to the food,we have ordered the below dishes
grilled tenderloin
fajita trio
smoky chipotle chicken fajitas
grilled chicken platter
roaster red pepper chicken

All of them was delicious.Both beef and chicken were beautifully cooked.They also had a policy of serving unlimited soft drinks which was great.You only need to pay once for soft drink and they will server unlimited times.

I would definitely recommend you for a definite visit.

This place is at the newly built Quest Mall in Ballygunge...The decor was really great....A couple of screens lined up with different channels on, nice view of outside and an authentic look....The food was really awesome but a bit expensive though....

I had Crispy Chicken Tacos and Baby Back Ribs with fries.....Both of those were delicious, but the quantity was less....It also serves a refilling soft drink service if you order it...we had cherry cola and normal cola.....Also the staff there was helpful too...The bill was around 1600 bucks for two....
Judging from the taste of the food its a must visit place...

Just sitting down to write a review makes my stomach rumble....yeah...dats how great this resto is....one of its kind in kolkata,this diner opened its doors quite recently but has alrdy becum a vry popular foodie's haven...i turnd up on a weekday and was lucky to get a seat... the 'wild west cum sports bar' decor, replete with posters and large screen lcds--charmed the inner cowgirl in me...the bar is yet to open,but looks snazzy...
we ordrd their signature strawberry lemonade and cherry cola..both were v tasty and a welcum change from the usual fare...i absolutely adored the huge tumblers...
As for the food...quality was impeccable and quantity humungous...i relished the chicken crispers(its a miracle how they manage to make it so oil free)...i wud recommend the triple decker if u go in a large group..it was followed by roasted pepper chkn which was an absolute delight...country fried chkn was also gud..but it was the chocolate chip paradise pie which stole the show...
Overall,the pocket pinch is worth it i wud say..
Am gonna cum bak vry soon and lookin to savour the othr delicacies on the menu..
Till then, giddyup fellas!!

I love the feel in Chili's, the whole sports bar like atmosphere. It has an infectious buzz always. Service was smooth. We ordered the tripple dipper, texas ranch burger and bacon burger. It was the closest to an authentic american cuisine. Loved it. Pocket pinch for 2 was 1700.

Saw it trending on Zomato and decided to try it right away. Visited it with my wife and we were not disappointed at all. Ambience good and gives you the american kinda feel. Staff is good and service was also good. Menu was different from almost all the places that you will visit across the city so definitely new things to try out. Ordered Lemonade and Mango Margarita for drinks. Will definitely suggest trying the Mango Margarita. Triple Dippers for Starters was nice with all the 3 appetizers and the dips were good. For the main course we ordered Blackened Fish and Blackened Salmon which was served with rice and veggies. All the above were good and surely worth a try. Pocket Pinch 2000 bucks for a couple.

This place had been on my wishlist for quite some time and finally a post-exam splurge saw that wish come to light.We ordered a triple dipper,blackened salmon,orleans jumbalaya,steak,coke pitchers and the chocolate chip paradise pie(Yeah we were hungry! ).
The triple dipper was the first to arrive and the first bite of the eggrolls was a burst of flavor.The 3 dips given alongside are a hit.The chicken crispers were done to perfection with a crunchy exterior and a moist chicken beneath.Tho' i did not like the chicken wings at all.The sauce coating spoilt the flavor of an otherwise well cooked chicken piece.
The blackened salmon was done just right with a nice charred flavor adding a twist.
The jumbalaya was the most disappointing of the lot as it felt unappetizing.Though the texture was okay and the seasoning spot on,it lacked the flavor of the other dishes.
The steak was served with mashed potatoes and gravy,corn on the cob and garlic toast.The steak was more well done than medium rare as i had asked for but was acceptable.The real treat of the day was the corn on the cob,hands down the best corn ive had in my life.Juicy,tender and oh so sweet.The mashed potatoes were a delight too.
The pie was served piping hot and we jumped at it and it was gone as soon as it came.
The service is good tho' they did forget a coke pitcher and we had to remind them.
The place is a bit expensive but when the food comes its Ready.Set.Gorge.

A proper tex-mex restro that Kolkata deserved. Try out the Buffalo steak, with corn-on-cob and mashed potatoes! Trust me, you would never feel like going to Oly or Mocambo again. If you are in for a quickie (with respect to food), try the triple dipper, sumptuous, delicious, the choice of sauce is amazing. For desert, try the cheesecake. A must go for all food lovers.

While the ambience was good and the food delectable, I ended up being disappointed for a very different reason. We went to celebrate our birthday and the staffs never sung the birthday song which they do, despite the fact that we had the routine cake cutting done inside the restaurant itself. Might seem to be a little thing, but I will take away 2 stars for this and not visit this place again for a birthday treat at least.

I have to admit that the there is nothin negative I can talk about this place. Food os awesome, and so is the size of the dish. The ambiance is truly american Mexico. The best part for me was that the staff were so jolly and helpful, it made my food even more delicious. I have a son who is menace when we go to any restaurant. After ordering my food I didnt had to bother about him at all. Everyone took good care of him.

Chili's is a restaurant chain founded by Larry Lavine. The chain has many casual dining restaurants, in the U.S. and Canada. The chain can also be found in 31 other countries around the world. Noe they have opened in Kolkata.
One of the better restaurants of Quest Mall and not overpriced.
We ordered Tripple Dipper for starters and Chipotle Pesto Shrimp Pasta for main course. The quantity was soo good that we did not require another main course. Instead we ordered their renowned dessert - Molten Chocolate Cake.
The overall experience was amazing, with cold drinks served in beer jugs.. :)
The only problem is.. Its toooo overpriced!!
Overall 35% tax!! This seemed absurd! So i wud deduct one point.

Cost of 2 in my case - 3000 approx (no alcohol).

Starting with the ambience, all was good  the place was excellent could have rated it a 5star but couldn't as staff didn't know what they were serving and rest all was well food portions was massive and the best was notably the buffalo steak and the enchiladas mouth smacking food but lacks the authenticity as coleslaw is never served with Mexican food and guacamole was obviously missing salsa was was dry and the sour cream was sweet, as a chef myself these were the good and bad things that I found notably in the restaurant. But to tickle the taste buds one should obviously visit there and for myself will surely give it another go

In Kolkata, Chili‚Äôs resides on the food court floor of the Quest Mall i.e. the fourth floor. Food herein will give you the feel of a true blue Mexican ranch. It‚Äôs mostly (also read highly) non vegetarian, greasy and served in large portions. ‚ÄòChili‚Äô in fact is a non veg spicy stew.
  They have portions that I can only describe as insane. Make sure that you don't eat all day if you have dinner plans here, because the scrumptious grub will have you stuffing your face despite protests from your poor tummy.

This is one of the most amazing restaurants that serve Mexican n American food. The staff was very polite and prompt. Their promptness of responding and service is worth mentioning. I had been there with a friend and thoroughly enjoyed the food and mocktail. The mocktail was served in an excellent manner and was very refreshing. In appetizers triple dipper was the best. You must try the smoky chipotle chicken fajitas. Overall it was a wonderful experience. Would surely like to go back soon

Chili‚Äôs is an almost forty year old American chain of restaurants that serves American food influenced by Tex-Mex cuisine. It has a world over mega presence and is also present in eight major cities of India.

In Kolkata, Chili‚Äôs resides on the food court floor of the Quest Mall i.e. the fourth floor. Food herein will give you the feel of a true blue Mexican ranch. It‚Äôs mostly (also read highly) non vegetarian, greasy and served in large portions. ‚ÄòChili‚Äô in fact is a non veg spicy stew.

This diner is built lengthways, and you can see the eating area, bar like counter, washroom and kitchen in a straight line order. Adjacent to the eating area is a small reception area. The wooden straight lined furniture, young and enthusiastic waiters etc. will give you the nostalgia of a good Pizza Hut place! And yes, they have their own birthday holler for the diners. Youngsters may find it zesty, but it can be an ear sore for a little mature crowd. 

An intelligent d√©cor setting by the management - is the inclusion of good quality, semi transparent and fixed curtains drawn on the wall sized glass panes that are present on the entire length of the eating area. Unlike this one, many diners don‚Äôt realize that a topside view may or may not be equivalent to a good or soothing view. And in such diners, in spite of grabbing a window seat, the diners are forced to witness a ridiculous view. Thankfully here, this problem is well taken care of.

The menu is very well designed and picture rich. Though vegetarian options are less, but they are well presented in the menu, so as to facilitate smooth ordering. The bar like counter does not serve hard drinks. Currently it only serves beer and mocktail. Their jumbo serving cup is a pure treat to the eyes. Not only the food portions are big, the accompanying side dishes (dips, salads, french fries etc.) are also served generously.

It is a perfect place for youngsters who enjoy a healthy appetite, quick service and energetic ambience.

CHILI'S , I love them. I love it hot, I love it spicy. So my girlfriend almost pushed me inside this place. I walked in a bit reluctantly. However, this guy walked up to us and we were seated. The guy taking our order was unusually polite and that demeanour alone started to impress me, they take the orders hunched near the table and not standing. I felt very comfortable and appreciated their helpfulness in making the selection. When ordering soft drinks, I was told that only one would suffice since they refill it for free as many times as you like. We started with the Texas Cheese Poppers which was a blast. The problem arose when I could not decide what to order for the main course. After sufficient deliberation, I decided to go for the Grilled Tenderloin Steak and was in a different place altogether from the moment I put it in my mouth.. It was fabulous, but I have to add, that given the generous portions, I had lost my vigour to go at it, much unlike how I had initially started. The food is great, no doubt, but the monotony may get the better of you, substantially earlier than you actually finish the food. My tenderloin steak was somewhat rough even though it was well done and it took some effort to actually finish it. Overall, I really liked it for the most part and have gone back twice with no intention of putting a halt to my visits..The cost of dinner for two people would perhaps set you back by Rs.1100 to Rs.1500 but it is unlikely that you would complain..ENJOY

A nice place for a evening out. Wonderful experience with courteous staffs and an ambience. The menu was as expected - a mix of Tex-Mex with infusion of cajun / country flavors.
Tried the mango Margarita (seasonal)- a mocktail made like a traditional margarita with mango juice- good with flavors hitting the right notes.
Triple Dipper- a starter platter with chicken wings (a bit too tangy for our taste), chicken fritters (soft smooth taste -goes well with the dips) and wonderful south west egg rolls (simply delicious)
Main course was-
Chipotle chicken pasta- subtle spicy flavor in white sauce, with very rightly done chicken breast (succulent and juicy)
Country fried chicken- again very nicely breaded and fried with white sauce mashed potato and corn on cob (juicy and sweet)
Finished off with Classic Cheesecake (a bit dry and somewhat disappointing)

Overall a good experience!!!

If you are going for lunch on a weekend keep some time in hand as there is a long waiting line, but the food is worth the wait.

A new establishment in the heart of kolkata. I am not a food critique. So never had any experience with foreign cuisines. But wanted to experience the flavours of the world. The red t shirt clad waiters were very helpful and helped us with the menu. The cuisines looked interesting & we experimented but not too much. Tripple dipper - a dish with three distinct dips & three different chicken preparations. Chicken steak was nicely cooked. Well seasoned. And last but not the least the desert. A caramelized chocolate icecream typ thing. Slllluuuuurrrrrppp !!!!
Definitely visit & njoy. Cheers. !!!!

I went for lunch twice there. I order for two type of platter and end up full stomach :D
Love the ambiance and friendly staffs. They serve really nicely.
First time I ordered : Bar-B-que chicken salad
                                      Crispy Chicken tacos
                                      Smoky Chipotle Chicken Fajitas 
Sweet dish :               Molten Chocolate cake

The salad was good . I liked the fajita also..I preferred the solid chicken served like Sizzlers.
The sweet dish was really yummy.
But didn't like the tacos.It was very bad choice of food and the combination of serving was very weird and not at all tasty.


Second time I ordered : Classic Chicken Fajita
                                            Chipotle Pesto Chicken Pasta
 Sweet Dish :                   Cheese Cake

Both the dish were nice. Well again the sweet dish was excellent mouth watering.

To all lovers of food. The experience at Chilli in Kolkata at the Quest Mall was disappointing ! The Mexican food as they claim to serve was very bad in taste. Nachos were absolutely very bad. So were the Quesadillas . I recommend that the Management takes a lesson from Chilli in Bangalore and Delhi and update their preparation of dishes.As far as food lovers are concerned , a new opening is always welcome , but the quality of food - VERY VERY BAD !

I expected so much more to be honest. The experience on the whole left me slightly disappointed. Might have been a classic case of having heard so much, but then the food not hitting the same highs. We ordered the cherry cola, the bacon burger, the triple dipper and the cajun chicken sandwich. 

The cherry cola was good. Nice cherry flavour with the fizz Really refreshing after the heat. The appetizers were really good. I like the triple dipper. The chicken wings were tender, spicy and really had flavour. The batter fried chicken was quite beautiful. Almost as tender as fish and was the highlight of the day for me. Again, barring one of the dips, the others did not seem to fit in perfectly. I am not sure how that could happen. The burger was so-so. Tender, had some flavour. Bacon was more or less smoky, but just didn't have the oomph. I mean this wouldn't rank in as the best burgers I have had. They do serve a lot of fries, which again are inconsistent. Some limp, some crispy and some of them just fried too much. The sandwich was what disappointed terribly. Not enough flavours in there. Too dry and after a while was just painful going through all that bread.

Would I be back? Perhaps to try the ribs or the steak, but feels bad when a place promises so much and then fails to deliver on that level. Again, I['ll clarify, it is a decent place to eat, but since they are charging a fair bit, you do hope for better. Hopefully the liquor license will help their cause.

Chili's is one of those restaurants which stands out (without trying too hard) because of the right combinations of ambiance, food and service. It was my friend's treat and I am glad I chose Chili's. The ambiance was full of life, conversations and laughter. The staff were very well-trained and friendly. I don't remember the last time I was served so well. The guy who came to take our order greeted us with a big smile and bent to a squat to take the order. We took some time to decide and he was really patient and eager to help us decide. We were inclined on ordering 3 dishes for the main course but our server assured us that 2 would suffice and in case we still had room for one more dish, he would serve that later. Not many restaurants offer such great service and I would give Chili's a 5/5 for their staff. We ordered Texas cheese poppers for starters. It was crispy on the outside, cheesy on the inside and amazing on the taste buds. Sharing the appetizer wasn't the right decision. We were disappointed when it got over. We ordered separate dishes for the main course. I had veggie and cheese quesadillas which was served with sour cream, salsa, beans and rice. It was an entire meal on a plate. My friend ordered a big mouth bacon burger which was served with fries. Food portions were generous and though the food was very delicious, we both struggled to finish it off. We had non-alcoholic margarita along with our food which was refreshing. The cost of this meal was approximately 1500 rupees. Although I wasn't the one to pay the bill, I feel it was money well-spent. Hope my friend feels the same way. :D

Ok... so what can i say other than this was a fabulous experience visiting this place... i dont know how come i did not go to this place earlier than this.... it was a blockade in my head... but i finally went there and i had a great experience with just mouth watering food...

first of all we did not have a reservation and walked in the place at 9 on a wednesday... we got a table opposite the bar (which does not serve alcohol as of now) and the fell of the place was fantastic... it feels like a stereotypical American Diner with booths and a diner middle and tv on top of it... instead of 1 they had like 5 TV playing from sports to cartoons to News... fanatastic feel to the place and pretty clean as well...

secondly comes the people serving us.... they were super friendly helping out with the menu and they knew exactly what is what which was amazing... brownie point to the guy who informed us that the Veg burger is made with Soya and will have the smell of it as well... he was way to kind... 

and then the food... oh my god... for 3 people we did over order a bit... for starters we called for a onion and pepper stack which is a deep fried item... for a deep friend item it was made to perfection and was pretty light compared to it being served in other places... the batter taste was spot on and the pepper we realized later were jalepenos which was just amazing... 

after which we called for a Fajitas which they give you the items and tell you to make it yourself which is a fun thing to do and the menu there has a drawing for the perfect fajitas.... the Cottage Cheese given on a sizler with the fajitas was so so fresh it felt like it was made right now and melts in your mouth... the dips given are great as well though the salsa lacked a little spice...

the Enchilada was served but it is not the oven baked enchilada which you get around town... they have their own preperation which is AMAZING... the sauce served on top was very very good and the stuffing was over loading and delicious to the level of it... 

the Burger we called for was a CLASSIC AMERICAN BURGER... now the kind of person  i am i go and try the burger everywhere in search for the real thing and this place came very very close to it and they were very tasty.....

for drinks we called for a mocktail called fusion which was good though the syrup put into that was way too much and then we called for a lemonade which was made to perfection....

now the reasons i have put away.5 marks and not given them a full 5....
a. the ketchup bottle on our table was sticky like crazy and really dirty.... upon tasting we realized that the ketchup had gone bad and got the bottle removed though no spare was given and we were almost at the end of the meal...

b. the black pepper shaker well does not work properly cause they are trying to serve fresh crushed pepper in a shaker... and the crushed parts dont fit in the holes of the shaker...

c. they forgot to get my order for the lemonade but were hurried enough to get it fast later...

d. if you are sitting in the corner it might be tough to catch the attention of the guys serving though there are many of them...

for these reasons i am pulling away 1 point but the food and the behaviour of the guy serving us i am just taking away 0.5

all in all a lovely experience... another thing is that this place has a service charge which is a NOT a tax but an amount deducted for service by the waiters and others which is like a TIP pre paid and added to the bill... so check out the amount you want to leave above and beyond the charge that they have....

all in all i am a for sure fan of this place and will be going again and again... i had a great time and the food is just very very good....

As you step into the 4th Floor or the food court of the Quest Mall...your eyes easily catch the attention of Chili's. 

Our visit was on a Saturday evening and we had to wait for a good 30 mins to get inside. The interior gives you a tex-mex feel. There is a row fitted with multiple TVs facing a Bar Counter with stools. The place is casual and fun with chatters bursting out all around and it is exactly how it is meant to be...unlike any fine dining. The waiters kneel down near your table to discuss menu with you as an informal approach but its quite different and I definitely liked it. They are smart and courteous. 

If it happens to be your birthday they even sing a birthday song together merrily clapping hands.

Water was immediately served in large mugs which is again something informal and different.

They have an extensive menu ranging from salads to burgers to tacos to fajitas. We tried Roasted Red Pepper Chicken and Grilled Chicken Platter. The chicken was excellently succulent and came on a bed of rice and with steamed veggies, all of which tasted great. Service was prompt. The portions were also sufficient and the cost is on the affordable side...‚Çπ900 for 2. And if you want to have more like a starter or a sweet ending...then it will add to it. 

I recommend this place to all who love to taste a variety of foods and spend a lovely time with family or friends.

Chilies is one of my favourite places to eat American/Mexican/Continental.

I have gone to Chilies in Delhi many times and I finally went to Chilies in Quest Mall, Kolkata yesterday. If I could give one word  to that experience it would be " Fabulous". 

I had gone there for lunch with my friend and the food was simply amazing. The portion size was very good and the drinks were  one the best non-alcoholic drinks I have had till now ( and since I travel a lot, I would say this in comparison with all the restaurants I have been too).

I would definitely recommend you to order Evolution ( I had the non-alcoholic version) and Cherry Cola. ( I had had this in America and I was thrilled to see it being served here.) Totally Yumm..!!

You must try the chicken Quesedillas and Calamari rings ( Squid). 

The food quality is superb ( you might find the rates to be on the higher side, but the portion size, quality and taste makes it absolutely worth it!) . 

The ambiance is very chill, bright and clean. Our meal including 3 main course and 2 drinks, costed us 1800.

 If I could I would probably go there every week! :)

Yesterday i visited this restaurant with my friend but it was not the first time that i visited this place. I was really impressed the first time so i suggested my friend to have lunch here. We ordered blackened fish, tenderloin stake and black berry ice tea. First of all the way they attend you is worth mentioning, the staffs are very polite and at the same time they help you out in choosing your dishes which is quite nice. They do take time to serve the food but then again the quality of food that they serve makes up for that delay. The quantity of the drink was really great and unlike other restaurants they do not fill the drink with ice cubes only(thank god for that) and along with the quantity the taste is equally good. The blackened fish was yummy and it was a wholesome meal as they served it with veggies, rice and a tasty dip.The fish just melted in my mouth, here I must say that as i was not well i was looking for something healthy and this dish was healthy as well as tasty. My friend also enjoyed his grilled tenderloin and by looking at his expressions i could actually vouch that he was equally impressed. For yesterday's visit i would definitely give chili's 5 as my rating. In my first visit i tried the triple dipper which had in it chicken wings, southwestern egg rolls and chicken crispers and among these i loved the last one as the chicken wings had a weird taste and the egg rolls were average and not worth trying again. The other two dishes that we took were country fried chicken and fajitas. I absolutely fell in love with the former dish and the way they served it i.e. with mashed potato and the corn on the cob( simply delectable ) and the fajita was also tasty. For my previous visit i would have rated it 4.5. But I must say that in Kolkata this place should be a must visit for all the food lovers and also otherwise. I would definitely go back again and again.

On a lovely rainy afternoon thought to take my wife on a romantic long drive and ended up at Quest Mall. When the hunger strikes back we thought to venture a long waited restaurant in your wishlist known as ‚ÄúChili‚Äôs‚Äù. It‚Äôs located at 4th floor of the mall.
We got a cozy seat straight away at a table overseeing the skyline of Beckbagan. Ambiance is great all looking sparkling new. They have exhaustive menu for all kind of taste buds. Staffs were courteous and water was served immediately once we sat.
After venturing through pages in the menu we finally ordered Roasted Red Pepper Chicken and Country Friend Chicken. For beverages options are only non-alcoholic as they don‚Äôt have license. Service was prompt and dish was presented in mere 10 minutes or so. Presentation was so good that you can feel the taste with your eyes.
Roasted Red Pepper Chicken: The chicken was succulent covered with cheese and sauces. Broccoli tasted great along with the steamed rice. Was going great with soothing afternoon.
Country Friend Chicken: The chicken was crispy from outside and soft inside. Generous covering of gravy. A mashed potato was excellent but for the winner was sweet corn on the cob. With every bite one will feel each and every steamy kernel was so juicy. 
Bit expensive around INR 950 for two for mid-income groups but the moment was priceless. Will visit again for sure.

Chili's has been our staple haunt on most of our last few visits to Quest Mall, and lucky for me, I have ended up sampling more than my fair share of their sumptuous menu spread. The decor of the place is definitely catchy, and we were twice lucky enough to get the seats on the window side overlooking the road, and once on a rain drenched evening, and it was heavenly. The staff is very polite, courteous and ready to help you with their suggestions. Amongst the appetizers, the Chicken Wings and Classic Nachos with Fajita Chicken are my two favourites, and soon-to-be-hubby-dearest swears by the overtly generous dish of Triple Dipper with Chicken Crispers, Chicken Wings and Southwestern Eggrolls. The Cajun Club Chicken Sandwich, Crispy Honey Chipotle Chicken Crispers, Santa Fe Sandwich and Blacked Salmon are also absolute hits with him while I am in love with the Kicked Up Quesadillas. However, my favouritest of the lot has to be the Baby Back Ribs in Original BBQ Sauce and the Orleans Jambalaya, what sheer delights! Oh, and their Corn on the Cob is the best one I have ever had!  The desserts are power packed generous amounts, and we love the Cheesecake, the Brownie Sundae, and their signature dish, the Molten Chocolate Cake. Chili's also boasts of an exhaustive non-alcoholic beverages menu, and we love the Evolution, the Frappe, the Strawberry Iced Tea and all others that we have sampled till date.

Zomato gets one thing absolutely right with their Chili's entry. The cost for two is actually Rs 1200! Our bill amount for the two of us was Rs 1281. Not bad, eh? Many other restaurants state an average cost, which is way lesser than the actual bill which is coughed up every time. So ya, I appreciate this accurate pricing.
I finally walked into Chili's since it opened end of last year, with a lot of excitement. Order was Texas Cheese Fries, Crispy Hone-Chipotle Chicken Crispers, Cherry Cola, Chocolate Shake and an extra serving of Bacon. 
The fries were very tasty which cheesy and spicy veg chile on top. I just did not like the bits of kidney beans (rajma) in the chile. Fries and rajma? No no! Quantity is a lot. Clearly for two.
The chicken crispers were very yummy too. Served with a sweet sauce. Five long crispers. Served with the best corn on the cob ever!! and some more home-style fried. Yeah, was a bit of fries OD!
The drinks were the bestest. Cherry cola, so commonly available in the West, was excellent. Cola with a cherry twist, wow. The choco shake, delicious, creamy and thick. Sinful!
The extra side order of bacon was for my bae. He's so coming back next time, armed to devour the famous Baby Back pork Ribs! :-D
And me, I am surely coming back to try so many of the new stuff on the menu. I drooled over the awesome looking huge serving of dessert on the table next to mine!
The service is professional and smart. We were promptly informed that the Fajita Trio contains buffalo meat. 
So yes, though very very steeply priced, this place is a must visit for a change of food scene in Kolkata. You'll be excited, I bet you! 
P.S. I suggest go in the late evening, they will roll up the curtains and you will be able to see Kolkata from the Quest height! I loved it!

I can‚Äôt say I was much impressed by chili‚Äôs. We had ordered a Triple Dipper for appetizer which were good except for the chicken wings.  This was followed by cilantro pesto chicken pasta with mixed sauce which I would advise others not to try. You can get much more delicious pasta is other restaurants, however we had also ordered blackened fish which was reasonably well cooked and quite tasty.
Overall the experience was just ok, neither hated it nor loved it. But for sure won‚Äôt be lining up in front to get in the next time

Chili's - the new hot spot for Kolkata foodies since it opened in the Quest Mall few months back. Its one of those place where everyone has been to and there is a kind of peer pressure that makes you visit the place. So its line of cuisine is American and Mexican - largely unknown to this writer other than Burgers and Nachos served in cans. So, it was with some trepidation that I stepped in. Feedback had been mixed but expectations were high - a 4.5 expectation to start with. Since we are starting with a high assumed rating, let us follow a score down apporach. Evaluate on 5 parameters - Location and Ambience, Menu and Availability, Service, Taste and Quality. and subtract points if the expectations are not met.

Location and Ambience:
Heart of City, Big posh mall, lots of parking - cant have a better location. 'The ambience is more fast food than fine dining but that is how the restaurant is positioned. The seating is comfortable and reasonably spaced out and affords some sort of privacy. The lighting is sufficient and if you are lucky enough to get a seat on the front glass facaded side, then you can enjoy the view as well :). No scope of deducting points here.

Menu and Availability:
This was the tricky part - lots of options but some real tongue twisters. I didnt know how to pronounce half of them and the silent "j" in Fajitas may not be most obvious to most Kolkatans. However, that actually serves the purpose of introducing a new cuisine to the City's foodscape. Wide variety and everything available. The menu is meat dependent and not exactly recommended for a Jain diet :) but for a avowed non-vegetarian like me .. no complaints again. One doubt though ... what are pizzas doing in a Americn/ Mexican food joint? However, they are serving only mocktails right now but one would expect
beer to go with this cuisine. If they have a no-alcohol policy, then they may look at options like Tuborg zero. The beverages section left a bit to be desired and hence a Minus 0.25

Service :
They are introducing a new casual type of service. The waiters dressed in smart Tees and Denim would introduce themselves to you at the table with a big and informal "hi". While taking orders they kneel by the table but it is not a subservient gesture in any way - its just a way of casual convenience for both the customer and waiter. The requirements are met quickly and there is a big smile all around.

Food :
We ordered the triple dipper chicken basket and a combined (buffalo and chicken meat) Quesadillas. The food was obviously fresh but that is a given with kind of rush they are seeing. The taste was the real clincher. The cuisine really tasted new and different and yet there were no unpleasant shocks. The small ideas like serving Rajma-chawal with the Quesadillas added a quaint twist to the dishes. We really liked the taste of both the items.

VFM:
Here comes the surprise - the portions were huge. Being my first time, I had ordered two dishes as mentioned above but once we were served the Triple dipper basket, we knew it would be beyond us to finish the food. Ultimately we ended up packing a good 30% of the food even after stuffing ourselves upto the nose. The bill came to just a little more than Rs.900 and it owuld really have been sufficient for 3 to 4 people. Given the location, ambience, food and service - the average cost of Rs.300 is a steal. This was definitely beyond our expectations and hence a Plus 0.5 here.

So, we end up with a score 4.5 - 0.25 +0.5 =4.75 which i would translate to 4.5 on the Zomato scale.

I've eaten at Chili's numerous times in the USA and I was not too disappointed with the franchise here. However, my favourite thing to order (as a meal) is the Triple Dipper (which is an appetizer). My problem with the Triple Dipper in the Kolkata Chili's is that they force you to eat the chicken wings, chicken crispers and southwestern eggrolls. However, the Chili's in USA lets you CHOOSE your three appetizers. I always used to order the Spinach and Artichoke dip and I miss that here. Also, the restaurant needs its bar license SOON!

I had been waiting for long for Chili's to
Open in Calcutta but was highly disappointed when I finally went there. I have previously eaten at a Chili's outlet in America and at one in Bangalore. The Bangalore food serves food with the exact same taste as the one in America but the one in Calcutta was no where close. I don't know if they have altered the taste to suit the palate of the people of the region but it was certainly not something that I was expecting. No other complaint as such. The ambience and location are great and the service is highly commendable. For people eating at a Chili's outlet for the first time will have a great experience with the food but the ones like me who are aware of the authentic taste of the brand, will not be left too happy.

Location - 
On 4th floor of quest mall, its an easy to visit place. getting place is really difficult,
and one needs to wait a bit. We went on weekday afternoon lunch, and got seat luckily for 2. Howver, the resto was pretty full.


Food - 

Started the show with Classic Nachos - 300 bucks, which was pretty tasty. The nachos were crispy, and there were around 10 of them nicely decorated.

In main course, we ordered - 
Smoky Chipotle Chicken Fajitas - 400 bucks
This was like chicken sizzler, but taste was out od the world. The chicken was hidden under think layers of cheese/mayo.
The decoration on top was also nice, specially, the fired / coated onion rings.

Cricpy Honey-Chipotle Chicken Crispers - 375 bucks
My wife tried this, with solid chicken coated in honey sauce. Servered with french fries, and boiled corn.

Service -
The service is OK, just that waiter needs to be reminded to serve water 2 times. Howveer, they serve water in tumbler, with was B I G.

Overall - An awesome experince, need to visit again to try out other fancy options. The food options/lists are huge, and multiple visits are badly needed here.

Highly recommended place !!!!!

3rd time around and it calls for a review, great place location wise and ambiance is good. Sunday afternoon brunch was just great. I came here the first time to taste the steak as I am on a quest to find the best stake in Kolkata and I am happy to report that the search is still on. 
So let‚Äôs come down to the food, the triple dipper: well a good way to sample a variety of dishes at a good price, loved the chicken crisper and the south-western egg-rolls.
Classic Nachos: Nothing to compliment here, they were just tasteless.
Country fried chicken: Well the most succulent pieces of chicken soaking in oil is the best way to describe them. I just loved it can't wait for them to get a bar license as this will be a perfect mix with em beers.
Fajita Trio:  Just loved the combination of the grilled buffalo, chicken and prawns. Served on a bed of caramelized onions grilled red and green peppers. Highly recommend.

I suggest if you are here first time around try the platters which have a mix of dishes to sample as this gives you an opportunity to taste the best at an affordable price.
Cons: The only downside I find here is that there is reluctance from the staff to customize the dishes to your taste, for example if you want something a little spicier they find it hard to accommodate.

So go ahead and try this place for sure and you will be truly satisfied and will surely go back for more.

Visit to this place was waste of money and not made for vegetarians !!
Ordered a meal for kids which was average 
Also ordered cheese poppers, four cheese pizza , Bombay burger , everything had a smell of oil they use couldn't even eat anything completely wasted 
Drinks were still better like chilled frappe and cherry cola 

Bt I must say it is not worth a visit for vegetarians and high on pocket pinch 
Would never visit again

Currently my most favourite restaurant in Kolkata. The place is small but ambience is great. There are multiple number of TV's and the waiters are very courteous and very prompt. 
Went on evening of 5th for my birthday celebration. Cost is very good compared to the portion. We had a Tripple Dipper, the mayonnaise were awesome as were the grilled different items. Mistakenly was ordering beef but thankfully the waiter notified me what animal I was ordering :D I had Jambalaya and what heavenly spiced rice I ever had. Yum. Amazing portions too and the prawns and diced chicken were awesome too. We also had a pepper Chicken Breast which looked awesome and tasted awesome too, the Chicken was very tasty as was the Broccoli. Finally we had Molten Chocolate Cake, beautifully decorated, hot chocolate oozing out and cold ice cream on top.
Verdict: Not only heavenly looking food, but heavenly tasting too. Hope quality remains same. Pricing is very good, hope it stays this way. 
Best way to celebrate a birthday :)

All I can say is that I'm glad that Kolkata now has its own Chili's outlet. It's a great great place to hang for almost every age group. The classic Tex-Mex cuisine is a refreshing thing that is sure to tingle the Bong taste bud. The ambience is cool and red, which is very inviting. The staff is very warm, and they serve fluids (water too) in huge beer mugs (and brownie points for the ice even without asking).
The triple dipper is a must try, so is the calamari, breaded onions, and crispy chicken fries. The tacos and Quesadillas are mouthwatering too. The sauces are almost authentic and veggies really fresh. Quality makes a big difference to food! However the pick of the place is the tenderloin and the baby back steaks, sweet, well done, juicy and just right. This city has not known better steaks! I could not try the pizzas and burgers but am sure coming back.
I also recommend the chocolate baked pie and cheesecake. Cheers!

Chillies the new talk of town is something I have been hearing about for quite some time so this evening we decided to visit with my family of four.After we sat down we ordered for mushroom soup and chicken wings with high expectations and the first and last good tasting dish was really good, that is the soup. The strong mushroom taste¬† hit our palate and it was creamy and delicious And then disaster struck. We were served sorry looking and salt coated chicken wings. On pointing this out to the waiter .He argued with us that the saltiness was due to the sauce ,the logic of which was beyond my comprehension capabilities.

Oh and the Chicken Wings Were Not Crispy!!! (Seriously unheard of!)
Now Main Course Disaster Menu-
Grilled chicken burger came with loads of french fries of course overridden with salt and the burger itself was well pathetic.
The chicken was boiled not grilled.¬† My nine year old daughter said that the chicken was boiled (when isn't it supposed to be grilled).She didn't even touch the french fries her favourite due to the excess amount of salt.
The same goes for the cajun chicken burger which wasn't spicy but the classic taste of our dear chillies; salty. None of the burgers was worth RS.350.
Next the red pepper and the monterey chicken consisted of a breast of boiled tasteless and of course salty chicken.The vegetables were boiled and the white flakes of salt discouraged me to eat it.Mashed potatoes were pathetic and served with pieces of potatoe peels when asked the chef informed us that that was the way it was served.Never in my food journey have I encountered this type of serving of mashed potatoes.And the bacon wrapped around the chicken was tough and chewy.

So overall Chilies you were a major disapointment,maybe it was my bad luck or that's how it is.

Chili's is a really good place to just casually dine or have a snack. It has a typical American environment, and the decor is pretty simple but calming. The food is really tasty and is much better than many restaurants which serve American or Mexican food. The menu has a lot of dishes that we can try. It's something new for Kolkata. We're all tired of KFC and McDonald's aren't we?

My experience with chili's was a total disaster. Was looking forward to eating over here for a while but it failed to create an impression (a good one).
My best guess is that the place is not meant for vegetarian people. We ordered the nachos which were pretty good followed by 2 pastas; white and red sauces. This was the turning point. Red sauce was supposed to be spicy but was simply excessively tangy in taste. The white sauce pasta was very poorly cooked! The white sauce was as thin as milk and the penne pasta failed to absorb the sauce so it simply tasted like boiled pasta.
In and all, it was quite disappointing. I was very eagerly looking forward to eating over here, having read the reviews on zomato.

Chili's is as good as it sounds... As you enter you get a feel of Tex-Mex with wooden walls with 'Buffalo wings' poster, a long mocktail bar with bar stools, bursting with people and a hearty hum of chatter... The wait was short only 5 minutes... Among starters the fried calamari tasted heavenly with two delicious dips as also was the triple dipper. We got cherry cola, blackberry iced tea and strawberry lemonade... all served in huge beer mugs! For mains we had chipotle chicken served with French fries and corn on the cob, blackened fish and prawn and chicken and prawn fajita.... All were fingerlicking good! Ended with cheese cake and a layered hot brownie with cold ice-cream... The desserts were a wee bit on the sweet side... Overall a fresh experience and we can't wait for our next visit to try out the rest of the menu especially the baby pork ribs which was unavailable today....

This is THE destination if you're, well, simply HUNGRY ! I visited this restaurant for the first time on 17.5.2014. Fine Diners - be warned, this isn't a place to pop the question and flaunt the ring. This is simply a place where you don't look at anyone, just look at our own plate and EAT. "Huge" is the word that comes to one's mind when you look at the portions. This is simply wholesome hearty food. Is it healthy food ? Not necessarily. But then, there are times when you are just Hungry and you don't really care. This is one of those places folks.

The decor is lively, though very informal. Its noisy (thank god) and a perfect place to hang out with your friends and catch up on all the gossip that's been brewing for the last few weeks.

We ordered Cajun Chicken Burger, Fish-n-Chips, Country Fried Chicken and then Chocolate Chip Paradise Pie for dessert. The Burger was Big and the chicken was juicy. A large helping of Fries came along with it. The Fish-n-Chips was traditional and the fish used was fresh and good. The Country-friend chicken was a wholesome eat with generous helpings of mashed potato. The Chocolate Chip Paradise Pie was a bit too sweet, even for a bengali like me, but it tasted great otherwise.

They serve drinks in Tumblers which really feels good when you're eating a lot ! 

Price is a tad on the higher side, but overall its justified with the Quality and Quantity that's on offer. Recommended.

Chilli's- the foods are awesome, as me nd my bf visit it, so we didn't order for much foods. For starter we tried honey chicken chipolatas,  they served it with a corn, which was superb and french fries, for the first time I tried buffalo meat,  It was ok for me. I wish to try the pastas, but we were full. No liquor,  which is negative point, but they hav a bar arrangements,  I think in future they will serve it. All over the experience was nice, will like to visit it and taste other foods.

aahh i was super impressed with chili's back in the usa itself and kept cursing my mumbai pals 'coz they had it in their city while we did not! thank u quest for bringing this one for us <3 it is the authentic tex-mex decor, cuisine, the live bar and the extensive menu which managed to fascinate and delight me each time i have been there *_* their triple dipper *3 kinds of awesome fries served with 3 kinds of dipping sauces* is a must must try :D i also loovved their honey-glazed roast chicken with corn-on-the-cob and homestyle fries <3 the buffalo stew was unique and the steak was juicy, meaty with a generous portion of crispy  buttery veggies *ah the broccoli!* and their especially recommended and supplied steak sauce :) their cherry cola too is delightful and comes in a huge beer mug with red straws to match the *cherry* theme! the quantity of food is great and though priced a bit on the higher side, i dont mind one bit shelling out for this type of comfort food..the staff are smiling, knowledgeable and friendly, providing quick service..in lovveee...wish the tax was not so steep :(

A wonderful place to visit. It is a treat for all the senses.
I had ordered Texas Cheese poppers, Quesadilla Explosion Salad, Chicken penne pasta with Alfredo sauce, Blackened Fish and Chocolate chips Paradise Pie.
Each and every one of the items were delicious.
N.B.- Serving size is quite large in tune with the South West American theme of the restaurant. Keep that in mind while ordering. You might well have a hard time restraining yourself while ordering because such a large number of items are available. Images on menu card shows what is actually served, unlike those of KFC, Pizza hut or Domino's.

The first time we went to chili's was two years ago in Delhi. Ever since that day we have been hooked , me and my family couldn't have been happier when it opened up in calcutta. We are regulars here , I mean once a week regular. It's a fantastic place with great food.

The honey chipotle chicken is flavourful and the French fries are heavenly. We love their signature strawberry lemonade and the burgers are out of this world. Must visit.

This place simply ROCKS...true Wild West style. The ambience is amazing, nice and comfy, service is great despite a packed house and an impatient waiting crowd. Went there on a Saturday afternoon (and many afternoon's post that) and had to wait for around 20mins to get in. Once in a true Wild West step up with an amazing bar area (serving mocktails as they were yet to get the liquor license) greeted us. We settled on a "Triple Dipper", Grilled Tenderloin" steak and a peach ice tea and a "cherry-cola". The cherry cola was an amazingly refreshing drink with your munch.The triple dipper had crispy batter fried chicken so well done and amazingly juicy, along with fried chicken wings which were good.
The center of attraction was the steak, proper steak shape and not the usual beef-patty served at other places. It was well done but not burnt with an amazing smoky flavour served with butter mashed potatoes and saute broccoli. The dish was fantastic and I haven't really tasted such fine steak elsewhere in Kolkata. The food was not oily and surprisingly light.Am definitely coming back for a second helping!!
Not to forget...
Got to change the rating and review post a not so great experience on 15Jan17. Went for afternoon lunch, ordered their signature tenderloin steak, medium-well done. What was served was a rubbery and surprisingly watery steak, lacking the taste of the original grilled steak this place serves. Seemed like the cook had boiled/steamed the meat before grilling. The usual sauce was also missing.

Recently visited Chili's for the 2nd time and tried their famous triple dipper and the country fried chicken. Somehow the experience this time was a bit disappointing. Salt was purely over used in the chicken wings and the country fried chicken. We tried their special margarita but that failed to impress as well. Hence revising the rating to 3.5

^07Sep2014

Chili's was on my wishlist right from the day it opened in Quest Mall but somehow or the other the plans were not working out. After cancelling and rescheduling our plans, my friend and I made an impromptu dinner plan on a Saturday evening. Both of us had work so we reached pretty late well past 10Pm. I was sure that we would need to wait since it was a Saturday evening but surprisingly we were seated immediately upon entering.

Located on the fourth floor of Quest mall the restaurant is quite spacious with contemporary American diner style seating arrangements. We occupied one table by the window pane which over looks the busy street below. The seats are comfortable and are charging points on the sides below the tables for charging your portable electronic devices. The entire restaurant is well lit and has a wooden flooring. Though Chili's does not have a liquor license as yet, it has a big bar serving mock tails. 

The waiter presented us with the menu and waited for our orders. We needed some time to decide and upon inquiring we found out that the latest time for the last order  11.30Pm.   
After a few minutes my friend ordered a Chipotle Pesto Chicken Pasta and a Country fried chicken for myself along a Cherry Cola.

The Cherry cola was served within a few minutes and the food arrived in another 10-15 minutes. Both of us were damn hungry and we were delighted to see the huge portions :) 
The pasta (Penne) was white sauce based and tasted very nice. It had considerable amount of chicken tossed with creamy sauce and Parmesan cheese. The pasta was served with garlic toast. 
The country fried chicken consists of a thick slab of crispy chicken(chicken breast) with sweet corn and spicy mashed potato. It was definitely a treat to the eyes ! One bite into the chicken and it was sheer bliss ! The sweet corn served along side was extremely sweet, juicy and succulent. Perhaps the sweetest corn I have ever tasted. The spiced up mashed potato balanced the taste very well and is a fabulous combination !  I did not taste the cherry cola but according to my friend it tasted nice 

I loved the food and the service here. For me Chili's did live upto the hype by serving lip smacking food and huge portions. It is pricey but makes up for it with the quantity and quality of the food. My recommendation would be to go in a group of 4-5 so that multiple items can be sampled. Our bill was around Rs 1200 including taxes. Will be back for more !

Chili's in Kolkata has opened in Quest Mall. Its another among the many existing outlets of Chili's found all over the country.

But the only disappointment here is that they don't serve alcohol in the Kolkata outlet. Hence its funny to see a big bar at the corner of the place.

We ordered a penne pesto pasta with smoked chicken, and a salad. Due to unavailability of alcohol, we had to go for two mocktails. 
The pasta tasted really good. Flavors were just right and quantity of serving was good.
The salad was pretty good as well.

Serving alcohol would bring this outlet at par with other outlets of the chain.
Shall i go there again? Of course.

Mexican food is just awesome and so is CHILI's. Firstly, i loved the logo and more to go the decor of the place is really cool!! Had a really good time when was out there for lunch yesterday.

Me and my friend got a nice cozy corner to sit chat and of course EAT till our stomach ached. We ordered triple dipper for starters along with peach iced tea and lemonade. What i should not forget to mention is that the quantity served is huge. The beverages served in big beer mug type glasses couldn't be consumed all at once. The sauces for dipping were super delicious. Of the 3 varieties of starters served i loved the south-western eggrolls the most. Crisp n succulent. What a combo to taste. The chicken wings were next n last was chicken crispers amongst the three. Next we ordered Fajita Trio. Buffalo steak chicken n shrimp was served wid warm tortillas. I tasted buffalo for the first time n i have no idea whether it was under cooked or what it was very much elastic like and a bit bitter too. Initially it was though ok bt as it started getting cold it became even more elastic. The shrimp n chicken were delicious. Lastly the winner stands alone! MOLTEN CHOCOLATE CAKE. Its most out of the world deserts i had in my life. Anyone visiting chilis shouldn't leave the place widout having this particular desert. Frozen from top with d warm cake carrying the melted chocolate inside! Ummmmm!!. Speechless...

One thing am sure about  is that i m gonna visit this place often until i get a taste of all delicacies. Very decent service lovely food and chilled out decor gives chilis my thumbs up!!

I'v been there once and since then I am a big fan of this place. 

The decor gives you you feeling of actual steak house of Texas or  Mexico, the wooden finish, the seating arrangement the ambiance is so up to  the mark of international standard.

it was late afternoon and hunger took over my mind so without wasting any more time we ordered one Grilled Chicken Platter, And I am a sucker for mushrooms so I ordered Jack Mushroom Fajitas for myself and two Fresh Lime Soda. The staffs were very attentive and helped us choose the right dish of our choice.

Soon we were served the orders with a bucket of soft Tortilla breads and one plate which had yummy dollop or sour cream, tomato salsa  and grated cheese. The Chicken platters and Chicken Fajita looked so yummy that it increased my hunger, the Fresh Lime Sodas came in a huge beer mugs. We almost jumped in and gorged our meal. My Chicken steak was absolutely tender and juicy with loads on sauteed mushrooms and Jack Cheese over it. It was very tasty and flavorful boy not at all spicy. The Grilled Chicken platter was equally great. The sour cream and grated Cheese accompanied well with the tortilla breads. Each sip of the fresh lime soda was so refreshing, it was lemony, minty  and ice cold and best to go with stakes, though I wish I could have had beer as an option, still i was happy with my drink.

At the end of that fulfilling meal we paid about rs.1300/- which was perfect considering the place, food and overall experience. 

 I give a THUMBS UP to this place.

Worst Service...Even after complaining to the manager that the Chili's team isn't active enough no action was taken.
I had to Call for waiter around 4-5 times and then asked for a water 4-5 times then we got drinking water. They won't take order, they won't answer when you call them, they won't clear your table, after being asked repeatedly.

If you are looking or good food with good service then Chili's isn't the right choice.

I had been a fan of Chillis for quite some time now.
Having been to the Hyderabad one (Inorbit mall) a couple of times, and the Mumbai one (Powai), I always secretly wished Chillis to open up in Kolkata.
Well, I didn't have to wait for eternity, as I came to know that Chillis has opened up in the Quest mall.
So, one fine afternoon, we drove to Quest, parked our car (Free Parking at Quest Mall - unbelievable at today's times) and went to the top floor.
It was a weekend hence a little bit crowded. The girl at the front desk noted our names and called us within 10 mins.
The environment inside was similar to the other Chillis, with Music playing, and a Sports-bar meets a Texas Salon.
However, the shape of the restaurant is a peculiar.It's like long and narrow, much like a train's compartment with booths on either side.
We got a table on the glass side, overlooking the road and buildings outside, and the view was pleasant.
Coming to the food, we ordered for a 'Kicked up Quesadilla' with a Chicken and Steak Combo and their classic Lemonades.
The food came promptly, and it was delicious. Marinated Chciken and Steak with grilled onions ,jalapenos ,cheese in buttery toasted Fajitas.
It came with house salad, sour cream , black beans and some rice. It was wholesome for the 2 of us.
We just relished the taste (given the dearth of US/Mexican food joints in Kolkata) and finished it up.
We were happier, fuller people on our way back.
Thanks Chillis, you have never disappointed me, and ...I'll be back !!

I would have given the restaurant a 4+ rating had they known how to make margarita. I ordered it with my fajitas, and they gave me something sweet in a sugar rimmed beer mug.  The food however, I must mention, was to our liking. For steak lovers this is one place to bank on. We tried the triple dipper, but wanted the chicken wings boneless, and the steward promptly obliged. The staff is friendly. But since they do not offer prior reservation, it is recommended to visit early, especially in the weekends.

Chili‚Äôs is such a joy! The Tex-Mex joint which opened a couple of months ago in Kolkata is surely a crowd-puller. The ambience, the d√©cor, the service-none disappoint. The warmth and the friendliness of the people in the restaurant makes you feel quite at home. 

The food is definitely Mexican. I love everything deep fried, hot and spicy and so the food was an instant hit with me, the reason why I have already visited the place twice in this short span. The first time I visited I played it safe and went in for a Cajun Chicken Burger. A generous portion of a juicy and succulent chicken breast complimented with the melting Swiss cheese was definitely a break from the usual customized chicken burgers served at McDonald‚Äôs and KFC. But personally I thought it was just like any other home-made chicken burgers and nothing extra-ordinary but yeah again it is difficult to experiment with something as simple as a chicken burger. On my second visit I wanted to try the other mouth-watering food which I kept staring at on other people‚Äôs plate during my first visit and this time around I ordered in an appetizer. Triple Dipper consisting of battered fry chicken crispers, chicken wings and the Southwestern eggrolls came in such huge portions that two of us had a hard time clearing the plate. All the three items on the plate were a delight nevertheless and we kept on digging in into the three dips that were served-totally mouthwatering they were! Tripple dippers can be ideally shared among four people. If you are a couple visiting Chili‚Äôs then I would suggest order in a smaller appetizer which would leave some space in your stomach to try the rest of the food out there. For the mains we tried crispy honey-chipotle chicken crispers and country fried chicken. Both were mouthwatering. The sticky glaze on the chicken made with honey and chipotle sauce instantly gives a kick in the first go and then there is the potato mash and the finger fries to cut down on the sweetness. But the best part of these two dishes was the corn on the cob. Moist, juicy and brushed with butter, garlic and something sweet and tangy-(dying to know the secret sweet ingredient) was the one to die for. I could leave every other thing on the plate to have more of that corn. I however could not try the quintessential Mexican items like the fajitas and quesadillas. I also wanted to try the chocolate chip paradise pie to satisfy my sweet tooth but with the appetizer and the main I was quite full. They are booked for my next visit anyways. Chili‚Äôs menu offers so much variety that it is difficult to try different things in a single go. And that is why one needs to make multiple visits to this place. The place is quite reasonable considering  the amount and the variety of food that it offers. A sumptuous and overly filling two course meal at Chilli‚Äôs will roughly cost you Rs. 1500-1600 for two which also includes the bottomless soft drinks ÔÅä. Chilli‚Äôs is thus a must visit for all foodies. It is surely going to leave you happy and satisfied.

After a visit from a India's "vegetarian"  dominated state, I deprived of meat decided to land up in Chilli's with two friends.
The interiors are well done and has that cowboy feeling of Texas or Dallas.
Started of with lemonade and a new entr√©e Country fried calamari,with two dips.The starter was too good.
For main course chose tenderloin steaks(buffalo meat)...I chose mine with baked broccoli and rice..other had it with veggies and black beans.
At first the meat was moist with the butter and soft and crunchy.Full of bursting flavours and juices it was awesome.
Slowly the taste got bland and chewy and the portion is too much...so by the end it turns out to be a monotonous chewing process.
Staff is very efficient and well spoken.Overall good experience,

Two weeks back we visited Chilis at Quest Mall. We ordered triple dipper, a big Chicken Pizza, one mock tail and Choco shakes. Would like to review my first visit from diff aspects as below:

1. Food taste - Triple Dipper - Chicken Crispi‚Äôs were crunchy from outside but with soft chicken inside. My son really liked it. Rolls were OK type with nothing special to mention. Chicken wings were little over salted due to excessive bar-b-q sauce. I would probably like to see less sauce and a little more sweetness with some tang. Pizza was excellent with a load of chicken and toppings/cheese. I super liked it. Mock tail was really refreshing and my daughters favorite. Chocolate shake was full also a good one with a good amount of Choco chips inside.
Overall - from food quality and quantity standpoint it was good (4.5), whereas from taste stand point (though its kind of personal) I would give 3.5.

2. Ambiance - a refreshing live one, probably best suitable for young crowd. At times people like me was finding it a little loud. Their B'day celebration was excellent - as we witnessed one at the neighboring table; though my son was initially little scared with the loud singing.

3. Price -For a typical continental food, maintaining the quality, I would say it was OK. Not a deal but definitely not too expensive.

Awesome ambiance. You would love the LARGE portions (2 hungry ppl can easily share) of super tasty food and drinks. This place is value for money with  There are enough options for in VEG category too.

The drinks come in such huge glasses that they make you feel like a dwarf. Margarita (recommended) .
Chicken crispers --large pieces, crispy batter outside, moist inside. With corn cob, french fries and spicy dip. Fajita -- 8 cheesy pieces along with dip, rice and beans.
BBQ Salad -- Fresh lettuce, corn, peppers and a large pc of grilled chicken breast on top. And dressing on the side. Super fresh and full of zing.

Next time I am going to try the pastas, pizzas and their famous choco lava cake.

I am a big fan of classic American dining and have visited Chillis a lot during my US days. Hence I went with a lot of excitement and I was not at all dissapointed. The staff are extremely friendly and it was a pleasure interacting with them. Coming to the food now. I started with the triple dipper and it was great. The bbq percentage on the chicken wings was slightly more than needed and the wings looked to be of a poor chicken. More sizeable portion is needed. Next comes the bowl of chilli which was indeed tasty. The main course was beef steak and salmon. The beef was not very tender but tasty. However the mashed potatoes accompanying it was amazing. A word of advice for the salmon. Needs slightly more marination to remove the slight odor which may pur off certain diners. The rice accompanying it was wonderful. This was followed by brownie ice cream and cheesecake. The cheese cake is one of the best in Kolkata. A must try. Do visit if original American cuisine is something you are missing.

P.S. must try the lemonade

Edit after second visit - 
This time I had food from their Mexican section. Seems theirs American dishes are better. The Mexican food lacked Mexican flavors all together. The fajita was very bland and the guacamole dint taste of avocados at all, mostly garlic. The Tacos had to much lettuce. Overall not a great experience like the last time.

I visited Chili's on a Wednesday afternoon for some snacks in a group of 3. Nice ambience, nice view overlooking the city and a good place to chill out. 
We were told at our first attempt to order no chicken items will be available as chicken was out of stock. This was quite unexpected from a well known brand such as Chilli's.  Finally, we decided on a strawberry lemonade, a strawberry milkshake, fish n chips and a portion of big mouth burgers. Even my hindu friend ate Buffalo meat coaxing herself saying that  its ok as long as it is not beef, Lol. The food is presented very well here, the extra effort is much appreciated. 
The fish for the fish n chips in respect to taste was not upto the mark as it was made with Basa fish which I personally do not like as the meat of that fish does not contain much body, its not so meaty or tight like a Bhetki fish. It just melts in the mouth. The coating/batter was more firm that the fish itself. 
On the other hand the burgers were very good. The bread was fresh and tasty, the meat was juicy and well seasoned and prepared as per my liking. It suits perfectly with the sides of onion rings and French fries.
My request to management would be if they could provide some extra tissues as the staff were aware that we had used up the 3 that was provided to wipe the 1yr old baby with us who had splashed milkshake over himself but only gave us more when we had asked them. Then as consumers wont feel unhappy to pay the 10% service charge imposed on the bill.

Visited the place yesterday. . .
It is inside the newest mall (Quest Mall) in Kolkata. . .
and I really appreciate this place . .

Now lets come to a bit more details . .

1. The Decor : It's too good. . and Appropriate to the needs.. I've never seen Charging point to the tables before..

2. Service : That's also very good, and they maintain a well atmosphere. . But the table-in-charge was not much helpful . .

3. Food : They mainly serve continentals . .  and they are very much specialist to it.. 
                 I specially liked the "Baked Salmon" and ofcorse the "Mocktail Juicy Melon (I cannot remember the exact name right 
                 now)"

Ever since its has opened its doors for the calcuttans, I've been flooded with rave reviews from my friends & their parents & many more. Finally few days back, i got lucky. I went with a friend who has already tried half of veg. Options available. I ordered for cherry cola cooler which really took my breath away with its seeping cola flavor with cherry flavor here & there. One 5 cheese pizza which was so sumptuous that we overlooked that the base  was almost burnt. We enjoyed that taste though. It was a very juicy pizza. Then one mocktail which is currently off the record. A must for all chili's goers. The pacific blur margherita. It looks so cool & tastes so good you're bound to come again. Verdict: highly recommended.

This place will transport you to a foreign setting once you step your foot inside it.the music and the decor all adds to it.the food is really good.even though a little expensive but the entire experience is worth every penny spent.service is very efficient and quick.a recommended desert would be the molten brownie.overall,the place is a perfect Sunday afternoon hangout with friends or family.

Chili's is the best new restaurant that I have been to this year. Except the Strawberry lemonade(interesting fusion but mediocre taste) all the other food items were delicious.The Triple Dipper which is among the top three list of every other reviewer was interesting.The Southwestern Eggrolls were excellent and the chicken crispers and chicken wings were okayish.The Blackened fish was  a pleasant surprise.The fish fillet tasted lovely and the seasonal veggies were yummy.We had the Paradise Pie for desert which was exquisite to look at and delightful to taste!

The ambience was nice.We had our share of privacy and the decor was very Americanesque.The food came fast, the waiters were nice and friendly.We were thrilled when one of the tables was greeted by birthday wishes from Chili's staff!All in all it was a pleasing experience for me and my fellow companions and I can't wait to eat at Chili's again!

If you're looking for authentic Mexican food and are ready to spend than Chilli's is the place to be! Good food good ambience!
Pro-got that western feel, unlimited coke and Pepsi,spicy food.
Cons- not many but pocket pinch might hurt a few!
All in all 3.5
Worth visiting!

Chili‚Äôs ‚Äì Hawt but the climax was cold!

We were at the Quest Mall and I was not cognizant of the fact that a new outlet of Chili‚Äôs got unveiled there. I mean the CHILI‚ÄôS about which I caught a lot was in town! Yippee! It was searing outside so we decided to go to the Chili‚Äôs to taste their authentic Mexican, American cuisine. [And It was an obvious choice üòÅ]
Of course, this was my first visit to the Tex-Mex international restaurant chain‚Äôs Chili‚Äôs. It was a Sunday afternoon and unfortunately there was a line outside the eatery. As time passed by I became irked to enter the joint.At last we entered, I was thrilled and their cheerful and vibrant d√©cor made us feel calm and pleased. There was a mild music playing inside which was quite restful.

Now from the massive ranges of menu we nominated [We really made the waiters wait for hours though],
I) Crispy Honey Chipotle Chicken Crispers ‚Äì This was wickedly delicious. With the extra corn and homemade fries, this is pure Heaven!
II) Triple Dipper ‚Äì I heard a lot about Triple Dipper. But it was the sheer dissatisfaction of the day. Both the chicken wings and chicken crispers had a kind of stiff filling which made it difficult for us to consume it.The southwestern egg rolls were poor as well. Possibly something went wrong that day. I will try this dish again.
III) Blackened Fish - Excellent blend of flavors but just a bit salty for me.And
IV) Molten Chocolate Cake for Deserts ‚Äì The cake was soft and chocolate over it made it Yum!! Yum!!

Food was middling. So I would like to embrace it in both my Pros and Cons.

Pros¬†
The service
The homely feel we got from the waiters.
The d√©cor
The variety
Food
Expense
A great surprise if you are the Birthday boy/girl

Cons
Food (yes again)

TBH, the food portions were huge. I thought of trying of their other dishes to get a precise knowledge of their complete food section, but it wasn't possible that day because we were absolutely full. 

So I would certainly love to visit Chili‚Äôs again.I loved Chili‚Äôs, but the food i.e. the climax was average. So its 3.5/5 for today! Hope next time I‚Äôll be able to give it a flawless 5 on 5!

Recently went to Chili's and got blown over. If I put it simply.

Here is what we ordered. The Strawberry lemonade (Rs125) was fizzy, and hit all the right chords with a strong strawberry flavour. The Black berry iced tea (Rs. 125) was rich in flavour, but a tad too sweet, but made for a happy drink, nevertheless. Served in what looked like jumbo beer mugs, the quantity was more than what we had thought of. A good start, we kept gossiping about our lives.  The Triple dipper (Rs. 325) looked spectacular, the quantity was overwhelming. Named after three dips, Avocado-ranch, Cool ranch and Honey mustard, there were Southwestern egg rolls, a few Chicken wings, and three Chicken crispers.  The Southwestern egg rolls were crispy, the cheese inside was distinguishable every time you take a bite. The filling contained sweet corn and mashed veggies, both very well made. The Chicken wings had a tanned saucy look, which complimented well with the dips. The Chicken crisper, a bit oily was crisp and juicy inside with generous chicken fillings. 

The Baby back ribs half rack (Rs. 800) arrived even before we could finish off the dipper. The ribs looked glorious and gave out a very medieval essence. Served with seasonal vegetables like red capsicum and broccoli of our choice, and the Chili‚Äôs classic barbeque sauce made it look lustrous and full of colour. When you try to cut out a portion, you will notice the meat to be soft and delicate. It had a smoky flavor because of which the meat literally fell off the bone. Undoubtedly one of the best Baby ribs, I‚Äôve ever had. 

Finally, after much consideration we went for the Molten chocolate cake (Rs. 250) for desert, after the waiter‚Äôs recommendation. While we polished off the remaining of the food, we noticed that they had provided wash tissues with every dish. Nice touch. The Molten chocolate cake was crowned with solid chocolate. The moment you dig inside, a smoking hot chocolaty gooey liquid will start coming out and it filled up the plate. The moment we put the cake along with the ice cream and the hot chocolate inside, we noticed the smoothness and the subtleness of the cake. Heartwarming stuff, and the best way to possibly complete the meal, we felt.

I had heard so much about Chili's and me and my husband went to the restaurant at Quest Mall. It was maybe the the 2nd or 3rd day that it had opened and there was just 2 other tables that were taken. I was told that the Steak is not yet available. I ordered the Country Fried chicken and it was really good. the mashed potatoes were creamy and soft and the chicken was crispy and succulent.

i have been getting rave reviews of chili's from my friends who love to taste something different whenever they get a chance. being in the same boat, i headed for this newest restaurant in the newest mall in town, quest. since it was a sunday evening, initial wait time was long (40min+). this reminded me of those long queues at peter cat on weekend nights :)

after getting the table i jumped into the menu and was delighted with the assortment of food present in the list. we ordered -

chicken crispers (soft chicken strips fried like butter fry along with corn and honey mustard dip) - an easy appetizer. children would love it.
cajun chicken burger (grilled chicken breast in a burger with cheese) - this was for my son. he loved the french fries that came along :)
fajita chicken quesadillas (chicken in a toasted tortilla with sour cream and diced tomatos) - a must have if you like classical mexican food.
classic fajita chicken (grilled chicken with onion rings, sour cream) - very tender chicken. smoked.
beef steak - well, a classical steak but they use buffalo meat. i ordered medium-well done and it was just perfectly prepared.
pork ribs - well, again a classical ribs preparation. we ordered half rack and amount was good. came along with bbq sauce.

too bad they don't serve alcohol and a pint of beer was severely missed during the food. i hope they get alcohol license soon and i would be a regular at this restaurant for sure.

finally, i must mention the ambiance. it's lively. the decor is very much like a sports pub along with a restaurant where you can bring in your friends to enjoy your favorite sports program live along with a beer or two. also, the restaurant is well decorated with mild lights and classy linens. service was quick and courteous. price was on the higher side but the amount and quality is nothing to complain about.

overall - a BIG THUMBS UP for the chili's :)

Extremely Poor Experience ... There were three different servers who served the table,So Sarbani is not to blame, the Managers were busy chatting through the duration of our meal near the Billing/Computer, the Black T shirt guys, with some jazzy wireless head gear or something to stay tuned to what was up,The Food was absolutely disgusting, one thing on the menu descriptions and Images and another on the table, sad crumpled Burger buns, Too noisy and ineffective air-conditioning, Sad steak ... so sad it is not worth mentioning, all in all pathetic food ... and really pathetic ... for the Kolkata Crowd at a new Upmarket Mall, may be a great experience ... and Going to a new restaurant , but I went for the Food with my Family, Chilis is in my opinion maybe just one grade above McDonalds, or a McDonalds with wait Staff .... where a McDonalds would have better food and No Staff and you have noisy Music, Wait Staff and Pathetic Food ... a superbly Poor Pathetic experience .... never ever again .... also forgot to mention, the factor of having been Duped by the fact of its location as touted to be Kolkatas Premium Mall and the Final Upmarket Location with only Upmarket Eateries ... Both Lies ... and due to this absolute Pathetic experience, would probably never visit that mall Again ... this is a prime Example of False Advertising ...:( ... Basically a prime example of Junk Food ... in name and Quality ...

Went to this place to celebrate my friends birthday...after reading all the reviews I had really high expectations fromChili's.... We  ordered a Strawberry lemonade, Tenderloin and Blackened fish with shrimps...The person taking the order was putting on an accent and trying to push us in adding extras like they do in CCD.....The drink arrived first in a big beer glass and was good....Next arrived our food which looked so delicious.....they were in such big portions.....the fish was served with spinach and cherry tomatoes on a bed of rice....The first bit i had of my Blackened fish with shrimps was a big dissapointment...the fish had absolutely no salt in it and was absolutely tasteless...only when accompanied with the cream sauce it was edible....the shrimps were good but nothin to rave about....the spinach was also a big dissapointment...i myself have cooked spinach saute and grilled fish many a times....and trust me its the simplest of all food...whenever i was not in a mood to cook much i would do it....anyways my friends Tenderloin was quite ok...the brocolli they served with it was tasty and crispy....the Tenderloin was too much to finish by 1 single person alone....for dessert we had the molten lava cake which was again nothin extraordinary..a little too sweet for me.....as it was my friends bday they gave us a complimentry brownie with icecream and sang for her....that was really sweet of them...and trust me i found the brownie with icecream to be the best of all...when the bill arrived we saw that we were charged for blackened salmon instead of blackened fish...they charged us 550+200 Rupees extra for the shrimps whereas in the menu the blackened fish with shrimps came for Rs475(375+100). On being pointed out they hesitated a bit at first but then revised the bill and charged us for the blackened salmon only as we had consumed it without notifying them...well it was a bit stupid on my part too for not realising the difference...i did keep wondering what fish it was and the redness of the fish was also hard too miss....but the tastelessness turned me into a bimbo then i guess....
The waiters were really polite and kept asking about how was the food...i was really tempted to say that mine was tasteless...but i really could not say anything as they were being so nice....
All in all the ambience here is really great...i would love to go back for that but the food was actually a big dissapointment...i rslly dnt know whether it was

Finally something to cheer about for the Mexican food lovers of Kolkata..Chili's is here.Ambiance is fantastic and very lively..its almost like a different world inside.With lots of varieties to choose from,the menu is refreshing and very much authentic.Even there are lots of vegetarian options on the menu!Starters are excellent,especially the Calamari,and provided in large portions with tasty dipping sauces.The main course are as good as the starters.The desserts are few but different from what is generally  seen in other restaurants-typically Chili's!But the biggest disappointment for me were the tacos.Keeping that aside,the rest deserves a BIG thumbs up!

I visited this place 2 days back with my friend. Its on the 4th floor of quest mall. First things first THE FOOD IS EXCELLENT. We ordered the triple dipper combo(chicken and buffalo) and fajita quesadelas. The quantity was great and the taste even greater though i don't understand the rajma chawal they give with the fajitas. Anyway the pieces were succulent. There are downsides ofcourse.The waiters strangely kneel down to the floor to take your order and they dont serve water like the others. I had to order the strawberry lemonade and repeatedly ask for water.The jugs were huge. It cost me 1100/- and i consider that money well spent.

This is a meat lover's paradise. It's a really good place with friendly staff and delicious food. The ambience is great. I went there with a friend. We had long beach ice tea, which was really good , and I think it's the only place in Kolkata that served calamari rings. So we ordered that. And it was OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!  We even had the pepperoni pizza which was okay. One of their signature dishes, the blackened fish , is something you must try. The fish meat was soft and tender , and was served with rice , dip and veggies. So it was a wholesome meal. 
People , If you are craving fajitas, this is your place. The best one to try is the chicken chipotle fajita. It's really delicious. 
All in all , you will feel satisfied having visited chilis, and it's worth the Time and money you spent there.

Chili's, the popular American tex-mex joint finally makes it to Kolkata, and boy it packs in a lot of bang. Nestled inside the uber cool Quest Mall, the interiors are very nicely done with hues of red, which supposedly induces appetite. 
Coming to the amazing diner-style food, my girlfriend ordered the Philly cheese steak sandwich with Cherry Coke, while i settled for the Monterey Chicken and Chili's  Frappe to wash down it down with. To break it down into simpler terms, the Philly Cheese Steak sandwich is a 6-inch sandwich with generous portions of buffalo meat and exquisite sauces with french fries and the Monterey Chicken was a grilled chicken breast with bacon toppings smeared and barbecue sauce along with mashed potatoes and veggies. Food was delightfully good keeping up with true chili's tradition. The bacon was crisp and the chicken was nicely done though i would recommend the Oldtimer cheese burger. You also get a 150 bucks discount with your bill for your next visit to the place.
Tip: If its your birthday, you also get a complimentary cake from au bon pain just across the floor, and they also sing you a tailor-made birthday song making it a truly personal experience.

Had a hearty meal at chili's .. We went there for a weekend lunch and it was full. We had to wait for around 10 minutes. While waiting we were offered cold drinks .

The decor looked like that of a diner that we usually see in the movies. 

For starters we had fried calamari. We were having squids for the first time. It felt a bit chewy.  

For the mains we had half a rack of baby back ribs with classic barbecue sauce. Instead of mashed potatoes we chose seasonal veggies. It was really good. The meat was tender and easily went off the bones. 

Next we had the the classic fajita(chicken). I totally loved it. It was delicious and very filling.

Finally we ended it with cheesecake. It was heavenly. We also packed up some for home.

In all a very satisfying and fulfilling meal we had. I am definitely going back there to check out the other items in the menu.

I don't really like the concept of "server" which is the term they use to address a waiter...other than that, the restaurant is almost Kolkata's answer to Thank God Its Friday@Mumbai, the ambience is almost the same (read nice).. I tried out d fried squid and ran out of dip (read delicious), barb q ribs, strawberry lemonade (quite a favourite at the tables) and chipotle..the amount is huge for two people sharing and i ended up packing the rest of the food! 
I have now been to this place thrice and I m loving it..their fish n chips is the best in town (perfectly crispy outside, perfectly soft inside) and the fries are to die for! The BBQ salad is pretty decent, and the recently introduced mango margarita are henceforth my personal favourite! Somehow whenever we want something to eat at the quest mall's food court, we end up here :)
A nice way to end was the chocolate chip paradise pie, quite filling I must say..as long as someone else is paying for the treat (as in my case) you should not be bothered, else if u r still working your way with your pocket money, once a month dinner would not hurt much and the experience is classy :)

Are you a foodie?? Then Chilli's is the right place. Went with my colleagues. Triple dipper, calamari & crispy chicken tacos were just awesome... Tried Buffalo for the first time (grilled tenderloin steak) & loved it. Nice ambiance. Ended with molten chocolate cake & brownie sundae. Better than my expectation.

Chili's, being the much needed tex-mex restaurant in the city, has lived up to its expectation. The extensive menu, a very relaxing ambiance, good music, awesome food and good service sums up what Chili's is all about. 
The strawberry lemonade is highly recommended. The prawns in the jambalaya were so succulent that even a prawn-hater like me was impressed. The crisp onion rings, the molten lava cake and the chicken platter with 3 dips were really great.

For starters, they have done a brilliant job in putting something together this well in this cuisine, an area in which Kolkata certainly lacks . Also, since they are already an international brand, this restaurant maintains a very high standard. Interiors and the set up is perfect too. Coming to the food, I had pasta and had nothing to complain about. Unlimited cold drinks is an important welcome concept that they have brought in from the west. Overall, I am giving a thumbs up to Chili's. Hope they maintain the current ambiance and standards.

So I was scrolling through my list of reviews and I realised I still haven't written one for Chili's! Unbelievable! I absolutely love Tex-Mex and have savoured food at Chili's outlets all over the world. Quite naturally, I was delighted when it decided to hit Kolkata! 
I went there quite a while ago - in February. My companion had never eaten here before, so I decided to recommend my favourites and also experiment a little. We first ordered the bottomless soft drinks and a small bowl of Terlingua buffalo chili (neither of us had tasted buffalo before). The gravy was nice, but the meat was too heavy for me - probably because I avoid red meats usually. My friend ate up with relish, though! Then we ordered my favourite Chicken Crispers. They were long, golden and had that crunchy-softness of perfect fried chicken - as I expected! And their honey mustard beats everything. The corn on the cob served as a side was hot, juicy and everything corn should be. The whole plate was quite filling as an appetiser for the two of us! 
We then ordered the main dish - one chicken quesadilla to share, with corn on the side instead of rice. This is where my experience slipped down a little. The girl serving us was quite reluctant to let us have corn in place of rice (the usual side), and gave us quite disapproving frowns while taking the order. I don't see why. The quesadillas, when they came, were very good, but there were far too many onions. That's not what a Chili's quesadilla is like. Chicken, cheese and crispy tortilla - everything else should take a secondary position. So our bites had rather more onion than we preferred. Also, the corn this time was positively cold. We'd already bitten off most of it before properly realising this, so we saw no point in ordering another, but this shouldn't have happened. 
Everything was put right in the end, though, when we opted to share a cheesecake slice. Having become accustomed to the "cream-cheesiness" of most cheesecakes here, I was transported to heaven at the first bite. It was creamy, cakey, cheesy, crumbly, chewy, sweet, slightly tart...everything the ideal cheesecake should be! And the drizzle of strawberry sauce on top just added to the amazing flavour! No doubt about it, this is the best cheesecake I've ever had and the perfect ending to our meal.
When comparing Chili's Quest Mall with all the other Chili's outlets I've patronised, I have to say that it isn't doing too badly. There is some shoddiness in service and some of the items could be prepared better, but it definitely as the potential to become a true-blue Chili's. And come on, we both had a delicious, filling and immensely satisfying meal! That's what matters! 
And of course, will come back soon. It can only get better with time. :)

My friends at Delhi always had something nice to say about Chilis's (especially the burgers) and hence I was extremely happy when Quest hosted a branch! To add to my happiness, Chili's happened as a dinner treat! 
I was told that it is usually very crowded after 9 at night so we visited the place at around 8. The tables on the farthest end of the restaurant, from the entrance gives you a wonderful view of the road and city lights from up there. 

The order of drinks included a cold coffee, one fresh lime soda and one sprite. They serve the drinks in HUGE tumblers, which is a nice thing, however, all the drinks cost around the same range, which is weird. My friend loved the cold coffee but the fresh lime was little too sour. Drinking water seemed like an alien concept here.

The appetizer was triple dipper. The chicken crisper was just perfect! Soft and crisp! I have never had better chicken crisper in my life. The south-western egg rolls were disappointing. The chicken wings were pretty basic. Each one of the three sauces for dipping was wonderful! They together make this appetizer a super hit.

For main course we had the baby back ribs with classic BBQ sauce and mashed potatoes. It took a lot of explaining and more explaining the person who was serving us to finally make him understand the order. Partly it was our mistake because we gave away the menu card after ordering the appetizer but the person serving seemed a little confused with their own food. The food was perfectly smoked. The tender fibre of the buffalo meat was nicely flavoured. The three of us could not finish the full rack that was ordered. 

Lastly, the cheesecake wrapped up our dinner. The cake was soft and nicely made. I am extremely happy with Chili's. Although I would have liked it more if there was lesser confusion with food ordering and option of being offered the drinking water without having to ask for it. But the food truly took my heart away. 

Next time I would definitely try the more of their desserts and fajitas. And the pink drink that I saw the man at the other table sipping  : D

Right! Been there. Came back wanting for more.
This place spells America like only Americans can...in Kolkata..!
The ambiance is inviting, young, energetic and the place is huge. You enter and notice the bar area with a hint of lounge lights and you're in for a knock out. Sit there when you are with friends, in their dining space when with family.
The service is super.
The waiters make you feel at home. They ideally 'wait' for you to decide whats perfect for you. They might perch themselves on the ground at the edge of the table to hear you better. Dont get startled. :D
If it is you're birthday, you're in for a surprise too.
The food - lipsmacking! 
You want to eat more but your stomach gives in. Those heavenly chicken crispers, the bar b qued wings, the boulder mugs brimming with exotic taste of cherry cola or strawberry mint, those huge double deckered burgers and...to top it all off..the mouth watering, smooth cheesecake! 

The portions are large, the music young...you dont need any more than that to be transported to a diffrent world.

Some may say that Chili's is not one of the best America has to offer...well then I am earnestly looking for the best they are indeed going to bring to my plate..! If this is only the beginning, it looked like a grand one to me!

Had heard a lot about Chili's, and finally got the opportunity to visit it. Situated in the premium mall of Kolkata, Quest, its a nice diner. We went there on Thursday afternoon and was surprised to find it almost full! The waiters were very courteous and well mannered. It was really hot that day, and we ordered a cherry cola, which was surprisingly good and refreshing. I had heard a lot about the baby back pork ribs, and ordered it in the original bbq sauce. It was amazing, soft and tender and cooked to perfection. Then we ordered the combo Fajitas, consisting of chicken and buffalo loin. The quantity was huge and taste superb! On the whole a very nice place for tex-mex and a welcome addition to Kolkata's list of International diners.

Chili's is a nice restaurant at the Quest mall in ballygunge. I had heard reviews Chili's being very good, and got to taste it two months ago. First of all, When you enter the place, You sense a vibe of friendliness. the waiters are the highlight of this . They are very helpful, and are extremely responsive. Now, on to the food. Chili's serves up huge tumblers of drinks,so be careful what you wish for. It took me more than half an hour to gulp down my ice tea,plus, they refill,should you need more,which i doubt you will. the food is beyond good. The calamari is just heavenly, with the squid being tender and juicy,accompanied by two delicious dips. The platter of assorted fried goods was another blessing . It had a bit of everything and should suffice as a starter to a family of four or three . the chicken was tender and delicious,with strips of carrot and celery donning an already filled plate. the Black Basa fry with rice is just indescribable in terms of flavor. The Pork ribs fall right off the bone, and just makes you wanting more. the Desserts are,HUGE . the cheesecake would easily suffice for two people, and i am a man of big appetite, so that says something. Overall, Chili's is expensive, But for the food it serves, one does not feel they are paying a lot. The ambiance and the food,combined, gets a big thumbs up from me.

I've been to Chili's a coupke of times in the last month. Parking at Quest Mall is a breeze and Chillis is definitely good value for money. The calamari, blackened salmon, tenderloin are all high on my priority list. Clearly Chilli's serves the best burgers in town and are a refreshing change from the processed burgers available at McDonald's which fail to impress especially if you are a regular visitor. The bottomless coke is as appealing as it gets especially if calories are not your concern.

chili's is to die for!! loved the place. the ambiance is amazing. the food is simply mind blowing. we ordered for starters a plate of triple dipper and my! i was surprised. the southwestern egg rolls very amazing. so was the chicken crispers. on the other hand the chicken wings were ordinary. for main course we had big mouth bites and grilled tenderloin. they use Buffalo tenderloin though i would have preferred  beef. it was just perfect. we had ordered it to be well done and it was perfect. what i found amazing was their beverages. we ordered cherry cola and i'm still craving for it. even the blackberry iced tea was amazing. 

they should mention that the quantity of each plate was huge. unfortunately, we wasted a lot of food. 

will definitely keep visiting this superb joint

Me and my friends were dying to go since it has opened, but we got the chance to go there finally on last Friday.
Before going, obviously, we checked out zomato :P The site which is a great place for checking out restaurants. But we were a bit disappointed with their reviews, where people called the food average- albeit they compared it with abroad food, anyhow we decided to tone down our enthusiasm and went anyhow.
The moment we were inside the Mall, I was salivating (figuratively of course), and all our enthusiasm peaked once we were right outside Chili's.
We entered the shop, the woman who seated us was very courteous. The moment we were given the Menu card, we forgot everything and started scanning through the menu. Everything sounded amazing and luxurious, like we were sitting in a Chili's in USA. From the Tex-Mex menu, we decided to first dig right into the mains, 
MUSHROOM JACK FAJITA. It was PURE BLISS. The chicken was so tender, the sour cream, the mushroom, the guacamole, the Jack cheese, everything together created magic in my mouth and it was just amazing. 
People who said Chili's were comparing, but for us kolkatans, this is just simply Tex-Mex, and we have nothing to compare it with. Definitely a go to place to try new things.
For drinks, we ordered a Cherry Cola, that was a really bubblegum-ey refreshing drink, which you must try when you visit Chili's.
We also ordered Monterey Chicken and Chicken Wings, which were pretty good, but couldn't compare it with  the Fajita we had just had.. Btw, instead of eating buckets at KFC, I would suggest you all to save and spend it here. Its definitely wort it.
Oh did I mention, All the food had Huge portion. Especially the fajita. Or maybe it was coz I have a small appetite, either way, 1 fajita I think two people could share..
We were there to splurge, so had enough at hand, but when the bill came we were shocked!
It was much less than we had expected and we were all just astounded. Either way, I guess 4 girls with small appetite wouldn't spend much anyhow, I suggest you take enough money in case you eat too much.
I would definitely be going for few more visits to try out the NACHOS-which looked amazing in the menu, but my friends were against having veg, so I'll go again with some other people..
And definitely the BURGER, they looked huuge. So maybe I wont eat breakfast when I go eat it :P

Anyway that's all.
Adios

I finally had to pay a visit to the much talked about restaurant Chili's. The placed looked nice and the menu looked very appealing. To my disappointment, the food did not meet my expectation. We had visited the outlet at 4pm on Sunday, the hostess at the lobby was quiet friendly and helped us get a sofa seat, the ambiance was good, the smell of the food made me and my friends drool. The tripple dipper what we had ordered was quiet appetizing, the cajun turkey sandwich tasted similar to a Subway turkey sandwhic i feel it could have been better, the pizza we ordered was really yumm, so was the molten chocolate cake but the iced tea tasted horribly bitter. When we asked our server Zubair to replace the drink i guess all he did was added extra ice in it. Coming to the service part of the of the, I would have to rate it 4.5/10, the server was busy talking to his colleagues all the time, we literally had to call him on top of r voices for extra paper napkins or even to place a new order, all he did was face his back towards the table. Though the restaurant was at its peak hour, its still does not serve as an excuse.  All in all was good experience, worth visiting especially if your out with friends, but to go there with out expectations would be the better. 
Chili's surely needs to improve the food taste to gain die hard fans.

I really liked the ambiance of the place...an ideal place for chilling out with the gang. In terms of food I have mixed feelings. The quesadillas and pasta were not up to the mark although I was totally won over by the burgers, unique drinks, fried chicken and desserts. A place which will be much appreciated by youth. So my advice to you is try it out!

If you've been to a Chili's abroad, this one in the Quest mall can be given a wide, very wide berth. Possibly since we'd gone there around 12.30, we had to wait for 20 minutes outside and then again inside, but since we were looking forward to replicating our Chili's experience we thought it would be worth it. Imagine then our disappointment when our order was served. We had ordered Country-fried chicken and Blackened salmon. To say that it did not match the picture, nor the taste we had in mind, nor the size of the portion is saying less. It was totally tasteless, inadequate and neither aesthetically served nor robust as Tex-Mex-Italian is supposed to be...The iced tea and lemonade were good, though there were no refills. The dessert suggested, Chocolate chip paradise pie, was good but it did not quite take away the unhappy aftertaste the meal left.

Lovely ambience and service with a smile..chili's is the perfect place for a nice laid back meal with friends and family.
The only problem I found with my food was that I had asked for a medium rare steak and they made it well done, they also have me a wrong selection of sides.
The desserts are to absolutely to die for
All in all a very nice place

All I can say is that you won't get disappointed if you are a foodie. Although we didn't get much the options in the veg section but still it makes me feel good with the overall ambience and yes the food surely. So with chilli's yes its a bit overpriced for the people who are accustomed to Mcdonalds's and kfc's but with the taste I would say they are Worthy.

Ok, finally I went to quest mall and only reason is Chilli's. I was so much expecting from this new american-Mexican chain, but, unfortunately I was disheartened. The place is nice, descent lighting and interiors, very charming view, friendly and helpful staff, a very good and mouth watering menu. But, the main, the taste, it lacks a lot. Although, Chilli's is not a very famous brand in united states either like applebee, red lobster, cheesecake factory or olive garden. They are mostly the grade B class chain. But, as per standard, they are far better there than in Park circus highs. I am not blaming the restaurant or staff, they all were really good and tried their best to make us happy, but, the food was really better if not mentioned in detail. but, I have to............... We ordered a cripsy chicken taco (crispy fried chicken) with guacamole, cheese poppers and grilled salmon alongwith strawberry lemonade and a cheesecake as dessert. We also packed half rack pork ribs (baby back) in BBQ sauce and a tenderloin patty burger. One by one............ The tacos were just okay, but we have had much better tacos in this town (Amigos tex mex), the rice they have served with both tacos and fish was not very tasty either, the chilli served with the tacos (red beans) was good though. The salmon was really nice, wonderfully marinated and grilled and was very tasty. The cheese poppers were simply yucky, too much salty, and the chedder inside tasted like very old and frozen, I guess they left the poppers frozen for more than its shelf life and maybe did several times freeze thaw. It was terrible. The pork ribs were good, very nicely cooked to perfection and simply melted in my mouth, though the bbq sauce used as marinade was not as tasty as their US sibling. The ternderloin patty was good too and portion wise both the pork and beef were huge. Though, in US standard they may be small portions. The cheesecake was good but not the best in town. The lemonade was good too. As a whole, you may be happy if you go there without expectation, but, if you are dreaming of a tangy tasty huge American-Mexican dinner, you may be disappointed like me. Still, worth visiting.

Chili's sits pretty on the top floor of Quest Mall. The decor looks inviting and for the first time i got the diner-feel it intended to provide. Although the place was crowded like anything, we did not have to wait and got our seats on the bar stool. The weird part was sitting there and not being served alcohol, the license they assured they will get soon. Nevertheless we tried the flavored Iced Teas with fried calamari, the latter came perfectly crisp and enough for 3 people. Next we wanted the baby pork ribs, which are extremely popular. Among the 3 of us, 2 already had a Chili's diner experience abroad and could not wait to try the ribs. For me this was definitely the 1st Chili's experience. Yet the ribs in BBQ sauce did not overwhelm me exactly and my two food-partners were disappointed. The meat however was well cooked with nice smoky texture. Maybe next time we can try a different sauce. Next we tried the pizza which was quite decent. Overall it is a nice hangout and i will surely drop in again to try the rest of the menu. But with the high mall taxes on an otherwise decently-priced menu, they surely need to uplift the taste factor a notch higher in order to gain more Chili's - loyals.

Always been a fan of this place..so decided to visit chili's when it opened up in kolkata. Firstly, make a reservation..whether its a weekday or a weekend, its always crowded! Ive been there twice. The first experience wasnt too good. They did not have the tenderloin steak neither did they have the fajitas. So we decided to go for the pork ribs..it was a big disappointment. The meat was just ok and the barbeque sauce tasted a little weird. We asked for the mini burgers only to realise that the bacon was missing. Not a very good first experience. 
But we decided to give it another try. This time we tried the fajitas and the bacon burger. The burger was excellent and the fajitas were good too. The service is also pretty quick and good.

Blackened Salmon , Smoky Chipotle Chicken Fajitas ,Triple Dipper,Grilled Tenderloin Steak - they are all i have an idea about and i can assure you all are MIND-BOGGLING . And the portions served is Huge ...
Sweet Endings are something that people don't talk much about but i feel the Cheesecake & Molten Chocolate Cake is worth a try.

I went there with a friend and thought that since there was so much hype about the place. The hostess was polite and well mannered and the first impression was good. Ordered beef steak with hash brown, the beef steak was well done and the hash brown was disappointing, it was not mashed properly and seemed lumpy and tasteless.

The waiters still need a lot of orientation to understand the customer. After several repetitions and a fake accent he managed to get the order name right. A overall good experience on the whole. I would definitely recommend the tenderloin steak and the portion size was excellent. It left me full, so had no place to order deserts.

Wife and I visited this restaurant yesterday after a strong recommendation from a friend. I had happened to notice this place the last time I visited the newly opened mall at Beckbagan, "Quest". However, at that time, it wasn't lunch or dinner time, so my gastric juices didn't tempt me enough to consider visiting "Chili's" :) However, yesterday when we decided that we needed to check out a new restaurant in the city, or one which we hadn't visited before...we unanimously zeroed in on"Chili's".

The first thing which pleases you about "Chili's" is the warm and welcoming nature of the staff, right from the person opening the doors, to the waiters you happen to walk by, to the man at the drinks counter, to the person allotting you a table. Everyone is full of smiles and greetings, and all this comes across to you as very genuine, and not plasticky! Basically, everyone genuinely appears happy to have you as a guest. I understand that this is also a part of the staff training...but at least they do it well, and don't make things look like artificial and forced greetings. These are gestures which don't necessarily cost anyone anything, yet they can leave a lasting impression on the guests mind. However, unfortunately, this is something we see less of in most restaurants across the city nowadays.

Continuing with the above observation, I liked the way the staff sits down at your level, when taking your order. Another small gesture, but it adds to the warmth. Probably someone who runs the show at "Chili's", had given it a thought and figured that a standing staff taking the order from seated guests, either looks intimidating, or simply causes neck pain to the guest while he/she has to look up and place the order ;)

I've hardly been to any restaurants serving Mexican, American and Italian dishes. Moreover, my knowledge is limited on their cuisine. But I was in for a pleasant surprise, and up comes the menu card to the rescue, full of stunning photographs of almost all the dishes. There have been countless occasions during many a restaurant visit in the past, where I've noticed that they go to extreme lengths to describe the dish in the choicest of words...yet I'm sure that like me, many a reader of the menu is at a loss of what to finally expect. But when you have lovely photos accompanying the item description, at least you get an idea of what is coming. Aside from that, these photos manage to do something magical.....they begin to stimulate your taste buds long before your food reaches the table ;)

Now coming to the food...

We were two, and the person taking our order was kind enough to make us aware that the servings were very large, and that a single serving was more than enough for 2 people. Since this was my first visit here, I ordered the dishes which have been spoken about at length on Zomato, and which even my friend (who recommended this place to us) had suggested. And even though the photographs on the menu card tempted me strongly to place more orders, I refrained from doing so.

Our orders were as follows...

1. Triple Dipper;
2. Fajita Quesadillas;
3. Cherry Coca Cola.

The Triple Dipper was in itself liberal in quantity. "Triple", because it had Chicken Crispers, Chicken Wings, and Southwestern Eggrolls...and 3 sauces too. A few large slices of carrot were added too. And each and every one of these were not only very different from the other, but delicious and filling too. I use the word "filling" here, as this single dish is enough to fill a single persons tummy to the brim. But sometimes when the food is this yummy, we greedy humans manage to over-eat, and devour the next dish as well ;)

I chose the "Combo" version of Fajita Quesadillas, which basically meant that it would have a mixed filling of chicken and steak. Not only did i not know how to pronounce the name of this dish beginning with the letter "Q" (I presume it's a Mexican name)...but I also didn't know how this would eventually look (the photos were there, but I was still slightly confused). When it finally arrived at the table, it was arranged as a longitudinal stack, placed on a long and narrow plate. This dish is part pizza, part roti and part sandwich! However, it was pretty tasty too. Honestly speaking, it did taste a lot like a pizza full of chicken and cheese...but packaged very differently. I don't know why, but I was expecting something more from this Fajita Quesadillas...maybe I wasn't entirely satisfied because it tasted so much like sliced pieces of pizza. But let me point out once again, it tasted great. The accompanying beans were tasty too. I didn't have the rice. And I couldn't figure out why that chunk of cream was there, and what to have it with!

The irony of the moment was, though we had only ordered a single plate of Triple Dipper, and a single plate of Fajita Quesadillas, and both the dishes were very tasty, and we both were very hungry to begin with, yet the two of us struggled big time, to finish the plate of Fajitas. Such is the quantity they serve. So please place your orders slowly, and steadily, instead of placing a huge order all at once. Nothing hurts more than seeing such beautifully prepared food being wasted :)

The Cherry Coca Cola was interestingly nice. Nothing path-breaking, but a simple case of cherry syrup being mixed in Coca Cola, and served in a beer mug :) I liked it.

Thankfully, we managed to finish our entire order, and were left burping and slightly bloated due to the overeating we did. We were thanking our lucky stars that we didn't go overboard, and order more dishes. 

Talking of "overeating", I'd like to mention another tiny detail which might be useful to some readers, while others may choose to ignore this. Though I am a foodie, and love to eat different foods from around the world, I also make it a point to stay fit and healthy. I basically balance things out. Neither do I abstain from enjoying the delicacies of the restaurants across the city, and neither do I gorge and gorge on food, day in and day out. The fact that I'm a doctor doesn't really have anything to do with my efforts to remain healthy...instead, I look at it in this way...if I am to continue enjoying the delicacies of the various restaurants across the city, and the world...I can only do that if I remain healthy and fit. An obese person, or a person with diabetes, or hypertension, or raised cholesterol, or cardiac problems, will never be able to eat what he/ she wants, to their hearts content. So do what you need to do to remain fit. Either eat a lot and exercise even more, or after a very heavy meal and stint of eating out...make sure your next meal is a very light one.

Continuing with the above topic of health which I have raised, and since many people these days are conscious about whether the food they're eating is healthy or not, I shall take the liberty to classify my orders at "Chili's" as healthy or unhealthy, without getting into too many technical details.....

a) Triple Dipper...more or less healthy. A lot of meat protein, not too oily, not too spicy. Don't consume too much of those mayonnaise based sauces, if you're concerned about health.
b) Fajita Quesadillas...pretty unhealthy. Think pizza, and you'll know what I mean...lots of cheese, some mayonnaise, and thus, lots of carbohydrates. The beans seemed to be the healthy part of this dish :)
c) Cherry Coca Cola...just as unhealthy as any aerated soft drink, with some more sugar added to it, in the form of cherry syrup.

Before I conclude, allow me to mention the biggest "tragedy" of the day. The fact that I was unable to try out three more dishes I was salivating over (simply by seeing the photos on the menu card). They were as follows.....
Grilled Tenderloin Steak;
Baby Back Ribs;
Cheesecake.

In fact I am still salivating over those images on the menu card, but my stomach simply disallowed me from trying out anything further. So my readers now know what I'll be trying next, when I visit "Chili's" again :) And I suspect that I'll be there very soon.

NOT A PLACE FOR VEGETARIANS!! DONT EVEN BOTHER TRYING....

My first to chilis in Kolkata but I've had their food around the world before. I was there for dinner today and I couldn't be more disappointed!

We ordered 
**classic jalapeno nachos: serving was way too small. Nachos were stale and too thin. Too much cheese in comparison. Exactly one jalape√±o slice for each nacho. Acceptable if not exactly palatable.
**Veg jalape√±o burger: bland soya patty. Mayonnaise had the consistency of water. No veges in the burger. No dressing. Generally tasteless!
**Veg fajitas: the vegetables were stone cold(supposed to be a vege sizzler). The chili served looked more like ghar ka saltless rajma. Consisted mainly of diced tomatoes- no peppers beans corn or broccoli. Very little Mexican rice to go with it. Mexican food is known to be spicy/hot... Not bland and unappetizing. Three very thin very small tortillas for an overpriced dish.

By this point we were sick of the bad food and to fill our stomach we called for 
**Pasta AlFredo: I really don't know how you can go wrong with something as basic as red sauce and pasta?! I know lil kids who make it better! The penne was barely boiled, the sauce had no flavor whatsoever. we barely touched it.

Needless to say we left the restaurant with empty stomachs and wallets. The staff was actually useless since they kept making excuses rather than address the issues at hand. BTW it takes 20 minutes of haggling to even get the cheque here so go prepared! 
I wonder if its the kolkata Chilis is actually associated with the international brand at all now!!

To all the vegetarians out there... Don't even bother entering chilis! Horrible food, unhelpful staff, overpriced menu, and major cost cutting on the managements part! ( they can't even provide hienz ketchup-- it's del monte here)

Sitting in Calcutta do you secretly wish to have an American style dining experience? Then, flash that 1000 watt smile because experiencing American 'style' dining is now possible with Chilli's creating quite a buzz for all the good reasons. But if you are venturing for lunch or dinner, then build up your hunger because certain dishes serve up huge quantity. 

Just with your first step inside you know what you are in for, the vibe it exudes is oh so American! Luckily we found the best table for ourselves with the glass wall on one side overlooking the entire city. I was enthralled to see servers coming up to you just to ensure whether you are comfortably seated or not! Who does that today in any of the recent restaurants.? Now that my excitement was sky high already I thought I better tame myself down to place my order. 

A quick glance through at the menu just to brief myself on what do they have in offer and yet again (like it happens to me all the time) I was spoilt for choice. And that's when I promised myself that I shall try something new since I can be rest assured about the quality and taste to be a delight. 

We settled for Fajita Trio with Salsa and Tortillas along with Blackened Salmon. We also craved for the Tripple Dipper but no matter now much we unleash the glutton inside us, managing three dishes was way beyond us. The Blackberry Iced Tea was quite the refresher to keep us soothing throughout our meal. And dare I forget to mention about the huge mug in which they served us our drink, thank god we settled for just one of them!

Well, now let's talk about the taste because that is what matters. I have never had Salmon before so was pretty excited about my dish, the fish was soft and tasted a lot like betki and bassa. But the smoky aroma of the grill kept the outer layer hot and crispy but it was soft and juicy inside. What's more? The taste of the fish got complimented to perfection with the tangy sour sauce that stood right in the middle of the dish. The fistful of rice had a mild taste to go down well with the lightly grilled fish. All you need to do is close your eyes, a spoonful of rice in your mouth, then let the fish caress gently on the small bowl of sauce and stuff it in your mouth and get lost in its taste. Trust me, it is pure ecstasy.

The Fajita Trio had chunks of beef, chicken and scraps of shrimps thrown around the palate. There were four kinds of salsa and the taste of all of them kept me wow. Well, the idea was to stuff the tortilla with chunks of meat, salads and the dips but who wants to concoct and mar the taste of meat by stuffing it all together? So I decided to wash down the soft and fluffy tortillas with all the dips first and then attack on the meat. Having done that first, the glutton inside us tore apart the shackles of table manners and etiquette to have the meat. The chunks of chicken were mild on the spices which actually upped the taste but somehow, I felt the beef was a bit drab and too mild for my liking. But if you wish to have your meal slowly to savor the taste, then a word of caution, because the beef gets a tad bit chewy when cold. The shrimps were extremely succulent with a hint of spice playing peek-a-boo with your taste buds. 

After having such a jaw-dropping meal I had no appetite left for dessert. So yup, I'm definitely coming back here to try out the other dishes and to do justice to my sweet tooth.

Having opened for the first time in Kolkata,Chili's which is a popular brand in other metropolitan cities of India was bound to be a hit here and it sure has been.Situated in Quest mall Chili's has already become a very popular choice.And for good reason too.

I had visited with a friend quite a few days back for a quick meal.We were immediately greeted warmly and taken to our tables.The ambience is nice and casual and lively.The staff are very friendly and helpful.

I was in the mood for the Tenderloin Steak but was disappointed to hear that it was not available.We settled for the BBQ Ranch Burger and the Classic Chicken Fajita.The food turned out to be as delicious and tempting as the menu card actually was!!
The BBQ Ranch Burger was an absolute delight for anybody who likes Burgers.It was meaty and fresh,cooked to perfection.The amount of the sauce was just right.Overall it was one of the best burgers I have had in Kolkata and it more or less compensated for my disappointment at not getting to have the Tenderloin Steak.
The Classic Chicken Fajita was also extremely well cooked.The accompanying tortillas were super fresh and soft.The Sauce was also delicious.
We were really satisfied with the meal.The quantity of the food was also impressive.Although we were not very hungry,still we had no place left foe desserts.The prices are slightly high but that is expected from a popular establishment and the food is quite worth the price actually.

Overall this is an excellent place for a quick meal,for a family dinner,for a friend's get together.It's popularity is certainly quite justified.I will surely be back to enjoy the other sumptuous items on offer.
Enjoy!! :)

Went to Chili's this weekend with 3 friends for a treat and let me just tell you the experience was awesome and lives up to all the hype and high expectations. 
We were greeted nicely and were taken to our little booth. The decor was very western/american. Full marks for that! Just like everything american, the menu was big, fat and extensive. 
We ordered one Triple dipper and one portion of classic nachos with fajita chicken for appetisers and strawberry lemonade and cherry cola. The starter came very quickly and we were also quick to attack them. My god! that was as good as it can get. Triple dipper waa the showstopper.  I would have liked the cheese on the nachos to be a little melted but never mind. The drinks were good, specially the strawberry lemonade. 
Then we ordered one of cajun chicken burger, chicken ranch burger, crispy chicken tacos, Chipotle chicken pasta. I can just  go on and on praising them but none is enough. My burger was soft juicy and the fries were good too.
Finally we ordered one cheese cake and a molten chocolate cake. The cheese cake was the best I had.
Overall a satisfying experience.

So this is my second visit to Chili's, the first at Kolkata's one, which is situated in the Quest mall. Having been to the Hyderabad Chili's I had been floored by the concept, the mood, the ambiance everything and my standards were definitely sky high from this experience. 

On entry, we were immediately seated, I found the waiters to be courteous enough but a little inattentive. This place does not serve water, which needs to be bought separately [Bummer #1]. On the flipside, the soft drinks menu is awesome. I ordered the Strawberry Lemonade which was tangy, fresh, had strawberry pulp and the right amount of fizz to make it a great accompaniment to the TexMex Cuisine served here. My friend ordered the bottomless coke, but sadly enough the first serving is so huge, one really does not need to reach for the second helping. :)

So coming to the important part of alcohol, c'mon Chili's!! No beer to go with the calamari? *sucks* [Bummer #2] And this one is a real bummer as Chili's in other parts of the country are well know for their cocktails! 

We ordered a classic chicken fajita and a Orleans Jambalaya. I had high hopes for the jambalaya as Paella is a favorite of mine, and as a lot of people would know, Jambalaya is like a cousin to it. The dish when brought to the table looked delish, with the right amount of prawns on top and diced chicken (bacon lovers get that too in this dish, i asked for it to be removed- so customisation is possible- thumbs up). The taste was good, springy chicken bits mixed with rice and corn...a lil salty and sour, with generous doses of pepper. However Bummer #4 was that the dish came semi-cold to the table, which is unforgivable in my book. I could not enjoy the dish as much as I would have had it been warmed up a bit more. My friend's fajita was sizzling, the chicken bits were juicy and tender, the veggies however had been singed but I did not mind. The quantity of food provided per plate is ample if not a bit too much for people with an average appetite!


The ambiance is good, it is situated in a prime zone of the mall, on the same floor as the food court. The insides are very neat and clean with an open view out on the city skyline, which becomes very soothing after dusk. The lighting inside is ample and not too harsh. Lots of TVs provided for those who are ardent Football/Cricket/Hockey (!) fans.

Overall, a must try place. Go for the squid calamari, that's always going to be a staple order of mine there. Hopefully, the liquor license will pop up soon enough for me to revisit.

A note to the management- Please ask the servers to NOT kneel while taking orders, its highly uncomfortable for them and for us too, especially when women are wearing skirts! There is absolute no logic for them to kneel...and this is a practice I am seeing only in the Calcutta outlet, so its not a chain-wide policy...Chili's, please rethink?

After working in the Park Circus slums in the morning, we were dead tired and extremely hungry. And all we could think of then for LUNCH was Chili's. This was a treat from an amazing trio from Malaysia who had come to visit India for the first time. The ambiance was really nice and quite relaxing. The service was attentive. 
For snacks, we ordered cheese poppers, nachos and fried calamaris. The nachos with the cheese were really great. I loved the calamaris with the dip.  For beverages, we had coke and strawberry lemonade which came in huge glasses. The lemonade was what I love. 

For the main course, I had an Orleans Jambalaya, a mixture of prawn and bacon with rice. The flavour was different , spicy and tangy. The prawns were cooked to the perfection. The portions were huge. I alone finished the whole plate. (Yes we were that hungry.) I also tasted the blackened salmon which my friend had ordered. The salmon was soft and succulent. 

We did not have any room for desserts but still we wanted to try the cheesecake after looking at the irresistible picture in the menu. :P And it was totally worth it. After my homemade cheesecake, I guess this is by far the best cheesecake I ever had. The molten chocolate cake was SINFUL. All of us attacked on one plate of this sinful dessert. Within a few minutes, the plate was clean by the six of us. 

I am definitely coming back here for Jambalaya and going to try new things from the menu. :)

Planning to visit Chili's for quite sometime now, I manipulated my friend's bachelorette dinner to be given here last week. The onus was on me to make sure everyone have had a nice time, and I feel absolutely wunderbar, thanks to the chic, casual ambience, finger licking food and pleasant service. We visited Chili's at around 7.30 and being a Thursday, was lucky enough to get a seat immediately. When we left at about 10, the place was bustling with hungry people gorging on fajitas, nachos, burgers, salads and tripple dippers.

Our orders - Triple dipper, classic fajita combo, Texas cheese fries for starters, baby pork ribs (half) as main course, cheesecake, molten chocolate cake and chocolate chip paradise pie for desserts, and strawberry lemonade, cherry cola, blackcurrant and peach iced tea for washing down all the gulps.

The drinks were so good and huge. I generally stick to iced tea, but I had to try the strawberry lemonade here. It was a right balance of strawberry flavour and fizz, making it delectable. One sip and you are bound to go back to your mug every second. Anyone who like strawberries must and should try it. I tasted the blackcurrant iced tea, and fell for it. The flavour, the light tanginess made it a cool, casual, happy summer drink. The peach iced tea was ordinary and the cherry cola quite interesting. The flavour from the cherry cola kept on reminding me of kala khatta to a large extent. 

Much has already been said about the triple dipper. I would just keep it to good. BLOODY GOOD. The ranch dressing is a killer, the dish super cost effective and a MUST order every time at Chili's for me. The fajita was an experiment for all of us and we went on with our gut feeling to arrange the chicken, shrimp, sour cream, lettuce, onions and the other extras on the side quite haphazardly inside the tortillas. The tortilla was soft and I liked the way they served it separately inside a hot case to retain the warm, moist softness of the flour. It was simple, tasty, none of the ingredients overpowering the other, and light. Fajitas practically taste like comfort food and tasted brilliant with my order of strawberry lemonade. The Texas cheese fries had opulent amount of cheese and jalapenos, and was served with a tasty dip. The cheesy fries got a little tiring after a point of time and we had to even fore-go a few fries. The sogginess of the fries from the cheese killed the taste. I am definitely not ordering these anymore ever again. 

I empathise with the 'I want my baby back ribs' feeling because I practically persuaded all on the table for the order. And we all were glad for it is definitely one of the best quality pork I have had till date in Kolkata. We went for the honey chipotle sauce for the grill with classic bbq sauce by the side. One of us amongst us wanted to avoid the grill spicy, so I steered strictly away from the sweet chilly glaze. I plan to try it next time now. The half ribs that we ordered was sufficiently big and will suffice one hungry person without any other order. The mashed potatoes on the side was no wonder good, but what stole my heart was the softness of the ribs. One cut, and the meat fell off the bones. It was just a step away from being mashed practically, yet the meat was crisp. It did not taste flaccid. The grill was just right in its tenderness and taste. 

We were already full, really full but took on the desserts with expectant eyes and beating hearts. The cheesecake was extremely dry and ordinary. I really did not like it, was much blah. The molten chocolate cake base was decent. I would have expected it to be more gooey and less spongy, but that is probably because I love my desserts sticky and thick. Others on the table loved this dessert and had a sinful time scraping and licking the oozing chocolate with the vanilla ice cream. My takeaway from the desserts have to be the paradise pie. It was oh my god! OH MY GOD! The hot fudge and caramel was gooey and sticky, the exact aspect I spoke of in my last two lines. Add the sticky chewy bar of chocolate chip and walnuts, which just made it nothing less than god-sent. The ice cream and the sinful combination together sealed my dinner. My tongue was on a roll with this one.

We had a good time and a special one at that for the bachelorette. We were lucky with the service, it was timely, courteous, much pleasant. I bet we screamed and giggled our hearts out :p but were not given the dark looks. Basically, I can pretty much understand why Chili's is not just a restaurant but a phenomenon in Kolkata.

Excellent ambience and great food. Ordered the triple dipper and pepperoni pizza, wholesome quantities, infact struggled a bit to finish up. The service was great as the people are very helpful and chatty, overall a great experience...Just one question for the management and zomato, the pizza menu handed to us at the restaurant is not uploaded here in zomato, similarly a server told us that they serve buffalo wings but could not find the same in either zomato or in the menu card handed to us. Request to please upload everything here in zomato so that we are well aware of our choices

My new favourite! You get real burgers! With real meat, the kind you dont get anywhere else in Kolkata! Full marks for that. Great starters-amazing chicken crispers! And corn cobs with them tasted awesome and refreshing. The southwestern egg rolls were nice, but wouldnt recommed. Chicken wings were ok. But the dips were out of the world. Then we had the mini burgers which were perfect but seriously-A MUST TRY IS THE BUFFALO CHILI, which is a sort of keema curry. Whatever you have, take a cup of it. Then my friend had taken taco's, which were good but i personally am not a fan. I am a fan of their fries and onion rings and burgers and chili. The ambience is classy yet casual and service is great. Cant wait to return and try the pizzas and nachos(the people at the next table ordered them and i fell in love with them)!

So on THE 14th of FEB four of us single (and not ready to mingle) gal pals decided to go for lunch @ Chilly's. The idea was actually planted by PB1 and for that much thanks Madame !! I had also heard that Chilly's did not allow people to take pictures of their food so I absolutely had to take pictures of their food.

The inside of the restaurant is exactly like one would expect an American chain restaurant to look like. The servers are friendly and smiling and have obviously been taught the American way of hospitality(which is not always a bad thing). I never really expected to hear someone coming up to me and saying "Your server will come right up to take care of you." sitting in Kolkata.

We ordered an obscene amount of food among the four of us. The Triple Dipper and Crispy Honey Chicken Crispers to start with followed by the Kicked-up Quesadilla Combo (my order), the Philly Cheesecake for PB1, the tenderloin steak for PB2 and the Grilled Chicken with rice for AG.

The Triple Dipper was good but not great. The ranch dressing was the best of the three dippers. I liked the fact that they gave a piece of carrot along with the chicken wings , chicken crispers and southwestern egg rolls. 

Then came the Quesadilla. It was simply delicious. The wrap itself was soft and the stuffing of chicken and bacon just about perfect. It was served with sour cream, salsa a refreshing lettuce salad and this really interesting dressing. This was supposed to be my main course. But did I get to eat it ? NO !!. My "friends" simple snatched up all the pieces and I got to have only two. I daren't even take a picture, because if I did there would have been none left. They kept on telling methat the Crispy Honey Chicken will follow which I can have.

I did NOT like the Crispy Honey Chicken. It was strictly okay. Too sweet and sticky for my taste. But it was served with this corn on cob and fries. The corn was so tender and juicy. I could go back to Chilly's just for that Corn. 

The Grilled chicken came with a lovely paella type of rice. This was not as huge portion-wise as the rest of the dishes. It was quite tasty but I have had better grilled chicken. The rice was lovely. It was light and flavourful.

I did not taste the Steak or the Cheese-steak Sandwich. But the piece of meat of that steak was enormous. The steak comes with two side dishes and PB2 wanted mashed potatoes and corn. PB2 had asked it to be done a Medium and it was nicely pink. PB1  did not even offer anyone a bite of her sandwich. That means that sandwich was what dreams are made of.


We did want to order dessert but we were all too full. So we decided to order one and split. We ordered the Molten Chocolate Lava Cake. And the moment it landed on our table that beautiful piece of work was instantly destroyed and mashed with gooey warm chocolate sauce seeping out and mixing with the moist chocolate cake and smooth vanilla icecream.

We left Chilly's happy and satisfied. v-Day made all of us fall a little bit in love with Chilly's

P.S- I have deducted 0.5 point because for some unknown reason we were made to stand outside even though there were empty seats and 0.5 because there is some room for improvement as far as the food is concerned.

A quick trip to Calcutta and I was determined to visit Chilli's this time.  Here's a quick one for our dinner on 8th feb : 

I should start off with a recommendation - reservation is a must or be ready to wait for 20-30 mins atleast. 
We ordered Chicken wings, Big mouth Bites, Grilled tenderloin and a Roasted Red pepper Chicken. 

Chicken Wings : Good taste with nice portion size. Little too high on Tabasco flavour though but it gives a acidic kick. Probably little more barbecue sauce would balance the taste.

Big mouth bites : Ummm, nice medium steak patty cut into 4 and served in small burger buns, along with onion rings and French fries..... Nicely done dish, but what I felt missing was some soft melted cheese mozzarella , which would have made it more yum. Also the onion rings should be little more crispy.... guys use beer batter :-)

Tenderloin : Again a nicely done medium steak with loads of veggies and fries..... The steak was juicy and maintained its colour inside pretty well. The steak veloute  was very subtle. 

Roasted Red pepper Chicken : Just that after sumptuous meat, I just tasted the sauce of the dish. Its kinda ok nothing great, and the chicken was very very dry.

Service was good and prompt, good news is they are gonna start the bar by end of Feb'14 (I missed the beer with the burger and the steak). 

A good American diner serving great food at a very reasonable price. I would love to visit their outlet again.

When a name like "Chilli's" comes into question - all things hot and spicy just pop up in the mind... 
...and by drawing parallels to the aforementioned statement, the speciality Mexican restaurant sure does live up to its name !!! 
The restaurant is located in the top floor of the Quest Mall, Park Circus, and not in ballygunge ! [Location showcased by Zomato]
The ambience of this restaurant is very soothing and the decor is aesthetically very eye appealing. It has a high wood and glass orientation to it. The music played consists of slow country music and soft rock. The staff of this place display a very cheerful, polite, courteous and happy-to-help attitude. Food served here is authentically Mexican. Chilly and cheese oriented dishes are its speciality. The restaurant is highly hygiene friendly. It is neat, clean and tidy. Prices are moderate considering the sizeable portions that tag along. 
Crave Mexican food ? 
Visit Chili's. It shall transport one to a new dimension through absolute Mexican hypnosis !!! :D

We visited Chili's at the Quest Mall tonight. It was an interesting experience to say the least. We ordered Boneless Chicken Wings, Texas Cheese Poppers, Crispy Shrimp Basket, Veggie Jalapeno Burger, Southwest Chicken Pizza. 

Pros:
The service was attentive and warm.
The Ambiance was good.
The food was fresh and served quickly.
The Texas Cheese Poppers, Crispy Shrimp Basket and the Pizza were excellent!
The portions are Huge!

Cons:
The Veggie Burger was a disaster.
The Boneless Chicken Wings tasted more of Chilli sauce and less of BBQ sauce - didn't like it.
They should open the bar ASAP, it would compliment their food very well.

In the absence of the bar we washed down our meal with Strawberry Lemonade (which was interesting). I would love to go back in a few months and taste more items on their menu. Calcutta lacked a true American/Mexican joint. Chili's fills the void very well.

Absolutely exquisite. The service is fast, the staff smiling and personable, the music just right, the portions huge, and the food tasty.  This is one of the few places in the city for diner style food, and man do they knock it out of the park. Granted, this cuisine is not the most complicated, but what there is, they do it well. We ordered steak medium rare, and it was done to perfection, with the outside adequately browned and the inside pinkish and juicy. The jambalaya was spicy, and the fried calamari we had for starters were soft and not rubbery at all. Special mention should be made of the service, which managed to walk the fine line between helpful and overpowering, and the portions, which are gigantic. If there's just two of you, skip the starters and go straight to the main course.

A Revisit on 25 September 2014 wasn't too great either. Service was laggy. We had to ask to be served. They saw a child with us and yet did not give us the Kiddie's menu. We had to ask twice.

The Jambalaya was okay, the prawns not so fresh. My Lemonade tasted strangely different. Not bad, just different, as if there was a hint of something I couldn't quite recognise. My Bacon burger was disappointing. The meat was dry (they tried to use the excuse that I had asked for well done). It just seemed old. Did not enjoy the burger at all.

Sigh!¬†

A Revisit on 03 May 2014 is a different story. You can read the review of the first visit below.

After a 15 minute wait on a Saturday evening, we were ushered in. The kids menu was offered to our daughter, and she chose Chicken Crisps, Home Style Fries and Strawberry Shake. The Home Style Fries were nowhere like before, being almost pedestrian, comparable to ones served at say KFC. The quantity seemed lesser too. We asked for Triple Dipper for our starter, which was like before, perhaps a tad better I dare say. We also had two lemon Iced Teas, and they were once again a notch below. My Lemonade was okay, but I feel it was better the last time. The quantities seemed somewhat reduced too.

My wife had the Jambalaya for main course. It was not like before, having reduced in quantity as well as taste. My mother-in-law asked for fish & chips. Large serving, but seemed very underdone. It was brought back after re-making almost 30 minutes later. The fact it was basa fish killed it! I asked for a bacon burger (well done) which came normal. I had to send it back. When it was served again, it was rather nice. The meat had taste and seemed cooked well.

We ended with cheesecake... very large servings and overly sweet. They can easily reduce the quantity to 2/3rds of what they serve, give more of less sweet strawberry with it. Had to struggle with it.

Overall the experience was not up to the mark. Service was friendly, but not at all attentive. One had to continuously call for attention and often landed up looking for someone to just bring water! Very poor. The manager came to our table twice, with profound apologies the second time around.

I wish they would follow instructions properly. Things were sluggish. Perhaps they have become too conscious of their success. Another issue is the music was so loud that we could barely hear ourselves speak. At the end of the meal, after paying a premium, we were not really satisfied.

Pull up your socks Chili's!!!

-------------------------------------------------------- 

What a great experience awaited when we walked into this nice restaurant tucked in one corner of Quest Mall on the floor that also has the food court. My wife's generosity was in form of this early birthday treat. We walked in at 7.30 or so on a Saturday evening. We were ushered in immediately, and taken to a window-side seat.

We were immediately served water (in large mugs) and given the menus. The gentleman who was taking our order  (Dipankar) was of the utmost help. patient and what I liked most was he gave us suggestions (unlike some other places that try to avoid by saying "they are all nice" when asked). Also rather unique was he crouched to come to our level, instead of looking down at us. A nice attention to detail. My wife was looking at a Pasta which he suggested against. He also handed over the children's menu to our daughter (a folder piece of paper with options - you get a starter, a main course and a drink). My daughter happily opted for Home Style Fries, a pasta and strawberry shake.

We ordered The Triple Dipper for starters. I found two of the dips a little synthetic but one was great. The carrots were fresh. The Chicken Crispers were awesome. The Southwestern Eggrolls were great too but I found a slight flavour of "jeera" or something similar that I didn't care for. The Chicken Wings should have been better... hardly any meat on them and the sauce was salty. Then came my Fresh Lime Soda and an Iced Lemon Tea for my wife. What I loved about these were the serving sizes. Large mugs filled to the brim. Very nice. Though I didn't much like the iced tea, the Fresh Lime was excellent!

I tasted the Homestyle... nicely done once again. My wife ordered the New Orleans Jambalaya which was excellent. Many large prawn pieces!!! They were out of blackbean so they served corn instead... not a comparison. The portion once again was generous. I asked them not serve the bacon separately as my wife and mother-in-law do not have pork.

For myself, I ordered Grilled Tenderloin Steak, medium well done. Used to well done steaks from most places, I am not sure if my steak was medium well.. It seemed lighter, and had that smell to it. Apart from that it was awesome... once again a good serving, with a large piece of meat, a yummy garlic bread, to which I had asked for mashed potato with gravy and seasonal veggies (red pepper, beans and broccoli). I took my time to polish it off.

A great experience, which left us happy. The friendly service was very welcome, and as mentioned, I like the fact they speak their mind. The generosity in portions (especially drinks) is a huge plus. It was just right. The service was quick, in fact at times brought in before it should have been. Oh one more thing, when they were putting down the quarter plates with the forks and knives, they were careful enough to ensure they did not put a knife on the plate meant for our daughter! Much appreciated :)

Three adults and a child ate for about Rs 2200. Not bad, though not inexpensive by any means. Definitely worth a visit. A place I would recommend.

Chili's! You never cease to amaze me, do you..Whether in Delhi or in Calcutta, there always a huge crowd outside this place on a weekend ..and I'm amazzzed at this! To me honestly  it's a little over hyped. I find the food ok to good but surely not worth the hullabaloo .Here's the thing about Chili's- Nothing's spectacular but everything's decent.

My friend loved their nachos, I liked it too but have tasted better ones at many other restaurants. The fajitas and tacos are good. Most of my friends have always raved about their burgers. Frankly, for me, they have been like any other well seasoned burger that could be spiced up or down as per one's tastes. I have similar feelings towards their pasta.  

On evenings when you just wanna go to the mall, shop and chill, this place is perfect. 
The service is prompt and enthusiastic. As for the food, you need to know the menu really well to make the best selections.

Chili's seems to have captured the imagination of Kolkata because it seems to be quite packed every-time I have visited so far.   This time round I was determined to try the Burger and the Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich. One of my friends ordered the Strawberry Lemonade  which I tasted and found a tad too sweet , Texas Cheese Poppers ( yummy but forgot to take a picture as we were all hungry and polished them off) , Onion Strings and Crispy Pepper Stack ... tasty but oily and the onions and peppers should have been crisp ) , Crispy Honey Chipotle Chicken Crispers (which were super yummy) followed. 
For our main-course we ordered a Non-Veg Jalapeno Burger (done rare to medium) and a Bacon Burger ( medium to well done) along with a Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich without bell peppers and Blackened Salmon. 
Sadly such is the rush that the kitchen is just churning out the food with scant regard to any special instructions and that is why I was disappointed. Both the burgers were cooked to the point of dryness completely overdone though thanks to our server the Jalapeno one was changed though what came back was just a little better than before. The Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich had barely any cheese and we had the same problem with the steak, it was over cooked and hence the meat was dry rather than juicy also the pieces should have been sliced more finely. However we had asked for the tomatoes and pickles on the side as well as to have our burgers cut which was done. The Salmon which was excellent last time was also slightly overcooked this time which was sad.  I sincerely hope that the kitchen realizes that proteins need to be cooked but not overcooked because then even the best of quality produce becomes stringy and dry looses the natural flavors. Service was enthusiastic and courteous and I have no complaints on that front.



----- 13 Jan, 2014 -----

My Chili's experience in Kolkata turned out to be quite good. They don't take bookings so we headed there quite impromptu this Saturday at around 7pm. Since we were early we got a table immediately and were seated. First off we ordered Iced Tea in both Peach and Lemon flavors and the Cherry Cola and the Classic Veg Nachos. Our drinks arrived promptly in their huge tankards, the Iced Tea's were all excellent but the Cherry Cola tasted like a normal Pepsi !!! The Nachos also arrived quickly and they looked pretty as a picture .... generously loaded they tasted great except that the base was a bit soggy would have added far better texture if the base was crisper. For mains we ordered Boneless Chicken Wings tossed in Tangy Sauce .... juicy and cooked to perfection they were good. Next was the Veggie Jalapeno Burger which was quite nice though I felt the burger patty itself could have been better seasoned the french fires were excellent. Then came the Baby Back Ribs which was cooked to perfection and the meat slid right off the bone .... here however unlike other places they serve the smoked ribs separate and the sauce separate so this causes the ribs to dry out a bit and you miss the messy juicy goodness of ribs dripping sauces. Hope the management takes note of this. The star of the show surprisingly was the Blackened Salmon served with Rice and Honey-Dijon Sour Cream Sauce which was excellent. The fish was wonderfully cooked and I wholeheartedly recommend this to any sea food lover.We ended our meal by sharing a Molten Chocolate Cake which absolutely yummy and the perfect ending to a super meal. I look forward to my next visit where the Philly Cheese Steak, Burger and Fajitas are on my wishlist ;-)

The age-old yearning for a diner-style restaurant in Kolkata has finally been answered, albeit at the expense of a slight pocket pinch: Chili's!

Chili's houses booths, tables and bar stools. Take your pick! The place is fairly large. Pinned to the walls are large framed pictures of burgers and the ceiling is fashioned such that it portrays the inner workings of what seemed to be an extensive exhaust system. The staff is extremely friendly and they take the orders while sitting on their knees!

Sorting through the extensive spread, we settled on: Chicken Ranch Burger, Chicken Wings and Molten Chocolate Cake.

The burger, served with generous amounts of crunchy french fries, was a bit dry but the chicken patty (crispy and well-cooked) as well as the bread were quite alright.

The wings, although by themselves were perfectly good pieces of chicken, were doused in a sauce, the flavours of which were not quite what they should have been. They lacked a balance between sweet and spicy, and something felt amiss from the dish.

The show-stopper was, however, the Molten Chocolate Cake: a scoop of vanilla ice-cream topped with a shell of frozen chocolate set atop the most delicious chocolate cake - warm, gooey chocolate sauce oozes out of it as soon as you dip into it. Delightfully exquisite, it will be over before you know it!

Overall, it was an above-ordinary experience, sitting next to the windows that present a view of Syed Amir Ali Avenue from such a great height. The meal cost Rs. 1176, including tax, and I hope to return soon :)

p.s. The photographs were taken by a friend.

Another fabulous gastronomic experience at Chili's today afternoon.
Went to have lunch with J, before catching up for a movie.
We were looking out for a good dining experience when I, remembering my previous experience recommended Chili's.
So at approx 1 pm, we reached the place. It was full and buzzing with people. The hostess took us to our table and our server took over very gently. He was very helpful as I kept asking about a dish and so on. I had already transfixed my mind on two dishes that I had planned to have.
This Dallas headquartered restaurant is a gem. 

We ordered :

Country Fried Chicken (PB's recommendation. Thank you so much, Di)
And a new item on their menu : Roasted Red Pepper Chicken
And soft drinks. Yes, there were served in beer mugs :D

We had high expectations because the last time I ate here, I became a loyal follower and this time, they nailed it BIG.
I was bowled by the food today.
First came the crispy fried chicken which was HUGE. Had a very silky mash which tasted just awesome and they the super soft, juicy sweetcorn on the cob. My friend J had a tough time finishing it. A complete thumbs up.

Then came the roasted red pepper chicken. I was not very sure of it because it was relatively new but I decided to take a risk at hand and I was glad I did.
Roasted red pepper chicken is finely made and topped with a delicious sauce that will blow your mind and the dip is just delicious. It is served with rice and yes, it is massive. I had a hard time finishing it all by myself. By the end of it, I had bloated up like a fish. Their quantity is HUGE and quality GREAT. If you look minutely, the dishes are priced very reasonably.
Chili's won my heart once again. Double thumbs up.

I would also like to mention two things :

1. The servers sit on their toes and take your order which I felt was very very courteous
2. The washroom is super hygienic 

Coming back soon.
Hungry for more.

Cheers! :)



----- 27 Dec, 2013 -----

Was aiming Chili's from a long time and today, I finally managed to visit this food joint.
Now, one thing : I was already full from the lunch that I had, so I could not eat here much.
So, I had packed the food and brought it back home.
Even their packing is brilliant, getting to that in the later half.
Chili's has a fine ambience. You can almost smell chilli flakes in the air. Haha.
Cosy seating and beautifully lit. Very comfortable yet classy, that is what Chili's is all about. And good music too. *chuckles*
One factor that they keep in mind is hygiene :)
And extremely helpful staff. 
A thumbs up.

Coming to the food, the quantity and quality is at par with each other. :)
Honestly, given the quantity, prices are quite moderate.
We had :
Strawberry Lemonade
Triple Dipper
And there was this chocolate cake with gooey chocolate sauce and ice-cream, high calorific stuff as I call it.

The triple dipper is an amazing combination of three starters with three kinds of dips. Very filling.
The strawberry lemonade on the other hand was subtle and refreshing, and sweet on the edge.
Now, they serve beverages in big beer mugs :D

The chocolate cake was also pretty bombastic and pretty BIG. -_-
I was on the verge of bursting, so I carried the appetizers home.

Now comes the packaging.
Carefully packed inside aluminium boxes were the food, and the dips were placed in little containers and sealed well so that they dips do not drip during the road journey.
Thanks to our kolkata roads :p
Too smooth and even xD
Packaging is extremely good.
And about the hygiene factor that I was talking : They also give you a packed sanitized tissue with your meal :)
So, no wiping hands in the napkins anymore.
The food was billed at INR 1018/-

Haha. The conclusion : An extremely well lit and clean joint serving good food at an affordable rate.
Go give it a try and you sure wont be dissapointed. I am so going back for more.

Happy eating,
Cheers! :)

chilli's ,the restaurant chain is based in dallas,texas and the kolkata edition carries the traits of an american diner.the menu is very selective and has meticulous chices from mexican and italian cuisine too.the decor is nice and very aptly lit,nothing pompous about it.the staff are prompt but  they don't help out with serving(they actually refuse even if requested).

now the food.we went along the lines of suggestions i got from zomato.fajita trio,tripple dipper,country fried chicken,cilantro pesto pasta (chicken and shrimp) and fusion.i liked country fried chicken-its adorable with the crispy chicken,corn,potato mash with dipping cheese.it's quite a quaint favourite among  my friends working abroad,and finally i had it myself.also liked fusion,its a pleasant concoction of a mocktail,and the humungous glass makes it look like a nectar of the gods. the rest were good too,the food that is.you don't mind the price tag 'cause the servings are always abundant.they even serve the water in beer glass sized tumblers.the three of us made a bill of Rs2842,out of which almost 700 bucks was vat and service tax(10%)

for the management,
1)when placing the order,the waiter with this mishap of a french cut kept pestering us with order of HIS choice.even when we informed we have a problem with pork,was pestilent in encouraging us to have the baby ribs.well,we are all aware of the choices we have at chilli's,and we don't need your recommendation.we'll rather ask when we need it.
2)we were provided starter plates for the entire course.when i requested for bigger plates,they came back with one,and we were three at the table. what's wrong with you people? with such a fine establishment,you run short on cutlery?
3) we had ordered quite a few dishes.the staff had no sense at all to deliver the order in an amicable sequence.the starter,the pasta,the drink,everything came together and at a point,there was no space on the table.the dips and water were kept in the corner,and it was highly uncomfortable dining.and your waiters are quite curt in informing they can't help with the serving.if that's the tradition,its fine,but atleast they should know better than to make a mess of the table.please sensitize your staff,they appear quite supercilious
4)you have added quite a few mocktails -mojitos,margeritas,fusion but you have no chart for it.when i asked for the list,they took almost 20 min to get back.it simply spoils the mood,and the order.

we didn't resort to a consternation.i understand the place is new,and has every potential to grow and outlive the flaws,and i hope the management will look into the matters i just mentioned.again,the food and ambiance is top notch,but to without the proper service,you'll have fewer repeat customers.kolkata is replete with fine dining experience these days.

I am a great lover for Mexican food... and I feel no meal is complete till you don‚Äôt end it with a dessert. 
 So, Chili‚Äôs .....was just the place for me... I am so glad that finally it‚Äôs come to our city Kolkata. 
Located at Quest Mall, it becomes very easy for a friends get together as it becomes central for people coming from all areas. 
Loved the young and lively atmosphere. The ambiance is cool...once you are inside the restaurant, it gives a very international feel. I like the wooden table with red sofas. The light dropping right on the table makes it a cozy place to sit and enjoy with friends over drink, food and desserts. 
I went there on a weekday for early lunch, so there was no so much rush and we could take our time to enjoy the meal.
The staff was very warm and friendly.  They guided us well with the food suggestions and potion size ( The portions are very big)
As we all were vegetarians, we ordered for Classic Nachos & Texas Cheese Poppers for starters along with Strawberry Lemonade.
For main course I ordered for Quesadilla Explosion Salad with cottage cheese, Jalapeno Burger  & Veggie and Cheese Quesadillas.

And the sweet endings was really sweet with the Chocolate Chip Paradise Pie .... don‚Äôt think about calories when you are indulging in this. It‚Äôs worth all the weight  ;)

 I must say, it‚Äôs a place you can just drop by anytime for a good ambiance, good music and great food .. this place can uplift your mood in a jiffy.  Cheers!!

I am writing this review because I want to talk about a very good experience at Chili's yesterday which got marred in the very end, slightly, but recovered admirably. My friend S was celebrating her birthday, so I went to Chili's with D. S was worried that we would not be allowed to take pictures inside, but I assured her that I have taken pictures EVERY TIME I have been to Chili's, and no one has said a single thing to us till date. So, after entrance, we decided quickly on our food - Triple Dipper, followed by Country fried chicken for me, Blackened fish for S and the Bacon Burger for D. 

There was also a Strawberry Lemonade and a Diet coke on order. We were carrying an iced coffee from Au Bon Pain, and the server there did not mind S putting it on the table. We also asked them if they did anything special for birthdays, and they said they served a free brownie. We pointed out that it was S's birthday. The food was very good - the triple dipper consisted of chicken crispers which reminded us of a well-made fish batter fry, only with chicken, the buffalo wings were spot on, and the egg rolls were delish. We had an assortment of dips with it. D later poured some of that over the fries she got with her bacon burger. She had ordered a well-done one, and the burger was very big, filling and satisfying. 

My order of chicken came covered with gravy, and had a juicy, succulent corn and soft mash. The chicken was crisp and a huge portion. S said that her blackened fish was perfect. We were served a brownie afterwards which we thought would be a small portion. It wasn't. It was a generous portion, and came covered with walnuts, chocolate sauce and ice cream. The brownie was VERY good. It hit all the spots - moist, chocolatey, warm, slightly crisp on the edges. the ice cream that came with it made it even better, adding that cool milky delight that we loved. We were also taking pictures incessantly, of ourselves, and of the food, and at this point our bill came. We saw that the bill had included the brownie, but just as we said it, the server looked at it, and immediately changed the bill and removed the brownies, profusely apologizing. So the experience was a very good one, I daresay!



----- 31 Dec, 2013 -----

So, although initially I was all for Chili's on the 24th, we ended up hitting this joint on the 25th. There was a line, and after waiting for half an hour or so (to be fair, they DID say half an hour) we got our seats. Our order was quick -  triple dipper, cup of chili, sirloin steak, fajita combo. Our server took the order quickly, but we still had to ask for our water glasses. 

Chili came in first - it was good, and then the sirloin steak, followed by the fajita. What was supposed to be our appetizer, the triple dipper, came in last. There was also a confusion about a slice of garlic bread which they did not include in the meal, and had to be asked for. It took three servers to actually UNDERSTAND and get it for us. 

Our meal, however, was very satisfying. and despite the confusion, I still will give this place top marks for the food. 

For the post about my experience in details, visit my food blog at: http://presentedbyp.blogspot.in/2013/12/chilis-kolkata-opens-in-quest-mall-my.html

Update: I decided to revisit today, got the Honey Chipotle Chicken, and it was absolutely phenomenal - tender chicken coated in crisp sweet honey glaze, a lovely, juicy, very tender corn-on-the-cob, and fries perfectly done.

Good place and nice food. Very unusual menu as compared to the other restaurants of Kolkata. Food is very tasty and a complete value for money. But people who eats less should be careful while giving the order coz quantity-wise its quite a heavy. The service is also very cordial. Quite delighted to visit such a nice place.

I went there today with my mom after having so much about it and i must say the place left an impression on me! the menu had a great variety and the serving was really generous. We ordered for a chicken mushroom soup, chicken tacos and chicken crispers, all of them were just delicious. 
On my second visit, I tried out the triple dipper, the tenderloin steak, the chicken fajitas, buffalo soup and the molten lava cake. All of them were spot on! I think this joint has set some very good standards for what american cuisine should be. 
I strongly recommend this place to all food lovers.

I had never eaten at Chili's before, and my hope was that it was one of those "good" restaurant chains. There are a lot of chains of this scale, like TGI Fridays, that actually serve decent food. But while the food was generous and carefully prepared, the experience was undermined by the highly processed nature of the food. The lowest point was the part I was most excited about: a fat beef burger. But the patty itself was a grey slab of mystery food that smelled and tasted very unappetizing. It was obviously not pure meat, and on returning home I see on their web site that there is no statement about the meat being of any particular quality or purity, which is a bad sign. The rest of the burger was nicely constructed though.

We had the triple dipper appetizer, which was huge and tasted good, but again, the sauces were your typical processed crap. Something fresh would have been nice.

The turkey club sandwich was okay, but who lightly fries a turkey club in oil? It made it very greasy, and not in a charming way like a toasted cheese sandwich, just bad.

The blackened salmon we ordered looked pretty nice, but I didn't taste it.

We had one dessert, the chocolate chip paradise pie, which was delicious and large enough for sharing.

So, it was a mixed bag. But everything had this quality about it of having been made in a factory, not a kitchen. And since I really only went there for the burger, I don't intend to go back.

Chili's is the place you need to visit if your body lacks sufficient protein... it's Elysium for non-veg lovers.

Like many people, I was super excited knowing Chili's is finally here at Kolkata. And I finally made it on a Sunday afternoon with a friend. The place was packed with a small queue outside. Thankfully, I didn't have to wait for too long. The menu was pre-decided. So, we got the seats and ordered 1 Triple Dipper, 1 Fajita Trio and 1 Blackened Salmon.

As you can see it on the menu, the Triple Dipper has Chicken Crispers, Southwestern Eggrolls and Chicken Wings.The Wings were good and succulent. But I didn't like the Eggrolls - didn't like the way it tasted. However, the first bite into a Crisper blew my mind. LITERALLY!! It was pure bliss... the saving grace. I can come back here any day just to gorge on this beauty.

Next up were the two main courses! This was the first time I tasted salmon, and frankly, I was sceptic on what I'll be given. Contrary to my fear, the salmon was stupendous. The fillet was lightly grilled and its taste got well-complemented with the sour cream sauce. The spices used in the rice were kept to the bare minimum, and along with the tomato-spinach salad, it was a great combination. The Fajita Trio is another dish you must try out here. Getting the classic steak, grilled chicken and grilled shrimps on a single platter is a dream come true. Mustn't comment on the taste... there are truly things words "should not" express. Also got the complementary tortillas & salsa with it. Didn't like this addition though... and decided on savouring just the meat all by itself. Just one word of advice. Don't take too long to finish the dish. Or else, it might become tough to chew the steak when it's on the colder side. All 4 dips (3 with the Triple Dipper and 1 with the Blackened Salmon) were super yum too! I've promised myself that I'll come back to Chili's & go for the ones a filled tummy didn't allow me to have (especially the desserts).

Full marks for the d√©cor... the bar area seriously gives out the feel that you are seating in an US diner. I've read it on the previous reviews about the glasses (or mugs)! The rumours are all true... these mugs are HUGE. So be well prepared if you're ordering a drink. And I'm truly grateful for the hospitality I received here... especially from my attendant, Shahid. Great job!

Chili's is pretty new, and it'll take time for words to spread out. But by the looks of it, I can guarantee that it'll be spreading like wildfire.

Great ambience! Loved the baby back ribs, but too overpriced.  Loved the country fried chicken with an amazing corn on the cob. But, the desert stole the show. Stafff was helpful. Overall, it was a Sunday afternoon wellspent.

Amazing American tex mex food, including yummy beef burgers ( beef patty sourced from abroad).
There is a child menu at Rs 200 which incl fries, burger and unlimited soft beverage.
But the day I went, the tenderloin steak was rubbery and not good. Changed it to shrimp basket which was awesome!

When I first heard that Chilis was in Kolkata, I was literally screaming with joy. I have been to their Delhi joint, and it was insanely good. Hence, my standards were set right then and there for the Kolkata's Chili's.

After a good, hearty vegetarian meal for a party of 7, I was rather disappointed. We ordered nachos, quesadillas, 2 different kinds of enchiladas, 2 different kinds of burgers, and about 7 shakes, which consisted of 3 different varieties. Apart from the quesadillas, everything else was a big letdown. The nachos can't even be mentioned in the same sentence as that of the one served to is in Delhi. Enchiladas were bland. People say you can't go wrong with burgers, but they definitely did. Cherry Coke was like a glorified version of Pepsi Atom, which is shit. The cold coffee and the shake were below standards.

And it's not that they charge any less. It's quite a bit of pocket pinch. And it will be quite a bit more after they get the liquor licence. Service was average. Ambience was okay.

Not a very good experience. Go only if you have never eaten Mexican.

We were four of us and we checked out Chili's on a Friday night. Firstly, it's a no reservation place so first come first serve - which makes sense.

I've  been to Chilis several times in the US - this one is not even close. 

They have an American concept of "free-refills" on Coke/Sprite. If you think about it the more sugar water you have the less good you are going to consume. The strawberry lemonade is pretty good as well.

Ordering the classic nachos was a no brainer. To be honest, I was let down. I was expecting something more. Also I would have preferred if the dips came in small cups. The guacamole was just average. I was expecting better guacamole.

The one thing I liked about Chilis is that they do not compromise on the helping size and their pieces of food items are big.

I also liked the fact that they gave separate menus to each person. Makes sense!

We ordered the Tacos, Quesdillas and Montery Chicken as Entrees.

The quesadilla is a home run. It comes with pilaf and a cup of chili. Very neatly done. Two thumbs up.

The chicken was good as well. The tacos come both in soft and hard shell. we ordered the hard shell and it was well prepared. Again the size was filling.

I was tempted to try the burgers but from I hear the burgers aren't up to the mark. So il leave it to the next time to try that.

Also the staff is well aware of the menu and take good care of you. Except for once we got served the wrong dish. 

It's a good casual place to dine. Id love to eat there and catch a sport game once they have a liquor license.

To start with, 
My heart just skipped a beat when i saw them serve cold tortillas with some *wannabe* salsa or rather salad and some really tasteless guacamole to my veggie friend. Okay it's true that she might not have had guacamole before but it hurts when you get to experience this as a first timer! Talking about first times, this is definitely not my first time at Chilis. I have been to their Delhi outlet which is so amazing but i have no idea what happened to this one ! 
We ordered for the following-- 
Me - country fried chicken with house made gravy and mash . The mash was PERFECTO ! Not too creamy and yet smooth ! Rock on ! The chicken breast was juicy and tender and very well cooked ! So brownie points to that as well ! I have no idea how the gravy tasted as there was literally just three tea spoonful of it ! The mash had this cheese slice molten on top with paprika -which is rather unnecessary but who cares ! Cheese always tastes good right ? Over all my dish was really good probably because firstly i played it pretty safe (because i had the same thing in delhi ) and secondly because what could possibly go wrong with fried chicken ? 

Confused ? Well now read the following even closer --- 
One friend of mine had her eyes on the shrimp basket so she decided to go for that - and what was given to her were approximately five shrimps batter fried, probably 500gms of fries (fried again) and one huge dollop of ranch ( basically packaged mayo with some capers and olives perhaps) -all amounting to a really oily dish. Personally i feel they could have had something gravyish to go with that to simply cut down on the oil content. The shrimps that were meant to be the crown jewels were undercooked( and when i say that , let me also mention that my friend is still feeling sick because of that) . You all know how dangerous shrimps can be for the digestive system if cooked the wrong way right ? And who said that anything fried can actually taste good ? It needs seasoning, herbs flavours and lots more to that ! We clearly saw that missing which was a big let down ! 

My second friend who is a veggie ordered the cottage cheese fajitas --- 
Turned out to be these three cold tortillas with this sizzling plate full of raw paneer and some veggies thrown in for * flavour * purpose ! I know its harder to cook for veggies buy hey paneer can taste good too if marinated or seasoned well ! There she was figuring out the guacamole and sour cream that was paired with some finely chopped tomatoes and onions ( which they call salsa) - zero dressing and Zero salt . Wow ! Over all the dish was a complete disaster ! I remember her commenting * the dish is a perfect way to shoo off vegetarians* . Well the irony is that i really thought that the veg menu could be better than the non veg ( based on the pictures ) . The food photographer is great ! Keep him ! 

There was no space for dessert in our stomach or in the kitchen for that matter ! If you put that awesome cheesecake on the menu then please try keeping it actually in the kitchen too guys ! I don't want to comment on their beverage menu as it is not out yet but hey, the pepsi tasted really good ! Hands up ! ;) 

Ambience is really good . Seating arrangements are a lot like the american diners which is actually something you will not find in this city. 

Before i forget ! The servicemen are really great when it comes to paying full attention to their customer's needs but i had a feeling about this particular serviceman who watched us like a hawk ! Hahaaha ! That sort of creeped us out ! I know we look good but try focussing somewhere else when i am eating ! Hehehe

I think i have said enough . So yeah the big question - would i go back ? If someone's treating -yes ! If someone's wanting to hang out - maybe just for the cheese cake and pepsi or some other items that i have not tried , but generally nothing really pulls me back to this place.

Hope i could help ! Feel free to let me know people !

A lot of 'buzz' created about this place brought me here.
Located in one of the SELF PROCLAIMED best mall of the city, came to me as a surprise. OUTSTANDING is the word for this restaurant. Great food, Great people & Great ambience as well.

FOOD :-
Triple Dipper was exactly how i wanted it to be.
Classic nachos was just too good (especially the guacamole) tasted great & authentic.
Chicken wings was a bit of let down as it was too tangy (as per my taste).
Taco was ok (as it was vegetarian :/ , it happens when you have a vegetarian with you).
Enchiladas were awesome, loved the softness of the tortillas.
Molten Chocolate Cake, now what do i talk about that. In one word ORGASMIC.

AMBIENCE - Good enough, very lively atmosphere.

Loved the behaviour of the boy who attended us, cant remember his name but he was too good when it comes to give your guest a good experience.

Waiting for 40 mins was a bit of a let down.
Suggest you guys to provide enough plates, forks, knives & tissues to the guests, so that they dont have to ask for it again & again.

Overall a very good experience, that is what i look for whenever i go to a place. Would love to rate you guys 5 when i visit next.
Thanks
Keep the ball rolling guys. CHEERS

Very American. Very warm. Was super pleased with the generous portions and even more so with the wide vegetarian spread! A meal for two would cost about 1500 Rupees, but then you're too stuffed and happy by the time the cheque arrives. Give it a try. Its worth the effort.

We went on 1st Jan '14.
As far as the food is concerned, its just wonderful and service along with the courteous staff, it makes it great. The Baby pork ribs were just great. Had a really great pork ribs after a long time. Its definitely a must try. 
The ambiance is nice.

The only suggestion i have but am sure in time they would have it is an option of phone to call the people waiting. Its not nice to make people wait for 20-30 mins in front of the restaurant since one does not have a phone to call. For the moment am sure a mobile phone can be used. Other than this little hiccup, everything went well... 

Desserts are yet to be tried. Definitely would go back

Chili's, the first American diner experience in the city. Just one word- YUMMMM!!

Me and my friend went today 1st Jan for Dinner there.
Initial reaction- too long a wait. The Hostess was completely BLANK. She had no idea about how to handle the crowd. When you as a restaurant expect huge footfalls on such days, it makes sense to put someone capable at the door. During our wait, we tried to hop on to the wi-fi. However the hostess wasnot even aware that wi-fi facility is provided. We sincerely hoped the experience inside would be better.


And BOY OH BOY OH BOY. Were we surprised or what? Our Server was this tiny girl, Sarbani. She just oozed out with energy and joy. 

Initially we wanted to try out the Triple Dipper, Country Fried Calamari and Big Mouth Bites. But Sarbani was kind enough to inform us that the food would be much in excess. So, we ended up ordering the Triple Dipper and the Big Mouth Bites.

The Triple Dipper was amazing. The entire platter came with an assortment of dips, 3 of them. The Chicken wings were well placed when it came to flavours and quantity. The Southwestern Egg Rolls were really nice, specially when combined with the dips. The star of the platter was The Chicken Crispers which were Juicy with a capital 'J'. 

We ordered an extra plate of Homestyle Fries. Such a relief to get PROPER fries, which aren't just thawed Mccain produce. 

Moving on to the Big Mouth Bites. A little disappointed when it came to the presentation as the picture in the menu showed 4 pieces of bite sized burgers. We on the other hand were served a normal burger cut into quarters. 
But the flavour that the mini burgers were bursting of just over rode our initial apprehension. The Tenderloin was well done, but not dry. The bacon bits were crispy and well fried and the onions were well caramelised. Along with the burger one gets a generous helping of Fries and Onion Rings.

Amongst the beverages, we ordered a Strawberry Lemonade and a Cherry Cola. Both were intersting and innovative.
The Bar is apparently opening in a week or two.. :D :D :D

Although we ordered just 2 items off the menu ( trust me we eat A LOT), we ended up packing a good third of the items. 

Looking forward to my next time to try out the highly recommended Baby Back Ribs.

Interesting stuff and TIPS:

> The offer you an anti-bacterial hand wipe at the beginning of the meal (They encourage you to eat with your hand!).
> The have a tiny cubicle as a smoking room, which is equipped with a hand sanitizer (Who thinks of that!). 
> The smoking room has a sound controller with which you can adjust the level of the sound of the music (So cool!).
> On the bill they have a website address provided. You can log in from their wifi if you want and submit a feedback. Each feedback entails a surprise at the end. We got a discount of Rs 150 on our next visit. They also track your food order through this method, to remember your preferences. :D

Will DEFINITELY come back here again, SOON!!

It was a disappointing experience having eaten at the chain's American restaurants. 
The service was ok. Waiter would disappear and we would have to call another.
They did not even bring water to the table for the one person who was not having a drink.
We were vegetarian and the few options available were poorly cooked as well.
We ordered the following:
Classic Nachos, Cottage Cheese Fajitas, Veg BBQ Ranch Burger and the Chipotle Southwestern Pasta along with a Lemonade and a Coke. 
The appetiser came at the end of the meal after the main courses had been served - that too only after asking for it. 
Food itself was mostly bland and tasteless. Fajitas were raw/barely edible. Burger with ranch dressing needed a microscope to find some ranch dressing. Pasta was halfway decent but I would not go there to eat it. Much better places exist in Kolkata for a good pasta.

To top it all they added a service charge to the bill at 10%. I was not happy but had to pay it.
Overall it is a place I would avoid.

Wanted to visit Chili's since it came to India and have visited lately. Its food n ambiance ---both are excellent,no doubt. Grilled chicken platter, a dish i took as an evening brunch and the food consists of rice,chicken n broccoli (boiled n of low fat) will make you satisfied. quantity of one dish is not enough for two heads,but tastes very good. I went to experience the salmon fish over there,but it was not available that time. The people who is at your service are also well-mannered! They treat you so well! but the price of any food is quite high! But as a Mexican restaurant,chili's is going well. Spacious enough. I want to visit the place once more for a person of my life  who ,himself  is a great foodie n loves food of any continent and will appreciate the whole thing for sure. I will make him visit the place for his utter delight. Keep going,Chili's!:)

There is nothing good about their signature Classic Nachos. The nachos were very liberal on cheese which made them taste very cheesy & miserly on the guacomole and sour creame and to our surprise even though the menu says that the nachos have beans there was no beans in the nachos served to us. The Strawberry Lemonade was served with 4 mosquitos floating on top. Upon bringing it to the servers notice he had a smile on his face and said "its just mosquitos flying arround". They did not have the courtsey of not including it in the bill either. DONT GO TO CHILLI'S...it was bad.

The restaurant is situated at the 4th floor and provides a nice view if you are aloocated a seat along the glassed wall. Interiors are well decorated in accoradance with the name and the Mexican platter. Staffs are very friendly and well behaved.
The food is tasty and very fresh. Amount is very generous. The fact that there is no rice on the menu allows you to eat a lot more of the available dishes. Price is reasonable given the location and the brand, except that the burgers may seem a little high priced.
All in all, this restaurant is definitely recommended.

For those who've eaten and enjoyed American/Mexican food in the US, please don't even bother with this joint. In their favor, the food is truly American, in fact its all cooked there and bought frozen here. Probably a month later we get to eat this food, taste and flavor lost in transit, microwaved and utterly yuck. Don't go by the pics on the menu, the food will most def. look like it but tastes like garbage. We have enough joints serving fresh soul food in Kolkata to even bother with this junk. Am a rib fan, and  going by the pics I just couldn't wait. Just one bite later I could've killed somebody, ....cheers...srry no can do too!!!!

Good food and thankfully good service. TexMex is great here! The classic nachos are to die for. Finally got some good sour cream and salsa in Calcutta. However my sirloin steak was too dry and would have preferred more sauce options. Also loved the option of bottomless Coke/ Sprite/ Fanta. I am definitely going back very soon... need to try out the pork ribs.
