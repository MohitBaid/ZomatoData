I absolutely didn't like their food. Fried rice was bad (most dry rice I ever had) and Thai Chicken was awful. Ordered through Swiggy. I would never recommend this restaurant inspite of the pocket friendly prices.

They delivered for an order as little as 70/- very impressed to say the least. To top it all the quality was a lot and the taste was exceptional as well.

The owner is really nice, they also make custom dishes if you like. It's cheap and the quantity is quite a lot for the amount you pay.
Would recommend.

This hotel is in my neighbourhood.
We order food frequently from here.
It is a very much pocket friendly restaurant with good food quality and provides a hearty quantity.
It has a OK ambience.
I mostly prefer take away.

This place is my neighborhood, its high time i should write a review for it. Decor minimal, food avg good. The quantity is hearty. Take-away recommended. And if u cant finish your food there,  they'll pack it for u (even it its a group meal) thats one big plus.

It is funny, that I am reviewing this place of all places, but I feel, having dined here since my childhood, it's my duty to put in a few good words for this extremely homely and humble place. I barely ever went for a dine in experience here, because let's face it, it's not worth a dine in, but have been ordering take away since my childhood. For a rather low price, this place serves filling and well cooked dishes. It's of course, no match to conventional restaurant food, but it's one of those memories of a neighborhood eatery, which forms integral parts of everyone's life and growing up. The food is tasty, hygienic and comes in a good quantity. I love their barbeque chicken (Do not expect anything, like the conventional notion of barbeque chicken!) It's rather chicken dumplings, cooked in a transparent gravy made from ginger and egg albumin and their American chopsuey.

Ordered through Swiggy...so lets talk about the food only - Delivery was bit late but Swiggy team kept me informed so its fine

Crispy Chicken
Chicken Fried Momo
Chicken Pan Fried Momo
Dragon Chicken
Fish Finger

Nothing to comment separately on the each food items mentioned above - all were ok and OK is good :) Value for money.

The should think on their packing of delivery items as paper box doesn't keep items hot. Will look forward to try their main course.

Have been to this once. This place can be located while you go to New Alipore from Behala, better to follow your Zomato Map. The place is very small with 4-5 tables in it. There is nothing which I can say about ambience. The price tag is very low which makes you come to this place. The service was good as the owners and the staffs are very well behaved. The sitting arrangements can be better. The food was not that good and was pretty ordinary. We took these dishes:
#Chicken Hot & Sour Soup : Pretty ordinary
#Chicken Fried Rice : Good
#Chicken Chowmein : Not good, oily
#Chicken Lollipop : Less of chicken and more of the outer coating, bit more spicy

Last Words:
Ordinary place with a low price tag. 

3/5, 0.5 for their behaviour...

Home deliveries are more frequent for us, haven't yet been to the place.
Its a low budget Chinese restaurant, quality of food is good and service is reliable..

its a good low budget restaurant . the food staff justifies the price. quality is average . the amazing part is that, you get a good amount of food at such a low cost. tried the chicken fried rice. it was full of ingredients , at rs. 100 one couldnt expect more . as i opted for a home delivery hence i cannot say anything about the waiters neither the environment.Â value for money - 5/5 Â only the taste could have been better

The quality of food is very good considering the price tag. Mixed Fried rice and hot garlic chicken is my favorite over there. The serving time is very fast. The only thing I personally don't like is the ambiance. It could be done better with some good lightings and all those staffs.

The food is very good and it's absolutely within budget. The chicken momo and noodles is very tasty. Delivery time is approximately 1 hour. It's good choice if suddenly u 've guests at ur place or for a day when u don't want to cook.
