We generally order food from here since it quite near my house. If u want comfort foods, this is the place. Reasonable and tasty chinese food, nice and homely ambience, this place calls to you again and again. Their indian foods are quite good too, but I prefer their chinese food.

Good food but sometimes the preparation goes to hell may be due to the chef's mood.

So if it's your luck to get good food you may have it if the mood of the chef's is ok

This place has been a saviour for the locals innumerable times. I have been coming here since ages. This is the only option for people staying here, who feel lazy to cook a meal. Affordable and decent food. The taste is not extraordinary, but it's not bad too. The staff are extremely courteous and well mannered. The place has a nice family ambience.
The Indian dishes have a lot of sugar in it, so some people may not like the taste. Tandoori items is something they are famous for. Tangri kebab, chicken tandoori, haryali kebab, garlic chicken dry, mutton biryani and nan roti. A good place for outing without a big pinch to the wallet.
People who come to the Great Indian Botanical Garden, this place is for you to relish some taste warm tandoori and chinese cuisines.

Penguin is a good restaurant and serves very tasty food as compared to its standards. The dish chicken reshmi butter masala is worth a try with any type of indian rice. Earlier also I had tried dishes like chicken tandoori, crispy chili babycorn, paneer pasinda, etc. They all were amazing and worth it.

Penguin is a good stop for a quick meal when close by. It is nothing special but can be tried. 

Food

The food is nothing special but you can try the chicken biryani which is light on the stomach as well as the pocket. 

Ambience and service 

Penguin gets a thumbs down on both these fronts with just about average decor and service. 

Cost

150-250 per person. 

Verdict 

Can try but no special recommendations.

I just went to this place today and liked the place. The ambience was quite good,cleanliness was maintained, well decorated. Then come to the food,me and my friends took chicken biriyani,chicken fried rice,chicken butter masala and chicken Manchurian... The quantity and quality both were decent... Taste was fine the Manchurian was really good.the specialty of this place is it's too budget friendly and they don't take vat also.

Nearest restaurant frm my place. We always find an excuse to go there. This is a good cozy place fr family dinner or frnds' get together or anything else. It serves u good delicacies in affordable price. Quantity wise also it is serving good. I prefer chinese here over the mughlai dishes except chicken tangdi kebab. Also try chilly garlic chicken, request them to make it dry, believe me u r gonna love it.Bt smtimes amount of meat get drastically lowered in their noodles/rice dishes, especially fr take away/home delivery cases. And also I smtimes feel them  inconsistent as taste differs occasionally fr repeat/same dishes. Although this place hasnt been renovated fr a very long tym bt still we feel comfortable with their interiors.

Penguin is like our family restaurant. Birthday treats... Anniversaries.. New Year... Durga Pujo... Either we go to the restaurant or order from there... Their Chinese dishes are the best. I Love their chicken tandoori. Recently I ordered the dry chilli chicken and it was awesome. The chicken was soft and the sticky sauce has the right amount of spiciness in it. Loved it.
Most of the time I either order mixed fried rice or chicken hakka noodles with any chicken dish. The quantity is more than enough, the taste is good and the prices reasonable or rather cheap. The staff is professional and warm.

So, if you are in for good food at reasonable prices, do check this one out.

Happy Dining! :)

Just a 3 min walk from my house.
The food is great and though the prices have gone up a lot in the past few years still they are pretty cheap and affordable.

Their chinese dishes are great mostly the chicken items and also their fried rice n noodles are great too.

The Indian items are mediocre and I am saying this so that your expectations are lowered and hopefully you don't catch them on a bad day and if not you will be delighted with the food.

Pocket friendly and tasty would describe this place most appropriately.

Comfort food at it's best.

Located just at the crossing on Danesh SK lane. This is a two storeyed restro, the ground floor being NON-AC.

Service is quite fast and staff is very polite and courteous.

The chinese food here is unbelievably tasty. It's the kind of food you keep coming back to. This is the reason I guess why I have been here more than 5 times in a few months.

Whenever I'm travelling to shibpur, I make sure to come here and grab a bite.

My favourties are

Chicken lollipop
Noodles and fried rice
 Dry Chili garlic chicken
Hong Kong chicken

I've also tried their chicken tikka kebab which was good. But there Chinese cuisine is better than mughlai, any day.

This place is actually weaved in my memories from school time. But after my recent visit I thought to write. It is not a very high profile restaurant with impressive ambience but yes the food good as well as the service. You can say it is pocket friendly restaurant.  We ordered for sweet n sour soup and a chicken sweet corn soup. It was not very good it was ok. Next was masala kulcha, butter naan, kashmiri pulao, chicken bharta, kashmiri aloo dum,  and tangri kebab. I must the main couse was quite impressive. It's a must for the localities as well the explorers who are looking for a pocket friendly yet delicious foot joints.

Out of my dining in various places Penguin is without a doubt in my opinion the worst place I have eaten so far. And that is saying a lot because I eat at almost all types of joints. The food was below average, it was cold, the waiters were impolite to a point of rude. Tell me who serves cold food in a restaurant. We went there and had to share a table ( that was not a big deal for me but might for someone else), the waiters took their time in bringing the food and the food was cold as ice. Furthermore the final bill was different from what I ordered. It was 15 ruppes extra because of a dish that I didn't order. Not recommended for anyone ever.

Had my first celebration here (good result in Secondary exam - treat from a brother - we were on budget ;)  ). The ambiance was average. Food quality was good. This was 2008.
I visited them a month ago recently. The ambiance seemed good now than earlier. Food quality unchanged; but the price is a pocket-pinch, considering the quality and quantity of the food.
Go for this joint if want some place private along with decent quality of food.

The first restaurant you ever went to, on your own, is always very special and equally disheartening to rate it so very low. 
Penguin was a very good eatery back in 2005-6 till around 2010. Then some managerial changes took place, and food started really deteriorating. My first blow came on ordering chicken tikka butter masala more than a year back. It was inedible literally. 
A few days back I went up to visit for some soup. The penguin special soup which I ordered had stale shrimp and dead mosquitoes in it. I was disheartened.
Even a few days back I ordered some simple mixed gravy chowmein and garlic chicken. The chicken in both dishes was again stale.
The decor too, was almost classy and beautiful. Due to no upkeep, like the food, the decor too has gone stale. 
I loved this place, and the state of this today leaves me no position to recommend, ever.

I left B.Garden for Kolkata in the year of 2010, but before that I had visited this place twice.
Situated at the Danesh Sk. Lane, Penguin was one of the best restaurant of that area. I remember, as a child,  I used to amazed seeing Penguin.
Their food seemed very nice to me at that time. Now I understand that, they serve food of average quality.
I still believe, this is one of the best place to turn your face on, if you are around D.S.Lane or B.Garden.

The taste of the food has degraded over the past few years.
I visited the place a month ago. Food was tasteless. They prepared Chicken chaap and paneer  masala with the same gravy. The chicken pieces were prepared for chicken Kabab and just mixed with the gravy.. -_- 
In one line the Restaurant is Affordable and Worst.

I will never visit this place again.

The restaurant was suggested by my friend, since my first visit I have visited the restaurant an innumerable times. Often for casual dining or to throw some parties. Good hangout with nice ambience. Service is quicker than other places. The tandoor items are excellent, with 'handi' chicken. It is easily located by the main road and with affordable price will ensure my visit in times to come.

This is the nearest restaurant from my residence. I have been trying different dishes here since class XII.
If u say experience,I have a lot about 'penguin'. FOOD is avarage here and will claim no extra mark. While the AMBIANCE is not up to the mark. AC is comfortable.
U Should Order special mixed fried rice (comes with a big omlette on it) with any chicken item. Chinese is purely kolkatan.
Among Indian items,chicken reshmi butter masala is a perfect one with tandoori ROTIS or lachha paratha.
One advice, don't order vegies because that will be a waste of money and labour of chewing. Otherwise penguin gives value for your money.

The best paneer dishes are paneer butter masala and chili paneer. but paneer butter masala contains a lots of oil. part from that they also frovide finest vinigar onions and chatni. it is a small restaurant but a must visit place.

Located in a busy street of Howrah the restaurant can be called average. The ambiance is nothing special. The Chicken Kadai, chapati, Fried rice are good. The Biryani is of average taste and a bit oily. The chicken Reshmi Kebab is seriously bad. It tastes sweet and hence cannot be enjoyed. The quantity of Biryani and fried rice are sufficient to feed one stomach!

An excellent destination for casual dining. A cosy ambience for a couple night out  and a pallete of menus to choose from.Penguin special chicken which is an array of chicken in spinach sauce, is a must have. Though both mughlai and Chinese preparations are equally good, Chinese lovers will be spoilt for choices of menus. Prawns cooked in sweet and sour sauces. Chopsouay, are worth mentioning. Overall a descent place for casual eat out with a potpourri of preparations from popular cuisines to choose from.

I got introduced to this place by a frnd of mine in 2011, who took me here for a treat! Well I really didn't expect much from this place, the ambience was not upto the mark and d waiters are also not prompt in service. Coming to its menu, it varies from Chinese to north Indian mughlai.. and from past two years I ve tried many of its dishes, one thing which I might wanna tell u that don try any non veg dishes here coz d meat s not properly cooked, has a particular smell of staleness. My first order was chicken Manchurian and it was yuckk! It was so bad I barely ate even 1 ball. And after that I ve never ordered any non veg items but then its my personal opinion abt penguin which disappointed me two years back, may be they hav revised some their recipes now. So u may check out few items as per your taste. I like crispy chilli baby corn, egg fried rice, veg manchurian in Chinese and in north Indian butter naan, masala kulcha, paneer butter masala. I once tried their biryani, nothing good abt it, simple plain taste which u ll also get off from the streetshops anywhere. The prices are very much affordable. For a single person, 100-150 is more than enough for this place.

The most disgusting restaurant i have ever been in my entire life.
Shabby and weary atmosphere. Un hygienic crockeries and most of the time foods are being served stale with a bit of pungent smell on it. Sometimes cockroaches might crawl over your feet and peep out to check on you from under the dirty ragged carpets !! *Disgusting*
The waiters seem half drunk most of the time, doesn't  pay a heed to your orders properly and makes a move like a turtle.
*Yawn* *Bad Service*

Been their only once and i swore to god that was my last footfall on Penguin.

The menu is too monotonous. No variation of food. Very cheap crowd all over. And yeah make sure anyone of you carry some good antidotes to keep your stomach alive otherwise you gotta run to the bathroom next morning ! * Warning *

There are so many better places to be at and experiment different foods.
A big NO NO for me !
And proudly, i would suggest 1.0/5. Sorry !


Just opposite to Penguin there is a place called " SIGN INN" which is incredibly contrasting than it.
Wide range of delicacies and yeah made my taste bud happy. Did not expect such a place in Howrah though but yeah its a nice place for the people out there.
Being a great foodie i suggest people to go and explore the food. Price is way reasonable and nice ambiance as well.
Yeah the service needs to be little more prompt but i hope they'll do more good.
Good luck to them !

Service is pathetic, waiters are not trained at all and don't know how to behave with customers. Chinese dishes are average while indian dishes are below average. Indian veg dishes has got lot of sugar.  Penguin special chicken is horrible,  fried rice items are well below average while noodle items are average.  Tandoor items are somewhat good. Although price has been kept low but that doesn't mean you need to bear unfriendly waiters who couldn't give you proper guidance, behave rudely and won't accept any negative feedback.
