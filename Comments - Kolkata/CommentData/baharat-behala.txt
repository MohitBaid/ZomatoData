Ordered two portion Chicken Biriyani online through a food delivery portal from this take away counter. Food was delivered a little late, but still it was luke warm.The food was packed in paper boxes, though nothing had spilled over.
Most kolkata Biriyani have an aroma of Kewra water, but this Biriyani had an aroma of grounded large cardamon.The Biriyani was lightly spicy, due to cardamon and cloves, which had also imparted a very different and distinct taste to the Biriyani.Portion size was good enough for one per portion, as Calcuttans we are voracious eaters of Biriyani. The Biriyani had the quintessential Alu, a herd boiled egg and leg piece of chicken. It was slightly oily, just enough to prevent the Biriyani from being dry.Over all it was a satisfying stomach expanding  experience . A portion of chicken Biriyani is at Rs 120/- a tad bit higher than other take away counters.A n 80% marking from my end just for the unique ness in taste.

Being pretty much near to my place, we order food from here most of the times. Pocket friendly, good home delivery service n quality of food is very good. I tried Chicken Biriyani, Chicken tikka kebab, Kadai chicken n Butter Naan. I would really prefer their Butter Naan n Kadhai Chicken time n again. Butter naan was really soft, Kadai chicken was excellent with tender chicken pieces n awesome spicy gravy. I would recommend this place for home delivery option.

This is a typical kolkattan local fast food joint. Good for people living around this spot for treating any surprise guests who might arrive at an odd time and you don't have any better options to get a take away or order a home delivery. Do not expect anything extraordinary.

Food: Food quatity is adequate but quality and hygene might come under question. I have a occasional egg roll or chicken roll or fish fingers from here and can't say that cooking is below average, so you will not be extremely disappointed if you have to eat here.

Service:Can't really expect much, but they have fast home delivery as I have witnessed...especially if you have a large order. But capacity is limited so if the delivery boy is already out it takes longer.

Ambiance: Typical

Verdict: Its okay to get a take away from here if you are not too concerned about quality or hygene like many of us foodies.

This take-away counter is at a stone's throw distance from my home at Jorapukur near Behala College, Parnasree, so I am a regular customer during weekends. They offer all kind of rolls, I had once tasted the egg-chicken roll and it was not bad. Don't go for chinese here, they mess up with the side dishes big time. Even a simple fried rice is not good, the noodles is still okay. Biryani is pretty average, available till 8.30pm, 9 max. I'm not happy with the mutton pieces they offer. My favorite is the Tandoori Chicken here. Extremely juicy, and the Hariyali Kebab is spiced up well. Most of the veg dishes are not available all the time. I have asked for palak paneer atleast on 3 occassions, they have always replied, not available today! Their mughai dishes are pretty nice. Although most of them taste the same, atleast the gravy items do. Kadai Chicken and chicken kassa are good, however I like Chicken Lajawab best. Chicken Bharta is one of the best I have ever had anywhere. Nicely shredder chicken, creamy texture, egg topping, good quantity. Decent place to order from, if you are a localite, at reasonable rates. No seating arrangement available. Cash only.

This place is just outside my house. They serve nearly everything, rolls, kebabs, Chinese, etc. The price is also reasonable for the quality and quantity provided. The staffs are very polite. A star less for the absence of dine in.
