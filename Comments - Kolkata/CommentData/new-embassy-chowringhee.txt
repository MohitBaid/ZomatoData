Visited this place with my wife for a late lazy lunch. 
Ambiance - nothing much to write home about. 
Decor - not much focus given by the management.
Food ordered - 
Fish finger : The dish was prepared from some cheap variety of Bhetki / Basa. It was not crisp, and so soggy that I lost my appetite with the very first bite. It was served with - yes, you read it right - a single piece of lemon. No onion, no tomato, no other ingredient from a normal green salad, but a single piece of lemon. Who sprinkles like juice over fish finger, that too an already soggy one?
Embassy special noodles - Full of oil. It was typical preparation from a road side stall. Chunk of tasteless and hard pieces of chicken, and one egg spread over already prepared veg chow mien. Awful to say the least. But the worst was yet to come.
Dry Chilly Chicken - They should name it crack-if-you-can-so-stiff chicken. Full stop.
Service - did not have to wait for long. There was hardly anyone there in the restaurant though.
Pocket pinch - Too pricy. The bill was 890/-. Simply felt very bad for ourselves.

One of kolkata's oldest Chinese restaurants. Upon entering the place the first impression is not very pleasant to be frank. But this place has seen batter days. Whatever the cause of its sorry state maybe, till date the Chinese owner has managed to keep its regular visitors honest. The food, needless to say is the main attraction. Although its menu has diminished since its glory days, but the authenticity of the dishes made today is still the same. Very few of Kolkata's Chinese restaurants serve such authentic chinese food. If you are around chowringee or at Nandan and looking for a place to have chinese you should give it a try. One reminder though. On weekdays its hard to get a table during lunch time because of the shortage of tables and high number of office people coming here for lunch.

A very old joint in chowringee area which serves authentic chinese food. They dont use tasting salt but the taste is genuinely like kolkata chinese. Nothing special about ambience, very old and shabby place but the food is top notch. Tried their egg chicken fried rice , garlic chicken and spring chicken.Quantity of fried rice was sufficient for two and it was on the drier side. Garlic chicken was sweet and tasty. Spring chicken was taken as parcel and it was ordinary in taste. Doesnt serve liqour and they dont have card payment facility which are a let down.

The name may be distracting as it's not new because I have visited the place since my childhood . It used to be very good back then but now I find it okay types . There chowmein is a gravy one but I found it gooey one. There Hakka chowmein a drier version is pretty good and the chili chicken is good too .

I've visited this place more that once and when I checked the ratings of this place, I was dumbfounded, 3.4 was a little low of what I expected. 
Now this place is expensive, not beautifully decorated and well an old timer but I firmly believe that it serves one of the best chinese dishes that I've had. 

Its the place I usually visit with my parents. Its a place where we can share our food and our thoughts. 

Anyways, the food, again, I believe is excellent. 
Prawn balls(dunno why it isn't there on the menu on zomato though I clearly remember I've eaten it here). 
 Its actually diced prawn in a doughy binding which I genuinely adore. 
For main course we usually order veg noodles, chicken fried rice and chilli chicken. 
The staples are usually good. 
The star, though is the chilli chicken. Those boneless diced pieces are perfect for that hot and spicy gravy. To me its what chilli chicken should be like unlike popular belief. Yeah, me! 
So overall, though I pay more (compared to other places), I have realised we do enjoy the meal here and thats what matter, doesn't it?
Do give it a try and comment what you liked over there.
Happy dining.

A very old restaurant on the chowringhee stretch, new embassy serves Chinese cuisine. From the exteriors the place looks like a typical Chinese restaurant but the interiors are disappointing. 
You can ignore the interiors provided the food is good but the food is just about okay. 
Paneer in garlic sauce, mushrooms, veg meifoon noodles are worth a try. 
Prices are relatively high if you compare it with the quality of food!

This place has never really changed and somehow is stuck in time. 

Overall, pretty average.

This is a terrible place. And I don't just mean the food,décor or the lack of the hospitality. Only thing good about this place is the location of it. They don't accept credit/debit cards too. The waiter who served us was so very reluctant to serve. The restaurant is a small place and it's neat. The food is no great shakes. I also want to mention this that when I had asked for some ice for my fresh lime soda,they said they don't have ice. Am very disappointed with this place.

New Embassy on Chowringhee is one of the last few remaining original Hakka Chinese Restaurants in Calcutta. The dim lighting and the ancient Chinese owner sitting behind the Cash counter completes the picture. Ask him what to eat - he tells you wryly - you won't like what I have - that is steamed rice and chicken with vegetables - so order what appeals to you. So we order the 3 items - on which you can't go wrong - Mixed Fried Rice, Pan-fried Noodles with Chicken and Vegetables, Fried Dry Chilli Chicken. Pity they no longer serve Pork and the Chicken comes boneless (which means it was pre-boiled and kept in the fridge) and not with bones which is usually more fresh. Overall, if you go there low on expectations and high in nostalgia - you won't be disappointed. No liquor tho.

This place has stood on chowringee road for a long time now and represents those old typical kolkata chinese restaurants. We went around in  the evening and the place was completely empty. Nothing mentionworthy about the decor and ambience( except for some chinese touches here and there), but it was clean.There was a single staff for service but he was quite efficient. Now for the food, we ordered 2each of special honey chicken, chicken spring rolls and mixed hakka noodles. The spring roles and noodles were good in taste with ample quantity, the honey chicken  was utterly delicious. It had ample amount of small juicy chicken pieces, tossed with honey and sesame seeds which gave it an exquisite flavour. So if in new embassy this is a dish i would highly recommend to the foodies out there. The price of the dishes are mostly in sync with the quality and quantity of  the food served. To summarize, if one can just overlook the ambience and decor for a while, this place is worth a visit for their food.

The chili chicken deserves a special mention truly. I have tried other items like schezwan chicken,fried chicken and cantonese noodles and found them quite average. Just go for their fried rice and chili chkn

The New Embassy is actually Old Embassy or even very Old Embassy.I have been seeing and visiting this place for years. 

This place belong to the old school and authentic format of Chinese restaurants in Kolkata which consist of generally first generation of Chinese ownership,little or no interiors,heavy air conditioning and sullen waiters who are efficient nonetheless.

We being a group of three,asked for the mandatory chicken fried rice and chilli chicken and the not so mandatory chicken chop suey and sweet and sour prawn.

I have mixed reactions.

The chilli chicken was brilliant.Delectable pieces of chicken in an authentic gravy with pieces of green chilli,it was one of the best I have had recently.So was the chicken fried rice which was flavourful with substantial pieces of chicken and plenty.

I did not taste the chop suey leaving the good work to the two lovely ladies who accompanied me.But going by their reactions it was nothing to write home about.The sweet and sour prawn was smelly,the prawns were too small and too sweet and left a sour taste in the mouth.( pun intended ).

However I see this place is strong with its staples and I wish this Kolkata landmark a couple of decades more of authentic survival before they morph into something monstrously contemporary.

If you are looking for a traditional and Authentic (yes with a capital A) Chinese food joint in Kolkata..here ends your search! Had been here umpteen times & inspite of the space crunch we thoroughly enjoyed each time! The food is salivatingly  tasty to our Indian palate,count them on this.  No alcohol here but hearty food at its best. Anniversary celebration of my sister definitely had to be here & so was it! Family time can never be more fulfilling than with good food & so it was. Though they disappointed us only this time with an american chop suey which was cooked in sticky smelly old oil & caused much health trouble..& the complaint remained unanswered :( wish they didn't let me down this way as I had suggested enthusiastically this place. But save a rare occasion like this..double thumbs up to our good 'ol chap!

The prices are not equivalent to the food they provide. Childhood favourite. But the scenario have changed now.
Fried Prawns, Special Mixed Chowmein and Chilli Prawn you will love this three dishes. 
But recently the taste of the dishes have drastically fallen which is very disappointing.
Once upon a time this eatery was very pocket friendly to young couples and unfortunately it is no more. 
.Prompt Service
.Friendly Staff.
.Peaceful ambience
.Parking friendly area

once in a while you can just give a try, wont recommend.

Had heard a lot about this restaurant , but tried this place only a couple of weeks back and honestly, ended up disappointed.

The place is very average. The service is fast though. The serving size is good but the prices are pretty high compared to what I would expect from such a place. Moreover the food quality is nothing exceptional either. I tried their fried rice and manchurian, and though they tasted good, I did not find them so much moneys worth.

I have been to this place more than 30 times maybe. I don't know what it is so unique about new embassy but I just love visiting this place. There is nothing extraordinary about the decor, just a large aquarium is all that catches the eye. But its this somewhat muted atmosphere that makes it such a pleasing place to just enjoy the food. It definitely makes the best Manchurian chicken that one can find, and its the uniqueness in every dish that makes it so special. The chop suey, the fried chicken, even the simple steamed momo seems to be special here. The service is satisfactory but the prices are unfortunately on the higher side. However new embassy draws us to its doors at least once a fortnight if not more. There is nothing about this place that I hate, its a perfect place to sit n eat in peace and its quite unfortunate it is rated so lowly in zomato.

Embassy is a small eatery run by a Chinese family.As it is just below my office I generally end up ordering from there on days when I have a craving for Chinese.The set up is nothing to write about.In fact it comes across as pretty gloomy.Somehow I seem to like some of their dished as compared to other so called Chinese restaurants.I really like their Embassy special soup, the steamed chicken momos and my favourite out of the lot is their Steamed Chicken with vegetables and rice which is a complete meal in itself.Although I have not experimented much with their dishes and stuck mainly to my favourites , I have so far enjoyed their food.

Though it isn't what it once was anymore, the ambience and the fish noodles is tasty.

New Embassy has suffered a slow and steady death.A very very sad demise I must say.It used to be one of my favourite restaurants when I was a kid.We used to visit this place very often and there was hardly any item that we did not taste or for that matter any item we did not like.It used to serve delicious Chinese food at very reasonable prices.All the items from fried rice and chowmein to soups,momos and the side dishes including duck used to be pretty good.It used to be comparable to China town.The place though small had a typical Chinese restaurant feel about it and the large aquarium which was rather unique used to fascinate me when I was a kid.But over the years the place has had a steady decline.
Today neither the quality of the food nor the value for money bit is enough to draw people here.There are numerous other better options available.Since it was one of my favourite places,I wish it could get back to what it used to be but unfortunately I do not see that happening.

An authentic chinese outlet which one must try if food is the only thing that matters to you. Ambience from outside gives you the chinese feel, but inside its small, dark and so so. But it has its history to fall back on. Food I will have to say is good. Momo's are worth trying so are the soups, Soups I would say are a must try. Loved them everytime that I have been there or even during take aways. So if you are looking for a place outside ChinaTown which gives you good chinese food then do try New Embassy. And it isnt heavy on the pocket either.

One of the few Chinese restaurant which still has a Chinese owner. Very authentic food but equally expensive. Try the pork side dishes

I remember my father used to bring food from over here. It was around 20 years ago, but i still have memories of enjoying food from this place. To revive those good old memories, i went back to this place, and now i have new memories, the kinds of which are less likely to take me back over there. 
This place serves tangra type Chinese, so no complaints on the sticky round rice. As a matter of fact, i like that kind, but the main disappointment was the food quality and quantity. New embassy adds up to the list of many alike restaurants which have faded with the passage of time.

I was just randomly checking out restaurants in chowringhee when suddenly I saw new embassy and all my memories of school days came rushing. 
I remember this place used to be on our go to list for special occasions... In fact my entire group had our last lunch here on out farewell. 
This place equals tons of excellent memories for me. 
The moment I saw this I texted my friend and we soon decided to meet here for lunch ... 
We reached here around 3:30 on a Wednesday afternoon and the place was empty. Not a surprise. 
We quickly placed our order... Crispy chilli baby corn, chilli paneer gravy n noodles. 
The baby corn was a little oily for our taste n as usual it lacked salt... We've had this problem from day one here so it's just nothing new. It's probably bcz of the Chinese management. Or so we guess. 
Next came the noodles n the chilli paneer. 
The chilli paneer was great but the noodles were a great disappointment. It had the smell of egg n me being a vegetarian, I had a hard time with it. 
It was bland n sticky. Thank god the paneer was good... 

After finishing our lunch we still sat there like shameless ppl till we ran out of things to say (n were just plain scared that the owner might be losing his patience ) .
Called for the bill n it came a whopping 700 bucks. Silly of me, I was still expecting the old prices. Nonetheless, the prices weren't worth the quality of food served. 

Coming to the service, it was okay. Nothing so great, but nothing bad either. 

How I wish the place had not lost it's old charm...!

New Embassy used to serve excellent Chinese food but my last visit there disappointed me ..... and unless I get some very positive feedback its going to be a long wait for me to head back there. The decor is nothing to get excited about with the aquarium being the only noteworthy point. The boneless chilly chicken,  special chowmein and chicken fried rice and chicken meinfoon are just about average. There are far better options at that price range available in the city.

his place is the closest you can reach to having a meal in a house in the bylanes of beijing.

this eatery has hardly evolved over the years and is well known among the office goers in the locality. 

coming to the food the steamed rice with chicken n vegetables is my staple order here and am never disappointed. its filling has a subtle taste profile to rejuvenate you after a taxing day at work.
do try the hot and sour soup . its contrasting flavours are well balanced .
the chopsuey , pork chowmein n garlic chicken suit my palate perfectly.

no credit cards accepted here sign is bit of a problem .

not outstanding but good for office lunches.

P.S. - get a seat close to aquarium to enhance your fooding experience

Located at an ‘unfortunate’ or not-so-strategic position, this restaurant probably exists through recommendations now. I have many foodie friends, but only a handful of them have ever visited this place. Its right at the middle of Maidan and Rabindra Sadan metro station. Also, its not at an happening area.

However, the place has been there for decades now and obviously there must be something that has got it going.

Décor - Went there along with 15 people and there was hardly any plave left for other guests to come in. It is congested and the only attempt to look smart is the fish aquarium. This place is more about having a ‘nostalgic’ feel. 

Menu –yes you have a wide range of choice, but nothing more than what you will not find in any other Chinese restaurant. 

Price, Quantity & Food – I would say its slightly on the pricier side, but a single dish can serve two people.
Food is good and you do get a feel of authentic Chinese dishes here. The soups make a desperate attempt to being very tasty, but it sits comfortably in the group of being tasty. Also, you will be spoilt for choices the soups got. However, the starters and side dishes can boast how tasty they are and Fried Chicken, Chicken with Soya Sauce, Mandarin Fish and Chicken and Shrimp Mein Foon are worth the try. However, avoid Pork. It was a disappointment for us.

You also have lot of choices for noodles and rice and you are assured to get an authentic Chinese feel in them.

The restaurant is a good office-hour lunch option. Wish the prices come down a bit.

This quaint little restaurant is located bang opposite St. Paul's Cathedral on chowringhee road. Its a small chinese restaurant was quite famous in its day. Their claim of serving authentic Chinese cuisine is probably supplanted by the fact that a Chinese family still runs it. Although Like most such restaurants across the city where the fading Chinese diaspora holds the rein, this place was once much better than it is now. 
The place has minimal ambience and the decorations and few chinese lanterns are covered in dust; the cutlery is however clean. The menu is quite large with regular items as well as other exotic  dishes. The soups menu is absolutely fantastic. The rice and noodles section also cover a huge range. The Hakka Chowmein was quite good and the chilli chicken tasted like no other that i've ever had. The authentic chinese flavour in each of the dishes were unmistakable. Order the plain chinese dishes that you have always eaten but never with the dash of flavours that make chinese cuisine what it is. Don't order the rolls if you're not too adventurous.
You can always find a handful of old Chinese people sitting there reading a newspaper or smoking. Its a pleasure talking to them. Food is never late. The portions are more than big. The downside is that for whatever inexplicable reason, they charge way more than they ought to.

Chakraborty Tip : Going there in a large group may be more profitable as the VAT they charge is a pittance at only 4 % as against 13.5 % elsewhere.

NEEDS IMPROVEMENT

Its oriental style roof -at the front of the restaurant - screams out loud that it is a Chinese restaurant. It is located near the St Paul's Cathedral and is easily reachable from any part of Kolkata. But this is not a place that you would love to come back, once you have sampled their food. Unlike a Beijing or a Big Boss there is nothing glamorous about the ambience and decor of New Embassy restaurant. It is a very simple and plain looking restaurant. It is also not crowded like some of the restaurants in Tangra. The reasons are not difficult to comprehend. They do have a lot to offer but even that leaves much to be desired. The Prices are bit on the higher side compared to the food quality and quantity being offered here.

For your soup you can either order for their Chicken Clear Soup or their Hot and Sour Soup. The soup is mildly hot but with all the ingredients that you require in this kind of soup in okay amount. The chicken clear soup tastes very strongly of the broth which a soup of this kind is supposed to taste like. I cannot guarantee the taste of other soups. You can follow this up with their Chicken Fried Rice and Chilli Chicken. For the last dish, I would have loved the chicken pieces to be less spicy and the pieces bigger and more in number. The other chicken dishes that I found satisfactory were Manchurian Chicken, Spring Chicken and Chicken in Garlic Sauce. Even their seafood items are not up to the standard of many of the Chinese restaurants that I have been to. Because their portions are so small; you end up ordering more here in order to satisfy your hunger.

Well, this is absolutely an average restaurant.
Prices are bit high compared to the food quality and quantity.
I disliked the chinese mixed soup.It was horrible.
The chicken fried rice and manchurian chicken was satisfactory.
The Lemon Sauce Chicken was still okay.
Ambience is very ordinary.
The only thing which i liked was chicken clear soup and fried chicken.
Overall an okay restaurant.
