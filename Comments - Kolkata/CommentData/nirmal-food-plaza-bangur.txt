When it comes to South Indian Dishes, then NFP is an ideal choice. They are specialist in preparing mouthwatering hot dosas and that 2 in wallet friendly prices. Tried their cheese and masala dosas for breakfast today via swiggy. The dosa was perfectly wrapped in oil paper and masala stuffing was beautifully packed in aluminium foil box. The hot tangy sambar came in tight sealed container. After having their dosa, fwor the feeling of having dosa in a 5 star restaurant. So , after many days my search for ideal dosa outlet came to an end and am definitely bookmarking it for future home delivery orders. Kudos NFP and keep up the good work. ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ
