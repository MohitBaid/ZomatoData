Few years back this place used to serve only Biryani & Chap & at that time it was one of the best in the Rs. 70 segment in Howrah area. Yes their Biryani was super cheap & still it is. Biryani is made outside, on road & the restaurant doesn't seems so clean too. The tables, chairs & everything is too dirty that you may think twice before getting sited into this small restaurant. Hygiene is extremely bad & not at all preferable in any situation.

However everything was working fine then suddenly they started to serve other dishes too. Now they have added Tandoor, Kebabs & Rolls into their menu card & after this some rocket science happened & their quality of Biryani got degraded to a worst level just like their dirty environment of the restaurant. Their Biryani is made out of very low grade rice & not at all well cooked. Chicken pieces are not soft & dried out from inside that makes it seem not fresh at all. Their chap has became worst too. Its too spicy & note made up with cleanness at all. Chicken piece of chap doesn't tasted good enough like before.

Once upon a time good quality Biryani was the main interest of this place. But now when that only good point is gone so its not at all recommend by respecting your health.

Have just 70 rupees in pocket, hop in.
You will get good quantity of chicken biryani at this price. The hygiene of the place is not so good. Keep an eye out for small hairs on the plate. They don't even properly wash them. These problems apart, they make the best of the locality egg chicken roll at Rs. 35. I don't know how they manage it, but the roll is totally worth it.

Located at kaji pari, near avani riverside mall. Came here once, to try their chicken biriyani, this place does not maintain proper hygiene, price is very low, quantity is better.

I had chicken biryani at this place (costs 60 bucks).  The quantity was decent and the chicken piece was also good. Didnt like the excess dalda flavour. Not a good idea to have biryani unless you have that strong temptation and there's nowhere else to go.
