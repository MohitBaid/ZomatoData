This is a pure veg restaurant located at the Acropolis mall food court. The food is yummy and more or less affordable unlike the other options over there. Their papri chaat and sabz galawti kabab with ulta tawa ka paratha are amazing. I had no idea that galawti kebab could be veg and this tasty..

It is located in the 3rd floor of Acropolis mall in food court.They don't accept cash.You have to make card to buy anything.You will be paying a lot of taxes twice,during making the card,again when you order something.However I ordered for a Chola paneer Biriyani.It was well cooked though the rota wasn't good enough.Will try their other dishes on another day.

I've picked up food from this counter at the Acropolis mall's food court quiet a few times. They make one of the most amazing paneer tikkas around that area, the quality of paneer they use is really nice. I've had their Dahi kebab which is kind of sad.Their chole bhature is decent, edible I would say. Service is quick and they deliver via swiggy too!

We had a craving for Chola Bature and had it. Two pieces of Bature and one bowl of chola is good for evening snacks. It is ok, not extraordinary taste-wise.
