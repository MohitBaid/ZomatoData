Went there on Christmas.  The place is nice.  Ordered pawbhaji and chola bhuttra and cold coffee. The food was the good.  The rooftop view is more attractive.

Location: Satyajit Ray Dharani (close by). Its an old place.

Pros: 
Astonishing Rooftop view & hot noodles.
(Specially, the night view.)
Clean.
Not much overcrowded. So, peace for sure.

Cons: 
Service not so commendable.

Else, it's really good one to hang out with friends & family, without bullying the pocket.

Manager at the counter has no clue how to treat a customer. Booked space for around 20 people from 10 am. We asked him to take order at 9.56 am but very rudely he says that "lok aasche...10 ta pore!"

Things have gone downhill here.

The quality of food delivered was very poor. Sambhar and chutney provided were insufficient. Furthermore, the billing done by restuarant was more than that done by Zomato while ordering online. This is a bitter experience for us as we regularly order online. We wish that something be done to rationalise this issue.

This place is famous for it's Dosa varieties and pizza! Make sure you taste both! The chutneys are really very delicious! Also, the size is quite decent so, a Dosa can be easily shared amongst 2. Mosquitoes might me a problem though. The slow music and natural air is a bliss!

I have been to this roof top restaurant thrice. We ordered their dhania and moghlai  dosa all the three times because these are that delicious. Their these two types of dosas are must haves. Apart from dosa we ordered enchilada once which was ok. I have tried their American ice cream soda and cola float but those were total disappointment. Normal coffee or cold drinks would be smarter choice. --- with

Well. I visited this place yesterday with my girlfriend. Heard a lot about this place. If I go with one word, it was pathetic. The only eye cathing thing, probably the rooftop, was not in cards 'cause of rain. We took a table in the interior. We ordered a mixed pizza and a chocolate shake. It didn't take much time though but the food stuck inside our throat. Well, the pizza was dried up with nothing in it. No good toppings rather. And the shake was just okay. 
Well, my experience was pathetic out there and I would suggest everyone not to go there. The price rates are high and isn't worth a penny.

Located in one of the prime location in Elgin Road. The place a great view from the roof top. But the place hugely underutilized. They could have used the place in a better manner but needs huge renovation. A bit less rating because of the get up of the place.
 One can sit outside or else they also have a Air Conditioned area. 
The service of the place is quite good and they are quick with the serving.
A veg restaurant with quite good taste of food. 
We ordered Cheese dhaniya Dosa (which they said is their speciality), mushroom pizza and fresh lime soda.
The dhaniya Dosa is quite different and should be a must try.
A perfect way to spend a nice evening.

Nice restaurant. Very near to my office. We ordered masala paper dosa and mushroom pizza. The food quality was very good. The dosa was crispy and nice, simply loved loved digging into it. The pizza was a thin crust pizza with nice and juicy mushrooms. Not much fond of south indian food. But the restaurant made me think otherwise. Will surely recommend it to everyone.

We had -
Capsicum onion pizza - it was delicious. One of the best pizza ever. Soft yet crunchy with oozing cheese.
Had lot of topping.
Enchilands - it was too sour for my taste. But yummy. My friends liked it.
Recommended visit.

Nice place with good view and ambience. It has a rustic old world feel.  situated just a few blocks from forum mall and brand factory , the place is neatly tucked in vaibhav plaza beside Lee banquets on Lee road. The decoration is minimal, the view is good and food is the necessary evil. It isn't a luxury but a comfort you can't live without. We had a 8 in 1 pizza which has different types of topings mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, capsicum, beans all in different section. We liked the mushroom one the best. It had the perfect blend of flavours. Overall a comfortable place, precious like your good night

Rooftop ambiance with soothing music and veg food

Food: The food served here is completely veg. However, Dosas, vadas as well as burgers, pizzas r available. We ordered a Mysore Dosa and a Paper Butter Masala Dosa. The Mysore Dosa is a tricky dosa to cook and they cooked it damn well. The paper butter masala dosa was also well cooked. After the dosas, we ordered Cold coffee with ice cream which was pretty good as well. The portion size was fulfilling and the taste was up to the mark.

Ambiance: This is where they score the best. They have an open air part and an air conditioned part. We, obviously chose the open terrace to sit. Being located at the heart of the city, they offer an awesome view of the city. And it normally remains very windy in the terrace. The music played is soothing and doesn't hinder ur conversations. Very romantic place to be in the evenings.

Service: The service is pretty smooth and fast. Cash and card both r available. Parking is available. However, the entrance to the cafe is a bit tricky. U have to search for vaibhav plaza and when u reach the place u have to ask the security guard about the restaurant to locate the lift.

Overall: An awesome restaurant with beautiful ambiance and supportive staff. The prices are reasonable and do not burn a hole in the pocket. WIll definitely be returning to taste their dosas in the evening sunlight. :)

We had wanted to visit this rooftop place, for quite some time now, and yesterday, since we were in the area, we thought of giving this place a try. Firstly, locating 
the entrance to this place might just catch you off guard, just like it did for us, with google maps showing a different entrance rather than the main entrance which is one Lee Road itself. When you make your way up to the sixth floor, however, you are bound to feel good. The abundant night sky, along with the moderately lit roof top housing the cafe, is by itself a mood lifter. The day we had visited, was sultry hot and humid and we were a bit anxious of whether choosing a place without AC in this weather was a good idea. But, since the place is located on the sixth floor, there was adequate wind, enough to prevent you from feeling uncomfortable. There is an AC hall in one side, but on the day of our visit, there was some birthday parties going on there hence the AC hall was beyond access. But, again, it was quite windy up there and you could actually feel the wind against your face. Coming to the food, we had ordered Paper Masalla Dosa, Paneer Garlic Pizza and soft drinks to go with it. The dosa was okay, nothing special worth mentioning. So we would rate it as 3/5. But the pizza was really a good one. None of us are very fond of veg food but this paneer garlic pizza, despite being a veg item, was actually a great one. Rating it a 5/5. So, in total food would contribute to 4/5 rating for the place. But, for the entire package, including ambiance, the rooftop feeling, the staff members behaviour and efficiency etc, promptness of service among others, we would like to rate the place a pretty high 4.5/5. This is our opinion about this place, and do check this place out if you havent already.

I was quite amazed to find this place... A rooftop restaurant in the very heart of the city.
It was rather a cloudy and uncomfortable afternoon but the view still great.
The eating space consists of two sections .. the air conditioned segment and the open air rooftop.
Coming to the food.... Very regular.... Nothing special at all. Almost the kind of stuff you have at those multiple small eateries near the colleges.
Overall ......a decent place if u want to experience roof- top-eating in the heart of a metro.

My review of The Rooftop View restaurant in its entirety is more indicative of the location and the subtle dining experience rather than just food and service.
When you park yourselves in the open dining area, the seats and tables look a little worn out, the dinnerware might not seem all that impressive as well, but every tangible thing set aside, the view, the experience is ethereal. It felt like we had entered a sanctum filled with tranquillity and you actually sink into the environment. Amidst the hustle and bustle and yet so distant, and yes somethings don't age, like the mesmerising view and the winds swirling across your face.
If you do visit this restaurant ever, famous for south Indian cuisine, do try Dhania Dosa and Pizzas.

Just love the dosas they make e.g. Cheese dhania dosa and rava masala dosa. Been here a hell lot of times. The roof top view at night adds to its ambience thats all of it. Banana shake and freah lime soda here make a good siders for south indian dishes. Also try paw bhaaji here. They are good too.
U will fall in love with this place and their food, i tell u. Just love this place.

Rooftop Top View is located at Elgin, Kolkata. It mainly serves quick bites and shakes .

Ambience is spacious, cool with good sitting arrangenents. It has outdoor seating at rooftop.

Service is prompt.

Tried Dhania dosa & cold coffee with ice cream . Dosa was nice and yummy. Cold coffee was average, nothing to rave about.

Prices are reasonable.

A nice place to have snacks & refreshments.

I visited this place on Sunday afternoon..
It's located near Rabindra Sadan metro station..On Lee road..
It's located on 6th floor..
When I visited this place there were held a Birthday party...It's a good place for party purpose...
Okay now coming to foods..I ordered 1 paw bhajhi with extra paws.. Because we were two..Paw bhajhi was very taste ...
After that I ordered 1 dhania dhosa..Dhania dhosa is their well known dish...It was also tasteful and served well...And also cold drinks..
Lastly ,, i ordered 1 trutty fruity...
All were good...
Foods were really good..
But they should improve their management..
Lack of management..
Like ,, when I ordered cold drinks...the cold drinks was ready to serve on their table...But no one served it..I asked for served..Then they served it...
Another one..I paid the bill by card..But their swip machine didn't working... They swiped 4-5 times & they continually tried ..Which I really disliked...
Lack of management ..Which they should improve ...
Otherwise the place quite good..
The view from the roof really nice..I captured some pictures of sunset... You can see Tata Steel building.. AJC Bose flyover..
Now,,, I want to suggest that they should change their cost for two option ,, which is 300/-... That is totally wrong..
They charged extra tax and vat.. Soo your bill automatically will be increased..
Soo don't expect that it is a inexpensive place....Yes I approve that the prices of food are reasonable but after adding tax and vat it may be increased..
And also the waiter's will charge you for giving them tips.... Before you gave them they will literally asked you for tips..
The behaviour of the waiter's and managers is not soo good..Very rude behaviour of them..Which I disliked..
I gave 3 star just for the food and the place (rooftop)..
Otherwise I didn't give 3stars..

Visiting this place for many years. This was one of the initial rooftop restaurants in town if not first. No one can prepare a better dhaniya dosa then this place, its always on order at every visit. It has an AC section as well, but the open roof is what has made this place famous. Parties are also organized here. Other things worth ordering are noodles and sandwiches. This place wont disappoint. Apt time to visit this place is after sunset and specially in winter's. Don't get confused with a similar sounding restaurant nearby.

Having seen this restaurant in a few Bengali movies, we tried to find this restaurant and then visited it...Its situated at the rooftop of a shopping plaza...with a AC sitting area and open terraces...A nice view of the Kolkata skyline during the sunset times is at your disposal...The room is not that good.. Its small but serves the purpose during rainy seasons..
 Food was pretty average...It's pocket friendly...But you don't have much choices...The service was okay...
Altogether the view is what this restaurant is mostly known for..If you want to have amazing food this isn't the place...The ones who love coffee and want to see the sunset are the people you will find here...

We were confused between the different types of dosa, so asked one of the waiters to explain the differences. He was unable to do so and got irritated. Later, we ordered for mysore dosa and dhaniya dosa.. which was tasty.

Having seen this restaurant in a few Bengali movies, we tried to find this restaurant and then visited it...Its situated at the rooftop of a shopping plaza...with a AC sitting area and open terraces...A nice view of the Kolkata skyline during the sunset times is at your disposal...The room is not that good.. Its small but serves the purpose during rainy seasons..
 Food was pretty average...It's pocket friendly...But you don't have much choices...The service was okay...
Altogether the view is what this restaurant is mostly known for..If you want to have amazing food this isn't the place...The ones who love coffee and want to see the sunset are the people you will find here...

Visited this place few days back with my friend. This place is best for evenings. There are lots of option in south indian cuisine. We were confused between the different types of dosa, so asked one of the waiters to explain the differences. He was unable to do so and got irritated. Later, we ordered for mysore dosa and dhaniya dosa.. which was tasty.

If the view won't fill your soul, the coffee certainly will. Rooftop Topview is located on Lee Road, and is one of the most relaxing places in the city. It is pocket friendly and the service is good. Food is decent as well, but the real joy of the restaurant comes when you check in with a few friends, order a cup if coffee and just sit back, relax and enjoy the sunset. I hope I can catch the view the next time I come here :)

This place and a cloudy blue Kolkata sky in the evening go hand in hand. The rooftop view is a beautiful place. It has good food. We ordered
1. 8 cups of coffee (twice for each person cuz the coffee is awesome)
2. American Cheese Burger which was okay I guess, but I think they shouldn't give too much mayonnaise. It kills the taste of the cheese. Its not a mayonnaise burger. 
3. Plain Dosa: uncomplicated and great to taste.
4. Tacos: A disaster. Topped with chopped cabbage instead of cheese? That is a recipe for disaster.
5. Butter idly: Nothing special. The difference between this and the regular idly is that this idly has a few drops of butter on it. That's it. No difference in taste.
6. Pav Bhaaji: Its not a Mexican dish but seems to be grouped under one. That said, the menu is cumbersome. The pav bhaaji however, isn't. It's tasty.

Would I go again? Yes! A beautiful sunset should be seen with a cup of coffee from this place.

Rooftop Top View has been around for a long time, earlier when restaurant options were limited this was a popular place but now with so many better options available this place has competition. But most people who do visit appreciate their food, especially their Dhaniya Dosa. I had it and it was great. The chutney and sambaar too were good. The mixed pizza too was good. But what is off-putting is that they served in plastic....the cold drinks and water in plastic glasses. The waiters too were quite slow. We were sitting in he enclosed AC area, they also have open sitting area from where you can view the cityscape. They have a separate party area which is almost always booked for birthday parties and probably responsible for their profitable venture.

If u want pocket friendly, good quality vegetarian food and above all, enjoy the beautiful view of the city then this is the apt place.. this restaurant has got two seating options.. either u sit on the roof which is very clean and beautiful.. or u sit inside the air conditioned restaurant.. but we really enjoyed the roof top seating arrangement as the weather was very nice and breezy...
Now, coming to food..we ordered
1) two cheese mushroom dosas
2) a cold coffee and
3 a badam sharbat..
Oh, i loved the dosas.. the dosa was literally over loaded with cheese and mushroom and it tasted heaven.. it was huge so as we ordered two.. we two, were having serious difficulty in having it...
The badam sharbat was good in taste but nothing extraordinary...
The cold coffee was good as well... overall, the place was pretty good with a good view.. so i absolutely loved it..
An evening coffee with ur friends in a wonderful breezy weather enjoying the city view will be a pure bliss, so really looking forward to it..

If you are looking for pocket friendly vegetarian food with a great view of the city then this is the place for you. Though people might say that the food quality has diminished but in my opinion its still one of the best places in the city to have vegetarian food without burning a hole in your pocket. The ambiance is quite nice and south Indian food is a must have if you come to this establishment. We ordered the butter masala dosa and the cheese mushroom garlic dosa. Both of the dishes were tasty , not too oily and the drinks were awesome too. 
Overall a nice place to frequent with friends with good food and great ambiance with a view of the city. :)

A small joint on the rooftop of some building, which is hard to find if you don't know the place from before. The entrance, the staff n the menu all seemed laid back and unwelcoming . however the view from the roof, and the food served is on the money. Yes the food can be improved on but given the condition of the overall management of the place I feel that's the only saving grace. Good place to relax n chill out but don't expect more.

Was really tasty. Crisp but not oily.
The only  sad part ...they didn't have podi the iconic powder without which the south Indian cuisine is a little bereft...

Widely known for their south Indian, the rooftop top view or rooftop as everyone calls it is one of the oldest places for snacks and addas for vegetarians. They were probably the first ones to introduce so many variations to the humble Dosa in the city. Their masala Dosa is delicious but their dhania Dosa is a star dish and they make it the best. The sandwiches are also good here and so are the shakes. The continental section needs a marathon improvement but somehow their dishes are preferred by many. 
The staff is cordial. 
The rooftop ambiance makes up for the minimalist decor.
One of the better options for office lunch I'm the vicinity.

Rooftop top view is one of the most well-known restaurants around. It is on the 6th floor of vaivabh plaza, near the brand factory outlet on Elgin road. They have both indoor and outdoor seating arrangement. And this is a veggie only restaurant.

Okay so coming to ROOFTOP, the view from there is certainly a marvellous one. If you love Kolkata, you'd love the view. It's probably a better option to go for indoor dining during daytime because of obvious reasons. 

I am not a huge fan of veggie restaurants but at the same time I adore south Indian food. Thankfully this restaurant offers a wide range of South Indian food. Me and my friend ordered a Dhania Dosa and a Mexican pizza. Both were tasty and quantity wise good too. The service is something to look forward to as well.  I had a great experience. Will visit again for sure. :)

Its on the 6th floor of Webtek Labs Building..The roof top is beautiful but it was midday and sunny so we sat inside, even the interior was pretty cool.. The food is pocket friendly,vegetarian and of nice quality..
Cheese Mushroom dhosa was,well, cheesy so was the pizza..The paw bhaji had a nice heavy texture and good taste. The Taco shells were tiny,so I was not satisfied with 2 servings a plate.

It is on the 6th floor of an almost abandoned shopping mall at Lee Road (2 mins from brand factory outlet at Elgin Road). Locating the place wasn't difficult at all. They have both interior and open seating arrangements. The day we visited was pretty breezy so we opted to sit in the open. I like the dim lighting and it's pretty quiet. You can enjoy a good conversation here. Coming to the food, they are priced moderately and are really tasty. We tried the dhaniya dosa and plain idly. The dhaniya twist gave the monotonous masala dosa a zing! Service is a bit on the slowish side. Overall a great place to hangout if you like to spend a quiet evening over south Indian cuisine. 

Only con: Cleanliness of the tables.

Though this place is not difficult to locate, somehow the idea of setting up a restaurant on top of a lesser (or almost unknown) mall did not appeal to me.

I was there with a group of friends on a Sunday evening. I found the ambiance pretty gloomy. What could have been a romantic/beautiful place as the sun went down over the horizon, it turned out to be a semi dark rooftop with few tables arranged here & there.

The menu offers a range of simple veg food. Nothing great about it. Price is reasonable.

I ordered a masala dosa paying extra for a special chutney, there was no special chutney as such. The sambar had no veggies at all, plane liquid with hardly any trace of dal. The dosa was bit salty for me. It's a NO for dosa atleast. I don't know about other food.

Been to Rooftop Top View numerous times. It's a decent place, and mostly empty on lunch time. The open space is great during winter evenings, or when there is a nice breeze. The food is good as well. My favorites are the Dhania dosa, Enchiladas, Tacos and the pizza. 
They started serving Chinese as well. I tried the Hakka noodles, and it was great. Next time, I'll try the rest of the dishes on the Chinese menu.

The food available is vegeterian, so we didn't order anything from the foods :p (sorry strictly non-vegeteraians we are). So we ordered cold coffee with ice cream & milk shake with ice cream, which were nice. The ambience is nice for friends hangout.

Service: Good but gets a bit slow during rush. 

Food: Fully vegetarian. Their Sandwiches and cold coffees are to die for. Even the pizza is so yummy with thin and crispy crust. 

Pocket Pinch: Very reasonable pricing.

I became very nostalgic after entering the gate of Rooftop because they still remain the same I used to experience 16 yrs ago.

* Location : Just 5 mins walking from Exide mor towards Lee rd, everyone knows VAIBHAV PLAZA. The Roof Top is located at the top of this plaza.

* Ambience : Its more popular for its cool cool roof top ambience than its food. Very spacious, they still put on old days chairs and tables. Surrounded by trees you ll have a very good view of setting sun and also a good view of always busy Elgin rd. Photographers, selfie lovers, romantic couples even a bunch of school, college students will like the ambience so much.
They also have air conditioned room if you don't like to sit and eat in open space. But the roof top open space ambience always deserves 10 on 10.

* Food : I took those dishes that I used to take 15 yrs ago so I can compare the taste easily.
1. butter masala dosa.( Taste degraded. I don't think potato feeling was very fresh). (rating 5 on 10)
2. American Club Sandwich. ( Taste is the same,but breads get thinner and vegetables inside,especially tomatoes were not fresh). (rating 5 on 10)
3. Cheese pizza. ( it was more or less better than previous ones. Crispy,thin bread, lots of cheese inside). (rating 7 on 10)
4. Veg burger. ( yes, it was good to see huge burger breads before eating, but after a bite I personally didn't like it,though my friends were not agreed with me. (rating 6 on 10)
5. Cold Coffee with ice cream. (The taste remains the same as it was 15 yrs before. Very good. Good quality and quantity of ice cream they provide) (rating 8 on 10)
6. Mango Milk shake. ( The shake was very good also, I liked its taste so and so much). (rating 10 on 10)
7. Normal Lassi. ( This was also good, no complains) (rating 8 on 10)

* Management : I couldn't find any reason why the management is not doing anything with the food quality when there are bunch of very good restaurants giving them a tight competition. I think this old and very famous roof top food joint is trailing behind by far in this competition.

* Recommendation : I only can recommend this food joint for very good romantic ambience and its an ideal waiting place for your dear ones or friends if you are uncomfortable waiting for hours on the road. You can sit an hour or 2 with only a glass of shake,no one will bother you. All kinds of shakes, cold coffee is very good still now, otherwise I m a bit disappointed after stepping the rooftop after long years.

* Management : I couldn't find any reason why the management is not doing anything with the food quality when there are bunch of very good restaurants giving them a tight competition. I think this old and very famous roof top food joint is trailing behind by far in this competition.

* Recommendation : I only can recommend this food joint for very good romantic ambience and its an ideal waiting place for your dear ones or friends if you are uncomfortable waiting for hours on the road. You can sit an hour or 2 with only a glass of shake,no one will bother you. All kinds of shakes, cold coffee is very good still now, otherwise I m a bit disappointed after stepping the rooftop after long years.

We visited this place on a fine day..the place was quite pleasant and the atmosphere was also impressive.But unfortunately the food was awful and the worst we have ever experienced. We ordered for pizza and pastas,pasta was still OK.!
But the pizza was like a toast biscuit..! 
Just hate it !

Located at the top floor of Vaibhav Plaza near Lee banquets,this place covers the entire terrace with a major portion offering an outdoor seating and only a few tables are arranged for the air conditioned indoor seating. Most people may not know about this place as it is more or less empty. Given the amazing roof top seating and pocket friendly food options,this place can be a delight in winters! 

It's a nice place for a class bunk or a college hangout and please avoid this place if you want to treat your friends or have a celebration,there are way better places in the vicinity!

We came here a few days back after a very long time. Used to come here and have the enchiladas and the South Indian items here. We had mixed feelings coming here. The enchiladas have gone down in quality as have the sambar - its extra sweet and sour at the same time. However the Dhania Masala Dosa is still exquisite. Recommended only for the dosa.

Being honest , i must say i liked the view and the surrounding only . Food quality was on average .
Come on now , u can't expect everything in a single bucket right , but i must say one can easily enjoy the sunset with his family/friends/special ones in that place .. For me its a very unique place where u can enjoy the atmosphere at most .. A thumbs up to that 👍
Now let me come to the pros -
1. Definitely the atmosphere .. Its superb 
2. Loads of free space & privacy 
3. Cost effective 
4. The view of entire elgin area ..
Cons :-
1. Food quality , was not that delicious, one can  feel the lack of perfection in it .
2. Staff assistance was poor .. They don't give u as much importance as u demand .
3. Toilet facility .. I must say its not good at all .. Seriously  .. Guys i know its not a part of the review points , but as its so bad , i felt it needs a special clause to mention that . 
Conclusion:-
Actually i wanted to give it a 3.25 all over , but since zomato does not allow such i gave it 3 out of 5 zoma .. 
Thank u guys i hope u will enjoy .. And its a place that u need to check out for ... A perfect place for good time .. Happy foodie

Amazing place near Forum, Elgin road. The ambience and sitting isn't to die for. But the food. I cannot tell you enough about it.
We ordered Rava Dhania dosa (the Dhania dosa is a speciality) and it was good not great, might be because Dhania didn't appeal to my taste. We ordered an Enchilada (they have it spelled wrong - 'Enchilands' in the menu), it was amazing. Had the dish after long and was reminded of the last time I had it. Great taste. We also ordered an American Burger which was okay too.

A great place for college going crowd to hang out. You can also stop here for a quick light on the pocket meal while you are shopping, roaming around near Elgin road.

Its located in Elgin road,few metres from brand factory. Very hard to locate. My Experience wasn't good at all. The elevator wasn't working properly. The ambience is okay. They offer both inside and outside sitting arrangements. Coming to the food, the pizza was really not good. We had mixed pizza and 8 in 1, both were equally bad. The dosa was the only thing that was okay. They really need to work on the quality of food.

Rooftop top view is located on the 6th floor of vaibhav plaza, Lee road close to brand factory. It is famous for its rooftop location which offers a great view of the city.

It was both indoor as well as outdoor seating. I and my friend chose to sit outside and enjoy the rooftop view.

It was around 1:30 in the afternoon and the place was totally empty. It is a pure veg restaurant. The menu had options from south Indian to pizzas and various chillers. Since we were full after lunch, we chose to have dhania dhosa and chocolate ice cream

The dhosa didn't taste as great as expected. It was average. But the chutneys served with it were very tasty.

The ice cream was good both in terms of quality and amount.

Overall the ambience here is perfect for a hangout but the food needs improvement.

The rooftop view sits on top of a fairly conspicuous building and unfairly without even a board or placard downstairs or outside the building to announce itself.
But once you've found it, you could expect a good meal with an even better view off the terrace and into the cityscape. 
I landed up on an evening it was hosting two parties at the same time. Yet I wouldn't complain that it hampered their a-la-carte service. The score already has 1 point for ambience, 1 more perhaps for the food. Though the Indian Food is the only cuisine worth trying there. I tried the dhaniya dosa and butter onion uttapam, both crisp and well flavoured. Their tacos and burger unfortunately missed the mark. 
Furthermore +1 point for the value for money. The sum total we paid for our rather heavy dinner for two was only about 400 rs. 
Lastly though I'd deduct 1/2 a point for their presentation... It was neat and clean but a little more of an effort would be well received. 
I am still in search of the perfect restaurant which would steal that 5th point from me on account of an unforgettable experience. 
The restaurant is highly recommended and deservedly so.
Been there on the 16th of November with Manish Pandey.

If you are searching for restaurant which gives you the terrace view then this place is right for you...

The ambience gives u the nice and comfortable feeling..There is one ac room also but the you"ll likely prefer the terrace one..

Here u can have dosas,coffees,pizzas,sandwiches,cold drinks etc..The price of the foods are reasonable..I've orderd "Dhaniya Dosa" which was just ok

Come and have a nice hangout with your friends,family and loved ones.. This place is surely a must hangout place if you are bore of visiting same type of ac rooms restaurant..

The view is no doubt the only highlight about the whole place. And if you are lucky enough that the weather of Kolkata blesses you with some cool breeze then this place is your ideal place to hangout. Coming right to the food, the babycorn capsicum pizza that we ordered was really tasty but the cheese pizza wasn't as good as we expected it to be. And the Enchiladas were a total disappointment. :/Alot of changes can be made.

A decent place to eat at or more specifically hang out with friends. Its a total vegetarian joint. So a fair warning to the meat lovers. They provide a wide selection of dosas. The ones with cheese are simply yummy. We had cheese onion dosa and it was superb. The pav bhaji is tastes good too. The main attraction is the attached roof top sitting. To enjoy that area make sure you go during the evening or the wintertimes. This place does deserve a visit. The coffee is overpriced though. The quantity is not adequate for that price.

Location : 

Its in Lee Road above Vaibhav Market near HHI hotel. It's on the terrace of the building on 6th Floor. You have to get down on 5th floor and have to use stairs to reach on top. Parking is not an issue over there. You can park on the entire road. 

Ambience : 

The place is divided into two sections. One is open and another is covered AC. If the climate is good open space is better to sit then the covered one. Especially in winters you will like sitting outside. Interiors are most ordinary, since ages it's like this nothing much change. Cleanliness is not very much up to the mark but it's ok. 

Food : 

Their are not much varieties but you will get South Indian, pizza, sandwiches, and few items more. 

South Indian is famous out there. Especially Dhania Dosa. It's really good. Onion Uttapam is also nice. Just try out. Pizza is good. Chowmein I didn't liked it. Cola float was same as other places. 

Overall food is ok and you can try out going there. 


Service : 

Service was average or infact poor I must say and waiters are not trained very much. If you want any refill you have to tell them twice or thrice. Less man power. During rush times cleanliness is an issue. Tables and chairs are not properly wiped. 

Price : 

Price is average, not very high. It's affordable for most. 

Overall I enjoy having food there. Have been there many times and can go again. 

Two things I would like to tell the management to change. First one is good speakers and second is good smiling trained waiters.

This place is worth a visit only and only because of its location. I was not aware of this place until a friend pointed it out. As the name suggests its a rooftop restaurant and offers a really pleasing ambiance especially on a rainswept evening.
The sodas and desserts are all fine. But the sandwiches and pizzas are well pretty average to say the least. This place is strictly vegetarian but its paneer quality is not upto the mark. Speaks volumes. Doesnt it?
I have heard they make decent dosas, but havent got around to try them yet. Service is prompt and courteous and the prices reasonable.
A perfect place to see the sun going down on the city this monsoon over a glass of fresh lime soda. Cheers!

this place can test your navigation skills a little bit. ;) .
As the name suggests, rooftop aka top view is located on the roof of the vaibhav plaza, on the Lee road. you have to take the elevator to the 5th floor and then take the stairs to this one of a kind restaurant. The ambiance is not so luxurious, it is simple yet comfortable. who cares about the in-house ambiance when you have a Birdseye view of the lovely surrounding. the sunset from here looks beautiful. but the music here spoils the party,
i sincerely believe that they should play somethings soft rather than vulgar numbers like 'jumme ki raat'...
i went there twice, on both occasions the service were prompt and courteous.
coming on to the food..
i like the coffee here, not to sweet, exactly how i want it., cheese grilled sandwich or the normal veg sandwich is also pretty good. they have pizzas too,but never tried those, they also look pretty yummy ;) they serve only veg. ,prices are moderate here.
they also have an in-house sitting area, but i would rather recommend you to sit in the open, providing its not too hot outside. ;)
they have a different section on the other half of the roof where they also host private parties, but that doesn't hamper the proceedings of the restaurant.
its the prefect place to have a romantic date without burning holes in your pocket. ;)

I gave them an extra star just for their setting. I mean its the only roof-top eatery in Kolkata that I have been to. The setting is just super. 

Have been coming here since my school days and still do regularly. This is the perfect place to visit if you are in the mood for a light evening snack. They have a lot of options in their menu and most of them are pretty good. I have tried their Veggie Burgers and Mixed Pizza. The latter was especially scrumptious. However, I mainly visit them for their dosas, which are too good. My personal favourite is the Dhania dosa and the Mexican dosa. They are crisp with a lot of stuffing inside. I have tried dosas in various eateries across Kolkata, but Roof-To has beaten them all. 

Very good service, soothing setting and palatable snacks makes this a must-visit place for me every two months. I just never get bored of them.

Visited for lunch. The view from the rooftop is pretty good and a meal over here in the evening would have been really nice. But since it was a monsoon afternoon, the area was not operational. Had to sit inside which is nothing but a small hall with no décor... looked more like a canteen. However, the best part is the food. Though purely vegetarian, it has good variety in the menu, especially the South Indian spread. Had ordered for a "Two Flavoured Dosa" which I guess was a speciality over here. The masala consisted of two flavours from both end... one was dhania flavoured and the other end was moghlai flavoured. Though the dhania flavoured end tasted much better, the moghlai masala was just okay. However, 1 dosa was enough to make my stomach full. Service was a bit slow. Pricing is okay.

One of my favourite roof-top hangouts in Kolkata..this is located at Elgin Road..more specifically Vaibhavi Mall roof-top restro.. the view from the top is awesome and you can assure yourself to have a nice evening. There are enough options to choose from when it comes to.food n drinks..from.dosas,idlis,pizzas,uttapams to various shakes, coffees and teas.. ideal for couples who want to spend some alone-time with one another, admiring the view and munching on their evening snacks. There is also an air conditioned section, in case you find the open-air section crowded or the weather warm. Its a popular.choice fr throwing birthday parties too.. More often than not a party can be seen under way at some section of the terrace. Must-visit if you are in that area in the evening time.

This is a great place for both couples n friends. The rooftop thing is pretty cool but then the Calcutta summers! 
Coming to the food.. We had 
Dhania dosa , which was awesome
Mughlai dosa, awesome according to my friends
A gourmet pizza.. Loved it too.
The coldrinks were totally watery and the rose shake was on the poorer side too. 
Food was Good only.. Service was prompt. 
I'll be visiting this place again n again for the pizza n dhania dosa

If you are a scenery lover this place is best for you. 
Sitting on the top of the building in the middle of the town is best place to have food .
Rooftop is one of the most hyped place in that area.
Talking about the food , this place is famous for dhania dosa which is worth having .
One advice :- don't try tacos . 
Good place for dosa , brownie sizzler was also not upto the mark, on the other hand the staff is not well trained so have patience while you deal with them.
Overall the place is not as good as expected.

I have visited the place with my bestie after showing the place in srijit mukherjee's flim, but i am disappointed. A very average place, very small rooftop joint. Rooftop view is good only. We have ordered tacos and ice cream. Tacos were bad and ice cream was very average, nothing special, their service was not good also.

Overhyped due to its appearance in a few of Srijit Mukherjee movies, the roof top view at Lee road is nothing close to extraordinary. The food is strictly vegetarian (if that is not bad enough), the joint doesn't believe in the concept of cup and saucer,  they provide their coffee (nescafé machine made) in a dirty looking cup making it lie naked on your table. Coming to food, don't order for the cheese grilled sandwich unless you are ready to be surprised with a tomato ketchup sandwich (this place has an abundance of ketchup,  from chilly to tomato to what-not).  The ambiance is not as fancy as the movies potray. The skyline is filled with high rise and all you can gaze at is the interiors of the nearby apartments. The price is very cheap but the food failed to satisfy the foodie in me. Even if you risk going there make sure it's not summer and even if it is, not before sundown. 
P.S. Though it's a open air joint, and smoking is permitted,  smokers are treated as outcasts and are banished to a lonely table at one corner.

This place first of all needs some pest control. The hygiene needs to be highly improved so I would recommend you to sit inside and not in the outside area unless you're a fan of creepy-crawlies nearby.The dosa has got to be the best thing on the menu so I would say that if you really want to go then it'd be wise to try the various dosas and maybe one of the grilled sandwiches.One tip would be to eat only hot items here as it's more germ-free and well,edible.Note:Love both pests and dosas?This is the place for you!

This place has always been my favourite. I have visited this little roof top cafe/restaurant umpteen number of times since my childhood. And, I never miss a chance to take out some time to come here whenever I'm in the area.

The best part is, even my mother used to come here during her college days. 

Must have - 
Mughlai Dosa
Any Pizza
Tacos
Cold Coffee

This place was introduced to me by a college friend of mine who was pure vegetarian. Being situated in Elgin road it was very convenient for us to go and hangout there in the evening big post classes. The place has brilliant view and ambience. They served really nice cheese pizza and grilled cheese sandwiches and pav bhaji and cholla bartora and so on. And a lot of noise car refreshing mock tails and coolers. And it is quite pocket friendly too.

Have frequented roof top for 3 years with my pg mates, to gorge on cheese Dhania dose, tomato masala dosa, grilled sandwiches and pizza. 
This place is airy and amazing when the weather is breezy. Lovely place.

Visited this place with my family. Have gone there many times. But recently the quality of the place has been declining. They are serving water in paper glasses and are understaffed. The pizzas are good. You'll like the pizza if you like normal cheese and don't like mozrela cheese. Donot order pav bhaji there you'll be wasting money. I am not sure about the place sometimes its good but today its wasn't.

A difficult to find restaurant, (its near Brand Factory) but once you do, you will really love it. I suggest you come to this place in the evening, after the sun sets down, and your will get a feel that you are on a Roof of a building and looking into the skyline of Kolkata. This really beats anything, compared to other restaurants in town. Unique.

Coming to the food, its pure Veg, but taste is really great. I suggest you try the Mushroom Onion Dhosas and Sandwiches. One thing you will like is the quantity. Quantity and size is more compared to the price; and beats any other similar restaurants.  

Overall 4.5

Okay finding the place was quite troublesome given the fact that nobody had heard of this place and we did not have the address, but im glad I did not give up. Even though im not much of a vegetarian person, it seemed just perfect on a winter night. I loved their simple outdoor arrangement and also the fact that it was not crowded  unlike other restaurants on any December eve. Dosas were crisp and just perfect for me..
Planning to drop by someday soon.

We had 1 onion dosa,1 dhania masala dosa & 1 tomatoe dosa. Each of the item were splendid in taste specially the onion & dhania masala dosa.. The price is just a bargain considering the place & the taste of the food..

A must visit for a south indian delicacy lover :)

I have been here many times and just one thing stands out. The feel. The location and the rooftop cafe. Nothing fancy but there's a feel good factor about it. Many Bengali films are shot here as well. Chotushkone being the lates. So one should understand that it's quite good.

Now. The food. Well. I have ordered Burgers, Pav Bhaji and Soft Drinks always and have liked the quality. The Burgers are big enough and are filled. Pav Bhaji is also quite nice. Bhaji being a tad spicy and they give it hot. Tastes good.

I maynot go here just for the food if asked but as a package, this is a place, I love in Kolkata. One should definitely try it out. Surely. Won't be disappointed. 


For those. Who do not want to be under the broad sky, they have a separate AC room as well. So no worries.

Would been a 3 but for the location and feel. ' 0.5 ' more.

Have been going to this place since i was a child... earlier it was one of the few laces to serve pizza and south indian to keep the whole family happy...the outdoor seating if gone in winters is great fun... the pricess are dirt cheap and the whole place is very good... though dont expect top of the line service but they do provide it in a nice and cool fashion...

coming to thefood i am one who can vouch for the same... the fod no matter what you eat is great to taste... be careful of the mocktails which they serve as they can proove to be a bit dodgy at time... more so the south indian is very good and the pizzas has the "Ghar Ka Pizza" feel to it like fillers or garden cafe or super snack bar...

all in all it is a great place to visit just to relax and while away some time....

This restaurant does not exist! Looked around the area for close to 20 mins and even called the restaurant. Nobody answered the phone.. Asked people and nobody had heard of this... Very disappointed as it had good reviews! Maybe the location given here is wrong... I'm very sure it doesn't exist at the location given here... There is Lee Residency and Brand factory on that road and nothing between the 2 buildings. This restaurant is shown at the place where brand factory stands currently.

At first I had to face difficulties in locating the place as the stuffs were not receiving the ph.. Bt when there is a will there is a way!!! So reached the place finally! A calm n cosy rooftop restaurant which made me pleased.. They also have an a.c. section beside the rooftop cafe! It is a complete veg cafe mainly focusing on south Indian varieties.. We ordered for butter masala dhosa,mixed uttapam,cheese grilled sandwich.. All were good in taste.. At last we had cold coffee with icecream and badam sarbat..

Considering the location a lot could have been done and the owners might have made some big bucks in the process. The place has potential with a little effort it could easily become one of the most sought after romantic restaurant in town.

I 1st came to know of this place from a friend who had been searching for the roof top cafè shown in the bengali feature film "Chotushkone". I myself had liked the view while watching the film but didn't know that it was being shot at this place at that time. So it was a nice surprise when my friend told me that the place featured in the film was very near to my college (IPGME&R) and so I decided to visit this place sometime soon. That "sometime soon" I managed yesterday, that is, on the 9th of Jan. However, one thing worth mentioning here is that neither the location given in the zomato map nor the one in google map are correct, although the zomato one is much closer to home. So I had to ask around a bit on Lee road before successfully locating this place. I was pretty excited about visiting this place and once I reached the roof, the view didn't disappoint me! :) The view is quite great with a portion of the AJC Bose flyover visible on one side and an extended view of bhawanipore area on the other. The view might not be overwhelming but its kinda pleasing in a simplistic sort of way. On the way in I noticed that there are 2 portions of the roof with the air conditioned sitting area in between them. On the left side portion I noticed there was a birthday party in full swing from which I gathered that it must be the portion they have for hire for banquets and parties. The other portion is where the open air sitting area is and that is reached by traversing by the AC area. They have potted plants along the periphery of the roof with a slightly raised seating area in the centre. Me and my friend chose the raised area to sit for the better view but if you are looking for something a bit more cozy,then the corner should be your choice. We sat for a while and enjoyed the open air ambience before actually ordering. We ordered a babycorn capsicum pizza, a paneer garlic pizza and a veg grilled sandwich. The food came quick enough given that pizzas take time to be prepared. First came the 2 pizzas and then a little while later came the sandwich. The pizzas are not to be reckoned with places like dominoes or pizza hut but they had a kind of home made feel to it which actually appealed to me quite a bit. Both the pizzas were quite good but I liked the paneer garlic one better. The sandwich tasted well enough and it had potato chips served with it which complemented it quite nicely. We sat around chatting for a while after finishing the food before asking for the bill cause we felt that we just couldn't get enough of the ambience! :) The staff are well behaved, I'll give them that but the waiter attending to our table didn't leave the side of the table till he had ensured that we were leaving him a tip, which I found a bit irksome. We visited the place around pre-dusk and so we got a view in the daylight, saw the sun set gradually on the horizon and witnessed the evening slowly setting in when the stringed lights and the lamps came on providing a nice charm of its own to this place. The light breeze of the soft winter evening was such a treat! I feel this is the ideal time to visit this place if the true charm of this place is to be experienced! :) The menu is a bit of a mix with regard to pricing cause I felt some of the items on the menu were a little overpriced while some others were just about right and also when I asked about the availability of the baskin robins ice cream which is mentioned in the menu, the waiter informed me that they served amul ice cream instead which gave me a feeling that if it was amul then the pricing is not really fair. So all in all am giving this place a 3.5/5 and yes I would return to this place and I would also suggest this place for a casual date if progressing things is on your mind! ;)

We visited the place around pre-dusk and so we got a view in the daylight, saw the sun set gradually on the horizon and witnessed the evening slowly setting in when the stringed lights and the lamps came on providing a nice charm of its own to this place. The light breeze of the soft winter evening was such a treat! I feel this is the ideal time to visit this place if the true charm of this place is to be experienced! :) The menu is a bit of a mix with regard to pricing cause I felt some of the items on the menu were a little overpriced while some others were just about right and also when I asked about the availability of the baskin robins ice cream which is mentioned in the menu, the waiter informed me that they served amul ice cream instead which gave me a feeling that if it was amul then the pricing is not really fair. So all in all am giving this place a 3.5/5 and yes I would return to this place and I would also suggest this place for a casual date if progressing things is on your mind! ;)

Yes you are right! This indeed is the restaurant featured in the popular bengali movie "Chotushkone".

Ambience: It's a very spacious open air roof top cafe. It does have an A/C section as well. There are potted plants along the perimeter of the roof and simple chairs and tables for seating. I went there in the evening and they had the place decorated with strings of lights. It looked really beautiful. The view from the roof is good but not great. However, the simplicity of the place makes it attractive. You can go there for a hangout with friends or maybe a casual date. I rate it 4/5.

Food: It isn't a restaurant, it's a cafe. You will get snacks and fast food items here. I have only tried the dessert section and it was fairly good. Although, quantity was a bit less I feel. I rate it 3.5/5.

Service: The staff is well-behaved, attentive and helpful. Speed is good. I rate it 3.5/5.

Price: Certain items seem slightly overpriced keeping in mind the less quantity while some are just fine.

Overall, I give it 3.5/5.

It is not a restaurant it is fast food centre at the top of a building. Don't expect any breath taking view. Quality of food is below par. Decor is also poor. It's kind of family place with birthday parties happening. So not a place to come for date. I am saying that because restaurants which are rooftop or close to water body often are favourite place for romantic dates. I never visited this place after my first visit nor do I ever again intend to.
P.S: I visited this place a year back.

The food is of average quality. But the place is not at all cheap. However, it is not overpriced either. But full marks should go the ambience and the decoration. The place is really beautiful. Especially it looks very pretty in the evening with the lights on. It is a good place indeed to hang out with friends or to go on a romantic date :)

This is one old place, my dad used to visit this place in his college days! The taste has been consistent all these years he says. I wouldn't know, but the taste is good nevertheless! One must try their dhania dosa and pizzas.

A nice veg outlet. I like its view from top. You can enjoy your food together with a very nice view. They don't have too much of choices to offer you. I like their mixed pizza, cheese dhosa and shakes. The price though is a bit high compared to the offering they make. You have the choice to make yourself comfortable in the AC cabin or you can better relax under the sky. I love the pizza, they r crisp, tasty and much better in taste than any major Pizza specialty outlets in Kolkata. 
The service is very good. They are prompt. Also they are courteous. The place is clean and coupled with an arrangement to host birthday parties. Though I don't get to visit the outlet too often, these days, but would surely drop in sometime soon :-)

One of my favourite places that serves pure vegetarian food..ambience is good..one can opt for the ac room or the roof top open air space..as it was hot we opted for the ac room..the place is not very crowded..service is good and the food is fresh and nice..

We ordered dhania dosa which was too good..no other place can serve such a tasty dhania dosa..the mixed Uttapum was good too..pizza is just like a home made pizza..chowmein and baby corn were good..lastly the cold coffee with ice cream was the icing on the cake..

Love this place..have forgotten the count of the times I have been to this place..

This place serves pretty good vegetarian food. You'll get variety of dosas. Cheese onion dosa, cheese capsicum dosa, rava masala dosa are my favourites. The size is quite enough for a single person. They serve grilled sandwiches accompanied with chips. If you go for lunch I suggest the indoor seating should be availed. But during the evening it's best to sit outside. The view is really great.

Location: Lee Road; A stone's throw from Corner Cafe (at the dogleg of AJC and Lee road). 

This place was introduced to me by my brother when I was small, used to come here to eat dosas. 
Visited this place a few days back along with friends, and as usual ordered dosa, but, this time along with a few more dishes. 

Talking about the food, 

- Dhaniya Dosa: Tasted Great! Coriander paste mixed along with the rice and made to a batter, and made into lovely crispy dosas. 
Recommended. 

- Mexican Dosa: Had a spicy mix of garlic paste, red chilli podwer, coconut chutney spread inside the dosa. Tasted good.

- Mysore Dosa: Tastes good, for me it got overshadowed by the other two dosas, but, yes you would love it as a stand alone.
-  Sambhar tasted average but, the coconut chutney was nicely prepared.

- Vegetable cheese burger: Decent taste, nothing great as such. 

- Chola Bhatura: Was good to taste. Nothing so great about it. 

- Cold coffee with ice cream: Tasted decent with the almost right proportion of milk to coffee and a scoop of icecream on top. Perfection required. 

- Chocolate Shake: Was average overall. Scope of improvement available. 

- Onion Capsicum Pizza: Generous toppings and nicely baked. Tasted good.

The service is quick, the staff is well-informed and courteous. 
The pricing out here is quite pocket friendly.  

Overall an above average experience. 
- Wish the improvements are initiated soon.

I am probably one of the many for who Top view or fondly called rooftop , one of the first open air cafe in kolkata, has a special and fond memory association. Being a popular birthday celebration venue, I had my first celebrated party there , over two decades back. Keeping abreast with modern times, the place has seen many revamps  like introduction of a ac dine in enclosure and banquets ; but the spirit remains the same. 

It still maintains the status quo of being a haven for young lovers coo-chi-cooing over a shake or young school with friends or a group of youngsters enjoying a quick bite. 

Another thing consistent is the food- love the dosas especially the dhania dosa, the burgers, chowmien, the Indian style pizza and shakes. The air-conditioned banquet is a rather comfortable venue for kiddie birthday parties. A visit always takes me down memory lane.

Rooftop was the first open roof restaurant in kolkata. 
It's a pure vegetarian place and I've been here a couple of times with my friends. 
We usually ordered here pizza, tacos, shakes and the ever famous dhaniya dosa. 
The food here tastes good enough - specially the dhaniya dosa. I remember as a child coming here just for their dhaniya dosa with my mom. 
The prices are sort of steep going by the quality of the food..& honestly the ambiance isn't the same anymore either. So there goes a 3.5 from me!

This place what you call ‘perfecto’ for romanticism. Roof Top offers you a lovely top view of the city. When you climbed up the sixth floor you will yourself in an open space under the starry sky. But this place also has air conditioned place where can cool off. 
But every time I visited the place I prefer myself in the lap of nature. This place is very much talked about among the vegans friends. Vegan places are very limited in terms of reasonable price and comfortableness in the city. On that note this place offers a vast range of vegan food. More than 30 varieties they have only in dosa. I have not tried all of them though. But dhania and cheese mushroom dosa are top on my list. On their menu they have a small variety of Uttampam, I have tasted them once. I find very flavorful. They also have a fast food section where you can find pizza burger and sandwich and many more. If you are fan of pizza hut or Dominos this is not cup of your tea. They offer you Indian style pizza, rather than an authentic one. But this also leave you effect on your taste buds. But every time I visited this place I have tried another flavor in dosa which I have not earlier. 
Service is not that appreciable which it should be. They are slow to take orders and serve too. Over all a good place to hang out with your friends or loved ones.

A suitable place for hanging out in the open with some Tasty food. The Paneer Garlic Pizza and the Dhania Dosa are a must try. I just adore the Paneer Garlic Pizza, it is one of a kind.

The other dishes taste fairly well. The outdoor seating gives a beautiful view of the city, provided the weather is nice.

The seating is not very comfortable though. The chairs are metallic and quite hard. One thing you would not enjoy much.

Overall, the restaurant is a pocket friendly place for people looking for a decent meal but ready to compromise on the comfort.

For me, a visit to rooftop restaurant could be justified on just 3 grounds dhania dosas, old school fat indian burger and open air seating with a nice view and if one tries to expect much out of other things/ aspects, would be disappointed !!!

Located on lee road on the rooftop of vaivhav market, i dont know about its inception but have been seeing it for a decade. They have 3 portions, one being open air restauarnt, second being an air conditioned one and third is a segment to hold small gatherings where i have attended quite a few birthday parties for kids.The open air seating area is the biggest plus alongwith a nice view though the seating arrangement and quality of chairs needs improvement. The staff service is very average and service time is fast enough.

The food menu is pretty long but only items worth trying in my opinion are the dhania dosa, cheese burger and few shakes which are decent. In short if you stick to these limited items, the experience is good enough and experimenting doesn't help here.

I prefer this place only for its open air seating during to enjoy some nice n good weather otherwise its  skip for me !!!

What a lovely place. Never knew about this place before. I was initially persuaded to go with my friend. Now I have become a very regular customer. 

Coming to the location first. Its a restaurant located on the roof of a small multi-storied shopping mall, in the posh Elgin road. Its just a couple of minutes walk from Forum. You have an option to either sit inside or outside in the open roof where the amazing view can be enjoyed. Its just as big as a cafe and is the best place I would say to bring your beloved for a cup of coffee. The view, soft music, and surroundings were an added delight. 

Now comes the best part. The price! Its probably the best priced cafe in town I have come across. A club sandwich was only for 45 rupees. It was amazingly prepared. The service was also good. The ambiance was a little average, Though I  didn't expect any better. 

Apart from this food was quite good. Well, I would say its more than worth the price. I am yet to try the dosas, that's their speciality. Otherwise based on whatever I had, it was excellent. 

Overall absolutely satisfied especially when taking the price into consideration. Like I said I come here very often, its an ideal place to hang out. Must try! Its totally worth.

I had heard about this rooftop veg restaurant from my friends some 8-9 years back but never got the chance to try it as it is not visible from the main road. 
Situated on the top floor of an old shopping complex (Vaibhav Plaza) on Lee Road, you need to enter the mall take the lift on the right side and go to the top floor. The entrance is a bit shabby but it leads to a nice open air hang out place with a spectacular view! 
I visited on a monday late evening after office and it was almost empty! There are two sections. One section is usually let out for Birthday parties and the other section consists of the restaurant. There is also a covered Air conditioned area. I preferred to be seated outside for the open roof top experience :) 
Since it is a pure veg restaurant, I played safe with Cheese sandwich, a plain dosa and a fresh lime soda. 
The fresh lime soda was very basic, not impressive at all. It lacked the zing ! The dosa was average. I kind of like the sandwich. It had a made at home feeling but the quality of cheese was good and I would like to try that again.

The service was okay. It took 15 minutes to serve everything. 
Final Verdict: Well, if you are around elgin road and looking for a quick and affordable snack which is easy on the pocket then you may try it. I have an affinity for rooftop restaurants/cafes so I might be back. So rating it 3, please do not go with high expectations !

Serves yummylicious Dhaniya dosas...Pizzass as u have never had before..tacos..sandwiches it all tastes so yummy and especially when u r sitting on a roof top with a view of the city it all tastes much better I guess !  A very casual hangout place to be wid friends.. family or even alone ! Being at the heart of the city its more easily accessible !Love the place Love the Food ! Thumbs Up !

Well I first started going to this place during my college days. My college was located nearby and was the place to go to when we wanted to bunk classes. Sitting in the open-air is a delight though during the summer you would want to sit in the other covered and air-conditioned part of the restaurant. 
The restaurant is located on the roof of Vaibhav building and might be hard to locate for first timers. The open-air portion as well as the closed air-conditioned portion, both are are minimally decorated, but are simple and clean.
Coming to the food, it is awesome. Period. Must tries are dhania dosa, vegetable cheese pizza, and vegetable grilled sandwich.  
 The prices though not exactly cheap are within the budget of college going students. The service is also pretty good and efficient.
Great place to go to with a bunch of friends and just fool around and enjoy.

An old haunt where I have also attended lots of birthday parties and had a lovely time with friends. A place one should visit in the cooler months for sure just to enjoy the ambience. Foodwise its nice .... what they serve is basic and tasty but not superb ... I think most people come here for the "rooftop" experience. The cheese mushroom garlic dosa and the grilled cheese sandwiches are good. Amongst the pizzas try the Baked Beans pizza or the Chinese pizza. Shakes are decent but not great.

This place is a rich kids playground. The address, the building in which it is located, the setting of the restaurant; all simply ooze poshness. However the food it presents doesn't do much to be able to uphold that glam quotient. The ordinary if not bad taste of most of the items on the menu coupled with the absurd prices ( high even after considering the elite locality ) makes this place memorable but mostly for the wrong reasons. Its extremely difficult to reach the place if you don't know the exact location; its on the terrace of Vaibhav Plaza, a small shopping complex which is the second building on Lee Road if you enter from the AJC Bose Road side. The restaurant floor has a very nice setting, located as it is on the 5th floor open air terrace. The neighborhood and a quite a few important buildings are visible from here. The ambience is ordinary.There's also an indoor section. The good things end there. The menu is a medley of various cuisines both Indian and foreign. South Indian dishes, though pricey should be your first choice. The Dosas are large and tasty. The North Indian snacks, various types of pizzas and other dishes are just too costly, too weirdly named or too dull to eat. DO NOT try the Mexican dishes over there as it is an insult to Mexican food. Apparently Veg cant be steamrolled over every food. I also really don't appreciate the fact that they've tried to experiment with all kinds of food to some pretty disastrous results.

Chakraborty Tip : Don't bother heading over if the sky's cloudy. If your chances of enjoying the open terrace is gone, you wont like the indoor section.
This particular place got featured in a newspaper recently touted as the regular haunt of a few celebrities. Hope you get to meet them.

Rooftop or Top View, located at Lee Road, is a marvel for vegetarians and those looking for an open air joint within a reasonable budget. The ambiance is just wow. There is a soothing breeze flowing in the evenings and its the perfect setting to enjoy evenings with friends. The food is equally good.
The best thing about this place is the Mexican Pizza. Its heavenly. Its a must on every visit. The Dhania Dosa is another speciality of this place. The tacos is also good. The Cold Coffee with Ice Cream is really tasty. The biggest USP is that the pricing is surprisingly very reasonably low. It attracts a good crowd including families. Its got a closed section on the roof as well. There are birthday parties always happening here. Overall a really preferred place to go and enjoy your food and time. 4.5 stars for Top View.

Well, it is a pure vegetarian restaurant.
I am not at all a pure vegetarian food lover but i liked this one.
The Dhosas were well done..The plain butter dhosa was very nice
Then for pizzas, the chinese pizza was yum.
American Club Sandwich was okay..
then the chocolate desire was the best...
Prices are reasonable and  ambience is very ordinary, nothing special.
3.5 from me.

This one is 100% vegetarian and me being a hard core non-vegetarian still am compelled to rate it so high. The food is nicely prepared and the best thing is they don't take much time to serve your food. the service is quite fast which is a big asset. We ordered a mixed pizza and a vegetable grilled sandwich and within 3 minutes we got what we wanted wow. The quantity was good and so was its taste. The ambience is very simple and I feel the only drawback which needs to improve. But still I had a very pleasant experience which will take me back to this place very soon. 
I have heard from some close sources that even their South-Indian section is very good in fact better than the other cuisines. So I would rate it 4 and would suggest all of you especially if you are a vegetarian to visit this place without fail.

One of the best place for hangout with friends. Only drawback is this place is purely veg so for non-veg lovers this place is little dissapointing.Ambience is superb.
