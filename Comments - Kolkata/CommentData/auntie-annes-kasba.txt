I was disappointed. I love pretzels and was so excited to know that Kolkata has a Auntie Annie outlet but what I had can hardly be called a pretzel. The texture was wrong- too soft, almost like bun. The salt content was less. The color was wrong, almost like the traditional soda bath was skipped... in short, it was just disappointing. I'm sure auntie Annie herself wouldn't call those 'pretzels'

Earlier whenever i have been to Acropolis Mall i have wondered what this place contains because its always quite lonely. Once i had the chance to dine in here.  Cinnabon is still quite a UNPOPULAR food in the city may be otherwise there can be no chance of the place being vacant.  It should flood with people.  Tried there Cinnabon, Chocobon and PECANBON.  Since then Pecanbon has become the best treat for my sweet tooth urges. Simply love it.  Please try.

The pepperoni pretzels are to die for!!  Amazing. Even the cinnamon twigs and nuggets! Delicious. This is our favorite chilling spot. Wish you had more outlets. The cold coffee though has degraded a bit. :( 
There were times when we travelled from far just for that coffee but now it's too less for the price and not that yummy anymore! 

Hope it gets better. 
Cheers! :)

Who doesn't love pretzels. And this place, they are absolutely nailing it. With a choice of classic, sesame garlic onion and almond cinnamon sugar they do provide a desirable experience to your palate. Located on the food court of Acropolis Mall, this pace definitely deserves a visit next time you are around. They also have pepperoni pretzels and a pizza option too. Haven't tried that yet but surely looking forward to it.

Pretzels!! Finally found a place where I could try it. I was always eager to know how they tasted. I was in a mood to try something new so I traveled all the way from my college to Acropolis just to try it. Instead of the normal pretzels we thought of having the pretzel dog. It is a piece of chicken sausage with pretzel wrapped around it. And my oh my did it taste good. The sausage was so tender that it melted in my mouth. The pretzel along with it went pretty well. The pricing was average and people should definitely give it a try.

Had no idea about Pretzels and this place has been an eye opener for me. I just got floored with their pretzel. Sad we could not taste the best pepperoni pretzel, but the seasame and oion garlic was enough to yank for more. That classic cinnamon sugar on the top of the second pretzel was everything u need on a plate. Dying for a re visit again

These pretzels were pretty new to me and I believe that they are a new concept to most of Kolkata. Somehow, they reminded me of the cream rolls that we used to have in our childhood days. We tried the cheese pretzel dog, a healthy piece of meat (hot dog) with an outer thick coat of cheese packed into a tubular piece of bread. The pretzel was served fresh and the aroma was awesome. New concept...great concept...and we surely will be back for more.

It is located in the food court. It offers a limited variety of pretzels, not many to my liking. Also the look is rather rickety and it failed to appeal to me. What is more, the taste is not satisfactory either.
   I begin to doubt if this is the same international chain of Auntie Anne's . I haven't been to one anywhere abroad, but i dont think pretzels of this standard can gain such fame worldwide.

Auntie Anne's can be found in the food court of Acropolis mall baking fresh pretzels. Pretzels are of course a relatively new concept here in Kolkata, but I have heard friends who have tasted the same in New York say these are quite good. High praise indeed! 
We tried the ginger pretzel and the sesame pretzel. Both were very nice- crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. I liked the ginger pretzel more- slightly salty with a hint of ginger, and great with a hot cuppa. The sesame pretzel was good too, particularly if you are fond of sesame seeds- it brought a slight sweetness to the otherwise salty pretzel. It's a good eatery to spend some time over coffee and adda.

Pretzels are a fresh and new concept in Kolkata and the city is quickly warming up to it. I have had the cinnamon sugar pretzel and pretzel nuggets. They are very sweet and sugary. Not a good option if you don't like having too much of sweet stuff. The sour cream pretzel is a little bland in taste. I would like to taste the pepperoni pretzel in future.

The original pretzel is a very sad thing and one which you should avoid. But then, I read about the hot dog pretzel being nice , so ordered a hot dog combo that came with a lemonade.

The lemonade was 1/5th lemonade and 4/5 th ice cubes. The chicken hot dog pretzel turned out to be the original one, that was just a hot dog inside a sweetish bread that didn't tast good. That's it - no mustard, no sauce, no nothing. Just a hot dog wrapped inside a bread roll for 150 bucks.

Now, don't ask me to go back and try the cheese hot dog pretzel, because I am pretty much done with the place.

The way, the "city of joy" is accepting the concept of global cuisine, is not only a good news for the food aficionados out there, but also a constructive step towards providing a new dimension to the gastronomic calisthenics of Kolkata. And one such evidence happens to be the flagship outlet of the famous American,  Pretzel based bakery named "Auntie Annes", located at the food court of ACROPOLIS MALL, right beside Cinepolis.
Honestly, the offerings are really tasty and served freshly baked, right in front of you. 
Service too is prompt and courteous.

My first pretzel experience starts with Auntie Annie's pretzels. I ordered Salted pretzel nuggets and Pretzel dog with cheese.
The nuggets were freshly made and roasted with butter and salt grains. The taste was very good. 
The pretzel dog had mozzarella cheese within and a chicken hot dog. It was too freshly made and baked. The taste was awesome.
Looking forward to come here again and again to try out all others stuffs here.

Auntie Anne's is a global chain selling pretzels with various dips from countertops. This prestigious chain entered Kolkata recently with a kisok at the Acropolis mall,kasba. The renditions of pretzels that they bring to city are enticing. With a wide variation of dips and toppings they are all set to be the pioneer pretzel makers in the city.
I greatly recommend
#cream and onion pretzel: an absolute favorite. The pretzels are made to perfection.
#pretzel dogs : preztels moulded into hotdogs. Quite fulfilling and a cheesy mouthful.
#pretzel pizzas
#pretzel nuggets.
They also offer various refreshing coolers to go with the pretzels.

Finally got around to try out this place and went for the pretzel dog with cheese. It was good but maybe a little undercooked. Also the cheese was a little odd. What surprisingly impressed me was the banoffee coffee drunk which was super flavorful. But I think the items are a bit overpriced perhaps, and I'm not a fan of mall food court "ambience".

Tried out Auntie Anne's Cinnabon #Kolkata located at Acropolis Mall food court recently. Finally found a place in Kolkata that serves amazing Pretzels.
Started with two soothing drinks- Strawberry Lemonade and Blueberry Crumble.
We had the Classic Cheese Pretzel Dog which was absolutely yum followed by the Sesame Garlic Sour Cream Pretzel, which was complemented perfectly by the Cheddar Cheese and Salsa dips.
Then we had a taste of the world famous Classic Cinnabon. I believe Kolkatans will love it a lot, it has similar taste to Kheerkodom. Other items I'd recommend- Chocobon, Caramel Peacanbon and Blueberry Cinnabon.

Auntie Annes a world famous brand has came up with their first step at Kolkata very recently. 

A kiosk located at the food court of Acropolis Mall is what they cater their products to the food lovers of Kolkata.

Pretzels is their key product which is still to get familiar with the city people as this one is a whole new thing for the foodies out here. I tried their classic pretzel which was quite impressive in taste and cold coffee with Ice cream was delightful. I quite liked this outlet waiting for trying some more products.

First visit to Acropolis Mall. Thought of trying something unconventional. Hence visited this counter. I tried out something which was not on the menu list. Do not remember the name. It was kind of chicken patty we have here but more crispy and bigger. One piece cost me Rs. 195!! The size was quite appealing but it was really very disappointing. I almost had to struggle to find out the tiny-winy bits of chicken inside this huge thing. It was almost hollow inside with a layer of cheese only. 

I would anytime prefer our local bakery shops in Kolkata to this one.

The international chain had put up a kiosk in acropolis :) they remain crowded as the billing for cinnamon and auntie Anne's is the same. I took their chicken hotdogs pretzel and lemonade... Song with a cinnamon sugar pretzel. The chicken pretzel was made and baked tight infront of me, a little undercooked I felt it was on eating. The lemonade is a perfect thirst quencher. My cinnamon sugar pretzel was decent :) would not mind trying it out once in a while.

I have always liked Pretzels and I was so glad to see them at Acropolis Mall. Personally I prefer the original Classic pretzel with sugar frosting with a coffee to go with, but on my last visit i foolishly ordered a Cream Cheese Dip. After having my first bite of dipped Pretzel, I realised that they messed up and gave me a caramel dip. They changed it and gave me a standard Cream Cheese dip, which was a Cheddar dip but not cream cheese. If they decide to fix their minor but frequent dip mix ups, Aunt Annes is not really a bad place :)

Not a fan of auntie anne's. I've had the normal pretzels and also the pretzel pizza and wasn't impressed. Too hyped in my opinion. Pretzel pizza was just cheesy and tasted like a normal dominos pizza while the pretzel was hard and seemed stale. I was really disappointed by this, as I was looking forward to it. I'll probably go once to try the cinnabons and see if it's good and then just give up on them.

A pretty decent place to try out bakery and confectionary stuffs like cinnamon rolls, pretzels etc. The shop is in the food court area of the acropolis mall....so pretty much a nice ambience! The cinnamon rolls is very good, tastes heaven when it's warm and the gooey chocolate sauce they pour over it makes its all the more yummy.

Possibly the only place with pretzels. We had the sour cream and onion pretzel and it was good. The bread was soft inside and crunchy outside. We even had a hot dog and it was okay. The strawberry lemonade is good here.

Have taken parcel of pretzel hot dog and discovered the bread was very hard to chew as it was not baked . Auntys Anne should double check on their dough before baking. It was very disappointing.Vanilla cake was not moist

Ate here twice in the past week! The yummy sour cream and onion pretzel, fresh and warm from the over dipped in butter is just amazing. And awesomely enough, the pretzel is pretty filling. Will return for sure!

Food was good. Ordered Jalapeño pretzel and cinnamon sugar pretzel. But loved Jalapeño more. It was awesome. Cinnamon sugar was lil more sweet than expected.

The chocolate cinnabon was simply sumptuous. Pretzel chicken combo with that was equally delicious. A great place to go with your loved ones. And a very pocket friendly place to be noted.

I am so happy. I had pretzels after ages in Kolkata. Amazing place. I really liked the lemonade and cinnamon roles. The dip we ordered was sugary so we din't like it much. Prices are high but quality is good. They should add more options to pretzels.

I visited this place twice as of late and needless to say it is not as good as flurys or any other famous bakery joint but it's combo of hot dogs and lemonades are surprisingly cool..but the minibons which were available from cinabons..were not so cool..prices are ok..and affordable..so for hangouts it's not a bad place to visit.

Hi foodies!

So this is the second American fast food store that had made it's way to Kolkata (after Delhi) along with Cinnabon. Located at the 3rd floor of Acropolis Mall, this is apparently running a joint venture with Cinnabon. They share their counter and mini  kitchen. They are world famous for their pretzels and the best thing is they make it right in front of you (if you choose so). You could also have the ones that are already made but they taste best when they are oven-fresh!

=Food=
So here's a tip. If you're hesitant to try their original pretzel, do try their PRETZEL DOG. Also, try the cheese version. It's only 10 bucks more than the non-cheese and tastes way better! We had it oven-fresh and the aroma of the sausage wrapped inside the soft pretzel was absolutely drool-worthy. #mustTry.
You can also try this with their assorted dips.

-Bon Appétit. :)

So finally another American chain is in town, of course a different genre of food is uo for grabs this time but worth grabbing nonetheless. 
Not too sure whether it'll succeed in town or not, but i definitely enjoyed my dig– garlic pretzels and their signature lemonade. 

The good thing is, that, our city of joy will know what a pretzel is(officially), though there are, of course, multivariate versions of this all american street snack. 

Try this place if you're up for something new and unconventional to the indian/kolkattan palate – both sweet n spicy(just for the heck of sayin spicy, it really isn't); also to experience a true blue Americana. Cheers!

Finally I had a chance to taste the Pretzels in my own city. This is one of my favourite snack whenever I visit Europe. Aunt Anne's have kept the prices similar to equivalent Euro rates. I need to try out the Cinnabons during a later visit. Looking forward to multiple visits.

So after a really nice movie, the rumble in our tummies drew us towards this particular counter whose spicy-cinnamon smell made our feet walk of their own accord. And what a delight it was!

Freshly made pretzels, baked muffins with delightful frosting, classic bread nuggets and ice cold home lemonade! What more can some one want. Everything we tried was absolutely DELICIOUS!

There are many more items on the menu and according to the management, quite a few more to be added in the future. So far, we have been delighted with the food especially the exquisitely soft and buttery bread nuggets!

Drop by and Bon Apetit, people!

This evening, me and my wife had an awesome time, by having some yummy items from this outlet . Outstanding taste , mesmerizing aroma, I vow to go back to this place again and again . Cinnamon sticks are soft n those melted in mouth , leaving the feel of  cinnamon sugar on the palate. The signature Pretzel was just rightly baked n the taste was sublime. I recommend the sweeter variety of this classic cleric snack. The chicken sausage  hotdog  is notch below than other items. Still I warn that if u once taste  the Pretzel of this outlet, u r in 'danger' of being addicted to it... ha ha ha.
