This being closest to our college is the most visited and hang out place for quite a lot of college students. the ambience is average. The presentation of the food is average.
But the quantity and quality of the food we have had is amazing. One plate of noodles or rice is enough for two people. at least the food I had till date was really good.
All time favourite and our recommendation is definitely smoked chicken and woktos noodles. I have had momos as well which was nice but they don't serve veg momos.
I think they are better as a dine in place than a takeaway . The best is that they have all tax inclusive prices so you don't need to worry about the extra pocket pinch for taxes. Also the food is very reasonable, thus making it a favourite among students.

If you are looking for decent Thai food adda bites is a good place to stop by.
Its not so spacious as compared to others normal ambience nothing special.
The must try dishes are Hong Kong Noodles and Smoked Chicken. These two are the best signature dishes they serve. Really flavourful and little spicy but you'll love it.
The service is okayish.

My sister and I had visited it earlier when it was still a part of Arambagh’s. We had ordered a plate of Chicken 65 and two cold coffees. The coffees were watery, but the chicken 65 was definitely scrummy! During winters, I also saw live grills outside the entrance where tandoori delicacies were prepared. Since then, I heard that there was a change of ownership, and it has now been converted into a Chinese cuisine restaurant.....not sure if the earlier standard is still maintained.  

Update: Curiosity got the better of me, and I checked it out one evening. We decided on Smoked Chicken as starter. Although there was no smoky flavour, it was otherwise palatable. For mains, we ordered Mixed Meinfoon…what came as a great disappointment is the fact that instead of rice noodles, we were served rice vermicelli [take a close look at the attached photo] mixed with veggies and chicken shreds. Do they presume that they can take their customers for a ride??!! The accompanying dish of Hunan chicken was also unappetising, since the gravy was watery…as if prepared using a lot of soya sauce, and the chicken pieces bland.

A small restaurant serving Chinese food. Good for snacks and evening hangouts with friends. A cozy ambience giving it a very homely feel. The seating arrangements are close; otherwise, they are comfortable enough for dining. The quality and quantity of the food are good and so is their service. A must visit place especially for people in and around the locality for reasonable, tasty and satiating food.

The essestials of a good restauraurant are of course the food and rates but also the ambiance and service. Food here is ok and by ok I mean it's better than some but at the cost there are better options. Coming to ambiance you can see the effort that was put into it but somewhere it is lacking something. It's just one of those places where you eat and leave. So taking all the facts into account this place is a definite go to but with conditions apply like are you very hungry and just want some food that is somewhere between just edible and terrific. Me, I have been to this place a few times and will continue to go but not a must go.

This place used to be a lot better earlier. They used to prepare very nice chicken tandoori. But nowadays their quality is pretty poor. Price is comparatively quite high. The other problem is that the seating capacity is very less. I think they should do only take away. But before that, they need to improve quality

Here everything is average. A place with such stability and consistency awes me. Service, food, ambiance, menu choices, worth of price, quantity: everything  just average, and hence the average rating. 
One thing great about it is, it is very easy to spot. Standing right on the side lane of Kasba Main Road while going to Gariahat from Ruby. Good hangout place if you are near by, and up for a lazy visit.

Useless staff. Doesn't accept card payments below a certain amount and doesn't inform the same.

Has a certain air and attitude that he is justified and retorts that I should have enquired that. 

Disgusting behaviour from the staff... he actually said... Thik ache amra korina , apni jaan. Means Yes we do not. If you have problems get out.

I will never ever go here again. Never.

This is a comfortably spaced restaurant located in Kasba, close to Acropolis mall. Food is reasonably priced and sufficient in quantity. Quality is somewhat mediocre. Some of the staff can be quite unprofessional . However, it has a relaxed ambience, and is good for a hangout and lots of "adda", just as the name suggests.

Adda Bites is located opposite to CBDT near Ruby.
It is a small restaurant that's specialises in serving Chinese and Thai food. 

The place looked clean and the servers were courteous. Ambience is good,though nothing flashy as to catch your eye.

We were four in numbers and decided to hop in for a lunch. We took a seat a table of four which looked quite small to me. One has to be careful of not to trip down something on the floor.

Coming to the food we ordered - 
Veg fried rice - Tasted good and served hot.

Veg Hakka noodles - Tasted Ok, a bit on the thick side, served hot though.

Schezwan chicken - Tasted good but was not at all spicy as it should be. A little different form the ones we usually get at other places . #likedit 

Hong Kong Fish - This was the best thing we had. it was spicy and tasted amazing. Made of BASA fish it just melted in. #musttry

Pricing is reasonable as in tandem with the quantity.

Overall a good eating experience.

P.S.- Seating space should be looked upon, customers should not feel conjusted.

Located right opposite to the petrol pump near Ruby hospital,this small cafe or food joint is a nice place for some adda. I used to come here with my friends after tutions during my school days. They had a dish back then called chicken in banana leaves. We used to love that dish and order it almost every time. I liked their noodles too. Pocket pinch is moderate.

This place surely does justice to the name. A little place that barely can house 8-10 people at a time, is actually doing great. We went here with the sole intention of 'adda'. Ordered Lat Me Kai Chicken and Fried momos. These two dishes managed to keep 3 not so hungry tummy happy. They do charge extra taxes, yet quite a reasonable one.

A small place near Ruby hospital area besides Rene, to try out chinese once you get your chinese hunger pangs.. A relatively cafe like environment rather than a restaurant , this is one such calm n quiet place where you can go, munch , and chatter. A perfect place to go for gatherings in which we , bengalees are expert at, adda.. Though situated beside the main road, the hustle bustle of the city is less bothering to the visitors.. Pricing is absolutely cheap and food is of good quality , with respect to the prices. I have tried out mainly soups n noodles here.. Soups are excellent, specially chicken hot n sour soup, chicken sweet corn soup, chicken wanton soup. Noodles , all are good in taste n quantity.. Only thing they need to improve is the amount of sweetness and use of oil , should be controlled for some dishes like crispy chicken chilly honey, and crispy chicken in sweet chilli sauce.. They are more of sweeter dishes rather than the sweet chilli tangy flavours that all chinese lovers love and expect. Ambience is average for the standard they havem maintained , but could be improved as well so that visitors are more comfortable at the small gatherings that they arrange and thus  spent decent amount of time in the restaurant.  Service time should be a bit faster too.

Adda Bites is one of those restaurants that seem to get overlooked often. You could pass this eatery daily on your way to work and never seem to notice it. Despite its anonymity, it is one of the authentic places where you could get sumptuous Chinese cuisine on a relatively medium tier budget. 

The place is located just on the Ruby- Gariahat stretch and finding it is child's play. The eatery itself is a bit small from the inside and the ambience isn't striking either. But what it lacks in aesthetics, it counteracts that in the quality of food.

 I ordered Hong Kong Noodles, Singapore Noodles and Chicken in Black Bean Oyster Sauce. The Singapore noodles were flawless. Very nice texture, uniform taste and nice condiments. Hong Kong noodles were like the classic Hakka noodles, though I must add that they had quite a bit of herb in it which was a refreshing change. The Chicken in Black Bean Sauce was quite funky. It tingled my taste buds very well. 

The quantity here is huge. Hence before ordering, do take note of the level of hunger you have. The pricing is moderate and the staff is good. A takeaway/home delivery is a better bet.

I visited this place once and ordered for home delivery twice and on all the 3 occasions I found the food to be very good. Quantity of every item is enormous, one plate can be shared by 2-3 hungry people easily. I absolutely love their fish items, pan fried chilli fish is a must have item for me here & in all the occasions i ordered this item and other items i tried are mixed fried rice, mixed hakka noodles,bang bang chicken etc and found all of them to be equally good. Price is cheap if compared with quality and quantity and serving time is also fast. To have a great meal here one should avoid ordering exotic items and stick to the common ones then one will not be disappointed.

A small quaint little restaurant serving decent chinese fare. Prawns preparations are not upto the mark. Noodles and rice dishes are fairly good. The fish used is basa and is fresh. The Hong Kong fish is a must try and so is the chilli Babycorn. Amazing stuff.

Small cute decent place with delicious Chinese cuisine. Very few people know about this place because of its remote location near Ruby. I had treated my flatmates on my birthday. We had ordered lime soda, schezwan veg noodles. Schezwan rice and chilly paneer. The price might seem little high but the sufficient quantity is just value for money. The service was a little delayed though.  I look forward to visit this place again .

Good area for adda with 2 or three friends. Ideal adda zone for couples and dishes are fresh and delicious and rate some high but quite well. The place is not ideal for big group hangouts and not for adda for big group.

This feedback is based entirely on the impression created on me by their fish fingers, which my father had brought home this week. The fingers were awesome, full of tasty, tender basa and the coating was quite thin. And unlike those puny, shrivelled fish fingers that we find in some fast food joints, these were pretty hefty. Thumbs up!

I distinctly remember having mocktails during my first year college hangouts. Maybe they have changed the menu. Everything is a bit pricey. We used to come here regularly and my seniors used to swear by it. If u want a heavy lunch try the Subway opposite to this place. This place is exclusively for unadulterated,pure 'Adda' 😊

Been a regular visitor at this place for the last few years. A recent visit revealed that the place has maintained proper service and continues to serve delicious food. My friends and I had ordered crispy chicken in sweet and chilly sauce, chicken Hakka noodles, chicken bang bang and fresh lime. It is a dimly lit restaurant which added to the mood of our adda innings. They served the dishes in ample quantities and we had to pack one for home.

Previously they used to serve italian alongwith some other delicacies ( I remember having baked pasta, chicken in banyan leaf, lasagna). However now a days they serve thai and chinese food only. The food quality is good though not so special. I usually like to have crispy chicken and cold coffee.

A tiny place located conveniently near Arambagh (Ruby Hospital area), Adda Bites is a perfect place for a quick bite - and a bit of adda - with a friend. There are not too many tables, and they are placed rather close to each other, so that more often than not, you end up hearing conversations of the tables around oyu, and they can hear what you're saying too - slightly awkward, if you're looking for privacy.

But the food more than makes up for the lack in ambience. Lots of chicken options (but, naturally) and all of them cooked very well. I have only tried the Chinese starters - Konjee crispy chicken, Chicken Salt and Pepper, American Corn Salt and Pepper, Crispy Chilli baby corn, Chicken spring rolls and Chicken Drumsticks/Lollipops. They were cooked well, and specific requests such as making eggless batter for some of the items, were heeded, and I am much thankful to the staff.

The staff is courteous, helpful and make the experience a wholesome one :)

All in all, strongly recommended :)

[PICTURES OF THE DISHES HAVE BEEN UPLOADED SEPERATELY FOR A BETTER VIEW OF ALL THE DISHES.]
Adda bites, when first opened, used to prepare some really amazing dishes such as spaghetti carbonara, fish and chips, etc..
It's a very small place (read: cramped) with a seating arrangement of 10-12 people. The tables are very small. This place is not suitable for a family dinner.
After the quality of the food of this place deteriorated, I have visited it only once I.e. 1.5 years back to try some snacks, out of which the Crispy chilli babycorn turned out to be amazing whereas Drums of heaven was nothing but chicken pakora and the fresh lime soda tasted as if stale lemons were used in it.

Anyway, it was only on last Friday (23.01.2015) that we got our dinner packed from this place on our Aunt's recommendation.
We entered Adda Bites around 8:55 pm and decided to have the starters there while the main coursewas being packed by them.
Now, coming to the food we ordered -

1) Tom Yum Soup (Chicken) @Rs.110, 1 portion (4/5) : The soup was excellent and was made with thai red curry paste, khaffir lime leaves, lemon grass, chicken stock, chicken bits and mushrooms. The soup was as thin as it was supposed to be and was more of a comfort food. Liked it a lot..

2) Golden fried prawns, 1 plate @Rs.300 (1/5) : The dish looked so yummy that we couldn't wait to dig into it but the excitement shattered into bits and pieces as soon as we took out first bite. I had never tasted such a TASTELESS golden fried prawn. I don't know how thay managed to vanish the smell off the prawns. I was surprised to find no taste at all! However, with a broken heart we finished it off with the sweet chilli sauce, which was by God's grace, delicious! The dish was accompanied by two prawn crackers which were tasteless as well! Higly dissapointed.

Now the rest of the items were packed;

3) Adda bites special noodles, 1 plate @Rs.190 (3.8/5) : The noodles were accompanied by those tastless prawn crackers (again, *sigh*) and a sunny side up egg. The noodles were full of flavours with ample amount of chicken bits, prawns and eggs. Very good. Recommended.

4) Mixed friedrice, 1 plate @Rs.180 (2.6/5) : Though the rice was well cooked with lots of chicken bits, prawns and egg, I found it a bit bland and couldn't find any kind of smokey flavour it it.

5) Schezwan Fish, 1 plate @Rs.200 (4/5) : The fish was most probably basa (of good quality). It was flaky and very soft. The coating on the fish was very thin. Overall, a very good dish. Recommended.

6) Honkong chicken, 1 plate @Rs.160 (4.3/5) : The dish was mildly sweet with a a very comforting taste of star anise. Excellent in terms of flavour and quality! The chicken pieces were well cooked and soft. This dish delivered flavours which any high end restaurant would! Highly recommended!

The quality of all the dishes were maintained well! The quantities were quite good. The food was not very oily and rich, very easy on the stomach.
The bill came upto Rs. 1401 ( inclusive of 14.50% vat, 4.95% service tax, 3 big containers @Rs.7 each and 1 small container @Rs.5)


Note : They take a long time to serve you. We left this place with the food only after 10 pm. 

Not a bad place in terms of food quality and quantity.
Recommended.
Happy eating! :D

Why would you want to go to this place(which is a mixture of a coffee shop and a eating place) when you have the following eateries on the same road?
KFC, Naushijaan, Harveys, Cheeni Kum, Royal Jade, CCD, Cakes, Alibaba, Red Bamboo Shoot, Lazeez etc etc....

This was a really cool place when i was in school(7 years back)....also the above mention restaurants were not there on the same road 7 years back. Right now its just another mediocre place where you would get the standard level expected with Kolkata food. Service is also pretty bad. Quantity is good though.

Went to this place on the very first day of the year and absolutely loved it and I am surely going back as soon as I can.
My sister had gone to this place a few times and she is in love with their fish fingers. The fish they serve in every fish dish beautiful. .yes beautiful , soft and fresh.
The place is small, I don't think it can accommodate even 20 people together but they make up for it in quality and taste.
We had ordered cappuccinos , fish fingers and then chicken hakka noodles and the pan fried fish.I was very much impressed by the last , it wasn't too sweet like many places serve and were still a bit crispy in spite of the sauce. The other items were very good too and everyone MUST try the fish finger.
Now, the amount they serve is a lot and  too much for their prices . There were three of us and by the end of the meal we were so full we had to take a bit of a walk, though we had only ordered one plate of each item. Also they are one of the few places who still serve 8 pieces of fish or chicken in a plate, I think.
The service is quick enough and the food was burning hot when served (impressed!). The place is just opposite to the Ruby hospital , a small walk from Gateway. All in all a must go for everyone.

Adda Bite is not a very popular destination when it comes to dine outs. This is walking distance from Ruby. A small restaurant which may not impress you with its ambience, bit will surely make your eyes roll when you put the food inside ur mouth(well in a good way). The food quality and quantity is pretty good. We ordered Konjee Lamb fry, which was pretty good. We ordered Pan fried noodles, a decent dish which they prepare as good as any other good restaurant. But you wont like it if u r not fond of gravy noodles and vegetables. We ordered a korean rice with Sechwan Fish. I loved it .  The quantity impressed me a lot!
I was short of cash and hence stopped by, knowing this is a cheap place. But i guess I will stop more often now, and money will not be the reason for it.

Adda bites is your quiet, cozy restaurant/cafe near the kasba food mart, opposite the tax bhavan (don't worry tax skippers, they dont trudge here :-P). Well every restaurant has one thing which pops first to your mind when you reminisce of it, or spend a leisurely evening like me, writing a review about it; for adda bites that thing would be the late service. They dont serve you till they get constant reninders from your stomachs making rumbling noises. However if you are a "sabar ka fal meetha hota hai" type, then this might be a good place for you since the food is quite good. It's cooked very well and tastes awesome with all the flavours coming out perfectly. And I'll totally overlook the fact that we did not have the courage to order strangely named dishes which sounded like there was a hen-fight going on with all the kung-pao and bang-bang; because yeah, who cares about a brief explanation of what you are about to order, right? So about the rest of all about the restaurant, it's a smartly decorated nice place, ideal for a small group of friends to have an "adda" over a delicious meal. (Perhaps they named it like that so you can chat away without noticing how incredibly late they are to serve food). So it all boils down to, do you go to this place? Well definitely worth a shot. Do you go to this place when you are hungry? You rather not if you ain't into cannibalism.

Been there a couple of times with friends in college days.  Neat decor!

These days colleagues order home delivery sometimes. The menu has gone through a change it seems and the quality has gone south. However, the hot piping Chinese food, not overly laden with spices, is a decent excuse to give the spartan hospital canteen a pass once in a while!

This place is just around the ruby crossing. We were drenched in rain and one of our friends wanted to spend some time over chitchat so we went in. The place is spacious and the seating arrangement is also ok. Now for the service they were quite slow.
No one came to offered us the menucard and we had to go over to the counter. The place has a long list of dishes available but as we were not going to have dinner we opted for some chicken lollypop. The dish was nice and was presented well but they took 40 minutes to serve it. We were not interested in any dish but we quite liked the chicken lollypop . We quite hope they improve their service.

Every restaurant should have a purpose and an agenda. The purpose of this place is not to give you excellent or over the top ambience. Nor does it provide a service that deserves great appreciation. However, if I have to evaluate  the purpose this place serves, I would definitely say kudos to Adda Bites. This is one place where you will get superb Chinese food at prices that will make you crave for more. 
The place is indeed cramped and can seat around 10 people together. However if cost is taken into the account you won't complain one bit. 
The quality of the food at the price it comes for drags me to this place regularly. Some of the dishes that are my favourites over here include konjee crispy chicken, chicken in sweet chilli sauce and the fish pepper salt. 
If you want to have good quality Chinese food at extremely low prices do give this place a visit. Recommend!!

A small place, but a good place to hangout. Just next to a busy road, so its not too secluded. But the place is too small, kind of conjusted. The chairs and tables are not comfortable.
I had ordered egg hakka and garlic chicken. The quantity of one plate of each is enough for two people.
The hakka was good, not too grand. But the garlic chicken was surprisingly quite amazing, given the not so impressive ambience n all.
Finl verdict: The food is pretty good and cheap only if you get it packed to eat somewhere else.

Its is one of those places where you can hang out with your friends on a lazy eve. It hardly ever crowded and they will let you sit as long as you want. They are a simple coffee joint which also serves decent food. But the prices are fine, not overpriced atall. If you wont come here u wont miss anything but if you stay near by u can always hangout at this place.

At times you come across people telling you about this awesome small eatery located right next to their home, about how it might be a roadside small shop but serves world class food. Well, adda bites is my that world-famous-in-my-para kind of restaurant. I find the food heavenly, the kind of food which gives you a weird kind of contentment. I have tried almost all of their starters and main courses. I had been there with friends and everyone loved the food. The staff is good, gentle and the service above satisfactory. On the downside, the place is a bit cramped and at times they take very long to serve you your food. But then again that maybe because they prepare the dish after you' ve ordered so that you get served the freshest and tastiest food that comes out of the kitchen.

This is a small little place that is well located and good for a quick snack only. The plus is the pricing which is quite reasonable and quantities are also fair. Don't expect much privacy or good service but I had to meet a friend whose office was next door so they requested me to meet them here and that is how I chanced upon this place. We ordered American Corn Pepper Salt , Crispy Chilli Babycorn and Chicken Spring Roll along with soft drinks. The corn items were nice enough but the spring roll was very oily and not great to taste. Service was not too quick which was fine with us as we were not in a hurry but if you are bear that in mind.By the time we wrapped up the place was quite crowded and they took ages to get the bill. Though cramped for space the decor is nice and bright and its fairly clean.

It was Friday just like any other day and my family was at home and we decided to order  Adda bites which is quite near to our apartment. We gave our order to them and after 30 minutes surprisingly they came and we were shocked as our order was quite a big order. We opened our food container and OMG!! there quantity was so big that it would take 1 day to eat it.I prefer you guys to try baby corn which is absolutely stunning and there price is very less compared to the food.Their home delivery service is like lightning fast.

Adda Bites is a small Chinese/Thai restaurant located in Kasba on R.B. Connector (Rajdanga Main Road). The restaurant quite is popular in the area and as the name suggests, famous for 'Adda'. It is always crowded in the evening but in the afternoon, the place is deserted.

Food from Adda Bites, is pretty good and they are at par with the competition. Starters especially, the Crispy Chilli Baby Corn (which fellow foodies mentioned) is really worth trying. Also in the main course, Chicken in Black Bean Oyster Sauce is nice and contains big pieces of chicken. Pork, Lamb and Prawn items do exist in the menu. Recommendations would be Crispy Chicken in Sweet Chilli Sauce (less spicy), Drums of Heavens (spicy) and Chicken Spring Roll (spicy).

Price and Quantity wise, the restaurant is one of the best in Kasba. Quantity of every item is great, the fried rice and hakka noodles' per plate quantity is more than enough for a person. Also chicken items in the menu have large pieces of chicken and starters also do good job of filling the stomach. Prices are on the lower side considering a tummy filling meal.

Ambiance of the restaurant has really improved as the restaurant did some renovations. Decor of the restaurant is not a matter to complain. However what is worth complain is the crowd management. The place is full of people during the evening time and service will suffer if you visit during that time period. The place is already very small and cramped as they are limited on space. Home delivery service is moderate, takes about 30-45 minutes to my place. Good thing is that their delivery person knows the area very well and can locate houses/apartments located in lanes or off the road easily.

The food here is good but the staff needs to be more friendly and the space feels so cramped ...

A small food joint for adda of a small group. 5 tables are there and hardly 16-20 people can accommodate. 
But the food is really good. People who like spicy food should try Drums of Heaven. Very Spicy. I love their 'Hacca Chilli Pork' and 'Fish in Chili Oyster Sauce'. The problem is the quantity of pork they cook is very limited. So if you are planning to eat pork then reach early. For small adda you can try Iced tea lemon. 
Also carry enough cash as they don't take card. (Though ATM is nearby)

N.B. 5th December is their B'Day... so you will get something extra if you go on that day ;)

Happy eating :)

The place is small but the food is nice.. crispy babycorn is worth trying.  Service is pretty nice and the behavior of the staff is good.

The place is located just off the Ruby hospital crossing and on the kasba connector. The place is small and cramped. However it is pretty crowded because of its close proximity to the engineering colleges nearby. The food is nothing special and the service is pretty poor. However it is perfect for people on a budget . The Crispy Chilli Babycorn is worth trying. The cost is moderate and pretty average considering the location. Try it out if you wana catch up and is on a budget. However, there are other popular destinations down the road and can be considered as well!!!
