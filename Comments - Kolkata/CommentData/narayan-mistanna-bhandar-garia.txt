This is a legendary sweet shop in Garia and I have been here plenty of times.
               I've tried out multiple of their sweets including rasgulla, mishti doi, kalakand, kheer kodom etc and I must say that I have been satisfied with them all.

FINAL VERDICT- I would recommend this shop and must say that the mishti doi is a must try. But I do feel that compared to some other sweet shops, this isn't the most value for money option out there.

The quality of sweets you actually get here justifies their renownce. But i did not find any innovative variant of sweet here . Neither from the oldest recipes of bengali elite tradition or of fusion variant . This place is perfect one if you are into aurhentic regulars . Parking is a pain here plus the place is ever chaotic . This is one of the oldest sweet shop in garia region

A variety of some of the best sweets available here. All those sweet tooths out there must try their mango rosogolla, langcha, mishti doi, and the different types of sandesh they make. Their samosa and radha ballabi are also too good.

The best stuff in and around Garia. Freshness is commendable. Every single item is up to the mark. It is super duper busy everytime. Parking is a pain. I being a sweet buff would totally rate it at par with Balaram Mullick. They have really been doing a super job from a long time.

I love this place. Evrything they sell is fresh and good. The Rosogollas to the Chanar jilipi and Jolbhora and the variety of white sandesh..everything is heavenly! 
Hot favourites are the Mishti Doi and Roshomalai.
The Paneer they sell is best in the town.

This local shop has been faithful to its customers for years. The Rosogolla and Doi (tok doi) are my all time favourites. Other than its sweets, this shop also has a good reputation for singara (bengali samosa) which sells super quick in the afternoons. I personally call it the Uttam Kumar shop (owing to the actor's portrait that hangs from the shop's wall)!

The best Misti Doi you can get anywhere or atleast anywhere that I have been. While all sweets here are good, the Misti Doi is exceptional. Sweet, Creamy, red colored and with a generous layer of Kheer on the top when you buy the 500 gm or 1kg packs. Just thinking about this is making me salivate.

After reading so many positive and healthy reviews of this place, I couldn't resist myself from coming here. After moving from one shop to another I came here and stopped with my father. 

We looking for something but couldn't find. Surprisingly we had far more choices and varities here. I pulled my father all the way long because I wanted to explore what was hidden in them. Nothing can be more happier for a person with sweet tooth like me on birthday. 

One's eyes would grow big after looking at their wide varities of sweets. I was speechless for those few moments I spent there. Every single item in the tray were unique to tempt one to taste and indulge into it. 

I have tasted their preparation and I would without a second thought happily recommend you to give it a chance. The freshness and pureness in their products have made me a fan of their sweets. 

Try out soon if you haven't yet. Happy eating!

This shop is one of the oldest and most popular sweet destination around Garia. I have visited this place plenty of times. The quality of sweets have degraded somewhat. Also, previously different variety of sweets were available. ¬†Now the options have reduced. However, it's still better than other shops.¬†
This place is a must try for all sweet lovers. Chana pora, Roshogolla, Mishti Doi taste delicious. Radhaballobi and Shingara are also great here. This place is comparatively costly, but it's totally worth it!

Located opposite Sitala Mandir, this happens to be one of the popular sweet destinations in and around this place. Although, am not the biggest fan of Roshogolla's, on the insistence of my friend, I decided to try one, and it literally melted in my mouth. Next to come was Chanar Jilibi, which was again a culinary delight. We ended our sweet hunch with Mishti Doi, which again proved to be excellent. The texture was fantastic, and the milk, which was used, was of extremely high quality. Good value for money, there is absolutely no doubt, which there is so much hype and praises about this sweet outlet.

**Location**
At Garia area near Opposite to the Sitala Mandir

**Experience**
I have been to their outlet for a take away and brought some rossogolla and Misti here without taking much risk as I did not have any idea about the place. OmG .. Simple yet very very special is their genre I would say. One of the yummy and tasty Misti doi I have ever had also the rossogolla was freshly made and loved it totally. I am surely not buying sweets from any other shop in this area next time if I need.

I love this place. Located opp to sitala Mandir in Garia, this sweet shop is quite popular amongst residents in and around South Kolkata. They make good quality sweets and hence price is on the higher end which I don't mind, honestly speaking. The mishti Doi is brilliant here. My personal favorite. I also like the chanar jalebi, rosogolla, gulab jamun, malpoa and shingara. üòõ It is always crowded as customers keep flocking to the shop throughout the day. They also have seasonal sweets available. Like during summers they have mango flavored sweets etc. üíñ Must try!

I have tried almost all of their sweets.

The mishti doi is something that has too much sweetness. Full bowl of relaxing smoothy.

My favourites are kesar rajbhog, chanar jilapi, all the sondeshes.

Special one is ice cream sandesh! Do try it.

I was pretty surprised to find such high rating of this sweet shop on Zomato. Zomato reviewers are known to be very strict in rating. Going by that standard ,this shop should have a rating of abut 3-3.2. The reason why it gets good rating is probably the fact that there is no good sweet shop in Garia locality.
I am very sure that if any one of the likes of Ganguram,Banchharam, Balaram Mallick, Kamdhenu,etc. opens their outlet,this place would no longer be the choice of people here. Management as well as staffs are pretty rude,and gets annoyed if you ¬†ask the ¬†price of more than ¬†two sweet varieties.(If they are so busy,they should have price card above each type .)
But the story doesn't end here .Variety is pretty ¬†less ,and prices are more compared to the quality .In short,its just another roadside sweet shop ,catching limelight owing to the ¬†lack of alternative options .
It is high time they change their attitude and take this as a construction criticism . .Otherwise,if they continue with their know-it-all attitude ,they would not be able to survive the competition from renowned sweet shop chains.

One of best sweet shop near Garia..cost is little high but considering the quality of the sweets it doesn't matter much..eating inside the shop is little difficult coz of less free space..

One of the best places in the neighbourhood to get your daily dose of gorom gorom kichuru radha ballavi and those mouthwatering bengali sweets. My father's favourite place and he still goes there every Sunday morning to bring in Kochuri for us. Quintessential bengali breakfast at its best.

Not so good as per rating. This shop has extremely overhyped. I won't say it's good. But compare to the other sweet shop at garia yes you may say that. As per my suggestion if you want to try some good sweet near Garia then try sweets from Misti Mookh at Kamalgachi.

Its just beside my home. No doubt they make good sweets. The misti dahi is amazing. But would prefer if they make less of dry sweets. Most of there sweets are sandesh..

I will stick to my point: South kolkata has absolutely no good sweet shop(not considering balaram,banchharam etc) I had a huge expectation from Narayan(zomato rating >4) but I was disappointed.
Location:Opposite shitala mandir,beside Sugar n spice and below HDFC bank.

Ambience: Like any other sweet shop but their were no houseflies around! 

Food: I have read so much about the mishti doi here that I couldn't have possibly given it a miss! The misti doi was nothing spectacular as pointed out by my fellow zomatians. A normal simple misti doi @200/kg. The behaviour of the staffs were kind of arrogant and I gave trying out other sweets a miss. 
This place is simply overhyped,nothing more.

A small sweet shop located near the kavi Nazrul metro station....Tried their famous 'mithi doi' (sweet curd)...great in taste, The best I have ever eaten... The ambiance is not at all good, but still it's very happening place among the locals... Other desserts are just fine in taste!

DONT GO TO THIS PLACE! From 8 years I have been living in Garia and never am I satisfied with this place. This place has an awkward taste and smell in its sweets! Totally overrated! Quality of ingredients also not good! There are a few more sweet shops in Garia which are as popular and much better in quality

The love for their shingaras & shondesh is what makes me visit this place often! Haven't tasted the rashagollas yet, but will have to, sometimes soon. I'm not much of a 'mishti craving' person, but this place can surely change ones eating pattern with their divine creations.

The best sweet shop of garia... The main  thing is the rasgolla & misti doi. The rasgollas remain spongy all time ... & the samosa in the evening is the best companion with a cup of tea. Must try it.

I felt an outstanding taste when I opt the curd from there and the packaging of this shop also reveals it's standard amongst other sweet shop.

I have been a frequent visitor to this outlet. Without any hesitation I can say that this place has the best mishti doi I have ever had. I would refer everyone to try. Although it has huge variety of sweets but I prefer nolen gur over others. One sad thing about this outlet is that you do need to have luck cause since it has high demand I ended up entering this place all empty. Its always crowded, so take your time be patient and enjoy afterwards.

What to start with when you are a bengali mishti lover. The sweets are very fresh and tasty. The size and the price is in sink with each other. One of the best bengali sweets are available here. Also the shop stuffs ate very good and will recommend you which sweets can last longer and which cant if you want to buy for future use.

It might not be up there with the other mishti maker biggies but they rock the sondesh, roshogolla, mihidana and doi here. If you think this place is cheap you're sorely mistaken. During saraswati and lokkhi pujo you won't get a place to stand. Best mishtir dokaan in Garia. Kudos to you people.

I am not actually a guy with a sweet tooth , but this place had me coming back for more .. Been there only twice but I have become a fan of the gulabjamuns at this place . The shop is situated in one of the crowdiest areas of Garia so it is always full of customers.
This place is probably the best sweet shop in Garia region. It has a lot of varieties and the price is close to reasonable .
But really no complaints when it comes to the taste and quality of the sweets.

This place doesn't have the brand attached to its name but serves good quality sweets at prices comparable to many famous sweet shops in Kolkata. Being at 10 minutes distance from my home, I have had their sweets many times and I have been satisfied with what they offer. 
During festive seasons be sure to stand in a long queue to buy absolutely anything at all. They have a wide array of sweets and most of them are pretty good. I would recommend their malai sweets above others.

Probabbly the best sweet shop of garia. The sandesh they prepare is good and costly. I love the Rasgolla. It's even better than the rasgolla of most of the sweet shops of kolkata. It remains soft and spongy even when it's not hot. Must give it a try. The sweet curd is also good

Most of the sweet shops in Kolkata (Mistanna Bhandar as it they are called) are small shops with a showcase in place for the sweets. They would not give you the feel good feeling which you would otherwise get in large well-known chains like Kamdhenu. This sweet shop near Garia Sitala Mandir is located at a place which is overcrowded almost round the clock. Amongst the croded sweets, the din of street side vendors and the horrible traffic, this sweet shop stands on one side of the road. The size of the shop is medium but you have nice glass doors with air-conditioning. Also, they have quite a good range of sweets to choose from. I was there for mishti doi and they gave me 1kg mishti doi pre-packed in Plastic Container (normally sweet shops would give it to you in earthen containers). The taste of doi was very good. A good shop to go to for sweets.
