What if I tell you that you can get burgers,sandwiches,chocolate shakes,cold coffee,french fries etc almost like those of the popular fast food joints but only at half the prices? Students living in Jadavpur campus area, this place is a must shot for all of you and I can guarantee you will want to order again and again here. Thanks to my semester when stepping out seemed wastage of time,I ordered for a combo at this place and within 20minutes the guy was at my door with my food. Ordering online also gave me a promo discount so what better could I have asked for!
The French fries were sufficient,crispy and yummy.
The cheese and corn sandwich was stuffed and almost oozing with mayo,corn, onion,capsicum. The size is big and very filling for one person.
The egg mayo sandwich was sumptuously made. Taste was damn good. 
The chocolate shake was perfectly packaged and was so refreshing.
I am very impressed by this place and I recommended this to many friends who stay in hostel or paying guest.
Totally deserves 5 rating. Thumbs up for CFC!

I have ordered grilled chicken sandwich, chicken cheese sandwich, chicken club sandwich. The club sandwich is good to taste and quite wholesome.
