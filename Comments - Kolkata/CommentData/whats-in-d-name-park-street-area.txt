This is one of the worst pub in town. The staff here have no manners.. They are rude with zero customer sense. They judge you on your dressing sense and fluency in english.. They are highly disrespectful. They should understand that it is not they who are serving us fr free . We pay them hefty amounts in return of their low grade services. They only run by serving alcohol to school going kiddos. Complete disappointment. The drinks are also not upto the work.. They taste flat and are over priced. They deny entry by saying * only for regulars* then please put the board stating the same and stop fooling people.

WHAT's IN D NAME? There's nothing in the name or the place.¬†These people do not even know anything known as 'Hospitality' and is managed by a stupid and arrogant person, who claims to be the owner of the place. We've been to this place for 4-5 times, but instead of that we've been denied entry to this place, because according to them, we are unknown and they haven't seen us before. Their reply, "You've to visit us from Monday and then you'll be a regular visitor and will be allowed inside." FYI, We're into work, and it's not possible for office goers to visit this place every day in a week, and if we had to visit then we would be going to other places with some little bit of extra bucks, which can offer better services,better songs, good djs, better drinks(even the drinks aren't that good) with better crowd and also better staff and ambience and a better sense of hospitality of treating people. We do not even know for what reasons we have denied entry, we've visited to so many places and have somewhat good ranks in zomato as reviewers, none of the restaurants or pubs behaved like this before.I will never visit this place again and will ask everyone not to go to this place, for the first time ever I am posting such negative review for a restaurant. The only reason people visit this place is, it is somewhat cheap(but not cheapest) compared to other clubs in the area, but believe me, it is over-hyped and nothing more, the small dance floor and a small smoking zone to choke people to death, not so special drinks, bogus dj, WHAT's IN D NAME? NOTHING IN THE NAME OR PLACE!¬†Maybe this place got into some serious trouble recently because of something that was going inside for which they've changed the behavior, but it'll lose many of its potential visitors soon, I can promise this much, unless it stops treating the visitors this way.WILL NEVER VISIT AGAIN! :)

The stock exhange prices are great..sometimes it is really low..There was a time i visited this place almost every saturday but now hardly gets time..The only problem of this place is they charge cover charges for stag entry on weekends after 6..But they are redeemable inside..so it is ok..

Being a zomato reviewer with a good rank, I'm posting such a negative comment for the first time ever, this is the worst pub,over hyped and don't even serve proper alcohol. This is the fifth time we've been rejected entry in this pub, despite the fact that we've visited this pub for four times before, because as per the stupid person, standing as the owner in the front of the gate, we're "unknown faces". I don't know what's wrong with this place or us or the person, believe me everyone, you can spend some more money or even the same and go to better places like Roxy or tantra but not this place, a small dance floor, and a small smoking room to make everyone feel claustrophobic, but they pretend like some awesomely rated club, but it's not. The next we're never going to visit.. and we're surely going to suggest everyone not to visit this disgusting place ever.

It has BSE section ! The price of the drinks varies according to demand ! The crowd is really cool & the only cafe where the dance floor is  full at 6pm in the evening ! The Dj is amazing n plays superb tracks ! The staffs are polite ! The kababs mocktails n cocktails r really good ! Must try Queen VICTORIA ! I had ordered shisha too~kiwi spring water n teen paan !

One of the most hip places in the city. It surely deserves a visit or two. Awesome ambience. The club has two sections. The second floor has decent seating with glass walls and an open rooftop attached to it. You gotta go down to the first floor to get the real vibe. Awesome DJ and dance floor. Hookahs were smooth af. Do try the Vanilla hookah with milk base cuz it was mind blowing! LIIT was was Lüî•üî•T! Took me and my friend quite a while to finish it all. I personally recommend the Desperados beer. It's so much different from the rest. The Murgh Da Bhatta Pizza was really delicious. It's got a stock exchange concept for it's drinks which is quite nice. Overall it's a nice place to chill out and spend your weekend, but it'd be a pocket pinch of about 2k for two (if you wanna get quite tipsy).

A nice place and it has its own charm. Visiting in the Christmas weekend, it was all hustle and bustle. They have a BSE and prices go up and down according to demand. The snacks were great and quantity was sufficient. The music is a little on the louder side and the dance floor is busy. So, get in if you want to dance and groove, but if you want somewhere to relax and sip a beer, this is not the place.

Whats in d name ( naam mai kya hai ) is running only because they offer alcohol to below 18 ones . The bouncers attitude is not at all good , they just remember faces of person who either give them tip or have some contacts . The stag rates are too high and sometimes while the offers are going on ,the bouncers simply denies entry to non regular person. Its so disgusting to see school boys in widn drinking alcohol and behaving so absurd.  It is basically a place where your contacts along with spending extra money matters . The Staff‚Äôs aren‚Äôt friendly and have some serious attitude.  The food is not good . Students of ages14 ,15,16 simply come there , chuck their money on drinks and alcohol just to show off and boast among their peers  and the best part is their id aren‚Äôt asked while entering nor before ordering a drink.  My personal experience was a bad one  the pizza which came wasn‚Äôt even okay( chalo koi nahi ) , the only thing i liked was music nothing else.  Its a good place to dance and listen music if you are bored of listening music from your phone or  from your portable speaker.  I would like to suggest people to choose their weekend plan wisely.
Thanks for reading,

What's in d name? Nothing! It's a bullshitty place with arrogant staff and immature people.
The crowd here is not that great and even though the place looks good these people loot the customers. Like seriously the drinks out here is overpriced . They showed us in the tab the price of the drinks we were paying for which was like RS 75 or rs100 for 30 ml and according to that we ordered the quantity we required. Then in the bill it was three times more and they denied everything. Much better places to hang out in like Sisha-BSE than this . Only thing which was okay was the sweet dish that we ordered . Never try liit here it's filled with ice and not at all strong and charging rs630 for that which is a waste of money.Just look at the bill and you guys will see that even Coke is super duper overpriced because they take one bottle of coke as 2 and we need to pay the cost of two bottles for one small bottle. üòë
Would give this place a minus rating if possible :3

One of those hip places that is sure to make one feel happening and energetic just by the charged up ambience. Located in the party hub of the city, you cannot give this place a miss if you're looking for that perfect place to hang out for a drink while also letting your hair down a bit. Good DJs, a bar in stock exchange style, a spacious lounge makes it tick. Been here quite a number of times, and each time I was impressed with the drinks and food. Going to come back for sure!

Location- camac street and park street crossing.
Crowd- u can only expect a decent crowd on saturdays. Else, they are mostly vacant.
Music- One of the worst music i have ever heard in any pub. It creates such a dull ambience.
Bar- a very small area with a very few varieties of shots. They will just offer coffee shots again and again.
Not at all recommended, u will be wasting your weekend.

One of the most happening pubs in town. Post 7p.m. it's always filled up and sometimes you'll find a queue up front. The DJ has been amazing each time I've gone clubbing here. The dance floor is spacious and the lights are great but would be better if it was a tad bit more dim. The hookah here is mind-blowing and if you're definitely gonna be a fan for it. In food, I'd recommend the Tandoori Platter. The quantity is too less but tasted decent. Though some items were a bit too oily. Drinks are quite cheap here,the whisky especially. Also at times they have happy hours on some days, so make sure you ask your server that before placing an order. 
Their Halloween themed party was absolutely fabulous and the decor was impressive. Try to make time in the weekends to have a good time and if you're looking for a filled up club.
Although, nowadays it's the high school crowd mostly found at this place more often.
Overall, good place for clubbing nights with cocktails & drinks and some finger food to go with.

Today we I went, along with 4 of my cousins to  visit this place," What's in the name " around 5:15 pm  and we were denied entry !! They told us that their place is reserved and we can't enter . We stood there for sometime and surprisingly found that they were allowing others to enter without any restriction, which clearly proved that there WASN'T any RESERVATION of any kind !!! Even the sign board outside read " WELCOME OPEN " . When we again went and asked them , they repeatedly told us that it was reserved 

I was highly dissapointed by their behaviour and decided to visit Scrapyard and we were greeted pretty well there :) :)

This newly opened joint has become so popular among the youth. It has got two sections. The upper terrace section is a bit calm. But the lower section has got an amazing vibe. The DJ plays typical Bollywood songs which creates the vibe. Food here is nice. Tried the mixed sauce pasta and nachos.
However the price here is a bit high and that may pinch you but it is definitely worth it if you are visiting it on a Friday or a Saturday evening. Definitely visiting again.

Definitely going here again and again. Yes there are issues with the seating arrangement as too many people come peak time. But l personally don't mind waiting for something so delicious.  
The food hookah and drinks are too expensive compared to other night clubs.. 
I'm rating it 2.5 only bcoz of the behaviours of the staff and bouncers. Many times I went there and found that some private party is going on and they don't let us enter with no proper information so this is what I hate about it the most. Hope next time if I visit I could rate it more.

This is the most unprofessional place I've ever been to.
Me and my friends (2 girls and 3 guys) were dancing together, enjoying their time when suddenly they were asked not to dance on the dance floor, as it was against their rules, which was completely fine, but then I went to speak to the so-called 'manager', who was apparently busy smoking a hookah. I went to speak to him regarding any sort of misunderstanding or problems which had occurred, I wanted to talk it out. The 'manager' didn't really take it nicely, he seemed like a waiter (first of all), he was rude, sounded like an illiterate, was disrespectful, kept smoking the hookah, didn't listen to a word I was trying to say, and lastly, he told us to "**** OFF".
Firstly, I've never seen anyone so 'professional'. A manager who tells their customers to **** off. Secondly, he not only insulted the customers, but he indirectly disrespected the owner of the place. I'm sure the owner didn't give him any orders to disrespect the customers or ask them to **** off. I've been to better, classy, higher places than this. I've never felt so insulted, ever. Then, why what's in d name? Because you guys hire people who are illiterate and hence, disrespectful. Because you guys let 14, 15, 16 year olds enter the pub. Because you guys don't show any sort of decency towards your customers. Because you guys don't consider our problems as problems. That is why you guys lose customers, with a bad image.
The manager needs to stop working, go home, get himself educated, learn to show respect, and definitely needs to stop smoking the hookah when a person is trying to speak to him.
I am never ever coming to that place. You guys might not give a shit about it, but you guys definitely lost customers. Which is basically, a loss, for you guys. Posting the video and this post, everywhere. Sorry. But you people crossed a limit y'all shouldn't have. Best of luck to the owner of the place. I'm sure, he will fire the people who are making him difficult for him to do the business.

The place is very famous among the college goers. The much hyped place hasnt much to talk about. Visited the place on a saturday evening after an embarrassing ordeal of being disallowed to enter for being a stag, and having friends waiting inside, but sorry gender equality doesn't apply here?!
Headed to the first floor. The place was a bit congested. Since I had friends waiting so had the opportunity to be seated. The food and shisha were undoubtedly very good. So score ups due to food only.

Its that sleazy club where you find youngsters going crazy, smoking, drinking - vomits and pass-outs too in the very crunched suffocating space they have to offer.

No doubt it's a nice place but I see so many children out there. One need to be 21+ to enter a pub but children under 18 are also allowed. I mostly see class 11 and 12 students over there. Yesterday I went to widn and it was 900 bucks for a base like WTF. I AM NEVER GOING BACK. I gave 2 stars just cause of the ambiece and the interior

The overall experience was pretty amazing. Though the dj disappointed us a bit.
We went to park street and got really disappointed with Tantra and M bar(shut due to some reason) and were literally stuck.
Until we stumbled upon this savior. The ambience was quite cool and lively. Get shit drunk here. This is the place. 
Pizza was nice, though pasta was incredibly amazing. We had almost 5 liits shared among 3 people. Some beers and hookah.
The only thing I didn't enjoy was the dj playing some really dull songs. Inspite of requesting and that too by several people he actually didn't play the songs you can dance full mode on. They should really change their dj.

One of the happening pubs in the city, with a good crowd and good music. They have a wide range of hookahs and drinks to catch up with the party mood. However, the food is overpriced and tastes pretty bad. Recommended if you want to hang out and party, but not if you're looking to satiate those hunger pangs!

What's in the name that's what they want to prove but failed. Its at the stone thrown distance from the Park Street crossing besides Bodega Cantina Y Bar.  This place is apt for party and getting tipsy with chums (Especially‚Äã on Friday & Saturday night). The ambience is pretty good and the high chairs add to the decor with electric and dimmed lights is just perfect. Rooftop expirence is also available here. This place is not so spacious but still segregated into a dance floor, bar section, sitting area and smoking zone. Personally none of the dishes were too good to linger or to convince the foodie to visit again. The price of the hard drinks keep varying with time, just asked in the stock market I  really had bad experience with their LITT but Fire üî• Shots were amazing. The staffs are friendly but not well behaved as they forced us to pay service tax with GST as its compulsory to pay by their own rules and make their customers fool. Also I hadn't good experience with the DJ and extremely disappointed as I asked him to play a track and he directly to do so. Rather I had great experience with the bar section. The bartenders were very professional and courteous. Pocket friendly only for drinks on weekdays.

Meal for two :- 2000 approximately (prices are subject to change to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, market rates)

Food Quality :- 4/5
Food Quantity :- 4/5

The only problem is of the staff , they are bit very arrogant and this annoys the people who are in such a jovial mood. The place is small , yet it attracts the most of the people of kolkata here.  So on an average the only bug is the 'staff'.

The mutton Kabab was cold as ice and the fish kabab was hard to chew. Left the place immediately after finishing the watery drink.

P.S. they are also charging service tax @8% for no good reason.

The ambience is amazing. The alcohol pricing follows the Stock Exchange policy. Dance floor available. The DJ plays good mixes thus pumping the mood. And he starts around 5-6pm so with everyone with an early curfew at home can come here to enjoy the late night disco experience of clubs at early hours. The area is not too big hence it gets crowded early, specially on weekends which calls for High Cover Charges and allowing only Couple entry which is the only drawback.

The Manager Zeeshan is extremely arrogant and refuse to meet when called to. He seems to be very busy and uncooperative. It was more than an hour that he kept delaying and did not turn up. It was only because of dipak and his team's courteous behaviour that made me sit. However I have no complain with the food and drinks but definitely the manager needs to be more customer friendly.

So what's in d name?
But there is also something that should not bother you *what's in the gender*.
Itna inequality toh humare desh me nahi hoga jita yaha hai.
So people, yesterday I went to this place and to my surprise I and my *female* friends were allowed to go inside that too without a cover charge. (Thanks for that)
Later on when my male friends arrived , they asked from them Rs1500/-
And its not like that they came after an hour so they started charging cover.
They came just after 3 mins to be exact.
Isn't it disgusting????
And they do not have manners to talk to people.
Unprofessional unmannered people there.
So much inequality.
No doubt the place must be most happening in Kolkata right now.
But this is something not expected
Your rate varies.
Of course you want to earn.
Then show some equality
Charge from all of us or don't charge at all.
Maybe this is how club works.
But if it had happened an hour after I would have considered but just after few mins. Cannot believe.
We say there is no inequality between men and women.
Alas, I thought you guys are educated
My misconception.
And please teach your men some manners .
Thanks.

Very Small area once crowded they send others to the roof top. Food is not up to the mark. We ordered Garlic Bread (Taste was OK), Pizza (very hard crust and taste was pathetic), Chicken meet Cheese burger (We found no cheese only mayo was there), and Chicken with vegetables (Taste was good).

Well for starters, it becomes cramped up inside because of the less space available. The bar is average. It's crowded all the time (mostly school kids) , typically a clubbing scene just shabby and not so cool. It becomes impossible to stay their for long but well that is again something that is subjective. Better clubs in the same area like monkey bar and club boudoir.

Interiors were good
The Music was great as usual and makes you hit the dance floor pretty quickly...

Had heard volumes about this place but sadly, it didn't quite live up to it's expectations. Had opted for their outdoor seating. Were lucky enough to get the moving cabin which was pretty cool. When I informed the servers that I have mouth ulcers and won't be able to have anything spicy, they blatantly refused on my face saying they won't be able to offer anything for me as customisation is not possible. Thus had to settle for the normal cheese garlic bread and French fries. The mocktail and the cocktail were decent enough. The ambience and place was decent. Wish the hospitality was little more upgraded.

This place has become quite popular over the past few months,I had also heard a lot about it from a few friends so I decided to give it a visit with my girl and a few friends,it was a friday evening so the rush was huge and there was no seating space ,the atmosphere was okayish with the DJ playing mediocre music wasn't bad but nothing great either.After hustling for a while we found a table and ordered chicken pizza's which tasted pretty good as compared to other pubs.It took them almost half an hour to serve the pizza,maybe because of the huge rush but still they should have been quicker and they also took approx 10 minutes just to hand over the menu.

Initially loved the place, but later on the staff created a mess , lost my purse as well as earphones there , the cctv footage couldn't help , the bouncers are rude, and got my contact number from some unknown source and kept on messaging until I blocked him! Thanks!

The name of the restaurant is correctly given as "What is in the name" !! 
Because the fame comes with the name! 
The place is only good if you are there for hookah beer whiskeys and wine! 
If you think you will have a gala time without placing order for those.. you better watch out! 
Not only the people out there will be least bothered about your table, they will also forget whether the food has been served or not! And when you shall walkout on being pissed off with the service, then you better keep in mind to pay the bill for the music and air u have consumed (since these are however free, bill amount shall be equal to what you have just ordered but wasnt fortunate enough to eat :D )

The dance floor is spacious, the DJ plays some nice stuff which gets you grooving. The hookah is very nice as well. You'll like it for sure!

Though a very happening place, but the service is very slow. Waiters hardly come to your table even after calling out at them so many times. This place only scores for its ambience and dance floor.

Loved this place. Located in the park street- camac street crossing, this place gives me a 'Baga beach' (Goa) feel. I had a lot of beer that day so forgive me for not remembering what I ate. I do remember that the shisha was decent and I liked the food. ;)
The only reason I deducted one point was coz I don't like misuse of language. If 'd' was 'the' it would've been 5/5.

Visited this place on 1st May..
really disappointed with their food, service and hookah.
It is only a hyped place with nothing good except music on weekends and the dance floor.
Ordered for mix sauce penne pasta, cheese garlic bread, teen pan rose hookah.. pasta was tasteless.. and the hookah was very disappointing.. but cheese garlic bread was awesome no doubt.
Staff are rude.. they will stare in such a way that they want you to leave the place asap.
Highly disappointed with this review hyped place !

Edit : Visited again on 6th of July, this time the server was really good.. I think his name was "Mr. Mobind" he was really good.
Service was good that day.
Teen paan rose hookah was not so good but kiwi spring water was okay
Mix sauce pasta was not so good, the taste was not balanced.
Cheese garlic bread was super amazing (as always)d
Potato wedges were pathetic.
Fries were good.
Music was quite okay that day..
Overall enjoyed, would like to change my rating to 4 from 3.5 just because of Mr. Mobind's service.

Food is good...nothing too remarkable, i liked the crispy fried lotus stem. Drinks are decently priced...should try long island ice tea. They make good sheesha.

"What's in D name" makes me ask the question what's in the place?
Being slightly on the expensive side, the restaurant has average ambience with average food taste. The quantity of dishes served is decent and not filling for two.
Catching the attention of the staff, everytime we wanted to order something, was a tremendous challenge. 
Overall, definitely not the place to visit if you want to have a good time.

It was a surprise when it was heard that they charge entry fees on Friday Saturday and Sunday and dont provide cover charges with it. We were 10 of them still were not allowed.. don't know why... But any how managed to get inside and was shocked to see the crowd as the time passed... no space on the floor to move, no helpers to take orders except @divya .. she was excellent... But crowd out here is very cheap .. and I m sure they don't charge Stag entry or couple entry ... But what was wrong with them no idea... Food at par... Not upto Mark..

This place is very much easy to locate, but was a total disappointment. First, the service is very bad and disgusting, they didn't even mange to get a seat for us, so we had to manage of our own. Ordered Harissa chicken which was this pathetic that we didn't afford to order anything else. Music was low, dance floor was empty. Sad that this place is not that happening rather boring and not at all fun.

Pathetic,.......
No wonder this place already has so many poor reviews. This place deserves this and needs to shut down if they can't behave properly with their customers. Does this place only allow couples entry? Its fine if they are following some guidelines but they can be polite while mentioning it. I visited the place last night with my friends. One of my friend politely asked the guy at entrance whether they only allow couples and he asked my friend to step back and even pushed him. We dint create a scene at that time but hopefully someone from management might notice this here.

Haven't had much experience in the Kolkata clubbing community but What's in D name sure sets a darn high standard for a beginner. The first thing you should order is the LIIT pitcher which is the best thing I've tried of theirs. The Sangria pouches which go on flash sales are things you shouldn't miss out on. Lit decor, lit people, a go to heaven for clubbing enthusiasts. All in all, a pleasant experience. 

Friendly staff and user-friendly ordering experience are huge positives.

This place is really disapointing in terms of their service. They judge people on how they look in order to grant them entry. Their management should really look into the matter because their so called staff misbehave with tons of people on a daily basis and this way they are losing on a lot of clientage. I've had an experience in which the staff refused to grant my friend entry because he did not like his "profile"¬†
This kind of behavior will not be tolerated for long. They should start behaving properly cause otherwise someone might just throw a legal notice at them.

I just love the crazy ambience and the loud music on the first floor! The crowd is one of the best in town because of the restricted entry especially during the weekend.
The entry restrictions is the only low point of the place. The place is small and over crowded during the weekends you can hardly find a place to sit! 
I prefer the 1st floor over the terrace.

Even after telling the DJ a couple of times to play dancing tracks, he continued to play all the outdated songs.. he was least interested in playing good music and all the time he was busy with his phone.. the food was ok ok... 
You can visit this place if you're a big fan of Falguni Pathak because you'll find all that outdated music.

I went their on a saturday evening with 4 other friends of mine. From the entrance itself a person can make out that how happening the place is. On weekends the couples get a free entry but the stags need to pay a certain amount of cover charge as it is in most of the clubs of kolkata. We ordered a 8" pizza which was delicious and we ordered the most popular drink, LIT which was a bit expensive due to surge pricing but it was perfectly blended. Overall it was a crazy experience and I look forward to visiting it again.

Location was very hard to find, they have a little board above the place. The night was good , but one thing I can not understand that you place an order and by the time the staff walked to the bar they forgot the order, so after 10minutes we called someone else who were amazed that we did not receive any drinks, ¬†then they took our order again and guess what the drinks still never arrived lol, ¬†in the end we had to argue with the staff , then they appointed a sensible person who was very attentive and made sure we got everything we ordered all night, coming from abroad we were not impressed with the service, the foods were ok, ¬†we order prawns, pizza and garlic bread with alcoholic drinks all night, hey it a big shame as the place is lovely being on the roof top, this place is recommended for people who hold on to the same drink all night and don't order foods , that way you will love this place lol shame as can be a brilliant place, music was great , I can say it was an expensive night though , so next time we will give it a miss, very expensive prices and food below standard , staff lazy , overall staff need replacing and watch the staff carefully otherwise you might just get over charged on your bar bill. They think they can do this when you have had a few drinks, they will try it on and when caught they will apologise. Shame really. I hope the owner can see what‚Äôs happening in this environment.

I spent my birthday night at WIDN. Had heard lots about it and it's very popular among younger crowds. Alcohol is priced as per demand - there is no fixed rate. Since we went on a weekday night, it was relatively cheaper. Surprisingly, unlike most bars, the food was very tasty. It complimented the drinks well and were delicious and easy to snack on. 

Cheesy chicken 65 was by far the best dish! Cheese d bomb and veg cigars are also highly recommended! Wasn't too excited about the Harissa chicken and funghi marinate. They are all priced between 150 and 200 rupees. 

Special mention to the dessert platter! Couldn't think of a better way to end the evening than with 4 delicious desserts! 

My only issue was the staff was a little curt. It is understandable as they were under pressure because it was quite full, but they asked us to move tables 3 times and refused to believe that we had more people joining us who were already on their way! Moreover, they insisted on seating us near the smoking room even though we asked them not to 
Nonetheless, definitely a fun place to hang out, listen to music and snack!

Being an outsider..I found this place really cool..young crowd..groovy music..drinks listed on bse were really  great..and the service was really impeccable.

But I would suggest you not to go on a Friday or Saturday.... Coz if u r a single Guy ..u might have to go through vishal shrivastav(as claimed) the director .. who is adamant ..arrogant ...has no customer sense. Zero customer satisfaction and obsession..who doesn't listens to anything..understands gibberish...!
I request you to kindly understand that u might look at it at a safety point of view ..but you have bouncers..let them do their job.

I request the management to look into this and understand things from customer point of view.
This might not hamper your ratings here but yes I was disappointed and I would never suggest any of my circle associates for this place.

The interiors of the club are really nice. The club has a really standard crowd coming up on Friday night and weekends. The djs can be a tad better. The pricing is similar to the Bar Stock Exchange concept which keeps fluctuationg so you can expect it to burn a hole in your pocket during peak hours. Overall a good place for the Kolkata partygoers.

So, everytime I passed by the bend from park Street, this place, tucked away, anyways held my curiosity. One fine evening, my husband and I went in to grab a few drinks and a quick bite. There are two levels, the first floor is mainly for dancing and the second, for the roof top lounge experience.
The service is meh, I mean we asked for onion rings and got cut onion slices instead. The pitcher of margarita (we ordered watermelon and basil) was unique - a huge longitudinal breaker, with pipes to drink from. It tasted good but didn't create enough buzz. Perhaps it didn't have enough vodka. The food, though good, was little in quantity for the price. The Indonesian bharwan aloo, were perhaps regular ones. I didn't see any Indonesian element to it. The veg tagine, on the other hand was wonderful. The accompanying pilaf was masha Allah!

I would definitely come back for the vibe, food and ambiance. This seems like a popular place and rightly so. Service needs a little upping.

Well, the hottest party destination for the youth of Kolkata. 
Located at a very prime location, the place has the best music in the city. As the club area is a little smaller in size, the music rebounds in pretty well and is amazing . Coming to the booze, two well stocked bars with a software system deciding the price with the concept of demand and supply, the booze comes out to be very economical. During Rush hours , prices do go up but during weekdays, it's kind of the cheapest bar in Kolkata where one can get a peg of  Old Monk  for 33 bucks. Crowd is very classy and there are almost equal number of boys and girls as stag entry is restricted during rush hours. Moreover, the best place in the city of joy for a perfect Saturday night experience.

Strategically located between Park Street and Camac Street, Whats in Da Name is a favourite amongst the youngsters of the city, again, a bar stock exchange.
The two storied bar/nightclub is a welcoming place with a club and dance floor on the 1st floor and with open air seating on the 2nd floor. 
The places boasts of a wide beverage menu with moderate pricing. For higher efficiency, the outlet has two bars which facilitate the service of drinks on the 1st floor and one on the 2nd floor. 
The place has great food and is of superior quality for its very competitive pricing. The four cheese pizza is always a good choice. 
The ambience with the great music is very inviting and makes you feel like partying even if you really aren't up for it.
The service is fast and even though the place is always crowded, you're never really waiting for very long for your food/drink order. I would like to mention Priyanka Singh's name here for her efficient service and order taking skills. 
Always willing to help, with a genuine smile, her effort is commendable!
The bartenders are great and they really know how to make wonderful cocktails/mocktails as per the choice of the customer and also upswell. 
The biggest plus point though is the fact that What's in Da Name has valet parking and the drivers are courteous and again, efficient. 
Entry does get difficult on weekends for the ones who aren't that regular which does bother quite a few people but that only shows the high demand the outlet has. 
Overall, What's in da name is a great place to be at and I'd suggest you go there on a Saturday night post 9pm if you wanna see it at its best!

Was seated in the rooftop.. the decor there was quite normal. Nothing great especially cause the building was not a high rise. Service was fast. One thing i have to mention was the washroom! I have never seen a more cleaner and beautiful washroom in any pub in kolkata! Quite expensive if you are going on a weekends.
Next few visits were on the first floor which definitely has a better environment. The club scene starts quite early cause mostly the crowds are college goers. Saturdays are quite crowded. Sundays are less crowded.

Went here when I was in Calcutta during Xmas time! Simply the best time to be in the city. My husband and I were looking for some nice hukah places to chill and ended up here. Although we reached around 3pm in the afternoon there was quite a good crowd already settled! Liked the fact that there were couple of bouncers at the entrance and hence the crowd is regulated! 
We loved the interiors and the ambience! Being afternoon the music was not very loud but good tracks were playing. We really enjoyed our time there. The hukah was very smooth and the starters we ordered - both veg and non veg were very tasty and delivered promptly. One of the servers was very taciturn and not responding properly when I asked for a red bull which was not chilled but then another server came and got me my drink. 
Overall a very nice pub and hukah place to go enjoy with your friends right in the middle of the city!

Heard a lot about this place but the day ¬†I decided to go the experience was soo bad, ¬†in general, I ignore bad behaviours at places like this but this pub was way above the level of patience.
SPOILER ALERT
1. they may decide to give you the drink they way they want
¬†2. cocktails may follow their recipe
3. a bar where bouncers at the gate may not allow you¬†
4 BOUNCERS may directly ask you , "hey man, where are you going " ¬†at the entry....?
5. possibly the only bar where single men not be allowed¬†Well,¬†
maybe in some cases their motto becomes
WHATS IN A BEHAVIOUR....

Place : 1.5/5 straight passage wiith poor sitting arrangements
Staffs : 2/5 not trained to serve the customers
Manager and a guy name Vishal were very like unprofessional.
Cost of 1 Budweiser pint = Rs.566
Total waste of money and time.
Wont suggest to anyone. Total mood spoiler!!!

After loitering around the park street checking christmas preparations, we decided to come in to this place to save our tired selves. First floor was extremely crowded and music was blasting so loud, that no matter how loud I screamed to move through the crowd, nobody could hear me. Loud bollywood items played throughout. After I managed to move out, we went to the rooftop area. This place was so much better. Taste and quantity were decent. But the service took extremely long n to top it up they placed my order at wrong table. So ya!!

Best place for boozers. Dim lighted Ambience having music with the whole long dance floor, and an attractive bar place, comfortable sitting arrangements.
Here you can get hookah at Rs 500.
And prices of drinks fluctuate every now and then like what happens in stock exchange bars. If you are lucky, you can even get a peg of rum at Rs 22. 
We had 4 shots of vodka, 1 budweiser, a pitcher of beer, 2 pegs of rum and a breezer which in total was Rs1400.
So it's a bit costly, though depends totally on choice of drinks you are having. 
Food menu was large, though we dint try any. 
Otherwise, a good place to get high and enjoy with your friends.

This restaurant is the new talk in town. Everywhere you go people keep talking of how great What's in D name is. Super excited, I too visited the pub.  
There are two levels. The upper level was closed and hence we were made to sit in the lower level.  I expected the place to have a good music taste. But to me it was ripped of iTunes.  You might expect the DJ  to save the situation. But he took baby ko bass pasand hai too seriously and post DJ the music still sacked but with extreme bass.  
Coming to food.. It is decent. The portions small. And for a pub.. Expected it's drink ordering phone not to be cracked and rather top notch. *Sigh* The taste however was the only saving grace here. 

Order Highlights: 

Pesto Pizza 

Tandoori Platter 

Felt looted on my drinks though.

Probably my favourite pub in Kolkata. It starts pretty early which is a pro for me. One of the main reasons i lile this place is because the crowd is decent.They maintain the class and quality of the crowd quite diligently,but even then they should start checkimf5 some id's . It's pretty reasonable and the music is very good.the people at the gate,  specifically 1 guy is rude as hell god knows why though.

Perfect party place in kolkata. Went with friends a month back, really liked their peppy modern decor and the ambience. Even this place has stock exchange concept of alcohol pricing. We had the basic four cheese pizza which was nice, but could have a tad more bit of cheese! Well the servers were really suggestive and well behaved. All in all this place puts on a good show with the most young crowd and amazing music.

They have pathetic service, unbearbale attitude issues and they are very serious about turning off their air-conditioners sharp at 11:50 PM and cannot wait for the guests to leave (forced to leave) even if it's someones birthday at 12am !!

The place is big. They have valet parking. They gave wi fi and chargers at every table. The food is good compared to the price. The jerk chicken pizza and the tandoori platter is what we ordered. 
The place serves alcohol as a stock exchange would. The servers are nice and helpful. Recommended!!

Unacceptable behavior of co-owners  (management as well) & bouncers. I suppose one of the owner's , was in shorts that doesn't own him a batch to be recognized as an owner, was bossing around unnecessarily. Bouncers kinda assaulted without even knowing the matter.
They created a scene out of nothing all of a sudden and then accepted their fault . During revisit gave shit like you people are banned. This place is another example for what we usually face in Kolkata i.e Unpleasant Hospitality .
Congratulations City of Joy you got a new place with Shitty Management !

I love the location, the interior and the atmosphere in general. It is highly affordable too. I was surprised at how low the bill came even though we had ordered so much. I love the ambience, the crowd, the music. The management is very nice as well. I definitely feel that this is the next big hit joint among the youngsters. I'd definitely visit often and recommend others to do so too.

The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER ¬†

16.10.16, with a couple of friends. Ordered a pizza at 9.30 , and paid the final bill by 10.15pm, pizza wasnt delivered by then. After a lot of hustle bustle pizza was deilvered at 10.30, the time we were about to leave. The problem started when we asked for the refund of pizza amount. The manager started shouting and threatning us, so much so that he even pointing his fingers at my wife told his female bouncers " Isko leke jao yahan se" . ¬†Only after after all this had happened ¬†we see the face of the owner, only to come and try and console us.

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†ENTER THIS PLACE AT YOUR ¬†OWN PERIL

Most happening place in Kolkata, city of Joy. Food, shisha,  as well as drinks available. Sitting as well as dance floor arrangements are there. Mostly standing crowd, as less place to get the tables, but no use sitting there. Music beats are good enough. Staffs were polite and friendly. Loved the place. 
Highly recommended.

Visited during Durga Puja on the night of Nobomi with a few friends. The space is well-managed as it's only a long stretch of area. Although the seatings are not sufficient if you're going to market this lounge in such a grand manner. The alcohol prices follow the "Stock Market". We ordered the LIIT which was pretty good. Kahl√∫a shots were the usual. Pizza is amazing, so much better than so many lounges and pubs.
Now, the staff is terrible. I had to order Teacher's 50 for myself and a friend, but the bartender was missing for a good 5 minutes, so I left my order with the cashier. But when I returned, the bartender had poured me Teacher's Hiland and demanded I pay about 1,000 for it as he had run out of Teacher's 50. The problem being, how can you put me a drink I didn't ask for, telling me "it's the cheapest Teacher's available"? Do I look like a fool? I had been asking for two cocktails for about 20 minutes and nobody bothered to take my order. Ridiculous!
The Ladies' toilet is disgusting, the basin was floating in puke. Definitely not visiting again.

Went there around 8:30pm on a Sunday and as expected, it was crowded as hell. We didnt get a table at all so we were standing for hours. The person behind the bar was pretty nice, but one of the server knocked my corona. They were not courteous enough to offer me a new one so i had to drink the half one. The crowd mostly got students there with backpacks and all. They play good music there and the hookah was pretty good.

This is one of the recently opened places on Camac street, and still getting a table easily on a Saturday night is a dream come true, people there love eating and therefore you have way too many food options and all almost full. After shifting from one table to the order we finally settled in (reason as the first table was bit big and had a mandate minimum billing, weird or should I say money making tactic). We had we ordered a Sheesha to begin with, as we had gone there to chill and pass some quality time. The Sheesha was good, there were also a few Handy Board Slate and chalks kept on the table, so we started with some Damsharas and ordered some Veg Corn Cheese Pasta, it was good, tasty with the right amount of spice.  The staff isn‚Äôt well trained and being a new place there are chances to face some disappointment purely due to the staff or service, unlike other place, the staff here is desperately seeking to know when you‚Äôll leave.

One of the coolest place I've visited.

The ambiance, decor and the interiors are very chunky.  The service was fast and the choice of music being played was good too. The only problem was with the risotto. It was very bland and needs to looked after. Other than that all the dishes we had were quite yummy. 

Liked the way they've done their false ceiling with- egg shells. 

A must visit definitely!

Much like the awaited genre of pubs in Calcutta, WIDN is sure impressive if one likes those western cultured places.  

Yet to try the food here. But the ambience, music and hookah wins a thumbs up!

Definitely worth more than a visit.

Heard a lot about this place so I decided to pay a visit. 
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE. From music to food to that dude on the other side of the bar, A1 I'd say. I do not quite agree with the other reviews stating the "faults" of this place. However, I personally LOVED IT. 
I would recommend you to drop in and I'm sure you'll love it too.

It is really surprising to see so many people reviewing good about this place. 
1st they got a small name board, the lightning of which makes it almost impossible to recognise .
2nd they would book your table.
3rd they will make you wait outside unless your "female friends" arrive.
4rth the place is filled with school kids that too on a weekend, they should really check some id's.
5th for 3 couple and a stag, they literally asked us to pay 20000rs before even sitting on the table.
-I am not sure if this place will last long-

What's In D Name is an amazing place! 
-We went on a Sunday night and the music was really good.
-Food as well as the desert was nice. Try Veg Mili juli Sarkar-It's a Veg platter and the quantity is sufficient to serve two people. 
-Abhishek and Suvendu served us and they were really cooperative. 
-Superb ambience! 
Overall it was a nice experience.
A must visit place in Kolkata!

The Ambience of the place was good. I really liked the idea of three different sitting areas. My favorite was the terrace with glass covering. We sat on the first level, as we had to try the hookah. The hookah was really smooth and good. We had lotus stem crisps which was really good.  The thai curry we ordered tasted good but the presentation was really awful,  it felt as if we were eating in a jail. The staff was responsive and service was good. It was a nice experience but they could really work on their presentation.

Such a pathetic way of service, called these guys in the afternoon to book a seat for two, and when reached there they are like boys not allowed.  Lol 
Not from kolkata, atleast at the time of booking only they can preinforn that on weekends they have this kind of rule. 
So totally sucks in the service. 
The ambience is good no doubt but whats the use.

If the darwan thinks he is some big shot then one should avoid such a place as Kolkata has much better place to party and enjoy your evening. There can be better ways of dealing crowd than acting pricey and rude.

The vibe isn't the best. The place mostly has young school kids around on weekends. The drinks are priced like Stock Exchange which is okay.
They do not change the coal for hookah. You'll have to reorder in case you want the same flavour.

This place is energy packed.. New hip place in town. Ambience : although I'm personally bored of filament bulbs and rustic look now, I really like the booth and this entire wall filled with old stereos and recorders.. Super cool if you ask me. 
Service has been excellent. 
Food is good but I could figured from the taste of the burger it was made by a chef who probably worked at Mezzuna.
So try to order different items, the mushroom pasta in wine sauce was simply delish! I also tried rumali cigar rolls which were innovative and yummy. Must indulge in othello.

Since there was so much hype built around the place, a couple of us friends decided to check this place out. We went on a Thursday, yet we were being restricted at the entry, until our friend who had reached earlier, had to tell them that we were with him.

Food was surprisingly very good. I say surprisingly, because places like these concentrate too much on the drinks and ignore the food. I really liked the Chilli Chicken and the Basil Pesto Pasta. The Kebab Platter (or whatever it's name was) was so so.

The highlight of this place definitely was The Long Island Iced Tea. It was extremely smooth but with a strong hit at the end. Shisha was decent too.

However, the prices was a big turn off. Definitely a deciding factor for party goers, considering the plethora of other options which have opened up in the city.Varsha Agarwal Ishank Kedia

This place is actually nothing great than other pubs here in Calcutta. The staff seems untrained and customers are not taken care of properly. Not much options in hard drinks also. Low on presentation. Ordering is a task. Once they enter it in their app, and you change in your mind in a minute, you cannot change your order. So, a place you can skip trying.

I'll try and review it point wise 
1: New Setup. Thoughtful interiors but very uncomfortable sitting. We were squashed in table of practical meant max of 6 people. 

2: Stewart's of vague poor communication skills and does not suit the place. A appetizer was accompanied by a rice and the chef and the Stewart were trying to justify it. Let's forget the Stewart cause he was that naive. 

3. Spurious liquor. We caught our bar tendor serving us a 10 ml drink with water added in a JNB rear which too he refused he had done this and ever since we had make sure we walk up to the bar and get our own drinks and check every drink being served. 

4. Quality of food is below average. We had ordered an appx 18 dishes with a mix of veg and non veg and 4 may be stood out both. 

5 : They use a tab to function which the Stewart's are not trained yet either. However it's a demeaned version of the original BSE in mumbai. The Stewart was punching our order upto even 20 mins post taking the order which meant the idea of trying to get a reduced price drink failed miserably. 

7.  Unable to handle the expected evening walk in crowd because 

A very very cold experience and having to have paid nearly 35000 Rs for say 9 adults is not cheap either.

" What's in the Name " is one of best pubs in Kolkata. It's interior and loud music takes you to a world of pleasure. The DJ is way way better than alot of places I have visited. It has a dance area which is quite big. The waiters are well spoken and the food is very tasty. This place also uses the concept of Supply and Demand and if you are lucky, you will get good liquors for very cheap rates. :) 
A MUST GO Place.

Visited this place on a Friday around 8 pm. It is located right before Magma house. The board looked attractive. We entered the place and it's not very big. Few tables. But I loved the wall with the boomboxes. The place was well done but not very different from any other new place. For food we ordered the Ponzu Sauce and Rice and some Cottage Cheese dish. They were both good. We had draught beer which wasn't too expensive. Over all it was a good experience.

Just one suggestion, the music is way too loud. The place is not a night club it's a pub, the music was so loud that we left in 1 hour which was a big draw back. If you can't go to such a place and chill with your friends talk to them then there's really no point going there at all. 

I guess second chances are not for all places. I decided to give this place a second chance on Tuesday around 6 pm. The music was fine but the food was pathetic. 
We ordered veg cigars which were undercooked. Mushroom Risotto which was bland. The nachos tasted fine but it had literally 10 PCs of nacho chips. We ended with Crispy Lotus Stem which wasnt great but better than the other things. The only good part about this place is that it's not expensive. 

The service was fine today but the waiters need to be trained properly. Not sure if I want to keep going back.

Been there today to check out the place. Just above the Titan Eye Plus showroom in Park Street~Camac Street Crossing. The food portions are pathetically small. Given for the price not at all worth it. Service is also really slow so it makes you feel bored after certain point of time. Hookah is the price plus 35% VAT.. so check before you order. Also when it comes to drinks the software seems to be bugged as whatever I ordered was out of stock.. so why was it even there in the list..? BSE has a better pricing software.. definitely first and last visit to the place.

So, they have three sections. The pub downstairs with loud music. The luncheon up stairs which is romantic with glass ceiling and walls. And a few seaters in the balcony for hookah and some casual friendly date. We opted for the balcony cz it was quieter and we wanted to have a hookah. The drinks are good. I ordered the white sangria...which was a bit sweet. And the others ordered beer. No happy hours. Food is okay. Sangria was 250 bucks. Heineken is 135 bucks. Hoegaarden is 350 bucks. I liked the ambiance of the balcony outside. Quiet and peaceful. And the staff is really nice. Since they had opened just a day back, I felt that they are doing g pretty good.
