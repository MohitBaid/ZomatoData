Had ordered tandoori chicken which was very juicy and had an awesome taste. I found a new taste in the mustard fish tikka which was a good fusion. Papri chicken was good too with a mix of indian and chinese dish with papad bowl filled with chicken cubes and topped with sesame. Mutton rarha with butter naan was again a tasty main course to end with. All in all i would definitely suggest you to order food from this outlet to satisfy your taste buds.
