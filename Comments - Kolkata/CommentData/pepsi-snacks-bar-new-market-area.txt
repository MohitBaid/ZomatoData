This place is a heritage for me because since last 10 years whenever I am in New Market, I have always preferred this place. Yes we've always known Street food isn't exactly hygienic but then who can resist a plate of Magical soft, fluffy bhatura with spicy chole? Trust me it's absolutely fine to try their food once in a while if you are in a mood to save money on food and spend on clothes while shopping in new market. One can also opt for the fresh delicious fruit juice. My personal favourite is Mausambi juice. :)

নিউ মার্কেট এ বুকে একটা স্ট্রিট ফুড এর দোকান বলা চলে . বাইরে বসে খাবার এর ব্যবস্থা . খাবার এর দাম খুবই সামান্য . এখানে ছোলা বাতুরা টা অসাধারণ . তার সাথে ল্যাসি . মোটের ওপর খারাপ নয় .

সামনে দিয়ে হামেসাই যাতায়াত করতে হয় সেই সুবাদে বেশ কয়েকবার ভোজন সেরেছি । তাড়াহুড়ো তে খেতে হলে আসা যেতে পারে , বসার জায়গা বাইরে তাই অনেকের পছন্দ নাও হতে পারে । তবে খাবারের স্বাদ ভালই ।  সব থেকে বেশি যেটা মনে ধরেছে সেটা এদের ছোলা ভাটুরা ।

A streetside joint for snacks & shakes located at New Market area.

Zero ambience with outer sitting arrangenents. 

Service is quick.

Their Dahi Vara & chole Bature is pretty tasty. They also serve fresh juice.

Price is cheap.

A well known and old street food shop in new market area. Serves mainly south indian foods like, dhosa, utta pam, dahi vada and you will also get fresh fruit juice. Only vegetarian foods are available. Outdoor seating arrangements are available, though the place is not clean neither hygienic. This is the only minus point they have. Foods are tasty, service is fast and very much pocket friendly.

This street side eatery is located at New Market area.

No points for ambience, outdoor sitting.

Service is prompt.

Their Chole Bhature is very tasty, made in Calcutta style. A must try. Lassi is average though.

Pocket pinch is favourable.

I have had been to New Market area even before I started walking. Well yea, my mom's favourite shopping destination is this jam packed area. As I grew up, I disliked visiting those saree shops but nevertheless I had to join as there was none to take care of me back home. On those visits, I developed a liking for street foods and wanted to try, but, like all over-concerned parents I was never allowed.
Few years forward, and, I just happened to complete my schooling. After my exams, I visited here as I was supposed to watch a movie. After the movie, I felt like roaming the jam-packed area of New Market I once hated and all the childhood memories got refreshed. The first thing that came to my mind was - Street Food!
Slowly and steadily walking towards the stall, I stood still thinking what to say. Amazingly, I didn't have to wait much and they asked me to sit on rakes used to store soft drinks bottle (and, that's how they got their name, I guess). I quickly ordered for Chole Batura and it got served almost instantly.
The stall is situated on the footpath just opposite to Hogg Market entrance gate. It is opposite to the place where cars are parked and the vendors sells all types of stuffs, keeping the stuffs on the parked cars.
The food I was served was exceptionally good. Was it the sole taste of the food or the fact that I tried street food for the first time added to the effect is debatable. But, I still remember licking my fingers after having Chole Batura over there. The staff were cool and they kept on asking if I wanted something and I kept on nodding in denial.
I visited it almost six years back and it's indeed strange that I never visited it again to form a mature opinion. 
And yes, it's not a bar, as the name might suggest.

Qs) Should you visit it?
Ans) If you aren't allergic to street food, then definitely you should be there.

Qs) Why have I rated them 4 stars?
Ans) Solely on the taste of the food. But, as it is located on footpath, cleanliness always remains an issue. Thus, I have deducted half a star.

Pepsi Snacks Bar is not a veey well known name if tou name this place but if you give description I am sure nobody in the city will hardly not know them. 

Famous for their Chola bhatura this place is a loved by masses. If you are at Esplanade you must try this place. Along with that we have south indian food options as well which are equally tasty as well. Fresh fruit juices are also available for refreshment as well.

I had been visiting this shop since my childhood...atleast 25 years back...serving a pocket friendly and very tasty chole Bha ture. ..presently selling some other snacks as Dosas idly...juice etc..Workers are very friendly and courteous. ..I went there during the puja time with my family...I think that they are one of the  highest chole Bha ture selling road side food stall in kolkata..

If you talk about street food, this place is hard to be kept behind. Located at Esplanade, behind City Mart, this place is frequented by many people coming from far off places mainly due to the popular Chola Bature. The Bature are large in size, and along with the tasty and flavorful Chole, it becomes a holy and divine combination. The Chole gets replenished upon request or anytime the stock on your plate goes consumed. This place serves a variety of other snacks and food as well, but it would be a mistake not to try Chole Bature if you are around.

The food available here isn't that bad. I was happy to get such quality of food at this price. The chole bhatore tasted pretty good, the chole was well cooked and had the perfect amount of spices. I even had the Dahi Vada, it was also pretty good. Keep up the good work, hope to visit again soon.

I am a Banglorean who visits Kolkata regularly mainly for its street food. Long back when I was first asked by my well meaning Samaritanian bengali husband to eat here I absolutely refused as I was quite an imbecile who was clueless about Kolkata as well as about tasty food. Over a few years I finally grew into a dependable vegetarian foodie and luck by chance I got to eat the chole bature with onion and the heavenly green cilli chutney here and in short I almost killed myself for not eating there and kicked my kind husband for insisting I eat there before. I have been there many times hence and oftentimes the price of the ticket to Kolkata seems absolutely ridiculously inexpensive considering the delicacies I will get on the streets there!!!

Have been eating here for the last 20 years atleast. And most of the time its only Chhola Batura. Love this preparation here. Not the Punjabi style kulche or bhature. I love this Calcutta version more. Fat, soft and delicious. The chhola and the chutney served along with it taste great too. 

Service here is prompt and very attentive. If you need more chhole, most of the times they will fill your plate even before you ask. It is a roadside stall with couple of benches inside and few cold drink crates outside used as stools. So, if ambiance or hygiene is your concern, this place is not for you. For others, if you are around and want a filling, tasty but cheap meal of chana batura, visit this place.

Poor in ambience and dirty in hygiene. This is a pure indian street snack bar. Situated exactly near the hustle and bustle of new market area. You can go here if you are low on bucks. Food quality is quite good so its worth a try atleast once.

Well as me and my cousin were low in cash ,  we decided to give this place a try. Ordered Idly and Lassi which tasted ok but the ambience is pathetic and the hygiene wise it's totally dirty.
Overall a below average experience.

There is a paucity of sitting area. All you get are tools on the footpath. I have tasted their chhole bhatore. The taste was average. There are few people to cater and serve you. There are too much of shouting among the workers.
