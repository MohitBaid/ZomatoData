Worst restaurant . yesterday i ordered one paratha,one mutton kosha,half chicken noodles and half chilly chicken dry.
The food was so dirty.

This place is located in Camac Street, about two blocks from Pantaloons. It is a very good option for a quick lunch or snacks within a reasonable budget.
It mostly serves nonveg where its main dishes are chicken Bharat, chicken tikka masala and chicken biryani; really well cooked and good quantity without spending much.
Space inside the restaurant isn't big as it can barely accommodate 15-20 people, but when one isn't looking for ambiance but just to beat the hunger, this restaurant acts as a fantastic option.
