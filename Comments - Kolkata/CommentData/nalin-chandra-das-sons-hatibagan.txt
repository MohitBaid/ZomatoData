Located just next to Nakur, this place too is very old. Their sweets are comparatively cheaper and tastewise alright. Came here once and tried the Green Mango Mishti along with an Abar Khabo. The Green Mango Mishti was quite good. But the Abar Khabo was a bit sweet. Didn't like it much.

Sweets lovers can't resist themselves to eat their favourite sweets, i'm among of them. "Nalin Chandra Das & Sons" this sweet shop located in Hati Bagan, it's a very old sweet shop over 175 years, they have varieties of Sandesh starting from "Ice Cream sandesh", "Rose cream","Chocolate sandesh" "Orange cream" "Butterscotch Sandesh", "Chocochips Sandesh" and many more. I tried their "Butterscotch Sandesh" and "Chocochips Sandesh". Chocochips Sandesh catch my attention for it's dark chocolate color and this sandesh along with chocochips was really good in taste and the "butterscotch" sandesh was equally good.

One of the leading stalwarts amongst the mishti shops in North Kolkata. This shop has been sweetening the lives of a few generations of mishti lovers. They have some really awesome sandesh. I love them. In the last couple of years they have also joined hands with Cadbury and started experimenting and machine delicious chocolate mishti. All their stuff is really good. Moreover they are very reasonable in price. The ambience is not any great shakes but one simply gets stuff packed from here and savoured at home.

Over 175 years Nalin chandra das and sons of Natunbazar manufacturing delicious sweets to enrich all kolkata bengalis. From North to South anywhere of kolkata we will not get sweet like Nalin chandra das shop. The remembering of Nalini brings a certain nostalgic feelings and flavour of old kolkata with it. They boasts of many royal and eminent bengali customers. Especially their fusion sweets and various fruit flavoured sweets are preferred by many. The famous sweets are keshar jol bhora, black current,¬†¬†black forest, choco malai roll, kolpotoru, alfonso mango. Their sweets never be compared to any other shop as they famous in manufacturing different kind chocolate sweets. Small shop, nothing much decorated and it‚Äôs not needed also.

Nolen Gurer Makha Sandesh from this age old shop is a delicacy to any true Bengali living in Kolkata. The 175 years old sweet shop has now become a household name in Kolkata those who are really passionate about trying out branded sweets with touch of a class. I was passing by their Hedua branch shop couple of days' back on a chilly evening. And the attraction was so very intense that I had to sneak in to the shop to buy 500 gms Sandesh made by farm fresh nolen gur. The best part is, it melts in your mouth as soon as you take a spoonful in your mouth. Do not think twice. Go and grab it.

They have started selling a perfect round shaped chocolate sweet where the inside is a sandesh and the outer hard layer is coated with chocolatey goodness, priced at 15 a piece, this one's a stealer üòÄüòÄ

So far the pioneers of Bong sweets are taken into consideration, a name that deserve a special mention is "Nalin Chandra Das & Sons". Right now they are a chain, having outlets all over the city, but the Hatibagan branch happens to be their flagship shop.
Delicious Bong sweets, and fantastic chocolate Misti is something which makes them a place of attraction to sweet lovers and dessert aficionados. 
Be it to end up your meal with some sweet anecdotes or to fulfill your sweet cravings, this is a place that will surely leave you delighted with a smile on your face.
A very good place to savour your sweet tooth.

A branch of the famous Nalin Chandra Das of Natunbazar, they are famous for their Chocolate Sandesh. Stone's throw away from Nakur, the sweet shop is much better than the famous neighbour as far as quality sandesh is concerned. Among the chocolate sandeshes, I personally like the chocolate singara most. Their malai roll and chandrapuli are excellent too.

Ramdulal Sarkar Street is a heaven for sweet lovers, and rightly so, because of the presence of names like Nalin Chandra Das and Nakur. Finding these shops isn't a difficult task, as they are located one after the other. Mostly a roadside outlet, and a pioneer of Rasagulla, I have been here a couple of times and mostly put my hand on their Chocolate Sandesh or their Butter Scotch Sandesh. Truly a value of money, due to high popularity though, availability may be a factor here.

"Sheer happiness" that is how I can describe my experience whenever I have their desserts. One bite and I am the happiest person alive. Though have been eating their dessert items from my childhood but after trying their chocolate roll sandesh today ( I may not give the correct name)  I thought of writing a review for them which they absolutely deserve. There were so many chocolate sandesh varieties and all brilliantly attractive in their own way that it was very difficult to choose from. The quality of their food items are top notch and they can never fail to impress. May they have many more outlets one especially near my house.

Located near hedua this age old outlet has always lived under the shadow of its neighbour and the big daddy of bengali sweets Girish Chandra Dey and Nakur Chandra Nandy. It however serves some equally good bengali sweets. If one is too bogged down by the queues or lack of availability at the other shop you can safely pick up stuff from here too. Having said that you can also pick stuff from here as your first choice and I bet you wont be disappointed. During my visit here I had picked up the butterscotch and chocolate sandesh and both were extremely good. Have also tried their nolen gur items and they get a big thumbs up too. Definitely recommended.

Their chocolate monohara is a treat for the taste buds, and the butterscotch malai roll Sandesh is richly scrumptious.. Although marginally costly, the sweets are a bang for your buck..¬†
Though it is difficult to pick a favourite from Nalin's wide array Sandesh, one can of course wax eloquent about its most popular products..¬†
The chocochip delightful play of textures where the smoothness of the cottage cheese blends in perfectly with rich granules of dark chocolate..

Well this one listed in zomato is an outlet and the main shop is in notun bazar. Along with makhanlal these guys are the pioneers of sandesh in Calcutta. 

Many people may not know that if you call them and place an order they deliver it to you even in salt lake and south Calcutta. 03325558407... The other number I am forgetting at the moment. I regularly get sweets from there.. Only thing is that you have to buy atleast half kilo and pay around 60/70 for delivery. 
Must have s.... Rose cream sandesh, chocolate sandesh, notun gurer butter scotch, aam sandesh, dilkhosh and makha sandesh.

And for "jolbhara talsas" chocolate sweet , you can't simply stop eating. The butterscotch, mango and pineapple are top quality too... A visit to get a true taste of "bangali sandesh"..

Few days back I went to Nalin Chandra Das & Sons to try their summer special mango sweets. I had tried their regular sweets but the seasonal sweets attracts me most. This was another example of those times when I order too much of the same thing since I love it so much. In this case, it was mango sweets. Frist I tried ‚ÄòMango Sarpuriya‚Äô, this was seriously good and very imaginative creation. Then I jump on ‚ÄòMango Roll‚Äô, wow another surprise it was so delicious, soft mango flavoured sandesh inside that roll intoxicate your taste buds. Lastly I tried their ‚ÄòAlphonso Mango Sandesh‚Äô, which went so well with the rich alphonso mango flavour. I would highly recommend their summer special sweets.

They have some of finest varieties of sweets which can be found around the hatibagan area, which is highly populated with such sweet shops. But it stands out as one of the better shops than others and is having more varieties and more hygienic and tasty than other shops you will find around. I tried some of their sweets and really liked one which was decorated with chocolate but I don't remember its name. :-P

When it comes to NOLEN GURER MISHTI, the world stops and stares !!
Malai roll, gur bati, nalen gur rabri, gur manorama : the four highlights of this place (for me). A must try for every mishti loving bangali (and non-bengalis too)  :)

Well, I have always been an ardent nokur fan and I was introduced to Nalin Chandra Das by a friend who simply told me , You like Nolen gur, They just are way better than nakur with it . This shop , being in the same lane as nakur , i felt gets a little overshadowed by the publicity Nakur gets. 

to begin with , The Gur Malai rool was one of the most beautiful things i have ever put in my mouth . Not only was it beautful but simply so light that one could ask for more . I also loved the gur rabri and the gur rasamalai . 

What i love about them that even in their regular stuff, they focus on the taste and the appearance of the sandesh  is rather simple . Do try getting some custom made wedding platters if you have a function in the family, they do make a very pretty one.

R was intent on eating sandesh, so decided to make him taste some from Nalin Chandra Das, which is just a bit before Nakur in Hedua area. We sampled a few things, and ended up buying way more than we should have bought. The picture you see is that of a Nalen Gur Malai Roll, stuffed with a chhana stuffing studded with butterscotch. It made R's eyes roll up in pleasure and my expression was, apparently, of such bliss that R could not describe it without blushing fifty shades of fiery red.

I loveeeee Nalin for its awesome and delicious sweets. I am not into sweets that much but sweets made by Nalin are simply irresistible. My favourite is 'Chocolate Sandesh'. It is so delicious that in a day you can have almost 4-5. Though its situated in north Kolkata which is quite far from my place the taste attracts me there quite often. Whenever there some occasion in our family we know the sweet dish will be from Nalin Chandra Das undoubtedly. 
This shop is one of the oldest and has been there from generations. The taste is passed generations without any distortions. 
It deserves 4 and above for its quality and taste of its sweets.

My third best sweet shop in Calcutta. Have been tasting their sweets for years....During any puja i order sweets from there,,,i all the time ask them to home deliver sweets and i have never visited the shop. My most favourite is the Chocolate Sandesh,Jolbhora and Pantuas. Pricing is not that expensive cause per piece of chocolate sandesh is 20 or 30 rupees but it deserves,,,Only once they delivered tasteless mishti. The 'Abar Khabo' mishti is a must try....Please try its sweets you r surely going to love it. I will rate 4.5 for Nalin Chandra Das and Sons.
:D
