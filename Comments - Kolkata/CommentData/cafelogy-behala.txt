This cafe is located near Sarsuna Housing. Went there with my sister and we had white sauce chicken pasta and cold coffee. Price is too reasonable. Food was okayish. As there is no other cafe nearby so being the only option there,its a good place for the youngsters.

Wonderful thought of a restaurant. They convert a garage into a full restaurant with kitchen. Concept of the waiting area sofa is good. Good for small group, family or alone. Food nice, need small improvement in the taste side. Reduction of service time is required. Otherwise wonderful.

Awesome quality of food... Fresh and very healthy... Pricing is quite low... This quality of food in this range of prices is hard to find... 
Though the menu is a bit limited... Needs more variety...
Service is nice... Homely atmosphere...

Cafelogy is a relatively new , small food joint located near sarsuna college . We ordered food online from there just for the sake of experimenting and with no big expectation. Veg chilli garlic noodles , veg fried rice , hot garlic chicken and chilly mushroom was all that we ordered . I wouldn't say we were disappointed. Mushroom were well cooked so was the chowmin, however . the chicken pieces were to small . The price is very much affordable and food tastes good , if not excellent . I would recommend it to students and others as it won't burn a hole in your pocket . If you are looking for really cheap food with moderately good taste , cafelogy is the place

Food in this place comes along with great taste.
Coming to the part of price "it's unbelievable" . The price of the food here is really cheap and its really tastyüòçüòç. Coming to the ambience part- this restaurant is really a small place and has a 20 people pax approximately but the place is well set up and has curtious friendly people for service which makes this little place more comfortable. It also has home delivery options.

A small cafeteria with warm people around though they don't provide A.C.. So it's a bit uncomfortable to stay there for long. Average foods but the owner of this place makes a kind of fantastic dark chocolate balls which is a must try.

Awesome food. And very nice place. When you go there you should also try for the rum chocolate which they make. It's very delicious and have rum inside a small chocolate ball. Price of food is very reasonable. And the place is cozy and beautiful. I glgp to the place very often with my friends and it's a nice place to be.
