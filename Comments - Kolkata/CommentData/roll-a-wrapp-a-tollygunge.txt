Took a swiggy delivery for dragon chicken from this outlet. 

Decent amount of chicken tossed in assorted sauces and veggies. The crisp chicken along with the hoy sauce is a perfect evening snack! 

Dragon chicken is really yummy out there. Loved it.

If there was an option of no points at all, I would have provided zero, this place sucks, I ordered paneer wrap and corn cheese wrap, what I got was lettuce and carrot wrap which had 2-3 pieces of paneer, and in the corn cheese wrap they put cucumbers, just to ruin the taste, this place may look attractive, but don't judge a book by its cover
Place is shit.
Should be shut down soon
Horrible experience

Conveniently positioned, this little joint can satisfy your Continental snack craving quite effectively. Do try the grilled sandwich and salad.

This place is situated bang opposite to Malancha Cinema Hall. Had opted for home delivery via Swiggy.
Took non-veg combo that included veg noodles, chilly chicken (2 pieces most probably) and 2 pieces of drumsticks. Along with this non-veg combo, i also took honey glazed chicken which was nicely prepared but was too sweet for my tastebuds, he sweetness of the honey kinda overpowered the slight hint of chilli. 
Nevertheless, it's surely one of the pocket friendly places in the city.

The chessy garlic bread is awful and the crispy chicken is flat and unseasoned looks like chicken nuggets. Not good. Not much cheese on the cheesy garlic bread.

Orderd for their scrambled egg wrap with extra mayo and cheese from swiggy . I guess they forgot to add the extra cheese and mayo still tasted fine . Okayish . Would love to try their cheese wrap someday for sure . 
 Their packing was really good . reminded me of gangtok ‚ù§Ô∏è

Mind blowing experience!! Firstly I Ordered the same items twice !!! Ordered via swiggy.. 
Items ordered : Veg schezwan fried rice alongwith Honey Garlic chicken gravy and egg scrambled wrap.
Now talking about the quality.. Rice was well cooked with good flavours and more specifically being a spicy food lover I loved the taste.. Chicken was really tender but pieces could b a bit larger in size.. coming to the egg wrap it was average.!! 
P.S . First tym experience with the side dish was better than the second one.I will try other dishes too. üòäüòä

Roll a wrapp a is a takeaway joint setup near azadgarh. They have swiggy services, so i have availed that only.

I have tasted the following items:-

1. Non veg combo - This consists of half plate veg friedrice, 2pc chilli chicken & 2 drums of heaven. The friedrice was decent, chilli chickens were fresh which had no batter providing nice taste. The drums of heaven were also tasty,it had good chicken portion.

2. Chicken clear soup - The soup had good quantity & was equally tasty. The soup had generous chicken bits & chopped vegetables(capsicum,bell peppers,onions). The soup was very refreshing!!

3. Dragon chicken - A spicy starter consisting of 8pcs & chopped vegetables. The dish is really hot so mind you regarding that. The chicken was of good quality. A spicy lover would cherish this dish.

4. Chicken friedrice - The friedrice was average. It had minimal chicken & mostly consisted of eggs. Its an okay dish.

The prices are on lower side. Some dishes will make your tastebuds tickle while some will disappoint you.

I had ordered food from this joint via Swiggy. I had ordered Chicken Penne Pasta in White Sauce. I was a bit disappointed with the quality of the food. The taste wasn't upto the mark and there was far too less chicken in the dish.

Location wise, it is in the best possible place for having some quality lebanese and as the name suggests chinese food!!! Opposite to Malancha cinema hall, is a mini subway on its own as far as their menu is concerned !
As the name suggests, various kinds of rolls and wraps are sold ; Leaving these ,they even sell various kinds of sandwiches, burgers and some main course starters too!!!
I on my part had their veg patty burger! Since the beginning of time, the food joints have always looked down upon the veg platters!!! But this belief was till I took the first bite of the burger! Both quantity and quality wise, the burger was just more than enough !!! Moreover , the products are not overpriced at all. The service of the manager was good towards its customers !
A bit of concern should be there wait time which needs to be minimised as time goes by ; Anyways keep up the good work !!!

A new fast food joint in Tollygunge area. As the name says it, this place serves wraps. You'll get a wide variety of wraps, including veg, chicken, fish and ham. The list doesn't end there, the place also serves a varitey of sandwiches, burgers and salads. They also have a mini Indian menu which only has some Kebabs. Salads, Pasta and Soups are also included in the menu. There is also a lot to talk about the starters. Overall, one can get a lot of options to choose from.
I personally tried their Crispy Chicken Burger and Crispy Chilli Babycorn, and I must say for the pricing, I wasn't disappointed. The patty of the burger was "crispy" as the name said, that was one of the most important things that went the good way. The Crispy Chilli Babycorn was also very well made, the crispiness was what I was expecting, and I got it.

The service was pretty decent, and the rates go from 50 rupees, all the way up to 180 rupees. Good quality food at pretty affordable rates, the service is also decent. That was good enough to impress me. Thumbs up from my side.

Outstanding food..Fresh meat & well cooked with fresh veggies in the order..With right amount of sauces in it..
Dint feel it's a local joint in the streets of kolkata tastes as close to subways..

Ordered for
Crunchy Fried Chicken Sandwich & Grilled chicken burger..

Would suggest you guys to add some potato wedges or french fries or some salted potato waffers would add to the taste for sure..
Cheers keep up d great work..
