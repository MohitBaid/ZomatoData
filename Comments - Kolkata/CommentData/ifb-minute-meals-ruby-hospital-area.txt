It’s a smooth feeling! ‘melt in one’s mouth’ . You don't need to take a break to watching TV! Better option for your better half for Sunday will be a fun day....Great!!

This is just perfect for all. You have to just microwave it for a minute and you get the most authentic Thai food ready to eat. Everyone should try this

Food gets ready in a jiffy, just microwave and eat. packaging is so neat and handy that you just need a fork to get going with your meal.i tried the Thai curry and fried rice with chestnut.
Oh how can i forget that all the meals are vegetarian too.
