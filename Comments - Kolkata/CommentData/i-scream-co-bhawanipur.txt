One of the worst outlet in the city. They are Fake people and the biggest Cheaters of Town at present.
Quality .. Worst.
Service.....Hopeless.
Staff... Rude and unprofessional.
More over they increased Rates of items by just putting a paper and they don't give Invoice or Bill or any Cash Memo.
Zomato should immediately remove them from their app.

A bad experience at iscreamco at Justice Chandra Madhav Road Bhowanipur opp laxmi Narayan hospital. Today after dinner my family went for Ice cream at iscreamco and ordered cookies and cream which was worthless and we threw it in the dustbin. We were not given bill and when we insisted we were given a cash memo without proper company name or gst no which looks like a kuttcha bill. When insisted for proper gst invoice was told that the shop is issuing this way only. The entire menu board has newly paper price pasted on the original price... The staff behaved very badly when asked why they were doing  this way. People are being taken for a ride with without proper invoice. Whoever reading this post wishes to go there should ask for proper invoice. #iscreamco.

This place was on my bucket list for a long time and I had heard many good things about it. We ordered the chocolate brownie ice cream. It tasted very nice and was surprisingly very creamy, maybe because of the nitrogen used. The ambience was nice and their serving portions were also sufficient. A must place to visit if u love ice cream.

You‚Äôre never too old for ice-cream, and I firmly believe it brings out the child in all of us. When we were young the ultimate reward was when we were taken to ‚ÄúIce-Cream Parlors‚Äù, I am a 70‚Äôs child and I loved it in those days it was quite a novelty. I had my first ice-cream cone as a toddler at ‚ÄúGay‚Äù on Strand Road and I still have the photo captured by my loving parents as a very fond memory.

A nice place for desserts. The best options are only the one with chocolate base or the pan flavor, rest are so so, although some of my friends like kiwi flavor. Pricing is reasonable as well.

A wonderful experience at I Scream Co. with impeccable nitrogen ice cream sundaes. 

Although not a fan of doi, we tried out Bong Mania and it's something worth the money for. 
The Malai ice cream and Yuzu Sorbet are equally great. 
Definitely recommended for any ice cream hunger pang. 


For two: 350INR

PS- Try their Bubblegum Lemonade for childhood memories.

The newest ice cream parlour that all dessert loving foodies must try! üçß I was super delighted with the velvety red raspberry ice cream and it's the best if your taste buds are craving for some creamy, frozen dessert! Two of my favourite things combined into one - I mean why didn't anyone think of that before!!We couldn't have enough of it. üòä
There are a lot of unique flavours and you'll be certainly spoilt for choices. 
In terms of ice creams, you've got many options in this area - there's Pabrais, Icy Fusion, Ice Ninja and now this. I Scream Co. jas the potential to make a mark inspite of such good competition!
Treat yourself to a yummy serving of red velvet ice cream and you're surely going to ask for more! I personally love ice creams and I'm always on the look out for latest additions to the city.üç¶This one quite impressed me. Yet to try the other varieties...hoping they are equally unique and good! üòä

Location- It's walking distance from Dugout , Its a small outlet and they have a huge variety of options to select from , this is what calcuttacravings has to say -

We ordered- 
‚Ä¢Cookie and Cream (classic) - It had a weird taste . I dont have words to describe it . Not recommended.

‚Ä¢Dragon Shots- these are chilled caramel and strawberry popcorn , the only innovation that they added here was that the popcorns were chilled and smoke comes out everytime you take it in your mouth . 

‚Ä¢Jello-n- i scream - it had strawberry jelly, a rainbow cake and icecream with various chocolate toppings in it. Tasted good . 

Worth a visit if you would like to try new variations of icecreams. 
Pocket pinch- Rs.480 
Keep eating! All the love ...

After searching a lot we finally managed to find this place located in the lanes of bhawanipur. Me n my friend we heard that this place serves nitrogen ice cream and we badly wanted to try out. With high anxiety we went in.. there were no customers and the service personnel were in a chill mode. As we entered the first thing after grabbing the menu we were trying to find was the nitrogen ice cream on the menu... after going through the two paged menu we cpuldnt find it and lastly we had to ask them by ourself about the availability of nitrogen ice cream. Sadly on our part they replied with a NA. Reason being its injurious to health and if somebody gulps in the nitrogen it could have a very harsh effect on the body. We agreed to it very rightly. But we tried to give a second thought on having something else too but nothing else could attract us on the menu. So we came back with a broken dream of having a nitrogen ice cream for the first time.. Hunt is still on for it but.. !! üòé
Give it a try foodies and visit this place someday if you are somewhere near to this shop. üëç

This is a new ice cream parlour in the city in the bhawanipore area, not far from the forum mall.
Wanted to try it out when I heard about their innovative flavours. The place is quite small with just three chairs which were already occupied when we went. So had to stand the whole time. There are no shelves either where you can keep the dish and have it.
Order- velvety red raspberry
Food- It's basically a bed of red velvet cake covered with liquid nitrogen raspberry flavoured icecream and topped with chocolate sauce and strawberry poptarts.
Coming to the taste, the red velvet cake was quite dry. Loved the ice cream though which had a very prominent raspberry flavour and not too sweet on the palate either. But my favorite were the poptarts which added that extra edge to the dish.
Pocket pinch- 240 which is quite high for a newly opened joint and the quantity did not justify the price either.
Overall-if you want to try out new innovative ice cream flavours then you can surely give it a try!

I was looking for something new to try at I Scream Co . So I and my friend tried Warm Choclaty Nutella Crunch Brownie , the taste is good , with the combination of brownie and nutella at the base and chocolate ice cream up with butterscotch at the top . The combination was good to eat I liked the crunchy butterscotch balls , it's adding taste to this I- Scream . But all these taste are common nowadays, there is a lack of innovation . If you love chocolate then you should go for it but if you searching for something new to your tongue then I will say it's not a right choice . The staffs are very generous and polite , service is good and place is very clean . Folllow me for more review . Stay tuned . Thank you

We ordered a nutella crunch brownie icecream .
The brownie was stale , but the staff wasnt co operative. Instead of serving us a fresh one, they argued that the brownie is fresh .. 
I wouldnt recommend anyone to visit such a disgusting place.
N the icecream tastes like softy here!!
So unless u wanna pay 200 for a softy, dont bother goin to i scream co.

We went for the dragon shots and that is what they had recently stopped making. So I was very very dissapointed.  

The other ice creams were what I have tasted before so nothing really struck me.  I wish they do come up with something more unique and different.  

Will visit soon and hope something new will be up!!  :)

Once upon a time when I was in school I used to eat ice creams every day, not only school days but also in my college days. but, the days which are quite memorable till now it‚Äôs my childhood memories. every time I fall down with fever & cough after having numerous numbers of ice creams, but still, it‚Äôs going on and on and on. this is something which I can‚Äôt live without, being an ice cream lover sometimes I do prepare ice cream in my home just to satisfy myself. well, in the city of joy right now varieties¬†of ice cream parlors¬†here & there. it‚Äôs quite hard to choose between them. a newly opened joint which is going to open for the people from 15th of July, I was invited there with my fellow foodie group over a tasting, we had some of the signature¬†items. well, the name is quite interesting side by side their ice cream too after you enter inside the place you will see Dragons & cupids. the owner told us an interesting story, behind every unique thing¬†there is a secret. basically, dragons bring the ice all the way from the mountains and make the ice cream all by themselves using their own fire.

The city does not lack ice cream parlors in fact there are quite a plenty. But at times they get a little too monotonous. On the bright side though diversity does exist. And adding a whole new breeze to the world of ice cream is I Scream Co. Freezing your dreams with liquid nitrogen is this dessert parlor.
The cartoon clad wall graffiti adds to the peppiness of the parlor.
They have quite a collection on desserts, shakes and mocktails.
Apart from the usual ice cream scoops in paper tubs they offer beautifully crafted desserts. The Jello 'n' I- scream is a beautiful blend of strawberry jello, strawberry, rainbow cake and cotton candy. Super tasty and highly photogenic.
You will probably fall in love with the Bangla Mania freezing the essence of bengal in ice cream with rosogolla, doi mishti and aam shotto cubes.

Something really quirky is the "Dragon breath" which is a flavored pop corns frozen in bubbling nitrogen. With every bite you breathe cold fire!
Absolutely amazing!

Ambience: 4/5.
Staff: 4.5/5

15 days old new ice-cream joint near dugout bhawanipore, extremely fancy and the ice creams out here are really good. Again these ice creams are liquid nitrogen ice-creams. Tried out their Tiramizuzu, it's amazing. Also, surprisingly they are not charging any tax right now and wait for them to surprise you guys with tiny cute badges along with the bill.

Opened up nearby to Dugout and My big fat belly.
Obviously these two places doesn't need any further introduction but coming to I Scream Co it has got its outlet freezing since 15th of july.

Newest Parlour in town with some innovative nitrogen icecreams, milkshakes.
Had ordered for Bangla Mania with a wow flavour of bengali aam sotto,rasgulla . Its delicious no obvious first new Innovation i have seen with aam sotto nd rasgulla on an icecream basis.

Also try out their lemonny Marshmellow flummery its lemonny in taste for all lemon lovers üçã. It has got a very creamy lemony affair along the taste and richness.

I also tried Velvety red raspberry its delicious in looks as well as by taste .
The newest on the joint is the dargonbreath with nitrogen fumes.
They make each of them with utterly love and  liquid Nitrogen. 

They also serve for some buttery popcorn shakes! Never heard of them? ? 
Rush up to the gallery of new innovative icecream parlour in town NOW!

Was invited by the I scream co. team as part of the Calcutta cacophony group.
The whole feeling of being there was like leaving a 5 year old kid in a camdy shop for an entire day.
The use of nitrogen to make the icecream is really innovative and all the fusion icecream that they have created are very new in the block.
No other place in the city has such variety.
We were a happy bunch of people as we left the store.
Looking forward to my next visit and trying all the ones that had been left off in the first visit.

From a non-ice cream eater to a ice cream lover - my journey has been a good ascend. And with places like this, my love is new found and here to stay :D

The newest dessert place, located in the lane beside Dugout. They have parking space, and specialize in liquid nitrogen based ice creams.

In addition to the desserts, they are also serving shakes, mocktails, sorbets, dragon shots. So you need not limit your preference to ice cream only! You'll also be surprised by the variety and offbeat flavours they offer. The prices are reasonable too.

I Scream Co is the latest dessert parlour in the city. It is located on Justice Chandra Madhav Road, and close to Chakraberia, Sarat Bose Road. The place is small yet cute, and is definitely going to fascinate kids due to the animated graffiti on the walls, which demonstrates the usage of liquid nitrogen in freezing ice creams as the chilling breath of a dragon.

This place isn't similar to a normal ice cream parlour because of two reasons. Firstly, they are not just restricted to ice creams. They serve sorbets, mocktails, shakes, dragonshots and a vast array of innovative desserts. And secondly, the usage of liquid nitrogen imparts a smooth texture to the ice cream and prevents it from melting easily.

I was pretty excited to try the Bangla Mania from the dessert section. It had rosogolla, Mishti Doi, amsotto, mango sauce and sweetened mouri. What more can a bong desire? The combination of some many sweet ingredients can make someone assume that this dessert would be extremely sweet. But it wasn't ! The dessert was, infact, less sweet and the usage of mishti doi was heavenly. This is a must try !

Another dessert which I chose to have was the Velvety Red Raspberry. Raspberry sauce, strawberry popcorns and red velvet cake were combined together to create a beautiful flavour. The raspberry sauce was extremely flavourful and the strawberry popcorns provided the much needed crunch.

I also tried the Almond flavour, which is prepared using natural almonds. It tasted divine. The strawberry cheesecake shake was another beauty. The shake was thick and topped with cake pieces.

Overall, this place a hidden gem for all dessert lovers. The innovative dessert section will surely catch everyone's attention for the most amazing and unexpected combination of ingredients, creating a magical flavour.

Verdict : Must Visit.

Price for two : ‚Çπ300-350 approx.

Certainly a New baby on the block with a Loud Scream of Isrceam. Sooo much choice here, it was difficult to make up my minds, eventually decided to go with Chef‚Äôs choice. Officially it is opening up its crazy flavours for customers from tomorrow !. Around 30 ‚Äì 40 different flavours, made on site, should cater for just about everyone‚Äôs tastes. Quality and taste are great, different come options including Desserts, sorbets, natural flavours, shakes, mocktails to choose from !

This newly opened dessert parlor is located in¬†41, Justice Chandra Madhab Road. Bhowanipore , near My big Fat belly. They serve various kinds of shakes, desserts, mocktails, Naturals ice creams and sorbets. Small but nicely decorated with all the dragon pictures. They have some unique items in their menu specially the ‚ÄòDragon shots‚Äô which is a flavored popcorn (chocolate & strawberry) dipped in liquid Nitrogen which makes the smoke. They also have an item called ‚ÄòBangla mania‚Äô consisted Rossogolla, Mishti doi, Whipped cream mango sauce and multicolored saunf. Though it‚Äôs sounded very sweet but trust me it was not that sweet at all. This is a highly recommended. We also tried other items which was ‚Äì ‚ÄòMalai coconut Natural ice cream, Litchi Sorbet, Raspberry spritzer, Velvety Red Raspberry, Millionaires Caramel softbread.
                                                                ...

I Scream Co is the newest Ice-cream parlour/dessert outlet in Kolkata. The place serves shakes, mocktails, sorbets, naturals, and desserts.

They have a cute logo - the dragon. It is extremely cute how the liquid nitrogen foam is being added value to by the dragon's breathe! They have cute little badges as tokens.¬†

One must try their "Dragonshots" which is frozen popcorn (currently available in 2 flavors.) The shots when washed with a spoonful of liquid nitrogen oozes such smoke adding to the appeal!

Apart from that, the Jello-N_I Scream - a strawberry based dessert is also highly recommended. In sorbets, try their green apple sorbet. In smoothies - go for their strawberry smoothies.

The prices are extremely reasonable too. Located in the lane beside Dugout, Sarat Bose Road.
