Have been to this restaurant with a group after receiving an invitation to dine here. We had ordered for Shrimp Cocktail, Mixed Fried rice, Chicken Tetrazzini, Murgh Do- Piyaza and Tandoori Roti. There was nothing special about any of the above-mentioned dishes. We didnâ€™t like anything apart from the live music and the seating arrangements, The restaurant is quite spacious, but the service is pretty slow. The ambience is cool, and the staff are friendly too.

Situated in park street,i am writing this review based on my childhood and adolescent experiences,havent been there in a long time...the fact that I remember this place,after all these years,proves that atleast at some point of time this place served great food...the ambience was old worldly,with decent staff and great continental food..my personal favourite was their banana splitz dessert,which was just out of the world...would definitely like to visit this place again sometime,and hope it proves its low 2.6 rating wrong

On my last visit to Calcutta in October, 2016, I went to this restaurant and was pleasantly surprised. I didn't have much expectations or idea about the offerings here. 
  The place is quite subdued and old world- with cozy sofas and some potted bushes to give you privacy. Quite spacious. Service is alert though occasionally slows down. The alcohol menu is quite exhaustive. 
  My friend, who is familiar with the place, suggested a mixed Sizzler and it was a wise choice. Generally the sizzlers fail to tickle my tastebuds after the initial thrill of the grizzling sounds and smoke. But this one is a rare exception. Quite surprisingly the taste was exemplary. They have a huge variety of continental foods. The price factor is reasonable given the location of Park street. It might do well if it's given a makeover by changing the tired looking interiors which definitely has seen better days. 
  I was quite happy to dine there and I will definitely look forward to visit again.

Well, Christmas Eve, fully loaded Park Street..  

We found this place as our saviour...  Staffs are friendly, helpful... 
We had mixed rice and chilly chicken, schzewan chicken... Along with 2beers!! 

Quantity was decent.. 

Ambience :3.5/5
Food :3.5/5
Service :4/5

If you want a not that much crowded restro, you can give this place a try!!

They definitely served me something other than chicken! Which must be dog meat for 100%. They cheat people serving dog meat in the name of chicken!  I am saying this as I have tasted dog meat in the past!

Went to eat at this restaurant as it came highly recommended by the continental food lovers.
An old restaurant of Park Street situated in a British era building and still exudes the elegance to some extent. The seating was comfortable and the staff were friendly.
At lunch we ordered the cream of chicken soup which turned out to be delightful and then it was the the turn of the mixed sizzler. My expectations were high and the chef didn't disappoint. It was not the best I ever had but it was certainly one of the better sizzlers that I've eaten. The shrimps, fish, chicken and lamb were perfectly cooked and the dish was brought together very well indeed. Overall a lovely lunch.
Of course the Nolengur ( an aromatic jaggery made out of date palm available in Bengal during winters only)Ice cream at their parlour was yum ðŸ˜‹.

The food was good not really exceptional, but the biggest turn off with this restaurant is the service.. extremely arrogant waiters.. We spent almost 3 hours in this restaurant being a group of 7 we were shifted to the first floor corner side, they said the Ac's were on but we didn't feel any Air conditioning around us at all.. we requested the waiters to turn on the fan at least but they rudely ignored our concern with rude comments.. I would never like to recommend to anyone or come back to this place again at all..

Floriana is quite an old name in park street area.Â 

##Locatio: Located on the bylane just opposite to the road of The Park.

##Experience: Best part is their ambiance which is absolutely beautiful. I have been here twice and each time I had average experience here. Tried their Â Indian cuisine both the times.Kebabs , Butter Nan Â and Â chicken gravy dish. Each of the items tasted decent though the Kebabs were a bit hard Â Also tried Polau which was made really well. but its okay. But I feel they where they lag is the service which can be improved in many way.

Quite a pleasant experience here on a Friday night. Adjoining to Waldorf, the restaurant serves north Indian, continental as well as Chinese cuisines but looking at the vast North Indian menu, we decided to go for that. Melt-in- your mouth succulent Banjari kababs, soft and crispy butter rotis, the most amazing biryani in town - Sofyani biryani, which lived up to its description and creamy Hyderabadi chicken completed our meal. The biryani deserves special mention as the taste was unlike any other we had ever tasted, and had generous portions of alu bukhara, two huge pieces of flavourful succulent chicken, alu and one egg! Also, there was live western music at Waldorf which we enjoyed as well!

Pathetic service and really indecent, coarse and bawdy staff. Food is just OK but the staff there are all bunch of idiots. They are just concerned of how much tip they are getting. We had visited there with family and they did nt even bother to arrange the table properly, put the napkins and glasses in place. They just don't want to entertain family crowd rather they are just vested with the people who are having drinks. There was one customer who seemed to be regular there having drinks and some starters and to my disbelief there were always 3-4 waiters serving them just one dish. We Â ordered soup, starters, main course but they seemed to be so much in hurry.

I was very regular at Sams n Floriana way back in 2006-2008 and used to go there with my friends and we were spending almost 10-15,000 every night. The ambiance and staff seemed to be quite efficient that time but now it has lost its touch. It looked to me like a very ordinary place with very indecent and not at all courteous staff. I think using a word like hospitality would be totally out of place when describing floriana.

The management, if there is any, need to be serious about the kind of staff they have. Really shameful.

I have been to this place twice and each time my experience was different.
On my first visit, we were seated at the bar for drinks over dinner, which was quite cosy and I liked the ambience. The food and drinks were good too. We had cocktails and starters. The staff were friendly and swift.
Visit 1 - 3.5/5
On my second visit, I went with my friends for lunch. We were seated at the restaurant area which was good as ambience. What turned me off were the staff, their service and average taste of food. One staff kept standing guard in front of us the whole time we ate and talked and peeped down to see how much we were about to tip him. He even insisted on more.
Visit 2 - 1.5/5
That was when I drew the line and never stepped in there again. I hope everybody doesn't experience the same.

Well what can I say... Another Old Calcutta restaurant bites the dust....
It was a sad sad experience. The roasted lamb in mint sauce... Had no taste at all and the lamb was tough and chewy still edible. The biggest downer was the Roasted Duck in Red Wine sauce... Firstly they mixed up the order and served something with loads of bell peppers in an oily gravy. Then they said that it was Roasted duck in barbeque sauce which tasted nothing like it... Now for the protein... No crispy duck skin, the skin on this duck was soggy and revolting ... And the duck was cooked for such a long time that it was fibrous and horribly tasteless... None of the lovely slightly chewiness of roasted duck... It was in one word inedible... We dared not to order any dessert. And the beefeater with tonic water.... Was the only thing that tasted like it should... Unfortunately I asked for a twist of lime... That is a rind of lime and got slices of lime instead.... Too bad Floriana... You are not worth a second visit.
PS: the waiters are completely clueless and shouts to each other when asked a question... No courtesy whatsoever!!!
VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED

They have live jazz music in the weekends where a bunch f really good musicians play. The price of liqour is reasonable and the ambience is also good. I would definitely want to visit this place again. I can highly recommend this place for good music + good food + affordable liquor.

We often passed by this place....and where curious to explore it... hence this Saturday we decided to visit Sam Pub as it know on the board. 
To our surprise the place was very empty, and a few old men where preparing to play live. We got to the table and the only thought that was running was should we leave....
But then when they started playing some classic Jazz... that was it we stayed back and ordered our drinks.
Can't write any review on the food as we didn't eat anything . It was just some drinks and excellent live music. 
We enjoyed our evening, definitely gonna visit the place for the live music and fun loving and energetic musicians :)

A unit of famous Sutton seeds , Floriana food is always up to the mark and I am fan of their fish cutlets . This time we started with cream of chicken soup , followed by chicken reshmi kebabs . Starters were tasty and with perfect mix of spices.  Then in main course we tried bhetki in gravy and chicken tikka masala . Bhetki curry is a must try.  Also in dessert try any pudding , they are great.

Jokes apart, this place offered a decent enough outlook and ambiance coupled with a quite slow paced service. Back then i did not drink much so can't say anything about the bar section. But yeah, the food were alright. Not a place i would like to repeat. You may give it a try if you are out of options.

Went to this place with a few colleagues after office yesterday., based on a recommendation. Well, it turned out to be a mixed experience. We were in the mood for a few light drinks and ordered cocktails like Blue Lagoon, Planter's Punch and Screw Driver- the classics that can never go wrong. But well, here, it did! Other than the Planter's Punch (even this one was a mellowed down version of the one served at other Park Street restaurants like Peter Cat!), the cocktails turned out to be bogus. The Blue Lagoon, instead of being fresh, was syrupy and tasteless. The Screw Driver was beyond all thoughts, it was that bad.The food however, was average. We had ordered finger foods like TandooriÂ Chicken, Drums of Heaven and Pan Friend Chicken, of of which the Tandoori Chicken was the best. We had also ordered a mocktail- Floriana, which was actually better than the cocktails! After this experience with cocktails, we stuck to ordering only AB and Smirnoff. The place didn't excite me, not going back again surely. There are better places in Park Street to sip a few drinks and spend some time with colleagues.

This place is mostly for the office goers of park street area. The food quantity is quite sumptuous but the quality may not be the best.

one word .... go there at your own risk .  we  went  to sam's  pub  the  bar outlet  of floriana's  and  were  utterly  disappointed .  ballentine's  which costs  rs  190 /  60 ml  peg  else where  costs here rs rs 321/60 ml peg here .  not only  that  budweiser beer which  costs  rs 180 / 650 ml bottle  elsewhere  costs here rs 215 / 650 ml bottle here . food is  also costly .  chilly fish  which costs rs 160 /  plate elsewhere costs  here rs 225 / plate .  ambiance is decent  but nothing special to write home about . there is live music  available  on request .  but that's  just  about  it  .  overall  an  average place with above average  prices . if you  really want  to go there have beer &  nothing else . in  my  opinion  spare  yourself  the ignominy  of  being  robbed . if you are from the locality better  go to starlit garden bar on  park street .

1. I think the restaurant does not have good business, and perhaps the bar is the bread earner for the restaurant
2. I am hesitating to rate it three as the food is not bad. Unfortunately the preparation has been inconsistent, and I have recieved well cooked as well as poorly cooked meals, and I have not understood the pattern and cannot predict when I will be served poorly made food. The restaurant has had its ups and downs, and during its ups, service and food has been good. I guess during promotional events you can look forward to good service.

Decent food.. But pathetic service we got! Without indicating that it's the last order, they just stopped taking any orders and refused to take any more orders!

What happens when you're a well respected seed shop with a declining bottomline, nowhere to hide and prime real estate? Easy, diversify into the restaurant business. That's what Sutton and Sons did. If only they had hired a decent bar man.

Floriana is on Russel Street, closer to the Park Street end than the Middleton street one. More or less across from the excellent Gujarati (and more) restaurant, Gangaur. Walk in and head straight for Parasol, which is the pub, discreetly partitioned from the dining area. The decor is horsy, not the Hussain kind, but murals plastered in the walls. Seating is spartan: 6-7 sofas spaced around the room, with the bar at one end. Not a dating joint, this is more geared to a group of friends meeting over a couple of beers or a couple of weary businessmen settling into a large Oaken Glow.
