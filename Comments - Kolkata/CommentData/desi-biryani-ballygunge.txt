Apart from a great biryani, Desi Biryani is staffed by the most gracious welcoming servers. Consideing the rates, it is one of the best in Kolkata. For an Biryani-addict like me its a bi weekly rendezvous. If you are a fan of Biryani and are near Ballygunj Phari, dont think twice. What it lacks in square footage makes up in preparations.
