well the name suggest the loaction..... located on a oneway street which makes it difficult to reach.We visited the place at 7:30.due to its uncinviniebt location the resturant was completely empty and staffs were returning home.. Ordered one way fish and chips and stuffed chicken breast,But to be honest i really didn't understood the taste nor the ones who visited with me. It was not bad it was not good the tastes were somewhat as if blank...though quality was good.I would not recommend anyone to visit.

One Way Cafe which has opened shortly serves you Indian, Thai and Chinese- all under the same roof. We had Grilled Chicken Sausages pizza and a Cottage Cheese Steak. The pizza was a thin crust pizza and the pizza sauce was too sweet. The Cottage Cheese Steak was a melt in the mouth. The cafe also serves as a banquet hall. The management and service needs to get better.

The visit to the place was completely unplanned but a grumbling stomach (very) lead my partner in crime and me to this very noticeable joint at Chowringee. Well to be honest I did not go with much expectation but again then when you are hungry everything tastes good! But I must really say that the food was actually praise worthy. By food I mean barbecued chicken coriander and grilled chicken sausages sandwich. Both tasted really good and the portion was humongous! They serve eight pieces of bread and that too at such a nominal price! I was tempted to give this place a 4 but to be fair I was not much impressed with the decor. The place was empty when we went and we were seated in the inner room whose walls looked like books. I loved the concept but otherwise the decor was a bit drab. And I have to take this point into account while rating. But overall if you love your sandwich, this is the place to be.

We went on a weekday afternoon for lunch. We selected this place based on the good feedback in Zomato. But it was a disappointment. Many of the items on the menu were not available like Stuffed chicken, chicken ala kief, bhetki preparations. The service is slow and the waiting time was humongously long. We nearly waited for an hour after ordering before being served food. From their service and confused looks when asked about main courses, we gathered they mostly cater to casual coffee and snacks on a regular basis. So they are not really prepared to serve full meals like we ordered. Hence all the waiting time and not so great cooking. 

We ordered Grilled Fish basa- this was tasty, but the fish wasnt grilled it was fried i guess because it tasted like butter fish fry. 

Baked fish basa- too much sweet sauce in it. The fish was good. the remaining items in the dish - chowmien & veggies seemed soaked in sugar syrup

Chicken Stroganoff - It looked like kerala style chicken curry rice. And tasted like it was cooked in ghee. Big  disappointment considering other continental chicken items were not available . 

Corn & cheese sandwich - the only dish that had no complaints. It was wholesome and filling. 
 
The starters were garlic babycorn & chilly potato tikia were so so. Nothing mentionworthy. Price is reasonable 

Decor is decent inside their bookshelf painted room. But the sofas were placed too close to one another. So people sitting on another couch can hear exactly what u discus. Kind of like no privacy in conversation as the couches were literally side by side. 

In my opinion this place is okay for a quick coffee and sandwich bite. But if u plan to have a full meal lunch, do consider going elsewhere.

A descent place near exide more just opposite of rotary sadan near rabindra sadan metro. Ambience was excellent. Internal decor just gives the feeling of sitting in drawing room.We have breakfast here. We ordered barbecue chicken sandwich,  chicken paratha, one lemon tea and one masala tea. All the foods were really testy. Staffs here are also well behaved. And when the bill came it was just rupees 430. Hoping to visit soon.

It was my parent’s 40th anniversary and like all son I too, wanted to make the day special for them! I had to host a private party for a gathering of 75 guests. Given my busy schedule at work & home, I started the process by searching on-line for the best venues available for the best price. Shortlisting, negotiations & personal visits to these Venues not only made the exercise exhausting but never-ending for me. One phone call (although made reluctantly) took me by complete surprise!!! They were receptive, resourceful and prompt to say the least. It was seamless, succinct and successful… I cannot thank you guys enough for making a special day for me even more special with your efforts!
You have earned a permanent client and a fan in me. Best Wishes!

Situated on the main road behind birla planetarium, this is fairly decent place for eating in the area. The ambience and the decor are pretty ordinary. The service is bit slow and the food is satisfactory. I had a barbeque chicken mushroom pizza. It was okay but needs to be better. Onions should be less, mushroom and chicken were alright but they seemed to have stir fried curry like taste. Needs some improvement on that regard. Quantity is enough to feed 2 people.

A vast menu doesn't always mean a great menu.One Way cafe has dishes which are filled up to their brim and even though most of it is available it is not always the case for the food. I found the food well presented but bland in its taste and palette. Visited during the evening but found it quite busy on this unusual hour. Any ways the ambiance and service was good.

Sauteed mushroom Wrap

One way cafe took me on a two way ride. The food here left me nonplussed as the dishes I came across tasted good but was not cooked all the way through. 
We had Crispy Chili babycorn for starters which was served a little undercooked and felt raw. I complained to the waiter and got the item changed. 
The Veg Au Gratin,again, tasted good but the sauce wasn't thick and was very mushy.
The chocolate brownie with ice-cream that I had on a different occasion was just amazing. The brownie was hot and was served very beautifully. A must try.
The cafe is quite large with adequate seating capacity and offers an extensive menu to choose from. The service was good and prices seem just about fair for a cafe.

One way cafe is one such place where you can play safe. The ambience of this place gives out a feel of luxury while being light on the pocket. I had the opportunity of celebrating my birthday over here, the team put up a birthday song for me and all the attendants came down to our table to clap and cheer as I cut the cake. This sign of gratitude and care towards its customers stole the show for me.
The food and the mocktails were also good, but like I said, the team took the show away for me...
A big thumbs up for the team of one way cafe👍
Keep it up guys..

One way Café ,located very near to Birla planetorium on Chowringhee street is one of the more popular breakfast destinations in Kolkata and a continental food hub. We were seated in a room with walls painted with bookshelves and framed photos of old cars. We ordered crabmeat omlette, and fried ginger chicken strips along with green island mocktail and mango shake. Both the omlette and chicken strips were utterly delicious, and though the mango shake was good, the mocktail was at best, average. For mains, we were served sliced leg of lamb and barbequed chicken enchiladas. The lamb was delectable but the portions very less. The enchiladas were actually chicken cubes wrapped in a tortilla sheet with bell pepper and onion and baked with processed cheese...again a hit among us. The best part though, was the dessert- Baklava, which was divine and we savoured every last bite of it. However, the place is not as cheap as is listed in zomato, a meal for three cost us 1860 bucks and we were disappointed to find that some of the desserts and drinks were not availabe. Other than that, the service is excellent and the staff so very friendly. A visit again is surely in my books.

A visit to this place was long overdue. Finally, one day as my classes ended early, I decided to come here. It was around 8:30 in the morning and the place was empty. I was guided to the private lounge which was air conditioned and enclosed. It was pleasantly cool inside. 

As far as decor is concerned, there wasn't much. But the colour of the walls and the "impression of books in a book shelf" kind of pattern made me feel pretty good. 

I settled down comfortably and placed an order for their corporate breakfast. 

The waiter suggested watermelon juice among the juice options and it was definitely a good choice! I loved the juice as it wasn't overly sweet and the balance was just right! 

Then came the actual breakfast itself. It had two fried eggs, two pieces of tuna fillet, one hash brown, a little bit of lettuce and mustard as a salad (I guess) and one piece of sausage cut into half. Oh and also a Bread Basket with 4 slices and butter. 
The eggs were wonderful! The tuna which I had sandwiched between the bread wad also delicious. The Hash Brown was out of the world! I loved every bit of it! The sausage was also really delicious! Though I felt that two pieces of sausage should have been two full pieces and not one sliced in half. But that's just a minor issue (and the reason why I am pointing it out is because it was really delicious :P). Even the salad like thing with just a little bit of mustard dressing seemed amazing! 
Then they asked if I would like coffee or tea, to which I answered coffee. 
The coffee was placed before me and I was told that there was a little sugar in it and more had been provided if needed. I took a sip, and it was fabulous! It took me no time to gulp it down! 

The whole breakfast was of top notch quality and so far the best I've ever had. I found it even better than Flurys. 

Coming to the bill, the whole breakfast cost just Rs. 401!! I was astounded! The whole meal of perfection was just for Rs. 400!

I am highly impressed and I would definitely be back really soon. 

This place is not to be missed out on! I recommend this place strongly to all! Do pay a visit as soon as possible! 

Happy Dining!!

Beautiful place to have breakfast - they had ala carte as well as buffet when we visited. There was also a sea food theme on my visit (but sadly i  can't comment further as i'm a vegetarian :P). The ambiance was really nice with the walls painted as if it were stacked with books - a perfect setting to maybe discuss business with a client which we experience first hand at the table next to us.

We had Masala and Elaichi Tea which was too sweet according to me. The Brown Bread and Baked Beans was exquisite and delicious.

I had booked this place for my daughter's birthday party. I had chosen the continental cuisine since this is one of the best continental cuisines in Kolkata to offer.Everything was perfect and the food was just superb. This place can easily accommodate 120-150 people easily. The only issue i had that the vendor who was given to decorate this place was not too professional. The management should take care of this. Apart from this everything was just perfect. Thanks a ton.

Two things struck us when we walked inside this cafe last evening. Firstly, the decor was extremely classy, and secondly it was very very hot. We asked a waiter to notch up the AC and were told that 3 ACs were already running and the reason it was so hot was because they had an open kitchen and that was where the heat was coming from. The point was proven a little while later when along with the heat, the smell of cooking spices also wafted in and made us cough. It was quite a dampener to the general mood. We had the barbeque chicken pizza and the grilled sausage pizza. They were both okay, but a little spicy. We liked the barbeque chicken more. The prices were a little on the high side. The waiters were courteous, although a tad slow. Not the best experience overall.

Our son's birthday party on 29th May became unforgettable and special with the great service and hospitality gifted by the members of the ONE WAY CAFE. It was beyond our expectations and we are thankful to the whole team.  
                Next comes the food ..... it was delicious and awesome.... and all our invitees including us were overwhelmed. 
                We are residents of Ahmedabad and it is now obvious that we shall visit this place whenever we shall be in Kolkata.

I had organised birthday party of my daughter on 25th July 2016..was a party in there cafe banquet  for 50 pax and each one of them were very much disappointed by food and service..
Starters were not served just kept deep inside on a table.
Monte carlo  was served after most guests left.@
None of the food were eatable. .. everything was cold ...not even warm.
Technical  error in ac. . Water was dripping..
Staffs were not Co operative at all.. got water after 15 mins. ... please never go there ever...
Yes was also over billed...

The tables were wobbly.
The people around were making a lot of noise.
The coffee was good enough, nothing great.
Comfort level was okay again.

One way cafe is very near to my work place..so whenever i am not satisfied with the packed lunch i carry i drop by to ..well..over eat! One way cafe is sprawling property.. with an even more lavish menu. From breakfast to chinese, mexican to indian to american and even wraps, shakes,coffee..etc etc. The sandwiches, wraps and even the fish fry are really tasty but overpriced. Their fruit tart is amazing ..do try! Prawn dishes and the pastas make a scrumptous meal. The cafe indeed is an overall good experience but heavy on the pocket!

This place stole my heart not only with it's ambience and food but also with their hospitality.. Went there today at around 3.15 PM.. The place was nearly empty..i was about to seat on the cafe area when one of the staffs approached with a smile and guided me the lounge area so that i could relax a bit coz i way sweating like anything.. I got myself comfortable on one of the sofas of the louge area and after being served with water i placed my order.. I ordered for a VIRGIN MOJITO and STUFFED CHICKEN BREAST WITH MUSHROOM AND CHEESE..
The ambience of the lounge was very very soothing... A perfect place to relax. Now coming to the food.. The VIRGIN MOJITO was very refreshing.. It had the perfect balance of sweetness in it.. It was undoubtedly one of the best Virgin Mojitos I have had till date..

STUFFED CHICKEN BREAST WITH MUSHROOM AND CHEESE- it was served with mashed potato,garlic bread and sautéed vegetables.. It tasted heavenly.. The chicken was tender and juice and tasted amazing..the mashed potato was cheesy and was a perfect accompaniment to the chicken..

The staffs came and enquired whether i liked the food.. It was a really nice gesture.
The entire place have such a jovial vibe that i couldn't stop myself from falling for this place..

Will definitely visit again and will recommend everyone to try out this place atleast once..😊

Located at a prime location..this cafe is quite luxurious in looks..the interiors are nice. The staff is friendly..BUT the serving time is too long to be considered normal.
I ordered a pesto pasta and stuffed cigars at 6.15pm we got it served at 6.45pm..The pasta was undercooked though the pesto sauce was good. The stuffed cigars were a treat to eat..!! I loved the stuffed cigars.
But the serving tume, the rime to take an order, the time to deliver the check..were too long..this service is not expected when there is no full house and there are ample staff..!
Serving Time needs massive improvements.

Food is really good both taste wise and the way they were presented.There was only one problem. Compared to the size of the cafe,the air conditioning was poor.They had only 2 ACs covering the entire place.They have an open kitchen and the smoke from that was suffocating too!

Went there to have " baked cheesecake". To my disappointment they didn't have the desert. I have had chilled cheesecake not the baked one. Also ordered barbq chicken pizza and garlic cheese toast with jalapeños. Food was a disappointment. Never believed when people said that zomato ratings are misleading. I have always tried to go to diff places and try out unique things on the menu card. And will continue to do so. I wouldn't suggest this place personally. Plus on a Friday night they managed to get only one table occupied. And still the service was poor. They need to work hard on advertising and also try to get every item mentioned in the menu.

Food: Good, though quality of bread can be improved.
Ambience: Standard.
Waiters are friendly and the food served is good and of nice portions.
It is a nice stop for a lovely breakfast and lazy afternoon lunch.
Waiting time can be improved.
More options on soups required
I am already a consistent visitor of this place and would like improvements wherever possible.

Visited the place with my mum and grandmum, and the reception we got was grand! The staff is extremely sweet and helpful. Now for the main deal, the food. Mama-mia! They have the second best steak I've ever had in the city! Their cheese poppers are simply sinful and the veg lasgna was heavenly. Overall, this was one of my best eating out experiences, in a long time ! Would definitely go back.

Today as I was being roasted alive by the inclement sun, I had no option but to look for a respite. Respite came in the form of One Way Cafe.
I entered with my eyes closed, as my eyes were burning with perspiration. A staff guided me to a sink where I washed my face and became fresh. Then I looked around myself. It is a huge cafe with a tyre mark etched across the ceiling. Murals of vintage cars are also etched on the wall.
I sat down in one of the nearest table and asked for menu. They escorted me to a lounge as the air condition was better there. So the earlier portion I think was for smokers.
I must say that the staff are very good. They did not pester me with menu card and handed me one when I asked for it. While choosing food, the maitre de table maintained a respectful distance and gave me all the freedom I required.
I chose quiet tangy for drink and seafood
Salad. After five minutes, the drink came. It was cool and with a sweet and sour taste which I liked and it cheered me up.
Then came the salad. It was tastefully arranged. The lettuces were crunchy and tasty. The squid and crabmeat were soft. Very delicious. My only regret is that the quantity was too little and there was only one prawn there.
But anyway, looking into the fact that it tasted absolutely fabulous and the fact that the more one eats the fatter she gets, I think the quantity was justified.
The wallpaper had the theme of library in it, which is unique.
I left the place satiated and promising to return.

Have visited this place several times, it’s easy on pocket and offers tasty food. I love the sandwiches here (all the variants). The sandwiches are perfectly grilled and superbly presented with French fries, tomato and mustard sauce and salad. It’s a treat! Have tried their pizzas too, they are worth one try. Their Thai curry served with rice, salad, fries and a dessert is a complete meal and is any day a good bet for the hungry soul (I tried Thai green curry). Their garlic bread with cheese & jelapeno topping is my next favourite, closely followed by the one with tomato, basil & mozzarella topping. The grilled fish from this joint too is impressive. Have tried their grilled chicken with rosemary, tasted good. The lemon grass flavoured chicken soup too is a winner. The caesar salad here too is a favourite. In the dessert section Baklava is a must try. There is nothing extraordinary about the teas and coffees on offers. Once ordered for watermelon juice and was disappointed. Targeting the office goers and love birds visiting the Victorial Memorial, Maidan and Nandan area they have a small buffet too during lunch hour. They have a secluded seating area, which you can opt for if you are in mood for lounging. Everything is good about this place till you decide to order for paratha….. I tried the chicken paratha and veg paratha, the fillings were tasteless.

To windup it is a nice joint worthy of every penny you spent as long as you avoid their parathas.

The food here was good. But when I ordered my omelette they didn't ask me what kind of toast I want and just got white bread toast. Also I wanted to place an additional order and when I called the server he met another server on the way to my table and had a 40 second chat before he got to take my additional order. I think that was slightly unprofessional.

Dropped by this cafe last week on my short trip to kolkata...with my bestie of course...we sat at the reserved room which was done up in a stack of books printed wall paper.The staff was extremely courteous and prompt.

Coming to the food...we ordered for only finger food since we were not hungry...we ordered the mix one and midsummer night for drinks and prawn tempura,fish n chips,sauteed mushrooms.

The prawn tempura was fluffy and the prawn was fresh served with coleslaw....the fish was basa as we opted for it and lived up to its name...the mushrooms were well done too...the drinks were very refreshing and not overly sweet...just the right balance.

Loved the food...ambience and service!!

They really take care of their guests very well. Service was nice. They really think about their presentation very deeply. Presentation of dishes was very beautiful. You gonna liked the dish before you taste it only by seeing the presentation of dish. Food and beverages not only looks good but they also tastes very good. Beverages were very refreshing and tastes very delicious. Come to food i don't have words to express how much i love the food. They were just super tasty. Now it's time to coffee which was just perfectly made. I really had a royal experience here which was never forgettable. Personal favorite. Highly recommended to all.

A sudden plan to meet up with my friends and we Zomato-ed to reach this place. The rave reviews really did increase our expectations and we were not disappointed. The three of us decided to choose the "reserved" section because of the comfy looking sofa and beautiful decor. We had ordered: lemon grass chicken skewers, chicken stroganoff, cajun-spiced chicken patty burger, seafood salad and sweet lime soda. Although the prices were a little towards the steeper side, the food tasted delicious. Each of the items, from the skewers to the herb rice that accompanied the stroganoff was cooked to perfection. Only the seafood salad seemed to us a little smelly but that could be because we were not used to non-fried seafood. Overall, One Way cafe is a brilliant place to hangout and the food only makes the experience even better.

It was for months that I had this place on my wishlist. Finally I gave this place a visit on a January afternoon. And it left a sweet aftertaste and brought a big smile.

To reach here is pretty easy, head towards the exide crossing from Shakespeare sarani on Chowringhee road and its there opposite the Birla planetarium. Seating about 30 or so people the decor is minimal but its a spacious place. There are other separate seating pockets but we were guided to the main seating in the hall. There is something about open kitchen restaurants that I have come to not like. This was my second one and in both places I did not like the flavors and aroma of the other dishes being cooked interfering with what I had ordered.

Moving on with the food that we sampled, it was flat and furious potato for the starters. The dish was served in a way that made it much more yearning. In fact credit must be given for each of the dishes served for their presentation. Furious potato was served in porcelain Chinese soup spoons in small bite sized portions. Each was in the form of Indian papri chaat, with the deep fried potato forming the base with the topping of chopped onion and coriander and garnished with a dollop of spiced mayonnaise. Overall, it was an okay dish.

For main course we moved on to Chicken Stroganoff and Baked Bhetki Fillets. The chicken stroganoff was herb flavored rice served with a broth of boneless chicken strips cooked in a French sauce called veloute sauce. The chicken tasted good and its subtle taste went well with the flavored rice. The baked bhetki (Barramundi fish) was served on a bed of sauteed fettucini pasta with vegetables like carrots, beans, baby corns, zucchini and bell peppers and served with a orange and ginger flavored sweet sauce and presented with thin slices of oranges. The fish was cooked well but lacked proper seasoning and was a bit bland for my palate. The pasta with the vegetables and the sauce was just perfect.

Now coming to the best part of the meal, desserts. We settled for baklava and naughty brownie. It was just two of us and ordering one dessert for each was a bit too much. The baklava was crepes filled with khowa, deep fried and served with small portions of custard in small liquor shot glasses. One portion ordered had four helpings. The crunchy crepes tasted heaven with the filling and the custard as the dip. The naughty brownie was a well baked chocolate brownie served with vanilla ice cream and a chocolate and maple syrup sauce. I guess the ingredients are good enough to guess how it tasted. Bliss!!

Coming to the other aspects, as I said, the decor is minimal, of the kind of an American roadside cafe with spacious seating. The restrooms are cramped and need attention on the cleanliness and upkeep front. The service is prompt and the stewards are attentive but the dish service time is on the higher side, maybe cause of the nature of the dishes ordered. The prices are moderate (on the higher moderate side).

Overall, it was a nice experience. I would love to visit again, for the desserts especially. And special mention for the presentation.

Happy eating!!!

The cafe is situated near Birla Planetarium. I have been passing this place many times but today thanks to my fiance's recommendation I decided to give that place a try. The interiors are spacious and huge. I loved the decor. We asked to be allowed to sit in the interior lounge and the staff readily allowed us. The interior lounge is best for private conversations and lazily reclining on the super comfy seating arrangements that this upscale cafe sports. 

After office both of us couldnt have found a better place to relax. We ordered the Sausage salad in honey mustard and sweet chilli dressing and I must add the salad gives Subway and any other place in kolkata that serves salads a run for their money. 

It is moderately priced. Delicious and not filled with unnecessary veggies, the usp was the subtle dressing and the generous use of roasted sausages. 

I would love to visit again and taste the sea food this place has to offer. A big thank u to my dearest fiance for taking me here.

Though am no gastronome, yet I am always ready for an incredible and adventurous palate and 'The One Way Cafe' has definitely lived up to my expectations. I went there with my buddy on the eve of Christmas and to our surprise the place was quite empty... It has a comfy feel to it with a very well behaved staff.. We had ordered for Cheesy Chicken Lasagna, Chicken in red wine reduction with veggies, and baked cheese cake. The food was delectable... The lasagne was like the perfect comfort food while Chicken in red wine reduction was sumptuous and the baked cheese cake, oh!!! I could write an eulogy about it.... Lastly, they don't impose any service tax/service charge, which might add to your pleasant dining experience. Happy feasting.. :)

I stay in Gujarat and my husband in USA. And we were planning our 1st anniversary party in Kolkata for 90 guests. Credit goes to my husband for finding this gem of a place. It was perfect. Sanjibda of one way cafe guided us throughout and assured us of delivering 200%. See, I liked this place bcoz I swear by zomato, if zomato rates it 3.9 then I am already liking it. In addition, it has excellent location advantage which makes my work easy to guide guests. They made us taste all food prior to get our approval and take our inputs. They even closed their normal restaurant during our dinner buffet to hassle free accommodate our guests. Their staff is very very polite and accommodating. And their food!!! My all 90 guests left happy in their tummy. Especially the methi fish in mustard sauce and baked rosogulla. Sanjibda specifically remembered my suggestion and included brownie with the vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce. All this at a very very reasonable rate. I am very grateful to them for making my 1st anniversary a very memorable one for me as well as my family. Regards, Aparajita and Pradipto Bose .

The rating is based on the behavior of the management.

They have a lounge area where I have previously sat with my friends for luunch. When I called them up, they said to book I had to have a min order of 6.5k. They also said that if that area is empty the day I have my dinner party, we my use it.

But yesterday (the dinner day), they completely changed their words. First they lied and told me the lounge area was reserves for another party. When I proved they were lying, they blunty refused staying whateve thay had said over the phone!!

If the place is occupied, booking the lounge area is justified. But we were the only customers there the entire evening. I did not understand why they had to lie to our faces abs deny the phone call.

Terrible management!!

Its a pretty interesting cafe with an interesting menu. Here you find anything which you generally find in any other cafe. But the thing is this cafe offers you a lot more. Besides the sandwich, pasta, pizza and burgers, one can have salads, wraps, omlelet, cereals, paratha and what not. It has a huge menu which also includes starters and main courses.

With such a huge menu, one could easily get spoilt for choice which is the downside of this cafe. If it wants to remain a cafe with a limited menu then it should stop offering main courses and Chinese dishes. Moreover, for average cafe hoppers, the price of the items might not appear pocket-friendly. What I really like is the fruit juices they make. It was fresh and refreshing.

On the other hand, the decor is soothing and the service is commendable. The washroom however is dirty and needs a makeover. The best thing about this cafe is it keeps newspapers.

Maybe the reason One Way Cafe is not as popular or as celebrated as it should be is because the right customer base hasn't found the joint and the joint hasn't found its right customer base.

But the place impressed us where it coints, the food. Simple, wholesome, hearty & tasty; it was a happy experience. We had ordered a Barbequed Mushroom Burger (175 INR) & a Grilled Chicken in a rosemary redwine sauce reduction (345 INR). While the decor of the place was pretty alright, the presentation of the food were very nice. Ample in quantity, the burger was a fun eat. Personally, I liked the chicken better where the chicken pieces were a mouthful and the rosemary redwine sauce packed a lot of flavour with a strong savoury touch.

Looking forward to revisiting this place & going through their extensive menu. Recommended as a must try when you are around Chowringhee.

Loved the food, simple. We were out for a nice, quaint place with good food that doesn't burn craters into our not-so-deep pockets during Pujow. After several disappointments, we come across this cafe. 
The grilled fish in lemon-caper-coriander sauce and the grilled chicken in rosemary red wine sauce were both made very well. 
What is also surprising is that they do not charge service tax on the bill. Yayy.

Will return.

Ambience is pretty good, so is the service. Pretty decent pricing and is worth the price.  We orded Nachos n Virgin Mojhito, the latter was too good. Nice n friendly behaviour of the people too, overall the experience was quite nice.

Its a pretty interesting cafe with an interesting menu. Here you find anything which you generally find in any other cafe. But the thing is this cafe offers you a lot more. Besides the sandwich, pasta, pizza and burgers, one can have salads, wraps, omlelet, cereals, paratha and what not. It has a huge menu which also includes starters and main courses.

With such a huge menu, one could easily get spoilt for choice which is the downside of this cafe. If it wants to remain a cafe with a limited menu then it should stop offering main courses and Chinese dishes. Moreover, for average cafe hoppers, the price of the items might not appear pocket-friendly. What I really like is the fruit juices they make. It was fresh and refreshing.

On the other hand, the decor is soothing and the service is commendable. The washroom however is dirty and needs a makeover. The best thing about this cafe is it keeps newspapers.

Maybe the reason One Way Cafe is not as popular or as celebrated as it should be is because the right customer base hasn't found the joint and the joint hasn't found its right customer base.

But the place impressed us where it coints, the food. Simple, wholesome, hearty & tasty; it was a happy experience. We had ordered a Barbequed Mushroom Burger (175 INR) & a Grilled Chicken in a rosemary redwine sauce reduction (345 INR). While the decor of the place was pretty alright, the presentation of the food were very nice. Ample in quantity, the burger was a fun eat. Personally, I liked the chicken better where the chicken pieces were a mouthful and the rosemary redwine sauce packed a lot of flavour with a strong savoury touch.

Looking forward to revisiting this place & going through their extensive menu. Recommended as a must try when you are around Chowringhee.

Loved the food, simple. We were out for a nice, quaint place with good food that doesn't burn craters into our not-so-deep pockets during Pujow. After several disappointments, we come across this cafe. 
The grilled fish in lemon-caper-coriander sauce and the grilled chicken in rosemary red wine sauce were both made very well. 
What is also surprising is that they do not charge service tax on the bill. Yayy.

Will return.

I had been neglecting this place as I thought that it wasn't good enough for a visit. But it proved me wrong.

One way cafe, as the name suggests, is a one way route to taste, quality and presentation. It means business and provides excellent food. I've become a huge fan of this place.

I visited this place one evening and I couldn't find a better place where I could sit and spend time. The interiors are simple. The seating is spacious. They also have a small room inside which could host around 15-20 ppl. The staff were very helpful n courteous. Have never seen such smart staff in any other cafe in Kolkata.
We ordered for a Tomato toscana Soup, and stuffed cigars. The soup was spot on. Hitting the taste buds at the right spot. I've been craving for a good tomato soup from long, and one way cafe fulfilled my wish. My eyes were glittery after having the first sip of the soup and I even gulped down half from my friend's bowl. 
The stuffed cigars were excellent. Hot, crispy and had a generous filling in it. The presentation was lovely. The dip accompanied was going along with the cigars quite well.

The only thing I couldn't understand was why hasn't this place been famous when It provides excellent food. I am surely looking of coming back to this place soon.

The ambience is good enough, considering their pricing policy . Food is quite good ! Sandwiches and veg paratha are delicious . Pizza wasn't as crispy as required but topping was perfect. Pasta is fine! The drinks are somewhat below average. Cheesecake is tasty. DON'T order waffles.

This place is situated between Theatre Road and Exide just opposite of Birla Planetorium. Although they named it as Cafe they served awesome continental foods with amazing Sandwiches. I have been here couple of times in last few days.it has a lounge with few books and classy interior. The kitchen sound may sometime hamper the ambience. Staffs are very polite and the service is quite fast. Foods are really great.

It was confused day for us to select a restaurant to have dinner. We have ended up going to this cafe. It was nicely located which any one could easily find. Entering the cafe... Wow... So spacious... Very nicely decorated... Very simple... Now about the food. We ordered for chicken cheesy lasagne, stuffed chicken roasted with veg, thumps up and one cocktail. Drinks are served instantly. But food serving time was 15-20 minutes. 
Lasagne was nice, cooked perfectly, taste good, quantity enough for one... staffed chicken tasted good but chicken breast was typically hard and not juicy... Mocktail was also good...
The only plus point was courteous staff at the cafe...
Overall experience was good...

The presentation of the food feeds the soul before you even take the first bite and then some more...

Chowringhee has some fine places on offer to foodies and this sure is one of them. The ambience is sublime and the place has a cool nice vibe to it. The décor is soothing and so is the food. You won't be disappointed if you take the time to visit this place.

It feels good when you hope for a place to be good and it turns out to be so and that's what happened in my case. Hot and humid climate and I was just out with a friend and needed a place to sit and catch up. One Way Café took care of my need brilliantly. The quality they maintain is above my expectations.

I'd surely recommend this joint to all.

I feel like Christopher Columbus after discovering this place. High on good food!
It has become one of my regular eat out places. 

Quite a large space for a cafe. Good looking place. Basic ambience. 
Food is exemplary. One of the best continental cuisine serving places I've ever tried. The food preparation is very European, taking the popular European varieties of the dishes they serve.

What we tried:
•Chicken Lemongrass Soup:

A very uniquely prepared Thai soup. Not too clear, not very thick. Made using coconut, lime leaves and ginger, this is a must-have broth for people who love soups. It is low in carbs, and thus appeals to the healthy eater as well.
This place does justice to this dish. My favourite place for this dish, at the moment.
Taste - 4.7/5 
Presentation - 4.5/5

•Chicken Stroganoff 

This is originally a Russian dish, but is also very popular in Brazilian kitchens, and thus many consider it Brazilian.
It consists of strips of chicken filet with a mushroom, onion and sour cream sauce, and is served over rice.
One of the very few restaurants serving a amazing stroganoff. Must try.
Taste - 5/5
Presentation - 4.7/5

•Chicken Thai Curry

There are various Thai curries available all over the world. This place serves a take on the popular 'kaeng kari'. 
This curry is richer and creamier than other Thai curries, since coconut cream is used in addition to coconut milk. 
This curry is served with steamed rice. 
It's a must try for Burmese and Thai cuisine lovers.
Taste - 4.7/5
Presentation - 4.7/5

•Baklava

This is one dessert that has various adaptations by various regions all over the world. It has originated from the Ottoman Empire, and thus is considered Turkish.
One of the most unique desserts I've ever had the pleasure of tasting.

I won't go into the specifics for this one. All I'd say is try one, on my recommendation. You'll thank me for the rest of your life and so will the others whom you pass this little advice on to.
I've tried several varieties of Baklava, this is my current favourite.

This food joint can boast of everything! It is located opposite the island of Birla Planetarium in the Exide area. So the location can be termed as both convenient and posh. If you do not mind splurging a few extra bucks in return of some quality ambiance, prompt service and obviously good food then One Way Cafe should be your call. Sink in the sofa and relax against the backdrop of a library themed wall. Go on a date or hang out with your friends. Give your family a good time or complete your work assignment. You can do anything here. It is so peaceful. Our order included Pasta Arabiatta and Grilled chicken sausage burger. The burger came with complementary salad, sauce and french fries! The quantity was enough for one. The presentation of the burger won my heart.

I have visited this place thrice and each time my experiance has been really good. I went to this place first at an early morning with one of my friend. The location of this place is really pleasant. But it usually remains empty most of the time as not many people know about this place so they might not have an idea about the food served here. But to my surprise this place offers the best sandwiches so far that i have had in kolkata. It has a quiet ambience and a plus one for those who dont like too busy places. The service here is also very good. I really appreciate the way they have made the interiors. This place opens up quite early in the morning , I visited twice during the early morning hours and it was a great delight. They have an exceptional good menu. I also liked the pasta, drinks served here. Every bite of the dish was spectacular. The sandwiches are to die for. Service is always fast and friendly. 
Altogether it was happy hour and phenomenal.

Location of this place is very good. In middle of theatre road and exide. 
When i entered i was expecting good amount of customers, but it was empty.
Open kitchen idea is superb,but too noisy at times i must say. I do wish the staffs keeps their private jokes a little low. 
Coming to the food. We ordered chicken,mushroom, onion sandwich, chicken risotto and one kiwi apple juice. There were four pieces of sandwiches served with french fries which made me very happy. Usually we get two. Nicely grilled and filling. One of the best sandwiches in town.Kiwi juice was pulpy yet refresing. But the risotto was a tad dissapointing.i am no great cook but comparing the taste of risottos in other places, i thought it wasnt supposed to be that sticky and hard to chew. 
The menu here is very impressive, i wish to visit again and try some other items.

One Way Cafe is located on Jawaharlal Nehru road close to the theatre road crossing..They are known for their continental cuisine..it has  a decent enough interior,a separate lounge room with some books..making it an ideal for a cup of coffee or burgers..This place actually serve some of the finest and tastiest Sandwiches you will ever taste in Kolkata..Though the prices are a bit high for a Cafe and this place may not be ideal for college goers..but surely you should give it a try for their sheer expertise in Sandwiches and Pastas..They also have an all day Small eat buffet running at just 250/-+tax..Highly Recommended items are their Special Sandwiches which are grilled and has two layers..one layer filled with eggs while the second layer filled with toppings of your choice and served with fries..It is actually pretty difficult for one person to finish a plate of sandwich..Also their coollers and smoothies are very refreshing..Other Recommended items includes Pizzas..Spaghetti with meat balls and their Grilled Chicken..They also serve thai foods and bengali dishes but they are not worth the prices they charge..But you should visit this place just to taste their sandwiches..

Braveheart would be such an understatement when one shows the audacity of choosing an eatery over one of his girlfriend's choice for a romantic breakfast. Add to that the fact that the place chosen is an infant of one-and-a-half year old and the place rejected is a certain fluri's. Yes I would probably be cursed upon by the connoiseurs around town for a thousand years to come, but wait, sit,relax and give my humble review a read before all of you do so. 

As the server told me, the place owes its name to the concept of one way transport along the JL Nehru road by which it lies. There wasn't any chance of love at first sight with us standing in front of it as the frontal view was nothing to be excited of,except its size. (This place has large inner space). The decor was good, but didnt have any specific orientation to any particular theme. Once we were seated, we were given the menu in no time. And their was warmth in the smile in face of the person catering us. 

We ordered an orange juice,  a paneer bhurji sandwich,  a flat and furious potato and  a nepolitan cheese omelette. The servings  came in no time,ane in just the order we wanted them. The first thing to notice was the plating. Their attention to even the most minute detail made us amazed. And they were just as much function as their form. The sandwich was not only delicious,it contained some juicy cravings inside. Tender yet crunchy, aromatic and grilled to perfection, I think they would make  one of the finest grillers in town. The flat and furious potato was tangy,crispy,layered and added zing to the taste buds. The fried smilies provided along with the meal were delectable additions which we relished. The nepolitan omelette was just divine. It is not just a cheese omelette. It is the cheese omelette to have. Cheese all around but taste of omelette prevailin,with noodles tangled all over it, dont know whether it is any lesser than an invention of a taste of next level. The orange juice was fresh like gentle pour of first monsoon rain with wholesome goodness of fresh orange pulp.
To sum it up, we just ate our heart out (was more of a brunch to say the truth). We never had the joy of eating together in such a divine way and with absolutely no disturbance at all for a long, long time. 
We owe it another visit, what say

Its like the best cafe that i have ever been to. Loved the food, the area, large space and a cool setting. The food was great and i know that i will go back there very soon. The only complain is the kitchen noise is so loud that it realy disrupts the environment sometimes. Overall had a great time today.

Stylish décor, mannerly crew, mouth watering and elaborate buffet spread, what else do you expect on a lazy Monday lunch?
Six of us went to explore lunch there. We had been offered a cosy private lounge where we had soup of the day(tomato soup) and it was simply wicked awesome. Starting from soup to dessert, each item was really yummy, especially the caramel crusted was little unusual; cos they added slim juliennes of carrots as topping which was simply superb. But the chicken wasn't soft and juicy, may be it was over cooked. But overall experience was nice and the price of buffet wasn't shocking at all.

Spacious interiors. An extensive menu. And a very chilled out ambience. Great for a leisurely breakfast/brunch, especially if you're hanging out with old, close friends.

Food is mostly good. Portions could be bigger though, for the price they charge. 

The meatball pizza we had was very good.

Not really sure why they named this a cafe...since it has a foot-long menu. The decor is a spacious one,which is quite pleasing,especially since they have a glass wall facing the street infront. 
We gorged on the sausage salad with honey mustard dressing( had lettuce and cherry tomato)...this was quite good.
Next,for mains,i ordered a thai chicken curry while my friend ordered a stuffed chicken breast. The thai curry was beautiful...with a delicate fragance of lemon. Though i would have been happier if the coconut in the curry was hand-ground to provide some texture. 
The chicken breast,though was not upto the mark as the gravy tasted wierd and overseasoned.The mashed potato on the side was good,though.
The thing that really blew our minds away was the baklava we had for dessert. Very nice presentation... crunchy rolls with custard,comes in a tasting platter of four.
Pricewise,a tad bit overpriced... Not really for the students to hang out...which again goes against my image of a cafe.

A pretty cafe located at Chowringhee opposite to the Birla Planetarium. Beautifully lit this cafe may be a bit expensive for the students. I met my school peep after 4 years at this place and ordered:
Chicken sausage salad with cherry tomatoes for the starter. Shredded lamb with boiled vegetables & Grilled chicken T-breast followed as Main course and ended with baklava as dessert! Quantity they provide is appreciable. All the dishes were cooked beautifully and were delicious. Baklava was heavenly. But if you visit this place make sure your pocket pinch is sound enough. 
You can definitely give this place a shot. Worth a visit.

There are restaurants, there are diners, there are cafes, and lastly there are restaurant shaped as diners and cafes. One needs to maintain the demarcations.

This has 5 pages of food options including main course and 3 types of coffee. So it's not exactly a cafe but american diner style restaurant. Beware of the misnomer.

Food is albeit good with standard options and decently priced, if not super expensive.

Lastly, dear management, fake bookshelf wallpaper in lounge? like seriously?

Nice ambience, courteous staff, We had fish and chips and chicken wrap. Fish and chips was overpriced considering quantity. Chicken wrap was filing but too much of  raw onion  slices make it bit pungy which I didn't like. They could have fried the onions. The fresh lime soda was refreshing though. Overall the experience was nice.

I probably would have been much happier if the food I ordered that day not tasted so blunt. Kolkata with its reputation of being the city of dharna, strike, roadblocks and "michhils" stood up fully to its name. Jam packed roads and reluctant taxi drivers had already made that day worse by then and we were desperately looking for a quiet place to sit and have our lunch. And also I was carrying a recently bought american tourister check in luggage that most definitely didn't make our case easier!! 
With the entry to this restaurant we received cold welcome but very soon they picked it up and guided us to their reserved area. It was a cozy seating in a relaxing environment, i was relieved. But the seating arrangement I felt was more like a coffee or tea junction, where you can chat for hours with your friends and colleagues over a cup of coffee or tea not like a restaurant where you can eat something or have your meal. Nonetheless, we ordered one way fish and chips, cheese chicken sandwich, one pineapple blossom and one minty apple. To describe the food in one word is disappointing. Fish and chips were plain batter fried fish and French fries with a tartar dip and little salads. Quality was not good, quantity was less, didn't taste anything special but the price was quite high compared to that. Sandwich was properly grilled and the chutney dipping goes well with it. Pineapple blossoms was as usual but the minty apple tasted horrible. I was disappointed with their food. 
I must say their behaviour was something what impressed me the most on that day. If I consider revisiting this food place again in future that would be solely for the warm and courteous behavior of their staffs. Probably some promotional photoshoot was going on and that's why with our permission they clicked some random photos of us when we were enjoying our food. It was fun..
We left with unhappy stomachs and  happy hearts.
I would rate this place 3.3....

I had noticed this cafe on my way to exide from college. This one is just opposite birla planetarium. Was deciding to go to mocha. When we suddenly decided to drop into this cafe , dropping the idea of going to mocha. On entering what we saw was a huge caféteria having a newspaper stand and of course a huge open kitchen. The beautiful smell of food made me go crazy. The decor is quite simplistic. It seems like a car frenzied person had selected the decor. The ceiling is a rubber tyre. And anywhere you look its about cars and wheels. The seating arrangement is however too formal for a cafe whose basic theme is cars. So this definitely has to be worked upon. The staffs are really nice. They are of great help helping you to select what you like. Did not quite know they make good sandwiches, I regret of not having ordered for one. We Simply decided to order for a coffee, but the machine was giving trouble. They later on worked on the machine and there we ordered for a hot cappuccino. I chose the tropical delight. It was mango shake, coconut milk and pineapple juice all clubbed in. Its basically pina colada and I loved it. The cappuccino had a cute human face and the coffee tasted awesome. Strong and rich crème. Then we decided to skip the starters and simply go in for the main course. One of the courteous staffs suggested , we go in for the grilled vetki. But my friend was a sheer anti fish person. So we simply stuck to stuffed chicken breast. The garnishing was amazing. The brown sauce tasted awesome only thing was it had overt asparagus tinge. But nonetheless the chicken tasted amazing. Soft and succulent . Melted in the mouth. Almost half filled. We fought on whether to have another main course or a dessert. However this was me winning finally. We asked the staff the staff to suggest and he suggested we should go for a baklava. The presentation and the yumm factor was out of the world. The crispy chhanar goja dipped in crème cheese came in shot glasses. I felt as if I was in another world. Peace prevailing all over me. The bill was quite decent as compared to the other cafes in town. I am surely going back to taste their sandwiches. Cheers and rock on!!

Visited this again just to catch hold of the warm old smile of the staffs and ofcourse the main aim bring trying out their sandwiches. I was convinced that I wanted the smoked chicken sausage sandwich, but then of course my eyes struck on to the tuna and bell paper sanswich. Amazing. Tuna was available. Ordered for a tea as well. A black tea. The liquor was just too perfect. And the tuna sandwich. Amazing. They serve it with tomato mustard sauce and french fries, which furthermore enhances the sensation of the taste buds. Out of the world. I am running back soon just to taste the sandwich. @

One Way Cafe...a definite simple and good time with friends. We walked in on a Sunday evening...as we were just looking for a place to sit back, sip on a cup of mochacino and shakes...relax and just keep on chatting... the coffee was really smooth... the shakes were very tasteful as well. As we entered we were taken to the sitting area with the couches... the place suited our mood and a Sunday fits to be spent there. The music could have been better. Overall a good experience, will surely give a second visit... happy brewing!!

I would have given this place 3 but the way they serve the food is beautiful and very experimenting approach (hence the extra 0.5). The waiters are very kind and give you all the time you need to choose from the menu. Ambience is decent, but the open kitchen is a not-so-common thing. Now coming to the food, I started with a Caesar salad, which looked pretty good but I have had better salads, not that this one was bad but something was better in the other ones that I had recently. Next we had Baked fish which was served with a orange sauce and vegetables, which is a new thing and quite delicious. And for the desert I wanted Baked cheesecake, but the waiter was kind enough to inform they had only one stale piece left (trust me, I have had some bitter experiences) so I opted for Baklava and I was happy with my choice. It was served in four shot glasses, very different approach, with a 'kheer' dip and chocolate sauce. All in one it was a nice experience and worth a visit when you are nearby.

They do have a good range of sandwiches which are filling and tasty.Even the grilled chicken and chicken stroganoff were nice..I have always ordered food from here but not had it in the restaurant.Plan to give it a try to experience the ambience too.

My next food hunting expedition took me to this new joint named One Way Cafe. Situated opposite Birla Planetarium, this huge cafe joint was pretty impressive. It's technically huge for a cafe but gives you a pleasant ambience and makes you feel welcomed. The staff is very cautious and polite. Now coming to the food, my fiancé and I were pretty much impressed with the menu so we settled down with Peppercino and Arabiatta pasta with cappuccino. And my, it was delicious. Both the pastas were well cooked. The proportion was also good enough for one person. Coffee was strong and tasted good. Overall pretty good cafe to grab a quick snack or indulge into a varied three course continental meal.

I had been to this cafe sometime back. Its on Chowringee Road near Haldirams. The first impression as you enter the cafe is that, boy, is huge for a cafe. The ceilings are pretty high and the decor exudes a pleasant charm. The seating is limited, but I kind of liked the idea of a cross between a cafe and a lounge. It's simply done, yet tasteful and lively. 
Now coming to the food. I wasnt much hungry and hence, ordered for a BBQ chicken pizza and a mango smoothie. Infact, the staff there helped me with the order, speaking of which, I must say that the staff people are really polite, courteous and tend to you with a smile on their face. 
The mango smoothie was really nice, subtle and not too sweet, just the way I like it.  The garnishing was nice and I liked the idea of using a slice of a mango for the garnishing. The pizza was really good, infact better than some other joints. The portion was sufficient for one person, infact, it was a bit too much for me. 
My rating is purely based on the fact that I couldn't y much of the preparations on the menu,  but I would surely love to go back again.

We also ordered a chocolate shake, pineapple and mango blossoms. Try the pineapple if it's available. It was good!

One Way Cafe - Excellent Cafe which City of Joy needed.
===================

Introduction:

One Way Cafe is a newly opened cafe in main road of Chowringhee. This cafe is HUGE!. When i first entered this cafe, i was like a little surprised because of the high ceilings, interiors simple yet beautifully decorated lounge inside. In all, i was quite impressed with such a BIG cafe that too in the midst of Chowringhee. The best part about this cafe is there are quite a number of tuition center's nearby which will surely boost up the sales as the youngsters would definitely love to try this new cafe.

The location of this cafe is very easy to discover. Go straight from Haldiram's (Haldiram to Birla planetorium side) towards the Signal. Just before the signal, on the right side you will discover One Way Cafe.

I had gone there just before the day of World Cup and they had been playing music of World Cup and had added on a World Cup Menu which was impressive. The decor was minimal yet beautiful. They do have drinks section. However, i could not see any cocktail there. :P The walls had book art wallpaper stuck on and small car's which added on to the decor of the cafe. :)

Food:

I took my seat in the lounge in the comfortable sofa and placed my order: -

1) Chicken Thai Curry served with cashew nuts on top of plain rice - It was excellent just the way it should be. However, i would want to add on the suggestion that the chicken thai curry to be served in a "large" bowl because the rice was quite more as compared to the chicken and gravy made by adding coconut cream/oil. It was served with cashew nuts on top of rice and fried yums. (papad). The salad dressing with mustard sauce on top was an add on.

This reminded me of One step up's Chicken Thai Curry.

2) Vegetable Wrap - Defried beans, bell peppers, onion in mexican style. I really enjoyed their preparation and specially how the fries were served inside the small 'vodka shot' glass. I was waiting for someone to start off this concept in kolkata and here you go. :) Excellent preparation. It was served with salad dressing with mustard sauce on top and salsa dip.

3) One way cafe Ice cream - it comprised of all the fruits in the glass and chocolate chips sprinkled on top with vanilla ice cream. It was good too. 

8th aug - recent visit 
[4) Veg pizza - Thin crust pizza having paneer, onion and capsicum Topped with Mozarella Cheese - It was fine. Nothing out of the world type. 

5) Vegetable Thai Green Curry - It's a must try for the vegetarian. However, still the rice is quite more than the vegetable gravy portion. 

6) White Sauce Penne Pasta topped with Parmesan Cheese - Must try out here. ]
===================
Pros:

1) Excellent Food quality.
2) Excellent Food presentation.
3) Opened in the Prime location.
4) Good Hospitality - Staffs were quite courteous and moderately prompt.
5) Quite reasonably priced. I expected the bill to go high. However, it made me happy. :P
6) Soft music as background to soothe your mind.
7) A lot of varieties to offer to both the vegetarians and non vegetarians.
8) Hygiene is adequately maintained.
9) Amazing ambience and wall decor.
10) Not at all cramped and you can enjoy your privacy.
11) The A la carte was nicely designed briefing each item perfectly.
12) Lounge has sofas. Cafe has chairs. Choose where you can sit comfortably. :)

Cons:
1) No introduction about the cafe in the start of the A la carte. It just started off with dishes.
2) The fries can taste much better. They need improvement.
3) The bill charged Vat total 14.94% which is a wrong way of charging. The service tax and Vat to be shown seperately. Please take note of it.
4) The time taken to serve to be minimised a bit.
===================
Suggestions:

1) Add on introduction on the A la carte.
2) Keep continuing to serve efficiently and effectively.
3) Yes, i understand your cafe does have a feedback form. However, it does not provide with the comment section but only ticking food, ambience and service. I would like to bring it to your notice to kindly add on the comment portion in order to serve your customers better.
4) Charge Vat and Service Tax separately.
===================
Meal for two: 500 - 850(max)

Summary:

Food quality 4.5/5
Food quantity 4.7/5
Value for money 4.5/5
Hygiene 4.6/5
Taste 4.8/5
Hospitality 4.7/5
===================
Conclusion:

I would love to Visit One Way Cafe in the near future and i have quite high hopes from this cafe. Don't let me down. Lovely and impressive. :)

Note:
1) I have taken the pictures of the "lounge" section.
2) This review is my "unbiased" opinion based on "my dining" experience.

I have the most enjoyable experience here, not once but twice. The waiters and staff are very polite and hospitable. The decor is pretty good. Priced reasonably. 
You must try out the prawn tempura,  sliced lamb leg. In the dessert "the bakhlawa " is something,  which even is better than a chocolate dessert. Also you may try out " raabri on choco matt". Very good. 
I would be glad if they don't use readymade choco syrup, rather make their own instead.

The best part about this cafe is there are quite a number of tuition center's nearby which will surely boost up the sales as the youngsters would definitely love to try this new cafe.

The location of this cafe is very easy to discover. Go straight from Haldiram's (Haldiram to Birla planetorium side) towards the Signal. Just before the signal, on the right side you will discover One Way Cafe.

I had gone there just before the day of World Cup and they had been playing music of World Cup and had added on a World Cup Menu which was impressive. The decor was minimal yet beautiful. They do have drinks section. However, i could not see any cocktail there. :P The walls had book art wallpaper stuck on and small car's which added on to the decor of the cafe. :)

Food:

I took my seat in the lounge in the comfortable sofa and placed my order: -

1) Chicken Thai Curry served with cashew nuts on top of plain rice - It was excellent just the way it should be. However, i would want to add on the suggestion that the chicken thai curry to be served in a "large" bowl because the rice was quite more as compared to the chicken and gravy made by adding coconut cream/oil. It was served with cashew nuts on top of rice and fried yums. (papad). The salad dressing with mustard sauce on top was an add on.

This reminded me of One step up's Chicken Thai Curry.

2) Vegetable Wrap - Defried beans, bell peppers, onion in mexican style. I really enjoyed their preparation and specially how the fries were served inside the small 'vodka shot' glass. I was waiting for someone to start off this concept in kolkata and here you go. :) Excellent preparation. It was served with salad dressing with mustard sauce on top and salsa dip.

3) One way cafe Ice cream - it comprised of all the fruits in the glass and chocolate chips sprinkled on top with vanilla ice cream. It was good too. 

8th aug - recent visit 
[4) Veg pizza - Thin crust pizza having paneer, onion and capsicum Topped with Mozarella Cheese - It was fine. Nothing out of the world type. 

5) Vegetable Thai Green Curry - It's a must try for the vegetarian. However, still the rice is quite more than the vegetable gravy portion. 

6) White Sauce Penne Pasta topped with Parmesan Cheese - Must try out here. ]
===================
Pros:

1) Excellent Food quality.
2) Excellent Food presentation.
3) Opened in the Prime location.
4) Good Hospitality - Staffs were quite courteous and moderately prompt.
5) Quite reasonably priced. I expected the bill to go high. However, it made me happy. :P
6) Soft music as background to soothe your mind.
7) A lot of varieties to offer to both the vegetarians and non vegetarians.
8) Hygiene is adequately maintained.
9) Amazing ambience and wall decor.
10) Not at all cramped and you can enjoy your privacy.
11) The A la carte was nicely designed briefing each item perfectly.
12) Lounge has sofas. Cafe has chairs. Choose where you can sit comfortably. :)

Cons:
1) No introduction about the cafe in the start of the A la carte. It just started off with dishes.
2) The fries can taste much better. They need improvement.
3) The bill charged Vat total 14.94% which is a wrong way of charging. The service tax and Vat to be shown seperately. Please take note of it.
4) The time taken to serve to be minimised a bit.
===================
Suggestions:

1) Add on introduction on the A la carte.
2) Keep continuing to serve efficiently and effectively.
3) Yes, i understand your cafe does have a feedback form. However, it does not provide with the comment section but only ticking food, ambience and service. I would like to bring it to your notice to kindly add on the comment portion in order to serve your customers better.
4) Charge Vat and Service Tax separately.
===================
Meal for two: 500 - 850(max)
===================
Summary:

Food quality 4.5/5
Food quantity 4.7/5
Value for money 4.5/5
Hygiene 4.6/5
Taste 4.8/5
Hospitality 4.7/5
===================
Conclusion:

I would love to Visit One Way Cafe in the near future and i have quite high hopes from this cafe. Don't let me down. Lovely and impressive. :)

Note:
1) I have taken the pictures of the "lounge" section.
2) This review is my "unbiased" opinion based on "my dining" experience.

I have the most enjoyable experience here, not once but twice. The waiters and staff are very polite and hospitable. The decor is pretty good. Priced reasonably. 
You must try out the prawn tempura,  sliced lamb leg. In the dessert "the bakhlawa " is something,  which even is better than a chocolate dessert. Also you may try out " raabri on choco matt". Very good. 
I would be glad if they don't use readymade choco syrup, rather make their own instead.

Located beside Sahara Sadan opposite Birla Planetarium, One way cafe is not just great to chill over some coffee but also pretty good for a restaurant. Though relatively new on the circuit, i feel the restaurant did not get its due share of publicity but going by my experiences here, i feel they are here to stay.

The place is huge with limited tables. Plus the ceilings are pretty high which ensure a feel of great spaciousness.  The decor is nice with wall art of cars all around. The staff is pretty warm, polite. The food is very reasonably priced with preparations being top notch though helpings are bit small compared to most places, still very value for money !!

Coming to food, loved their cheese jalapeno garlic bread but nachos were pretty average. The pasta in pesto sauce is one of the better ones, if not best compared to what is served elsewhere but for 150 bucks it is simply amazing. The spaghetti aglio olio is pretty good. Veg au gratin is good but pizzas tasted very average. Cottage cheese steak tasted good in tomato mustard dressing, but could be better if served in brown sauce. The desserts are very well presented and i loved their rabri on choco mat, would recommend it.

Overall a welcome break from the small congested restaurants that are coming up doubled up with great food at very decent prices!!

One Way Cafe was where I actually ended up being asked to attend a business meeting !!! Not that I am complaining its a pleasant change from offices especially when one works a six day week ! Plus I got to try a new place out so that turned into an added bonus. Ambiance is decent enough and service was good as well. 
Given the warm weather I ordered a Sunny Fizz which was quite decent because I like citrus flavors .... it was a mocktail made with Orange juice and Lemonade. We also ordered Grilled Chicken Sausages and Chilly Cheese Poppers which were quite nice and made for a good snack. 
Over-all we had a nice experience and I would certainly like to go back to try out some of their main - course items especially the Stuffed Chicken Breast and Sliced Leg of Lamb.

ok!! its just a very random place i discovered while walking from sadan towards jeevandeep, and then decided to visit it someday! and the first day i went turned out to be my birthday! till now i visited this place thrice in this month!!  its just near my college, 1st time i was shocked seeing the prices of the food, although last sat i went, i noticed they have increased few prices but that is pocket friendly too!! 

now, lets come to the ambiance and service : the management is very polite, i went with my whole gang of frenz, and we literally occupied the whole lounge section :-P !! the wallpaper there is interesting , i loved the ambiance, all the old Enrique songs along wid the linkin park tracks made our mood totally!!! 

i loved the baby corns, and ofcrs the MUST TRY - the bar-b-q chicken pizza!! the non-veg starters are also delicious! i loved the white pasta- Alfredo!  

but, the amount of the bolognise minced pasta served was too less! and i would really suggest the chef to prepare some more varieties of coolers!

but  THANK YOU for opening such a lovely joint , will keep on visiting! ;-) 

next time i wish to have something from the breakfast menu! :-P

One hot hot summer evening, while returning home from office, we decided to give this cool looking place a try.We had read good reviews of the place, so our expectation was high.Our order was lemongrass flavoured chicken broth, Caesar salad, stuffed chicken breasts and baklava.

The broth was very tasty with full of exotic veggies, chicken strips and mushroom in a pristine while broth flavoured strongly with, of course, lemongrass.However, the quantity is too less to be shared one by two.

Caesar salad was OK, as it should be.A bit less lettuce a bit more chicken would have helped though.

Stuffed chicken breasts were some sort of a disappointment.After reading rave reviews about it, we expected a gastronomical delight.The dish was however very less in quantity, over before you even start to get the taste.The breast piece, (not the whole breast, certainly) was cut in discs and stuffed with  mushroom onion cooked in a brown sauce.Not that it wasn't nice, but definitely below our expectation.I have had much better stuffed breast in Smart Kolkata.

The Baklava was novel and great.Presented as a set of four mini "chai" glasses it was a thin wanton sheet stuffed with chhena and dipped in half a glass full of kesar pistachio flavoured malai.I really loved the concept and taste.

Pros
1)Taste of food
2)Ambience is good.spacious.They have a small private banquet as well I guess, where you can hold private gatherings.One was going on when we visited.Was a bit noisy.
3)Service is good
4)Location is spot on.

Cons:
The quantity is very less.You can increase your price a bit if  you want, but do give substantial portions.I would have given a 4 had it not been for the miniscule portions.

I had recently been to One Way Cafe which is exactly opposite to Birla Planetarium. I chose this place owing to the reviews in Zomato.  I had in mind that the next time I have a day out with friends, I  must visit this new place. 
My friends also wanted to try it out on my advice. And thank god all three of us liked it very much. We sat in the lounge which is on the inside and therefore it  restricts the street view. We loved that area as it was quiet and relaxing. First we ordered Chicken B-B-Q Pizza which was delivered in justified time. The aroma of the freshly baked pizza was mouthwatering. It tasted really good. Next we ordered a cheese and chicken sandwich , which was also very yummy and lastly we tried out the stuffed chicken breast. The sauce was very tasty and the chicken was cooked really well. 
Thanks to one way cafe for offering really good food.
The staff was also quite good and quick. I recommend people to try it out if you want to hangout in a new place in the city with your friends.

Last Friday , i had visited the Oneway Cafe for the third time in three weeks with my partner. 
Very conveniently located and easy to spot, it cheers me up whenever i walk into the brightly lit big hall. The sitting is minimal and quite spacious. We like sitting in the couch room and their wallpaper drew me to the room the first day  when we were sitting near the roadside window table. 
The ambiance is nice, cricket during IPL timings and music not too loud. We have never encountered big groups of people chatting loudly and always find this place very quiet and suitable to have a nice long conversation.
We have had pizza on our earlier visits, so this time we decided to go for something else and ordered Stuffed Chicken Breast.
The chicken was not so soft but the taste was good. Came with garlic bread. Overall, okay-ish. 
The pizza here is nice, soft and tasty, thin crust, generous amount of cheese and toppings,quite pocket friendly and big enough for two persons. Worth trying.So is the dessert. Had baklava and Rabri on choco mat. Both were good. I would go back for more pizza, juices and shakes and desserts.
The food, ambiance,polite staff and decent pricing has helped this cafe be my next potential hangout place.

Finally!! 
I walked in here today at around 4 in the evening. The place was empty which was expected given my timing. 

I was greeted courteously by a female staff and we chose our seats. 

We were immediately handed our menus but I already knew what I wanted to try here, and it was a matter of scratching off some of the dishes as we were just two and my mom was in no mood to eat anything then :c

Anyway, my mum ordered a watermelon juice for herself and I ordered flat and furious potato and pizza exotica. For takeaway we ordered veg classic pizza and gratin. 

The juice got served at first and I felt they could do better with the quantity. However, it tasted fantastic. The juice was fresh and it didn't have water- just the way I LOVE it. My mom loved it too. 

The starter came a little after that and my mum refused to have it and I had to gobble down it all by myself. This particular dish however, was a disappointment (maybe I say this after the overdose of it.)
It is basically fried thin slices of potato dressed with onions in red chilli powder and cheese and yogurt dip. 

The pizza took time to be served and it was just the best among all. However, I removed the pineapples from it. (Note to self: add other toppings the next time. )
It was cheesy and the crust was just perfect. 10/10 for the pizza. The best part however was the olives that was served along with oregano and chill flakes. I've never seen people serve olives along with seasonings. I love olives and I bombarded my pizza with it. I even asked for more olives and the staff was too generous to give me. 

The classic veg pizza and gratin which we got back home tasted good too , specially the gratin. I usually do not like gratin but this was different than the usual. The gratin was served with crispy garlic bread & I loved the garlic bread ❤️

The only con I would say this place has is the ambience. It seems a little out of place and I feel the glass wall isn't that great an idea (because the passerby's stop by n stare inside which gets very awkward.)
Besides that, no other complaints. 
The staffs are sweet and courteous too and it isn't heavy on pocket. 
We paid ₹581+ tip for our late lunch.
OBVIOUSLY coming back for more.... And more... And some more! :D

Yet another visit to this place in 2 days!We ordered for a fresh lime sweet which was good,midsummer dream mocktail which was absolutely refreshing and tasty and the veg exotic pizza.Everything tasted good and the service good! 
Keep up the good work team one way cafe!Cheers 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------One way cafe is located in Chowringee. The cafe is divided into 3 sections, namely, the large area you see as you enter,a small coffee lounge and a conference room/banquet.On my first impression i found the place to be done neatly.We were seated in the lounge area,though i was disappointed there.It looked like the lobby area of an office,the sofas seemed so formal.Maybe they should work up on it.Also it was brightly lit unlike how lounge's should be. 
Anyway, we ordered 4 things:
-> tropical delight:It was a refreshing drink with excellent flavours of banana,mango and pinnapple juice,however it missed the coconut as the description claimed it would contain.Nonetheless was very good.
->Cottage cheese herbed finger-It looked like mini paneer tikkas,with paneer,onions and pinapple.A little on the sweet side coz of the pinnapple and honey dressing but was grilled well.Great starter.
->Mushroom and broccoli skewers-It was excellent,from the mushrooms to the broccoli, to the herbed rice as side and that sauce accompaniment was very good. 
-> Exotic pizza- It was very good,not too saucy,not too cheesy,correct balance, good crust,considerable portions for 110 bucks!WIN WIN :D Also they served the pizza with dried oregano, chilli flakes and black and green olive slices complimentary :D wooh 
Presentation wise and taste wise the food won me over. 
The service was fast though the server kept pestering us to order and order.But otherwise good service,they followed our request to dim the lights a little to give a lounge like feel. 
Total bill was 515 only! 
PROS: The food- this place scores the most on the food end,great presentation of food,good menu,decent pricing.
CONS: Lounge area should be improved ambience wise,they shut at 10!Too early. 

Overall a good experience, i shall visit soon to try more stuff and yes desserts too!

This place has a great ambience & the food there is really good. I am very pleased with their presentation styles and their newly developed dishes. Though its given Rs. 500 for 2, there is a slight pocket pinch for the food. But I would say if you want good food you ought to pay for it!! :)

Went back again for lunch! Sat in the lounge this time and it was sooooo cozy...
Ordered for the following:
- Lemongrass vegetable soup (Yes, again and again, every time!)
- Cottage cheese herbed finger
- Veg thai curry with rice
- Cappuccino
Verdict - super awesome again!! The cottage cheese melts in your mouth & I am not a fan of paneer but I couldnt stop myself from a second serving.
A special mention for the Coffee, very lovely fragrant coffee!! I had mine without sugar....



----- 26 Mar, 2014 -----

There is just one word to describe the experience - Insane :)

Discovered it about 2 weeks back and already been there thrice! It's just a couple of buildings away from my office.

Pros:
- Lovely seating, neat, clean & spacious
- Courteous staff
- Interesting menu
- Amazing food
- The price, it's surely a joke! Sooooooooo pocket friendly!!

Cons
- Can’t think of any :p

They have the most awesome thin crust pizzas, I’ve tried both the classic veg and exotica. The lemon grass soup is out of this world. The spaghetti aglio olio is yummy. The prawn tempura just superb!!

Will keep going back again and again :D

'One Way Cafe', a newly opened coffee shop cum contemporary food joint near the Birla Planetarium having a special coffee lounge, conference and banquet, interactive kitchen and mocktail bar boasts of its contemporary European ambience friendly way of service,pocket friendly prices,and i found the interactive kitchen sets it apart from other joints.

The last saturday we discovered it while our way back home,and ended up having a sumptuous dinner.
our orders were :
- stuffed chicken breast (chicken breast stuffed with mushroom,cheese,onion and served with layonnaise potato)
Its a must must must try here! the cheesy brown sauce and the oddles of cheese and mushroom stuffed in the breast of chicken was one of the finest delicasies i have had ever!
- spagetti bolognaise (minced mutton cooked in tomato parsley along with spaghetti)
It was lip smacking good! worth recommendation as well
Both the maincourses came with 2 pieces of garlic bread each.one can even opt for rice instead.
- a non veg wrap (grilled chicken shredded mushroom,onion and cheese )
This was a let down after the former two super impressive dishes. the size of the wrap was pretty small, seasoning was not properly done, the shredded chicken just tasted bland and the main ingredient it lacked was cheese! that is the reason it missed out its full on 5 ,on the first chance.the wrap was accompanied with french fries and a salsa dip which again tasted awesome!
However, the cheff is doing a brilliant job, the stewards are well trained, and the introductory prices for the food is just a steal

one evening walking lazily through the footpath near birla planetorium ,i bumped onto a signboard feauturing some continental cuisines . then i saw this deli. Simple clean and neatly decorated. i was quite surprised , that i failed to notice such a huge deli while passing several time ,through the road.

now i was hungry, may be not that hungry but the listing of the items made me hungry.so i decided to raid the place. From this point onward i was greeted with repeated shocks. 

1stly they are really big for a deli
2ndly they are too neat and the roadside table gives an awsome feling
3rdly their menu lists some of the unique items
 finally their price. i thought may be they are joking

the waiters are really polite and it seems they really love their job. such a nice guide through the menu describing every item,it's taste. they are just a blink away,to serve you with proper cutlery or time to time refilling of water.This is really one of the best point the deli has. 
 now i ordered an item of 

grilled chicken breast stuffed with mushroom and cheese . this was really a treat. it was served with white and dark sauce . the extra serving of garlic bread made it an all time favorite food of mine. the chicken was soft and juicy ,packed with molten cheese.
 

a non veg wrap with chicken cheese mushroom was my 2nd choice. though the outer layer of the wrap look pale,but taste-wise it was flaw less. the perfect combination of all the spices, timely and richly cooked,added with perfect sauces gave it the drooling taste.

then came the baked cheese cake. the mouth watering taste of the cheese cake always make me go crazy. i am in loss of words to describe it. just to say that i have already started drooling while writing this short review for ONE WAY.

and after all this the bill rounded upto 500 bucks with taxes and etc.
