Very bad service and food not good at all...the chicken item was not having trace of salt at all... not many people visit and the Waiter has to call for customers standing outside the restaurant just like hawkers.

We went there for a dinner. The place is pretty okayish given the location. We took the upstairs dining place. The food was not very so special but it was nice and the quantity is good too. Not that great service but does their part for you.

Well I have visited this place a long time ago actually..somehow never thought it can have a mention in Zomato. So it was noon time..I was hungry,and wanted to have bengali lunch. So nearby I found this one...small but nice and clean place. We had steamed rice,mug dal,alu posto,rui ma6er jhol...and murgir jhol. Food arrived in time. Each and every item tasted good..the dal was gd in quantity and not watery like other resturants. Alu posto tasted gd. Rui ma6er jhal was made just like home..as well as murgir jhol. Not too much oily or spiced up. You can surely gv this place a visit..nxt time I am going to try their chinese and north indian dishes. ðŸ˜Š

Very recently, we had a lunch party there, the food was really good. The ambience was nice. Any time u vist there,  don't miss the " chicken breast cutlet", you can't stop ur fingers without swallowing.

Well their combo meals were at unbelievably low prices. The dum Pulao-chicken kasha deserve special mention, so does the cream soup. Other dishes were average. Quite a little find to satiate your hunger-buds, amidst the congested market place.
