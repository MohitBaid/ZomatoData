I have been to this place twice....the first time I tried chicken biryani while the second time I tried roti and chicken chaap....
In my opinion the chicken biryani was good and delicious but I didn't like the chicken chaap.....
Overall it is a good place....

Being a regular of this joint I cn say they do hv one of the best biryani in the area.. The price is highly pocket friendly.. Nd a must recommended place if u wnt to hv a good biryani & chaap dt too with a budget.. Nt recommending this fr dine in bt fr take away or delivery only.. Chinese dishes r a bit oily bt other than dt tandoor dishes nd biryani is good..

the owner of this restaurant does not know how to deal with customers.. i had ordered a baby corn the price on zomato was 100 but he sent a bill of 120  do i called him only to say that i was going to pay as per what the menu card said and in return he started abusing me .... the baby corn quantity was also very less and i tasted a piece it was disgusting and at the end after the conversation he asked me to return d food and said that one less sale wouldnt effect his shitty reastaurant.. so i guess they shuld close down!!
and i have to rate 1 cause there is no option for lower rating!!

A ok-ish restaurant. The food quality is above average. Chicken and Mutton biryani both are nice. The only good thing about the restaurant is its pricing. Chinese dishes such as Chowmein(all types) are also good. The sitting place isn't good.

Good food at good price. Near to my home. When we think of a biriyani party but budget is low then we run to this palace. Chinese food is also very good of this restaurant. You can give it a try.

Sumi's kitchen is located just by the side of SBI - Bakultala Branch.It is mainly a take away counter with a small four seater arrangement inside a cramped space.
Like any other kiosk they have the variety of rolls, some ordinary tasting Chinese dishes and some very tasteful Biriyani which is priced extremely competitively. Rumali roti is also available which along with Biriyani is one of the main attractions of this outlet.Between Chourasta and Bakultala over Biren Roy  Road, this is the only outlet that sells rumali roti. The rating is all for the Biriyani.

Well if you are thinking of quantity and fairly good quality in low budget this is a good place. The service they offer is not too fast, not too slow. Good for take away, not at all good for dining there. And if you are treating guests, don't take the risk.

The quality of food had been mediocre but recently it has taken a turn for the worse. We used to order quite frequently but now the food is just inedible.  The biryani is nice but anything other than that on the menu is just a great big OIL-FEST. Had ordered a moghlai but all we got was an unstuffed square papad like paratha.  The same goes for home delivery.  Whether you order rolls or biryani the minimum delivery time will not be less than 1 hour.

Have had Rolls and Biryani numerous times and although the food is nothing special, you get what you pay for. :) Just one point, the cooking area is really dirty. :(

Rate is very low, food is good pricewise. U can have biriyani in 70 rupees. Nothing is special other than this. U will get chicken chap here, I didn't taste.

Its a small shop beside bakultala state bank. It is famous for its biryani at a very affordable price. However, there quality of biryani has fallen now a days, they need to improve. I have tried other item from them. They are not that great.

The only thing I have tried here is biriyani and I liked it. It's average but I go almost every week to get their biriyani. The catch here is you get a pretty good amount of average chicken biriyani for 60 bucks. And it's worth it.

Probably the cheapest biryani i have come across....have tried their biryani thrice...quantity was enough..it was well cooked.. I have no idea about the other items. The biryani obviously wasn't perfectly flavoured if you wanna compare it to some big shops but considering the price,its totally worth giving a try.

To have biryani at a very cheap rate, visit this place. It is at bakultala opposite the SBI bank and Classic laundry. I haven't had any other food here so can't comment. But the biryani is good (not great though) than other food joints at behala who charge double the price than it.

Pls don't ever think of ordering from this place.A fews days ago we ordered for chicken biriyani and chicken chaap for our sudden guests.The person taking the call clearly seemed disinterested but still we received on time.But even though the biriyani was so so,the chicken chaap was stale.No one could eat.We had to meet the crisis by ordering from Manjil.We avoided any fuss just to consider it as an unintentional mistake.We thought that just to keep the competition with a nearby restaurant Afreen,they opted for a price slash,and hence compromised on quality.
Today,since manjil was closed for puja,we had to again call Sumis kitchen to cater to some guests.My father ordered for kebabs and with all gentleness just asked to be a bit more careful with the quality.And God!How the man on the other side of the phone misbehaved!!He abused my aged father ,blamed him to be a liar on the lookout of a free treat.We were shocked!Just wanted to share this inhuman behavior with all u foodies.I wud like to rate in NEGATIVE.

All the items here are reasonably priced & are extremely tasty. My special recommendation for this place is its Dry Chilli Chicken; its awesome. Also most of the famous Biriyanis have a side-effect which is acidity, but to my surprise this place`s Biriyani has no such effects & is very delicious.
