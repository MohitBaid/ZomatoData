The service was a bit too slow on a Tuesday evening. The ambience was good! Initially we were served something we didn't order, however it was nice of them to rectify it and give us what we actually ordered. However this took a loooooot of time! The food and coffee tasted quite good.

Visited this café due to the sudden urge to have hot chocolate! Located close to the Gate no 2 of Shyambazar metro station, this place is small but very pretty. Didn't order much, just a hot chocolate and croquettes. Both were awesome. Planning to visit it again for trying out the burgers. Check out the photos to see the interiors!

Ok 1st of all let me inform you this place is not much about food delicacies, it's more of the ambience, the atmosphere. I mean a typical north Kolkata cafeteria, Tagore, Manna, Salil Chowdhury playing in the background,you cut off all the shyambazar 5 point crossing jazz, build one or two Jenga towers, or dive into some penguin classics over a coffee,or may be grilled sandwiches or fries. And the best thing about them is they never rush you for the bill. When it's less of a coffee and more of memories, coffee o'kobita will always be among my top picks.

Overwhelming experience. Ambience was just perfect and aptly go with the name. The wall decorations, Book shelves, ancient cameras, Drawings, pictures of famous writers, poets &personalities will definitely make u nostalgic. 
Coming to the food, ordered chicken grilled platter & cheese corn mushroom sandwich - too good in reasonable price. And lastly cold coffee with ice-cream complete my day. 
Service was also excellent. The calling bell facility in every table is a smart step. Behaviour is polite & friendly. 
A cute small restaurant like this can change your mood & the taste of north Kolkata with nostalgia can be enjoyed thoroughly. Lastly I must say "তোমাকে চাই"

Situated beside shyambazar metro.  The ambiance of the 1st floor is really admirable  the walls are decorated with pics of old Kolkata, have many bengali books & camera.  The best part is they will not disturbing you unless you call them to ask for the bill.  Each table is provided with a calling bell.  The food was not extra ordinary but it was good.

A very cute, little cafe beside shyam bazar metro gate 2. Go straight to the 1st floor seating area and you will find yourself amidst a peaceful and typical north Kolkatan ambience. The walls are decorated with pictures of old Kolkata and of famous Bengali personalities. Many bengali books mainly of the feluda genre are neatly kept on shelves for reading. Apart from books, there are few other arrangements to entertain you while you wait for the food. The best part is they will not keep on appearing at your table to make you place the order quickly or will not disturb you unless you call them to ask for the bill. Each table is provided with a calling bell and the waiter will come only if you press the bell. Coming to the food, we ordered Earl grey tea, cold coffee with ice cream and grilled chicken platter. All the items were really good . Do try their grilled chicken platter, really delicious. Price is okay with respect to the quality of food and the ambience. Will certainly visit again .

In love with this place. Though the food joint is small, it's nicely decorated and has a nice ambience to it. It's a great place for hangout. We had stayed there for three and a half hours and in between that time we had our food, read a story book and played some games. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves there. Now coming back to food, all the drinks were nicely prepared. My fav being the virgin mojito and milkshake with choco strawberry ice cream. The grilled chicken sandwiches were properly grilled and the cheesy creamy pasta was literally too creamy. The one dish which didn't go well with me was the grilled chicken drumsticks. They tasted horrible. Other than that the servicing was good too.

This is an unexpected place to be found at the heart of old and traditional north Kolkata!!! It's a nook just beside the metro station where you can take a brief respite with your loved one or a group of friends after a long day. The ambience and decor stands out...it's neither grand nor quirky! But the scrabble,the guitar, the books,the game of chess...all open for access give you a sense of comfort.You can actually make a lot of bondings happen over a cup of coffee here. Food is good too. I love the place.

This is one of the rarest places which stands out for its service. Well, I have visited the place only once and may be the service boy who was in charge of my table did his job exceedingly well. He correctly guided me about what I should opt for and what I shouldn't. I had Cheese Corn Mushroom Sandwich, Fish Orly with Finger Chips, Earl Grey Tea and Cold Coffee With Ice Cream. Sandwich was undoubtedly one the best sandwiches I have ever had. Fish Orly was not that impressive, I would ask the future customers to go for Fish Fingers, as Basa goes better with that. Cold Coffee was ordered on the recommendation of the attendant, and certainly the amount spent did not go in vein. As a whole it is a perfect place for a high tea with friends.

Its divided into two parts, one part centers around old generation art and music and the other part is based on the creation of new generation artists. The food is great, staffs are courteous. The food & decor of the place will just make you happy.

Visited this quirky cafe today and was simply awestruck by the interiors.The 'Ray'trospective wallpaper/prints,shelves decked with sonku and feluda went really well with the north kol surrounding s. We ordered grilled chicken platter,Oreo shake and cold coffee with ice cream.All were in generous amount.The ordered mushroom pasta in veg sauce tasted fine except for the fact that this was more of a broccoli pasta.Hence,a bit disappointed.Hope,the dishes will soon match the decor.

So this place is located just beside the shyambazar metro gate numbet 2. This place is really cozy and comprises of two floors. The decoration is based on old Kolkata which will make you nostalgic which comprises feluda books games like Chinese checker and also decorated with ancient models of camera which do not even exist now. The decor is really colourful and vibrant. Coming to the food i ordered hot chocolate which cost 100 bucks but it didn't met my expectations and it was not worth the money. Then i ordered the coffee o kabita special cheese chicken sandwich which cost for 130 bucks and it was definitely worth the money because the taste was very good and the quantity was also very good. Then the next item was chicken drumstick which  cost 250 bucks , was quite good . The chicken leg peices were quite satisfying so as the mustard and mayonese dip and the hot french fries were also very good. Overall good existence.  The staff were very attentive and quick.

Not many options were there once in Shyambajar area for cafes and restaurants except the Golbari. In recent times a lot of restaurants have come up and most of them are pretty good. Coffee o Kobita is a small cafe located right near Shyambajar 5 point crossing. Cozy and nice interiors with ground floor seating arrangement for 8 people. The decors give an old Kolkata literary feel with books stacked on shelves and paintings drawn on the walls. Coming to the food,  the quality and taste are splendid. The fish and chips were very good with two large portions of fish fries, French fries and coriander and curd dips. The fish fries were nicely cooked and tasted lip smacking. So were the dips. Coffee was ordinary though, with too much milk. The waiting time is quite long even for a simple cup of coffee. The staff and the floor manager were quite congenial. The seating arrangement is cramped with almost no floor space. On most evenings its housefull. A good snack-experience overall.

Visiting this place was a sudden walk-in after coming out from the metro station. Decor wise would say nothing out of the extraordinary.A small joint with very little space.They also have place to sit upstairs.
But when it came to food ,it was amazing. Ordered Hot chocolate, Chicken cheese sandwich,chelokebab.
All of these tasted awsome. Quality wise was also good,easy on the pocket. Overall this place is a complete discovery in itself with so much to offering quickbites & few meal items. I would say the chelo kebab tasted better than the one in Petercat.

Coffee o Kobita, located just near the Shyambazar metro station gate, is an easy find and surely a worthy one.
We were unsure when a friend suggested the place but to our surprise, Coffee o Kobita turned out to be way more awesome than what we found on pictures. A really cool place to spend some leisure time with friends or family. They've got some good collections of books, games...I really wish people didn't misplace items after using them. Oh the queen and some pawns were missing. :/
Nevertheless, the food was a great accompaniment to all the chats and gossips.
Our order went like this:
• Special C O K cheese chicken sandwich: Comes in 4 pieces. Quite tasty with loads of chicken. What else do we want anyway! Can serve 2 people (4/5)
• Chicken pasta in white creamy sauce: This was in my mind since I saw the guitar shaped dish on Zomato. The taste was even way more good. Quantity was satisfying. (4.5/5)
• Fish Orly n chips: Why do they serve fries for chips! But since almost all restaurants around do that...the french fries however lacked salt. Fish was pretty good. Wouldn't really recommend that though. (3/5)

Having stayed for a really long time, I guess I liked the ambience a lot. Will surely visit again. I wish I could stay all day. ❤
Loved the place. Have recommended it to almost everyone I could by now. :')

Right outside the shyambazar metro gate towards R G Kar hospital you find this treasure for the college students. It's a great place to chill with your friends ,indulging in long 'addas'. I have been here twice. The place is basically a flat turned into cafe. I loved the quirky decor of this place.. It truly depicts the 'intellectual' culture of the Bengali society. There are a lot of games available too with Feluda theme decor. Also the bookshelf has Feluda Novels. The service by the staffs out there is amazing . They give you a good amount of privacy. They serve amazing Cold Coffee which also has added Oreo chunks, the pizzas are tasty as well . Also the  virgin mojito is pretty refreshing though the quantity is a lot. Overall I feel it's a highly recommended cafe in North Kolkata..with a good location and great place to spend time with your pals. I rate it 4.0 cause I feel it's a tad bit overpriced.

Extremely popular among the teens and one of the most visited cafes of North Kolkata. 
~Location-This cafe is near shymbazar 5point crossing. 
~Look and Feel- it's a small cafe which attracts a considerable amount of interest by the college students . There are well known colleges nearby which makes it an ideal place for hanging out.  The prices are really low and you can enjoy a sumptuous meal along with some great company. The cafe walls have beautiful graphical rerpresentation of calcutta.
~Food- 
* chicken sandwich- the sandwich was yummy . Had a good filling inside and the presentation was good .
* chicken pasta- the guitar shaped serving bowl makes it really attractive . The white sauced pasta is really heavy and quiet yummy. 
~Service- the food was served in no time and the staffs here are really kind and humble.
~Pocket pinch- it's a student friendly cafe which makes it really affordable for all it's young customers .Overall this place is a great cafe to visit when you are in North Kolkata.

The menu consists of a variety of continental and cafe food.  We had chicken cheese wrap,  grilled fish platter,  chicken drumstick platter,  chicken shaslik.  The food was quite tasty.  I would recommend chicken shaslik and chicken cheese wrap.

This was my regular place to hangout or complete work meetings when I was near shyambazar. The cafe is beside the shyambazar metro station is a favorite one for all bengali's. The menu is similar to all other cafe , but their preparation is really good . Most of the time I tried their cold coffee with ice cream or cappuccino and their egg cheese sandwich. They are the perfect choice for some snacks or a titbit while you work or give adda with friends. The service is good and timely. The place is small and can sit about 4 r 5 groups. But their decoration and their ambience are the most important thing of this place. It is decorated with old bengali charm mainly highlighting the bengali literature and their culture. The cafe ihas racks of books which you can read and the walls are painted with small poems , wellknown poets and writers and some funny and popular comic characters. While entering there is a wall where you can write poems of your choice even comment about the cafe.This is the best part of the whole experience. The music is soothing and overall a great place to visit with friends. The prices are reasonable and within pocket limit .

The decor is interesting. Very instagrammable to say the least. However there's a need to improve on the taste quotient. Had chicken lasagna and a grilled chicken shashlik served with rice. Lasagna looked good, but beyond the top layers of cheese and white sauce, the sauce beneath was a bit bland and watery. A creamy sauce and a cheese crust baked till it attained a golden hue would have made the lasagna delicious. Shashlik was honestly disappointing. Was expecting a lot more flavours. The rice didn't smell much of saffron as promised by the menu. 
Cafes serving continental food in North Kolkata is a rarity. This cafe has potential, boasts of a beautiful decor, the price is reasonable, but taste wise was expecting more. Hope the management takes this as constructive criticism and tries to improve so that the next time I visit I have a better experience.

Considerably underrated a place!
If you're a resident of North Kolkata, this cafe is everything you've been looking for, to spend a nice, long evening casually browsing poetry and sipping on hot chocolate!

It's been a week and I've already gone back for the pasta, twice. Situated just ouside the main exit of Shyambazar Metro Station, it's an extension of Mr. Burger, but this place is complete in itself.

The Grilled Chicken Platter will leave you licking your finger tips every now and then.
The Chicken Pasta is a saviour on evenings you just want some spicy, cheesy delicacies.
The Cappuccino is refreshing. They really know what they're doing.

I'd also like to recommend the Fish Orly and chips because it's not overtly oily and the sauce is great.

Pocket pinch is next to nothing and they have GST but it's a good time guaranteed.

Heard about it quite a few times and then atlast haf the chance to visit. The ambience is good. Cuttings and posters from satyajit ray's movies and books of Satyajit Ray on the shelves gives it a special feel
Ordered:

1) Darjeeling tea - The tea was NOT at all good. I dont think it is darjeeling tea. It smelt of smoke and the leaf quality was not good. Even Just Baked is better not to speak of Mrs Magpie or Mud (1.5/5)

2) Virgin mojito- My friend said it was good. So it must be so. I didnt taste it... So giving it 3.5/5

3)Cheese chicken sandwitch - It was good and munchy and enough fillings. (3.5/5)
The staff behaviour is good as the service was good (3.5/5)

Beginning of December we finally decided to visit this cafe situated in Shyambazar. It was a sunny cold Saturday morning and we wanted to start our day with a cup of coffee. 

Cafe Coffee O Kobita has been highly recommended by many a friends who have visited it. We entered an old building where this was located. A Tiny cafe with a seating arrangement of only a handful of people. The decor of this place is portraying the essence of the north Calcutta. 

We looked at the menu card and it offered a wide variety of soft drinks and Beverages. We opted for two cups of coffee and a chicken pasta in white sauce to start the day. The food was good & quick .  

Ambience- 4/5 
Food - 3/5 
Staff management- 4/5 

Would recommend everyone to visit this place at lest once.

Beautifully decorated.

Good quality and quantity of food.

Pocket friendly.

Live sports screening.

Warm behaviour from the staffs.

Fabulous DIY.

And, books.

The word "coffee" goes with the "book" pretty well right?

A perfect place for intellectual people. This is what they say. :)

It is just some seconds walking distance from Shyambazaar Manindra College.

A perfect place to go with friends. 

We ordered -

1. Lavazza Cappuccino
2. Bar-B-Oued Chicken Sausage Pizza
3. Grilled Drumsticks

The Drumsticks were mouth watering. The pizza was cheesy enough. The Cappuccino was good too.

A very small cafe near shyambajar 5point crossing. Just beside the titan showroom. Since the place is small one may not have any privacy or nice good time. They have plenty of good books to pass your time. It's generally good for hangout with friends and all. Foods were very nice in taste and staff behaviour is also polite. We had Oreo milk shake. One chicken and one fish item. All were perfect in taste. Recommended for mostly students.

This place is a good, small cafe on shyambazar, a first of its kind in that area.

Decorated with newspaper cuttings of famous events of the city and about the Feluda series, this is a small wonder!!

They have burgers, pizzas, fries, shakes and coffees, pastas and what not!!

We tried their fish and chips and hot chocolate.

The hot chocolate was unimpressive but the fish was good and very filling, although it can be less spicy.

Pocket pinch is very affordable!!

This place has become one my favourites over these few months . Everything about this place is so good.
Be it the ambience,the behaviour of the staff, the food or the feeling of nostalgia that this place holds.
We can't hold this place to be one of the themed cafés but it pays a tribute to long lost artists and their works.
Old nostalgia fills the place. And anytime to visit this place is a good time.
I would highly highly highly recommend this place to everyone who is searching for good food within a reasonable price and the ambience and the nostalgia is a bonus that comes along with it.
I have tried almost everything on their menu. The pasta that make both veg and non veg is the best. You can give special recommendations to them on how you would like your pasta. Trust me it is the best.
Even the veg croquettes and their Cappuccino. The grilled chicken platter is to die for. 
Even if I have worked my way through the menu I would like to visit this place again and again  coz I have made way too many memories here during this time period.
Highly recommended place.

Wow! Just wow! A Feluda and Ray themed cafe. Wow!Friendly staff. They have different rooms. Hence they offer a bell on the table. When you plan to order something, just press the bell and a man will come. However, the man is not very familiar with the items. So you must indicate the 'item number' also for the correct order. There are plenty of books by Ray which you can freely take and read while at the place. The decoration is fantastic. Food and drinks both are quite good. Prices are reasonable.

The cafe has a pleasant environment for the perfect ‘adda’ with friend(s). The coffee was good, we weren’t really satisfied with another chicken item that we ordered but then you can’t judge the food of the place with just one starter item. The place takes us back to the nostalgic era of Satyajit Ray and his films, and was overall worth the visit.

LOCATION-just beside shyambazar metro gate no.2, according to communication it is very good.but,if you want to see the sky and enjoy the rainy weather,it gives you totally disappointment.                                      AMBIENCE-clostrophobic.sitting arrangement is not so good.basically,it's not a big room.its a flat like 2room,which they turns into restaurant,but the overall decoration is appreciable.typically Bengali ambience.they use specially Satyajit Ray book for decoration.
 STAFF-they are polite,but they did not know about the dishes.if you ask something,they give you wrong information.                                                                             FOOD-they did not give you many variety.but they surely give you mouth watering dishes.we ordered  caramel custard,grilled chicken platter and grilled chicken SASHLIK.quantity according to money not satisfactory.but the chicken quantity is good,well grilled.specially mention about there sauce which they serve with SASHLIK.you must try their custard,which is excellent.                                                    IF YOU TRY SOMETHING NEW,YOU MAY GO THERE.BUT,NOT HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

It's located beside titan showroom near shyambazar 5 point crossing and they consists of 2 floors, ground floor and 1st floor.

First of all, this cafe is close to my heart as it is a feluda themed cafe. Situated just beside Shyambazar metro station Cafe Coffee o Kobita has a lot to offer apart from the Bengali nostalgia. We ordered cold coffee with icecream, fish fingers, chicken grilled sandwich. Coffee was really very good and they give a lot of chocolate and icecream within it. Fish fingers were served with herbed mayo which was the highlight of the dish. Chicken sandwich had ample quantity for two people and was served with French fries. Then we took muffin and cheese sticks and hot chocolate. Though we were not very impressed by their desserts , their all other items were very delicious that too in a moderate price. Looking forward to come back soon here.
Overall experience-
Decor- 4.5/5
Service- 4/5

We went there on Ashtami during Durga Puja, when we went to visit some Bonedi Bari Pujos out there and were craving for food. It is located near Shyambazar Metro, one of the metro gates is just beside this cafe. We had to wait for 10-15minutes, which is very less compared to the waiting lists at all the restaurants and cafes during Durga Puja in Kolkata. As I told, we were very hungry, so we ordered CHICKEN PASTA IN WHITE SAUCE, GRILLED FISH PLATTER, CHICKEN PIZZA, CHICKEN CHEESE SHASHLIK AND CHICKEN CHEESE SANDWICH. Food was really good. I loved the Grilled Fish Platter and is a must try. Chicken Cheese Shashlik and Chicken Cheese Sandwich was also very tasty. But after having Pasta and Pizza in some well-known places in Kolkata, I found these dishes over here to be okayish. It was not bad but not great as well. Well decorated place with a Satyajit Ray Theme. Friendly staff. Pocket-Friendly as well.

This place is quite near to my heart. Situated very near to my college and so much it has to offer.
First look, the place isn't that small as it seems to be from the outside, it has a first floor seating too. The décor is eye-catching with painted walls and pictures of music and poetry and film industry poineers. Board games and books are also there to get over boredom while the food is being served.
The staff are very courteous.
Seatings are comfy.
Coming to food,this time we ordered a chicken sashlik, a chicken lasgna, a fish meuniere ,cold coffees and caramel custard. All of the items were spot on. Can't get better than this at that price.
The price is worth it. It might be a bit pain in the pockets.
Will definitely recommend this place and ofcourse I'll keep coming to this place.

Dropped in with a friend to spend few hours. Firstly, the place is very easy to locate, just beside shyambazar metro. And also this is an extension of Mr. Burger, a well known cafe in shyambazar. This particular extension is very small with few seating arrangements. Tried few dishes, like silican chicken and blue curacco among the drinks, both were good and silican chicken needs special mention, a must try here. What came next was really disappointing. We ordered waffles with chocolate sauce which was one of the worst waffles i ever had. Too hard n chewy, so much so that we were not able to finish it. And after complaining to the waiter and the man in the reception, no one paid any heed to us, which is a really disappointing gesture. Wouldn't want to visit again.

I am basically from South Kolkata. And, never really went to the streets of North Kolkata nor even tried, any Cafe's there. But, this cafe was on my check list. And recently, I went there. One of my classmate accompanied me. Trust me, it was WORTH the wait.
You can try delicious platters, shakes and mocktails in your low pocket pinch. :) This cafe is a themed cafe, based on Satyajit Ray. And, you'll get those old Calcutta vibes because, it is situated in a very old building. :)

We Ordered, Grilled Chicken Shashlik Platter, Oreo Shake And Mint Mojito. ( NOTE - The menu which is given by the restaurant is the old one. They haven't yet uploaded the new menu).

• Grilled Chicken Shashlik Platter - It Contains Boiled Vegetables, Grilled Chicken Kebabs And Fried Rice. Overall the taste was good. Kebabs were mouth tempting. And rice was finely cooked. They also gave mayonnaise for the betterment of taste and for show as well. It is a good breakfast/lunch menu people can taste.

• Oreo Shake And Mint Mojito - I personally prefer sweets over anything. And trust me when I say that, the Oreo shake was not normal. It is way beyond tasty. You can't have enough of it. And the mojito, was normal like it should be. Not-so-sweet and Not-so-salty.
The Only Thing, where I am disappointed is - the service was a bit slow. (Probably because it was festive time and there was rush). But, otherwise the staffs are really polite and friendly. :) Have a Visit there. :)

Small but undoubtedly a good place. Not much budget friendly but value for money .
Few things I like the most about this cafeteria are,
first of all the peaceful ambience with a unique বাঙালী বাঙালী interior decoration makes it very charming for people like me,who find options other than ccd .

Now coming to the main part- Food !!
Well, I have ordered for
Cold coffee with ice cream - which was more than just upto the mark even in puja days! Perfectly blended.

Coffee o kobita special chicken sandwiches-
It was the best of three! Somehow very freshly made ,crispy outside and cheesy inside.
And that crunchy and juicy n creamy chicken filling made it perfectly appetizing!!

Grilled chicken chello meal- Consisting of
Garlic n parsley flavoured buttered rice,
One corn n potato cutlet with cheese in centre,
one chicken n cheese cutlet,
two grilled chicken breast in parmesan sauce,
one poach,
some sauted veggies & salad.
Oh anyway, I love the juicy chicken and the sauce it was sauted in!

And also not to forget about the service! Staffs are really good and very cordial.
For service I would really like to give them 5/5!😊

It is located beside shyambazar metro station. A nice place to spent hours with friends. I have been there for 4hrs and it was an amazing experiences. I absolutely loved the ambience. The service and the food both was utterly commendable. The nostalgic aura of the narrow yet clean lanes of the infamous North Calcutta is sure to add a tint of pink to your Coffee-o-kobita experience. However it is not one of those cafè's that is all posh and shiny but a must try for anyone whose an admirer of Ray family. Beautifully decorated and an ultimate place for feluda lovers because it contains feluda books and the series. The food is really very delicious. Must try is chicken sicillian and the cold coffee with ice cream. Even it contains a lot of games and the service rendered by the staff is also good. The prices are minimal so everyone visit this awesome place once at least.

Coffee O' Kobita has always been in my bucket list since its inauguration. In spite of being situated in a close proximity to my place, I couldn't tick off a visit for various silly reasons. Nonetheless, I visited this much talked about cafe today( Panchami, 2017). I was also accompanied by one of my college mates. Beginning with the entrance to reaching upstairs, you are bound to get the old world vibes. Needless to mention that the cafe is housed in a very old house of North Calcutta. The ambience is extremely cosy and will definitely arouse a homely affair. The nook and corners are etched with shelves full of books. Oh! Some handcrafted kettles are also kept for display. The archaic clock which hangs above the head will skate you down to the European grandeur. The wall posters are also filled with intellectual poems and images of the Satyajit Ray. The hygiene is also sound and appreciable. Well, the service is a little slow but the staffs are very courteous & polite. We chose to order Grilled Chicken Shashlik, Chicken Drumsticks, Strawberry Milk Shake, Chocolate Milkshake & Virgin Mojito(Mint).
The 1st dish was on the okayish side. The grilled chicken with the Mayo Dips were delicious. But, the rice provided with the 1st dish tasted slightly citric.
The 2nd dish was lip-smackingly sumptuous. The Milkshakes and the Mint Mojito also worked like a reliever on a soaring afternoon. Overall, it was a pretty good food escapade. Happy Dining! :)

Visited the place yesterday with a friend. The location is excellent.  People connected to metro can drop in easily.  There are 2floors.  Ground and 1st. The ground is comparatively small.  We ordered hot chocolate, tea,  French fries and sandwiches.  Sandwich was good and could be better.  The ambience was good.  You can visit with friends as well as family.  There are lots of books especially on "Kobita" and some games.  Nice place to hang out in the evening.

They have a wall magazine and in-house merchandise. The only thing they should add is free wifi. I loved the experience and will surely go back again.

This small and beautifully decorated cafe is a brand new sight in shyambazar and a very needed. It has two different rooms and the one we sat in was dedicates to bob marley. Why do i stress so much on ambience and decoration? Because other than food, the place matters a lot in affecting your mood. 
    Now coming to the food, we had ordered chicken platter which was really great and of quite a good amount. We also order grilled chicken sandwich which was really good too. We also had hot chocolate and virgin mojito. They added a new desert caramel.custard which i would really like to recommend to people. Overall its a good cafe and pocket friendly.

Being the only cafe so close to my medical college, it has been a life saviour. Our go to place on bad and good days alike. 

Location- Shyambazar five point crossing, right next to the Titan showroom and metro gate. 

Ambience- Very soothing. Good music in the background, vibrant colour, Bengali classics lining the wall and of course, the vintage camera collection. Modern Kolkata with a familiar touch of the old Calcutta. 

Food- On multiple occasions, Chicken Pasta in creamy white sauce, Fish orly and chips, Chicken sandwich, Chicken Shaslik

Drinks- Cold coffee, Cold coffee with ice cream, Virgin Mojito. The Virgin Mojito is very refreshing and a much needed cooler in this humid weather. The cold coffee without ice cream is better and comes with bits of Oreo too!

Desserts- Waffles. Only wish they had given it with ice cream! It was too sweet otherwise.

The best thing about this place is it's location just adjacent to the Shyambazar Metro, gate no. 2. The interiors need a special mention, given that the seating area is smallish. Once inside the café, walls and shelves dedicated to timeless Bengali poetry, song lyrics, photographs, books and board games will definitely make you feel at home. The menu too is budget friendly, and has a good variety too. Quality and quantity of the items served seem to be pretty good, their presentation takes the satisfaction a notch higher. It's a lovely place to spend some time relaxing with friends or even family.

This cafe is situated just adjacent to shyambazar metro, opposite to shyambazar mitra cafe. Interior decoration is poetic. One can easily feel the special vibe of this place which has a good appeal to intellectual people. Ambience is perfect for  hangout with friends but not so good for couple or lone dinners.
Service is bit slow and most of the waiters are not well-acquainted with the menu.
Now foods.
MOJITO, served in a nice mason jar, was pretty refreshing with tangy minty flavour.
PASTA: Tried one pasta in white sauce with mushrooms and vegetables. It was so-so as there were very little amount of mushroom and excessive white sauce.
SICILIAN CHICKEN: It was yummy. Very nice. Chicken is baked with white sauce. Went well with the garlic breads as add on.
CHEESE PAW: nice accompaniment with varieties of tea or coffee.
BURGER: This cafe is basically an extension of MR.BURGER, so it's worthmentioning that their burgers are one of the best.

A smart Feluda-themed cafe to enjoy intellectual Bong adda over some good food. Located right beside their Mr Burger cafe, the proper Coffee O Kobita is spread across the second floor. One can also sit downstairs but here the space is limited.
The interior is decked with quirky Feluda and Satyajit Ray art, series of Professor Shonku and Feluda novellas lined neatly on shelves, vintage cameras, coffee mugs, board games, comfortable chairs, with a soothing calm mellow music-filled ambiance.
Servers are polite and efficient. Service is also prompt. They visit your table once you press a bell provided at each table.
My friend and I gorged on the Chicken and Cheese Pizza and sipped the Virgin Mojito.
The pizza was good enough, freshly-made. The mojito served in pretty mason jars was very refreshing with a lemony minty flavour.
A nice little food hub adjacent to Shyam Bazar metro, to indulge in gossips, academic discussions or simply a friendly conversation accompanied with delectable continental snacks, beverages and desserts.
Also, do try their peanut butter and jam sandwiches which are totally yummy.

If you look for a perfect cafe other than CCD,  you have a good option for opting this one. Prices are not that reasonable and the quality of the food is good. In North Kolkata I can say one of the best cafe to opt for. 

If you ask for decor and ambience,  it is fair enough. Each section has different decor. Some with newspaper decor and some with tollywood movie poster decor.

This is a teensy cafe right beside Mr burger. It has a quirky decor, and lots of books and games to keep you company. I like their grilled chicken, fish Orly and fish meuniere. Do avoid their pizzas as the crust is awfully hard. The chicken Sicilian is good if you are in the mood for a cheesy affair. 
Another hangout place to get lost is some good old adda with a plate of tasty food.

Coffee House r shei adda ta aaj r nei...

This little casual eatery is housed in the first two floors of an old aristocratic North Kolkata apartment and hence the conventional architecture allows it little space which is why it is scattered within few small rooms with very less seating capacity and with tables placed so closely to one another that the chit chats of different guests are audible. This cafe also has glaring signs of modification that prove that this house has made terrible adjustments and revisions to accommodate this eatery; it also lacks a proper planning perhaps. However the initiators have put in a lot of effort to convert a typical North Kolkata residence into a food joint by an interior decor that tries to infuse art and intellect, through grafitties on walls and wall flexes full of quotations from song and poetry, iron racks shelfing books on poetry and music and indoor games.

Since this place claims to be a cafe, they allow lot of time for talks; the service is tremendously slow or even absent at times (The first thing they announced is their fish items aren't available. So with a very minimalistic menu, we were left with very less choices/options. They were very slow to take orders, didn't even offer water and came very late with the order delivery, even failed to serve the two orders together, gave no extra cutlery sets or plate - everything needed to be prompted) that makes me conclude that under the garb of a cafe feel they are actually wasting this place with utter unprofessionalism. The food sadly wasn't remarkable as well.

The owner of this place definitely had an innovative project in mind and a courage to introduce a continental cuisine culture in the heart of North Kolkata but I am afraid with lack of professionalism this place may soon lose its goodwill and all it will be left with is a feeling of an intellectual ambiance that is nothing but fake and simulated.

Coffee O Kobita and Mr. Burger, under the same management, both are situated adjacent to the Shyambazar metro station gate towards Baghbazar Bata.
The interiors are decorated with graffiti and collage refering to the famous works of intellectual Bengalis like Satyajit Ray, Sukumar Ray, Rabindranath Tagore, Kabir Suman and some more. They have done a good job in converting the ground floor and first floor of an old North Kolkata-house into a favourite hangout spot for young intellectual food lovers.
They serve only Continental - American/Italian -
Pasta, Pizza, Steaks, Lasagnas, etc. All extremely delicious! A wide range of coffee and mocktail is available, that makes this place a good cafe as well.
The options in dessert is limited to only doughnuts and waffles. They need to improve on this. Also instead of providing mashed potato with Steaks, they rather fry the potato into a hash-brown which did not turn out well. All said, I loved this place and will visit again!

Just opposite to mitra cafe , this cafe is located with ample seating arrangement and subtle decor. We ordered a chicken cheese pasta and two cokes. The pasta was loaded with generous amount of cheese but the amount of veggies was pretty less and the coke contained so much ice that the taste started getting bland after sometime. They also allow you to play the guitar . If you are in shyambazaar , you can try this place for some little chit chats :)

They have placed a bell on each table...so that u can call waiters for service without any inconvenience!

It offers u many board games like ludo, jenga ,rubik's cube and a lot of books!☺

On the menu ..they offer a lot of items..but fewer veg options!Food presentation is unique and tastes nice!Pricing is student friendly!😊
Overall a nice place to spend time/adda with friends/reunion!!👍

Well hi all, this review should have been posted few months back; apologies for the delay. Now when it comes to cafe coffee o kobita, I really had no clue what it was till my boyfriend discovered the place and wished to take me along. I was also keen for the visit as it would have been the first time I would have been meeting my newly found love. 
The first meeting at Shyambazar was followed by my first visit to this place with him, and I still feel the vibe. The place was all set up for the occasion I presume as we took a couples seat on the ground floor. He had to make the order on my behalf as I was too much occupied with what was going around me. Coffee, chicken sandwich along with some cold refreshments were ordered and time flew by in the speed of light. I know this review is becoming too emotional but I can't help it. The food, the ambience, the people attending us over the table were more than what we could have asked for. The price is surprisingly economic for a cafe in the heart of north Kolkata. 2 hours flew by at sonic speed and I crave to be back anytime sooner. 
Do bring your friends, better halfs, relatives and family members to have a great time.

Visited this place only once and I am already in love with the ambience. The place(upstairs as well as downstairs) is not a lot spacious may be but the setting and the interiors make it the ultimate hangout hub for the students and young people. The food is satisfying. The pizza, casserole, pasta and the wraps are worth trying. The hot chocolate and the mint mojito are amazingly refreshing. Very affordable which makes it even better a place for the students. However they need to work on their service. Overall the place is really cool and won't disappoint.

North Calcutta always had a lacking of a good cafe or a place where youngsters can hangout and have good food. This cafe has fulfilled that blank space successfully. Adjoined to Shyambazar Metro station this place is defintely the best one to spend quality time. While entering the poems,gift items will catch your attention. It has been set up specially to revive the bengali intellectual environment. I would suggest to go upstairs. They have different games to play and have a good collection of books. The decorations is so beautiful and nicely done. Ambience is perfect to spend the evening. Food is good too. I had Mocha Latte, Chicken Cheese Croquetts and special Chicken sandwich. Everything was good. This place is definitey worth a try and I promise even if you are alone, you will not be bored.

After visiting Mr Burger for the 100th time, Coffee O Kobita is refreshing with their extensive menu. The mushroom spinach and cheese casserole along with the triangular slices of brown bread with garlic butter and flakes was pretty impressive. But their lasagne is kind of a disaster with the entire concept of layering. Although the flavour was pretty average, the pasta sheets felt quite thick and pasty. On the same note, I'd rather prefer Mr Burger for the cold coffee due to the striking imbalance of flavours.
All in all, a good change with ample room for improvement.

Their pasta in white sauce is a must have dish and also, their Oreo shake... Today was my 7th visit there and the place, the staffs and the ambience never fail to satisfy my..

North Kolkata: Check
Shyambazar: Check
Nostalgia: Check

And each time I would return from a photo walk along the Ganges, the need for a coffee shop that would quench the thirst of a weary traveller was sorely felt. Till, Cafe Coffee O Kobita happened. This quaint little coffee shop spread over two floors, provides the dreamy Kolkatan with dollops of nostalgia. And at times they come in the form of an entire wall, plastered with Satyajit Ray and his creations. 
Cafe Coffee O Kobita, is not just a coffee shop, though the bean is one of it's highlights. It has a variety of dishes, including veg and non veg platters, to offer. However, the fish and chips needs to be savoured, before anything else. It is an amalgamation of the English past juxtaposed on the psyche of the gregarious Bengali. The service is a major highlight. They are efficient, prompt and courteous. The menu is a tad confusing, if you happen to be a thorough bred vegetarian. Every veg platter comes in with an omelette. However, while ordering that needs to be mentioned and it will be replaced. Our order too got messed up, because one of us was a pure vegetarian and the sight of the omelette did not sit pretty with him. It was changed and the faux pas apologised. 
If a quick bite is what you wish for along with some memories, come to Shyambazar. Sitting pretty right next to the Titan showroom Metro Railways opening lies one of Kolkata's best kept secrets.

Cafe Coffee O Kobita.

Love: Check and forever.

It's a newly opened cafe located just beside the shyambazar metro station. It's a flat redecorated into cafe, decorated with lots of feluda books, vintage cameras. Ordered chicken croquet, fish wrap, fish Orly and blue coracao. Fish Orly was best amongst all. There are couple of board games to play. Service is a bit poor.

An extension of Mr burger. Its ambiance is very charming and one can get infatuated with the decors. 
Coming to food. We ordered SICILIAN CHICKEN COMBO which was delicous and filling. Pocket pinch is economical.

This seems to be a start-up venture of the owner.. a tiny place with a typical north kolkata ambience - the building, the staircase, the wall graffiti, the music they play, everything basically... There wasn't any coffee place near this area earlier (except CCDs).. they even sell souvenirs, probably has a guitar - you can sing your own songs. The idea of writing down a kobita is also very nice. Good experience overall..

If you want to feel the real essence of Bengal while enjoying an afternoon adda with your friends, this is the ideal café to visit. Located just next to Shyambazar metro station, this café can be easily located. It is preferable to choose the first floor instead of the ground floor. The staffs are prompt and friendly enough. This beautifully decorated café is loaded with Bengali books and board games. So if you are planning to spend an afternoon with your friends over a game of jenga and a sip of coffee, you can definitely give this place a try!

The café is located just beside the shyam Bazar metro station. The interior decoration is so fabulous. It is a perfect place for a book worm specially who loved to read bengali story books... Besides they have lots of board games. A perfect place to hang out with your friends and cousins. Now coming to the food items.. we ordered Virgin mojinto, blue Curaçao & cold coffee with ice cream....each of them was awesome. The price is very pocket friendly... I would love to visit there again

This cafe is on the first floor of Mr. Burger of which it is a branch. It was very attractively decorated with wall art, bengali story books , board games , cameras. Music was on. So a big thumbs up for the decor and ambience. A cool place to hang out with friends.
We ordered Cold coffee, Chicken Pasta in white creamy sauce and Chicken Sicilian Platter. Taste was good. Nothing extraordinary. The quantity of the platter was quiet less for its price.
We played Jenga and had the best time.
Previously when I visited Mr. Burger , I had burgers which were really good. So my expectations were really high from this branch too. A bit disappointed with the food and it's quantity.

An extension of Mr. Burger with a larger space , better decor and an extended menu , the window side table for four is my favourite cozy corner apt for endless gosspis exchanging glances with the overlooking metro station gate . Last evening was drizzling and i loved spending​ few hours there . The food is fingerlicking good , served in few minutes and reasonably priced. We had SICILIAN CHICKEN COMBO that had chicken baked with mushroom in white sauce , four slices of garlic bread and a glass of soft drink. Our other two orders from Mr burger were CHICKEN CHEESE BURGER and GRILLED CHICKEN PLATTER , loved the former and the later could be somewhat modified , but value for money. I highly recommend trying the burgers from their kitchen , i bet these are cheapest and the tastiest ones one can get in the city.

Nice concept and cool interior decor. The place looks small but surprisingly will make you feel cozy. Go in with your best buds and have a nice afternoon revisiting old days and whatever that is on your mind. They even sell cards coffee mugs and notebooks which are cool and can be used for gift purpose. Do give this place a visit.

This new place in town is located just beside the Shyambajar metro statio. Beautifully done with good music and well lighted. The Calcutta charm has been added by the very bengali decor and songs.
Couldn't sit in the top floor because of the lack of staff but the food and company compensated for it.

Near shyambazar metro station , this cafe no doubt is one of the best places to hangout.
Price reasonable , nice ambience & service is good.
Ordered Cheese straw, Chicken pasta and Chicken-cheese corquettes.
Do try pasta here. 
Corquettes are one of a kind served with salad & mayo. 
If you want to try cheese straw please take@ a coffee or something. Otherwise you'll​ find these very dry and not so tasty.

Not only is it decorated with beautiful ambience based on arts,music and literature and also the food too is good.
Here I had ordered cold coffee with chocolate ice cream and a double decker cheese french toast..

The prices of the products are also pocket friendly....

This is a small cafe just beside the shyambajar metro station gate no. 2.. I have passed by this place many times but have never noticed it until today. My friend and I decided to have a quick check-in at this place to escape the summer sun and it was indeed a relief.. It's a small cozy place. The food is good, really delicious and lives upto the price indeed. I was impressed by their virgin mohito and cheese egg sandwich.. The sandwich was an absolute yum, no doubt.. I loved the way they served the tea.. This place is worth a try..

Never thought that the heart o North had something this exuberant to offer. Just beside the Shyambazar metro station, you will love this place. The décor n ambience just perfectly portray the tagline o this place which says, it's meant for hardcore intellectual adda loving bongs! Anjan Dutta to Bob Dylan, Kabir Suman to Jim Morrison, this place welcomes every era n genre. Now about the food. I cannot stop appreciating. They have a very limited number o recipes but whatever they make they make sure to serve you the best. Though I was expecting Pita breads when I ordered cheese chicken wrap but it was more o a roll. Still undoubtedly best taste in the area. Do check the pics!
I would love to recommend it to everyone.

This place is located near gate 2 of Shyambazar metro station. The place is cutely decorated and as the name suggests they do have books mostly poetry on small racks located above the seats. We ordered for chicken cheese sandwich, hot chocolate, cold coffee with ice cream and packed some chicken croquette. The sandwiches were well made. The hot chocolate was pretty good, cold coffee with ice cream was good. The chicken croquette were lovely. The staff is courteous and friendly. All in all a cute lovely nice little place. Ohh yes they have an extended seating arrangement above.

It has two outlets one at downstairs and one upstaris ... u will see most photos of upstairs and by chance if u go downstairs outlet not an issue, both are same... Now decor of the cafe very good, cozy chairs and nice ambience ... In main snacks we ordered for Chicken pasta in white sauce, Cheese chicken silician and in mocktails we ordered Virgin mojito and Blue cocoa ... Pasta was very good yummy n hot, also Chicken cheese silician was very yummy with less salt ... Now the mocktails were very good ... Now the behaviour of the restaurant staff was very good n nice ...

Located just beside gate number 2 of shyambazar metro station, this place would be an appropriate rendezvous for all the adda loving Bengalis. It is indeed unique in its fusion of trending cafe food and the old world, coffee house nostalgia. Coming to food, the place serves one of the most amazing fish and chips I've ever had : the outer crust golden brown and crispy, the filling inside soft and succulent. We also ordered chicken and cheese croquettes, but considering that I had expected cheese to come oozing out of it, it was a bit disappointing. However, the beverages - cold coffee and virgin mojito - tasted nice. Honestly, I would go back again and again just for the fish and chips.

easy to locate,right opposite 2no gate of shyambazar metro.
the ambience,food,service everything is so perfect! we had cold coffee,chicken  pasta,chicken quorcoitte! 
the only con being,the menu.the actual prices  do not match with the one given on zomato.

Nearby at Five Point or having a rough day in the North, take a metro to ShyamBazar or a bus would even do. Located just near the Metro gate, this cafe saves your ugly mood ! Offering from a 'it'sreallygood-umm-yes-it-is' Chicken sandwich prepared in a handful of minutes, the craze for more is bound to linger. Order your shakes, the Oreo Milk Shake will slowly melt you off and you'll definitely wish to drop in for a quickie! The graphic ambience on the walls, the books of poetry alongside your munches is simply a delight for an evening.
Warm-pocket-friendly-nostalgia, what else do you wish for!

Coffee o Kobita makes one feel like that... A Very new and compact place, just beside Shyambazar Metro Gate-1. A Quiet place for long important discussions.
Ambience and appearance makes one feel "bengali"... The decor, Victoria Memorial, Howrah Bridge in single canvas looks tip-top...

Coming to the refreshment-
To be frank, had Cappuccino for the first time in my life and the experience was quite satisfactory actually! Mint mojito looked refreshing, so was its taste...
Price is okey-dokey...
Wish to show up again and explore more beverages and stuffs here...

The place is beside the metro station. It's owned by the same owner as Mr Burger. The place is a neatly done up cafe. It's really cosy and has seating of about 8 people. The menu is not much different from the one at Mr. Burger and they make awesome grilled sandwiches.  Not to mention their burgers. You can read my review of Mr Burger to get a better idea.

They make a great virgin mojito and it's like really refreshing .  Would love to be here again soon

Visited this place a couple of days ago. It was  an unplanned visit and surprisingly, I had never noticed this place, despite crossing the Shyambazar metro station area almost regularly. This is a pretty tiny coffee joint, with clean interiors and basic seating arrangement. The walls are done up with sketches depicting different idiosyncratic features of Kolkata, like the book fair, or Durga Puja. Also, there were a few bengali books (mainly poetry) which one can while away time browsing through. Towards the entrance, Coffee-o-Kobita signature mugs are on display which come priced at 200/300. It's quite clear that the coffee joint bears a quintessential Kolkata theme, complete with sketches, books, poetry and tea.

Food was quite good. We ordered two plates of chicken pasta with white sauce, and it was delicious. The pasta was priced at 150 per plate, therefore I would give them full marks for value for money. The pasta was provided along with the entire mix of condiments like pepper, oregano, etc. We wanted to order a cheesecake, which unfortunately, wasn't available that day.

Service was prompt too, and there's a single staff person behind the counter who is quite friendly. Definitely a visit, if you want to find a quiet place to hang out and talk over delicious food near Shyambazar 5-point.

Located just beside the Shyambazar metro station it's the new location that I had to visit . Looked pretty decent frm outside. We found the place to b small.nicely decorated with books and coffee mugs.
Inside I found it to be the twin joint serving the same menu as mr burger ,the one located just adjacent to it only that they serve coffee. I mean both mr burger and cafe Kobita serves each other's menu. So we had this mr burger grand meal which was a big chicken burger, fries and cold drink. Burger was awesome no dbt..
Overall I liked it

This place is just beside the Shyambazar metro outlet(the one beside the Titan showroom). Cafe and Kobita and Mr.Burger are just beside each other.

We had Chicken drumsticks which had four pieces of chicken served with 2 types of mayo dip and french fries along with salad. This dish was tasty. ❤
Then we had grilled chicken, which was served with boiled vegetables and mashed potatoes. This dish was okayish. 

Blue curacao among refreshment drink was alright too, nothing great. Milk shake with chocolate and strawberry ice cream was good. 😊
