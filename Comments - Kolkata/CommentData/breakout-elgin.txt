No greart ambience to be found !!
If you in search of a place for a peaceful date without much crowd and noise, this could be an option.
Hookah could be rated as (6/10) and food (4/10)
Well, u can get a hookah for just 200 bucks between 10am-1pm. Which is quite a handsome offer !!

Good place for Food. But not a good place for hangout with bunch of friends. A bit problems with space. Not so spacious. But again I say, food is great, pizza , pasta everything was awesome. Service is upto the mark. Thank you.

First of all, we visited this place just becoz of the hookah offer which has been running here since months. After reaching we just got to see that there were no staffs over there.Nobody gives a damn about why u are here! Finally i asked a guy( whom i had to wave like ten times) about the hookah offer about whther its still on or not. His reply was "the person who makes that hookah is absent today. So the offer doesnt count." But we can order the normal hookah worth 300/- I found this statement very unreasonable and hilarious.
How can someone make hookkah only for a specific range? And why is this place still quoting the *happy hours* till date when they  dont even hav one?
We just left the place because anyway the staff members didnt show up nor were they interested about any of the customers there.
Thankyou for wasting our time. Hope u get some service members soon!

I visited Breakout last month with my friends,so I had heard about a offer that they were serving hookah for just 99 rs in the noon so we decided to give it a try.
It is located in the lane opposite to Bhawanipur College on elgin road,as we entered the place was empty maybe because it was 12 in the noon,we decided to order the hookah (teen paan rose) along with veg burger and veg.cheese sandwich (they serve only vegetarian).After a little wait we got the hookah which was decent and the food items were also not bad they tasted good.The ambience was good with the lighting and feel of a particular hookah parlour with some background music and the service was quite good,the staffs were helpful and courteous.
The pocket pinch was low because of the offer.

I went there last month.The hookah for 99/- brought me there.It was a horrific experience. Whatever Mocktail we tried ordering was unavailable. We had to choose from the few available ones.Hookah was not good at all and the best part was that a cockroach was moving around near the table.

First, I would like to start with its actual history...it all started in February, 2015 with the game called PAINTBALL. It is a great success as people love to play this game and its fun! Trust me on this! 

Then a new addition they brought in January, 2017 for the people to relax after the game of PAINTBALL or just to chill out i.e. Shisha cafe. A simple and quite cafe to enjoy good shisha and tasty food. Prices are reasonable, pocket friendly as the owner out here want to built good relation with customers, instead of not only making profits. Do try this place out. If any complains, BREAK OUT is ready to rectify and send you home happily. Thank you :)

Descent place. Greak food for a descent price. The food is on the greasy but yummier side. Nice place to chill out with friends too. Definitely worth a shot
