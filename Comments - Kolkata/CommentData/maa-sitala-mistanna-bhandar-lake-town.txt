Visited here for some sweets. An ordinary sweet shop selling almost every thing that a bengal sweet store has. Sweets are good in taste.
Tried their Lancha, Rosogolla and Laddu. All were good.

Maa Sitala Mistanna Bhandar is a decent mithai shop serving a wide variety of sweets. It is quite popular among people living in S. K. DEV Road. Pricing is on the lower side.

This is an old sweet shop for mistilovers...
Basically people living near the tetultala ,lake town...
They are  my childhood star as I grew up with having lovely rasgullas and rasomalai.
Price is very cheap but the quality is great....
In lake town they have two outlets.

Never thought I can find even them in Zomato and will write a review for them.
This shop was my childhood friend as my born and brought up was in that area. My life changed a lot. I changed 3 diff houses after that. But still.. If I visit patipukur I try to buy some sweets from them. 
Their Misti Doi was very good. That can compete with any famous mistir dokan along with Amrita.
