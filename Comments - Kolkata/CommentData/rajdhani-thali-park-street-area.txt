Located at the heart of parkstreet .pure veggie delight. Went here with my family on 31st October,2017. Variety in dishes. From dal Bati churma, roti, dhokla, puri etc etc. Gulab jamun and jalebi at the end. For me it was not a good experience. I didn‚Äôt like their food. Service was good and fast. Ambience was good.

Oommggg so much of foodd.. Itss like flooding.. They will serve as if they are your real parents ü§£ü§£

It's a thali system so just pay the cost of a thali and enjoy unlimited food and unlimited courtesy of the staffs.. I bet they will force you to taste each and every item.. 

It's a visual treat and a very soothing experience.. Please do visit

Though I‚Äôm not a big fan of only vegetarian restaurant, but I have to admit that I completely loved the experience at Rajdhani Thali at Park Street. Se vice was very warm & almost caring, full of traditional rituals. Food was tasty, hot and served in no time. Great value for money.

Being a Jaipurian,,its the only place i can relate to in kolkata.. I feel like home there.. They welcomed us in a full rajasthani style with tilak and aarti.. The meal there is soo sumptuous.. Nd the pocket pinch is also reasonable.. Now i dont have to waste lots of money for a delicious meal.. Although its a thali,the food is unlimited.. And soo tasty.üíòüíòüëåüëå

This place makes you full, super duper full. Once you give the server green nod they will serve you and feed you till you die of over-eating. Super prompt and courteous services and the food is delicious. You will be spoilt for choices: what to eat and what to ignore and the quality of the food is up to the mark. Cosy, nice and really warm experience at Rajdhani and I would love to visit again.

Located in a very convenient place in Park Street.  Ambience is extremely nice & staffs are very courteous.  First u will be given hot water for washing ur hands & then they will start serving.  A total of approximately 20 dishes will be served,  all are very authentic rajasthani food. Only thing that bothers a bit is their superhuman speed so that u Cnt njoy really the food.  Amount is endless & as much as u can eat. Starter options were quite limited & not upto the mark. Rest assured u will be delighted specially in the dessert part. Highly recommended if u want 2 taste some brilliant veg foods.

Being a true non-vegetarian, vegetarian dishes don't please me much.But after my friend's request, we paid a visit to this Rajdhani Thali.I was quite excited as I have never had a Rajasthani thali earlier.
The place is beautifully decorated and the tables were set with thalis and small katoris.Coming to the food, there were sooo many dishes to try but I liked Gobi ki sabzi,dal baati Churma,khichuri,dhokla and samosa.
We were served with drinks which initially they didn't inform us that it was chargeable.
Overall it was a nice vegan experience.

A nice Rajasthani- Gujarati vegetarian restaurant, exclusive for their Thalis which are a spread for over 35 items from starters or farsaan to desserts or misthan. The best thing about this place is not only the food, the ambience which you get here is worth experiencing. They give you perfect Royal treatment from Aarti while you are entering and many more. Truly maintaining the words of "Atithi Devo Bhawa" . Everyone should visit this place atleast once just for the ambience and treatment we get.

coming to food it was delicious. the dessert of gulab jamun, jalebi with rabri, etc were yummy.

they have thali tuesdays which cost 250+ tax for each person. and for otherdays 450+ tax . 

Also you will never feel bored with this place as they change their menu and as the winter holiday season is here. They have added their Swaad Kesariya Menu, so it's a must visit.

Being a pure non-vegetarian and trying out a vegetarian restaurant is a difficult job but trust me the food tastes so good that i finished it all but the amount is huge like huuuugggeee. 
Since i and my sister went on a tuesday it was much much pocket friendly to us and costed only Rs 545 including all the taxes.

From entering till exit we were accompanied by their staff, and they were extremely professional along with being friendly. I was accompanied by my sister and they helped us get a calm and quiet seat. You don't even need to get up, they came to wash our hands in warm water. Then starts the thali arrangement. And it went on and on! They even call out the names of every item. We didn't feel we were at a restaurant but as if it was a wedding!üòÇ The food was served hot as well. The only thing is, I couldn't complete the thali. Long before I was full! Basically, you feel full as you see it!‚ù§

Anyone looking for rajasthani food at a reasonable price then this is the place for them , "Pura paisa vasool". Starting from the time we entered the restaurant till we left , the staff were really cooperative. Their service is amazing. They provide thali system , separate for each customer , where there more than 15 types of dishes will be served. Starting from dhokla , tikia , dal baati churma to different types of chappattis and dals , rice , rajesthani khichdi , custard , bundiya ka rayta and sweets. A must go place for people who love veg food.

I visited Rajdhani thali for the first time.
It was a nice experience since it was my first experience.The thali has a lot of variety and offers multiple dishes of rajasthani and gujarati cuisine right from snacks to main course dishes and variety of breads and desserts.Overall its a good experience and the food is good, however if you dont like these two cuisine it will nt feel very great.
Slightly expensive but can be visited once in a while

Had our bhai phonta lunch. The arrangements were really good. We had 17 people. They provided the ritual thali as well and we did our bhai phonta there and had an excellent food afterwards. Everyone praised the food though all of us preferred vegetarian. Full Rajasthani thali served with dedication. One of our group came late and he had to be served separately which they graciously accommodated for.

Well it was my third time in this place on last Tuesday. Heading to this place for a third time clearly states the magic the thali has. It's an authentic Rajasthani thali restaurant which serves unlimited food may it be whatever, starting from the Puri to the awesome alu dum to the jalebi with khir. Their service is humble as well. 
Now lemme come to the points which I didn't quite appreciate about this hyped place-
They offer you jeera drinks and kesar drinks on the go for which they charge an extra 60 bucks. Also they serve a benarasi pan @ 30 bucks. So here's what I can tell that it becomes a little too awkward when it clearly advertises about unlimited food @250.

 And the offer @250 is only valid on Tuesdays excluding public holidays so it's again another clever move on their part.

Overall the Rajasthani Delicacies are quite heartwarming.

Today I ordered two meal box from a online app.
First one is elite meal box and the other one is satpadi roti meal box.
Both the meal box was great i really enjoyed the flavours of the each individual dishes..
Elite meal box(‚Çπ215) you will find 4 different vegetable item, 2 farsan, 8 roti, rice, dal, papod, salad,pickle, 2 gulan jamoon. The whole meal box is more than enough for 2 people.
Satpadi meal box (‚Çπ105) have 2 satpadi roti, gorom gatte ki subji, raita and papod. Both the roti and sabji was well prepared. You will crave fo more after eating.
I can still smell the aroma of the dishes in my hand. If you really want have great and compact all in one lunch in a very low budget go for it.
This restaurant will disappoint the meat lovers. But if you really wanna enjoy indian food with great taste you must try these meal.

As a pure vegetarian joint they have an amazing variety and great service. As per d food some of the dishes are very good like the Dal baati churma, kchidi,  gujrati snacks,  masala chaas, jowar roti, gulab Jamun,  mix green Sabzi. Rest of the items were average for me. Pocket friendly.  Good for once in a while when u crave for a hearty Indian Meal.

Seriously, i didn't liked the food !! Although they served a lot of food at the service provided was good enough but...the food didn't satisfied my taste buds...it was rajasthani and gujrati mixup food...people only who love gujrati and rajasthani food should come here...i wasn't comfortable there !! Staffs were good but the arrangements was average ...the taste of diffrnt foods were good but i didn't find that authentic touch to the food they provide... earlier they didnt said that lassi wasn't included in the buffet menu...and when we ate we saw that they served dishes and asked for which wasn't included....in the buffet that was what i found so bad...not because i am paying what i had but because they didn't mentioned....on tuesday two of us went there ...on that particular day the thali costs 225 + tax....and on that day...for 2 thali we paid 729rs  .which includes 2 thali and a lassi of rs136 ...it was a joke like the entire thali was 225 but a single lassi was 136...and also a bottle of mineral water...must ask them...what js included within buffet !!

I wanted to visit dis place since 2012, but I finally made it yesterday...üòÉ Now coming to the facts and d infos...
We reached there at 1pm.. d moment I opened the door... They told us to go and sit upstairs... Although I read that they welcome u with tikas, and Aarti but somehow there wasn't anything like dat...
The decor was nice, I just loved the lights of the ceiling... The service was quite prompt...n even though it's a thali..but the food is unlimited!!!
They serve the food on the table..
Now...as it was a Tuesday...so it was a happiness thali...n d menu goes like this...
‚Ä¢ Raita- curd based raita with onion and herbs... Simple and nice..
‚Ä¢ Green chutney- I ate better green chutney elsewhere than dis...not bad..
‚Ä¢ Red chutney- sweet to taste... One can taste the hint of jaggery as well as a bit of tamarind in it...
‚Ä¢ Aachar- normal in taste...
‚Ä¢ Dal Baati Churma- dis was first tym I was having dis...so can't compare...but one tip.. have it warm, as soon as it gets cold...it does not taste dat good...
‚Ä¢ Vada - nice and small, filled with potato and herbs...
Tastes good...
‚Ä¢ Khaman Dhokla- soft and airy...
‚Ä¢ Saag- dey told a different name for this...but somehow I couldn't understand...so dis is what I called d dish... Good..
‚Ä¢ Panner- I love panner, so I do love dis dish... üòÑ
‚Ä¢ Alu ki sabji- basic dish...
‚Ä¢ Chole badam ki sabji- normal and light to taste..
‚Ä¢ Curry - again another basic...
‚Ä¢ Meetha daal - dis is a gujrati dish....daal tastes sweet... although I have a sweet tooth..but I didn't like it...(personal opinion)
‚Ä¢ Daal- normal daal with a hint of spices...another basic dish..
‚Ä¢ Roti wid ghee - basic wheat roti
‚Ä¢ Paratha - trinagular shaped paratha filled with a stuffing..
‚Ä¢ Bajra ki roti- they served with a white coloured butter on it...I don't know what is dat actually...
‚Ä¢ Puri - basic puri...dat u get everywhere..
‚Ä¢ Papad- crunchy
‚Ä¢ Khichdi- I liked dis one very much....it tasted real good...
‚Ä¢ Pulao- nicely cooked...
‚Ä¢ Chaas- buttermilk based drink...it really helped me to gulp down dis huge amount of food...
‚Ä¢ Keshari Lassi- we paid separately for dis..nice.. ‚Çπ77extra..
‚Ä¢ Jaljeera- I just loved dis....dis was too good...üòãpaid separately for this one..
‚Ä¢ Coconut Halwa- good...a bit on the sweeter side..
‚Ä¢ Basundi- another yum dish... And it is the winner..üòã
‚Ä¢ Malpua with Rabri - simple , sweet and crispy...
‚Ä¢ Paan- paid separately for dis ...‚Çπ25 extra..
The service is quick, staffs are really courteous, ambience is nice...
I was actually fascinated with the concept of having so many dishes on one plate...üòÖüòÖ
Being a non vegetarian...I was thinking dat it may happen dat I don't like d food...but on the contrary..we really liked the food...and filled to the brim..
Do visit once... For the new experience...
P.S. - food is really light with a home made taste that u would love ...no feeling of heaviness later..üòÖüòã

Went Tuesday to have a lunch with my friend. I am non vegetarian and this place is for vegetarian. So, it was an experiment. We didn't have huge expectation.  I loved their warm welcome with aarti,tika and mitthai.. We went there at about 2p.m. Their serving procedure is totally exceptional. Staff are very prompt and helpful. 
Finally we started our thali.. They started fulfilling our thalis and each katoris.. I don't remember the names of the vegies. It contained kachori, roti,puri, khichdi, pulao,3types of daal (both spicy and sweet), strawberry flavoured dhokla (amezing taste), salads, gobi curry,paneer curry, alu curry ,2 more curries (don't remember the names), papad, halua and another sweet dish etc..  Though it is thali but the items are not limited. We ordered aam panna and lassi (not included in thali).. Food was good.. Satisfied..

One of the very few options for satvik food here in kolkata.
It offers a mixture of gujrati and rajasthani cuisine.
A great ambiance with courteous staffs that provides you a royal treatment strating from mang tika on arrival to getting your hand washed and paan at end.
Hats off to the hospitality.
Now coming to the food they have a wide array of veg delicacies. Some of those are very good and some are not. To me daal baati churma was bellow avg whereas just loved the dahibada, malai kofta curry, khichri and puranpulies.
Overall quite a good new experience.

Disclaimer: if not a veg food fan this place is not your cup of tea.

Nice  place... First of all they  wellcomed  us by arati  tika  and sweets.... Then they gave us our seats... As we are fond of non veg eating it was a experiment  for  us... They gave us thali,hot water for hand washing.... Then they started to serve their Thali items one  by  one.... Many  items  were there, but at present  could not be able to recollect  them... We take beverages  like mango panna  and lassi... Lassi  was very heavy and Awsm.... Mango panna  was also  good  ,quality of food was really great,i personally  enjoyed it very much....

You want Rajasthani rich food, do hop in asap ! üòä Located in between Oxford book store and Olypub.
Traditional welcome with "Tika" and some sweets. You feel the comfort the moment you enter. They help you wash your hands at the table itself. I had the weekday thali and they have such variants that they actually take you on a Rajasthan Tour. Staff is very courteous.. they serve with all their heart and ask you to try every dish !
Thank you Rajasthani Thali ! üòäüëç

Location - 4mins walking distance from Park Street Metro & next to Park Hotel.

Date - 31.10.17 ( Tuesday )

Ambiance - Not a very huge place but they can accommodate more than 40 people at a time.. the interior looks very clean and bright.

Impression - we believe that first impression is the last impression and they treating us very nicely so ofcourse we impressed a lot for their services & i just wanted to say that they seriously has some well behaved staff .. staff were very polite .

Firstly they came with bowl and warm water fr ur handwash and then they started serve food.

Food - Coming to food , everybody knows that they are famous for their huge amazing thalis..
In Normal days they charged 360+ Tax for a thali but as today is Tuesday so they provide the same thali in 225+ tax.. so, i must say it was a steal the deal offer fr sure..
I didn't expect that much variety of food but yes they served more than 20 items in our thali
Started from Dhokla , some sort of paties with 2types of chatni & salad then they served 3types of roties , 1 puri , Alu sabji , cauliflower sabji , paneer masala , 2types of daal , tarka , papad , Jalebi, aam raas , milk chansh , sooji halwa , kheer , polaao , khichdi , daal bati churma etc..
I ordered a Mittha Paan in last.

Every dish was nicely prepared and yummy !!
I never knew that veg can beat nonveg but it can..
Highly recommended for everyone . Go try atleast one time & it is heaven for vegetarians.
Overall a very statisfactory experience. Do Visit Again if possible..
Peace ‚úå

A vegetarian thali Restaurant on park street. Earlier this was in Mani Square. Shifted to park street. 

An authentic veg restaurant which perhaps covers almost everything in veg. Good taste. The entry and the process of cleaning your hand will really make u feel like a Maharaja. 
Food were good and tasty. Only thing probably I will hv the way they serve. It‚Äôs super fast and sometimes u feel u r not getting enough time to finish the previous serving. Another thing people who serve , serve so mechanically. I hardly found anyone smiling or have even a tinge or smile. 
What‚Äôs interesting is they have the problem vision of small portions or tiffin lunches depending on your budget as well.

I personally dread these kinds of places because of my low appetite.But this time I gave it a go with all my heart and barely returned home only to skip dinner too.
I have been to Rajdhani Thali in Delhi and I must say just like in Delhi, the service and the food here was great too.This is a must visit for all üçõ Thali üçõ lovers I personally loved the Kadhi, Paneer sabzi,Rajma, Dhokla Idli,Okra and the Mango Lassi. The Mango Lassi is not included in the thali but they go around table to table selling these drinks. Other drinks included Aam Panna and Jaljeera. Also, I loved the part where they come with a portable basin to help you wash your hands with warm water before and after the meal. I truly enjoyed the experience here and people with bigger appetites would absolutely love the selection and contrasts of tastes in one single meal.

I went for Vaiphota lunch with my sister. Ambience of this restaurant is quite okay time. I can rate 4/5. 
Service is too good. We have got a warm welcome. First they brought warm water to wash our hand before serving the meal. After meal also they brought the same. They are asking so frequently and politely for repeat any dish. And also guiding so well which item should eat with which. So for Service perspective I am giving full 5/5.
Now coming to food, Menu was like below :
1)chatni 4types (green chutney ,  imli chutney garlic chutney, Coconut chutney) 
2)small portion of salad
3)Dhokla 
4)Gatte ka sabzi 
5)aloo parwal 
6)Chana masala 
7)Paneer masala
8)Small samosa chaat 
9)Dal bati Churma 
10)Dal pakoda 
11)Dahi vada 
12)Mitha Dal 
13)Plain Dal 
14)Khichdi 
15)Rice
16)Normal Roti with clarified butter 
Bajra ka roti with gur 
17)Halwa Puri 
18)Jilabi with kheer 
19)Payesh 
20)Buttermilk 
So according to menu, ample of items was there. But taste was not that good. Items like paneer, chana masala can taste more more good. There should be few more open option for complementary drinks. More items should be there as part of starter. 
It was cost 917 for 2 with one mineral water. 
So I can rate only 3/5 for food.

It's a nice place to have vegetarian food. The ambience is very good. The service persons are very supportive & helpful. The taste of food is also quite good. But there is too many items for me. Even I was unable to taste all the items also. I will like request the "Rajdhani Team" to introduce ala carte menu.

One of the worst places I've ever been too. Management is incompetent, arrogant, rude and downright indifferent. The servers have an attitude and no ability. Food was below average. Every air-conditioning unit was leaking water on the tables. Bookings are of no value to them. The food preparation looked unhygienic!  Save your self the trouble and don't visit such an establishment!

Vegetarian food might not sound appealing to many but when people dressed in beautiful clothes with the warmest welcome serve you delicacies from their province in a sweet sing sing tone you just cannot let your carnivorous side overpower. Such was my experience at Rajdhani, park street where I went as Gayatri Mitra, ‚Äúthefoodiebong‚Äù but I became ‚Äúhamro mitro‚Äù after I finished the meal.
                                                                ...

Just had lunch today at Rajdhani. Must say some of the dishes are really delicious, and especially love the variety. Never really tried rajasthani or gujrati dishes much before this, so enjoyed the dishes. The ambience may not be that great, however at such an affordable price, the thalis are really good to try. Some of the beverages cost extra and the paan too. Also had a lucky draw thing going on so got 20% off. The staffs are very friendly and the food is unlimited. Must try if one is into vegetarian dishes.

Went to Rajdhani for lunch. Food was good. They have maintained the Rajasthani taste. But the service of the buffet was not upto the mark. We had to ask for most of the items everytime again and again. There was a lag each time and service was not impromptu - which was disappointing. Price is ok. Ambience was also ok, but can be improved.

Don't know how others rated so high for this restaurant. Last week we have been here, we¬†were so excited to have Veg Thali food. However, we were so disappointed, food is so bland, none of the items served was up to the mark except one or two.¬†Homemade food is better than this. No value for money definitely¬†not a repeat .If you are foody do not try this place.

The Color of Light knocks its way at Rajdhani with their Diwali Special Thali..!

One of the most popular and sought-after festival in India, Diwali is literally knocking on the door. A festival of lights, prosperity, tranquility, peace and that of symbolizing the victory of the good over the bad, this festival ushers in bundles of joy and oozes out dollops of happiness in all our hearts and mind irrespective of our regional preferences. That being said, this is also a festival to celebrate, be jolly and eat out with your near and dear ones.¬†

Rajdhani, a premier brand and name in this country, has bought forward an extremely well and diligently curated Diwali Menu, to satisfy the tastebuds of its patrons. Some of the basic items remain the same, which is for example Roti, Phulka, Aachar, or even three kinds of chutney, but the surprise comes mostly in the form of the side dishes and the extraordinary sweets to tickle your appetite. 

We were invited for a brief foodtasting and even before I entered the place, I knew I was going to get clean bowled by the awesomeness. With a huge thali being kept on the table, then began the serving process. We were asked to cleanse our hands, and then followed the ongoing of three kinds of chutney, Aachar, Pickle, Lemon, Salt, two kinds of Daal (Out of which one was slightly on the spicier side). Paneer Khaman Dhokla was then served, which had a slightly Italian taste to it.¬†

The Dhokla was soft and spongy, and undoubtedly was one of the items which I liked the most. Then came Shikampuri Punjabi Tikki, Raj Kachori, Dry Fruit Bhareli Baati with churma, Bharwan Sambhariya nu Shaak and Green Gujarat.  The Tikki was crispy and flavorful, The Raj Kachori tangy and sweet, Bharwan Sambhariya nu Shaak was overloaded with green vegetables along with shaak. Next followed Rajatsthani Kaju Masala, Sangria Paneer, Paneer Anjeer Makhaniya Sabji and Mewari Paneer.  Ratlami Sev Kadhi,¬†

Rajasthani Kaju Masala and Mewari Paneer won my heart with their super-light texture and for their contrast in flavors. The Kaju Masala had a thickened gravy, slightly on the oily side, but not oily per se. Special care was taken to make the dish look and taste delicious without the extra intake of oil. The Mewari Paneer had a light texture instead, mostly on the creamy side, and both of them paired well with the butter-clad roti and the paratha. 

To end, the desert part proved to be the killer. Mawa Karanjiya could be taken even a dozen together. Built on the shape of Balushahi, this rather had no liquid inside, but was even sweeter, crisp and tastier than the most sought after sweet in the world (if there was one). Then followed the Kaju Katli, Shakarpara and Murukku. The Kaju Katli or the Kaju Barfi as one may call it popularly was again nicely done.¬†

The epitome of Gujarat Murukku, gave a crunchy and crispy end to one of the most memorable meals ever. But then, there was the Chaas or Butter Milk to gulp down if you ever felt thirsty. Personally, I cannot wait any longer to welcome the Diwali and be a part of its celebrations. If you have a similar plan, which I believe you ought to do, take out your friends, relatives or your parents and treat them to something exotic, yet simple and memorable to cherish the pages of history.

¬†NB:- Was invited as a part of the group Panchphoron for a food tasting event to try out some of the newly introduced dishes at Rajdhani, Parkstreet Kolkata Branch.

                        Khandani Rajdhani ‚Äì The ‚ÄòKing of Thali‚Äô in India!

Talk about creating a visual and esthetic pleasure while dining, and one of the very first names which come to your mind is ‚ÄòRajdhani‚Äô. A national chain, my first encounter with Rajdhani was at Bengaluru, at their Central Mall near Jayanagar.  I was simply flabbergasted by their sheer depth in variety as well as quantity while maintaining an utmost simplicity and down to earth flora and fauna. Their grace and kindness gives an impression of adhering to the idea of abiding by the mantra ‚ÄòAtithi Devo Bhaba‚Äô, where guests are considered the ‚ÄòKing‚Äô. When you step inside this outlet at Park Street, you are greeted and welcomed with their hospitality which is then followed by washing of hands. Not only does this impart a positive vibe, but also has a psychological gesture which involves in the cleansing of mind and soul. 

Speaking of the cuisine, it mostly reflects the culture of Gujarati and Rajasthani food, unless it is a reflection of a local or national festival. The food is served in beautifully large steel platters, with the servers replenishing the bowls or katoris even before you have a chance to finish them. Each and every individual item is prepared in a beautiful and aesthetic way, displaying a fine variety of taste and flavor. The chefs are handpicked and selected carefully, o as to give in the best of experience to the patrons. We were invited to experience the simplistic grandeur and savor the flavorful food created by their in-house maestros.

Speaking of the thali we were served, words do really fall short. It was simply loaded with multitude of dishes, each having its own shine and aroma, yet looking so simple and lucid. This is ofcourse, not including the various kind of staples which were there as an accompaniment. Three kinds of Achar, Kesar Lassi, Buttermilk, Rice, Pulao, Aam Panna, Mogerdal Bhakarwadi, Pizza Dhokla, Mewa Masala Dal Batichurma, Spicy Papad stuffed Rotla, Stuffed Marwadi Gatte and Masala Khichri were the star highlights. My personal favorite was the Pizza Dhokla which was primarily a Dhokla with the toppings and flavor of a Pizza. 

The Dhokla was soft as a sponge and melted in the mouth easily. The Aam Panna, Kessar Lassi and Buttermilk were served as accompanying drinks so as to complement the food we were offered. Coming to the Sabjis, the Batichurma deserves a special mention. An iconic dish of India, hailing from the state of Rajasthan, this primarily comprises of a roundish shaped fritter made out of wheat flour which is fried or baked to perfection. One is then supposed to crush it with bare hands, and pour the Dal over it. 

There is no harm in accepting that none of us were able to finish whatever was served to us. But then, there is always room for some deserts. Moongdal Halwa and Kesar Jalebi with Rabri provided us with the sweetest of all ending. The Halwa, emancipating the aroma of ghee provided a tough challenge to opt for the Kesar Jalebi which was topped with Rabri. Both the Halwa and Jalebis were crisp, not too sweet, but managed to compliment us with the perfect ending we were looking for.¬†

At the end, we were again offered water to wash our hands, highlighting the importance of cleanliness and the personal care of touch by the staff members. Having already won numerous awards and accolades, it is no wonder why the mantras of this brand, which highlights the essence of ‚ÄòTraditional Welcome‚Äô, ‚ÄòRasoi Mein Aapka Swagat Hai‚Äô, and ‚ÄòAao Thali Bajao‚Äô provides the guest with the complete set of experience and comfort.

NB:- Was invited as a part of the group Panchphoron for a food tasting event to try out some of the newly introduced dishes at Rajdhani, Parkstreet Kolkata Branch.

Restaurant with west Indian culture theme. Nice ambience with aesthetic interiors. You will always get someone near you to assist. Food quality is 'okay' type but you will have a huge number of bowls in front of you with Rajasthani and Gujarati taste.

"Rajdhani Thali" struck the right chord on our first visit to this park street restaurant for a Sunday lunch. To begin with, the hospitality of this place bowled us over. From providing warm water from metallic utensil for hand wash, before and post meal, to serving the food items, in all the departments, the waiters and staffs won our heart. Now coming to food, all the items (from starters to desserts, there are many) are nicely prepared and tasted really well. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our gastronomic experience at Rajdhani Thali.

Another Vegan Delicacy

Overall: If you are vegan and seeking variety in items on a plate, this may be another place to venture. Overall an average satisfactory and mechanical experience - but may be adequate to a first timer or if you have good appetite for non-bengali cuisine.

- Ambience: Normal seating arrangement and lacks the traditional settings it represents or characteristics (in sharp contrast to its sister outlet in the capital.

- Quality of Service: Proficiency well demonstrated - is more of a mechanical and cold and lacks warmth or hospitality of the cultures whose food is being served. No experience of any specialty or difference. Also pace of service could be slowed to provide guests a more filling experience to satiate the appetite.

- Food: Blend of items from good to average quality and definitely in adequate quantity. A menu chart, sequence of items, and a crisp brief from waiters with a slight smile can make a huge difference in keeping with the fabled hospitality of the city of Kolkata.

Was glad to show and give him the taste of indian traditional food. 
This place is a Must visit.

Rajdhani located beside Kwality on Park Street was an offbeat choice for a full blown non-vegetarian like me...we chose the place on Saptami afternoon as it was the only one without a queue üòâ. The Rajasthani/ Gujarati food that they served was high in quality but mediocre in taste...though the thali comprised of more than 10 items they were mostly bland as if health is the only consideration.. Liked the aludum..brinjal curry...and paneer....We were served jowar and makkai rotis which were unique in their rustic flavour...The drinks( chaas, lassi,fresh lime etc) offered were good.. and the crispy jalebi n creamy rabdi were the sweet endings super tasty and just the right proportion...the staff was courteous and extremely attentive..I felt as if I was eating in a biyebari surrounded by caring people who only wants to feed me to my hearts content....Having said that, the food was easily digested there was no feeling of heaviness and in the evening I went back to my non-vegetarian choices...
Give it a try,  it will surprise you with the sheer number of dishes and the hospitality...light on the pocket and stomach too...üòÅ

Decor is too good....you will get a feeling as if you are in Rajasthan....waiters are dressed up in rajasthani style....its a pure veg restaurant....price is high for food....but is value for money.....there is offer 1 day in a week....i guess it's on Tuesday....Ambiance is decent....there is a drum and stick at the exit....if you like the food....you can bang the drum with the stick....behaviour of waiters is too good....i would like to go there once again if got a chance...

A nice restaurant serving vegetarian Rajasthani/Gujarati delicacies, located in Park Street. Lunched here on Sashthi afternoon; we were greeted warmly with the warmth of mangal tika and laddoo. The servers are extremely well-trained and gracious. They serve variety of items from revolving servers like dal, chutney, paneer kasundi, veg items, dum aloo, chaas or chachh (the popular yogurt-based Indian buttermilk), refreshing choice of drinks like lassi or aam panna, malpua, khichdi, and many other items, even plain rice if asked.
They also present warm water from samovars to cleanse one's hands before and after the meal, for one usually requires digging into the Rajasthani thalis with hands, specially for the breads and rotis.
Overall for those with an inclination towards wholesome vegetarian North Indian food Rajdhani Thali is a decent choice.

Lets start with the courteous staff, ready to help. Decor... average nothing Rajasthani but clean. Food was okay. The menu included various items. Items worth mentioning are the dry fruit kheer and pineapple halwa, Gathe ki sabzi, palak mixed veg and mithi dal. There was an item which was some plaza... it is worth mentioning.

Went there for a thali. A friend got me some discount as well. The Thali is exceptional. A hardcore non veg, I found the Marwari to be enticing enough to lure your taste buds here once again. I loved the Aamraas. It tasted heavenly.

Probably the first restaurant to whom I am giving a total rating of 5. The place situated in park street, the posh area of kolkata. It is very difficult to find good restaurants in here coz each and every restaurant is quite up-to the mark. If u r a vegetarian or not, u must try their thali. It is fabulous. I have tried many thalis all around kolkata, but nothing was compared to this. It was very very delicious. The service, the interiors, the food quality, the staffs response, each and everything was just perfect. Do visit this place.

A great place to have your meal.
Amazing food with excellent service.
I have recently visited the place on my birthday and unfortunately I was not satisfied with an item, within a minute they replaced my entire thali and made that complimentary.
Good place to have your lunch or dinner.

One of my friend suggested me to visit restaurant for once . To keep his promise I once visited this restaurant on Tuesday. It's situated on one of the happening places in Kolkata which is park street .          The interior of this restaurant is nice and soothing . Two systems were available one  u can take away and another u can sit and have u or meal . I chose the 2nd option . From a source I came to know that they serve two states food in one thali first one is rajAsthani and 2nd one is Gujarati .being a typical non vegetarian I didn't hesitate to eat a veg thali . It include dishes like dal bati churma which is a famous Rajasthani dish then thepla dhokla and many . As a foodie I loved the food and also the price is pocket friendly

The restaurant tries to do something extra but pretty much fails at it.
Firstly,we received a warm welcome with the tika. That was a nice touch.
The waiters are very responsive and courteous. That was probably the only saving grace. But I didn't really travel all the way to this place to be swayed by the behaviour.
We had the buffet lunch which started with dhokla,samosa and 4 types of chutneys. They were pretty good. Then things went downhill. The daal baati churma was much awaited but it was tasteless. The sabzis and dals were all tasteless too,except the sweet dal. 
The Kesar drink was worth it though you have to pay extra for that. 
The desserts were good,specially the fruit thing (forgot the name).

The thing is,so many items aren't helpful when 80% of them are tasteless. A vegetarian buffet doesn't mean making everything bland.We had major expectations from this place. Disappointed.

Very expensive, too much for pure veg food. there was only one vegetable curry and very few small pieces of paneer. So why so much cost, i wonder.
Service - 5/5
Ambience and decor - 5/5
Food Quality - 4/5
Quantity -  more than enough for a person
We were offered jaljeera upon arrival. We had no clue that it was not a part of the thali and the meal was served so fast, we didn't get a chance to ask. When the bill came we saw that we had been charged extra for it. They could have informed us before serving, that it would be charged extra.
One may visit the place once, but not worth going twice

A hardcore non vegetarian like meh who quite believes it's worthless spending bucks on veggies food outside...yet on much convincing of my hubby decided to give it a try.thankfully on his advise gave breakfast a break.         Coming to RAJDHANI it was awesome .when we went in no Tilak was done though it started later.coming to food the aampanna and kesar lassi not included in the thAli were cool. Then the super grand meal followed.DAL BATI CHURMA,3 types of dal,3 chutneys,4 sabji,phulkas,poori,paratha,bajra roti,papad ,vada , gatte ki khicdri,dhokla with sev,barfi,kheer,Malpua with rabri and Chass to wash it all. They feed u like lijiye na and putting over hands like mums do..... apart from the barfi and the ridge gourd sabji all scored perfect.Their khicdi with aa spoonful of desi butter tasted out of the world I cd live on that forever.the kadhi and Gujrati dal were just perfect.the breads soft and perfect textured.sabjis were done well.chaas refreshing.daal bati was good and the Malpua soft in between and crisp on sides with the balanced rabri . The chilled water tasted the best after this.The paan too was good.worth a try

Right at the heart of Park St, another veggie delight. From (the best on the plate) daal baati churma to other dals and sabzis and samosa and dhokla and what not, this Rajasthani thali is worth killing for. Keep some space for the halwa and malpua at the end. Must visit!

One of my favorite pure vegetarian restaurant with Rajasthan flavors... The thali served here has a numerous variety of mouth watering food...  The hospitality is overwhelming...  The traditional way of hand washing is still a best part here. 
The independence day become more valuable when this place add on to your mood with supporting decorations and gifts. 
Dal bati churma is always one of my favorites in the menu.  This time kadi, aloo fry, dhokla, mix veggies, rasam, roti with ghee, paratha, pudi, khichdi,  pulao rice,  butter milk, halwa and chena sweets. What lovely day to celebrate independence day...

"The little Rajasthan in the city of joy Kolkata" best authentic Rajasthani thali and jain thali. The ambience around is enough to njoy with family. The servings start with welcome drink lassi followed by main course of unlimited daal n sabzi and lastly dessert.The food I loved most is the daal bati churma n jalebi with kheer. The overall experience was nice.@

Craving for Rajasthani cuisine? This is where you should go. Rajdhani, situated in the busy Park street area has  a beautiful ambience inside that calms you down. The restaurant is themed in ethnic Rajasthani culture. It is known for the "famous Rajasthani thali". All the contents of the thali are mouth watering and delicious. They serve food in a traditional way, keeping up with the theme.

Amritsari Chole Bhature,Delhi ki chhat kashmiri Rogjan josh. ..and dal batti churma from Rajasthan are the most delectable dishes when we¬† think about North Indian food.
For the 86th birthday of the patriarch of our house we opted for Rajasthani food and visited Rajdhani¬† restaurant on park street.
The resturant being on ground floor and at a convenient location was a great help as our father is wheel chair bound .The staff is extremely polite ,fast,friendly¬† and efficient.
However, coming to food it was a major disappointment for all of us as the insipid looks of each dish served ,was¬† low on taste and flavour ..far from our expectations!!
Starting from dal batti churma,dhokla to kichadi,saag Halwa¬† each item lacked taste and distinct Rajasthani flavour and aroma. Jalabes were tasty.
Lassi and pan were good( separately chargeable and¬† not part¬† of the thali).

The place is good , comfortable and¬†¬†staff well mannered but the constant presence of so many men to serve us without a breather is irritating. While you are still struggling with main course Jalabes and Halwa are offered!!
Unique and interesting sign language of the staff¬† if used with a little gap. .will help guests to¬† relax and 'perhaps' relish too!!
The above is not a review of a single person but all ten of us!

There is more to just the quintessential Dal baati and churma in Rajasthani cuisine. My insight into Rajasthani and gujrati cuisine would have been non existent if I had not visited Rajdhani and feasted on their surplus thalis. From the traditional dal baati churma to the phenomenal gatte ki sabzi, puri, jhatpat  capsicum paneer and the soul refreshing aamras, the colors, the flavors and authenticity of Gujarati and Rajasthani food renders you with a wondrous conclusion about the magic of Indian vegetarian cuisine.

Very average food. All the food items were bland..I was expecting it to be really authentic in taste like some Rajasthani or Gujarati flavour but I was highly disappointed. ¬†Hope they up their game next time.

Today I bought an elite meal box. Packing was of worst quality. Papad and farsana are not packed. Sweet box was leaking so every item got wet.  There was no ghee or butter applied on rotis. The way they are fooling is of great heights. Please be aware before taking take away

My first visit to rajdhani was in Muscat , Oman. It was a remarkable experience.  But this outlet didn't overwhelm me to that extent. But still,  it's a decent place to go with family.  And if you are a vegetarian,  you will surely fall in love with this place. And if you are tired of having too much non veg,  this will be the best place for you to stop

I had high expectations from this place but was disappointed. The food was not as flavorful and the price for the quantity given also did not seem fair. Failed to get that authenticity of Rajasthani and Gujarati food. Ambience is good though. Will give it another try soon.

I went to Rajdhani with a lot of expectation and craving for authentic rajasthani and gujarati food. But I came out disappointed. It was not even close to the traditional food I had in both rajasthan and gujarat. For refreshment, they experimented with the dhokla by adding different colours, nuts and tutty fruitya. But it was hard and tasteless. Coming to the other dishes, all were okayish and tasted similar. Only the indian breads served were hot and nice. 

About service and staff, they were cordial and friendly. Since I was not satisfied, so the bill amount was a lot for me and totally not worth it.

Today we ordered 4 elite thali and 1 haryali thali and 1 desert. But i am very sad about the service they provided.. i received the order after 40 minute late and it was not even hot enough to eat and the roti's were all got stiffed. There were few items missing in each elite box and in the haryali thali they had replaced the curry with panneer masala which was not even notified earliar. I only giving them the credit because of the quality of the food and hygiene of the box.

Pamper oneself with the plethora of food that keep on coming....The huge tray like thali with so many small katoris.....The food is gujarati and rajasthani...
It's not about the food only but also the presentation that gives it's grandeur.....250 only Tuesdays....When u r being served everything.....It's worth a try even for meat lovers.....NB - u may need to share ur table when it's crowded and they do charge extra for drinking water

I ordered Khichri today and it was delivered totally spread out in the box leaking from the aluminium foil container. I refused to accept the delivery and ordered again hoping it would be delivered in a proper manner. Sadly second time also it was the same thing.¬†
How can you deliver khichri in a soft aluminium foil container when the delivery boys travel in bikes? Is this how you deliver food?
Plus since the khichri was was out the aluminium container spread in the paper box, it was cold as well.

RAJDHANI, the word itself takes all the concentration from everything. All we understand from the word RAJDHANI is the ruler of the countery. But here all I will tell about the ruler of the THALIs that I have had till date.

Me along with my foodie friends went this place as usual. But in the mid-way of our meal all of us declared - "DEATH BY FOOD"

Accommodation : This place can accommodate 100 heads at a time.

Interior : This is a Rajasthani Cuisine Restaurant, so you'll get to see Rajasthani decor through out the place. And you've to go through some Rajasthani rituals too that you'll love.

Food that we had : They are famous for their Thalis and we had that only. But none of us could complete that full thali. More than 33 items were there in one Thali.

And the funniest part was, those who were serving food they'll not leave any of your plates/bowls empty. So the moment you'll finish a dish they will fill it up again. And when we understood why our plates weren't getting empty we ourselves deliberately kept food there so that they can't fill it up again.

And the way they behaved with us we were so touched. Trust me..Being hard-core non-vegeterian it's not just we loved the food, we loved the entire place and the behaviour of the each stuff.

What's New : They have started their meal box with the food partners Siggy and Zomato starting from just Rs. 99.

So, please don't miss to visit this place. Please once in life experience thalis from Khandani Rajdhani and update your facebook status with : "DEATH BY FOOD."

For now, Happy Tummy in advance.

By the way, if you love the food don't forget to pat the bell before leaving the place. It's a rajasthani ritual.

I'm a proud member of team ‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶Å‡¶ö ‡¶´‡ßã‡¶°‡¶º‡¶® - Panch Phoron - ‡§™‡§®‡•ç‡§ö‡§´‡•ã‡§∞‡§® #PanchPhoron

We all were very eager to try out Rajdhani Thali.Ordered the Rs.225/- thali for takeaway.The thali contained 4 normal rotis,4 bajre ki roti,2 kinds of dal,3 types of sabzi,rice,farsan and gulab jamun.

The variety of items was not interesting .I had expected some traditional Rajasthani fare like dal bati churma,or gatte ki sabzi.But what we got is almost daily made at home( apart from the bajre ki roti), so the purpose of ordering from outside was defeated.The taste of the items were ok-ish.Both the dals were extremely thin in consistency and the curries were
 average.It was a disappointing experience.

Also, I feel its better not to order for takeaway from buffet places.For the same price we do not get the refills (and maybe some items) so its not a value for money.

Traditional north indian vegetarian food as well as the ambience. As soon as you enter you get a homely feeling as if entering into a palace for grand invitation. The people serving gives a smile as soon as you get your seat. There will be a huge plate with small bowls in it and they start filling those with godspeed mind it. Can be slower in that for the people who are not accustomed to such dishes. Coming to the food, the starters like dhokla and aloo tikki are good in taste. I really expected to be great but turned out to be pathetic- the dal bati chorma dish, tasted very very bad. Other dishes were okayish. Cabbage curry again was half cooked. Paneer rather seemed succulent. Different types of dals they kept, didn't know the names. The winner were the payesh and malpoa with rabri. A good chnaach to finish the meal. I would rather say may be my palate is not compatible for such food but they do need improvements to make it work for a person like me.

I went here with my friends on last Sunday for lunch...if u are visiting on weekends..prebooking is advisable!

After being seated , we were offered to wash our hands in a very royal style...quite liked that! Then, immediately 2-3 waiters came up & started serving us by filling in various containers with various items without taking much time!
In the menu u'll find mainly Gujrati & Rajasthani items.U can check out the menu of the day on the board just by the side of reception!

The food was good, certain items were quite innovative.Desserts are awesome... i quite liked the  khajoor barfi .Service was quick!Ambience - nice!

Overall a nice place to enjoy Rajasthani & Gujrati food !

Being a hardcore non veg lover, I was definitely not too happy trying this restaurant.. It was my best friend ''s idea to try this place. 
Went on a Tuesday afternoon at around 12:30-1pm.
The place wasn't full..the service is just amazing. 
The staffs are well trained and courteous.. 
I loved the hospitality. 
Coming to the food..they provided us chaas, 3types of daal, paneer, Dhokla, various types of chutneys, daal bati churma, Gulab jamun, sewaiya, 3kinds of roti, khichri, various kinds of pickles, polao, fried papar and jalabi...food was very good.. 
But due to heat outside and not being an ardent consumer of ghee created a problem for me.

The ‚ÄòKing of Thali‚Äô in India @ Khandani Rajdhani

The Thali styled plated meal has always been synonymous to rich Indian culture and tradition exuberating a nutritious and wholesome dining experience. Unlimited in true Maharaja Style, Khandani Rajdhani brings to a plethora of goodness for you in the form a king size Thali.

Rajdhani, the flagship brand of Mirah Hospitality has created a niche for itself with strong foothold across the Country thereby rightly earning the title of the ‚ÄòKing of Thali‚Äô.

Rajdhani believes in the age-old saying of Atithi Devo Bhava and has introduced few concepts like: 

‚Ä¢ Traditional Welcome - The guests at Rajdhani are welcomed by applying a Tikka on their forehead and aarti. 

‚Ä¢ Rasoi Mein Aapka Swagat Hai - The commitment to authentic hygienic food & good service has led to the industry‚Äôs first, ‚ÄúRasoi Mein Apka Swagat Hai‚Äü programme. Which means, any guest is welcome to visit the kitchen to see the chefs in action. 

‚Ä¢ Aao Thali Bajao - With ‚ÄúAao Thali Bajao‚Äù, delighted guests can signal (express) their pleasure to one and all by ringing the traditional copper thali kept especially for this purpose.

Location : The address reads 21 Park Street, Next to Park Hotel, Kolkata- 700016. It's just located beside The Park Hotel.

Decor and Ambience : The ambience at each Rajdhani Restaurant is rich with vibrant colours truly echoing decades of Rajdhani‚Äôs legacy. Beautifully laid out tables with large steel platters, has warm and friendly servers serving food in their special sign language, transforming the empty thali into an appetizing kaleidoscope of complementing colours, textures and flavours. Although homogenous in nature, each katori in the Thali looks distinct from the other to give you a perfect medley of flavours with each bite.

So finally, I‚Äôve found a good veg thali restaurant in Kolkata!  KHANDANI RAJDHANI !! (Next to Park Hotel, Kolkata) Veg has never been my cup of tea. 
I am a hardcore non-vegetarian but I must say Rajdhani Thali has indeed made me happy with their veg items. If for once you wish to concentrate only on food, I mean lots of food and NOT on pictures, selfie, a themed ambience or long conversation with friends¬† then do visit here. Because what all you do here is EAT till your heart‚Äôs content. 
The speciality of this place is their hospitality‚Ä¶¬† The guests at Rajdhani are welcomed by applying a ‚ÄúTIKA‚Äù on their forehead and ‚ÄúAARTI‚Äù and they also have the tradition to allow their guests¬† to visit the kitchen which is called the ‚ÄúRasoi Mein Apka Swagat Hai‚Äù programmed. The thali styled plated meal is synonymous to rich Indian culture and tradition. The moment you enter, you are seated in a comfy setting and that very moment 3-4 waiters will surround you and keep on serving.¬† Then once your plate is loaded with beautiful looking dishes, they will make you wash your hand with warm water. When you finish your lunch/dinner they have a ritual called ‚ÄúAao Thaali Bajao‚Äù and they have a special thali ¬†for this purpose  !
If you come here you will not feel like a normal restaurant where u just go sit and eat‚Ä¶¬† Here you will feel like a ‚ÄúMEHMAAN‚Äù and you have come to visit your relatives in a special occasion and they are welcoming you in their house warmly‚Ä¶  
Let‚Äôs come to the food‚Ä¶  I and my fellow foodie friends were invited over a food tasting session as well as to cover The New Thali Launch.¬† The thali was absolutely delicious! All foods were amazing, and each and every dish will give you the joy of different flavors with each bite! The restaurant‚Äôs offering exciting inaugural offer, the Lunch- hali priced at 425 bucks, all tax inclusive. And you can get a delicious dinner or a Weekend-Meals for just 425 bucks, all inclusive.¬† The Women‚Äôs Wednesday gives a flat 25% cut-off on their bill.¬† Their Tuesday Thali is priced at 250 bucks and the amazing Monday‚Äôs Takeaway Box comes at an unbelievable price of just Rs.100, excluding taxes. Your evening will be relishing here as Khandani Rajdhani serves delicious snacks from 3-6 pm.¬† There‚Äôs my favourite Takeaway Savouries Counter that makes pickup easy as ever.
I and my fellow foodie friends are invited there over a food tasting session as well as to cover The New Thali Launch. I was mesmerized,the dishes they putted in the thali it was absolutely delicious. We are welcomed a glass of Chas which is one of my favorite one. So going back to food section they prepared various types of famous & authentic gujrati and Rajasthani dishes for this menu.
So what are you waiting for, just go and enjoy the authentic pure vegetarian Indian cuisine ¬† I would like to thank to Rajdeep Bhattacharya, the management, and Soumali Chakraborty for inviting us. 
 

Rajdeep Bhattacharjee (Gourmets Travel Guide) ‚Äì Thanks For leading us

Located just a short walk from the Parkstreet metro, next to park hotel. It is vegetarian restaurant serving Rajasthani and Gujarati food. The decor is authentic and has a royal feel to it. As you take your seat in front of plate with numerous bowls they come greet you and wash your hands in a big bowl,All traditional. The menu had a variety of items each with a different taste. Adding ghee to dishes make it heavenly. Their service is clean and hygienic. The staffs were cool enough to help us understand the recipe and what goes well with the Dal and Sabzi. Overall it was an amazing experience here and would love to give a further visit here. ‚ù§ I'm a Proud Member of Team ‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶Å‡¶ö ‡¶´‡ßã‡¶°‡¶º‡¶® - Panch Phoron - ‡§™‡§®‡•ç‡§ö‡§´‡•ã‡§∞‡§®  #PanchPhoron ‚ù§

There is an elaborate thali system to please your appetite only if you like vegetarian meals. The service is great and they keep asking you if you need anything. It's best to visit the place during summer as there is unlimited aamras to give you that great feel in the heat. It's a recommendation if you are in a mood to ditch non-veg!

If you are a committed¬†to Non-Vegetarian that doesn‚Äôt mean you got to stick to it to the end of the world. Vegetarian dishes are sometimes cool too. So I have a few personal favourites. Recently I attended a tasting session with my fellows to a vegetarian joint namely Rajdhani Thali. The Khandani Rajdhani located in the Heart of Eastern India, 21 Park Street, Kolkata, ¬†is all ready to bring you the best delicacies from Western Indian states of Rajasthan and Gujrat.
                                                                ...

This place is so called for Rajasthani food, I am from rajasthan and i can assure you that what they are selling is not at all rajasthani food, as you can't sale anything crap just by giving pagdis to your waiters and serving in bronze .. I have not had such a bad DAL BATI CHURMA in my whole life .. that 2.5 is also just for the name you are using.

Ordered a Work Meal box (Rs.100)  through Zomato. 
Got the delivery after an hour. 

The box had 4 rotis (smaller than puris), rice, daal, 1 chhole sabji, 1 papad. The daal and sabji came in  small ice cream cup sized bowls. Yes, that's right.

The salad had 1 slice of cucumber and 1 slice of carrot.

Sufficient only for people having low appetite.

Taste? Daal was bland, roti as usual. The Chhole sabji was good. 

Judging the quantity and quality, this working meal box shouldn't cost more than Rs.75.

Veg has never been my cup of tea. I am a hardcore non-vegetarian but i must say Rajdhani Thali has indeed made me happy by their veg items. After going through various reviews and appreciations from my relatives i decided to give this place a visit with my family. Since tuesdays they offer thali at 250rs and we didnt want to hog over too much of veggies so tuesdays were perfect for us. This place is located just opposite Hukana Matata and beside chaa baar and trincas.

We went there at 12.05 but still they werent ready and we had to wait for approx.10minutes and then we were seated. They started serving us after 12.25 which was quite late and this made me a bit disappointed. Due to their lack of readyness i deducted points from them. But once they started their service they knew what they were doing and was very efficient.

Coming to the food, the spread was quite good. The quality was very appreciable. They constantly came asking for repeatation of any item which we loved. The 250rs thali flatters the following elements:

‚Ä¢3chutneys: one imli,one green amd another spicy red chutney.(each of them were good)

‚Ä¢One daal churma.(yumm)

‚Ä¢3Dals: one sambar like dal, one sour dal and one daal which is on a sweeter note.(not good)

‚Ä¢4sabzi: alu ki sabzi,paneer ki sabzi,gatte ki sabzi and gobi ko sabzi(yumm yumm yummm)

‚Ä¢cucumber raita(okhayish type)

‚Ä¢rotis and luchi with ghee

‚Ä¢dry dhokha jhuri

‚Ä¢dry sooji

‚Ä¢pulao

‚Ä¢khichri

‚Ä¢corn halwa

‚Ä¢aam raas(must try)

‚Ä¢malpoa

‚Ä¢papad

‚Ä¢ chaas or buttermilk

I liked each and every dish except the daals because they were really bland in taste. I loved the gobi ki sabzi and alu ki sabzi and aam raas. I can literally live on these 3things, they were so delicious.

Overall a nice experience here and would love to give a further visit here.

It is a very hyped restaurant. Visited this place on Tuesday, for dinner. Food was just average, like cooked at home on a regular basis. Two of my friends got sick coz of their ghee. So, I would suggest everyone visiting there to refrain from ghee, which neither tastes nor smells like one. (I guess, it just makes food heavy)

Staffs were courteous and prompt. There was someone almost all the time to look and ask if you need something. Their service is clean and hygienic.

Rajdhani is in proximity to The Park, so locating the restaurant is very easy.
The restaurant serves you authentic Rajasthani and Gujarati food in the traditional yet prevalent Thali format.
The farsans included Dhokla and mini Patties. The Dhokla was good but the Patty was on the sweeter edge. Main course included Parval subzi, Potato subzi and Paneer subzi. The Parval was overpowered with asafoetida and carom. The paneer was quite tasty. There were 4 types of Dal which were good too.
The Dal-Baati and Aloo Tikki Chaat were delicious.
Then there was roti, puri, rice and khichdi - all of which tasted okay.
There is very limited choice of desserts - Moong Dal Halwa, Jalebi and Aamras.
The service is good and staff is prompt and courteous.
To sum up for such an affordable price, Rajdhani is a good place for Vegans to eat.

Food - 4.5/5
Service - 4/5
Ambience - 4/5

Such amazing food !!!! My God, it can't get any better! The amras, Dal bati are very good and I could not get enough of the Malpua. The sweets are so delicious , you would get high on sugar for the night !! The thali can be very heavy, so I suggest don't let the place be the second one you are heading to for food. The service is awesome. They make you feel like home.

Walking distance from the park Street metro station. Even if you are non vegetarian you will like the food here. They greet you with small Aarti n put Tilak on your forehead once you enter. A big oval plate with small 10 katoras are placed in every table. Once you sit they provide water to wash your. You only have the option of having unlimited veg thali here which has a combination of Rajasthani n gujrati food. Menu changes day wise. Highly satisfied with the location, food quality n menu.

Recently I visited the restaurant with my family and let me tell you, nowhere in this whole city will u find a better place to enjoy rajasthani food. We were 6 people and had ordered "Unlimited thali" .
First of the ambience of the place was nice. Just when you enter the place u will find a small gold coloured thali with Deepak on it and some flowers which gives u the feel of your native place. They have ample of seating capacity. The thali was the most unorthodox one i had ever seen but it could perfectly fit in all the cups for various veggies and daal and amras. There were 2 kind of amras, sreekhand, 3 varieties of daal, 4 kinds of veggies - aloo, paneer, mix, and gatta ; for sweets they served freshly baked jalebi. And one of the best part is that they have a movable container where u can wash your hand and this gives u a royal kind of feeling. All in all the place is a perfect place for family outing if you are interested in enjoying the delicacies of Rajasthan.

On a hot Monday afternoon I decided to help myself with comfort homefood outside home . A friend gifted me a little deal for "Rajdhani" and I took my seat in the beautifully lit dining hall .
The ambience was posh and the decor looked beautiful. Comfortable sofas and chairs laid all the way.
An empty Thali arrived with 12 bowls...and in a span of 5 mins my Thali was totally full with different vegetables,dals,chaats and sweets...And to my surprise not a single dish was bad or tasteless. If not great all of them were ok and tasted nice..

I would specially mention the Chaat , Dal baati churma , palak paneer , aamras and shrikand ..
TOP NOTCH..!

The service is very prompt and they respond real quick with anything you need..

Will visit soon..! :)

Location: 3 minutes walking from Parkstreet Metro, adjacent to the Oly Pub. 

Ambience: Not a big place, still at least 50 people they can accommodate at a time. Not a theme restaurant, but clean and descent one. But what makes this ambience more good is the behavior of their service men. The moment you get your seat, 3/4 people will start to take care of your table. Even water will be offered there on table to let you clean your hands. So I found the service part very pleasant and satisfactory. 

Food: A thali having multiple bowls. Roti, bajre ki roti, puri, rice, khichdi, 3 types of daal, in sabji there were bhindi, alu, paneer, tarka. They gave Dahi bada, daal bati churma, suji ka halwa, aam ras, dahi ka chaas, malpua with rabri (superb this was). Forgive me if I missed any item as the count was high. Taste wise I was not superbly glad, but being a bengali and nonveg lover, it was a different experience and a good one. 

* when you will enter, they will offer you drinks like Aam Panna, Mango Shake etc but it is not complimentary, even at the end the paan is not including the buffet, so extra charge is applicable for both of two items *

The entire buffet will cost 250 excluding tax.

Visited this place with family for lunch today. A complete let down. They did not serve the amras though it was part of the deal. They said it was not in the day's menu. Now how lame is that? You attract customers with the tag line "thali with unlimited amras" . But when they arrive you say it is off the menu. Ridiculous. Otherwise also the quality of food has gone down substantially.

2. The really good quality of food. The rotis could have been hotter but i guess that is unavoidable

3. The perfect packaging and quality of containers used. No spillage whatsoever

4. The presentation of items and the quantity was perfect

5. The on time delivery .

Longing to dine at Rajdhani Thali for a long time, finally went there recently. The ambience is just right. The pricing is quite light on the wallet as compared to the food offered. Since we went for an early dinner, there was less crowd. 

The food items are light yet filling and definitely mouthwatering. They also accept any instructions to prepare the dishes without onion, garlic etc. The service is quick and they try to accommodate most customer requests. Since we went during Summer, we were also given Aam Ras. 

A variety of Rajasthani items, different preparations of vegetables, paneer, sweet dal etc. served. A fulfilling meal it was. 

Food:- 3.5/5
Service:- 4/5
Ambience:- 3.5/5
Value for Money:- 4.5/5

I am big fan of Rajdhani. I used to visit atleast once in a month when it was in Mani square. This is my first visit to the Park street location. I have fully enjoyed my meal. Food quality and hospitality all are perfect. Aamras was just speechless. A must visit restaurant.

This place is very easy to locate. just a short walk from the Park Street metro, next to park hotel. it serves authentic rajasthani and gujarati food. there was normal roti,bajre ki roti,thepla, dhokla, dal bati churma,paneer ki sabzi,mixed veg,kadi,mitha dal,rabri with jalebi,halwa,papad,chaas. the staff is polite and courteous. i would recommend everyone even if you are a hardcore non-veg to visit atleast once.

The place is centrally connected and convenient to find. The ambience is okay, not a very fancy one more like a air conditioned bhojnalay types. Alot more could have been done with the rajdhani as theme cause the locality has its ambience as it's USP.
The food is good spcl dal bati churma, mango kadhi, puranpoli, among the others item were good but not outstanding or something for a normal thali of a chain known for its thalis how ever the service was really good the will make u feel comfortable.....

Worst thali ever tasted. Quantity is not enough for one person , moreover they charge more than any other place. Subzi only had oil and roti is smaller than a quarter plate . Sweet was decent but not worth the money .

This rating is purely for their wrong order. I had ordered for 3 combos. 2 of the combos turned out to be fine. The third combo was shahi pulao and some kadhi..instead of the pulao what i got was khichdi..if the dish wasnt available ull shouldnt have confirmed the order. I couldnt do anything but accept what i got as it was d closing time. Very disappointed.

I love vegetarian food and for a long while had been thinking of trying out rajasthani or gujarati thali. So when I came across this one on Park Street, I had to visit it. From the moment you step in, you'll feel like you have entered Rajasthan! They treat you like a Queen, applying tika on your forehead and give you a special water bowl on your table as they pour water on your hands before you begin your meal. Then once you are settled in and ready, the train begins. They fill up your steel thalis with roti, parauntha, fried rice, dal baati churma, three types of daal, four kinds of sabzi, gulab jamun, halwa, etc etc. The quantity is unlimited as they will keep filling up your thali everytime you finish it till you ask them to stop. Even then, they insist: "aur thoda lijiye, aap ne toh kuch khaya hi nehi" :D true Rajasthani hospitality! One sweet gujarati daal in particular tasted delicious and the hot jalebis with cold rabri was heavenly. A unique experience. Loved it!

First of all I would like to say that Rajdhani thali is a miracle place for any foodie. I mean then served nearly 25 different items including 4types of sweet dishes along with 3types of welcome drink. All are pure veg gujrati food. They provide all you can eat basic thali. So please visit this place, and I'm sure you will fall in love with this place :)

Mango maniac ?? U gotta visit the place during their mango festival. Their aamras tastes üëå


The thali contains a decent combo of Gujarati and Rajasthani cuisines

1) 4 vegetables - Paneer was  fab. 
2) 2 dals: sweet daal was not good. They should avoid it.
3) 3 snacks: daal bati churma was ok. They served with a pakora called paneer lifafa(envelope) . Excellent.
4) chhanch: standard butter milk . Not fancy 

5) 2 desserts: here comes the winner. Aamras was to die for I had 10 portions. Those people continued serving us  till all of were satisfied. It was divine.

We got a deal so the price for us ‚Çπ349/plate which I feel is really good for the quality and quantity the serve. They serve Thalis @250 on Tuesdays. 


Taste: 4
Ambience :4
Service:4
Value for money: 4
With such reviews this features in my must visit list.

If for once you wish to concentrate only on food, I mean lots of food and NOT on pictures, selfie, a themed ambience or long conversation with friends then do visit here. Because what all you do here is EAT till your heart's content. üíùüòõ
I would suggest to go for Thali Tuesday cz you get a  full Scrumptious plate only for Rs. 250 (inclusive of tax). However Tuesdays are a bit crowded so it's better to drop in early. 
The moment you enter, you are seated in a comfy setting and that very moment 3-4 waiters will surround you and keep on serving. Then once your plate is loaded with beautiful looking dishes, they will make you wash your hand with warm water. 
Your plate will have around 10 bowls containg different sabji's, curry, dal baati, aam ras etc and 2 varieties of roti. Rice is served afterwards. Pickles, chutney, dhokla and a dessert like malpuva with rabri further fills your plate. Also a complimentary chaas, which is a very refreshing drink. 
They initially serve little quantity but you can ask for more as many times and they keep on serving and courteous servicing is the best part about Rajdhani. 
Aam ras was the BEST among all and gave a spark to my taste buds. üíù My non vegetarian friends have also fallen in love with Rajdhani therefore do give a try. üòä

Had a great meal here during  navratri. Was on a diet restriction of no onion and no garlic. They thali served was delicious. They made a very yummy dhokla a. D the food was piping hot. The dal bati was very flavorful and the bhindi was absolutely delicious. They made a stunning puranpoli and the tiny bajra rotis were cooked to perfection.

Being a Saturday , I had been to this place with my fiance for lunch. It was a pending visit for 2 main reasons, Both of us wanted to have an idea of the Marwari cuisine and we wanted to do it on a Saturday coz we have to eat veg on that day. Thankfully on the occasion of the Bengali New Year, we decided to have lunch there. 

It was a good experience. The Thali had 10 different items and barring one I liked all of them. It was a complete Thali with a choice of lassi, soda, aam Panna and Mango lassi. The meal was a full course meal with Pan, Shrikhand, Aamras and 
Jalebi with Rabri.  

Service and Ambience was top class. The staff were friendly And courteous and the whole meal was extremely affordable.

The staffs are busy for selling their Pan, Sarvat, Mineral Water etc. not telling the customer that those are chargeable and finally billed an amount and the smile of the Manager to cheat your money by making you April fool.  Where is the vegetables items - Potatoes may be their main items. Don't make yourself fool.

3rd grade reception. Food quality poor of road-side like 4 vegetables are including Yellow Matar ka Gughni aur Normal Alu ka dam. So, low quality food. If you asked for Paneer/Sweets in their stwart little bowl, they will serve you a small spoon Paneer each time and that will be longer in time increase as per your increase of re-requesting. Manager are 3rd grade sadak chap, must be upgraded to a road side dhaba Manager, may be managed here by Oiling to his Boss.

Totally rubbish. How here many people's are reviewing so much good comments, I don't know. Yeh log jo roti khane ko deta hai usko to kapra banake pahan lena chahiye, bahut hi phawlad me tarah majbut hai, Ambuja cement jaisi !!! Really bullShit & talkshit.

They are not serving the food as per their offered menu in outlet or in takeaway. And, their management or head office also entertaining those unfair issue.

Had gone to Park Street with my friends. Wanted to go to Rajdhani for a long time now. Last I had lunch here was in Chennai a few years ago. Had a good experience then. This was no less. The only drawback was the AC which despite telling the staff they were not able to bring the temperature down. Maybe they had issues with the AC. But other than that the service was fine. The backrest in the seating area was a little uncomfortable too which they can improve upon. As for the food it was delicious and I will recommend the karela kaju which was superb.

Went for the buffet today . As much as I wanted to go there , I was a bit dissapointed. Food was nothing special( taste wise) .Its different from buffets, here you sit and the waiters serve , like what happens in weddings n all. As it was my 1st time I didnt know what all was there in the thali so we kept on eating what they provided, later they told ,"Sir you didnt try khichadi or rice ",how are we supposed to know ,they were only bringing everything they should have asked before ! There was no menu , No facilities were we can know what we could get. It wasnt even written anywhere in zomato . Pure vegetarians may like it .

What better way to enjoy a sumptuous Indian meal than a humble "thali" (meaning 'A plate')! ‚ÄúRajdhani‚Äù brings forth a thali that mixes cuisines of both western states leaving you spoilt for choice. Being a thali lover, I was enormously delighted when I found out Rajdhani had an existence in the city, about five years back when I moved here. The moment I laid my eyes upon the Zomato page n saw the thali available at a discounted price of 225/- (12Noon to 3:30PM) on Tuedays, I knew I had to be there! üòª

Located just a short walk from the Park Street metro, next to Park Hotel. There were three of us and we made it around 2:45 in the afternoon (Of course it was a Tuesday). I was bit taken aback when I saw a queue in the reception area and the dining area bustling with people. Didn‚Äôt have to wait much long as we got our call soon enough. There was no traditional welcome with the tilak and puja thali, instead, we were directly escorted to our seats. The d√©cor spoke nothing of the rich cultures of Gujrat or Rajasthan, the seating area very compact and the tables laid with a steel plate along with ten small katoris (bowls) n two glasses for each person. Once they help you to get your hands washed with warm water out of a copper vessel the food starts pouring onto the plate almost immediately.

The thali is likely to fill you up very fast owing to generous amounts of desi ghee using in cooking. It was thoughtful of me to skip breakfast that day üò∏ thanks to the long list of items below -
‚èπChutneys - The green chutney made out of coriander and mint with a tang from lemon juice. The other was a sweet tamarind chutney.
‚èπPickles - Garlic pickle and a mixed vegetable pickle
‚èπDal, Bati and Churma - This is the most widely known preparation from the lands of Rajasthan. The bati was crushed by hand in one of the plates and served with a spoonful of dal on top. The churma served separately can be had with the dal-bati. The dal-bati nothing exceptional and the churma lacking the flavors of a dessert.
‚èπKhamman Dhokla and a Vegetable chop - The dhokla was so flavorful, really soft n seemed to contain lot more ingredients infused into it. Mopped the tamarind chutney clean with this steamed piece of cake and the whole thing disappeared into my mouth almost in a go. The chop (or whatever it was) was quite a taste, with a thin outer coating of crumbs and the filling, low in spice consisting mainly of boiled potatoes smashed together with other vegetables.
‚èπChaas or Buttermilk - Light and refreshing, savored this towards the end of the meal.
‚èπLentils: Gujrathi Kadhi, Rajasthani Moong dal and a Gujarathi meethi dal - Gujrathi Kadhi is a tangier version of its Punjabi counterpart, was well made. The Rajasthani Moong dal was more like a typical north-Indian styled dal, lacked seasoning n tasted bland. The Gujrathi Meethi dal, made out of toor dal had a water like consistency, lacked the balance of sweet n sour.
‚èπSabjis: Paneer sabji, Aloo ki sabji, Bhindi masala, Green moong sabji - Each of the dishes cooked brilliantly, low in oil n spice. The paneer and the aloo sabjis really stood out for me in this department.
‚èπRice: Vegetable Pulao and Khichdi - Khichdi was given a miss. The Pulao was warm and nicely made.
‚èπBreads: Phulka roti, Puris, Bajre ki roti - The miniature sized puris and the bajre ki rotis were excellent but the same cannot be attributed to the phulkas. The phulkas were served along with a dollop of ghee and while I was busy digging onto the other items on my plate, the rotis felt chewy after a few seconds of lying idle.
‚èπDesserts: Fruit custard and Moong dal halwa - The custard, not of a thicker consistency, but silky smooth with small chunks of apple, pomegranate seeds and cashew. The halwa was absolutely spot on with the smooth texture of the dal, a little crunchiness here n there from the added dry fruits, not overly sweet and smelled every bit divine because of the desi ghee. It was the clear winner out of all the dishes in the thali. Stuffed myself with extra helpings of both the custard n halwa till I couldn‚Äôt move anymore. One can imagine how delicious they were!

The hospitality and service is thoroughly praiseworthy as the staff handled the rush pretty well, speedily moving from one table to another serving food, communicating among themselves with hand gestures making the ordeal look real smooth, patiently answering your queries with a warm smile and more than happy to refill your plate as many times you want. A piece of advice would be, when offered with refreshment drinks like Aam panna, Jalebis for dessert (or even a bottle of packaged drinking water) enquire whether those items will be separately billed or included with the thali. Price wise, 225 INR (+ taxes) a thali is quite fair n reasonable, so people aim for TUEDAYS!! üò∏

Now, having already visited their restaurants in Chennai and Bangalore I had sky high expectations from the authenticity of the food, sadly it was a bit of a let down. But since the menu changes on a daily basis as well as with the seasons, I intend to be back for another heartwarming meal hoping for more variations and a better experience. üò∫

A really good place if one wants to have a pure vegetarian fare with lots of options. The food as such is not the greatest. They can really improve the taste of their sabzis. They served a variety of starters including dhokla and dal bati churma which I really liked. The corn and paneer sabzi could have been better and the aloo sabzi was bland. Dals were good and the rotis were fresh and warm. The desserts were also pretty good. My favorite part of the meal was the unlimited chhach! Service is also decent. But make sure you're really really hungry before stepping into this place so that you get value for money.

First this place is very easy to locate. It's on the main road adjacent to Park Hotel on Park Street. It is a vegetarian restaurant serving Rajasthani and Gujrati food. The decor is authentic and has a royal feel to it.

I opted for 'Elite Thali' for takeaway.Taste of everything was very much satisfying, especially baigan ki sabzi, dal and paneer item were remarkable. Other items included salad, papad, gatte ki sabzi, plain rice, roti, dhokla. For me suji ka halwa stole the show. It was yummy with dripping desi ghee. 

 It was good and filling experience. The staff is polite and courteous. I would recommend everyone even if you are a hardcore non-veg to visit atleast once. I am definitely coming back for the grand buffet.

Rajdhani thali has one of the most unique ambience among the restaurants I've visited. In a city where non veg is preferred at every corner it has built it's own reputation among the crowd. The service is very neat and welcoming. The presentation is appreciable. 
The best part of it was the food. The menu had a variety of items each with a different taste. The combination of spices was remarkable. 
My personal favourite was sweets specifically malpua with rabari...

Being a die hard non-veg,this place was a new and a totally different experience for me.
Note: Thought this a veg restaurant ,it has food made from ginger and garlic ,so guys who are non onion or non garlic veg, please think.
The place has a light Rajasthani music going in the background and the most sweet part is that they welcome you with a Tilak and a arti after you enter.
Every table has a huge plate and 10 bowls with a hand towel and two glasses.
It's not a buffet but you can eat as you can. Now to the food, they served two salads with different pickels.Starters include alu Vara and a different but nice dhokla.
That followed with only three sabji ( one with microscopic panner ,u literally need a microscope to find the paneer ). Three dal(A curry dal,meethi dal and Moog dal and  they were awesome) , roti with ghee coating ,paratha slice and puri.
The one thing that I was dieing to eat was dal bati churma which was served and I enjoyed it.
Also was a plain khichidi, masala rice and desert included halwa , jalebi and a Chamcham. They even cleaned the hand in a trational handwash brought to the table directly.
Full marks for innovation in welcome and eticates while serving the food and talking.
Now my review ,they were very polite and served the food with a smile.Food was served in small quantity maybe to reduce wastage. 
Good place for Veg people but being a hardcore non veg didnot enjoy that much and it's not the restaurant s fault. I have uploaded a lot of pics,hope u like them....

The joy of food is not just in eating but also treating.  I am sure many of you have seen these small kids selling balloons and chewing gum on park Street.  Last evening I happened to meet and chat with 3 of them as they expressed the desire to dine in Rajdhani and we decided to share a meal together. The space is small but well decorated. As you take your seat in front of a  plate with numerous bowls they come greet you and wash your hands in a big bowl, all traditional. The cuisine is purely Gujrati and Rajasthani in its making and comprises of different daals, dal bati churma, flat breads and few vegetables completed with sweets and desserts. It was overall a good and complete meal. Special thanks to the lovely staff who treated my guests for the night as kings as they rejoiced and enjoyed their meal. Will recommend.

I'm a pure non vegetarian! Having made that statement I Would Still give this place 5 Stars for the amazing vegetarian Rajasthani and Gujarati Thali that is served. From the moment you sit, to the moment you leave there is a non stop shower of Food and drinks. Dal Batti churma,  farsan, 3 to 4 different types of rotis ,different varieties of dals and vegetables and finally to top it off the best Khichdi I have ever eaten.. desert is a variety of yummy Sweets which is the perfect end to a perfect meal.. my suggestion is always wear loose clothing, stretchy comfortable pants so you can eat your heart's content.. I love this place!

The food is delicious! 
Every dish has a different aroma.
The staff are very sweet!
They treat you in such a traditional way...with tika on forehead at the time of entry..and washing hands in a bronze coloured mesh bowl. Wow!
And they ask you to have more and more and more and more..unless you can not even eat a single piece of rice. And if you eat less they say," ma'am aapne toh theek se khaya bhi nae"
They treat you like their own people. :) :) <3
I'd never get bored of visiting this place.

The quality of food served is quiet hygenic and tasty....though had ordered a take away but the food was not disappointing at all....Had ordered Gatte ki Sabzi along with Puri and Masala Aalooo....
Overall, worth giving it a try.....

Food taste is good. But in my opinion it lacked variety. I liked their Dal Baati Churma for a change. But surprisingly, the Mitha Paan they serve at the end is chargeable. At this price this could have been free. If you choose Jain Food then you will have to wait a little longer as that is not ready made. Good place for taste of change if you get bored with too much Non Veg in Kolkata

so you come n sit and an empty plate with lots of bowls is neatly placed infornt of you. once you wash your hands in the ancient way, the drill begins. the whole plate becomes full in no time and you are left lingering with the thought what to eat n what not to. overall you get a vada n dhokla type for starter, a paneer item, 3 daals all quite sweet, alu dum type, channa masala, 2 sweets n jalebi with kheer, 3 types of roti, puri, chawal, khichdi, chaas n daal bati churma. the drinks n paan are extra add ons. the taste is good. the staff is sweet and courteous.

I was always a huge fan of Rajdhani Thalis and had several family dinner here before, but today I ordered a online combo meal (Khiichdi/Kadhi/Papad/Pickle) through zomato, and on opening the pickle sachet it was found totally rotten black in color bcoz it was approx 1 & 1/2 year old. I believe this one rupee pickle was nothing but as good as poison and can be extremely dangerous which is served by Rajdhani nowadays, so this is my serious warning to these peoples who are trying to play with peoples health.
Requesting zomato also to take serious action against this issue.
ONE RUPEE - Is it really the cost of life for u all.
Shame on you.

Not a huge fan of vegetarian food. But, the Thali that comes for Rs. 150 is pretty filling and quenches the sudden craving for vegetarian food not just for one but two happy tummies. Veg food this yummy is a big plus for a hardcore non vegetarian like me. 

However, the dishes could be a little more interesting. All in all its a good try. My vegetarian friends love it. üòã

Oh my God! You really need to stay hungry for a day if you want to finish the Thali being served at Rajdhani.

I loved the way they welcome us we were treated like the Maharaja and Maharani. Men wearing Rajeshthani dresses gave us water to wash our hands both at the beginning and at the end. Then we were asked to sit at a table neatly arranged. 

Now the show begins a huge plates with lots of small cute bowls was displayed on the table. There were  starters with chatni and achar, then there were different kinds of Roti and stuffed paratha with sabzi, paneer, veg, aalu,then came the dals, a khatti dal,  moong dal, a meetha dal was served which I have tried for the first time and I loved it. There was dal baati, a kind of chaat very similar to phuchka served with green chutney and dahi, then there was khichdi, pulao, raita, malpua, choorma, and so many more I didn't even remember all the names. There was a Chaas, Lassi, which you need to pay for apart from the thali's bill as we were told. This is my second visit here and I found they keep changing the recipe which is good. Previously I ate sooji halwa which was not there this time. Sabzi has also been changed. 

The staffs were cool enough to help us understand the recipe and what goes well with the dal and sabzi.

Ambiance is also good. All I found the person at the billing part is a little lost person. He was guided by the service men. Not very well mannered as well.

Overall it's a good experience.

Note: people with Bengali Mach and mangsho person like me will miss that Mach mangsho charm. Youmay feel disappointed but being vegetarian once in a blue moon is quite good if you are going to RAJDHANI THALI -- Ek Khandani Parampara.

Our visit to Rajdhani was quite a disappointment. I have had veg thalis elsewhere in India and they are far superior. In fact the quality of food offered by their now closed Mani Square outlet was much better ... portions were miniscule, food pretty average ...the only noteworthy thing was the Malpuha with rabdi ... overall a letdown that does not justify the Rs. 425 tag

Skip 2 meals at least if you want to complete a single thali over here. The pictures attached to it, won't even give the entire sense of how huge and how sumptuous it is. 
Remembering all the names of the dishes included is impossible. But they offer 5 types of rotis, a pulao, khichdi, daal baati, churma, fritters, 3 types of daal (a spicy , a meetha and a gujarati prep) 3 types of vegetables (paneer sabzi, aloo sabzi, bhindi ki sabzi) , curry and raita.  For sweets, they gave hot jalebi, and a fruit custard. Alongside the meal, there was lassi, buttermilk chaas, aam panna and fresh lime soda. 

The quality of food is great. Tastes authentic. The staff was so homely and warm, they served with utmost love and care. 
Keep up the brilliant work :) cheers.

Came here for lunch with my friend. This was the 1st time we visited this place. The whole idea of this indian thali has always fascinated me. Let me start with the welcome ritual- when we entered the restaurant, the staff greeted us with "arti ki thali" and put chandan tika on our forehead. Big plates with numerous small bowls were already kept on the table. The ambience is very nice. Before the food started coming one of the staff came with pot of warm water and a tray for us to wash our hands . Then they started serving food with speed of light :p 
Different kinds of chatnis
Salad
Tikki 
Different kinds of sabji 
Different kinds of rotis , parathas, puri 
Khichdi , and rice
3types of pickle
Chas
Some mouthwatering sweet dishes as well 
This never ending list of food were equally delicious and were very light.
I highly recommend Rajdhani...its a veg paradise.

I visited this place last day. The best part of the experience was that we didn't even have to place an order the food was served automatically. The food was good, I wouldn't say great. I had been to the Mani square outlet of this restaurant chain and I think that was better than this one quality wise. The food which was served to us was not hot. I've had Rajasthani food a couple of times, the taste did not match up to the high expectations that I had from this place.
 The khichdi served didn't have salt in it. 
The roti was not hot and it was actually too hard. 
The Puri was okay but then again not hot and freshly made as I would have liked it to be. 
It seemed as if the waiters were in a hurry to stack stuff on the plate without asking first which was good initially but we needed some time to finish what was in there before taking more. The sweet dishes were served with the main course and the khichdi and other items were served after the shri khand which was weird. 
The overall experience was okayish. 
But compared to the Mani square branch of the food chain which I had visited(it's closed now) this is nowhere close. 
The level of hospitality of the staff at the Mani square outlet was also way better than this one.

Location : parkstreet beside the park hotel. 
Ambiance : very traditional.
Staff : an extra point for how they warmly welcome u and serve u .all wearing Rajasthani attire.
It was my bday treat to my sister . I got us coupons from nearby. 
The fooding experience is as follows : 
1stly we were given warm water by staff to wash out hands . Something new . Then started coming the food in a lightning speed ! üòùüòùüòù
1. Tamarind and green chutney and a tri coloured dhokla : green chutney was bang on and dhokla was cute looking
2. Paneer Patti's 
3. Daal bari choorma 
4. Aam achar and lasuni achaar : lasuni achaar I liked better.
5. Baby roti with ghee, poori and stuffed paratha. 
Stuffed paratha was gud . I had the whole thing with the green chutney . Yum yum.
6. Then came the veggie 
Paneer masala, Matt malai, Bengali alu sabji and one more:  the 1st two is worth a mention ! 
7 .then came the daal-trio : kadhi , Gujarati meetha daal and a moong daal. : The three tasted distinctly different and grt. 
8. Papad and butter milk. 
9. Khichdi and plain rice 
10. Baby version of Raj kachori : omg this was out of the world . Perfectly done with crispy sev, tamarind and green chutney with dahi . It was so tasty I had 4 of them ! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
11. In desert there was phirni and sooji halwa.
Phirni was not the thickend version but the liquidish one like the one made at my home . ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Halwa was authentic done with almond .I cant praise enough about it . perfect crunch and texture.‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üíû
Lastly we can again provided with warm water to wash our hands by the servers.

So the things one should look our for is : 
1. The chat 
2. The halwa
3. The veggies and the kadhi

I really have no reasons to give anything less than 5 but disappointed came in the form of water. They will give u a packaged drinking water and with all the tax will charge u 40 bucks for a ltr of water. Very very disappointing. 
Yes the pan and lassi is chargeable too but they mention that at least.

In spite of being a hardcore non-vegetarian I decided to have lunch here after hearing many good things about the food here and reading the rave reviews on Zomato. Went with my sister after getting a deal from Little App and went for lunch here yesterday. Ambience is good, the restaurant is neat and clean. The restaurant was filled with people during lunch time. Our thali was served as soon as we sat down. Service was impeccable. Swift and very polite. Every dish from the thali was amazing. Out of the many dishes my favourites were:
Dhokla
Paneer patties
Paneer masala
Matar Malai
Rajasthani Kadhi
Khichdi
Stuffed Paratha
Rice Firni
Sooji Halwa
Kachori Chaat
Looks like I listed almost the entire thali! üòÇ That's how delicious the thali was. Every item was made with care and was rich in taste. Their sooji halwa was the best I have ever had. The only point of complaint would be that they don't serve normal water to customers,you have to buy a bottle of water from them. Awesome thali,great service. The servers will make u eat till ur tummy starts hurting because it will be too full. Fully recommended!!!!!

A good place for all the vegans here visiting this city. You'll find some decent folks by your table. Make sure you have enough been given in your plate and only then should you leave for an outing 'cause you're going to miss this place :p Anyway, it's a restaurant chain (they have their places all over the country) and it seems they take their reviews seriously so let them know what you feel like. Finally, good service, good ambience, amazing food and delightful neighbourhood. 4 out of 5 because I want them to have some room for improvement no matter how excellent the service . Have a good time !

It's a big disappointment to our taste buds.i suggest those fellow  foodies not to torture their wallets as well as taste buds

Highly disappointed with the quality of the food served. Food was not all worth eating, they were tasteless and felt like vomiting. Waiter's were not at all trained how to serve food, they even threw food on the plate, didn't bother to ask while serving food. 
Not even worth to spend rupee 1 here. Roadside chat will be worth eating and they will even taste better.

We Indian's thali means a complete tummy filling meal with a lot of variety dishes. Talking about variety of dishes Rajdhani Thali is definitely a king over here.

Location : Its very easy to locate at Park Street Main Road just few steps from Park Street Metro.

Decorations : The restaurant isn't very big but very nice & clean decorative. Sitting are compact & very nicely set to fit maximum of people in there. Just after entering into the restaurant small decorations welcomes you to Rajasthan. Rajasthani music playing in the background all the time makes the experience more closer to that.

Staffs & Management : This is where they scores 5 star. Just from the beginning when you enter into the restaurant they will treat you like you're the Prince of Rajasthan. From serving the food to washing your hands, they will take care of every aspect possible. They are smart, dressed like Rajasthani & their behaviour towards you will make you go there again & again.

Foods : They served 4 kind of Roti, Kulchas & papar, with 4 kind of Chatnies & 3 starters. Also 4 kind of curry & 4 kind of dal with them. 2 kind of sweets & some other dishes that I don't know about. I was just trying to figure out their names, then I got confused where to start from. It was my first time exploring this kind of thali & if you are like me you will get confuse too. There were so many items & everything tasted really different. Although I have never been to Rajasthan neither I know anything about their food cultures, still there foods were very impressive to me. Don't be hesitate if you like a dish & want that more. There good staffs will make you full of it.

Pricing : Their pricing of thali is kind of average & that justifies when you're trying something different. The best part is they provide coupons through apps like Nearby & LittleApp.

Conclusion : I don't know how it is compaired to the real Rajasthani Foods, but what I can say is you will feel Rajasthan very well over here. Behavior & service of their staffs will make you feel like you're in home. Overall experience is pretty impressive & I do recommend it to give it a try.

My first experience in a vegetarian restaurant and it was beyond expectations. It's located just beside the park hotel in park Street, the party Street of the city. The name itself speaks of the ambience it has to offer. You will be welcomed by a Chandan Tika on your forehead. The ambience was as majestic and as royal as possible. The waiters are dressed in traditional Rajasthani ethnic. You will be amazed by a huge thali with almost 10-11 small bowls on the entire plate. The behavior of the staffs could not be more warm and welcoming. A total of 18-20 types of food will be served, out of which I tasted the maximum for the first time in my life!! It ranges from Dhoka along with salad and chatni, roti with 4types of sabji that includes ladies finger, paneer, chana. Then there is 3types of curry along with rice and khichri. In dessert we had malpua, fruit custard, papad. On the entire stretch of your meal you will have a constant supply of chaash, the best chaash I have tasted. On the whole it was the best experience I could have of vegetarian food in a city where people can't think of a meal without fish. A must visit for all the non-vegetarian in the city as well as the vegetarian.

I dig a good vegetarian thali ,and was really looking forward to the rajasthani-gujarati thali experience that Rajdhani promises . Sadly it didn't live up to my expectations, the service was good,but too speedy, not giving one time to savour the varied fare, the items on the menu were a little spicy for my palate,though might be good for someone else looking for spicy food. To sum it up, it needs to revamp it's menu and dig deeper to cater to the customer looking for a fulfilling and authentic thali.

Situated in a central location of the city like Park Street, this restaurant is a very classy place with a royal decor and lip smacking Indian food.
Being a non vegetarian I was at first a bit sceptic about visiting this place, since it's a purely vegetarian restaurant.
But the food was unexpectedly very good, more than what I expected.
The portion was wholesome and absolutely delightful, with a very nostalgic feeling.
The thalis are excellent!
In all, absolutely value for money. Will be looking forward for my next visit.

Situated in a central location of the city like Park Street, this restaurant is a very classy place with a royal decor and lip smacking Indian food.
Being a non vegetarian I was at first a bit sceptic about visiting this place, since it's a purely vegetarian restaurant.
But the food was unexpectedly very good, more than what I expected.
The portion was wholesome and absolutely delightful, with a very nostalgic feeling.
The thalis are excellent!
In all, absolutely value for money. Will be looking forward for my next visit.

A place for pure veg lovers, food is good enough. Simple interiors and fast service makes this one of the best place. Welcome is so different. Good quality, traditional Gujarati and Rajasthani dishes served. The thali is king size nd each of the items tastes authentic. I like the place ‚ò∫.

It was such a great experience.
Simple interiors and fast service makes this one of the best places to dine out.
You can eat all you want without burning a hole in your pocket.
Good quality , traditional Gujarati and Rajasthani dishes served with ghee and ghol.
For a non vegetarian like me it's rather strange to write such beautiful things about a vegetarian restaurant.... but then... this place just stole my heart.
Indeed got the feeling of a provincial king while dining here.
Happy and Contented

This is my first trip to rajdhani and I have come out with mixed feelings. We dined here  Saturday night   almost at breakneck speed. The restaurant was almost empty thanks to demonetization and service was super fast. By the time the husband had finished parking the rest of is were all served.  A bit of a  breather would have been nice. Food is good if you like marwari/ gujrati thali however lacks the spicy undercurrent of a good Rajasthani thali. 
The sweets are really good specially the halwa and warm jalebis. Good options for jains as well.

Visited yesterday only.. Ambience is average, Food is Average, not at all value for money. Not a buffet u r forced to eat whatever they provide. There is no menu card no defination anf name what u r having. The waiters dont speak only when u ask them loud then only they answer in some language that I guess no one knows. U will have something without knowing its price. U will get to know the price at the time of payment. Not at all value for money. You will tired asking them for food as the pots are really small and only one paneer item we had. No gulab jamoons. Only few jalebis. Not at all value for money guys. One time visit is ok. Its a typical Maora and gujju Resturant, not fot for Bengali. They will make u eat faster like anything to get rid of u as early as possible.  Sorry never visit again.

We ordered the thepla and poranpoli combos online today and the food was extremely disappointing. The theplas were really thick and the aaloo wasn't cooked well. The raita and achaar that was mentioned as part of the combo was missing. I have visited this restaurant before and i definitely expected the quality to be better.

Its high time people realise Rajdhani doesn't serve authentic food. This is my second time visiting a rajdhani restaurant (I visited hyderabad branch the first time) and yet again I am dissappointed. They should remove the Gujarati dishes immediately because nothing is authentic at all. Khamman had ginger garlic taste. Choorma was pathetic. I filled my stomach with the rotis and subjis which were very good compared to other things. I am not saying it's bad. but when you say rajdhani and authentic rajasthani food in one sentence, I bet you know nothing about rajasthani /Gujarati food. 
P. S this branch didn't serve in silver Platter too.

To the Restaurant Chain Management -

With great disappointment I am writing in this review here. I have dropped in mails at reachus@mirahhospitality.com too.

This last Friday evening me and my friend paid a visit to your well known restaurant Rajdhani Thali at Park Street, Kolkata. The ambiance was good though we were offered a place at the extreme corner of the restaurant. The food was good enough though taste of some of the dishes can be improved way better (will put a scrutinized review later on if I get a good and suitable response here or over mail). Overall we had a good experience till the incident which took place at the end which turned the table to a bitter one.

While serving the food one of the waiters there gave us two glasses of shakes, one Kesari Lassi kind of thing and another Kaccha Aam Lassi/Jaljeera kind of serving. While providing us with the glasses he didn't mention that those were supposed to be charged extra and are not included in the buffet thali. We didn't have any idea that those were chargeable since the previous Mani Square, Kolkata outlet of yours didn't use to provide such kind of shakes at the first instance and we visited this Park Street outlet for the first time. We didn't have a single sip of the drinks also. And since our seat was at the farthest corner of the restaurant and little separated with the main space we had only our adjacent table visible within our eye-sight. We after sometime figured out that those Lassis/drinks were not given in the adjacent table which triggered a sense of doubt in our mind.

When we enquired about the thing that whether the drinks are chargeable or not, one of the staffs said that he will be checking and will let me know the thing but on the contrary one the staffs came up with the bill. SOME OF THE MANAGERS ARE NOT AT ALL WELL GROOMED AND ABSOLUTELY DON'T KNOW HOW TO BEHAVE OR GIVE A PROPER AND COURTEOUS RESPONSE TO THE CUSTOMERS.

When we said that we were not informed about the fact that the drinks are chargeable the two managers (not sure but atleast they claimed to be managers) Mr. Sarvan Singh Chauhan and Mr. Pankaj behaved very rudely which made me be stern on my decision of not paying for the items, otherwise I guess I would have paid for them. Their rough way of interacting (specially talking about the nature of Mr. Sarvan) with us and way of explaining the thing were very irritating. Mr. Sarvan even said "You have to pay for the items and you don't have any other option". Like seriously? Manager of which restaurant on the earth tells a customer in that fashion?

The waiter didn't inform us about the thing at first place, we didn't have a sip of it and they we should pay for them? This whole thing could have been managed in a polite note too. I have been to so many posh and well-known 5 star hotels and restaurants but have never faced an incident and humiliation like this! Have never received this kind of treatment. The Waiter who served us the items later said that he informed us while serving but he didn't. It's a fault on this part and not mine. Another thing I would like to highlight in this context that Mr. Sarvan and Mr. Pankaj were constantly taking the side of the Waiter but was not believing us, the customers! It's not about money, 140 bucks extra is absolutely like nothing but the humiliation we faced that day is unspeakable.

When I asked Mr. Sarvan to give a call to the Senior Management and let them know the issue to solve the entire thing, he said he's only at the utmost designation of the restaurant chain and he's the one from the Senior Management, there's no one above him, just think about this! At last we decided to pay the price of one drink but when we let him know the decision he said "You pay for one, but can take the both". I mean what was that?! Please TAKE STRICT TO STRICTEST ACTIONS AGAINST Mr. Sarvan Singh Chauhan and Mr. Pankaj and please make sure that these kind of instances never ever occur in future. I wish to mention that we're not that kind of people and we're working at respectable positions at two different MNCs. How come he even the audacity to speak to us in that fashion? We felt very insulted and bad the way he interacted with us.

Please arrange some grooming sessions for your managers serving at the very outlet. Other than Mr. Sarvan and Pankaj behavior of the other staffs and waiters were good and very warm. Again, I wish to mention that I am the Admin of 5 Facebook pages having 30-35 thousand followers each, am a Super Foodie having over 400 followers and ranked among the top 200 Reviewers in Kolkata at Zomato and a Star Contributor at TripAdvisor. If I don't get a proper apology over mail and compensation for the insulting behavior we received I will have no other option than to put the very incident at all the social media platforms and ask others to share as much as possible. Further, if I don't get a proper reply I will also ask my friends, relatives, colleagues and all other acquaintances to refrain themselves from going to the specific restaurant and if there's a corporate tie-up with the the company I am working in, I will also report this incident to the Admin Department and try to make sure that the contract is not renewed at the end of the deal-tenure.

Request you to please look into the matter at the earliest. You all must be aware of the infamous Mocambo Restaurant incident which happened a couple of months back so thus keeping in view the power of social media and the kind of rich brand value you're having I will expect a prompt and satisfactory response from your end and maintain the "ek Khandani Parampara". Thank you!

Rajdhani on Park Street serves one of the best thalis‚Ä¶period. I know this because I am a thali junkie and a big fan of their recently re-launched branch in Dubai. I must say, I am as amazed at their consistency as I am of their delicious Gujrati-Rajasthani food; the branch here almost as good as the one we have in Dubai‚Ä¶almost. If you are a carnivore, do not be dissuaded by the fact that they are 100% veg; you will not miss the meat. Worth a detour.¬†

Waste NOT. Want NOT.

Firstly only what I can say is, stepped into Rajdhani feels like "I'm not in Bengal",awesome ambience and brilliant hospitality. Their interaction with each and every customer is remarkable. Now coming to "RAJDHANI UTSAV THALI", very colourful, brilliant varieties and the different  level of dimentions they put in was making them outperforming others. It is a pure veg Thali with variation and extention in taste as well, its basically start with hot to sour to sweet.The Keri panna and the Lassi both are completely brilliant ( these two items are extra and charge separate cost for this). Now coming to the main part, I'll not say too much on this but yes it is very reasonable & affordable. Coming to the hygiene part, definitely they are performing well on this. So, as a whole we can that they are one of the good food follower of TQM(Total Quality Management) and CRM(Customer Relationship Management).
But last but not the least, without them all this drama will never ever become so happen i.e. the "TIKA" n the "LADOO"...to know more about this, makes a visit with your family...you'll all enjoy!

I'm not that fond of veg food but trust me this is one of the best place to have lunch. Nice ambiance, great food, awesome service. I loved everything about this place. daal bati churma was so perfectly cooked that you can feel the crust while eating, dhokla was so soft, paneer curry was pure love. You just have to try this place at least once. One thing that I didn't like was the kheer which was a bit runny. Except that kheer part every single dish own my heart.

If overeating had a name, its name would be Rajdhani. This place in Park Street has a great atmosphere to it, the servers use hand signals to tell each other what is needed at each table, dish after dish after dish keeps coming to your table for you to eat.

I tried almost every single dish they served and had a great experience. Ambience is fun and energetic, service is of top notch quality and the food is lip smacking. For vegetarians who LOVE to eat an astounding variety of dishes, this place should be on the top of your list for the meal you're planning to go to.

The idea to taste veg food being a non veg typical bangali did not attract me at first,but the continous pleading by my friend landed me there.Being a foody I must say this place had definitely won my heart.
A very courteous welcome from the staffs to their decors to their thali served in the rajasthani style was absolutely a new experience to enjoy.
Though a bit overpriced but the food will definitely make you forget that.
Highly recommended for sumptous lunch or dinner as well as to enjoy one of the royal culture of India.

Well being a foodie I was not at all impressed by the taste this place had to offer.Came here with a lot of hope and was let down very much. I went to this place on a Tuesday and I m not sure that since this place has reduced price on Tuesday the taste was not good or is it the same everyday.. Well it will be a mystery because I am sure of not visiting this place again. This is only my opinion I m sure there are other people who will enjoy the food here.. But it did not exite my taste buds. Cheers.

Well..  I have not yet had the opportunity of visiting this place...  However a week back, I had veggie cravings for lunch and ordered food to be delivered to Medical College.  The food was delivered rather quickly - piping hot and neatly packed.  The elite lunch box was enough for 2 people.  It had around 8 small chapattis and some steamed rice, along with two dals, one paneer, one aloo dish and one other subzi.  Oh and also 2 delicious gulab jamun to satisfy your sweet tooth. However, gluttons that we are, we had also ordered a separate shahi halwa..  Dripping with desi ghee, it was melt-in-your-mouth pure indulgence. All in all, it made for a great working lunch. Moi recommend-eth!!!

Rajdhani thali..a pure vegetarian thali restaurant.Rajdhani opened it's new branch at park street near the park hotel.We were welcomed with a big smile and a puja thali. After putting tika we were guided to our seats. In no time a waiter came with a royal style jug of water to wash our hands.The waiters then, one by one ,served us those various mouth watering rajasthani dishes... Yum! The king size thali surely won our hearts..and bellies of course. Fast , friendly and efficient staff. Paid Rs.450 (incl taxes) for my rajasthani thali. We paid extra for the side drink ( we took aam panna) and sweet paan (betel leaf)...
I'm a hardcore carnivore..but this place definitely won my heart (and my vote)!!!

On the eve of navami I went there for lunch wth my family...i had read about them so much that I really-really wanted to eat out bt what their(food) hype ws not equals to what they served...i so wanted to try out rajasthani non-veg platter bt instead i had to succumb to their veg thali & as if it ws not the thing out of the 8 katoris of curry most wre made of curd. I actualy didn't expected this kind of food from them. The ambience & service ws fair bt to b true their food ws not upto the hype/buzz they hve created..

I have been visiting there quite often now and really like every dishes they serve. Even i order their new Monday meals in my office as  i am based quite a few minutes away from their park street branch . If you need to have outside food more often like me, and if you like veg too then rajdhani will fulfil your expectations. 
Reason being they actually serves variety of food with good taste.
Less oily food.
And value for money.

Overall a good place to be if you want to eat something different

Rajdhani is among one of my favorite place for full meal. So we went to Rajdhani Park street, the restaurant is not very big, but at a very prime location, near park hotel. It offers a variety of items, in terms of taste food were authentic and yum. Nice welcome and quick response from staff. They also serve jain food, which is really great for a person like me (no onion no garlic food requirements) as earlier Rajdhani in Avani mall does not had this facility. In terms of variety, though its was not as much as given in pictures but they were enough for one person starting with chaat, panerr pakora, two chatnis, curry, dal, two variety of veggies, three variety of chapatis, rice, kichri, papar, three variety of sweets, papad and chaach. It provides complete value for money. I really enjoyed my visit to this place and would love to visit it again.

I am so happy Rajdhani has opened up in park street area .It was there in Avani mall and Mani Square and I was disheartened to see that they have closed in both the places. It offers authentic Gujarati and Rajasthani thali and they serve food with so much warmth.The thali is king size and each of the items tastes authentic and it doesn't fail to impress hard core ¬†non vegetarian like us .
I am surely gonna hit this place soon.

A small place good for vegetarian. Purchased coupon for Thali and visited. Their contact number doesnt work. Service not great although they will keep on arriving at an interval. I think Bangalore Rajdhani is much better than here in terms on ambience. Here its mostly like a small restsurant. The exact charm of the concept was missing.Somhow waiters were doing their job without any expression and like machines. Apart from sweet options for which I rated 3, did not njoy their thali much. Not great for repeat visit.

Starting from amazing hospitality to good quality and most importantly good quantity of food how can one rate this vegetarian Rajasthani restaurant less than 5
There is no concept of menu cards so once you take a seat you will be immediately served with food
The prices are inclusive of taxes...

We went on 15th August so almost every dish was being served in tricolor theme.. I have tried Mumbai Rajdhani food so was expecting the same taste at Kolkata Rajdhani but was lil disappointed. Overall it was a nice experience as they were also giving crowns to everyone and some discount coupon..

Awesome experience with Rajasthani cuisine in form of thali. The ambiance was not up to the mark keeping in mind of the colors and decorations of Rajasthan. The dishes were great and service was fantastic even with the servers suggesting and explaining the way to eat ¬†the various dishes.
There were some irritant flies which am sure the management will do something about. Overall good value for money and experience available in Kolkata.

I hav visited Rajdhani wherever it opened from Hyderabad to Kolkata. For a change of taste from non-veg to veg it is a good option. But the taste is not the same as it used to be around 4yrs back when I had it fror the first time in Hyderabad. Now it has also become noisy. But surely it has still maintained its overloading Thali culture

We went to this restaurant on sunday evening. The food is good but ¬†not great. We liked ¬†dhokla, samosa, shrikhand and Jalebi was server hot and it was tasty. For a thali it was good. The negative part of this is it got too crowded and ¬†since we sat on the table which was on the middle of the room we felt surrounded by people.
we have eaten in Rajdhani in Axis mall ¬†which was not fine dine but a good place to eat. Here the restaurant was noise, waiters were not letting us eat in peace. They were too zealous to serve. It seemed the main motive was to force a person to eat in a hurry so that they can leave the table. the person picking up plate was also very eager. since we lingered over our food we felt if possible staff would have snatched our plate. We didn't finish eating and they got the bill. In short for the amount we spend today we could have gone to other veg restaurant even traditional one at least to have food in peace.

Rajdhani has landed up with their vast variety of offerings in the heart of the city.

##Location: On the bylane of park street main road you will find them after crossing The Park Hotel.

¬†##Experience: Being ¬†a pure non vegetarian Bengali I am not fond of veg food at all specially when it comes to having outside. However due to some constraints I had to have ¬†veg on that very day. ¬†While entering the place we have been welcomed with warmth which gave me a good impression about the place.
Coming to food we had thali which had 
consisted of:
Rice,Dal, Puri, Roti, Mix veg, Aloo, Daal bati churma.,Pulao, Dahi vada along with desserts Gulan Jamun, Jalebi and Halwa.
¬†
WIth that the Kesar LAssi was a pure bliss which we ordered separately.

With their amazing food they are decently priced too. I loved the fact that the service ensured every kind of hospitality which is a plus. Good job keep it up !! A must visit place for veg food in the city.

With Bengalis becoming adventurous with food a number of themed restros with different cuisines are coming up recently. However it's very rare to find a vegetarian restro which fulfills all the qualities of a fine dining as well as doesn't burn a hole in your pocket. I was quite intrigued by the concept of this restro and was eagerly waiting to tick this place off my wish list. Park Street is known for its non-veg restros. Well now it's time for it to boast of vegetarian restros as well. The whole concept of this place is very innovative yet with a minimalistic d√©cor which gives a classy as well as a cozy vibe. Basically I was concentrating so much on my food I hardly noticed anything else. Form the moment you enter till the moment you leave you will definitely feel like being in Rajasthan. Starting from the steward who welcomes the guests with a tika,the hand washing pot,the dishes everything seemed perfectly Rajasthani. Now let's talk about the items included in the thali. Here's a list of more or less of what i remember

Chanch
Salad( it's different from what we usually have so I request you not to give it a miss)
Dhokla with chutney
Gujia
Green chutney and garlic chutney 
Sabzi prepared by shredding cabbage
Aloo ki sabzi
Paneer ki sabzi
Kadhi
Spicy daal
Plain daal
Dal baati churma
2types of roti n puri with pure ghee
Papad
Yellow rice
A custard kind of thing with fruits in it( the best of them all according to me)
Halwa
Laddu
Jalebi with rabri and finally
Dahi vada
Flavored lassi and paan are items which are not included in the buffet and are separately priced.

You can have the dishes of your liking for n number of times. Each n every item tasted nice and different from what we normally have and therein lies the twist. Most of the restros try to mix n match the original cuisine with the bong cuisine to make it more appealing. But this restro is actually serving authentic rajasthani food which sets it apart from the others. So a big applaud for the team of Rajdhani thali. Overall

Ambiance -4/5
Food-10/5
Hospitality -4.5/5
Value for money - 5/5

PS - the prices mentioned are inclusive of the tax. Highly recommended. Pictures coming soon üòÄ

I have always enjoyed rajasthani food and tonight when it was time for pure veg food with in laws rajdhani was the first place that came to my mind. Nothing great about the ambience. They greet u with a chandan tilak which i liked and rajasthani folk music playing in the background. Service is fast since it is the thali way. I quite liked all the rajasthani dishes but didnt enjoy the mix of gujrati food though. That may be bcoz of the sweetness in it. The best was the kadi chawal and chola that i liked. The staff was also courteous. So many items that i obviously could not finish it all. Though i tasted a bit of everything. And reasonably priced i must say for the quality and quantity. All in all we came out happy.

If you want to save your stomach then Definitely a "Big NO". Been here for the first time.After I ate this noon.My whole family feels sick and disgusted with its quality.We have been drinking water and getting burps all the time.Moreover, they forcefully offered 'lassi' which was not part of the "Thali". All we came to know in the end when the bill was presented to us.

I visited this place few days back.  I was quite full and the concept of unlimited food was not appealing me, but my siblings were adamant. We went on a Tuesday which is the offer day at Rajdhani Thali.

I settled with a glass of aam panna while these two started the meal. I watched them for some time. Dhokla, aloo tikki, pakoda etc were making their way for the appetizers part. There were so many small bowls placed for the gravy veggies, curry , dal, aamras etc. Before I knew it, I was salivating. And no sharing is allowed. It is strictly a thali-system.

I overturned my thali and asked the server to serve me as well. There was green chutney, imli chutney , sweet mango pickle, Papad, falka, missi roti, khichdi, rice, buttermilk, dal , kadi, aamras, dal bati churma and loads of more food.

I think the time I visited coincided with the last leg of the mango festival going on.  

The experience is one of a kind  with washing your hands in copper vessel in a way the royals do to being served a menu fit for kings in a platter befitting the novelty. The bell to ring while exiting is also an interesting aspect.
The servers serve you till you can't eat anymore.

Taste wise the dal batti churma was good, the aamras was thick and fresh, the appetizers were nice. Main course wise many items tasted like home cooked food.
This is where I felt little let down, when eating out better taste is expected.

The experience was an enjoyable one, It was good enough to tempt me to overeat. But I would rate more to experience than the taste.

A thali means you are going to have loads of things from many tiny bowls and you will surely overeat. Yes Rajdhani thali has tasty food and loads of dishes and one tends to do just that. We called for the Elite Meal Box and were satisfied with the quantity they serve for just Rs. 250. Good wholesome lunch for 2 people.However the disappointment was  because of two reasons:
1) very very oily food.
2) Having tasted Rajdhani thali in other cities, was expecting the signature kadhi and not rajma and not the normal mix veg. Their specialties were missing.

Hoping they will bring in their specialties into the thali soon

The place has a good ambience. Enter the Rajdhani, u will be welcomed with 'chandan er tika' and the moment u will sit, the food starts... nothing to ask at all.
Sooo many items made my tummy full within a couple of minutes. Daal-bati-churma, Gujrati meethi daal, biscuit, khichri, malpoa are the best among all for me. With every food item the amount of ghee above them made them smell well. 
Nice dine out it was. And the staffs were very attentive. Good job!

Thalis are definitely something very attractive. You get to have this wide spread together in the most decorative and traditional way. Keeping this in mind, we visited Rajdhani as it specializes in thali serving. On a weekday, we visited this place located at park street. Though be it a weekday or weekend, a vegetarian or non vegetarian , all restaurants at park streets are forever crowded or over crowded. ¬†
Coming to Rajdhani was a delight for the way they served. A whole platter of various veggies stuffs from all over the country at one go. But somehow found this place over rated. The food definitely has variety but didn't found the taste too good. Serving was cold in our case, but people constantly came and went on asking, so there was no food limit in that way. The desserts were great!¬†

But would suggest people to visit this place to get a different flavour of of serving & platter all together.:)

Hence, always had a clue about the feel and the food which actually if pretty good. Writing this as I had never written a review for them. A must try the food is good at all the Rajshahi restaurants across India(at least in the once I have been to)  so just take some friends start digging.

Rajdhani welcomes you to Rajasthani dishes and a grand welcome by the servers. Buffet lunch is a really a pocket friendly one costing you Rs 225 per head only. 
Go empty stomach as the ghee served with every dish will really make it a heavy one. Eat slow. 
One will be served around 20-25 items and all are delicious with the taste of ghee. 
The service is really a swift one. Save a corner of your tummy for the desserts..they are really mouthwatering with jalebis, gajar k halwa and others. I could not have the last bit as it was really heavy for me. 
They will give you a grand service. Worth a visit.

üòû Sadly I couldn't finish d full course! 

They didn't allow me to share d food as they strictly maintained one person one thali. This I request d management to try to change. Give limited food amount in a thali so dat people don't waste.

I was attracted to this restaurant due to the hype that's been created around its service and authenticity of Rajasthani and Gujarati food... Bogus claims, all of them. My experience was pretty ordinary, from almost bland curries to stale fulkas, and waiting for more than 10 minutes after asking for my veggies to be repeated! Only a minority of the items tasted worthy of remembering. Forget the smiles and welcoming attitude on waiters' faces... They almost throw stuff on your plate in a hurry to get on to the next one!

Situated beside of Park Hotel. Full air conditioned and remain crowded all time.
They offer Thali at very affordable price. Quality is good but if you ask about quantity, then there will be a sure question mark in your mind. there are verious item you can see in one plate which is high enough to make you happy.
Don't get confused about the pic they are showing off. Actual item is less in quantity than the pic which is quiet disappointing if you are going there for the first time just only showing their price tag and pic.
But you can try food over there cz there r few restaurant out there in city that provide pure Rajasthani and Gujrati food. Food was good,¬† Ambiance is proper for a good family restaurant and stuffs are very quick in service.
Overall a good food experience.

Home. Once you enter the restaurant starting with putting the Tilak on your forehead, taking your seat at your table, pouring water over your hands for washing before and after your meal, to serving the food as if you were at home. 
The ambience is very nice and homely. People serving you the food are very quick efficient and will definitely make you taste everything once. 
They give you a tall glass of chass which is one of the best I have had so far. 
Food was mind blowing. Dal bati churma topped up with a dollop of ghee made the taste excellent. Every time roti was being served it was served with hot ghee or butter as preferred. The paneer and rajma was a delight to taste. There was also a peas mini kachori which was delicious. Each and every item served was magnificent. 
An experience here will surely make you feel like coming here over and over again.

Okay after a long research, we ended up here yesterday for lunch! And thank god we finally went....

This place is very easy to find.. From parkstreet metro sration it takes 5 mints walk.

First of all they greet you with a traditional Rajasthani 'Tika' so that you already feel like it.
We took the 'Thali'. Then they start serving. At first there are Chatneys.
There were 3 types of Chatneys, Then Khaman, Pakora, 3 Types of Sabji, 3 Types of Dal, Kadhi, Phulka, Thepla, Roti! Pheww!
And the very special Dal Bati Churma...
And for desert they served Sewaiya, Suji Halwa, Hot Malpua...
They put Generous ammount of Butter on the Phulka.
The food just keep coming... You can have all the food you want to... They keep asking you if u want anything...
The taste of the food was very authentic. From Chutney to Dessert , it was a plate full of heaven. We were quite full actually. A Tuesday Thali costs 250/- each. Which is quiet cheap actually...
The service was very impressive. The staffs were very well behaved and More over they treat you like their 'Maheman' (Guests).

So being a Non-vegetarian I could eat this veg Thali every day.

In desserts there were basundi,halwa, malpowa with rabdi. Lots of foods...

Me and my vegetarian friend was searching for a good place to have lunch, then suddenly saw this place. I heard about this place before, so we entered. The place was sober. Big steel plate with almost 10 small 'katori' was filled in 5minutes with different rajasthani food, and trust me, me and my friend was just staring and smiling to each other seeing all this. Each of the item was awsome. All were vej. I found this place best if you want to have veg foods. We ordered aam panna and lassi, though those were not convincing. But overall experiece was very good. and the price is also much less, for two of us, it cost near 950.

We ordered a mix thali where we get  aloo vada ,dhokla, dal bati churma as starter along with 4/5type of chutneys & salads after that in main course they served roti,rotla,puri,thepla,rice,khichdi,paneer gravy, mix veg,aloo sabji, rajma,2 types deal, kadhi,& chass. In desserts there were basundi,halwa, malpowa with rabdi. Lots of foods...
It's a awsum experience for me and my family.

Me and my vegetarian friend was searching for a good place to have lunch, then suddenly saw this place. I heard about this place before, so we entered. The place was sober. Big steel plate with almost 10 small 'katori' was filled in 5minutes with different rajasthani food, and trust me, me and my friend was just staring and smiling to each other seeing all this. Each of the item was awsome. All were vej. I found this place best if you want to have veg foods. We ordered aam panna and lassi, though those were not convincing. But overall experiece was very good. and the price is also much less, for two of us, it cost near 950.

From the moment I entered till the moment I left through that glass door, it was an entirely different feeling.... If you want to enjoy  authentic Rajasthani or Gujarati food just visit this place... I had Gujarati along with my friends and I will have to say I will give 10 on 10 for their service. Loved it..

A vegetarian's paradise, this is the place where you over eat unconsciously. The thali may come with tiny katoris but the sheer curiosity to taste them all and then order second servings of your favourite ones is what will make it harder for your to leave your table after the meal.

The Rajdhani Thali is one of the favourite vegetarian options for the city. And even if you are a non-vegetarian, then too you'll be able to enjoy the food thoroughly as I did on my recent visit to this place. On hearing a lot about this place I decided to explore for myself and so there I was. Speaking of the highs first... There are lots of options and each differ in taste, new variations are added to make sure regulars are not bored, waiters are very courteous and the ambience is homely. Few lows are there too like few dishes are too boring and predictable. Like the paneer was too North India-ish in taste than Rajasthani/Gujarati, few dals were not up to the mark and the quintessential dhokla could have been better. Nonetheless, the beverages are well coordinated with the meal and the price is very moderate. They have a special discount every Tuesday so I suggest that should be the day to visit this place.

You all have heard about this place as it has become a household name these days. The place springs up in summer season and offers huge discounts. I happened to pay a visit during one of those days when they skyrocketed their Usp by celebrating Aam ( Mango ) festival. The main attraction was Aamras offered exclusively with every Thali. What I like the most about this place is that Rajdhani is the pioneer of all the Thali themed restaurants in India and its 6 years since I have been trying this place at least once a year.
The Thali consists of all sorts of Rajasthani and Gujrati cuisines. I will mention some of the dishes and leave the remaining for you all to discover.
Dhokla, Mini samosa, Daal-baati- churma ( super tasty), Chaach, Aamras, Three sorts of bread : Chapati, Missi Roti, Bajra Roti, Aalo Sabji, Paneer Sabji, etc.
The Aamras was really tasty and although, it is a everyday delicacy for me, the dish is refreshing and notable.
The price is ok for one time visit on regular day but on Tuesday its Bingo. The rates are slashed by 50%.
Its a must try for all those foodies who haven't invited themselves to the world of rajasthani and Gujrati food.

P.s.- They have a separate preparation and serving for Jain food.

First things first.......you dont call this food rajasthani or gujarati food. No you really don't. I did not go to this retauarant to have "aloo tamatar ke sabzi", even my mom cooks a better sabzi than that. I travel very frequently to rajasthan and let me assure you their food is not so tasteless and bland. The minimum that we expect in a Rajasthani thali is Gattey ke Sabzi, ker sangri, pyaaz kachodi.... their were none. You get to eat Bhindi, Paneer ke zabzi and aloo tamatar in a so called authentic thali. Request the management to buckle up and improve big time on their menu before its too late. Visit if you have to but only on tuesday because the thali costs Rs.225 on tuesdays.

Imagine that yelp of joy you'd let out if you found your favourite thing that you thought you lost! And that's what happened to me when I saw that Rajdhani is back in the Kolkata arena! The Mani Square outlet folded, causing a wave of depression. But, now...life is good! What's so good here after all?! Well, for a start your food served at the most desirable temperature! And then when your jaws hurt from noshing down a truck load of food items, the juggernaut waiter is back to refill your plate! Glutton's heaven ain't so bad, eh! Oh, if you are strictly a carnivore, don't bother to step inside! You'll be left hangry and unsatisfied!

Had a wonderful time at this restaurant today.. They served authentic Rajasthani and Gujarati thali and it was really delicious. The staff behavior was really great and the service was as quick as possible. One one the most mentionable item was the Dal Bati Churma it was great. I had it for the first time. They also gave chanch and aam ras which made me remember my trip to Gujarat. And lastly the server was so good and his hospitality would make me visit this outlet again and again. It's an unlimited buffet and I am sure you will get out you tummy full.

Never been to a place like this, neither did i feel such hunger pangs till date. Plans were to go to peter cat but at 3pm on friday it was impossible for me and my friends to get through without waiting for at least an hour.
Hence we landed up to this place, its just adjacent to park hotel. Ambience and decor was nice, felt like a quick service restaurant get up. They only have one thali system in the sitting area which is in first floor. They serve rajasthani and gujrati both in a thali. Most exciting part is the number of chutneys they serve in your thali, each of them is perfect. First they give starters which are dal bati churma, samosa and one more item ( unsure about its name). They have options of rice, khichdi, fulka, thepla n puri. You can have it all if you wish! They give three types of dal and a kadhi. Side dishes are alu subji, matar paneer, chana, gobi ki subji along with salad. In dessert they serve aamras, fruit custard. There is plenty you cant just have enough. Service is nice, all the servers are informative and knows menu well and really welcoming. Did i forget to mention they serve chaas aswell?
Well they also have sepetate beverage menu. All in all if you are hungry and want a fulfilling indian lunch then go for rajdhani thali its too good and affordable!

One of the things that I love about Rajdhani is the incredible dedication of the brand to make sure you eat till you are about to burst. I kid you not. The mangolicious thaali is a major test for dedicated eaters, and I love the way it panders to a plethora of taste buds.

I have been to a couple other Rajdhani locations. I like this one on Park Street slightly better than the rest.
Service is perfect, food is varied and plentiful and delicious and there is nothing really to complain about.
They keep changing things up while maintaining the core things like dal baati churma roti kadhi constant. 
Initially I was annoyed at the meagre quantities they serve when you arrive. I have realized that they serve you less to taste the different things and then there is no stopping them from filling everything up till you ask them to stop.. it take about 5 times at least

I have heard a lot of good reviews of this place from both vegetarian and non vegetarian lovers. So decided to get their elite thali delivered to office via zomato. Delivery was on time. 
The packaging is done really well and it created a lot of excitement. 
But after opening the containers I was sorely disappointed. 
The elite thali  contains 2 starters 8 rotis, 4 sabzi, 1 rice, 1 dal,1 papad, 1 sweet, 1 salad ( 3 slices of cucumber), 1 pickle ( ketchups are pickles apparently) and mint.

The starters are decent. One was a methi stater and the other was a deep fried one. Small in size but tasted good.
The rotis are small and freshly made with ghee or butter smeared on top of them. Soft and nice.
3 out of 4 sabzis were made in the same super oily gravy. It seems they make one main gravy and add  different stuff in them to make different dishes. All the sabzis had a big layer of oil on top and seasoning was very less. 
The first one was of potatoes which were a bit hard. 
I cannot decide whether the 2ND or 3rd one was worse. The 2nd one had raw chopped tomatoes and garnished with bhujia. . The 3rd had boiled chawli and without seasoning it was yuck. 
The last one was a paneer dish and it was okay to taste. The rice quantity and quality was good. The dal was thankfully okay and not mixed with the same gravy. The papad was crunchy and it had seasoning!!
The gulab jamun was a super disappointment. Cold and rock solid!
Hopes got crushed very badly. Not sure whether I will visit for the famous thalis that they have now.

Rajdhani is a must visit for every vegetarian foodie. They had opened up in Mani Square Mall but closed down about a year back. But again now they opened an outlet in Park Street adjacent to Olypub to the delight of all foodies.

D√©cor: Nice simple warm setting with comfortable seats and nice big tables. Well lit and the waiters are dressed in traditional attire.

Food: Lovely authentic Rajasthani , Gujarati food. Quality is good and since it is a unlimited thali quantity is not an issue . The starters are nice. The Dal Bati Churma is a must have. They serve 3-4 types of sabjis , curry and Dal. Along with different types of rotis, rice and khichari. For dessert they have jalebis, moong halwa and gulab jamun.

Service: Too fast and it seems they want you to finish fast. I hope that the management will keep these little things in mind as such hurried service spoils the entire experience.

Pocket pinch for two persons is 850+ really worth it .

Though I am not a vegetarian but I still liked the food.

You have to be really hungry before coming here! Rajdhani serves an unlimited thali containing almost twenty or more rajasthani delicacies. They'll welcome you with a warm smile and bring lukewarm water to wash your hands. And then they'll start the food extravaganza! From 4 kinds of breads to rice and khichdi, three kinds of daal,4-5 vegetables,salads,namkeens,papad, desserts, buttermilk and a lot more! Everything will be refilled as many times as you want. Quality of food is pretty decent.

We have visited Rajdhani Thali on 02/06/2016. Though we are pure non vegetarian we decided to take a visit here after hearing many good reviews. But unfortunately we were totally disappointed . I am mentioning few points to justify my concern.

1) First of all their special mango thali concept is totally making fool of customers as no mango item is there except one liquid mango flavored liquid and that one also was smelling like Frooti/Slice.

2) Only two vegetables were prepared (Paneer Masala and Cauliflower curry). It was really hard for us to find paneer in masala. Cauliflower was good.

3) Daal bati churma was very ordinary . Even I have tasted it better in many other roadside restaurant.

4) Service was good initially but once it got crowded service became worse. Some point we had to call waiter for each dish.

In brief we all are very disappointed after visiting this so called heritage restaurant. They really need to improve their food quality a lot.

The food is so lovely that you cannot stop yourself from going here more than once .
The variety and the taste is completely Rajasthani.
The food does Justification to its name .
I had the Rajasthani thali here and honestly the food quantity was too much for me .
I could not really complete everything. So I suggest this to people with a good appetite ! 
All the vegans of Kolkata has a new destination :)

Rajdhani Ek khandani parampara. Good to sneak it into a pure rajasthani thali.....I love the mewar essence in everything... its a huge huge thali they will offer. The service is very typical thali style service. Everything was well but the food. In thali i can say may be 20 to 25 items have served and i can assure you i find might be 1 or 2 dish was taste wise good. The dal bati churma was taste like any other day footpath dal with no salt and sugar. Ghee was similar to soya oil, no essence atall..
More all less i m disappoint over food quality. They have to improve to grab the customer down here.

It's not everyday you rate a restaurant a perfect 5.This is a vegetarian's paradise.I visit Rajdhani quite often and every time I go home with a full belly and my heart filled with joy.Its an easy to locate place located on the parkstreet main road near the Samsung showroom.Their hospitality is top-notch as they treat you like your grandma by forcing you to eat more and more.Their way of welcoming is amazing¬† as they apply tilak on your forehead.I usually go on Tuesdays as they offer their thali on a discounted price of ‚Çπ 225 which is really bang for the buck.I assure you won't get anything like this at 225 bucks anywhere in Kolkata.The restaurant is always filled with people who come here to enjoy with their families or colleagues.

Now coming to the food.It comprises of Gujarati and rajasthani delicacies.The menu changes everyday there.In general they welcome you by serving you chaanch.It is followed by lipsmacking vegetarian starters like dhokla and cutlet.After the starter comes the disappointing vegetables.Yes the unsatisfactory part of the restaurant is their vegetables.Usually they serve rajma,bhindi,paneer and ALU or gatta.Now comes the USP the amazing kadhi and meetha dal accompanied by ghee laden fulkas and rotlas.Make sure you ask them for jaggery which tastes amazing with the kadhi and roti.it is followed by dal baati choorma which is a must try if you want to experience authentic Rajasthani food.Just like a movie is judged by its climax,for me a restaurant is judged by its desserts and oh boy you won't be disappointed.The moong dal ka halwa is way to organsmic to describe.its way too heavenly

To conclude it is every vegetarian's wet dream.Must try item:dal baati choorma,meetha dal,kadhi and the lip smacking halwa.happy fooding :)

Went to this place recently on a friend's recommendation and i actually found it horrible. Nothing is good about it. They serve this huge thali were you can find none of thw food actually tasty. On top of that their service is too bad. You have to tell them a thousand times to get more which i have never faced in any other restaurant though. Also the a panna and kesar lassi are chargeable and even the paan. There are far better veg restaurants than this atleast. I would personally recommend not to visit it.

It's not everyday you rate a restaurant a perfect 5.This is a vegetarian's paradise.I visit Rajdhani quite often and every time I go home with a full belly and my heart filled with joy.Its an easy to locate place located on the parkstreet main road near the Samsung showroom.Their hospitality is top-notch as they treat you like your grandma by forcing you to eat more and more.Their way of welcoming is amazing¬† as they apply tilak on your forehead.I usually go on Tuesdays as they offer their thali on a discounted price of ‚Çπ 225 which is really bang for the buck.I assure you won't get anything like this at 225 bucks anywhere in Kolkata.The restaurant is always filled with people who come here to enjoy with their families or colleagues.

Now coming to the food.It comprises of Gujarati and rajasthani delicacies.The menu changes everyday there.In general they welcome you by serving you chaanch.It is followed by lipsmacking vegetarian starters like dhokla and cutlet.After the starter comes the disappointing vegetables.Yes the unsatisfactory part of the restaurant is their vegetables.Usually they serve rajma,bhindi,paneer and ALU or gatta.Now comes the USP the amazing kadhi and meetha dal accompanied by ghee laden fulkas and rotlas.Make sure you ask them for jaggery which tastes amazing with the kadhi and roti.it is followed by dal baati choorma which is a must try if you want to experience authentic Rajasthani food.Just like a movie is judged by its climax,for me a restaurant is judged by its desserts and oh boy you won't be disappointed.The moong dal ka halwa is way to organsmic to describe.its way too heavenly

To conclude it is every vegetarian's wet dream.Must try item:dal baati choorma,meetha dal,kadhi and the lip smacking halwa.happy fooding :)

Went to this place recently on a friend's recommendation and i actually found it horrible. Nothing is good about it. They serve this huge thali were you can find none of thw food actually tasty. On top of that their service is too bad. You have to tell them a thousand times to get more which i have never faced in any other restaurant though. Also the a panna and kesar lassi are chargeable and even the paan. There are far better veg restaurants than this atleast. I would personally recommend not to visit it.

I have visited Rajdhani outlets in many other cities but the Kolkata outlet turned out to be a dampener. The following are the reasons:

1. On entering the restaurant, no traditional welcome with the tika and the arti thali. Rather the gentleman at the reception did not even guide us to the table. Did not expect this kind of experience in such a well established fine dining restaurant.

2. The restaurant area was covered with lot of flies. At one point I got a feeling that I was eating at a roadside joint as time and again I had to keep the flies away from the food.

3. In other Rajdhani outlets I have seen servers communicating amongst themselves with hand signs. But here some of the servers were literally shouting to their colleagues. Not a typical Rajdhani experience.

4. In all other Rajdhani outlets I have seen that at the time of exiting, one of the servers insist to beat the drum at the gate. At this outlet, the man at the exit never told me about the drum. 

So overall it was neither a Rajdhani experience nor a fine dining experience. I may go back to Rajdhani again but not to the outlet at Park Street.

- Nothing is good here except service.
- Even on weekends, the choice of items are less.
- Drinks like aam panna,kesar drink are chargeable outside the thaali price.
- Daal baati churma was unexpectedly very ordinary and same with dhokla and malpua.
- Gatta sabji/aalu sabji/paneer were good but other Rajasthani sabjis like sangri ki sabji etc were missing.
- Though we went during the mango festival, except aamras there was no dish prepared with mango.

Went to this Small looking yet Spacious and Quite Big Outlet just beside Olypub in Park Street yesterday.. Was greeted with Kesar Sharbaat, Aam Panna and Dahi Ka Ghol.. Their Premium Veg Thali in Weekend ( Dinner ) is a Huge One and Consists of 12-15 Various Dishes and Chutney out of Rajasthani, Gujarati and Marathi based Cuisine.. 7 types of Daal out of which the Sambar Daal and the Urad Daal was the Best.. Puri, Poha, Khaman Dhokla, Puran Puli, Chole Ka Sabzi, Khichdi, Ragda Pattis, Aam Raas and the Samosas were the Ultimate..... I just loved it especially their way of Authentic Serving and the Cuisines of Veg.. Interiors were Very Nice but Staffs need to be a little more attentive.. AC Cooling was a bit disappointing but overall was perfect and a must visit place for your dinner..!!!!!

The problem with Rajdhani begins with its standard menu itself. What it does is to stick to the most popular, safe, non-risque  dishes known to people outside Gujarat and Rajasthan, and then make things worse and cook quite a few of them half as good as the authentic ones. 

So, instead of killer dishes like the Undhiyo from Gujarat, and Kaer Sangri, Gatte Ki Sabzi and Masala Bhindi from Rajasthan, what I had was an extremely boring dish of wilted bhindi, a mild curried gujrati aloo sabji, and two standard chole and paneer-gajar ones. It is a sin to serve that Bhindi dish when the amazingly crisp deep fried Masala Bhindi has already been invented !! 

The lentil section was better - the Gujarati Kadhi,  much tangier and lighter version that the gingery Punjabi Kadhi, was my favourite. Together with the Kathaiwadi Khicdri, a much goey-er form of comfort food that the Bengali version, was like reliving memories of my time in Gujarat. The Gujarati Dal was sweet like it should be but the marwari dal lacked the freshness of corainder and squeeze of lemon.

Of course, there was Dal Baati - which was ordinary, esp the Dal. The Churma also lacked the richness of a ghee based dessert.

The only Farsan was some innovative version of multi coloured Dhokla, which I disliked, primarily because it converted a classic Farsan into a semi-sweet dessert  (with strawberry flavours and candied peas). And for a thali that comes for nearly 500 bucks, serving one (and botched up) Farsan, is pretty sad, given Farsans form such an integral part of Gujarati Thali. Balaram Mullick serves much better Khaman and few branches of Haldiram serve really tasty cocunut stuffed khandvi. 

And if the standard thali was such a disappointment, we went during the 'Aamras Festival ' and the Aamras smelled of mango syrup, instead of kesar, adding more woes to my already disappointing meal.

In verdict , Avoid.

WE went to Rajdhani on a Tuesday... so what was most exciting the price.. well the resturant was moderately decorated.. ambience is so so... and the staffs are good.. but serving sttle is not satisfactory... what was kinda unique was the typical rajasthani swagat by tilak...
Well coming to the food... dishes r so so.. nothing extra ordinary to us.. those who are omnivorous... what liked about there food was dhokla, dal bati churma... they r really tasty... and then the deserts... malpoa with rabri, strawberry flavoured halwa and aam ras... other than that whatever the served.. is ok type...
So its a suggestion.. if u wanna visit.. u must go on tuesday

The ambience is good and pricing is justified. There was a huge rush as it was a Sunday evening but we enjoyed to the fullest... The varieties don't end and almost every dish has its own special flavour. Both the dal, especially the Gujarati Dal is a delicacy. The deserts are traditional but yum . Overall a great place to be with family when u really need something filling. The only option left after the food was to have a good sleep.....

Want a delectable experience of a cocktail of gujrati and rajasthani thali???Then u must visit the rajdhani outlet at park street beside the samsung showroom.A royal treat indeed....both in terms of hospitality and ambience. The men serve in traditional rajasthani pagri and attire.Of course the food is royal too...starting with dhokla,samosa,chutney, salads ,aachar, chhach they just keep on filling the katoris and thali....With near about 14 to 15 veg side dishes and khichri roti puri n a special mini naan (can't remember its' name)u just can't stop munching.They would come to you again and again with all those items till you surrender. Hold on...The sweets and desserts require a special mention as they r really unique.Specially the aamras.Being a die hard non veg patron it was really hard for me to think of having an all course veg lunch.But that day I discovered a vegetarian me.....!!!Would have given 4.5 but still I'm a non veg patron...hence 4.0...4.5 from all my veggie pals.
N.B.-Go on a Tuesday as the thalis are the cheapest on that day...@inr 225+taxes.Its a real deal then..(obhiously for veggie fans)

We had been at Rajdhani Mani square, Bangalore and Park Street.First time we visited Park Street on very next day to Diwali. The Ambience is Good . Even service and Food was Good like the name itself . But yesterday I had been their for dinner . The special prized thali was very poor in quality and I had a very bad experience .I am not Jain but don't like to eat garlic so I requested them to serve Food with potatoes and onions. But i was stunned on seeing the Food items. First of all sabjis and Dals not properly Hot. Paneer sabji was stale and Papad sabji was too much salty and Dal was like watery and above all there was no aloo sabji . The Roti and Puri service was very poor and we have to ask 2-3 times for roti. Previously we had a very good experience at Park Street Rajdhani but sorry to say yesterday we are highly disappointed . 
                      But some of the dishes like Kesaria lassi, Dal Bati Churma , Malpua , Kadhi Khichadi are very Good. Aam Ras is just like synthetic Rus but ok . 
                      I just want to say if they don't afford the half price than why they compromise with their quality and Good will .

I have order the thali for the price 175 . then quantity was not enough for one. The roti are too small. The dal in the thali is not up to mark. It also not full given. They need to check whether all item in thali need to fully serve. This is missing . I have order for the party in office . everybody thumps down for the thali.

I previously reviewed this restro for home delivery food, and now i am going to put my views on dine-in experience. It was sheer horrible, the food was almost served, thrice i have asked for water but water was not served until i shouted at the restaurant manager about the bad behaviour and sheer ignorance of the waiters. After that the service was somewhat better. Being an old customer of this restaurant i realised complete change in the management, from polite, humble, enthusiastic staff to rude, unwilling to help the guest staff. The restaurant waiters need to inform while serving the items on the plate, but it did not happen. I hate to taste everything to realise that which food item is what. And something which i was allergic to was served in as a started. I could not understand until i ate it(only if they would have informed me about the food, like they use to previously i would have to go through allergic reaction). I got soo angry with food served not hot not cold or mildly warm, that i just stop eating and asked for the bill. The waiters did not even asked me n my mom for the rice or khichdi, which was served to others(its a part of the thali). The food the tasteless, maybe because it had less salt and food was not hot. The bill was delayed the service was highly delayed. I am really upset with this restaurant since the staffs changed. I will never in my life will visit this restaurant anymore. My previous review is attached as photo. I am highly disappointed with the staff attitude and behaviour. The thali which i did not eat due to sheer ignorance of the staff and extremely bad behaviour, highly delayed service, its image is attached with this review. Me and my mom both left the food.

whenever u visit a chinese restaurant or a rajasthani restaurant for example; you get chinese and rajasthani food consecutively which is modified to meet the bengali taste buds...bt this place provides completely unmodified pure rajasthani food...the welcome is overwhelming with the aarti and tika...the buffet spread is luxurious and the best part is everything is served on the table including the wash bowl...yes the food is purely vegetarian bt this place will leave you amazed to see the variety of vegetarian dishes available...the daal bati and churma,rajma chawal,ghee roti puri aloo dam,paneer,aam ki sabji,khichdi,aamras,kesar lassi,fried malpoa as dessert at d end and many more items are pure delicacies...once everyone should visit this place including the non vegetarians

Great ambience, super friendly stuff and lip smacking food - these 3 things define Rajdhani for me. Service is fast, you are served within minutes of being seated and innumerable types of salads, chutneys, daals, curries, rotis, rice, khichdi and sweets follow in quick succession. I also love the fact that the stuff here is very persistent and they make sure you taste all the items over and over again. Thumbs up to Rajdhani for serving delicious and healthy food.

I was recently being invited by Khandani Rajdhani to try out their famous Rajdhani Thali and some Mango loaded food as they are presently having the Aamilicious Festival.

Been to this place twice, in its first week at Park St and last Sunday (1st May) and found the standard has fallen very significantly. The menu had lot of variety but the taste was below par; service and sequence of serving items left much to be desired. As a vegetarian, I had suggested everyone to join here and was left ruing the decision !!!

It appeared that the Stewards were trying to serve everything and serve it fast so that people would gobble up and leave; maybe it was because the first floor was already booked. But we were served Dhokla and the Pakora when we were through with three chhappatis half-way through the meal. Papad was served right at the end as an afterthought and Puri were offerred when four of us had already closed off. Mango puree/ aamras served had more of curd flavour and taste of uncooked ambi and the chutney served tasted bland. The Chaach served was very sub-standard and below par even by the earlier standard of Rajdhani itself.
¬†

One indulges in a "thali" experience for the varied tastes and amount of items served but the best part of it is the service and enthusiasm of the Stewards. Though reasonably priced for Park St standards, this place is recommended only for a one-time experience.¬†Or maybe it was a momentary lapse of reason.

Unlikely to make another visit unless I have no choice available whatsoever!

Rajdhani is simply one of the best place to visit in Kolkata. From the way they welcomed us to their food, it is very special, and the Aamalicious fest is the cherry on the cake. It is a place worth it. And for once my plate was not empty. Also their gestures are too good. Loved it.

Got to try some new Rajasthani dishes like Aam ki Laungi, Mango Kadhi, Chunda and the refreshing kairi panna.

The place has a pretty good ambience! The staff is very courteous and the quality of food is really good! The smell of the 'ghee' will tickle your senses! The 'amras' is really good! The butter milk served has a very distinctive taste! The 'malpua' was too leathery and quite small, thus missed the fleshy taste! Overall it's a pretty good place for authentic Marwari food. But the only demerit is that the food is served way too fast!

For traditional Rajasthani thali, this is the place to be. The service is amazing and the staff are very efficient. The Thalis are wholesome and almost all items are excellent. Make sure you go with an empty stomach to eat all of the items!
They have the Aamlicious Festival going on presently so mango lovers must try it out!

It's a Thali style veg food serving Restaurant with the option of no garlic, onion , I had enjoyed their food in Manisquare outlet some time ago and this time I tried food at it's Park Street outlet. Ambiance is better then it's Manisquare outlet but food quality is average and deteriorating and it doesn't satisfy my taste buds, management should take care of this. Anybody want authentic Rajasthani style food can visit this outlet. Service is really good.

Been to this place several times when it was located in Mani square mall, and i found the place pretty good. Well, they've shifted to Park Street now, and I'm glad to say that they've maintained their standards. They greet you old Rajasthan style with a tilak on your forehead. Then a waiter comes with warm water for you to wash your hands. They have a standardised menu which offers a variety of Indian breads, different kinds of dal and sabji, papad and sweets, all served hot (except for the sweets of course). The quality of food is standard. It's the experience which these guys serve. To be honest, it's not somewhere I would keep visiting on a regular basis simply cause of the lack of a variety of the menu. However, I would like to go back with different groups of friends just for the experience. Decently priced, this place is recommended for all veggie lovers.

Brand has detoriated a lot after closing at mani square but this outlet is good enough to build the brand once again if they can provide varieties and changes every week or month. Ambience is ok and so is food

I had already been to their Mani Square outlet. Although I am not a vegetarian, I like veg now and then. Tonight, I got a chance to go there also since all the other park street restaurants had Pujo Pandal like queues.

Food:
I liked their Dhokla and Samosa and Aloo Tikki Chat. I wish but I can't name most dishes. There were too many. I'll just upload pics but I must say they were all delicious whatever they were. Except perhaps one Aloo dish which was a bit undercooked. We had ordered extra aam panna which was great too. But, we wouldn't have ordered if we knew a chaach came with it. The shrikhand perhaps was too sweet but the jalebi was awesome.

It all came up to be 900+ for 2 people including tax.

Might not go there often due to lack of veg friendly friends, but this was a satisfying dinner also because the people were amazing and kept on pushing for the hot and fresh dishes. I like that kind of happy ambiance.

When Rajdhani was in Mani Square (4th Floor), I visited there once and loved the experience and the food. This time I went to their new Park Street outlet with my sister, mother and brother.
We entered @4.10pm, they said their buffet is from 12-4pm. So my brother exclaimed "we are just late by 10mins". Hearing this, the person reacted "but we stop the buffet from 3.30 itself"!!! We were shocked to hear this but still I wanted to try their a-la-cart√© as my previous experience was good. We got a table and then began my disappointments coming.

The menu they gave us for a-la-cart√© was of evening snacks like rajkachori, dahi kachori, chole bature....there was no rice aur roti item, not even a side dish. We desperately ordered 2 plates chole bature and 1 plate dahi kachori and then began the eternal wait.
Waited for too long to lose her temper, my sister asked them "at least you can give us some water? We are sitting here for atleast half an hour!!". Hearing this someone reluctantly asked another person to serve us some water, that person was too busy standing at a place, so be passed the duty to another person. Finally after 45mins of entering that restaurant, we got some drinking water. Food was yet to come.

After asking and pleading several times, they served our order 1 plate each (it was over an hour till then), another plate was yet to come. We engorged our food as we were pretty hungry for our lunch @5pm. After finishing it, we had to wait for another 15 minutes and ask the waiter 3 more times for the remaining order. In the mean time, our water was finished but nobody cared to refill the glasses. So another round of pleading and requesting followed.

When we came out of that restaurant at 6.10pm in the evening, it was the most horrible dining experience for me in this city. The most embarrassing moment for me as well, because I bragged so much about this place to my family and praised them so highly. If felt like a nightmare to my family. Will never visit this place again in my life.

Divine is the word which comes to mind when I recall the thali I had at Rajdhani. The items just kept coming and never seemed to stop. There came a point when the waiter himself had to search for space on my plate to serve me something. On a serious note, the food was amazing. Traditional Rajasthani and Gujarati stuff well made and very well served. The dal bati churma is by far the best I've ever had. If you love Rajasthani food, hit this place right away. If you don't, hit it anyway. Be rest assured you will come out highly satisfied. Even I myself am not a fan of Rajasthani food but this experience was something else. Highly recommended.:)!

Went there with family.

Was four of us with one baby.
Welcome was done in the traditional manner by applying tikka to all the guests.

We were provided with high chair, which was in good condition.

We ordered for four Thalis as we were aware of the menu beforehand.

Quality of food 3.5/5
Service 3.5/5
Cleanliness 4.5/5
Ambience 4/5
Value for money 4/5
Overall 4/5

I have cut a few marks on quality as initially we were served dals that weren't hot at all.
After calling the manager (wasnt available that day) Captain came to our table and helped us and covered up nicely.

Everything in the next round was brought fresh and hot.

Sweets taste very good and authentic.
Malpua and Basundi were really well prepared.

I highly recommend sweets to everyone.
Chikkoo halwa was something really unique and well done.

Go there if you want to indulge in heavy meals. And a traditional experience

Rajdhani used to be situated on the fourth floor of Mani Square where I gave it a visit 3-4 times,now it is situated at park street near kusum rolls. If you want to have authentic Rajasthani food this place will surely meet up your expectations. The ambience was better at the previous branch and the food quality has deteriorated a little still I love their food. Though I am not a veggie or dal lover I love the items served here. The offer a huge variety in items and they serve in thali package only. Service is very prompt and staffs are really good. Price is cheap and it is cheaper on Tuesdays. Overall from the handwash to ringing the bell...the experience was good.

This is the first time I've set foot in a Rajasthani restaurant. Although the name gives the impression of something grand, I found the interior & ambience very ordinary. The staff were friendly & the service was good. While serving they told us the name of each item & what it is. There were varied items & for a first timer it's difficult to remember the names. The capsicum chutney was very tasty. Liked the Dalbati Churma (which I've heard so much about). Paneer was also not bad but the kichdi & the peas pulao were terrible. Loved the small rotis with dollops of ghee. The best were the small Malpuas & Chiku Halwa. The Soda Shikanji was also very refreshing. Being a pickle lover, loved the different kinds of pickle served with the Thali.
Overall, the experience was pleasant & unique. Would love to visit the place again.

Best location in Park Street, serves you the most authentic rajasthani and gujarati dishes..Its kind of a place where you would like to come with your family and have a feast..very spacious both ground and first floor, the service was excellent. They'll keep on suggesting the items which you might not have tasted and will never let yout plate become empty until you are full. One of my foodie friend ordered some special kind of gravy and the cook there didn't waste any time to present it well before 15 minutes- such is their commitment to serve people..Its the only place where you won't regret the absence of non-veg meals. Make sure you walk for 10 minutes after eating from here else you will have problems :)

Place was good looking but not matched with the name Rajdhani. It was designed well but somewhere missing that Rajdhani touch but still looks nice. It was quite big restaurant with two floors to dine in. Ambitious was amazing and hospitality was good as well. Staff was well behaved and friendly. Service was good. Now you can also enjoy desi snacks in between meal break during 3PM to 7PM. Come to food and beverages they were true desi, home like cooked and very tasty. Today I had a Maharaja lassi which was perfectly made with lots of nuts, dry fruit and some kesar and it was very delicious. In snacks I had a daal baati churma in which daal and churma was very delicious feels like made in home by mom. Baati size was little small but they were cooked in desi ghee and they also tastes very good. All menu dishes were full money realized. Great desi snacks and dishes outlet always a amazing experience here. Totally loved it. Highly recommended to all.

We have so many variety and diversity in the food that is available on our beloved city . Amidst the chinese, mughlai and continental joints that are thrown in almost every nook and corner of the city we have very few exceptions . These exceptions are supposed to divert us from our usual dining experience and treat us with some new exotic flavors . 

Rajdhani thali is one such exception . Although the dishes donot scream of exotic flavors bug they are bound to give you a unique vegetarian experience that will be worth the time spent .

We went there today for the buffer thali . At first we were served the maharaja lassi, which we thought of as a complementary drink but unfortunately ended up paying for it . But we didnot mind as the lassi was one of a kind . Thereafter we were served : -

Starters : -
1. Dhokla 
2. Salad and chutney 
3. Dal bati churma
4. Dahi vada 

Main : -

1. Note saaag
2. Butter paneer
3. Alu ki sabzi
4. Chole 
5. 3 types of daal
6 plain rice .
7. Khiv

Deserts : -
1. Halwa 
2. Dahi
3. Jalebi
4 . papad 
 
I was sceptical in the beginning as how the flavor of these dishes will be . Being a Bengali we are used to have our food tad less spicy , with a lot of sugar . But the food was a huge surprise for us . The flavor was perfect and all
 the dishes were simply yummy . 

Special mention goes to the dhokla , paneer and sweet dal which I really liked . I had a lot of jalebis in the end so I ended up being very full . The desert was top notch .

Now I was going for a 5 star review but right at the end they were having network issues so the POS machine was not working . It wasted a lot of time and we ended up paying in cash anyway so that was a downer . located just beside olypub , this restaurant is an escape from your day to day dining experience . Go for the veggies sometimes and you will surely not regret it.

Located at the heart of park Street. A pure vegetarian restaurant. Keep in mind that this is not typical Bengali vegetarian restaurant, rather a Rajasthan and Gujarat flavour.

They serve mainly the buffet in thali style.

Food are quiet good... Gobi, paneer, ALU sabji, vada, dhokla are quiet good.

Roti and khichri was well cooked.

There were another 5-6 dishes. Which are pretty decent.

Yes, they also serve complementary drink.. Lassi.

Last but not the least yes the desert.. It was fantastic. Halwa, custard, jalebi :)

We went there on Tuesday.. So it was just 225 RS. Per head.. A big shout on this :P

More over, cherry on the cake.. We got a free coupon of 1 thali for the next visit :D

Inauguration of Khandani Rajdhani at Park Street

The City of Joy‚Äôs love for food is legendary. The people of Kolkata sure know their food and how to enjoy it. This is why cuisine from the world over finds its patronage here. Mirah Hospitality, whose flagship brand Khandani Rajdhani is already winning hearts across the Country, has decided to foray deeper into the city. The hospitality conglomerate has joined hands with Big Appetite Hospitality Pvt. Ltd. to bring more joy, food and gastronomical experiences to Kolkata with the launch of Khandani Rajdhani at Park Street. This is the Brand‚Äôs 30th outlet in the Country. I was invited to enjoy the inauguration and their delicious food.

I really did not like my visit to this Rajdhani Thali outlet. I have visited their outlets in Mumbai, Nagpur and Hyderabad as well, and this outlet was really poor compared to the other ones which had made a good Rajdhani impression in my mind!
I love Rajdhani Thali for two reasons. One, the food which will definitely make you miss your home and two, the way they address and serve you, like you are a Family guest of theirs.
It was the latter where I found this outlet to be particularly lacking. To speak in brief, the service was awful. The gentleman with the brass hand wash came to our table and in the process of helping me wash my hands, spilled some water on the plate as well as my lap. And this was not a one off incident, my friends faced the same issue with the handwash as well. Then started the flurry of dishes one after the other. The waiters would just come and serve you minimalistic portions of dishes whose even names you do not know. You like, let's say mini-samosa, and you request them to have some more then the waiter will come and serve you. One mini-samosa. You need to keep asking for more each time. It is difficult to feel contented without coming across as greedy. Another thing I observed throughout was that the waiters were really lax and casual ins serving to us. Mixing food items here and there in the plate....serving unnecessarily when asked to not serve....etc.
The food but, I must tell you, was certainly mouth watering. I hardly stay at home...and I truly was reminded on my Mom's cooked food here :)
Maybe I had an off experience here, as I see many other reviews giving much more positive a feedback.
I really like the Rajdhani thali! Hoping to visit more outlets of theirs :)

I been visiting Rajhani in Mumbai and Golden Star thali in Mumbai, Sasuma in Surat but park street team has seriously laid the expectation down. Service was seriously lethargic initially.¬†
¬†Apart from myself and there are only 2 other table around 9.30 pm. No crowd (may be people are not interested in simple veg food or this kind of service )
First of all no body attended post setting up of thali. Two starters were served post chatni and then there was long silence. Somebody realized I was waiting alone and then sabji guy came running dropped chana masalam, papdi sabji, alu matar and one paneer sabji and then i have to wait endlessly for roti's. It was such that I asked for roti and somehow roti guy managed to come for inside running.¬†Pure Pathetic recipe line up in thali. Roti was going all hard, seems flour was not that great with mix of maida.¬†
Then service resumed to normal rajhdhani style, people started kept asking for more but why should i take more when it all didn't taste that good.¬†Finally I got to taste sheera and shrikhand that was good and I had to my fill.¬†
Experience was no that great but what would you expect from Rs. 225/- thali.
Specifically not upoading pictures as didn't feel like take one.

One of my Besties is a kind of vegeterian hater,another is vegeterian lover and I am a foodie so I love all foods.Coming to the review part of this restaurant from the perspective of 3 of us, courtesy was warm, behaviour of the staffs was good. Rajasthani dishes were amazing but If they can they should change their interior according to the rustic feel of the Rajasthan. Otherwise it was an overall god experience.

Finally after hearing from lot of people we decided to visit this place on saraswati puja.  We were 4 of us and we sat. They first braught  a brass hand wash and then they gave still plates. They started like a marathon. They never stopped jus kept on serving.The dishes were gujrati and rajasthani. If some1 doesn't get tired while eating this is the right place with reasonable price.

We visited this place in Kolkata to have a terrific experience compared to Rajdhani Thali in Mumbai. They serve the dishes like chutteny and you have to then wait for servings to repeat for atleast 5 minutes for any item. That too mist of the dishes are not repeated after several reminders. You will get a feeling like you are there to have free meals.

The first thing that you notice about this place is the mehendi artist and the crowd. This place is buzzing with people even on a weekday. The staff is quick but courteous n polite. Present in the prime location of kolkata, this place lives up to all your expectations. The number of items in the thali to the taste of each and every dish. The masala chaach is a must try. the way they serve crushed baat n top is with dal is the best and easiest way to say, also reduces effort. The decor of the place is done aptly but given the crowd, it doesn't catch the eye. Another highlight is the hands system here.
The only thing missing is the ambience, again blaming the rush and crowd. They really need to increase their seating capacity cuz at these rates and this taste there is no way that those seats can remain empty.

Thali is very authentic .you can try this veg thali. but you avoid lassi. Test is very bad .lassi cost they take extra 75 rupees . Sweets like chamcham, zelabi are very nice. dhokla test is very nice. Khichuri is best. Thali is unlimited. Environment is very nice. You can feel ,you are special person in his restaurant. Last when you exit the gate you don't miss the pan masala. Is also very nice.

You are welcomed with a Tilak on your forehead, and I totally loved this traditional style.‚ù§
The service is exemplary, the food is authentic, plus you can have as many times as you want. I especially loved their Kesar Lassi, Daal-Baati, Kadhi and Raberi Jalebi. 
Definitely recommend.

What a disaster!! Had wanted to have a meal at Rajdhani Thali for a long time since they opened shop in Kolkata. But somehow things didn't work out and so was thrilled when they opened on Park Street, a very convenient location for me. But as I said what a disaster!! The ambience was that of a noisy "tiffin house", according to my friend but minus the hot,tasty,wholesome cheap food that one gets in such " tiffin houses". The place was choc a block with diners and the cacophony was deafening. The servers too were all at sea and too slow. The portion sizes were a joke....everything was tiny...minuscule! Though it was unlimited ,how much could one repeatedly ask for!! We had to ask for the rice three times before they deigned to serve us. The vegetables were tasteless and bland. Even Dal Bati Churma, which should have been the hero was a has been!...A damp squib. In fact all the food on the plate was c served cold and was unappealing as well as un appetising. Though since it was Women's Day they gave us a small memento and welcomed with a tika,all very nice touches but that definitely doesn't make up for tasteless and cold food as well as bad service.
I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. The food is bad,just gave an extra .5 marks for the traditional welcome. A first timer having their thali will have a wrong impression about Rajasthani and Gujarati cuisine, moreover they'll hesitate to try out dishes from these cuisines, based on their experience here....Which will be a real pity for Rajasthani and Gujarati food is very tasty and delicious. Sad.....

Located in Park Street, beside Oxford Bookstore, Rajdhani is a fairly new outlet serving authentic Rajasthani food. A very welcoming ambience, the staff being courteous enough in taking orders and serving the large number of items, time and again. They keep a check on all the customers to make sure that nobody waits for their vessels to be filled. They only have the thali system per person and serve a wide variety of items (probably more than 10!) ranging from starters, mains, sides and desserts. The number of items is overwhelming and an individual of average appetite may not be able to have more than one serving of each. I particularly liked this place for its promptness of service, hygiene, taste and quantity of food. One can make out the subtle differences in the tastes of all the items and they all seem to complement one another in a thali. Rajdhani will be a pleasant experience for vegetarians and those with a knack for some unique Indian flavours. Recommended for family outings. :)

Absolutely horrible experience. Either probably because I'm not a pure veggie, or because their food is below mediocre. I fail to see the hype about this place as the food I had tasted was neither tasty, nor even warm, let alone hot. Terrible decision to visit and waste our time and darn 850/- bucks on it. There is no menu, and its not very clear on what they charged so ridiculously.

This was one of many visits to Rajdhani. Things are better than before I feel. The food quality is the same as before. Authentic and tasty. Staff is always hovering around with generous serving of whatever is finishing in your plate. On a hot day, the butter milk that they serve is just the right thing to quench your thirst. Rotis are always hot and oven fresh. Did I tell you about the green chili pickle that they serve? Vegetarian food at its best.

I would have given ot a 3.5 or 4 but just coz of the staff i rate it 4.5. As i am a pure non veg and wanted to try veg as heard a alot bout it... it was a great experience and specially the staff, they were very quick, helpful and extremely polite and friendly. With a good food it has a soothing ambience too.

Went for dinner today at "Rajdhani' the new outlet at Park Street, although the food quality is OK (nothing great), the service is extremely poor. Can you imagine when asked for a second helping of Vegetable was told that - Khatam ho gaya abhi ban raha hai, They have a thali system and they forget or rather deliberately do not serve some items. for example we were not served with Deserts ( Gulab Jamun), which we saw that the same was being served to other guests, When asked they said sir bhul gaya.

A small outlet of Rajdhani amidst the busy street of Park Street. Well I went there with two of my veggie colleagues. The staffs are courteous and they know how to treat their customers. Food is nothing extraordinary. But some delicacies in the thalis were amazing, especially the daal baati churms and kadhi. Welcome drink was refreshing. A decent place for veggie lovers, who wants unlimited thali.

For those who like Rajasthani and Gujarati Food, this place is heaven. Although for me the experience was average. 

I liked a few things about this place. The Dhokla, Daal (Both Namkeen and Meethi), Papad, Chaach. 

This place is good for budget friendly people! It costs low as of now! FYI, this review is based on my preferences totally!

Perfect place for vegetarians.. superb food taste.. i am not a vegetarian but i really loved the place as they serving was very quick and well organised.. Ambience is good. I did not have rajasthani food so tasty as Rajdhani Park Street.. specially the phulka they were serving hot which makes you eat more and more.. we had also taken the kesar lassi which was a lil swt and sour but awesome taste and it just charged us 75rs for the lassi.. place is reasonable so vegetarian friends you all have a fantastic place to visit in terms of food as well as ambience..I really like the service also.. everything about the place was so perfect.

Perfect place for a vegetarian person to hang out with... and too much quantity for a person who can't eat so much... We loved the quality of food, excellant service.... The only scope of improvement is kindly allow the kids buffet to elder people who cant stuff more... :(

Rest everything is just fabulous... :)

A great traditional eating environment backing the roots of Gujrat and Rajasthan this restaurant is very convieniently located at Park street Kolkata just beside Samsung showroom having its own charm and single handedly differs itself from the rest of the crowds in the restaurant's market scene of Kolkata .

MY ORDER -

Had selected the Dinner buffet available on 12-2-2016 Friday around 10:30 pm for
Rs - 425 /- in the menu card and with tax it came around Rs - 500 /- for a single person .

AMBIANCE , HOSPITALITY AND FOOD .

As you enter this restaurant you will see a very vivid set of light decorations in the center's and corners as well as interiors mostly with the colour black and brown covering mostly with wooden furniture of tables and chairs crafted very fine and some glass fascade structure's making it look lovely and classy and mainly traditional and heritage.
Then moving on well all tables are layed out with a big steel plate, 2 steel glasses and steel bowls about 10 to 12 each and also 1 hand wipe kept for every individual who comes to experience the buffet .

The moment as you enter you get welcomed by the staffs literally putting tika on your forehead and showering flowers and directing you to your table ready with your plates to be filled in split of moments which is such a sweet and happy feeling cause you feel truly an Indian with the culture our country has and restaurant's like these actually practises and implements it is a very lovely moment captured in my mind .
Then next one of the staff comes and helps to get our hands washed with a metal jug pouring water which is some kind of traditional way of washing hands observed at that very moment and then the hand wipes are given to wipe and then comes the food part in to action right way after that amazing welcome with great hospitality given .

For the food and drinks let me tell you at first the staff had asked very courtesly whether we would like cold or regular water and as we wanted regular so instantly one bottle popped up in our table and in moments our first drink had arrived which was a KESARIA LASSI that tasted fully rich of kesar and milk full yummyness to the perfect , having the right temperature and quantity too.
Then moving ahead slowly our buffet menu started pouring in and at first one Chaat came which was in a small bowl and it tasted spicy as well as sweet keeping the balance of both right ,then another two different type of snacks which were dahi vada , idli type vada and dal batti chokha came along with three chutneys in white, green and red to dip them with and also the sliced salads were served along which were really lip smacking in all and I had to refill it again and again till I could keep space for the main course.
Moving on then Chanch was served for us in another glass which tasted very nice and tasty and I instantly finished it as it came .
Then came 4 different curries which were bhendi ,paneer,aloo and rajma which tasted all different from each other however my personal favourite was the aloo and bhendi curry I got.
Then came 3 different Dal's which were Kali dal ,meethi dal and peeli dal among them I liked the meethi dal as it tasted rich and yummy . After a while papad ,raita , pickle and more papri chaat came this time a bigger one which was much more richer and tastier .
Slowly the Roti's came in small uniform sizes which were soft and going good with the curries I had got on the plate ,soon after that came small Roti's with rajasthani ghee and Roti's with butter that were so delicious I couldn't control and get a refill of them as well .
In between all of this I observed a very good strong point that the staffs are always around you whether you need to call them or not they are still there insisting you to eat more and try more of the dishes and refills and specially one of them were literally saying ( thora sa khaalijeee aur please ) which actually made me feel like having more even though I was full still that line was enough to make me feel at home so without a doubt I had taken couple of refills on certain things but as their foods are very rich and filling so there is less chance for you to complete the whole thing as they are non stop insisting and filling your plate with all kinds of traditional foods till you stop and ask them to clear your table.

Moving and coming back to the food part after my encounter with Roti's , I had to try their rice and gujrati khichdi so asked the staff to give me both in equal proportion and I was loaded with both so started trying the rice which tasted very nice so had dal with it and a little bhendi that blended well with it but the khichdi was not so appealing taste wise probably because of the different ingredients they use so I left that one out and in the meanwhile I had more of other Roti's and rice till finally the desserts arrived on my plate which were moong dal ki halwa ,kheer ,rabri jalebi and seriously these three were superb in taste but for me moong dal ki halwa was a winner as with the authentic taste and richness it just make me get a refill of about 3 to 4 times for sure .
After all this treatment and warm service by the staff of RAJDHANI THALI i am surely coming back again for another round of such a huge spread from the start till the end I was always in a positive balance of eating and hats off to the management for capturing our hearts by this kind of foods which is a gift to Kolkata in disguise in the eating scene present in the city .
Also I would like to add that before leaving I like the idea of hitting that BAJAO DRUM and all shout bohot zorrrr :D .
Awesomeness for sure

Today, being the day of Saraswati Puja in West Bengal, me and my senior planned to go for a complete vegetarian lunch. She had chosen Rajdhani for this. And hearing from her about Rajdhani when it was first opened in Mani Square and then later closed down to open its outlet in Park Street, I was quite excited to visit this place.
My senior and one of her cousins had already reached the place before me. I was struck in traffic so got little late in arriving. As I arrived, there was a very warm welcome with a proper Aarti ki thali, and a Kumkum Tika was put on my forehead. I loved this gesture of welcoming their customers. I entered and found them seating right at the front table. I joined them and soon food was started being served.
At first, they came up with the Rajdhani Special Kesar Lassi. I took a sip of it and it tasted really good. However, you cannot complete it in one go because you will feel its too sweet and it kills your taste buds. A large steel thali was served infront of us, with several small katoris on it. Soon the waiters came up with the items from the buffet. At first, they served the several kinds of chutneys - Mithi Imli ki chutney, lehsun ki chutney, Mixed aachaar, Stuffed Chilli aachaar and Raita. Next there was Chilli samosa and Strawberry Dhokla, which sounded really interesting and tasted awesome too. Next there was Bhindi ki sabji, Mixed veg with Paneer, Aloo ki sabji, Rajma, and there were three different kinds of Dal. Also was served Dahi Vada..loved it, Papad, Roti with ghee, puri, and Poranpuri. In desserts, they had sweet Bread Tukra. I loved this sweet dish because it was so delicate it felt to melt in mouth and was perfectly sweetened and tasted great. Next there Chamcham which was spongy and yummy to eat again. Theb there was Dal baati churan which tasted perfectly well too. We had repeated many of the items over a number of times. 
The food, overall, tasted awesome, and deserves a 5-point rating. Also there was lots of variety of food. 
The service was way too fast, you are not given enough time to relish one item and enjoy its taste, untill then the next item comes up to you. That is what I disliked out here. They should make it more spaced out and slower so that we get to relish every item on the Thali really well. However, the waiters were keeping constant watch on the tables and were very courteous to ask us several number of times about if we would need anything. There were managers in round and were checking on all the waiters whether they are serving well or not, and were also taking good care of each and every person out there. So their customer service also deserves a 5. At one instant, we were so full that we refused to take anything else more, but one of the managers requested us to taste their Bajre ki Khichdi which was a speciality. We went for it, and it was indeed tasty and for the first time we had this dish. I had repeated the Chhach (butter milk) for over three times because it was really good and refreshing.
The food had a typical Rajasthani and Gujarati touch and flavour in it, and I think thats what makes all the dishes a speciality. The food was cooked in minimum oil, and I felt that all the dishes were healthy enough, too.
The restaurant is well-decorated, well-lit, spaceous seating arrangements in ground floor as well as upstairs, however the ambience could have been better, which would have added to it.
Location wise, its very easy to find it. Just as you cross Asiatic Society and Oxford Book Store in Park Street, you get Rajdhani on the same side of the road. 
The bill came up to 1500 ‚Çπ including taxes. So it was 500 ‚Çπ each for three of us. So I feel its very pocket friendly and value is good, as they serve so many items in the thali.
Overall, this place is a thumsup if you want to enjoy a family lunch together, or you are a trip to have vegetarian food with the flavours of North India. This place is a must try. Loved it. üòä

The immense Indian feeling the moment you enter the place. Extremely friendly staffs and mouthwatering food. They have covered almost every special things from the Rajasthani and Gujrati cuisine. Loved the way they treat their guests. Making us feel nothing less than those Marwar Kings. :) 
The food quality remains great along with the taste. Value for money. Perfect for the days you want to eat veg and want yourself to be pampered.

First time I had an experience of Rajdhani Thali, was in Delhi. Next I tried them in Mani Square Kolkata. The experience was the same. Awesome taste and out of this world service. They treat you like a son-in-law on his first visit to his sasural. I would love to come again and again. Amazing service.

1. Taste wise food is good but it doesn't really matter because the place seem to be very unethical. This is because we were told that it is a thali and without informing what is being charged, they served lassi and added a seperate cost in the bill and later mentioned that it was not included in the thali.
2. Waiters were in a hurry to serve food (that too when restaurant was not crowded at all) without even properly asking if i really want it and also without properly telling what is being served.
3. They were standing on head continuously asking what do i want more instead of letting me slowly and patiently enjoy the taste of the food.
Just to help the management in their enquiry, I am attaching herewith a snapshot of the bill.

I visited your Park Street, Kolkata restaurant and really disgusted with the service received. Please note below: 

1. Servers are not advising what actually being served to me and my guest. Regardless we may be allergetic to any food item. 

2. I was served Paneer Curry, with NO paneer chunks in it. On asking, I was told only crushed paneer is used. 

3. No Green Veggies/ Seasona Veggies available. I was served only Methi veg with some gram flour (Besan). 

4. No Salad Provided. On asking, I was told we serve only raita. 

5. When requesting for buttermilk, I was told it will be served after roti service. This is strange, I had an impression that buttermilk helps in increasing your appetite and is served with appetitesers. I may be wrong here, with many other restaurants who serve the buttermilk at the start of the meal.

6. Lastly, people need to be trained to speak with politeness and gentleness in which ever job they are in. And everybody has the right to be respected unlike what I faced in your restaurant.

Before I write the review I declare that I am a hardcore non-vegetarian and I hardly ever have a meal without some form of non-vegetarian food item or the other.

The food here is exemplary. All the vegetable curries, the daals, the rotis and the desserts are all excellent to taste. We all know that they do only thalis but the quality and variety of the food is unquestionably great. The meals are usually accompanied by chaas (buttermilk). 

The seating is quite comfortable and I have found the restaurant to be almost full each time that I have visited the place.

The quality service is very high as well. The staff is always very courteous but friendly and casual at the same time. And they are really generous with the ghee.

Ranks high on the value for money index.

After Mumbai, @RCT Ghatkopar, I again tasted it for the second time here.... and on the next day after it was opened,  I guess it was Panchami night during the puja time in 2015. This time with all veg-friends.... we enjoyed the most.... people say, it is too costly to have veg stuffs here.... but for me it's a high five. One can have every type of vegetable dishes available in our country except Chinese.... considering price and that too in Kolkata, I rated it 4 :) but it's good to have vegs here.... enjoyed much :)

We were very upset that this restaurant shut down in Mani Square. Glad that its doors are open once more - this time in Park Street. Having a thali system, most of the food is same - usually, the starters and the vegetables rotate.
Just a word of warning to guests - go on an absolutely empty stomach so that you can pig-out. Also, if you go during lunch, be prepared to skip tea and also on occasion, dinner.

After planning for a lunch we have decided to go to Rajdhani situated at park street opposite of Hakuna Matata and at the right side of The Park...
I have heard about their good service but when we went there I felt that Service is one of the best in town...
Just after having our seats they started to serve foods one by one ... just in a blink of an eye our plates were totally filled with various Rajasthani and Gujrati dishes ... I can't remember every items but main dishes were
Dhania ka chatni
Mithi chatni
Achar
Loki
Dry churma
Daal bati churma with ghee
Khamand dhokla
Matar ki kebab
Gathiya
Aloo ki sabji
Gathi ki sabji
Paneer ki Sabji
Kakhre ki sabji
Peeli daal
Kali daal
Mithi Hara daal
Dahi bara
Kakhra/papad
Roti
Baajre ki roti with desi ghee
Rajastani makkhan
Gur
Puri
Rice 
Khichdi
Jalebi
Paes
Halwa
Rabri
Chhanch in glass...
A hell lot of items! Isn't it?
Some dishes were normal ... but some dishes were extremely delicious like daal bati churma, paneer , jalebi , chhanch
etc... we also had Kesri lassi which was too thicky and tasty ...but it is not included in main thali ... you have to pay extra 75 rupees for one glass but worth the price ...
Now coming to the Service ... what can I say! Most nice and quick service and sweet behaviour of the waiters definitely added a good feeling...
You don't have to call any waiters... they come numerous times asking for refilling... even they will request you to taste every items even if you don't want to...
And A to Z items can be refilled...
Ambience is also good...
Warning: It's better to go there with empty tummy... :P

Being a Gujarati and a pure vegetarian has always loved this place....
Ambiance and service is good...
All who loves Gujarati and Marwadi dishes must not miss this place and those who are foodie can try something new and typical dishes from Gujarat and Rajasthan... ¬†
One will get lots of items in thali from vegetables, grams, curry,chutny, achar, farsan, sweet and chaas...¬†
If you are very hungry and got less to spend, you visit this place with unlimited food and delicious dishes....

Writing this review after after visiting the place under two different circumstances. On a given day when the rush is not so maddening they serve you very politely, sticking around your table and paying attention to every detail. They keep on harping and forcing you to have more food. Which I personally liked. The food was served hot too. But on a day when the crowd is spilling over they fail to manage the place. The staff seems nonplussed and don't know whom they have served and whom they haven't. The place turns into a railway station. They failed to serve me jalebi which I had asked for and were eagerly waiting so that I could complete my meal and vacate the seat for the ones waiting. This shoddy attitude and rushing attitude had really put me off.
But regarding the food i would like to say that the food was simply lip smacking and it is one of a kind I had. Though, I am not a big fan of veg food. But Rajdhani really did win me over.

A must visit for everyone who loves trying out different delicacies. They have so much to offer. The courteous staff and prompt service makes your eating experience one of the best ever. 

But yes if you're indeed planning to visit, make sure you go on an empty tummy because the variety of the dishes they serve. And you would want that you taste everything properly.

Basically they a mixture of Gujarati and Rajasthani food. I particularly liked the Dal Dhokli, Dal Baati. Amongst the various main course dishes served, Oondhiyu and Paneer were quiet delectable. 
Rajma was quiet good as well. The Gujarati Dal and Kadhi were the show stealer for me. They also 2 types of rice preparations amongst various other things. Amongst the dessert, Dal ka seera was too good. I didn't like the Malpua with Rabri. That could have been better. 

Overall a pretty good experience. A proper hearty meal that was definitely enjoyed by us.

Finally Rajdhani Outlet is back in Kolkata again . I have been visiting there chain since long time . Food quality and ambiance are good but with time i find there level of service has gone down. They are still famous for good service where they dont let your plate empty always insisting you to eat more but my last visit did not make me feel that way.

I've been to the Rajdhani outlet in Mumbai. Loved it completely, the experience, the food, the decor. After that have been to their outlet in Kolkata at Mani Square. Loved it yet again. Was thoroughly disappointed when they closed down that outlet. One day was browsing through Zomato when all of a sudden came across Rajdhani. Immediately checked out the location. If given a chance would have gone there immediately. Next day was out with a friend who is a Gujarati and he was telling me that he had Daal Baati Churma. Instantly I thought of going there. We arrived there only to find out there was a huge waiting. Finally after a long wait of close to half an hr, we did get the place. The thali with several choti-choti katoris were waiting for us. Three types of Daal, two kinds of farsan, three types of sabzi, two sweets, fulkas served with ghee was served. It was finger-licking delicious. 
So my rating on a scale of 5 would be as below:
Food- 4
Service-3.5
Ambience-4
Value for money-4
Would definitely recommend everyone to try this place for sure.

Thank god rajdhani reopened in Kolkata but something needs to be fine-tuned here because the experience was neither a feel-good one nor a fulfilling one...First when entered the restaurant, No staff was available for welcoming with flowers and tika like mani square outlet.

The food, though, was, frankly, quite bland and tasteless. Most of the items served were on the sweetish side. Ghee is good, but when so much of it is poured over the food, it only ends in the person feeling bloated by the end of the meal. The waiters are really delighted to serve food. They won't leave your plate empty even for a fraction of a second.

I wouldn't say that it was another worldly experience but overall a nice one... I would however recommend more concentration on the quality of food specially on papad!!!!!!

Rajdhani Thali holds a very special place in my heart. When I had first eaten there at their Mani Square outlet, I was absolutely thrilled. It was like a dream restaurant especially designed for me. I mean, I am a half-Rajasthani and staying in Kolkata, I really, really miss eating the famed Rajasthani delicacies. Thus, finding Rajdhani was really like a dream. Getting all my favorite Rajasthani and Gujrati snacks served to me in a wholesome platter! What more could I ask for? Unfortunately, though, the Mani Sq. outlet downed its shutters last year which left me completely heart broken.¬†
Over the last year or so, I have been regularly checking everyhwere on any news for Rajdhani re-opening its shutters in Kolkata, I waited, waited, waited...And finally, at long last, my prayers have been answered. When I heard the news of the new Park St. Rajdhani outlet, I was ecstatic. This was absolutely perfect news for me.¬†
And now, yesterday, I had the pleasure of finally visiting this new outlet. I wondered if it would retain the charm and aura of the old Rajdhani outlet. I wasn't disappointed. The waiters were very cordial what with their traditional attires and all, the ambiance was excellent, and above all, the food was scrumptious. They served me 4 different kinds of sabzis; and except the paneer corn and alu ki sabzi, I don't even remember the names of the others. They were very unique and yet quite tasty. The small puris were good, so was the khichdi and the starters and the 3 sweets. The daal, baati, choorma was awesome and reminded me of my summer holidays in Rajasthan. Overall, the platter was more than sufficient for my overlarge tummy and I was thoroughly satisfied with the quality and quantity of the food. I went there like a hungry wolf and came out like a well fed lion.¬†
In the end, I would like to say that I had a fantastic experience at Rajthani Thali and have promised myself to return here every month. Hope you stay on this time guys. Two thumbs up and a solid five stars from my end. Keep up the fantastic work.

Rajdhani Thali is a very nice restaurant for Thali lovers. You get a very nice variety of Marwari & Gujarati items in your Thali here. They serve different menus on a daily basis, but as this outlet is a new one, they are still coping up with the service. But, the food compensates all :)

The restaurant disappointed me compared to Mumbai ones. Food served were not hot or warm(exclude bread items). Undhiyo veggies specifically eggplant was not cooked and had worms. Average food considering the high standards elsewhere.Expecting they serve hot or warm foods in future. Will like to visit again. It is always veggie paradise

Thank god they reopened rajdhani in Kolkata. I have visited this restaurant before and it never disappoints. Brilliant thali with amazing flavours. They have introduced few daily offers as well, so do try. The best part they make you feel at home. Warm welcome and they serve you with love. I definitely recommend it.

Had a disappointing experience at lunch today. The restaurant has a different ambience than what one is used to in Park Street, but that's okay - a new experience is always welcome.¬†

The gentleman who received us in the traditional way could do with smarter clothing. The waiters - three categories - were very cordial and eager to please.¬†

The food, though, was, frankly, quite bland and tasteless. So many dishes, and except for the dahi vada, kadhi and dal (not the sweet one), the other dishes were utterly uninspiring. The presentation too left much to be desired. Everything is just piled on in the platter. Ghee is good, but when so much of it is poured over the food, it only ends in the person feeling bloated by the end of the meal.¬†

Something needs to be fine-tuned here because the experience was neither a feel-good one nor a fulfilling one, food-wise...

May not want to go there a second time.

A place to be for vegetarian foodies. This place is highly reputed in the city for its amazing Rajasthani cuisine and sweet dishes. It has a buffet system where the plate and bowls are places on the table and the server keeps bringing the food items. They have an immense variety and one gets tired of trying everything, obviously tired in a good way. The service is very close to home and the waiters are really delighted to serve food. They sometimes even give suggestions regarding what tastes good in what combination. It was a very unique exquisiteness and I look forward to coming again. For the food they provide, it is quite pocket friendly.

Food was traditional, authentic, simple and less spicy. 7-8 type chatney was awesome. Some Curry's are very ordinary in test and very regular just like home made. Dahi bars, aam panna sarbot and specially kichuri with pure spoonful ghee at last memorable. Well staff with rajasthani pagri, nice furniture & traditional wooden touch decor. Heaven for vegetarians.
Well I m not tried park street branch but I was tried @ 160/-when it was at Mani Square Mall 3 years back.  Mani Square branch is closed now and in the same place another restaurant open "Kaidi Kitchen".

" Khandani rajdhani thali "

The name says it all ,

First time ever in park street ,
Located just a stone throw away from kwality and Oxford book store , beside Samsung show room .

What a hospitality.

First when we entered the restaurant,
A staff welcomed us with flowers and tika .

Like other restaurant you don't have to wait for your food ,

They have only meal system. Rajasthani thali , gujrati thali and both mixed .

So we ordered combined thali,

The pure steel plate and bowls were already placed on tables .

A staff arrived with an ancient designed Mughal jar with warm water .
We washed our hands.

*feels so posh and khandani*
*blinks both the eyes*

They served all the items one by one.

Let me tell you these thali's are so huge in amount that you can't finish one at a time.

The fusion meal had -
Khamand dhokla , aloo Ki sabzi, palak paneer , kadi , kaali daal , mithi daal and peeli daal , 4 types of chutney, achaar , dahi Wada , daal baati churma , roti , bajre Ki roti , Puri , white butter , rajasthani ghee , gudd , chawal , khichdi, kakde Ki sabzi and matar ka kebab .

All were superb and totally reminded me of my Rajasthan days and childhood memories. 

In desserts they served -
Moongh daal ka halwa , chawal Ki firni , jalebi with rabdi .

* mouth watering *

Along with the food , they served two types of lassi -
Maharaja lassi and chaanch .

Maharaja lassi is not included with the meal . They separately charge 150  each but yessss worth it .
Tastes amazing.

This is  best thing happened to me in these 7 years of foodie life.

A must visit place :)

Served in a jiffy - you never have to wait for your food in this place.(in case you are in a hurry)
I happened to visit this place on a Sunday evening ,as soon as you enter and take a seat the serving starts and they are so fast serving that in a minute your thali is fancy filled with eateries . the food is just OK, few things are good though (malpua definitely!) But considering people like me,spoilt for choice ,its a turnoff .Definitely not a value for money as the items are few considering the price of Rs. 425 pp .Had it been Tuesday at a price of 225 I would definitely recommend it.

First visited Rajdhani in Mani Square. My second visit too was in the same outlet. Rajdhani serves authentic Rajasthani thali. They first greet you by helping you wash your hands in a copper vessel. You dont have a menu. They give you a welcome drink (chach most probably)...and then they give you the biggest thali comprising of variety of dishes. Some good..some ok...some really nice. Cant say that everything is perfect but yes you will feel good after your meal and am sure you cannot eat the entire thing. Was quite disheartened to know that this outlet was shut down. But happy to know that Park St has come up with a new outlet. Will visit it very soon
Ok the edited version of my review states only disappointment... I visited this newly opened outlet some days back..and seriously came back with a frown. The food was soo bland. U cant make out what you are eating cause all the veggies are so tasteless. The rotis ..the dahi vada..nothing appeased my taste buds. They kept piling till you didnt want to see any more food. I mean give us a break of atleast 2 minutes. (Maybe they just want us to pack up within 30 mins and thats exactly what happened). Where were the spices Rajasthani food is known for. This is definitely not a place where you can sit and enjoy your meal and spend some time. Well will not want to visit again.

Called for a tifin for 200/- and it was so so so bad. The yellow dal was ok.. roti were small and hard..the salad was jus namesake. the Paneer and other sabzi was as if they were put from pre-packed meals..feel sick after having it ...so much oil and nothing seemed fresh.

We were a group of 8 who came to try out the new rajdhani in the area. Had pretty high hopes, but it didn't really match up to the expectations. The service was impressive, to say the least. 

The daal baati, churma and the chutneys were a highlight. Sabzis and daal were just okay. The rotis were light and fluffy as always..no complaints there. A small disappointment for me were the desserts, which are always a major attraction for me ar rajdhani... Found the rassogolla to be too sweet, while the jalebi with rabri were okay. Didn't like the dry fruit halwa.

Some people in our group liked the food as well, so I say one can give it a try :)

Since I had the good fortune of visiting their Mani Square outlet way back in early 2014,I was conversant with their thali system. It would not be out of place to mention that I liked their Thali a lot and missed it so much in the last 1.5 years when it had shut.
Thus when I came to know that this has opened again in Kolkata,I decided to relive my good old memories.

Visited this place on 31st October 2015. At that time,this branch was barely 15 days old ( it wasn't even listed on Zomato properly).

What I like the most about this place is that it offers Rajasthani-Gujarati cuisine,which is rarely offered in Kolkata. This veg restaurant ¬†has highly cordial staff on service. We took the full thali (with unlimited filling,priced at Rs 399/- inclusive of all).

Dahi chat was fabulous,so was the Moong Halwa and Malpua with Rabri topping.
Kachori was great too.I also liked the buttermilk.Its good for the stomach as well after having a sumptuous meal.

The waiters serve in a fashion like some guests have arrived in their own house. The manager was also very polite and amiable.They also have various take-away Lunch Boxes,which is a good option for office goers.

Hope that they maintain the same level of Customer Service,in the days to come.

We want more such good veg Fine-Dining Restaurants in the city,that serves premium vegetarian food at pocket-friendly prices.

Great hospitality and good food sums up this place. Being a marwari, I found this place to beperfect for Rajasthani/home style food!
Newly opened doors at Park street, this franchise is winning hearts and tummies! :)

You are welcomed at the door with a tilak and then escorted to your table where they get you a mobile wash to sanitize your hands.

Farsaan, patties, daal baati churma, dahi vada, mix veggies, aloo, kadi, dal, chawal, khichdi, puran puri, falka, mango shreekhand, gulab jamun, mini jalebis kesar lassi!

There is of course unlimited refills available and the staff ensures that you overeat and try every item

The thali costs around 400 which is reasonable.

Overall a good place for a family dinner, homestyle .

A new outlet with the same warmth and feel as that of old one , that is what comes first in mind As I entered the place . smiling welcome and courteous behaviour is something that makes you feel at home . the ambience is kept simple yet elegant , although capacity has reduced but yet big enough for the locality . coming to food it was absolute delight and something that wil spoil you with choices . the food is traditionally Rajasthani cum gujrati and is purely made of ghee . you can taste ghee in every bit I would say .I loved the malpua and the shira . also the tikki was good . the small chapatis wil make you forget the count of how many you had and still you wont feel heavy as it is pure home food.  I would suggest you to keep space for the daily specialities as they serve it in course and as the spread is vast you might be done tasting all the dishes. Only one problem I feel is that may be you would not want to pay for ghar ka khana when you are out for dinner . but its still a good change from regular dine out.  One pocket saver tip visit on Tuesdays as they have offer on Tuesdays . don't forget to ring the dafli and be greeted AVJOOO.

Date of Visit : 18/11/2015

Location : Very near to famous kwality restaurant. Just opposite to hakuna matata.

Decor : Attractive decor with comfortable seating arrangements.

Service : As the restaurant is newly opened, staffs seemed to be under trained. No one was there to attend at the gate. When i asked for second serving, i was not served instantly. I had remind them again and again what I wanted. As I was expecting high class service from them, so was little disappointed with the service.

Menu for the day : Attached as photo.

Description : I went there for lunch on a weekday with my dad and brother. The place was relatively empty. ¬†They came with moveable utensil to wash my hand with warm water. Then they started serving all the items one by one as per the menu of the day. Samosa has a garlicy flavour in it. I just loved it. Kept having it again and again. Rasiya Dhokla was good & soft. Dal baati churma was top class. In main course, mix veg paneer was superb. Bhindi Sambhariya, Batata Patal Bhaji, Choula were average. All types of dal were good. Steam Rice & khichdi were properly cooked and served ghee with it which enhanced the taste. Phulka & Jawari Rotla were average. Methi Thepla was top notch. Hot jalebi with rabdi was just out of the world. Cham Cham & Sewaiya Kheer were average.

Overall, the experience was nice with few very good dishes. The service disappointed me the most. I am hopefull that it will improve with time.

Rajdhani is a typical rsjasthani and Gujarati restaurant located at the heart of the city-Park street!.. It has a pleasant ambience and the food was also good!..but the thing worth mentioning was the warm hospitality by the staff over there..Every single person serving had a smile on their face and the way they treated us was jus amazing!...cheers to that!

After having visited their outlets in Mani Square and Avani Mall, I must say either this is another company or its a franchisee.

That said, I would like to request the management to send their staff to Mani Square or Avani to learn hospitality from them. The food quality of course is as good as any other Rajdhani. But, the restaurant has a total lack of hospitality and coordination. I got my vegetables and had to wait almost ten minutes before I was served the rotis. Just barely into the meal, one waiter came and served me dessert on my plate before even I could say that I had barely started eating.

I would suggest the staff for this restaurant be trained before they ruin the respectable brand of Rajdhani

Location - Conveniently located at Park street in between the park hotel and olypub..

Ambience - Quite nice. Neat interiors and soft background music adds up to the vibe.. One of the person in rajashthani avatar will apply Chandan tika on your forehead once you enter the restro.. It also has a first floor section which is bit bigger than the ground one.. Comparatively spacious than their first branch.

Service - Service was super prompt.. Servers were very generous and well behaved.

Food: No need to talk about. Always good.. Right from their first branch at mani square which is closed now.. They have been serving some top quality thalis after Teej.

As soon as you take your seat, the servers will bring a container through which we can wash our hands with a lukewarm water. Kudos to that. And then only the word STOP will actually stop them from serving us.. They will serve items one after another. And you will be spoilt for choice.

There are no menus. Thali will cost around rs330 + tax. And they also have a take away menu in which one can have different meal boxes starting from rs80 onwards. So that's cheap if you opt for takeaway with no compromise in quality.

Overall a nice experience. Would love to visit again in near future.

Recommended for Family Dinner or group of friends who are tired of North Indian, Italian and Shisha ;)

LOCATION: Rajdhani Thali is at a stones throw from the Oxford Bookstore and immediately beside the Samsung showroom at cardinal Park Street.

BUILDING: It is a G+1 outlet with no reservation system and they start serving as soon as you sit down. The advantage of this being that if@ you are hungry after a long day or week and yearn for immediate food then this is the place to be and the disadvantage that I faced today that we had to wait outside since a few of my relatives hadn't arrived yet.

INTERIORS: The interiors are befitting but in the First Floor the height is low, so 6'ftrs like me have to be alert and cagey. The seats have no back cushions and the tables are of 4 each so if you're looking for a big family dinner, they'll have to join them.

NEW FUNDA: They offer you to wash hands with lukewarm water before and after eating with a utensil which you can call a movable sink which was pretty slick and I saw it for the first time.

FOOD: Coming to the Fooding part, boy oh boy, wait for it because you're in for a Roller-Coaster ride because this kind of service is never experienced and flash-fast. They provide you with a big plate with 7-8 small containers for the sabzis. The menu changes everyday and I have Attached today's menu!! The finger licking entr√®e was the Daal Ka Halua, The Sweet Daal and Daal Baati Churma with Desi Ghee Poured all over it!! They also gave Gulab Jamun which was unfortunately not hot. The other items were satisfactory and felt home made with no extra seasonings so health conscious people, there's your cue.

THUMBS DOWN: One more thing which I didn't like was the timing of serve of different courses. The meal or thali as they say should be divided as starters, main course and desserts. But what we got was Starters and the dessert was served along with main course. I hope their advantage of quick service does not convert into their main disadvantage.

SERVICE: The servers were pretty courteous and quick. You got what you wanted as soon as you wanted. They were so quick that at one point one of the waiter bumped into the other and as a result half of the sabzi he was carrying fell down. Although it was none of their fault and the commotion was quickly handled and taken care off.

OTHER: But there was a lot of noise and a tinge of chaos as everything happened so quickly and as a result there was less talk between the family members as most of the time we were telling the waiters as to what we needed and what we didn't.

COST: Per head cost is 425/- (Unlimited), and On Tuesdays they have the Happy Day of food as the prices are 225/- with no change in the quantity, quality and the menu! Overall I had a good and satisfactory experience

Chanced upon on a Saturday noon while strolling through park Street.. Was pleasantly surprised to see this place have opened up after closing down their Mani square outlet. As expected the warm welcome at the entrance followed by the excellent hospitality of the staff... After taking our seats they carried the portable basin to wash our hands... Then the buttermilk or chanch was served which a real soothing drink in the heat... After that one after another the items were served there were around 30 items !!! From salad, two types of achar, chutneys, to dal bati churma, dhokla, three types of rotis, pulao, khichri to kadi, sabzis of different types, dals, halwa, malpua we went on and on.... The servers were extremely cordial and one very strange thing was happening. First time in any restaurant I saw the waiters goading us constantly to eat some more as if we were guests at their house!! A very personal touch I must say!! We ate till we couldn't anymore and was very satisfied with the reasonable price!!! Would love to visit again for sure!! A perfect veg family restaurant!

@was having the thali for lunch  at rajdhani yesterday at park street restaurant , where i found the food to be very average so to say the taste of the food items was way below mark except for gatte ke sabzi and malpua and the khichri which were the saving grace . For the price of 425/  it didnt seem worth it ,the maharaja thaali . 
Aloo sabzi tastes better at any ordinary road side shops , the dals were poor , the palak sabzi nothing to talk about . Wonder why would a vegetarian person pay a visit here when there are better options nearby .

My boyfriend is a real big fan of Rajdhani. He was one of their super regular customer before it shutdown. But walking through park Street and stumbling across the new outlet excited him a bit too much and we had to immediately have lunch here.
I've eaten only twice in Rajdhani, Mani square. Compared to that I found the food to be okay. A bit bland may be. The items were lesser compared to the previous times. But I was full and happy to see my boyfriend's gleaming face by the end of it.
I don't remember the rates of earlier outlets but this seems a tad cheaper at 450 for two thalis.
Service was too fast so had to ask them to slow down. But they were cordial and the restaurant was really full even on a weekday. I guess people really missed Rajdhani. :)
Oh and if you crave for ghar ka khana big time. You should come here. Two things are for sure.. Variety and no upset tummy. Swarnendu Moitra

Edit:- The standard has really gone down, I have visited this place two or three more times from the last time I reviewed. The food quality is okay but what I found really lacking is taste and courtesy. Just the tilak doesn't define courtesy I'm sure. I went once on a busy day, and i found the servers refusing another helping of dessert in the nearby table. we were left waiting for refills even after reminding them twice. And the food, they just are cooking food without any effort at the taste. Sad.

Since they closed down in mani sqaure was a bit unsure about where to find the typical north indian veg thali destination in kolkata. And look they r back with a bang at park street food was good. A little bit more professionalism would have been better.

Good news for all 'Rajdhani Thali' lovers - their new outlet has opened in Park Street on 16th Oct, 2015. It‚Äôs located beside ‚ÄòThe Park', and is opposite ‚ÄòHakuna Matata‚Äô.

Ever since ‚ÄòKhandani Rajdhani‚Äô pulled it‚Äôs shutters in Mani Square Mall, many of its loyalists were in a fix, as it was their quintessential go-to place, for a nice, elaborate and leisurely, north Indian pure vegetarian meal. The new eatery ‚ÄòRajdhani Thali‚Äô offers the same culinary delights, in the same Indian style.

Nestled between ‚ÄòThe Park‚Äô and ‚ÄòOlypub‚Äô, ‚ÄòRajdhani Thali‚Äô is a 100 seater restaurant, occupying ground floor and mezzanine floor. Furniture is basically wooden and straight lined. D√©cor is relatively simple.

As per their trend, emphasis is both on food as well as reception (both Indian). You are greeted with a ‚Äòtika‚Äô on your forehead, seated comfortably, bearer comes to you with a movable utensil, so as to assist you in washing your hands. There is no menu, just a single and wholesome ‚ÄòThali‚Äô with 32 food items (including water). Each diner is required to order a separate ‚Äòthali‚Äô. Each ‚Äòthali‚Äô comes with the privilege of unlimited refills.

Our 'thali‚Äô consisted of -

Welcome Drinks: Chaas and water.

Starters: Dhokla, heart shaped cutlet, yoghurt dip, green chutney, imli chutney, garlic chutney and chaunki hui mirch.

Main Course: Dal baati, churma, dal dhokli, sukhi bhindi, mix veg & paneer, dahi wale aloo, moth moong, kadhi, dal, gujrati kadhi, gujrati dal, phulka, aloo ki roti, bajre ka tikadia, ghee, safed makkhan, gur, khichdi, chawal and papad.

Desserts: Basoondi, suji ka halwa and jalebi.

Food was fresh and nice. ‚ÄòDhoklas‚Äô were very well made. They were soft and aromatic and not very spongy. ‚ÄòDal baati and churma‚Äô tasted authentic.

Good many numbers of staff were present. Their efforts and hospitality were good, but the staff of ‚ÄòKhandani Rajdhani , Mani Square‚Äô (currently closed) were much more professional.

Few pre defined parcel options are also available.

Ok I visited this place this weekend only and I had no idea that rajdhani was again back in town ! Ambiance is nice , the way they welcome their guest is awesome with whole tikas n all , their service is very good  . every thing is fine apart from food . I mean itz just average , taste wise .. I think they should put some more effort in terms of their food . other then that I have not seen such good service in any other restaurants of kolkata ..

I wouldn't say that it was a other worldly experience but overall a nice one.
The staff were extremely courteous and took time explain each and every dish when asked about them.
One thing that I liked was the open to customers kitchen!!
They actually invited the guests to check out their kitchen !!!

Good quantity but not quality .Read about it in the papers and reached the joint. The welcome was really grand. The thali was really big and what turned us off was the fact that as soon as we got seated , food was rushed down our throats and it just kept on pouring in. Most of the items served was on the sweetish side .The mini samosa and Dal could be made better ... The staff was eager to help. I would however recommend more concentration on the quality. People looking for value for money during office hours may enjoy it but for quality conscience people this place can be avoided. @ Amit Khandelwal

A very honest & sincere effort has been made to create a rajhastani & gujrati thali meal, the location, ambience, service, prices all do justice to the newly opened Rajdhani thali, but the subji, dal in the dal batti & the simple mini samosa, kichdi & different types of rotis leaves much to be desired as authentic rajhahtani or gujrati meal as one expects. A bit more upgrade required on these items.

It's my father's birthday, and what better to end it, then Rajdhani.

We were greeted at the entrance with tika, and welcomed by a group of staff. 
What followed was a feast, literally a feast on dad's birthday. 

We were given khandavi, corn patty, dal bati and some nice chutneys to start with. After this, we were treated with variety of subzi's, dals and rotis. In subzi- I loved gatte ki sabzi and 

Palak Paneer. Bajre ki roti and thepla was special, and teekha daal and kadi added to the deal. 
Rice and khichdi were also ther, khichi had nice flavours to it.
the best part is, they made it very authentic, like - Bajre ki roti had home made butter and Gur spread over it, and phulka had ghee over the top.
Jalebi and moong ka halwa was nice.. Rosgulla could have been little softer.

The team at Rajdhani is wonderful, a rarity offlate in our town. They knew about ther offering, smile on ther face and they fed us like a family member. We felt loved. 

Thank you to each and every staff of the team.

Aao Jo!!!

P.s.- I wouldn't mind if they ever start seating arrangements on the floor, maybe on the mezzanine floor.
