This place was very reasonable: the food was very tasty at such a reasonable price, the quality and quantity were also satisfying. Though the food was up to the mark the sitting arrangement was not satisfying. It was more like a musical chair as the space is very small and one has to wait until another finishes. Overall it's a thumbs-up. Would like all my foodie friends to give it a try.

A decent enough place for new market shoppers if u need a quick snack.. Its popular for its dosas and chole bhature.. The dosas are good and served really fast.. Unlike other places which take ages to be served.. The papri chaat u can give it a miss. Their bhature are ok but the choley is really bland.. Not the spicy version you would expect.. Haven't tried their juices though..prices are pocket friendly.. U can hop in for a real quick bite after a round of new market shopping experience..

This place does good when youâ€™re looking for a quick snack & extremely fast service. I tried their Chole Batore, Cheese Masala Dosa & Gulab Jamun. My dosa was burnt so I didnt quite like it but the other two items were nice. Its advisable to go for plain dosaâ€™s out here as the masala (alu) is  not that good. 0.5 rating solely for the low prices & quick service.

If you are a veggie and looking for some quick snacks, grab your seat here.

Serves some of the best south Indian dishes in the city. 

Only con about the place is the ambience, but when you are hungry and you get good food at cheap prices why does ambience matters?

A small vegetarian place in the busy New Market area, the Â Friends Home restaurant serves pretty decent fare at extremely affordable prices. I've had the dahi vada, mixed chaat and mango milkshake and while the milkshake was comforting in its familiarity, I fell in love with the dahi vada. The vadas were soft and soaked up all the goodness from the yoghurt and tamarind sauce. Considering how light it is on your pocket, you really don't have much room for complaint. Do try this place out if you are in the area. I will definitely go back to try out the dosas and uttapams.

Went there last day in the afternoon, nothing much to speak about the decor. A Non-AC restaurant with rows of steel and wooden furnitures. 

     Coming to food, they offer south Indian snacks, chaats, fruit juices and soft drinks. The taste and quality needs improvement, though the staff were friendly and helpful. Extra 0.5 rate for them.

Location: adjacent to sreeram arcade. 
It's a non AC restaurant serving only veg food with lassi and fruit juices. 
We ordered: 
*one butter onion masala dosa 
*one cheese onion masala dosa
It wasn't that tasty but I found the dosa oily and less cheese were given.. 
They should improve in making south Indian dishes..

Its the best place for a quick bite whenever one goes shopping to new market. Its located just opposite of city mart. A small place seving a variety of south and north indian veg dishes. I had masala dosa, idli and gulab jamun. The dosa was quite filling with a good amount of masala. Loved the white chutney but the sambar was a bit too sour for me. The idly was soft and i loved it. The gulab jamun was the just too good. It was served hot and really really taaty. Not much to decribe about the decor, its a diner with the bare minimums. The staffs were quite helpful. The only thing I disliked is that I was handed the bill before I was actually done with the food. It seemed that they wanted to convey " you have had your food, now pay and leave" . This attitude really bothered me. So rated 0.5 less.

A very budget-friendly restaurant adjacent to Sreeram Arcade that serves both north and south Indian cuisines and has been operating for years. The ambience might not be the "coolest" one in the neighborhood but it makes up for it by it's prompt service and delicious food. A favourite spot for most people who work in the vicinity, it experiences high footfall. If you do visit, do try their dosas, lassis and fruit juices. You will find pure refreshment without a hole in your pocket- now isn't that a great thing!

A lot of international fast food outlets have developed in and around new market but the original swadeshi traditional fast food restaurant of this place is the ubiquitous Friends Home. As the name suggests, it is actually the original meet-the-friends restaurant, which is seldom empty. It does brisk business putting non vegetarian and popular new brands way behind it. 
Its south Indian dishes, tempting chaats and piping hot bhaturas are always in demand along with the fresh fruit juice it makes right at its broad entrance.

Not a fancy place at all. Just a place to grab a quick bite while you're in New Market. I used to come here and order a dosa for lunch, and I enjoyed that too. But that was a long time ago. Recently, I have only tried their kulfi. Which is pretty tasty! So is their soft serve (softy). One of those very few places to still be serving a softy.
Satisfactory experience.

This restaurant is as busy as it could be. I love the vibe of this place. And of course the fresh food. Their masala dosa, idli, vada, and chhole bhatura are my favorites. Even the sambar and chutneys are quite satisfying. The prices are very cheap compared to the quality and the portions of the food. And the best way to end the meal here is by having a plate of piping hot gulab jamuns.

I usually go for their chana bhatura, dahi vada and dosas whenever I visit this restaurant after shopping at Sreeram Arcade. The cholla bhatura is excellent, and previously used to be extremely spicy but now not so. This restaurant lives up to its name though and does make you feel like you're eating at your friend's home.

I had Dosa's, Uttapam, Chola Bhatura and Koolfi. Well the quantity they give is a fair bit and serves fast as well. All the mentioned food over there are well made and you really will love it there. So if you like Dosa's and all, do give it a visit. 

It's non AC and hot, true and doesn't have much of a classy atmosphere but it's food is really good. 3.5 just for the food. Otherwise a 3.

The staff is very cold, maybe because its one of the busiest food joints in the area and they have to cater to many people together. Much cant be said about the hygiene either. I like their dosas a lot. Just the dosas. Rest of the food (south indian) are just okay. Price reasonable. Not really recommended unless youre on a tight budget and most places are filled up.

Location and Description: This is at very busiest New market area at esplanade, It offer you a very good and delicious Vegetarian food with lots of variety.

Ambience and Staff: The Place is quite big and the ambiance looks nice. Its neat and clean. We went there today for a quick bites in the evening after a tiring shopping. We got our seats instantly and the waiter was very quick to attend us in a minute.Â 

Food: We ordered Chana Bhatura and Idli to start our beginning with this place. Chana Bhatura was good, The chana masala was really cooked well and it was very soft, Bhatura was a bit on the oily side but i was satisfied. Idli was really nice with the Chutney and was made quite well, The sambar was a bit too watery,thou it was not a big deal. I wish i could have tasted the Gulab Jamun, it will be next time.

QNQ & Prices: Quality of the food was good and the quantity provided was also decent. Prices are fine according to the place.

The Conclusion: They also offer juices and shakes with the ice cream stall outside. Overall my experience here was quite satisfactory.
Note: The review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

This place offers decent vegetarian food in a clean and tidy environment in the New Market area. 
I have been here a lot of times and the food though not mind blowing is pretty good. The dosas, vadas and the uttapams are nice. But I guess their chaats and dahi vadas are their best offerings. Also try their juices and shakes. They are quite nice.
The service is quite prompt and nice. 
The only word of caution about this place is that it always remains overcrowded and is quite claustrophobic. 
Happy eating.

It's a pleasant place for a quick, inexpensive meal after shopping at new market or sreeram arcade. It's clean and unassuming. The chola bhatura is very delicious and the portions are large. the dosas are super too, as are the lassis and fruit juices. Even though there's no air conditioning, it is always fairly cool. Service is fast too. Great place, especially for the price you pay.

Adjacent to Sreeram Arcade in New Market Area. Quite Reasonably priced and quite hygienic also. For south indian ,lassi , kufli and chats this is quite place. Taste of food is good. Kulfi falooda , Papri Chat , Masala Dosa , Mango Lassi , Rose Lassi are something you should have in this place.Waiters are good and quick in service. After shopping in new market area you can easily spend some bucks for titbits here.

This place located adjacent to the Sreeram Arcade, has been in existence for quite some time now. Nothing special about it- however this in an ideal place to catch your breath after a marathon shopping session in the New Market/Lindsay street area. Amidst the din and bustle of hawkers, constant cacophony of vehicles this place definitely provides some respite.It serves an array of vegetarian snack items-both the North and South Indian types. However i have found the South Indian variety to be tastier and well-made. The dosas served piping hot are crispy enough.The masala stuffing in the dosa is also pretty decent.However the north Indian chaat items are a disappointment. The dahi samosa chaat was not at all up to the mark. Apart from juices they also serve coffee again which was a letdown. 
Prices are average and this is strictly a junta category joint that serves a few tasty dishes.

Just beside Sreeram Arcade just opposite the incessant ear piercing scream of the hawkers and bustle of Esplanade shoppers is located the Friends Home Restaurant. The funny name of the place makes you smile and the feel good atmosphere makes the smile stay with you. A humble family food establishment, its not too fancy with minimum decor, clean tables and a dhaba style eatery feel. They offer a large number of vegetable dishes which are light on the pocket as well as nice to the tongue. The food doesn't arrive late at the table and the waiters are good mannered. The snacks section of the menu should be your top priority, the chaat, dahi chaat and the khasta chaat are heavenly. The south indian section is also nice with quite manageable Dosa prices and quite large sizes. With this place being in such a prime shopping area thronged by people throughout the year, I'm actually surprised at the low number of reviews for it.

Chakraborty Tip : This restaurant is a better option for affordable all round food than most other establishments in the immediate neighborhood. Head over.
