Nice nd comfortable for ppl who prefer mattress over chairs. Thick mattresses on d floor, colourful lights smoke from hookah basically make up d place. Didn't hv any food so can't comment on that although I'll update d review when I do..but we ordered hookah which was good. Overall a good place specially for a group of friends..only d mattresses and d place looked messy and untidy. They should keep d place tidier.

Located very near kankurgachi more,This place is open 24√ó7. Besides food ,they offer shisha, alcohol,and games too.
I've tried their dry chilli chicken many times,and loved it. Their Hunan Chicken and paan flavour shisha are good too. Service is a tad slow, and the interiors could do with a little more tidiness and upkeeping.

Disgusting place and disgusting service the bouncer out there and the cafe staffs are damn irritating they are like they are doing any charity by serving ppl... Management need to check this specifically for the little app deals as purchased after that they are not willing to redem them and harras the customers... Never ever saw such a disgusting cafe.... Any cafe and disc is much better than this place totally a waste of money.... No one should go to this place

I went there at 2:30am on 29th September along with 15 other people. The receptionist said that the cover charge is Rs.300/-, which is refundable. We had placed the order as soon as we gave the cover charge. When we asked if they would be able accommodate all of us together, they said that they can make the arrangements in 10 mins. We went upstairs and after sitting on the dance floor, switching seats and an hour of waiting, we finally got the seats. We again waited for 30 mins and then a waiter came up to ask for the order. We were already irritated because of their mismanagement, but still we thought of being considerate and placed the order again. We specified a lot of times that all items would be veg and one plate of fried rice would be without onion and garlic as one of us had fast. After eating this particular item, I realised that the taste was absolutely different and way too salty. The fried rice had chicken piece, pork pieces, egg and God knows what else was chopped into it. We already mentioned a lot of times that we wouldn't order any non-veg items, how can they be so so so irresponsible? When they came to know, one of the waiter came up with a wonderful suggestion that please ma'am, go an gargle. Who the hell are you to give me that suggestion? Firstly, you make us wait for so long and provide the worst possible service. Secondly, you don't have a bloody pen and paper to note down the order and make sure you serve the food on time. Lastly, you make such a blunder and give such bogus suggestions ? This is the terrible most place I have ever been to. Thanks for ruining my day and navratri ! Zomato should come up with negative rating, you guys don't even deserve 1 star.

Ordered --------- Veg Grilled Sandwich

(First time ever I will publish the CONS 1st.)

The CONS - Don't know from where should I start. I went there on Saptami during wee hours with many expectations but they started breaking off one by one. They took payment in advance for 300/- per head.

Deƒáor :- We went to the 3rd floor as 4th floor was booked already. As we enter we just saw was smoke everywhere coming from hookah that your lungs will choke & eyes will burn, no proper system for ventillation was present and for the deƒáor there's nothing much to say. Music was so loud that my eardrums were going to burst.

Staff :- They lacked professionalism & manners. When I asked for the filling for Russian Sandwich he was not able to answer.

Food :- It took much more time for serving just some sandwiches & some chips. It was not good too. It lacked cheese & nothing was new. Cost was 129/- but total amount got to 200/- saying it is including taxes but they didnt show any proper bill showing those taxes legitimately. They returned the remaining 400/- during exit.

The PROS - Atleast they had some helping attitude as they shifted us to a Pool table room so that we can eat our food without coughing & choking.I love the pool table room, no signs of hooliganism & It is also open for 24 hours as they said.

Looking for the late night snack I and my friend found this place to visit. We were stop to enter this place as my friend had crocs on. But they said we are allowing you now but to take care of it next time. When we went inside we saw their staff with slippers on and serving customers. Very bad customer service. The table we sat had a burned air conditioner which doesn't work. So it was pretty hot there. As soon as we paid off our bill the staff asked us to free the table for the guests waiting out. Even though we haven't finished our food and drink. The staff again and again approached us to leave as other customers are waiting. No customer service at all. Was very annoyed with such behaviour but no time and strength to argue with such people after a tiring day. Would not recommend this place to visit at all. Thank you The Firefly!

Average place. It's dark and shallow. The staffs aren't responsive. The food quality is pretty average. 
Pathetic service. The staff took nearly 20 mins to bring the cheque. After ordering a shisha, 2 cold drinks, one chicken chow and one chicken nachos the bill was around 980. After I paid the bill the staff took nearly extra 10 mins to bring the cash. And if you guys think the place was crowded, let me tell you it wasn't. I wouldn't suggest people to go to this place.

I'm very sorry to say that I was excited to visit this late night cafe for a long time but all my longings got shattered the moment I stepped in . It has the worst of all the ambiences I've ever been to , food was pathetic and so was the staff . I can understand that it  stays open late and there might be some issues with the management but not down to this level . I'm not going back there and will recommend not to . We had crispy chicken , 2 pegs of Blenders Pride and a Nirvana . That would be all as the place did not encourage to  have anything else and than you for such a disappointing experience .

A sudden plan with my bunch of friends made us visit this place.. as it was the nearest to our work place which can serve food and hookah as well.. we visited this place for the first time.. it has 3 floors of sitting and we were told to go on the 3rd floor. The place was not so big but the music was nice with high volume. It wasnt the peak hours so there were only two tables occupied.. it had a seating system with beds and not chairs in this floor. As we were all frienda we found it comfrtable enough to sit there.. we looked at the menu and ordered fr a orange and mint hookah which was around 309 bucks . We all were hungry so we ordered a chicken 65, chili cheese toast and a portion of chili garlic noodles.. to our expectation the chicken 65 was awesome but fr me rhe cheese chili toast was at par in terms of portion and taste as well.. the portion size for the noodle though was adequate with wonderful taste. But somewhere i felt the service personel were too casual in service while the food was served to us. No side plates were served and forks and spoons were to be asked for.. it could have been much better... 
Nevamind.  It was nice time there.. would go next time surely to try some other floors ambiencce nd service too..

Lol! I curse my luck why I just dropped in to this place few weeks ago. It was a lazy afternoon & we decided to play pool. So we hopped in! The pool table is itself not well kept. IGNORING it after a game we decided to do some snacking and the half sleepy waiters advices us to move a floor above. Dude! They had few mattresses on the ground and really tried hard to give a cabana vibe! NO WHERE CLOSE! The sheets on the mattress had some teddy bear print.NO BRO! You don't do that in a cafe for heaven sake. The room was designed in a very wrong fashion.Well,if you are fortunate/unfortunate then you can find some kids REALLY COZY.Anyway! We ordered for Vanilla Rasna and they took good 5 minutes to discover that they don't have it. Then we ordered teen paan rose and after long 20 minutes they came up with something shitty which was no were close to our choice of order. After putting up a word they gave us teen paan rose which was an example of how a shisha should not be made. Oh god! We ordered for cheese wai-wai and guess what! They just cooked the wai-wai and grated some cheese! No veggies no add ons! Presentation? WHATS THAT? I always had people telling me not to even think of dropping here! But I guess my Karma had some bitter plans!

The ambience is pathetic. It's pretty evident that the place is made out of residential flat. The structure of rooms, washroom, kitchens, everything is about visible. The seating arrangements include carpet, and some pillows which appear to have never been washed. The food is overcooked everytime I go there with my friends. However, the hookah is amazing. The staff ain't the best, but there's nothing to complain about them.
Avoid going if you want a good ambience.

Well good concept...

Dim lighting... amazing music system...
Now let's get to the food... didn't order much...
Only ordered Mix Sauce Pasta, White Sauce Pasta and Crispy Chilli Babycorn...yeah and hookah...
Babycorn and Hookah were good....
But the Pasta's...both the pasta lacked flavour... I don't know why whether the chef forgot to add salt or it was like that only...but if that's the usual pasta..then you must give some serious attention to it..
As Pasta's are commonly ordered by everyone..and my experience was seriously very bad...if I didn't had Oregano at that moment...then I wouldn't have had that....
Can improve...I visited the place as have always heard good name of the cafe...
Maybe something went wrong that particular day..may give a visit again..!!

The feeling of welcomeness embraces you just as you enter. A perfect place for hookah lovers. The cozy atmosphere adds to the ambience. Friendly staffs; ask for Ali Khan and take his advice on sheesha. Mind will be blown, guaranteed. Cheap prices. Must go..

Food is really nice. I tried Mix sauce Pasta, which was good only the first time they served it, the second time we ordered the same pasta, if was not upto the mark. Rissotto was horrible. Talking about the service, it was poor. I had to order the same thing thrice and only after that the order was placed.

Nice ambience. Live sports screening. Loud music.
Pretty dim lights and comfy seatings.
2sections. One on each floor of the building.
Had been to two. One has a large screening area and low sofa seatings. The other has ground seatings in depeeeate cubicle areas with drapes and lights.
Ordered for a decent vegetarian mixed sauce pasta..And it was good enough.
Visited at an odd timing for which many other dishes weren't prepped.

Imagine after poking them twice for AC they turned it on n after 15 mins they turned it off again ... We went about a month or two ago n it was Saturday or Sunday around 1 in d aftrnun ... This outlet is horrible don't know about the others. .. very poor service .. my friend really requested us to visit here as she found this place groovy , but she too was disappointed ...

I visited this place with my friends for the first time in November 2016 and found it pretty cool with its perfect ambience for hanging out with friends, pool table, live sports screening and it's 'make thirsty' drinks menu. I recently visited the cafe again and was disappointed to see it has descended from quiet special to not so special. The hookah is usual and not so different from other hookah bars. They were unable to serve stuffs from the food menu that should be readily available. The ambience needs a little maintenance. We ordered‚Äã a paprika pizza and the best I can give it is 2/5. They don't serve drinks anymore. Though it's still affordable and a nice place for spending hours with buddies.

Worst experience. We called them to place our order to which they said we need to place our order through 'online panda'-a  name which made us quite curious. After Googling online panda, we realized they meant food panda-which took about 20 minutes to place our order . Finally when we called to ask them if they had received the order, they said yes. We asked them if we could add a spinach roll to it. They said yes. Balls. Half an hour later, they called to say they don't have spinach roll, so we ordered Paneer tikka. When we finally got the order, we realized they had forgotten to put the Paneer tikka. When we called, we were told by a giggling voice at the other end that our order for Paneer tikka had never been placed. 
Sheer unprofessional behavior and the lack of proper service on their part will surely discourage us from ordering in the future. @shardha @pavishka 
1.5 is only for the pesto pasta, which always makes us happy.

It's one of the rare place in the north Kolkata with such a good ambiance,music ,decor, mostly filled with young crowd and very relaxing sitting arrangement.
The food and hookah quality and customer service in such a reasonable price just make it a must for next visit.
I have been there with frnds that was really a good tym, I casually asked the staff that do they have any offer going on or a discount coupon . I was surprised when they provide me a card which I can use in my next visit and get as assured 10%.

Food was great, ambience is something which was the best part, you play your own music, silos to sit and enjoy hukka. Service is a bit laggy, we had to call the staff multiple times. The place is divided in two floors, lower one has a pool table and the upper one is the bar and they are not connected. Costwise great but you can find noisy crowd sometimes. Great for casual and unplanned hangouts

The ambience was just perfect.. Not much brightness... Perfect fits to the eye. We were on the third floor and the staff was very friendly and helpful... There was methoon da who was just there whenever we call upon him.. He really thinks that the customer is king.. And treated us like that.. Hookah was okay.. But when we complained about it.. They had it replaced.. Thanks to bishu da.. Who made it.. 
We orders crispy chilly baby corn, sizzling pasta,Mexican rice with jacket potato.. Food was great... But they do need to focus on ccbc..
They even let you access the Bluetooth.. So that you can enjoy the songs you want 
A great place

We also ordered strawberry crush which was nicely prepared. The music here was soothing to the ears played by Mr. Adnan. Also the staff support by Mr. Asif is greatly appreciated. Overall a very nice place to hangout. Also the pocket pinch is fine. Cheers to the firefly team. :)

I am a very regular customer at this place,
I am very accustomed to the place, hookah and food of this place but my visit today was not fully satisfied because today's hookah was not upto the mark!! 
Though i was convinced that the branches PR Miss.Monami visited us and looked after our problem, this was a positive response from a consumers point of view!!

Though this place is good enough to bring your jam and enjoy, this review is negative because today's hookah didn't serve my expectations.

Thanks!!

Firefly is even enhanced with the deejay and the photographer. You get an awesome flow of songs and clicks.

A dimly lit go-to place for the night-owls, Firefly doesn‚Äôt disappoint on the flavour levels. Dragging on some shisha while you and your friends enjoy the breathtaking view over the city lights after a party is one of the experiences that this place will offer you and you shouldn‚Äôt miss.

This cafe is divided into three sections, a sitting area which looks like a home, a games floor consisting of pool and board games and a floor which has a lounge and a dance floor attached, apt for small private parties. The food here is great, high on quantity. the dance floor is small but the dj is good. Have even organized a party here which went smooth and management were nice and provided appropriate private time. Noodles and mixed sause pasta is recommended here.

Didn't wanted to rate them like this but unfortunately have to. We ordered veg & non veg food today separately specifically as Chaat Puja is going on and many of friends were strictly veg. And the shit occurred. They mixed the veg with non veg n 3 of our friends ate it. Literally, one of my Friends literally cried as he haven't had a single bite of non veg since birth. I was very wrong with them.the ambience is not that appealing. The DJ ,yes he is busy in playing his favourite tracks n busy with this friends..Baddddddd managementüòëüòëüòëüòë
Strictly improper. But would Like to appreciate their few noted staffs who came out of the restaurant just to apologise for the mistake.

Its located just beside the bandhan bank branch in kakurgachi..Ambience is preety good..service is very slow..you get a combination of hard drinks as well as hookah..food is good if not great.. But the biggest let down is the service..very slow..had asked for whiskey and took 15 mins to get it served..It felt like they had gone to cultivate it from somewhere..

Best part is its opened 24x7. Small and a very cozy place. 3rd floor became my favorite. We ordered for chicken 65 crispy chilli babycorn 4 toppings pizza seesha tuborg and jhonny walker. This place saves you a lot of money. Everything tasted fine. Pizza didn't have the toppings we wanted, disappointment. But customer service was amazing. All they need to do to keep a check on the hygiene. Rest very much recommended.

Love this place because they offer Late night Drinks in a place least expected. A bliss for salt lake residents being close and comparatively cheaper. Coming to the ambience...shady and dim lit club affair with lot of hookah smoke and loud music. The mash up collection is good and food is acceptable too...Do give it a try...you won't be disappointed. Note- carry cash as backup for their card machine seldom works!

Went to this place nearly 3 to 4 times, the place is good and even the hookah is nice. The problem was there only with the music as there was no arrangements for the music in the 3rd floor, the speaker need to be connected with the Bluetooth only so there was no control nor good music was played so it looked like a dumb place at the end. Not too happy with the arrangements.

One of the worst places I've visited, the staff is totally stupid and will harass you to any extent to charge you a few extra bucks. They call customers referring to them as 'bhai', they accept club solitaire card for discount but when asked to give it, they have a set of drama ready and it'll happen each time. Pathetic absolutely. The staff will ask you not to get the bill punched and take materials at lesser cost so that the money can go to his pocket. Unadulterated shit this place is.

Drinks at 2am in the morning....can you imagine that you will get a quite nice place with drinks and finger food, extremely cordial staff and the liberty to play songs from your bluetooth, free wifi so that you can work if you have logged off early from work.....all these are possible if you are at Firefly kankurgachi.....we were elated to know that this place exist wit these qualities and then the fact that it worked out well ensures we spread it through word of mouth and make visits again and again.....we ordered a few pegs of whiskey, and some french fries and chilli chicken....well i was nt there to eat but still the food was very much up to the mark and the service was prompt....probably we were the one of the 2 groups on a friday night....surprising coz many may nt be knowing about this place....so guys/gals reading this, please do pay a visit and you wont be dissapointed.....its open 24x7 and serves drinks at breakfast too...lol....they have 2 other floors from where loud music could be felt but the place we were at was serene....small sections with low height wooden tables...pillows all around to make you feel at home for a house party......i just loved the place nd its pretty reasonable too.....they gave us a 5% disc on food which didnt had a big impact since its only on food and we didnt ordered much....all in all, a place that calls for multiple visits and i will surely plus a place were you can always get in if you are out of drinks even post midnight....

I came here for the first time today and the fact that this hangout is open 24 hrs impressed me. We ordered some food from the Chinese cuisine and some pasta. The quality of food is decent considering you get a choice of food at 1:30 in the middle of the night.
The waiter debated with me over the fact that normal water can't be served and the water shall have to be purchased. As far as my knowledge is concerned no eating joint can refuse free drinking water at any time, the same is also implicated to the movie halls, airlines, etc. Would request the owners to please enlighten me on the same......
I have attached the photo of the bottle of 'The Firefly' brand of water that was served to me.
MRP Rs. 49 for 1L

The music is too loud and plays cheap songs. Place is too small. The sitting arrangement is not comfortable. Suited to midgets only. People of average height are gonna have trouble with very little leg space. Drinks are kinda cheap. Food doesn't have much variety. Hookah was good though. Liked the flavour. Went with friends because wanted to try out a new place. But we hardly stayed there for 30 minutes before deciding to leave. Not impressed.

The bar attender sunil was really nice and we had a one+ one offer as well but as soon as I paid the bill there came another attender called Uday and he was like trying to make us out of the club! It was not like we were doing something wrong... There was no one in the club apart from us.... But still he waited till we paid the bill and soon he was like showing the way outside.... I mean what was that!!! They claim that they are open 24*7 but they are not as long as people like Uday are there.

I have visited this place twice and both the times we had an issue with the bill. The first time we went for the offer 999 unlimited booze+hookah offer which is only valid for 2 hours. While we were at it we were served a garlic bread platter which we thought is on the house as we hadn't ordered for anything else. But when the bill came we had to pay for that as well, though we hadn't ordered for it.¬†This place charges a humongous amount of tax. We had just ordered for two Rs 999 unlimited drinks and the bill couldn't necessarily  go above 2500 Rs but it did. As they charged us for the garlic bread which we didn't order and then the huge amount of tax. 

My next visit to this place was on 23rd June, we were really famished so we ¬†ordered a Paprika pizza and ordered for two unlimited drinks for Rs 999 offer yet again.(same mistake twice!)¬†The bill shot up to a good Rs 3100+ for just two 999 Rs unlimited drinks order and a Paprika pizza worth Rs 269. An outrageous amount of tax was levied on the bill. We just went back to the place for the ambience and the comfortable seating area but the place is just not worth it. ¬† I had a 15% off voucher from ABP with me which they refused to accept saying it can't be applied on the 3rd floor which was not specified anywhere in my voucher.¬†They continued to argue with us that the unreasonable amount of tax levied on the bill was justified and even said "jo karna hai kar lijiye".. In the end we just left as it was getting late.

All the staff members are equally helpful and always there to be at your service. The staff which won my heart was Mr. Ali. Thank-you Bhaiya for always being there at my service when I visit the place. You are simply awesome.

This is one of the worst place I have been to... Guys below 18 are being served drinks freely.. N they too r drinking away to glory.... Guys there is something more than just making money n increasing the footfall.. It's called Business Ethics.... The staffs are least bothered about taking the orders.. Every one seems to b lost... If u guys are looking for a long term business prospect ...buckle up... The are many options in n around that place..

I and my friend went here one evening..an unnecessarily expensive one..the veg hakka noodles was for 129 whereas the waiter told us to order the chicken noodles(it wasn't mentioned in the menu).when we saw the bill the noodles was for 250 bucks..i don't know how do keep such prices..we were just shocked at the sight of the bill..bad experience..even the service was really slow.

The ambience for hookah place is good, but not so impressive. the place is perfect for relaxation. The lighting is fine. Watever the surroundings, the hookah is pretty good, and the food also. the service is also good. But didn't like their billing part. They added drinks and food bill altogether and then charged 20% tax. This isn't expected.

WORST !!! Today for the first time I ordered through ZOMATO and the service sucks .Home delivery ¬†was not upto the mark. I ordered special cricket combo i.e, Kohli Cover drive combo which includes Hakka noodles + manchurian¬†+ crispy chilli baby corn + coke. They happen to deliver only three things and forgot Chilli Baby Corn.¬†Also ¬†coke bottle was of glass and they asked me to empty it. I mean what the hell was that. You can take extra penny but please provide a plastic bottled coke. This is not the way. Please, Improve.Anyways, as an apology, they credited 80Rs on my Zomanto wallet. ¬†But this is not the way you forget the order then you credit points.
No Doubt ¬†The Firefly provides tasty food but when it comes to service you should take care of that. You can loose customers.

Located in kakurgachi this place is all over the 2nd to the top floor..
Starting with the 2nd floor which has a psp section, a private room having a sitting capacity 7-8 ppl wer u cn njoy food hookah drinks and poker aswell, then comes the outside section which has 2 pool tables blocking sticks on all the sides i dnt knw why the management planned to put side by side two tables with soo much less space.
Then moving on is the 3rd floor wer you will find yourself in a mujra sort of environment having sitting beds all over the side lines of the room not pretty likely though..
Then comes the 4th floor dancing floor stole lighting in appropriate sitting conditions.
There is a roof top not visited soo cnt say hw it was...

Now for the food and hookah and service its better then the whl ambience of it.. The service is a bit slow but the service staffs are too friendly to cop it up.. the food quality and taste is also good..

Located near Kankurgachi Pantaloons. We had to wait for 30 min approx for getting a seat. You will find school and college crowd mainly. The interior is segmented in a coop style with each one having mattress, small table and pillow. The lighting is fine. Its a vegetarian cafe so we ordered Crispy Chilli Baby Corn and Hakka Noodle (extra spicy) which tasted good. In drinks we had Kingfisher Beer due to unavailability of other brands.

Good ambiance, and good place to have a personal party but ONE AND THE BIGGEST DISSAPOINTMENT it's a VEG restaurant. Thumbs down and the spoiler.
So Vegans enjoy and a big no no for me. 
And Lastly Card was not accepted in payment. Don't know if it happens regularly saying server issue.

The 4th Floor was was just perfect for my 30-35 guests with it's cool ambience, dance floor and awesome food. We had ordered almost half of its Menu Card and each item was too good.

This place is not worth it at all. The pub is tiny, Hookah is useless and their offers are illogical. I went to this plae many times and every time I find the Hookah is Awwwwwwwww. No improvement inspite of repeated complains. There are many other good places in kolkata in terms of pricing of boose...I recommend this place is not worthy to party..

Perfect place to hang out. Be sure to get spoilt with options around and yes the best part is that you get different floors with different themes. So if you wanna be a sport choose the sports floor or want to spend time with your friends in leisure choose the cabanas or in a party mood choose the bar with loud music and lots of drinks. Your leisure time or favorite PS/Pool game won't get spoilt by loud music or your party mood won't get spoilt by people spending their leisure time. 

For the Food part I would just say, I am a big time Foodie but still I leave it to the ladies and trust me guys my WIFIE loves the BabyCorns and the Pasta's and Pizza's with an undefended Hookaahhhh!!!

And yes last but not the least this place is like if you remember "Yaar ki Shaadi hai theme of Manyavar ad" Firefly Yaaron ka adda hai.

It is weird - this is the first place I'm reviewing without even visiting. 
They claim to be open at 8:00 a.m and I accidentally happened to be there this morning at 9:00 and found the place shut.  To my disappointment- I had to return empty stomach because there's rarely any other cafe in the same area which opens this early. 
Work on it management.

Heard the place is owned and run by a pair of CA's.

Being a CA student myself, I know CA's prefer money over almost everything. But that doesn't mean you ill treat or take for granted the customers having offer coupons which you people let out for sale over other apps.

We went to the 3rd floor and asked for the redemption of the coupon, they sent us to the 3rd floor saying, " Sir offer ka sab upar hota hai."

Okay upar Chalo. The gentleman on the 4th Floor says, " Sir Wo offer ka liye Toh 3rd floor jaake boliye yahan pe nai hoga."

Nothing new happens at the 3rd floor again. We were just exercising moving up and down their floors until finally we were obliged enough to have been seated in the 4th Floor section which was only bearable because the coupon provided us with 2 hookah at Rs. 349 and the hookah was kind of good.

Please don't let down the reputation of our profession guys. If someone is having coupons, either treat them equally our don't bring out such offers without proper disclaimers. Some of your staff members are really good otherwise the rating wouldn't even be a 2.

Ever since I discovered this place, I've been visiting too regularly! Great food! Awestrucking Ambience! Super friendly staff. I love their Hookah specially Shahi Paan and Brain Freezer. üòç
The only disappointing factor is that they don't serve Non-Veg. :'(
Obviously that shouldn't stop anyone from visiting this superb outlet.
Live music and the fact that they allow to play your own playlist...adds to its beauty!

Having heard of the place quite a number of times finally decided to visit it with a nearbuy voucher. The hookah was made very well just the way we wanted it to be. The mocktails and the cheesy garlic bread we ordered were also quite satisfying. The biggest drawback of the place is the space constraint. It seems like they have somehow managed to adjust two pool tables in the space of one. It gets freakishly irritating when a game is going on at both the tables. Overall not a place for playing pool rest is good :)

My friends and I had visited in the first month of opening of this place and were left bitterly disappointed. A dead place. The place seems like your ordinary room with disco lights and sofas and hardly gives you the feel of a parlour. Food is BAD. NOT WORTH THE MONEY.

Its a regular hangout place for me. The place never disappoints. The hookah served is good but the food steals the show! Every dish I have ever had was absolutely delicious. Never faced any problem regarding the food. The staff is a little unorganized but other aspects nullify that. One must try the Mexican rice with jacket potato, the chef's special garlic bread, all types of pasta, crispy chilli babycorn, Hakka noodles but precisely everything on the menu is brilliant!

It's just nearby my house but never really got a chance to visit it. But a month ago they had hosted a Halloween party and I went with my friends. It not only lived up to my expectations but surpassed it. This massive cafe covering over 4 floors has everything to offer which you can think of. Be it hookah, cuisines, alcohol, pool, PS4, dance floor, board games, combos. I just loved the food and the concept of the cafe. A little change in the ambience could make it one of the best cafe in Kolkata. I heard they are starting breakfast. Will be there. Guys do visit. :)

An amazing place to hangout with friends. The cafe spans across 4 floors the first of its kind. The royal floor which is basically for all the hookah lovers has an amazing and comfy seating arrangement. The hookah is just crazy.
One floor is dedicated to gamers with pool tables and PS4 where one can take hookah too and avail combos . They have a private room at that floor. The top most floor is more of a disc having a dance floor, bar and a very friendly resident DJ. Plus the alcohol is reasonable too. Then they have a open rooftop which is perfect for winters. The food there is too good. Especially the pasta and the crispy chilly baby corn. The staff and receptionist is also friendly. Worth a visit. Will visit again and again. :)

This was my order from zomato for the first time. And it was the most wasteful waste of money that I ever made. This 7" diameter margarita pizza costs Rs. 259. There was no such size mentioned. Moreover, it was delivered after more than an hr of placing the order and cold to the touch. Please don't ever order this pizza. Highly not recommended.

A nice Cafe and a full apartment divided into different floors for various activities. The top floor has the Cafe with big screen and optional discotheque lighting. We ordered frenchfries, crispy babycorn, veg and corn cheese balls( must have) and chilly stuffed potato as starters. Cola flood and brownie shakes are also recommended and must havs. Finally we ordered Italian risotto, hakka noddles, pesto basil and red sauce pasta. The place also provides hookah and has a special decoration arrangements for bday parties. Nice and prompt service are also an addon.
You may give it a try but the place needs to add something different since the place is similar to the place "smash street" in saltlake.

The staff is not well informed, the crowd is the most annoying there can be.
Hookah was terrible, with no smoke.
And the ambiance ? Lol !
The word ambiance is an overstatement for the place.

They have tried to make a lounge in a RESIDENTIAL BUILDING !
The place is as small as a room. 
The place has no ambiance.
So overall,
Hate the hookah
Hate the ambiance
Hate the crowd
Hate Fire Fly.
So not coming back again !

I visited the place today evening around 4,they were yet to open up properly.We went to the rooftop first but that doesn't open before 7, so we moved downstairs.The restaurant has 4floors in total for billiards,hooka,prebooked parties and the rooftop.The ambience was very cosy and the staff was pretty well behaved. I had a virgin mojito,mexican sizzler and crispy chilli babycorn!The virgin mojito and crispy chilli baby corn were good,but didn't like the mexican sizzler much. Great place to hang out with friends and have hour long chats in a super comfortable atmosphere. Overall loved it and would definitely visit again with my friends.

After 3 experiences, my review is as follows:

The food is pathetic. I ordered spaghetti (arrabiata) and it was leaking of oil. Orange oil. The taste is horrible. So much so that I could not take a second bite!

We also ordered crispy chilli baby corn. It was a far cry from CRISPY baby corn. It was soggy and soft.

Then there was Mexican rice and jacket potato. The Mexican rice was also orange!!! ( I ve never seen orange coloured Mexican rice). It looked like they used the same sauce for the orange pasta and Mexican rice. Needless to say, it was also horribly prepared. Nothing abt it was right. 
The jacket potato was still decent. But the potato was as hard as a rock!!

Even though the delivery experience was decent but the food killed it.

It is high time they got a new cook!!

This place I must say is amazing. Its one of the best place I have visited so far. Recently I had a chance and I grabbed it. And to be fair its a marvellous place. The atmosphere is sophisticated and surrounding so amazing you will end up admiring it.  Now coming to the food, its mouth watering. I don't know what my sis ordered but whatever it was, it was heavenly. I just cant get my mind off and I think I need it once more or even more. A place to hang out with your friends. But even of you are going with your siblings and they are just like you, you will end up admiring it.  You will surely enjoy a lot.

Just beside CCD kankurgachi. This place has so much to offer.. Different floors sport a different theme including a gaming zone.. They also have dance floor if u wanna sway to the music after sheesha.. Good food.. Sober pricing.. And rest go see for yourself.. A word of advice.. The receptionist is very friendly.. Take her advice as to what you can do to make the best out of your time spent there.. Have a good evening.. :)

Good ambience, tasty food, overall a nice experience. The seating arrangement on the first floor is amazing, but the second floor isn't half as good as the one below. The hookah is a bit too mild, for my liking, but the quality of food is well above average. Overall, a good hangout joint for youngsters.

It was my first visit to this place last sunday n in all probability its the last aswell.This is the first restaurant I found who serve food but no REGULAR DRINKING WATER. After serving food they won't even bothered to ask u abt water.when I asked for the same they said they only serve packaged water.dont know if this is legal or not a resto situated in the heart of a metropolitan city serving only packaged drinking water !
well till then it was still fine..next wat came was a shocker to me.that 10 bucks(500ml) packaged water was charged 29 in the bill n on top of that they had added 14.5% vat n 5.6% service tax for that bottle of water. Well wat service they provided God knows..they just placed a bottle of water on the table n niether opened the same nor served it in a glass.leave aside serving in a glass they didnt even had the courtesy to put a glass on the table. is dat service? VAT on packaged item that too water which they blatantly refuse to serve regular one? I dont know if this is legal.if its so they r really making use of the flaws of law and if not something needs to be done.

This place is situated right on the main road just near CCD in kankurgachi..
The ambience was OK but the only annoying thing was the loud music which was causing disturbance in the conversations
Hookah along with the food which we ordered was good..

It's really really good. 1st floor has pool. 2nd floor has a nice n comfy seating arrangement. U can play every board game u know of. 3rd floor has a dance floor with DJ. DJ is osm. Food is osm. Hookah is osm. Watermelon-gum flavour hookah is a must try. I've been here a lot of times with frns. We ordered garlic bread, gravy noodles, Manchurian, white sauce pasta(apt amount of all ingredients), French fries, and NACHOS! I've not had a better nachos in any other hookah parlour of the city. Ambience is dark and suites my taste. A verrrryyyyyyy nice place to hang out. Home delivery is quick too. Slightly expensive, but worth it.

i have been to firefly 4 to 5 times and have had bad experience each time. one ¬†of the worst hookah cafe i have ever been to. i ordered a pan thanda kiwi gum and a royal pan brain freezer hookah both was below average, the staffs are not friendly and they dont accept their mistakes, every time they promise that they will improve their service but that does not happen. will recommend not to visit.

I visited this place few days back with my friends. It is near my house but still I was not sure, so I took a chance. Honestly I liked the d√©cor and the cozy ambience. Definitely a good place for hangout with friends. Pocket friendly for large groups. Foods are decent but I felt a bit more professionalism is needed. Earned another visit.

I went there last month. I was not too sure about this place but since we had no other option to celebrate friend's birthday at such a short notice, we thought of giving it a try. To my surprise, the place was far better than I had expected. They have this beautiful rajasthani style cabanas on the 3rd floor one of which was reserved for us. I have no idea about the gaming section of the 2nd floor because we headed towards the 3rd floor directly. Great food, decent service, friendly ambience, good value for money. I'll certainly be back and recommend to friends. The only thing I didn't like about The Firefly is why don't you people switch over to proper music system instead of playing songs on 'MTunes' channel (atleast use music DVDs). Nevertheless, we had a great evening:)

Huuuuuggee joint it is. Spanning across 4 floors, this joint gives great food and drinks and hookah. The 2nd floor is the gaming zone having pool , board games, PS4 etc. The third floor is only for hookah lovers with seating in Rajasthani style. Nice outing here. Next up is the 4th floor having Dj and bar zone. The drinks are way too over priced. Last is the open rooftop. We ordered the Mexican rice with jacket potato, American corn and wai wai Bhel. All were great to have. 
Will come again with a bigger gang next time.

I had visited the place just yesterday. The blaring loud music was enough for me and my friends to leave without even sitting down for a minute.
If I am not mistaken it's a 3 floor joint with the rooftop(hell hot) too so atleast make 1 of the floors comfortable enough for people who go to cafes for spending time with their friends and not to listen to songs..

Visited the 3rd floor, nothing special, staffs are not trained, they dont pay attention to the tables. Mexican rice with jacket potatoes was horrendous and gave me food poisoning. Sweared to never visit this place again. Hookah was just okay. Though some catchy quotes are hung on the staircase for a good selfie craze click. That is it. Disappointed.

I went there twice but certainly not going back unless I am stranded and left completely option-less.
The decor is very good and so is the hookah but what kills it is the loud blaring music that makes it impossible to carry out a conversation.We repeatedly asked the staff to lower the volume but they kept turning it up after every 5 minutes.
Coming to the food, we had ordered crispy babycorn, the quantity was very good but picking it up with a fork seemed challenging. It tasted bland.
  

Edited- i am visiting this place after a long time and surprisingly it has improved a lot! Its remarkable. The food has improved as well. Looking forward to visiting again.

We visited this place on a Sunday evening..it is jus next to ccd kakurgachi and it has 4 floors..we wanted to goto 4th floor because it has a small dancing floor.. the place is quiet well kept and the dj was nt dere so v became the dj ourself which was quiet fun because v played the song ourselves and danced on them bt the disappointment was the sound which was quiet a turn down...
We ordered three different hukkahs teen paan rasna and a normal pan flavour..hukkah was ok ok....the coal was a difficult to keep because of the AC...
To come to the food part we thought of some spicy stuff which included baby corn white sause and mix sause pasta chilly panner and all were quiet tasty to the buds..
Virgin mohjito was the best bt it had sugar crystals coming in mouth which should nt happen(hahaha)
Bt as we were 10 we had a fun time because v grooved on out own numbers being the dj and crowd ourselves..
The service were okay as their were quiet slow and could nt listen due to sound...
All in all a hookah parlour in kakurgachi is quiet a nice place for a hangout.hookah can be improved and so the service.

Now coming onto there hookah "Wrost hukka ever had"  it was an Guava chillam based still der was no smoke density at all.  It lasts around 30-40mins (Depends on the room environment)  but our hukka lasted 15mins only..  I know they hv a good market,  but yes I'm talking about there 4th floor. 2nd gaming zone nd 3rd floor is quite good..  But agn hookah makers need to change..

Poor place. Staffs are extremely non co operative. No logic at all. Unbehaved staffs. These people are only interested in money making and not a single percent focus on customer satisfaction. There was a time wen i was regular to this place and after been asked by THE FIREFLY staffs to refer this place to others, tried doing that but now off today because of the misbehaviour personaly wouldnt recomend anyone specially my known to visit this place at all. Poor. Threw money on the face of the staff today when misbehaved. They think they have the best cafe and no other cafe left in kolkata. Annoying. Hopeless. Absolute last time!!! Worthless. As per rating is considered negative rating is also not sufficient.

Had a great experience, better than the first experience. It consists of different floors. Game station, cabin type, n finally a lounge. I went first time to cabin type. These time it was at lounge. Staffs were cordial and friendly. Food were awesome. Quality and quantity was great. Can't complete the food as the quantity was too much. Sufficient for two people. They had a booking in the lounge. Still they allowed us to seat. Behavior was good. We had ordered corn cheese balls, cheese risotto, American corn pepper salt, Virgin Mojito, Kitkat shake, Rosti Al peak. 

Cheers!

Nice vibe and ambience! Seating arrangement is good. The hookah could have been better. We ordered for babycorn and pasta which was again not that lip smacking. Overall a good place to chill and hangout with its pool facilities adding to the charm and  customer friendly service.

This is an oasis in Kankurgachhi , with so many happening cafes opening in the south of Kolkata, this has definitely made a mark as a happening spot of north kol. The ambience is very cool and cozy at the same time, the music is happening, the service is fast as well as warm and to top it all the food is delicious !!! I have tried masala tea, chinese, cold coffee , pasta and mock tails here ! all are just superb ! its definitely the joit where m gonna celebrate my birthday next :)

This review was in the drafts for a long time now. Somehow, I did not feel the urge to review it, maybe I was looking for another visit. Anyways, here is the snippet from my first visit. 

From the outside, there is only one hoarding that tells you about the firefly. To check in you must, fill your details in a visitor directory. Yes, it did raised few questions in my mind. Sitting on the 3td floor, is very laid back & comfortable, more of a homely feel it gives. The decor is not that great but decent, lighting is good. New hookah flavors are a fresh change from the usual. Chinese bhel tasted good too. 

Try if you're looking to experiment.

Ambience is good and different but the service is bad ..  Half the thing they don't have ready but it's their menu. Me and my friends ordered for Hakka noodles which was half boiled and Mexican rice which God knows what was they have served, we had wasted half food .. Even for the cold drink the don't keep proper stock.. Very disappointed and will recommend not to visit. As the quality of food is not good

initially when the place started, it has newness and the service and food quality was very good. But over a period of 2 months, the place almost lost all the good factors, the crowd is cheap, the ambience is not meeting up the standards and the services have lowered down below standards. The only good thing about the place is the Wi-FI connectivity rest all needs work out.¬†

There are no worthy offers and the staffs couldn't communicate in reasonable English. The seating has no options but on floor bed sitting which is really uncomfortable, the only thing i would recommend the management to live upto the mark and make it to the standards.

My first review for zomato actually.. :) 

Location - Situated near HDFC bank. Opp. Pantaloons (Kakurgachi). Just few walks from Go Green restro.

About the Place - 1st floor is for pool lovers.. And may be some other recreational stuffs as per what their staff had said. 3rd floor is dedicated to hookah completely. 4th floor is lounge cum bar. But they haven't got the bar licence yet. They are also planning for roof top restro.. Waiting for that. :-) 

Ambience - Hookah Section - Its a room actually segregated into different small sections with large padded cushions on which one can sit or laze around. Environment is totally bluish with dim lights all over.

Food - We ordered Al Sikandari Sheesha, crispy chilly baby corn and fresh lime soda.. Sheesha was perfectly made as we felt all the flavours in it.. Baby corn was strictly ok. Though it was crisp. But the sweetness factor was more in it.. 

Conclusion - Its a nice place to hangout with buddies with good ambience and cheap food.

Report Card:
Location - 5/5
Ambience - 4/5
Food - 3/5

The worst setup i have ever seen as a hookah cafe !
Never had such a bad food in my life .. If they offer you food for free dont ever try or else u would end up paying hue hospital bills for food poisoning !
Worthless place !

The place is one of a kind as it has 4 floors  each having something to offer . 2nd floor happens to be a restaurant and the 3rd floor is a hooka place . Setup of 3rd floor is cleshay and it is very evident that the owner has gone for cost cutting . Hooka is a yes . Haven't tried it's food as the place seemed to be shady and the setup to be very cheap .However restaurant is properly furnished . You might just give it a gamble.

I got all excited seeing this hookah lounge very close to my place. Went there on Saturday. Nice adda zone! Hookah is cheap and moderate. A bad point is that they allow you to have a coal change only once per hookah, that too paid. The paneer chilli dry was pretty good. Good music is the best part of this place. However ambience could have been wayyyy better. It looks quite creepy actually. Service was quite decent. But though they said they accept cards, it took a hell lot of time. Finally had to pay by cash.
