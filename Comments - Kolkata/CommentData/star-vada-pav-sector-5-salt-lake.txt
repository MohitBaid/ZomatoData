Authentic Vada Pav but a bit expensive. You can get lot of varieties over there. Try out for Samosa Vada Pav.
The taste resembles to one you get in Mumbai.. Worth a try

It is a kiosk with no sitting arrangenents.

Service is bit slow.

Tried Star Cheese Vada Pav , which was nice but still nothing to rave about. I hope it would have been more cheesy.

Non veg variants also available.

Pocket pinch is cheap . 

A nice place to satisfy hunger pangs.

"Star Vada Pav"  A famous food joint to have vada pav . It is one of the costliest vada pav seller in Mumbai but it’s worth it because of it’s unique taste . Nice to see their impression in Kolkata. It is made wid full hygenic . The vada pav with chutney is perfectly a perfect combination. The ambience there is a counter stand up eatery but still the best place where you get more hungry after eating the mouth watering " vada pav".
Located opposite to Infinity Benchmark, Sec V. Placed in one of most happening place in Sec V. They also serve non veg pav. But somehow I feel Pav is best in classical veg form only.

Pros :- 1.Very economic 2.Non veg variety available as well

Cons :- 1.Slow service 2.Very average taste 3.Unprofessional Staff

What we had :- Cheese Vada Pav (tasted very much average and the cheese quality/quantity was not apt enough to satiate our taste buds)

Double decker mumbaiyya vada pav (average)
Chicken dilwala double decker vada pav (good)

You may try it once for a cheap bite when u r hungry but it wont be a huge miss if u choose not to try..

Recommendation :- Try the chicken vada pavs.

Note :- They are listed as a 24 hours open restaurant but when we went there one day at 7 am, the staff was sleeping...and when he woke up he said its closed...i answered back saying that it is listed as a 24 hours open outlet and then he responded saying that he needs another 30 minutes atleast..total unprofessional behaviour..

Quick Review:
This place is located in Salt Lake Sector 5, beside RDB and opposite to Infinity Benchmark. 

Note : If you hail from Maharashtra or used to stay in Maharashtra and also used to like the traditional Vada Paw, then don't even think of visiting this place. You might get upset.

The concept is more of a Burger which is less priced and they do have a long item list under the menu. The best part about this place is that it remains open at night and you can take care of your hunger without spending much.

Just one more thing . They server both Veg and Non-Veg "Vada Paw's" and beverages are also available to quench your thirst. :-)

Had visited many times, 
Had Classic vada paw, Shezwan one and cheese grilled vada paw and cold drink!

Classic vada paw doesn't matched the authentic taste of Mumbai, and was like a burger!
Shezwan vada paw was good and had the spicy tangy taste.
Cheese grilled was surprisingly good but as mentioned earlier the food doesn't taste like a vada paw but burger!

Only disappointment was cold drink which doesn't had fizz in it!

Vada Pav is no more a poor man's burger!!
Star Vada Pav is serving this Maharashtrian snack here in Kolkata at their multiple stalls. They serve both veg & non-veg Vada Pav with other munchies like wraps, rolls that you can have to satisfy your cravings. Spicy Paneer vada pav is a must try option there. One this which I noticed that Star Vada Pav keeps on experimenting with their menu card which is a good thing if you want your customers to try different variations without making them feel bored of the same old menu. 😉

Went to this outlet of star vadapav some days before and was literally disappointed. First of all the service personnel was trying to up sell right before I placed the order and was giving several options before I chose what I wanted to have. 
I enquired about what would they give on the vadapav and the answer was what you normally get. This kind of answers are not at all expected. And after that when I received the actual food it was no way similar to the picture that they have provided.
        He was unable to answer that what cheese he was using. And on top of that when the picture showed of cheddar cheese they served basic processed cheese. He also added that the food never matched with the picture. Lastly the food quality was below ordinary. 
I would suggest the management team should look upon the well being of this outlet and rectifying their mistakes in the long run.

This rating is just for sufficing our hunger. Orelse this outlet is pathetic. The staff, the food, the taste, the deception which they did with us is a huge turn off! I don't know what kind of people have food from this food stall. First of all the pic which they have displayed is not at all matching with the food they serve. Second of all just to give a vada pav they took ten minutes, in between they were busy talking and making their own future plans! When i asked which cheese the gave, they where like what is cheeeese??( maybe thinking in mind about something else) How can this outlet appoint such staff? And coming to the taste of the veg something vada pav, they gave it in between burger buns as per our choice, the patty was desert dry, the chutney was not enough, tomato n cucumber did not give fresh taste to it (maybe it was not freshly cut) and the amul cheese could not help much as well. So it was a pathetic experience. It was better to fill our empty stomach with road side dhabas.

A little different variety of the vada paos from mumbai local cuisine. Though many people argue to like it simple, but I love the addition of cheese, schezuan sauce, alu tikki and other variety of fried nuggets to the pao. The sauces adds the icing on the cake. Never fails to fill up my tummy and heart while longing for a quick snack. Needs to increase variety.

Was still somewhat hungry after completing my light lunch, so decided to walk into this place for a quick light snack. The outlet is pretty small and conveniently situated nearby the RDB Cinemas, Sector 5. No seating arrangements are possible due to dearth of space. I went for their Makai Palak Vada Pav, with butter grill priced at just Rs. 45/-. The vada pav was prepared live and served in quick time. Food presentation is nice and size is fine. Also, it had the desired crispiness since it was finely grilled. The vada inside had decent palak taste as well as some corn which improved the taste a lot.

What reduced my joy was the somewhat excess garlic content as well as spice. Also, I feel that complimentary ketchup packs should have been provided along with the vada pav.

Staff service is very nice and the guy who prepared the vada pav made every efforts to meet customer demands. Overall, one can definitely try out this place for a light bite!

About six-seven of us ordered once from Star Vada Pav as we were hungry, broke and curious to know about this place. It was probably our grumbling stomach or our pragmatic expectations, but Star Vada Pav really did not disappoint us. I had a Grilled Cheese Vada Pav and since I did not know what to expect, I liked mine and would probably order it again. :)

Taste of the vada pau was moderate. Not a big fan of it, so didn't quite matter. Just had to fillup my stomach a little which it did.
But yet oje thing i can say, it lacked butter. If it would have been more buttery, it would have been better.

It's cheap @25 the classic vada pav. If you grill or take extra cheese you gonna have to pay Tsn15 xtra.
All in all its  a good place to drop by to have an unhealthy snacks 😂

I am not new to Vada Paw as I have stayed for a decade in Mumbai. A standard Classic Vada Paw at Rs25 is good. add to it the cheese layer for just Rs15. They make it fresh and wrap it in butter paper. Its value for money and just ok when your are feeling a bit hungry. 
I will keep coming star vada paw.
All said and done it lacked and butter which they applied in front of Sion railway station.. or the tangy and sharp masala in the alu of the vada.. However, its the best what you get here.

There is this small kiosk near RDB, Saltlake, since I work nearby, I find it convenient for grabbing a bite or two between short breaks. The best thing about this place is the low price of menus, and in that range i will have to say that the food is quiet amazing. I have quiet a few favourites like the cheese unglis, the cheese grilled vada pav and the schezwan vada pav. I am waiting to try the others when i get time and i will put up my experiences.

Situated just opposite the Infinity building, this vada pav outlet is open 24*7.  I liked the concept of having the mumbai vada pav in various fusion forms. We had their classic jumbo vada pav (with extra cheese) and cheese ungli. They have a "offer of the day", in which every day of the week one of their items is provided at a lesser price than the actual,we got the cheese ungli at 20 rs less than its price of 50. The vada pav was very soft and just the right amount of spice,with oozing cheese! The cheese ungli had 5 finger sized cheese sticks fried in bread crumbs,and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was all cheese and green peas and no other filling to cut cost. Overall a nice, clean & hygienic joint for a quick bite,any time of the day, or night!

Small stall in Sector V, Salt Lake near Cafe Coffee Day Lounge. I tried Crunchy Vada Pav. It was ok type. They do not provide any chutney with the vada pav. You can get mayonnaise but at extra cost. Simply not acceptable. I have had vada pav from other places. Some provide chutney along with it and some even cheese and mayonnaise, without any extra cost. The behaviour of the staff was appalling. They were quarreling among themselves and throwing things around in front of the customer. It was quiet evident that the staff was less educated and far from the ABC's of customer service. 

I also ordered another item for takeaway. They were so busy in quarreling that they did not paid attention to it. Poor poor service.

Today being Ganesh Chaturthi which is celebrated as a public festival in Maharashtra, let us discuss about some food which is native to the state of Maharashtra. It is quite easy to guess, and yes it’s Vada Pav. It is basically one vegetarian fast food dish which has deep fried mashed potato patties in ginger, chilli pepper, etc between two breads called Pav, and the filling inside is called Vada. It is basically the common man’s food in Maharashtra and it is basically very cheap and affordable. So when we located one such branded Vada Pav kiosk in our vicinity in Kolkata, I decided to visit this place and yes, with one of my Maharashtrian friends who helped me even further with this review.

LOCATION - - - - - The stall is located just outside RDB Boulevard building in Sector 5 near SDF crossing and Infinity Thinktank building. It is quite close to the outlet of  Yellow Straw and Wow Momo.

AMBIANCE - - - - - This is one small kiosk and has got no seating arrangements, so there is no ambiance as such. The kiosk looks pretty clean and has enough space for two people to stand inside and prepare / deliver the food. The décor of the kiosk is pretty moderate and it could have been better. It has the menu printed and pasted all over the stall, so it’s pretty easy to check out stuffs and place your order in a jiffy.

FOOD - - - - -  They have got the classic Maharashtrian Vada Pavs and some other stuffs which look just like burgers, or rather Veg burgers rather than any sort / variant of Vada Pav (for example, their Tandoori Paneer Vada Pav). We decided NOT to try burgers from them which are termed as Vada Pavs and my Maharashtrian friend stepped forward to place the order which was supposed to be very basic. Here it is:

(a) Classic Vada Pav: Vada Pav being the most humble street foods of Mumbai, we wanted to try out this classic version to check the real taste of Vada Pav at this branded outlet. Well, I felt it was overall too dry, no green chutney, sweet tamarind chutney or salted green chillies were provided. The filling inside or the batata Vada was nice but it was very basic fried mashed potato with dry  Pav buns, hence overall it was pretty average to taste and too dry. 

(b) Masala Vada Pav: It was tad better than the classic version for the batata vada inside which had some more ingredients in it compared to the classic version. But I somehow felt the absence of freshly chopped coriander leaves in that potato mixture. Again no additional green chutney, sweet tamarind chutney or salted green chillies were served along with this dish. My Maharashtrian friend rated this place just 2 out of 5 due to the taste and poor ‘value for money’ quotient. I was pretty embarrassed in the end to bring him to this outlet, but anyway he made me feel good since he was able to try some sort of vada Pav away from home :)

SERVICE - - - - - It took them a pretty long time to prepare these basic Vada Pavs, we were getting bit edgy in the end when they served our food. The servers are pretty polite otherwise and there were no issues interacting with them.

Summary - - - - - Here are my granular ratings:

Food quantity: 3.2/5 
Food quality: 2.8/5
Food presentation: 2.6/5
Value for money: 2/5 
Service: 3/5

Overall, we felt this place should make some effort to get more authentic and try to serve better quality food products because these are the initial days of this branded chain and they can stay here for long (maybe ages) if they can somehow build a solid goodwill. Comments and criticisms should be taken positively and should be worked upon to improve from this point.

Cheers!

A very small joint that serves hot vada pav, which they take lot of time to make and serve. Yet the pavs taste okay (not so delicious) and the quantity is sumptous. 
Overall good but again not attractive for non-vegetarian like me.

This is an outlet so I will mainly comment on the food. One thing is for sure. Its hard to get servers' attention.
I visit this place mainly because I miss Mumbaiya vada pav. And this place at least serves the purpose of reminding me what it tastes like. Classic vada pav which actually reminds you off a fluffy aloo vada and spicy garlic paste is normally not available. But yeah.. If you are in Sec V, leaving office and missing Mumbai, you can try this or Toaste Adda.. I'll say that this is probably the second best spot for vada pav in Kolkata following Gupta Brothers.

3.5 rate... is it correct ?... I think to judge this place u should visit this place once readers... For me it was a confused & mixed reaction.

Taste wise its was not so good but quantity wise it was good.

In one sentence: COULD HAVE BEEN BETER..

Location: Outside RDB Adlabs, Sector - V.

Star Vada Pav is another budding vada pav serving chain just like Goli. And with the time passing by, it has successfully opened nearly six kiosk-type outlets across Kolkata. Happened to discover this outlet which surprisingly functions round-the-clock (24 Hours), silently pulling the fast-paced IT people and successfully impressing their tummies. Thus, drop by for a quick bite whenever in the area. About the fare, the menu had a number of different types of Vada Pavs to suit the varying palates of which the following were called for:

- Grilled Cheese Vada Pav
A crisp and non-greasy Vada made of mixed vegetables sandwiched along with a slice of cheese between a horizontally slit-bun with coriander chutney as a spread. Overall, tasted good.

- Tandoori Paneer Vada Pav
This was a bummer. The specimen picture and the received product were poles apart. The specimen pictures resembled the McSpicy Paneer of McDonald's but, the product wasn't anywhere near.
The received product consisted of a batter-fried patty/piece of paneer (cottage cheese), sliced cucumber and tomato sandwiched between a butter-grilled bun with mayo & coriander chutney as spreads. Did taste decent but, sorry I had ordered it looking at the specimen which had lettuce and no cucumber. False portrayal of products is one of the biggest sins a food outlet can commit. Disappointed.
Kindly check attached pictures for a clearer picture.

- Crunchy Veg Vada Pav
yet another huge disappointment. The specimen picture and the received product just like the above, were poles apart. The specimen picture had two slices of cheese, a patty, slices of cucumber, tomato, onion and iceberg lettuce. But, the product wasn't anywhere near.
The received product consisted of a crisp-fried patty, slices of onion and tomato sandwiched between a bun and served. WHERE ON EARTH DID THE REMAINING FILLING VANISH?!  Did taste average but, sorry I had ordered it looking at the specimen which had way more layers!! Yet again, False portrayal of products is one of the biggest sins a food outlet can commit. Disappointed.
Kindly check attached pictures for a clearer picture.

- Masala Vada Pav
Crunchy patty sandwiched in a bun along with chili garlic powder and ketchup. Tasted nice.

• Prefer Green Chillies along? Pair the complimentary tempered Green Chillies with the Vada Pav of your choice.

• Recommendations (based on visit to other outlets): Shezwan Vada Pav, Makai Palak Vada Pav & Masala Vada Pav.
The service was prompt even after being crowded and the staff was found to be friendly.
Prices were found to be set at reasonable bases but, might feel a pinch in case the product on offer isn't the same as described.

•  DEAR MANAGEMENT, IF YOUR OUTLET CANNOT SERVE THE CUSTOMERS WHAT YOUR OUTLET PORTRAYS THEN KINDLY, EITHER CHANGE YOUR DISPLAY BOARD OR START SERVING WHAT'S DISPLAYED. STOP CHEATING CUSTOMERS.

Overall a highly disappointed and cheated experience.

Deductions due to the false portrayal of items.
- Yet to try the remaining fare, comments due.

This place is Situated in RDB boulevard building in sector v below RDB movie hall. There are lots of eating option out there. There are many restaurants in the area. 

It's a small kiosk but different varieties of Vada Pav and other snacks items available. You can take away also and you can have it there also. 

I like their classic Vada Pav. It's the basic but still I like that rather than eating varieties in others. Have tried other items also which are good. Cheese fingers are also good. 

Only thing I would like to complain to the management is that the boys serving out there are not interested in selling the classic vada Pav. This items is their starting range and of only Rs 25/- So half of the time they say it's finished or not in stock or will take time. This should not happen.

Despite the tarnishing ratings received by this joint i would like to add, that as this place is a 24 Hour Joint it should have better ratings. The vada pav's are well prepared and pretty evenly priced. I have visited this place a few times, and will do so again.

The vada pavs were good but could be better. Cheese ungli was pretty tasty. Can go out there for an evening snack one in a while. For ppl who like to experiment, they should go here.

Tatse of tha vada pav was ok or i must say below average
Lowest priced vada pav is of rs 25 but i found out its taste is similar to that of rs 30 masala vada pav.
So it depends , if you want to have vada pao then its the only option else if you are hungry then avoid it..

An Exclusive Vada Pao Outlet, located Just Outside the RDB Cinemas its a good place to have a bite and fill your tummy at a reasonable price, after you have watched a movie. I tried the Masala Pada Pav, It was Hot & Crunchy and Satisfying. Would like to try their other items too.

This is right on the corner of RDB Boulevard. I used to visit Star Vada Pav regularly when I was interning at an office nearby. The food is reasonably priced, filling and very very good to taste. Their Classic Veg Vada Pav and Crunchy Veg Vada Pav were my regular orders. Get the food butter grilled and you'll be in heaven. This place is really good if you want to grab a quick bite on the move and the move is pretty healthy too. I would also recommend their cheese unglis.

I had one of the worst experiences biting vadapav at star. They are really bad with the taste and the patty is always oily and stale. You will never get what they show in their menu and they are really 'Kanjoos' in adding mayonnaise. If you ask them to properly grill the vadapav, you need to pay them extra.

There are some things which look good or they perform better if you experience those in their originalities, likewise vada pav is an item which tastes best from the way it is sold generally, that is from street side stalls. Experimentation here equals to tinkering. Well, this store is located on my way to office and on 20th Mrch 15 I could not resist having this branded vada pav, the first thing that worked in my mind that it will definitely create a difference in the way vada pav is had. But the first bite on the Double Veg Crunchy V.Pav busted this hope and my note on these (all varities) pavs is something which I have already stated in the first line. Again, with a simple food, branding attached and this is one more way to make fool of others. Only one point which I liked is that the shop runs for 24 hrs but it has some breaks too, (8pm to 10 pm for this shop). Simply bland in taste and pricing is also Rs 60 for that faltu item. OHHHH!!!!!sauce is only after you shell another Rs 15. Just think.....

Not great for the taste, its good. Hygienic take away joint and open for 24 hours. It serves the purpose to cater to the sudden night hunger.

If you've been to mumbai and know the real deal, this would be a downer for you. For me it was. But judging it without comparisons makes it a good place to have cheap veg burgers, yea burgers, not vada paw.

Located just below to RDB cinemas beside barbeque nations. After watching a movie from RDB while walking towards the bus stop saw this mini vada pav outlet.
Tried their cheese vada pav. It was yummm! Will surely try their other items soon.
Price was reasonable according to their quantity and quality.
One suggestion.. They could have provide mini chairs or other seating arrangements in front of their outlet.

A typical joint for desi burgers; the place doesnt really dissappoint you. The eateries included a variety of vada pavs which were basically burgers, but with indian stuffings. The bread, though did not live up to the standards of even Monginis , werent as bad as one may anticipate. More or less justified for a one-time visit.

Had a chance to be at the sec v outlet yesterday with a friend. Ordered cheese ungli, unfortunately found that it did not have any cheese in it... not even in micro quantities. The menu stuck on the shop read "cheese extra charge". The staff was also very rude. I by mistake asked for cheese finger and he very rudely corrected me that the dish is called cheese ungli.
Overall unfortunate experience.

Its opened today at sector 5. the recipes are good, and the vadas taste like they've been freshly prepared. they do have a whiff of the bombay touch.

The classic jumbo vada pao is my recco here.

The prices are ridiculously cheap. So no worries on that account.

This is right next to RDB. Go grab a bite. Or better still indulge in a takeaway for a quick bite in between.
