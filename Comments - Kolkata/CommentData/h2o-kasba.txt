Not a fancy place but if u want to have quick round of drinks with ur friends or office colleagues u can come to this place...... The food is good if u order the right things like red pepper prawn or tandoori chicken.... Service is good with nice staff.... However given the ambience i think drinks are bit expensive.....

This place is located near to Siemens bus stoppage kasba. Its a pocket friendly restaurant cum bar having both smoking and non-smoking zones on its 1st floor. If you are ready for a quick drink with a small budget in hand, then this is the place. Food quality is upto the mark and mainly a hub for office goers.

This place is one of my most common hangout spots with my college friends as its nearby.Beer is available at a pocket friendly price...Some hard drinks are quite cheap as well...They provide unlimited nice tasty Chanachur as well as Onion and ginger slices with drinks here...So ur Chakna is sorted there..;)
Smoking is also allowed inside...u can just ask for the ashtray n u're good to smoke it off...Free Wifi is also available...:)
Now coming to food...3 chicken dishes are a must try for foodies..Barbeque Chicken...Chicken Lat Ma Kai...nd Chicken Pepper Salt...all of these are nearly of same price n comprises of 12 pieces of chicken..

Lat Ma Kai is crispy one...Barbeque chicken is the best for sure...Pepper Salt Chicken is also no less tasty man!!!

You can try their finger chips also...its great in quantity as well as taste... :)

They also serve good quality chowmein...
Ambiance definitely needs improvement..random tv channels are on all the time...They should work on that...Good music is required in a bar...Nd if tv is on atleast switch to good music channels nd not film or news channel or anything...

If you plan to visit this pub, just order their barbeque chicken and chicken paper salt. The best food item with beer. The beer is not so costly costs you 120rs per pint (tuborg green) also they give you 20% discount on all orders. A very good place for college peeps. The ambiance needs improvement.

Since it's very close to my place , thought of dining out here just like that. This is the place where I tried vodka for the first time with a friend ;)
Decor is very simple. But now have heard that they have remodelled the whole pub,so no idea about the present status :)
Food was yumm. We had ordered Tandoori which was soft..well grilled and very tasty.
Nothing extraordinary as a restaurant but one can drop in for casual occasions anytime :)

Unplanned visit. It's actually a very mediocre bar. Average decor, average lighting, 2-3 cheap-looking paintings, etc. Booze is relatively cheap. So are the items on the food menu. The noodles tasted good. The crispy chilli chicken was stiff. But it's a good enough place when you're only looking to have a drink and be on your way.

It's been quite sometime that I visited this place. It was a monsoon day and I was in a hurry to meet my girlfriend. But, sudden downpour changed our path and took me here.

The dim light and the glass pane make the ambience more than beautiful. I enjoyed every second out there. All drenched watching rain was indeed nice. We ordered two bottles of beer and chicken lollipop. Though the beer was fine as it had to be, I didn't like the lollipop much. It actually had more of cornflour which was making it bland. I didn't complain but it wasn't good. I'm rating it 3.00 for it's staff assistance, co-operation, ambience and beer. Don't know if at all I'll go back but memories are fresh in mind.

The visit was totally an unplanned one. We went there couple of months back. We were looking for a nice place to booze and there it was, right in front of our eyes. The ambiance is okayish. Booze is relatively cheap. The food is decent and was prepared well. Moreover we could smoke over there without having to take the trouble to go into a smoking room. The happy hours system over here is a bit different as it's not 1+1 but rather they give a 20% something discount over the bill. The waiters were decent. Overall a nice visit.

Not the best pub we've been in, and not the worse. Proper ambience, not too exuberantly priced, and good snacks to go with whatever you're having. They also allow you to smoke while at the table, which might be a plus point to few. The food is a bit on the pricey side, but their fish dishes are worth trying, speaking from a previous experience. Overall, it's pretty good if you're broke and want some good booze.

Located right after the Acropolis mall signal, this pub on first sight looks impressive. Cozy interiors, fairly spacious and a separate smoking and non smoking zone would make it appear like a top notch pub. 
Sadly, the reality is far from it. The food here is bad. The service isn't prompt and the staff are often indifferent. Add to it, this place is unnecessarily expensive. 
Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place to someone unless he or she is absolutely out if choice.

Today it was my 2 segregated visit at this place. Located just between Acropolis mall and Desun more, this place is a heaven for boozers specially if you drop in between 1pm to 6pm during the happy hours, u will get 20% off on everything. The interior was ok, staff behavior was good, service was "thik-thak", most important part is they allow smoking inside. Rates of food and drinks are fair enough. Food quality is nice, the reshmi kebab was seriously worth a mention!! Free wifi is available with descent speed. They don't have beer bottles instead they have only pints which costs around 130-170 rupees depending on the brand u choose.

First I had ordered for a kingfisher strong they told it was not chilled fine then I changed my order to have a budwiser but it was not available that was a bit disappointing because whatever I was ordering I ws not getting it finally ordered tuborg which I got finally.....and I order for some kabab.... Which was not tasty at all.... So my experience with h2o not good....

This was one of the best Restro Pubs on the Rasbehari Connector. But poor service, high prices, poor staff attitude & a limited Drinks menu is pulling it down.

Average place to hang out there - not recommended for couples as the noise level inside is just under ur tolerance level. Separate place for family - but during peak hours u have to sit at outside which is a smoking zone - people are openly smoking (not many good Bar cum Restaurants) allow that. Prices of drinks are relatively low (however u will get much better deals in so many places in South Kolkata). Food is average - But Chicken Kebabs are highly recommended (Tangri Kebabs are very good). Service is again a shit here - u have to repeat ur orders to 2-3 staffs before u get that - lack of professionalism.

H2O restaurant and pub is a hidden gem. Finding it may be difficult, but the food will make you want to keep coming back. From the variety to the pricing to the seating arrangement, everything is ideal. It will almost feel like you've struck gold. Until you realize that it isn't nearly as clean. If you don't mind dirt spots on your table, or stale food fallen on the ground, then this might be the ultimate eatery for you. For me, not yet.

My discovery of H2O was an accident by all means. It started with I, along with two of my friends looking for a place to drink. Somewhere near Ruby, we found a liquor shop and just as we were debating how to get a bottle without anyone noticing (being extra cautious:-p), I spotted this restaurant.  Relieved, we decided to give it a try.
Now the first thing which you notice after entering is the queer ambience. At 10 in the night, it looked like a dead place. We ordered naan, garlic chicken,chicken masala and started waiting. The food took some time to arrive but it was worth the wait. Though admittedly, the naan were the smallest I've ever seen. 
The real issue with this place is the price. The food was undoubtedly good but it felt a bit heavy for our pockets. The service was nice and the staff friendly.
If you are short on time and need a quick sip, this is one place you'd consider. Seriously. 
Enjoy!

Nice decent restaurant which is extremely conveniently located (in Kasba). 
The menu is simple and decent. Don't expect any experimental food here or any out-of-the-world cuisine. The simple Chicken clear soups and the Hakka noodles taste great here. The plus thing here is the street view. Right on Kasba, you can enjoy your cup of coffee while watching the traffic snarl by.

Unless you are walking on the road and you suddenly feel like having a quick drink(and the place is right next to you), do not go here!
Everything about the place screams ordinary at best.
Prices are pretty inflated for the location, service and ambiance.

Have had pretty bad experiences here including stuff like, the waiter drops a piece of chicken into my 100 piper peg while serving food, the non availability of a normal sizzler(instead the waiter suggested a Chinese sizzler which turned out to be manchurian chicken with salad on the sizzle base), not serving food for over an hour..etc etc..

Bottom line don't go here if you have any better options available.

This one being very close to my house, we used to eat here pretty often. It has a formal office look which i don't really like. Chinese food is satisfactory. I like their Schezwan fried rice and hot garlic chicken and chicken manchurian. The chicken tandoor isn't bad but having it elsewhere will be a better idea. People who come here mostly sit with a beer. the alcoholic section is separate and is comparatively more crowded. Over all service is ok.

The plan to visit this place was an on spot decision and  it was already 10:30 by the time we entered. It had two sections. One allowed smoking and the other was a non-smoking one. We chose the non-smoking zone.We ordered booze and jeera rice and chicken kolapuri. The dishes were okayish. The quantity was good. The behaviour of the staff was not great as they kept asking us to hurry up. Telling us once was good enough. Our bill came to 1200 which consisted of two tuborgs,90 ml of signature whiskey,two Pepsi bottles and the above mentioned main course. Altogether this place wasn't a pleasant experience.

Well actually we were looking for a place to have a drink, and our search started from ruby hospital. This was the first place that we noticed and so we decided to hit this place.
Service is a bit slow, nothing worth to be mentioned about the food, but the ambience is not really good. Even the bar was empty. Would be giod uf u are looking for a quuet and empty place. Even there is no music playing.

However out of all the experiences I don't want to go blah blah... However I would bring into the notice of management that please keep all the items that is mentioned in the menu card. It has happened many items  previously that items mentioned in the menu card are not present. At the same time the waiters are not at all customer friendly; please ensure that they are been trained properly... They need to treat every customer in a generous manner.

Food was average and poorer service. Haughty restaurant managers and a don't care attitude. We bought a deal from Groupon  and we thought of having a great dinner at this restaurant. Deal was great and very eye catching. They offered a lot in very small amount for two persons. So we bought it and went to this restaurant last night. 
We were greeted well and shown to our table. But experience started poorly when we showed our deal papers. 20 minutes later we were still waiting for someone to take our drinks & food order despite there being 3/4 staffs stood about together chatting. We had to ask for service. Then starters came fast but our main courses was extremely late despite the restaurant not being very busy at that time. By late, I mean it took another twenty minutes for us to get our foods, with no water or beverages beforehand and food quantity was very little, not enough for two persons. Naturally, this annoyed the heck out of us, because we witnessed staff sitting around, and not being productive at all. We ultimately decided not to tip, because the service we got was poor in one of the few areas where I anticipated quality, but the issue probably wasn't really the waiters fault, seeing as the kitchen was probably responsible for the late.

I will pretty much stop buying from these daily deal sites. My suggestion to the restaurant manager that If you cannot afford to serve your promised deal then please don't post at the site. Stop making people fool and finally make a good conduct towards the people.

visited the place with one of my friend a few months ago..ambience was kind of ok.. prices of drinks are sky high.we had tandoori chicken and crispy honey chicken which was really nice...
overall not a good place for drinks..

The ambience was not so good,definitely not a bar type although it is a bar cum restaurant.the staff were not upto the mark, they didnot have many things on menu.the chicken starter we ordered was full of garlic.and the prices were a little high. overall experience was not so good.

This is first time to be any restro pub in Bypass connector. I along with two friends turn up at this place as unplanned to hook before head to home. It is all on average experience. Chinese food are decent and not much experimented..
Taste- 3
Ambience- 3
Service- 3+ ( might because of evening and less customer)
Value for money- 3 max..TM

A  very  expensive restaurant considering it's  remote location  ..........drinks are very very expensive i mean  very  expensive  ....  food is  also expensive  overall  a  thumbs down from me .................if  at all you want to go then  atleast don't  drink over  there  ....  try chinese  over there atleast it is  digestable ...  also  be  wary  of  what  you  order.  i  ordered  gravy  chowmein  &  they  brought hakka  ....really  pissed  me  off

Visited few days ago with my friends to booz and dinner. The ambiance is decent you can have family dinner together.

If you are planning to visit here must try "Fish Punjabi" and "Shredded chili chicken", quantity is not that enough but quality of "Fish punjabi" was too good to express. 

Overall other dishes were average. The service is okiesh type but this bar cum restaurant is little expensive to fit anybody's pocket.
