I've noticed a dramatic decline in terms of quality & taste.. We ordered mutton biriyani & the mutton pieces were like joke. They're nothing but merely bones with minimal layers of flesh, something you'd never expect in a biriyani. Very disappointed as we had guests. Not ordering again.

Very poor quality of food. Ambience is pretty old fashioned. Staff are well behaved. The place needs serious makeover. Waiting time is very high in serving food.

This is not at Garia. This place is located exactly in the middle of Kamalgazi and Narendrapur Mandir Gate. This one is a overpriced mediocre food joint. Nothing special. Not even pocket friendly. Surely you can miss this one and go to Zaika or somewhere else.

খাবারের গুণমান মোটের ওপর খারাপ না। তবে দাম টা একটু বেশি। পরিমাণ টা ঠিক ঠাকই দেয়। ভেতরের পরিবেশ টা খুব একটা খারাপ না, spacious। তবে এক্ষেত্রেও সব খাবার সব দিন পাওয়া যায়না। যাওয়া যেতে পারে।

Nice and affordable if you're running out of money and don't want to sit out in the sun or with mosquitos on road, having your food. Tasty food, place could've been better.

The food isn't bad here. But Overpriced given the location. The alu bhaja and the Mung Dal deserve special mention. The portions served are good as well.

This is very near my place so have been there 2-3 times. Some food items are really good. Cost is reasonable. If you are lucky you will get real good food otherwise at times it might be a disappointment!

Went to this place as the outer appearance of this place appealed to me. But the place is drastic on the inside. We had ordered mixed fried rice, chicken chowmein and chilli chicken. The quality of the food is bad. No flavours. No salt. The chicken pieces were really small and did not taste that good but it was the best one of the lot that they served us. This place really needs improvement.

The decor at this place is interesting, but otherwise everything is pretty average. Nothing in their menu will stand out. I don't know why I went there and had chicken biriyani all of a sudden. I can recommend this place to the ones who are horror buffs. The restro is almost always empty and if you go alone after 7pm, it's kinda spooky. Especially the upstairs seating space.

visited this joint a week ago late in the afternoon...had rotis(chapatis), as tandoori roti was not available and chicken bharta packed for lunch..quality was okayish but bharta had small pieces of bone which was very annoying...price is bit high considering the location and the presentation..overall not dissatisfied

The food is too tasty.
I ordered over phone and asked for home delivery. And I received the food within 30 minutes. 
The pricing is also fair enough.
Didn't pinched my pocket.

I had to visit Narendrapur to have my dropped (LG) phone repaired and got hungry after a wait. Job done, I found that there was a restaurant close by (almost opposite Mission Gate). Entered the unit and walked up the stairs to find a large room which had attempts to be done up like a jungle. There were plaster casts of tree trunks on the walls with weird looking leaves and the chairs had a bamboo feel to them. All in all a bit shoddy.

Was attended to imemdiately. I asked for Thums Up but they were out of stock, so had to settle for Coke poured out from a large bottle. I also ordered a fish fry (Rs 120), Half Chicken Do-piaza (Rs 85) and three Chapatis (no tandoori rotis as the tandoor operates only in the evening).

The fish fry were two reasonably large and almost fluffed up pieces. Not too great, more of spice and thick crust. They had poured chaat masala over it which I had to brush off. They served it with a nice salad, onion, cucumber and tomato copped with lime water.

The chicken came later along with the rotis. The rotis were fairly large and decent. The chicken gravy was spicy and of the two pieces served, none were breast pieces (one small leg an done from the thigh). I was annoyed since I had specifically asked for *sina* piece. I did not particularly enjoy the food, though I must say the price was very reasonable.

A place one visits in a cinch.

This restaurant is located in between kamalgazi more and mandir gate stoppage. I tried the soups here. Crispy chixken was good. The dining space is in the first floor and the interior design is fair enough. But some dishes are highly priced and not worth it. Overall the experience was moderate

This is a moderate restaurant with some of the dishes a bit overpriced. The quality and taste of the food are also not that much good. It will not be a good idea to visit this place twice.

Have been there three-four times with family. It feels a bit lonely there with not many customers. Menu is good, but don't feel surprised if you are told that the dish is not available today. Food is a bit spicy. Overall,not too bad. An occasional outing, maybe!

It is one of the oldest retro in Narendrapur area having a  near about 10-12 year experience. Location , interior , staffs are good .
Now the main points 1. Food quality 2. Quantity in respect of money. For both the points  I can only say about the Chinese only and in this case I think most resturants are going back just to serve all world dishes which makes them na Gharka Na Ghatka and clay oven is in this situation now. Their Chinese dishes are average respect to others nothing will make you to visit again but it is ea table. Main problem for me is its quantity I request them just to think them twice.

The quality of food is good at reasonable price..... though the rates are revised. But for dine in they took so much time to serve the food.... so take a healthy time to come here for dine in. They should improve their serving standard and their interior ambience.

Nice food, value for money, clean interior, fast home delivery, both Chinese and Indian dishes are tasty, however my preferred would be their biriyani. However the price mentioned here has changed during puja but still very much a budget hotel I would say.
