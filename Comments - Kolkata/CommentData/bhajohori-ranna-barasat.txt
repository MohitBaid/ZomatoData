We have ordered Garlic Chicken and Tandoori Roti. We received that order approximately in one hour. Chicken was well cooked , but it wasn't that much spicy what we expected to get. It was sweet, more than we need it. I hope that next time we'll get the dishes properly in delivery.

Located on your left as you travel from airport towards madhyamgram (just before the left turn for nivedita setu) ... Often a wait period is there due to the fact that it happens to be one of the better roadside restaurants in the area in this price frame... But quality wise food is worse than street food... No value for money... Just satisfaction at the ambience and service... The last place one would eat (if interested to have standard food)

I have not visited this restaurant for a long time but earlier I used to visit it quite often because it is near to my place, pocket friendly and of course tasty. The moghlai dishes like reshmi butter masala, tandoori butter masala, biriyani and others will taste really heaven those who love having spicy food, and the best part is, though spicy, none of them are too hot to ruin your pallet. The Chinese dishes are delicious too and Sizzlers have an Indian blend. Some other out of flavour dishes I've tried is Lemon Chicken and Palak Chicken. Lemon chicken is nothing special but Palak Chicken is good and can be tried both with rice and chapati. However, on festive days, the quality of the food really goes down, and it is better not to visit it on such days.

Good experience with Bhajohori Ranna with a couple of take-aways and dine-in. Loved their "Prawn Malaikari" and that's definitely a recommendation. The prawns were cooked very tender and the curry was well made. The "yellow" pulao was brilliantly served and quantity was ample with generous proportions of cashews. We had struggled to finish them :) this place is quite a favorite as there's quite a crowd I see every time. Being on the Jessore road, it's a convenient option for people traveling towards Barasat or airport.

Well to start with I only visited this place because its close to where I live and for sudden late night cravings. This place features in a variety of traditional bengali dishes which does make the menu look mouth watering. But it failed to keep up with the expectation. The quality was only okay and the prices weren't reasonable either. Not worth it!

Bhajohari Ranna - An excellent restaurant to satiate your tastebuds at pocket friendly price.
=====
Location + Introduction:

I was returning back from the airport. My friend who had been here took me. So i won't be able to tell you the exact location but it is located somewhere in barasat area. 

Bhajohari Ranna is quite a hidden gem. We sat on the first floor and the decor was quite simple. It was not very very fancy but yeah, i liked it the way it was. There was some mask showpieces added to the ambiance to give it the look and it was all decorated even the ceilings. Despite being so nicely made, the prices which they charge is quite pocket friendly. 
=====
What i ordered:

• Onion Salad - Onion cut in the form of onion rings with some sprinkled masala on top. Served with kacha lonka (green chilly) and lebu. (lemon). 

• Egg Tadka Daal - Believe me or not, one of the best egg tadka's i had. The food served was piping hot and tasted excellent. #bliss 

• Aloo Posto - As i went with a bengali friend, he insisted on ordering me this. I loved on this one too.  It was light. It was satiating. It was perfect the way it was. #musttry

• Roomali Roti - It was fine. Went hand in hand with the above mentioned food items. 
=====
Pros:

• Staff is courteous.

• Ambiance is nice. 

• Pocket friendly. 

• Spacious.

• Service is fast. 

• Good quality of food. 
=====
Meal for two: 250-500 approximate (Prices are subject to change due to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, etc)
=====
Summary:

Food Quality 4/5

Food Quantity 4.1/5

Taste 4.2/5

Presentation 3.8/5

Hospitality 4.1/5

Ambiance 3.8/5

Hygiene 3.8/5

VFM 4/5
=====
Conclusion:

I had a great time here and might as well come back again in the near future sometime. Lovely place serving lipsmacking food at pocket friendly price. I did not feel bloated after the food which i usually feel even after dining it at some of the posh restaurants. This was light and blissful to the palate as well as satiated my stomach. 
=====
Unbiased review based on my eating experience.
                    

Month of August 2017

Recently went there with the same friend. This time thought to try Chinese Food. So we went on trying Sweet Corn Chicken Soup, Valcon Chicken (mild spicy chicken with sunny side egg) and Chicken Hakka Chowmien. All were good. Served impeccably and is quite reasonably priced too.

Wasn't aware of this place until one day I visited a friend's place in Birati n decided to order food for lunch. The delivery didn't take too long. We ordered chicken bharta, mixed fried rice and naan. The best chicken bharta I tasted so far. Loaded with flavours n shredded chicken and the quantity was enough for two with large portions for each. The fried rice was loaded with chicken n prawn n had a good flavour to it. Loved the lunch that day. Would definitely order or visit the place and try out other dishes too. The chicken bharta would be a sure winner and a must try for anyone visiting here.

A perfect place for enjoying having lunch or dinner in Bengali Cuisine... 💕💕 
I came to know by my friends so i wanted to visit it. I visited it on my Beloved's 25th Bday. 
The restaurant has 3floors ..  we went on the 1st floor. The staffs were good n courteous. I got the window side seat ..... Having lunch here was not a bad option i felt when i saw the ambience. 
We ordered for totally Bengali type foods ...  Rice, Dal, Aloo Bhaja, Katla Kalia , Chicken, Mutton. 
They served in a very perfect way all the dishes ... representation was even praise worthy. 

Foods were all well cooked, homely type, damn tasty. Chicken n mutton were even cooked in a proper way.... we even took tandoori chicken as parcal. 

We were delighted to have such a tasty food as our lunch...  Rates are even reasonable... !

Hope to visit soon.. coz still can't forget the mouthwatering food they cooked n served 😍😁

Bro n sis n law went there yesterday with their 40 days old puppy. Nobody did resist them including security guard and waiters. But, after serving food the security guard stormed in and asked to leave the puppy outside or to leave. When they were leaving nobody told them anything but asked to pay the bill for food whatever they had since then. But they didn't. It would be really justified if they resist at the beginning or at least the waiter when they were going to place the order. After that chasing with the invoice no: 135 was disgrace. They went to eat and pay what they have served but not for inhospitality and mismanagement... Disgusted...

Visited this place more than a year ago, average food & service..but I am writing this review with deep disappointment because I came to know an incident from a person known to me. He & his family went to this foo joint few days back to have their lunch with their 40 days old puppy . Security did not resist them to go inside, even no objection came while having seats, but during the moment of food serving they were asked to leave the puppy outside...after argument that person with his family left the restaurant without having the food, because it was an inhuman behavior towards a pet especially when it was a kid, was on the lap & was not disturbing anyone. If they have any objection in it, they should have hanged a board written "Pets are not allowed". The service mismatch between the security & waiter proves an imbalance in hospitality. Felt very bad about it.

This restaurant was since long in my wish list. Finally got to try this place. I have seen many people confusing this with the other famous restaurant which has the almost similar name but it s a quite different entity. It's a multi cuisine restaurant which serves Bengali, Chinese and north Indian food. Tried both Chinese and Bengali food here. The food was fresh and tasty and quite pocket friendly.

Have been here quite a number of times and the food is quite good. But their prices are indeed quite high. In fact in order to pay such high prices one can expect the food to be of a great taste. However unfortunately the place falls short of this.
On my last visit i tried their mustard prawn preparation and mutton curry.
The mutton was cooked propeely with exact tenderness needed.
The prawn preparation can be improved since it lacked proper spices.
An average food joint to settle for.

I have been here more than 5 times. Most of the time with my family because my father loves this restaurant a lot. The food here is delicious and so desi. You get typical Bengali dish over here. Once, one of my dad's friend who stays in Australia came to visit us. He's a Bengali and wanted to have the perfect Bengali cuisine. Dad decided to take us over here. We had Dab Chingri (coconut prawn), sorshe ilish (hilsa fish) and the other typical Bengali dishes. It was fabulous. That guy just loved the food.

The restaurant is on the main road, so it's easy to find too. Great place for a perfect time with family.

You must definitely try their chicken reshmi kabab ( one of the bests). I too love their mutton biriyani. If you are near the airport and want a place to dine at you should definitely visit this place.. the amazing food just makes up for everything else.

Unfortunately there is no rating below 1... The food quality has gone down significantly... Most of the dishes are not available... And on top of everything the portion is just pathetic.... Ordered mutton ressala got three small pieces of mutton, i have tried the same dish here two years ago it. Whats wrong with bhojohori manna, is it the whole chain serving this or just this outlet???? The photo of mutton ressala is attached to make you understand.

Bangaliaana at its best. Though there are thousand times better restaurants than this but when you are too hungry, you enjoy whatever they provide. Bhajohori Ranna should be visited often and try out their new dishes. Daab Chingri is famous and I absolutely loved it. Moreover Lau er Paatay Chingri is also beautiful and mouth watering.

Not that good. Food quality is not that good as compatre to other premium restaurants or Bhajohori Manna also. Decoration and all other aspects are okey but the main thing is always food when we are entering in a restaurant. 
Staff are not behave like professionals, very casual and not helpful at all.

I've been to this place quite a no of times enroute to my aunt's place, with family. The decor and the ambience might not scream anything out too loud but don't be fooled by that. Their chinese is just amazing! Their hakka noodles is one of my favorites. The most amazing thing about them is the enormous quantity which they provide at a reasonable price. Overall, okay for a quick bite.

I am giving 3.5 only for the quality of food which is quite good given the suburban location it is situated in where there are no other proper eateries.The restaurant is 10years old and is quite big-three storied and sincere attempt to decorate it has been made which is visible from the expensive tiles fitting and wall motifs but it lacks taste and the washbasin reveals it's true character-an improvised roadside dhaba!The Bengali dishes are average,Biriyani ok,Chinese is good,Indian better.Tandoori items are satisfactory.All the dishes are a bit overpriced.It seems business is good for this one as there are no competitors nearby.

The restaurant is very close to our new home, ordered twice and they delivered it much earlier than the given time, which was not an issue. I can remember to have the food inside restaurant long ago may be in 2010. This is the only restaurant I've been where you can see Chinese preparation with Mutton, though they taste some wired. 

Food quality if I say is above average and quantity wise is also good. But the pain point is their price. For an average to good road side restaurant it is much on the higher side. e.g. A plate of chicken noodles will cost you 180 bucks, fish gravy preparation 260 and chicken dish @210. Once ordered their Bengali dishes, that cost us 120 for a fish curry plate with one piece of Katla fish. And Hilsa fish curry plate or Hilsa fry with one piece Hilsa is 500 bucks. 

I won't go to order again unless there is a situation when I see nothing better I get with lesser price.

Good food at a reasonable price!
My favorite here is tandoori roti, chicken reshmi kebab and chicken bharta.
Reshmi kebab is amazingly soft and I find them the best in Kolkata.
I always prefer home delivery however I once went there to dine and was not impressed by the decor. 
I wish they could have given a better name to this place rather than almost copying a famous restaurant.

Remember visiting this restaurant with my husband and his friends all of a sudden. We were actually planning for a long drive when we came across Bhojohori Ranna at jessore Road. The bright signage with the name on it caught our attention and initially we all thought it to be an error in typing and printing. On stopping our car and asking the security guard we understood that there's no error. The restaurant has been purposely named Bhojohori Ranna. The clever approach to naming a restaurant was the first thing to impress me.  Being foodies we all entered the restaurant to try out the food before starting our long drive. 
The interior is descent enough and the decor was average. We ordered for Begun Bhagat,  Alu Posts,  Moong daal,  Pabda fish,  chingri malaicurry and Kosha Mangsho. The items were served with hot steamed rice. The begun bhaja tasted heavenly along with the Moong daal. The green peas and cauliflower in the daal further enhanced it's taste. We being hungry after a long day at work and then being bengalis thoroughly enjoyed the start.  
The best was yet to come... And we were served the Pabda curry and the prawn malaicurry. Both the items were delicious and made us order another plate of rice. Out tummies were full but not our hearts... The mutton Kosha was luring us with its red colour and aroma. I must say the meat item was equally delicious and had the typical bengali flavour to it. I do not remember when was the last time I hogged so much.  The taste and quality of all the items were phenomenal. 
The service was quick and efficient. The pricing of the products were also quite reasonable. The best part was we were satisfied and full after eating here. The menu has a wide variety of fish and meat items along with vegetarian dishes.

Have been a frequent visitor there.. Visiting is due to have official lunch in that area since they accept credit card and budget food.
1. Recently they have started saying that credit card machine is not working even if the bill amount is more than 300.
This is a lame trick that they try to play on customer to receive cash.
2. The first floor 2 seater table has sharp edges, my finger was cut before i could try with the food.. when visited downstairs to the manager.. in a smiling face the manager said that it must be the table that have hurt me and then handed over a bandade.
3. Yesterday i have seen the manager to be arguing with a customer on the agenda that the customer wanted a justification of charging the soft drink bottles as 40inr while those are available in 15inr. Literally they were chargine more that double.
The manager is not well behaved and seems to be rude with customer and the staffs.
4. Food is good as far as bengali cusine is tried, though oil is used too much. Rumali roti is very small and the tandoor is always lated during lunch.
Chinees items are disaster as all chicken balls are the same but only dipped in different sauces.
5. They provide handwritten bills and that does not look genimuine at all.
In short they need to work in all department so as to be customer friendly.

Many people confuse this with the Barasat outlet of Bhojohori Manna but it's not part of that chain.It's a standalone resturant.Have been here many times with my family and tried almost all the dishes.They are simply WOW.The Bengali food served tastes like home but still has a different feel to it.The kebabs and other starters are simply mouthwatering.They also have done a decent job with the North Indian cuisine here.The only minus point is that the place is almost crowded most of the time and you have to wait quite a while in the queue till your turn comes.Otherwise this place is perfect for quiet family hangout.

Been there quite a few times,and ordered for home delivery even more frequently. Since the place is pretty much in my locality itself, the home delivery is usually as prompt as you would want it to be, even on bad weather nights. 

The Chinese and North Indian items served here are unquestionably tasty. Typical Bengali dishes can be counted as the main strength of this place. Beautifully prepared fish and all. But many would agree that they have had better prawn malaikari elsewhere. 

Overall,a must visit restaurant..one wouldn't go home disappointed. The restaurant is however near birati..nowhere near barasat..

This is your quaint "para" restaurant serving just the kind of food that you need when you feel too lazy to venture elsewhere.
Ambiance wise not that great. Split into three separate floors and all of dark and dingy ( as if they wanted to make the lighting romantic but it got horribly wrong).
Now coming to the food..Although it has a typical bengali name to it and serves Bengali food also, their forte is  actually Chinese and North Indian. 
The biryani here is good and so are the kebabs (Sp: Chicken Tikka Kebab).
The Chinese basics such as Fried rice, Szechwan, Hot Garlic, Manchurian et al are pretty good (dont expect Tangra quality here though).Also try their snacks..they make the most amazing fish fingers here!!

Located towards Birati from the Airport on Jessore Road,this place looked quite promising and delicious at the beginning. Quality was somehow compromised down the lane.
Anyway,food is still good. Go for the Bong Cuisine since they don't always get the Chinese tastes right.  Cheetol Maachh er muittha and momos are always flawless. This place is still pulling crowd for their calm,ordinary,homely,demeanor.

What I liked the most about Bhajohori Ranna is the overall satisfaction. Ranging from the quality to the quantity for price seems pretty fair to me. I always prefer to take home delivery rather that dine in here because its location is very suitable for the daily-passengers of Barasat, Madhyamgram etc to hope in and take the delivery on their way home. They have order-on-call system and will keep your delivery ready when you reach the restaurant. So when you or you family wanna dinner with quality restaurant food but don't wanna go to the restaurant then I think choosing this restaurant is a good option for North suburban people.

OK, this place is at a 5-minute-walk away from my apartment, and, I admit, it's a fairly trustworthy restaurant in terms of quality of food, pricing, (and home-delivery in my case)... 

For the ratings, I'd give it a 6/10 for the ambiance, an 8/10 for the food, and a 7/10 for the pricing... Quite good for comparison with any restaurant in proper city limits...

Dishes worth mention: I am yet to find a restaurant that serves better Chicken Bharta than this joint; it always takes a place in my order... The Biryani's good too... But as it is essentially a Bengali restaurant, I'd recommend ordering the Bhapa Eelish(Steamed Hilsa) or Daab Chingri(Prawns cooked in Coconut Milk and served in one) with a plate of plain steamed rice... I'd not recommend any desserts, as none of them are up to the mark, hence the low rating...

Decent food for the price you pay. Nothing extravagant. Nice place to be there with the family. Knock off of Bhajohori Manna. But still Ok to shell out your money.

What I liked the most about Bhajohori Ranna is the overall satisfaction. Ranging from the quality to the quantity for price seems pretty fair to me. I always prefer to take home delivery rather that dine in here because its location is very suitable for the daily-passengers of Barasat, Madhyamgram etc to hope in and take the delivery on their way home. They have order-on-call system and will keep your delivery ready when you reach the restaurant. So when you or you family wanna dinner with quality restaurant food but don't wanna go to the restaurant then I think choosing this restaurant is a good option for North suburban people.

Location and the price being one of the best thing about this place.. The quality of food is good but in no way excellent. If you are claustrophobic then is better to avoid this place bcz it's very conjusted inside Sply in the 1st floor dinning area.
Said that it's a good place to pay a vist if you are looking for a budget place to enjoy time with friends and family.. :)

OK, this place is at a 5-minute-walk away from my apartment, and, I admit, it's a fairly trustworthy restaurant in terms of quality of food, pricing, (and home-delivery in my case)... 

For the ratings, I'd give it a 6/10 for the ambiance, an 8/10 for the food, and a 7/10 for the pricing... Quite good for comparison with any restaurant in proper city limits...

Dishes worth mention: I am yet to find a restaurant that serves better Chicken Bharta than this joint; it always takes a place in my order... The Biryani's good too...

The main thing which I liked about Bhojohori Ranna is their ambience.Besides the food also seemed to me very good given the price tag(justifiable).All together this eatery is the perfect place for a family or friends hangout on weekends without straining the pocket too much and also having great food and a nice environment.The only let down which seemed to me is the location which is a bit out of the main town.But nevertheless THUMBS UP
P.S-Try their Butter Chicken Masala.It's my favourite and I bet everybody would like it too.Killer combo if takend with their Butter Tandoori Roti.Yummy!!!!!!

As this place is one of the closest from my place so have been here for many a times. Loves the small but beatifuly decoré interior and silent, dim ambience of the place. To say list about the food they have taste of their own and are good indeed. Specially the bengali cuisines. Few friends who did not know about this place have actually praised me for taking them to this place. ????

Went there on my b'day with my family, This place is centrally located, Ambiance is kinda fine. Nothing much of a decor, good seating arrangement. The chicken curry is fine, good quantity. Mixed fried rice was not that good, Frozen prawns were used, not much of a good taste. The Chinese part was good.  Waiters are rude sometimes. Nothing special about this place. Average experience.

When they started we had been a regular customer for them. But over the years I am sorry to say, their food quality has deteriorated and so have their service for home delivery. Last few times we revived food late and cold. Not sure if their cook has changed as I can see some deviation in quality of food too.

Lets start with the gatekeeper who is very well behaved and courteous as is also the other staff.
It is always a bit crowded considering its a hit with the locals.i dont know why people throng it so much nd i often see people waiting even though space is not a problem considering its three storied.
Mentionworthy items are all their chinese items,shorshe ilish,daab chingri,navratna pulao..
But i woudnt say so about their chingri macher malai curry coz it was way deviated from the original recipe without a good outcome.
The prices are very competetive..
Overall it is a good ,reasonably priced eatery to visit with friends and family if you are in the area..

First of all there was too hot inside the restuarant! May be one ac was not working. . Interior and environment was poor.. Ordered baby corn fried chicken, tandoori chicken, chicken kasha, laccha paratha... baby corn fried chicken was too much spicy with excessive spices and minimum chicken , laccha paratha was partially burnt, chicke kasha was ok kind of.. and tandoori chicken was also not that good.. but the thing is we couldn't finish all tandoori chicken..( we had only 2 pieces of it there were 4 pieces left )so we ask the waiter if we can take it parcel or not.he agreed with us and gave it.. after coming home there was only 2 pieces! Wtf is this!!! 

THEY ALSO DON'T PROVIDE ANY ONLINE ORDERING SERVICE! !

Its been more than 3 year since my last visit,i almost forgot about this place but i now i found it so heres my review

--LOCATION--
Drive through Jessore Road towards Birati n this olace can be found on the left hand side.. Will take around 5-10mins on Car from Airport 1no

--AMBIENCE--
Ambience is really good, they separate tables for families n couples n its a bit dark so visiting this place at night with your loved ones can be a sweet deal. They also have couple seats beside windows which gives a clear view outside also
Music is the only thing which this place lacks

--QUALITY N QUANTITY--
Quality was really good,as it was like 3years ago i forgot what we ordered but the chicken which we had for starters was really good, 1bowl of Biryani would be enough for 2
n the quality was top notch

--PRICING--
Pricing is like those any other medium ranged restaurants. 
Would cost around 600 for a quality dinner

--BEHAVIOR OF STAFF--
Well behaved staffs n no complaints
But they should really work on the washroom, it was small n had a foul smell which would seem unhygienic to almost everyone

So in conclusion
PROS
Good Food
Good ambience
Moderate Pricing
Good quality n Quantity

CONS
BAD n Unhygienic Washroom

Really waiting for another visit..

I have been there a number of times. I have been there during festive season i.e, during the pujas. I have been there for lunch, for birthday bashes, for dinner and even for supper at 4 pm. Its just a 5 minute ride from my house. I have even ordered home delivery.

I have tried a lot of things and lets not name every single one of them. I should only name the ones I would recommend. I just realized that I haven't tried the bengali delicacies they boast off. Maybe because I think my mom is the best cook when it boils down to those dishes.

Its not "Bhajahari Manna" but its "Bhajahari Ranna" !!

**Location -> It is located on Jessore Road, near Birati, close to NSCB(Dumdum) Airport.

**Brief -> Have tried both their takeaway and the sit-and-have arrangements. They prepare superb bengali dishes. But this time we ordered HD(home delivery) at my elder brother's birthday.

**Ambience -> The ambience is nice and its fillled with crowd during the holidays and in the weekends.The servers are nice and they suggest good bengali dishes.

**Things ordered -> We ordered Crispy Chilly baby corn,Chicken Fried Rices,Chicken Bhartas and Butter chicken.
We were at MichealNagar, so they said it would take 30 minutes for the delivery and it was exactly within 30 minutes they delivered.In this scorching heat its really a job well done !!

Crispy chilly baby corn was crisp and was really chilly :P It had plenty of veggies and was a good choice for starters.
Then we had the chicken rices with bharta and the butter chicken. The rice was of good quantity and had quite a lot of chicken :) The bharta was best of the lot, it was prepared in a Shahi style with kajus(cashew) and Kishmish(raisins). I just loved this item and craved for more. The butter chicken was also pretty well prepared :)

**Overall -> We had great experience having the food and the service was as usual fast. But I felt the chicken bharta's quantity was not upto the mark, as we ordered 3 plates but couldn't satisfy 5 of us.

** Purse Check -> Pretty pocket friendly they also provide quality home delivery :)

Recommended!!

I have always been ordering home delivery from this restaurant, never visited this place. The food is awesome... Except the biriyani. The Bengali cuisines are a must haves, also their kababs and other dishes. They are specialised in Bengali and other Indian and Chinese dishes but the chowmein is little bit above average and also their chopsuey in average. Other than that every food out here is delicious.
