This place is close to my college. During my college days I used to visit the place for small hangout. This place genuinely support your pocket. The best dish of this place is reshmi kebab and chicken roll. The cherry on the top is no added tax. ðŸ˜Š

Located near my house so its a quite a simple resturant with no attractive ambience. Service is ok but if its about cleanness its 0% ..
Food is average..biryani too oily nd sometyms the potatos are rotten..faced this 2 times extremely disappointed..kababs are not that juicy and the green chatni is disappointing..
Its just a good place for having rolls..thats it ! Pocket friendly..

It is a good reataurant which provides you good taste within affordable price range. The most important is there very few restaurant like it where you can get good quality and sufficient quantity and you do not need to have a high budget than many other restaurant...

The ambience is not upto the mark but the food is quite good

The roll counter serves a good menu for many delicate variations of a teen's delight

The service is average but sometimes the waiter doesn't respond properly

The main courses are average

This place is for those quick bites when you are low on your pocket but u want a good and average meal

Will give pics next time i visit this place

Meridian Inn is located at Khidderpore .

Ambience is ok with sitting arrangements.

Staffs were cooperative and service was fast.

Ordered Butter naan , chicken reshmi butter masala and malai Kofta. Butter naan was soft and well made. Chicken item was tasty and well cooked. Malai Kofta was very delicious and soft.

Pocket pinch is reasonable.

Overall a satisfactory experience.

Meridian Inn is located close to Khideerpore more. It is a small joint with roll counter outside and dining Air conditioned area inside.
The place is not very spacious. Presentation not so bad .Simple restaurant. Good customer service and absolutely value for money .This restaurant doesn't have home delivery option. Lots of option available from the menu in affordable price ! But lots of area they should consider to cope with from consumer point of view these days.

A nice Food Joint in Kidderpore.
Prepares excellent rolls.
The kebabs are also soft and juicy
However it's not a place where you can go with your family as it is too small.
They used to make Good biriyanis as well , however the quality has fallen over the time .

Located very near to my college meridian serves decent indian food. Haven't tasted their Chinese ever. On my last visit ordered chicken biryani butter naan lacha paratha chicken Reshmi butter masala paneer butter masala kadhai chicken and coke.
Biryani was tasty and light. 
Paratha n naan were good.
Reshmi butter masala had too much flavour of coriander leaves though kebab in it was tasty n tender. 
Paneer butter masala gravy was tasty. 
Kadhai chicken was very disappointing. It didn't taste good.
Overall a pocket friendly restaurant.(total bill was around â‚¹750)

This restaurant doesn't charge VAT for its food. We'd ordered the chicken reshmi kabab, chicken biryani, mutton biryani,  mutton special biryani with extra piece of mutton and egg, mutton rezala, mutton stew with tandoori roti, and cold drinks. Food quality and taste are good. Good food in affodable prices are the USP of this eatery offering North Indian, Chinese and street food.

Been to this place many times. Had chicken roll, mixed gravy noodles, chilly chicken, mixed fried rice, kadhai chicken, lachcha parantha and tandoori chicken. Food is delicious and quantity is good. Price is reasonable. Service is good. Loved it when they served us fried rice and kadhai chicken at 3 am during pujas when all other restaurants were closed. They said it was the only thing left. Salute to their humanity as they saved us from hunger. We were starving ! The ambience is nice and well-decorated. One should give this place a try.

We went there unplanned during the durga puja time. Location is great easy to locate. But the food was pretty average. May be due to the rush of puja. Biriyani was ok. Chicken chap was average. The chicken was not boiled properly. Carpet area is not that big. But it is very much pocket friendly.

Reshmi kebab is just awesome. Actually all the kebabs are nice, but they don't offer everything from the menu. They serve best kulchas in this area. Best thing is that they don't take any taxes. It deserves a 4 star depending on the price of the dishes. Even the Chinese is nice here.

Decent resturant for quick bites with friends, not for fine dining.

Used to be a regular back in my college days. They have a roll counter outside and an AC dining space inside. Their paratha and rolls are fried in dalda and looks bright red, and obviously very tasty. Their kebabs, tandoori and biriyani are good considering price. Mainly locals and college goers come to this resturant so ambience is rowdy. Service may be slow at times. If your in for good quality rolls and kebabs then do visit this place.

I tend to give my ratings based on diff categories. See Meridian inn is not a fancy place to start with. Yet they re the one and only decent eating joint in Khidderpore where u can sit peacefully with your family, away from noise and congestion and eat good food. When I rate them 4.0 I rate them that among budget hotels like India hotel and the likes and not a Taj Bengal 4.0! Now I ll tell u that meridian's many dishes score more than India hotel taste wise, in my opinion. India hotel is a  crowded, no privacy place where waitors don't bother if u ve been waiting at the table for half an hour. Here they re quicker...there s a lil privacy, friendly waitors(there s just two of them BTW!) And good food. Quality is laudable compared to starved chicken from India hotel or even Arsalan at rush hours!! Tandoori chicken, like I be said before - take aadha kacha! Mutton is soft and well cooked here sparing some jaw pain! Check out the Chinese stuff here too...I like their american chopsuey...with veg gravy. 
Doesn't pinch the pocket too much. P.S. theyre much smaller than India hotel so if u go with ten fifteen ppl, u ll hafta wait n fit snug here. Good for a big family or even seven!

This is one restaurant that has always disappointed me whether be its food or the ambience. First of all you will have to wait a lot for your orders to be placed before you.

Khiderpore being mainly dwelt by muslim community, there is no scarcity of gud biriyani serving resturants.
Yet meridian has always delighted me with its biriyani.
Located just below d flyover,in khiderpore more.it is not dat sophisticated bt its clean and tidy.
Though i hv alwys enjoyed their take-aways only.
The biriyani is always cooked perfectly.with no strong smell,no after taste of "dalda"(which is a major drawback in most places.)it is light yet very tasty,with tender meat and potato.
All other items dat i have ever tasted starting from chiken roll,paneer roll to fish fry,chiken tandoori,kababs...nothing has given me a chance to complain. 
And no VAT  extra is charged here-dis is an added advantage over the good food :????
I AM AN ABSOLUTE FAN OF THIS PLACE.
