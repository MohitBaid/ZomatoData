Pathetic service. Hostile staff. Half the items on the menu aren't available. You don't get what you order. A complete messed up place. Would advise people to stay away from this place.

This is actually d attached bar of Hotel Victerrece. It was empty when v entered. Ambience is good bt it's completely closed from all sides..so a feeling of being at a jail may be felt. Overall it was good. Dont wanna coment on d stuffs coz v didn't interact wid dem except placing our order.

Went for lunch. Ordered for Chinese which tasted good. Service time was also okay. However, the staff attitude was absolutely unprofessional. We went on a dry day, wherein since the bar was closed, there were no other customers excepting us. The staffs were lazy to take orders and we were provided with menu only after asking. Right from the waiters to security to cleaners, everybody was busy watching Bollywood movies in the restaurant TV itself sitting pretty on the restaurant chairs and sofas without even paying heed to us, who unfortunately was their customer.
