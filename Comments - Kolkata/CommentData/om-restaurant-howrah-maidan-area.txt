One of the best vegetarian Hotel to roam through. Everytime i went to  Howrah Maidan i go to have lunch over here . Mix friedrice(veg) along with Chilly Mushrooms always makes me feel hungry. One can go through Alu paratha, Hakka Noodles and babycorn aswell. It's a air conditioned restaurant with a nice atmosphere. Prices are also very cheap so it's  affordable to have lunch or dinner over there. 
Hope you all will like it.

It is located at howrah maidan towards towards howrah station road. A pure vegetarian restaurant for veggie lovers. Once after the classes, I and my college friends went for the shopping at big bazar and after that we were too hungry and we visited this place on one friend's request because she had some problem with nonveg food that day. We ordered tandoori roti and paneer butter masala. Food was average and very very pocket-friendly.

This restaurant is 2 minutes distance from my house at least once in a week for sure I visit and once in a month with friends.
In friends GRP order generally remains the same always it's always the best option for partying outside we always go to om for all our parties it's food is simply amazing.
One should definitely have the baby corn,manuchrian, Hakka noodles,fried rice, In sabji always Aloo do pyaza and dal makhani In roti the masala kulcha and butter naan.
Can't say enough it's always the best for me&my friends.

A place, very close to my friends place. Had heard a lot about the restaurant! About it good food and small pinch in your pocket.
This place is exactly at howrah maidan. No decor of that sort, but has quite spread out tables with a/c.
We did not order for any starters. Went straight to main course.
We ordered for 1 Dal makhni, 1 Kashmiri alu dum, 1 paneer butter masala and 4 butter tandoori roti! The food was great. At first i could not believe it! At that price. I would surely recommend the Dal makhni!
The total bill came upto 270/-
I would love to visit this place special for its rates, as being a student you always don't have that much money! So a thumbs up!

I visited that place with my friends because of one of our friends birthday was on that day and we went there to celebrate it. We have dinner there which was very awesome in  comparison of other hotels of howrah. The food was very affordable and also adorable.  We haved very much fun there . I suggest people to go there and have food. Specially peoples who loved vegetarian.  It also has one speciallity that it also have vegetables without onion and garlic in all seasons.
