Good service. Food is very very tasty. Quite pocket friendly! Loved the "stuffed tomato". Nice ambience and pretty cool inside. But the menu shown in zomato has been changed or upgraded. Around Rs.500 is fit enough for two college students .

This is a hidden gem. 
Almost missed it walking by. Located just next to Paradise Cinema. 

Staff courteous and the Food is finger licking good and prices are also not high.

Tried their Veg Jhalfrezi, Black Dal and Pineapple raita(must try). The quantity served is also very good. 

Overall 5/5.

Located very near to Kanha or near paradise cinema this is a shabby place with almost no service at all. I found many a times that this restaurant is closed for weeks for God known reasons but North Indian is good if u get it parcel and have.

We were looking for a different restaurant but landed here because we were too hungry and were looking for a vegetarian option. The interiors and ambiance are below average. It is a small place with the kitchen right in front of you. Limited but courteous staff. We ordered the Baby corn butter masala which tasted good, the rotis were soft and were tasted really nice. The plain rice though was too dry. A very pocket friendly place.

Although I have my roots deep into the non veg territory, I still feel the urge to go for something green from time to time and KVR served me quite the right way. The place is not too big but is organized in a very well manner with plants and well spaced tables.

The food is not too special but I was surprised by the quality and the service levels. The prices are not a matter to be worried about. After all it's Esplanade and this place blends just the right way.

It was a veg day for us and mom was not in mood to cook so we headed here after my dad finished his work at the shop. The place is pretty small to start with. The seating section is available through a fleet of stairs which takes you to an AC section. The place has a number of options to feast on. Without wasting much time we directly went for the main course 

Green Peas Masala
Mushroom Paneer Butter Masala
Dal Makhani
Butter Nan
Tandoori Roti

All the dishes were average to taste and was nothing exceptional. They should improve their quality if they want to stand a chance against its peer. But most importantly they should improve their food quantity which was pretty less. Price wise its cheap.
