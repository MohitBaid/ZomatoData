Food was simply awesome. 
The Mutton Biriyani was amazing - especially the mutton which was really tender.  
The Mixed Fried Rice was superb too with plenty of prawns and chicken.  I would rate the food over most of the well known Chinese joints in the city.

Ordered Chicken roll and got an egg and chicken roll.. Had to pay more for an abysmal roll which is just a slap on the universe of Katti Rolls. The level of their unprofessional behaviour is the most remarkable thing I have ever seen in my entire life.ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž

In the search for some pocket friendly place to have our lunch my friend & I chose this place seeing the low prices on zomato. This little gem of a place is located on the lane just beside PC Chandra jewellers leading to balwant just opposite of 9 to 99 apparel shop. The place is divided into 2 areas with the bottom one being for parcels & rolls while the above area is an AC dine in place with about 4 tables. The place is nicely lit with usage of bengali themed wallpapers which was certainly interesting & caught our attention. The menu consists of both indian & chinese basic dishes to satisfy respective crowd. My friend & I had the following items:-

1. Schezwan mixed noodles - Spicy thin basic noodles having chicken,egg & prawns with ample chopped vegetables sprinkled with generous spring onions as garnish. The noodles were certainly high on spice meter as per my friend & he thoroughly enjoyed it taste wise. The quantity was also on the higher side & could be easily shared by 2 non heavy eaters.

2. Chilli garlic chicken rice - Wonderful flavourful rice with burnt garlic,chicken bits & generous vegetables. The rice was also mixed with red chilli paste to give the spicy taste & it certainly tasted superb. The rice however in my opinion could have been cooked a bit more but none the less was good to consume. Again the quantity was commendable.

3. Chilli chicken dry - 8pcs of medium sized boneless chicken wok tossed with onions,capsicum & chillies. A indo-chinese classic dish which would certainly win your heart. The chicken pieces were juicy & very tender. Recommended.

The pocket pinch was certainly on the lower side with per head cost being Rs 220 per head. The place doesn't charge any GST. Certainly a place which would be cherished by students. The service was decent but they could improve upon the cleanliness a bit otherwise no major complains.
