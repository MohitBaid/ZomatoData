I have been to the place once.
The caf√© is small, not much sitting apace but still there is a thing about it. You can enjoy your coffee without all the hustle.
The coffee cost RS 90. I took a latte which was nothing extraordinary I must say. They could have slashed down the price a bit or make the coffee better. You dnt won't get the essence you're looking for in your cup of coffee.
I haven't tried other items but as it's a caf√© the coffee is what would attract customers. So I suggest please make 'Coffee'.

I have gone to this place twice and a word of caution, DO NOT go here. The first time I had gone, we had ordered pasta and some mocktail. The food was not amazing but it seemed like a decent little cafe. However, the next time, the place was smelling of rotten food. We practically had to leave without eating.

Since this is already my favorite cafe in the Rajarhat area, I must say it comes along with wonderful food. 

Nachos, Pasta, coffee or sandwiches, everything is delicious. 
Brownie with ice-cream is to die for! üòç

Good food. Found this cafe on Zomato. Best cafe to go to if you are in Rajarhat. Try their burger, nachos and non veg pasta. Staff friendly and makes the fishes tailormade according to one's taste.

Average place with average food and beverages. In a place like Axis Mall, because there are no other caf√©s to compete with, this is a place that one would go to. Else, no attraction.
