Radhu Babu's - A pocket friendly affair. 
=====
Location + Intro:

Radhu Babu's is located in one of the bylanes near lake mall.

I had finally got the chance to be there to try out their food. It is always crowded and the rush is quite a lot here. The place is quite simple and it is not very fancy if you really talk about the ambiance. It is a very small place with hardly few tables to sit. 

What is impressive about the place is the prices at which they are serving cutlets and fish fries. Despite the rush, the staffs of this place tries to cater to each and every customer. Nonetheless, it is not a place for vegetarians as not much items are there to cater their needs. 
=====
What i had:

• Special Chicken Cutlet - The cutlet was quite crunchy and filling. The coating was a bit thick. It was not at all oily. It was worth the money as well as the taste. It was served quite hot. 

• Half Fish Fry - I had two pieces of fish fry and they were also crunchy and served absolutely hot. 

• Tea - I took tea twice here. I really liked their tea because it was not very sweet and was balanced to my liking. 

Though, i also wanted to try their Roast Chicken but Stew and Roasts are only available on Thursdays. 
=====
Pros:

• Pocket Friendly Prices.
• Good Hospitality.
• Good Food. 

Cons:
• Not much options for the vegetarians.
• Seating capacity is low as it's a small shop.
• Ambiance is nothing fancy.
=====
Meal for two: 100-300 approximate. (Prices are subject to change due to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, etc.) 
=====
Summary: 

Taste 4.2/5 

Quality 3.9/5

Quantity 4.2/5

VFM 4.2/5
=====
Conclusion:

I really liked the food here. If you are looking for fancy ambiance and proper seating arrangements then this is not the place to be but if you are looking for good cutlets,roasts, stews and fries at pocket friendly prices, this is the place to be.

This is one of the many age-old eateries in kolkata which has achieved cult status. Located on the right hand side lane adjacent to lake mall, this take away joint is popular for its strong tea. I prefer the evening fare especially the fish finger, fish fry, chicken cutlet among others. Price list has no added frills and the items are cheap compared to newer joints in the area. But the atmosphere around the shop is priceless. The tender charm of old slow-paced calcutta will surely suck you in and the feeling will stay with you long after you have left the place!

Located just beside Lake Mall, this place features in Kolkatas oldest tea shops, with a large crowd always hovering around for the FISH FRY and CHAY..!!
Their CHICKEN KABIRAJI & CHICKEN CUTLET also deserves special mention, both being quite good, though the chay could have been better !!
But again, taste IS subjective, and the place is surely worth a try on a windy evening, considering the low pocket pinch..

May be it is a very famous snacks corner and also a favourite place for many but I was disappointed a bit visiting there. It is a very old eatery and mainly a takeaway joint located nearby Lake Mall. We went there to try their Fish fry which was unavailable then so we ordered for Mutton cutlets and tea. Mutton cutlets were not at all spicy and full of oil. It tasted kind of bland and all I can say is it tasted above average and the tea was horrible. A total dissapointment visiting there as they have completely lost their age old glory. Unfortunately there are no photographs as the food that came was dissapointment for us.

This is a very old eaterie located in the lane next to Lake Mall. It is always crowded with people of all ages due to the fantastic Kabirajis and Fries they serve!

• The Chicken Cutlet, which I tried out was a gem of a dish at an extremely affordable price! The quantity is noteworthy and the quality of the food too.

• Mutton Stew with Bread which is one of their signature dishes is tasty on one hand and healthy on the other!

• The Fish Finger and The Fish Fry is something you'll want more and more. Crispy and loaded with fish, the fry items are delicious and goes hand in hand with the Mustard Sauce they serve along with it.

Though it has a very less seating capacity and is a joint for snacks, this eaterie will fulfill one's sudden hunger cravings and the items which they serve will not at all disappoint it's customer. Service is quick compared to the huge crowd.

Recommended.

Pocket Pinch : 5/5

A very handy place to satisfy your evening munchies. The fries are very good, with the right amount of filling and meat. A total of 8 delicious items at 465/- is an amazing deal. And service is quite prompt - you only wait for your item to get fried and you're on your way. A 4/5 for taste, but a 5/5 for service

PS. They serve tea, so your wait seems even shorter than it is.

Maybe this was a legendary outlet years ago but now the place has totally lost its glory. The interior is totally shabby, gloomy and it's very difficult to even seat for 10 mins and have your food. While ordering their special recommended dish fish fry was out of stock, so out of choice we ordered the "special fish fry" and "mutton kabiraji" at rs 60and rs 45 respectively. The portion was relatively small compared to the prices and at such a place where there is a lot of options, this place didn't really impressed me that much.

They say every city has a character – an intrinsic, deep-seated flavor that shapes its people. What was once created due to a multitude of factors, then creates you. And Kolkata is no exception. Writing about Radhu Babur cha-er dokan (or tea stall) cannot merely remain a food review, for it is much more than a tea stall – this tiny space on Janak Road in the middle of Lake Market is a microcosm that mirrors the pulse of Kolkata. To be honest, it is one of very few such spots in South Kolkata, the posh, developed, and structured cousin of the archaic, gorgeous, and serpentine North Kolkata. And since I stay in south, this is one of those places where I frequently land up to soak in the vibe that defines my city.

“Adda” is a word that is well established in the vernacular, but it hardly has the significance as it does in a Bengali’s life. To me, it signifies a multitude of things – childhood memories, first cigarettes, freedom from studies, discussing art, science, and women – and the concept of adda, for us, is conversations with a group of people, tinged with an air of frivolity. “Chaa aar Ta” is another phrase we’ve grown up hearing – which means snacking with that MANDATORY evening cup of tea. When the two concepts converge, you arrive at the most intrinsic character of the city, and it is a phenomenon to observe. You walk out of your house any evening, and you will see inexplicable groups of people around every tea stall, engaged in deep conversations, replete with a bhnar/cup/glass of tea, and of course, cigarettes. Politics would be the major topic of discussion, which can, depending on the events of the day, veer to cricket, or fish prices in the market, or the impact of demonetization. It’s unreal how the same group of people can keep going at it every single evening, and this is a trait I have never observed in any other city. Radhu Babu’s is one such illustrious melting pot in the busiest part of south Kolkata, and it serves some lip-smacking “ta” or snacks (with the cuppa), fashioned after the unique amalgamation of Muslim and colonial food habits – that’s a story for another day. It has been the spot which many luminaries frequented, including no less than Ritwik Ghatak, Satyajit Ray, and a young, princely-looking Raj Kapoor (when he used to live in the city).

Well, down the years, the place has been branded as truly “iconic”, and justifiably so, as it is still capable of smothering you with nostalgia. Located on a by-lane, the customary “adda” groups would invariably be blocking the entrance, which you’d need to penetrate. Anybody unfamiliar with Radhu Babu’s could fail to see what’s special in the place – it looks extremely shabby, the place where they prepare the food may come across as a mess, but your best bet is finding a piece of a bench (with a table) where you can rest your butt. The menu is limited, and items are based on availability, but go break a leg, and order what you can! Of course, with the tea. The items I would particularly recommend are the Special Fish and Chicken Cutlets, the Fish Fry, the Mutton Cutlet, and the Chicken Korma (with a piece of bread). The Special Cutlet is a fillet of the meat fried with a layer of crumbly egg (Kobiraji basically), and it is great. The Fish Fry, as usual, is very good, albeit with a thinner layer of fish (expected at the price). The Mutton Cutlet is the braised cutlet you get in Kolkata, with a filling of pounded mince, onions, and coriander – super tasty as well. The Chicken Korma is a dream come true, and mopping up the delicious, silky smooth onion-paste gravy with the lightly toasted bread is an experience, true Kolkata-style. The Fish Fingers are good as well. None of the fried items are extraordinary, but the experience is priceless. And of course, there are the two stars of the meal.

Firstly, the Kashundi, or Bengali Mustard. I have never had a better one than Radhu Babu’s. Kept on every table in the squeezy bottles (that generally house ketchups in roadside shops), this is simply the most pungent and flavorful kashundi I have ever had. You may want to be careful with the dip, because a little too much can get you all teary-eyed, but the fun is in figuring that out. Once you identify the perfect amount of kashundi to complement your bite, you will have arrived at the singularly most fantastic match made in heaven. The second star is obviously the tea, again, made truly Bengali-style, with more water, less milk, and an avalanche of tea. Bengalis love their tea to be a bit more on the watery and stronger side, unlike the western part of India. The tea is sure to give you a kick, and it is the centerpiece of your experience at Radhu Babu.

Well, what can I say, Radhu Babu’s makes me wax eloquent. I am perhaps too afraid to highly recommend the place, because placing myself on the other side, I can perfectly see why one might not find this place to his/her liking. But for me, Radhu Babu’s will always remain one of the places that swathes me with nostalgia, the bittersweet kind that makes me wish I had kids, and that someday, down the years, I could get them here and say – “Look, this is your roots, the place where your city breathes its most intimate.” – all the while chomping on the fries with the same old kashundi, lazily sipping the same old tea, while the world around us hurtles to its manufactured, speedy demise. Touchwood.

Today my trip to this legendary eatery was some what disappointing. May be my expectations were too high..... After hearing so many good reviews of this place I was eager to taste their foods. We ordered special chicken cutlets, prawn cutlet and mutton cutlet. All these foods were good but not great. Dont get me wrong, all dishes were above average, and there is a nostalgia associated with this place. But when you judge the food and nothing but the food, it was not that good. I can name almost half a dozen "televajar dokan" which are far better than this eatery. But still I want to visit this place again to taste their kormas.

Excellent food. Dont expect an ambience here. Its more like a tea stall. I have been eating at radhu babus since my childhood and they have maintained excellent food quality. The tea is to die for. Also the chicken kobirazi or fish kobirazi (called chicken fry or fish fry here) is out of the world. The mutton kasha or chicken stew or chicken roast with a slice of bread is heaven. Overall i can sacrifice the ambience for the quality of food they serve.

I am quite amazed to find this small restaurant in Zomato. This restaurant is a very old and famous one. It is situated in Lake Market area(behind Lake Mall). Whenever I come to this place, I have make sure to have Mutton Stew and Bread. The Mutton Stew is quite delicious, as it is made in a very simple manner(without adding too many masalas) and the mutton is quite tender too. If I visit this place during evenings, I have a cup of tea with biscuits and sometimes a plate of Mutton Cutlet. I have tasted every items of this restaurant and believe me, you will love to have them again. The pocket pinch is very less and the staffs are friendly too. I recommend this place to everyone.

Radhu Babu's is a place for street food lovers,located near Lake Market.One should try their fish fry,it's lipsmacking. Kobiraji cutlet is satisfactory.Mutton Chop is also enjoyable.Rates are reasonable.This place is okay if you have shortage of money,otherwise many better contemporaries are there.

Situated in a lane just beside lake mall its a chai adda small joint. The price is low with a variety of snacks. We ordered tea, one mutton chop and one fish cutlet. Our bill came within 90 bucks. 
Now lets come to food, the mutton chop was of medium size with hardly any keema to locate ...it was more of a potato chop. The tea was good with the fish cutlet being of generous size. The fish cutlet was more of fish kabiraji. And the taste being okish. The place had a good amount of tea customers only. Thus if next time I am out of money I would definitely visit but if I am hungry then surely I wont.

Radhu babu's a typical evening time bengali cha adda place where you will find lots of people of various ages enjoying their tea with some telebhajas.

So one fine evening i was in that area for some work when i decided to call up my friend to join me up at radhu babu's for some fries. The place was jampacked on a saturday evening at around 6.45pm with people beaming in for their fries & teas. Its advisable to reach there early so that you can try their delicacies.  They have 2 tables if you want to sit & enjoy their food or else stand outside to avoid the cramp.

We took special chicken cutlet & special fish fry. The difference between this & the normal ones are their sizes. The fish fry had good fillet of bhetki but it was too salty when it teamed up with kasundi which ruined my experience since i'm very particular about my fish fries. Then came the special chicken cutlet, it was light with not overpowered with spice. The crunchy coating was adequate & was not too hard.

The prices are very pocket friendly although my experience was an average one to be honest

How can the day pass without a mention of the man who's birthday almost gets over in 30 minutes from now? And how can the post nevertheless not be related to food? The strong whiff of ginger and raw onion makes you stop in your tracks, turn your head to the neon blue board, procrastinate on that diet just for today and dive straight into the special fish fry or the mutton cutlet! Radhu babu off lake market, more known for nostalgia and old world charm and of course  its chops, cutlets, butter toast, kormas and milk tea above everything else! Where the tables only have a fresh coat of paint and possibly the cashier has a new name but everything else reeks of my childhood! We have a fond fable in our family where my eldest mama would hive funds from the daily bazaar allocation that dadu gave him to have that dim poach or chicken cutlet when in school. Sometimes he would submit accounts even before he'd set off to buy his vegetables and fish! It's the biggest seduction of the everyday buyer at lake market eversince it set up shop. A recent trip last Saturday and some special fish fries, a mutton and prawn cutlet and a cup of thick milk tea later, I couldn't vouch for taste and quality but the crowd that jostled to order their daily quota and the balding men who came everyday for their syrupy tea told me that sometimes you can't explain everything with scientific precision. Nostalgia sometimes works like a charm and of course love is blind! Ritwik Ghatak, Raj Kapoor and Ray were regulars at Radhu babu's... while I pat myself for that fantastic alliteration, here's raising a butter 'toast' to the Maestro of Cinema on his birthday!

"Radhu Babur Dokan" is a very famous name to food fanatics like me in Kolkata, friends are telling me to go there for past few months and I did pay a visit for the first time on 26th march 2017-Sunday and ordered "Fish Fry" but they gave me which is specifically a "Fish Kobiraji". When I asked the shop owner he told me it is called fish fry at their shop. At that moment I thought they do not have the fish fry and also do not to want the customer to go. But then I did not find any Kojiraji in the menu! it is funny that the entire Bengal call it Kobiraji but they are selling it as fish fry....is it true or am I a victim of an unfaithful marketing strategy here? :) :D

My working place being just adjacent to it I visit it almost twice every day.I would not like to comment on the tea because i simply like my tea creamy and masaledar. The one served here are watery and lack the richness. They dont serve coffee.
Coming to the other part which does require a mention is the snacks items : 
Fish fry,Chicken cutlet,Fish chop,Kabiraji ,toast. Along with that chicken and mutton stew last but not the least omelettes.

All of these items are if not excellent then good enough to test and very moderately priced.Seating space is very less.and not so tidy. But the price factor definitely draws the crowd.
The snacks items are served with salad and kasundi.

If you are here in this area you can surely give this place a try.

Again a legend, its one stop shop for chops & cutlets, chai for all south kolkata guys who follows traditional eateries. There has been some changes with due course of time. The paper cup has made way for the traditional cheap white china ware cup & plates on use. The size of the fries served has decreased in size in terms of thickness and volume (to be precise the square inch area has shrinked) but the prices have shot up. I understand the price hike, but I can't compromise to the quality. But still it tastes great with the kasundi served with the veggies. U don't get these delicacies in the same format at the same price anywhere around the world. So special chicken and fish fry 'Zindabad'.

Ambience is very simple , staffs are well behaved and service is quick.

We had tea, butter toast & fish fry. Tea was nice, butter toast was nice too, fish fry was of Bhetki, soft, crispy & tasty.

Overall a nice experience. There are many chic eatery and restaurants nearby, but this place has a special old world charm.

One of the oldest place to have snacks and tea in kolkata. I have Heard alot about this place from many people though i am a resident of that place only where the shop is. I never paid attention to the place. The place is always full of customer's. I even saw tollywood celebs having the popular " Radhu Babur Cha" with their friends. The place is mainly popular for it's Tea, Chops and Cuttlets.
Finally i decided to visit the place and discover what is it all about. Why people are so fond of this place. I ordered a cup of tea and Mutton Cuttlet. The tea was not at all extraordinary i didn't felt anything new. But it was good. Cuttlet were big and it was really good in taste. I liked it.
It was my curiosity to visit the place and it was nice.
You can try it if your having the same question's like me..trust your taste buds thats all i can say :)

Every single evening the place is flocked with localities and foodie buffs from near and far around. The food though is nothing excellent but just maintains a tradition. The specialities here are the Fish Fry and Chicken Cutlet, but as per my realisation, none of them is anything extraordinary. The sitting option is absolutely limited and hence get ready to eat while standing. You can obviously finish up your meal with a steaming cup of tea.

Located at lake market, this place is famous for its one of a kind fish fry. It is a very very small place and people usually take home the food, but the food is truly amazing. I don't know what to call it, because the fish fry is more like fish kabiraji but it tastes super good. One should definitely try the fish fry here and I'm sure that you won't be disappointed.

Lovely place for an exquisite range of cutlets and other sumptuous snacks!! 
Also known as Raj Kapoor's place as he used to frequent his place for snacks and adda during his stay in Kolkata, this place will not disappoint you for sure!!

Dropped by this place with my cousin one evening seeing such rave reviews from fellow foodies in zomato.But it's a bit overhyped I felt.Ordered 2 cups of tea along with chicken roast and a fish fry.Tea was strong but was a watery in consistency.I like it a bit thicker.In the fish fry the the fish in the filling was not adequate.Tasted okayish..I had better fish fries from other places in similar price range.Kasundi was good..had a nice kick of pungency in it.
The chicken roast came with 2 butter toasts.This was the only dish which won our heart.It was not a typical dry type roast..rather a gravy chicken dish.But the gravy tasted amazing..and the chicken was well cooked..very tender.We took two more bread toasts.
Not worth repeating I think since there are better places to try quality fries at similar price.

One of the oldest and legendary joints in Kolkata..! Its a very shabby place..
I went there after some shopping! 
I had their special chicken cutlet and tea..
I didn't expected that tea for 6 bucks will be in a proper cup..!
Service is really very fast..

Having a special chicken cutlet from here,coupled up with tea black/milk
Is a bliss...especially after a tiring day. Noticed one thing that the closing time of the shop is 10.30pm given over here but things get wrapped up early in the evening due to their unending sales. One of the best fry shops in South Kolkata region and quite old

Well I guess this is a pretty famous roadside food joint near lake market...so checked it out today..and I am very disappointed. Ordered fish fingers, veg chop and special chicken cutlet. Except for the veg chop..the rest lacked basic seasoning...the fish fingers were less of fish and more of batter..and the cutlet was bland. The tea is good..and ao is the swift service.

Located beside lake mall in the bylane this small place is famous for its cutlets...chicken cutlet, fish fry, and prawn cutlet are good...don't expect anything fancy, more suited for adda over cha and it remains crowded most of the time so its better to have your snack standing outside the shop or takeaway

RADHU BABU's , an off the road food joint which is not visible until you come to know about it or someone takes you there. Step in or stand in front of the shop, you get a retro feel of early Kolkata. But this not at all flamboyant food stop serves one of the best fries and stews in the city. To me, it did not generate a good impression at the first glance. But it all changed immediately, as soon as I took the first bite of their fish fry, that was simply served with a little mustard on the side and some onion rings. Then came a plate of korma with a rich thick gravy  and a couple of crunchy bread toasts alongside. It was so delicious that I couldn't help but reorder it again. The only odd thing is that when one orders a regular fry, something cooked in kabirajee style is served. Order a special fry, you get the regular ones !! But it is excusable as both of them taste good.

I don't know how people have rated this a one and stuff... But to each their own I guess, and in some way people might user expect hospitality and service but these places are the essence of a land called KOLKATA. Cutlet, fish fries, kobirajis these are items one only gets best in these places and hence, "hidden gems". Ever been to Kolkata and not tried out at these places don't return, ever stayed in the same and still not tried coz it's "tacky" you actually have never felt what Kolkata is, anyways. Moving on, special mention Mutton Kobiraji, and fish fry. Not a fan of tea though, so no commitments on that front. Peace.

There are some eateries in Kolkata which have attained cult status, Radhu babu being one of them. Given that this was stared pre independence, its pretty old. The small eatery is located in the  rightlane adjacent to lake mall.
It's a small outlet, lacking mordern decor but through out the day this place is crowded with patrons, some of whom come daily yo have their famous"cha" and crisp toast.
This shop has two signature dishes stew and korma, which is amazing!! I packed fish finger and fish fries. Though the fish fingers tasted superb but they packed kabirajee instead of fish fries.

Located in the Janak Road street beside lake mall.
This is a very old roadside joint, selling stews, kormas,fries and cutlets.
Me with my friend went there for a quick bite with lots of expectations. 
We ordered Tea and fish fry for ourselves.Tea was hot but not up to the mark,even the small roadside tea stalls make better tea.
Now for the fish fry, we specifically ordered "FISH FRY" but what they served us looked more like FISH KABIRAJI which was extremely oily.
Overall a disappointing experience....

Behaviour of the person who sits for cash is pathetic. I asked for a specific item  on Sunday evening , the person who was sitting there gave a sly laugh ...I asked again whether it's available ,he said "u will get it next Thursday" ..my question is why u should treat t he customers in this manner..??? where in your menu card it's mentioned which product is available on which date? In this buyers market you are still in the old sellers market regime. U will fade one day that's for sure. Making fun of customers ....this is not taken.

Personally, I like the Fish Fry from Radhu Babu rather than the Chicken cutlet but that is a personal choice. This does not mean that the other menu is somewhat not good. Have anything here starting from a fish fry to korma and stew, you will like everything and come back for more. The food is awesome and the prices are damn cheap.

This is a very old roadside joint located just beside the lake mall and selling lip smacking stews, kormas & fries. The shop is very small and the ambience has nothing special to mention more like it's North Kolkata's counter parts. People can sit outside and have tea which is served through out the day. In the evening it's crowded and the hottest selling items are fish fry, mutton stew, cutlets and fish chop and of course toasts. But having tasted the fries and cutlets of other parts of Kolkata I would not say they sale the best fish fry or mutton cutlet. But if you consider the price you have to pay..its absolutely worth a try. Prawn cutlet does not have much prawn to be true. Recommended for breakfast and evening snacks.

I have been going to this place for the last 20 years. Definitely a place for the foodies who want to taste the real taste of Kolkata food at cheap price. The food is served from 6.00 am - awesome breakfast , butter toast with double egg omelet followed by a special Radu Babu's Cha ( tea) and that at only ₹ 35. 

The shop is closed during the lunch and reopens at 3.30 pm. Try with the Chicken/ Mutton Stew , Chicken/Mutton Korma - best in class. The fries and cutlet are good and not the best. 

The tea is available throughout the day and it's the tea drinkers den. 

The good part of the shop is the price and the limitation is the ambience.

I had special chicken cutlet and special fish fry, damn cheap,45₹ and 50₹ respectively. I personally liked the fish fry more than the cutlet. I suggest to go at around 4:30pm afternoon, as the fish items are most popular and promptly gets out of stock. Happy hunting, fellow foodies!

The best thing about Radhu Babu's is their morning tea, which can be accompanied with thin Britannia biscuits and a hearty breakfast of buttered toasts or slices of plain toast, omelets or poached eggs. A rendezvous with a cup of hot evening tea is also a sinfully delightful affair, teamed with a snacky quick bite. Know for its 'cha' and Bong food, this place truly is a hidden gem.

Sometimes one simply feels defeated. There is virtually no strength left to fend the onslaught of the life's troubles and tensions. Tired and sapped of energy at such times one desperately looks for a magical pick -me-up, something similar to what Jeeves may have served Bertie Wooster! Jeeves, unfortunately, lives only in the pages of P G Wodehouse novel. There is but one person, one establishment in our very own city which could teach even the wise Jeeves a thing or two about pick-me-ups!  
The tea at Radhu's is magical; it is heavenly. It is as invigorating as the mythological nectar churned out of the depths of the ocean!   A sip of that heady brew would probably make British long to come back and rule India once more. 
The place is a small tea shop in one of the bylanes near lake market. Come evening and on the pavements around this place descends the crowds of people like hungry pack of hyenas. And then the mandibles of the jaw of a section of people get down to work, chomping merrily at scores of chicken cutlets and fish fries while another section begins raising the proverbial storm in the white China clay tea cups! 
Sipping my cuppa of joy after polishing off two special chicken cutlets, I couldn't help become one with the surrounding. After that, there was nothing but pure ecstacy!

This is an authentic tea centre in Janak Road. It boasts of having several luminaries of yesteryears as its customers. Me and my mother went there. Car parking was difficult. When I went there, I was surprised to see a vast menu hung for us to place order. I asked the manager whether all of the dishes mentioned therein are available. He confidently said, " you name anything from here, everything is available." Then I asked for prawn cutlet. The manager immediately looked apologetic and said that it was not available. So much for his confidence.
Anyway, I ordered tea for my mother and chicken cutlet for ourselves. I don't drink tea, my mother said that it is not upto the mark. However my mother may not be a good judge as she prefers black Darjeeling tea with no milk and very little sugar which they could not provide. Chicken cutlets were oily and nothing extraordinary, but as I have told you all before that I don't like deep fried food very much. A very popular centre.

Give it a try. Will remind you of 90s Bengali street food.

Food is good: classic cutlets but with a bit of oil. 
The ambience however is not good at all. The shop is very small and only 6-10 people can eat inside and there are benches outside for sitting. 
So, this is more like a fancy roadside eatery cum small cafeteria. Don't come here wishing to eat at a restaurant.

This 3.5 rating is only for food at very reasonable price. 1st.  Tea, classic ! What I tasted 30+ yrs. before I get the same taste even recently. Butter toast , Egg- Poch is always well done. For delicious food come A/noon & try Mutton Stew , Chicken Stew & Kobiraji Cutlet & all others are simply yummy. I always enjoyed their food. 
            But Hygine area is significantly bad. Pls. Note I'm not mentioning about decor or ambience, but cleanliness is the area they should give immediate priority, just give a look at the Partition , walls of Kitchen surroundings & Cutlary washing area is total disaster. Then stingy smell right at the entrance is just unbearable. Once I pointed this but they didn't take in right spirit, hence my foot- fall there is drastically reduced. I hope they take care of this  & I may have the opportunity to take a bite at those great food at very pocket friendly price.

The succulent muttons and the spicy gravy make a delicious combo. The crispy fish fries and lip smacking prawn cutlets are real delights!! The owner is very polite, staffs are cordial.

Truly can b termed as a hidden gem of kolkata. Located in the lane next to lake mall,they serve awesome chops and cutlets along with tea and biscuits. I had their fish fry and fish chop along with tea. It was awesome. They serve good stew and korma with bread but didnt taste all that. Will surely do on my nxt visit. Prices are damn cheap. A must visit place for all chop-cutlet lovers

Aha!!! This is one of my favorite chawp cutlet-er dokan!! Try their piping hot milk tea with their trademark fish kabiraji. Their mutton korma is also top notch. The succulent muttons and the spicy gravy make a delicious combo. The crispy fish fries and lip smacking prawn cutlets are real delights!! The owner is very polite, staffs are cordial.

I have been to Radhu Babu's only once or twice , and for me it was not at all impressive . Yes, i knew it was a glorified tea stall , made famous because its been there for long . Hence , the ambience is nothing great - there's at most 2 tables to seat , if you are lucky or really interested . Place is dingy and normally crowded in the evening or early morning . You need to stand and eat . You also need to be sure that you eat the proper items . 
Tea is OK , nothing special and you can have it with Marie biscuit . I had a Chicken Fry , which was extremely oily ... as in dripping to make your hand and shirt and trousers wet . But we also had a Special Fish Fry , which was better and definitely value for money , if you compare it to a Bijoligril Fish Fry which comes at 5 times the price .

It is a very famous and old shop and so I went with my friend to check it out. A small shop with high demand for tea & fries/cutlets, people gathered all the time infront of the shop to order.
We ordered two Special chicken cutlet for takeaway.
The chicken was smooth and big enough according to its price. The taste was nice and it was fried optimally. Good place for a quick hot snack.

Discovered this place through the 'Hidden Gems' section on Zomato. The place is in the street beside Lake Mall near Deshapriya Park. Its a small streetside snacks shop but has 2 small tables for seating. 
     We ordered for fish finger, special fish fry and prawn kobiraji. We had their tea while waiting for our order. You can order your tea to your liking - with/without sugar/milk. They also serve coffee here. As the kitchen and dining space are one and the same, we opted to sit outside and eat. The tea was wonderful and refreshing. The fish fingers and special fish fry were nicely done and very delicious. The prawn kobiraji was a bit of a let down because the prawn was not good and they had given too much oil into preparing it. Our bill came up to a measly 140 rupees. 
       There are a lot more snack options and the chicken korma, i have heard, is sumptuous. But thats for another time!

"Not as good as olden days", says my dad. Radhu Babu's is a pretty old eatery located in the Lake Market stretch. Haven't been to the store so can't comment on the ambiance but I would guess it's old infrastructure.

Dad recently bought some Chicken Cutlet from here. It was just okay I would say. According to him, they were far better earlier. If I had to compare with Campari, they are far superior than Radhu Babu's.

Radhu babu is an authentic bengali tea and snacks shop in near lake mall. It gives you dinget licking snacks without burning a hole in your pocket. I would always go for radhu babu rather than opting for any fast food chains. I had tried their chicken kobiraji ,fish finger and their chicken cutlet.
Result: a happy human with a happy stomach and delicious memories

I have heard from elders that the matinee idols Uttam Kumar and Suchtra Sen used to come to this shop for tea and snacks. 
I myself have loved the tea and with it the chicken and prawn kabiraji cutlets. In fact all the chops are great. A nostalgic place reminds you of Kolkata in the 1960s.

That traditional Bengali tea shop. Where the drink gets served in nice white cup and saucer. And to go with it ? Marie biscuits. Life is anyways complicated . At least there are places to keep the tea simple ! 
There's a mad rush for their kabiraji cutlet and fish chop too , which gets exhausted pretty quickly. I am not a great admirer of these, a bit oily for my tastes. But their tea just rocks.

It's situated just by the lake mall. It's a small place with an enormous fan following. Still after so much of the crowd we were courteously asked what would we have by the waiter.well we had an awesome kabiraji cutlet, special fish fry, bread toasts and chicken korma.. Well I would like to say the special fish fry isn't so good as per the price.the others are good. Would like having their other food sometime else.. :-)

Small vintage joint for Adda, tea and some quick bites. Located opposite Lake Mall parking entrance. Don't judge this place by its look, what's important is what they serves. Go for breakfast or evening bites this place is always buzzing with people of all ages. I love their tea. All fried items go perfect with tea and buttered toast!! Mutton/Chicken Korma and roast chicken both are delicious. The health conscious soul may try their mutton/chicken stew. It's simple but yummy. Superb service by the boys. USP is definitely their pocket friendly price and quality food. 
Cheers!!

Memories is the word for many when it comes to Radhu Babu's. Located in the lane just beside Lake mall(Basement parking side) on Janak Road. It is a very old and famous shop. It does not have much place for sitting but the food sure makes up for it. In the morning the place is a major attraction for morning walkers and shoppers, stopping for a quick bite of toast, amazing masala or plain omelette and tea. In the evening, the special chicken cutlet is superb. A good sized chicken fillet covered with crumb and served hot with mustard sauce and salad. The special fish fry is equally good and sure to make you come back again. The mutton stew is also quite good with a bit different taste. If you like a light tea, you might try it here. The service is also quite prompt and doesn't make you wait much for your food. 
It's a great place to stop by for a quick snack which is relatively reasonable.

TL;DR: Strong Tea, Conversations, Old school.  Fabulous people. 

This was my third time in Calcutta and just like the previous two experiences, this one also started off on a horrid note with rains and traffic and damp squib weather. I just wanted to curl up in my bed at Oyo and spend the night in front of the TV. 

Then somehow I stumbled upon this place on Zomato and it showed this place was like 300m away. And with reviews like old school adda with Chai and conversations I braced myself and walked in the rains to the joint. 

I had the signature Fish Fry with mustard sauce and toast. It was definitely different from the kind of Fish fry that I'm used to in Kerala, less of Masala. It was good in a different way. The Chai was strong, good strong. Perfect for the rainy weather. 

There were elderly uncles at the table discussing cricket and football. I was eavesdropping on their conversation and it was fun listening to them, you could make out they were passionate. I made my way out and just stood there waiting for the rains to stop. 

A very old uncle came up and started chit chatting,  he was around 70. He mentioned that he has been coming here for well over 40 years, had moved to US for twenty years in between but now back to Calcutta, and a regular here for the evening Chai. He was reminiscing about the good ol' days, growing up in Calcutta. We talked a bit about our lives and finally when the time came to leave he offered to drop me to my hotel due to the incessant rains. 

I was humbled at the politeness and we exchanged few notes. He finally dropped me and wished me luck,  I thanked him for the kindness. 

While this is not really a review of the restaurant, more like a review of the city, the culture. I've heard lots of good stuff about Calcutta but had horrid luck till today. I feel humbled by the experience and look forward to coming back and exploring the city more. Thank you for reading this far if at all you did :)

Lake market, deshopriyo park n southern avenue has always been my playground from the young age...I know most of the good food places herein. However, I was surprised to miss out on this particular one having such high rating in zomato. So I took upon the duty to explore this place.
It is located in the lane beside the parking entry of the lake mall. A small food joint, not a restaurant,having 2 mere sitting benches, serves some awesome Bengali evening snacks.
Though I was disappointed at the fact that there wasn't the chicken roast (only available on Thursday) n mutton stew ( available any day except Sunday), we ordered a fish fry n 2 plates of mutton quorma with 4 slices of bread.
The fish fry wasn't typically a fish fry, more of a kobiraji, with egg coating on thin slice of fish. To be true, it was extra oily n pretty thin slice of fish n i didn't like the kobiraji outlook of a fry. Also, Aponjon being in the near vicinity of this place serves far better fish fry. The mutton quorma was a piece of work. Ultra Soft, single, decent sized piece of mutton served with an awesome curry and 2 pieces of bread toast was just delicious. I liked it so much that I repeat ordered it. I ordered a liquor tea after that, let's just say, its not their strongest suit!!
Overall i would rate this place to be a nice evening snacks outing, very low on budget n high on value. In true sense this is a #hiddengem #kolkataklassic !!
PS 150 bux for 2ppl.

Update:
Want to add pics of the mutton stew n veg chop that me n my wife had here. They also tasted good.

You should visit this place at least once... Me and my friend ordered special chicken cutlet and fish fingers. The cutlet was just awesome... Pure chicken breast fried to the optimum level.. The place was crowded with people from different age groups. The tea they serve is mediocre. But the fried stuffs were too good.  The korma dishes seemed delicious but unfortunately couldn't taste it.. I Hope to give them another visit and try the korma if available...

A favourite snacks bar/take-away since childhood! There have been such evenings, when I was little(till my teens) , Dad used to take me to Radhu Babu to cheer me up with their famous fish fry, chicken/mutton korma, fish/mutton chops & their signature style chicken stew & toast. The ambience is that of an old world office para charm, but thats what makes them unique. The food is fresh, pocket friendly & delicious. If you mind waiting or eating here, just get take-aways, the food is worth every penny of it! :)

Before giving any review on this food joint , I must say that I have deep down connection with the origin of this restaurant. The one who started this food joint was my Dad's Uncle. This is just to say that I wont be partial, I write my review from a customer point of view. Though its a small place by roadside, its a heaven for all bengalis who would like to have a taste of authentic bengali snacks. Kabiraji, chicken roast, Chicken chaap served with bread toast, cutlet and fish fry is an absolute treat for all foodies. And never ever forget to taste the tea. And all this is available at a very economic rate. Remember one thing, the day you plan to go, reach there by 5pm, the craze is so much among the locales as well as many tollywood celebs that stock almost finishes off my 7pm. Though the shop has few seats to sit and enjoy the food, People prefer eating it by the roadside or sitting in their own car.

This place is old house adda zone for local elders. The place is small and gives a old age charm. With tea and Marie biscuits being the most selling items. The fish fry was ok in size but lacked taste. The tea was normal black tea with milk poured separately.
It's a favourite among the locals and certainly worth a try if you are around the lake mall area. Fish fry, fish finger worth a try.

Radhu babu's is a very old eatery in lake market. Famous for its kabiraji and cutlet, this place attracts a lot of office-goers who drop by to enjoy cha,cutlet and adda. The evening and morning items are different and within the shop, a small seating arrangement is there. So mostly one has to settle for the chairs on footpath infront of the shop. Recently the taste has detoriated a bit and the last time i went, the food was too oily. But as my previous experiences are memorable with good food, this rating is very natural.
 
A good joint for budget street, hygenic food.

a small food joint beside lake market (now known as lake mall). a bit claustrophobic during the day. But its a local favourite spot for evening addas over chai and toasts. its a pocket friendly food joint, and what i like the most about this joint is the feel it offers, the feel of real old calcutta,addas and politics and football. i love the tea here,its strong and raw and it has a beautiful flavour, unlike other places where they serve sugar syrups in name of cha. you should definitely try the different varieties of cutlets and chops and the legendary kabiraji. if you are a bengali,by birth or by heart, u gonna like every bit of this place. 3/5 for the food and services. otherwise a strong 4.5 for the vibe here.

To review Radhubabu's tea shop you have to first understand the Bengali psyche.Early 60's and 70's this locality,unlike now,was mostly populated by the middle class and upper middle class intellengtsia.The concept of dining out was restricted to maybe a monthly visit to Waldorf and takeaway Chinese was the flavour.
So what does the Bengali bhadralok do in the evening?After a musical soirée,or a game of carrom,or a late fish bazaar in the adjoining lake market,Radhubabu's is where they converged for a fierce adda over anything from Mozart,Lenin and Godard and accompanying the light Bengali 'Cha' were the chops,cutlets and fries along with toasts and omelettes to keep the energy flowing.
Today we restricted ourselves to the chicken cutlet and the korma.Of all the reverberations from the past,these two bravely carry the flavour forward and so does the tea.This was always a pavement standing eatery so the limited seating inside is actually a bonus.Legend has it that the late Manna Dey never went for a concert without wetting his throat with Radhubabu's Cha.Well after having our feel can't deny that we felt the urge to hum a few songs by the great singer as well...

Radu Babu might not feature in your typical Heritage Food walking tour but it deserves to be a rightful part of it. Very very centrally located, it is a shop, minus the frills but with the taste intact. Almost everything on its menu is delicious but the Kabirajis, Fish Fry, Chicken Cutlet (personal favourite, not stuffed with "bhyajal" but with only chicken), Chicken Korma and Stew. However, the unsung hero is its Vegetable Chop and tea, which is a must try.  If you do decide to come to Radu's, visit before 7. Because by then, most of the items fly off the shelves. Very very moderately priced, don't forget to come to Radu's when you are in or about Lake Market.

Location: In the lane adjacent to Lake Mall (Basement Parking side/Exit Gate).

Having heard a lot about this place, it was on my wishlist for quite sometime now. Was finally visited on April 15, 2015 around 18:00 hours.
It's a small joint with a seating arrangement for  ten heads serving chops, cutlets, omelette, toasts and tea.
Seeing a high people flock around the place sipping on tea and enjoying cutlets, my expectations from the place increased. The menu is inclined towards the non-vegetarian fare with a couple of vegetarian options.
The following were the only options in the vegetarian category:

- Vegetable Chop
Was unavailable.

- Toast (plain)
Was crisp, but, burnt from the corners. Decent tasting.
The buttered variant is available only in the morning.

- Biscuits
They tasted good, thanks to it being the packaged Britannia thins. 

- Tea
Wasn't at all up to the mark, the water to milk ratio wasn't balanced with the former being too high. Tasted as if a couple of spoons of milk were added to liquor tea and served. Sugar levels were found low (can be added). Disappointed.

• The hygiene levels were found to be low.

About the staff and service, the friendly staff served at a prompt speed.
The Prices undoubtedly were pretty cheap and were in tune to the quality served (at least the vegetarian fare; opinions might differ for the non-vegetarian fare).

Overall a disappointing experience.
- May be this place excels in the non-vegetarian fare only (as the other reviews suggest).
- Vegetarians can miss on this place, better options available. :)

This rather large hole in the wall with a few chairs and benches is nothing short of a historic presence in the area. 

A nostalgia factor sees people from all across the city coming here just for a session of Adda over the infamous tea. Along with the tea, they serve snacks such as Kobiraji and Samosas. The Kobiraji cutlet is a must have and is what this place is well known for. 

Whenever around this area, take some time out to visit this place.

Radhu Babu’s glory becomes quite evident once you set foot into this tiny room with two tables and four benches, with a mini kitchen darkened with soot fitted snugly right beside. The rush never stops as office returnees come pouring in for their evening snack or shoppers from Lake Market stop by for a cup of tea. The fish kobiraji with a slice of bread seemed to be the most sought after combo followed by mutton korma and bread. We settled for a special chicken cutlet and the fish kobiraji as our initial preferences (chicken cutlet and chicken roast) are made only on Thursdays. The kobiraji was small and oily but the little fish filet tucked into it was definitely tasty. No wonder it’s quite the hit. The chicken cutlet had a thin coating and was less oily but it lacked flavor and punch. Also, the meat was a bit hard to chew on. The tea was strong and flavoursome unlike that of the roadside stalls which use CTC tea. Their service was nice and fast as well. Overall, it is a decent place to drop by for a bite when in that area.

This place is one of the rare vestiges of the “purono kolkata”. Located in lake market area Radhubabu’s with a couple of simple wooden table and benches is nothing short of a sheer heritage . You can still find dozens of regulars young and old sipping on to their cup of tea and churning up the quintessential adda/juktii-torko. One must try their tea and chicken korma while you can get bread and butter in all its myriad forms omlette/morich toast/dim toast to name a few . They are open till 9pm and you get your last cup at 8-30 there are no exceptions ! Being a very proud Bengali I just love this place for the little nuances of  un bangaliana that it still exudes.

This is a heritage place and a different cult altogether.. Comparing it with modern cafes would be unwise. Their fries are always on high demand and one will miss them if he reaches late at evening. The prices are really low and quality high. Its a must try for bengali style fry lovers.

Radhu Babu's is the legendary and one of the oldest food outlets of South Kolkata. It is located just beside Lake Mall. Do not judge this outlet by its looks or ambience. Go here, grab a bite and thank me afterwards. ?The inside of the shop has 2 tables and four benches which can accomodate maximum 12 people. There are many tools on the pavement outside. The owner of the shop is a well-mannered person and his dedication to the shop is admirable.
Food-every food item of this place is awesome. I love their fish kabiraji, fish cutlet.... And that chicken special cutlet... Uff.. Tingles my tastebuds.. ?Mutton Chop is not available all the days. I tried their chicken korma once with bread. It was lipsmacking. The meat was cooked perfectly and the gravy was soooo tasty. They serve tea, butter toast etc. Interistingly this shop sells Britannia Thin Arrowroot Biscuit which is unique.
Somnath verdict-go for the food, not for the ambience. The food here will make you come back again and again.

Whatever you write about this place no one is bothered. A legendary must visit Calcutta eatery. Its there since my father was in his teens.A regular place for so many people.
A very small place. Zero ambiance, zero decor. Hardly you can sit. And if you sit hardly you can move. So we regulars sit in the car and service provided. Else stand in the footpath, order, chat,and eat.
Morning its open from 6am and by 9am all done. Bread, egg and tea in age old different forms. Bread toasted with a dollop of butter . Sugar or salt n pepper or all of them sprinkled to your choice. A simple omelette or poached or half fried. This is not the fancy place for cheese bacon omelette or such other staffs. And tea is must. Raw or with milk. Everything is fresh, homely and hot. The tea is excellent.The shop closes by 9.30am and again opens around 4pm.
Evening . The list is bit elaborate. Go through the menu please because if I start  I'll keep on writing about each item detailly. Every thing is just great . This is the way to find the old Calcutta food flavour. Try this place foodies new in town. Love you Kolkatta.

This piece of splendid gem is just located adjacent to lake mall in lake market. This outlet has been serving for decades with unaltered dedication towards customer satisfaction. Whichever season it be,this shop opens from early morning and goes on till late night and it always stays cluttered with people. Though it is quite a small joint as far as the space is concerned but cleanliness and hygenienic factor is completely uncompromised. Their offerings include tea, bread toasts, omlette, chicken/mutton cutlets, fish fry, fish chop, prawn cutlet, veg chops, chicken kasha, chicken korma, mutton korma etc; have tried almost all of their offerings till date and I have always been more than satisfied and relished everything till the last bite. A cup of aromatic and rich flavored tea along with crispy piece of toast over here is a magical and heavenly combination. Now coming to the most surprising part regarding this joint I.e. "the prices", the moment you will take a look at their price chart, your jaws are gonna drop for sure after looking at the rock bottom prices. A plate of mutton korma(4 pieces) is just of 45 bucks. I guess this restaurant offers the most succumbing dishes at the cheapest rates in town. Definitely a holy grail for foodies with a "pocket friendly" criteria.

One of my favourite. The mutton kabiraji is superb and truely valu for money. Last but not the least dont forget to try the tea.  Only problem is that everything gets over at 7.30.

This should be on the "Legendary" list on Zomato.
This place has lasted for ages and yet their style of cooking and service has not changed a bit. It's one of those places where you get the felling of 'Rock er adda' in South Kolkata.
Coming to the food I'd say everything here is delicious! Honorary mentions would include the mutton cutlet and the prawn cutlet. Even if you do not like mutton do try the mutton cutlet. 
Plus a cup full of tea worth just 5 bucks is something nobody should miss. :)

I'd say 50 bucks is enough for two people to have a proper evening snack at 'Radhu's dokan'.

Go there for good bengali Fast Food. The 'Fast' is relative as you will have to wait among of a crowd of loyalists. The size of this crowd and the fact the place has lasted so long in a locality which sees new joints springing up by the hour, speaks volumes of the taste. The fries are as good as any but dont miss the stew. And if you dont have tea and toast with this you will be breaching tradition..

7 years before, I used to visit this place, when I my office was at Lake Place near to Lake Market for taking evening snacks. I always prefer junk food. Few months before I visited lake mall. After shopping I realize I should visit this for remembering  my old days. 

Fish Kabiraji just awesome like before.

This is a place where you get the old charm of CALCUTTA.
Not a wide variety but this place boasts of Cutlets, Kabirajis, Chops and Fries.
The chicken and mutton stew is an all time hit here. 
Since its beginning till today, the place has not changed, no branches expanded, no incrememt in area. A little renovationd here and there. 
You are always greeted with a warm smile. Tea Station for the "Purono-para" members along with marie biscuits.
Pure nostalgia !!

A must try for all foodies!!

Do not ignore this place while passing Lake market as a dingy dirty one, it has way more to it. It is busy, hustling and bustling with people of all ages all throughout the day. It has been standing at this location for ages now. I remember accompanying ma to Lake Market when young, being left in the car when she went shopping and I would stare at the crowd gobbling cutlets, slurping stew and tea with glee on their faces. On one such evening, I had thrown a tantrum and we got introduced to Radhu Babu's mutton Korma, popularly called kobiraji!
From that day on, the korma has been a regular invader at my place. The word spread, my cousins got introduced and every time demands were made on their visit for Radhu Babu. Till date, the quality of the korma has remained top-notch. Yes, you cannot ignore the oozing oil from the crispy egg batter, but what the hell! Kobirajis were never supposed to be light, right? Thus Radhu Babu got it right - thick, STUFFED generously with mutton, fried to perfection. The good thing about the korma is the quality of the oil and meat. Never have I felt weird and heavy after gorging on it. Also, bringing it back home and microwaving does not compromise on the quality of the Korma, which is a SUPER impressive point according to me.

An old treasure of a place and certainly claiming its rightful spot on the heritage food map of Kolkata is Radhu Babu's. I absolutely love the tea they serve and thankfully since I visit Lake Market often I need no further excuses to drop by for a cup of the excellent Cha ! A butter toast with that and you just want to sigh with happiness. The fish fry and cutlet are also quite nice if  you are feeling like a bite. Pocket friendly with no extra frills .... if you are a foodie in the city and have not visited you should drop by .... the tea and butter toast are one of my favorite winter evening treats.

Heritage! This place is one of those haunts which I loved ever since I got introduced to it by a friend. The small, slightly dirty place boasts of two amazing things - the chicken/mutton stew, which you should ideally sop up with thick cut bread, toasted and buttered, or go for a plate of korma, which is again, another personal favorite of mine. I actually like eating the korma solo, and add a cup of tea to balance it out. Although they make a decent fish fry and cutlet, I am not much of a fan, and I stick to the Korma and Stew mostly, and if I am in the mood, go for the butter toast with poach, which is simple, good food at the cheapest price in Lake Market region.

I remember buying snacks from here. Its a typical Bengali fast-food corner. Famous for its tea & chicken cutlet. Very cheap. The cooking process also didn't seem to be unhygienic. So step in if you are travelling over Lake Market area.

One visit to lake market near kalighat metro station and Radhubabu's welcomes you with the signature smell. Long line of plastic chairs, lots of cups of tea and marie biscuit;and Bengali babus chomping on best-in-class juicy and succulent mutton pieces in that oh-so-gorgeous stew. And at nights? Fish and chicken cutlets enrobed in fluffiest egg batter, deep fried, direct to your gastronomical pleasure, if you please, ladies and gentlemen. And that signature Milk Tea.
Not for health conscious people. Although they maintain excellent food hygiene. 
Must visit if you want to understand the feeling a bong is. :-)

Radhu Babu, a place where heritage is above everything. Over the decades they have always been one of the best Tea Cafe in South Kolkata. Radhu Babu, still holds a very special place in everyone's heart who have been there once, despite the growing culture of modern coffee shops. Their Fish Kabiraji and Cutlet are cult favorite along with the Mutton Korma and Stew, which steal the show. It leaves you with a strange contentment when you have some of their tea after a good meal. P.S: Their tea is perhaps one of the best in South Kolkata. 
I would give them a 4 as they have been phenomenal over the years but the quality of Fish Kabiraji which is a hot favorite has decreased a bit, now.

"Radhu Babur Cha ar dokan" a small one room food junction situated in Lake market. Considering the decor and facility, this shop is nothing but the food they serve are just out of the world. Being a localite I have visited this shop innumerable times. And every time I visit I am oversatisfied with the taste. The kabiraji's, cutlets and unique mutton stoo they serve can't be described in words. This attraction of the taste has not even spared Mahanayak Uttam Kumar,Raj Kapoor and many more eminent personalities. A place where Rs.100 is enough to sooth the tasbebuds of the foodies. I would recommend everyone to be the part of history.
