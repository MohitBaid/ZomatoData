I don't like sweets..
But this place made me fall in love with their jalebis.
After college we were walking down the lanes when suddenly a friend asked us to visit this place as he is a huge fan of this place 
We agreed but as I don't have a thing for sweet I didn't order anything.
My friends asked me to try so I took a jalebi
But soon ended up eating 3 of them.
Absolute bliss üíú

Yes, this place is such a gem. Been here almost a dozen times with friends or shall I say, brothers. The food is excellent and it's very cheap as well.
I bet you people from out of Bengal, show me a similar street side restro which can give a large tea at ‚Çπ12 and kochuri for almost the same price. I bet you can't!

Samosas, Kachuris, Malpoas, Gulab Jamuns, Jalebis and Tea. The menu is small, but the preparations are big in their own rights. Most living in Southern part of Kolkata know this place and have been here, it is that popular. Always crowded, this place is a testament to the fact that good food can be enjoyed anywhere, be it the best of restaurants or the pavement. Ultimately, the food matters above anything else.

I had heard so much about this place. Finally gave a visit for morning sweet cravings. Jilipi is one of my favourite things in the world.
Surprisingly, the outside of the Malpoa was crunchy and soft in the inside. Normally Malpoas are entirely soft. But the taste was undoubtedly good.
Hot, cruncy and thin jilipi was just love!

Maharaj is a perfect place for satisfying your cravings for sweet dishes.It is a small and quite old joint which mostly remains crowded.We have tried Jalebis and Malpua from this place and believe us that they were amazing.The jalebis were hot and crispy and malpuas served were quite different from traditional malpua.

Situated in sarat bose road in deshpriya park area. Been here with some of my foodie friends to try their desi snacks. Small takeaway outlet. Ambience wasn't good but hospitality and service was good. Price was pocket friendly. I tried their malpua it was completely different from the one we usually consume. It was kachori shaped and very thick. Taste was average. And I tried their jalebi it was hot and sweet but still didn't impressed me much. Average experience Here.

If you are craving for street Jelibis and Singaras this is the right spot. Maharaj is an excellent maker of both. The crowd infront of it is itself the proof. I have tried their Singara and Jilebi both, and both of them are just fantastic. And yes their Mal poya, that was another best thing here.

If you're brave enough to wake up early and be around Deshapriya Park, chances are that this is one of the few places that are open at that hour. The sight of hot jalebis and kachoris and samosas will make your time drip. The uniqueness of this place however, I feel, lies in the Malpoa they make, which is quite unconventional. It's fluffy and filled with sweet syrup and too sweet even for people with a sweet tooth as mine. Pocket friendly and situated at a prime location, this is a good place for a quick bite.

If anyone visits this place, the name might look like a misnomer. Being a road side joint, please do not expect a royal setting, instead you shall experience the loyal customers of Maharaja flocking here. It is located very close to Deshapriya Park, just opposite Monalisa Guest House. Maharaja, even if it does not have a hifi restaurant look, it can easily beat big joints only through food. You can get proper Bengali breakfast here, and thats really amazing. Hing Kachori, Jalebi, Malpoa and Samosa are their speciality. I had hing kachori: these are fried on the spot, are piping hot and tasty, accompanied with a delicious aaloo ki sabzi. The malpoa are crispy from outside, but soft and juicy from inside. The jalebis can give bigshots run for their money, as they are simply brilliant. There is no seating arrangement, if you wanna have it on spot, you have to stand and eat, better pack and take the food. The service is fast, I mean super fast, and the staffs are friendly. They also accept PayTm. Maharaja is highly recommended for a good quality Bengali breakfast!!

Been visiting this place since I was a kid. The hing kachoris and gulab jamuns take the cake away.The chai is irresistible and so are the jalebis. With alternatives like Maharani and Sharma Sweets just 'round the corner, Maharaj still manages to pull in a huge crowd specially during early mornings. The best place to stuff yourself after a long walk by the Rabindra Saravor, this place is surely every foodie's delight.
While many might complain of the place being shabby & grimy, the occasional flies hovering over the unwashed plates by the side of the street, the constant honking, and the unsophisticated scruffily dressed boys serving the food, well,that's how my city is! And I love every bit of it...

A quaint little eatery just before the Deshapriya Park signal - Maharaja has been around for decades now. i have heard stories about this place from my father, and I myself have been here more than a couple of times. With moderate prices and a constantly turned on oven, the Hing kachuri with exceptionally well prepared alu sabzi, coupled with a hot jalebi or a few hot gulab jamuns is a perfect way to start your day. Although seating is not available, loyalists always find a place to sit down and enjoy the hotness of the kachuris with friends and loved ones. I would definitely take my own kids to this place, as I know that even after a few decades, this little eatery will still be there, with its usual glory, sweet aroma of the kachuris and its usual crowded nature. Thank you for so many good memories.

Since I had the excellent khasta kochuri from Putiram, my standards have been high and sadly, what I had at Maharaja wasn't crisp or soft or nice or anything like Putiram's. Even the aloo sabji and the out of season korai suti (peas) sabji was forgettable. The samosa and the sweet chutney were also just about okay. All of this makes me sad because Putiram is 10 km away from my house and Maharaja is so close. Clearly, long distance love is tough and for the love for kachoris, travel I must.

One of the more popular breakfast joints in Kolkata.. they have been at this location for over 17 years.. in an industry where new outlets open and old outlets shut almost on a daily basis, this is no mean feat.¬† Sees a lot of morning walker traffic from the Lakes (Southern Avenue).. Simple food, good taste and great prices.. As far as price is concerned, I don't understand why this page shows cost for two as Rs. 300/- I would peg cost for two at below Rs. 100/-

Maharaj is one of the popular food destinations to have quick bites. They are known for their snacks and has been serving quality food for years. 

Location: Its located in Deshapriya Park as you go from the crossing towards southern avenue. It will be on your right.

Experience: Well, I bet you cant dislike anything here. The kachori and sabzi is just outstanding. The big jalebis are just out of the world. And then they have their milk tea which is just one of the most popular things here.
Well if you are nearby and want to have some snacks there is no better option than this.

4/5 for this place.

I have a special corner for this place and always will. I love the special chai, i love the kachoris taking shape in the hot oil, i love the malpoa and most importantly i love the constantly buzzing energy around this place. The food is super fresh. Open from 6 in the morning and churning out hot, crisp kachoris till 10 at night, this place is no less than a well oiled machine. 

If you are anywhere near the area, you will spot the crowd surrounding it, from quite a distance. You must try the hing kachoris with their lovely alu ki sabzi. Do not forget to ask for the spiced mirchis.

Signature kochuri, jilipi and pantua, and sweet milk tea to wash it all down, that is what you will get here. The no nonsense, no frills snacks place is thronged by scores of people every morning for breakfast and every evening too. The chilli stuffed with masala, served with the savouries is a delight to have. The gulabjamuns or the pantuas are small, soft, warm and wonderful.

Hot kachoris, delicious sabjis, pickled chillies and sumptuous jalebis. This simple combo is bound to light up your day! Located at Deshapriya Park, this name is heard by all and popular among masses. It often becomes a hard choice whether to choose the 'King' over the 'Queen'. Personally, I like this one more. Their Samosas are also a hit ¬†here. If you come here, it won't matter if you are a wealthy person or a poor worker. People here are treated alike and everybody gets to enjoy the same food throughout!

Maharaj is quite a popular destination for quick snacks. 

**Location**
Located near desapriya park this place is easily find.

**Experience**
Their kochuri and sabzi is one of the best in the city. Also the jalebi along with that is a perfect combo with that. It is a place where I believe every class of the society comes in and enjoy thoroughly. Also the singara is also very interesting one with a cup of tea. 
A must visit place in that area.

The place is located right at the corner of the lane. Its very easy to locate with the ever booming crowd always surrounding it.¬†
The main attraction to this place are 4 things:
The Kachori Sabzi
Their tea
Samosa and
Finally their Jalebi

The Kachori Sabzi is great. Hot Kachoris are served with the Sabzi and some pickled chillies and if wanted they drizzle some Chatni over it.¬†
Their tea is really nice and soothing and is a major reason for the massive crowd it attracts.
Another nice thing is their Samosa served with Chatni. It has a good tasty filing and a thick outer layer.
A must try at this place is their crunchy, sweet, and tasty Jalebis. It has a lovely crunch and a sweet taste with a hint of tang to tingle your taste buds.

üòäüòäAfter Doing Morning Walk With My 2 Bua's And My Father Poonam Agarwal And Meena Gupta And Madhu Sudan Saraf From 5:15am - 6:15am. We Had Visited This Place Today For The 30th Time Since The Year 2008. Coming To Breakfast We Have Ordered 4 Special Milk Tea's For Just Rs. 6/- Each But It Was A Special Milk Tea That's Why 2 Rupees Extra Charge Means 8 Rupees Each For Special Milk Tea.üòÅüòÅ

Heavenly Kachoris, spicy Samosa, sinfully sweet Jalebis, Gulab Jamuns and Malpua - that is Maharaja in short for you. Open from breakfast till dinner, the small eatery has been popular since many many years and has always lured me big time. I cannot miss the delicious offerings for anything in the world and will go back for more and more.

The absolutely beautiful Kachuris and Aloor Torkari is the best thing about Maharaj. Located near Desapriya Park, it caters to almost every class of people in the city. This is possible only for the price they maintain. I see people coming by cars here for the kachoris and jalebis and also the workers grab on the same things. This is the magic of this place that they serve good things at a good price to everyone equally. You gotta try the Kachuri Aloor Torkari followed by some hot Jilipis. It's totally worth it. Happy Dining! :)

Oh what great joy it is to see this place here finally!!!! This place is my go to place for kochuri pangs. This place is very popular in the Desapriya Park area. It is located just beside Kathleen in Desapriya Park. I have been visiting this place frequently for the last five years. Sunday breakfast without the kachoris of 'Maharaj'  seems bland. Their kachoris are delicious. The sabji that they provide with it is spicy and delicious. Just the way I like it! They give masala chillis with the kachoris which acts as an addendum and make the dish more delicious. In addition to that I have tried their jalebis, malpoas etc. The jalebis are not like the Bengali jalebis, it has a unique taste of its own and it is toothsome to say the least. The malpoas are delectable and I kind of got addicted to it.Their tea is also good. If you are looking for ambience, you will not get any. Come here for the delicious food. I am visiting it right now as a matter of fact. :-)
