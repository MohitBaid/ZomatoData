Dropped at this cafe one evening, for light refreshments with friends. Its easy to locate, in the Pipal Tree enclave. Ira is a disappointment except the good decor. The decor is royally done with hues of blues and greys that would give you a warmth. We ordered some shakes and lattee. The nutty brownie shake had all except the nuts.(?) The mixed berry shake will take back you to childhood alpellibe memories. The lattee was fine. The cafe shows some stupid Zoom tv which might irritate you. The service is fairly disappointing. Oh they have fine dining cutlery, but its very over the top. Hospitality missing.

ATTENTION! Avoid this place like plague. The only saving grace, it always remains empty but their espresso machine NEVER WORKS. No wonder it remains empty.
 They offer black coffee which tastes like toilet water but charges you a price of a coffee. 
Basically they expect everyone to order expensive cocktails and don't give any attention to coffee customers. Don't be misled by the name. 
Today I called up on advance and they assured me that the coffee machine was working.
After going all the way I am told that it is not.
Never going back again. Never.

Stayed during Sept of this year for 2 days, BAD breakfast...even being in kolkata they can't have a tasty luchi-aalu sabji, nor even south indian idly is correct, nor dosa, nor sambar, nor continental...one of the worst breakfast ...avoid for breakfast...inefficient service with no pro activeness

On a rainy evening I wanted to have a cup of coffee and so headed to Ira as we were on the Rajarhat road. The ambiance is simple yet elegant. The upholstery is similar to Tamara and the wooden furniture adds elegance to the look and feel of the coffee shop. They provided us with both the drinks and food menu. As I was in the mood for coffee I thought of ordering the Ira special coffee. Alas! We were told that only normal coffee is available as the coffee vending machine was out of order. I mean... a coffee shop and you cannot serve coffee. A big thumbs down to that. Being a lazy bong I decided to stay back and eat instead. So we ordered a jalape√±o coriander cheese chilly toast and the chicken burger. I was impressed with both the look and presentation of the food. The quantity was equally good. Both the dishes were good enough and my stomach was full. My appetite satiated but the thirst for coffee made me order the regular coffee. Again the presentation was excellent and cookies were served along with it. The coffee was average and doesn't earn any extra points. The pocket pinch is not too much on the higher side. Quite affordable actually. But please ensure you have the coffee machine repaired soon.

A very soothing settlement amidst the bustle n hustle of Rajarhat Chinar Park. The unique see through window pane allows you to leisurely watch the sway of traffic while munching on #raspberrymuffin or a slice of #watermelon. The sumptuous breakfast spread included standard brioche buns, muffins, eags to order, puri-sabzi, fresh cuts of fruits, shakes and other hot and cold beverages. The food was standard. Stars of the show would certainly be the #chickensausage, #tossedpotatoes and surely the #raspberrymuffin. The sausage looks standardly delicious but the moment you take a bite it gives you a BANG! The intelligent use of honey, chilli flakes, paprika cooked in the sausage fat itself elevates your morning. It is cooked to the T for breakfast as well as brunch. Boiled potatoes tossed in a little butter,parsley and condiments after boiling leaves a light and mellowy taste in your buds. And @Oh yes, the muffin...raspberry muffin..baked beautifully..perfect breakfast companion..Period.

Can be better with an inclusion of cold cuts of meat and yes probably a cheese platter. Well behaved staffs are an added bonus you get.Recommended for a moderately happy experience without burning a hole in pocket. Try little/nearby appsüòâ

Went to this place for breakfast with my friends. They got us seated in Tamara, which is the Pipal Tree's renowned restaurant. They have a buffet arranged for breakfast with both veg and non veg offerings. The buffet table was tidily and neatly arranged. Bread toast, butter, varieties of cheese, baked beans, sauteed veggies, dosa, uttapam, poha, noodles, boiled eggs, chicken sausages, yogurt, cereals, hot n cold milk, tea, coffee, juices, smoothies, they had it well incorporated into a well managed buffet. Service was fast and impressive. Had a great breakfast.

Sorry for the messy pictures and also i forgot to take the picture of dosa
But the thing is we kinda reached a bit late for the breakfast and so we had to eat fast üòÖüòÖ
The place is just like tamara, well since its the same branch,same place üòä
So ambience is good, staff is great.
The food is great too but since i couldn't taste all, so can't tell you about everything.
The juice and the starting muffin and croissants are good
The pork sausage is to die for and the chowmein was good too üòÉ
Even the masala dosa was great.

A small cafe, part of the hotel. They have a quirky decor set up. The food served was surprisingly good and filling. We had a group on voucher, and we redeemed it. They have limited seating arrangements. they had just one person manning the area which spoke about the place's popularity.

Ira is a high end cafe with a bakery in pipal tree. Not very spacious but well decorated and they actually have a live fish on the table in a little glass jar. I personally did not like the concept- firstly because you can smell the fish and secondly it looked torturous. Innovative but not impressive.

Coming to their food : we had ordered for a masala and a butter masala dosa. The dosas were good but the alu masala lacked taste. Their sambhar was nice and they served a tomato garlic chutney which again was very average in taste. 

Price is steep. Rs500 for two average tasting dosa.

I came to know about Ira Lifestyle Cafe during recent South Indian Food Festival in City Center 2 where they have setup a stall. We tried Malabar Paratha which was very good in taste. Later we went to their restaurant in the Pipal Tree Hotel building. Restaurant is not very big in size but its enough to feel comfortable. Ambiance is good and waiters are dressed in South Indian attire. 

We were served complimentary Rasam but only after receiving the food. Ideally Rasam should be served just after arrival as I have seen in other South Indian restaurants in Delhi. Rasam taste was good but we could not enjoy fully as our Dosas had already arrived by then.

We ordered different types of Dosas and all were good in taste. Sambhar could be improved. We were served extra Chutney and Sambhar whenever asked by us. 

Overall it was a good experience to eat there. It's good to have such restaurants in the nearby area of Newtown.

Providing some sparkle at the edge of Rajarhat area is popular-bistro, Ira Cafe. Formerly they were famous for their continental breakfast and Mexican food, but they newly-added wide range of South Indian gastronomy at affordable price. Pipal Tree‚Äôs Ira Lifestyle Cafe is the perfect spot to seek respite from the madding crowd and treat yourself with an unhurried, south Indian meal!

After hearing a lot about their popular south Indian dishes from my friends in Rajarhat area I decided to give them a visit. At a glance this place does not look like a traditional south Indian restaurant but after entering you will definitely get the feel. Waiters are all dressed like south Indian and welcomes you in traditional way.

I had come here little bit early for evening snacks, as my friend informed me it‚Äôs become crowded in late evening. Without wasting much time I ordered ‚ÄòPaneer Butter Masala Dosa‚Äô, ‚ÄòIra Special Thali‚Äô and ‚ÄòDegree Coffee‚Äô. What's notable is that Ira Cafe also serves wide range of delicious cakes and pastries.

I got served a complementary ‚ÄòRasam‚Äô in an earthen pot to begin with. It was a popular South Indian soup, traditionally prepared using tamarind juice as a base, with the addition of tomato, chili pepper, pepper, cumin and other spices as seasonings. The pepper & cumin were great compliment to the warm soup, and the flavour of different spices work surprisingly well together.

Next item was their signature Paneer Butter Masala Dosa and it was amazingly tasty. Paneer butter masala dosa had a nice crispy contrast to the soft spicy paneer. I loved both red chilli chutney & coconut chutney. The crispy dosa with zesty and flavourful paneer filling along with the chutney dips, altogether melting in your mouth gives a fabulous feeling. The samber, was also excellent, it was spicy as it should be and the thickness of the curry was optimal. Paneer butter masala dosa was huge for one person but still you wouldn't want to share this.

Their Ira Special Thali was item and quantity wise massive, even I got little bit surprised, perfect combinations of taste & flavours. The thali consists of two kind of rice, one roti/paratha, two kinds of dry veggies, two veggie curry, one paneer item, two soupy curries, curd, fried papad, pickles, salad and one type of sweet dish, it‚Äôs a one order finish your dinner kind of dish. This might just be one of the best South Indian Thali you will find in Rajarhat area and it really hits the spot with mixture of different texture and flavour.

On the coffee front, Ira Cafe offers artisanal coffee blends -- from espresso to their own special house blend. But do not leave without trying out their Degree Coffee ‚Äî a south Indian filter coffee, it was perfect to finish this south Indian treat! One sip and you will definitely feel refreshed.

Go and try some south Indian delicacy that people are going gaga for, a new spot for fresh, healthy cuisine by the good people behind Tamara, and it's sure to satisfy veg lovers. Opt for their reasonably-priced Dosas and Thali for a fuss-free and satisfying meal. Best part is, Ira Cafe opens seven days a week!

Its been a long time that we have been craving for good decent south indian food. Not the rock hard idlis and sad excuse for sambhar that most places dish out this part of town and we werent ready to travel double digit kms to find some! Reviews on zomato and word of mouth finally landed us  at Ira on a wet lazy sunday afternoon. It was a good decision for sure. Quite an unlikely place that we would find down south goodies bt needless to say we hogged our hearts out, including my toddler. Started off with one vada sambhar and one idli rasam, generous 3 pieces of each per serving and unltd sambhar/rasam. Ordered a butter cheese dosa for the kiddo which he loved. We followed it up with a south indian thali for him and an appam stew for me. The thali was a lot of food to finish... but yummy, and my appam stew was amazing and authentic. Oh also while i waited for the main course to arrive, their very gracious server offered unlimited rasam in a glass to bide time, much needed because i was coming down with a cold. We finished off the meal with filter coffee because it was tea time by the time we managed to finish our meal. A perfect place to go with family and extended family, vfm and great variety. Next time we shall try catching bfast, heard they have better stuff with more variety then. Ps. After that episode of gluttony im skipping dinner!

Wow.. wow.. wow..

Best South Indian in Kolkata, till date! The first thing which you get is little 30 ml shots of Rasam.. which are on the house and after that awesome food! 
The best thing about Ira is the absolutely gorgeous and tasty food! No frills ambiance which is actually soothing.. no nonsense... just good food. A must have is their Thali. Everything is scrumptious and tastes different.. only let down was the buttermilk, which tasted like thick curd mixed with mustard. The actual south Indian buttermilk with curry leaves, ginger and mustard seeds would be appreciated! 
Prices are a little steep for good old south indian food.. but the food is worth every penny..
Try Ira, you wot regret it.
