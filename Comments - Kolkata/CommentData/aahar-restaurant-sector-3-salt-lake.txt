Worst service. Actually they harrased us a lot. The EC market outlet said there's no Tikiya, and over phone the FD park outlet confirmed the order,then when we reached there the stuff behaved rudely and one of them misguided us,and told us to return to EC outlet. 
The stuff are just very rude. And this outlet is situated on a public toilet. Please never visit this outlet.

Went for a small lunch today with friends. The inside decor and feel can be categorised as not too goid nor bad. Not a big dining area to be true. What we ordered was Chicken Biryani and quality of the same was good. A good place to drop by and have a quick lunch or meal.

A restaurant above a public toilet - Aahar has come up with a new concept . We the people of Salt Lake have been visiting outlets of Aahar for quite sometime but this is simply an unique idea . No doubt this outlet has a prime location - near FD Park & Bidhannagar Municipality , also walking distance from City Centre but wish they had chosen a nearby place than the present one . Food wise & price wise it's the same Aahar offering good value for money but ambiance wise it's zero or even negative . Better to visit the original outlet at EC Market just a few meters away .

The original store is housed in the nearby ec market. Being a localite the name conjures fond childhood memories when parents would be too tired to cook and we would all order takeout from aahar. Fastforward 15 years and this place is nothing like it used to be. The biryani tastes more of dalda than anything else. You can practically taste synthetic flavours. The meat looks more like roadkill and sometimes doesnt even resemble chicken. Moreover now that they are more interested in expanding rather than serving quality food, their choice of locations for new outlets, such as this one is as good as the food they serve here. Honest opinion? Choose the original outlet which is 100ms away. Dont come here

I have been ordering and/or visiting the branch/es at EC Market, Salt Lake for the last 12-13 years now and have tried almost all of their products. Some of the old people working here still recollects my face, and hence I have no issue here, when it comes to service. But then, I absolutely humor the idea of the very person who decided to open a restaurant offering dining spaces at a place which is situated just above a 'Sulabh Complex'.

For the uninitiated, please google on what the above phrase might actually mean. Am not sure, how people would even have the courage to drop by here. Well, once I did and ordered for some Chinese cuisine. The food was decent, but the pricing for their Chinese cuisine do not match the quality they deliver. The pricing margin between them and Chowman isn't that demarcating anymore.

Lyton - very well done in setting this chain up. The food is still how it used to be 15 years back. 

Love the biryani, tikka and it has the best momo in salt lake

I have visited all Aahar restaurant outlet located at Salt lake n all are awesome. So m surprised to see there is no review yet. Why no1 cares to visit this awesome food junction at d heart of Salt lake??
Very good taste,pocket friendly,waiters were very cordial n amazingly managing d costumers waiting outside n dining inside d restaurant at new year night cz it is a small food junction. I m rating them 10 on 10 for their quality n quantity of food. 
We ordered chicken sweet n sour soup,chicken reshmi kebab for starters n in d main course we took mixed fried rice,chicken Manchurian fish n peas polao. Taste n quantity is very good I must say. 
Strongly recommended.
