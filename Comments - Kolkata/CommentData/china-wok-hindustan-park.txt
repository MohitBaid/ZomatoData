A very small joint on the Purna Das Road...The ground floor hosts their kitchen and a small wooden staircase leading to a rather small eating area ehich can house about 10 to 12 people at the max..
People working there are way too courteous and very attentive..
Now coming to the food, its simply lip-smacking...extremely good...food is devoid of plenty of spices and just had a subtle heavenly taste...actually we were hungry and might be that did the trick...but if u want to have good chinese at a very reasonable price this place is a must try...quantity they serve suffices 2 persons..

So this is one of those small Asian places that leaves you wanting to come back again. I've been here 4-5 times and have always been pleased. The place is small and cannot accommodate too many people, and there is a rather uncomfortable staircase leading up to the eating area. But the food makes up for it and how! So does the service. The staff is very polite and efficient. I especially like the Eight Treasure Soup and the salt and spicy crispy fish(an absolute delight!). Besides, the prices are pretty reasonable and inclusive of all taxes. 

So, for a  cozy Asian meal, for a small group of people, this place is ideal, right on the road! I would definitely recommend China Wok! :)

Me and my mom went for shopping around Gariahat so for lunch tried this relatively new place in the vicinity. The place is small with only 4 tables but the decor is nice. The menu is an exhaustive list of Chinese and Thai cuisine. We ordered eight treasure soup with chicken, prawn steamed wantons and crispy fish pepper garlic. The soup came first.. the quantity was huge and the taste and flavour was so good that we enjoyed a lot having it. Then came the fish starter and it was crispy and delectable at the same time. The pepper and garlic was well balanced in the dish. Recommended. Then finally the wontons arrived and my god, they were so yummy..tossed in a ginger soy dressing..loved every bite of it. We were full by the time so ordered a mixed chili garlic noodles for take away. Bill came upto 900 rs and i would say its worth it given the quality and quantity. Service was very good constantly taking feedback for the dishes served. Will come again to try other items in the menu.

There is no bigger love than the love for food. And it becomes even better if you share it with people who love food as much as you do. 

Our team of Munching Monks were privileged to have been invited for a Food Trial session for their new menu which is to be available soon. China Wok is a compact but pleasant place located at Purna Das road, walking distance from Triangular Park. The lighting is generous and the staff is courteous. With a beautiful glass wall overlooking the road you can enjoy a sumptuous Chinese meal. 

New on the menu are :

Chicken Coriander and Mushroom Soup: It was a healthy and well seasoned soup with substantial amount of coriander leaves, chicken bits, mushroom pieces and egg drops. There were shredded cabbage and carrots to enhance the taste. You'd sure be prepared for the delicious meal that is about to follow with this soup.

Chicken Wings in Asian Barbequed Sauce: Highly appetizing soft chicken drumsticks tossed in Asian Barbeque sauce. They were tangy and spicy and everything you'd want in your Chicken Wings. 

Sliced Korean Bulgogi: Korean is an all time favourite cuisine for most of us. This beautiful dish with diced chicken tossed in Bulgogi glaze, fresh chillies, carrots, scallions and sesame seeds will not disappoint. They are mouth as good looking as they taste, too. 

Japanese Teriyaki Pork: This dish has become my personal favourite, and I'm sure to hog on to this place for more of these. Juicy pieces of succulent pork tossed in Teriyaki sauce with bird's eye chilli and sesame were a joy to behold. They were delectable in taste and absolutely gorgeous looking. 

Coming to the main course,

Leang's Rice: This is a coriander and basil flavoured fried rice with burnt garlic and eggs. It's light on your tummy and very healthy. Though it tasted a little bland and could have done with a little more seasoning, yet when paired with the side dishes they provided, they were delicious as it is. 

Five Spicy Fish Curry: Not a huge fan of fish, but if you give me this dish I'll have it in one go, no questions asked. The fish is extremely soft and tender and melts in your mouth, once you've bit into the slightly crunchy, spicy, tangy crust. Tossed in House special Five-Spice sauce, this is the best fish dish I've ever tasted.

Bangkok Street Vender's Stir Fried Chicken with Cashewnuts: An authentic recipe straight from the streets of Thailand, the dish has substantial portions of chicken cooked in oyster sauce and a generous helping of cashewnuts. It was a little bland in taste, but went well with the noodles.

Chilli Garlic Noodles: The noodles were perfectly cooked. They were authentic Italian spaghetti which did not stick to one another, that is something you don't usually find in Kolkata Chinese restaurants. It was a little spicy, so watch out if you're not a fan of the heat. The hit of garlic you get after a mouthful is enough to soothe your tastebuds for the rest of the day.

For dessert, Vanilla Icecream with Toffeed Cashewnuts: After so much pampering of your tastebuds, you'll need to cool it off and nothing better to do that with than this dessert. The icecream was smooth and creamy and the cashewnuts were the metaphorical cherry on top. They were caramelized with some extra caramel diffusing into the icecream which made it sweeter and more gooey than it already was. 

The dishes are available in the restaurant from December 21, 2017. So mark your dates and call on the place for a hit of authentic Chinese and Thai dishes.

While shopping around this area me and my friend just casually decided to have something to fill our empty stomach. So we walked into this small little place situated just around the corner of triangular park. Its a small restaurant allowing sitting area for about 10-12 people. The restaurant is on a level up and the ground floor is the kitchen. We were not in a mood to have dinner so we ordered starters - one of sweet and spicy crispy chicken and one of spicy garlic pepper crispy fish. I really am overwhelmed to say that both the dishes were super tasty and thw quantity was even more than enough for 2. Overall very satisfied and will definitely come back for a full course dinner. Cheers!!!

Life is all about having good food and meeting good people. Well, I had both the experiences today. 

We, Team #MunchingMonks visited China Wok today at 1 p.m. for a pre-arranged exclusive tasting. 

Sounds interesting? Well, the food was even more interesting. 

China Wok, invited us, to try out their new menu. The below-mentioned menu will be available for the foodies from the 21st of the upcoming month. So, here is an upfront review for you guys, to read and decide, which ones you want to have once they are made available for all.

~ THE MENU ~

Chicken Coriander and Mushroom Soup - A refreshing soup, to start your course meal with. Besides, chicken, coriander and mushroom, it also contains cabbage and shredded carrots.

Chicken Wings in Asian Barbequed Sauce - 6 pieces of lip-smacking chicken wings with barbeque sauce. The wings were well marinated as well as perfectly soaked in the sauce, thus giving the absolute taste.

Japanese Teriyaki Pork - Well, Pork is Love. And when it is combined with teriyaki sauce, it is 2x Love. The pork was well roasted, and the amount of honey added was adequate to give it that sticky yet tasty form.

Sliced Korean Bulgogi - Being a big Korean fan, I was looking forward to this dish the most. And it didn't disappoint me at all. Sliced chicken in Korean Bulgogi glaze with sesame stuck to it was just WOW.

Leang's Rice - It is a type of fried rice, that had coriander, basil, and burnt garlic. The rice was kind of okayish. When paired with the side dishes it acted as a good main. The amount of rice provided is perfect for 2 servings. 

Chili Garlic Noodles - As the name suggests it is hot and spicy. So, if you are not very good with spicy dishes, you should consider it twice before ordering. But at the same time, being a spicy food lover, I must say, it surely awakens your taste buds. 

Bangkok Stir-Fried Chicken with Cashewnuts - The shredded chicken was cooked in the oyster sauce along with capsicum and onion to give a good taste. The presence of cashew makes it a mild dish and thus is recommended for those who want to compensate the over spiciness of the chili garlic noodles.

Five Spice Fish Curry - The fish just melts in your mouth. I have had many fish dishes and this is probably one of the best. The gravy is nothing extraordinary but the fish pieces are AMAZING. The moment you cut it, you realize how soft and succulent they are.

Vanilla Icecream with Toffeed Cashewnuts - 1 scoop of vanilla ice cream with few pieces of caramelized cashew nuts and a tablespoon of caramel spread over the ice cream is heaven. The moment you put a spoonful in your mouth, a slight smile appears on your face. This simple combination of ice-cream and caramelized cashew served as a refreshing ending to the full meal.

Overall we had a great experience and would highly recommend the place.

So, mark the date, and do visit China Wok once the new menu is launched. For I am sure, you don't want to miss these tasty dishes.

Personally if my wishlist is ever given preference.. I would always choose CHINESE CUISINE first , coz it never makes me feel bored! Haha!!
So, the viewers of my review have already got a faster portrayal of my choices!
Here come to the main discussion! CHINA WOK was always in my bucket list as I heard about its quality of food many times and my wish got fulfilled this time!

DIRECTION : if you prefer metro transport system.. then kalighat metro station is preferable..nd then catch a bus or cab to reach TRIANGULAR PARK . 3 mins walk from there will make u reach to your destination !

AMBIENCE : it is a tiny hidden gem! As u can see in the pic..it is well decorated and air conditioned!

FOOD : here comes the main thing ... FOOD!
We took crispy chilli baby corn as starter ...and it didnt disappoint me...!
Next we took 1 chicken hakka noodles..chicken fried rice,kung pao chicken and pla gra tiem which is a thai dish!
Every platter was plausible ...😍
Less oily and much in quantity!
Kung pao chicken consisted of 10 small pieces ! There were bit dry fruits,capsicum and bell pepper mixed with it ...these all made a different flavour, it wasn't that spicy but very tasty!
The thai dish pla gra tiem was actually a fish platter...it had the flavor of lemon grass leaf which gave a different taste and i liked it! It was less spicy!

At last we took choco brownie as dessert ...it was good bt the brownie was bit tighter! Bt over all it was delicious to taste!

QUALITY AND QUANTITY : if u r Chinese cuisine lover... u should try it for once atleast..! The quantity they gave...it was more than for two actually and the quality is upto the mark!I really mean it!

SERVICE : The staffs are so prudent and they cooperated in every way they could! It took hardly 7mins to get the ordered food served nicely in our table!

This restaurant is recommendable! The prices are pocket friendly !
P.s - 5% gst is applicable here on each dish u order!

Food could be better and may feel a bit overpriced. The staff are extremely well behaved and helpful. The quality of the chicken is good. Shrimps used are also fresh and well cooked. However it may be a tad bit pricey for the food they make. But that won't make a lot of difference. Pretty good a restaurant for people looking for a nice ambience with quality food.

A small cosy place to dine with your friends and family. China Wok , located just beside the Triangular Park is the best Chinese and Thai restaurant I came across. They have lots of variety in their menu.


Starters like  - 
Tom yum soup veg, Spicy Lemon broth veg and chicken - I guess we all have tasted soups before but what makes China wok different is their distinctive taste of lemon grass. I personally liked it.

Bangkok crispy noodle salad with Kaffir lime - 
And one good thing about their staters is that they know how to experiment. Like have you heard something called noodle salads before???? Well China Wok is actually making them exceptionally well. The sweet crispy texture of the noodles along with small chunks of tomatoes and onions is perfectly fine to start your day.

Other Starters you can try -
Asian barbequed chicken wings, Red pepper chicken, Thai chilli potatoes -these we equally good in taste. 


Main course be like - 
 Exotic vegetables in black pepper and Basil sauce, Stir fried chicken with soy and cashew nuts, Chilli basil fish with bird's eye chilli,China Wok Signature rice.


On the dessert section you can try the Toffeed cashew nuts with vanilla ice cream and Darsaan with ice cream. The first one is mainly two vanilla ice cream with roasted cashews and with the base being caramelized with toffees and the later is mainly two scoops of vanilla ice cream served with Wonton cheese. 

I had a lovely experience dining at China wok along with my fellow bloggers.

I am sure your visit will be worth a million times. Happy eating folks.

China wok, as the name suggests, offers scrumptious  cuisines to satisfy your Chinese and Thai cravings. This restaurant is located at  Hindustan Park among many other restaurants spread all over this posh locality. You enter this restaurant and you will be guided upstairs where there's a sitting arrangement which can accommodate comfortably around 12-14 people with a glass window view to the main road. 
Team PanchPhoron was invited here to try out there new menu launch. We were served a wide variety of dishes from appetizer to deserts -  they were delectable and worth trying again and again! I would like to mention each and every item served on the table 
° Spicy veg lemon broth soup - with the touch of the refreshing flavour of lime leaves and lemon grass, absolutely soothing and appetizing! 
° Bangkok crispy noodle salad with Kafir lime - something new indeed! Noodle salad after all! Crunchy, tangy, spicy. 
° Thai chilli potatoes - from the moment they appeared on the table, my taste buds couldn't wait to taste them. Perfectly cooked potato slices, smeared with herbs and spices,  won my heart totally! 
° Exotic vegetables in black pepper and Basil sauce - a great concomitant with noodles or schezwan rice, vegetables tossed in thick spicy gravy, I can vouch for its lingering taste long after you are finished savouring it. 
° China wok signature rice - Green tinted nicely prepared rice, something exotic in their new menu because it bears the restaurant's name, with shredded egg scrambled, goes great with the gravy accompaniment mentioned above.
° Chilli Garlic noodles - not exaggerating,  but I have to admit, I have tasted such amazing flavoured garlic noodles at very few places, and China Wok is one amongst them. 
° Toffee cashew nuts with vanilla ice cream - Heavenly! That's what is called sinful indulgence.
°Darsan with ice cream- Do I need to say more? Everyone's favourite! Isn't it? 

I highly recommend everyone to give this place a visit and try out as many items on menu as possible. Thumbs up for China Wok. :)

I had been to this place today. This one's truly a hidden gem. I had taken a fish with sweet chilly sauce and garlic which was simply amazing. The spiciness balanced perfectly with the sweetness along with soft basa fish and mildly crunchy outer coating made the dish a phenomenal one. This is a must try here, dear foodies. As for the main course I had taken a vegetable fried rice and chicken with mushrooms in black bean sauce. There's nothing much to mention about the former except that it itself tasted very nice. As for the latter it was a less spicy dish with mushrooms, black beans and shredded chicken- a very safe option for people who don't prefer spicy.
And finally ending the sumptuous meal with darsaan tossed in honey and sesame served with two blocks of vanilla ice cream. The only minus point with this one in my case was that I found a few neem leaves along with it which was quite absurd.
Apart from this the service is really warm.
And another mentionable point is the food was served fresh, hot prepared with time after I placed the order.
So do visit this place foodies , to treat your taste buds with some delicious Chinese and Thai food.💛

Would have given a rating of 4..the ambience brought the score down a bit....a 1 and a half floor restaurant with the seating arrangement on the too floor..the stairway to this place seemed rickety and too narrow....the food was good...noodles and soup seemed palatable...and okay...service is fine...payment needs to be done via cash only...also the space is quite cramped...the place is air continioned...with a window view of the street outside...not bad...okay for lunch or casual eating...not desirable enough for repeated visit..

The heart pleasing visit to China Wok. 

This place will impress everyone with their heart winning culinary skills. Visited here one fine afternoon for a lunch session, the place is easy to locate. The place is compact but the interiors are done matching to the place and it is really soothing.  It is a 2 storey building; the ground floor being the take away counter and kitchen, and the first floor arranged for dining in which can accommodate almost 16 people.
                                                                ...

A visit to China Wok at Hindustan Park with our team of #MunchingMonks were great and their quality of food and hospitality surprised us in every way possible.

Ambiance :
=========
They really have a very small place to do something but still they’ve utilised every bit of this place. Kitchen and take away counter is on ground floor and dining is on the first floor with sitings of 16 people. That may seem cozy but inside it felt quite comfortable to us. From the textured white wall of ground floor to the dining its nicely decorated with Chinese quotes frames on wall to give this place a feel of Asian cuisines.

Staffs and Management :
=====================
Their staffs are always curios to help and serve better. Their service is quite fast too. Management gets thumps up for maintaining this place well.

Soups :
=========
Spicy Coriander Soup with Garden Vegetables (4/5) :
---------------------------------------------------------
This green soup with green leafs and small diced chicken pieces looked very good. Taste wise it was a nice option to start and I think healthier option too.

Eight Treasure Soup (4/5) :
-------------------------------
It was a coriander chilli flavoured soup with spinach, carrot, corn and mushroom all small diced and well mixed with lite spices. Because of all this vegetables and minced chicken its eight treasure and it tasted quite good.

Starters :
=========
Prik Kai Sot Sai Thod (4.5/5) :
---------------------------------
Described as Chicken wings tossed in Thai Sweet Chilli Sauce with fresh red chillies and kaffir lime it was simply a tongue twister. Basically it was chicken lollipops tossed in spicy Thai sauce that just tasted so different than normal chicken lollipops. With its own kind of flavour it tasted just amazing and it was a perfect dish to start the food journey over here.

Crispy Fish Garlic Pepper (4/5) :
-----------------------------------
Crispy fish tossed in Fresh ground black pepper and Asian cooking wine. Crispy fried soft Basa fish with black pepper is always mouth watering and with added flavour of wine it is much better. Perfectly cooked and another perfect starter.

Hua Hin Highway Rolls (4/5) :
---------------------------------
Described as Mini crispy rolls stuffed with vermicelli, lemongrass and vegetables. It was a new standard of small rolls. Crispy layer outside that felt crunchy in mouth & in between small chicken pieces with special spices tasted too good & authentic. Another recommended dish.

Mains :
=========
Rice and Noodles :
--------------------------------
Wok Tossed Hakka Noodles (Chicken) (3.5/5) :
-------------------------------------------------
Chicken Noodles is must when taking about Chinese main dishes. Very nicely made noodles with mixed minced chicken pieces, julienne cut vegetables and ordinary spices. Just perfect to enjoy with chopsticks.

Schezwan Fried Rice (Egg) (3.75/5) :
---------------------------------------
It was stir fried rice with schezwan sauce, burnt garlic and peppers and its the most common order of every Chinese restaurant. That is why they made it with perfection to impress us and show that they can make it better too. It wasn’t extremely hot and spicy but it was just perfectly balanced so that it can be enjoying with side dishes. Taste of smoky burned garlic and pepper adds Thai touch to it.

Pla Pad Kraprow (4/5) :
--------------------------
Described as Sliced fish in Thai chilli basil sauce with fresh red chillies. No asian dishes complete without one perfect fish dish. Red chillis , basil leafs, Thai sauce all mixed together with soft well cooked Basa fish tasted really good.

Beijing's Old Market Chicken (4/5) :
---------------------------------------
Stir Fried Chicken finished with chilli oyster sauce, vegetables and roasted cashew nuts. It was kind of new to taste that tasted very balanced and sweet. Oyster sauce gravy and vegetables felt good with rice. Roasted brown textured cashew felt good in mouth.

Roasted Pork with Baby Bok Choy (4.25/5) :
----------------------------------------------
Now this dish wasn’t planned but after having their other dishes we couldn’t stop ourself from testing one pork dish too. Undoubtedly just like other dishes they have made it with perfection that tasted too good. Although this dish is a starter still we took it with mains because we wanted something dry. And it was the perfect combination of roasted pork with oyster sauce. Touch of wine and black pepper felt amazing with it.

Desserts :
=========
Darsaan with Ice Cream (4/5) :
----------------------------------
Chinese meal doesn’t complete without a desert like Darsaan. With 2 vanilla scoops their sweet and crispy Darsaan was must needed for us to finish it.

 Pricing :
=========
Compared to other Asian cuisines this place is reasonably priced and food quality is very satisfying for the price.

Conclusion :
==========
If you are bored with same kind of Chinese food and its taste then you must visit China Wok to give your tastebuds a different feel of Chinese and Thai dishes.

Do you know the fact that an ant carry more weight than its own weight? Yes, some fact like this proves that small things also have its own beauty! But when it comes about dining in Restaurant, People usually likes to go to the highly popular restro ignoring the small ones, but Boss you are in Kolkata and you hardly know, from where the surprise may come from!
 So let's come and open this surprise box.

Visited this restaurant few days ago with bunch of my friends for a get together. The restaurant located at the Purna Das Road, near Triangular Park. Not a hard thing to find it out.

Now come to the review part –

* Positive Points –

1.	Great Food – The restaurant serves some really finger licking Pan Asian cuisine. Was not expecting such quality but they really fulfill my demand for taste.

2.	Courteous Stuffs – Good food need good stuffs to maintain the level outside of the table. Yes, the stuffs were really courteous and ready to help you anytime.

3.	Pricing & Quantity – Decent pricing of each items is really a blessing for everyone. According to their taste and quality, I must say the restaurant is really Value for Money.

* Negative Points –

Except the small spacing inside the restaurant, I hardly found any negative points here. The place can accommodate max 16 persons at a time with minimum legroom.

We ordered –

* Soups –

1.	Spicy Coriander Chicken Soup with garden vegetables (4.0/5.0) – Sounds like spicy but not really in nature. Shredded fine chopped chicken pieces with thick gravy of Coriander was really awesome. Little tangy in nature. Just add some pepper, and you are ready to Gulp. :D

2.	Eight Treasure Chicken Soup (4.5/5.0) – Where is the treasure hiding? It is hiding in the bowl. Another thick soup, quite different from the first one. Chicken pieces were perfectly mixed some colorful veggies. Love it.

* Starter – 

1.	Hua Hin Highway Chicken Rolls (3.5/4.0) – Small sized crispy roll with mixture of chicken, vermicelli, lemongrass & veggies inside. The roll somehow feels like mini spring roll to me. Overall good.

2.	Prik Kai Sot Sai Thod (4.5/5.0) – The dish may seems like Chicken Lollypop, but the item was far more interesting unlike its name. Chicken wings were deep starred with sweet chili sauce & red chilis and this add some real rich flavor in it. Having it in hot condition, it tastes like heavenly.

3.	Crispy Fish Garlic Pepper (4.0/5.0) – Crispy fried fish were well tossed in fresh ground black pepper and with Asian cooking wine. The wine touch was outstanding and the mild flavor of fish will surely attract you.

* Side Dish – 

1.	Pia Pad Kraprow – This is a Thai cuisine where the fish were cooked in a Chilli sauce and the Basil leaf touch add the Pan Asian flavor into the dish. Goes excellent with Rice or noodles.

2.	Beijing's Old Market Chicken – Another chicken side dish, cooked with dry fruits. The chicken pieces were cooked with Chilli Oyster Sauce and veggies. Little bit of sweet in nature.

* Rice & Noodles –

1.	Wok Tossed Chicken Hakka Noodles – Normal Hakka chow, as we get in normal Chinese Restaurant. Quantity was good and enough for two persons.

2.	Schezwan Egg Fried Rice – Normal rice with Schezwan touch in it. Little bit of spicy in nature, due to presence of burnt garlic & Peppers but taste wise really wonderful. Taste wise good and quantity wise too.

* Desserts –

Darsaan with Ice Cream -  Honey fried noodles were served with two scopes of vanilla Ice Cream. One of the best Darsaan I’ve ever done. 

So in conclusion, I’ll say China Wok is one of the best Pocket friendly restaurant in its area. Diwali is coming, so have a blast and have good food at China Wok @ affordable price. Overall a great dining experiences.

Went here with couple of my friends after some hectic pandal hopping for lunch . Clean and fairly good ambience with lot of natural light . Very little space though , the staff were constantly dropping stuff . We ordered Drums of Heaven and Pan fry fish as starters . The Drums of Heaven was indeed little chicken pieces of Heaven . Sweet and tangy . The pan fry fish was okayish nothing special . Then we ordered Burnt Ginger rice and Chicken in Hot Garlic sauce and Chicken in Sweet and Sour . The rice was disappointing with very little to no pieces of chicken or egg and tasted bland . The chicken gravy dishes were good . The staff were constantly in hurry and telling speed up with eating which was completely shocking . Have no plan to visit again at all ..

I am glad to have found this a hidden gem. It serves amazing oriental cuisines. It is truly a delight to all chinese cuisine lovers. It is a small little place situated near Gariahat Triangular Park. Has 2 sections, the first floor mainly comprising of the kitchen area and the second floor has a dine in area with tables. The table we sat on we were able to overlook upon the street. The place is pretty well lit up and has a few quote-based posters.

So glad that i found this gem of an oriental  restaurant at South kolkata that offers such good dishes at an amazingly affordable price.
LOCATION: Take the lane beside triangular park (the one opposite to City Style shop), go straight and take the first left and you would reach your destination.
INTERIORS: A tiny yet compact two storeyed restaurant, of which the ground floor comprises the billing counter and the kitchen while the first floor has the well organised seating area. Small in size but still enough to accommodate 10-15 people at a time.
FOOD: It has a wide variety of Oriental dishes; something to suit everyone's palate.
The puja special menu and the dishes i had there are: 
1. Starter:
▪ Coriander chicken soup: coriander flavoured thick soup with Asian wine, shredded chicken and green chillies.
▪ Prik Kai Sot Sai Thod: Chicken wings tossed with Thai sweet chilli, kaffir lime and lemon zest.
▪ Fish Taipei: sliced fish tossed with scallions, chillies and Asian wine.

2. Main Course: 
▪ Kai Gra Tiem : sliced chicken tossed in black pepper and basil sauce
▪ Pla Pad Pak: an authentic recipe served with assorted vegetables, oyster sauce and mushrooms.
▪ Khao Pad Kratiem: Thai smoked oil and burnt garlic rice
▪ chilli garlic noodles: hakka noodles tossed in green chillies and sauteed garlic
▪ Roasted Chilli pork: fat free succulent roasted pork slices tossed in soy & chilli sauce.
3. Dessert: 
▪ Ice cream sandwich: vanilla bean ice cream deep frozen between chocolate biscuits and served with chocolate sauce

The food totally won me over!! Each one of these are highly recommended!! A must try.

Thanks to the owners, for the generous invitation.
Thanks

Who can say no to a stint with the Chinese and Thai during Puja days?? It's soothing and light and utterly delicious. Very easy on your stomach. And the best place to sample some of those glorious dishes is this hidden gem in the bylanes of Triangular Park. We were invited to sample their Puja Special menu on a foodie's meet and were warmly hosted by Mr. Varun Rajgaria and Mrs. Shruti. Here are some of the dishes we tasted. 
Starters:
√Chicken Coriander Soup- Coriander flavoured hot thick soup with Asian wine and green chillies. The warmth of the soup took us to a different place altogether. 
√Prik Kai Sot Sai Thod- Chicken wings tossed with thai sweet chilli, kafir lime and lime zest. This was absolutely lipsmacking with a hint of underlying spiciness. I loved this one. 
√Diced Chicken with assorted Pepper, Ginger and Garlic. It was a personal favourite of mine. Thai crispy rolls stuffed with vermicelli, kafir lime peanuts and roasted chilies. 
√Taipei(fish)- Sliced fish tossed with scallions, chillies and Asian wine. This one tasted a tad sweet to me personally, but delicious nonetheless.

Coming to the main course, we tasted- 
√Kai Gra Tiem- Sliced Chicken tossed in black pepper and basil sauce. I loved this dish. Beautifully prepared and tasted just as amazing. 
√Pla Pad Pak- An authentic recipe served with assorted vegetables, oyster sauce and mushroom. 
√Khao pad Kra Tiem(egg)- Thai smoked oil and burnt garlic rice
√Chilli Garlic Noodles
√Mix Wok tossed Hakka Noodles
√Roasted Chilli Pork

In dessert, we had
√Ice-cream sandwich- Vanilla bean ice cream deep frozen between chocolate biscuits and served with chocolate sauce. This one is a house-creation and managed to impress me a lot. I would surely go back again just to try that.

This is a 18-20 seater restaurant. Not very large, but very cozy and perfect for dates or if you want to have a meal with your family. The low background music enhances the ambience. It's a great place to spend some quality time with your significant other or your friends.
Thank you

Too much of selfishness with chocolate sauce. Hot brownies were not at all close to being hot. 
Service is good. Seating is mediocre. Overall okayish.

Great Chinese Authentic food.
Wonton and Spicy Sea Food Soup at starter was yummy
At Main course- Scezwan Rice, Cantonese Gravy Chow was perfect.
The best was Roasted Chilly pork and Pla Gra Tem (A fish Dish)
Beautiful food, although space is very little- booking recommended.
Thamks Krishanu Das for Recommendation.

How can a restaurant run without any washroom? I mean seriously? And still having 4+ rating? Not fair. Please work on that. After entering that, got to know this. How to wash man? I mean come on!!

Situated in purna das road, beside sudipar rannaghor.

I really love the quality of the pork and lamb that they serve. Do try the pork and lamb in choice of your sauce. 
Lamb could be a bit more soft though.
3.5/5 for the lamb. And 4/5 for the pork. Preparation was pretty good.
I absolutely love their pan fried noodles. The quantity of one easily will suffice 2 people.  Noodles: 5/5.
The only minus point is that the restaurant is too small. And ambience is okayish. Nothing exceptional. Moreover I'll give this a 4/5 overall.
Plus, this place wouldn't pinch a big hole in your pocket. Its pocket friendly.

The hype for Chinese food in this city is never subsiding. Upholding its reputation for serving the best Chinese food in the country, Kolkata has no shortage of old and new eateries providing the flavors of orient. Being a city of food lovers, Kolkata's love for Oriental flavors is never ending.

Adding to oriental genre for quite a while now is China Wok..

A not so spacious eatery located near Triangular park with a neat and comforting ambience and even lovelier food.

On my recent visit there for a review I came across some amazing food.

A few mention worthy dishes were:

Spinach and black pepper dumplings: Green colored chicken dumplings tossed in special sauce of soy and mushrooms. An absolutely yummmm!

Smoked red oil dumplings: Chicken dumplings topped with karprow sauce. Spicy and red!

Steamed vegetarian dumplings: If you think vegetarian food cannot surprise you, then think again!

Because this plate will render you speechless!!

Pad Nam Prik Pow : Another non meat marvel. I enjoy vegetarian food as much as non vegetarian and this crispy veggies tossed in kaffir lime and lemongrass was a huge thumbs up for me. Massive Thai love!

Prik kai Sat Sai Thod: Spicy wings tossed in kaffir lime and lemon grass. A total standout for me. One of my favorite starters till date.

Moving to the main course.

The pla Gra Tiem and the Kung Pao chicken were the fish and chicken sides respectively.

I absolutely loved the fish cooked in a pepper and basil sauce. The peppery aftertaste adds a bit of sharpness in the dish.

The fried rice and chilli garlic noodles were very we'll accompanied by the curries.

I need to make a special mention of Pak Pad Karprow, another vegetarian dish at it's best!

Absolutely loved the vegetables cooked in a burnt chili sauce and lemongrass!

The highlight of the evening however was the Red Thai curry and steamed rice. A match made in paradise. That is Thai at its best.

Last but not the least THE DESSERT.

YES!

How does homemade ice cream sandwich served with chocolate sauce and nuts sound?

Droolworthy much?

A big thumbs up and highly recommended for all the asian food lovers out there.

Savor the flavors of orient to the fullest.

Dinner invitation on the occasion of new wokaholism menu launch brought the PanchPhoron group here. 

It's located at Purnadas Road, behind Triangular Park. A small restaurant with a seating arrangement of around 15 people at a time though the space is congested. Dining space is upstairs with clear glass covering giving an amazing view of the road.

The recipes we were served -

STARTERS -
1. Nan Thor - Sliced Potato tossed in Thai sweet chilli sauce with a dash of Kaffir lime and  then sprinkled with sesame seeds. It tasted amazing.

2. Crispy Fish Keong's Chilli - Basa fillets are prepared with red chillies, paprika powder, white pepper and Sar keong which is a Cantonese term for sand ginger.
This spicy fish recipe was appetizing.

3. Chicken Three Pepper Dynamite - Boneless chicken pieces are cooked with Sichuan peppers, yellow red & green bell peppers,black peppercorns and spring onions. It's a scrumptious dish.

For Main Course -

1. Beijing's Old Market Chicken - Chicken pieces tossed with sweet bean paste until coated and mixed with roasted cashews. A delicious curry and a must try indeed.

2. Vietnamese Black Pepper & Mushroom Fried Rice - Jasmine rice tossed with peanut oil chopped lemongrass, carrots,sweet peas, sliced lap cheong, shallots and black pepper with mushrooms. Appetizing rice goes perfectly with Beijing's old market chicken.

3. Phat Mama - Stir fried Thai instant noodles mixed with chicken & egg and Vegetables. It tasted amazing.

4. Mongolian Fried Rice - A delicious fried rice dish with loads of veggies and flavour. Rice with broccoli florets, yellow red & green bell peppers, red cabbage, chilli paste and cooked with hoisin sauce.

Desserts-
Darsaan with ice cream - It is a popular Chinese dessert made with fried wonton noodles. The noodles are drizzled with honey and sesame seeds & accompanied with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. This ends the scrumptious dinner in a better way.

So if you are a fan of Chinese food, you know where to head for!!!

Perfect sneak point on a rainy day around Hindustan Park. This cosy small outlet is decently kept. Any visitor will be spoilt for choice between it's Thai and Chinese cuisines. However was settled for Drums of Heaven Chinese style and Pan Fried Noodles. The food tasted above average, but nothing like the best Pan Fried Noodles I ever had in the city ;). Service was decent. A bit pricey for the quality of food they serve. 
Food - 4.0/5
Service - 4.2 /5 
Interiors - 4.5/5

FOOD TASTING AT CHINA WOK (COURTESY ENTREPRENEUR VARUN RAJGARHIA)

Location:- Hindustan Park (Triangular Park)

Well, we the enthusiast foodies often dream of travelling to foreign locations just for the sake of eating authentic Thai / Chinese fodder to satisfy those unsatiated cravings for authentic cuisines – but are often unable to do so – owing to personal or professional commitments. But fret not, what I suggest is that we Indians should rather travel to China Wok at Hindustan Park and gorge on some outstanding Chinese (as well as Thai) delicacies and experience both China as well as Thailand in Kolkata only!

This place is a G+1 – where the ground floor serves as the kitchen and the 1st floor acts as the restaurant! Decent China-theme décor adores the place, which is not huge in size, but not too small rather! They adjoin the various tables in case the diner list is pretty long!

We sampled the below Chinese / Thai cuisines:-

(i)	Veg Coriander soup – A perfect kick-off to a great meal, a great appetizer – decent corn, coriander and carrot content – this indeed multiplied our hunger quotient by 2.

(ii)	Veg Steamed dumplings – As stated by them, this was made in pan glazed soya sauce (and thus had a blackish gravy) as well as mushrooms – a great starter – especially when combined with the tomato chilly ketchup!

(iii)	Babycorns – A winner as usual, noteworthy that it did not lose its crispiness for may be half an hour!
(iv) Veg Pak Pad Kraprow – A wide range of thai chilli basil vegetables with lemongrass and burnt chilli paste - was initially somewhat hesitant as Thai cuisines don’t often tickle my taste buds – but this one definitely did!
(v) Veg Khao Pad Krotiem – One of the better rice palates you will ever eat – especially when curated with burnt garlic and topped with generous amounts of coriander and corn!

(vi) Veg Chilli garlic noodles – A big thank you to the chef for preparing a veg noodles of this calibre – indeed one of the best in my recent past – 2 things doing the trick for me – the sweetness imparted by the sweet ketchup used in its making and the chopped spring onion content!

(vii) Ice cream sandwich – Finally, the path to heaven – vanilla ice cream stuffed between couple of chocolate layers and topped with roasted crispy cashew nuts as well as chocolate sauce – still not over this dish. Had 2 pieces of the same and still craving for 10 more!

Service is superb and the staff attempt to make you as comfortable as possible!

Pocket pinch, again is commensurate to what they serve – both in terms of quality as well as quantity – and you get your every penny’s worth!

A trip to China and Thailand might cost us a lakh, but a trip to China Wok will cost you some 0.5% - 1% of that sum!

To sum up, head to CW and experience China as well as Thailand in Kolkata.

A big thank you to king blogger Krishanu Das for this invite!

P.S.:- Planning a visit soon to their counterpart – The Asia House, Southern Avenue.

Indians and especially Bengalis have always had a special love for Chinese food suited to Indian palettes and off late, we seem to be developing a love for Thai food as well.. It seems i am no different either which is why it was one of those rare occasions on 13th July, when i went to a pre-planned Chinese cum Thai dinner at China Wok with fellow foodies although most of my luncheons or dine outs are generally unplanned.. Little did i know then that i will fall in love with Chinese and Thai food yet again by the time i leave that eatery courtesy the lavish spread of food that was waiting for us..
                                                                ...

A place where you can visit with your family and be assured that you will have a great time not only because of the appetizing food and their intrinsic taste of Chinese, but as well as the personal care they take coupled with such great service.  Now coming down to their food, it is scrumptious and well presented at the same time and pocket friendly as well. I had quite a few items from the menu and would definitely recommend the same to all.

Soups & Starter:
1. Coriander Soup (both veg and chicken and it was really nice)
2. Spinach & Black Pepper Dumplings (Chicken) topped with sauce made from pan glazed soy & mushrooms
3. Smoked Red Oil Dumplings (Chicken)
4. Steamed Dumplings (Veg) topped with sauce made from pan glazed soy & mushrooms
5. Hua Hin Highway Rolls (Thai crispy rolls with stuffing)
6. Prik Kai Sot Sai Thod (Chicken Wings)
7. Pad Nam Prik Pow (Thai crispy vegetables)

Mains:
1. Pla Gra Tiem (sliced fish tossed in black pepper & basil sauce)
2. Kung Pao Chicken
3. Pak Pad Kraprow ( Thai Chili Basil vegetables)
4. Khao Pad Kratiem (Thai smoked oil burnt garlic rice)
5. Chilli Garlic Noodles

Dessert:
1. Ice Cream Sandwich (this is a must try, topped with chocolate sauce and roasted cashew nuts it tasted amazing!!)

Over all it was a great experience and I was really happy with the flavor and the quantity served! Well done guys, keep up the good work!!

When it comes to Chinese, there are rare gems scattered around Kolkata which manage to make a significant impact on our minds ensuring that they trudge down our hearts ultimately converging into our all time favourites.
This time it was China Wok which managed to create a blissful impact on me.
Located in Purna Das Road, this cuisine has it's own chill vibe.

This restaurant has two floors. The lower one comprises of the kitchen and the upper floor is the dining area. The space is not that huge to be honest but definitely a family restaurant with a capacity of more than 30 people.

Tossing up with loads of spices, we have managed to give Chinese dishes an Indianized spin through and through. Youth friendly and a tad bit quirky, the ambience exudes a very casual and chill vibe as I mentioned earlier.

We started off with the Chicken Coriander Soup which was made of garden fresh vegetables. The texture and smoothness were on point.

It was followed by Spinach and Black Pepper Dumplings (Chicken) and Hua Hin Highway Rolls (Chicken).
These were basically for cleansing the palate and something to bite on as the meal arrived.

The Spinach and Black Pepper Dumplings were topped with their special signature sauce made from pan glazed soy and mushrooms.

And the Hua Hin Highway Rolls were stuffed with vermicelli, kaffir lime, peanuts and roasted chillies.

Up next were the Smoked Red Chicken Dumplings and the Steamed Dumplings. The former was topped with fresh kraprow sauce while the latter was a vegetarian dish which had a delicious texture because of their signature sauce.

The herbs gave it a flavour and each bite you would be reminded of how wonderful the meal ahead would be.

The Prik Kai Sai Thai Thod turned out to be a memorable dish as the chicken wings were tossed in Thai Sweet Chilli Sauce with kaffir lime and lemongrass which made the taste authentic.

Following that came the Pad Nam Prik Pow which was a thai dish comprising of crispy vegetables with kaffir lime and lemongrass.
Light and soothing, it invoked best of the flavours.

For the mains, the first item served was the Pla Gra Tiem. It was sliced fish tossed and loaded with black pepper and basil sauce. The item was spicy as well as delicious on the other hand, too.

The Kung Pao Chicken was gorgeous and soulful. The quantity was huge and with the touch of Kung Pao sauce in it, it tasted heavenly. With cashewnuts served as toppings, the dish was absolutely perfect.

Pak Pad Kraprow was up next. This vegetarian dish was cooked to perfection with the help of lemongrass and burnt chilli paste.

Khao Pad Kratiem, this Thai dish was made with Thai smoked oil and therefore the taste of the burnt garlic rice was enhanced making it taste even better.

Chilli Garlic Noodles was an extremely simple dish but delicious with flavours on point and the touch of spice was mouthwatering.

The quality of every delicacy is top knotch and the quantity is sufficient. The food is fantastic and the most astonishing fact is that they do not use Ajina Moto in their dishes placing them above other mainstream Chinese restaurants.

Our meal ended with the Ice Cream Sandwich. Needless to say, this perennial favourite was topped with lots of roasted cashewnuts. With chocolate sauce on it, this dessert was perfection and tasted grand with the vanilla icecream stuffed inside.

What's life without a dessert? Said a great person on a bright sunny day. That's exactly what the icecream sandwich did to me, made me smile a little brighter and made my soul feel a little fuller.

The meal finally ended with full and heavy stomachs and I definitely had a blast here. The food, ambience, location, value for money, service, it ticks everything off your checklist and manages to impress through and through.

Ambience : 4.5/5
Taste Quotient : 5/5
Service : 5/5

If you haven't visited them yet, then this surely is the correct time to start.

I am a food lover and i enjoy eating in Chinese restaurant and on Friday
I was invited by a friend of mine to go for dinner at china wok restaurant. He actually chose it, not me, but it was very good and it is one of the best that I’ve ever eaten in. Everything was excellent, the service, the ambience, the food, and obviously good company as well, so it was a perfect evening we spent together.
The food they offer of a very high standard and superb quality. The menu is varied and includes something for everyone. they cater for vegetarians too with plenty of variety available for those who don’t want to eat meat or chicken

I decided to have Coriander flavored thick soup with garden fresh vegetables, Spinach and black pepper dumplings(chicken) , Smoked red oil dumplings(chicken), Steamed dumpling (veg) , baby corn, highway rolls, and spring roll. Though it was alot of food for all the 9 of us. The only reason we could eat was because The food was excellent; I couldn’t fault it for anything. It was served quickly and was delicious. It’s a place I will definitely be recommending to other people now that I’ve been and tried it for myself.

The whole experience was very good, from the food, the scenery and of course having an opportunity to catch up with my friend and even getting the opportunity to make new friends , so there were many reasons why this was a restaurant I enjoyed going to, and it was actually better than I thought it would be. And as it is said expect the unexpected. Though Being a new restaurant it stood up to all up my expectations and its a best place to get the essence of real Chinese food i am just for the next time i visit china wok. .

If you are anything like me, you obviously get cravings for Chinese and Thai food every two to three days. Then allow me to introduce you to a great destination where you can satisfy those cravings without burning a hole in your pocket.

China Wok joins a myriad of restaurants that have set up shop on Kolkata's Purna Das Road and is located just near Hindustan Park and should be impossible to miss. I had been to this place a couple of years back for a quick lunch and was impressed already but last night's review made me fall in love with the place. You enter and head up the stairs to a small and well lit dining room that could fit around 17-18 people at once. The ambiance is very well suited for a family meal or a dine out with friends. Service is prompt and the staff is friendly so that is definitely a big plus. 

No restaurant review makes any sense without talking about the food and boy it was a feast last night. Let me take you through a sample of the large number of items they have on their menu waiting to please your taste buds- 

Coriander Soup(Chicken/Veg options available)- We started off with a hot steaming bowl of coriander and chicken soup with other vegetables tossed in to the mix that seemed straight out of comfort food land. Very generous, very delicious, very satisfying.

Spinach and Black Pepper Dumplings with Chicken filling- The green color of the dumplings popped on the plate and the sauce made from soy and mushrooms and the tasty filling made this dish very likable. 

Smoked Red Oil Dumplings- The red color of these dumplings again popped on the plate making it a very attractive dish and it was equally attractive to the taste buds as well. This was my favorite dumpling served in the evening. 

Vegetarian Steamed Dumplings- The name is deceptively simple but the flavors were mighty strong. I took a real liking to this dish being a hard core carnivore.

Hua Hin Highway Rolls- The crispiness of these rolls were definitely one of my favorite bits about them. The filling generous and delicious and the sweet chili dip was a perfect complement. 

Prik Kai Sat Sai Thod- These were chicken wings tossed in kaffir lime and lemongrass and thai sweet chili sauce and were certainly my favorite starter this evening. 

Pad Nam Prik Pow- Thai Crispy vegetables with Kaffir lime and lemongrass. Again I shall point out that this vegetarian dish mighty impressed a hard core carnivore like me. The smell of kaffir lime and hint of lemongrass were hard to fault. 

Pla Gra Tiem- Sliced Fish tossed in black pepper and basil sauce. The fish was perfectly cooked and tender and the sauce was delicious. 

Kung Pao Chicken- We all have heard of or tasted this dish at some point of time and it did not disappoint. 

Pak Pad Kraprow- Thai Chili Basil Vegetables with lemongrass and burnt Chili paste. Again I have to point out how good this place can make veggies taste because this was absolutely delicious, the use of lemongrass and kaffir lime elevating the dish so much. 

Khao Pad Kratiem(Veg/Egg)- This was fried rice that came with both egg and vegetarian options and were a great accompaniment to those beautiful curries. 

Chili Garlic Noodles- The name says it all. This was a vegetarian dish too. I would like to however point out that I found the noodles very thick, maybe I am used to having thinner noodles all the time, and kind of hard to swallow without a lot of sauce as lubricant. This was the only dish in the evening that failed to impress me. 

Additionally we ordered the following from their regular menu-

Steamed Rice and Red Thai Curry(Chicken)- They were the highlight of the evening and were absolutely a match made in heaven. I will certainly order these first before anything else the next time I visit. 

Finally we were served dessert and the Ice Cream Sandwich was absolutely delicious and so much so I went for a second helping. 

One more point that I have to point out about this place is that they have a no ajinamoto policy which makes their dishes additionally healthy besides being tasty. 

I had a great experience at China Wok last evening and would certainly recommend this place to all Asian Food Lovers. I will certainly visit again to try more.

Food is an experience. It’s both a science and an art and is meant to be enjoyed and relished.  With such passion for food, it’s quite obvious that we love to talk about it too. The Chinese  share their love of language as well as their love for food. The Chinese have had a well known legacy of their food. China Wok located at Purna Das  Road is just a cheerful restaurant.

Fall in love with the whole new delicacies revamped from Mongolia, Vietnam, Thailand, China. You name it and you get it at the China Wok.

What a non-vegetarian workaholic like me would suggest?

1. London's China Town chicken - Wok tossed sliced chicken with burnt honey sauce, wine and roasted chillies

2. Pan tossed fish in Keong's chilli - Wok tossed fish with Thai hot and sweet chilli and kaffir lime

3. Beijing's old market prawns - Wok tossed prawns with street vendors soy and cashewnuts

4. Pan tossed spicy Mongolian noodles - Wok tossed Mongolian delicacy with curry sauce and chillies

5. Vietnamese black pepper and mushroom fried rice - Wok tossed Vietnamese fried rice with mushroom, soya and Bird's eye chillies.

P. S. - Do not forget to hit on the amazing Sui Mai that China Wok serves.

Vegetarians need not feel morose as there are delicacies like Man Thor, Wok tossed crispy lotus stem and Yamchai's noodle bowl and many more waiting for you.

So buck up your taste buds, roll your tongues tight and drop into China Wok to rediscover the love for good Oriental food.
Cheers!

This place is very nearby to my house so it was a ling time target to give it a try... the place is nicely decorated with nice ambience, perfect for a family dinner, though there is a ltl shortage of space u may have to wait for a while during rush hours. For tge starters we ordered asian styled barbq chicken.. its was really good nd highly recommended, a very appt appetizer for the spicy tongues. Their menu has two divisions... u can always mix match nd thrs  lot to choose from... so its a bit confusing at the beginning. 
Well we decided to stick to Chinese (as it was our 1st visit, so experimenting was risky) ... we ordered tai chen chicken nd wok tossed chicken hakka noodles. I was really happy with the quantity nd quality of the food. Less spicy more on flavours it was really good. Lastly choco brownie was cherry on the top. 
Verdict- very satisfied nd dfntly deserves a 2nd visit specially for the Thai dishes, nd yes reasonable pricing is friendly on pockets as well.

China wok is situated in purna das road near hindusthan park. It is a simple but good place to have a dine.
The restaurant is pretty small with max 16-17 seating arrangements but once you are seated it is quite comfortable. The entry point is quite interesting with the kitchen at the ground floor and a small winding staircase leading upto the mezzanine floor where the tables are placed. The walls along the staircase are decorated with different wall hangings and the dining space is beautifully lit up with hanging lanterns.

Now,the food is also quite good and a worth for your money.
We ordered chicken sweet corn soup, crispy konjee chicken, Kai gra tiem, chicken hakka noodles and chicken fried rice. The crispy konjee chicken was very well cooked and the Kai gra tiem was excellent.
All in all a good place to have brilliant Chinese and Thai food.

This new kid on the block has got its basics right- it does the Indian Chinese more than decently. From Territi Bazaar to old favourites like Krystal Chopsticks, Bengalis have a taste for  their very own version of Chinese food acquired over generations, and China Wok does not disappoint. 

We ordered the typicals- Mixed fried rice, mixed hakka chowmein and a plate of gravy chilli chicken. The staff asked us to seat ourselves while they packed our order for takeaway, and I had a chance to inspect the coziness of the seating area on the first floor overlooking Purna Das road below. It holds its own in a highly competitive neighbourhood with the successfully running Hongkong Express not very far away. 

The items are decently priced, and taste exactly how you expect them to. Definitely worth repeated visits, if only to satiate my comfort food cravings. Perhaps I will be more adventurous on a future visit and try something new on the menu.

There is a space crunch at this chinese-thai joint in Triangular Park and the staircase is very narrow. There are only 4 tables and possibly just 1 attendant, so service is also a little slow.
However the flavours of their dishes are on point.
The roasted pork with bokchoy starter was succulent and delicious. Lamb preparations often go wrong and turn out to be tough and even smelly, but their roasted lamb in black bean sauce was amazingly tender. The rice and noodles mains are okay but not that great in quantity.
We also had pan fried veg noodles and 9 treasured vegetables which were on the sweeter side but tasty nonetheless.
Overall a nice little family diner.

Was passing by searching for new restaurant to try upon, a neighbour of Sudipar Rannaghar.a small family restaurant serving reasonable chinese food which is served proper for two per plate.Names of food are a bit different but nothing very out of the world. served by a singular person attending all the four tables and the same person billing at the end was very surprising for me.but a place worth a visit atleast once.

We had our dinner there today. Ordered Asian chicken soup, wok tossed chicken noodles and diced chicken with hot garlic soup. The food was really good! Especially I liked the soup and the noodles. I would recommend this place for a small cosy family dinner. However they have only four tables here and no separate washroom. The place is mainly for table bookings and take home orders. They have another restaurant nearby which is Asia House. I will definitely try that on another day.

We ordered two lunch boxes. Brilliant food and sumptuous quantity. 

I know where to order my food from next time onwards! 
I'm so glad this place is extremely inexpensive and perfect for a meal when you're low on cash.

A cozy Chinese Restaurant, with simple Chinese offerings and great portion size; this is what China Wok to me. It was my first visit to the place and I was attending bloggers meet over there at China Wok. Minimally decorated, optimal use of the space and 4-5 tables; and that says all. They are having limited space and they have used the space perfectly where the ground floor is the kitchen and 1st floor is the dining area.
                                                                ...

This is one cool, cozy (I mean super cozy joints near the Triangular Park). The ground floor is having the kitchen and cash counter, while the first floor is having 4 four-seater tables. The frontage is tastefully done with glass offering a great view of the purna das road. I was invited here along with my foodie friends for a food-tasting session. Let me be clear  and non-romantic. This place is your friendly neighbourhood oriental joint and the USP is great (I mean seriously great portion size) and decent food. The staircase leading tp the first floor might be slightly problematic for elderly people (and owners are quite apologetic about it) but once you're there, the ambience is fine. We've tasted the eight treasure soup- basically chicken sweet corn soup with some veggies thrown in and it tasted seriously good. The chicken sui mai which came next was having large meat stuffing, but the outer coating was pretty thick- however the homemade sauce served with it saved it royally- it was super yummy. The vietnamese black peeper and mushroon fried rice was yummy and more so because I have a weakness for mushroom. And the china town chicken was great also. I personally don't like Basa, so no comment on the fish dish. The darsan was a great end to a meal. Being spread out in two floors, the service is a great boost. But, next time, I'd love to try their lunch combos ..... 

Overall, if you're not looking for something outworldly, recommended.

This place is not talked about much, but I have been there twice and I am sure I will return again. Both the experiences have been nice. We loved the Schezuan Fried Rice; the Pan fried fish and Chicken in black bean sauce were also very tasty.  We had the Darshaan, which was a lovely desert to end with. I recommend this place wholeheartedly for Chinese lovers who do not want to spend too much.

This small eatery near Trianglar park definitely values for your money. The place is very tiny with only 4 tables but the quality of food they serve is distinctive.
I ordered Chicken clear soup, Which was very fresh and far better than I imagined it would be. Then I tried Prawn Sui Mai, Which was a hit. And lets not forget about Pla Pad Pak, that's a dish one will remember for a long time.
Although the ambience could be a bit better , I'd say overall it was a good experience.

This place is located very near to Traingular Park.It's a small restaurant with 4 table's.Lemme talk about the good things first,the food.It tasted good but that's it there is nothing else in place.I think it's better to get a home delivery or take away from this place than dining in.Service is slow,there's nothing to talk about the decor and this place doesn't even have a rest room.The rating of three is only for the food.

Good food i must say, no scratch that great food, great taste, great flavors. We had mixed seafood soup, schezwann pork and burnt garlic rice. Everything was great. Then why a mediocre rating, because of the place, its too small, service isn't very prompt, isn't very posh of a place. And they charge a lot for they serve. 
Pricing should have been a bit more aggressive.
Worth trying out.

For many, food is an experience. It is both a science and an art. It is meant to be savored and enjoyed. In a culture with such passion for food, it is no surprise that we also like talking about it. While the Chinese share that love of language, they also have a love of food. Over their centuries-long history, the Chinese have composed an innumerable collection of legacy – including food.

This newly opened food joint mainly serves Chinese & Thai delicacies. They have home delivery, dine in & take away facilities.  This is one of the rarest gem in Kolkata which serves authentic Chinese dishes at a pocket friendly price, food here is less spicy, msg ( monosodium glutamate ) free and  reasonable. 

Location -  Just beside Sudipa's Rannaghar , Purna Das road, Kolkata.

Ambience & Decor -  Nice ambience , small sitting arrangements at the 1st floor and simple decor with Chinese theme.

Staffs & Service -  Staffs are well behaved and service is prompt.

We Panchphoron team went for a food tasting event and had the following - 

1) Spicy lemon burnt Garlic soup (Chicken) 2*4 portions
( spicy soup with fresh lemon, burnt garlic and green chillies)

2) 8 Treasure soup (Chicken)- 2*4 portions
( traditional coriander and chilli flavoured thick soup with vegetables and mushrooms)

Review-  Both were of medium consistency, had perfect balance of flavours , generously filled and appetising.

Starters -
1)Prik kai sot sai Thod - 1 portion
( chicken wings tossed in Thai sweet chilli sauce with kaffir lemon)

2)Asian barbecued chicken- 1 portion
( Pan roasted Chicken smoked with charcoal and caramelised in Barbeque and butter sauce)

3)Chicken sui mai - 1 portion
( wafer thin flour wrappers with minced and served with garlic oil)

Review-
All were perfect as a starter and were well cooked with full balance of flavours. Out of three, Asian Barbecued chicken  was the best.

Mains-

1)Kung pao chicken - 2 portion
( diced chicken toast in kung Pao sauce and finished with roasted cashew nuts)

2)Pla pad kraprow - 1 portion
( sliced fish tossed in Thai Chilli Basil sauce with Birds eye Chilli)

3)Thai Red Curry ( veg .) - 1 portion

Review-  All the three above side dishes were also well prepared and were delicious. Highly recommended...... !!

Rice & Noodles -

1) Schezwan rice ( chicken) -2 portions
( spicy fried rice tossed with roasted Chili paste , bell peppers and dry Red Chillies)

2)Chilli garlic noodles (egg) -2 portions

3)Steamed rice - 1 portion

Review-  All were well cooked and quantity was enough too and had perfect spice balance and generous fillings. Schezwan rice and Chilli garlic noodles are highly recommended .

Desserts-
Darsaan with vanilla ice cream - 2 portions
( crispy fried flowers strips tossed with Burnt honey and caramelized sugar)

Review -  very enjoyable and one of the best Darsan I have ever tasted.

This is a perfect place for having authentic Chinese dishes at a reasonable price , if  Mainland China is not in someone's budget , this is definately the place to try for.

Thanks to the management of China Wok for their hospitality and warm reception.

What a remarkable restaurant, takes you unawares, completely. It's a small para joint, and you expect nothing more, but you are soon proved wrong as dish after dish of well crafted oriental food comes to the table and you really can't find fault in it. I ordered dimsum, roast pork with bak choy, thai green curry and steamed rice. All of them were great. The roast pork melted in my mouth, the dimsum was glorious with it's accompanying coriander sauce, the Thai green curry refreshing with the steamed fragrant rice.I  ate well, and my wallet was happy too.The service was warm and friendly. It's like having Mainland China/Chinoiserie food in your own neighbourhood at an honest price. Do give it a try...

A  Chinese restaurant in Purna Das Road, Hindusthan Park, South Kolkata. The place is really small with max to max 10-15 seating arrangements. Ambiance is very relaxing with beautiful decor.  China Wok is MSG (Monosodium glutamate) free restaurant which is very good, and they also believes in ethical vegetarianism.Me and my fellow foodie friends were there for a bloggers meet and taste some delicious preparation they made for us.

This was the first time I ordered from China Wok as I wanted to explore a new option. I got the Veg Hakka, Pan fried Chilly Paneer and Veg Manchurian. I was quite disappointed with the food. The quality of it was not really a problem but it lacked taste. The noodles were quite thin that made them feel like the glass noodle variety instead of the usual hakka noodles one gets. The manchurian was quite spicy and that was the only flavor it had. The paneer was not that good and overall felt devoid of any flavor. Just left a sweet after taste in the mouth. The portion size was decent.

Nice place.The foods are mouth watering.As a Chinese lover a great place to go.The ambience is good as well as the decoration.
The non-veg starters are lip smacking.Poultry,pork,lamb,prawn all is so tasty as well as the dim sums.The Thai curry are exotic in taste.
The rice preparation are good also.
Desserts are appealing and give you a comfort after this food journey.
Thank you Rajdeep Bhattacharya and Panchphoron to give me such as opportunity.

It's a small outlet, accommodating 4 families at most. It's mainly known as a delivery counter. If you got to enjoy authentic low msg Indian Chinese it is one of the best. They use basa fish, not bekti but the fish preparations are not to be missed out. The ones who have a bias for bekti like me, will develop a taste for basa. Try the crispy fish in honey chilli sauce: something out of the world.

This restaurant is located just beside Sudipa's rannaghar.went here with a friend on Saraswati Puja.we had Pla Chorn Pad Prik Khing(crispy fish with red curry sauce) as started.then we ordered Pad Kee Mao(spicy thai prawn rice noodles) as main dish and Kai Gra Tiem(chicken in hot garlic and black pepper) as side dish.The starter one was the best in taste amongst all..The noodles tasted good,but the chicken dish was very dissapointing.it literally had no taste at all.this maybe because the gravy had too much cornflour in it.we could not eat it further,so we had to order crispy chilli babycorn,which was decent.the prices are high in comparison with the taste and quality of the food.we opted for the Thai cuisine,so cannot comment on the Chinese dishes.one can give this place a try though.

The food of China Wok is pretty good for the price. The ingredients that they use are mainly followed by the the people in the mainland of China. What I mean is, they do not indulge in being the people's favourite Chinese and they emphasise more on the Chinese aspect of the food. You will not find your spicy Chilli Chicken or a heavily masala filled Chinese dish if that is what you are used to. If you want to taste actual Chinese but your pocket is not allowing you to visit Mainland China, go for China Wok which is a mini China town at the heart of the City located just opposite to Triangular Park.

This restaurant is located next to triangular park, on Purna Das Road.On my way to work and back, I have been observing this place for a long time. The only thing that held me back from visiting this place is the space shortage. For a big family, it might prove difficult to fit in. So the only option left for me was to order from here. And order I did. And it turned out to be some of the best Chinese food that I have ever had. Each and every dish that I had ordered turned out to be truly satisfying. To be honest I never expected such quality food, but this was without a doubt, up there with the best. I just hope that they keep up the good work and at the same time keep improving... Cause innovations and improvisation are really important to keep your customers interested.

China Wok is located just beside Sudipar Rannaghor at Hindustan Park and it will be distinctly visible on the left side if one travels from Purna Das Road towards Golpark. The place is well lit has possess around 25 covers. We went on a Saturday evening around 7.30 after a shopping spree at Gariahat, an found the place empty. However, we were nicely welcomed by the service staffs. 
We ordered the following items - Chicken Eight Treasures Soup, Pan Fried Chilli Fish, Drums of Heaven. The soup had a nice taste however the amount of chicken present was meagre enough. The fish tasted overwhelming, but compensated negatively was the Drums of Heaven which lacked any punch whatsoever and tasted ordinary. The bill was just on the okayish side. I would like to come again to taste their main courses.
Till then, buck up guys, you can do it !

Coming to the food , me and my fiance ordered the Drums of Heaven and the Steamed Chicken Dimsum for starters. 

The food tasted really good. Not at all like the indian chinese but like how authentic Chinese should be.

For mains we Had the Chilli Garlic Noodles and The Diced Chicken in Hot Garlic sauce. The chicken however could have been better. 

All in all a Good experience. Would love to try out the other dishes on offer from the really large menu .

We had food delivered at our office yesterday for lunch. This is a newly opened restaurant on Lake View Road next to Lake Kali Bari. The menu is innovative and makes you want to eat things you have not had before.

We ordered for Chicken Balinese Curry, Steamed Rice and Vietnamese Rice Paper Rolls.

The Balinese curry was tremendous. It was spicy but soothing and had a great variety of herbs and spices. At the end two of us polished it off and wanted more.

The rice paper rolls were well steamed, colourful and tasted great. The sweet chilli dipping sauce was well made.

Delivery arrived in 45 mins from ordering and pocket pinch was affordable. Will order again soon.

I was planning to order food but due to cash crunch and unavailability of POS service for home delivery had to go for take away service. This place is situated at hindusthan park near to triangular park (beside sudipar rannaghor restaurant ). There eating place is on 1st floor. I ordered chicken sui mai, wok tossed chicken and egg noodle and roasted chilly pork. It took almost 1 hr for them to prepare our food due to sui mai. They took this time to prepare sui mai but they informed us while ordering only. Sui mai was nothing extraordinary. Wok tossed noodle was fine to taste but chilly pork was dry and non juicy sliced meat pieces.it wasnt even medium spicy as they said. Since im a lover of roasted chilly pork i just wish they improve it.

It's delight in a box. 
Such a cute little place and we were blown away by the food. Love it when a cuisine like Chinese brings in a punch of new flavours. 
Tried their roast pork in chili sauce and their Sui mai which is a variation of a dumpling. What left an impression was their dip. Some sort of a chili caramel herb reduction, might be mistaken. But oh so good.

Located right beside triangular park, this joint serves some lovely  Chinese & Thai food.Decor wise basic but the staff are extremely cordial. Food quality is real good here.We ordered for China Woks signature soup along with Fish in Oyster Sauce& Mixed Noodles.Soup was pretty damm neat and kick started the meal on the right note.The mixed noodles that they served were glass noddles was a good partner to the Fish in Oyster sauce, loved the later as while you dig into the fish you can simply relish the lingering taste of the oyster sauce which is simply delicious. I really liked their quality ,quality is ok, but price I think is a tad bit overpriced.

Had their lovely Veg. Sui mai on a friend's recommendation and loved it. Also some Pork with Bok Choy which was nice and Seafood Fried rice, not so remarkable. Quantity is good. The seating space is  limited with only 4 tables, though the glass front ensures it does not feel claustrophobic

This place was almost empty when we went there around 3 PM. Location is convenient but it's very small. Coming to the food, it's brilliant. We orderd mixed seafood soup, roasted chilli pork, moo gra tiem and veg burnt garlic coriander rice. Soup was oozing with shrimp, crabmeat and fish. The rice didn't have burnt garlic flavour. Otherwise it was good. All the items satisfied every inch of my tastebuds. One and only drawback is considering the decor and service, the place is a bit overpriced. Aniket Mallick

China Wok .. situated at Hindustan park, near Triangular park, easy to locate! Went with 3 of my frnds on Wednesday evening!
It's a small restaurant with kitchen on the ground floor.. and restaurant on the mezzanine floor!
There are just 4 tables arnd 16 17 ppl can sit but once you're in.. it's very comfortable and you enjoy the dining experience!

It's ambiance is simple.. while you enter you'll find some pictures on d wall beatiful lit lamps hanging.. and a narrow staircase leads u to the dining area!

There are a lot in the menu to choose from .. not just Chinese but authentic Thai at quite affordable price!

We tried a couple of soup..
8 treasures soup.. was amazing mixture of sea food, chicken,egg and vegetables!
Crab meat soup.. was d most authentic soup y ever had with bits of prawn pieces! The soups were indeed so delicious to increase the hunger for the starters and main course!

For starters we tried food like.. prawn sui mai.. this particular dish was presented so delicately.. soft to touch.. beautifully minced prawns .. tasted so nice!

Asian style bar b q chicken was another good item.. had soya sauce in it.. it was just good .. didn't impress much!
There was this prik kai sot Sai thod.. cooked beautifully.. it was basically a Thai style chicken wings.. it had an amazing flavour of gondhoraaj.. and it was presented beautifully with the leaves of gondhoraaj!

Then coming to main course .. we had chicken Hakka noodles, egg fried rice, sliced fish in hot garlic and kai pad prik craprow..
The noodles and rice were good in quantity.. for 4 ppl it was enough!
Noodles had amazing taste.. loved it
And rice.. I didn't like much..
Coming to fish and chicken items.. they were amazing.. the gravy was thick and delicious
The pieces of fish and chicken were too good..

Coming to the best part.. was the Darshaan with Vanilla Ice cream topped with sesame seeds.. wow
The noodles were crispy..
The staffs were courteous.. the service was good.. this place is quite affordable..
I'll definitely have another visit with my frnds.. to try out more dishes!Anindita Ghosh || The_Foodiefix Suchismita Sarkar

We visited China Wok last Wednesday and little did we know about the excellent food that awaited us.
The ambience is not something to be excited about and has a seating arrangement for roughly 16 people at a time.

Coming to what we ate and how we felt :
1) Crab meat soup (4/5), Rs.160.00/portion : Each spoon of this soup was like a bag of flavours in the mouth! The soup was packed with delicat crabmeat and was so comforting!

2) Prik Kai Sot Sai Thod (4.75/5),Rs.200.00/portion consisting of 6 pieces : (sufficient for 3) In a much easier language, this means, Thai Fried wings! The best dish of the night. Perfectly fried wings, coated with sweet and salty sticky along with some bangon flavours of lemon leaves. A must try when at China Wok.

3)Prawn sui Mai (3/5) @Rs.200.00/portion consisting of 6 pieces. : (Sufficient for 2) Steamed open wantons with a mashed mixture of spices and prawn. The mixture had an overpowering taste of ginger among all the spices. The wantons were steamed to perfection and hence were not rubbery!

•The main course consisted of the following items :

4)Egg khao prad katiem (3.5/5) @Rs.140.00/portion:(Sufficient for 2)In simpler words, this is actually Thai egg fried rice with burnt garlic.Had no such hint of thai flavours. Nothing extraordinary but still quite satisfactory to the taste buds.

5)Sliced fish in Gar Sa (4.5/5)@Rs.240.00 :(Sufficient for 3) Brilliantly cooked basa immersed in a delicious gravy! Such a beautiful concoction. The fish was amazingly delicate. Another must try, definitely.

6)Chicken hakka noodles (3.5/5) Rs.145.00: (Sufficient for 2)Again a very good main course dish! Tasted just like it should taste. :)

And finally!
7)Darsan with vanilla icecream (4.95/5) Rs.160: (I have no idea about how a single plate can be sufficient for even one person! It was that good!)What an end to an already amazing evening with wonderful food.I have heard that the noodles are made inhouse and that is what makes it so good! The noodles were thin and perfectly crisp without being overtly fired. Topped with gooey honey and white sesame seeds! The best darsan I have tasted so far in Kolkata. Loved it to bits.

China wok is a very good option when you want to relish some really good 'Thai style chinese' at affordable prices. :)

Recommended.:)
Happy eating.:D

Situated inside a lane around Triangular Park,China Wok is a hidden gem. Had gone there for dinner with a couple of friends. A narrow staircase leads you to the restaurant situated on the first floor. The seating capacity is hardly that of 15-17 people. It's best to come in small groups here. 
The Eight Treasure Soup is one of the best soups I have had anywhere. It's a chicken soup filled with veggies. Although the taste is mild,it will stay on ur taste buds. The Asian Style barbequed chicken was good,but the Prik Kai Sot Sai Thod,which is basically Thai style chicken wings,stole the show completely. Crispy chicken wings coated with a delicious Thai style gravy which was flavoured with lemon leaves. This starter packed a punch. 
For main course we had the Sliced Fish in Hot Garlic sauce. I would say this dish is a must try one. Soft and fresh fish along with a gravy abundant with the hot garlicky taste which we all love in our Chinese food,makes this dish quite flavourful. Kai prad Prik kraprow was a chicken side dish. This was another Thai dish,which I think fell a little short of good flavours because of the overwhelming taste of the lemongrass. The chicken pieces could have been softer. We had these with egg fried rice and Hakka. Chowmein. Nothing to talk about there.
The best part about the meal was the Darsan fr dessert. Thin and crispy darsan chips,topped with sesame seeds and served with vanilla ice cream. Everybody jumped onto the plate and finished this off within minutes. It's probably one of the best Darsan available in Kolkata. Overall,I would say it's a great place to have a hearty Chinese or Thai themed meal,without burning a hole in your pocket 😃

Visited this place on the very cloudy evening with an expectation to be impressed, can say that it's did.
Eye soothing ambiance is a prime attraction even though the place hardly accommodates a maximum of 30.
Ambiance:9/10
Service:8/10

Tried out several items from their menu, some of which I can't even pronounce. So here it goes

※Soups※
Chicken 8 Treasure Soup(9/10): This was a brilliant choice. Thick soup with quite a lot of chicken and veggies with ingredient which makes it YUM!

※Starters※
Prik Kai Sat Sai Thod(8.5/10): This was palatable. The pieces of chicken was very well cooked in wise spices and sauces. This is rare!

Asian Style BBQd Chicken(10/10): Couldn't help it! The pieces were big enough and had a tinge sweetness which went boom with the spiciness, melting on my tastebuds with the very first bite.

Prawn Sui Mai(9.5/10): This is something new. I've had only chicken ones bit this is unique and the finely grated prawn in that soft cover is worth a try on your next visit.

※Mains※
Kai Pad Prik Krapprow(7/10): Rated this low because of the lemon grass(may be) which was non eatable and had to be thrown out on every spoon of gravy.

Egg Khao Pad Khatiem(9/10): This is basically egg fried rice. When you have a non veg side dish, this is economical and lipsmacking at taste as well. Try it.

Sliced fish in Hot garlic sauce(9.5/10): You cannot miss this out. Beautiful presentation and tempting to touch your tastebuds, you won't be disappointed.

Darsan(9/10): A brilliant combo of warm Golden crunchy darsan with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream was the beat happy ending to my experience at the China Wok. Magnificent!

There were other dishes too which I didn't eat

Location: The lane beside MUD in Triangular Park leads to the this restaurant.
This is quite a compact one, allowing around 10-15 people to dine at a go. A fleet of stairs lead you to the dining area.
Ordered the Eight Treasure soup which was a chicken soup with loads of veggies and Crab Meat soup.
Along with that we had Asian style barbeque chicken which was crispy chicken in barbeque sauce.
Prik kai sot sai thod which was a chicken dish with the flavour of gondhoraaj, topped with gondhoraaj leaves.
Prawn Suimai which according to me was the dish of the day. Prawn fillings rolled up as little dumplings.
The staff too were really nice to us.
Looking forward to coming back again.

Wow, doing great with the food. But some drawbacks in the service. The food is really good, the Rice and Hakka noodles weren't that good. The side dishes like the Fish in hot garlic sauce, and the Kai Pad Prik Kraprow were pretty good. The starters such as the Prik Kai Sat Sai Thod, and Asian style Barbeque chicken were also good. I really liked the Prik Kai Sat Sai Thod. The Soups weren't that great, but still managed a 4 out of 5 from me. Finally talking about the desserts, the darsan was the best of the lot! Perfectly made crisps along with the vanilla ice cream.

The ambiance is a 3.5/5. I can't actually give more than that.

The service needs improvements too. Quicker service would be appreciable.

Other than that thumbs up from my side, keep up the good work.

From personal experience not thay much of a good food.  The quantity is below average, maybe it was because of festive season but overall it was nothing to cherish. Maybe will give it a visit in the non festive season to have a much better taste of its authenticity 😋

Located in the heart of the city, near Hindustan Park, this place is known for its Thai and Chinese cuisine. We went to try this place during the puja time when undoubtedly there was a huge rush. The indoor seating arrangement is made on the first floor with not more than 6 tables, having a total seating capacity of approx 30 people. The interiors are well lighted, cozy and comfortable with famous quotes all around. The waiters are friendly and ready to help always.  But I was disappointed to see the stairs that led to it. It was too small.

This place doesn’t provide a sophisticated seating on the outdoor as well. It has only 2 tables under an umbrella, with an approx seating capacity of 6 people.

All my annoyance melted on timely arrival of our first dish VEG HAKKA NOODLES. It was delicately sprinkled with spices and veges. Flavourful enough to transport me back to the land of china. Though the quantity seemed a little less to me but its taste made up for all the disappointment.

Rating for veg hakka noodles- 5/5

Along with it we had ordered DICED CHICKEN WITH OYSTER SAUCE which was equally amazing. It was indeed a delightful treat. The oyster sauce was rich, flavourful and had the right consistency. Chicken was also equally balanced in flavours and overall it tasted yum.

Rating-5/5

Next we ordered SINGAPORE RICE NOODLES. It was undoubtedly good but I was expecting more by now. It was appropriately sprinkled with vegetables. Rice noodles where well cooked as it should be, so I can safely give it a rating of 3.5/5

Along with this we had ordered a THAI RED CURRY. The waiters had informed us earlier that it would be spicy but it turned out to be too sweet. I doubt, if they had used a lot of coconut to cook it thus adding to its sweetness. We were utterly annoyed. The idea of a sweet curry does not suit our palate at all.

Rating-1/5

Cost-₹ 1110 for this experience is not applauded by me therefore I don’t find it pocket friendly as well.

Final rating- 3/5

Okay, I consider a restaurant very good if it has rating of 3.9 on zomato. So obviously I was excited to visit this restaurant but to my disappointment the restaurant was simply not up to the mark. Now, to be fair to them it was a very busy afternoon of saptami and I understand that the indoor seats were full so outdoor seating was the only option left but that does not cover up for the inconsistent in the food. Same dish, ordered half an hour later had different taste than the previous one. Mixed noodles had very less quantity of chicken, and the noodles did not taste as good as I would have liked them to be. Pujo special menu consisted of limited items so I wanted them to be good. The veg items too were not that good. Quantity wise it had nothing significant.
The most irritating feel you can get in a restaurant is you to be kept waiting for food. We certainly were made to wait a lot. I'd probably visit this restaurant again just to see if on normal days they are better. For now I can't give it more than 2.5/5.

I have been there just a few days ago. I was searching for some alternatives where I can have some quality pork preparations and I came across the name of this place. With such a high rating I really set my expectations high. 
But this place disappointed me to be honest. First of all the price didn't match to what have been given here on the app. Everything was ₹25/- to ₹30/- higher than what have been given here. 
But even with such a standard pricing, if not high, the quantity of food they provided were really low. We ordered one plate of Roasted Pork chilli, mixed Hakka noodles and pan fried chicken each. The quality of food was not bad but at the price which they are serving, a plate of chilli pork or pan fried chicken is not enough for two.

We visited this place for dinning & was greeted warmly however the later expirence was bitter.There is very little place & the food is not worth the price in terms of quality.The waiter is also inexperienced & has little idea about the menu mentioned.We ordered for chicken fried rice however the chicken was missing.Also there was little chicken in the soup we ordered.There is insufficient space with high food tariffs.Bad experience with a pocket pinch.

After a couple to days the resturant people decide to make amends & despite providing contact details didn't contact me by any means.

On the afternoon of mahastami visited this Chinese food joint with my friends. We were very hungry and as other restaurants had a long queue we prefered it. After few minutes we got our seats. The inside space is very small with sitting arrangement of about 20 people. As it was Durga puja so they have a special Durga puja menu which did not have much variety. We ordered for chili garlic noodles and diced chicken in black pepper sauce and chili fish for starter. The food quality is ok type but the starter disappointed us. Somehow this restaurant failed to impress me. Price was also high as per quality. Staffs are nice.

Food: visited thrice. tried their chilli garlic noodles which was hot & spicy. Drums of Heaven were "heavenly" indeed. Tried quite a portion of their veg delicacies that they offer & it tasted pretty amazing. This place is pocket friendly & takes only 5.8% service tax.

Last time We had a very bad experience when we went there and ordered Mixed Fried Rice and Fish in Chilli oyster sauce. Our food was not that good and we were very upset about that. 
But, Mr. Varun , the floor manager contacted us and personally invited us again. Today we went there and spent a wonderful evening with their delicious and well prepared food. 
Tried the same items that we had before and for starter, we ordered Drums of Heaven. 

Drums of Heaven tasted heavenly. 6 pieces of perfectly fried chicken. Served with a spicy red sauce.
Fried Rice was nicely cooked with lots of chicken, shrimps and eggs. It was more than sufficient for us.
Fish was also Well prepared and it was so soft that literally melted in our mouth. 

Staffs were very courteous. We were very satisfied by their wonderful gesture. Will definitely visit there to try their other items. Thank you once again 'China Wok'......

As they always say, "Looks are deceptive", and you will realize this truth after completing a whole-hearted meal at China Wok.. Probably Chinese joints have become a cliché thing for foodies in Kolkata, it's hard to detect the real jewels among the fake ones.. Glad that we made a right choice..this place isn't just about Chinese but authentic Thai at affordable pricing.. From the outside didn't get much confidence by the appearance.. a mere 4 seater located in the mezzanine floor, devoid of any ambiance or exquisite decor, but when the food arrives it left you awe-struck..
The service was good, though the server seemed a bit inexperienced, but he was extremely caring and helpful while ordering and serving the food.. Found some interesting Thai delicacy, so opted mostly for those dishes only:
Fresh Lime Soda: No scope for dissent.. as refreshing as you expect it to be..
Golden Fried Babycorn in Thai Sweet n Chili Basil Sauce: A long name for a nice and elegant dish.. crisp fried babycorns sauted in a traditional thai sauce.. loved the sweetness complemented by the chillis..
Crispy Prawn Garlic Pepper: Tiger prawns batter fried and finished with the hotness of pepper and the tanginess of vinegar, finished with wine.. loved the rich assortment of flavors in the dish..
Nam Prik Pow Kai: Undoubtedly the best of the lot.. the chicken was well cooked, crisp and crunchy on the outside and not at all fibrous..More like a traditional Pan Fried Chicken infused with the aromatic presence of lemongrass.. Passionately Recommended..
Khao Pad Kratiem Seafood: Thai fried rice finished with burnt garlic.. nice,long grains of rice nicely cooked to perfection.. loved the aroma of the dish.. gives you a subtle dose of flavors..
Pad Kee Mao Mixed: Rice Noodles cooked in a spicy hot sauce topped with bell peppers and basil leaves to give you the signature thai presence.. The portion was generous, the crunchy noodles and ample presence of proteins make it a delightful affair..
Neua Kae Pad Pak: Well this is a LAMB dish with roasted lambs cooked in an oyster sauce with vegetables.. the sauce was absolutely delicious.. silky, smooth and balanced in flavors.. also kudos for making the lambs so tender that they literally fell apart with the fork.. The richness of this dish goes well with the elegant burnt garlic fried rice..
Sliced Fish in Devil’s Sauce: Well this one ain’t for the faint-hearted.. strong, bold flavors that will give you the perfect kick to go well with the slightly bland thai staples..
Darsaan with Vanilla Ice Cream: The portions stood out for me.. We were 4 people but had tough time finishing two portions of this dish.. The darsaans were real crisp and flaky and even after a few minutes didn’t get soggy at all..
Overall I loved the fact that they prepare each and every dish with utmost care and perfection and it’s really tough to find much flaws in the recipes.. Only thing I felt, that they should really work to make their Desert Menu a bit more interesting.. Our total cheque was Rs. 2880/- (all incl.) for 4 people and given the number of dishes we ordered the price was surely justified.. Also the rates given on Zomato are old ones, not updated..
Food: 4.5/5
Pricing: 3.5/5
Service: 4.5/5
Ambiance: 3/5

Amidst all the eatery that you can find near Gariahat, China wok stands out to be pretty reasonable and delectable. The weird part is, there is no restroom. Excluding this, it is a fine place to dine in.
Eight treasure soup is really tasty and different.One Wok tossed hakka noodles would suffice for two and as usual, kung pao chicken is delightful. Staffs are well behaved too.

After seeing so much positive reviews about this Chinese restaurant, so we went there for lunch yesterday. But sorry to say, I am not hugely impressed with this place. It is located near triangular park, so its not hard to find. Its a small restaurant with kitchen on the ground floor. After we went there, the place was already full with one table left for two person(Only 4 tables). So we thought we were lucky enough to find a table but we were wrong. This place is so cramped, that we were trying different postures to sit on those chair, at that moment I was what the hell is going on.. Finally, one of those two waiters came to move the table little bit so that we can sit properly. Now, we ordered crispy konjee chicken, mixed meifoon and roasted pork in chilli soya sauce but instead they served pork in chilli soya sauce from the main course section, so  we were bit disappointed. But all the items were equally good. The crispy konjee chicken and the meifoon were too good, also the pork was very soft and the gravy was light. So the hype regarding this place is understandable because of the quality of food they are serving. But the quantity is not so great compared to the price they are charging. In fact, they have raised the price as because Durga Puja is nearing, so the menu you are seeing on zomato will not match when you visit here. Overall:
Quality- Great
Price- Not so pocket friendly
Service- Good, but needs to improve
Food- Authentic Tasty Chinese Food

This was a new find located near triangular park. The place is not hard to locate. The space inside is small, so it is not suitable for large groups. It's small, but the ambience is attractive.
Coming to the food, it was stunning. We concentrated around their pork dishes. We ordered Roasted Chili Pork with Baby Bak Choy as an appetiser and it was delightful. The fragrance and the aroma was enticing. For the main course, we ordered Mixed Singapore Meifoon, which turned out to be a little bland, but it wasn't bad. We also ordered Chili Soy Sauce Pork, Devil's Sauce Pork, Moo Pad Prik Kraprow, Moo Gra Tiem, Moo Pad Pak, the latter three also pork dishes. Without question, the best among these was the Devil's Sauce Pork. It was the right amount of spicy and sauce itself was amazing. Chili Soy Sauce Pork was standard, like that served in other Chinese restaurants, not anything special. Moo Pad Prik Kraprow was spicy and prepared in Thai style. The aroma was lovely and it added to the strong flavor of the dish. The other two were a little on the lighter side of the palette. Moo Gra Tiem was prepared with a strong garlic taste and the mushrooms were a lovely addition. Moo Pad Pak was prepared in oyster sauce, and it was delicious.
Suggestion, the Devil's Sauce Pork is a must try here.
The staff is friendly and helpful and knows well how the attend to the customers. But the service itself is slow and it's advisable to keep asking them to speed the process along. The portion of the chow was very good but that of the pork dishes were a little on the lower side. They make that up with the taste and flavor.
Overall it's a good experience and would visit again soon.
It'd be better if they extend the place as it's a little too small. They'd attract more business as well.
And also improve on the serving time.

Except for the cramped up place, really freezing AC and a little slow service, the pork dishes were delicious. So were the starters. The staff was good and helping. Hope they try to expand the place a bit. It would be great. Hogged like crazy after so long. And yes play a fun game with the dish names. Its hilarious and good entertainment. Check the pork section specifically. This is all in good humor. Please don't take it seriously. :P Keep up the good food. :)

China Wok is a small restaurant nestled between Idli Express and Sudipa-r Rannaghor on Purnadas Road. We had gone there to try out some of the starters they had to offer,one Saturday evening. We ordered their Lemon coriander soup, chicken lollipop and their chili pork. All the items were delicious and freshly prepared. They maintain an impeccable quality while cooking.The chilli pork is highly recommended, though I felt the quantity of the dish could be slightly increased.  Our total bill was about Rs.765 inclusive of tax. We saw quite a few swiggy deliveries done during that time we were there .However I would  prefer going to the restaurant simply because of their great service. The waiter has very polite, and always had a smile on his face.The food was too delicious that we couldn't even wait to click pictures

This is a very small restaurant near Triangular Park, having mezzanine floor &16 seats. As a student , this restaurant is affordable, average price for everything. We ordered Prik Kai Sot Sai Thod as starter, it was lip smacking good and i am very sorry because I had not enough money to order one more plate. Then came Khao Pad Kraprow (veg), with its aromatic basil flavour, i think the veg version is quite better than the non-veg version as i tasted it before. With a side dish Moo Pad Prik Kraprow. It somehow tasted bland as I tasted it before in Thailand, but the pork was very soft as expected. Then came Pad Thai , like any other time, it was very good.... but I expect much more from them, those are: LEMON WEDGE, GREEN ONION, BEAN SPROUT AND SOME CHILLY FLAKES, served with pad thai. And at last the show stopper came.... Darsaan with vanilla icecream. It was the best darsaan I had in Kolkata, 50 out of 10 for Darsaan.

Visited this place on a Sunday evening with a hungry stomach and craving for some really awesome soup. Ordered for the Tom Yum soup and drums of heaven. The Tom Yum soup, when served, brought a good deal of water in my mouth. It was red in colour, and I could see the lime leaves and lemon grass which really made me jump with delight.It tasted delicious, with the right amount of spice, and the chicken chunks in the soup were soft and tasty. The drums of heaven, however, disappointed me a little bit as I found it to be a bit bland than my liking. But it wasn't bad either. But I'm definitely going to visit again for their Thai cuisine and soups.

China Wok is a surprisingly compact restaurant serving excellent Oriental cuisine. My friend and I were looking for a joint for a quick lunch around Triangular park and landed up here quite by chance. 
Located on Purna Das road behind Triangular park between Idly Express and Sudipar Rannaghor, its a compact two storied restaurant with 4 tables. 

It was just about 12 on a Sunday noon and we decided to dig straight into main course. We ordered Chicken Chili Garlic noodles, Tausi Chicken, Fresh lime soda and Thums up.

The drinks came in first. The fresh lime soda was fine but on the sweeter side.

The food was served in the next 10-15 minutes. The noodles tasted fantastic as the chili garlic flavour of the noodles was evident from the taste. 
The chicken was done in black bean sauce tossed with mushrooms. Result was excellent and paired well with the noodles. Quantity was adequate for two and satiated our taste buds fully. 

Service was excellent as well, the server was skilled and polite which is difficult to find in small stand alone restaurants. 

I was personally very happy with my experience at China Wok. I would definitely come back for the other items on the menu. Pricing is decent. Our bill was Rs 620

This place has been on my wish list for quite a long time now. Finally visited this place with my friend on Thursday! 

Location - Triangular park. Between Mr. Idli express and Sudipa'r rannaghor.

The interior is very simple yet beautiful. It's a very tiny place and they have utilized the little space to their best interests. Ambience wise I would score it 3!

Now coming to the food. We were two of us and we ordered :
• Tai pei chicken - this served as our starter and it was very well prepared. It had strips of chicken and was quite spicy. Very very tasteful. 
• Wok tossed mixed chow - full marks for this dish as well. Amazing proportions and there were plenty of shrimps and shredded chicken much to my delight. 
• Tao Chen chicken - this was our side dish and it had 10 pieces of chicken. Now you can definitely understand what I mean by the fact that China Wok has excellent quantity. This dish had a mild flavour and went well with the chow. It was very light and had a good amount of mushrooms in it. 

Pocket pinch - 760. Very affordable. Good food at good rates. 
Overall, it was a good experience and I will definitely visit again to try their pork dishes.

A sudden plan took us to China Wok... We arrived late after lunch hours so the restaurant was empty. It is a small place with 4 tables but the ambience is good.. We ordered chicken chilli garlic noodles and pork in chilli oyster sauce. Both the dishes were extremely good. The service was also prompt.
PS: The prices in this menu are not correct.

China Wok which is Lilliput by size but Brobdingnag by taste. China Wok means a versatile round-bottomed cooking vessel, originating from China. It was an Small limited seats restaurant which serves true taste of delicious Chinese and Thai Cuisine. .  It was situated back side of Triangular park. Just take your left (Hindustan park side) from their and in no time you see the Outlet.

A tiny restaurant located in Hindustan park, pretty close to the Mr idli express outlet.
The restaurant is divided between the kitchen at the atrium and the seating area above, on the first floor.
A max of 4 tables sum up the dining room.
The clanking noises from the kitchen below are a little bothersome.
I was here for a quiet Sunday dinner and between the two of us, we ordered the following-
1) mushroom salt and pepper- which was a good dish, though the mushrooms lacked a bit of crunch.
2) Garlic noodles- thin noodles cooked well in garlic and oil and tasted pretty well.
3) Paneer in mild garlic sauce which was delicious.

The portions were pretty good and overall I found the food to be delicious.

The staff was extremely courteous, special mention to Ramesh,who served with extreme care and hospitality.

Prices are very decent.

PROS- location, food, price
CONS- congested seating, lack of good desserts.

Its a tiny little joint with about 20 seats only. I walked in hungry to order a plate of mixed meifoon. The service time was about 20 minutes, but food was delightful. However the soft drink had ice cubes that had dirt embedded. That was the kill joy. However, the very humble staff took note of my complain and replaced my drink. Mr. Das had been a superb host waiting my table. A decent place, better than big names close by. Worth a visit.

This is by far one of the best chinese cruisine I have ever had . The place serves authentic Chinese dishes and the variety will just spoil you and you will be jumping over an elaborate menu of lambs ,porks ,chicken and fish !
This is absolutely a non- vegetarians delight.
I went here with a friend and the entrance really pleased me but I was disappointed to find out that the place is really very small for which I could not give it 5 .The decor is minimalistic and it gives you the feel of dining in China .

Situated near Hindustan park it is at a walkable distance from Gariahat .In order to reach this place you have to enter from the lane right opposite to Citi Style and beside the park.
We had a chicken chowmein from their special menu and a lamb dish with it .Truly enough the quality and the quantity are if superior quality .But the one that stole the show was their Dim-sum !!! One of the best dimsums I have had before .The bill was affordable at RS 781 .
I will recommend you to go here at least once if you love Chinese food .

“Big things come in small packages”. China Wok is a living example of this line. With so many joints opening up in the city, serving chinese and oriental food, its wonderful how the place has held its own and maintained its standard. Hats off to Varun and Shreya, for keeping at it and not for once being complacent and letting their foot off the pedal.

Great place to dine out or for casual eat out with friends and family. We went there for the first time and needless to say, the food is impressive. So does their service and behavior of staffs. We ordered Chicken hot and sour soup along with pan fried chilli chicken. It was yum!! The seating is limited but if you love Chinese fare, you will definitely keep coming back here for their delectable delicacies. Definitely a must try if you're feeling hungry near Triangular Park or Purna Das Road!

This restaurant is located alongside Triangular park on Purna Das Road. 

Ambience: 3.5/5: The ambience they have tried to create is nice, but due to the lack of space it lacks the ability to be really great. The dining area itself is on the 1st floor and the stairs are rather small and cramped. On the other hand the glass wall gives an excellent view and atmosphere, especially when it rains.

Price: 4/5: At first glance the price looks high, but when you see the quantity you realise that it is very much worth it. While not a student hangout, it's perfect for special occasions. 

Service: 4.5/5: The only reason for not getting a 5 in this is because the staff are a bit too attentive, with them standing in the tiny little room while you eat, continuously looking at you, you will tend to get a bit self conscious and distracted. But due to excellent training and friendliness the staff here are quite nice.

Food: 4.5/5: Coming down to the main category, the food was excellent. We ordered Fresh lime soda, which took the longest time to reach us out of all the dishes for some reason. The Sui Mai (dim sum) was extremely tasty, with a brilliant black pepper sauce. However the chicken was just bit overcooked and stiff.
The chicken rice was excellent as was the chicken pan fried noodles, however the dishes that stole the show for me were the Kung pao chicken and the pork in chili soy sauce. The pork was exquisite and tender, perfectly cooked, and the sauces in the chicken made this a complete meal.

For those of you wondering what the title phrase means, it’s “Love for Chinese Food“. As surprising as it may sound, the Indo-Chinese cuisine has its roots in Eastern India, and more specifically, in Kolkata. This tradition of cooking started in the City Of Joy decades ago, soon to spread over the rest of the country. Since then, this city has seen abundant restaurants serving Chinese cuisine, but there have been bugs and lags.

China Wok is one of those places where you would get delicious Asian Cuisine. Not only they think about the taste of the food but they look after your health by not using Ajina Moto in their preparations. This is something really rare as most of the places use it to enhance their taste. Located in Hindustan Park just beside Sudipa's Rannaghar and Mr. Idli Express this place is not a difficult place to find. It has been quite a few times I have visited this place and I have always had a good experience. I like their quality of raw materials, they are really good. I love their thai fish preparation which is just lovely. The momos here are juicy and worth trying out. Overall a great place to have some lovely pan asian dishes.

The Indian culinary world was affected by a new cuisine over 85 years ago. The first Indo Chinese restaurant Eau Chew opened in Kolkata. The inception of Chinese Cuisine was welcomed by the people of the country. Families came with curiosity to taste the new fangled cuisine of foreign origin, yet spicy and tasty like their own.

On a casual evening, my colleague and me planned to hop into this somewhat quaint and small food joint, tucked away from the noisy main road, only to be bowled over by the scrumptious food offered by China Wok at very affordable prices. For customers' information, they serve Thai cuisine too! Chicken Sui Mai, a delicacy that comes with a finger-licking coriander sauce, left me happy and content after a tiring day's schedule. Not to mention Pra Lad Prik, a Thai fish preparation, China Wok's special rice and lastly, minced chicken and mushroom cooked in black bean sauce, that definitely filled our tummies but not hearts! A perfect destination for an epicure, I long to be there soon till I end up savoring all that they have to offer!

A Well Seasoned Wok Indeed.

How many times have we decided not to “Judge a book by its cover” or in this case “a restaurant” but have failed to live up to our own resolution? Plenty of times already and this more or less seems to be a never seizing mistake. With oodles of new eateries surfacing through the food horizon in the city, there are a number of restaurants that we keep judging and they keep proving us wrong. One such establishment is the China Wok.

How to reach?

This place is right around Triangular Park. You can either access it through Purna Das Road, where you will find this restaurant nestled right between Sudipar Rannaghor and Idly express, on the footpath right before Triangular Park, or you can conveniently take the alley right opposite to City Style (Triangular Park, Stoppage) and take the first left. Very, very easy to locate.

Seating:

The restaurant has quite a space crunch, but they have tried not to make it their drawback. They have arranged the seating area on the 1st floor and have limited it by a seating capacity of 14-16. This has rescued the place from seeming over crowded.

Food:

The fact that the owners of the restaurant have their own share of preferences devoted either to the veg or the non-veg section makes the menu a great amalgamation of good vegetarian and non vegetarian dishes.
Beverages-
Since there were not many options under beverages, we settled for the safest and most refreshing option- Lime Soda (Sweet & salty). The drinks were pleasant and a welcomed relief from the sweltering heat, which we escaped moments ago.

For a party of 6, we did go a bit overboard with the ordering. We ordered 6 portions of the Eight Treasure soup, while we made our picks for the next course. The soup is light and not gloggy, yet maintains all the aesthetics that a thick soup should have. It comes with a healthy serving of chillies, vegetables, mushrooms and chicken in it.

Starters-

The next course saw use ordering the Chicken Momos, Pad Nam Prik Pow and the Pan Fried Chilli Chicken. While the chicken momo could do a tad bit better, I was completely floored by the other two dishes on the table. Surprisingly, all the non vegetarians on the table rushed to fill their plates with the Pad Nam Prik Pow, which is a Thai Vegetarian delicacy, with crispy fried veggies in Thai hot sauce. The veggies were nicely tossed with blistered chillies and kaffir lime leaves, both these ingredients pushing maximum flavour through the dish. The pan fried chicken was a granted hit.

Mains-

My vegetarian friends ordered Diced Potato & American Corn in Hot Garlic Sauce, vegetarian Thai Red Curry and steamed rice to go with both the dishes. When I tasted both of them, the Diced Potato did end up owning my preference. The rest of us, went forward and ordered-

-    Schezwan Fried Rice and Coriander Burnt Garlic Rice with Egg.
Though both the rice dishes were downright impressive, I had to side with the Schezwan. Perfectly balanced flavours, neither too hot, nor lacking the essential spiciness, the Schezwan did end up being everyone’s favourite.

-    Pla Prik Kraprow.
This dish mainly comprises of sliced fish, carefully batter fried and simmered for a couple of minutes in a beautifully aromatic and flavoursome gravy. The two main components of the dish that stood out, were the fish itself and the lime leaf flavour. The fish breaks in your mouth as soon as you put it there. The very second moment you start relishing the flavours thrown at you by the Thai herbs, basil and the chilli sauce. The lime Kaffir leaf brings all these flavours and aromas together and balances the dish beautifully. A must try for all.

-    Tai Chen Chicken.
Without a doubt, my favourite pick out of all the dishes on the table. The chicken is soooo well cooked and the sauce so nicely balanced that I could hardly resist myself for going in for seconds and thirds.  The combination of soya sauce, red chillies and peppercorn is a massive hit, yet does not blow your head off. I enjoyed the lovely warmth it left behind after I was done tasting it. This dish is one of the two reasons I will go back to China Wok for.

Dessert-

Since our previous courses almost filled us to the brim, we settled for only one dessert. We ordered two plates of Darsaan and what a great decision it was. One of the greatest tragedies that people who love darsaan have faced, include- the noodles being cold, not enough honey caramel on the noodles, noodles too thick and chewy and most devastatingly, very little or absolutely no ice cream.  Thankfully none of these were the case this time. Absolutely loved the Darsaan, which makes it my second reason for visit.

China Wok makes for a great destination for lunch time- office escapes or a casual eat out with friends and family.

Located right at Purna Das Road, between "Idly express" and "Sudipar Rannaghor", this restaurant anyday stands out of the crowd for the fantastic, mouth watering delights they serve. Initially the cramped up space inside may turn you down a bit, but what you need to remember is not to lose your focus from the reason for which you landed up here- 'the food'.
The interior decor is cool and simple, and the ambience too is peaceful. The service staffs are polite and courteous, but need to be a bit more focused and careful to their duty(Just an honest suggestion).
And now comes the ultimate USP of the place- The food. Genuinely mouth watering and yummilicious dishes is the reason for which this place deserve a special mention.
Among the wide range of delicious dishes, I would like to have the pleasure to name a few of the 'must have items', which you just can't afford to miss, if you are here. " Eight Treasure soup", "Steamed chicken momo", and "" Pia Prik Kraprow", are the names I'm talking about. And in dessert, don't give a miss to the awesome "Darsaan with ice cream", they prepare.
Overall, a must visit place for all the foodies out there.
Cheers.

Located in Hindustan Park. Just between Sudipa's Rannaghar and China Wok. This an easy locate! Happened to pass by the area and the red decor hit my eyes. The place looked interesting with a nice mezzanine floor. The place was quite full on a weekday. Kudos to the owner as she was visiting, looking n supervising it all. The food tasted really good. The noodles n the side dishes were worth ordering. The only problem was the non- availability of cool drinks, they were serving drinks at room temperature. The darsan's the best ever eaten..

China Wok is situated at Hindustan Park. Very easy to locate. In between a South Indian and a Bengali Restaurant, this place is sure making its mark steadily. The kitchen is on the left side while entering and a small sitting area is there as well on the top floor. People mostly get food packed from here. One has to be careful while going up as the stairs are a bit steep. The seating area is cozy and comfortable. The service is good and the orders are promptly taken. They serve both Chinese and Thai food here and the best  part is they DO NOT use Ajinomoto (MSG) to enhance the flavour. They believe the food itself will showcase its taste. A really good initiative and I do hope others follow this as well.
                                                                ...

For the food I would have given them a 3.5 because they used fresh meat and good quality sauces - though that should not qualify them as great indo-chinese cooks because even though Indo-Chinese cuisine is largely sauce-based - that is not the be-all and end-all of beautiful, aromatic indo-chinese food. But they got the basics right and I will appreciate them for that. 

However what I will not appreciate them for is the fact that they miscalculated their capacity and accepted a lunch booking for my friend's birthday party which consisted of about 10 ravenously appetized cantankerous women! so it got stuffy, hot and very very unpleasant to say the least. The waiters were on their toes but that did not help. We would have ordered more for the taste was not too bad as I have said before, but the prolonged, sultry anticipation was too much to take! In all it really ruined my impression of the place. Hence the 3.

However as a reviewer, I shall try to be objective and say that they are a moderately priced, tiny joint (mostly for takeaways or twin dining) that serves nice indo-chinese food. And there I shall rest my case.

A cozy little outlet specialising in chinese and thai cuisine located at a stone throw distance from triangular park. We decided to give this place a try after hearing from a frd. , and really the place proved to be worthy of the recommendation.
At the first go we ordered #Eight Treasure Soup#, It was a thick chicken suop rich in vegetables, mushroom, and chicken slices. I just loved the soup. This proved to be an apt appetizer. 
In the main course we ordered #Coriander and Burnt Garlic Egg Rice# and #Pla Prik Kraprow#( A fish dish in thai chilli Sauce gravy)
The qantity of the rice was sufficent for two and perfectly complimented the fish side dish.
And
The Pla Prik Kraprow proved to be mouthwateringly delicious!! It will recommend this dish to everyone. Totally fell in love with the gravy enriched with kaffir lime and herbs and basil, the fish was also fresh and soft and juicy.
Now for the dessert, without a second thought we ordered #Darsaan with Ice Cream#. I just love Darsaan and have tried this sweet dish in many a places. I can say  the one served in this restaurant is the best!! The Darsaan was crisp, not overtly sweet, and complimented the vanilla ice cream. 
All in all it was a lovely dinner, and i will surely revisit the place to try the other dishes served here.

Went to  China wok a few days ago with my cousins for lunch .. its a pretty good restaurant   but has very less space.. Hardly 20 people can sit at a time in that particular floor. 

Coming to food - The quality of food is very good.. but quantity is quite less ! So order accordingly.. and if you want to try any fish item then you can go for Pla Gra Tiem and if you would  like to taste something different from the other  conventional Chinese  chicken preparation ... then must go for Kai Pad Prick Krapow (amazing taste of basil and other herbs).

The lane attached to triangular park leads to this restaurant (just beside Sudipa's Rannahor, Purna Das Road). The place is quiet small, just four tables. But needless to say staff and their service is worth mentioning. Ordered Drums of heaven, Chili Garlic Noodles, Kung Pao Chicken. The food was nice and quantity shareable. Pocket punch moderate, around 750 INR for two (including vat & service charge). Worth visiting again.

The place is really small buy nicely decorated. I like the red decor and the hanging lights but the space is little clumsy.Reaching this place is very easy. Ambience is pretty average. Service is prompt. Food is really good as per the price. I can't say authentic Chinese but it's indeed tasty Chinese food. I have many favourite dishes. Hard to narrow it down. Had this been a little bigger place would recommend everyone to visit this place.

I love chinese food, so my birthday lunch definitely demanded a visit to one of the restaurant featured in "Great Chinese" collection and here I was. This small eatery is located in Hindustan Park, very easy to locate. The seating area is in upstairs, not a big place but well organized. Service is pretty good. Now the food :

#For starter we had Roasted pork in chilly soi sauce. Tasted good but lacked the spicy punch. The pork was slightly over cooked I guess  which made it chewy. Definitely there's a big room for improvement.

#For mains we had Chicken pan fried noodles with Pla Gra Tiem. The noodle smelled fresh, quite palatable. Pla gra tiem is a Thai fish dish which tasted delicious. The fish was cooked to perfection, had a beautiful flavour of burnt garlic and black pepper. The one and only let down was both the dishes had gravy, so not a perfect combination. But both tasted great separately. 

All in all a good experience with barely any pocket pinch. Will surely visit again !!

Located on the opposite side of triangular park, this small restaurant is definitely going to impress you with their food. Went there for Thai food and must say they had made each and every dish perfectly. Service is pretty good too. The welcoming gesture of the owner was indeed pleasing. It is a must try for Thai cuisine!

Situated near Triangular Park, China Wok, promises you and your friends great oriental cuisine, and even better Thai delicacy than many places of Kolkata. China Wok is one of those rare oriental places with friendly and prompt service, and it's perfect for small groups of friends or for a family gathering.

This is one of those spots you should keep in your back pocket as the go-to place for any team celebrations — for a number of reasons. First, it's conveniently located near Gariahat area, just a short walk away from Triangular Park bus stoppage. Second, the food is both good AND affordable; I better say perfect matching of quantity and price, especially their beautifully-cooked Pla Pad Pak.

The atmosphere here is laid back and casual, ideal for catching up with good friends or for a team meal. The space allows for 10 – 12 pax to dine comfortably together.

We order chilled fresh lime soda to get things going, after some discussion we finally decided to try their signature dishes from menu. As appetizers we ordered Crab Meat Soup and Yen Ta Foh. Side by side in starters we selected Pan Fried Chilli Fish, Prawn Sui Mai and Prik Kai Sot Sai Thod. For main course Kai Himaparn, Pla Pad Pak, Khao Pad Kratiem Chicken and Pad Kee Mao Mixed. For desserts we went for Darshan as advised by their staffs.

With the philosophy that a decent, hearty soup starts every meal, we started with, Yen Ta Foh (Traditional Thai Soup with seafood, rice noodles and red sauce) and Crab Meat (Thick and creamy soup with crab meat and egg) soups. First sip and felt Yen Ta Foh was splendid. You couldn't and wouldn't go wrong ordering this classic seafood noodle soup - rich & flavourful broth, tender sliced seafood, fresh bean sprouts, red sauce and rice noodles, you might find yourself slurping it all up before you even realise.

Side by side super flavourful Crab Meat soup also had the right amount of spice and tang. This dense and smooth soup with shreds of crab meat and egg was astonishingly tasty. Crab Meat soup was tangy yet subtly sweet, and will kick your butt with its mild spiciness.

Here, the soup base is light yet uncompromising on flavour, even before all the juicy goodness from the meats gets into the soup.

Next in starters we dig into their irresistible Pan Fried Chilli Fish and fall in love with the fresh gooey Shallow fried fish served with sautéed onions, chillies and scallions — so good you’ll want to lick the bowl clean!

Get the Prawn Sui Mai, which are deep fried, crusty, bite-sized balls of minced prawn meat, paired with coriander chilli oil. This Crispy thin wrapped minced prawn was marinated properly in a special aromatic sauce, deep fried, massive, and not for the faint hearted. Coriander chilli oil was perfect dips for this dish; you will feel your taste buds getting rebooted after every bite.

The Prik Kai Sot Sai Thod was cooked perfectly — crisp around the edges and moist in the centre, so it gives just the right amount of crispy and gooey in every mouthful. Don't miss these Thai style chicken wings to snack on, it's really addictive.

A trip here wouldn’t be complete without trying at least one of their remarkable starters, guaranteed to be cooked perfectly and tossed in rich, flavour-packed sauces.

Thai style sliced chicken Kai Himaparn was highly aromatic and spicier; also sautéed with onions and cashew nuts, it was overwhelming in both texture and flavour combination. So we choose to pair it with Pad Kee Mao Mixed, blending of hot chillies with seafood, chicken, egg and onions. This spiced rice noodles infused with chilli, bell peppers and basil was also wonderfully prepared. Without feeling compromising with our taste buds; the combination goes surprisingly well.

Pla Pad Pak, fresh fish sautéed with mixed vegetables in oyster sauce and dusted with spices. You won't be able to stop munching on the Pla Pad Pak. The fish was fresh and steamed to perfection, and the gravy... hot, spicy and salty, this was one feisty fish.

Throw all caution to the wind and combine Khao Pad Kratiem Chicken with Pla Pad Pak. Don't miss the distinct flavour of Khao Pad Kratiem Chicken, Thai fried rice, topped with flavourful, juicy grilled chicken, mushrooms and burnt garlic.

Certainly recommended the lip-smackingly delightful Kai Himaparn and as well as flavourful and smooth Pla Pad Pak. Portions are generous here so be sure to bring more friends (or a big appetite)!

Finally it’s time for desserts and we end our meal with Darsan with Ice cream. Crisp deep fried flour chips tossed with honey and sesame seeds served with vanilla ice cream perfectly sealed the treat. The crunch, texture and taste of the Darsan were beautiful and definitely made a charming dessert to finish off the meal.

This humble eatery at the corner of Triangular Park in Purna Das Road is always packed on the weekends with families happily tucking in, and with good reason. You'll understand why, once you try their signature dishes - Prawn Sui Mai, Pla Pad Pak, Kai Himaparn and Pan Fried Chilli Fish. With pleasant service and honest, good food, you'll be back.

Kindly note that every dish China Wok serves is AJINOMOTO FREE.

Nestled between Idli Express and Sudipa's Rannaghor in Triangular Park, is China Wok. A hoard of new eateries have come up in and around that area in the past few months, and China Wok was in my wish list for quite some time. Finally, I went there a few days back on an invitation to PanchPhoron.

The seating area isn't too big, but their kitchen is well organized indeed. We started our meal by three of their soups. The Crab Meat Soup was pretty good, and had ample crab meat in it. However, a little more crustacean flavor in the body itself would have taken it a notch higher. The Lemon and Burnt Garlic Soup is a perfect one for cold winter evenings, and had a sharp tang. But the best of the lot was the 9 Treasure Soup, with little nuggets of treasure in every biteful.

Then came the starters. The Pan Fried Chilli Chicken and the Thai Style Chicken Wings, both were juicy, sticky and succulent but the Crispy Baby Corn wasn't too crispy. But the best was saved for the last. The Prawn Dumplings, with the paper thin coating and heavenly stuffing, were out of the world, no kidding!

The Kung Pao Veggies were okayish, and I was clearly more interested in the Sliced Fish in Garlic and Black Pepper Sauce. The latter hada clean flavour base, and the fish itself was fresh and flaky. Their noodles didn't impress me much, be it the Chilli Garlic or the Pad Thai, but the Coriander and Burnt Garlic Egg Rice was good. The Steamed Rice with the Thai Red Curry is my ultimate comfort food, and they did absolute justice to it.

The warm, crispy, sticky darsaan with the cold, creamy ice-cream brought a happy ending to a happy meal.

P.S. China Wok doesn't use Ajinamoto (Monosodium Glutamate) in any of its dishes, and is hence safe for children, pregnant women and every one else too! So happy hogging!

Checked in for another unplanned dinner last night. Space upstairs is too small with Only four tables for four. They took quite a long time to serve as well. We opted for CHICKEN TAI PAI in starters which had about 8 small cubes of chicken in a pan fried in a spicy sauce . We moved on to thai for mains,
With PLA GRA TIEM , preparation of fish with black pepper garlic sauce and
RAAD NAH , thai fried rice noodles with vegetables, both of which tasted similar and equally bland. They really need to work on their thai recipes . Quantity wise food would just suffice two people with medium apetite. Our old favourite Hatari , Chowman and china calling nearby are doing much better in competitive prices .

China Wok deserves a 5.0 rating, but I didn't rate them so... I'll tell you why, but before that, let me express my heartfelt praises for this small, humble eatery.
Its a very small room on the 1st floor, having only four 4-seater tables, a glass wall overlooking Purna Das Rd, the lane outside... Humble decorations consisting of a few quotes on the walls. Everything is so neat about this place, you enter from the ground floor gate, past the billing counter, the kitchen, up the narrow wooden staircase, into the dining room.
The food was just awesome, no complaints regarding taste, quantity or service.. Food was sufficient for two, waiters were cordial and aware. We ordered Mixed seafood rice, Roasted chilli pork, and Chicken drums of heaven. All were different and satiating enough.
Now guys, coming to the only negative aspect... Please arrange for a washroom. It is not possible to have drums of heaven without soiling the palm, and afterwards, napkins and hand-sanitizers did not serve the purpose.

I revisited China Wok on receiving a Summer offer of 10% discount on any order of Rs.1000+. I had called to reserve a table at 9.00pm.. We were there on time, but the restaurant folks could not get us a table before 9.20pm. They did apologise and also offered us some free chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream, for dessert! That is appreciated a lot, and we enjoyed all of their items to the last bit.
The Sui Mai with a special dip and the Thai rice noodles deserve special mentioning... All great, lipsmacking Chinese and Thai preparations... In the end, to compensate for the lack of a wash-basin, they provided us with hot-water bowls too...!! You have won our heart.. See you soon..

Had a wonderful time here with friends... and the owners Sherya and Varnu's presence during our visit makes it an awesome one... they both are very good hearted, innocent and extremely well behaved people... they suggested and guided us throughout... intero was very decent... clean and clear ambience... there kitchen was very clear and hygienic... which I liked very much... they are suffering from space crunch although there location was extremely good... staffs are also very well mannered but seems bit tensed, don't know why... whatever coming to the food we tried a large nos of dishes... 1. Crab meat soup... good one with thick creamy texture with crab meat and egg, but u think crab meat was bit little in quantity... 2. Lemon & burnt garlic soup... pretty ordinary, will be better if it will comes with some more exotic veggies... 3. 8 Treasure soup... Excellent one, a must try, it comes with exotic seafoods and definitely will make you feel full... 4. Pan fried chilli fish... tasted good, the fish was very fresh... 5. Prik kai sot sai thod... Thai style chicken wings... I liked it very much, very tasty... 6. Crispy chilli babycorn... a set back, not at all crispy... 7. Prawn sui mai... awesome, a must try...  8. Kung pao vegetables... nothing special but I liked it too... 9. Pla gra tiem... another excellent fish preparation, sliced fish in garlic & black pepper sauce... 10. Kaeng ped chicken... nothing but spicy Thai red curry... just Muhaaa, out of the world, the best red curry I ever had... 11. Coriander & burnt garlic egg rice... very good, goes well with fish dish... 12. Chilli garlic noodles... not at all good, need a lot of improvement... 13. Streamed rice... it's bit sticky, need to be more " jhur jhure", but gone well with Thai red curry... 14. Pad Thai... very upsetting... not at all good... I had all these with diet coke... now a gr8 information... they dosent use AJINOMOTO... instead of that they use some homemade spice... isn't it gr8... we ended our treat with 15. Darsaan with vanilla ice cream... this item needs no mention, it's just excellent... overall it's a good experience... although I want to give them 3.5 but Sherya and Varnu's behavior and there AJINOMOTO free concept helps them to get 3.75... and the last .25 is because we enjoyed so such over here... I think there Thai preparations are quite good and also the fish preparation are praise worthy... but they need to work on there Chinese part... lastly pocket pinch was quite acceptable... Every one can give it a try...

Been there for dinner with couple of friends. Earlier I tried some of their food by Foodpanda so this time I tried various kind of dishes from their menu.. 

8 treasures soup was great mixture of seafood, vegetables flavour. 

 Pan fried Chilli were very delicious

Prawn sui mui were just excellent, juicy prawn  dumplings with very unique and good taste.

Pla Gra Tiem was a fish preparation tossed in Garlic and black pepper sauce. Taste was just mind blowing. But somehow i felt extra cornflour on that preparation. 

Kaeng Ped Chicken was a thai chicken red curry made with coconut milk and lemon grass. I don't like the taste at all.

Chilli garlic noodles was pretty average and little bit oily.

Ice Cream with darshan was just awesome and I enjoyed that so much.

I went to China Wok with a couple of friends for dinner. The owner Varun and Shreya were very polite and helpful the entire time. Thank you both for the great experience.

They have NO AJINA MOTO policy. So, all you health conscious people, this is the place for you.

Location : At triangular park more. Located between Idly Express and Sudipar Ranna Ghor. Very easy to locate.

Ambiance : Once you enter you will have to walk upstairs to the sitting area. At a time a maximum of 20 people can sit together. The place is adorned by motivational quotes, there isn't much of any other decor. But they are clean.

Staff : The staff were very attentive and friendly.

Food and Drinks :
1. Crab Meat Soup : Deliciously creamy with crab meat and egg. Though i found that crab meat was given stringently.
2. 8 treasure Soup(sea food) : This was the best soup of the evening. This has a healthy quantity of sea food and veggies. Must try if you are here.
3. Lemon and Burnt Garlic Soup : This soup had a strong flavor, which i loved. But didn't have much of veggies, which was a let down.
4. Pan fried Chilli Fish : Very Very delicious. If you are here do not miss this. The lightly fried fish blended well with the flavors of onion and chills.
5. Prik Kai Sat Soi Thod(Thai chicken wings) : This was pleasant and came in good portions. Thai sauces mixed well with the chicken, to create a tasty concoction.
6. Prawn Sui Mai : Best starter that we had. These are prawn dumplings. I was completely enthralled by its tastes and aroma. The coating was thin and the inside prawn was juicy. The spices mingled so well with the prawn that you will be kept asking for more.
7. Kung Pao Vegetable: Exotic Veggies tossed in roasted cashews. This was nice, my friends loved it.
8. Pla Gra Tiem : Thai preparation, sliced fish in garlic & black pepper sauce. This fish was again totally mouth-watering. Exotic spices mixed with fresh fish, a complete must try if you are ever here.
9. Kaeng Ped Chicken: Chicken in Spicy Thai Red Curry. This was totally mind blowing. One of the best thai red curries I have had. Again, please try this if you are here.
10. Coriander and Burnt Garlic Rice : This was a little oily, but nice flavors.
11. Chilly Garlic Noodle : This was kinda bland and a let down. But this came in good portions.
12. Steamed Rice : A perfect match for the thai red curry.
13. Pad Thai : This was again a let down. The flat noodles were bland and had no flavors. But the portions were good.
14. Ice cream with darshan : This was completely and totally delicious. The quantity was great(good for two persons) and tasted totally totally yummy. The darshan was sweet and crunchy at the same time. The ice cream blended well with the flavor of the darshan.
15. Fresh Lime Soda : This was nice and came in good quantity.

China wok - the name itself gives you the hint what kind of food they offer. Specialized in Chinese,Thai and Oriental dishes this place is a hidden gem of Kolkata. I read some mixed reviews abt the place but most of the low scoring reviews are due to service mishap not for the food certainly. So that's why gave it a try

USP: 
1. They say NO to AJINOMOTO
2. Vegetarians are served pure veg even the noodles are not egg based
3. Ethical business process

Location:
Located at the Hindustan park. After passing the gariahat crossing then take left from the second signal on the way to desopriyo park crossing and then right.
Parking is available no problem with that.

Decor and Ambience: it's a small restaurant with a small sitting capacity. I liked the way they decorated the place with nice lamp shades hanging over the staircase. Simple and cute.

Food: I personally feel that they have a very different style and taste which makes it standing out from the usuals. 
Soups
Crab meat soup: It's the second best ..u can have a flavour of raw crab into it.

Lemon and burnt garlic soup: It's a clear soup it can instantly make you feel good if u r nt well you have got cold or smthg.

Eight treasures soup : Best soup available in the menu

Starters:
Crispy babycorn: Nicely cooked.. Its aptly made as I got the soft babycorn feel inside.

Thai style chicken wings: Decent taste and tossed in right sauce 

Pan fried chilli fish: Fish was fresh and very well prepared. Recommend

Prawn Sui mai : Divine I would rather say..must try this. MUST TRY :)

Main course:
Kung Pao vegetables: Veggies with cashew in tasty kung pao sauce.

Pla gra tiem: Sliced fish cooked in garlic and black pepper sauce. Quality of fish was so amazing and tasted real gud with the fried rice.

Kaeng ped chicken: Thai style chicken Red curry( Best one) Must try.. Was super yummy..
MUST HAVE

Chilli garlic noodles: nicely prepared very well done. Just the noodles here are little thin.

Coriander burnt garlic rice : Good point is the rice was not sticky .. Very well prepared and adding American corn was a nice idea .
Steamed rice: Usual but very well presented.

Pad Thai: Flat noodles tossed in Thai sauce with chicken and prawn tasted well. Though some of you might yet a smell of fish oil but that's what makes it authentic but if you like it without that just ask for it they will help out on this.

Desserts
Darshan with ice cream: Yummy one.. Darshan was very crispy and super awesome

Beverages:
Fresh lime soda: Refreshing

Service:
The stuffs are very helpful and well trained ...very prompt and courteous indeed. 
I loved their service and behavior. The owners Shreya and Varun are very enthusiastic and loves to serve their customers the best. Indeed appreciable!!! Good work guys :)

It was a nice experience here overall. Must try their Thai dishes ..very unique..:)

Well this place was certainly an eye opener for me because I always assumed that the kind of Chinese eateries located in Gariahat/Hindustan Park area catered mainly to the Bengali taste buds.But this turned out to be completely different and I was really glad that I was invited to this place for food audit as part of team Panchphoron!!!
                                                                ...

The small shack will bag few points with the huge selection of dishes. What I liked about the restaurant is the sincere apology for the non availability of the fresh stuff. As a return they served with a perfect brownie with ice cream . The lamb was really mouth watering .Perfect place for Chinese foodies.

To start off, I usually do not rate any restaurant, this high, but China Wok deserves most part of it!
Bored and having nothing to do, I hit up Zomato and googled for the directions to this place! Having read all the amazing reviews by the expert foodies, this one was in my list for a long time! And I must say, I wasn't disappointed!

Coming to the location, anything in and around Golpark, like Hindustan Road, Purna Das Road, Sarat Bose Road, had always been a labyrinth to me. I usually find it apprehensive to go far away from my place and keep on roaming around like a vagabond not knowing the correct route to my destination.

This is where Zomato and Google Maps, came to my rescue. To reach this place, one needs to get down at Triangular Park, and if he is coming from Gariahat, take the lane going to your left from Triangular Park Crossing. Walk for 1 minute at the most and then you will see another lane going to your left. To this left, you will find Idli Express, China Wok and Sudipar Rannaghor followed by some car accessories shop tucked one after the other. Alternatively, you can also come from the lane opposite to Basanti Devi College if you are thorough with lanes.

This restaurant particular restaurant is pretty deceptive in its look! While it does give you the impression of classy decor and somewhat fine dining, you get to realise, how small the area is, only when you enter the restaurant. The ground floor houses a narrow passage, so narrow that you get to remember the bylanes of some hidden 'Goli' at North Kolkata. To your left, you would see an enclosed cooking area. The stairs will be right in front of you using which you need to make way to the first floor. Be aware, the stairs are really steep. If not while going upstairs, you would definitely feel the steepness while descending down.

As soon as you hop on to the first floor, reality beckons as how small the dining area is. The first thing which would probably come to realisation is the number of tables and the number of chairs available respectively. If I remember correctly, there were a total of 5 tables comprising a total of 16 chairs. But then, your sensuality beckons and you realise how simple yet lovely the decor is. Nice and clean walls radiating the charm of elegance. On one side of the room, you could even see some quotes being displayed over the wall through a photo-frame!

As soon as i entered, I found the place almost vacant other than a cute couple who were engrossed in their own sweet talks. I took the middle table, put in centre, as suggested by the waiter and sat down. Slowly, I realised how awkward my position was, as I was proving to be an invasion to privacy to the couple. Seeing the rest of the tables vacant, I found it prudent to shift to another side and make myself more comfortable.

I was already familiar with the menu put up here by Zomato and browsing through all the amazing reviews by the Connoisseurs here, I was pretty much sure on what to order. This, however included some last minute changes. 

Had tried just two items for dine-in. First being, Chicken Tai-Pei under Non-Vegetarian starters. I have a huge liking for Crispy Chicken and I must say, this dish was much beyond my expectations. Succulent pieces of chicken, with a thin and crispy batter perfectly sauted with onions and chilli. The sauce was sticky and the chicken was oozing with juice! It was pretty evident, that this dish was freshly prepared helping to retain the crispiness and surprisingly the juicy texture. Although, being a 'Bheto' Bengali, I wished if it had a generous amount of honey drizzled on it, something on the likes of Honey Chicken Lollypop by Grub Club! The portion was more than sufficient and enough for 2 people!
 This dish was go irresistibly good that it almost made me yarn to crave for a repeat order but I was determined enough to control my temptations! 

The last one was China Wok Tossed Chicken. Although the menu card suggested it would be flavored with dry red chilies and red wine, I found them both lacking or rather missing from the dish. I did ask the waiter to make this dish less spicy, as spice and myself do not exactly go hand-in-hand! However, the flavor was lacking and appeared altogether to be a milder version of Chilly Chicken!

I inquired from the person attending me as to why this particular dish lacked crispiness, to which I was told that the chicken pieces are already kept fried for this dish, and the same are simply tossed in the required gravy. Truth be told here, this particular dish also appeared to be a bit cold as it had lost the optimum temperature. Furthermore, after the extremely sumptuous dish I have had earlier, I wasn't ready to believe that the latter one didn't have anything wrong. It could also have been just heated up and being served. 

Nevertheless, by this time my parcel had arrived. The bill came to a total of Rs. 1500/- (approx). I gladly paid my bill, kept the tips as gesture and made my way home. 

Coming to my take-away, I had ordered for, Kai Pad Med Memong, Koong Pad Pak and Khao Pad Kratiem for a late night dinner! Now Kai Pad Med Memong,, as the menu suggests, is supposed to be diced chicken saughted with roasted cashewnuts cooked in a spice sauce.. What I got was an extremely rich gravy, something on the likes of Chicken Tikka Masala, with chicken pieces, kinda hard. The gravy was very much oily and it gave me a look as if I am supposed to take a dive in at all the richness and oilyness. The cashews were mostly lost and nowhere to find. Come on I am supposed to have Noodles and Fried Rice with a side dish. Do you expect me to scoop out oodles of gravy with my roti like Noodles and finish the entire gravy? (Picture posted separately). I can perhaps once in a while live with spicyness but not with something filled up with unnecessary oil. This was, by far the most disappointing dish. 

Next in line was Koong Pad Pak. As one of the Connoisseurs here had remarked, what can go wrong with Fish and Oyster Sauce!  I can't speak about Fish, but Oyster Sauce happens to be one of my favorite as well! This dish was light, yet flavorfull! The chunks of fish were fish, coated in light batter. The pieces weren't falling off either! It had a mild yet such a delightful taste! Clearly shows that fresh ingredients were used here and the cooking process differs extensively from other Chinese Restaurants/Pan-Asian Restaurants where all you get is a dub-mash of your desired order!

To accompany both the side dishes, I had opted for Khao Pad Kratiem. This happens to be a Burnt Garlic Rice, prepared in Thai Style. The rice was light tossed in a subtle sauce. The garlic complemented the rice pretty well. It wasn't overpowering. The Thai ingredients also played a perfect co-host and did not dominate other flavors. All in all, this was a perfect choice to go with the Oyster Fish! I wanted to opt in for some deserts while I was in the restaurant, but having order this much, I decided it was better not to overstuff myself. 

Would I want to visit again? => Definitely Yes! There are multiple dishes, which I have heard so much about, so many dishes which the menu portrays to be beckoning. The staff here are very courteous and humble. Although, they need to keep check of the temperature of the food before serving it to the customers. Furthermore,  dishes like Crispy Chicken which I had, should be served afterwards. This is one such dish, which if we have right at first would clearly overpower the other Chicken starters and make them look bland!

I wish, I could give an entire 5. But, I cannot. Firstly, the disappointment regarding two dishes, one at dine-in and one for take-away! Secondly, I found that the extreme back portion at the first floor, which is near to the glass, portrays a physical threat! There appears to be some sort of gap between the floor and the glass casing and if not being extremely careful, can lead to some sort of accident.
My last issue here is charging of service tax for take-aways. Most restaurants, be it established or smaller ones, refrain from charging service tax for take-away's and home delivery ( I am speaking about Service Tax and not Service Charge). Instead, I was here billed together, with both Service Tax (+VAT) on both the dine-in order and take-away.

Upon pointing this to the waiter, he accepted that it wasn't right but apologized that nothing could be done regarding this as they do not have a separate system for this. I was also told, that China Wok is supposedly coming with a branch of their at Sector-I, Salt Lake; which is where I live. Evidently, I would be taking a lot of take-away's and home deliveries. I would be extremely displeased if I am charged service tax for every take-away's I do. Management, having the classy restaurant you have successfully established, please look into this.

To end, a perfect Pan-Asian/Chinese restaurant offering delectable and sumptuous Chinese Meal at extremely affordable price. Would definitely go back here for some finger-licking goodness. Although, some promotions/discount coupons would be of great assistance. :-)

A pretty new yet well organized restaurant. The sitting area is a bit small in the mezzanine floor with the roof height being very low.
The staff were really friendly and gentle. The food was served pretty fast and was actually good. Really well made and garnished. 
The decorations, surrounding, table set up and service was really good. I liked the place. 

If you're one of those Chinese food lovers who loves going to different Chinese places, this is surely a must visit.

Well this place was certainly an eye opener for me because I always assumed that the kind of Chinese eateries located in Gariahat/Hindustan Park area catered mainly to the Bengali taste buds.But this turned out to be completely different and I was really glad that I was invited to this place for food audit as part of team Panchphoron!!!

This is located very close to triangular park...one can actually use their GPS to track this place if you are not familiar with the narrow lanes...

It's a small 2 floored eatery...not a fine dining restaurant...but it still has a very homely feeling to it.At a time 15-16 people can be seated on the 2nd floor,the first floor having the kitchen.

We were served with fresh lime soda,which was pretty okay...considering the fizz ran out.So,I switched to normal Coke.

Soup:-
I had their Crab Meat soup which I found excellent.There were solid pieces of crab accompanied with egg drop.Being a seafood lover,I absolutely loved the fact that unlike most restaurants,they used generous amount of Crab meat!!!

Starters:-
Pan Fried Chilli Fish-The fish was perfectly cooked and soft.It seemed fresh.This dish isn't too spicy as one might expect,hence could be tried by everyone.

Prawn Sui Mai-The minced prawns were seasoned well and not overcooked..Also,the coriander chilli oil went pretty well with it.The vegetarian version of Sui Mai too was quite good...

Babycorn in Thai Sweet & Chilli Basil Sauce-This was good but nothing exceptional.

Prik Kai Sot Sai Thod-These Thai Style Chicken wings were an absolute delight.It had a certain sweetness to it,but did not overpower the spices.Definitely worth trying.

Mains:-

Bok Choy Delight-This had Bok Choi as well as Brocolli.It was mildly spicy and hence can be tried by non-spicy lovers as a side dish.

Kai Himaparn-Sliced chicken tasted just fine.This wasn't anything exceptional.

Pla Pad pak-This was a clear winner for me!!!It had two of my favourite ingredients ie Fish and Oyster Sauce hence this can hardly ever go wrong for me.The fish was extremely soft and of good quality.

Khao Pad Kratiem Chicken-I absolutely love Thai Burnt Garlic Rice and this too didn't dissappoint me at all.Love the flavours and the aroma of Garlic which again luckily did not overpower the dish.

Khao Pad Kraprow-This is a basil fried rice and tasted good with the gravy dishes mentioned above.

Pad Kee Mao Mixed-This again was good.It had a strong aroma which one could get even while eating it.The noodles were boiled well.

Deserts:-
Darsaan with Ice Cream-Very few places can go wrong with this.Hence,they too did justice to this dish by preparing the flour chips fresh and served them crispy.

After our meal,we had a chat with the owners who said that they had to make some of the Thai dishes mild because of the Indian palette.Hence,if anybody wants a version closer to the actual Thai cuisine,they should mention it before ordering.

And yes,this restaurant is a place I would personally visit again with my friends and family..

Location: Adjacent to Mr. Idli Xpress; A few meters from Vivekananda Park.

The last few months have seen a rise in the number of startups in different areas across different categories & following suit is China Wok, an Oriental cuisine restaurant. Happened to visit this place over dinner. Upon entrance, it was found that this place suffered from a space constraint and could barely seat sixteen heads at one go. Spread across two levels, the ground floor houses the kitchen and reception whereas the mezzanine housed the dining area. The stairs leading to the dining area were found to be pretty steep and to help people climb, there are short rail supports on the side. The frames across the textured wall and the laser-cut hanging lights added to the AMBIANCE. The extreme negatives to the ambiance were the not-so-clean table mats and the neglected dirty tables. Such sights, barely a few away, throughout your dining experience just sends across a bad impression. The tables might not be awaiting occupancy, but, that doesn't mean they can be left soiled (pictures attached for reference).

Talking about the FARE, the widespread menu was cleanly drafted across the Thai & Chinese Cuisine. The following was called for:

- Manchow Soup (Veg)
A well-prepared soup with the right amount of crisp noodles on top. Tasted nice.

- Eight Treasure Soup (Veg)
Assorted vegetables (including mushrooms) in a flavorful broth and served boiling hot. Was delicious to taste! Recommended.

- American Corn Pepper Salt
Batter-fried and tossed along with sautéed onion and springs. Well-seasoned with salt n' pepper. Was decent to taste. 
The batter, however, was of a thicker consistency than required due to which the frying process resulted in cracking away of the batter coating. A thinner consistency of the well-seasoned batter is expected so as to keep the binding intact.

- Crispy Vegetables in Plum Sauce
The dish consisted of an assortment of fresh vegetables (likes of Babycorn, Zucchini, Mushroom, Cauliflower) deep-fried and tossed in chilli plum sauce. The sweetness level in the chilli plum sauce was way higher resulting in the subtle spiciness being overpowered. All that tasted was the sweetness. Nevertheless, the vegetables were crisp and nicely wok-tossed Tasted just about nice. The perfect balance of flavors could be worked upon. 

- Wok Tossed Hakka Noodles (Veg)
Perfectly boiled noodles tossed along with fresh juliennes of assorted veggies & balanced seasoning. Tasted nice. The oil content could be slightly lowered. 

- China Wok's Chie Vegetables
Fresh assortment of vegetables (including mushrooms) tossed in thickened hot & sour sauce. Had a perfect balance of flavors and complimented well with the mains. Recommended.

- Fresh Lime Soda (Sweet & Sour)
Nothing can usually go wrong with this beverage but sadly, it failed to live up to the expectations. And, not even the extraordinary delay in its service could make up for the disappointing preparation. The beverage lacked the fizziness it's known for. However, the level of sweetness was in balance to that of the sourness. The beverage could have been served a bit more chilled. Was just about an average drink.

• A soup, starter & main contained mushrooms. If such is the case, it is advised that the staff clarify preferences while taking the order. Such so, because the descriptions drafted below the name of the dishes do not reflect the presence of Mushrooms in it. And, a lot of customers wouldn't prefer its presence either. Thus, Mushrooms as an ingredient in the dish should be informed to the customers by the servers.

• Serving chopsticks to the customers without a rest isn't a good sign for a Chinese restaurant. Either get rests for your chopsticks or remove them as a whole.

About the STAFF CONDUCT & SERVICE, it was extremely disappointing!
The service was found to be extremely slow and every order nearly took 15 minutes.
An order of a beverage along with the main course never arrived until knocked (The main course was over by then). The knock only invited an excuse which stated that the delay was because the owner had left for the day! Like seriously? What relation does the leaving of the owner have to do with the delayed service? Turned me off completely.
If at all, the reason for the delay in the beverage order was this, why was there a delay experienced in the past orders? Excuses aren't taking this place towards success.
Thereafter, a series of apologies and an on-the-house beverage followed. The initiative for corrective measures are welcomed but, excuses are a strict no-no!
The facts remain. The staff needs to be trained, made knowledgeable enough about the menu and taught to be prompt.
If not looked upon soon, it would only invite a downfall.

• On enquiry, it was learnt that the neither the floor manager nor the owner was available to look upon these issues. The time of enquiry was 9:30pm, but, irrespective of the time, a representative of the management is supposed to be present to attend the customers until the shutters close.

The PRICES were found to be inclined towards the moderate end. The pocket pinch for the above dinner was INR 1257. At such a pinch, the customers expect a much better experience.

Overall the experience was pretty average. 
- For a take off, the excuses could be excused. 
- Service needs to be looked upon.
- Little loopholes in food preparation needs to be worked upon.
Hope to see this place work its way up.

There are various restaurants across the city that provide authentic Chinese and South East Asian cuisines. To provide a tough competition to all those restaurants, China Wok has come into the scene. It is located in a prominent area on Purna Das Road, opposite triangular park.

It was an invitation to our Panchphoron group by the owners of China Wok. The ambience is pretty decent. The ground floor is occupied by the kitchen while the entire first floor has dine-in facility. The dining area is well decorated with lamps. The red chairs and yellow tables are well suited with the décor.

We started with fresh Lima soda which was sweet and refreshing. Then we moved on to the soups. The only veg option was the eight treasure soup which is a coriander and chilli flavoured thik soup with spinach, carrots, corn and mushroom. My friend who tasted it, said that it was a little bland. The owner clarified it that the soup is supposed to be a little bland in taste. One can add salt and pepper to it as per their need. So before having any soup, make sure to share your preferences.

Among the non veg options, we had crab meat soup and yen ta foh. Both of these were equally good it was really difficult to decide which one was better among the two. The crab meat soup was thick, creamy, flavourful and yummy. With egg and generous portions of crab meat, topped with spring onions, it was delight to have. Yen ta foh is a traditional Thai soup, popularly known was Pink noodle soup. It came with rice noodles, egg and seafood, with red sauce. It was very tasty.

Moving on the starters, we had babycorn in Thai sweet and chilli basil sauce. The babycorn was very crispy and tasted good.

Prik Kai Sot Sai Thod was the next dish. It was chicken wings in Thai style. The chicken was soft and crispy. The honey chilli sauce used for the dressing added a distinct flavour to the dish.

Pan fried chilli fish tasted decent. The fish was very soft and perfectly cooked. It came with onions, chillies and scallions.

The best among the starters was the prawn sui mai. The prawn was cooked well and stuffed with mashed veggies inside a thin sheet of dough. With the coriander chilli oil dip, the taste was elevated to a new level.

Veg sui mai was also very good. Even a non vegetaraian would like this. Crispy mushroom pepper salt was good. The veg spring roll was nice. The outer covering was crispy while the filling of onions, chillies, capsicum, etc was tasty. The last starter we had was fried wanton pepper salt. I felt the wantons to be a little oily, otherwise they were good to taste.

Moving on the main course, we were served with khao pad krapow and bok choy delight. Khao pad krapow is basically Thai fried rice with green onions, basil leaves and chillies. It was a little spicy and went will the less spicy bok choy delight. Bok choy is a type of Chinese cabbage. It was cooked with broccoli, mushroom, babycorn, carrots and other veggies in ground pepper and a soy sauce based gravy. It is a must try for vegetarians.

From the non veg section, the mains included:
Khao pad kratiem chicken, which was basically Thai burnt garlic fried rice with eggs, spring onions, garlic cloves and basil leaves and Pad Kee Mao mixed, which was spicy rice noodles with chillies, bell peppers, egg, prawn and garnished with basil leaves. I liked the fried rice but the rice noodles was not upto the mark.

To accompany them, we had Pla Pad Pak and Kai Himaparn. Pla Pad Pak is fish sauted with mixed vegetables in oyster sauce. The fish was soft but somehow the dish tasted a little bland. Kai Himaparn is sliced chicken sauteed with onions and crunchy cashewnuts. This dish was spicier than its predecessor and went very well with the mild spicy fried rice.

We ended our meal with darsaan with vanilla ice cream. The dessert was indeed great. The flour chips were hot and crispy, just the way it should have been. The hot darsaan and cold vanilla ice cream was a deadly combo.

Overall, China Wok is a perfect place for the ones willing to taste Chinese and South East Asian cuisines at affordable rates. Cheers to team China Wok !

Gone are the days when having Chinese food in Kolkata meant those age old chilli chicken & fried rice. Even the fancier name like schezwan chicken & dragon chicken have made their way into road side stalls. Its no wonder then that fine dining is no more restricted to costly & fancy restaurants. New eateries are springing up now & then, offering not only Cantonese/Mandarin but also authentic South East Asian cuisines like that of Thailand & Indonesia.
Exotic vegetables like Bok choy & zucchini are being made available at reasonable prices. Not only taste, eateries are also retaining the original names of the dishes. Pad Thai, Sui Mai may seem confusing at first, but in my opinion are an integral part in maintaining the authenticity of the food & letting an insight into the cultural aspect of that food.

One such eatery providing authentic Chines & Thai food is China Wok, Hindustan Park. Its located just beside Sudipa'r Rannaghor near Triangular Park.
The place is quite small. The reception & kitchen is on the ground floor. A steep flight of stairs leads to the air conditioned seating area on the mezzanine level. The place can accommodate a  total of 16 person, no more. On weekends it is full most of the evening. So be prepared to wait before you can manage a seat.
The interiors are done in a simple manner, but I was pleasantly surprised to find chopsticks on the table.
We were served sweet lime soda as we were seated.You generally can't go wrong with this one, but It really needs some improvement, at least when one is charging a substantial amount for it. However I would like to have some South East Asian drinks the next time I visit.
For food we decided to go with the dishes suggested by the owner.
Will do a quick review of the items I tasted.

1. Soups:
Yen Ta Foh & Crab Meat Soup.
Both were amazing. However I liked the Crab meat one more than the other. Its a clear soup with crab & egg drops. The aroma, texture & test were just perfect.
Yen Ta Foh is the traditional Thai red sauce soup. It contains rice noodles in addition to the crabmeat & shrimps. This also tasted good but in my opinion could be made a notch spicier.

2. Starters:
Prawn Sui Mai, Pan Fried Chilli Fish, Prik Kai Sot Sai Thod,Veg Sui Mai, Veg Spring Roll & Babycorn in Thai Sweet Chilli Basil Sauce.
Prawn Sui Mai, the clear winner in this section are thin wrappers of minced prawn. To make it simpler, its sort of fried Prawn dumpling, only much superior in taste.Must have.
Like its non veg counterpart, the Veg Sui Mai too is an absolute must have.
Prik Kai Sot Sai Thod is Thai version of chicken wings. The look & feel resembles that of Chicken Lollypop. The sweetness of honey is predominant, but does not over power the Thai spices. Definitely worth trying.
Crispy Chilli Baby Corn gets a slight touch up with Chilli Basil sauce, good but nothing outstanding.
Pan Fried Chilli Fish is good too, nothing much to write there.
The veg spring roll was a bit disappointing. Specially for the price listed on the menu, it was not worth having.

3.Mains:
a) Rice/Noodles:
Khao Pad Kratiem Chicken, Khao Pad Kraprow & Pad Kee Mao Mixed.
Khao Pad Kraprow i.e. Thai Basil Fried Rice is the medium spicy Veg dish. Excellent flavours. Recommended.
Khao Pad Kratiem Chicken is the non veg variety of Burnt Garlic Fried Rice. The taste & smell of burnt Garlic did not suit my taste buds. Maybe they had overcooked the garlic this time. But I would rather have the Basil rice in place of this chicken one.
Pad Kee Mao refers to the rice noodles. This too was good,, definitely better than the Khao Pad Kratiem.

b)Sides:
Bok Choy Delight, Kai Himaparn & Pla Pad Pak.
The first one is a veg dish prepared with exotic vegetables like Bok Choy, Broccoli. A good gravy to go with non veg rice dishes.
Pla Pad Pak or Fish in Oyster sauce was the best in this section. The fish soft & the gravy equally tasty. overall the go to dish if you are ordering any veg rice dish.
Kai Himaparan is the Chicken in Thai curry. Although tasting good lost out to the Pla Pad Pak.

4.Dessert:
Darsaan with Ice cream.
I love Darsaan. Though I read somewhere it is not really a Chinese dish, my Chinese dinner feels incomplete without this fried flour chips tossed with honey,sesame seeds & topped with Ice cream. Of course no one goes wrong with Darsaan. But what I really felt is that the fried flour chips were freshly prepared. & definitely felt sliced thinner & crispier compared to many renowned outlets serving the same.

Overall it was a gastronomic delight.
However I felt some of the dishes have been prepared in a milder way to meet the Indian palate. Ask them to make it spicier if you are looking for a more authentic flavour.
The staffs are little bit undertrained. Hopefully they will get better with time.
The menu is huge, variety of offerings is overwhelming, so better ask the owner for suggestion.
& I suggest they make provision for some authentic Thai/Chinese drink if possible.
Till then Happy eating,
Ciao,
Deep
                                          ...

LOCATION ADN DESCRIPTION: 

How often do you find some fine chinese food? We are flooded with some very good chinese restos all over the city and specially in this area. BUT after visiting this place with The PANCH PHORON group today it is certainly very clear that they deserve to be among the top. Located near Traingular park at Purna das road (10 mins auto from Rashbehari more) this place has some very well made and mouth watering spiced up food at your service. Dealing in chinese food only with quite impressive names as well as eye catching dishes. We were greeted with a warm welcome and smiles. 

AMBIANCE AND SERVICE:Coming to the ambiance so it not a huge kind of 50-60 seater but the space, the interiors and the looks are very trendy. From the main gate to the upstairs sitting the interoirs and decorations are quite decent. Walls have been kept simple and the light lamps hung reminds you of china. Provided with full  wooden worked and comfortable red chairs. Service has been good but meanwhile it got a bit slow during the serve of the dishes. Still the staffs were very polite attentive and quick on their feets. The best part was they kept their patience while serving and keep moving up and down and smiling all the time. 

FOOD:The prime focus for what we were all here was the authentic chinese flavors. As we dined in we started with Cold drinks to cool up. And Moved for the beginer with Soups in forms of: 1. Yen Ta Foh Soup2. Crab meat soup

I perosnally like to have soup in the beginning. Yen Ta Foh soup was very nice and tasty. Mixed with seafood, rice noodles and red sauce which make the soup look different in attire and turned it saffron in color.Crab meat soup was even finer. White in color with all the vegetables boiled perfectly. Taste was very good. It was very thick and mild spicy that what i personally felt.Secondly we moved ahead to the starters in forms of1. Pan fried chilli fish2. Prawn sui mai3. Babycorn in thai sweet & chilli basil sauce4.Prik Kai Sot Sai Thod
Pan fried chilli fish was a decent dish. It was fried and tossed with onions, chillies and scallions. It was soft and smelling well. Breaking easily and taste was good.

Prawn Sui mai was certainly seemed and innovative dish to me. It was wrapped and in between minced with prawn with corianderchilli oil. It was soft, very cute looking and went completely in the mouth at a single shot.

Babycorn were delicious. It was tossed in thai sweet and chilli sauce with basil over it. Wrapped with chilli flavor on it and taste was good enough as well as it was quite crunchy.

Prik Kai Sot Thod was the pick of the eve in starters. The chicken wings were well marinated and the flavors were coming right to the mouth. It was soft, spicy, filled with good flavors and fried perfectly.

After having done with the starters we quickly moved to the main course with the shortage of time we had. That were:

1.Bok Choy delight2. Kai Himaparn3. Pla Pad Pak4. Khao Pad Kratiem chicken5. Khao pad kraprow6. pad ki mao mixed

Bok choy delight was made up with exotic vegetables in ground pepper and soya sauce. Taste was mild spicy and flavors were good enough.

Kai Himaparn was another nice dish on the table with sliced chicken sauteed with onions and cashewnuts.

Pla pad pak seemed mild spicy with fish sauteed with mixed vegetable on oyester sauce. The look was very appealing and so was the taste. It was on the softer side and breaking easily.

Khao pad kratiem chicken was burnt garlic fried rice. It was different in color and thou different in taste. Not the normal rice taste just as different as it name.

Khao Pad Kraprow came up with basil flavor. The texture of the rice was better the ingredients were well mixed and cooked well. taste was quite satisfactory.

Pad kee mao mixed was something very new i had. Certainly something mix of quite of few things at once. It was sliced rice noodles with chilli, bell peppers and basil. The mixture of those three were bang on. Good combination and each of them gives you the taste on the same. 

Finally finishing things with a mind blowing and personally  which i liked the most was the Dessert named Darsaan with ice cream. Crisp deep fried chips tossed with honey and sesame and basil. Sweet in taste and chips were hot. Being mixed with cold ice cream made it even better with hot and cold together with the flavour of honey and ice cream.

QNQ AND PRICES: Quality of each and every dish we had were outstanding. You can trust on the quality for sure. Quantity too don't disappoint you as well. Was enough for two people. With such chinese dishes the prices are quite pocket friendly.

CONCLUSION:With such a great food, service and hospitality they provide surely you gonna get overwhelmed. I wish team China wok all the best and hope them to keep providing such great service ahead to all the walk ins. Cheers

I was wandering in Purna Das Road and came across this joint. Decided to try it. We were 4 ppl. The Eight Treasure Soup,Sui Mai and Spicy Crispy Chicken Starter were brilliant. We really also liked the dipping sauce they give with Sui Mai. The Burnt Garlic Fried Rice, Veg Hakka Noodle, Manchurian and Chicken Thai Curry[Red] were delightful. The Darsaan for desert was crisp and had perfect amount of honey.We were really surprised by the affordable bill for the extra generous helpings we received.Met the owner Mr. Varun who was very polite and most accommodating. He was sitting on the billing desk. Must visit for everyone. Amazing food quality and very generous helpings and extremely polite staff...Surely will be visiting very soon again...

Awesome food delivery at my residence at alipore. Called for food for the 6 of us. Food arrived on time within an hour. It was hot, fresh and well cooked. The chicken was fresh, juicy and spiced right and Roasted Pork was a hot amongst all of us. The burnt garlic rice was awesome and the chilli garlic noodles was spicy but tasty. We loved it. Will order again soon.

Gone are the days when having Chinese food in Kolkata meant those age old chilli chicken & fried rice. Even the fancier name like schezwan chicken & dragon chicken have made their way into road side stalls. Its no wonder then that fine dining is no more restricted to costly & fancy restaurants. New eateries are springing up now & then, offering not only Cantonese/Mandarin but also authentic South East Asian cuisines like that of Thailand & Indonesia.
Exotic vegetables like Bok choy & zucchini are being made available at reasonable prices. Not only taste, eateries are also retaining the original names of the dishes. Pad Thai, Sui Mai may seem confusing at first, but in my opinion are an integral part in maintaining the authenticity of the food & letting an insight into the cultural aspect of that food.

One such eatery providing authentic Chines & Thai food is China Wok, Hindustan Park. Its located just beside Sudipa'r Rannaghor near Triangular Park.
The place is quite small. The reception & kitchen is on the ground floor. A steep flight of stairs leads to the air conditioned seating area on the mezzanine level. The place can accommodate a  total of 16 person, no more. On weekends it is full most of the evening. So be prepared to wait before you can manage a seat.
The interiors are done in a simple manner, but I was pleasantly surprised to find chopsticks on the table.
We were served sweet lime soda as we were seated.You generally can't go wrong with this one, but It really needs some improvement, at least when one is charging a substantial amount for it. However I would like to have some South East Asian drinks the next time I visit.
For food we decided to go with the dishes suggested by the owner.
Will do a quick review of the items I tasted.

1. Soups:
Yen Ta Foh & Crab Meat Soup.
Both were amazing. However I liked the Crab meat one more than the other. Its a clear soup with crab & egg drops. The aroma, texture & test were just perfect.
Yen Ta Foh is the traditional Thai red sauce soup. It contains rice noodles in addition to the crabmeat & shrimps. This also tasted good but in my opinion could be made a notch spicier.

2. Starters:
Prawn Sui Mai, Pan Fried Chilli Fish, Prik Kai Sot Sai Thod,Veg Sui Mai, Veg Spring Roll & Babycorn in Thai Sweet Chilli Basil Sauce.
Prawn Sui Mai, the clear winner in this section are thin wrappers of minced prawn. To make it simpler, its sort of fried Prawn dumpling, only much superior in taste.Must have.
Like its non veg counterpart, the Veg Sui Mai too is an absolute must have.
Prik Kai Sot Sai Thod is Thai version of chicken wings. The look & feel resembles that of Chicken Lollypop. The sweetness of honey is predominant, but does not over power the Thai spices. Definitely worth trying.
Crispy Chilli Baby Corn gets a slight touch up with Chilli Basil sauce, good but nothing outstanding.
Pan Fried Chilli Fish is good too, nothing much to write there.
The veg spring roll was a bit disappointing. Specially for the price listed on the menu, it was not worth having.

3.Mains:
a) Rice/Noodles:
Khao Pad Kratiem Chicken, Khao Pad Kraprow & Pad Kee Mao Mixed.
Khao Pad Kraprow i.e. Thai Basil Fried Rice is the medium spicy Veg dish. Excellent flavours. Recommended.
Khao Pad Kratiem Chicken is the non veg variety of Burnt Garlic Fried Rice. The taste & smell of burnt Garlic did not suit my taste buds. Maybe they had overcooked the garlic this time. But I would rather have the Basil rice in place of this chicken one.
Pad Kee Mao refers to the rice noodles. This too was good,, definitely better than the Khao Pad Kratiem.

b)Sides:
Bok Choy Delight, Kai Himaparn & Pla Pad Pak.
The first one is a veg dish prepared with exotic vegetables like Bok Choy, Broccoli. A good gravy to go with non veg rice dishes.
Pla Pad Pak or Fish in Oyster sauce was the best in this section. The fish soft & the gravy equally tasty. overall the go to dish if you are ordering any veg rice dish.
Kai Himaparan is the Chicken in Thai curry. Although tasting good lost out to the Pla Pad Pak.

4.Dessert:
Darsaan with Ice cream.
I love Darsaan. Though I read somewhere it is not really a Chinese dish, my Chinese dinner feels incomplete without this fried flour chips tossed with honey,sesame seeds & topped with Ice cream. Of course no one goes wrong with Darsaan. But what I really felt is that the fried flour chips were freshly prepared. & definitely felt sliced thinner & crispier compared to many renowned outlets serving the same.

Overall it was a gastronomic delight.
However I felt some of the dishes have been prepared in a milder way to meet the Indian palate. Ask them to make it spicier if you are looking for a more authentic flavour.
The staffs are little bit undertrained. Hopefully they will get better with time.
The menu is huge, variety of offerings is overwhelming, so better ask the owner for suggestion.
& I suggest they make provision for some authentic Thai/Chinese drink if possible.
Till then Happy eating,
Ciao,
Deep
                                          ...

LOCATION ADN DESCRIPTION: 

How often do you find some fine chinese food? We are flooded with some very good chinese restos all over the city and specially in this area. BUT after visiting this place with The PANCH PHORON group today it is certainly very clear that they deserve to be among the top. Located near Traingular park at Purna das road (10 mins auto from Rashbehari more) this place has some very well made and mouth watering spiced up food at your service. Dealing in chinese food only with quite impressive names as well as eye catching dishes. We were greeted with a warm welcome and smiles. 

AMBIANCE AND SERVICE:Coming to the ambiance so it not a huge kind of 50-60 seater but the space, the interiors and the looks are very trendy. From the main gate to the upstairs sitting the interoirs and decorations are quite decent. Walls have been kept simple and the light lamps hung reminds you of china. Provided with full  wooden worked and comfortable red chairs. Service has been good but meanwhile it got a bit slow during the serve of the dishes. Still the staffs were very polite attentive and quick on their feets. The best part was they kept their patience while serving and keep moving up and down and smiling all the time. 

FOOD:The prime focus for what we were all here was the authentic chinese flavors. As we dined in we started with Cold drinks to cool up. And Moved for the beginer with Soups in forms of: 1. Yen Ta Foh Soup2. Crab meat soup

I perosnally like to have soup in the beginning. Yen Ta Foh soup was very nice and tasty. Mixed with seafood, rice noodles and red sauce which make the soup look different in attire and turned it saffron in color.Crab meat soup was even finer. White in color with all the vegetables boiled perfectly. Taste was very good. It was very thick and mild spicy that what i personally felt.Secondly we moved ahead to the starters in forms of1. Pan fried chilli fish2. Prawn sui mai3. Babycorn in thai sweet & chilli basil sauce4.Prik Kai Sot Sai Thod
Pan fried chilli fish was a decent dish. It was fried and tossed with onions, chillies and scallions. It was soft and smelling well. Breaking easily and taste was good.

Prawn Sui mai was certainly seemed and innovative dish to me. It was wrapped and in between minced with prawn with corianderchilli oil. It was soft, very cute looking and went completely in the mouth at a single shot.

Babycorn were delicious. It was tossed in thai sweet and chilli sauce with basil over it. Wrapped with chilli flavor on it and taste was good enough as well as it was quite crunchy.

Prik Kai Sot Thod was the pick of the eve in starters. The chicken wings were well marinated and the flavors were coming right to the mouth. It was soft, spicy, filled with good flavors and fried perfectly.

After having done with the starters we quickly moved to the main course with the shortage of time we had. That were:

1.Bok Choy delight2. Kai Himaparn3. Pla Pad Pak4. Khao Pad Kratiem chicken5. Khao pad kraprow6. pad ki mao mixed

Bok choy delight was made up with exotic vegetables in ground pepper and soya sauce. Taste was mild spicy and flavors were good enough.

Kai Himaparn was another nice dish on the table with sliced chicken sauteed with onions and cashewnuts.

Pla pad pak seemed mild spicy with fish sauteed with mixed vegetable on oyester sauce. The look was very appealing and so was the taste. It was on the softer side and breaking easily.

Khao pad kratiem chicken was burnt garlic fried rice. It was different in color and thou different in taste. Not the normal rice taste just as different as it name.

Khao Pad Kraprow came up with basil flavor. The texture of the rice was better the ingredients were well mixed and cooked well. taste was quite satisfactory.

Pad kee mao mixed was something very new i had. Certainly something mix of quite of few things at once. It was sliced rice noodles with chilli, bell peppers and basil. The mixture of those three were bang on. Good combination and each of them gives you the taste on the same. 

Finally finishing things with a mind blowing and personally  which i liked the most was the Dessert named Darsaan with ice cream. Crisp deep fried chips tossed with honey and sesame and basil. Sweet in taste and chips were hot. Being mixed with cold ice cream made it even better with hot and cold together with the flavour of honey and ice cream.

CONCLUSION:With such a great food, service and hospitality they provide surely you gonna get overwhelmed. I wish team China wok all the best and hope them to keep providing such great service ahead to all the walk ins. Cheers

This outlet is about 5 to 6 mins walking distance . Had given order online and had recieved the ordered food 25 mins behind the promised time. 
The crab meat soup and the pan fried noodle was quite decent. However the dimsums and the chicken preparation was too salted , at least twice the amount of salt was used than actually warranted. Left quite a bad taste in mouth.

Its quite funny how you set out for dinner to a certain restaurant, dont find space and eat at a close by place. Then that place turns out to be better than the original one you were planning to visit. It happened to us last Saturday night. Without names, we were on our way to Ballygunge Place for some chinese food and crossed Purna Das Road on our way there. This restaurant looks great from outside so we could not miss it and said to ourselves "we will try it out sometime". But then we did not find place at where we were going so drove back and found a table at this small but neat outlet. The huge glass facade makes you look down at the flowing traffic and the soft instrumental music makes you forget your hard day and have a good time with your loved ones. The restaurant is small with five tables on the mezzanine floor connected by a steep staircase. The stairs are a difficult climb but the restaurant itself is tastefully decorated with old chinese proverbs and Japanese beliefs. The kitchen is live so you can see their hygiene levels which I found to be very good. The benches were spotless in the kitchen and you could here the wok at work which took me back to my travels through Thailand in search of Authentic thai cuisine. Food is MSG free which adds a dash of good health for all. The Khao Pad Kratiem rice was tasty and as authentic as it can get in Kolkata and the Kai Ped Memong was moist with a generous helping of cashewnuts. My wife loved here Thai Curry and polished off a bowl of it by herself :). The Darsaan was as good as any I have had. The stewards were well trained and knew what they were serving which for a small restaurant like this one surprised me. I liked the fact that the owner came up to us and spoke to us about their food and convinced us to order items which we would not have otherwise ordered. All those items turned out to be great. The place is very reasonable and will set you back about 300-350/person which is awesome. Tremendous repeat value due to quality, quantity, price and service. Will come back again for sure. You might wanna opt for delivery as well as they deliver to quite a distance.

This is my re review for China Wok, it's truly amazing to receive such a proactive and warm reply from them.Varun had personally called to apologize. I solely believe it was a one time fallacy that the fried rice was not on par the last time.Today I received Chicken Sui Mai, Thai basil chicken fried rice and Chilli Chicken complimentary a great gesture from the management. The Sui Mai was superb. Soft seasoned meat encased in thin wonton wrap.It was served with a tasty garlic dip.EXCELLENT. They are definitely master of dimsums.Last time the momo was mind blowing too. Now coming to the fried rice...it had a beautiful aroma from the basil excellently wok tossed with spices.Absolutely LIPSMACKING! ! The Chilli Chicken was best of its breed. The chicken had minimum coating and huge sized.The taste attributed flavours the exact way we enjoy our "Chilli Chicken ". I must mention that portion size is very good. 3 of us were full leaving some for my hubby to taste.Penny worthy. I'm overwhelmed and very soon ordering more.Please keep up the good work. Foodies this place is passionately recommended for food and great customer service. Kudos to team China Wok and Varun ....full marks..you have retained a great foodie as your regular client.CHEERS!!!

I call for delivery quite regularly from this outlet. My patents are Tai Chen Chicken Drums of Heaven, Rosted Pork in Baby Bok Choy and coriander and Burnt garlic Rice. Delivery is always on time at my residence at Lake road and the food has always been good. I like it that they maintain their quality of food which makes them very reliable and reasonable for regular Asian Food Lovers like me. They probably know me by name now and I like the fact that the steward at other ends of the phone knows and remembers that I like my food non-spicy!!! Must try it out if you want good Asian food without burning a hole in your pocket..

This place is located very close to the Triangular Park. Ambiance is great and it is a very brightly lit up and well decorated small yet cosy place. Eating arrangements is the the 1st floor of the place, which is a bit on the smaller side with a capacity of around 15 people. But the qualtiy and the deliciousness of the food simply bowled me over. Stuffs like Roasted Lamb and Crispy and spicy chicken were simply awesome specially the Lamb which is probably one of the best preparations I have had till date. Staff is also very hospitable and pricing is extremey reasonable.Overall a must visit place for all the chinese lovers!

I had heard so much about dis place in the last one month that I finally decided to call for food delivery last night to my residence on sarath bose road. 
We called for roasted lamb in baby bok choy, diced chicken pepper, ginger and garlic,khao pad kratiem rice nd raad nah mixed. 
We around around 8 pm and food arrived by 8.45 pm which was pleasing. A tall intimidating delivery boy was at the door. He was courteous nd wished us good evening before handing us the food. He requests dat check d content before paying for the food. The bill came to around 1000 which was very reasonable foe the item we ordered. The restaurant made sure he was carrying exact change for our amount which was once again very professional. Most delivery boy go searching for change or put u through the same hassle when you order food. 
Our food was steaming hot nd tested very fresh. Meat was well cooked nd prfctly seasoned. The container said "AJINOMOTO FREE" which I had heard about this restaurant. We could nt test any in the food nd the food was surprisingly light nd had the right amount of oil. 
We loved it and look forward to ordering soon from China wok. Highly recommended!!

This restaurant small and cozy situated in Purna Das Road ... Is a lovely place to dig in!! If you are taking your friends or be it your fiance ... Anyone will love the food here. Food served at a great price, which is indeed economical. Though the price being in limits, they do not compromise quality at all. This place has some lovely dishes namely "Chicken Tai Pei" and "Drums of Heaven" . The pan fried Momos are simply delicious. Chicken Tai Pei here is one of my favourites. Situated at such a posh location, this restaurant can give u an appetite if u have 500 bucks and to your brim if you have around 1000 rupees.

Located at HIndustan Park, this is a small restaurant on the first floor,with a capacity of about of about 6 tables. One of the very few Chinese restaurants of Kolkata, that makes Chinese food without monosodium glutamate, which is a big positive for this restaurant. We ordered China Wok Tossed Chicken as a starter and I feel that the chicken was a bit too chewy, the restaurant authorities must look after this. The fried rice was nice and sticky and the Tai Chen Chicken proved out to be a very good choice for the main course. Will come back again! BUT, the floor manager contacted me after some days regarding the quality of the chicken issue and they sent home delivery of 1 Chicken Fried Rice and 1 Chicken preparation, free of cosy. It was a great gesture. They have really improved the quality. I really liked the food. This was a delight from their side. Will surely visit again.

Small but authentic Chinese restaurant with lot of potential. Located near the bylane of triangular park, this place is surely a paradise for Chinese food lovers. A narrow entrance followed by a steep staircase leads to their first floor which can accommodate a maximum of 16 people. The ambience is simple and nicely decorated with red coloured Chinese theme. Soft music in the background and cute chopsticks on the table gives a nice Chinese feel. Coming to the food we ordered dry chilli crab claws and mixed meat meifoon. Six large dumplings of crap meat coated with a crispy layer  was tossed with spicy sauce and veggies. Meifoon was well cooked with lots of chicken, shrimp and crab meat. The crab dish was subtle yet spicy and devoid of fishy smell. Meifoon complemented well with chilli crab. Quantity was large enough for two people. Pricing is reasonable. Service was polite and commendable. Highly recommended.

Went to this little place for a New Year Eve dinner with family. The place has a long way to go in terms of seating and interior decoration... But the food was really good. Great flavour and good value for money. The service was a tad slow, but that can be excused, given it was probably one of the busiest nights of the year.
All in all, a very nice experience.

Finally got a chance and tym out of my busy job to go to this much talked about eatry on purna das road right next to triangular Park this Sunday night. We were 8 of us family and the restaurant is small. We had to wait for 20 mins to get a table. I like the light decor outside and the Santa and Christmas tree kept next to the entry of the restaurant. The restaurant itself looks spectacular from outside, much bigger than it actually is. 
The place is small but well done up and reminded me of a nice Asian cafe. We felt cozy inside and the glass frontage gave us a good view of surrounding. The Christmas carols immediately got us into the holiday mood. 
We called for a lot of food. Mentioning all the dishes would be difficult but the entire array of food on offer was very good and it was combined with quick and courteous service and a very reasonable cheque. The resturant has amazing repeat value for people who want to have good Asian food at reasonable prices and I mean reasonable!! 

A special mention of their lamb is baby bok choy and rosted chilli pork!! Those two dishes stole the show. Absolutely smashing!!

After reading mixed reviews about the place on zomato, we were on two minds on whether to give it a try or not last Saturday night. We finally decided to go as it was close to our house and hatari would have had a long wait. When we reached we were surprised to find a waiting que of about half an hour. We did not expect it at all. 
The staff were courteous from the onset even to the people who were waiting outside. Owing to cold weather, they were serving green tea to waiting customers which was an excellent touch. It was a help specially to my mom and dad due to their age. 
We got our table about half an hour later. The space is small dividend in to two floors with a huge glass face. The get up of the place makes it look spectacular with hanging lights, floor staff in smart red polos and light Asia music playing inside. One can not miss it on purna das road you can hear and see the kitchen at work which gives you the impression of eating in a busy typical upscale place in Thailand or China. 

My review of the place :

Food:5/5 --The roasted pork in baby bok choy was to die for and the kratiem rice is mind blowing. 

Service :5/5 ---Good courteous and humble staff with quick feet and stable hands who know what they serve. 

Ambience :4/5 ---Bustling and screaming Asian with a hint of mellowness due to the soft music.. 

Interiors :3.5/5 --space is small BT well kept and decorated. Stair case needs work. 

Affordability :5/5 ---super reasonable with good standard of food. 

Verdict ---I believe that the few negative reviews on zomato are due to certain people having isolated bad experiences at this restaurant. I imagine it could be due to teething prblm which almost all newly opened ventures face. You have to also see the price to product equations which according to me is Spectacular. Me and my family loved it!!. Give it a go and I am sure you will love it specially if it's adventurous Asian you are looking for. It might just change your notions about Asian cuisine especially with the fact that the restaurant is Ajinomoto Free!!. I am a critic when it comes to food but no faults to find here!!

An unknown awakening of the palate is the greatest adventures of the human mind "is what was written on a wall next to our 4 seater table at this newly opened resturant on purna das road. Bt we thought to ourselves, "they all write a lot but when it comes to food, they are all the same ".a few beers pre dinner led us to ordering the dishes unknown nd unheard off contained in their menu.
Yen ta foh (seafood soup with rice noodles)and poh taek (seafood soup with chilli sauce) for soup split between the four of us. Starters had prik kai sot sai thod (thai chicken wings)nd nam prik pow koong (prawns). Main courses was comprised of khao par kraprow chicken (rice)nd raad nah (thai pan fried noodles) nd thai chen chicken. 
We were left wanting more after each course. My table manners prevented me from actually lifting and licking the dishes believe it or not!. Service was fast nd waiters were well informed about the menu. That always is good sign for dinners at a restaurant. 
Being a Tuesday night the restaurant was quiet bt the music nd the sound of the wok in the kitchen was pure gold to the ears!!. It took me back to the time I loved going to tangra for Chinese. The place smelt of Asian herbs with a neat little touch of citrus room freshener. I like these neat little touches. 
As a recommendation, I want them to keep changing their menu as I feel their kitchen team does have the ability to surprise you with their dishes. Will come back for more this time on the weekend so I can come with my besties..

We had called for home delivery from China wok. The staff who had taken the order was very helpful and suggested items in the menu which would taste equally good at home. We ordered Thai red curry and mushroom pepper salt , both were excellent. The veg manchurian was also very tasty and the dumplings well made. We also loved the American chopsuey that we ordered.all this costed us Rs 800 approximately. Our stomach and pockets were left thoroughly satisfied.

We had gone to the outlet 4 days back and loved the food.  Tonight our tastebuds were craving for its dishes.  So we placed an online order. The details for home delivery said 45 mins, which was fine. We placed an order at 8.25pm . ..with some unexperimented dishes we order their red Thai curry(repeat of our order 4 days ago at the venue)
The delivery was finally made at 10pm...delay of 35 mins. 
And other then that the biggest disappointment was that the Thai curry that we had eaten 4 days ago at their table was without exaggeration at least 3 times diluted.  The rest of the order was below average too as compared to our in house experience.
I bit of a doubt has seeped in about the quality consciousness of their overall food.

Location is next to triangular park on Purna Das Road. Restaurant is small with two levels one housing the kitchen the other housing the tables. The stair case connecting the two is steep which is the reason I have taken the .5 off the rating. However the food was spectacular.

Good fresh chicken and vegetables combined in an oyster gravy made the kai pad pak. Burnt garlic shards and coriander leaves mabe the burnt garlic fried rice. We were just two of us so could not order more. Portion sizes are enough for two and prices are cheap. One of those good places which has struck a good balance between quality quantity and price. Loved it!!

Sunday family lunch today. The restaurant is situated at the crossing of Purna Das Road and Triangular Park. Small restaurant with a very large glass facade. Loved our experience from start to finish. We were greeted at the door by a courteous staff who showed us to our table. The Pan Fried Chilli Chicken was very nice and that was followed by Diced Chicken in Schezwan Sauce, Kraprow rice and darsaan with ice cream. Food was awesome and service was quick. 

More surprisingly the bill came to 800 for all this which was very reasonable. Very recommended !!

"No Ajina Moto" is whats written on the first page of the menu card.(it is a taste enhancer also known as mono-sodium glutomate which is used by almost every other Chinese restaurant in Kolkata..AND IT IS BAD FOR HEALTH).I went with my family today. Its a small place which can accommodate about 16 people. But if you ignore this, rest whatever there is about the restaurant is simply superb.
Starting with the ambience, the slow soft background music was soothing to the ear which really sets up the mood for any family or couple to eat. Service was not only prompt but really helpful in clearing doubts over complicated dish names. Now coming to the food. With a starter, soup and main course,a total of 6 dishes, all of them were just mind blowing. It was so tasty that we couldn't help but leave nothing on the plate even though we tended to pack atleast one unfinished dish in other restaurants. Not naming all dishes but Chicken meinfoon and Roasted Pork in Chilli Soy Sauce is a must try for any first timer. I conclude with two shocking moments with this restaurant. 1.) With 6 dishes, the bill was less than Rs1200. 2.) Bad reviews in Zomato about this restaurant by people like Suman Dey and Arif Ali. It made me believe today that not to trust all the reviews in Zomato because not only did they criticise the restaurant in a horrible manner but also demoralised them. If one didn't like it,then he/she should encourage them as there is always hope of turning it a better place. I really look forward to visit this place again and again. As it is a worth 5.0 rated restaurant.

Small little place with some lovely lighting and a neat decor. The guys are warm n courteous. We ordered for Thai chicken rice and chicken in garlic and pepper sauce. The food came on time, the portions were decent enough, the chicken was tender and everything else fell right into place.  Except for the fact the taste could have been better. The chicken had hardly any hint of garlic but overloaded with pepper and the rice had chunks of meat but hardly any flavour. Just work on the taste and you guys will go a long way!

One of the worst restaurant I have ever tried
If only zomato had negative points to give
Worst experience ever
We came in around 6.30 pm Sunday evening 5 of us
We saw the place a little clumsy still ok
We ordered 1 momo 3 wonton and a crispy chicken
After almost 15 min the waiter comes and say no wonton so we agree to momo 
Again after 10 min they say they don't have 4 plate momo only 3 plates available
And then again the wait started
And my god never saw so many mosquitoes in a restaurant continuously being bothered by insect in the restaurant it was seriously pissing us off till point we wanted to leave
The insects falling in the water glass
In the plate
It was a utter disaster
Then almost around 7.15 after 45 min the food arrived
And then we saw insects in momo too
It was awful to destroy ones appetite
And as per the food SHIT OILY MOMO WITH RAW CABBAGES WERE SERVED TO US it seemed as if we were having momo from some roadside stall
I could have got those for 40 bucks

God knows how those restaurant can exist there


P.s : The crispy chicken was OK but still not worth 45 min wait
Never ever I am visiting this one again
Hell I even won't recommend it to my worst enemy

I was the last person to opt for Chinese food before trying this place. I was literally dragged by my sister to this place. And voila! This place made me fall in love with this Asian delicacy.
The sweet corn soup was delicious. The Manchurian could have been better. The hot chilly garlic noodles blends well with the Manchurian. But the show stealer was the crispy chilly baby corn. The service was commendable, was not expected out of such a small outlet. The ambience could be better, but one can prefer a takeaway over dine in.

Had a party where China wok planned the food delivery. Brilliant food, it was delivered 3 times over the course of the party and it kept the food fresh! The portions were also planned out so perfectly well by them that there was minimal wastage. The Thai green curry and rice really is to die for. Unbeatable food, unbeatable prices.

I went to China Wok on 7th Nov'15 with my family for lunch.We ordered Soup along with Starter & Main Course.We ordered Sliced Fish in Hunan Sauce. Since we had tried earlier & the taste was good so we ordered for the second time. But unfortunately the fish that was served to us had a very punjent smell. We told the staff of the restaurant who were courteous & were serving nicely denied our views completely and said that they will inform the Chef.It was our third visit & keeping in mind of our previous visit we thought of giving it a try. I felt very disappointed. I could recollect the warmness of the young entrepreneurs who felt us that we should not miss the kind of Thai taste that were offered earlier.Requesting the management to keep feedback forms as this would help for making necessary corrections in future.

We had a really light meal here, but it was thoroughly enjoyable. Our wallet prevented us from trying out too many dishes (the place isn't that costly; we are just that broke) and we ended up having only a chicken and a rice.

1-->Mixed khao pad krapow: a fragrant Thai rice dish flavored with basil. It was absolutely delicious, perfectly cooked and really unique. It's not hot at all, so give it a go if you're in the mood for something new. It's kinda herby. Portion wise, we shared a plate between the three of us but then we weren't really trying to fill ourselves. One plate is ideally enough for two, but not if you are ravenous eaters.

2--> Chicken kaeng penang: another yummy dish. It's a light red curry flavored with peanut paste and kaffir lime leaves (gondhoraj lebur pata). It's also kinda coconutty which I like but I know many people who don't. It's not oily and one plate has 6 nice sized pieces. There is no icky cornflour coating and the chicken was perfectly cooked (hallelujah). The gravy was so delicious that we were licking our spoons by the end.

3--> ambience: it's not unpleasant. A cost little place where you can go with people who are in similar broke conditions. Not a place for family dinners, not a place for snobs, but perfect for a satisfying meal.

I want to go back there as soon as I can and I recommend it to everyone. The one point I've deducted is for the tiny space available to diners. But if you're going there for food, then this really isn't much of a concern. Service is also really good. Pork was unavailable though... Next time, pork, prawns and a full wallet!

We ordered Roasted pork in Chilly Soy and Kong Pad Pak (Prawn sauteed in vegetable and oyster sauce) and China Wok Special Rice. I must say ... food was awesome. I wanted to try more dishes but we were full. Next time I will try something else. Polite and humble staff... clean and hygienic property.  5/5 from my side.

Been at this joint twice. Located at Purna Das Road, this one's hardly a four tabled small restaurant. The first time we went there, I was highly impressed by their food. They serve amazing chinese in satisfying quantity at low prices. However the second time we went there, they messed up. We ordered for diced chicken in hunan sauce however what they served was fish. On complaining about it, the waiter straightaway denied it was fish. Now this is something annoying. It is understood that in the rush of the hour one can make mistakes, however one needs to have a heart to admit that. Please take a note.

A small and quaint joint with pleasant ambience for nice meal. Loved the simple yet wonderful Thai food that we were served consisting of Pad Prik Krapow with Steamed rice with Kaffir lime leaves made for a filling dinner for just Rs. 405. As a suggestion I would request the management to improve the quality of rice served for Steamed rice else it was a really good experience. We loved the service as well as the waiters were extremely cordial. Thank you for such a delight. I will be looking forward to going back to this place again for sure.

Worst experience ever .....we were total 16 heads selected this place to have dinner on 23rd Oct 2015 ( Nabami mid night )

We ordered mixed gravy noodles , fried rice and chicken side dish , when they served the food first we found 1 long hair in the gravy noodles and secondly the fried rice was cold and taste less.

We found the mixed gravy noodles taste less and without prawns and chicken , as if we have ordered veg gravy noodles.

We were very disappointed and called up the owner he was very casual in his approach and took this issue very lightly , we expected that he will sort out the issue but he ran away from the site.

All my relatives were very disappointed with the food quality, quantity , service and hyegine of the place.

I will not recommended this place to any one, just waste of money and time.

Visited China Wok on 21/10/2015. Very small place. Steep stairs to the restaurant on the first floor. The place does not even have a toilet. I was advised to go to the public toilet near by at Triangular park.
The ambience was poor and staff untrained. Both the Hakka chicken noodles and diced chicken that we ordered were disappointing. The table was not cleaned and the glass  tumblers were dirty.  We were also surprised that we were billed  an additional 10% as Service charge!!!

Visited on Chathurti night (17/1/2015) post 12 midnight . After a short wait was provided with a table. Whilst waiting for the food,  chanced upon the reviews on Zomato of this joint, which made us rethink our choice.
However was pleasantly surprised. The food was served real quick (mind you it was post midnight during Durga Puja). Helping was good and the taste even better. Lamb in spicy oyster sauce was an instant hit. As staple Cantonese noodles is recommended along with Eight Treasure soup.
Recommend this place for a quick grab. Value for money and taste buds. 
Fish was not available.... another reason to visit this place again.

I would prefer a road side joint over this place. Bad quality and no taste at all. I puked after eating here. The price is equivalent to a standard restaurant in kolkata. 
You will surely feel suffocated, as it is too small, seating facility for 16 people only.
The starter, diced chicken with pepper, ginger & garlic was the worse, as if i was only eating pepper.

One of the Best Thai food in Kolkata. The food quality is brilliant, with the correct level of spice.

Tasty food, diverse menu, vegetarian friendly, and reasonably priced - quite a winning combination for me. The place is compact, so I’d recommend to call ahead and reserve a spot, especially in the evenings.

Service was quite fast and food was of high quality. I especially liked the vegetarian steamed momos and the darsaan. A big plus for me was that the owners were really friendly. They tried to ensure that things went smoothly, and were more than happy to take any feedback.

While I haven’t personally tried it (stay at the opposite end of the city), I’ve been told by reliable sources that the delivery service is also quite good.

Will certainly revisit China Wok the next time I’m back in Calcutta!

China Wok has done a good job of introducing fairly priced good Chinese cuisine in the area. The food is prompt and tasty. I had gone there with my family and there was something for everyone. The owners take special attention to guests and are always present. I would highly rate China wok for a casual dining experience at low rates. I remember spending more for eating at a road side 'thela' . this place is that cheap. Good job Guys.

The Southern Avenue area of Kolkata is fast becoming the food central for the city. There are new restaurants opening up almost every month. Some have been decent and some have been very ordinary. However, China Wok a new restaurant situated on Purna Das Road has forced me to register and write a review on Zomato.

Its a small restaurant with a big soul. The food is simply fabulous!! The restaurant itself is small with just four tables and the option of delivery and take away. They deliver upto 4 kms. which is the good part as mostly restaurants only deliver to 2 kms. Having experienced the delivery as well as dine in option I give China Wok a 5/5. While at first upon entering the place, I thought this place would not score more than a 3.5, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food they serve write form the Eight Treasure Soup to the Babycorns in Thai Sweet Chilli Sauce. The boys serving us were courteous but new and needed more experience. But where this place scores is the food they push out which is quite awesome. Within 3 months of opening, they have developed quite a fan following in the area which comes as no surprise. A big thumps up for the outlet !! Will go there again surely.

Well, I was hoping for a good Chinese flavored experience when I ordered for home delivery. My expectations were not met. Firstly, their price rates on zomato don't match. I was given a higher bill invoice. Don't know whom to blame here. Also , the manchurian I ordered was smelly and stale. I have had better Chinese dinner in Kolkata. So this was a dampener.

Being a foodie I like to explore new places. But this was a horrible experience. This restaurant is so small that they don't even have a washroom. From the look of the menu card it seems that they try to make some authentic Chinese dishes but the result is zero. The food was really tasteless, both the side dish and the main course (garlic fried rice and some chicken side dish)

Awful is the word! Over priced. Delivered extremely late. Had ordered with foodpanda and they did not have the items I ordered and spent so much time in suggesting a substiyute dish. When I said I will not pay extra and chose something which was fitting the original bill value, the foodpanda guy said that the price is not an issue, and I can choose anything I want but when I chose something which was more than they were looking to pay, they again said that it was not possible for them to adjust the value. So again I had to choose something else. By then, I just wanted to get it over with. And when the food came, it was absolutely ridiculous. No taste in anything. Felt I would rather eat the money I spent.

The problem with a chinese outlet is that there are too many of those in Kolkata. Everywhere they are serving you chinese.
However, China Wok is one such place where even if you don't get authentic chinese, you'd probably get authentic names of the chinese food you are having.
We decided to have Schezwan pork and rice, and Wok Chie Chicken. The pork seemed to be too dry, hence the taste wasn't that spicy as one would like for Schezwan. Wok Chie Chicken is a chicken preparation with too many vegetables in it.
The worrisome thing about their service is the waiter who'll keep staring at you unless you finish your food.
The ambience is nice, with chinese songs playing in its audio system and the price of the food is decent.
If you want to have chinese with authentic chinese names in the menu, it's worth a try!

I have been planning to visit this place for quite some time after seeing it trending on zomato weeks after weeks.Went there for lunch with a friend with sky high expectations but the place failed to live upto it.
Before coming to food I must mention that to reach the 1st floor of the restaurant u have to climb up a flight of steep stairs.And the part adjoining it below is the sliding door of the kitchen in ground floor.I had no idea about it..was going up the staircase holding on to that side..& then my finger got caught in the door hinge due to carelessness of kitchen staffs.Thankfully the owner was there..she apologised repeatedly & provided me with ice cubes in water to relieve the pain.

Coming to food..We ordered prawn sui mai & pla rad prik for starters.

The sui mai was delicious..wholesome in terms of filling n the coating was so light
..just melted in mouth.
The fish was awesome too.I generally don't like having fish.But this fish was crispy with a golden hue..and it went well with the spicy n sweet sauce it was cooked in.

For the mains we went for pad thai mixed & tai chen chicken.
Pad thai tasted very good..but the shrimps in it had a weird stink which compelled me to waste the shrimps in it entirely.
The much hyped tai chen chicken was a big disappointment.The chicken was nice & juicy itself..but the gravy had a weird stink & tasted even more disgusting.

Still I look forward to try out this restaurant few more times only for the sake of their yummy starters & hope the maincourse won't be such a disappointment next time.

This place has a very small seating area though the interiors are okay. I had chicken meifoon n had ordered chicken fried momos for starters. The food was good n the portion is enough for two persons. The prices on the menu are inclusive of taxes. Looking forward to try the other dishes , especially the thai cuisine. I would prefer to opt for the take-away optn for this restuarant.

China Wok is a small restaurant at the corner of Purna Das and Triangular Park. Place is small but well decorated. Just has 4 tables on the second level connected by a flight of narrow and steep stairs. The place is cozy..perfect place to chill with friends and family. The menu is different and authentic.

My review of China Wok

Location: 5/5..purna das road these days has become a food hub.

Food: 5/5..being nine of us, we called for soups, starters, mains, sides and dessert..the entire range of food was great!

Ambience: 4/5.. small but but well done ( stairs are too steep)

Service: 4/5..no complains but room for improvement.

Over All: 4.5/5...this place has superb asian food. Fresh and full of flavor...I believe it is one of the "must gos" of the city.

I have been wanting to start reviewing on Zomato for quite sometime now. Being a food lover and wanting to explore the many places that this city has to offer, I feel it prudent to let others know about my food experiences in the city.

China Wok is a new Chinese and Thai food outlet on Purna Das Road. Its close to my home in Southern Avenue and I have been crossing it on my way to work almost everyday. I have been surprised to see a crowd at the restaurant everyday on my way back from work which led me to try this place out yesterday.

The place is small but the vibe is good. The glass front adds to it I think. They have a live kitchen with glass display which is nice to see in the city and the menu is unique. Most items I had not heard off.

Decided on the Roasted Pork with Baby Bok Choy for starters, followed by the Green Thai Curry and Steamed Rice. A young waiter named Subrata was taking care of our table. He was kind and courteous but in need of some training.

The Starters arrived in 10 mins and to my surprise was awesome. The dish was perfectly balanced, maybe it was even better than Hatari. Then came the Thai Curry which absolutely blew me and my husband away. We were left wanting for more. I believe this small restaurant has the potential to give brands like Chowman a run for their money. It clean, crisp and fresh. The food has a soul and zest about it. The staff and attentive and the place is welcoming. Me and my husband absolutely loved it. Its an absolute "Thumps Up" for China Wok..I am sure to dine again some time soon. Highly Recommended.

I love Chinese cuisine and have been aiming at the restaurant for quite sometime. Today evening I got the opportunity. 
It looked inviting from the outside - red walls, glassy front portion. But I could not get in initially as a staff blocked the door and kept on talking with others. I had to shout, " excuse me", and then he moved and I had to push open the glass door by my own hand while the Staff looked on. He also did not guide me as to where to go. I looked around and found the stairs to the mezzanine floor. I was surprised by a piece of white cloth fluttering on the railing of the stairs, presumably to guard the ac (!). Anyway, I was suitably impressed to see the decoration. A tiny place is tastefully decorated with red chairs and red themed photos containing nice quotations. There is place to sit for 16 people. I chose the one near the giant window in order to see the busy traffic passing by.
The staff came forward. In a small voice, he asked if I would take normal water or mineral water. While he spoke, his voice shook. It was apparent from his attitude that he was a novice. He was very young too. He told his name was Chhotu Biswas. I asked for menu card which he provided. I chose Chef's special soup for eating there and diced chicken with dragon sauce for parcel.
It took a lot of time for the soup to be made, but when it arrived, it was worth waiting. It was quite delicious and filling and I felt so good tasting it. The dragon sauce chicken was predictably hot, but for a chilly lover like me, it was also perfect.
The staff forgot that I had asked for parcel of dragon chicken, and arrived carrying it in a serving bowl. When I reminded him, he immediately returned the same and deposited the parcel on my table. The boy was well meaning. He hovered around me to see if I needed anything. But he was not trained. The place served both Chinese and Thai food. He had no idea about most of the Thai food. When I sat down or rose to leave, he made no attempt to move my chair. While leaving too I had to face the same ordeal. There were staff loitering around, but no one came forward to hold open the door for me. While struggling with the door, I heard a timid ," good night, Madam," from one of the staff. A welcome surprise from the untrained brood, surely.
The food is excellent, the decoration is also eye catching, the price pocket friendly. I hope the administration takes care to train the staff. Then it would be one of the best eatries in Kolkata.

This place having 2 levels with the dining area on the first floor, is quiet and peaceful. One of the things we ordered that's worth mentioning is their special eight treasure vegetable soup. Its surely one of best Chinese soups I've had in a long time. The Vegetable Manchurian and the Thai green curry were also delicious.  The quantity they serve is good with no compromise on the quality. The place was clean. Definitely one of the Chinese options to be considered in the vicinity.

Situated on main purna das road this small restaurant is an absolute treat for Asian food lovers . They serve super authentic Chinese and Thai. The taste of the dishes are quite different to what you might have had before. 

It's a cozy place with a huge glass facade. Food is authentic and honest and the service personal. I wish more such places opened in the city. Places with a vibe and soul of their own. 

Review: great food, reasonable pricing and acceptable service.

I visited China wok on this Sunday afternoon after reading the reviews on zomato. It is conveniently located as it's a 2 minute walk from the triangular bus stop. A very small place which has only four tables. The first thing which I would like to note is that they took ages to deliver the food and not only us but all the customers started complaining but I must say that the owner was a polite lady and she kept on apologising which I appreciated a lot. We ordered China wok tossed chicken in starter and in main course we had schezwan chicken fried rice,pad Thai chicken noodle and kai pad prik kraprow. The starter had 10 pieces tasted really nice and was slightly crunchy which I liked but the size of the chicken pieces were small. The rice was prepared well but I was not that impressed with the pad Thai noodle as I have had better ones before and one weird thing which I noticed while having it that it had no single chicken in it again we had to complain about it. The staffs were quite novice but at the same time they were polite as they were apologising and offered to change it but as they were taking really a long time to serve food we asked him not to. The chicken side dish was shredded and well cooked. The owner kept on apologising and explained that they cut their veggies after the orders are placed for giving their customers a better service. Even though there were few cons but I would definitely visit it again when am not in a hurry because it's a new restaurant and it definitely has room for improvement and also because of their behaviour and last but not least the price is damn pocket friendly. The quantity is not bad at all compared to the price that they are charging. Our bill amount for these four items was Rs. 680 approx.

Went for lunch to CHINA WOK with my friends on sunday. We were a large group of 12 people. The space is small and we were concerned we had chosen wrongly. However, since we were there we decided to order. We ordered for 8-10 starters since prefer starters over mains. They were a mixture of chicken, prawns and fish. The starters were awesome and we loved each and every one of them. More importantly everything was served within 20 mins of ordering which was nice as we were starving.

For the mains we ordered Thai curry Chicken, Kai Gra Tiem and Mixed Fried Rice. We thoroughly enjoyed the food. Service was good and the food honest.

Food Quality and Taste: 5/5
Ambience and Decor: 4/5
Service: 4.5/5
Food Freshness and authenticity: 5/5
Pricing: 6/5 (Food is VERY REASONABLE:))

If you want fine dine quality food at cheap prices, this place is awesome. Just dont go nit picking on the unnecessary things and youll live it !!

Must Go!

I am writing this review after having tried the food at CHINA WOK several times. Upon having liked the food I received over three delivery occasions, I decided to give the dine in option a try yesterday. The restaurant is small and has only 4 tables. But the way its done up is cozy and the glass facade really adds to the experience.

I went with my wife and we ordered for the Tausi Chicken, Mixed Fried Rice and Darsaan with ice cream to finish. I absolutely loved the food. The Tausi Chicken with fresh bamboo shoots was very close to the ones I have tasted during my travels to South East Asia. Service was polite and the ambience was lively. We had a great evening.

Highly Recommended !!

I have been to this place twice earlier and the experience wasn't very pleasant. Last Wednesday, I had visited this place again with a few friends of mine who kept on insisting to come here and I must say that the experience was so good that I decided to edit and change my review.
Earlier also, the food was out and out good except for a few problems. The staff behaviour was a big problem which has lessened over time still not eradicated completely. But I must say, they have gone through a complete makeover of the food recipes and this has come out to be excellent.
That day, we had Veg Sui Mai, Steamed Chicken Momo, Pan Fried Chilli Chicken and a Crispy Assorted Veggies in Hot Thai Sauce with Roasted Chillies and Kaffir Lime (I've surely forgot the Thai name). All of them were very good. Specially the vegetarian appetizers. The chilli chicken was average not as good as the others. I must say, this place specializes in sui mais. I have had prawn sui mai here earlier twice and both the times, they were excellent.
For the main course, there were Schezwan Fried Rice, Coriander and Burnt Garlic Rice along with Tai Chen Chicken, a Thai Fish preparation whose name I have forgot again and Diced Potato with American Corn in a Hot Garlic Sauce. There were also steamed rice along with a veg Thai Red Curry. The Schezwan and the Coriander Burnt Garlic Rice were delicious. So we're the fish and the chicken. The fish deserves some special mention here. It was extraordinarily fantastic. Earlier, I didn't have a very decent experience with the Tai Chen Chicken. It came out to be stinky, very bad and was wasted as we couldn't have it for the rotten smell. But that day, the chicken also, was prepared very well and tasted perfect. The diced potato along with American Corn was also very good. I had a huge portion of it not being a veggie person at all. Didn't have the Thai Red Curry along with steamed rice as I was too full after this and needed to reserve some space for the desserts afterwards.
For dessert, came in the classic Chinese one - Darsaan with Vanilla Ice Cream. It was good as hell. I am not at all exaggerating a bit. But to my opinion, this is one of the best darsaan I have had till date. It was neither too sweet, nor too bland, balanced perfectly by tossing with honey and seasame seeds.
I was being a bit sceptical about coming over here again. But there's no regret anymore as my dining experience this time was fantastic.
Happy Dining! :)

China Wok is a newly opened chinese and thai outlet on Purna Das Road. Having ordered delivery several times and having loved the food everytime I have ordered, I decided to give the dine in option a go on Tuesday.

Went there with a couple of friends and was pleasantly surprised to be greeted by the owner who was sitting at the cash counter. We were shown to our table on the mezzanine floor through a narrow staircase ( which mind you is quite steep). This time we ordered for the Chicken Sweet Corn Soup, Diced Chicken Pepper Ginger Garlic and Pan Fried Chilli Fish for starters followed by a helping of the Thai Green Curry Chicken and Red Curry Lamb along with steamed rice. The food was an absolute delight. The soup arrived within 10 mins of ordering followed by the starters 15 mins later. This was followed by the main course 20 mins later. The food does take a little bit of time to come but having spoken to the owner I was informed that everything is prepared fresh. I was told that they dont even pre fry anything. While this took time I felt it made a difference to the flavour. The vegetables were nice and crunchy and the meat was soft and succulent.

The food is fantastic and the pricing reasonable. I feel its easily the best asian place in the area probably at par if not better than Hatari -:). One area I feel they can improve is service. While I did not face any problems with it and the service boys work hard and our very polite and courteous, one of those suited guyies who can interact with the customer well would take my rating to a 5 on 5.

Verdict: Must go for people who love asian food. Great food and pocket friendly prices.

Visited China wok on a busy Saturday evening despite the place being busy the staff were very efficient and courteous. Gave us a table with minimal waiting and the service was prompt. The food that arrived at the table was fresh and hot , and extremely tasty. The best part was saved for the last , we were pleasantly surprised to see how little the bill was for the fabulous fare.

Its a small joint with home delivery service. Looks cute and nice. Aftr entering this place u gona feel pure Chinese Chinese environment with Chinese music and Interior. Owner made this restaurant quite smartly in a small place But no washroom. Only 4 table but quite big. Various food , many options , also u will get sum sea food option . 

Well, comes to food its really tasty . We ordered a two " spicy sea food broth " , "China wok tossed chicken" and 1 fish preparation( i dnt remember exact name ). Soup taste really mindblowing evn betr thn chawman honestly. But prawn was nt clean properly. I was getng sum sandy taste inside my mouth . I hv no complain but food except tht hygienic thing. U should clean food properly and thn cook. Not for all but Specially about sea food if u dnt clean up properly customer will suffer food poisoning if they hv regularly. So kindly, owner should b strict bout kitchen hygiene and food Cleanness thing. Fish and chicken was fantastic no complain bout those recipe.

Being a huge foodie myself, I love to try new places which seem to be opening ever so often in the city. So while walking by Purna Das Road last Sunday with my family, I happen to stumble across China Wok,a small yet inviting looking restaurant at the corner of Purna Das Road and Triangular Park.

The menu fascinated me with most items I had not even heard off before. The descriptions given in the menu below each item were both helpful and inviting. The outlet has only four tables. Its cozy,small and simplistic. The large glass facade creates a very nice atmosphere in the mezzanine floor where seating is located.

We called for Chicken Coriander Soup, Yen Ta Foh (Traditional Thai Soup) and Manchow Soup. For main course we called for Sliced Fish in Hunan Sauce, Neua Kae Pad Pak (which is a lamb preparation) along with a helping of Thai Fried Rice and Chicken Hakka Noodles. The Soups were simply mouth watering. The sides were very good and lived up to their descriptions on the menu. I particularly like the Hakka Noodles which was very authentic and did not contain black pepper which many places around town use. Its not suppose to have that.

The owner was courteous and the service was polite. Will definitely visit again soon.

Highly Recommended!

It was a leisurely Sunday afternoon when we visited china wok and although other reviews suggest it remains crowded, we were lucky. The small eating room on the first floor does not give a good first impression, nor the amateurish attendants who easily confuse orders. But the food was surprisingly delicious. After waiting quite a while to be served i was almost sure it was a bad choice to come here, but the food completely changed it. The steamed mono was juicy inside and tasted very good, the diced chicken was a bit spicy but good. The quantity of fried rice was average but both the side dishes we had were again a treat to the taste buds. The tai chin chicken especially is highly recommended. Prices are competitive but the service poor and needs to be upped.

Wanting to have a light dinner last night, we decided to give this joint a try. We had to order in as my wife is currently immobile. The delivery time was around one and a half hours, so, if you are feeling hungry and want your food to arrive quickly, this is not the place to order.

Our food arrived at around 11pm and we weren't peeved as we were informed about the time of delivery at the time of placing the order itself. We had ordered for a Sweet Corn Chicken Soup, a Spicy Lemon and Burnt Garlic Chicken Soup, 3 plates of Steamed Chicken Momo and a regular Chicken Fried Rice.

The soups were delicious and good in quantity; the Fried Rice, though, was a let down as it was pretty low on salt and almost verging on being insipid. However, the Momos were definitely the best of the lot with perfect seasoning and were very juicy - easily among the best we've had in Kolkata.

Verdict: Momos are a "must try" out here.

Newly opened chinese restaurant. Small sitting arrangements. Only 4 tables are there. You have to be in waiting if you are going for a family dinner in rush hour. Service is very time consuming. They take way too long time for an order. May be thats because for perfection of the dish. Because food was really good. Authentic taste.
But 1 issue, while having the thai seafood soup, while I was having the prawns, I felt it was not properly cleaned. I could feel some dust type in mouth while chewing the fish. It was not properly cleaned. Should look forward to the hygenic part.

It's really mind boggling to see the number of restaurant poppin' up everywhere, with anything from 8 to 80 covers! Very soon, our home kitchens will shut shop! Not that I'm complaining! ;-)

So while walking down from Rashbehari Avenue last week, my husband spotted this little, new Chinese restaurant behind Triangular Park. The menu was cleverly displayed on a table in front of the restaurant, and seeing the lip-smacking dishes being served, we decided to have lunch here.

Climbing the stairs to a mezzanine space with four tables of four if I remember correctly, we loved that the tiny space was tastefully and invitingly decored. Not too keen to eat chowmein and fried rice just because it's Chinese (we really don't need fill up with so much carbs), we carefully read the menu cover to cover and ordered the Chef's Special Soup, the Roast Pork with Baby bok choy and a Thai fried fish with sweet chili sauce

First, the soup. A trifle under seasoned, I cannot complain about the soup ingredients. Generous amounts of veg, chicken, fish etc, as promised in the menu. Light and comforting.

Roast pork: In one word, YUM! Only well-ingrained table manners kept me from picking up the serving dish and licking the gravy off! 

Fried Fish: I am always a little wary of ordering anything fried, because I don't like the cornflour-y taste in my mouth when it's not cooked out. Unfortunately, the same happened here. But that's the only negative. The fish itself was very good, and so was the overall flavour of the dish.

A lovely lady greeted us at the table when we were eating, and we spoke again on our way out. My hubby and I were very happy with our meal and we told her so, promising to visit again.

So here's wishing China Wok all the very best. Next time, I'm trying the octopus and squid. And the Roast Pork. And the....:-)

Its Basically a take away joint and for home delivery, but looks like they had some left over place where they managed to squeeze in a few table.

but where this place score is the quality of food. we ordered for mushroom pepper salt, pad thai noodles and exotic vegetables in hot garlic sauce.

everything was excellent. its been long had this good chinese food. the only downside was the food was extremely spicy.

otherwise excellent place and amazing food.

Decided to try this new place we noticed. Neatly done up, making good use of limited space. Tasteful decor, not overpowering. Things like chopsticks for every cover are definitely worth the trouble.

The menu has a lot of choice whether it be soups, appetizers and mains. We decided to skip the usual noodles & rice and go for a bowl of their signature soup along with two sides a thai fish in a chilli and garlic sauce and the roasted pork with bok choy. 
Full marks to the pork dish that was perfectly cooked. The soup was a bit under-seasoned but this was hardly a negative as you can fix that easily at the table with some salt or soy (as I personally prefer). Rather an under-seasoned dish than one where somebody has been heavy-handed with the seasoning.
The coating on fish was perhaps the only negative. It did not take away from the flavour of the dish but prevented it from being perfect.
The candied ginger shavings that come along with the bill leave you with a smile at the end of the meal. 
A very good experience - the polite service, quantity and quality of the food, left us wanting to come back and try the rest of the menu.

I have been wanting to review on Zomato for a while now. China Wok is a small restaurant located on the cusp of Purna Das Road and Triangular Park. I have been crossing it almost everyday on my way back from work. The exteriors of the restaurant is very eye catching. It is impossible to miss. 

Upon not getting space in the restaurant last Saturday, I decided to call for delivery for my wife and me. We called for Steamed Wontons (Chicken), Kai Himaparn (Thai Chicken Preparation) and Khao Pad Kraprow fried rice (Mixed). Food was delivered within an hour despite being a very busy night. It was well packed and the wonton gravy was seal wrapped which I really liked.

Food was hot, fresh, flavoursome and satisfying. The Thai preparations were very close to the ones I have had in Thailand. All in all it was a great experience. I am looking forward to dining at the restaurant soon.

I was walking by Purna Das Road with my family on our way to Hatari for a Sunday night dinner a few days back when we saw this place. Its situated right on Purna Das road next to Triangular Park. It looked very nice from outside so we decided to give this place a shot. The owner was at the counter personally and we were told it was a 30 mins wait. Hatari would have been the same so we decided to wait it out. The owner was kind enough to serve water to the people waiting outside which not many places in Kolkata do.

We finally got our table 40 mins later. The menu is extremely authentic Chinese and Thai food. Even the names on the menu are quite authentic. We were six of us and we called for sweet corn soup, yen ta foh and gaeng jued woon sen for soups along with prawns pepper ginger garlic and chicken taipei for starters. Soups were served within 15-20 mins followed by starters in the next 5 mins. The quality of the food was fabulous. It reminded me of my favourite dishes at Mainland China which is far more expensive. For Main course we called for Moo Gra Tiem ( Pork dish ), Tai Chen Chicken, Green Thai Curry along with rice and noodles. Once again the food was fabulous. We were surprised by the cheque we received at the end. The place costed us Rs.300/head which I thought was very reasonable for the food they served. The only reason I have given this space a 4.5 instead of 5 is because they have paper napkins instead of proper ones which I feel a place this popular should not have. 

I am glad we chose this place that night and decided to wait for our table. The food was so worth it and the taste from some of those dishes still lingers in my mouth. Highly recommended!!. I will definitely visit once again soon.

Today I ordered the food around 8.40 pm.. The person said it would take an hour to reach.. as it is hardly 5 mins from my place.. After calling a couple of times talking to the manager and owner.. The food finally came at 10.25pm.. The deliver person came walking which took him extra time to reach.. 
Only suggestion is to improve your Service..

Location: Enter purna das road from traingular park. as soon as u cross the park u will get this eatery on the left hand side. Not really difficult to find.
Decor: decor is nothing to die for.its a small place with 2 floors.groung floor kitchen and upstairs seating. Theres a narrow staircase. Be carefull if you are acompanied by some aged members. This is one if the reason for my rating. Else i would hav given 4.5
Food: They are serving great chinese and thai. 
We ordered_ mixed chilly garlic noodles, thai basil friedrice,kung pao chicken,thai chicken with red curry.
Each of the dish was mouth watering. They know how to cook and never compromise with quality. After a long time i had such anawesome Chilly garlic noodles.Kungpao chicken was of great taste and its a must try. Thai fried rice was of perfect balanced taste. And thai chicken was with real bamboo shoots. I liked it. It had a signature smell,you may like the smell.if you like you will come again n again.cz its not easily available in kolkata.
Price: very much up to mark with the food. Not cheap but with respect to the food quality its nothing. They serve quiet good proportion also. And thet sre not charging any Vat or service charge yet. So hurry up and give a visit. ;-)
Service:service was good. Though it took 30min for the food to come. But the waiting was worth the food.

I coming back soon china wok.....

I had gone to China wok with 4 members of my family. It was an outstanding experience. We had ordered the rice and Hakka, Tomyum soup, the Wontons and Dimsums. In addition the Babycorn and mushroom gravy. The dishes come to mind again and again. I would love to go back just for the soup. Highly recommended. 

Further, the prices of the place are rock bottom and in the price of a burger at Mcdonalds one can have a lavish Oriental meal along with beverages and a sweet at the end. The service is prompt and the place is clean. I love the involvement of the owner of the place in the small little things and the last minute customization of dishes he did for us. I would love to go there again.

Have tried food from China Wok on 2 occasions 

One was a sit in dinner wherein we tried their Diced Chicken with Pepper Ginger and Garlic, Veg Sui Mai for Starters. The Chicken was an absolute stunner with great flavours and was cooked very well. The sui mai was also very high on taste and texture.
For mains we tried their Thai Red Curry (Kaeng Ped) and Rice and oh boy it was just mind blowing. The Flavours of coconut milk was very well balanced. The veggies were very fresh. The red curry is a must try here !

Had a great evening sitting beside their large glass facade while it was pouring outside :)
Service was prompt as there was no rush and we didnt need to wait much for our food. Portion Sizes were generous for the two of us and we were adequately stuffed and has no appetite for dessert.

Later we did a home delivery for a party and they did a great job again ! Tried the Sui Mai, Crispy American Corn in Szechwan Sauce, Pad Nam, Diced Potatoes with American Corn in Hot garlic Sauce, 8 treasure vegetables, Hakka Chow and Rice. Delivery was prompt and at our desired timing. The sui mai was an instant hit with everyone !

This place will give some big places a run for their money. A very well though out menu and some great preparations. Delight for Non Vegetarians considering their non veg options. Pocket freindly for the kind of food they offer too !

Looking forward to visiting soon !

This is a new small restaurant near to triangular park.. food was taste wise  nice.. may be little improvement needed.. food ingredients were freash. As per quantity of the foods its medium.. decoration and ambience is good.. now talking abt service and stuffs they need more exprerince and training. . In a crowded day they lag to coordinate well between kitchen and waiters hence u have to wait more longer in table, after placing yr orders in advance while waiting out side. A 45 min wait is really painfull when u empty stomach.. Not only mine experience the others who where come yesterday feel same. I assume its a more off take away joint than dining there in crowded day. Now speaking of the price group of the food items its fair enough.. will like to vist again may be in a less crowded day so that can explore more of their foods..

1. Awesomelicious food in this area. Chinese is worth a try. Quick response on the phone. Food home-delivered in time, hot and yumm. You might not want to miss the food here.

2. Went for a dine-in. Really small place, just 4 tables. No fire exit. And loads of diwali mosquitos spoiling your dining experience.
Changes the management really need to work on are:
1. Get mosquito repellent machines to work for you.
2. Make way for an emergency fire exit for the 1st floor. (Life is important)
3. Get better lighting arrangements for a more better ambience.
P.S. your food and service is commendable

We planned to have our Sunday dinner at China Wok & it wasn't difficult to locate. The place is extremely tiny with just 4 tables. Zero ambience.
The waiters were polite & courteous. We ordered for Crispy Chilli Babycorn, Chicken Tai Pei & Prik Kai Sot Sai Thod (Thai Style Chicken Wings) as starters. The dishes were served within 5-7 mins of placing the order & each of the dishes were awesome & near perfect. The quantity is moderate, good enough for 2 people. Thumbs Up for the starters!!! Next we ordered Prawns in schezwan sauce, pork in devil's sauce & mixed fried rice. Could have tasted better but they were good nonetheless. Again portion sizes were good enough for 2 and we were so full that we had to skip the dessert. I would definitely recommend this place if you want to have good food at totally reasonable price. The negative part is that the menu has no beverage options apart from coke, thumbs up, etc.

Since its new 5 stars. Had food delivered. Ordered brownies, their special rice, hot garlic pork, hot n sour soup and hot garlic noodles. Though the food was nice at the price point but could have done better with more fine rice quality. Hot garlic pork could have been better. The delivery was quick and the guy was courteous. All over it was nice.

I had planned to go to this newly opened restaurant yesterday night, but heavy rainfall hampered my plan. So, I opted for home delivery.

I chose to have Thai food. So I had ordered Kai Pad Prik Kraprow, Egg Khao Pad Kraprao, and Chicken Pad Kee Mao. Delivery was delayed because of the heavy rain, but that's okay. The food was warm enough.

The Kai Pad Prik Kraprow, which is basically sliced chicken in a hot and spicy chilly sauce, with basil leaves, tasted quite good. The Khao Pad Kraprao, which is fried rice, was spicy, and too salty. The Chicken Pad Kee Mao was very good though. Light, soft rice noodles, and tasted quite different from the noodles we generally get to eat.  I loved it, except that I hoped for a little more generous amount of vegetables.

Quantity is good. The prices are decent. They don't charge extra taxes.

Overall, a god experience. Hoping to dine in at the restaurant some day soon.

Wonderful ambience & tasty food that soothes the oriental food lovers. I relished the BabyCorns very much. Even though space is a constriction, yet it gives a cosy and comfortable feel. The music makes you sail through the yummy aroma. Enjoyed thoroughly!!!

Located near triangular park, China Wok is a small cosy pocket friendly eatery serving authentic, sumptuous Oriental food. They have a wide array of both vegetarian and non vegetarian dishes to choose from. Among the starters the Hua hin Highway Rolls and the Chicken wings in that sweet sticky chilli sauce is a must try. The soups and dumplings are pretty decent as well. The mains have both Chinese and Thai options. Chilli garlic noodles, Burnt Garlic Rice and the sides of Chicken and Fish were generous in portion and tasted great. However, what got me sold is their Icecream sandwich dessert. A little plate of happiness, you sure cannot miss this.

Overall I enjoyed my experience at China Wok. Pocket friendly pricing, good food, good service...a perfect place to eat out with friends and family. It is a small place so make your timings right on weekends.

After been there and eaten all in different corners of Asia I came to this restaurant last weekend with my  family.The clean ambiance and the mellow music at the background makes the environment positive and stable.Ordered for Prawn in Schezwan sauce,Tausi Chicken,Pad Pak as side dishes with mixed fried rice schezwan flavored.
They took a little time to prepare thou but can't complain with the fullhouse including us on a weekend and the steward explained all the food are prepared fresh when order comes,so no problem waiting a little more time for fresh dishes.

The 8-10 minutes waiting was not so that of reaching the nexus of Mt.Everest as the ambiance sure do brings a good mood to chit chat with my family members.

One the food arrived and was placed on the tables the mood was even :-) shinning bright cause of the aroma and colour.
The food was awesome to taste and can get that it was fresh.

The guys at the restaurant was courteous to ask if we require anything else or not and asked for whether we liked the food or not?
Sure  we did and would like to have the same gastronomical journey on the foodholic roller coaster again.

Good food,good behavior,good ambiance.

'China Wok' should maintain this good job for us the Foodaholics of the city.

Regards

Located in one of the most prime locations of South Kolkata . It provides you with a perfect ambience of Oriental culture with pipe music melody oozing through the sound boxes and a greatly made up interior decor!!The staff are extremely polite and efficient!! 

. The chicken and fish dishes are a speciality of this place!! Cantonese noodles are also special for their various types and tastes!!  The Thai Green and Red curry are just lip smacking.
A must place to visit !!

Extremely authentic Chinese food!
If it's Chinese, just Wok to China Wok!

I have always loved the Chinese here but not surprisingly the Thai food is also great!! Had some Pad Thai Noodles and Thai Curry yesterday and what a great it was!

And when you feel lazy to step  outside, avail their Home Delivery services :) Happy Eating

A small joint which has opened on Purna Das Road which is actually a lane off triangular park...this place is situated next to idli express and seems to have garnered quite a fan following..the decor is fuss free and u are greeted by the owner who is approachable..now getting down to food,we tried going vegetarian on this day for a change and dat might've skewed my review to a certain degree...the food was average but the overall setting and service takes it up a few notches and I would definitely try out their non vegetarian options before giving in a final Yes or No verdict... It seems a likeable place and I wish more such places do open up in d city which is currently facing an identity crisis when it comes to its F&B industry whereas it should be leading the way considering the immense willingness on part of Kolkatans when it comes to their food.All in all,its a thumbs up for China Wok till we really test it on all corners.

If you want a bout of claustrophobia then pay a visit to this place. Why come up with a dine in restaurant with only four tables that too arranged in a cramped up 'attic'. Coming to food, we ordered all Chinese garden variety stuff. It was like salt attack! Each and every dish ( except sweet corn chicken soup which was very good though) had the salt level right up there!! This is a dealbreaker for me rightaway for any future visits.

Tried this place out. It is a newly opened authentic chinese and thai food joint. Though small in dimension, still this is a cozy and warm place. We tried their Sea Food Soup along with a Pork starter and both tasted excellent. In the main course we tried their mixed fried rice and another side dish which were equally good. And the icing on the cake was the price list. This is the first time I have had such wonderful food at such a low cost.

The owners were always on their toes to ensure that the customers get the best food and services. Every staff were extremely courteous and did everything with a smile, which made the difference.

The only difficulty that I faced was that their Credit Card machine was not yet installed since they were a new joint. But they informed that the same will be functional soon. That is the only reason for me to rate them 4.5.

I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family. I have loved China Wok and am sure that I would become a regular there.

South Kolkattans....... Please try out. You will love it.

This new place just opened up this weekend on Purna Das Road right beside the Triangular Park. Its a Chinese and Thai restaurant and I tried it out for dinner on Saturday night. The food, ambience and service was very good. The food especially is awesome and very reasonable too. I liked the decor too. I asked and I was happy to note that they deliver to a radius of 5kms. This place is a must goo!!!
