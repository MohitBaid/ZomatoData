Heard about this eatery since the time I was residing in Kolkata...about 10-11yrs back...and since then many of my friends and colleagues had been suggesting me about this eatery...but couldn't take out time to visit this place to eat Kosha Mangsho...
So, during the last Christmas Break, when I was back to Kolkata...I made an unplanned trip to this place...
OK for the first timers...it would be a bit difficult to sight the shop at one go...but if you ask someone, they would guide you to the shop or you may check Gmaps...
Now coming to the review...at the very first sight of the eatery you might get a 440 volt ka jhatka...they shop is in a cramped corner at the busy Shyambazar Xing...sitting place is very limited...with small wooden platforms stacked with wall and has a cover area of max 15-20 pax...
Though I went there for a late lunch...still this place was crowded...had to wait for 10-15 mins before getting a seat...
Now, you need to first get a token for your order...then get yourself a place to sit, and then handover the token to the server who would serve you the dish a few mins later...
So I ordered the legendary item Kosha Mangsho....
The color would be dark brown to black...oil/ghee (though didn't get the taste of ghee) was floating...and they gave about 3-4 pcs of mutton...don't expect to get fleshy mutton pieces...mainly they would serve the bone/cartilage pieces...or even worse fatty pieces...along with this they would serve you 2pcs of roti (which they call here parantha) and few rings of onion with some aachar...(tasted like a berry (kul) aachar)...The mutton was very oily but not that much spicy...Yes...if you are a fitness freak or Calorie conscious...then refrain from visiting this location...Mutton was not that worthy...I have eaten much better Mutton Kosha than this outlet serves... 
Now coming to the pricing part...they offer you a combo of Kosha Mangsho with 2 paranthas and onion rings for Rs.226....and if take an extra pc of Parantha it would cost you Rs.9...
Service at this outlet was prompt....but clearance seemed to be an issue...

Food: 3/5
Ambience: 1/5
Service: 3.5/5
Value for money: Yes

Lastly...would I be returning back...well I would give it a second thought..
Last but not the least...when the entire country is turning cashless...this legendary outlet, like some others in Kolkata...it deals in cash only....

Heard about their legendary Mutton kassa many times and was greatly excited to taste this, don't know it's my over expectation or not,I am not satisfied at all. I find it's average. I ordered Mutton kassa Mutton keema and paratha...taste was not that much good. It was okay type.

If you are a Bengali you are bound to know the name of golbari. Golbarir kosha mangsho has its rich taste and aroma and it's a must visit for me while in shyambazar. The parota just adds a different level to the tastebud. Golbarir kosha mangsho(mutton) is just heaven. Too yumm

Before the winter vacation in Calcutta High Court, some of our fellow colleagues organised a break up party. I suugest that we should try golbarir kosha mangso and parota. Everybody agreed. Hence on 22nd December, 2017 I alongwith another senior collegue went in golbari. I think to reach Golbari is the easiest than any other restaurant. Located in the heart of shyambazar, actually no description is needed. Anyway, we had ordered 40 boxes of mutton kosha and 80 pieces of paratha. When the order was being packed my dada suggested  me that we should atleast try the Devil and we did. Oh, it was a delicious and delicate devil I have ever tasted. The ingredients were keema, and Duck's egg.

Anyway when we returned with the ordered food each of us were handed over with one box of mutton kosha and 2 parathas each. It was a heavenly experience. Mutton is always my first choice and golbari just ignited it more.

From the outside what I saw that its a very busy restaurant and so many people were waiting outside for their turn. To my view its a pocket friendly restaurant unless you want to taste all of their finger licking items.

A very famous place for mutton kosha and paratha, from the good old times, did fail to impress much.

We friends had the same dishes and all were of the same complaint- the mutton should have been a little more boiled, mutton kosha does have a bit more than reqd. salty flavour but here we felt it was too much salty, our tongues were getting burnt of the salt almost after few gulps. 

The paratha was really good.

Had come to Kolkata for a short trip, and for street shopping I was at Shyam Bazar, where Golbari caught our attention. I'm not aware of all the famous places, but Dad told me it's one of the very old food joints which is famous for their "Mutton Kosha".

A very small joint, please keep your hygiene factors aside to try out thier food.

We tried out their Mutton kosha with Paratha, fish cutlet and egg devil. Fish fry and egg devil was superb, but the famous mutton kosha kind of disappointed me. The mutton was very hard, I could hardly chew it well. Though the curry was very delicious and spicy, but the meat being not cooked well, kind of made this dish totally thumps down.

Contrary to the popular belief, I don't find the mutton kasa of golbari can be labelled as anything to die for!!!! It was neither well-cooked nor delicious. The only reason I am giving it some grace marks is that I have some childhood memories associated with the place and recently had a meal there with my husband when we were very hungry!!!!!

Mutton Keema - Dipped in oodles of oil and spice (but didn't taste an ounce spicy! - which is their specialty), it tasted nice. But honestly speaking? It didn't resonate well at all with the name and claim they have regarding the same. 
Even the chicken liver dish was not at all good. 

Their seating space is also very small and restricted. The old world charm about the food and the joint, both, is gone. 
And I felt that the food items were rather overpriced for the quality they served.
They should immediately start renovating themselves, lest they bite the dust in the old newspaper snippets hanging by the wall of their wash basin!

Even though the charisma of this name "Golbari" has been deteriorating since years, I found their famous Kosha Mangso quite good. Although it was so rich with spices and oil, its tastes good. The Mutton Pieces are not up to the expectations, seating is poor, small room like vintage North Calcutta "cabins". One thing I liked the most is the chutney served along with it. Would recommend to try their famous "Kosha Mangso", (i didnt find anything special).

Golbarir Bikkhato Kosha Mangso, the name itself means how popular & reputable is this place. Years of years they're making Bengali style Mutton Kosha that even came on newspapers several times. But all these were past, here's how the recent experience is...

Small old Calcutta style cabin with uncomfortable bench sittings spread around the walls, not at all a good dine experience. You need to give the order at the counter first and pay for it before entering into this place, because they dare after eating their foods you will not pay.

Mutton Kosha (0/5) :
----------------------------------
A pitch black substance dipped into burned oil was served on a small tea plate. Seeing this I was absolutely shocked, Mutton Kasha doesn't look like this & no smell of Mutton Kasha was present. I started to crunch on the Onion salad served with it. Then finally dipped their third class oily & soggy paratha into it and tasted it. 

My god, how it’s possible to make mutton this bad. It just tasted bitter nothing else. No taste, no flavour just the burned spices and oil was felt. Mutton pieces were hardly cooked that I felt it stick in between my teeth even on next morning. This pieces were none less than carbon rubber used in tyres.

It was the most worst Mutton Kasha I've tried in my lifetime. Although the way they cooked it wasn't mutton anymore.

Chicken Liver (0/5) :
----------------------------------
Apart from this I had wrongly ordered Chicken Liver, that was the most cheapest side dish here. Why I entered into this restaurant was my only thought at that time. 4 big pieces of chicken liver totally undercooked that smelt bad. Mustard based gravy was oily and with random spices that tasted extremely bad.

Final Words :
-------------------------
In the name of authentic Bengali Kosha Mangso, What they're serving is 100% pure shit. The day after having this meal I spent hours in toilet endure pain. That only justified each & every bad word I spoke about this restaurant.

This kind of restaurant should be banned from Zomato as well as from the world. Totally waste of time & money while torturing yourself. I wish someday one foodie will come and chop this restaurant owner’s hand and their cooks hand like their served mutton pieces.

We , Bengalis , just can't compromise on giving our taste buds an awesome food experience. This place is a solid proof.
Have been here only once. Tried that thing for which it's famous. The renowned " Golbarir kosha mangsho".
The mutton was succulent. The gravy was too rich and thick in oil. It was a way too spicy than I expected, and I loved this point in particular. Else was just satisfying.

It is very old shop and still looks the same. Went to Golbari for its Kosha Mangsho, which it is famous for. But to my disappointment the taste of the Kosha Mangsho did not live upto it's reputation. The masala was burned and it tasted a little bitter. Recommended once but you may not go for it for the second time. Did not try other items.

Most Bengalis residing at Kolkata know about this historical Non-Veg joint at the Shyambazar 5 point crossing. Golbarir Kosha Mangsho: this spicy Bengali mutton recipe, that has created sensation through the decades, and is well complemented by a paratha, however did not titillate my taste buds enough! It was just good, not mouth-watering good as they claim. Their cutlets are bigger and better than at most other restaurants.
In terms of ambiance Golbari is always buzzing with busy pedestrians who stop by for a quick snack or a take-away parcel. Prices are moderate to low. This lackluster eatery is very small with a seating capacity for 10 people only.

In the previous month, went there with my mom for a lunch the place has a problem of sitting but none the less the taste of "Kasha Mangsho" adjust all other problems in a smoother way indeed.The Food quality is as great as before and the service is improved than before.
The nostalgic place has a lot of values in my heart and the sound of tram "thong thong" with a chilli "Kosha Mangsho" on the plate on a winter afternoon, it's mesmerizing.
Overall, the experience was good, hope I will visit that place very soon.

The mutton kasha is too oily. Only 2 pieces for of mutton and 2 Parathas for Rs. 229 which according to me is too over priced. The Mutton breast cutlet that I often have is one of the best items available according me. Place is too small and congested and dirty.

1.dont think of going there and having food,because there is always a line for having food there.you can just enjoy the food by ordering online.
2.the famous kosha mangsho has lost its quality as it used to have,it has become too rich in masala and gravy,and the pieces were all hard to chew.
3.the staff should look to maintain their originality for which they are famous.
I do expect to get a better quality food next time

Come across many people, referring to Golbari's kosha Mangsho to be the best in Kolkata to feed on.
I have been waiting since then to give a visit to this place.So 3rd dec I did manage to made a visit with my family.Ordered paratha,Kosha Mangsho,Mutton keema and Chicken Cutlet. It's too rich,dipped in oil and taste-wise it's not that great. I have been going through people's review here and quiet surprised as we didn't find their so called special dish'Mutton kosha' that tasty .Even the Mutton pieces were very small and except for one piece ,the other three pieces were simply bones.Parathas were a bit hard.Seating arrangement not proper,tables placed against wall in a row and not spacious.Not expensive but nobody minds shelling out a little more if the food served is really good.verall not satisfied .

 I tried mutton kasha, chicken kasha and paratha over there..

The taste of mutton kasha was extremely good and it was mouthwatering.. 
 
 
 Parathas were good..
 
 
 But I don't like the chicken preparation.

This phrase is absolutely correct in this case.

Never go on the look of the place.
Just go and grab a golbari mutton kasha you'll get to know what i meant.
The price is reasonable and yet worth paying.
You'll get a few option to choose from but one dish will be equally attractive and delicious than the other one.
Recommended dishes:
1. Mutton kosha and paratha.
2. Mutton cutlet.

I guess almost every Kolkatan is aware of this small circular cafe right at the five point crossing of Shyambazar - the go to place for ages now for any Bengali’s staple non veg dish - the famous #KOSHAMANGSHO especially #MUTTONKOSHA and the extremely soft roti (which they call paratha) and the delicious tamarind chutney makes it a deadly combination for any carnivore.. My favourite though is #MUTTONLIVERKOSHA which I enjoyed today - four large chunks of mutton liver served in a spicy and thick gravy (not your cup of tea if you are not into oily food).. 

The standard of the dishes have drastically degraded over the past few years but having said that it can still give any other joint serving similar stuff a run for their money.. Value for money considering the fact that you get all of that for around 200 bucks.. 

Drop in if you still haven’t experienced it - it will be worthwhile..

The moment you heard Gol bari what comes to your mind? Yesh yesh its kosha mangso. If you want spicy tarkedaar mutton you must visit golbari once. They served 2 pieces of mutton with two paratha. Taste is good but a bit spicy.

My favourite since childhood. I have tried ten thousand different ways of cooking that kalo mangsho, but I never could. How charming is the combination of that mutton kosha and that dhakai porota.

A beautiful joint. Much awaited one !! Me and my Saptarshi Bandyopadhyay  had a meaty lunch there with their famous KOSHA MANGSHO and their legacy continues. Just 1 thing to advice - They should increase the seating capacity a little more, so that customers could seat much more comfortably. 
Otherwise it's a must visit !!

Its one of oldest places in North Kolkata, shyambazar and has been maintaining the quality ever since ! 
The roti that they serve is something very rare to find , only few restaurants serve such roti.

Went twice here. Landmark of shyambazar crossing. Very famous place but never been able to understand what's make it so famous!!! We took parcel of Mutton Kassa as it is there speciality, but gravy was too spicy and mutton pieces they served was only 4 small pieces and it was like rubber. We had to cook mutton again in cooker to make it edible. 

This place neither has ambience nor serves great food but still it's expensive compared to other restaurants in the area.

The food here was nothing close to my expectation.We had ordered a plate of kasha mangsho and 3parathas .The mutton pieces were very good but the gravy was just awful in taste.After tasting the gravy ,I was just feeling like oil was drippining into my mouth it was really poor in taste.The parathas were nothing lyk 10 rs. paratha.Overall it was just a waste of money.

Yes , like every other Bengali I too have grown up listening about the golbari er kosha mangsho and so finally gave it a visit.The eatery is quite shabby and cramped The seating area is very uncomfortable.Its better to get your food parceled.Ordered the kosha mangsho which came with a side of tamarind chutney and paratha and salad.The very sight of that rich brown gravy won my heart!and when I tasted it!oh Lord!It was simply bursting with flavour, although I feel that the pieces should have been a bit bigger.The paratha was almost oil free and the tamarind chutney so perfectly accompanied the rich mutton!Next ordered the mutton  breast cutlet and the chicken cutlet.now these two were average in taste.Nothing noteworthy.
Happy Eating!

Some might disagree with my review of this place but the standard has downgraded in recent times and the price is going up day by day. There's no doubt, it's the best place to have kosha mangsho in KOLKATA but I am missing the earlier taste. NOW the taste of Garam Masala is overpowering the dish and for me it's ruining it. But it is one of the most talked about place in Kolkata and nothing can change that. But to keep the name at top, you need to keep the standard on that same very place..

Don't judge a book by its cover-stands right for Golbari. 

Location : Golabri stands at 5 point crossing of Shyambazaar, this small eaterie is always full of people. 

Ambience  : Small, cozy, with tables fixed against the wall. A nostalgic place.

Food : Golbari is satisfying Bengali's craving for kasha mangsho since ages. Though the staffs are good but have a tendency to behave rude.  
We ordered Paratha with their legendary mutton kasha and a chicken kasha. Both were delicious. 
Served with Paratha, Onion and tamarind chutney the combination is a bomb itself. The mutton was soft and juicy. Chicken was tender too. He gravy was rich and tasty. 
The food is worth every penny. 

Pocket friendly. Highly recommended.

This legendary mutton place is my Dad's favorite, and he loves having their mutton kasha like anything. So, today I decided to surprise him and went and got two plates mutton kasha delivery.

This place and its taste never get old. I can't even recall how many times I have eaten their mutton kasha, and yet every time I taste it, it feels just the same, which is AMAZING.

For those who love mutton, and want to try some authentic taste, this is the best place to visit. They have no branch, and the inside sitting area is really congested, so I would suggest, instead of sitting and eating there, get a takeaway and enjoy it at your home.

P.S: 1 plate mutton kasha costs 205 bucks and if your order a takeaway they charge another 5 bucks for the packaging, so 210 for 4 pieces is quite fulfilling.

Golbari is in my bucket list from last two years finally I tried here in this weekend.

Located at the shyambazar 5 point crossing.

Place was cozy and tiny, seating is quite uncomfortable. I had paratha with their legendary Mutton Kosha. The mutton kosha was too spicy even foodie like me had problem. Taste was brilliant.

Service is blazing fast.

It was a funny incident. I had the Golbari Mutton Kasa and Paratha packed, and was returning home by bus. I was standing inside, and the bus was crowded. All of a sudden, a gentleman sitting in front of me asked me, "By the heavenly smell coming out of the packing, it seems like it's the Mutton Kasa of Golbari. Am I right?" Do I need to say anything more about this place, which has been almost analogous to North Calcutta?

Located in the 7-point crossing in Shyambazar, this eaterie is always full with people and can be easily distinguished and located. It has a seating capacity of 10-15 people with tables fixed against the walls. More of a delivery joint to be precise. The staff is not at all co-operative. The small space is the big trouble, here. Nevermind, coming to their famous delicacy, "Kosha Mangsho". Served along with Paratha, Onions and a tamarind chutney, the combination as a whole is a bomb in itself. Quality being top knotch and the taste being superb will definitely make one crave for their Kosha Mangsho more and more. Four pieces of Kosha Mangsho is enough for one to fulfill his/her hunger cravings. The mutton pieces are soft to chew as well. Priced on the higher side, the food is definitely worth every penny.

Did not try their other items as their signature dish will make you full at the end of the meal and you'll be left with no place in your stomach to incorporate any other dish.

They can do much better in terms of seating, service and the area of the restaurant.
Recommended definitely. Worth a try.

Food quality and taste : 4.5/5

Quality of the food is OK not so good and not bad, I've tried mutton brest cutlet, mutton kosa and mutton kima, taste of mutton kosa was amezing but later on i ordered mutton kima which was terribly spicy. Quality of the Parathas which were served along with was very bad.If taste is concern then it is a must visit place but if health it needs a second thought because all of the foods were excessively oily.But the overall service was good all of the above you must visit the place because of it ambience and taste, I think the sink area should be improved a bit.

Located just at the 5 point terminus of Shyam Bazaar. This legendary outlet satisfies the Bengali's craving for kansha mangsho since ages.
Went there after a tiring pandel hopping at Asthami evening with family.
Tried mutton their signature dish mutton kasha and mutton keema along with parathas.
Mutton kasha:Tasted absolutely Delicious. Although it was too much oily and spicy.Certainly not for the diet conscious people.Mutton pieces were tender and this dish absolutely satisfies the taste buds.Aroma of this dish will definitely raise your hunger.
Mutton keema:This dish was also oily and spicy.Tastewise its on the average side .Not up to the mark.
Paratha:It was soft.They served the parathas along with a tamarind chutney which was a perfect break from so much spicy dishes.
Don't expect any kind of ambience. Not at all a hygienic place.The place is too congested.
Conclusion:
Ambience:1/5
Food:4/5
Staff:A bit rude.3.5/5
Price:Affordable. 4/5
P.s.-A must try for those who love the charismatic old cabin charm of Kolkata.Their mutton kangsha is a must try.Their prices has gone up after gst which is not updated in the menu shown in zomato

'Golbari' is located at Shyam Bazara 5-point crossing and has been dishing out delicious food for a long time. We went here yesterday at around 7 p.m.

AMBIENCE: The shop is a small one with a small area reserved for sitting. If you are looking for a great and cozy ambience.,you will not be getting that here.

FOOD : The food here is amazing. We ordered one Chicken Cutlet,two Mutton Cutlets and mutton kasha with paratha. 
The Chicken Cutlet was absolute decadence. I can say that this is the best cutlet that I have ever had. The filling was filled with chicken. The outer coating was crisp and delicious. (5.0/5.0)
The Mutton cutlet was also delicious. The meat inside was delicious. (5.0/5.0)
The Mutton Kasha with Paratha served as a prefect ending for our meal. The mutton was soft and juicy and decadent. (5.0:5.0)

STAFF BEHAVIOR :  The staff behavior is good but they have a tendency to behave in a rude way.

Heard about this place from my dad from my very childhood... So, after so many years visited over there on Mahalaya wd my friends for a grand luncheon... The mutton kosha, the paratha and the mutton chop were so good that I still keep on talking about it wd everyone... Just the worst part is their restaurant's interior,it's too small and also non-ac... I know they will never change it just to keep that nostalgia of old kolkata... But if they had done it, it would have been better... People didnt have to wait in the long queue....

Being one of the most famous eateries in kolkata, this place doesnot need any introduction. It's signature dish Golbarir kosha ( mutton kosha) itself is a legendary food item. I have been visiting this place since last 10 years. The gravy of the MUTTON KOSHA is rich, flavourful and tasty. It tasted amazing with their parota and special Achar (sour and tangy).However the usp is the uniqueness of  taste, your taste buds will hardly find similar taste in any other eateries. Anyway, the sad thing is that the quality of mutton is degrading day by day. Nowadays mutton pieces are small, mostly bony, hard and chewy.
Apart from "Kosha", they also made some decent BREAST CUTLET, MUTTON LIVER, DEVIL and FISH FRY.
Sitting arrangement is another drawback. Non AC, Stuffy room, very much congested during rush hours. Therefore it is better to opt for take way.
The staffs expect tips and if they recognise you as a regular you might have chance of getting better mutton pieces.lol.

Golbari is famously known throughout the city for the Mutton Khosa but this place is also known for serving the city for quite a lot of time. They are still maintaining their age old legacy of treating us with the finest mutton khosa. They provide a lot of variety like the mutton khosa, mutton liver etc. And the best way to enjoy your Mutton khosa is with paratha or roti. Though the place is very congested and less spacious which makes people to wait outside in a long queue during Durga Puja or other festivals. But the wait will be worthy enough as this will satiate your taste buds and make you feel satisfied. 

If you haven't visited the place , go grab the mutton khosa as soon as possible.

Situated in shyambazar 5 point crossing... Small /narrow space restaurant.... Visited Many times since my childhood.. The only reason for visit this restaurant is their mouth watering mutton.
Mainly famous for kosha mangso(mutton kasha)... Which served with paratha, onion salad and chatni...
Once their mutton was one of the best recipe within North kolkata.
But day by day they droped their quality..
Their is nothing special in their food... So my suggestion is a big NO.

It was iconic once but to me it is more or less overrated now. Too much spicy and expensive. Quantity is not that good too. Only try if you like spicy food. 

Try out for Mutton Kosha. Delicious. Tasty. But as I said, it was too much spicy and oily.


Need a major revamp.

went here with a friend on last friday..it is near 5 point shyambazar crossing..a five minutes walk from metro gate 1.. we had the famous mutton kosha which had four pieces of soft juicy mutton and two parathas..though the mutton kosha dish is a bit oily, it tastes delicious..and the tetul chatni that they provide with a parathas is equally good

This place can seriously compete most other fine dining restaurants with its excessively delicious mutton kosha...The ambience is nothing like you are expecting but the food is beyond praise... It stands right at Shyambazar paanch mathar more... A platter of mutton kosha and paratha over here will give your taste buds an antique taste that you will get nowhere... To your kindest information, the place quotes an amazing price you can't think of.. Do give a visit to experience the taste of purono Kolkata

Heard about this place for a long time and last week we office colleagues went for this place. we ordered mutton kosha and parathas. It was a very pathetic experience. The mutton taste just awful.  It has only oil and oil and taste bitter. The parathas were ok ok. Very much disappointed with this place.

2nd time visit.. Charging too much as the name of heritage.. Quantity  much less as compared to price... Its not finger licking at all.. Recommend for 1st timers only.. Not 2nd time.. Also strongly not recommended for those who have stomach issue.. Too much oily & spicy.. Thats the only thing they maintained.. Taste is bitter than last time..

Everyone in Kolkata should at least taste the mutton kosha and porota of Gol Bari. It is just GREAT. Though the mutton kosha is a bit spicy, it is very very tasteful and mouth watering too. The place is a bit congested and have no air condition. There are a few more things in the menu but mutton kosha and porota is the best. One plate of mutton kosha and 2 pcs of porota and salad costs around 220. You should taste it.

The behaviour of the owners and of the waiters were the worst and it reached to such an extent while visiting with two of my female friends that we were about to lodge police complains with Shyambazar Police Station. They literally misbehaved with my two female friends by attempting to touch them and the ambience is not at all safe for girls out in that restaurant. They were literally using slangs while communicating between themselves, checking out my friends from their head to toe. The worst experience I ever had visiting a restaurant in Kolkata. So, my suggestions, don't ever go for this restaurant if you want a proper food and most of all a proper behaviour, if also not a descent one.

Right at the prime position of the busy crossroads of Shyambazar,this place is a must try for everyone. A local simile has formed due to this place,'there is nothing like golbarir kosha'!
The kosha mutton of this restaurant is surely a thing to try. Though over the course of last few years,the taste of kosha is deteriorating, but it's still worth a try. 
The seating place is very small. Service is pretty quick. On the front side of golbari,one can stand and eat cutlet or chop while having a chat with their friends or family. The spicy flavour of the fried snacks can add a little spice to your evenings also.

Golbari was an iconic place for its mutton kosha and related dishes. I am putting emphasis on 'was' because as of now Golbari lost its charm, almost completely. The fine dining experience was never its speciality, and now it serves pretty sucked up main dishes. And the downfall is not just gradual. Let's revisit the history of Golbari, it's nearly 95 year old and in 2006 it shut down the doors. Next year in 2007 Golbari reopened but the year long break made the difference in the quality of the food. From 2007-2012 they were good, but not that best, and in last 5 years it is just the mirage of the old flame.

Only thing they still excel in is the chops!

Been there once. Ordered mutton kasha, ruty and cutlet. Mutton Kasha is their speciality and it was yum. If you're ever there do try this item. But one problem is that if you want to eat there, the place isn't spacious at all.

An authentic place to visit in Kolkata and hence the fame.Tried the dish its known for - Golbarir Mutton kosha with Chapattis (Roti). The food was true to its standards, standing up to the spicyness and aroma of Indian as well as Bengal food.The service is reliable. The only concern might be the space arrangement which being small often leads to a delay in service.

Located at the Syambazar Crossing, it is a 3 to 4 minutes walking distance from the Metro gate. 

The place is not so big, bit small and you may have to wait sometimes. The service is good but you have to go to the counter to order the dish and then the token will be received by the waiter. 

Now the food. Their main dish "Mutton Kosha" is just superb. Alongwith parathas Mutton Kosha is one hell of a combination. You may also try the Mutton Jemma and Mutton Chop

P.S. If you are a Mutton lover this is the place for you.

This is one of the ancient place of kolkata. Where every kolkataians went atleast once in their life. This place is famous for the delicious kosha mangsho (mutton) and paratha. I will also suggest the devil , which is made up of a  half duck egg and other half of the devil is stuffed with keema and some masal, it's another signature starter of the golbari.

From the food I have had here, my opinion of it is that this place is overrated.Heritage alone cannot define a place of food.I tried their Parantha with the ever famous Kasha Mangsho and honestly, the experience was not good, at all.Grossly overpriced for four pieces of mutton and the day I had it, the gravy had turned bitter because of the over-cooked onions in it.Now, I don't know whether it was a one-time affair and I had a bad luck with the dish or is it just the way the dish is prepared basically.Whatever may be the case, I am judging it by the food I had here on that specific day and it does not show well.I really hope restaurants/cafes stop relying on their heritage factor and start churning out good food, the stuff people actually pay for.

This traditional eatery  was not that appealing to me. Having heard a lot about it, i decided to visit it all the way from batanagar route. Located at shyammbazar 5 crossing, it is a small place with hardly 8 People to accomodate. The famous MUTTON KOSHA is too oily and over cooked ( blackish colour almost). Paratha is too chewy and too thin. I believe that this place is overrated.

The best mutton kosha you will ever have. Contrary to what i have heard of late, that the quality of food has deteriorated, i would say it hasn't. Its the same taste i have had evertime for the past decade. What i have figured is , if you want to have golbari mangsho, you have to have it at golbari. If you take it home or anywhere else for that matter, the taste will not be the same, for what reason i do not know, but it will not be as good. May be because of the container or re heating once it is at our place.

Heard a lot about this heritage eatery. So decided to take the pain of traveling from behala to shyambazar. Surely the place is overhyped. Mutton kosha is surely tasty but nothing out of the world. Parathas were a bit chewy. Tried the chicken cutlets which turned out to be dry. The chicken kasha is too overpriced compared to its mutton counterpart. The ambience is cringe and claustrophobic. Still, id give it a 3.5 for its heritage and mutton kosha which was nice.

I have been there twice. Both these times I was not amused at all by their iconic "Kosha mangso". The seating arrangement is congested and was insufferable in last month. The Kosha mangso was too much oily and the parathas were hard to tear. Once I got the mutton pieces barely with the meat. The taste of liver dish was blunt, that was too immersed in oil.

The place is small and clumsy. We took mutton keema with parathas. The food is very oily but I guess thats what it is famous for. The paratha is simple. A single plate of keema is enough for two people. The taste is good. Can try it. But not a thing to be had quite often. And the fish fry and chicken cutlet were so-so. Would not like to have it again. :(

Finally, I stepped into the hallowed grounds of mutton lover Bengalis!!

This, was the thought going through my head as my friends and I were seated in the inner cabin of golbari.
After many lame excuses of not being able to be here  for one time , till now, I was finally there along with my childhood buddies, last Saturday (8th July).
It is situated right on the shyambazar more and absolutely nothing much to look at. However, their mutton kasha is revered as legendary by almost all of the bengalis.
Anyhow, I had one thing to order from then and it was the legendary mutton kosha along with porotas and
It was served in no time.  
The quarter of mutton kosha had 4 decent sized mutton pieces served with a pitch black coloured gravy with a layer of oil.The black colour of the gravy has always vexed me. I mean , how can anyone turn the gravy black without burning it!! 
The mutton was as soft and yummy as it can be! The gravy might be oily n black in colour was out of the world in taste. People might cringe at the sight of the oil floating on the dish, however legend says this dish wasn't meant for the faint hearted people! It was or rather is made for people who knows what an authentic kosha mangsho is. So I thoroughly enjoyed this dish.
The porota was nice too.

Before coming to kolkata I heard about this place. So oneday me and my friend made a sudden plan and went to golbari. This place is not about fancy decor or lovely ambience. This is more of legacy. The place is not hard to find it is right there at shyambazar panchmatha mor. My friend narrated it pretty well "Jedike Netaji takiye achhe" So we odered mutton kosa and paratha. They served us with salad and imly chatni. The mutton was such wonderfully cooked. The parathas were also good. If you are finding fancy then this place will disappoint you. But if you are foodie this place will fill your stomach with food and joy.

Surely an iconic outlet in North Kolkata. Their Mutton kasha is a legend which needs no introduction. However people having it for the first time, just keep in mind that it's a highly rich dish and will heat up your body for sure. The only setback is that since it's an old joint, don't expect to get the comfort of a modern day restaurant, take away is the best option

Mutton kosha - The quality degraded immensely ! The menu is rich but tremendously oily !! Taste might have a very slight change in the lower side but the quality of the pieces requires much more improvement. There is too much of bones rather than solid pieces. The quality of the curry must also be improved.

One of the the ultimate signature in great mutton dishes. Went there after almost two year, as the last time my experience was not so good. That time the mutton was under cooked and hard.  Was somewhat naturally reluctant to visit them again. Also, I have been there since last forty years, though it is possibly only once or twice I have actually eaten sitting there., that too long ago, when this place was not so crowded. But this time the meat was tender and yummy. God bless them. Request you to pack the kosha mungsho and paratha for bringing back home, so that you may eat them comfortably.

This place is legend itself. Every North-Calcuttian should try their legendary "Kosha mangsho" once in a life. They serve 4pieces which costs 195/- ! And their mutton kosha is heavenly!
But a month ago I tasted their Mutton kosha again and it was not that heavenly as before. And they served very small pieces!
And that's all very heart-breaking!💔
Hope they will back soon with their former taste!!!!

Hold on if you are already swept away by the hype of "Golbarir Kosha Mangsho". The quality has surely deteriorated a lot. Went with my friends during Durga Puja and had to wait for more than hour or so. And the result of waiting this long wasn't at all justified. The chicken and mutton kosha tasted good, but not something which will give you that satisfaction. The dishes were very oily. The price too is a bit high as compared to the quantity (and of course the quality). The ambiance isn't that good too. So less seating capacity, hardly 4-5 benches and tables. The tables too were so so small and one literally faces the wall while eating and that is disgusting. The restaurant doesn't look hygienic as well. 
My advise would be to parcel your food if you still want to taste golbarir kosha mangsho.

This one is one of the oldest eateries in Kolkata, located just at Shyambazar five point crossing.
Their seating area is extremely small, and gets unbearably stuffy in summers. 
We ordered their famed kosha mangsho and parathas.
They reeked of oil. Tasted somewhat okayish. I felt the place is overhyped.
Light on the pocket though.

Visited this place with my friends and this place totally disappointed us.
It might reflect of the old world charm with its cramped space and decor, but the place does not live up to the hype that it might have previously generated.
We ordered Paratha, Mutton Kasha and Mutton Keema.
The Mutton Kasha was dark brown in colour and sharpness of Chilli powder superseded every flavour (if there existed any).
Quite the same with Mutton Keema. The Mutton pieces has more density of bones and less meat.
And yes both the Mutton side dishes were very oily (They seemed to be garnished with extra virgin Mustard Oil!!!).

The Paratha was okay and yes they serve you generous amount of Onion Salad and Pickle.

Food - 2.5/5
Service - 3/5
Ambience - 2/5

Had been to Golbari a week ago, their Mutton Kosha is simply lip-smacking.
Mutton Kosha served with paratha was a good combination.
The Mutton Kosha with a balance of flavours was great though the gravy they serve with 4 small pieces of mutton was quite less.
The place is quite small and confined.

If you are a North calcuttan and you don't know this place, I pity for this asymmetric information on your side. 
I have been to this multiple times. 
Their famous mutton kosha is the usp of the place. 
Only if the place could have been a little spacious, it would suffice 
The place gets a lot suffocating.

Golbari Kosha Mangsho is itself a legend in North Kolkata. After our classes got over we headed straight to Shyambazar  to visit this legendary outlet which is much talked about. It is a small joint and non AC too. The ambiance is not so hygienic. But talking about the food  no doubt it was tasty, the Mutton curry was dark in colour . The Paratha was good. And also it is a bit overpriced.
People were speaking of the gradual decline of their food quality.

What can I say. The best kosha mutton is in town. The almost black colored mutton with lits of oil but its heaven once you put a piece in mouth. The paratha is also special as it is cooked in very less oil. The mete (liver) chochori  is not great though.

A heritage food joint in North Kolkata, this one is famous for it's amazing "Mutton Kosha" made with a curious recipe which tastes heavenly with paratha. The interior is really tiny and confined. Best option would be takeaway.
Prices are a tad high for a roadside food joint, but nobody complains as it is popular! No other payment option is available other than cash payment.
From my personal experience, the magic in its food items is deteriorating gradually.

It is not always necessary for a legend to have super flashy bells and whistles, and Golbari Shyambazar is the living proof of that.

A small humble joint, with neither an air conditioner, nor fancy sofa or free WiFi attracts foodies from all over the city and beyond, for one reason alone - the legendary "Golbarir Kosha Mangsho". The pieces of mutton cooked in a thick spicey gravy are just heavenly.

The delicious Mutton Kasha and Keemah Masala along with hot paratha will make you feel on cloud 9. At peak hours this place stays crowded, so there are chances of standing in queue, but that is totally worth the effort.

So if you are a gravy lover, who prefers their mutton bit spicey, Golbari is the place to be. It would be a cardinal sin for me to rate this place anything less than a perfect 5.

This place never needs an introduction.Situated right in the heart of Shyambazar you will always find people packing food or sitting inside and having fries or their famous kosha mangsho.Though with time,this place has detoriated a lot,still the heritage of this place attracts customers.If you are a Bangali,you have to have Golbari's kosha mangsho once in your life.I always prefer takeaway since eating inside is very uncomfortable but recently took a friend of mine staying abroad to taste the culture of this place.I am having food from here since I was a kid,and its dissapointing that they could not hold up the quality of the food.

Kolkata is an awesome place for a non vegetarian and Golbari is a must visit place. While watching the beautiful historic monuments, we asked local people about good places to eat. Most of them suggested Golbari. It's easy to find. A small place, more famous for take aways. We decided to eat there and ordered the famous Mutton Kasha and parantha. It's finger licking good!! 

Quick service, in budget for everyone and especially for travellers and foodies.

North Calcutta have always been my favourite. And I wanted to try this legendary eatery in North Calcutta. Located at the Shyambazar Five Point Crossing, Golbari is an extremely congested place with place for about 10 people. We had ordered its special dish, that is Paratha and Kosha Mangsho as well as Mutton Cutlet. Kosha Mangsho is extremely spicy and the taste is average. Overall it is a good place for college goers or office goers with reasonable prices.

Another age-old Kolkata eatery is checked out of my list of all the Old places to eat in Kolkata.
The Golbari Mutton Kasha is extremely famous and have heard of its praise for a long time. Since we were around the Shyambazar area we decided to pop in at the old place and get a take away. The mutton kasha was fantastic. Okay maybe not that fantastic the day we bought cause it was a bit salty. The next day after the salt got reduced, the one-day old Kasha Mangsho tasted fabulous for lunch. The fat in the mutton was amazing. The mutton is really dark in colour because of the utensils they cook in, so no need to worry about that.The best part is the texture of the mutton which was soft and tender with all the spices well infused and is not chewy at all even after you eat it a day later.
I loved the Mutton Kasha
Salt content must be taken care of. Other than that the mutton was great. Will surely try out the mutton kasha again along with some other delicacies of Golbari.

Golbari and Mutton kosha is dispensable. When one thinks of Golbari, mutton kosha automatically comes to his or her mind. Calcutta and Golbari'r kosha mangsho is interelated. As most of the Calcuttans I could not try anything from this plce but Mutton Kosha and Paratha. Whatever I say about it will be less. If you are a Calcuttan and haven't tried this place them it's just not done,please go there. Even if you are not a Calcuttan and want to have the true Calcutta flavour,Golbari is one of the places for sure. Don't go by its shabby appearence please.

The Kosha Mangsho of Shyambazar Goalbari is something people can even kill for. The dark black preparation of the mutton can bring water to your tongue tips in a matter of seconds. One of the best mutton in North Kolkata. Although health conscious people should stay away from this as it will fulfill your calorie intake for the next 10 days.

The place is located in d Shyamvazar 5-point crossing and its seating system is not that great. Otherwise in terms of food and pricing it is fine. Will visit again...

This is situated at the five point, shyambazar.
Pocket pinch for to taking there signature dish it will cost 216 as per March 2017

Basically a take away counter, but if you want then grab the deal with in its claustrophobic dinning place.

If you go there you should definitely order there signature that kosha mangsho & Paratha.

I also ordered there signature dish but mutton wasn't tender at all & taste is good but if you are first time then you will not able to judge the taste before how it was & how it is!!!

I thought now the restaurant runs with breaking it's old records.

Famous for kosha mangsho golbari has a different fame in this city. Located in shyambazar north Kolkata. Mutton was really nice but way too much oil in it.

Golbari as we all know is a delight for the ones who are craving for some good Bengali Cuisine! Its located at the Shyambazar 5point crossing. We ordered Mutton Kasha, Chicken Cutlets and Parathas! One disadvantage of the restaurant is it doesn't have any kind Of Rice. So if you are a Rice lover like me, u might face some problem. Apart from that The Parathas and Cutlets were awesome. Coming to the Mutton Kasha(which it is famous for) , I found the gravy exquisite but the Piece of Mutton didn't go along in taste with that gravy(Might be an off day).
But you should visit there once at least.

This is an old,iconic , no-frills eating place which makes sure that the food they serve is the real deal. I've tried their mutton and chicken cutlets, both of which have been well-sized and well-cooked. Their service is prompt, although they lack a proper seating arrangement. Their kosha mangsho and porotha combination is a treat- soft flaky porotha with mutton that's been cooked in a sinfully rich,thick, and flavoursome gravy. Clearly a lot of love goes into making the kosha mangsho,although it's not made for the faint-hearted! This recipe is a winner, for sure.

One of the famous old joints in kolkata but the place is not much spacious. At a time only 10 to 15 people can fit in. And this place is always over crowded so you have to wait for at least 15 to 30 mins to take a seat. This place is specially known for its mutton preparations. And yes the mutton kosha is finger licking..very tasty. But it's too oily and the paratha is also not up to the mark! A 4.0 point is only for the taste.

Golbari always comes along with the term kosha mangshow. In a brief "golbarir kosha mangshow". It is famous for its mutton kosha. Though very oily. But forget it. Which Bengali doesn't love oily foods? Okay. Only if you are not on a strict diet. ;) They have take away options. Having an Excellent location golbari hits the Kolkata nostalgia..

What brought me to this place was the cogent appreciation of everyone else who had been here. What I heard was that this was the place for you if you don't get why people like mutton. And yes, I was not let down. The Mutton Kosha is delectable, if we condone the fact that the excess of oil is rough for your stomach. The paranthas were thin and I felt they'd do more justice to the Kosha if they were thicker. But I congratulate myself for staying neutral for this judgement after the service we faced. 

My friend and I went in this evening. He has a big appetite and wanted three paranthas while I wanted two. We were refused and said that two plates can not have different quantities (what?). After some argument (which included the cashier saying that it makes calculation difficult), we got what we wanted. My friend wanted onions while I didn't. Same thing here: we can't have different things. Again some argument was needed to set it straight.

A place with good food is getting ruined because of bad service: possible the worst way of going down. It makes me wonder if this place (and may be some more) is running because of its past, when everyone seemed to be unanimous about its greatness.

whatever restaurants are out there does not matter, this is my favorite in Kolkata. especially Mutton Kasha, OMG.. how they make it like that. it is just awesome. It has a history and I feel nostalgic when I hear about Golbari. It still reminds me the old days. Almost every month I dine out here and taste is superb. The roti is unique here. I have never seen this kind of roti's in the whole world. must visit for all bongs.

Heritage stays with the quality and this iconic one of Shaymbazar kept the same. We took away the famous Mutton kosha and lachcha parantha for dinner and it was the same unique taste of Golbari as we had before. Health conscious foodies can drain out the excess oil.

I think there is only few people left from Kolkata who don't really like that mutton kima and kosa from this restaurant.  Apart from that you'll definitely get a feeling of vintage kolkata restaurant.  If you are near to this place do visit.  You'll fall in love with their blackish gravy mutton recipe.

Is this the famous place ????? I mean the restau is so small like a pigeon's hole,hardly 10 people can sit there,so congested ...Now coming to food....I felt nothing special in the mutton kosha,just too much oily.just nothing special.In 195 rs you will get 4 pc of mutton and comparatively the size is very small..
 Just One thing I found very good that is the texture of the mutton kosha.We had paratha too,that paratha was less oily and tasty...Overall I am very disapointed visiting this place... I will never ever go there...

Pocket pinch is affordable.

Ordered paratha , chicken kasha & fish fry. Paratha was soft & nice . Chicken kasha was very tasty but oily & spicy . Fish fry was soft inside, crispy outside with good fillings .

Overall a nice place to savour the taste buds.

I recently visited this place with my girlfriend. A tiny place, hardly any room for moving hand or legs . Ambience is just like a roadside shop. I ordered mutton kasha, mutton liver, fish fry and paratha. The base of mutton kasha and liver masala is absolutely same which was strange to me. Both are extremely  oily and spicy. Fish fry was really  soft and fillet was good. The mastered sauce (kasundi) served with fish fry was purely authentic with a very pungent taste which I liked very much. Paratha was not authentic as it was only a tawa roti tossed in little oil. But the mango chaney surved with roti was good to taste. It was a very average experience for me all over compared to the kind of fame they have.

Kolkata is surely a city of joy but it is also a city where you get mouth watering authentic traditional delicacies. One such place is Golbari which is standing tall and carrying it's tradition forward by serving the popular mutton Kosha and paratha. Although the place is very small and it's best if you can take it home. Apart from mutton and chicken kosha, keema is also very famous along with the cutlets. Service is good and the easiest way to find the place is by looking at the crowd outside.

This is the place you should visit. I personally am not a mutton fan. But this is the place which has made me a devotee of the meat. Just try it. Nobody makes mutton better than them. The hybrid roti paratha is irritating but the meat is too good to even concentrate on other things. The service is pacyand the food yummy.

Famous for it's Kosha Mangsho and Paratha,indeed a must try before you die.

The rich Kosha Mangsho is prepared with an array of spices and the mutton is indeed very soft and just the right amount of chewy.

Mixed with Tamarind Chutney and paratha one simply cannot resist it's taste and aroma.

A very pocket friendly meal and too tasty.

Will return soon...
Untill the next time,hungry for more...

After hearing about it several times went there with a friend. This place is famous for it's kosha mangso.

ADDRESS:   New Punjabi Hotel, 211, A.P.C. Road, Shyam Bazar, Kolkata.(near Shyam Bazar 5 mathar more).

It has very small sitting arrangements inside but we got our sits as we entered & ordered some kosha mangso with parathas.

I love mutton kosha & this was one of the best mutton koshas I ever had, the spices in the kasha was just blended perfectly to create a heavenly taste. Rating 4.7/5

The parathas were a bit oily though. Rating 3.3/5 
On many reviews it's mentioned that quality of food here was better before. But I don't know many places in kolkata, which serves better Mutton Kosha. So one who loves kosha mangso must try it once. This was my kind of place & I really loved it.

It is places like this that adds to the charm known as old calcutta. You know exactly what you want to order which is the mutton kosha and parathas. Though it is a bit oily, let's just say it is very oily i don't really care. It is damn good food and i would come back again and again. Small and cramped but still it has its own charm. Shyambazar without this place would really be incomplete.

Being a bengali and that too from kolkata, it is impossible that you won't visit this place once. I have been to this place a few times. Curious of its name and legacy it carries, took me to try their so very popular Kosha Mangsho. I felt the stories I have heard are all about their quality in those old days as I found nothing special in their dishes except being too rich and oily. A congested place not bothering much about hygiene as well. Its always packed up with people and I would say take away is the best option.

One of Kolkata's oldest and finest, Golbari holds a lot of heritage. The mutton they serve has set the standard for decades now. However the restaurant has not aged as gracefully as it would have liked to.  I am not really a fan of the parathas they serve but mutton kosha and mutton liver are just superb.

A beautiful experience. Frankly, the best experience I've had so far at a Bangali restaurant and too in North Kolkata. Golbari from childhood was a legendlike feel for us. Recently went to Shyambazaar  and though it was a takeway but after having the mutton kosha perfectly black in color. The bhuna onion paste was simply tantalizing with every bite but it was too hot and spicy not recommended for kids.....The mutton peices were equally good though a bit hard but thats the taste of mutton one loves here. 

But equally the cons were there : The place is running just on name, as the item is bit overpriced and quantity is too low.... Rest for Mutton Lovers it will be a Haven for Mongers

This place has made its way in almost all of the "Top 10 places to eat on Kolkata" lists and blogs floating around in the internet. But it failed to live up to it's expectations. The glory days are long gone. Although I've heard a lot of good words regarding this place but it is also quite infamous for it's declining food quality. I've been to this place recently and I wish I had the opportunity to taste the food in it's former glory.

Golbarir Kosha mangsho and Rumali roti are independent of any introduction or review. Be it their mutton chop, Egg devil, Chicken cutlet or Fish fry. Golbari is always a bliss for a foodie. I have been visiting this place for years now, irrespective of my school, college and now my office days.
Having said that, I have to say that this place has certainly lost its charm. The taste has deteriorated and there has been a surge in price. Yet Golbari and it's vintage cosy walls call you every time you are at Shaymbazar Five point crossing and you can't really ignore that, can you?

Very sad to rate this place so low, as it was one of the most buzzing and famous place of my locality, serving the ever delicious and lip smacking golbari r kosha mangsho, but over the years the quality has taken a severe hit, in my opinion it is unable to compete with the likes of arsalan & aminia. And they haven't changed a bit from time immemorial, no proper sitting place, no upgradation, and with that the distinct taste of the mutton has also vanished.

Being a calcuttan have a heard a lot about this place since childhood but never had the opportunity to go there.finally ,yesterday noon went there to have the legendary kosha mangsho .its a small place and the seating arrangement is not too comfortable.but at 12.30pm only it was buzzing with people.the kosha mangsho was a bit rich but the taste was lipsmacking.Infact the taste is still lingering in my mouth. To people who like their mutton rich and spicy its heaven.
P.s.for a plate of kosha mangho(4 medium pieces) with 2 parathas and onion salad it costs you 219/-(inclusive of taxes).

A beautiful experience. Frankly, the best experience I've had so far at a Bangali restaurant and too in North Kolkata. Golbari from childhood was a legendlike feel for us. Recently went to Shyambazaar  and though it was a takeway but after having the mutton kosha perfectly black in color. The bhuna onion paste was simply tantalizing with every bite but it was too hot and spicy not recommended for kids.....The mutton peices were equally good though a bit hard but thats the taste of mutton one loves here. 

But equally the cons were there : The place is running just on name, as the item is bit overpriced and quantity is too low.... Rest for Mutton Lovers it will be a Haven for Mongers

This place has made its way in almost all of the "Top 10 places to eat on Kolkata" lists and blogs floating around in the internet. But it failed to live up to it's expectations. The glory days are long gone. Although I've heard a lot of good words regarding this place but it is also quite infamous for it's declining food quality. I've been to this place recently and I wish I had the opportunity to taste the food in it's former glory.

Golbarir Kosha mangsho and Rumali roti are independent of any introduction or review. Be it their mutton chop, Egg devil, Chicken cutlet or Fish fry. Golbari is always a bliss for a foodie. I have been visiting this place for years now, irrespective of my school, college and now my office days.
Having said that, I have to say that this place has certainly lost its charm. The taste has deteriorated and there has been a surge in price. Yet Golbari and it's vintage cosy walls call you every time you are at Shaymbazar Five point crossing and you can't really ignore that, can you?

Very sad to rate this place so low, as it was one of the most buzzing and famous place of my locality, serving the ever delicious and lip smacking golbari r kosha mangsho, but over the years the quality has taken a severe hit, in my opinion it is unable to compete with the likes of arsalan & aminia. And they haven't changed a bit from time immemorial, no proper sitting place, no upgradation, and with that the distinct taste of the mutton has also vanished.

Went to this place last year.. i heard that this place serves the best mutton kosha in kolkata.. and its true.. we ordered two plate mutton kosha and 4 parathas.. it was mouth watering and delicious.. though i found the mutton kosha little  bitter in taste.. easy to locate the shop ..... the seating arrangement and environment is claustrophobic.. it will be good if u take away the food...

Golbari'r Kosha Mangsho. If you're from Calcutta and you love mutton, you must have heard of this place. My opinion - the place is Over hyped. This place was on my list for quite some time and maybe my expectation level was too much. Tried the "famous" Kosha Mangsho. The mutton pieces were under cooked and chewy, I tend to prefer meat that is so tender it falls off the bone. Moreover, it had a disgusting smell even though it was loaded with masala. The quality took a hit, the quantity isn't any good either.

Known for its kasha mangsho. It's good, but over hyped. There are many restaurant in Kolkata that would make kasha mangsho like this. The particular dish is excessive spicey; beware. One could try eating here - bread and kasha mangsho. The restaurant gives value for money but it's not one of a kind. A bit over-hyped.

I have no complaint with the space or inner decoration. But the quality of porota and mutton both were very bad. Mutton was very rubbery and porotas were cold. This is a hyped place

I haven't really went to this place ever but have heard about it from my dad for a quite number of times. I had been pleading him for bringing me some of the items from the menu. He got us : mutton keema ( minced mutton ) and mutton kosha ( mutton curry) 

The mutton keema was rich with flavours of cardamon,cinnamon,cloves and was really spicy. I loved it. 
The mutton kosha was nothing less. It was tasty too.

Review: Golbari

In innumerable bengali literatures the name has been mentioned, and definitely for valid reason, today we will review the famous food-joint section by section.

Location - 5/5
Exactly at Shyambazar 5-point crossing, it is hard to miss. Reachable from all parts of Kolkata either by surface transport or Metro-rail service, getting there is not a problem.

Facilities - 3/5
No dedicated parking, and you will have to do a fair amount of struggle to find even a paid parking spot any time of the day, round the week. Dinning & takeaway both facilities are there.

Ambience - 1/5
It is just a roadside small joint, best for takeaways, and try to avoid dinning inside that small claustrophobia-inducing small room with inadequate seating arrangements with disturbingly narrow contraption of tables along the walls. It is strongly adviced to buy the food and later to enjoy it at comfort of your own home.

Food - 4.5/5
This is where this tiny little food joint of north calcutta have won the heart of every carnivorous Bengalis. The Kosha Mangsho (Mutton Kassa) is a historically famous dish of this restaurant and for all right reasons. Preparations of mutton Keema, liver etc. are mouth watering, and chicken preparations are also very good. Price will never make your wallet cry, but the foods are surely tasty enough to bring you back to this place again and again.
Almost no veg dishes and absolutely no alcoholic drinks are available. Not much variations in non-veg dishes also except some popular preparation of chicken & mutton, along with few kinds of rotis and fast foods.

Service - 4.5/5
You order, and within a short interval of a few minutes your food will be served. Same goes for takeaway orders.

Overall - 3.5/5
This places looses out on the ambiance of the mostly, despite the super tasty food you get there. One of the top priority place to visit in Kolkata's food scene for any red meat lover, and you will be missing out a lot if you don't have a taste of Golbari's Kosha Mangsho.

This restaurant is present just at the periphery of the shyam bazar traffic circle which still continues with the same age old infrastructure in a pretty hygienic and well managed space. The authentic Mansho-khosa (mutton cooked in thick gravy) is fabulous in taste which is why it is highly recommended place when you are in kolkata but yes I do agree with the fact that that the amount of oil used to cook the dish is quite large which ultimately flows into the gravy making it a bit oily, but it happens with the best of the mutton dishes. The service is very quick. The paratha or parotha as they pronounce, was not like the paratha available in North of the country rather it was good and more like a tawa roti in shape. The chutney served will also definitely tickle your taste buds. The gravy is dark and very tasty, yum! :)

I was suggested by one of my friend to visit this place at least once before you die as it makes the best mutton curry a man can ever have. Wel i did pay a visit during durga puja and i was not sure if it is al local daal roti shop or something else. Forget abut comfort you can not even stand properly once you are inside. I did not know if it was mutton kosha or mutton ka achaar. It was oily..like really oily as shit and spiecy. Parathas were terrible and over priced. Still tasted good. Wel its famous in north kolkata as people say but definately not a must visit kinda place.

I ordered 150+ packets once for a office party and they did it with ease...they can scale up to any horizon I believe..
If you are foodie who can ignore comfort, ac or restautant's decor this is perfect place for you to try mutton....dont expect to get a proper seat here and try to do take away....

Have heard about Gol barir kasha mangso ever since I was a little kid. My mom took me there once too and I remember I found the mutton very very spicy. However that was a long time ago. I was passing by the place a couple of days back and decided to try out their mutton cutlet. I thought it would be hot, but actually it turned out to be surprisingly tasty. Moderately hot, not too much, with a typical coating of chopped onions and spices with minced mutton, they serve it to you straight out of the frying pan. It's quite a treat if you are in the mood for a quick bite and pocket friendly too.

This is that kind of a restaurant where you forget about standards, class, sex, race, and fight for those little chairs, if have the willingness to tuck your feet under those small marble slabs disguised as tables. So that you can savour the taste of heaven brought to you in the form of piping hot mutton Kosha. This doesn't taste the same when brought home in a plastic container, mind you.

They make the mutton kasa good, but its not out of the world. You will find same or better made kosha mangsho at other restaurants as well. Looking at the price range, I feel they are selling their legacy. Currently they sell 4 small, bony pieces of mutton, with 2 thin plain parathas and salad at Rs.211, which for me is not worth the price. Ala carte Mutton Kasa is priced at 190. Just one piece of Chicken Masala is 125. Mutton and Chicken chops at 25 each. Similarly the whole menu is surpringly pricey, considering its a dingy little space, hot inside like anything, with no ventilation or light coming in, non-ac, kindergarten chairs to sit, almost no place to move around too, and hygiene issue. The kosha mangsho is too oily, need to curb on it.

It will be best if you take away your Kosha Mangsho. Otherwise it's not advisable to sit and eat at Golbari. It is no longer worth all the hype!

This famous age old food joint is located near Shyam Bazar,Five point crossing.They are famous for their 'Kosha Mangsho' with paratha.But I think they are unable to maintain the quality of the food and taste now a days.All of their dishes are spicy and overloaded with extreme oil.They serve 4 small pieces of mutton kosha with 2 pieces of thin paratha and salad at about 185-195 rupees.(don't know their recent price) The seating arrangements are extremely congested and you cannot enjoy your food in a relax way.
Should Try at least once to feel the legacy of the place.......

Well its one of the oldest and well known places in Kolkata for Kosa Mangso and Paratha so..went there on the day I completed MBBS to buy Kosha mangso for me and my parents to celebrate. Being a food lover inspite of having a family of 3 i ordered 4 plates of Kosha mangso for the 3 of us. The Meat was really stiff and overcooked and the curry was bitter in taste... My mother cudn't hav it and it actually got wasted. Don't know whether it was my bad luck or its actually there special taste I don't know.. But It was a bitter experience for me and never went there since..

If one's looking forward to getting top notch service, ambience etc this place is a no go. The essence of this place lies in it's heritage and history. It's in the heart of every passionate mutton lover residing in Kolkata. One to be proud of. To boast off to the foreigners visiting us. So visit this place and indulge yourself in some of the "finest" full of spice and oily mutton dishes in town. Coz we Bengalis love the unhealthy and skip the diet chart off that gym once in a while. Peace. 😉

Been there once to try their famous kosha mangsho. We ordered that with paratha. Frankly speaking I couldn't find any difference from other restaurant. Even the mutton was not cooked properly and taste was little bitter. So I found it most hyped place or they are not maintain their quality which is the back bone of the food joint.

Golbari was known for it's kosha mangso . Nowadays what they are serving is not upto their reputation and very much over priced . We used to eat their mouth watering  kosha mangso with paratha and salad. Even when the joint was closed , their employees used cook from outside and sell it in front of the closed shop . That mangso was also same . But now it is worst .

I can live by the famos "kosha mangsho". A must for at least once during the Durga puja festival for me and family. The price has gone up but i guess the price hike for everything else around has a perfect explanation for this. Way to go 👍

This was one of the first takeout places dad used to bring food for us.mostly the kasha mangso ,tarka etc.i have seen the prices go from 60 a plate to 190 now i guess. The quantity is getting low day after day.but the taste remains mostly the same..but to be honest now many places serve better kasha mangso in quantity and taste than this.but sometimes its the special craving for this particular gravy..will never get old.

Surviving on the age old good name and great location at shyambazar five point, there isnt anything special about this place any more.
Steeply priced super spiced and oily mutton which u sud eat wen u want ur taste buds blown off. There is hardly any place to sit and a takeaway is the best option.
Make sure u have some antacid in stock and in hand after consumption of the mutton and paratha.

The legendary outlet of shyambazar didn't impress me much. Extremely small place, ideal only for takeaway. We tried the famous golbari kosha mangsho and paratha. Frankly I didn't find anything really special about it. May be, the nostalgic Calcutta feeling with renowned recognition brings lot of crowd here. But for me, I think it is over hyped. However if you are a food lover, you should try atleast once so you don't have any regrets of not being into this old legendary place.

Being a bengali "Golbari" holds a soft corner in the heart. Its always nostalgic to eat there.  Last wk my family decided to eat something old school and name of Golbari popped up instantly... We ordered very basic thing Paratha and Kasa Mangso.... Taste shocked me like anything. I have tasted bad foods but Golbari tops the chart now. Its really shit ....

I've frequented the place quite a few times and I must say, everytime the kosha mangsho and the parantha, along with their trademark tangy pickle, seems so delightfully delicious. The shop itself is legendary and it's reputation precedes itself. You should definitely try out this place if you are in Kolkata, for your culinary experience will remain incomplete if don't do so. My recommendation - have the mutton kosha and parantha (it's quite spicy, mind you).

The name itself is nostalgic enough to take you back there over and over again.
Located the heart of north Kolkata. 
Seating is not good, the chairs are appropriate for  children up to class 5. 
Food quality need not be mentioned as the mutton kasha can beat all gloominess. And the parantha with pickle  just  adds more to it. 
The mutton kutlet is droolworthy too. 
Never tried chicken there, so no idea about it.

Yes, it's gonna be a outlandish review, sorry to deviate from the perception of the great "legendary" Golbari.
Somehow I feel Gol bari is over hyped, may be because of the legacy it build in its name since a very long time
With the finest location at Shyambajar paanch mathar moore, the place draws attention with its big banner...once you get in you'll see the place is so cramped up, devoid of proper sitting arrangements and with some tiny shelves in place of tables, not even mere ceiling fans are there, only a few wall fixed fans...severely uncomfortable for people.
Now coming to food, we asked for kosha mangsho n ruti the obvious choice... Known for this delicacy we expected something extravagant... But as soon as I started off, I realised that they literally boil the meat in oil... So much greasy with tiny piece of mutton ...all of it was oil.oil..n oil. If this is called legendary so be it, I'm never coming back again.

'Golbarir kosha mangsho' if u r a bangalee, u must have heard of this phrase! It's superb. An age old restaurant serving the best mutton in town. They have got combos which includes 2parathas, mutton/chicken kosha nd some raw onions. Though there is a space problem at this joint, it's better if u go for a takeaway order. Mutton kasha with paratha which is also light nd tender deserves 5/5. Must visit this place.

Well Golbari serves you with some mouthwatering Mutton Kassa which i believe you will not get anywhere else. The price was a bit high but the taste was worth it.

Ambiance and Sitting arrangement are poor because of its low space capacity. Not to forget its one of the oldest places in kolkata. 

Please visit Golbari ones if you have not been there before.

There's no way you can miss noticing this joint at the shyambazar panch matha more.
It's smaller than a tea shack, unclean and suffocating.
It's high time they renovate the place or declare it to be a strictly takeaway food joint.
Coming to the food.... mutton Keema ,mutton kosha , chicken kosha .... they are all good to taste and are complemented well by the thin parathas.
Considering the price , the quantity and the fact that you are basically left with no other option than to pack your meal home... I would say it's expensive!
But then there's something so inexplicably satiating about the mutton Keema that i keep coming back to this place over and over again.

I had the famous bolbar mangsho and fish fry this Thursday . It's located right at the head of shyam bazar 5point crossing,heck it's apanara in itself. The place itself is very cramped and humid.  The mutton gravy was delicious but the oil caused me a little acidity which  shouldn't have happened. They are such a big name that they hardly give around 100-120gm of meat and still charge 190 for it which I feel is too much. The paray had are very thin and cost 9 rs. The fish fry was excellent though. I might come back again but for the price and quanity i doubt when!

Well being a long time establishment and well known outlet right at the shyambazar five point crossing the place was popular for its kotha mangso and porota but it has dropped it's reputation and currently thrives based on the old name... The quantity based on the pricing is too less and the quality has dropped to a high extent... It doesn't have a well seating ambience for a relaxing meal but still people thronged the place due to its quality mutton but a recent visit has been highly disappointing. Not worth it.

One of the oldest restaurant in kolkata. 5 point crossing was famous for golbari. But golbari has failed to maintain its quality over the years. Golbari is famous for its mutton kassa which is black in colour. Although colour is still black but it has not been able to maintain that authentic taste which it used to be years back. Price on very reasonable and service is super fast. Great option for take away

My rating is totally due to the quality of food they serve, to be  more specific. The "porota" n "kosha mangsho" is just so mind blowing! 
This place has a serious space crunch I must say. Many people prefer to take away the parcels from here. 
However, the food is worth the price paid, and the service is quick too.

Though it has been a long time since I last tasted the heavenly "Kosha Mangsho" of Golbari, the dream of that dark gravy of mutton kosha brings water to my mouth..yes you are right just now I did the srrrrrrr just while writing the review of this restaurant..this is one of those places where you don't even think of the ambiance or furniture or sitting arrangements and blah blah blah because Golbari has its own charisma..you just dip that special golbari chapathi into that dark beauty, fill your mouth with that, close your eyes and feel every bit of it with your tastebuds.... the prices are very low compared to many of the so-called five stars in the city where you are forced to be happy with the smile of the waiter instead of the food...anyway I am surprised to see that people have rated this old heritage just 3.6 in zomato..I am rating it 5

Living ten minutes' walk from Golbari for most of one's life has probably caused a degree of familiarity with the place that might have given way to contempt, as is the wont of such things. While I remember trying the kasha mangsho that most people associate with this restaurant and revere greatly, I have never found it to be that great, being more oil and bone than meat. Rather than that, I would recommend both the devilled chop and the mutton chop as far better in terms of quality. I've never sat there and eaten, so I can't attest to the quality of the service or the ambience.

Bought 'Mutton Kasha' from Golbari on 17.07.2016. It flavored really nice, but the rest is disastrous. The gravy was so bitter to eat and the mutton was not a bit tender. It was really hard to eat the dish. Pathetic experience. All the money got wasted. Very poor. I will suggest none to go there. Very bad!

Situated right at Shyambazar "pnach mathar mowr", golbari is heaven for good old bengali mangsho kasha, and by mangsho I mean mutton, though chicken is also available, its better to opt mutton. Having eaten many times from here,with my mom bringing it home years ago,this was my first visit to this iconic place. Even though it looks big from outside, it actually isnt,with just a few handful of seats available, but what it lacks in decor,it surely compensates in food,juicy mutton kasha and paratha/rumali ruti will make u realise how lucky you are to be a non -vegan! Apart from the more popular kasha,they also serve keema and few chop items.

If anyone guided you to Kolkata and if his or hers list misses out this then as a guide he or she is an utter failure. GolBaari basically looks around the Shyambazar 5 directional road. It might seem the restaurant is big but trust me it is extremely small so you might have to rush in during evening hours! Sit down and order porotha and kosha mangsho! Apart from that you can try the rumali rooti with the mangsho. Yes, the mangsho is mutton however you can also get it in chicken. So no chaap! I mean no chicken chaap. :D Enjoy!

If you count the few existing heritage bangali resturants in kolkata, Golbari will come in the first row. Popularity of Golbari in bengalee is beyond doubt. The name is so popular that people may not recognise the resturant by its actual name "New Panjabi Hotel". It became the landmark of Shyambajar crossing as like the Netaji Subhash Bose statue of there. Regarding their food I would just like to use only one word - AWESOME. I think this describes all. But to justify my rating of 4.0, and not 5.0, I would like to mention that their 'Mutton Kasha' with 'Paratha' is an unparrallel dish, but other items do not taste good. One thing to mention that all the foods are too much oily and very much spicy, so hold your breath and prepare your stomach before you try. The sitting arrangment is also very poor, better you parcel your food. Proper menu of them is absent in zomato, I am giving their latest menu here in the photos.

Update on 2nd September, 2017:
This is happening for the second time that the photo of the shop and their menu is getting deleted from this review. I don't know who is doing this. Reviewers should have their own freedom for writing review and photo uploading. Why are you people doing this shit? If you need review and photo according to your choice then you have to pay me. I have seen many people posting photos of their selfies in the food review. Please go and delete those....

Update on 5th September, 2017:
Again those two photos of their menucard and the photo of the shop is deleted from this review. I am again posting those two photos, and reducing their rating to 1.0

A great place to enjoy the old world charm of Calcutta in the 21st Century.. The restaurant itself is very small and always remains crowded all through the evening (after 5-5:30pm). As you walk to the restaurant there is a nice aroma of cooked spices that float from the kitcheen on the pavement. There is a takeaway counter and cash counter right at the  front as you enter through the gate. Most customers are regulars returning home from office. The great thing about this place is that it has not tried to change its decor and expand its dining area for what.. maybe 50 years or more. We ordered Parathas, Chicken Masala, Fish Fry and Mutton Kasas*. I've heard of people going to Golbari just to taste their Mutton Kasa, and after tasting this dish I knew why. It was a traditional bengali mutton kasa. The spice were cooked exceptionally well and the meat was tender.
The other items that we ordered were all good also. The chicken masala gravy was very well done with a chicken leg (along with thigh). I think in both the meat dishes the protein had so much flavor from the gravy that it will keep you licking your fingers and wanting some more.
The fish fry served as a good started - a well sized portion of fish.
All in all I have no doubt that this place is a local treasure . As I've said the decor or cleanliness may not be up to the mark of modern day restaurants but if you wan a quick bite of good bengali food you will love this place. If you asked me what should be your motto if you visited this place I would say: Get in early eat well pay your bill and leave fast.

Situated in the heart of Shyambazar five point crossing this restaurant has been there for ages. It has been a benchmark for mutton curry and trust me is one of the best you will get. 
The sitting arrangement is not so great so its better to take away along with the Parathas. 
Eventhough the restaurant's quality of food has gone down but still it remains as one of the best.

Sorry can't give it more than 2 out of 5.

Earlier it was my favorite in my life. Nowadays, quality is worst. Cheap quality of meat (available at market still at 290 or 300 INR / Kg where commonly muton is available at 520 to 550 INR/ kg ) are purchased and sold half boiled adding their that mouth watering gravy.

Also, at the name of quarter of mutton, they serve max 170 to 190 grams. @Very high price.
It's popular only because of its location and fools made it popular by their gossips.
They don't even wash mutton pieces properly ( / not at all) after purchasing from cheap meat stores. (Anyone may verify it)

Pros:1. Tasty mutton gravy
2. taste everything else other than mutton kasha

cons:
1. Worst quality of mutton ( very hard to chew / pull meat fibers by teeth from the  pieces served)
2. Too much costly (last Dec I purchased some 180 grams at 175 INR)3. very short space and very very bad ambience
4. extreme oily mutton and very wired spicy

If FDI is informed (without anyone bribes the officers), for sure, it will be closed.

This legendary age old outlet is a flag bearer for the cliché 'Less is more!'

This place needs a backdrop: This is one of the historically classic places that combine together like the pieces in a jigsaw puzzle to form an unmistakable image of 'Vintage Kolkata' - this along with Hand pulled Rickshaws, of course.

Must have: Mutton Kasa with Rumali Parathas, obviously!

Over the last 94 years, they have been serving us their signature combo of Rumali Parathas-Mutton Kasa, the latter being a dish very close to the hearts of most Bengalis and almost synonymous with Sundays in most households. They have probably the most modest looking menu one would ever see. But they don't need a fancier menu, for they compensate the lack of items on the menu with their most lip-smacking Mutton Kasa served with Rumali Parathas, which are quite light and go delightfully well with the hot but titillating Mutton Kasa. For me, the food was something of an epic event.

But I didn't hold back one star out of the five for nothing. Their is absolutely nothing sophisticated about this place - from the rather too simple food presentation to the shabby and off putting set-up. Of course, the first mouthful makes you forget all the things wrong with this place, but I've to be objective here. I can't say anything about the décor, because there is none to talk about in the first place. So I'd say a renovation is in order.

In a snapshot:

Pros:
-Epic Mutton Kasa with Rumali Parathas
-Minimal wait time
-Downright cheap
-Serves food till late night during Durga Pujas

Cons:
-Deserves some decent ambience, it being one of the city's heritages after all.
-Some might find the Mutton a tad too hot. Made one of my friends cry. So tuck in with caution! (Conversely, a treat for chilly lovers!)

One of the most hyped restaurants of ol' school Calcutta, till a lot of people swears by their 'kosha mangsho'.

My mom, while returning from office, used to bring  Golbari r 'kosha mangsho' and 'paratha'. 
 
the kosha mangsho is goat meat cooked in a rich thick gravy predominantly black in colour.
And I used to love it.

But recently, I had an opportunity to sample this delicacy and I hate to say this, didn't like it at all. Mutton prices were tough, the gravy was greasy and overtly spicy. Parathas were tough and Food quality is really questionable.

This place is iconic. The mutton is just so juicy so succulent so amazing. But health advisory -- the mutton preparation is so oily! Thick layer of oil on top.

2Nd visit to this place.. 1st visit had the experience  of paratha and their kosha mangso. Unique taste and colour. But A little bit extra oily and spicy. So health conscious people hit a distance from this place. Today i have chicken cutlet. Love the mustard sauce nd fresh onion salad. It was served hot and fresh. Chicken chunks could have been better and more in quantity.. but With the little budget constraints  .. it is acceptable.

A rating of 1.0 is an overestimation, believe me, else try yourself. 👍

I read other recent reviews in zomato and was not looking forward to this place, but it was a friends idea to try, hence this DEBACLE !!!

As soon as you enter this place, you would feel like entering a primitive cave, not designed so, but true to the lack of space, you will realize it when you would be asked to fit yourself in those small chairs in the corners.

More than the food, you may end up paying for the space, Shyambazar More.....

Coming to the food, i concur with the other users that the mutton kosha was more of bones, and less of mutton to go along with the so called parota/chapati. If youre as lucky as me 1 out of the 4 medium to small sized mutton pieces, would be a nice enough stong bone agitating you to the core !!! Now coming to the parota, its a fried thin roti/phulka... sort of half fried. That would cost you 9 rupees, if you opt for more than 2 of those. The salad was onion and beetroot sliced. Thats it, a colossal waste of money and time. Regrets, Regrets, Regrets #$^&**×-

Once famous, it is possibly the worst food joint in North Kolkata now. Keema is full of cartilages and fat globules, mutton kasha pieces are mostly chunk of bones and cartilage with few milligram of mutton adhered to it. Too much spicy dishes. Egg devils will cost you 28/ when it bears one fourth of an egg. Sitting arrangements are just for namesake. They are now only getting sale for their unique location and old brand name.Two piece of mutton with two pcs of paratha and one onion will cost you 211/ ! They are making us damn fools.

The old Gol bari restaurant still exists. The craze of the food still exists. Was there at 3:30pm which is past lunch time for most eateries and found it packed. If craving for mutton kasa and paratha is on but don't mind the grease this place should please you. The food menu is almost the same but the taste was better few years earlier, but still a good meal.
Recommend you carry a bottle of water if you are one of those, little fussy to drink tap water. Don't expect a comfortable sofa sitting.

One of the oldest in north calcutta, located near five point crossing of Shyambajar following APC road. I was an every weekend customer during my college days. Golbari is famous for kasha mangsho (though you will not like the paratha), egg devil,fish fry & cutlet. The gravy of kasha is too much oily but will love that dish. You don't need to think about bill, its very cheap. Less sitting arrangements and congested too (takeaway is the best option).
(P.S. don't go on a hot summer day)

We ordered mutton kasha and paratha. The quality of mutton wasn't good enough to digest. Gravy was too oily. If we had a knife it would be helpful to eat the parathas but unfortunately we hadn't so, we had to fight with the cool parathas. Horrible experience.

Gol bari makes mouthwatering mutton kasha. But that is about it. Right from the parota to the mutton chop, everything else is absolutely of unsatisfactory taste. 

But, you certainly must try the kosha mangsho.

Obviously a part of Kolkata's heritage, no complaints there. But the food used to be much better. I had high hopes and the food disappointed me to some extent. 

I was in the neighbourhood and thought of trying out the famous Golbarir Kosha Mangsho. So I ordered for their paratha and kosha mangsho. The order came really quickly. The dish came with onions and achaar on the side.

 The achaar was a mixture of tamarind and mango, and was lip-smacking! 

The paratha was really soft, though a bit oily in nature. 

The kosha mangsho was basically an 'oil-ki-dukaan'. It was very 'rich' but not necessarily tasty. The cooks who used to cook this legendary dish obviously don't work there any more. Nowadays the dishes are very poor copycats of the previously famous dishes. 

Disappointed, yes. But as a Calcuttan, do pay a visit, even if only for its heritage.

After hearing mythical stories about this place one evening some of us decided to give a visit  to this place.But to our utter disappointment we found what they call mutton kosha is totally some bones lying over a pool of mustard oil.The parathas too were rubbery and it took us to play a tug of war to tear it apart.Overall it would not be wise to give them even the pass marks.

This place is very close to Shyambazar metro, so one can reach easily. The eatery itself is very small and there is very little space inside. But if you are a true foodie you will definitely not mind the space or the crowd.

As for the food, we ordered the signature dish of Gol Bari - Mutton Kasha and Paratha, about which we had heard so much. Mutton Kasha was undoubtedly great and the mutton was soft and melted in mouth. The pieces had more bones than flesh, and that is the only thumbs down about this preperation.

The gravy was oily and spicy but you can't complain about that as mutton kasha is supposed to be like that. To me it tasted just perfect and surprisingly it was not heavy on stomach. The parathas were too soft and Gol Bari can do better on that front.

Over all not a bad experience.

The charm associated with golbari is something which is very special to every bangali out there ... This charm triggered by my love for mutton dragged me to this old little place.... Had ordered what golbari is famous for- the kosha mangsho and paratha....the mutton seemed a little undercooked as it wasn't very soft instead it was chewy but the gravy and the paratha was good...
There are certain places in Kolkata which deserves a visit because of it's old Calcutta charm and the heritage associated with it and golbari is one such place.. So every person should pay a visit atleast once...:-)

OLD IS GOLD ! But the kosha mangsho is like silver , though it is old . Lot of spices and ghee is just not enough to make a delightful mutton prep. Paratha is too bad , which is the only bread item in the circle-house . The achar is good but not so fresh , so as the salad ; which is only comes with onions . Still , you can be there for once , or maybe twice . But not more than that . Enjoy fellas !!

Golbarir Kosa mangso holds a very significant place in the culinary heritage of old Kolkata. Being a foodie I am bound to be lured to taste the Golbari's  signature dish specially when the seniors of my family say it is the best in the city and according to some it is the best mutton dish that they have ever tasted.

 It is not that I am very health conscious. I really love spicy food. But there should be a bearable limit to ingredients added to any dish. They had prepared the dish as if they have a target to use up all the oil and spices available in the markets of the city. The dish is infact  blackened due to excessive use of spices and its even salty. After a while I couldn't even consume it anymore. I was shocked to see that my experience is drastically different from others. So I gathered the courage to go for a second attempt few months later thinking that something unexpectedly went wrong the 1st time. But my goodness! The dish tasted exactly the same this time. To be on the safer side I had also ordered Mutton liver this time. This is was much better and I could finish my paratha with it.  The mutton kasha absolutely did not go well with my palate.

Bongs do have weakness over mutton apart from fish and rosogollas. 
And whenever you hear about Mutton Kosha the only name that comes to your mind is "Shyambazar Golbari".
Older than time this place serves the best "BANGALI MUTTON KOSHA" in Kolkata.
Situated at Shyambazar five point crossing.
The tables are packed in quite a bit and are fixed to the walls with small chairs where you would need to fold yourself and then sit straight. 
But the mutton kassa along with parathas , chutney and salad tastes incredible.

But I have heard sometimes back that the place had shut down and taken over by another owner (New Punjabi Hotel) who has failed to live up to the age old reputation of the place but still I liked it.

Known as one of the oldest restaurant of the town and famous for its blackish brown mutton kassa. But I personally don't liked the food a bit. The mutton kassa was bitter in taste(I think it happened for using extreme portions of whole hot spices) and the paratha as well was too hard.

Golbari's kosha mangsho! Whenever I am in Kolkata, I visit this place. Not because of just the food. But because I feel like my time at home is incomplete without making a visit here. The mutton gravy is too spicy for my liking, to be honest. But still I go for it, simply because it's so different from any other place. Make sure to visit Golbari in case you are new to Kolkata.

Golbari is like Old Delhi's Kareem but on a lower scale with a  little compromise on their quality!!
What is used to be is no more. New owners have tried to retain the old recipe n mutton charm but have not been upto the mark.

The meat is hardly there, it is only bones n fat. If one eats with only the grave after buying n hoping to eat "mutton" is actually disappointing..

When it comes to traditional Bengali food- with lots of oil and spices- there are few places that can take better care of you that Golbari. The kosha mangsho and porota combo is synonymous to Bengali expression "Ja ta bhai". To amplify the joy carry it over to the bagbazar ghat and binge like the nawabs used to. Things don't get any better than that. And as always, kobji dubiye khao mama!!

Old days, North kolkata charm, traditional mangso r porota, what more do you need to give pleasure to ur taste buds, wish the place would have been supporting a more sitting oppurtunities, only cons are the space and the congestion rest fine.. Still u can enjoy food standing outside because afterall Shyambazar more have own flavour. :3

Well, I have been visiting this place for long. This is I think this is one of the oldest restaurants of Kolkata maintaining a legacy. Their rumali roti or paratha with Mutton Kasa or Mutton Keema, is one of a kind. These are must try. Probably the best mutton and roti combination.

We all know this out let for its famous "Koshaa Mangsho". I used to go there in every durga puja sashthi for enjoying that famous chicken curry with laccha paratha. The place is small that is why i never found this outlet without the crowd. Huge number of customers are the true identity of the Golbari.

Golbarir Kosha mangsho is one of the famous dishes of Kolkata. I really like their mutton liver curry. But one thing they use too much oil and spice which makes the food tasty though. But health conscious people may not like it. The decor or seating arrangement both are not good equally. So a takeaway would be the best option if you want to taste their delicacies.

This is located right at the 5 point crossing at Shyambazar and is one of the oldest eateries out here in Kolkata. We ordered for mutton chop and fish chop. I believe the mutton chop were not as good as it tasted few years back but the fish chop was good. It's always good to be here but recently their quality has detoriated from the olden times but in all you can try this out for those evening snacks cravings!

One thing you have to keep in mind while having a meal here is that you cannot be very health conscious. The food here has generous helpings of oil and a lot of spices. Add to it the unhygienic conditions. The only reason you should eat here is for the taste. The place is very small. Definitely does not score at the ambience bit. You often need to adjust your chair to allow people to pass by. The tables are very small. Now coming to the food. The mutton was delicious. Had a lot of oil, but sure did satisfy the taste buds. The added bonus was the tangy chutney they serve along with it. Had porota with the mutton which was average. Very easy on the pocket. Best will be to pack the food and have it at home.

Golbari r kosha mangsho is an institution that Bengalis will swear by. However, it would seem that the quality of the dish is on the decline. Personally, I found the mutton pieces to be tough to chew and not meltingly tender, but the gravy was quite nice. Spicy, hot and leaves you gasping in a few mouthfuls. Still, not worth the hype.

A heritage food joint in North Kolkata, famous in history of Kolkata for it's Mutton Kosha which tastes deadly with Parathas. This arched nostalgia located at the junction of APC Bose Road and Cornwallis Street. The interior is really tiny and confined. Prices are also quite high for a road site joint. No other payment options are available other that cash payment. But the magic in it's foods steals the show.

Visiting this place almost after 16 years. The demand seems to have reduced since I didn't see the crowd outside this small ionic shop as it would have been ten years back. Having said that, the mutton kosha still remains the best I have ever had. There have been many Golbari versions, but the original remains the 'baap' of all. Clean, tidy and small place which every meat lover should visit.

Possibly the one of the best kosha mangsho I have ever tasted!!!! I know that's what most people would say as well, but it's actually true! I had tasted their kosha mutton at a time when I was not such a big fan of mutton. The place was small, the weather scorching, and my stomach was making noises. But that 1st bite into the gravy itself changed everything..... I would have liked it better if the place had better seats, and maybe a wider menu. But what can I say, I'm kind of biased, even about that one dish.... Over and all, a must try place for meatlovers.

The words 'Golbarir kosha mangsho' in a Bengali adda is frequently heard. Their mutton kosha, delicately perched in a spicy dark-colored oily gravy, teamed with soft rumali roti or 'gorom gorom phulko loochi' can be a Bengali mutton lover's heavenly delight. A 'Bangali' must have a taste of their kosha mangsho.

This place is a heritage place, though overhyped. Mutton kosha is d dish one should try and anything else will just disappoint. Ambience is very poor, though subjective if u consider it to be a heritage place as I mentioned before. Staffs r just as supposed to be at a old roadside joint, pretending to be super busy. I cannot comment much on the hygiene factor also, coz I feel it to be sub standard. But anyways the mutton kosha was d only thing i went there for and it did'nt disappointed me overall.

Golbari is one of the heritage eatery of Kolkata..well known for its kosha mangsho. But it depends on your luck whether the meat will be tender or fibrous. The dark coloured kosha mangsho along with paratha is very spicy to my palette; not suitable for health conscious people.
This place carries the culture of the city of joy and hence must be well maintained

"Oh amar 'Gol Bari' tomar porey thyakai matha" aha!! I don't wish to write this review in English but for a greater cause for Humanity at large I have to do it. If you are in "Kolkata" and want to experience "Calcutta" don't forget to dine at "GOLBARIR BIKKHATO KOSHA MANGHSO" you may take a parcel therefrom as well. The speciality of the Kosha Mangsho is its colour, the Thick Black Gravy it is because of tamarind and all whole spices they use, you can easily feel the texture of the gravy individuality of main spices are absolutely intact and Parota (Paratha). The GRAVY may seems HEAVY (pardon my poetic skills) by its look but mind you "looks can be deceiving" so just go for it :D very light gravy, well cooked meat, medium sized parota, chopped onion, Kasundi (bengali mustard sauce) and a glass of chilled water! pure bliss! ambiance seems like a temple to me as I worship food, small, congested yet clean and well-lit, friendly and well behaved staffs make it homely. I tried Fish Fry and Chicken Cutlet, keema kosha, chicken kosha are other attractions there but it is THE GOLBARIR BIKKHATO KOSHA MANGHSO after all, so TRY before you DIE (I just can't leave my poet behind) :P

Its a 109 year old outlet with a reputation for the "kosha mangsho" & paratha.....legacy, a stamp of Kolkata, damn good taste & still lighter on the pocket.....well this is a deadly combo 👍👍.....had the chicken cutlet, fish cutlet & mutton keema with paratha at the outlet itself (while the first two were pretty ordinary 👎👎, the outlet probably trying something outside their core competency, the keema was quite lighter & rocked👍👍....). Added to it, had kosha mutton & paratha at home too, mom was flat 👍👍 & my old woman was on the verge of awarding a 6/5 ☺. However, here's the reality check....they have not moved with the times, should have come up with a modern restaurant (if not multiple branches) at least, there's no proper & hygienic seating, washing or a wash room👎👎👎👎👎👎....guys please spread your taste & gift to the world.... here's an overall 4/5👍👍

Visited this place quite a lot. Most of the times I parcel food but once I was there for lunch. We ordered parantha, mutton kasa and fish fry. I find the mutton kasa too expensive ! The size of the mutton are too small. The mutton pieces are hard and one has to struggle to chew them. They charge a lot for just four pieces of mutton. Mutton kasa is so oily that the curry is less and the plate is full of oil. It is supposed to be famous for mutton/chicken kasa but i don't find that speciality in the mutton kasa they make. The parantha was plain and thin. I think for plain parantha they over charge whereas as that price i get lovely lachcha paranthas. The fish fry was average and it was full coating rather than fish. The ambience is horrible with poor lighting and sitting arrangement. They really need an upgrade in the ambience part !

There was a point in time when I was not even aware of this place until I was introduced to it by a friend many years ago. The paratha and Kosha Mangsho was heavenly at that time. 

However, during a recent visit it turned out be exactly opposite of it. The Kosha Mangsho was hard, chewy and for some reason tasted bitter. The only saving grace was the paratha which was light, non-greasy and soft.

A legendary place of kolkata for Mutton lovers. Me being from South Kolkata, used to visit this place in every Durga Pujo. It was fixed plan (choke badha) go to north kolkata, visit college squire, and other north kolkata's famous pujas and then got to Goal Bari, stand in line 2hrs minimum, eat famous kosha mangsho and continue for the rest of night. 

Golbari is nostalgia... passed from generation to generation. Standing in line for the smallest of restaurant was such a beautiful moment spent with family and friends was one of my best moments in life. I can only thank dearest Goal Bari.

If you are feeling too flat and blue. Try this famous food joint. They have the spiciest of Mutton ever, that will make you lure across and they serve it with hot parathas dipped in butter. Oh my! I love it just so very much. But the who ambience is a big no no. Do not go there in summer, you will sweat out everything you eat. Its a wise decision if you parcel your food and relish them at your living room.

Golbari is a North Kolkata classic.Famous for its Kosha Mangsho, it has been at shyambazar five point crossing for decades. We took the staple paratha and kosha mangsho here.

Well.. Shyambazar er Golbari. It has become a word of nostalgia over the decades for those who know this place well and for a long time. Today this tiny little eatery is more than just a brand because of the vintage and oh-so-spicy Kosha Mangsho. This place is not for those who cannot tolerate much spice on their tastebuds. Even you can clearly notice the excess oil content almost dripping out of the dish they serve in along with 2 parathas, add to that a pinch of pickle. Although apart from this, egg chops, pakodas and some other fast foods are also available here, but they have never got their share of respect in comparison to the Kosha Mangsho. And that is quite justified since they're pretty ordinary.

P.S. Dont expect for any sort of ambience or cosy seating arrangements. Coz this place is quite claustrophobic and hot and add to that, the spice of Kosha Mangsho. mahnn.. you'll be sweating uncontrollably if it's not winter.

Located very close to the Shyambazar Five Point Crossing.
Golbari is an old aged restaurants and sounds legendary. So had been there for the first time.
As soon as I had entered could find a small passage to enter and get my seat. Oops ! Half broken chairs, I mean.

The ambience ? Horrible. It's so clumsy. More than five people can not be accommodated. 

Had ordered both Chicken and Mutton. Both seemed as if it was soaked in oil. It was satisfactory to my taste buds.

Staffs are okay. Could be improved.

The space must be made bigger to make it grand.

Overall, good to try for the first time. Just the 'First time' ! :)

This is my 5th visit to this place. The place is small and old. You will not find it very attracting by the look. But they serve one of the best kasha mangso available in this city. If you are anywhere near shyambazar and crave for eating well prepared mutton then just pay them a visit. but if you are a health freak then do not go as it is very spicy. The only disadvantage is that the prices are very very high. But does not matter. Will visit again and again.

A katori of mutton kasha from golbari
Is similar to holy grail of divine pleasure..


Don't trust my words..have a bite

Authentic mutton kasha..

After a long time..

Mostly a take away center but also having a seating area..

Popular for its famous golbari pathar mansho kasha and parantha..

Quality has degraded with time..

Yet it takes time for an iceberg to melt..

Especially if it is a giant one..

I've been to golbari thrice, all the times I've loved it. It's not a place which is fancy, rather it's quite cramped. It's great if you want to have a different "budget eatery" experience and despite of that, experience great taste and authenticity. Golbari has a special secret recipe for cooking it's "kosha" mutton, which is to be enjoyed with parathas or breads.the place is just in front of the five points crossing, shyambajar. Golbari is an experience, everyone of our city (and from outside) should at least have, once

Had listened a lot about this place for a long time and finally had the chance to visit it. First of of the location of the restaurant is at a very nice place hence it is very easy to find. Just take a walk from the shyambazar metro station to the 5 more roads crossing. It is there. Hence full marks for its position. 
Now coming to their exterior and interior i must say there isn't any speciality more over it looks more like the roadside small hotels so is their interions. Nothing special at all atleast it is clean it is the main part. 
Now coming to their food we had their trademark dishes mutton kasha along with paratha. I had to inform that the menu zomato had, has change a bit as they have increased their prices. Mutton kasha now cost 180 per plate. Parathas are 9 rupees each. Moreover they also charge some extra for the onion salad they provide. 
Mutton kasha is average in taste but contains too much of oil. So much that anyone can see that in my attached picture. Hence very much unhealthy.. 
Parathas were a disaster too as they were cold and hard. Even the foodstalls outside my college serves better parathas than this at much lower price. 
Only good thing is the imli chutney they provide is little bit good.. 
Can't say whether i will visit here again or not...

Kosha mangsho is what it is famous for. Do not expect a great ambience if you want to dine in. It is more of a heritage place to eat. But you could rather choose the takeaway and eat at home. I am giving the rating primarily for the food. You must try once, and if the kosha mangsho suits your tastebuds its all business for Golbari then!

It's not a proper eatery , where you can sit and eat , it's good if you take it back or if you want to feel the nostalgia of the place u can obviously have your food there !  I didn't like the food much though !

Golbari doesn't need an introduction to Bengalis. But I just would have been more happy if they would have maintained their quality or who they were 10 years back. The oil in the mutton kasha has just thickened multiple times and solidified over the years
. That's kinda heavy on heart! Didnt enjoy the meal at all. Never mind. Life goes on and things change. Would feel much better if they imrprove their qualtiy.

Have dropped in for dinner tonight. This legendary restaurant serves it's timeless delight,kosha manghsho and porota. Mutton liver masala is equally good. Service is quick,ambience is average. Even though they serve oil dripping curry,no bangali can refrain himself from going there. :D

Legendary restaurant!
One of the oldest and one if the best..
Which calcuttan has never heard of the famous golbarir koshamangsho.. The food tastes tremendous. But mind you the food is spicy.. So watch on your intake.. Not recommended for seat and dine there.. Take away and enjoy It at home.. Bon apetit!

I was astonished to hear that "Golbari" has been closed for indefinite time. It is one of the most heritage place in north kolkata even after being the most oily and spicy restaurants. However, the place has been reopened recently and everything are back as they were before. The first thing I like about them is the simplicity - no show off, simple menu. In a scorching summer noon, you enter this place and first have the cold water in a steel glass - you would feel an unparallel refreshment. This is followed by that thin paratha like roti, onions in ultra violet color due to prolonged dipping in vinegar, that BLACK mutton kassa - I have heard, tgat they use papaya and tea liquor for fine boiling of the mutton and bringing that signature color. A must visit for a true bong!!

Tried the kosha mangsho and paratha here at this place few times. But every time it was because of some work related visit in the nearby area... It is not ver must visit olaace though it has lots of hype... the dishes are very rich and unhealthy if you are helth concious the i will tell please avoid this place to be on the safe side, the place is old... but the standards must be improved, the mutton dish is ok in taste.

It is not new to the people of this city that this place is known for the famous "kosha mangsho " . Now i am addressing to those people who somehow have not managed to come here and have already eaten a lot of mutton delicacies . For them i truly believe the experience would not be that grand . First things first frankly no matter what people say to you , donot order anything other than the " kosha mangsho " . I mean strictly no. We had :-

1. Fish fry 
2. Mutton kosha 

The fish fry was the most awful fry I have even eaten in my whole life . In fact I didnot complete it . There was little fish in it and it was stale and cold . The kasundi was so spicy it almost gave us a heart attack . But let's not stress that because people donot come here for the fries . I just mentioned it so that people donot get misled . 

As for the mutton let me describe the dish in details . It was very very very rich . I mean infinitely rich , which I guess is evident from the pics . But it is not spicy . The mutton pieces are not something to be happy about . There are 4  pieces in a plate and 2 of them are tend to be very very bony . As for the taste I will say yes it is good but not amazing . But I think this can no longer be described as something you should be bragging  about . But for a onetime experience every should have a try . I mean why not , if u don't try it how will you know which dish u will try again and which ones not .

Awesome tasty mutton kasha. The restaurant is popular for its Kasha Mangsho.
The mutton kasha is awesome. I never had such mutton item before. We ordered mutton kasha, chcicken kasha. Both were awesome in taste specially the mutton kasha.
The mutton kasha was very much spicy and the chicken kasha was medium spicy. They offer a chutney with the paratha. Their chops and cutlets is also good in taste. But paratha can be called roti. They are not paratha. They are close enough to roti.
But the resaturant is very very small. It is only for take away though there are sitting arrangements but you simply cant enjoy the the taste by sitting there. The dinning place is very congested. So it is not ideal for dine in .
The place gets very much crowded sometimes. So you may have to wait for some time for both dine in and take away.

Golbari is a small hotel at one side of Shyambazar More. It has its name for its Kosha mangsho...  Just after a busy day of college me and my friends decided to have kosha mangsho in golbari ... 
We visited there in evening ... First of all it's not easier to find at first time by following GPS ... 
Golbari has just a small space inside for seating...  The best dish was Mutton kosha and Ghee roti ... the dark red coloured Mutton kosha was bit spicy ...
We also had Chicken chaap , Fish fry and devil ... but those are just as normal as of any street stall... 
Only Mutton kosha is what Golbari is known for... But foods are too spicy as you can have a idea from its dark red colour...

Firstly, the place itself is dingy, so home delivery is preferrable. i have been tasting their food for almost 6 years and the quality has gone down.About their famous kosha mangsho.....the gravy is over spicy with no distinct taste and the four small mutton pieces are often under cooked. but the price has almost doubled in the past 4 years I would no longer recommend it to friends.

The place : a dingy old place near the shyambazaar police chowki. The place is thronged with people for its fabled kasha mangso. Forget the ambience, it's a a hardcore eat out with no care for ambience seating and presentation.

The food : the kasha mangso is dark juicy and tempting. However, I would still rate it an excellent second to that of my dida's. The liver is also cooked in the same gravy. They are gracious enough to give you liver as well as mutton. The keema is also a good try out. Though I would place karim's Delhi as a better one. The parathas are extremely chewy and elastic. Better get your own rotis from home!

The staff: is friendly. I was pleasantly surprised when they got me a cold drink from the neighbor amidst the rush hour.

The emotional quotient: I will definitely come back here.

The verdict : must try out for the food lover. Kolkata is incomplete without trying you the kasha mangso.

Yesterday's dinner was utter disappointment. Had eaten there 3-4 years before and can firmly say that the quality has degraded a lot. Mutton chop: could not finish the whole of it. 
Mutton kosha: mutton was not at all soft (mostly due to less boiling, I guess) and it was too salty. All in all, none in my family was satisfied.

Been eating in Golbari for years! Maybe for almost 18 years. Love the food there, the Kosha Mangsho is amazing out there with their Porothan! Tried their Egg Devil last week, it was really tasty. The best thing about their food is that medium of cooking is of good quality! The fish fry and chicken cutlet can't be missed as well. The Fish Fry is spicy and has the right punch of flavours in it.
Would keep visiting Golbari, and still would never feel that am bored of their food.

One thing that i left this place with was disappointment. The reasons are as follows,
the food is extremely overpriced given the standards,very small mutton pieces and the quality was definitely way below the mark. 
The parathas were horrible,priced at 9 a piece they are just elastic to an extent that its literally impossible to tear them.
 I am pretty sure they were not prepared anytime soon,just kept warm.
 The food was extremely oily,and although that was not a concern for me,but the fact that it caused some kind of uneasiness afterwards is really disappointing. 
And this comes from a person who eats from roadside stalls like anything.
They charge an extra 3 rupee for onion which is kind of sad,as they dont even bother asking you whether you want it and simply charge you instead.
It has some kind of a strange color and is nothing close yo fresh.
I won't say the food was bad,but given so many issues i dont think that could fetch them any more.
This 2.5 is mainly for the awesome devil and cutlet that they make,try those,they are really good.
As far as main course is concerned ,for me its a complete no no unless they raise their standards.

The Golbari is now almost a disappointment .. except the rich flavour of the Mutton kosha which is unique and magnetic and you will surely fall in love with it. What made me sad was the quality of mutton used. The pieces were small and not the very best.

Price is again a minus point... At Rs202 a plate for 2 paratha and 4 small pieces of mutton and chopped onion cant be justified. Paratha is not their selling point and is very ordinary. The decor is very poor. Chairs are of micro size. There is practically no service .. you have to pay money , make the bill, handover the bill and then wait for the food. 

With such a system in place, you need to have mind boggling food which Shyambazar Golbari didnt have... 
The erstwhile glory has faded away..

 ac and fancy drcor and get lost in the nostalgia of food..

Heard a lot about this place and no gastronomical journey in kolkata is complete without a visit to this place. This age old outlet some say literally 100 years old was famous for its kosha mangsho. But honestly what i tasted was definitely not the one that has made this place find a place in folklores. Too spicy to my liking and didnt like the taste either.They have two sets of price list (with n without tax).Kinda weird.The management instead of seating on the laurels of the past should try to revamp the place keeping the heritage in mind. Paratha, baked rotis, kosha mangsho and liver curry are their signature items. Pocketpinch ₹200/pax.

In a city where the time slows down, from the yellow taxis that run at a snail's pace to the happy go lucky people in the city, more concerned about art and literature, than running frantically in counting the highs and lows of the financial world; this place is a perfect mirror of that unpretentious passion filled culture. It warms up the heart of someone like me, whose own city is like a Ferris wheel that takes you down as fast as it takes you up, everyday. You come out of the metro station and you are left into a maze, like a mouse in the city; criss-crossing tramlines with traffic, hordes of every class to the street vendors that sell food right at your face.

I came across this small place and when I say small, its wide blue signage is larger than the space inside to sit. You enter through a 2 feet wide passage between the cash counter and the outdoor kitchen, and if someone is paying up, you wait till they finish as only one person can pass through at a time. In a room of 8 feet by 8 feet, you see people magnetically stuck to their 1 feet countertops lapping the warmest, the most gorgeous Kosha mangshos and mutton keemas. loud chattering bengali women to the sombre literary bengali babus; lovers feeding each other to mothers stuffing fish chops down their kids mouths, you see all of it in this miniature world.
We ordered fish chops, Mutton Kosha Mangsho and Mutton liver. While you chomp the gorgeous fish from the sweet waters, fried exquisitely, the rich dark cocoa brown gravy stares at your face. You see the oil floating around it and your snooty little metro city eyes squint at it but, your nose and all the other sense rebel to dive into it. A dip of those parathas into that rich caramel onion gravy and you are hooked! the lady behind the counter gives you a faint smile and from that day you are a convert. From a food snob you are a child in your mother's kitchen. The amuse bouche of the fancy restaurant lose all meaning and the rich oil no longer scares your mind distorted by health diets. 
I don't think I looked up for the next 10 minutes and in the end all the plates were wiped clean, each and every drop. The most amazing kosha that i have come across in my life so much so that after I came back to Delhi, all mutton koshas in all the pandaals depressed my soul for the want of that luscious rich caramel dark gravy available for Rs. 170 a plate!

Although you do not get the same flavour and taste as it used to be around 20 years back, its still one of the best. Parathas with mutton kosha, which is unusually black in colour is just awesome. The gravy is simply made of oil, and if you are a health freak then this place is absolutely not for you. A nostalgic taste which is very hot and super greasy. But still I love their food.

I have heard of this place for a long time. As I am from southern part of Kolkata, never use to visit Shymabazar regularly. Last week while coming back from a relative's house I just stopped by the Golbari to pick up some "Kosha Mangsho" & "Porotha". The place is very tiny and lacks of proper cleanliness. I have taken parcel. I am not sure about the quality of food as my first impression of the place is not quite appealing, but when I have tasted the food at my home, I understood why GOLBARI is rated so highly. The food is awesome and I had never tasted anything like this in my whole life. Now onward I  have to visit the northern Kolkata more often, just to pick up the items again and again.

Golbari's Kosha maangsho is undoubtedly the legacy of Kolkata. The meat is nicely cooked to make it tender and in a lot of oil and spices. Its not too healthy but its extremely delicious, which makes it impossible to think about health! The parantha here is below average and kind of spoils the combination. Best option is take away as the eatery is very small. Service is fair and the prices are not at par with quantity.

Golbari kasha mansho and paratha.......
A tradition
A delicacy
A hereditary
North KOLKATA is famous for many things. One of which is our famous golbari. 
The spicy mutton that has been cooked for hours with various spices brings out the real meaning of the word "kasha" in Bengali which literally means to be cooked with the juices spices and love over a long period of time. 
Although the main attraction is mutton kasha, the famous outlet also provides other moghlai dishes. 
A big no to its paratha which is just not fit for the money if you opt for a lot of paratha.

Pros
Situated at Shyambazar more, you cannot miss this place
Mutton kasha - the meat is tender,heavily spiced curry

Cons
The cost is bit over priced
Very little quantity provided
Very small area if you opt for a gathering there, prefer take always

Kosha mangsho is what i tried there and it was oily. very very unnecessarily  oily. The parathas were rubbery. The taste was okay. The hype about the place is more than it deserves. If it has to keep up its name, a lot of improvement is required. The mutton cutlet and dimer devil is worth mentioning.

Perhaps held its fame once. But that time is over. Mutton Kosha is good. Not excellent. Space is too cramped to sit. Dining in there would be a blunder. Won't recommend.

Tried golbari's kosha mangsho, and it's very nice taste, I will say, little less oil possibly make it little better, I believe rest of the cutlet items are good...we loved the taste of the kosha spice

Visited this place recently, please do not try Mutton Kasha at this restaurant because the space is too small, better order and enjoy at your home.

Now the food, the Mutton Kasha was good to taste but was too much oily. I don't like this types of food. And the paratha was too bad, too bad.

Oily atmosphere with food priced even higher than actual raw mutton of the same quantity..! Food tastes good . Could be better if prices are revised. Sitting on the mouth of a big crossing full of dust that also 750 up for a full plate . Good good only good only from mouth to mouth nothing impressive .

All they serve is the same old greasy oil dripping plates. And the restruent itself is a cramped up place. No decent place to sit. Its only running because of its old traditional taste which im pretty sure most of us will hate anyways.

The name of this place used to be something else but due to the shape of the building (round) it's name now is golbari 😊
I did not rate it with 5stars as the food is too spicy other than that, the food kosha mangsho or mutton is fabulous the taste is unforgettable!! We had also taken mutton kima and it wasn't that spicy. So, is suggested. They do not use dalda the quality is good and rich. 1visit at least is recommended!! Also, do not go during the pujas, the crowd is huge then.

No ..never.. never ever ....yes these words were in my head after having a meal from historic Golbari. Ambiance is zero , I am now requesting to zomato that please immediate start negative rating facility then I would be the first guy to hit that button for this place, This place isn't capable of even a single star, it is totally like a road side " vater dokan" type, foods are overpriced in terms of quality and quantity. I heard a lot about this place for their famous mutton kasha but when I tested I felt that I was eating oily rich burnt pieces of some tasteless things, pathetic taste. I will never ever enter again this place in my life.

My first visit at here was on 2008... And after that i have come here too many times... Just because of the gravy of mutton kasha... That is the best item of mutton i have ever had..another items like chicken masala,egg devil, fish fry... These items are good but not like the mutton kasha...so everyone who'll visit this place should try the mutton item.. If that person don't eat mutton then he or she should try the gravy at least.. And the extra added item is the chatni which they serve along with the salad...that is a twist... It tastes so good...

Famous for its kosha mangsho this place is undoubtedly Kolkata's heritage. Wanted to visit the place since years bt got the chance recently. With a foodie friend tried its famous kotha mutton and liver curry with the equally famous paratha. Many people had discouraged me earlier saying food is no more good here. But I found d food very tasty. Want to taste their devil and fish cutlet next time.

The combination of Mutton Kosha with Parathas are like the combination of Uttam Kumar and Tollywood. The chutney and the onions are just the icing on the cake. If you want to visit Kasmir then this place is for you. The taste of mutton will make you feel in paradise. 
On the other side I found that the parathas are slightly overpriced. Otherwise a legendary restaurant. :)

Well "Golbarir Kosha Mangsho" was full of oil only. But it has its unique taste and smell. I had the opportunity to taste their "Kosha Mangsho" and "Paratha" twice. Both the times I could feel the same taste and smell which is good. 
As it is one of the legendary food join in Kolkata I got half carried away by its name only. It is recommended to carry one 'Digene' if you are going for a meal on that place :)

I have visited this place few months ago when i visited Kolkata.
It has been quite some time i have been to this place (Almost 20-22 years).

The taste was unforgettable. Mutton was soft & juicy and would melt in mouth. The curry was not full of spices, rather the aroma of cooked mutton filled the curry/oil.

Coming to last visit few months back, 
We ordered a takeaway, Mutton Kosha, Roti and Onion (had to pay for it, mind it)

Coming to Quantity Vs Price:- I felt that serving should have been more considering place, offering overall. but then, 'premium' on legendary items  are applicable everywhere.

Taste:- This is more important to me.
That has changed. Though the dark color of the curry is maintained, mutton was neither soft nor juicy. It was rather hard.
and could taste whole lots of spice, specially chilli. There is still a distinct taste, i must admit, but the magic is gone.

I would still recommend to anyone who hasn't tasted this earlier to visit this place once. Its a small joint and there will be a waiting line in peak hours.

If you are down due to any reason, a visit here will ease off all the things, specially if you order their signature dish of Parota n Kasha Mangsho. May not having the same taste n flavour for which Golbari was famous n popular, still the smell and color of the dish will clean bowl you even before you taste. Truly an icon in its own field and still holding the crowd by its own capacity.

Honestly speaking I was very disappointed with their Quality of Mutton Preparation... Too much oily and pepperish Flavour with no tenderness of Mutton which degraded the Rating..... Though I liked their Paratha but for what it is famous for " Kosha Mangsho " is surely been a waste of money and hope.....!!!!!

I have dined here, my parents have dined here, my grandparents have also dined here and all of us share the same adulatory opinion of the illustrious Kosha Mangsho available here. Comprising of singed pieces of mutton in a thick and spicy gravy, the Kosha Mangsho is best had with the Parantha they serve, an authentic lethal combo. The Mutton Keema is another leading dish.

The restaurant pretty much hinges on these marquee dishes and budging from them is not recommended. I just wish they would use more pure oil like they used to instead of "dalda". The zero ambience, boxy seating arrangements and curt service do not bestow an agreeable dining experience, and a takeaway is the most viable option.

P.S. Be careful not to get intoxicated by the intense smell while passing by this place.

There is a popular story that one day Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was on his way to R.G. Kar Medical College & Hospital, but as he was passing the Shyambazar crossing on his horse, a delicious aroma of 'kosha mangsho' hit him. He turned to look and has been staring since as the famous statue at the Shyambazar 5-point crossing. The place he is straight staring at? Its none other than Golbari's!
The tradition and essence of the age-old quintessentially bengali 'kosha mangsho' is still ritualistically followed here. For the uninitiated, 'kosha mangsho' is a thick spicy meat stew that you can have with rice or rotis. Their 'kosha mangsho' is heavenly, albeit a bit on the spicier side. It goes really well with rotis or parathas. If you are living in Kolkata and haven't had a taste of this place yet - you will be denied your right to enter the Pearly Gates.
It is better to do a takeaway as the place is cramped and inevitably crowded. Among the other items on offer - the egg cutlet is good. Have not tried anything else.
People say that the quality has gone down nowadays and was better in yesteryears. (Everyone says that about everything. Apparently everthing was brilliant in the good old days than now!) But the taste is brilliant just the same. So don't rely on these stupid comments and go get yourself a space in Heaven!
Bon appetit!

Not a place where you would dine out. Not a place that you would like to miss either. So the best thing is to take away for a lip smacking dinner at home. Yes, this is the place that is so very famous for its kosha mangsho -- and the internet is full of recipes trying to mimic it -- and this is really heavenly. Have it with the thin parathas they make -- heaven on earth. Unless of course you have problems with oil and spice!

Golbari- the ultimate destination for mutton lovers as the legend says. M not much a mutton person myself but cud nt resist visiting this heritage restro owing to nice reviews and innumerable stories.
Ended there on a blistering Saturday noon. The place was totally packed up but thank God we didn't hv to wait much.Ordered THE MUTTON KOSHA and mutton keema along with parathas.  Food arrived within 2mins. Impressive. The parathas were very thin and light exactly how parathas should be. Mutton kosha tasted heavenly but had UNHEALTHY amount of oil in it.Same thing applicable for mutton keema too. On top of that keema was too spicy and I didn't like it much. However the gravy of keema and kosha were different in taste which is a thumbs up. Chopped onions served with the parathas goes well with the kosha. 

Next time however I would prefer a takeaway as its a very little place.

When one travels 10 km and comes back thinking mom's sunday mutton curry is so much better, then that makes up for a very disheartening food journey. The mutton curry was so dark that it looks like the onion was long dead being caramalized, and had a taste I forgot even while eating. The mutton pieces were not soft as well.

All in all, this place didn't floor me. Ideally, I should want to try this place again but that seems like a very big ordeal. If you are not from north calcutta with no nostalia attached to this place, and you are in north calcutta and you can pick it up, do it try it once or twice. I wouldn't suggest you go all the way to have just this.

This is one place where I don't mind just polishing off the gravy even if there's no mutton to bite in to. 

Probably one the tiniest restaurants you would be visiting and trying to squeeze some space out of, but definitely one of the tastiest Kosha Mutton curries around town that has been passed down through generations. Best enjoyed with hot porotas and the chutney with salad. However, urban legend says the taste and quality of mutton has deteriorated over the years.

Golbari Ksho Mangsho is a famus food destination for every Bengali of North Kolkata. The place is famous for its various preparations including mutton. We tried parathas and mutton kasa. Yes the taste was an average. It was served hot. But the mutton is too spicy so you will not be able to take much of it.

Somehow I feel this place has lost its charm. Golbari was known for its kosha mangsho. Honestly, they don't make it that awesome anymore. 90's golbari and today's golbari are not the same.

To understand the true calibre of this place one should have visited it in the early eighties to the late nineties.

Today it's a pale shadow of its former self.The ownership changed hands or something like that,it was shut down for a while but this probably is the one restaurant in Kolkata which has given birth to a new recipe for a popular dish......the omnipresent Kosha Mangsho,a perennial favourite of the Bengali palette.Golbari Kosha Mangsho is a item in itself,you. Can just google to find out.

What makes the Mutton dish special is the colour which is almost black and inspite of all kinds of theory like caramelised sugar and tea leaves the recipe still remains a secret.Also a slightly burnt smell gives a typical aroma to the meat which is irresistible.

What dampens your spirit is the bad quality of the meat and the amount of effort you have to put in to negotiate the same.They are hard,rubbery,bony.And I suspect the gravy also has changed colour ( pun intended) with time.The paratha is elastic as well.The chutney however remains good.

However a trip to Dakshineswar emails incomplete without a pilgrimage to the Golbari as well even if we just pack it.

When i was young then i have heard a lot about 'Golbarir Kosha Mansho' or you can say Golbari's chicken/ mutton curry.!! I went there 1 time with my friends and ordered kosha chicken and paratha.. Trust me the chicken was ok ( but not as good as i heard) but the paratha was worst. I have never found that type of worst partha anywhere.. So, that was my first and last visit there.

Golbari has apparently created such standards that it has got me visiting this place from far south,Tollygunge...but in reality THE MEAT THEY SERVE AS MUTTON IS ACTUALLY "PATHA" ...and "patha" is not what we call "mutton" or "khashi" ...it has got an entirely different disgusting smell..utterly dissapointed..I had to throw away  3 plates of mutton kasha i bought.never visiting this place again in life or recommending anyone.

It' very famous for their kasha mangsho, but we didn't get any specal extraordinary taste in their items.We visited two times.price is cheap and taste is average good.First time we took away the food (mutton kasha) & Second time we had lunch there; Paratha was oily...the taste is not up to the mark as I heard a lot about them & chicken chap.Ambience is nothing to say...u have to sit on a bench and eat on a common wooden desk...

One of the heritage food places of Kolkata..renowned for their 'kosha mangso' they have been serving for last 85yrs. The place is right at the junction of APC Bose road and Cornwallis street and can be found very easily. The place is almost always crowded and a suggestion to those who have never been here, try to reach before 9pm or u may miss the 'kosha mangso'
Now coming to their 'kosha mangso', its very tasty and a perfect definition of 'kosha mangso'..some may complaint that the mutton is too oily and spicy but i really dont mind..the roti they serve with it is a perfect combo. Besides kosha mangso, I tried the mutton liver kosha and mutton chop and they also taste very good. You can also try the fish fry. Its better to take a parcel as this place is clumsy and always crowded.

This is one of the authentic place for having some good yummy n full of calories foods.(jokes a part) but I love to eat this type of oily foods.very easy to locate it's in shyambazar.very famous joint from many years back.
========================================
Food ->>>>>

1. Paratha with chutney n salad - paratha always my fav n if it's too oily then also good.their paratha's big sizes n comes with 2 in a plate chutney was little spicy but tasty.

2. Mutton keema - this is lyk a signature dish.big parts of mutton too much oily but it's too much tasty.i was licking my fingers bco yummy enough too handle it.this is a must try dish.
========================================

Service - 3.5/5
Foods - 4/5
Ambience -3/5
Value for money -4/5

Everyone should try this joint for sure.otherwide you will miss something good.it's only for good food lovers.thumbs up for this place.

another legendary eatery just turning into just another okayish eatery.

the place is cramped,hot and is dire need of more fans and ventilation.

the eating arrangement is small,unique and not so comfortable for big guys.

the rotis are stiff,parathas much better.

the kasha mangso is soaked in oil and dalda and looks black in colour.

also it has it's own very spicy taste.the pieces are bit stiff.

unlike the home cooked kasha mangsho which is much less denser and is a bit lighter on spices,this mangsho is thick,oliy and speaks of mass production of the dish.

older members of family spoke highly of the place.but,the gold standard of kasha mangsho has definitely gone down.

or may be i had high expecations form this place.

p.s.- do not dare to eat in this place in summers or even in humid rainy season.a takeaway is always a far better option.also,try the egg devil,it is surprisingly good.

Heard so much about this place right from childhood but got a chance to be there some time back. Had the food inside. You expect the place to be not clean enough. But then I expected more from the mutton kosha and other dishes which I had heard of so much. May be we have so many options these days and there is hardly any dish which you have not tasted specially  in the Indian segment. The dishes tasted good but with lot of oil. It just managed to tick off one of the long pending items which i had to try.

Located near the five point crossing of Shyam Bazar, Golbari is among the legendary eateries of Kolkata. It is famous for its kosha Mangsho which is really good.But there is more oil than the gravy so quality wise I m not satisfied! Ambience is not good..sitting arrangement is very small..so I prefer the take away service. But once in a while u can grab a quick bite from here since its quite famous in Kolkata and the taste is finger licking.

Listed under Legendary Restaurants in Zomato, Golbari is situated near the Shyambajar crossing. We visited this place a few months back, having a heard great praises from a foodie friend. I half expected the place to be entirely gol, like a tube maybe, until I saw it. It was a normal building with a rounded corner. :/ 
The ambiance was very simple, and to my dismay, the place was extremely cramped.
Our order was simple, 4 Rotis and a plate of their famed Kosha Mangsho. Our order was quickly served with some Tentuler Chutney and onion slices. We were slightly disheartened as the food reached our tables, cause the mutton did not look appetizing at all. It was almost black in colour, and dripping with oil. However, our opinion was quickly changed as soon as we dug in. Beautifully charred pieces of meat in a mouth-watering, spicy-as-hell gravy! But, sadly, apart from the Kosha Mangsho, nothing else tasted good. The rotis were too hard and leathery, the chutney too sour, even the onion slices felt somewhat stale. 
As far as I remember, our bill came to Rs. 212 which for me was reasonable enough. The staff were too professional and curt. A little smile goes a long way.

Overhyped...seems that once upon a time , they used to serve "lip smacking Kosha mangsho" (their signature dish) . This austere food joint could be jundged, only based on two parameters : 
1. taste of food and 2. value for money ... Unfortunately, in both of the category, it scores on the lower side. I really do wonder, how come this eatry managed to score 3.5, in such a credible restro-search engine like,  Zomato...!!! I'm apprehensive about the fact that the Gourmets will be deceived, if they go by this rating.

That mutton kasa! It has a special place in the heartvof every vintage bengali foodie. Every time i visit shyambazar, i make it a point to buy a plate or two of that "kosha mangsho" .The quality of meat served is not upto the mark but the gravy is heavenly. Thats how a real bangali mutton kasa tastes like. Not a proper place to dine in though. I would recommend parcels.

When I fell in love with North Calcutta, it was through Sunil Gangopadhyay's novels, my college time 'premika' and Golbari !
It has hold onto the old world charm with no intention to expand the interior seating capacity or the no of branches. They have absolutely not wracked their business brains. But one thing they have done for certain. Holding on to the erstwhile appeal of the tender pieces of mutton soaked in patient kosha gravy, the accompanying chtney and the beautiful paratha.
Inspite of the numerous reincarnations across the modern sectors of the city and a few better ones at that, Golbari tastes still the same unique taste. Iys chutney is inimitable and the paratha is such simple. As simple as the walls you sit facing.

It does come under as one of the legendary eateries of Kolkata. It does boast about the best mutton kasha ever. It does reflect the quintessential taste of Bengal Foodies. But it let me down when it came to quality maintainence. The paratha and the Golbari Mutton Kasha didn't make me want to return again for a bite. The parathas are oily and thick. The mutton kasha is bound to oily , I agree, but it was too much oil and much less curry. The mutton pieces were too small. The ambience hasn't changed over last 40years or so and sitting in that small chamber with lots of people and just a fan and much hot, oily paratha and mutton, it did make me sweat like a pig and I didn;t like it. May be I would have appreciated the same over a home delivery/take away at the comforts of my home. Nonetheless, it is THE GOLBARI KASHA MANGSHO, taste is good but oily. but you won't regret it.

Though a favourite of locals this place failed to impress me. Probably because i am not a localitie as i couldn't relate my self with the heritage of the place . I had the usual Kosha Mangsho+ chicken liver curry with Porota. Food here is cheep and cooked in pure DALDA , a favourite of locals. As the food is made of DALDA , it is very very greasy and people seems to love it. Do not expect to dine in the eatery as it hardly has any place to stand because of lack of space and huge rush. It is located on the Panch Matha Mor which adds to its desi heritage and charm but has any little effect on its food. All in all it is a place to feel the charm and heritage of Kolkata and savour some local greasy DALDA made junk food

Golbari.....an institution by itself. Not unlike a lot of north and central Kolkata boys, I grew up frequenting this place. The mutton kassa, ruti, dimer devil, etc......wrote sonnets about them in my mind (thank God). Went there after many years. The kassa looked but did not taste the same and the ruti was oily! The Egg devil was cold. Service was superbly non existent and sitting arrangement was terrible as it was 15-20 years ago. But I did not expect any better when it came to service and seating. The food (the main and only attraction) sort of disappointed me. Not saying it was bad. Just that it wasn't at all as good as it was all those years ago. Anyone who remembers Golbari food 15-20 years ago will probably know what I am talking about. Right now in my opinion, the most appropriate phrase will be "naame kaate". Whatever it is, if in the area, and are a Golbari virgin, visiting this place is a must. If not for the taste of the food, go there because it is Golbari. A big part of the Kolkata's culinary history.

The food joint(as I would like to call it) is situated on the main road and can be easily identified.However,I was confused for a second since it said 'New Punjabi Hotel' above 'GOLBARI' of the sign board.When you enter through the small cash counter,you enter into another era.The place is rather small and neat.Don't expect anything fancy here.There are no table,just counters with chairs.I visited to have what its famous for 'Mutton Kasa' with paratha.You are served 5 pieces of mutton in one portion and loads of oil(not for the weak hearted).The food is delicious and the tamarind chutney along with the parathas and onions on the plate is finger licking.All in all an experience I was waiting for since a long time and I am throughly satisfied.

The combination of those unique parathas...  quarter plate mutton and that tangy tamarind chutney is just unparallel!! So what the sitting area is smaller than a bus cabin.. So what u would die of suffocation if u go there on a hot stuffy afternoon!! You would die a satisfied man...

Obviously the best mutton kosha and liver curry you can find in any parts of Kolkata. It mainly runs on take away. Seating arrangement is quite meager. But the taste is unparalleled. Mutton Kosha is just so tender and tasty and unique. It just melts in your mouth. Paratha is just awesomely soft.

Golbari! The famous restaurant of Mutton Kasha, which is very much different taste from other restaurants. The gravy looks like dark blackish and too much of rich in taste. If you regularly eat this, you should face some health problem. But with all this negative thing, the taste of the curry is too delicious. In this place who came here for food, the common order is Roti and Kosha Mansho (Mutton). Everybody knows that the gravy is too much heavy/rich, but still they eat this because of its taste. I love this and I wish I can go there in near future.

If you are in shyambazar and have some time, dont deprive your tongue from tasting two parathas,mutton kosha and that electrifying chatni. Mutton kosha , chicken kosha and mutton liver are my hot favourite. Spicey and mouthwatering. Only reason that restricts me from a full five is the seat capacity.

Heavily spicy,half cooked mutton that just broke my heart. I don't know what is the best time to visit this place,but I couldn't find any great taste in its kosha mangso.

Visited this place in July 2015 on a humid sunday afternoon,therefore it was not too crowded.Heard about this place a long time ago and about the mutton kosha it prepares but never had the chance to visit.But this time I went there with my friend,this place is very near to shyambazar metro station.The place is very small with a few chair and tables and very stuffy interiors so on a hot day it really takes its toll on you,but once the food arrives u will forget everything as the mutton kosha is bound to disappear in minutes with the paratha they serve with it..It has a blackish gravy with an oily residue and no need to say its lip smacking,its just a place to eat and nothing else.I felt like rating 3.5 at first due to the bad seating arrangements but the taste of the food made me rate 4.

Exceptions was huge when I ordered for Kasha Mangsho (Mutton) last Sunday as I have always heard about this special dish since I have started understanding the taste of Food. Till that day for some reasons I was not able to taste it. So last sunday when I reached Shyambazar , I told myself that I could not miss the opportunity anymore.So with great expectations I ordered it but what I got instead was a pitch black curry with a lot of oil and spices .Also the mutton pieces I received was full of bones and fleshy part was also so hard that I am still having trouble in my teeth. My wife also has clearly said " This is the first and last" for her. Sorry Golbari but could not help.

After a long time once again visited Golbari and satisfied my appetite for heavenly mutton. After tasting their trademark Kosha Mangsho with Porota, it felt that this place has not been affected by time. A lot of things have changed in and around Shyambazar area. But the taste, the uniqueness and the beauty of the mutton curry of Golbari have not changed. There is a saying that a wine gets better when its old, the same could be applied here as well.

Golbari's Kasha Mangsho a very famous dish you will hear from the mouth of every Calcuttan true to their city. When I had heard the account from my peers I had expected a mouth watering flavor but what I got instead was a ptch black curry with a lot of oil and spices and the flavor of the mutton heavily subdued as if sedated under it's taste. Definitely not recommended if you are a foodie like me enjoying subtle flavors of the curries and enjoying the individual components of the dish.

Located near the five point crossing in shyambazaar. Ambience is poor. I felt it to b congested. Price of food is cheap enough. Parathas r good to have. Well d main attraction which gives it a 4 pointer is kosha mangsho which is mouth licking and after having it you will ignore its ambience. A place where I would like 2 visit only for that kosha mangsho n paratha nd nthn else.

Now golbari, i had heard this name from the very age of 10 but never had a chance to visit as i donot have any sorts of relatives or associations with north kolkata but recently when i had gone to college street, i made up my mind to visit this place atleast once. 
Golbari is a very small eating place situated at the five point crossing of shyambazar and very near to the metro station. And let me tell u it really serves one of the best mangso kosha in kolkata. The mutton and chicken dishes are fairly priced and the quality of meat they serve is very good. Their style of cooking is very traditional unlike most other new age restaurants. The paratha served is very soft and they complete the dish with achar and onions. 
The devil and fish fry items are equally good. I have liked the devil more. But the mutton and chicken chops are average with no speciality at all.
The place is a very small one and so i would suggest a take away as eating here can be pretty difficult. 
Prices are cheap as per food standard and paratha charges a meagre only. On the whole a very pleasant and satisfying experience.

The food was served warm and instantly, the chicken was juicy and nice, had the look and feel of old kolkata, loved the parathas and the special mango chutney there, though the menu lacks variety, but everything on the menu was truly awesome.

Overall it was a delightful experience, will definitely stop by again whenever i have a chance to!

It's funny how rumours are spread. This shop has so much hype around it that people are forced to eat in it, just to have themselves get disappointed. 
Pros: 
Absolutely none! 
Cons: 
1. Contrary to popular belief and claims by the owners of the shop, kosha mangsho is not at all spicy. Yes it has so much oil in it that your entire family can apply it on their bodies and get themselves tanned. 
2. Porota: its a joke. It too is laden in oil and externally ornated by drops of oil. 
3. Quantity vs price: 4 small to medium pieces of mutton for 170 bucks? Please sir, where's the exit? 
Golbari has a heritage, given, but such a pathetic example of food and costs?

Had heard a lot about the porotta kosa mansho so went to try it. We went in the evening so the place was emptish. We ordered a plate of kosha mangsho and 2 parathas, with 2 chicken chops and one egg devil. The mutton is not for the weak of heart. Dripping with oil, very intense flavours, mutton was well cooked although not perfectly done. It was hard to taste it because of the oil. The chicken chop on the other hand was delicious. Served with salad and kashundi it was very satisfying. It was big enough to be a meal in itself. The egg devil was nothing great.

The seating area was small but service was prompt.

Overall, the food was disappointing but will be visiting it again for the chop.

Since childhood I heard this name from my parents n they said golbari offers the best mutton kasha.. today while returning home from Kolkata station I decided to try its food. Its a small food joint. Ordered mutton kasha n parotha as suggested by the person taking order. It costs 199 rs including container n foil charge. I was very excited to taste the mutton kasha. But all my excitement went off wen I took the frst piece. its bitter n very oily. The bitterness s probably because the gravy got burnt while cooking.  There were 4 small pieces of mutton n taste yukkk .. total disappointment.  I wish I could give a big zero bt zomato doesn't offer so .

Small little place in Shyambazar crossing, but famous for the delicious non-veg food, Golbari appeared as a pleasant surprise. Had to wait an hour before we got in, and place was congested as hell, but you don't come here for ambiance, but for the tasty food. Ordered mutton keema and naan. The naans were big sized, and the keema the best I tasted till date.

Today While returning from dakhineswar my mom expressed her sudden urge to have kosha mangsho from the reknowned golbari. So my dad got the following items:-

1. Fish Fry= Large in size with ample amount of stuffing with the use of fresh bhetki fillet & the content of pepper gave a tinge of spicy taste which made it awesome giving you the idea of proper authentic bengaliana food

2. Chicken Cutlet= Also large & thick in size with balanced proportion of vegetable paste & chicken fillet living up to it's taste.

3. Mutton Kosha= The "Oh-so-famous" mutton kosha failed to live up to it's reputation only because it was saltless. The spices were absolutely spot on & the mutton was cooked to perfection but the main binding ingredient was missing leading to a big disappointment.

Overall Verdict= The side snacks should be tried whereas the makers of the mutton need to be more cautious or else golbari would lose it's reputation for mutton kosha very rapidly.

How can you start describing this joint? Its been around ages like forever and still hasn't lost its charm and name. But according to the dishes they serve these days, their reputation don't match up and certainly not eligible to fit into that 'Taste of Bengal' Collection. The interior is an immediate let down. No AC. Very less spacious. We tried their legendary mutton kasha and also chicken masala. Both were wayyyy tooooo oily. The mutton pieces were no where near succulent. All the dishes were really very oily, on the average side and had nothing special to mention about. The paranthas were not that well cooked also. Had a disappointing experience!

Everybody is like, "Golbari? You'll get the best Kasha Mangsho there".
But honestly, I would like to differ.
The taste has dropped considerably.
You put the food in your mouth, and all you'll taste is onions, a tinge of salt, and chillies, lots and lots of chillies.
I agree, it was an enigma once, but that is long lost guys. Alas!

Today Kosha Mangsho and Golbari have become almost synonymous. We have heard about them from our parents and still a lot of people start drooling when they hear these two names.Bengalis love their “motton” (Mutton / goat meat) and they love their hot, spicy and greasy gravies. If you are weak at heart, I suggest, simply stay away from this pleasure.
                                                                ...

Porotha with Kosha Mangsho is something every Bengali foodie ( sorry if I am being ethnocentric) can die for and this will live up to your expectations if you are not a snob or taking a tacky and snobbish class conscious person along with you.
Rs. 500 for 2 people

To be very frank i am very cynical when it comes to food and I generally always appreciate a well balance food both health as well as taste  wise. Our visit to golbari was planned one as we wanted to explore what exactly does this north kolkata joint has which has made its way to almost everyones heart....

Location ..its near to shyam bazar five point crossing .the place is called golbari and tradition states that tagore used to order hiis food from herr 

Food :  we ordered a plate of chicken and mutton and never knew till that time that a dish could have such quantity of oil in it. The oil was literally floating all over our plate .i personally didnt like the apperance .the taste was okay nothing special to die for .... I guess this place is running only beacuse of hype ..

Overall not a very tastefull experience .....i seriously devdloped a phobia towards super oily food after my trip to golbari .


Not happening henceforth .....

Well this place has been there , then not been there and now is there. To say the least it is not the same as it used to be. To dramatize it -it has been at its  peak of forms and is now dwindling , cashing in on the once famous -"THE GOLBARI" tag. The mutton kasa and the mutton keema , perhaps the only two items in its rather small menu that has been a crowd puller for years now. Though nowadays the quality has detoriated. If you are one of the lucky ones to have had tasted their dishes some 8-10 years back , you would know the difference. Nonetheless a heritage in the Kolkata food circle. If you haven't tried it , please give it a try else you shall miss out on a significant share of the food history of Kolkata.

Well, Golbaari- isn't the name enough to give us foodgasm? Rightly so! See if you visit Golbaari, go there for the spread and not for the ambience; but again, it has the charm of old Calcutta filling it. Their KAWSHA MANGSHO has to be tasted and savoured, no adjective is sufficient to gauge its taste. Go for their paranthas also, very soft and juicy. Price is cheap and that's a bonus!

Another 'must go' joint if you are visiting Kolkata, which I was. 

Don't be scandalised by the ambience or location. Just ignore and immerse your expectant taste buds into the thick rich dark aromatic gravy of Kosa Mangshu with a thick heavy parontha, and you are definitely on to a culinary equivalent of nirvana!

I guess it will be difficult to find the exact taste elsewhere. Tried finding it in a Bong restaurant in Mumbai and was sorely disappointed. 

The portion size, like all foodstuff I found in Kolkata, is more than sufficient for a single person!

Anyway, visit Kolkata and keep Golbari earmarked in your itinerary.

The famous golbari known for its 'traditional' kosha mangsho(mutton kasha) is situated in the heart of shyambazar. Talking about the hygiene, well.. There's a doubt .. But if you are a foodie whose only concern is taste , this is the place you must visit. The chicken n mutton chops are average but the mutton curry and parathas will steal your heart.

I should start with the disclaimer that I am a die hard fan of this place!The rating is for the kosha mangsho only as there is nothing else to talk about. Really!! If you did not have this delectable delicacy from here you will never know what 'kosha mangsho' is. Take it away if you find the seating area too small , its only for those who just cant wait to dig in. And while you are at it  order the liver as well. It is not for the uninitiated though. The gravy is the same for the 'kosha mangsho' and the liver. The almost black thick gravy packed with the concentrated mutton flavour.

It is a very old establishment and is an institution in its own right. It is completely no frills for the serious foodie. Its just a small shop at the corner selling 'kosha mangsho' and parota like no other  and has never thought of doing anything else. 
My visit to Kolkata is incomplete without a pilgrimage to Golbari.

To me, golbari is one of d most overhyped places I ve ever visited.. Long before coming to Kolkata I knew this name... In many Bengali books and newspapers.. But I was totally disappointed when I visited the place... It z near shyam bazar 5point crossing... The place z very small... Entrance is very narrow... The room inside is dark and so hot... I had parathas with mutton kosha.. Paratha was very oily... Mutton was too spicy.. I was fortunate not to have any indigestion afterwards... The only plus point is that the food is cheap...

I happened to take away mutton kosha after the renovation and it tasted very nice minus the loose motion.

Basic in ambience.
Must visit for its kosha mutton.

Golbari stands on Shyambazaar crossing ( 5 head crossing or paanch matha'r more in Bengali) . It is indeed a name that is tantamount to the place that prepares the BEST kosha mangsho (curried spicy mutton) , a quintessential bengali favorite, PERIOD.... the succulent and blackened exceptionally tender mutton pieces would just melt in your mouth... AMAZING to say the least !!!

The negative:

The mutton they server with parathas ,which I personally dislike a lot , is pretty much the only bread option they have. It would have been far far better to have the mutton with rumali roti instead. Had they served with Bengali triangular paratha the experience could have been acceptable.

No ambience , a shanty joint , no idea why they don't consider an upgrade...

The servers are the worst...

Full marks to the best kosha mangsho in the city, but the rest of all disappointed me... But well I would be back again , just for the mutton.

Happy dining :)

located near the shyambazar 5 point crossing d famous GOLBARI serves d best kosha mangsho (mutton kasha ) in kolkata. this authentic place is synonymous to kosha mangho and paratha to any bengali food lover. i love dis place coz it revives d aura of typical north calcutta restaurant which now a days r hard to find. it is a vry small place with a sitting arrangement fr almost 10 people and d restaurant is non ac. so it is always advisable to pack ur food. apart frm their famous kasha mangsho, i like d mutton liver kasha and egg devil ( which is a constant  sold out out item most of the time due to its high demand ). overall this place is one of my fav eatery in kolkata and one of the reason why i  never want to live my city. d only con I must with grief notify is that the place  lacks  cleanliness n hygiene. They should  desperately aim for that or else they would fail to hit d chords of  youth.

The Golbari is famous for their kosha mangsho and boy do they have the reason to be famous. Their kosha mangsho is just brilliant. It is situated near the shyambazar five point crossing. The place is alway packed and it is a very old shop hence no ac. So it is always better to pack food from their rather than eating there. It is very cheap also a plate of kosha mangsho cost about 150 bucks or so.

Went there on one of my birthdays. Heard a lot about this place. But to tell the truth, it was overhyped as hell. The ambience was very bad and the place is too small in peak hours. The price was also high considering the quality and taste and quantity. We had paranthas and mutton kasha. The size of the mutton was small. The paranthas were very oily and the kasha was very spicy.

Ah the famous golbari every body told me try this one and try I did.  I mean it's a good thing they ask for advance payment because I doubt I would have paid afterwards.  The legendary mutton kasa was hard and chewy and the rotis were like made of rubber . No doubt it was all empty  . The only thing ok was the amount of spices in it and that's just it.  Would only recommend it to try at your own risk. Still giving the rating because of its heritage value.

Talk about Kosha Mangsho and what came to my mind was Golbari. Well not anymore. Wonder how its still so popular. Oh wait, thats just the name. Undercooked meat, artifial flavours and overcooked burnt curry is what they serve you. Am sorry but I mean food when I talk of a restaurant. Not its heritage and history :3Trust me Bangali Kosha Mangsho is so much more than this. Never go to Golbari if you want to taste Bangali khabar. You'll totally get the wrong impression.

Heard a lot about this place and hence gave it a try during the pujas. Ordered the famous "Mutton Kassa" and Paratha. I was very disappointed as the meat was under cooked and the parathas were more like rotis. Not sure if it was due to the puja rush or not but ill think twice to visit this place again.

One of the best kosha mangsho I have ever had....a distinct bengali mutton flavour. The portion is decent and justifies the price. To give a better experience they need to take care that the parathas should land directly from tawa to plate. Often the parathas are lukewarm and being maida paratha they become difficult to eat if not hot.

For the bengali ,by the bengali and of the bengali.Golbari serves the most favourite bengali dish Kosha Mangsho(Mutton Curry) in its tastiest avtaar and this is the dish you will smell in every bengali home on Sundays and a must in bengali marriages.I being a bengali would be commiting a crime by not visiting this restaurant ,so one fine afternoon visited it .Located on Shyambazar crossing it was very easy to locate.On entering it appeared to be very small and cramped with chairs on which you could barely sit and finish your meal and scoot.
    We ordered the kosha mangsho and parathas .They served 5 pieces of mutton alongwith loads of sliced red onion and wafer thin parathas.The mutton was out of the world the best kosha mangsho i had till date, it was rich ,perfectly spiced with the correct hotness and soft .The soft parathas complimented the mutton like a match made in heaven.The pricing 155 a plate is great and i will be visiting this joint soon but will get my food packed this time.

The name of Golbari itself speaks of heritage, age old culture and somewhat a lost tradition of north kolkata, it speaks of bygone times, and more aptly the famous kosha mangsho also seems to be a reminiscent of the past..The quality and taste has deteriorated and it is surviving mainly based on its past reputation, the flavours no where near to what it used to be..Now coming to food:
Kosha Mangsho: You might feel intoxicated by the smell of the dish but once you taste it, you will feel the pieces to be a bit rubbery, difficult to chew, also way to oily even to the liking of a big foodie and too much fat which I personally don't like much..
Chapati: This is actually nice,something you won't get everywhere, blends well with the kasha..
Mutton Keema: Interestingly this not so popular dish actually tastes good and can be given a try if you are here..
Mutton Chop also taste good but nothing great compared to its more acclaimed counterparts in the locality..

The Kosha-mangsho !
This place serves the red meat like no other place,with extra greasy laccha parathas and an onion salad. You will want more and more,the meat is addictive.
But the place is too small to even move.
People who are fat,like me,will definitely feel weird in this place.

Food is great. Ambience and atmosphere are not that good. So if you can only concentrate on the food and not on what's going on at the next table then it is fine. It is at the Shyambazar crossing so do not expect a quiet and serene atmosphere. Anyways, worth trying if you are in Kolkata and craving for old school mutton gravy.

Was quite disappointed after all the hype. 
Nevertheless kosha mangsho quite lived up to it's name. But still something was missing. Parathas were simply sad. Cold, greasy, thin and rubbery. 
And space constraint is a problem.

The board on the shop says, Golbarir Kosha Mangsho...and thats what you get here, and in absolute, A grade. Not for the ones who have issues with oil and meat and the figure conscious crowd, this place is for the meat lovers, and the ones who want it in all its spices. Yes, its damn oily too.
But then, it tastes absolutely heavenly. Must try for the meat lovers for sure.
So, why not a 5/5 rating, well....1 more pc of mutton and 5 rs per porota...thats my 5/5 standard.
Am going here again next time too, no doubts. also, they have a takeaway counter too. Go ahead, and please yourself.

This is a must visit place if you love to have mutton.
This place is known for Kosha Mangso (mutton thick oily gravy). The kosha mangso just tastes out of the world and you will never get this taste anywhere in the world.You just can't stop having mutton here.
I can get the smell of mutton kosha while writing the review.
Must visit place only turn down will be the ambiance rather no existence of it however u will forget it once yoy start having your food.

Awesome tasty food, not for health conscious faint hearted, oily, rich with masala.

Nowadays, they use more fat instead of oil, which makes it little less appetizing, but still it's too mouth watering.

Don't expect a classy ambience though. For foodies, not for restaurant lovers.

By chance if your nose finds the smell of kosha in north Kolkata, then you are surely nearby Golbari. That plate of mutton in dark color fills the tummy in a flavouristic way unmatched at any other point. The ambience is upgraded but still a lot more to go in decor, ambience and behavior of staffs. The cost does not drop a bomb in any pocket, only the shabbiness. I had multiple visits over the years and never i was disappointed with that special plate of mine.

This place once had the tastiest Kasha Mangsha in the world! It's aroma wafted in the air and you could smell it standing at a bus stand nearby. Of late something has happened and the taste has gone altogether. On enquiry the reply was that the kitchen has been shifted. But why the taste ? Sadly it is all gone. The overwhelming aroma the hot taste of black pepper all gone.

We had the staple mutton kosha with paratha. Great taste, definitely lives up to their name.

p.s. The only drawback is the sitting area. Too congested. Though it was not to be a fine-dining experience. :)

Golbarir Kosha Mangsho is something you have to try to understand. It's located at the Shyambazar 5 point crossing and is one of the most famous joints in the area.

The deliciousness of the food items is beyond ordinary and is one of its kind. Golbari is not meant for health concious people cause the food is without a doubt awsome but is oily most of the times.

The place itself might look untidy or unhygienic but I don't care for what they server, is what I go there for. It's the authentic Bengali preparation served the exact way I like it. The prices are very reasonable and one can expect to spend around 300-500 for 2 to 3 people.

Though this place has always played a very important role on a ' North Kolkata Food Expedition'. It has been unable to uphold its flavour and tradition.

The Legendary Kosha Mangsho is such a let down. It has the potential to burn your stomach. All the food boasts is oil and oil.

The quality of meat is good but the preparation destroys. it.

This place is legendary as much as it's Mutton Kasha. The average roti don't know how it becomes superb with those oily melting mutton pieces. And that pickle adds to the legacy!

One of the legendary restaurant in Kolkata known for its mutton delicacy.  Normally I visit this place if I come to North Kolkata or Shyambazar. The place is quite overcrowded and you will enter into a hot-chamber where very little hygiene is maintained. The price is quite high in compare to North Kolkata's other places. However, every little negatives will turn into positives when you dip your roti into that oily black substances. The mutton is really legendary and will melt into your mouth. A little spicy though. The supplement tamarind chutney is delicious and will be a perfect companion with the mutton. 
Overall, visit this place if you love to sit into an old Calcuttan restaurant and taste mutton Kasha with some roti.

What's Shyambazaar without Golbaari? Cricket without Sachin probably. The 'Kosha Mangsho' is always on the "things to do list", along with the Paratha. , Dim'er Chop is also a great pick. But it is agreeable that over the years there has been a steady dip in the quality. You might come down with expectations and return with sweaty suffocating nostalgia with a good taste nevertheless. Mutton is Mangsho here!

Take away the following factors from the Golbari's famous kosha mangsho and what is left behind is heavenly!!!
1. the claustrophobic place.
2.the exaggerated prices.
3.the oil
4.delete the term 'hygiene' from your dictionary

now dip the paratha in that dark gravy and the rest is just pure bliss!  The mutton was indeed so soft that it literally melted in my mouth and the taste was heavenly! Not to forget that innocuous tamarind chutney which adds that extra tinge of flavour that will make your experience at Golbari a memorable one.

If you are searching for an exquisite and authentic eating place in North Kolkata, Golbari is the place. Located at the Five Street Crossing (Paanch Mathar More) in Shyambazar, their Porota (Paratha) and Kosha Mangsho (Mutton Curry preferably) is the showstopper. A plate of this costs about Rs.180. However, you can take the Paratha and Kosha Mangsho separately. Several other meat preparations (Chicken Kosha, Mutton Keema etc.) are also served with thin fried Parathas. They also serve Cutlets and Egg Devils (a whole of an Egg, fried in Besan) and some more snacks. One thing, the sitting arrangement and the restaurant itself is way too insufficient, although that tells the true story of such old fashioned restaurants in this part of the City.

Cyclone Aila made landfall on that eventfull day in 2009. I received a distress call and rushed out of my office at noon to help a friend touch down from an involuntary albeit brief flight.

Together we fought against unsurmountable obstacles like flying dustbins, berserk cows and live electric wires to make it upto Shyambazar. Constant drizzle, flooded roads and people ready to slit the throats of one next to them just for a ride back home made it a scene straight from some post-apocalyptic disaster movie.

Convinced that our end is near, we decided to die with honour and without regrets. Armed with a takeaway parcel of Mutton Kasha & Mutton Keema from Golbari, my friend survived the ordeal. Upon reaching home at 2 AM, two empty containers remained to tell the heroic tale.

Over the years spicy dishes have became immensely greasy. A plate of fiery Mutton Kasha has morphed into tough, rubbery pieces of mutton in a pool of oil; large enough to deep-fry a few cutlets. Slowly, but inevitably bones have started masqerading as pieces and getting 2-3 in a plate became routine. Gradually the sad excuse of mutton became too much to handle and I shifted my allegience into Mutton Keema. Unfortunately, quite a few times it has turned out to be ballon-like fatty annoyence.

Didn't quite realise it but food has really gone downhill over the years. Apart from food there's not much to talk about. Service is prompt but a constant urge to get you out of the door is in the air. Couple it with sneaky waiters overcharging you by giving themselves a 'baksish'. So, double check change given by overeager waiters.

Golbari is all about aroma. Just like Ulysses tied himself to the mast of his ship to get past sultry sirens, I have fought numerous battles with myself whilst stopping at Shyambazar signal. No mortal can avoid the gastronomic pull of the aroma near the exhaust fan of Golbari, slowly leading towards gastric doom.

I hate to admit this. After numerous visits part of me wants to stop. Whether Golbari with it's hazardously spicy dishes are still legendary is a big question. Legends are able to reinvent themselves over time. With it's wooden benches and paraphernalia Golbari is stuck in the '50s. Whilst I can live with that, hygiene standards from '50s do little to inspire confidence.

Having said that, the day I conquer myself, Kolkata will surely become London!

Two pieces of parantha with onions and kosha mangsho (mutton) come for 201 rupees and its chicken counterpart costs 146 rupees. The kosha mangsho ( mutton) is awesome to taste and is capable of converting chicken lovers! ;) The space inside is very stuffy and cramped but always overcrowded and teeming with loyalists . They also sell chops and cutlets . The mutton chop is made with mutton keema and served with mustard sauce which in bengali terms is made with 'khaanti sorshe' that is quite hot. The chairs remind one of junior school , and are tiny and fun ! Overall a legendary place one should try out at least once!

fantabulous.......and in bengali fatafati....if u want to go out from usual sandwich or burger KFC trend and LIKE yesterday's retro for a change then its a nice joint for you. Joint because accomodation scarcity. Its too small and hardly can arrange 10 ppl so if u r thinking for a hefty celebration this place is not good. Now about food.....superb! Parota and mutton chap is famous aroumd calcutta and has a long heritage of making dishes in great manner. Usually people like to take parcel from here. And at last don't judge it by its size of accomodation judge it by service quality and some awesomest food.

Roti and mutton curry. Best in the world. Only drawback, number of seats are too less.  Still,take a parcel and carry home.  Golbari serves mutton at its tastiest form.

Golbari...

Though the building isnt of round shape, the eatery is called Golbari... Almost synonymous to Mutton Kassa and parantha.

Its a pure Goaaal... !!!
Awesome n wholesome is what defines Golbari. Mutton Kassa and Roti. The roti is actually a lightly fried parantha.. Superbly thin and a perfect compliment to the Oilly Mutton Kassa. A plate of Mutton Kassa costs Rs 160. And may serve upto 2 persons.

Taste-4/5
Quality- 4/5
Value for money- 4/5.

Do away with hygiene n try once. Its a strict takeaway counter and dining inside is a strict no no.
Enjoy your meal at home.. !!

Let me put it very first- if some extra oil gives you nightmare or 'spicing it up' is just not your thing, stop reading this review right now. This is not a place you'd like to try. 

Food- As many others have already said, a review on Golbari is incomplete without mentioning their mutton kosha. Little heaven in a plate for you. I personally like to have it with rumali roti, though most of the people suggest parantha. 

Service- Pretty good I must say- clearly reflects the good side of having so many years of experience.

Ambiance- But the ambiance of this place is exact opposite to what they offer. If you're planning for a hangout mainly, you might want to go somewhere else. 

Location- This place is very easy to locate. Go to Shyambazar 5-point crossing and ask anyone. If that doesn't work(chances are almost zero), look around for a circular building and that's your heaven waiting for you.

It's a peculiar resturant. There are so many drawback of this place. Very very congested and crowded . You may have to wait for a long time just to enter. And gravy of the chicken. Those who are on diet may have a faint on seeing it.
 
But I just love this place. Just order kosha mangsho and roti , and you wont forget this place????

Been here once and as said by others the only food item you will like the most is the Mutton Curry or Kosha Mangsho. Apart from this nothing else is special. Ambience is normal and you will find comfort far away as people come here to eat and not relax. The mutton gravy is deep fried and was really spicy. Enjoyable but not the most healthy of dishes.

Heard and read a lot about the place. The place is suppose to be very old and it lives upto it. The ambience is normal and if you are a hygiene freak than you wont be too happy about the place. But foodies like me, its a must try, specially their mutton kasa and I guess its the only thing you should try. Don't even think about trying their fish fry, it was cold and not eatable. But the place is famous for their lip smacking mutton kasa and that is a thumbs up.

Another well famous place that we went to only because of its name.."golbarir kasha mangsho" is so famous that you are not a kolkatan if you haven't tasted it! In order to keep up with the Kolkatan spirit, we went to this place and ordered paratha and kasha mangsho.. the price was quite high,still that failed to dampen our enthusiasm (we need to pay before we can eat) ,service was quick but what was served is definitely not what the kolkatans boast of. The black oily gravy with 4 small pieces of mutton for 155 is way too much not to mention the oily ordinary parathas.. sitting arrangement is also bad. A single slab fixed on the wall with chairs in front of it is all that it can offer. It must have been a good place to eat but as of now, I find no reason to go to this place

Went to Golbari couple of weeks ago from college with friends to try it's well known 'Kosha Manghso'. They serves mutton with plain paratha. The mutton was tasty, but it was so oily. And the price was a bit expensive, ₹160 bucks for four pieces of mutton!

Though the place is very dirty to sit there n eat. But u can easily parcel it, come home n enjoy your food. Cuz the golbari's mutton is nt only very famous bt also vry tasty!!! U cn team it up with some rumali roti or porota. The mutton looks very dark n black but "surat pe maat jana".. Its worth it!! :) 
Must try :)

Well one's reputed for the Kasha Mangsho and Paratha, has now become very very out of...am not getting the word.
Anyway, not tough to locate as it's on the 5 point crossing of Shyambazar, thr heart of North Kolkata, this reputed place can be easily located. 

Very small and congested, this place has nothing of an atmosphere or ambience as we say, in a good restaurant or something. Old and dirty to enter the small room. It gives a typical North Kolkata feeling alright but let's you down.
Just the food. So we ordered the usual. Kasha Mangsho and Paratha. They served quite fast to be honest but the meat was really black completely to look at and it put me off from the very beginning and the paratha's, well, not properly fried or whatever we say, is completely a let down. They serves two pieces of meat with gravy and two paratha's. The meat was too spicey and not even served hot, same for the paratha's. They charge over 100 for this and i have no problem in calling this " Shit "
Utterly Shitty.

Going by the reputation, it has gone down badly and i really wonder how is it possible to be so bad from what it once was.


I personally, will never ever go there and advice the same.

This is very old shop and inspire of my love for mutton and this being one of its kind I never had the opportunity to savour this delicacy at its origin itself(have taken away many a times before),untill a very hungry summer afternoon.I should warn you that the place where the mutton is cooking and where you are eating is hardly 3 to 4 ft distance.So,not only will the mutton be absolutely out of the wok but you can very well expect a few drops of your sweat falling into it while eating.Inspite of all the heat and usual waiting for a seat....when you get this heavenly bowl of almost caramelised to black mutton in an obscenely thick gravy with soft parathas,the heat, the people and every other distraction is gone and and you gorge in....I think that is what makes food good to great....to me its something every Bengali should be proud of....

I count myself among the fortunate ones to relish Golbari'r Mangsho with Rumali Roti. A heads up for all the diet freaks, this is a No-Go zone as the Spiciness and the Oiliness of the Mangsho might give u a heart-attack. To all the others , ignore the caution and pounce on the delight. The price is also reasonable.  One cannot claim to be a Proper Calcuttan if they haven't try out their Speciality.

One of the sacred destination for mutton lover specially kasha mangsho lover.Its symbolizes the authenticity of North kolkata whatever is left there.Ambiance:The fact is nobody gives a damn about ambiance when it comes to Golbari,
It is one of the smallest restaurant you will see and in evening its always crowded.Food-The main attraction is paratha and kasha mangsho with the famous tamarind pickle.You can't forget the taste if you have eaten 
once in this place.You can also have Liver fry and Chicken Kasha.
This is the one restaurant where I have visited every year since I started eating here.In this modern era with all the AC restaurant with nice ambiance,well mannered waiter with excellent service,
you still have to wait 40 to 45 minutes to get a seat in Golbari in festive season.If you visit Kolkata or lives in Kolkata then please visit this place,it offers something unique.

This is one of the legends of food world of Kolkata, rather Calcutta. It has a long history of serving kosha mangsho ( mutton curry with dense gravy ) and paratha. Located at the five point crossing of shyambajar, it's always crowded. The sitting arrangement is not  so spacious and its a non ac restaurant, so it's better to opt for take home. Now the food, I have had the kosha mangho twice and mutton keema once. The kosha mangsho is better, though I felt that the meat was a little undercooked. The gravy is extremely spicy and awesome in taste. If you are a lover of Indian non veg, this is a must visit for you.

Kosha mangsho? Porota? So this is the place for you. You don't have to pay much over here. You just need to be a little patient. And you need to adjust in a small chair. And then you will place the order. Wait for 1.30mins.  Yes they serve quicker than Maggi. And then mutton with his friends in front of you. And if at that point of time you can say something negative about golbari. You are not a foodie. Go, rush! I just had my tummy filled up. Do justice to your appetite and pocket at the same point of time. :)

Situated in the heart of central kolkata, this place is a heritage....the place is very old! People go to this place for mutton khosa and paratha! This is the best for mutton...but the place hasnt changed a bot in about 50 years. The sitting arrangement is also limitted and its very hot inside. During the pujo its quite a problem...people have to line up and waiting time is almost 1hours...otherwise its a nice place and give value of money!

Known traditionally for it's Mutton Kosha, which may be rich, but is like no other restaurant in Kolkata. The spicy and oily preparation may not be on the ideal diet chart, but is as good as they come. The seating is a bit cramped up, with no AC. I wouldn't suggest Golbari for a dine-in, but is the ideal takeaway joint.

situated at the shyambazar 5 point crossing..this is one place with the old north kolkata charm..well the fame still exists but no doubt quality has bn compromised..
vising this place for last 5-6 yrs..only one word describes it..kosha mangsho..though other equally good items like mutton keema, chicken kosha n cutlets do exist, mutton kosha IS their signature dish..
rich and oily, yet very tender and tasty pieces of meat describes their dishes..served with a hybrid of roti n paratha, salad and an amazing chutney..this is the age old golbari for foodies..

Was a favorite for me since I first visited this place 10 years back this place is legendary for their kosha mangsho but recently the prices have gone up and the quality gone down. Don't know why but the Golbari Kosha mangsho now just doesnt taste the same as it was a few years back. Its become less spicey and less tasty. Hope they get back to the old recipe and bring back the old kosha mangsho taste that they were known for..

Kasha mangsho!! Yes. This place famous for this name and interestingly the name is associated with this shop " golbari ra bikhyat mangso dokan". Visited in this place during an afternoon. Shop premise is very small and even the chairs to sit are too of same type. 2 Parota , onion salad, chutney and 4pc kasha mangso... Rs.174. Its worthy to visit this place because of the typical bengali preparations. This is very old and famous shop.

Location and Description: Its just at the Shyambazar crossing.. very old and renowned place for its delicious tasty and awesome mutton kasa .The Mutton dishes are just so wow its just finger licking good.. People from far comes here to taste the dishes here...

Ambience and Staff : Place is very short. sometime, most of the  times u have to wait outside to have a seat. 

Food: Any mutton lover should have a try here. The mutton kasa is just fabulous and taste really superb. The dark coloured mutton and gravy will make you lick your fingers. The oil on the mutton can be seen from above and the smell is just fantastic.

QNQ & Prices: Quality has been very good here. Quantity is a bit factor. Prices are very affordable according to the tasty mutton they provide.

Disadvantages: Most of the time you will find this place shut for days.

Conclusion: Prices are reasonable but according to the dishes is ok. I hope you won't get dissatisfied.

Note: The review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

Yesterday went to shyambazar for some work, after finishing the work me and my friend is quite hungry but unfortunately we had very short time to eat so we decide to go to golbari but our bad luck follows with us when we were there we had a call that cut our time for eat. So we decide to take cutlets as a takeaway. And as decided we ordered Chicken & Mutton Cutlet, and they deliver the product within 6-7min. 
After quite a long time being with an old friend and eating Golbari's food bring back some nostalgic memories to us.
And the cutlet was........ Just ummmm.........

The place where bangaliana still exist....known for the peoples favourite ruti and kosha mangsho yes a shop that started around the british period serves ruti and kosha mangsho(read mutton) still now nany who works go around for works stops by here to eat this particular among them myself was no different. The smell of the meat just reaches you once you come near Golbari.. me and my family often visted here while marketing for pujas and sometimes used to take home directly for lunch sometimes.. dinner too. Heard a lot about this eatery from my dad who also ate there even before i was present in their life ..
the food is awesome as we bongs love kosa mangsho at any given time though this kosha mangsho is the best till date i have eaten and the quality of roti and mutton kosha didn't dissapoint me at all On a secnd note: the chicken kosha will not be a handfull for those who don't like mutton i would advise that not to go for chicken kosha if not mutton kosha fan  the other item also there like egg devil fish fry chicken cutlet veg chop etc ...
located at the 5 point street junction of shyambazar and toward the hatibagan crossing this shop is not a worth missing for meat lovers 

the price though in the recent times have be upgraded and the long wait for eating and home delivery get to your nerve ..

though not the same golbari of shyambazar 5-pt x-ing as it used to b right from angrezi zamaana after the change of its ownership bt the smell of mutton kasa, kima, cutlet, devil are still alluring..another legendary kolkata heritage..must try mutton kasa with parathas n cutlet

I heard so much....

I hoped thus too much..


..
I became confused....
I totally got fooled....
..
Chicken not coocked(may be that's the way it should!?!?)
Mutton was too much coocked(like black tarry stool!??!)

..
Paratha amused me....it just rooti with some ghee??!!

...
Forget the environment....forget the cost.....
After came out of the shop...I still wandering what the f**k I have done....
....at the summery....any village of Bengal can produce better mutton kosha....and about rating.....i still calculating .....

Perhaps one of the few reviews I am writing while drooling.

Even thinking about Golbari makes my palate go haywire.

I absolutely don't eat mutton. However, the thought goes off the window everytime I'm near Golbari. This place has the BEST mutton kosha in this city.

Albeit its greasy and mysteriously black in colour. But those notions can be overlooked because BOY is that tasty!
The chutney served is just as tasty. 
I am not someone who'd ignore the taste due to the ambiance.
Golbari gets a big thumbs up from me.

Its strange to see how a person who has grown up eatomg here and lives in shyambazar, havent reviewed golbari. Golbari is called so coz the shop is arched. Its just at the Cornwallis street and a.p.c bose road junction. You visit anytime of the day and n u r sure to find it crowded. Golbari is in the history of kolkata known for its kosha mangsho and rooti. I dont remember how many times i have tasted this authentic deadly combo. No restro can ever replace golbari on the kosha mangsho grounds. people who dont like spicy food wouldnt even mind the spices as it is super tasty. The baked rotis are equally great.the imli chutney they give along with this..cannot be missed. I also love the liver masala and the deadly torka. Among the fries the egg devil is a real devil to the tasye buds. Haf wid chicken keema and tge rest haf duck egg. I think the best devil in kolkata. U can even try the fish fry. Theres very less space to sit .. so better would be the parcel option to avoid tge overcrowded situation. A must must try.

I remember my childhood days when my father used to bring the famous "golbarir kosha mangsho" on his way home from office. I remember relishing it back then. But recently i went there after my college hours and was quite disappointed. That charm of the "mangsho" is no more. And the prices have also gone up, not keeping with the standards. We ordered a paratha and the "kosha mangsho". After waiting for a few minutes in the hot, humid and small interior, we were served with the dishes. The mutton was very oily and didn't taste anything unique. The pieces were rather bones than meat even. The parathas were also very oily and hard.

Located in the famous crossing of shyambazar, this place still continues to be one of the delicacies of bongs. And will continue to be so, because of its name. Being a bong you should try this, since it's one of the landmarks since time immemorial. But considering so many good food outlets these days, you would hardly find it mesmerising.

I used to be a frequent visitor here few years back (still I visit, but not frequently like before). Golbari need no introduction to all the food lovers from Kolkata. For those who still unaware of this shop but willing to visit in near future, it is right on Shyambazar Five Point Crossing, The name of the restaurant is actually New Punjabi Hotel.


Kosha Mangsho and Golbari have become almost synonymous. The menu is short here as most of the people order only their legendary Kosha Mangsho and Paratha here, so did i. You will find the mutton kosha dark and rich with loads of oil around the plate (you wont find any dark mutton kosha anywhere in Kolkata I guess) which comes with the Paratha and amazing chutney.


Please note, the place is very small with around 14 people sitting arrangement with some low tables. So its better to carry your food home (as they don’t provide Home Delivery :/). Not recommended for people don’t like oily and spicy food.



It’s a very small place with very few sitting arrangements inside and with old Kolkata feel. And price wasn’t soo high and you get what you pay for.



This is a must visit place for people like meat with parathas. 

It used to be a legendary place for Mutton Kasha n roti and various others but sadly in the recent times,  Quality has reduced to humongously whereas the price keeps rising. Previously it used to boasts itself of mutton curry n tandoori but now its worst, forgot the marination process perhaps. I ordered for a mutton kima and waited for its arrival eagerly. But I did come indeed but I wanted them to take it back. Hard like a rubber. The curry was filled with small pisces of bones. Not good enough surely. I hope others don't experience such hardcore horror ;) 
Place is also small n congested. Merely any place left to stand and eat. And in the hot summer days.........God forbid. After experiencing such melodramatic nightmare, I hope to change my review in near future. But for now, its a................

Almost every foodie in Kolkata must have visited this small place.The same goes for me. It is very old and small to be made as a restaurant, but this is exactly like the old Calcutta used to be. Done in marble mostly , you have slabs attached with the wall to sit down and eat. 
Don't think about presentation. They charge for the onions they give along with their famous kosha mangsho and porota.

The taste is fabulous but i would really love to see the " Mangsho" on the plate rather than only jhol , which is more of oil. 
The price is not okay , in accordance with the quantity.

So , I am not entirely disappointed but i am not particularly happy about this place.

I wouldn't write anything about the place. Coz, didn't like it one bit. It was shabby, and  clumsy with no ventilation. Place has a few small speed fans attached to the walls. You can't really eat at peace over here. But, the best part about this place is kosha mangsho (mutton) and parathas. That's the only thing you would order and lick your fingers after you have finished it. Yes, it's that tasty. Though it's very spicy, but the quality was really good, and the taste was something which you wouldn't get in other restaurants.

The joint at the heart of "Shyam Bazar" is another example of the popular belief that when it comes to food tradition doesn't necessarily speaks for itself. I have heard a lot about this place,the creators of "Kosha Mangso", both from my father & my grandfather which was enough to make my inner foodie curious.
 As I researched about the place, I got to know that the original"gol-Bari" was shutdown a couple of years back & then they resurfaced as "New Punjabi Hotel" with a new management & probably (but most importantly) with a 'newer' cook. Half of my gusto was lost then & there.
After much confrontation with my food soul, one fine evening I finally ended up at the door step(read footpath) of the famed 'Gol-Bari' & soon enough I lost rest of my appetence.The place is puny yet most annoyingly they are cooking, serving & washing all at the same place & at the same time. Any person with some sense of hygiene will deny to eat here. Well no one said the path of a foodie is easy, so after gathering my leftover courage I sat down on their bantam benches ( yes you read it correctly -benches) to order my food. The first thing you will notice about this place is the lack of items on their menu(the one that hangs on the wall). Half of them are either not available or been sold out on the first hour of business.
Finally I ordered a plate of each 'mutton kosha" & "chicken kosha" with parathas.Well I consider myself a naive in terms of authentic Bengali cuisine so if 'opulence of spices & oil accompanied by pieces of meat' is called "kosha mangso" then they have done an excellent job.I literally shuddered at the thought of the Food-coma I'm going to get into after that meal.Coming to the food, the parathas were thin but cold & it was a labours' task to tear them in pieces. The chicken was dry, overcooked & felt like a chalk in my mouth. The gravy was heavily spiced but the chicken itself wasn't seasoned at all. Where on the other hand the mutton was under cooked & I had to use my canine to break through the pieces. The place is non-AC & will be incredibly hot during the summer evenings. I genuinely felt the place was over priced  for the conditions & the quality of the food they serve.The only good thing about the place is their service. It's quick & plausible.
Final verdict-avoid this place if you are not much into spices & more into hygiene. Only visit if you are a die-hard believer of showing off your heritage.

Trust me, I kinda force myself to tolerate it untill I finish the food and run out for my life.

Shyambazar's Golbari- the name evokes nostalgia in many people. Only for the sake of ths name i went there frm tollygng to shyambzr, but ohhhh my gosh.!! All my expectations shattered in a min. The condition of the restaurant is nt at all up to expectations.. The cooking processes is also not hygenic they cook in a huge vessel which remains uncovered and d gravy portion goes on boiling on d flame day after day and they directly put d raw flesh pcs into dat.. After tht d place is so much congested tht one cant move without pushing each other, and lastly the mutton curry was so much oily, spicy and madly fiery tht i had to have an ice cream rushing out frm thr without finishing the curry.. All i want to say only nostalgia cant please u when eating out and hunger is concerned..

Situated at Shyambazar 5-point crossing New Punjabi Hotel (popularly known as Golbari) is famous for its kosha mangsho. Being born and brought up at Shyambazar, I have visited this place umpteenth time and had its kosha mangsho, paratha, egg curry and devil since childhood. Yes, it used to serve the best kosha mangsho once but not anymore. The quality of mutton is very hard with too much oil. Most of the time you only get bones and mutton fat with gravy. Sorry for mutton lovers, not recommended at all.

Golbari r mangsho & roti is simply out of this world. I used to be a frequent visitor here during my college days as it was on the way. There is no ambiance at all so if you feel you want to eat Gobarir Mangsho and porota then it is always better to pack the food and have it at home or office. Though i prefer sitting in those shabby chairs and tables and savouring the taste of the yummy Mutton Kasa Jhol and the soft rotis that will melt in your mouth and watch the cook prepare the item in a huge vessel. The aroma spreads all over the street and makes you crave for more and more of the ambrosial food.  Not recommended for people who do not like spicy and oily food or those who are on diet. The food here is strictly for foodies who do not mind the gastronomical extravaganza :p This is a heritage joint and people of North Kolkata and South Kolkata have flocked here over the decades to savour the taste of this mouth watering dish.

I would have given a higher rating just for the chutneys they make, but their cons' list is way more than their pros' list!Pros1) amazing chutney that compliments the mutton dishes perfectly2) pretty tasty mutton kasha and oil free thin parathas.here I will start a quite long Cons list, and golbari lovers dont kill me for that, its just that I would really appreciate if you improve upon these points.1) the shops remains closed for...(how shall i put it nicely?) at least four months. It did occur on more than one occasions when I took a metro all the way from kalighat to shyambajar just for the sake of golbari and alas, they were closed.2) the mutton kasha pieces that we get are really below the average size. I mean the price is pretty decent and I wouldn't mind paying a little more for at least decent sizes of mutton.3) you never seem to get mutton kasha and you have to choose from the rest of the options (very few) that are available.4) Ghost stories and their mutton cutlet are same in the way that I have only heard of both of them. I mean I live in south Kolkata and it takes me quite sometime to reach there, so I hope you people make sufficient mutton cutlets provided your restaurant is open.5) the seating places, I have friends simply refusing to pay a visit to this restaurant for this..I mean i know that its important to stick to your cultural roots but I guess its not that important to shoo off your customers.Trust me you would want to lose your south Kolkatan fans so plz consider my points.

Golbari needs no introduction. It is almost synonymous with Shyambazar crossing. Last Saturday I got a chance to taste the famous "Golbarir kosha mangsho". Its not a fine dining place, so you shouldn't expect fancy interiors but they should improve their seating arrangement. Coming to the food, the mutton looked great with its famous dark complexion. But the mutton pieces were not so tender. Though the combination of the paratha and Mutton was not great, but it was not bad either. It was okayish. One can definitely find better mutton elsewhere. For trying once, Golbari wasn't bad but i dont think i would give it a second try.

It is a very small and congested joint in the Shyam Bazar area and one should prefer their take away rather than dine-in if possible, as the place is too congested as I felt.
Price wasn't very high and so falls light on pocket. Food however wasn;t really great for me.
Somehow I didn't feel that very well about their oil they used. However an average joint that could be given a try.

We can never judge a place based on its size and decor. Golbari is one among the road side small space where they have yummiest mutton amd chicken (I've tried only two dishes of both). It's one of the best of you are in north kolkata (Shyam bazaar). 

Highly recommended!

I Love Golbari. The main thing I always like about it (from my Childhood) is that I born and bought up at Shyambazar.So, Golbari always tries to make me hungry by smells of Mutton kosha when I Pass it by. After all I brought from there many times because of the smell. I have a list of dishes what I Like and I dislike.. So, they are Motton Kosha,Motton Liver, Chicken Cutlet and Chicken Chop. I don't like Chicken/Mutton Kima.. But if you have problem with Stomach then this is the place is not for you because they are famous for making rich food and believe me their food's are RICHI RICH. :D Anyways I think this might help.

On different times, I grow up a passion for specific type of food. Earlier it was trying different types of animals, and now it is to try the old heritage restaurants of Kolkata. So Golbari is definitely not to be missed.'
 Near Metro Station and right on Shyambazaar 5 points crossing, this is a very tiny place and easy to miss. The inside is somewhat stuffy and not so beautiful. But the food did blow us away. I didn't like the Chicken dishes much like the Chicken Masala. But the Mutton Items were simply mind-blowing. The mutton keema (minced mutton) and mutton chap were delectable. Spicy, super tasty albeit somewhat oily and rich, but who cared :D We had Parathas with it and the servers were all going around asking if anyone needs more. Simply awesome and definitely cheap. Feels like being transported decades back.

There is actually very few who havent heard of Golbari, kosha mangsho with roti is the bezt over there, but i feel its loosing its value over the years, it should be well maintained they need to work on seating arrangements n run a place more hygenic... I might be wrong but i feel Golbari lost its taste over the years also, please dont let this place die, the owners should spent more time on every issues regarding this place, starting from hygenic n quality of food to the overall exterior of the place

Been there so many times, always tried only one combination , roti and mutton kosha. Never tried to look on menu, so this review won't be ever a comprehensive one. Still want to read? Clever guy. Yeah, though they have many things listed on there menu, it's the only combo, which I mentioned that they famous for. Being an ardent lover of the mutton preparation, I have noticed that, some people really hate the taste of the mutton kasha of Golbari. So the same food actually made them famous and infamous in the city. This is possibly the most spiciest preparation of mutton in n around Kolkata and possibly the same reason some people hate it, includes my wifey. You ll be not sure until u taste it, in which side u ll count yourself, haters or lovers. So rush n let us know ur opinion.

located at the 5 point crossing of Shyambazar amidst the bustling cityscape, the place stands for tradition no doubt, but the standard has fallen with time considerably. on a sunday noon we reached after a joyful tram ride and the 'gol'- circular pattern of 'golbari' caught our eyes in no time, but the interior seemed very congested. we got into the vintage world of kolkata which gave us a feel of the yore calcutta days. it was crowded as usual, only the office goers being replaced by family gatherings. overall the ambience was homely but the boorish behavior of the stuffs can easily piss one off. now while taking the food into consideration which is offcourse the main attraction of the place & is of traditional punjabi style being the reason of introducing punjabi cuisines in calcutta, to my disappointment, the quality has deteriorated compared to the ones brought to my home in my childhood. the mutton kasa was good in taste provided with good old authentic flavor, still the quality has gone down with pieces so bonny, the gravy being overcooked and replete with dalda more than refined mustard oil. however the paratha was soft & the pickle they serve along was intoxicating & yummy. we also had mutton chops which was by no means up to the mark, the authentic salad of bit,cucumber and onion was not fresh either. nevertheless the mutton afghani was satisfactory. some of my friends ordered for chicken cutlet and chicken do piaza which were okay but had nothing special about them. i would suggest people to visit the place for once who have heard a lot about them but obviously not to the ones who are allergic to mutton cause the chicken is even more plain here.

i have gone to this restaurent atleast 10-15 times. its biggest advantage is its location, shyambazar 5 point crossing. the place is very small, max 15-18 people can seat at a time. stuffs are ok, nothing special. i have tried here roti, mutton kasa, mutton kima, chicken liver and chicken masala. all the foods are very tasty and spicy. the best is the mutton kasa obviously. their roti is not traditional roti, paratha sort of. also they provide a chutney, it's so good that anyone can eat a roti with that only. 
now considering the cons, the biggest problem is they use too much dalda in their preparations to make it heavily rich, not at all good for health. since this oulet is quite small, crowd management is not so effective which causes sometimes a huge waiting time. but still there's no piont to disagree that this should be  obviously part of traditional Kolkata - "Golbarir roti and kosha mangso"...

Location of "golbari" is unknown to any Kolkatan is most unlikely.the 5 point crossing of shyambazar is that place.their different style mutton preparation with paratha & special tamarind chatni makes d tastebuds cheerful.went there 3yrs ago last time.but 1 caution before hand, the place is too small to accommodate large group,so its Best to do take away &enjoy it in your home.

Legend has it that the Netaji statue in the Shyambazar crossing has its eyes on this eatery... Small hot place beneath what seemed to me as a staircase... The huge kadai cooks the mutton to a reddish black.. And it tastes like heaven... I fear sometimes that how they have stayed so long of the American radar for their dishes never have been shy of oil... You would be clever enough to go straight for a thumsup as soon u fill urself with the famous Kosha Mangsho of Golbari.

Golbari located at Shyambazzar 5 point crossing is a eatery you cant miss.
Famous for its legendary black coloured Kasha Mangsho ie Mutton Curry with handmade paratha onion salad and tamarind chutney does bring water to my mouth just  by hearing....
its a must try for any one travelling to Kolkata and having an appetite for rich food.
don't expect a five star treatment in-house cos the place is a bit shabby and u would be lucky enough to find ur seat without waiting during rush hours....
And you are bound to lick ur fingers...

I don't think we need to write any review for this legendary place. 
Golbari is one of the few old food joints in North kolkata that has survived the glitter and ecstasy of so called fine dining restaurants and retained there reputation for such long. 
You won't get fancy chairs and decor to welcome you at Golbari , neither there would be someone saying " Hello " at the gate. 
The thing that only matter is the taste, they have constantly maintained their unique taste for years after years.
Golbari is known for its famous kosha mangsho,although its very good. The key is to slide into the thin benches and order the standard plate - Two parathas which are thin fried circles of dough with kasha mangsho that comes with imli chutney and small portion of salad. Apart from kasha mangsho.. Their mutton keema,fish fry,fish cutlets are fantastic. 
The service is very fast.. One of the heritage place for foodies to visit. 

My rating -
Service - 5 out of 4
Expenses - 5 out of 4.5 ( Reasonable ) 
Food - 5 out of 5 ( very tasty ) 
Ambience - 5 out of 2

Golbari..!
One such place which will never fail to disappoint you no matter how hard you try. I have been to this place since I was a kid. I still remember my Uncle bringing in "Torka" in a sealed clay pot all the way from Shyambazar and needless to say I never did want anything else other than Rice or Roti to fill in my taste buds.
With time, the price has increased. Quality has also seen a slight decline. But, more or less there has not been a sharp downfall much one may see happening with most restaurants.
They do not serve Torka anymore but their Kosha Mangsho and Kima very well acts as a good substitute. To top the food, once you are done eating, try and cross the road and reach out for the Juice Shop just beside Rahmania and quench your thirst with a Orange/Musambi Juice.

Okay golbari happens to be one of the most hyped and talked about food joints of kolkata . And trust me its all worth it . So if you are ready to wait in a long  queue to enter the small cabin when you are inanely hungry and the smell of kosha mangsho has made its way through your nose you are a true foodie and you deserve golbari :D . What can i say about their kosha mangsho . Its delicious to say the least . Other items like chicken masala ,liver curry , cutlet , kabiraji , chop each and everything is amazing . Even their ruti is great . you can gorge on to  a minimum of 5 rutis there . i loved golbari and hope you ll love it too . so what are you waiting for . take a metro and get your ass off at shyambazar golbari :)

My father gave me a surprise when one day he bought Golbari;s "Kosha Mnagsho" when he passing Shambazar on a Sunday evening. I have heard a lot about this place from childhood but haven't been so fortunate to have this dish of this Heritage place of Kolkata.
I have never seen this particular color of Mutton Kosha- my 1st reaction was, Wow!! And then when I tasted it , ^_^ it was heaven !! Loved it.. I took the dish with paratha and salad , and it just made my dinner wonderful. Would love to have the item again and again!!

The rating is because of its sheer heritage value and the taste of THE one dish that had made it famous in the bengali culinary history, 'The Golbari mutton kasha'. No words to describe this delicacy. It has a grammar of its own, a blend of rich Indian spices. This dish is not for the faint hearted, the flavor of raw chilly will make you cry both by its intensity as well as the tsunami that it sets in your taste buds.

I had great expectations of Golbari'r kosha mangsho. Unfortunately it turned out to be grossly disappointing.
I had heard so many stories from my parents about Golbari's (aka Punjabi Hindu Hotel) legendary fare. Especially one of my uncles who resides a short walk away from Golbari. He has told me so many tales about late night parties at his home and his friends' homes when his responsibility had been to get the kosha mangsho.
However, I was not to experience any such thing. The taste of the curry was not too bad but nothing extraordinary as I had hoped and wished. The meat was rather rubbery and chewy. In all there were about 12 pieces of mutton (three quarters) and only three of then turned out to be tender. I did expect the food to be oily but I also expected it to taste mind blowing. Deeply saddened. Also I had ordered a portion of kima. The kima was well cooked and not chewy but it had way too much salt in it. Again disappointed.
While taking away the food I had a roll which too was average, both the paratha and the mutton kebabs inside the roll. With a heavy heart I have to now go to bed accepting the fact that I will perhaps never be able to experience the Golbari that I have heard so much about.

This is the best place to try Mutton Kasha. Its a very old, established around 1915-1920 I think. My Grandfather used to take  my father to this place. Still remember when my father first took  me to this place, that time I was in Class 8 or around. After that I often  visited the place when I get time. During Durga Puja we gather at this place with my friends. 

About the ambiance, I do agree its small and slightly suffocated but after tasting the Kasha maghso with special paratha type roti it feels better than 5 star hotel, Yes I speaking from heart. I like old food joint of kolkata so much nostalgia associated with it.

I don't have to talk about the quality/taste of kosha maghso as its just class above excellence. We often tell, you should make khosa maghso like Golbori so you can guess its the  best.

Food that we love to have, is not always the ones we should have !! That is again proved by this age old outlet at shyambazar 7 point crossing.
Their kasha mangsho, though at first inspection looks too oily to have, is something you will not forget in a while. Had with chapatis,served here, its a sinful mix of the right spices and some succulent mutton pieces, cooked in a thick gravy.
Its mostly a take away joint though, and having it in the cramped up interiors of the place is not recommended. 
And definitely not for people who like to keep a watch on their diet :-)

I rated it 4 plain and simply because of it's mutton kassa, hands down. Although I thnk it's a bit overpriced, obviously because of being famous, but still. this is the best mutton kassa in town. The colour, the aroma and the taste, they are all heavenly. Have it with their butter-roti for complete pleasure. Only thing is they can try to make the place a bit more comfortable to sit in, that is the difficult part.

A famous bengali Food critic once said that being a non-vegeterian is ALMOST incomplete without  visiting Golbari once.It's almost like a rite of passage for the "kosha mangsho" loving bengali.
I'hv been drooling,quite literally,on the famous golbari mangsho ever since i was a child. I remember anxiously licking a bit of gravy from my dad's fingers when i was a kid,and then running around like my mouth was set on fire.So a review on Golbari,which has acquired cult status over time,was long over due.
Golbari has possibly the most memorable mutton kasha and mutton keema in the city. Chicken was never there usp though.
AND ONE MUST REMEMBER THAT THE FOOD IS NOT FOR THE FAINT HEARTED.
The mutton kasha is spicy and oily as hell,but then with taste like that nobody complains.And its tastes best with the porota they serve.And ofcourse not to forget their mysterious chutney. the combo on a whole is a sort of sinful indulgence.
and as for the ambiance,it may be clumsy and stuffy.But it's still retained that old world charm-something that makes the food taste better somehow.
On the whole delectable as ever .Golbari scores high on taste,charm and memories,all that a true food loving bangali wants. Plus it's pocket friendly as well. :)

Crowded. Over-crowded. Must try mutton/chicken kassha. Well that pretty much describes this joint. If you dont have a weak stomach, you HAVE TO try the kassha of this place. Once would be enough to make you want it numerous times again. It's best to order parcels from here. You'll be lucky if you get a seat. Service is....as expected from this type of a place. Not much of a great ambience. Dont expect much from the rest of the menu. But the kassha is brilliant.

This is the second time I visited this so called so famous place of Kolkata in order to find out that they have only one thing left with them that is "Heritage". I could not put my review after my first visit because Zomato was not there at that point of time. But I am surprised to see that after so much competition from their competitors they are serving the same lousy experience as they used to serve 6/7 years back. They are famous for "Kasha Mangso" and I am definite that better Kosha Mangsos are available in this city nowadays. The moment you enter and sit the waiters will ask for money because they need to make some "Slip". You pay the money , sit there and get the service of a plate of old "Kosha Mangso" along with two paranthas which are colder than the kosha Mangso. You eat just to find out that it is not that food item which you have imagined in your mind before coming there. Their Kosha Mangso has everything except the taste. It is oily. It is beautifully colored by slow cooking. 4 pieces of mutton which are not that bit bad in size even but somewhere the taste is missing. Someone may feel it as overcooked or burned even. Though I did not have that feeling. Overall experience will be only in the negative side. Ratings can be followings

Location 5 / 5, Space in the Restaurant 1 / 5, Overall Ambiance 1 / 5, Delivery time 3 / 5, Food Taste 1.5 / 5, Food Variety 1.5/ 5,  Food Portion 3 / 5, Food Price 3 / 5, Hygiene 2 / 5, Service and Behavior  2.5 / 5, Overall experience 1 / 5 Visit again Quotient 0 / 5

Overall suggestion: AVOID

I was a regular visitor of Golbari during my 3 yrs in Kolkata, We used to travel this far just for the love of mutton, the authentic taste of mutton kasa is what Golbari is famous for. The mutton used be really tender and is worth every penny. Though the place is bit cramped, but the taste really makes up for everything.

I dare you too find better kosa mangso anywhere in Kolkata. I understand it’s not for the faint of harts but I can assure you nothing beats it! Place is a bit cramped and always packed up, but the location of this eatery is unmatched and the price is within reach. One good to know information is that Quarter plate serves 2 people so don’t go overboard and order a full plate. Frankly I only order mutton kosa and Porota and take it back home rest of the items in their menu are average,

I got a chance to savor the good old kosha mangsho last week, thanks to my wife.  She took the pain to collect the food after her office, because she is a bigger foodie than me!

She brought mutton kosha and liver kosha. I locally got the rumali rotis. The rest is history.

Aah...ohhh...slurrppp...."outta worl"..."amazing"...."durdhorsho"....chomp chomp.....ohhhhf....."fatafati".... 

The kosha may be a little less black in color, but has that same old flavor. Finishing off 3 rumalis each and 3 pc-es of mutton and 2 large liver pc-es was a matter of 8 mins. It was like....like..what to say....well...orgasmic!!

I plan to taste their other items too.....but cant stop slurping off the last bit of kosha mangsho gravy even in my dream.

Located in Five point crossing at Shyambazar, Golbari had been Bengali's favourite place since years. The traditional taste of Parota (Parantha made of Flour) and the obvious the trademark of Golbari "Kosha Mangsho" (Mutton / Chicken in a thickened gravy ) is the highlight of this place. If you are health conscious and staying away from OIL ;) you can add this place in your cheat day after 5 days of workout.

I would always love to rate this place only for TASTE, TASTE and TASTE i.e 4.0

Another over hyped place famous for its so called KASHA MANGSHO . The place is crammed, unhygienic rather dirty. The famous mutton is served in a quarter plate .Oil oozing  out,  the famous black thick gravy with four pieces of mutton.Something halfway between a roti and paratha was served.And off course there was the chutney and salad. The oil infested rotis hardly  chew able.The mutton was hard.The taste was nothing mind blowing......very very ordinary. No soap to clean your oily hands . Somehow balancing in the small passageway I washed my hands.Next to the basin I saw the  famous mutton  being prepared in a huge kadai..Zero service.Here you have to pay first and enter.If anything extra taken you pay while coming out. Bought a keema (minced meat) dish and two chicken cutlets for home.Again severely disappointing. Oil was drooling from the keema.None tasted delicious......just ordinary. Let me keep away from this legendary place.

I don't think you need to write a review for this legendary place. People who would like to taste "Golbari" need to go down to Shyambazaar 5 point crossing and taste the food themselves. "Golbari" is one of the few old food joints in North Kolkata that has survived the glitter and ecstasy of so called fine dining restaurants and have retained their reputation for such long time. "New Punjabi Hotel" as the name stands still now is a narrow, clumsy food joint with a very limited menu but unlimited taste. You don't have fancy chairs and decor to welcome you at the hotel, neither there would be someone saying "hello" at the gate for you, the thing that only matters is the taste which is a pure bliss. They have maintained their unique taste for years after years and to counter the prophecy some recently cropped up food joints in Kolkata have somehow 'copied' the recipe, but the true legend remains in its pole position (always).

I never had or though of having anything other the Mutton Kasa they selve. A quarter is enough for a single person. The taste is high on everything - use of hand grind spices and mustard oil is the main reason that adds to the flavour. Yes.. its spicy, hot and flavourful which surely would burn your tastebud and bring tears out of your eye but you won't be able to stop eating the magnificent dish. Its a pure ecstasy, a delightful heavenly feeling when you dip the "Porota" in the spicy gravy and gulps down your throat. The "Porota" is not the usual bengali or lachha porota but something very unique. The Kasa is black in color with oil floating on top of the dish, with each quarter plate containing 4 pieces of mutton. The mutton is not very succulent and soft but you would have to sometimes hard try to tear it apart from the bone. The true joy lies in that.

Also I would ask people not to try the dish inside the place which has very limited seats and the inside is very hot and crampy which would not enable you to have the best experience. Pack the food, take it home and enjoy the meal.

Report Card for Golbaari

Taste - 10/10
Ambience - 5/10
Service - 9/10 (I rate the take away service)
Value for Money - 10/10

Legend has it that no one knows whether 'Golbarir mangsho' (a beautiful meat curry from Golbari) created the traffic jam at the crossing point of Shyambazaar or vice-versa but whatever it is the meat curry is this unique oily curry which is good enough to halt traffic.

Now one of the phrases I personally absolutely despise is 'the taste is not what it used to be' or the classic 'it has become very bad' from so and so year without further explanation as to what would be the taste from a by-gone era or why it has become bad. I shall tell you exactly why, this is a common trait of superiority. It is as if the person concerned wants you to consciously feel that you are missing out on a taste which this other person has had the privilege of tasting. of course I would take such opinions seriously if there is a logic with the statement. I agree with a dear friend of mine who is much older than me hence her having tasted it over a greater number of years than I have who had pointed out that she has on certain occasions been disappointed with tough meat from this legendary joint of Calcutta. I myself have had soft succulent tender meat and tough chewy and horrible meat from the eatery in question.

Now I am going to share m y experience not from the past but from the present , which is today 5th March 2014 and I have to say these classic places should always be given the benefit of the doubt.

. To be clear  the name of the restaurant is 'New Punjabi Hotel' , it is called golbari because it literally translates to 'round house' and that comes form the structure if you look at it from the opposite side of the road.

Now there are a few items in this shop but the legendary dish is the 'Kosha mangshi' 'Bhuna Gohst' It is a delicious meat curry which is curried to a point where it appears black in colour, the curry itself is spicy yet hot in a way where the average joe does not have steam blowing out from his ears and these succulant pieces of meat. Now I personally would not advise people to sit down and have a meal at this joint because it is cramped , small and extremely hot. So I packed the 'kosha mangsho' along with a chicken cutlet. Now usually people have this curried meat with 'paranthas' shallow fried flat-bread but the oily curry and shallow fried flatbread is not best friends with my stomach and I much prefer the handmade chapati because it balances out on oiliness since it is soft , moist and the curry is oily, robust and delicious. I did get it packed and the chapatis were not bought from this eatery.

Now I started with the cutlet which was every bit delicious. I shall state that the amount of spices used was perfect for my taste buds since I did not have tears rolling down due to excessive usage of chilis and I could taste the flavours of ginger garlic , chili and coriander leaves. The amount of mince chicken was generous and the coating was thin making it an absolute delight. They had not packed the usual condiment that is served with these snacks, the 'kasundi' a mustard sauce from bengal with a punch and I did try and use my homemade mustard sauce but then I realized when the flavours, the saltiness, spices etc  are so well balanced for my taste buds I wouldn't want some condiment to drown the original taste of the cutlet which is superb.

Truth be told I was a bit skeptical about the curried meat since I myself have had the experience of chewy meat from the place but with one bite I was completely satisfied. You get 4 pieces of succulent meat which is soft enough to be torn with two fingers and that with the soft chapatis is a roller coaster ride through tasty-land. The curry is spicy and oily and a sheer delight. I used both chapati and rice because rice soaks up the oil much better and for my taste buds the mellowed down oiliness due to the mixing with rice works beautifully. So I suggest using chapatis for 2 pieces and rice for the rest . However I must admit that while I received three succulent, soft juicy and tender pieces of meat there was this 1 piece which was horribly chewy, disgustingly dry but then again when 75% of the meat was soft , tender and perfect for my taste buds I see no reason to slam this legendary eatery.

I would say this eatery shall keep halting traffic for years to come.



----- 25 Apr, 2013 -----

In an article published in 2010 in The Telegraph Victor Banerjee had said that it is still unknown whether the traffic jam at the crossing of Shyambazaar had opened Golbari or whether Golbari is the cause of the legendary traffic jam at the crossing. While veteran patrons of the heritage eatery criticize the fall in its taste of what it used to be once even they cannot resist the legendary meat and usually the criticism takes place while they take bites into the dish. I would have to second one of my fellow reviewers that their quality is inconsistent and while sometimes you are presented with soft succulent meat at other times it might be very chewy and I believe consistent quality is one of the characteristics of a good eatery and is especially expected of a heritage institution of eatery. It is my personal view that the place is not suitable for gentle folks to sit down and eat and is best carried back home. I have often heard from the old and wise that mutton is supposed to be never chewy but also not melt in the mouth texture. As per them they want their meat soft and succulent yet requiring the usage of the particular teeth used for tearing off the meat and if in luck Golbari gives you that exact tender meat preparation. Blackened with constant  cooking over low heat and being monitored by an expert cook it is black yet not burnt which make sit 'kosha' It oozes out oil and so one must throw caution to cholesterol and fat while enjoying this delightful dish dipped either in homemade paranthas or soft white fluffy rice. I personally prefer rice since the meat is a bit salted for my taste (I must here state that I usually take a very low amount of sodium compared to most people) I also usually avoid their paranthas because it had once led to severe acidity. I hope it gloriously does business forever and I suggest they always give the perfect quality meat instead of sometimes presenting their beloved customers with chewy meat.

So  finally  got  to  taste   the   great  Golbarir  Kosha  Mangsho...the  mouth watering ,  delicious mutton   which has    remained  a   favourite must have   item  on  the  plates  of  all  meat  lovers    in  the  city  and  beyond! Situated   at  the  Shyambazar crossing    this  restaurant   has  been  catering   to  several  generations of  mutton  lovers  now.  Though  there  are  several other  items  on  the  menu  Golbari  is  primarily  known  for  its  Kosha   Mangsho  and  Paratha   and  we  had brought exactly   that for  our  dinner.... I hadn't  visited  the  place  so  can't  talk about  the  ambiance  etc... Coming  to  the  food  , the  mutton  was good   but  a  bit  on  the  harder  chewy side...  the  gravy  tasted  fine    but  was bit  too  oily  and  spicey.  I  would  prefer  my  mom's  mutton  any day  over  this ,  but  then  we  all  enjoy   our  mother's  cooking  the  most !   :P  The  paratha   was   quite  thin  and  average... Overall an  enjoyable    meal ...won't  say  am  disappointed but   nothing  outstanding  either! Sure   try  it out ...  :)
                    P.S. -Tried the food  again , the mutton still remains average but the Fish Fry was quite good! :)

Golbari is renowned for Kasha Mangsho especially mutton though chicken is too good.

I first have it here in 1998. From that time I became Fan of Golbari.

Try GOLBARI KASHA MANGSHO with Porota.

The rate is very decent.

The ambience is NOT AT all good so parcel it and enjoy the GREAT TASTE in home.

I'm loving it.

Golbari is attributed as 'nostalgia' of north Kolkata. We shared their food from my childhood. But the encounters seems too feeble now-a-days as it lost it charms.

Ambiance and hygiene is not a priority over here so don't ask for that. It is famous for Mutton Kasha and it's Roti. The uniqueness of it's 'Roti' is that it is an amalgamation of paratha and normal homemade bread. It's unique, never too oily never too chewy. But you have to have it then and there. Parceling and microwaving eventually spoil the whole moisture. It then become very soggy and chewy.

The star is Mutton kasha. Aroma is still there but the mutton piece(s) are not worth mentioning now. It became hard, chewy, boney; not good at all. It has lost it's charm. Gravy is thick, oily but tastes good. It is not for faint-hearted although. 

Many other items are there like chops, chicken liver etc. Chops are good sometimes as well chicken liver and masala, but not so-good. Overall ok.

Try it if you want to be in old-world charm. but not specially recommended.

bad one..seriously a disheartening experience i had here after hearing to all the legacies of the place from my parents and grandparents..filthy place rather as i would like to call it as..the item for which it carries its fame for, mutton kasha is as bad as you can't even think of and tasted quite bitter to me..parathas can't be worse than the ones they provide..simply hated it

'Golbari' - the oh-so-heritagious food joint of Kolkata is actually no-at-all-happening place tbh ! To my utter surprise, im highly disappointed by the taste , quality and flavor of the food served . Driven by the huge popularity of the place had infused a desire in me to visit the place for long. 

An age old food joint, North Kolkata were the main attraction..but Alas !
We ordered usual Mutton Kosha and Parathas but it was pathetic . All i could see was oil floating all over the kosha and parathas were ice cold and rock hard , pathetic ! You need a hell lot of effort to tear the paratha . Leaving the facts that the place is miserably small and highly congested, you ll hardly get a place to sit, and of course judged by the service and quality of the food ..the place is not at all pocket friendly . 150 for 2 insane parathas and one oil dipped mutton kosha is just way too much .
The experience i gathered from my first Golbari visit will encourage me not to go there ever again and i wont recommend this food joint to anyone.

Golbari is a historic place located at Shyambajar. They are just famous for thier mutton kasha and paratha.
Dreamy mutton kasha and mutton liver with paratha, onions and chutney.The mutton kasha is full of oil though and health conscious people wont like them. But taste is too good and the liver is just excusite :)
the best mutton indeed !! 
But the place is very small and compact. They can not accomodate too many people. They offer take aways as well :)

Part of the illusion formed in my mind was painfully shattered when I finally had to digest the fact that Golbari is not really "gol" (round in shape), but only situated at one semi circular corner of Shyambazar's five-point crossing. Well, maybe somewhere deep inside I'd expected (and wanted) it to look like a globe! :P 
On the last day of the previous year we decided to tick off one very old wish of ours, from the long 'to-do' list of restaurants to visit. So, after spending the morning browsing through and buying some old books from College Street, we landed up in front of this eighty-something year old building that was once, the definition and benchmark for "kosha mangsho". 
 
Now, for us Bengali’s, real "mangsho" is equal to the red meat or mutton, while chicken is only a bird and it doesn't really get a place in the "meat" section (sorry chicken lovers!). On entering the cramped little place, the first thing we noticed was the "mangsho" being cooked with great passion in a huge "korai" (wok) with the thick, red boiling broth. Its smell had already earned a point from me.
 
According to their system, we had to make a bill first and get a token before we could slip into a tinier and dingier room inside and get ourselves seated on the small wooden chairs.
Within a few minutes, our orders were promptly placed on the narrow marble top table, where we had the Kosha Mangsho (140 rupees a plate), parathas (8 rupees each). Surprisingly, we were still hungry after gobbling up so much, and a Fish Fry (50 rupees) was promptly called for.
 
Bengalis swear by two classic preparations of mutton, the healing "kochi pathar jhol" or the sinful "kosha mangsho". As expected this version of mutton was spicy, oily and very rich. Even though the taste was pretty okay, we could have done with softer and better cooked pieces of the meat. The parathas were probably made from a mixture of wheat and flour, which imparted the super softness and nice taste to it. They came with the much needed onion salad and an AMAZING imli (tamarind) chutney which I completely hearted after it’s very first hit of tanginess in my mouth!
On seeing the fish fry, we unanimously decided that they must have used up every last drop of oil in making the mutton curry and left none for the poor fish fry. Jokes apart, we were actually quite relieved to see the healthy-looking fry on our plates. Thankfully, the fish fillet was fresh and it tasted quite good all over.
 
What we concluded at after our first visit to this place is that, though this place might not please the finicky foodie, it’s most definitely a crowd puller, pleaser and performer.
 
P.S: To help get your digestive system a kick-start after having your meal, grab a bottle of any fizzy drink from the shop next to it and wrap it all up with a burp (like we did)! ;)

Those who want a nice ambiance with good service please avoid this restaurant. It is mainly a takeaway joint with a small sitting area. The food is a strict no for the health conscious people, but the real food lovers must give it a try.  the specialty of this restaurant is their famous Chicken Kasha, that so much extra spicy rich mouth watering dish is just enough to go crazy for the big foodies. Love it. Please give it a try atleast, but I would suggest to take away the food and have it in some other place then you could relish the taste in your own comfort.

The place is famous in the name of Golbari or Shyambajar Golbari. Hardly anybody recognizes it by the name of New Punjab Hotel!! It is bang in the middle of the Shyambajar 5 Point crossing looking straight on to the Netaji statue in the face. The furniture is old time business like wooden chairs and a running shelf acting as a table. They serve many items that a typical Punjabi-dhaba-style restaurant serves and also makes Chop-Cutlet in the evenings which is Chicken/Mutton Cutlet, Fish Fry etc.... but they are known for their "Bikhyato Gollbarir Kosha Mangsho" which in English translates to a mutton dish with a thick, spicy oily gravy ominously black in colour. In fact I still joke with my friends that they make the dish with the "old burnt mobil" that we get while changing oil in our motorccyles and that is the secret formula which is guarded like the formula of Coke!! Jokes apart, this Mutton Kosha is to be had with chapatis, which are typical Bangali "ruti"- small and light and fine. A little onion salad is in accompaniment. The Mutton with a reasonable amount of gravy and about a third of chapai makes a general morsel and the taste just explodes in the mouth! It could be quite stunning and jarring for a first timer and it never really loses its magic even for old timers like us. You wont be able to converse during the meal as the taste will not allow you to do that and the decor and ambience will make you feel like finishing the business on hand... That is actually a tribute to the fantastic taste of the dish which makes people sit down in the given ambience in a place cramped for space but you still have  a bunch of people waiting outside to get in after you finish!! After the meal, step out and have a Thums Up from the nest door shop and smoke two Gold Flake King Sizes in a row and you will know what is Heaven......

Yes, I am sorry for being rude but that is the only word that i can think of to summarise my experience. My fellow foodies might object to such a rude  description of my experience.But sorry folks, i beg to disagree.Simply thriving on nostalgia is not done.
Being a resident of the southern part of Kolkata happened to visit the joint after ages.I had pretty ordinary expectations from Golbari- in its new avatar after reading the reviews on this site.Thanks to my fellow contributors on this platform, their assessment of the food was spot on!!! I had ordered the usual staple menu- mutton keema,mutton kasha and the parathas. Both the items were horribly spicy,tasteless and too hot for consumption.Pieces of mutton- well you guessed it right, chewy like gum.Even the parathas seemed to be raw and stale.Prices have been jacked up- am OK with that, but a  tasteless dish priced at Rs 130/- plus and being packed in the tiniest container for delivery is dacoity in broad daylight. At that price point there will be hundreds of joints in Kolkata which will serve any non-veg dish at double the quantity currently being dished out by Golbari. I wish i could specify the container size in ml to reinforce my point.
Sadly this joint  too joins the list of other heritage joints of the bygone era which are dying a slow death and have been on a downhill trajectory for quite some time now.I am referring to the likes of Dilkusha cabin,Anadi cabin, Basanta cabin,Coffee House etc.They seem to thrive on nostalgia and nothing else.
Venture at your own risk with a prayer on your lips!!!

The problem with the 'City of Joy' is that, here once a 'diamond' is always a 'diamond'. No matter if it has actually been proved a false one. People love to brag about it. The ongoers start treating it as a pilgrimage and the ones sitting across the counters encash on it.

Same is the problem with New Punjabi Hotel (or the popularly known Golbari)! To be honest, I don't connect with its 'heritage' status as I was settled outside Bengal for a long time. So, the review will be based on my experience and not my forefathers'.

The small joint is located at the five point crossing of Shyambazar, not at all hard to locate because of its aroma filling the place. Many a times I've passed this place and the aroma has surely lured me. So, today I decided to try it out and I truly wish now, that I hadn't.

When we reached the place, we were made to wait. Understandable...because I did read here that the place is small and also, because its popular. The middle-aged chap sitting across the counter took our order, though and gave us the slip.

When I finally entered the place, I saw "small" is actually a very small word to describe the place. It is actually crampy, suffocating and there's hardly any place to move. In any case we took our seats.

I liked the staff and management, though. Be it the 'kaku' pouring on the plates from the big steel containers or the small fellow who cleans your table. They provide fast service and are polite, unlike some "heritage biriyani places" where the staff are rude and treat you as if they are doing you a big favour by serving you.

Now, coming to the food - we ordered what's famous here, that is kasha mangsho with paratha (accompanied by chutney and onion) and mutton keema. I dunked my paratha firstly in the keema, which was way too oily ( one can see the layer of oil floating). It was also, very spicy but still somewhat tasty in a different kind of way (I mean it wasn't bland or tasteless). Next I shifted my attention to the famous kosha mangsho. Here the layer of oil increases three times. But, it was comparatively less spicy than that keema. In any case (read: dish), the mutton was not soft, succulent and well-cooked. Though, I could eat the pieces in keema, the mutton in the kosha mangsho was not at all edible. 

So, if you don't have any problem with the visibly floating oil and the spicy dishes are tolerable to your senses, you can still pack your food.

I wish I had listened to the daadu (old fellow) who passed by us, saying  "Ei dokane ar aage kar byapar nei" (This place is now a talk of yester years), when we were waiting outside. May be He was God in disguise ;)

This is a heritage place in Kolkata. The kosha mangsho along with the parantha/roti and the imli chutney is to die for. This place is very old and the ambience is not good at all and seating is very cramped. Also the eating area is quite hot. But once the food arrives you will not worry about all these things. The taste simply blows you away. Although many people say that the quality has deteriorated over the years I don't find much of a difference. The service is quite fast and you will receive your order within 5 minutes of ordering.

Golbari is sort of indescribable when it comes to writing a review. You cannot write what heritage, nostalgia and love makes this place, and personally, after coming here for 23 + years, I think I am completely biased for the space. The key to eating at Golbari is to know what you are eating, and stick to those food, and not budge. The new items introduced to the menu post 1990 are mostly average. And no, its not just about the Kasha Mangsho, although its very good. The key is to slide into one of the thin little benches, and order the standard plate - two parathas, which are thin fried circles of dough, with the kasha mangsho, that comes with a lovely sour chutney and a small handful of salad. Kasha apart, I love the mutton keema, which is amazing, and the fish roll as well as the fish fry. The service is fast to say the very least, and although not airconditioned, a great place to pack food from, or eat in the evening. Wash everything down with an ice cream soda or jal jeera from the shop next to it, and you have got a Kolkata Heritage ticked from your list.

This legendary establishment at the confluence of the seven five point crossing at Shyambajaar is one of the pillars of kolkata cuisine. It's also probably a place which 90% of our fathers used to frequent in college. (Their words, not mine ) You must have heard of it's delicasies. And it has fallen in a way in which only the greats do. Hard. I feel sorry for the management, having to scrape an existence out of past fame. It's a shame.

The quality has dropped, hygiene is out the window and the plasters are peeling. The fans may or may not work. Most of the items on the menu are unavailable most of the time. That leaves precious few items to order since the menu itself has been severely cut short in recent years.The cramped interiors literally turn into a furnace every afternoon. DO NOT SIT AND EAT. Takeaway is the only option. Service is one thing which is still nice and despite long queues, wait time is negligible. Prices are still less than what you'd expect.
The food, I must say with extreme regret is forgettable. Nice but nothing out of the ordinary. The large sizes of the chaap items notwithstanding, the taste can be called average at best. The Chicken Fry we had could have been from anywhere in the city. The Mutton Kasha still blows your mind. :) 

Chakraborty Tip : I would have rated the place 2.5 . But I'll give the .5  points as grace for serving as a landmark both in geographic as well as gastronomical senses for the people of our city.

"Experiencing Golbari's Kosha Mangsho".....I guess that gotta be on every bengali's to-do-list !! A friend of mine- shocked at the fact that I hadn't tried this institution yet- accompanied me here. The place needs no introduction really....the irresistible smell of the kosha mangsho fills the air! We ordered two plates of the Mutton Kosha.....served with parathas......which arrived pretty fast. It was deliciously dark....really liked the taste ! Yes, its oily....and probably a bit too spicy for some people....but that wasn't a concern for me. The real concern was the quality of the mutton.....it was way too tough. And not being in a mood to literally struggle with my food....I couldn't really finish it. :( Which is sad, since the taste really was great. Haven't gone back since as I'm unsure of the way things will turn out. So, 3.5 stars for now. :)

I am a long standing fan of this place but the recent visit has really shaken my faith. The legendary mutton kasha which was so succulent and the gravy so delicious has been reduced to rubber like taste with huge amounts of oil rolling around. The parathas have reduced in quality greatly. The mutton was so hard that the ones I had taken away to home was exposed to a round on the pressure cooker before serving. Request the owners to forget the legends and concentrate again on giving food lovers like us reasons to come back here. Time and again.

P.S. The sympathy I experienced were for the people standing in the line to sit and eat. Hope they get the original taste back very soon.

This was my third time visit to Golbari. I was utterly disappointed this time, Golbari's legendary Kosha Mangsho used to be the benchmark at its field. I was extremely surprised to see this worst quality of foods here.The mutton was sub standard, semi cooked, tasted really bad. Parathas were cold and hard to tear.I believe consistent quality should be one of the defining characteristics of a heritage restaurant like Golbari.So my humble request to authority to please focus on to help people to say Golbari is the pride of North Kolkata.

Mutton Kosha is special for most of the Bongs, and I am no exception. But even though I wanted to give Golbari a visit, so many times earlier, the plans kept getting cancelled for some reason or the other. But during this year's Puja, I was adamant on visiting Golbari, and on Saptami, I along with a friend of mine visited Golbari. We were quite lucky to get a seat pretty quickly. 
I ordered a mutton kosha while my friend opted for the chicken kosha. From what I have read and heard about Golbari, I had quite a clear picture of what I was in for. And Golbari didn't disappoint me. The mutton was perfectly spiced. And oily. But that shouldn't be a concern, when the dish in question in mutton kosha, and the occasion is Puja. Also loved their pickle which they served along with the salad.
The chicken however which my friend ordered was a major letdown. It was nowhere near a kosha. So I would definitely advise against trying chicken at Golbari. The mutton however is a must for any foodie.
And be prepared to stand in a long queue if you are unlucky, and want to dine in, or opt for parcel.

parathas were as oil dipped as ever, chunks of mutton in orangish oil: this is what i experienced in this place.
the place is small, very small, no doubt, but that is not an excuse for such bad food. i had heard a lot about the place and expected the food to be good, but i was disappointed. 
may be the chicken kasha would have been a better option. 
its not a place i would like to revisit.

I hate people who are snobbish about this place. I get it that the food here is too spicy for some, too oily for others, beyond the understanding of most. But that does not give you the right to trash golbaari's kosha mangsho!
Hysterics aside, I am a slave for the mutton keema kosha. With parota, pickled peyaaj and tears in your eyes (jhaal is awesome! period!), there are very few things in the world I love more than this! 
Not for the faint-hearted, the weak-buds, the health-tards!
Come to this place only if you dare to experience gastronomic heaven!

Golbari one of the oldest restaurant which caters to typical Bengali cuisine especially the famous kasha mangsho. The restaurant came into the limelight when it it had slightly modernized the traditional spicy mutton kasha. This place enjoys its position. Located at the famous five point crossing of buzzing Shyambazar this joint has fed many honorary people.
They have opened up with great varieties of dishes like the spicy keema and liver. But one which everyone looks for is the kasha mangsho. Though these days I found the piece to be a bit stiff but the taste still remains the same. The paratha which they serve with this dish is quite good. Its thin and soft and goes quite well with the dish. People cry they laugh but still they don't get bored of having their favorite spicy dish. Its a legacy and I hope it continues better.

Disappointment was all i got out of this place. The huge popularity of the place had infused a desire in me to visit the place for long. Wish I had ignored it!!!
The semi cooked foul-odoured mutton chunks dipped in nothing but oil is what is passed as mutton kosha in this place. parathas were noy done properly.
The only reason the place still had its head held high is because of the reputation it had earned in its yester years owing to the hard work and sincerity of the then-owners. The present owner is merely living on the works if his forefathers,contributing nothing further and thus leading to such degradation of what is referred to as one of yhe heritage eating houses of the city.

I live in RG Kar medical College....which,as many of you know.....is a five minute walking distance from shyambazar 5 point crossing,with its golbari. Yet,i went there just twice in 2.5 years.
I went there first because i had heard of it from every old foodie.But the mutton kosha failed to deliver.They add too much ginger to it,its frightfully heavy and you have to struggle to chew the meat.In fact,i'd rate the tamarind chutney better!
the space is cramped,and hot,since the cooking area is just adjacent to it.
The second time i went was to order takeaway to bring the kosha mutton to my home,at durgapur!
Even my family failed to appreciate the greatness!
yet one of those old icons beginning to collapse.

Born and brought up in South Kolkata and living near the Southern Avenue Sarat Bose Road crossing I have seen the new food street of Kolkata develop right before my eyes which has now sort of become the name any cuisine and get it area that too of top notch quality. But the food and the restaurants of North Kolkata has its own flavour and charm. Of all these restaurants Golbari has a name of its own and has almost become fable like. Hearing innumerable stories and accolades about its kosha mangsho it has for long topped my list. Whenever north of central metro station I always look for opportunities to somehow convince my friends of taking the pains of accompanying me but it has always fallen through. Finally last saturday I went laptop hunting in Chadni Chowk and luckily I wrapped up my work early there and headed to shyambazaar. A very small shop and manned by 3 persons the place was buzzing with people vying for there share of kosha mangsho and paratha. Braving the crowd I ordered a plate each of kosha mangsho and mutton keema and decided to pack it( the dine in is too small and always loaded with people). Priced at 123 bucks each both the dishes were worth the money. The kosha was an oily spicy affair but undoubtedly lip-smacking. The keema looked and tasted same as the kosha but was laden with minced meat. I found the keema more to my liking cause the four pieces of meat that I got in the kosha had more bone than meat and the meat was a tad undercooked. But given all that my greatest satisfaction was to see my Dad's face light up who amidst his paitents, clinic and medicine had nearly forgotten the taste of golbari and with it his most cherished and treasured memories of college!!

I really don't understand why some people keep saying that Golbari has lost it's old glory.
I went to this place for the first time nearly 5-6 years back with my girlfriend. She gave me a memorable treat here.
I re-visited this place a month back with one of my colleagues and had their famous Kosha Mangsho with paratha. It was delicious and mouth-watering. Loved the Mutton Curry here however if you are a health maniac or avoid oily food then their food can scare the hell out of you. Also, I think they must improve the sitting arrangement here. The place was too stuffy and crowded (just what I saw the last time). If you are a Bengali, and live in Kolkata... you must visit this place at least once in your life.

Mutton kasha and their special ruti and imli chutney, give it to somebody in front of a suicidally depressed person, yes, surely it's a medicine for him and after having this, he'll come out of the depression because there is new meaning to live in Kolkata for him and that's the food of Golbari. Very crammed a place, but, don't bother, 80% of their customers are take aways. Already in hall of fame.

Lip Smacking Kosha Mangsho 

Kosha Mangsho stands for Juicy mutton chucks cooked in rich medium paste gravy with hot bengali spices.

Golbari is a landmark in Kolkata and in terms of food... the kosha mutton is superb... i can eat as long as my tummy allows.... value for money proposition and a real treat to youself.

Do you know what it feels like to hear great words from you parents, grandparents, family about one place for a long long time, so much that you start riding an imaginary food-balloon, and once you've actually been there, it pops?

I've heard my parents say a hundred times, "Golbari r kosha mangsho.. orokom ar kothao khaini"! Once I was all grown up, thought I'd go see what the fuss is all about..  Now I've been there 5 times.. And I wonder, do they change their chef every fortnight or something? One day, I get this juicy, beautiful piece of mutton, and next day I wish I had fifty teeth to chew it with! What's wrong with them?

This place is too famous already to describe.. It's situated at the ground floor of circular-shaped building, that's why the name 'Gol Bari'.. It's an institution, a place our dads and grandads swears by.. And you do get a feel like that when you enter this place.. Tiny, too tiny is the word.. You cannot even sit comfortably.. Imagine 20 people in a 10X10 room eating oil n curry off their hands while they juggle with backpacks to make room for another person.. Too much for one plate of kosha mangsho, isn't it?

Now, you must be thinking, "Alright, I could still manage if the food is worth it", right? I thought so too.. But it's not.. 'Kosha' mangsho is way too oily, could be seriously dangerous for weak-hearted.. The thick red gravy looks sinful though, and it tastes just fine, nothing extraordinary! Mutton Keema is okayish, though I think it's rarely ordered.. I haven't really seen much people eating anything but Paratha n Kosha Mangsho.. They also serve Mutton and Chicken liver, but haven't tried those..

Their Paratha is surprisingly good.. It's unlike something you've ever had.. Half a paratha n half a roti, that's the closest I can get towards describing it.. It's light, and somewhat balances the super-rich mutton.. And they serve a special tamarind Chutney with it.. It's wonderful.. Perfectly bittersweet, it leaves a tang in your mouth!

Their Mangsher Chop is good, got a nice stuffing, Cutlet not so much..

I am disappointed.. But yet, I would tell you to definitely go visit this place.. It's too famous a place not to try even once! :)

A rainy afternoon & I am right there at Bagbazar , I realized it was the perfect time to try the lionized cuisines of GOLBARI Shyam Bazar. It is not fancy , it is basically a small eatery where you’ll find some of the most famous Bengali dishes and a variety of snacks too . You wouldn’t want to come here expecting ambiance and decor, you might even have to wait for a few minutes before you get a place to sit . Therefore I would suggest people to take away their orders .
Golbari has over the years become synonymous with mutton kasha and it is still basking in that previous glory although the taste has suffered deterioration.  Most of the things I tried were average in taste but definitely not bad.
Conclusion :  The place serves tasty food but nothing here is extraordinary to drag you down to the place again and again. But looking at the legendary popularity of this place you should visit and form you own opinion .

One of the good things being born as a Bengali is the definitive inbuild desire and craving to eat and there are very few in this world who can actually be a judge of good and tasty food. Golbari, though has lost the touch and the hype that it created in the mid '90s, still has the basic touches of being one of the heritages and veterans in preparing that awestrucking and delicious liver curry. Golbari famously as well as infamously known in Kolkata for that spicey "Kosha Mangsho" that instantly revokes your gustatory sweat is one of the best and cheapest places to eat in North Kolkata if you want to fill your stomach as well as heart to the brim. A must visit to all the foodies around who loves to eat.....and don't forget to carry an antacid...

Old things are always in good repute but this place at present is in disfavor. I had heard great stories about this old eating joint, stories that made me anticipate that the famous kosha mangsho of golbari should never be missed. But I was utterly disappointed, to say the least. The smell is brilliant and intoxicating, and you are sure to get it from a distance but the food to the contrary is very sub- standard. Its very oily, very spicy and yet tastes bad. The quality of the mutton is also very poor and you need all your effort to tear it. The parathas are there to add to the oil as well. The place is cramped but I wouldn't have issues against it if they could make good food. But since that is not the case it adds up to the negative as well. Golbari used to be Kolkata's landmark and pride but now it should be sited as "historical places to visit in Kolkata" and not as a brilliant food joint. I understand some people might have memories related with this place but my opinion is strictly regarding the food, since I am still in my twenty's and have only a bad memory of Golbari.

I am a real foodie, and have been travelling across Kolkata just to explore its diverse cuisine, and even since I had started to experience the North Kolkata food scenario, Golbari (now named New Punjabi Hotel) has appeared as a monument of North Kolkata's timeless culinary genius. For some unfortunate incidents I've not been able to have a meal there till a few days ago, when I had a chance. As I was travelling with a friend who didn't have mutton, I was not able to taste the signature Mutton Kasha, instead we settled for the Chicken Masala, which was appalling.  The chicken was well cooked, but the gravy simply uneatable. The much hyped paratha was stone cold and hard, the interiors of the eatery had chairs resembling those in nursery school, and just 2-3 fans in the dining area, not enough to relieve the visitors from the searing heat from the open kitchen. The manager didn't seem very helpful, but rather arrogant and unhelpful. My first visit to Golbari left me with a very sad impression.

first of all most people will not like it. especially people looking out for healthy food or a place to sit and eat. it's not a diner. but Golbari is a Calcutta institution.
real foodies would swear by it. mutton kasha and paratha are it's signature dishes. I have been there a hundred times I am sure but I don't even know what they sell. I once asked my dad, granddad, uncles..... no one knew for over 60 years people from my house have been having the kasha mutton......
there is a small place to eat.... don't bother too much just enjoy the heavenly... oily... slightly spongy but distinct mutton.

The best way to explain "reflex action" is to mention kosha mangsho of Golbari.  !!! Instantly we can feel our mouth watering... :P

kosha mangsho with Paratha is the famous item of golbari. The taste of mutton gravy is awesome and goes great with the parathas. The oil / fat on the kosha mangsho plate cannot go unnoticed. Health freaks are not recommended for this place. :P 

We cannot comment on the ambiance of this place, since its a small eatery. Best take-away joint for mutton lovers.

their was no points needed for ambience...only you can see people eating mutton with close eyes like they are feeling heaven through this....
i remember how bad we felt when we heard the news about its closing...
as i live in extreme south of the city,and due to my busy schedule i dont get a chance to go there,but im sure whenever i get a chance,i will visit this restaurant again...
P.S.-1.when u are eating such a delicacy,dont think about your cholesterol level...

The actual name of this place is New Punjabi Hotel which is famous as Golbari.
Its a very small eatery, so you need to keep off your inhibitions about ambience and decor before visiting this place.

The 'Kosha Mangsho' here is actually been a tradition for ages. You wont get mutton on thrusdays,so remember the day before visiting if you r a mutton-lover!
The Kosha Mangsho and the Paratha are actually awesome, but what is worth killing for is the chutney they give with the mutton. The tamarind chutney is brilliant with no sweet added. Its just sour and salt and its awesome!

Also tried the mutton chop and egg chop.. quite good.

Muttons are still tender but the quality of the gravy is not as tasty as before( u will know it if u had it a few years back) The pricetag makes me wonder about the hype, the price does make this eatery overhyped, but the food is great at the end of the day. Ambiance is jolly, but does not reflect the prices of the dishes. So nothing to complaint about except the price. "golbarir proshidhho kosha mangsho" is still "proshidhho".

Its called the New Punjabi Hotel.

The place is now more of a historic place to the people of Kolkata. Dont go by the interiors and the size. The place is very clumsy and small. But heaven what food do they serve.

The kosha mangsho is power packed with flavour and juice of the tender mutton. Its a MUST TRY over there. The next best thing is the liver curry. The gravy is of a thick onion base cooked for a really long time. This makes the meat tender. Also you can try the cutlets and the chops. Its better to make a parcel and have at home.

N.B : After the meal is over it is advised to have a digestive tablet like digene, gelusil or pudin hara...

To me, the sight of Netaji surmounted on the horse alongwith the sensation of burning lips(owing to the spicy Kasha Khashir Mangsho), and of the tang in the tongue(owing to the chutney), is one of those moments that make me love my life.......... And Shyambazaar's Golbari gives me just that!!!.... Still one of Kolkata's major eateries, the Golbari needs no introduction to any Bong... 

Although it is now but a shadow of what it used to be in the past(My dad tells me that, I don't know how it all tasted thirty years ago.... I wasn't even born then.. :P), I still find it a great place to grab a bite....

As a critic, I would advice you to, rather, take the food home and eat there(the actual dining area is quite crammy and unpleasant to the ambiance-conscious)... Otherwise, I don't see how positively different could the food have been, thirty years ago....

I don't see any other place in it's vicinity that offers heaven-to-your-taste-buds at less than 200 bucks!!!!....

I wanted to give a negative rating, but there is no such provision here. Their famous Kosha Mangsho is definitely the worst kosha mangsho I've ever had. The almost-black colored mutton pieces are impossible to tear, forget chewing. and the taste isn't good as well. but if you still want to try out Golbari, do go for a take-away, cause the sitting ambiance isn't decent either.

Once upon a time the Kosha mangsho was really great . But my recent experience was horrible. Not a single piece was chewable because of not properly boiled mutton to make it soft and full of bones. Actually I had to leave mostly on my plate when finished eating. 
                 I had this Kosha mangsho in ARSALAN too which was much better and healthier compared to one in Golbari.

one of my favourites. u can swear on their famous mutton kasha clubbed with the extremely cheap but highly tasty paratha. the chutney served is also great. the chicken kasha is not as good as its mutton counterpart. but expect to wait a lot to get a seat(not table but just a seat). it's better to pack your food. the prices have gone a bit highly lately. the worst thing is they are keeping themselves closed at times. the position is great. you can't miss the crowded place situated at shyambajar paanch mathar more. also, try their fish fry. it's cheaper and tasty.

If your first priority is ambiance and service please do not visit this place (and also most of the famous Calcutta eateries). If you appreciate good ambiance and service but are foodie enough to compromise on them sometimes just for food, lets progress.

Food

Their menu have other items too, but they are known for the Kosha Mangsho. The gravy is unique and awesome. the chutney served with it is great. The parathas are excellent. Actually they are something between a roti and a paratha. Not too oily or too dry. But the problem is with the main component. One day you will get the softest meat and the very next day you can have hard time chewing it. The third option is of getting boney pieces. But if its your lucky day, you will remember the dish for a long long time.

Ambiance

The place is small so be prepared to wait during peak hours. Service is fast but the behavior is rude.

*** Actual name of this restaurant is New Punjabi Hotel and it is famous as Golbari

This place should in everyone's list. This is a heritage restaurant or should I call it like a makeshift dhaba where I have eaten so have my father and grandfathers its that old. Ones it was shut down for a long period of time which broke my heart thinking what about golbarir mangsho now but it reopened after a few months. Yes this is just not the place to sit and dine cause it is very tiny and narrow and the service is poor too, what I would suggest is take the food away the kosha mangsho (mutton) and paratha its lip smaking. just awesome

Golbari is nothing but carrying the shadow of it's name. I personally never care for the environment, when it comes for the great food. But the speciality of Golbari, i.e. Kosha Mangso is unfortunately too tasteless. The mutton pieces are too hard to chew.Tadka is okay. If you want to have Kosha mangso in Golbari style. Go to "Koshe Kosha" in Hatibagan.

Mutton and Gol Bari seems to be synonymous to the People of Kolkata..

I was suggested this place by a lot of my colleagues, so last weekend I went to the famed New Punjabi Hotel..
Firstly this is a roadside eatery, so dont expect to find a Punjabi Themed restaurant...it's small , dingy and very very crowded(had to wait 15 mins to be serviced)..
The Service is as you would expect in a place like this : Loud and Fast!!
Oooh but the food!!...The Kosha Mangsho was a sublime gastronomical delight to say the least..and the huge Rotis are soft and delicious!!
They also serve some types of Chicken Curry ,some Mutton keema Preparations and some types of Chops....will surely try those the next time I go. 

A must visit spot for any foodie in Kolakata, you wont be disappointed.

The Place is very easy to locate, just go down to Shyambazar 5 point and ask anyone there where Gol Bari is, everyone knows where it is..

And the best of all the place is dirt Cheap will cost you 400 Bucks max for 2 people with good appetites..

Well, to begin with, this place is called new punjabi hotel. 

The Kosha Mangsho here is actually been a tradition for ages. Like most small time roadside places, please leave your inhibitions behind when you come here and focus on the food ONLY. 

The Mangsho and the Paratha are awesome, but what is worth killing for is the chutney they give with the mutton. The tamarind chutney is brilliant. 
Also a must have, are the Fish Chops and the Egg Chops. 
Quite an important part of kolkata history, a must visit.

When you go to the 5 point crossing you must get the smell of the mutton kassa.Yeah,it is very good with the paratha.But,unfortunately all other menu are average.The scarcity of place and the dirty environment are the few drawbacks which are to be corrected.

It is just the name which works and pulls crowds now..The famous Golbarir kosha mangsho is okayish..black as it is supposed to be,but with oil floating on all sides as it is not supposed to happen.The mutton keema is a bit better tastewise. The chicken curry is average. One single piece of chicken in yogurt based yellow curry.The rotis are actually probably paranthas. And if you dine in there they serve it with a tamarind chutney. However given that the place is small and dingy take away is the best option.
The other food available are the fries-and the chicken and mutton cutlets and the chicken and mutton chop is actually good here. So instead of going for the over hyped kosha mangso try these light bites.

Golbaari....a well-known place for all non-veg human....who love the maangsho and ruti!....The smell of kosha maangsho can pull you toward this place whenever you are at Shyambazar 5-point crossing. This has become a heritage for a bengali foodie like me. Whenever you are at North Kolkata , don't forget to eat bengali's favourite food Koshaa Mangsho and Ruti at cheapest of prices.

It was sadly nothing like it used to be. You might go there for North Kolkata heritage, but that's about it. The Kosha Mangsho is not bad, but nothing extra ordinary.

Not a place where you would want to sit & eat. Not a place for a no-mutton person like me, & from what I have heard the quality of the Mutton Kasha has degraded, the chicken items are nothing more than average, though the price is high...the Tadka is good & the rotis are unique & can be better called parathas which goes well with the Tadka.

Gol Bari is a landmark and very famous once upon a time. But recently it is not up to the mark. There are only some seats. Food quality is gradually decreasing. Although it is famous for the kasha mangsho but now its taste bad. There are many famous indian dishes but u cant find them tasteful. Black mutton kosha and mutton keema are not tasty. Rotis are very oily.. Prices are increasing and quality is decreasing. Overall below average.

It was pride of north kolkata and now its just a landmark.

The mutton kosha is soft,but the pieces are too small.The curry is just oil and crushed onions and chili. Plus it seems unhygenic also.
the place is soo small that dine in is not at all an option.you have to opt for take away.
The parathas are rotis soaked in oil. I heard a lot from my parents about the food,but as far i have tasted i did not like the food much.it's just an average.

but dissapointingly when i did.. i could not make out whats with it being so very famous !! pardon me but i have had far more delicious kasha mangsho then which i had at golbari!! its not that its bad!it is tasty but.. when u see the oil floating above the pieces of mutton.. i really felt like ehhh that's something i should nt opt for!! thats infact not called kasha!! the meaning of kasha is not oil floating every where!!  and to top it off .. whats with the parathas? or rotis? or whatever they are??????????????? a real dissapointing place!! may be it was great once upon a time.. but its no more now!! atleast to me!

although it was very famous once upon a time but now degraded to a mediocre restaurant, only about 10 seats are there , take away is the best option.. food quality is just average, their speciality is the spicy black mutton curry which has become tasteless now, keema curry is like minced meat floating in oil, rotis are like parathas,very oily,overall not a place to visit for foodies..

Shyambazar Gol Bari is not only a restaurant but has become a landmark over the decades. Its been operating for ages and has a healthy number of followers that includes my parents. However it has been revamped over the last couple of years while trying to compete with the competitors around. Gol Bari is mainly famous for the Kosha Mangsho and the Mutton Keema, though over the years various other items have also been invented. On the other hand, its not a place where you would like to dine in as it is small and dingy, take away is mostly the option. The Kosha Mangsho preparation is rich with spices and is bathed in oil, so if you are health conscious then it might give you the creeps. Not something you can have every week (though am sure there are many who would oppose to this statement!!!). Prices have gone up over the years and the food quality not so much. Can be tried for the heritage value and to boast among friends if you are not from north kolkata, otherwise, don't bother.

Gol Bari offers a very compact menu of Bengali dishes. Gol Bari is famous for it's Kosha Mangsho, a (very) spicy mutton preparation.

I personally feel that their Mutton Keema, a mince meat preparation, is currently their best item. It follows almost the same recipe as the Kosha but the meat is more tender in this case. The Kosha Mangsho has deteriorated  over the years and to get really hard chewy pieces of meat has become a regular occurrence.

Both these trademark dishes go well with the roti they offer. I strongly recommend the Mutton/chicken chop at Gol Bari, it is the underdog over here, overshadowed by the main course dishes. I almost forgot to mention that both the Kosha and the Keema are unusually black in colour but that's because of  the spices that go into it or probably caramelized onions in sugar. 

The service is decently quick but the place is uncomfortably small. Not exactly the place for the family to eat together.

Go, for the Keema, Mutton/chicken Chop.
Avoid, the Kosha Mangsho .
