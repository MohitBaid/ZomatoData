The best part that I like is the service. The people here are very polite and make you feel special. I have ordered their Biriyani and I loved it a lot. Its delicious.

I was kind of disappointed with a little delayed delivery (even though they have informed me that before taking the order) but their food compensated for it. The Chinese flavors were just authentic. I think it's better than some big names as well. I had ordered fish and rice. The fish was fresh and full of flavors. I strongly recommend paro's Kitchen.

I am a very big foodie. I have nearly tried all the joints in and around Kasba. I find this one to be a little haatke. They called me for a feedback and also gave me a discount coupon for my next order. None of the other places nearby has ever done this. I had their biriyani and I was happy. It is pocket friendly and stomach friendly as well.

I love their biriyani. it is much better than a lot of other places nearby. Less oily and good taste. I have also tried their chineese and its good. They always deliver on time.

They delivered in just 35-40 mins. I had ordered pan fried fish, manchurian chicken and veg fried rice. The quantity and taste both were great. I will order again.
