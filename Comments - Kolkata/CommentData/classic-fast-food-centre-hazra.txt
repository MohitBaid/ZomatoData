A small roadside eatery, in sadananda road, Hazra. No sitting arrangements, so take away is the only option. Very ordinary by looks but you will be surprised when you will taste their biryani. One word 'Delicious'. Well cooked ,  a perfect blend of spice, aroma and taste. This place is really cheap. Don't know how they manage to serve this quality and quantity in such a low price.

It's a famous road side joint for Biriyani at an unbelievable low price located at Hazra.

Untidy ambience with very simple ambience.

Service is quick.

Tried Mutton Biriyani and Chicken Chaap at a busy afternoon, when I was hungry. Biriyani to my surprise was quiet nice, well cooked and flavourful. Meat pieces were also standard.
Chicken Chaap was tasty with nice gravy. 

Realy unexpected at such a cheap price.

Classic Fast Food Centre is a street side eatery mainly for Biriyanis at an unbelievable low price. This is located at Hazra.

Shabby place with zero ambience.

Tried Chicken Biriyani, which was nice, bit oily , aromatic and was sufficient in quantity. Meat pieces were tender too. Though one cannot compare this place 's biriyani with that of Arsalan , Aminia etc.but still biriyani was nicely made here at such a low price which is the USP of this place.

This is a small outlet more like a road side outlet for biryanis. The biryani is quite ordinary but the price is very cheap. One of the cheapest biryani you will get in Kolkata.

একদম রাস্তার ধারে , পাস দিয়ে যাওয়ার পথে উঁকি মেরে যেতে পারেন কারন এর থেকে কম দামে কলকাতায় বিরিয়ানি পাওয়া সম্ভব বলে মনে হয় না । আর পাওয়া গেলেও সেটা চিকেন বা মাটান কোন টাই হবে  না এইটুকু বলা যেতেই পারে। পকেট হালকা থাকলে আর পেট কে ঘণ্টা তিনেক এর জন্য রেহাই দিতে হলে চোখ বন্ধ করে আসা যেতে পারে ।

Mostly a roadside stalls, their USP are Biryanis. The pricing here is super cheap and unless someone is gaga over Arsalan or Aminia, this place is simply a staler at the prices these guys offer.

I visited this place on the recommendation of a friend of mine. But their Biryani disappointed me. It was very oily and spicy and meat was very tough. It is mainly a takeaway joint. Though their price is moderate( a half plate cost 50  full plate 100) but I wasn't satisfied with the quality of the food.

This is yet another super duper cheap biryani joint located near JD Park Metro (this place is right next to tufani biryani). The facilities and items offered by both tufani and classic are similar. However, given an option I prefer tufani. 

Nevertheless, the food here is almost as good, and given the similar prices, you may give it a try anytime you are in the area. Rs.50 for a plate of biryani is still something that I cannot wrap my head around. Thank you Kolkata, for places like these!
