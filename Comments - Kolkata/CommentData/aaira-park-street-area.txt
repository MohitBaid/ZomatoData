Over rated reviews. Seeing the high reviews, i ordered Murgh Mughlai and Tandoori roti. The roti was very chewy, and the murgh mughlai was full of coconut cream and the quantity wasn't enough to finish 4 rotis. Rates are very expensive than the taste and quantity of food.

I had my first of January lunch here. The best part being, they have Bira on the menu and they serve it too unlike most places in Kolkata. The hyderabadi biryani is really good.

Aaira-located beside KFC park Street,serves one of the best mughlai cuisine.
Had ordered murgh jahangiri shorbe,Pahari machli,garlic naan,sadaa chawal,daal panch mela,murgh lazeez tikka masala,fresh lime soda & gulab jamun. Also tried the white wine 🥂🥂 for a change of flavour.
The ambience & the music are very soothing.They maintain a quite handsome quantity.The staffs are very courteous and attended upon the customers very nicely. It is a must go place for food lovers especially-mughlai cuisine.
Must try dish-pahari machli-pure bhetki was served,once u put the fish into your mouth it just melts in mouth and one can feel the taste of spices mixed with the fish.

Aaira was in the wish list for long, finally decided to check it out on Christmas. Located just opposite to Peter Cat, the Ambience of Aaira is what your eye snaps as soon as you step out of the elevator. Very well decorated beautiful interiors, candlelight and soothing music sums up your dinner date at Aaira, obviously along with good food.

Food:
•Murgh Rozali Kebab: One of the signature dishes of Aaira, and a must try. Minced pieces of chicken cooked with tandoori spices with a lot of cheese stuffed within. I felt the cheese melting and relishing all over my taste buds on the very first bite. Goes very well with a pint of beer.

•Onion cheese and chilly Kulcha: It was like a sea breeze. One of the best Kulchas I have had in recent past. Taste of Kulcha mainly depends upon the calibration of the dough, and that’s what makes Kulcha different from Naan. The difference between Kulcha & Naan is that Kulcha is leavened with baking powder and soda, whereas yeast is used in the preparation of Naan. At Aaira, they are careful enough in maintaining the quality.

•Kashmiri Naan: To those who are not acquainted with Kashmiri Naan, the dough is stuffed with rich filling of badaam and cashew. Tastes a bit sweet with enriching taste of almonds, goes really well with all sorts of gravy items. Try this with Daal Makhmali.

•Raraah Gosth: Minced pieces of mutton cooked with rich Indian spices. Sweet sour and tangy; I found all the three taste in the gravy blended perfectly. Perfect as the main course. Tastes like heaven with Cheese Kulcha.

•Lucknowi Biriyani: Aromatic rice cooked with rich pieces of mutton, didn’t find it special. I didn’t like it much because of the strong smell of cardamom, maybe it wasn’t my day for Biriyani.

Price:
Bill came around ₹1800/- for two.


0.5 deducted for late service, but it was the night of Christmas hence totally understandable. The staffs are really nice and gives attention to every guest equally. A family with two kids was seated in the table next to me, and as we all know how gentle kids are when taken taken to restaurants 😂 But the manager was gentle and calm enough to ‘em all throughout with a smiling face. Hence definitely Kid-friendly.

If you wish to spend some quality time with your loved ones or family members with delectable dishes served on the plate, Aaira is your call.

Highly recommended.

Ordered online (Zomato) for its famous Chicken Hyd Biryani! Biryani was nice. It has the subtle aroma of Zafraan, a hint of curd, cilantro, slight tomatoes and the hyd. masala paste. The rice was regular long and almost perfectly cooked. Almost. If you are searching for a good Hyd Biryani in Kolkata, then this could be an option. Chicken pieces were boneless and sufficient. Overall 3.5/5 for taste and 4/5 for quantity. 

As a member of Zomato, I was also supposed to get a hot chocolate brownie with ice cream. Well they forgot the chocolate sauce and ice cream to send along. It was just the good old brownie, warmed in a microwave! However no points cut for that! It was free, what else can I ask!

This place was in our wishlist since a long time and finally we visited here today to have our christmas dinner.
Firstly,we were totally amazed with their ambience.
Beautiful interiors,candlelight and good music is just perfect for a menorable romantic dinner.
Now coming to the food,we loved each and every item we had.
•From christmas special menu,we took a Cajun rubbed Turkey breast stuffed with sausages.This was just cooked to perfection and the sauce tasted great.Also,the mashed potatoes that came with it just tasted out of the world.

•Next,we had their famous murgh hyderabadi biryani and this is probably one of the best biryanis we ever had.The biryani had a strong smell of saffron and if someone does not like smell of saffron they may not find their biryani as amazing as we did.But for us it was lip smacking.It came with papad and raita.

•We also had their Mumtaz tangdi kebab though we wanted to try their potli kebab but it was unavailable today.But the tangdi kebab just tasted out of the world.It had a nice soothing flavour of lemongrass.

•We had a fresh lime soda from drink section and it was refreshing.

This staffs are well behaved but the service is kind of sluggish which was the only drawback.
We had a nice time here and we definitely recommend this place.

If you are from Delhi and going by seeing 4.4 rating then don't go and if still go then don't order "dahi ke sholey/kabab". Food is just fine. So pricey for the taste they offer. Ambience and location is fine nothing great. Average experience place and should be rated around 3 max.

We went there for our second anniversary...Easy to locate as it is at a stones throw distance from Peter cat. The lobby is very well decorated and Aaira is on the first floor of the building(The Myx).
The decor is subtle and soothing.
The staff was friendly and courteous.
Since we bought a coupon.. The menu was limited.
We started with the mocktail...We were disappointed when we only got 2 options to choose from : Fresh lime juice or blue lagoon..We chose the later.
Then we ordered murg jahangiri shorba...It was a pale yellow soup with diced chicken pieces at the bottom.
It was good..3.5/5
Then for the starter we had Aaira speciality Pahari Machli...It is bhetki fish marinated with indian herbs with tandoori spices..It was soft and delicious.possibly the best we had from the menu...5/5.
For the main course we ordered Murg Afsha, Pulao, Dalma and butter naan.
By the time we had half naan we already felt full..e underestimated the quantity.
Murg Afsha 4/5...had lots of chicken chunks.
Pulao had veggies with fresh paneer pieces...5/5.
Dalma was a bad choice from our end..as it was not going well either the rice or butter naan...though it was good...3.5/5.
And at last we had gulab jamun...It was yummy...4.5/5.
Complementary meetha pan completed the meal for us.
The staff member samanto was very helpful and friendly and gave a chocolate stick to our baby.
We would love to visit Aaira again to try other delicacies offered by them, especially their mutton preparation and potli fish biryani.

The food was good. The proportions are good too. We ordered a variety of foods. Just that Biriyani was not upto our Bengali standards. Otherwise rest was good. It is pocket friendly also. I will recommend it for a romantic outing or family dinner outing.

Staffs are very well behaved and service is unexpctdly fast. We have orderd pahari machli and raan-e-aaira as starters. Frankly speakng the mutton prep was just awsm in taste and the quantity is huge with solid boneless(90%) pcs of mutton.pahari machli is also good with mint flavrd kabab of vetki. Then we orderd benarasi pulao and muuton afreen. Though we were about to full aftr havng the starters we tasted some amount of pulao and mutton main course and packd it the rest.

So me & my fiance wanted to have dinner nearby esplanade..so our first choice is to go anywhere in park street as most of the zomato high rated restaurants are there only. This place particularly unknown to me, and when I found out that it is featured under romantic restaurants..we thought of giving it a try. And we must admit it was a great food experience.

First of all the ambience & decoration was just marvellous. The golden walls with minimal lighting give a royal feel. The marbel top table with a comfy high back cushion chair is just like one located in any royal palace. Plus they have comfy velvet sofas for leisurly seating. All the staffs are dressed in kurta and Nehru coat just apt with the inner decoration.

Come to food we first order captain Morgan. They have all type of drinks from mocktails, basic juices to beer & other alcoholic variants divided in desi & bideshi sub heading. Then we ask the staff for their middle spicy chiken kabab to go with it & what they serve was al Ayaan e murgh kabab which was freakingly good. It is moist, spicy, and had a egg like coating on top of it. Also they serve three coloured chutneys to go with. That resembles the colour of our flag & I found it kind a unique.

Then in main course, we had Hyderabadi murgh biryani with chiken peshwari. The chicken pieces are boneless in peshwari and it also come with white omlette garnished. The gravy was thick and medium spicy. Biryani has a half boiled egg & shredded piece of chicken. It is full masaledar and satisfy our taste bud fully. With this, they served complimentary 3 pieces of papad, onion sliced & small round type seperately, achaar, mirch & raita. For me, raita with biryani is necessary but in most of the restaurants we have to order it seperately and the quantity is more than enough . So wasted at last. But here, the amount is just right for having with biryani & complimentary which is great.

By now we are so full and late that we drop the idea of having dessert there. But they really have amazing dishes under this section...most of them are like two to three type together as a dish. In kulfi i guess they have different flavours for different day as indicated the menu card. They do serve two pieces of pan for us with the bill which again different and right ending to our dinner.

The price is in a higher side. But all other restaurants charge more or less same in parkstreet so we are okay. The staffs are very curtious and attentive. They happily help us choosing the right kebab & side dish. Also the place was less crowded with three tables booked including us. But we quite like it as appropriate for a romantic dinner. Best suited for couple or family dinner.

So on a whole we spend a good food time

Its a late review. This place is located just beside park street kfc and it offers some lipsmacking north Indian cuisine..We ordered chicken rosali kebabs for starters as suggested by the staffs. In the main course we had chicken peshawari, butter nuns and biriyani.. For dessert it was baked cheesecake with mini gulab jamun and pineapple rabri. Prices are on the higher side however the food especially the dessert was mindblowing. Service and ambience are good too.

Hey guys. Writing a review after a long time. But with a very positive feedback for AAIRA. Visited very recently and I must agree, though not so popular as other restaurants in park street, but the Food here is surely to catch your tongue (just kidding). This place serves north indian and mughal cuisines and very different from other restaurants of this genre. The items go very well with their names and taste. It's worth a try and also economical to satisfy your hunger. The hospitality of the staffs will make you feel good but might be a lil disappointed with the speed. But when it comes to good food, it's worth the wait.

We visited this place on the weekends, bt it was not crowded.
Ambience is good with dim lighted settings. We ordered murgh rozali kebab as starter fish potli biriyani and mutton rogan josh as main course and hot gulab jamun with icecream.
The starter keeps you wanting more and more.
Fish potli biriyani was good. The biriyani was filled inside a dough I suppose . And the mutton was cooked to perfection.
But the dessert was not value for money.
We wanted to taste the baked mihidana with yoghurt and rabri but they informed us that it will take 20 mins to prepare. We were in hurry so had to settle for the gulab jamuns with ice cream.

Had specifically mentioned multiple times that the food needs to  be non-spicy. The starters came with green chillies,  the main course was not palatable due to heavy spices.  Even the yellow dal was extremely spicy.  The servers had no answer for this,  the manager suggested he will get fresh order made - after an hour of wait we had no patience to wait any longer.  Am sure will never go back to this restaurant.... How about you

Aaira is one the best Mughlai cuisine restaurant in the Park Street Area with great ambience premium sofa and soft music on background adds extra feelings. The restaurant is fully decorated with ancient painting which is attractive.

Ordered Tandoori Shahi Aloo it was very different flavoured it was served with three type of chutneys Green chutney, Ginger garlic, mango chutney the flavour of the curd within the chutney is easily noticeable.

Paneer Makhani was not up to the mark I found it sweet and less in taste. Dal tarka was good in taste and assorted breads basket was sufficient soft & crunchy…..roasted papad was served complimentary…on price side its expensive but it’s a first class restaurant with a first class level

To be honest, on 1 fine Saturday afternoon, I tried my luck by visiting Petercat at around 1.30PM, and saw the similar picture... long queue and waiting time of around 45mins.
Now that made me try this amazing place.... so indirectly... thanks to Petercat..!!  

To keep things simple and to the point... Its basically an amazing place either for a romantic lunch/dinner or even with friends & family.
Great hospitality and fabulous ambiance..!!
We tasted only a few items as we were running short of time... but all 3 of them were in adequate quantities and lip smacking as well..!!
We tried - Murgh Nurani Kebab, Kashmiri Naan & Hyderabadi Murgh Biriyani.
Not only the Murgh Nurani Kebab tasted good... it looked amazing as well..!!
Moreover while we were leaving the place they gave us Banarasi Pan which was badly needed after such delicious lunch..!!

Looking forward
 to our next visit already...  so much more to taste..!

Went for a group dinner with a customised menu which consisted of hara bhara kebab, panir taftan, chicken Tikka and fish kebab as starters. Special mention for the fish kebab which was extremely soft, juicy and flavorful. The creamy marinade was perfectly grilled and it was melt in mouth. Hint of ajwain and Kali mirch made experience heavenly...
The mains had a spread of peas pulao, assorted indian breads, dal makahni, panir, veg jhal frezi, chicken curry and tawa fish. Salads, papad, chutneys as accompaniments followed by brownie and vanilla ice cream. Only high point in the mains was the assorted breads...exquisitely done, soft but not mushy, crunchy but not friable...rest are run of the mill...all curries tasted same, looks same...
Brownie was ok....paired with vanilla ice cream it was a sure shot, could  have been better with additional chocolate sauce.....
Ambience is excellent, service very good...

Located in the first floor of Myx building, Aaira had been on my wishlist since quite a long time which is famous for its Indian and Mughlai dishes. The Ambience is soothing with romantic music in the background. The food is divine and the staff here behaves professionally. Serivice is a bit slow otherwise, it would have been a 5 star. Potli Fish Biriyani is a must try. Strongly Recommended. :)

Located just opp to peter cat, it is in the myx building, in the ground floor. The ambience is nice, food was really upto the mark. For the starters it is recommended to have murgh rosali kebab, for the main course we had butter naan, chicken peshawari which had an egg over it in the form of a cloud, and for the dessert we had gulab jamun cheese cake with rabdi. The main course was amazing. The quantity was huge. The best part was the dessert. A must visit for all indian food lovers.

Had little or no clue about this gem of a restaurant until my friend had insisted me to try this out. This exquisitely decorated eatery with very attentive personnel offers some flavorsome mughlai dishes.

¬Murgh Rozali Kebab - high on tandoor spices. The chicken is very soft and stuffed with cheesy fillings. You get in house sauce along with it.
¬Lucknowi Gosht Biriyani - get ready to be absolutely smitten. Perfect awadhi flavor and aroma. The meat is just so tender. Quantity is enough to be shared by two.
¬Murgh Peshawari - it has a very distinct flavor. Not very spicy yet rich in taste. Chicken pieces are grilled which gives the curry a slightly smoky flavor.
¬Zatar Paratha and Masala Kulcha are very well prepared. Size is pretty decent.
¬Paneer Makhani has a thick creamy gravy. It's a bit sweet. Have this with their Naans or parathas.
¬Banarasi Polao is very very tempting. The fragrant basmati rice is made exotic with drizzle of ghee, saffron and dry fruits.

The staff never fail to give you warmth with their polite gesture and frequent enquiry about the food. You will be delighted to get those complimentary 'Banarasi Pans ' along with the bill.
The price is thoroughly justified considering the taste, quantity and the fine dine experience.

I was drawn to this place by the high rating on Zomato and experiencing first hand what this restaurant has to offer, I can say that such ratings are fully justified.
The decor of this place is classy and the soft music they play in the background adds to the mood. I had the chance to try the raan, the dal makhni, the butter naan and the Lucknowi Biryani. Everything tasted great. The mutton was fall off the bone and melt in the mouth soft, the daal and biryani intensely flavorful with the right blend of spices. The portions were very generous too. Also the service was efficient throughout. Considering everything, the food, ambiance, service and the price, this is one of the best North Indian restaurant in the city. Essentially one is getting near five star quality at 1/3 the cost. I recommend this place very highly.

Located in Myx building, 1st floor diagonally opposite Peter Cat, park street. To be more precise, it is located beside KFC, Park Street. Aaira had been on my wish list since a long time. The ambiance is dim lit and they focus more on the Mughlai and Indian cuisine. It is quite spacious and is perfect for a dinner time with family or a date. Nonetheless, i had come to Aaira for Blogger’s meet. We were a group of 5-6 people and had a pre set menu to taste.

Located on the first floor of The Myx in Park Street, this pretty restaurant is famous for serving mouthwatering Indian and Mughlai dishes.
Though dimly lit, the place is quite spacious and holds a small bar as well.

Hopping onto the food, for starters we were served Tandoori Babycorn and Birbal Batata. The babycorns were generously marinated and tasted soooo good. Moving onto the Main Course, the dishes served were Bharwan Shimla Mirch, Lazeez Paneer Masala, Dal Makhmali, Kashmiri Naan, Subz Biryani, along with Papad and Salad. The Bharwan Shimla Mirch was lip-smacking and so was the Dal Makhmali. The Kashmiri Naan was very well prepared and went along nicely with the curries. The Subz Biryani had a great aroma to it and was very flavourful. Not many places in Calcutta serve Vegetarian Biryani as good as this. The food was quite filling but we loved every bite of it. 
This was followed up with some Gulab Jamun and Hot Chocolate Brownie for desserts. The Gulab Jamun was amazing, and so was the hot chocolate brownie.

Overall our experience at Aaira was overwhelming and one to cherish. The service was impeccable and the food was of the best quality. The staff were very humble and warm, as  you would expect at a high-end place like this.

If you are looking for a calm, not so typical, Indian restaurant in Park Street, Aaira is the place to be. With rich creamy sides to spicy succulent kebabs, this place serves the purpose of satisfying your hunger and mood to the optimum level and sends you back home, happy.

The soothing interior along with comfortable seating gets brownie points.

Must try: 
1) The seekh kebab
2) Kashmiri Naan
3) Dal Makhani (this should be on the top)

People' smokes in front gate of the restaurant
Which according to me is not good gesture.
Perhaps no restrictions is made on them.
Coming to the ambience it is unsourced class apart.
Next coming to the food. Sabzi were amazing but unfortunately the bread lacked the taste.
Naan were not crisp enough, stuffed kulcha were not properly stuffed! 
Maybe that was my bad day of not getting good food for a perfect ending of the day!

This place was in my bucketlist for a long time but ups and downs of life wasn't giving me chances. Finally it did on Tuesday evening me and my buddy #MukulPrasad the philosopher the saint and I got to visit this place for dinner. It was raining and I craved for Beer Heineken it was simple. He opted for a fruit drink mocktail. As it arrived we had a long chat and I kept admiring the interiors of this place magnificent. But the problem was The waiters are not well trained their casual behavior is just ridiculous. They often were confusing us seemed they are themselves confused. In order to keep our sanity we remained quiet. 
But when we got to taste the food it was brilliant. I mean best Chicken Makhani and Masala Kulcha I've ever had. Mukul had Roomali Rotis which were huge in size. 
In the end we ordered for hot gulab jamun and vanilla icecream. 
Sweet Pan was given to us complimentary. It was a nice experience

Aaira is located at the first floor of MYX, beside KFC and opposite of Peter cat. You get a royal feel once you enter the restaurant, cozy sofas, dim light and ghazals playing in the background. We went on a Sunday for lunch. We ordered Mumtaz tangdi- which had stuffed chicken keema inside a chicken leg and grilled to perfection. Then we ordered Lucknowi biriyani which came with raita and salad and it was served in a handi. for side dish we took raraah mutton which was quiet spicy as well as tasty. Overall a nice experience but a little overpriced.

'Aaira',..a lesser known place which serves authentic mughlai cuisine.
First coming to the location,its situated just opposite to the Peter Cat,and beside Park street kfc.Interior is good and so the ambience.We ordered their signature dishes like Fish Potli Biryani,Chigari jingha,Ran-e-aaira,Lucknow gosht biryani,and Murg peshwari.Potli fish biryani,I loved their presentation..and THE STUFF INSIDE THE POTLI! Spicy yet non oily biryani with succulent fishes makes me drool even at midnight(while Im adding this review ;) )..Lucknow Biryani was not bad.Ran-e-Aaira is a must try together with Fish biryani.Courteous staffs with Quick serving time,and price according to the quality and taste of food will surely drag me there again..

Me and my friends visited this place few days ago. Its in the first floor in the myx building. The ambience will strike you instantly as soon as you enter the place. Dim lights,fountains, ghazal playing in the background, comfortable cushioned chairs.❤
We ordered Fish Potli Biriyani, Lucknow Biriyani and Murgh Rozali Kabab. The kababs were yummy. Melted cheese loaded inside. It was heavy too.😍
Then came the biriyanis. We had high expectations on their fish potli biriyani so decided to leave it for the last as its their speciality. Hence had the Lucknow biriyani. It was really tasty. Mutton chunks were there. And the amount was huge. Literally huge. 😊 
Next was the potli biriyani. It was covered with a coating of roti which was looking very beautiful. Chunks of fishes inside. But trust me it was below average. The smell of fish wasn't good and the masala wasn't upto the mark. They should have used some other fish and of better quality too. Hence, we were disappointed in this one. Amount was huge. But taste was 👎
Bill was bit on the higher side. The behaviour of the waiters were good enough. They even served mitha paan in the end which I loved. 😁 
Overall I liked the place. Might visit again to try their side dishes with naan.

This restaurant is located at The Myx in Park Street just beside KFC. It is an authentic North Indian restaurant. The interior looks sophisticated and a class apart. The service is very good and the staff are easily approachable. 
I went with my family to celebrate my graduation. We ordered Murgh Rozali Kebab for starters. The kebabs had boneless chicken pieces stuffed with cheese and Indian spices served with onions and garnished with a red rose. The presentation is A class. It tasted so good that I wanted to repeat the order. The cheese and the juicy chicken complimented each other. Then we ordered Methi Paratha and Laccha paratha. Both the parathas were really good to taste. For the main course, we had Murgh Peshawari which had tender chicken pieces cooked in Indian spices and served in a very unique manner. The meat dish was covered with foam which was my first time at any restaurant. It has scrambled eggs too. Overall, the dish is a must try. Then we ordered for Murgh Afsa which is a chicken dish consisting of small chicken pieces with rich brown gravy and cooked with spinach and eggs. The dish was a little spicy and the blend was perfect. The parathas and the chicken dishes were a perfect match. For desserts, we had mini gulab jamun with baked cheesecake and pineapple rabri. The dish was presented well. The cheesecake was soft and topped with mini gulab jamuns and the cake was stuffed with pineapple flavoured rabri. My sweet tooth was satisfied. 
The ambience is top notch, service very good, food is commendable, the presentation is classy, the quantity and quality gets full marks and the price, though a little on the higher side is nothing in comparison to the delicious food. Highly recommended from my side.

We went here for a special lunch towards the end of the previous year.
The interior is impressive. It reeks of the typical traditional restaurant aura.
We ordered Murgh Alishan for starters. It was too spicy for my personal taste, but I loved it nonetheless!

For main course, we ordered Dabba Gosht, Masala Kulcha and Kashmiri Naan.

The Dabba Gosht was the best dish we had that day!!! The quantity was impressive, and the taste was just perfect. The Kashmiri Naan failed to leave a mark, but the Kulcha again was very tasty.

My friend insisted on ordering the 'Baked Mihidana with a layer of Yoghurt and Kesaria Rabdi', and though I personally dislike Mihidana, I found the taste to be okay-ish. The yoghurt did spoil the taste, but it was bearable.

Sayz...this place is situated in Myx at Park Street, near Peter Cat. I went there with my partner and few friends for dinner. This place opens after 7pm for dinner. When we went inside the place it had a great ambience. The environment was lovely and romantic with soft music, I just loved it. Getting back to food first ordered one Mumtaz Tangri Kebab, one Aachari Machli Kebab and one Nawabi Seekh Dilbahar. The food was delicious. Very soft and very juicy as it should have been. We just couldn't stop licking our fingers. After that we ordered two types of Biryani, one Lucknawi Gost and Hyderabadi Murg Biryani. We wanted to experiment with Biryani and believe me we were not at all disappointed. It was different but too good. Alcohol is also served here. The staff is very good and polite. We all had a great experience and I am definitely coming back here. My ratings are below -

Been planning to visit Aaira since I first learned of it's existence (on Zomato). This plan finally came to fruition in January of this year

The restaurant's decor is classy, without overdoing the whole Nawaabi theme. If I remember correctly, a pleasant music was being played softly in the backgrounds (can't be more specific since my knowledge of music is nil). The servers were all courteous & efficient.

Coming to the main business-the food. We ordered Mili Jhuli Rotiyan, Murgh Afsha, Mutton Afreen, Mumtaz Tangdi & Lucknowi Gosth Biriyani. The bread basket was nice- with a broad selection of different types of bread, some of them tasted quite unique. Murgh Afsha & Mutton Afreen both were very nice. The Tangdi tasted ...interesting, the lemongrass combined with chicken to create a unique flavor. To be honest, I am not really sure to this day, whether I can say I liked it or not. But it was sure memorable. I personally didn't taste the Lucknowi Biriyani, but the others in the group liked it.

Serving portions for all the dishes were good. In fact all three of us were filled up, & even then a decent amount of Biriyani was left over, which we packed & took home as a parcel.

This is one of those places which gives you a royal treatment with its prompt and courteous service, regal decorations, huge couches and an ambience created by the dim yellow lights and the golden hues on the walls. We had ordered for Raan-e-Aaira, Dabba Ghosht, Masala Kulcha and Garlic Naan. Both the mutton dishes were very delicious where the mutton pieces were soft and the amounts were good. Although the prices may strike a little too high, the taste and the amounts will leave you satisfied. 
However, the naans and kulchas were too less for Rs75 each. The Masala Kulcha was very thinly stuffed and the Garlic Naan had a strong smell of garlic but it lacked the flavour and texture of a naan. It tasted more like a normal, white roti. They gave paan at the end of the course which were sweet, juicy and quite like the Banarasi paan.

Visited this place last night with family. I could only try the vegetarian dishes as my parents are vegetarians. :( 

This place is located in the lane after Flurys in the Myx Building on the first floor. Very easy to locate. The ambiance is so nice, soft music playing in the background, dim yellow lights, the perfect place for a family outing. 

The service is prompt and really nice. The servers are very courteous. Our food came pretty quickly also but the fact that we went on a weekday might be the reason for this. 

Coming to the food, we ordered Vegetable Chilli Mili Kebab and Kurkure Paneer for the starters. Loved the Kebab a lot, it was very different flavoured. Kurkure Paneer was okayish. They also gave two other dips apart from the usual green chutney! 

For the main course, we wanted something spicy so we ordered the Vegetable Kolapuri. It was yummy and cooked very well. The Dal Makhmali was also nice but nothing extraordinary. Special mention for the Lachcha Paratha. It was crispy and just the way Lachcha Paratha should be! 

I really liked this place and will come again to try out the other dishes, especially the mutton and chicken ones!

This restaurant, being a heaven for kebab lovers. All the dishes were mouth-watering. The starters ordered were two Kabab dishes and one Fish dish. They were worth the money and time. The main course included Butter nun and a side dish of chicken. They were amazing as well. You are served a  Mitha paan at last. Ambience was wow. Staff members were even very soft and decent. Prices being on a bit higher side,  but the quantity served is pretty good.Over all, a must visit place.

There are only a few gems like Aaira which take you to food heaven.A much awaited and planned treat finaly landed me in this beautifully decorated place inside The Myxx.We seated ourselves on one of the tables tastefully laid out.The decor is quite indo western with a soulful track playing in the background.The servers were prompt and well versed with the menu.After much debate we settled for their speciality Murgh rozali kebab in starters .The chicken was stuffed with melted cheese which was then coated with tandoori spices and prepared in clay oven.The smell of the melted cheese mixed with a earthy scent of the clay oven gave the kebab a subtle taste which was not too overpowering for the palate.Next came the masala kulcha and the gosht kalimiri.Thw kulcha was heavily stuffed with spices but was soft as i took a bite dippin the rich lamb gravy with tender chunks of meat.The gravy was in itself quite a sensation and would be my personal recommendations for all foodies.Finaly we dig ourselves into the fragrant bowl of Lucknowi gosht biriyani living upto its name.The light and aromatic rice with chunks of lamb pieces ,egg and alooo makes it quite a wholesome plate in itself.With no place for dessert we decided to come back as soon as possible.Great job team Aaira.

Been here on May 23rd. First floor or MYX lounge. Booked my table via Zomato. We had Rann-e-aira which is a starter sufficient for 3. A spicy leg piece of mutton. Lucknow gosth biriyani might disappoint you if you expect a kolkata style biriyani like Arsalan or Aminia. It's Lucknow style, li'l sweet with several small pieces of mutton. Rara mutton also​ accompanied biriyani. If I had to consider food only it would be 3.5 but ambience, professionalism, service boosted it up to 4.

Visited this place for dinner with a friend. And was bowled over by the ambiance. The music they play in the background is just so awesome. Coming to the food , we had ordered the aira mixed non-veg platter - A Meal in itself. Each item was cooked to perfection. Also tried the "Potli" biriyani but cant say I am a fan though. The interiors are tastefully done. A perfect venue for  small get together with family and friends.

And did I mention, the washroom is rather spacious, clean and well done up compared to most other restaurants in the area :P

The decor is beautiful with really comfortable high back chairs. If you are in a mood to pamper yourself by North Indian food, definitely pay a visit. I had murgh rozali kebab which was spicy and tasty. Cheese lovers can order that.  Also try the onion chilli and cheese kulcha it's delicious. It can with any main course.

This restaurant is a lovely place. It is situated on the first floor of the Myx. It is in the same place of saurav's. As you enter the restaurant you feel good and it gives you a whole Indian feel. Decor is amazing and seating is also spacious. 

We were offered a place near the bar which had low light and which I personally like less. The service was slow. It seemed as if there was only one guy to take the orders and that was creating all the problems. 

We ordered veg platter for starter which came in after a long time. For the main course we ordered their special dal and Paneer Makhani. For the breads we ordered Tandoori Roti missi roti and Chili roti. Even all this came after quite some time. I liked the missi roti and my wife liked the Chili roti. The food was simply awesome. The dishes and the breads are all wonderful. For the desert we ordered brownie with hot chocolate and ice cream and it was delicious too. The meetha paan after dinner was a surprise and we all loved to savour it.

All in all it is a must visit for all North Indian food lovers. Highly recommended by me. 

IMPORTANT - Please note it is said this place has a wallet parking but it is half truth. What happens is when u arrive u hand over your car keys and they park the vehicle somewhere in the nearby street. On return u r given the keys and told where in the street is the vehicle parked. And u take the keys and go hunt ur car. In our case even the marking was wrong and we searched the whole place and had to come back only to be told that it was a mistake and that the car is parked near the church. So not exactly Wallet Parking.

Elected from a large selection by only seeing the ambiance as it attracted our mind to be. It's situated in the heart of the city, so location is faboulous. When we stepped in it made us amazed bcz environment was more than the digital one we had seen. We took Murgh shorba from the soup, Afgani murgh Kabab from the starter, Bhuna ghost, benarasi pulao, dal panchmela, nan from the main course. Each n every item was soo spicy and tasty as well. So they have kept their standards of foods in comparison to their ambiance. And lastly dessert made our taste more sweeter. Mostly you won't believe we went through nearbuy and we got all these items at a jaw dropping price i.e. 799 for two (tax incl.). So I'd request you to never let it go. I'll recommend everyone to have there soon. 
Cz if you're late,
Your opportunity won't wait.
So hurry up n make an astounding memories with your beloved ones.

The Myx: Aaira, centrally located at Park Street opposite of Peter Cat 
We ordered MURGH ROZALI KEBAB, MURGH ALISHAN, LUCKNOWI GOSTH BIRIYANI and MUTTON ROGANJOSH.
The starters were so light and subtle that just writing about it makes my mouth water. The food were freshly made and has its own authentic indian style. 
The ambience of the restaurant is classy and relaxed.
The staff was very helpful in offering suggestions on what to eat and how.
I will surely visit again.

Aaira is Located on the 1st floor of the Myx building. Once the elevator door opens you see the restaurant. The first thing i noticed was the dim lighting. Even if the chairs and the couches were pretty mi couldnt enjoy the ambiance because of such a dim lighting. However the food is amazing.
What i liked...
▪️The murg malai kebab. Very tender and yummy. Recommended. 
▪️The chello kebab was another favourite. They also served a bowl of daal with it. 
▪️The dal makhani,a personal favourite of mine. 
The food took a bit of time to come but once the started arrived the mains quickly followed. 
Special mention to the paan that they serve after your meal is done.

One of the best restaurants i have visited. Staff is courteous and well behaved. The ambience is truly amazing. I would recommend the dal makhmali..the mili jhuli rotiyaan.. which has 5 varieties of rotis
..rumali.. naan.. missi roti.. laccha paratha and masala  kulcha.. 2 each. Another side dish..was Murgh afsa which was really delicious..along with fish potli biriyani. 
The best part is the meetha paan they serve at the end.. 
I loved the place. and would highly recommend it.

A very nice and memorable experience.. Yes that is what i am going to say. The place is nice with a well decor and quite friendly staffs. The food was good although a bit pricey. We tried sula satori wine, murgh rozali kabab, butter naan, murgh lazeez tikka masala and kulfi. The tastes were good however the kulfi was a bit overpriced. However what sets it apart is that they celebrate your birthday. I went there with my friend who was having her birthday today. after filling up the feedback form they brought in a cake and played birthday songs. Dont know whether other restaurants do it but it surely made the day memorable since it was the first time with us.

Located just opposite to Peter Cat- yes it can give a tough competition in mughlai cuisines. It was my birthday lunch and it exceeded all my expectations. If you wanna try some lip smacking juicy fish kababs grilled to perfection in clay pot this place is a must try. The kababs were so good that we tried two of their signature dishes in a go. Now coming to main course we had cheese naan (will melt in your mouth) and kashmiri naan(another wow one) with peshwari chicken. Now there was some thing very special about the chicken dish-It was topped with baked egg white. The staffs were very courteous and friendly.
Now coming to money matters its a bit costly but believe me you wouldnot regret spending those money on a fine dining like this.

Food: They have signature style of cooking n presenting kebabs. Lemon chiken potli was awesome. Raan-e mutton kebab preparation was not good. But the staff was cooperative enough to understand this and made the order change.
Ambience: Calm and cozy, perfect for a sober dinner with family and friend.

Located just opposite to Petercat. Ambience is pretty good. Food was unique and very delicious. Achari fish was awesome.  Also the fish potli biriyani was a nice concept though not as delicious as other dishes. Got complementary baked papad and pan. Drink is bit on the costlier end. Overall, very good.

Very good fine dine restaurant. It is a little expensive which is probably why you can get tables even on a busy weekend.
Ambience is serene. Mild music. Dim lights good service. 
Mutton Rogan Josh is a  must have. We ordered one but couldn't stop at one. It's an huge (a little expensive) and delicious goat meat dish.
Great place if you want to take your girl out on a romantic date or if you want to celebrate your parents' anniversary.

Of all the Mughlai cuisine presenters in the City of Joy, Aaira would certainly come up among the top most ones. Had a family lunch there and the experience overall was high on the feel-good-scale.
The restaurant is situated on the 3rd floor of the Hotel Myx just adjacent to the Park street KFC. The ambience is "regal" to suffice in one word...the premium decor is accentuated by colourful wall paintings, cosy sofas and chairs. The Ghazals playing in the background further elevates the atmosphere.
We started our food fiesta with "Raan-e-Aaira " as starter...Baby mutton leg with Chef's special sauce... it was succulent, delicious and naturally raised the bar of our expectations.
The main course was comprised of Banarasi pulao with naan and lachha paratha...all of which were well prepared.
We tried the "Murgh Lazeez tikka masala" (tender chicken pieces cooked in thick tomato gravy) which was palatable and able to stimulate our taste buds perfectly. The "Tawa fish" (fish cooked with brown gravy) however was nothing exceptional.
Their desserts menu (Meethe Sapne) is pretty wide and awesome. We tried "Hot gulab jamun with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce". The item was scintillating...the soft sweet with the hot sauce and cold cream was indeed able to bring about a feeling a pure bliss.
All of the above items (for 5 people) cost us approx. Rs. 3200 inclusive of all taxes which, I agree, is definitely on the higher side. Although the ambience and the chef's expertise almost made up for it.
Service is a bit slow...and they added 5% Service charge (apart from service tax) without informing us beforehand, which was a let-down as far as I am concerned.
Looking forward to a gastronomically more rewarding visit in the near future.

We got 2 soups, a starter, main course including a dal, vegetables and bread and a dessert all of our choice for just 700. The food was awesome and totally with the money.

Located on the Myx building , thus restaurant is located at the third floor. Little hyped though , but the  food is good and also economical. The special lucknow biriyani has a huge quantity so ordering one will suffice for 2 people easily. We had also ordered reshmi kabab as starter but the quantity seemed to be too low. The interior is very regular. Your company will give you the major part of enjoyment.

This place deserves a 5 rating. We went for a lunch there after the zomato reviews. It's just besides the parkstreet kfc, myx. Located on the 1st floor of the building. The place was dimly lit though everything was clearly visible.. the time we visited it was almost empty. So, no to queing for a sunday lunch. The decor has a posh touch with well furnished sofas and chairs. Ordered after inspecting through the menu.. 

Murgh rozali kebab: the presentation of this dish is superb. It looks like half eggs. Quantity is more than enough for 2 people. Cheesy inside and spicy chicken outside! The showstopper starter.
Lucknowyi gosht biryani: to my wonders it taste the exact same as i had in lucknow. Amazing... shredded pieces of mutton.. with spices and flavoured rice. True mughal affair!
Chello kebab platter: the butter rice was perfect. They served a dip with the chello platter. It was also amazing.liked it.
Baked mihidana with rabri: last but not the least this was toooo good...

Will definitely visit again. The staffs were very courteous. Loved the place.

Aaira is one of the Mughlai Cuisine destination at Park St area. Been there few days ago with one of my friend. We were looking some good place for Indian or Mughlai cuisine near Park St area at Zomato and the name Aaira came, at the top. So after looking some review on Zomato, we decided to take a trip to this restaurant.

Location – Aaira located at the first floor of Hotel MYX, opposite of Peter Cat and besides of KFC. There are different cuisine restaurant at each floor of Hotel MYX and the Mughlai cuisine restaurant is named as Aaira.

Ambiance and decoration – You get a premium feel as you enter the restaurant. Cozy sofa and chair, dim lighting and old hindi songs and gazal in background adds extra feelings. The restaurant is fully decorated with ancient Mughal painting which is really eye catching.

Management and services – As you enter the restaurant, you get a warm reception from the stuffs. After sitting they will provide you wet towel, to clean your hand and mouth. All the stuffs are highly trained, polite and suggestive about the food also.

Food – As we were craving for Mughlai food, so we ordered Murgh Resmi Kebab as an starter, Lucknowi Gosth Biriniyani as our main dish, Murgh Afsha as an side dish and Kesar pesta kulfi as a desserts. Ginger Ale and Lime soda were taken as an drinks.

Murgh Reshmi Kebab – It was really amazing as a starter. 8pieces of chicken were there and served in a pretty way. Love the presentation. This dish was not like traditional Reshmi kebab. It was round molded chicken pieces with cheese and butter filling from inside. The chicken pieces were full juicy and tender in nature and the cheese filling easily melt in your mouth. It was one of the best Reshmi Kebab, I’ve ever tried. The kebab were served with 3 different types of chutney, e.g – Green chutney (Old tradional chutney), Ginger garlic chutney (Spicy feels) and mango chutney (Awesome in one word).All of them are super cool and tasty. The flavor of the curd within the chutney is really noticeable. Highly recommended.

Lucknowi Gosth Biriyani – It came in a big stainless steel handi and served with two pieces of papad, onion and raita. Two pieces mutton were there. The rice were very well cooked and the spices are all added in right portion. Not so oily in nature, overall good. The raita, which was served along with biriyani was also good. Quantity is enough for two persons. Try  it, if are a fan of biriyani like me.

Murgh Afsha – 6 pieces boneless chicken served with brown curry, spinach on top. It is one of the Chef’s special item here. The dish was spicy but not so heavily spicy. It was served in a spoon like container, with spinach paste and cream on top. Good presentation. Chicken pieces were soft, juicy and tender and the item goes well with the biriyani.

Kesar Pista Kulfi – Two pieces kulfi were served in a bowl with lots of faluda and chutney. The portion of Kesar is also noticeable. Tastes really good but too much costly with respect to quantity.

With all the item mentioned above, it cost 2.1K INR inclusive of all taxes which seems to be a bitter high. So in conclusion, I will say that Aaira is one the best Mughlai cuisine restaurant in the Park Street Area. Little bit of costly but if you see the food quality and the other stuffs, you can easily visit it. Overall a good dining experiences from me.

The lift opens inside the restaurant, ambience is royal. The greeting is with a refreshing towel. For starters we ordered a Birbal Batata (flavourful potato dish) and a veg cutlet (which can easily be given a miss). 
For mains, we ordered a Keema Veg along with Ajwaini Paratha and Zatar Parathas. Both the parathas were very good, melted in the mouth. Had a Subz Biryani as well which again was an aromatic delight. Would like to congratulate Aaira on the complimentary munchies that they served: roasted papad, onion rinds, extra biryani raita and to end it, a meetha paan after the meal! 

Thank you for the delightful experience

Beautiful place, cozy and comfortable, a very good option for dining. Food is excellent. Service is really good. Worth the price. I visited this place on the 25th of December it was packed crowd but still their service was up to the mark. My friend and I ordered butter nun and their famous chicken with cheese coat, n beer. The combination was amazing. Budget friendly.

If you're thinking about delicious mouthwatering north Indian cuisines then this is exactly the right place for you to be in. Decor is good eye catching and the ambience is great. Food is completely brilliant, all those flavours blended together gives you the extreme pleasure that you never ever even felt before. Aira's  special kebab platter is brilliant and something more than brilliant is the smoky flavour which gives that platter an extraordinarily exceptional kick in taste, kashmiri nun, garlic nun, red-chilli roti is really good, mutton afreen and chicken peshawari is really tastes heavenly, something out of this world and biriyani is also very good.
Service is great, food is fresh and proper hygiene has maintained .Value for money is okay, I'll not say costly but something little more than reasonable.
In conclusion, I'll definitely say that they're good follower of Total Quality Management (TQM) & Customer Relationship Management(CRM) and should continue the same in the long-run as well.

This is a restaurant that is resplendent in its decor. A very regal ambience greets you as you step in. 
The service was good. We had raan e aaira for starters. Tenderly cooked mutton leg which melts in your mouth,served with a naan...a plate suffices for two.
We ordered their iconic fish potli biryani and kashmiri naan paired with peshawari murgh and rogan josh. The naan was two sweet for my taste,but the biryani passed my list of criteria for good biryani with flying colours.
The chicken was excellent, the rogan josh okayish. The three of us had a hard time finishing so much food.
A big thumbs up to the cook for decidedly good food.

The place being opposite to Peter Cat is easy to locate and as you enter the place , you are guided very well to the restraunt. Let's come to the point one by one.
Ambience was perfectly fine and soothing , one feels calm compose and relaxed.
Food was nicely presented and tasted pretty well even.
Service was even upto the mark , but the only thing questionable was the waiter keep staring at us constantly , as if we don't belong to this planet 😂
All in together , a must visit place.

I decided to celebrate my birthday in Aaira and it was the best decision.
The place is located in the Myx building opposite Peter cat.  When you enter the restaurant you are immediately transported to a soothing royal ambiance. 
The servers are very cordial and good.The only con is that they take a long time to serve the food.
We had ordered a chicken tengri kebab which had a stuffing  of mutton keema.
It was mouth watering and rich in flavours.
The biriyani and the chicken peshwari was extremely  tasty and on point.
This place is exactly what it promises to be.
Surely a reccomendation. :)

An awesome afternoon spent with sumptuous lunch and mesmerizing environment.

I visited this place last Saturday for lunch with my special one. At the time of reservation, I had asked about two wheeler parking space which they confirmed that they had, yet on reaching I found out that the parking space was the road outside amidst the filthy drain passing by the road and constant discharges from birds sitting above on the trees.

The saddening feeling went away completely after reaching the main restaurant. The ambiance of the place and the courteous staff made me forget everything. With the waiters helping you by serving the food every time, and not constant nagging you for further orders, I found them pretty good. They kept an eye when to clear off the finished plates and do that instantly.

The complimentary paan at the end of the meal was so good, I really wanted to ask for another one.

Well, overall this restaurant is a must visit, provided you don't go on a two wheeler.

This place was in my check list for a long time. Finally went there today for lunch. Located just beside KFC, Park Street opposite to Peter Cat, Aaira is on the first floor of The Myx.
The decor was soothing. Dimly lit but cannot be called dull. Very comfortable sitting arrangements. The music was also soft and classy.
The staff serving us was well behaved and poliete.
Coming to food. We ordered Murgh Mozali kebab which was a little spicy for my taste and Fish potli biriyani which was delicious. The quantity of both the dishes were great.
Slightly priced but the experience is worth it.
Had a splendid time there.

The ambience is nice especially we have been there on valentines night, so a candle light theme was there.. food was also delicious, we have ordered chicken razoli kabab which was pretty good. Especially the salad comes with it. The main course was not so great but good. I am giving 3.5 because of the wait time(which is very very long) we were starving- then we asked manager for food again after 50 mins then they served.

Regal decor, soothing music and excellent food! Aaira is certainly one of the better fine dine places I've been to in Kolkata. And I would definitely recommend you to visit this place for a romantic date or a Family/Friends dinner - its an ideal place to spend a quality evening.

We visited Aaira on the evening of Valentine's Day around 8.30pm. And as expected, the place was full and we had to wait for 15-20 minutes before getting a table. One couldn't help but notice and appreciate the ambiance of this place. Dimly lit place in color Red to suit the occasion coupled with romantic tracks of Arijit Singh set the mood perfect for the evening! After the brief wait, we were guided to a candle-lit table with a plush sofa with cushions and regal chairs - giving it a royal touch! We were quite mesmerized with the setting this restaurant provided and were happy with our choice to celebrate the occasion here.

Service was excellent as well! One may say it is slightly slow, but that is exactly what I was looking for from them. It never felt like there was any rush and we thoroughly enjoyed the two and half hours that we spent there. The staff was helpful and friendly.

For starters, we had Birbal Batata and Vegetable Chilli Milli. Both of these are must try starters! And are rightly so marked as Chef's specials. 
Birbal Batata is fried tiny baby potatoes served in a fried papad bowl topped with a spicy masala and salad dressing. The quantity was good, and yet I couldn't have enough of it!
Vegetable Chilli Milli is egg-shaped kebabs of vegetables with a cheese filling inside and are crispy fried. They sure were crisp and filling...I loved the cheesy filling inside! Quantity served is 4 pieces, but each one is quite filling!

In main course we had Veg Jaipuri and Dal Makhmali - both Chef's specials, along with Onion Chili Cheese Kulcha and Rumali Roti.
Veg Jaipuri is a dry sabzi, mix of several vegetables with carrots, cabbage and beans the dominant ones along with crushed Papad. Medium spicy to taste, and different than the usual paneer sabzis...I liked it!
Dal makhmali is their version of Dal Makhni, and the major difference being that it was sweeter. Well cooked and thick in texture, it was delicious!
I was disappointed with the Kulcha and rumali roti. The Kulcha gave the flavor of just onions, the chilli and cheese seemed missing. Also, the Rumali roti was not as much Rumali as it was crisp. They both should have been better.

For desserts, we had Valentine's day special red velvet cake with frosted cream. It was average, not great. I would have it sweeter and less drier. It didn't really melt in your mouth like the really good red velvet cakes do!

And to finish it all, they gave Meetha Paan and Choco@late dipped strawberry - both of which were splendid! 

Overall, it was really great fine-dine experience with not being too heavy on the pocket either. Thank you Aaira for a wonderful experience! :-)

Visited this place with family on 9th feb,2017.It was pretty easy to locate via google map.The Myx building looks pretty cool.The lift was too small  I felt.Anyway that can be neglected.The Aaira ambience was nice,the decor was beautiful.Its not a very huge place so its a little congested.I won't call the place romantic in that sense since one can't feel that calmness.The service was a total disappointment,we were not served the water.We had to ask them for it.That left a bad impression at the first instance.We ordered for rozali kebab,murg alishan as starters.For the main course we ordered the potli fish biriyani,gosht biriyani,rogan josh,raraah gosht,butter naan.As desert we ordered the aaira rainbow.The starters really startled me,they were just perfect!!The potli fish biriyani looked delicious but did not meet upto my expectation.Te side dishes were mind blowing.The biriyani had good flavour but not very strong smell and therefore one can eat a good amount.The quantity served was pretty good.They gave papad and raita and onions complimentary which I liked.The desert had a lot of cream,I wish it had a bit more of fruits specially peaches and strawberries.Overall if you are a foodie do visit this place.They serve awesome food and best part its tasty yet like the home food,it won't make you feel sick even if overfilled.Its just the food that took my heart away.The prices were a thumbs up for me.

Located in the 1st floor of Myx...i went for dinner here after seeing its ratings on zomato and have also heard about food. Loved the food but  service was bad. They committed on giving a discount which they did not while making the bill. We didn't argue on the saame but it wasnt expected. Service was also lil slow. 

Coming to the food:
#cheesy paneer tikka- loved it. Paneer was super soft. Taste also was good. 
#dahi kebab- tasty. Liked the noodle wrapped on it before frying. 
#paneer makhmali- we tried another starter of paneer. Taste was okay but quality of paneer was too good. 
#tomato dhania shorba- hot and good
#mulligatawny soup- perfect
#fruity cooler- okayish
#strawberry shake- could have been better
#dal makhmali- very tasty
#pindi chana- delicious 
#peas pulao-light and tstt
#assorted breads- good. Loved the misis roti
 Looked very fresh and was very well made. 
#miloni sabji- needs improvement
 Was bad
#paneer butter masala - good

Overall good. Staff could be more cordial

Aaira invites you into it's intimate ambience to savour it's warm hospitality and lip-smacking tandoor dishes which lingers on till the very end.
-The tandoor platter is a "must have" to explore the amazing varieties they offer.
- Dal Makhmali is another speciality that melts into your heart with its creamy after taste.
Aaira leaves no stone unturned to make your meal a fine dining experience with its elegant and suave hospitality, and to top it, they pamper you with complimentary papad and pan. Prices are a bit high but complements the setting and feels edible given the quality of food and service you get. Every grain of food that reaches your table is simply delicious and doesn't disappoint.

Went there for a family dinner few days back. I booked a table using Zomato and was confirmed within few minutes. The ambience is okay but the food is awesome. This restaurant is surely a hidden gem. Not sure why this Park Street restaurant was empty on a Friday night, but lucky me, I was able to enjoy my dinner without waiting in long queues. The restaurant is a bit overpriced for the quantity provided, but I wouldn't mind paying extra if the food quality is good. Would definitely drop in again.

The ambience. The décor. The food. The service.
Everything was just perfect. Starting from the starter dish, the chicken was soft and the cheese filling was just at the right consistency - 'melt in mouth' . Their Lucknowi ghost biriyani was juicy with succulent pieces of lamb. We actually didn't feel the need of any side dishes! It was delicious. The service was even very gentle, delivering the exact commands that the customer wants. Alcohol was not hypely over-priced. The only con part is that they didn't have any strong beer. You have to order premium beers only. After this sumptuous lunch experience, I would definitely love to go back to this place. Great work.

I fail to understand why do you state you have bar when you don't have beer, any shooters, baileys and the list continues. Sangria was diluted with just a hint of fruits. However it is supposed to be filled with fruits. Virgin martini was absolutely tasteless. Now coming to food we started with bharwan aloo atishi and tandoori baby corn. Aloo was very sweet and baby corn was overcooked. After such a great starter we thought of stepping out. Could not bear it more

Visited Aaira on 25th December:
Due to festive season we booked our table and waited for 1 hour.This is really a romantic dine out with mouth watering dishes.We tried Indian cuisines and they know how to make people happy by foods.

Foods:
 STARTER:We ordered Murg Rozali Kebab as starter and the best part of this starter is the chicken is centrally filled with cheese.This "CHEESE" factor takes this dish to an another level of taste. 
MAIN COURSE:We ordered "Fish Potli Biryani" and "Murg Peswari".They are famous for fish potli biryani and yes the dish is really well cooked.The best part it is served in a potli,when you open this potli you are in love with the awesome smell of biryani.
Murg Peswari is really hot in taste,it was served with cottage cheese.

Atmosphere:
Romantic in one word,You can go for your date.

Attendant:
Average.

I am in love with the ambience of this place. Dining here is truly an experience, one which we might call regal. The ambient lighting of the place, the soothing gems of yesteryear mellowing in the background, the beautiful designs on the wall, all of these make Aaira an amazing place to dine in. 

As for the food, I ordered Murgh Rozali Kebab, Murgh Charminar, and Masala Kulcha. The kebabs were good. The cool thing about them was the little centre of melted cheese which was quite delectable. The Murgh Charminar was well prepared. I found the gravy of this chicken dish very rich and savoury. As for the Masala Kulcha, they were more or less average. Quite honestly, they were just too thin to be called Kulchas. Nothing about the taste, though. They tasted just as Kulchas ought to taste. 

The service is pretty quick and the staff was very attentive. One of the things that I liked about the place was the extra side dishes they serve with the dishes. For instance, we were given Papad with the main dishes and after we were finished, voila! Paan. The place is expensive but the visit is worth it.

Well how to describe it, birthday treat, good food, good ambiance and good reception. Yes you got it all. 

The best thing about this restaurant is it's food. It excites your taste buds to the utmost. Delicacy served with proper love. Yes it is. The Lucknow ghost biriyani is the one everyone should opt for. I highly recommend it. And the raita with it just soothes your tongue. To top it over there is the mutton Afreen. 

Talking about the management. It was to the mark. But the service took time. That's the only con that I found out there. Else all was to the mark. 
And the ambiance was note worthy. Soothing music, yellow lights and a serene environment.

So to conclude, go for a lunch or a dinner, the restaurant won't disappoint you.

Finally visited this place in our second attempt, this place is located on the 1st Floor of MYX just beside KFC@ Parkstreet.... The place is less crowded that others in Parkstreet. The ambience and the lighting is soothing... We ordered Kebabs and they were simply one of the best we ever had.... However 375+ for a kebab is quite on the high side but again I would like to say, they are worth it.... Drinks are cheaper here than other similar places..... One downside this place had was that they charge service charge, which i personally dislike as i prefer giving tips in cash.... This  place is worth giving a try and i will be surely back for the kebabs <3

We then ordered paneer tikka and tandoori aloo and they were lip smacking 😊
For main course we ordered aloo da pyaaza and da makhni and they were delicious too .
Had a great time and I am thinking this will be my favourite North Indian joint in the city ❤️

I was in search for a location for a fine dining experience near park street after shopping from new market area. While searching in Zomato I found this place is perfect dine place for that night. As I was tired and need a pint of beer hence moved towards my destination. This is just opposite to legendary Peter cat restaurant. It is located inside the Myx building second floor I guess. We reached around 8 pm and two three guests were there by that time. Immediately I had asked a beer and mojito for my partner. They serve papad and peanuts as complimentary for that.  In the mean while we ordered Daba ghost, Kashmiri naan and garlic naan for dinner. On asking for repeat I opted a Teacher's 50 and a large Absolute mint for my friend. The food was mind blowing. If price is not an issue then it's a must visit place for every one. Now interesting thing is our bill. Initially it was 1970+ rupee which include the service charge. As now we are not forced to pay the service charge so when we inquired about the same the waiter discuss with the manager and prepare a new bill of 1890 rupees. Happy with the place and food and may visit again in future.

Aaira is seasoned with love. 💞 A romantic, sophisticated and tranquil place to dine in. From the couches to the lights everything is so mushy and squashy. 😍 It's royal, it's classy and the showcased water fall is the centre of attraction. 
Went here on a date and they light the candles for you on request. A perfect date place I must say. 
Well behaved trained staff who will come to your table many times for help and serving even without you call them. 🍴
The aroma of the food will itself satisfy your soul. Their biryani is bliss and a must order. To add more flavours to it we ordered chatapata aloo which yet again brought my taste buds back to life. However the mocktails were simple and were made without much effort. The complimentary yogurt and paan brought more joy. 😊
Coming to the bill, I don't know how but it exceeded 1500 which should cost for two. It's just because of high service tax and vat charges which was a bit disappointing.

WHAT should I say about Aaira ? 
This is going to be long as its one of my favourites ! Be sure to read it till the end so you can have a pleasant meal !
Its one of those restaurants where you may go a Thousand times but still don't get bored . The best of environment you will get with a family crowd . 
Okay..so now the lets talk about the main reason why you are reading this review is FOOD !!
The North Indian cuisine of food that you get here is mouthwatering . Even while writing this review I'm thinking about the food there . You better go and check out yourself . 
Don't forget that if you are a paneer fan then order the " cheezey paneer taftan " for sure ..its a blend of paneer and cheese cooked with perfection . 
If you are a stuffed aloo fan then order the " Shahi Bharwa Aloo " for sure . They are so good than I remember the names by heart . Good work Aaira team ..keep up the good work !
Bon Appetit !

Well, if I have given it 5 stars it means that every part of the experience was wonderful. Everything we ordered was from the Chef Special part and trust me we were not disappointed with any item. Be it the Dahi Kebab or Chicken items in starters, be it paneer or murg in main course or be it the desserts every item was fulfilling to the core. The service was also good and the food was served without much ado. A must visit place for casual dining.

Went there on 30th dec with family. Its an amazing place and the food is also amazing! I think its one of the best north indian dining..the ambience is great as well as the staffs there.
We ordered Peshawari Aaloo and Murg Alishan for starter..though the murg alishan was spicy enough bt the taste was really good and I really liked the cheese layer of Peshawari Aaloo which made the dish more tasty.
For main course we ordered garlic and butter naan which were really good.The Murg Peshawari deserves a special mention for its taste and Bhuna ghost is a must try for all.Finally the Hyderabadi Murg Biriyani which was different from other biriyani as it was combined with polao which gave it a different taste.The complimentenary pan was cherry on the cake. Overall we had a great dinner and recommend this place surely to those who love north indian food.

The ambience: let's say a perfect place for family or formal dinners. Not bright but doesn't become dull at any time.
Service: very good. Didn't have to ask for anything it's like they knew what we wanted. Lots of complimentary items too. 
Food: The best part of this place. It was a little bit costly but what  an you expect. Everything that we ordered was cooked good and tasted good. I would like specially mention Kashmiri Nan and lazeez paneer masala. They were very good.

'HIDDEN GEM' ---- thats what I can say about Aaira in one line... It is one of the very sophisticated places in kolkata (even though not that popular)... I had a plan to have my lunch in barbeque with my friends but all of us were keen in exploring some new places to eat instead of going to the same eatery again. having go through the reviews i approached them to try #aaira once... at first they were little bit hesitant to go but after the all the experience we had there, they thanked me for insisting them to try such a fantastic place..#aaira serves superb quality food with great taste..price is quite reasonable as compared to the quality..most importantly the ambiance is so nice and pleasant that you will feel relaxed and will be able to enjoy your food properly..I will definitely go there again...

The Aaira is one of the many restaurants that are a part of the Myx in Park Street. Locating this place isn't a big deal, considering that it's opposite legendary outlets like Peter Cat and itself is at par with them. 

Boarding the lift/stairs to the first floor transports you to a different era, with the mellow lighting and the plush interior. Paintings adorn the wall, and when we first entered, the soulful tunes of Jagdish Singh greeted us, and it was completely mesmerizing. There is a large mirror-like surface with flowing water, and it's the perfect photography zone for all who want to keep a memory. The ambiance of Aaira is surely it's greatest positive, and it's perfect for a romantic date, or a quality time with the family. 

Aaira serves primarily North Indian delicacies, and the font in the Menu card is pretty catchy for that. Since I was a little short on budget, I had to settle for a relatively short list of items. Here goes my order: 

Starters: 
1. Murgh Alishan : I had initially decided to go for the Murgh Lemongrass Potli, but the waiter suggested that since it was spicy, I settle for this. The funny part is that this preparation was no less spicy. Wrapped in yellow tandoori spices, this was quite chilly and since I have limited tolerance for that, I could hardly enjoy the dish. I did not find it to be any different from the kababs served elsewhere, though. 

Main Course:
1. Kashmiri Naan: This was soft, but not that tasty. The stuffing barely made its presence felt. 

2. Masala Kulcha: This was pretty good, and was stuffed with something sweet that went quite well with the Mutton we ordered. 

3. Dabba Gosht: This came wrapped in egg and tasted quite good. There were a good number of pieces for two, and the gravy was rich, yet not oily and in my opinion, definitely recommended. 

Desserts: 
1. Baked Mihidana with a layer of Yoghurt and Kesaria Rabdi : They said that the Malpua wasn't available and so I went ahead with this, since it looked a tad different from the usual choices. However, tasting the upper layer really made me regret my decision. The yoghurt layer kills the sweet taste of Mihidana and makes you wonder if it is a dessert for the diabetic people! But coming to the Rabdi layer, your opinion starts changing, and the dessert doesn't taste so bad after all. The quantity is pretty good, and more than sufficient for two people after a hearty meal. 

I didn't explore the bar, which the place is so famous for. So I cannot really comment about that section. But for the food, I feel the place is a little overpriced for the quality of food served, though am yet to explore a large part of the menu. However, if you're looking for a romantic night to completely woo your better half while keeping it desi, this is definitely the place to go to!

We order Kulcha-Naan and Kali-Daal and it was finger licking. If you wanna have a tasty North-Indian Food, go for it.

Smashing good food. We had to wait a while for a table on Xmas eve but it was well worth it. I started with an excellent pina colada. The intriguingly named Birbal Batata was certainly interesting - think baby potato balls served in puff pastry. Kurkure paneer was also pretty great, though quite different from what I was expecting (on the lines of shredded paneer). Main course was plain old roti and lasooni saag, the latter was simple and heartening. The cherry on the cake was caramel custard of which we got a generous and satisfying portion. I had gone in with not much thought to my expectations and was glad to be massively impressed.

Situated in the prime location of Park Street, on the first floor of MYNX building, this place is very well decorated with a royal touch in furnitures. Staffs were very humble & courteous. They helped us to choose best items from the menu. A very soothing instrumental folk music plays in the background. Overall: 4.7/5 for Decoration, Ambience & Hospitality.Coming to the food, we ordered(Respective ratings based on their quality given in the bracket):
Murgh Jahangiri Shorba (Starter Soup) (3.5/5)
Murgh Rozali Kebab (Starter Tandoor) (4.5/5)
Aachari Machli (Starter Tandoor) (5/5)
Murgh Afsha (Main Course) (4.6/5)
Murgh Peshwari (Main Course) (4.6/5)
Garlic Naan (Bread) (3.5/5)
Benarasi Pulao (Rice) (3.5/5)
Hot Gulaab Jamun with Vanilla Ice Cream & Chocolate Sauce (Dessert) (4.8/5)

I would like to recommend to try Aachari Machli and Pahaari Machli. They are one of the best tandoor fish I have tried. Benarasi Pulao was ordinary but the chicken side dishes made that up. Hot Gulaab Jamun was a melt-in-mouth with appropriate amount of sweetness (I like to have low sweetened dessert). Overall one of the best North Indian & Mughlai eatery of Kolkata be it according to the food quality or hospitality. Looking forward to visit again.

A fine dining restaurant with a plethora of dishes to offer seemed quite extravagant when it came to the decor and ambience. Much to my surprise, the prices were exorbitant. A pint of beer was more than 200. Ordered the Chef's special Murgh Rozali Kebab and Cheesy Paneer Taftan. The Murgh Rozali Kebab was spicy minced chicken stuffed with cheese which tasted different but nothing great compared to the regular kebabs we are all used to. The Paneer was nice, soft and well cooked.

A spacious place like this one which promises to offer a decent amount of privacy couldn't match up to my expectations. The waiters were courteous but one wouldn't expect them to hover around the table all the time. One even stood for a good 10 mins, almost screaming at the top of his voice while taking orders from the person seated next to us.

The ambience was soothing and the washrooms were neat and tidy.
Overall a few positives to take away from this one but didn't seem like the place one would keep coming back to.

Went there with high expectation seeing the zomato rating and I must say it was truly fulfilled. It has a nice decor and ambience with royal mughlai touch. The dimmy light and soothing music would make you comfortable.
As soon as you reach there they would offer you refreshment tissue.
Coming to food we ordered murg rozali kabab and fish potli biriyani. The kabab was a bit over spiced. The potli biriyani comes in a potli of white flour and don't know why they serve that potli of white flour ( tasteless roti of maida) in your plate. Otherwise I liked the taste. We also ordered a pinacolada which was perfect.
At the end they would serve you a complimentary pan which was the cherry on the cake.
Overall it was a nice experience and I think the pocket pinch is also justified compared to the service they are providing.

It was my friend's treat and we opted AAIRA as we both share our love for north Indian food. The place is quite small yet cozy & comfortable, decor is classy & it has royal touch in it. Staffs are courteous and keeping their eyes on our tables when our plates were getting empty they were filling them up immediately. Now coming to the food we ordered raan-e-aaira for starter which was actually way too much for two person, but it was an extraordinary one! That juicy tender baby mutton leg pieces with lots of spices were nothing but yummilious! Even the dips & chutneys which they serve along was quite good. Again for the main course we tried aaira special fish potli biriyani which unfortunately didn't satisfy our taste buds much, but it was pretty decent , it has 4pieces of bhetki fish.They serve that with raita & papad.We were too full after having only 2items along with red wine that we couldn't make for desert but as they served complimentary MEETHA PAAN so we ended up with sweet tooth . Well.. looking forward to pay a visit near future to try the other dishes.

Located just next to Park Street KFC, Aaira is on the 1st floor of MYX.  The dinner starts from 7 . 

The ambiance is great and the decor is classy. Seating arrangements are extremely comfortable. Music is soft and soothing. 4.5/5.
The staff were courteous.
As soon as we got seated, we were offered refreshment tissues which impressed us quite a bit. 
But there has to be a point deduction for the staff conversing and laughing among themselves bit too loudly and 1 of them even used a slang without making any effort to keep his voice low.  4/5.

We ordered:

Masaledaar Chhas: Could have tasted better. It was watery and there was hardly any buttermilk flavor.  3/5.

Murgh Rozali Kebab: 8 pieces of stuffed cheesy minced chicken, coated with Tandoori spices cooked in clay oven. Chicken was juicy & succulent & use of spices was perfect. 4.5/5.

Garlic Naan: One of the best naans I've had so far. It was beyond perfect. 5/5.

Murgh Lazeez Tikka Masala: Again, a wonderful preparation. The gravy was finger licking and the chicken pieces was soft, tender and tasted yummy. 4.5/5.

Price: Reasonable.

Portion : Good.

Recommended!

One word verdict : Good Mughlai taste
Went there based on the Zomato rating and must say that I was pleased with everything including ambience, service, price taste
I ordered Jheenga Aira - prawns in tomato and cream based gravy and laccha paratha
One thing I would like to put here is that if you are from North India and specially from place like Delhi then you will find this taste very familiar hence going to Kolkata and having the same taste was the only dampener
Will I go there again: if I am craving Mughlai, then definitely

Hello foodies,

First  of all,I'd like to say that the name "Aaira" is carrying it's  meaning significantly according to their quality ,quantity and taste . 
The word "Aaira" is a Islamic word means 'Noble','Honorable','Respectful'.

LOCATION:  ( 4.5/5)
It is at the 1st floor of the MYX building,Park Street. To be more precise, it is located just opposite Peter Cat and beside the building of KFC. 

AMBIENCE: (4/5)
Ambience is nice for this restra. It's a family restaurant.So expect some chaos of the kids.
Staffs are courteous,polite and helpful. 
Not very spacious ,but you can enjoy with your loved ones. :)

FOOD: (4.2/5)

Ahh...the foods are delicious and mouth watering. Your taste buds will jump on  every bite for sure.

In starters,  
                A. Ilish Kabiraji        >> First time I tried boneless hilsa and it was a jaw dropping experience.
                B. Aachari Machhli >> Succulent pieces of fishes with great mixture of spices.
                C. Murgh Alishan    >> It was also tasted awesome.One of the signature dishes.

 In Main Course , 
                 A. Fish Potli Biriyani  >> It was a dish which I had for the first time.It was fabricated with a wrapper of                                                                  wheat (ingredients of Roti items )  and inside it there were  4 pieces of Vetki 
                                                                 cubes.The rice was well cooked,juicy and spicy too.
                                                                 It can serve 3 people at least after having heavy starters. :)
                B. Dabba Gosht         >> Though I'm not that mutton craving,I'll suggest you to try this dish at least                                                                       once.Every mutton pieces were wrapped with eggs and it tasted like                                                                                    heaven. Sufficient enough to have it as a side dish with any rice or roti items.
                                                                 Portion can serve 2 people.

It was a treat from my friend....and we choose this place for the occasion.It is situated at the 1st floor of myx (park street). The ambience was classy and the decoration was traditional,based on mughal traditions with a the touch of sophistication. There hospitality was good. Food was authentic and yummy.. fish potli biriyani is a must try dish. Two things which are to be rectified,are the tracks that they play and should b a little faster in serving the ordered items.  Else than that it is perfect in every manner.

Went to Aaira , 1st floor myx for dinner yesterday to treat two of my friends with a lot of expectations seeing the massive zomato ratings and reviews , which was partially met.

Talking about food it scores a 5 on 5 . kudos to the chef for that. we tried the most recommend dishes MURGH ROZALI KEBAB , RAAN E AAIRA , FISH POTLI BIRYANI and the food was way too much for three of us , but all delicous with no scope of any minor complain or suggestion . The kebabs were 8 pieces of tender chicken with a cheese stuffing was a great start. the presentation and taste of fish biryani blew us all , it can be consumed just with the raita that comes along and handsdown to the mutton raan which comes in a huge portion sharable between 4-5 pax , and the spicy juicy meat tasted fingerlicking good.Our glasses of SWEET LIME SODA accompanied the food well. The dessert MINI GULAB JAMUN AND CHENNA CHEESECAKE came piping hot and tasted tad oversweet. 2 spoons of this is enough to meet the sweetness threshold that we crave for after our meal , so this can be easily shared between 4 people. complimentary PAAN was also offered after the meal.

the service was sluggish , staff needs to be more efficient and polished in terms of dealing guests as this is a fine dining place. they took quite a long time to serve the courses which was quite annoying. The overall staff support and management of Chilli wok is doing a much better job than Aaira.

And most importantly the music track selection sucks big time , which i also mentioned in the feedback form. I well understand the ambience is royal with traditional nawabi touch , but the bhajans played in the background simply killed our mood. Their music selection should be such that is likeable by all age groups , we don't expect very happening bollywood hiphop or rock music the ones played upstairs; restaurants like oudh , kalaash etc plays indian music that suits their theme be it lucknowi ghazals or classical instrumentals , but here at aaira , the low volume bhajan kirtan was way too boring for us.

Would love to give a 4.5 but for the cold service and music without a sync , i'll have to restrict it to a 4 out of 5.

Aaira is located on the  first floor of the Myx building in Park street, and can be easily identified as this place is diagonally opposite to Peter Cat. We had a preference which included staying away from crowd, loud music, good food and of course good service. I got to know about this place through Zomato and decided to drop in for dinner. The purpose was my birthday celebration over dinner. 
We absolutely loved the place starting from the decor, the ambiance, the ghazal playing at the background, the service of the staffs, and the quality and quantity of food served to us. 
Things we ordered are stated as follows along with the rating:
1. Raan e Aaira (5/5)
2. Onion cheese kulcha (5/5)
3. Rozali kebab (4.75/5)
4. Sweet lime soda (4.5/5)
Unfortunately we were so full that we had to miss out on the desserts. However, we loved every single food item and the way they were served. The best one according to me was definitely "Rann e Aaira", and I think everyone should try out this dish when they visit Aaira. Finally they served paan along with the bill, and we left with a content smile on our faces. :D

On this Ashthami night me and my parents went there. I wanted to try a new place.. Zomato had helped me to find Aaira. Lucky we were that we got parking easily on a ashthami night.. Also the restaurant had places available. The interiors were beautifully decorated in Mughal style and the ambience was good. For starters we ordered Jhinga Angara & Murg Alishan. Jhingha(prawn) angara was so so ( iv had better) bt the Murg Alishan was really of good taste and had a nice texture to it. Then ordered the Fish Potli Biriyani, Butter Naan & Murg Peshawari
 I obviously took a risk with the Fish Biriyani bt took it as the waiter suggested. But.."No Risk No Gain" and i Gained  XD .. It was awesome.. Wrapped it a fried naan it was very well cooked with chunks of fish and lots of masala. Nothing like i had before. Murg Peshawari was so so. In the end they served us paan which was a nice gesture. It is a bit on the pricy side but will definitely visit again for the One of a kind Fish Potli Biriyani :)

If you to get a royal feel, do visit Aaira. Its just beside KFC, inside the Myx.
We tried the Lucknowi Gosht biriyani and biriyani tastes great (I am not a biriyani lover, bdw!).
Also ordered for a Murg Afsha and the chicken was eqaually soft.
I loved the decor and the ambience. The service needs be quicker though.
Overall - 4/5

In dessert we took Gulab jamun with cheesecake and pineapple rabri..It was unique.. Ambience was very romantic.. Overall a nice experience...

Liquor rates sloshed this Durga Puja at Aaira..!

Looking for a place to drop down with your gang of friends this Pujo? Liquor at amazing cheap rates and the perfect assorted kebabs to tag along with it? Your destination is Aaira for sure.

Location : Located at The Myx complex, Middleton Row in the Park Street area, just opposite Peter Cat.

Decor and Ambience : Aaira promises you a classy, soothing and mellow ambience. The decor is elegantly furnished with regal Indian paintings and designs on walls. The Nawabi decor with aari and Parsi work and an amber tone is bound to make your fine dine experience worthwhile. The gazals and the Hindi classics played adds to the whole experience.

All alcohol bottles available at  MRP + establishment charge ( Rs 500 flat ) + Applicable taxes ( 21% ).

When Park Street becomes the New and Improved China Town..!

Aaira, one of the popular branches and wings of The Myx, launched bottle rate card for the very first time. Located in the heart of Park Street, right beside KFC, this stunning and comfy bar and restaurant, now brings you one step closer to the vibe and ambiance of China Town. For the uninitiated, Aaira will now serve you alcohol, at bottle rate prices, plus some additional taxes. A bottle of regular Black Dog, which would cost you somewhere around 1750/-, will be available here for a nominal charge of Rs. 500 more, plus an additional 21% surcharges on the total amount of Rs. 2250/-

Hello fellas! Here is an interesting story that I am going to share today. With the festive season coming up all our way, the city of joy is also gathering up with new and newer restaurants bringing in the best of the recipes and offers to the commoners. The Myx is already a popular name among the youngsters for it houses some of the best restaurants as well as the rooftop eateries and lounges in Park Street, the most happening area of Kolkata. Aaira is one such name. Recently, our food bloggers’ group PanchPhoron was invited by the Aaira authorities to sample their special Puja menu launches and their exclusively new feature that is, ‘alcohol at bottle rates’.

It was in my wishlist form long back. And I was wondering how a restaurant having such a great rating but quite unknown. And the experience I had there conveyed me all :)

Location: it is at park Street area. Just opposite of Peter cat. Beside the KFC, u will find the myx. It is just on the 1st floor of that building.

Decor: it is just a perfect pleasant fine dining restaurant. Very soothing. 

Now coming to food.

Starter
__________________
 1. Raan a aaira : this is something out of the world. Baby mutton leg. Too tastey. Just have it there. Otherwise u will sure to miss something.

We just ordered one starter, because it is more than enough for two people.

Main course
_______________________

1. Fish potli biriyani: another wow item. Biriyani of bhetki fish served in a bread potli. This taste just amazing. One of d finest biriyani I have ever had. But please do keep it mind it's a hydrabadi style biriyani.
The rice was just too good, with four piece of bhetki.

They served the biriyani with salad, raita, papad.

Enough for two people. We just wanted to taste the fish biriyani so went for it. Otherwise u can have their Lucknow e ghost biriyani.

Experience is just superb.

2. Murg afsa: this is another amazing dish. It taste just superb. Goes well with biriyani also.
Boneless chicken cooked with egg, palak n mushroom.
The gravy was too tastey. Do try this one. Gravy with mushroom n palak blending together in a perfect way.

Desert
______________

1. Cheese cake with pineapple rabri and small gulab jaumn:
Another innovative n tastey preparation. Cheese cake having gulab jam as a middle layer. And upper layer is pineapple rabri. Amazing.

But do note: it is very sweet in taste.


Amazing experience overall. We went there just 2 people, so couldn't try many items. Even the list I mentioned above more than enough for two.

Food quality amazing, quantity also very good. And one of the best moglai restaurant in town

Yes, we can omit the long time they took to serve the item. As they mentioned also, they will cook it fresh, so it will take some time.

So, a great experience and will visit again to taste the other items also.

Now cost is on a higher side: 2400 INR for two people.

But amazing experience. Team aaira keep it up :)

I had been to this place during my visit to Kolkata. Though the restaurant is small, the ambience was good. The lighting was little dull and the seating was good. Not much crowd.
We ordered few snacks and they tasted good. Also ordered some rotis and they were very soft to eat.
It was a good dining experience.

Before I start reviewing, I would like to add something. I sometimes feel that averaging decor, service and food is hardly a good idea. So, I would suggest other reviewers to follow a weight for each. For example, I would give Aaira a 5 in food and decor, but a 3.5 in service. So, my Aaira rating would be 
5*3=15. 3.5*2=7 and 5*1=5. Total=27. Divide by 6, you get 4.35ish, which I would round up to 4.5. So, multiply your food rating by 3, service by 2 and decor by 1. Now moving to the review. 

It was our first visit to Aaira and an anticipated one too. Well, it lived up to our expectations. We ordered the achari machli kebab with the mixed platter. I ordered a chocolate heavy drink and it was brilliant. Each piece of kebab was delightful and unique. I have to say this restaurant needs more attention from kebab lovers. 
We ordered murgh peswari as a side along with Prawn biriyani and Gosht biriyani. Watch out Oudh because you've got real competition here! Each of the biriyanis had a commendable amount, so much so that we had to pack some of it home. I believe one biriyani is sufficient if you're taking a side dish after the kebabs. The prawn biriyani had insanely juicy prawns which was delightful considering the prawn biriyanis I've had sometimes. All I can ask from the management is to improve their service a bit since they missed one of our orders and we had to tell them once again. 

The bill was 3500 for 3, but I think you can restrict yourself within 2800 for 3 since we took extra food. Overall, a wonderful experience. Will be going back as soon as possible!

I was pretty excited while walking into this place coz this had been in my list since quite long..
So, Interiors were quite nicely done with a old traditional, a lil' moghal feel. Staff was courteous & helpful as well. 
And with the food, i chose to order the specials for it was my first visit.. 
The Fish Potli Biriyani was a yumm and a refreshing change from the usuals that we have.. And i ordered for a Kebab platter, as i wanted to try out all their kebabs! They were great! Specially the bhetki fish kebab.. Althgh the prawn was a lil' raw for my taste.. 
And then came the desert.. Mini Gulab Jamun with Cheese Cake & Pineapple Rabri.. All my fav things into one dish!
Would love to visit again to try out more! Xoxo

And the food. The biriyani is close to the best I've tasted in a long long time. The chicken Afghani is also worth the mention. 
The staff behaves extremely well even with children jumping around the place and spilling water. With a smile. They're attentive to requirements and make sure that customers don't have to wait.

Aaira, the casual dining restaurant of The Myx is already popular for its delicious North Indian & Mughlai dishes. I for one, have heard a lot about their fish Biryani. But this post is not for their biryanis. I’ll review their food in some other post.
Aaira has decided to introduce ‘by the bottle’s prices in their bar. Finally! Somebody in Park Street decided to do, what should have been done long time back. You might be thinking, may be it’s only for premium liquors? Wrong.Even Old Monk & Blenders Pride are available. Now what about the price? MRP + establishment charge ( Rs 500 flat ) + Applicable taxes ( 21% flat ). 
Details on the blog.

This joint is very famous for their specialities.their fish biryani one of the signature dish.if you didn’t tried yet then you have to visit this joint.a classy interior which decorated with lovely indian paintings all over the all as well as lovely designed walls.also this restaurant has a lovely ambience.located in park street area first floor at the Myx just beside the KFC,park street.recenly they started a unique concept which is very rare to find in fine dinning restaurant.i was also mesmerized after hearing that concept.you just come along with group of friends order a bottle of any kind of drink like whisky/vodka/rum from the menu.whatever price printed over the bottle pay that with tax and the bottle is yours.you can enjoy the whole bottle of whisky/vodka/rum with your friends.no need for asking them for a small/medium/large pegs.i think this concept for the first time Aaira launched in kolkata specially in a fine dinning restaurant like them.not only this they also launched some lovely lip-smacking veg and non-veg starters which you can eat along with the drinks.recently i was invited there by the management of Aaira over a tasting session with my fellow foodie friends.they served some lovely mouth-watering starters started with,

Well we were very pleasantly surprised. We chose to go here only based on zomato reviews, and thank God we did! The food was great! Everything from the starters to the main course. Even the staff is courteous. I don't know why it isn't too popular yet. On a Sunday night, apart from us there was just one more table occupied. I hope my review would add a little to their popularity!

Located at the 1st floor of Myx, this restauarnt is a hidden gem in the bylanes of Park Street. I'm an explorer of food and that is how we landed at Aaira for the farewell lunch of my team head when I was asked for suggestion. All my colleagues wanted to have Indian/Mughlai/Desi Khana and were skeptical to try out a new restaurant. However, after reading the reviews on Zomato and going through the menu, I couldn't have given it a miss! And, Oh! am so glad that I didn't. The ambience is best for a dinner date ;) than a brunch/lunch. Now coming to the food..what we had ordered:
1. Murgh Nurani Kebab- Chicken mince tandoori cooked with grated boiled egg. This one was cooked to perfection with juicy pieces of chicken that melted in the mouth with the right balance of spices. 
2. Palak aur Paneer Sajedari- Cottage Cheese and Spinach Ball with Smooth Tomato Gravy. Though am not a fan of paneer, but this one was quite a hit!
3. Murgh Afsa- Boneless spring chicken cooked in rich brown gravy served with spinach, mushroom and egg. This one was suggested by the waiter. And, thank god that we did take up the suggestion..because this one was lip smacking good. 
4. Siders- Chilli Roti(for the ones who love to have it spicy)
Onion Chilli & Cheeese Kulcha(one of the best Kulcha's that I've had so far)
Methi Paratha(This was okayish...could have been better)
I would definitely recommend this one to the ones who love to try out new places as this one will definitely surprise you with their amazing food options :) 
Cheers!

Location-At park street crossing opposite peter cat.

This place is located on 1st floor at The myx.As you enter the place you will be awestruck by the beauty of this place.This place is so well decorated that the ambiance and environment looks very calm.The service provided by them is outstanding.And now coming to food,we had
1-"Palak shorba"
2-"Aaira mix veg platter"
3-"Sabzi lasooni saag"
4-"yellow dal"
5-"Garlic naan"
6-"Chocolate toffee"
*And among them the must try is "palak shorba" and "sabzi lasooni saag".But never go for any "mocktails" as they are not worth the price.

Food-4/5
Service-4.5/5
Ambiance-4/5

This place is a must visit and i assure that you will be carried away by their food and service.😃😃

The warmth and the cordiality (a quality that is hard to find nowadays) of the staff is the first thing that touched me and made my visit to this place a pleasant one. 
They were polite, courteous and very attentive to the minute details.
Food was really nice and quite different from the regular and traditional restaurants out there in park street.
We ordered "Murgh rosalli kebab", "Murgh Peshwari" and "Onion and chilly cheese kulcha". The kulcha is worth drooling for - had none like this before. The kebab was also very good, specially because it was garnished with cheese. The quantity was modest enough for two people.
I would definitely recommend the park street frequenters to try this place out if they want a change of taste from the traditional restaurants out there.

Visited this place for the first time. Food was superb. Service was excellent. Quick service is always appreciated. Mocktails were top notch. Everything else was great, except the fact that I am probably the unlucky customer who got bitten by some bug on my hip. It could be ants maybe. I Don't know. Please look into that. Otherwise, everything was good :)

It's 9/10 for ambiance and decoration. We had their signature dish fish putli biriyani. Good but amount of fish in biriyani was not sufficient. The quantity can be served for 3.  Apart from that we had one chicken side dish and one Hilsha Kabiraji as starter. Overall good experience.

Well... it took me a lot of brainstorming to think about how to start off my review of Aaira, because no matter how well I try jotting down, my heart says "Yeh dil maange more". So to put it plain and stright - Aaira is one of the best North Indian Fine dining cuisine I have witnessed in Kolkata and for me they are the new benchmark for me in this genre. With exemplary service manners to exemplary taste, this place has it all that a foodie needs to go away with one of the best memories ever.

Located at the Myx building diagonally opposite to Peter Cat, this place located at the first floor is not difficult to find out. Upon entering the place, one would find that the decor has a class written all over it although it's nothing to fancy or theme-based stuff. We took a table for two and no sooner did we settled down when we were handed over with wet tissues to freshen ourselves up.

Coming to the food, when my first impression of a place is good, I generally leave it on the attendant to suggest us their signature dishes. Based on their suggestion, we ordered Murgh Rozali Kebab, Raan-e-Aaira and Fish Biriyani, an a mocktail too called Shirley Temple, which was nothing extra-ordinary. 

Murgh Rozali Kebab is a one of a kind Kebab of minced chicken wrapped in chicken fillets with a filling of molten cheese inside. It was a one of a kind kebab and went too well with scotch.

The next big thing came in the form of Raan-e-Aaira. It was a full "Raan" of mutton chargrilled and pan-tossed with bell peppers and onions, and served on a "Butter naan". It was supposed to be for 4 going by the size of the spread but our lack of mental resistance made us wipe out the total dish. One of the best mutton starters I ever had.

Next came the Fish Biriyani. A quirky way of serving in a "Potli" of dough which turned into soft roti as a result of "dum". The biriyani is another dish which will etch my memory for a long time because of its aroma, the perfect quantity of condiments and most importantly generous chunky pieces of fish. The biriyani was accompanied with raita, onions and roasted papad. 

The quantity of the dishes were so hefty that our orders of Murgh Afsa and a dessert of Pineapple Rabdi had to be cancelled. The price is very moderate going by the standard of the restaurant that it is. The service staffs were very courteous and friendly. However, the dishes took quite a bit of time to prepare, but it's all acceptable and it's worth a wait for such an exquisite taste of India that they offer on your table. I would love to visit the place again. Till then, cheers to the team !

I am simply in love with this place. Everything is just PERFECT! I had visited Aaira few days ago with a friend of mine and ordered shirley temple, a mocktail, murgh rosali kebab, hyderabadi murgh biryani, mini gulab jamun with baked cheesecake and pineapple rabri. I fell in love with each and every dish. This place is a must visit for all north indian food lovers.

Aaira is located on the first floor of Myx in upscale Park Street, diagonally opposite the legendary Peter Cat. Ambiance and decor is very soothing, mellow and elegantly furnished with regal Indian paintings and designs on walls and dim lighting. Waiters are dressed in traditional North Indian attire. Hospitality of staff and service is excellent and praiseworthy. Servers are attentive, courteous and polite. 

We were seated on warm comfy sofas and chairs at a table neatly laid with cutlery and water in wine glasses.
Visited this lovely restaurant for my birthday treat. 
We were given delicate rolled wet towels following the Japanese tradition of "oshibori" to sanitise hands or even cleanse faces initially, followed by the starter in which other guests drank Teachers Origin while I sipped a refreshing fresh lime juice.

We ordered Mili Jhuli Rotiyan which is an assorted bread basket with naan, roti, kulcha, paratha and misi; Paneer Jhal Frezi which is a spicy paneer preparation, and Raraah Goshth consisting of tender minced and chunky mutton with a royal touch.

Amount of food served is enormous so we parcelled the mutton for home. Quality of food is excellent, and is served fresh and piping hot.
The kulcha is one of the best kulchas I've ever tasted, soft and meltingly delicious. Paneer was spicy but not very spicy and exquisitely tasteful as was the Goshth.

For a sumptuous meal in a tranquil environment amidst soft Bollywood oldies, Aaira should be on your wish list if you are fond of North Indian delicacies in which Aaira specialises.

Visited this place on a Sunday afternoon. It was hosting an Ilish festival so we were interested to try that out. Ambience and upkeeping of the place was totally upto the mark. Service quality was also polite but not overfriendly. Most importantly the quality of food was awesome. We had ilish kabiraji which was very tasty with totally boneless Ilish, a novelty in itself, but we Ilish lovers would definitely love to feel the flavour of Ilish in this preparation which was not present.however, I loved the overall experience the place had to offer and I am going to visit again for sure.

The extended wing of our hostel had decided to go for a dinner on a weekend. Since we were an 8-men strong party, it was getting very difficult to get a consensus for a place. Finally, someone suggested Aaira. I had once unsuccessfully tried to get an entry into this place when I had gone there a few months before with another set of friends. This time, too we had 10-15 minutes of waiting. The place I believe is very small, hardly 10 tables and because of the good food, its always jam-packed with families, professionals, foreigners. 

The overall ambiance of the place is not that great. Can't actually remember whether they were playing any music at all. But since we were in the company of friends, the same was compensated. Now with regards to the food, the place is known for its innovative Mughlai food and we had come here exactly for that. Based on a few reviews and some personal likings we ordered the following

Appetizers:
-Ilish Kobiraji
-Murgh Alishan
-Murgh Rozali Kebab
-Raan e Aira

Main Course
-Dabba Gosht
-Fish Biryani
-Murgh Peshawari

The food was amazing, in taste, texture and presentation. The portions were large enough.  So an omlette formed the dabba for the gosht. This was the first time ever I had fish biryani and enjoyed it a lot. 
The Murg Peshawari was served with a foam of egg white over it. Not sure how they created it but it was commendable. The breads were also good. One bone of contention, the lag between the appetizers and the Main Course was huge. In fact, we had started contemplating to leave the place. I am not sure what was going wrong in the kitchens but such a long time is just not acceptable. Anyway, the food was so awesome that it compensated for the delays it created.

Since we had a corner of the place for ourselves, we were definitely on our own with regards to having fun and catching up on things. Overall, a nice experience!

After going through all the reviews, it was time for me to visit this place. Saturday evening dinner was the plan and hence made an advanced booking. 

Reached the place, well its very easy to locate this place and please do not let google map fool you by showing a different place. Next to Park street KFC and bang opposite to Mocambo.

The staff are courteous, the ambiance of this place is really nice and you can hear gazals as the background music which sets the mood.

On the drinks, I started off with Teachers hiland cream and martini. Martini was a big disappointment and I mentioned this to the manager and came to know that they do not have a proper bartender yet.

For the starters I had ordered Tandoori platter, Chicken tandoori, Pahari Machli & Zaitooni Paneer Tikka. Coming to the taste of each of these, the Pahari machli was nice cooked soft pieces and pretty good in taste and not spicy.  The tandoori platter is a must try. Coming to the Chicken tandoor, it was hard and I had to call up the manager and ask did you use frozen meat for the preparation as the tenderness of the meat has gone. The manager agreed that the meat gets frozen after marination, something grossly wrong with the preparation process, after marinating the meat never freeze the meat. However the manager was prompt enough to prepare a fresh plate for me.

On the main course, butter naan, Lucknowi Biryani, Roomali roti, Murgh Afsha, Bhuna Ghost. Lucknowi Biryani perfectly looked, the presentation was fantastic, but in terms of the taste it lacked the real taste, something a miss in this. Murgh afsha, the chicken pieces dipped in rich gravy and added to it was spinach paste, this was not spicy and was a nice dish. Bhuna ghost to me was some disappointment.

To end a glass of beer. By the bill they also served mitha paan which was nice. 

Overall a nice experience but on the price point I do a expect a little better taste and a good bartender!!

I went there with my friends and family for a family dinner on saturday eve.. first impression.. the ambience is good, a dim light place with smoothing music (Specially For those who love gazals like me ;) ) we ordered zeera pani for begining.. followed by cheesy paneer taftan and murgh rozali kebab.. kebab was really good.. for the main course we ordered potli fish biryani, dabba gosht, palak paneer sajedari, onion cheese kulcha, masala kulcha, dalma and banarasi pulao. The food was fingerlicking good and its quantity was really good as compared with the price.. i specially liked the potli fish biryani , dabba gosht and dalma.. the staff is prompt and courteous.. though the food was amazing we couldn't finish it off because of the quantity and asked them to pack it for us which they did in a very good way.. we were full to the brim and so avoided deserts but there complementary paan completed it all.. over all a great dining experience.. a good place to go with family.. and for the staff : you are doing a great job..please keep it up.

Situated on the 1st floor of the Myx lounge, this beauty of a restaurant can be accessed through the elevator or through stairs. The amazing ambience and decor will take you aback and the courteous staff will greet you humbly. The soulful music (jagjit singh ghazals) will make you get lost in transition. Very cosy interiors befitted with small lamps, a small waterfall just to soothe your eyes.
Now comes the food. We got a 2:1 offer on drinks
The sound of ghazals mixed with liquor was amazing indeed. We tried the ilish Kabab as it was ilish festival celebrated here. It was absolutely tasty. The dips accompanying the starters were also one of a kind.peshawari aloo was next. It was again deliciously droolworthy. Main course was kofta and chana. Chana was very very spicy whereas kofta was little sweet.
All in all, it was a great evening. Thanks to aaira.

On a Saturday afternoon, this place was completely unoccupied. That was the first let down. Bug apart from that the place has great ambience.

Starters: We had the chicken rozali kabab. Filled with cheese this soft tikka kabab was amazing. 

Main course : Mutton kabab platter where the kabab was average at best .. Hyderabadi biryani which looked amazing (the pic) and tasted somewhere between Kolkata and Hyderabad..

The portions were filling and desserts meant only pan and a fresh lime soda glass. 

The ratings here are attributed to the amazing ambience and the brilliant starter..

P.S. a tad expensive! Don't go by Zomato's cost for 2 here

Aaira.. It was in our wish list for a long time.. Finally got a chance to visit on this eid with 4 of my friends .. Its located in the first floor of Myx building..

Ambience - 5/5 (It gives you a Royal feeling)

Staff - 5/5 (Their service was prompt and suggestions were to woo for)

Now the best part, FOOD -
For the starter we ordered Raan-e-Aaira, Jhinga Banjara, Murgh Alishan.. All of them were just superb.. Still the best part was the Raan-e-Aaira.. It was more than sufficient for 5 of us.. It was served with a butter naan.. Yummmm.. To gulp down the starters we had ordered some drinks as well.. Sangria, Mango cocktail, Budweiser, and finally some Glenfiddich and Absolute on the rocks.. Heavenly!! Now for the main course, we ordered Garlic naan, gosht biriyani, Murgh afsha, dabba ghosht.. The gosht biriyani was not so good.. But the Murgh afsha stole the show.. The gravy was prepared with spinach n mushrooms.. It was delicious.. The Garlic naan was soft.. The dabba ghost was good too..
I'll give 4.5/5 for food. 0.5 deducted for the biriyani..

Pocket pinch - 7507 for 5ppl..

All in all a great experience.. And sure to be back soon.. \m/ Sorry no pics we were too busy with the food :p

I would have given it a 5 because of the quality of food they serve. But at the end you will obviously look at the bill which comes later. They charge for a single item that much in which amout you could have had a buffet. But if you are not money concious then yes this is an amazing place to go to once.

Went there on a friday Night. We were a group of 8 and they took reservation which was pretty nice.

We ordered the following:
1) Jeera Pani --> It was nice, very nice mix of sweetness with the typical Jeera Pani Taste. 

2) Vegetable Chilli Milli --> Not what I expected it to be, This was possibly the only Item which we ordered was average at best. Not bad in taste, but very regular stuff, more like a cutlet.

3) Paneer Makhmali --> Truly as per its name, Tasty with the paneer really soft and nicely marinated.

4) Tandoori Shaahi Aloo --> Suggested by the Server, It was really nice.

5) Dingri Sabnami --> Stuffed Mushroom with Cheese and fried with a batter. At first look it looked like Pakoras, But on taking a bite it was really nice.

Loved the three types of Chutney served with the startes. 

6) Veg Biryani --> it was fabulous with a strong smell of Rose Water. It might be overwhelming for those who dislike Rose Water, but for me, it was a really nice experience. 

7) Kali Daal --> it was yummy, thick and tasty.

The service was prompt and quick yet they were not in a hurry to make us leave.

Would recommend.

The ambience is good, but the food quality is not upto the mark as they charge for it. 
The martini is disgusting. 
The worst thing is the staff and the manager were staring so strangely for so long before their cosing time that we couldn't eat properly.

A great place to dine at with your partner. This place is a serious favorite of mine. The first thing that soothes your mind is  the lovely ambience. Classy decor, nice chairs and sofas, cozy corner - a lovely place overall. 

Then the food. Murg afsa is undoubtedly one of the best chicken gravy dish I have tried in the city. Kebabs are delicious, roti aar soft. Perfect food

Staff are very polite and always ready to help. 

Price - good value for money for that quality of food, space, decor and staff. You cant compare it with a low cost restaurant. 

I will go again and recommend for all my friends.

A good welcome along with a nice ambience, delicious food and great service is what we had got. 5/5 for starters, veg curries, chicken dishes and perfectly cooked breads. The cheesy paneer taftan, vegetable chilli milli and onion chilli & cheesy kulcha were delicious. It was a great experience. Thanks

I went there keeping in mind the 'romantic' setting and the variety of items promised in the menu. The ambience was good enough, just that a large family of 12-14 was seated beside our table, which completely marred the aura of romance. The food was yummy. We ordered Murg rozali kebab, Nawabi seek dilbahar and drinks for starters. For the main course, we had masala kulcha and dabba gosht. The portion of food per serving was good enough, and the service was polite and prompt. The Arabic music in the background was appropriate too.

We ordered the Achari Machli, Murgh Alishan, Fish Potli Biriyani, Mutton Biriyani, Bhuna Gosht and Dabba Gosht. And some mocktails as well. All were lip-smacking, especially the starters. The only problem is that they take a lot of time to bring the food to your table. But the wait is definitely worth it. Give it a try.

I went to this restaurant after getting recommendations from my friend. I went there with lots of expectations and honestly it didn't disappoint me. The location is nice and the ambience actually amazed me. The decor, the classy and cosy ambience increased my expectations. We ordered full kebab platter, mutton biriyani. I can't remember the side dish.. But only the kebabs were great. The biriyani was not a typical Kolkata biriyani,neither it was Awadhi. But it was altogether a very nice experience. The service was nice but little bit overpriced.

Not the best that Park Street has to offer, but not too bad for a quiet casual dinner on a weekend. Starters, staples and main course were quite satisfactory though the time taken to serve needs to be worked on.

Courteous staff who provide good recommendations and do try to make you comfortable. Will need multiple visits before their specialties can be accurately identified though.

Easily the best part of the dinner was the announcement that if KKR won the on-going match, there would be a flat 15%  discount all around.

A royal ambience, good food, a 2:1 offer on whisky, courteous staff and an additional 15% discount on condition that KKR wins, what more could you ask for ? A perfect Sunday evening thanks to Aaira. First of all, the good thing is they are one of the few authentic North Indian cuisine which has draught beer on the menu. However, the 2:1 offer on scotch was good enough to change our mind :) The food was brilliant. The dishes you should try are - Murgh Alishan - Spicy, flavourful, succulent pieces of kebab. For main course - Dabba Gosht - Medium spiced mutton topped with a deep fried egg. The service was a bit slow but the waiters and KKR's win made up for it.
P.S. - The menu on Zomato is severely incomplete, they have much more to offer.

A good place to have a quiet dinner with your close ones

Zomato recommended this place, so I went there to celebrate by birthday with my family. Perfect cozy ambience they have, rich decor with absolutely mouth watering and delectable north indian food. Service and hospitality was commendable. We ordered Murgh Alishan kebab as starter, and in the main course we had Masala kulcha, Murgh Peshawari, Butter naan, Raraah Gosht and chilli and onion cheese kulcha. All the preparations were delicious. It is a must visit for all the north indian food lovers.
And as the proverb says, all's well that ends well, my birthday ended with a surprise given by the staffs which was really appreciable.
Thank you Team Aaira.

This restaurant was highly recommended by my son who is a great foodie and a zomatoin. Aaira really searves delicious Indian cuisine amid extremely nice ambiance of well decorated walls & roof covering beautiful wallpapers alongwith comfortable sitting & soft music, which enhance the pleasure of eating. Staff are well trained and attentive and try to keep you happy and provide reach hospitality . I have enjoyed their Machli Kali Miri ; a tandoori preparation comes with three kind of chutney, was superb in taste and I feel my taste buds are still unsatisfied to have this marvellous dish again.My another dish was a chicken preparation and tandoori rotis, both foods was great in taste. I recommend this restaurant for a great dining and you will never be disappoint by the food, quality, portion, services and the ambiance. A must try restaurant who will spoil you.

Location : 1st level, Myx.

There are places in town that don’t draw much attention. Places that aren’t very well known to people. Aaira is one of those places which is rich hospitality and palate but low on consumer awareness. A lot of people still don’t know about this amazing restaurant despite that it’s been here for around 2 years. Similar to Chilli Wok the ambience and decor have been kept simple and beautiful. There is beautiful wall fountain too to compliment the interiors. There playlist is holds the greatest soothing tracks which are apt for such restaurants.

The food was all the more scrumptious and authentically North Indian.
★    Tomato Dhaniya Shorba : It was the classic tomato soup with added spices and coriander. It was an appropriate example of blend of spices with the core ingredients of the soup.

★    Cheesy Paneer Taftan : It was basically paneer tikka reincarnated. It wasn’t compromising in terms of taste but this one you can avoid and try something new instead.

★    Dahi Kebab : The inner filling of cheese and makhana powder was really good. However there were traces of dry fruits inside (unlike mentioned in the menu), which was disappointing as I wanted to test the unique combination.

★    Sabzi Lasooni Saag : It is one of their Chef’s special dishes. And trust me, it was totally worthy of the speciality status. The best assortment of vegetables and garlic gravy I have tasted in my foodie journey. Definitely recommended.

★    Butter Paneer Masala : Slightly similar to the classic paneer preparation but deplorably not in taste. It tasted a bit bland with weird flavour in the gravy.

★    Onion & Cheese Kulcha : It was amazing. It was really stuffy yet maintained its softness.

The service here is measureable on a different scale. Great hospitality and courteous behaviour on the part of their staff. An extra 0.5 for that. Pocket pinch is definitely on a higher side.
What to expect – reasonable interiors, comfortable seating, polite service, not too helpful recommendations (everything is good).

Good place to have north Indian food in park Street area. Interior decoration is excellent. Comfortable sitting arrangement. Overall charming ambience. Proper place for a romantic date.
Price is on the higher side. Though they serve generous amount of rice item or side dishes per plate,sufficient for two people.
Yesterday we had their LUCKNOWI  GHOST BIRIYANI, which was flavourful and contained 4 tender and tasty pieces of mutton. Raita was served along with.For side dish we order CHICKEN AFSA. It contained small pieces of chickens and mushrooms and a thick gravy containing egg. It went well with BIRIYANI.
Staffs are very curtseous. While waiting for our food, they gave roasted papar and onion salad as complement.
Recommend for north Indian food. Pocket pinch is bit high.

I had looked up thus restaurant on Zomato a few days back. A sudden dinner plan this Sunday with family, led us to try Aaira. The restaurant serves north Indian cuisine. We ordered for paneer tikka, black dal, and sabz keema and rotis. All vegetarian. The food was superb, fresh and actually had such delicious north Indian food after a very long time. I will say one of the bestest north Indian food in Calcutta today. Service is good, seating and decor is also comfortable and sober. A little noisy though. Reminded me of my childhood days when I used to go to Sonargaon at Taj or Zaranj. From me, a well deserved 4.5

Came here after office for dinner with an old friend. Very nice place ambience wise specially the Decor is soo rich with the perfectly designed sitting sofas . When we entered it was totally empty and we chose a corner near the bar. Yes it has a customised bar with sitting facility. We had beer .Nothing was available other than carlsberg and tuborg which was a big let down for a joint like aaira. For starter we orderd fish which was really tasty and rich . For main course we orderd biriyani which was again nothing special and a let down. Expected better taste.

Had been here recently for a lunch, and in this restaurant situated beside KFC, everything is perfect. The food is tasty, its really good. It offers Indian cuisine. The ambience is great, simple and soft ambience. the staffs are courteous. The service is quick, which is an add on.

We had ordered Paneer cheese tikka as starter, Rice and Fish goan curry, and vanilla ice cream with chocolate. All were excellent.

Only one thing, which i feel the restaurant can improve, is the portion of food. The prices are not very different from other restaurants situated in Park Street, but portion can be increased a little. Otherwise its a very good place to have a calm lunch or dinner with your special ones.

BEWARE YOU WILL BE SCAMMED! If you're obviously not local, steer clear of this place. I paid cash on delivery and their delivery man, Salim, returned after 10 minutes and said I had paid with a fake thousand rupee bill. Being naive, I believed him and paid again. I was later told this is a classic money laundering tactic in India. The food is fine but the way they operate is shameful.

Aaira is a perfect option for a fine dining evening. The ambience is classy and food is amazing. I especially liked the paneer kurchan dish. The service was fantastic. The staff was extremely courteous.

Aaira is an Indian restraunt. The ambience is calm and cool. The food in aaira is superb, I am not a Indian food fan but I beacme one yesterday when I visited aaira. We orderd dhai ke kebab and a platter for the starters, all of them were very tasty. For the main course one must try the yellow dal, aloo dum and paneer makhani, they are great.
It is a fabulous restraunt I would love to visit it again and again.

Well..it has been a while since a restaurant has charmed me so much....
Aaira...the name itself infuses you with a sense of sophistication and royalty.

Located on the 1st floor of the building that previously used to be Sourav's, Aaira is a fine dining restaurant dishing out North Indian cuisine.

I visited on a weekday night for dinner and found the place to be relatively empty. The interiors were soothing to the eye with minimalistic decor and a few choice frames adorning the walls. They had a special Ghazal Nite ongoing with live singing. The 'lady in red' ( unfortunately i have forgotten the singer's name) had an especially sweet voice and was even taking requests from the customers. All the above combined lent a grand 'nawabi' feel to the place.

Now coming to the best part about this joint - the mouth-watering food. We had ordered

Starters - Chicken malai kabab 8/10
Mumtaz tangdi 9/10
Both were succulent and tasty and whet my appetite for whats to come.

Main course- Hyderabadi biryani 9/10
Peas pulao 8/10
Chicken rashida 9.5/10
Dal maharani 9.5/10
Butter naan 9/10
The dal and the chicken totally blew me away and I would go back for them time and again.

Desserts ("Meethe sapne" as in the menu) -
Gulab jamun with baked cheesecake and pineapple rabdi 7/10 - a bit disappointing. Cheesecake was rubbery and rabdi was a dilute yellow liquid with no flavor of pineapple whatsoever.
Malai gur kulfi 8.5/10

Overall, the starters and main course more than compensated for the dessert fiasco. All in all, i had a sumptuous and tasty meal.

A special mention about the presentation of dishes and the crockery which were a visual delight.

The cherry on top was the meetha paan served at the end which my parents relished.

The cheque came around to 3.5k (decent enough)

Considering the place is relatively new, I had a great time. My only suggestion would be to train the servers who proved to be rather clumsy. They not only dropped a carved carrot into my glass of water, but also dropped a fork with some food on my jacket.

Nevertheless when i left the place, i had a huge grin on my face (not solely because of the tasty meal i had just devoured)...coz i had finally discovered something i had been on the lookout for quite a while --- a fine dining restaurant specialising in àla cartè north indian cuisine. I am pretty sure this is going to become one of my favourite haunts...

Keep up the good work fellas!

The place has good ambience, decent service and awesome food. We ordered garlic nan and a chef special vegetarian dish, that was mushroom based. Kaju dhingri mattar. It tasted very nice. The best part was the complementary onion slices(like we get with kebabs), papad, and dips. At the end, after the meal, they provided us with complementary meetha paan, that tasted really good. The slow music that was playing was an add on. This place is almost a 5 star. I would just like that the timing is 12 to 4 instead of 3. We went at 2:30, and had to make it quick. Not a big problem though.
All in all, a nice discovery. :)

Went to Aaira on xmas eve. It is located in the myx building just beside KFC. The ambience is really nice and cozy. Coming to the food, we had ordered Vodkatini and Pinacolada for drinks, aaira spcl mixed kebab platter,fish potli biryani and dabba gosht. The cocktails were just fine nothing extraordinary. The kebab platter was excellent. Highlight of the evening. The biryani and dabba gosht were flavourful and tasty. Complimentary papad,onions and dips were great too. Pricing is quite reasonable for the quality served. Service was slow though. Overall a nice place to dine

Been a regular at Aaira for quite a few months now. It's one of my favourite Indian restaurants at the moment. On my last visit, I had ordered for Mulligatawny Shorba: The broth was very flavourful.  Afghani Machli: soft pieces of bhekti, well made, with right amount of punch of spices.  Murg Makhani: Boneless pieces of chicken cooked in makhani gravy, the gravy was well made, though it could have been slightly better, a spoon of butter could do the trick for them. Dal Makhmali along with assorted breads which included Butter Naan and Laccha Paratha, and Veg Pulao! The Pulao is really tasty, with good quality of rice used. Overall I love their food. Wouldn't mind being a regular there!

On 25th of December all the restaurants of park street are fully packed and that is when me and my friend planned to have lunch at aaira which was in my wishlist for a long time but unfortunately the plan was not being successful for some reason or the other. It is situated in the mynx building beside park street kfc on first floor. The joint is not very huge but quite decently and warmly decorated. The staffs well behaved and polite. The tables were nicely placed and very comfortable. We ordered fish biryani which is their speciality, dabba gosht also one of their speciality and naan. The dabba gosht is a dish in which the mutton pieces and the gravy are wrapped in egg and it is a spicy dish with chunks of mutton which was not totally boneless but I must say that the mutton was really well cooked as it was soft in texture. The fish biryani arrived in a structure which looks like a potli which is edible ofcourse and inside it was the fish biryani. The biryani was absolutely wonderful quite different than the usual calcutta biryani but I loved it as it was very light and the chunks of fish was absolutely fresh. The naan was okay which was served in 2 pieces. The food took a bit time to arrive but no complains because the foods were impressive and they even served papad once we were seated along with onion salad. The fresh lime soda was also well made. We were damn full but still the desserts mentioned in their menu attracted me so much that I was forced to order it. So we tried the mini gulab jamun baked cheesecake with pineapple rabri. This was very unique and kuddos for their innovation because it was delicious but I did not really get the flavour of pineapple in it nevertheless I was very happy with my Christmas day lunch. Our total bill amount was rs. 1500 approx. I hope they keep up their innovations and good work.

Have been to this place at Christmas eve. Even though its location is at prime place and we visited at peak hours, this place managed to give a relishing experience. The most appealing part of this restaurant is its service. Before you can raise your hand to call for the waiter,they are already there. Food was bang on,especially their Dal makhmali. The experience was fantastic and worth the money. Overall, this place was a treat to taste buds.

I happened to visit this place just near Durga puja. Thanks to Zomato for the surprise food coupon, otherwise I would have never come to know about this food treasure.

Situated at a very prime location at the crossing of park Street and Middleton row. It's in the same building as Myx and OTT.

It's not a very big seater restaurant, but not tiny either. Ample seating and spacious. Although I didn't like the concept of the lift making its way straight into the restaurant but it was OK. The interiors were neatly done with a waterfall in the middle. The sofa was quite comfortable.

We ordered for Subz Babycorn Jhalfarezi and Dal Makhmali and both were superb. The portion of babycorn could easily serve 4 people so please keep in mind before ordering. The babycorn was tender and it had a very spicy-cum-Sweet taste to it. Very nice dish and a must try.
Dal Makhmali was amazing. Smooth as silk and full of taste. I'm still drooling over just by the thought of it. Of course it was the hero among the dishes.
Masala kulcha and Naan were also very well prepared.

In all I enjoyed the food and the ambience and I'm looking forward to visit this place soon.

Visited Aaira yesterday evening for a friends reunion. Was literally awestruck by the quality of food. The kebabs just melted in the mouth. The chicken tengri kebab and the fish kebabs were just wow. The biriyani was a little spicy but my friends loved it.  Though it's a tad expensive but its surely is value for money and is a must visit for spending quality time with family and friends.

Classy and Elegant- thats how I describe Aaira..Located on the 1st floor in the Myx xomplex this place is satiating the need for a twist in the conventional and regular Mughlai cuisine that we are so used to in the City of Joy..
As I mentioned right from the moment you entered this place the elegance, the aesthetic presence will set the mood for a perfect meal over some tasteful and unique Mughlai dishes..the soft tunes of the ghazal playing in the background, the golden color palate will give you a Royal theme..even the floors and the wall paintings are so beautifully done,speaks of the taste of the management..The hygeine factor is so important for any restaurant and has been looked after so minutely at this place..The servers are most courteous, ever-attentive and knowledgeable about the dishes served to help you choose..We ordered:
Fresh Lime Soda: Just the perfect way to start your meal..refreshing,cool and the presence of the Gondhoraj Lime and Cherry makes it even more delightful..
Murgh Cilantro Kebab: Ordered it on the server's recommendation since we were looking for a less spicy Kebab..marinated with Coriander paste, this kebab was full of flavours..not to spicy but tastefull..juicy, soft and charred to the right degree..
Fish Potli Biriyani: Ahhh..the star of the evening..A light, delicate and mild Biriyani wrapped up with an Edible Potli made from Wheat Flour..The rice grains were fluffy, falling apart, full of flavours and the fish was soft, fresh and cooked beautifully..Though a Biriyani is essentially meant to be cooked in the stock of meat, this fishy version will make you go back again and again for this magical concoction of rice and fish..Passioantely Recommended!!!
Dabba Gosht : A delightful mutton preparation which is wrapped with a nice, fluffy omlette..ordered on the server's recommendation and yet again it amazes both our palate and our senses..The mutton was so soft that it was literally falling apart with fork..the gravy was a rich, brown gravy with a hint of fried onion and coriander leaves..loved the balance of the dish with a nice tinge of acidity..
By then we were so full that can't accomodate the desert anymore..The prices are indeed on the higher side but I guess the expertise with which the Chef produces such amazing dish deserved a special recognition..Overall our total cheque comes to Rs.1620/- (incl tax) for 2 people..Will be surely going back soon to sample their Mutton Raan and their desert menu..

Lunch or dinner at Aaira is simply a treat to all your senses. The pleasing interiors, the soft instrumentals, the cozy seats & the sound of the fountain creates the perfect ambiance. The staff is courteous & attentive and the food is delicious. The #CheesyPaneerTafran served with 3 different dips is a must try from among the appetisers. #PunjabiAalu was suggested, from out of the menu, by the table attendant & turned out to be really nice. #MethiMalaiMatar turned out to be average. The #ButterNaan is one thing that needs special appreciation. The naan was customised even better than my wish(thin & crispy) & I can say without a doubt that it was the best naan I have ever had. Food preferences being a personal thing, such attention to it was highly appreciated. To sum it up in one line: this restaurant at Myx has the right mix of everything.

Aaira situated on the 1st floor of myx specialises in Indian cuisine. I decided to try out this place after I have seen the spectacular reviews on zomato. Well it was really worth a try. I had lucknowi gosht biriyani and murgh afsha. The meat in the biriyani was just yum! And the gravy of the chicken was just so good. The staffs were over zealous and very courteous. Overall a great dining experience! :)

Beautiful decor, excellent food and zealous & eager to help stewards sum up our experience at this restaurant which is very conveniently located at one of the prime locations of the city - on Middleton Row off Park Street opposite to Peter Cat. 

We ordered 1 Murgh Jahangir Shorba, 1 Non veg Kabab platter, 1 whole Bekti Tandoori to start off with. The Kabab platter consisted of 12 pieces of kababs of 5 variants (mutton sheekh kabab, fish makhmali kabab, prawn banjara kabab, chicken cilantro kabab & chicken tikka).

All the kababs were delicious but the Prawn Banjara Kabab was the best of the lot - perfectly flavored, juicy and chunky. We liked it so much so that we ended up ordering a plate of the Prawn Banjara Kabab itself.

The butter nan was a tad disappointment as we were expecting the fluffy nans which we r used to; instead what we got was more like a lachchha paratha - the only difference was that the nan was baked as against the paratha, which is usually fried. The dal makhani was awesome as was the chicken hyderabadi in the mains. The chena payas was good for me, though a tad too sweet for my wife.

They had reserved the best for th last. As it was the occasion of my wife's birthday, they came up with a proper and delicious chocolate truffle cake for her to cut and celebrate. Awesome!!!!

A beautiful experience that we wud remember for a long long time to come.

Aaira, located on the first floor of The Myx building has proved to be the reason behind one's gastronomical treat thanks to brilliant display of finesse. The pristine patterned beige decor tempted me to let the calmness sweep me off my feet and place me comfortably in the lap of good food with its impeccable presentation. It had been on my wishlist for quite some time now and was finally struck off on the occasion of a birthday in the family. The cushioned seating arrangements were in contrast color to the all-beige decor. The dim lighting somewhat sufficed for the unwinding process with an added plus of the glass-flowing fountain in the middle. Aaira simply spelled of calmness and serenity.
Coming to the food, this restaurant specializes in the North Indian Cuisine which one could pair along with an array of drinks they had on offer. The place definitely managed to recreate the dishes keeping the intrinsic spices, herbs and flavors unsullied. After a bit of contemplation, the following was ordered (for eight heads):

- Chocolate Toffee (Mocktail)
Was nothing more than a Chocolate shake. Vanilla ice-cream blitz along with chocolate syrup and milk. Tasted decent.

- Chilli Pink Pepper (Mocktail)
The Mocktail was nicely prepared with the chilli zing being on the lower end in the cranberry juice. Tasted average. Flavors could be balanced and improved. No spilt green chillies were found as depicted in the menu.

- Mint Julep Tea (Mocktail)
A mixture of mint, lime and litchi syrup stirred in sweetened tea and served chilled. Tasted nice. The flavors were balanced.

- Shirley Temple (Mocktail)
The disaster of the lot. The imbalance in the mixture of lime, grenadine and and orange syrup left the drink to be a disappointment.

- Tomato Dhania ka Shorba (Soup)
A tangy soup made from the stock of blanched tomatoes, chopped coriander leaves and coconut milk, mildly spiced with cumin seeds and green chillies. Was decent to taste.

- Mulligatawny (Soup)
An English soup with its roots in an Indian recipe. Locally known as Pepper-Water, Mulligatawny is a spicy & creamy hot soup with base flavors of celery, onion, carrots and lentils. One of the best I have come across. Recommended.

- Cheesy Paneer Taftan
Cubes of cottage cheese marinated in tikka masala, skewered with a stuffing of cheese and tandoored. Served with a drizzle of melted cheese on top and mustard onion on the side. Tasted good.
But, finding a hair in one of the cubes was a turnoff. However, immediate corrective steps were taken.
Served with triple dips (Hung curd, Mint Chutney and Spicy Garlic).

- Sabzi Hariyali Seekh
Mashed and well-seasoned vegetable kebabs skewered and cooked in a clay oven. Served with a drizzle of cheese on top and mustard onion on the side. Delicious the seekh kebabs were.

- Dal Makhmali
Black lentils simmered overnight, mixed with a gravy of tomato-onion and indian spices. Had spot-on balance of flavor. Delicious it was. Recommended.

- Pindi Chana
Boiled chickpeas tossed in a flavorful spice-mix and garnished with tempered green chillies. Was good to taste. Recommended.

- Paneer Makhani
Well-marinated cottage cheese cubes mixed in a creamy tomato gravy. Tasted good.

- Sabzi Babycorn Jhalfarezi
Not much different from the usual jhalfarezi or say mixed vegetables, this dish had an assortment of vegetables tossed in a spicy yet, semi-dry gravy. Tasted nice.

- Tandoori Roti
Was baked as per preference (crisp). Tasted nice.

- Roomali Roti
Wasn't up to expectations. Felt chewy in nature.

- Lachha Paratha
Had opted for Ajwain flavor. Was nicely prepared, was non-greasy and flaky. Tasted good.

- Masala Kulcha
The kulcha was nicely baked, could have been baked a few seconds longer. Nevertheless, had a flavorful filling of mashed & well-seasoned potatoes and sautéed onion. Was nice to taste.

- Butter Naan
Perfectly baked soft bread served with a slight brush of butter. Tasted good.

- Kashmiri Naan
Perfectly baked naan with a filling of cashew nuts, almonds and maraschino cherries. Sweet to taste and yes, the flavors imparting the taste were spot on.

- Garlic Naan
Nicely baked soft flat-bread with a generous yet, an apt amount of garlic on top. Was good to taste.

- Chilli Cheese Kulcha
Perfectly baked kulcha with a filling of cheese and chopped green chillies. A little was also put on top. Tasted nice. However, the seasoning could have been a little more balanced.

- Thinly sliced onion and papads were complementaries to the meal.

- Shahi Tukda with Saffron Rabri (Dessert)
Being a Aaira speciality, this dessert wasn't as great as it should have been. The rabri had nice flavors yet, could have been better. Had it been chilled, would have tasted better. Was just about average.

- Mini Gulab Jamun with Baked Cheese Cake and Pineapple Rabri (Dessert)
The cheese cake was made up of mini gulab jamuns and was served with gulab jamuns and a pineapple flavored rabri on top. Since the gulab jamuns were cold, the dish as a whole failed to impress. The rabri could have had little more flavors. Has scope of improvement.

The Staff was found to be polite, courteous and well-informed about the fare. Their Service was something commendable as they were swift in catering a large number of heads with minimal delay. 
The Prices were found to be slightly inclined towards the higher end. The above affair left the pocket lighter by INR 6450.

Overall was a nice experience.
- Would love to revisit soon.
- Desserts need to be looked upon and steps towards their improvement expected.

Located inside the MYX building in Park Street. This place provides the best of North Indian cuisine! The dishes are just so tasty, like it's still tickling my taste buds! The interior is also quite soothing with light lights and the bus boys are really well behaved and polite. Service is fine and when it comes to the pocket, it honestly doesn't make a hole! I would highly recommend Aaira, if you like North Indian cuisine.

Visited this place two days back on the eve of mahaashtami.. and got an unexpected ashtami mahabhoj buffet surprise!!
The stunning interiors of this place will make anyone fall in love with this place.. and not to forget the big comfy sofas!!
On ashtami, the buffet comprised of 4-5 types of salads( along with phuchkas! ), then for starters we had unlimited seeks kebabs and kasundi fish fingers(this one was superb!) Then for main course we had rice, luchi, chholar dal, alu phulkopir kosha, chingri malaikari, bhetki paturi (star of all the dishes!). Mutton biryani and chicken butter masala were also included in the main course and tasted pretty good!
And then came my favourite section-the dessert section! We had baked pantua (tasted heavenly), Apple tart (had it for the first time and loved it totally!), komlabhog and mishti doi!!
Waiters are very helpful and friendly and the buffet price was very much reasonable.
Had an amazing lunch time at this place and hence, ashtami was perfectly spent!!

When asked to suggest a North Indian restaurant for a weekday lunch, I decided on Aaira, and in retrospect I must say it was a decision made wise. Located on the first floor of the Myx building on Park Street, it's very easy to locate, just head onto Park Street from Park Street metro station, turn right from Flury's, walk a few paces and there it is on your left.

When one steps into the restaurant, the first feel one gets is of a palace. The decor reminds you of a Rajasthani palace, with mellow lighting and wall decor to go along with it. The floor too has impressions from a palace. I loved the restaurant's art to demarcate the rest-rooms. They have this one glass wall with the restaurant logo which has a stream of water falling on it, that just sets the mood.

Coming to the food, we started of with the mocktails and tried shirley temple and fruity cooler. The drinks were served cold and presented well. They were a bit too sweet, but otherwise were refreshing. Next we went on to Afghan macchli which was the best dish of the day. Served with a choice of dips, and mustard paste smeared onion rings and salad, the fish was cooked to perfection and tasted good.

Moving on to the main course, we ordered murg afsha and navratan pulao. The chicken was cooked well in a brown gravy with mushroom. The chicken shreds went well with the mushroom adding a different feel in the mouth. The gravy was well done with spinach and garnished with boiled egg and grated cheese. The rice was subtle with a lot many ingredients like cashew and raisins. Coming to desserts, we chose the mini gulab-jamun with cheesecake and pinaple rabri. The cake was soft topped with the small gulab-jamuns and garnished with the rabri. It was a perfect finish to a nice lunch.

Portion sizes were comfortable for two and the fare is priced on the higher side. The service is moderately paced and the stewards are polite. Hygiene and cleanliness is well maintained.

Overall it was a pleasant experience and would love to visit again.

Happy eating!!!

Myxx being one of the best clubs in town has an aura of fine delicacies at its premises with 3 restaurants catering to different cuisines. 
For a taste of North Indian visit this restaurant and trust me you won't be let down. The service is class. Upon being seated you are handed with a cold napkin to wipe your hands which is a rare and on finishing your meal we were provided a Paan which shows how much this place cares about its customer.
Coming to the food we ordered for a Vegetable Chilli Milli- a Fried Kebab served with 3 types of chutneys which was delicious and a Tandoori Chaman- which was again delicious. 
For Main Course we ordered for Makhmali Kofta &
Subz Baby Corn Jhal Farezi.
The former was creamy with the right amount of flavour and the latter was a spicy-my favourite.
The overall experience was highly satisfactory. The ambience is soothing with the right amount of decor and highlight. 
Highly recommended!

Nothing could have been better than this I hope. It was my wife's birthday, and such a grand celebration it was. The ambiance, food, service, in every area, Aaira is awesome. We ordered Jhinga Banjara,  Murg Rozali Kebab, Raan-e-Aaira & Lucknowi Biriyani. The kebabs were so nicely cooked. One must try these items. But the Biriyani was not up to the mark.

I have never had such a delicious brownie in Calcutta.Their service was good and the waiters were courteous.Overall a fantastic dinning experience.A must visit for food lovers

Outrageous service ! Complete mismanagement! Had booked and reached on time but due to the management's whatever problem the reservation did not get noted ( not just me 3 people after me also faced the problem) and they tell us to wait for 15 mins and we end up waiting for an hour ! These people talk as if they're doing us a favour by fitting us into their schedule even though we were not on the list ( due to their mistake ) ! 

Though in the end I actually feel it was just a mistake seldom made. The food was served really fast , the staff was courteous and over all a very pleasant experience. They did make up for their mismanagement by an amazing complimentary dish !

Went for the first time at this place for having a meal yesterday on the occasion of Rakshabandhan. Ordered a non veg kebab platter, garlic naan, Lucknowi ghosht biriyani, chicken afsa. The kebabs were awesome particularly the mutton sheekh kebab and jhinga. The chicken kebabs could have been a little better though. The dips they provide are tangy and tasty. The biriyani was good, and the chicken afsa was really tasty. I would like to specially mention about the sheekh kebab; this is the first time such juicy sheekh which in most other restaurants remain quite dry. The roasted papad and paan offered complimentary is a nice value addition. The quantity is totally worth the price making it a complete vfm experience. A must visit for kebab lovers.

The Indian food restaurant of Myx, this building previously had the Sourav's. I came here with my sister and my german Teacher.I loved the ambience, the courteous staff and the food. The best part is that they give free mitha paan in the end and I am a true blue mishti paan lover.We had ordered the mixed kebab platter and all the kebabs were good and soft. The main course and the desserts were equally good, not overtly sweet. We had ordered the dessert platter and the shahi tukda was yum!!

Aaira; chicken kabab was just ok, but fish biryani was pathetic... They waiters informed us that biryani has 4 piece of bhetki fish. Ordered bhetki fish biryani, though it looked tempting, it was a tasteless thing. Having two spoonfuls of it, i requested them to parcel the same biryani. And what do i there at home... A biryani with no fish!!! I have never experienced these kind of weirdness from any other restaurant till date. How can the fish dissapear from the biryani...???
They serve pan at the end of the course so that was the only good thing about it. Otherwise I didn't like the food.
The time when I went to Aaira, it was not at all crowded but the attendants were busy chatting up and least bother to know our requirements... Had to call for them for water, tissue paper, water and some more water...
Not recommended!!!

Ambience is pleasant...!!!

Thank you

Aaira is the Indian restaurant at the Myx and the ambiance to the service to the food will make you feel like royalty. 
I was pleased to be invited with a group of my fellow foodies and it turned out to be a great evening. The gala started off with the tomato shorba. It was light, subtle in taste and served at just the right temperature for you to enjoy. The chicken razoli kebab followed. It was beautifully made and i loved the fact that the chicken was tender and juicy. The paneer kesaria was next, but it lacked any punch of taste and was rather bland. The chilli milli kabab was an altogether different ball game. This was nothing like I had ever tasted. Its a veg kebab with a cheezy interior and crisp fried outsides. Simply brilliant. We were also served another chicken kebab that had mushrooms with it which was also quite good. But the star of the evening has to be the Raan-i-aaira. You simply cant leave the place without having this! Its the best mutton I have had in a very very long time. It was juicy, tender, perfectly cooked and seasoned melt-in-your-mouth mutton!
For the mains we were served their famed fish biryani. The biryani comes perfectly packed in a film of bread and is beautiful in taste. The bread basket was good. So was the murg afsaana and the do moti keema. But what stole the show was the creamy beautiful dal. And another mutton dish, the dabba gosht! The dabba gosht was so succulent and beautifully done that one would find it difficult to stop.
The dessert served was pineapple cheesecake with mini gulabjamuns was a disappointing end to an almost perfect meal though. It was neither a cheesecake, nor did it have any significant pineapple flavour. It was just had a lot of condensed milk.
The service is impeccable but the a la carte menu is a bit pricey. But if your only concern is food then Aaira is definitely a good place for dinner.

In simple words if budget is not a constraint then you won't get a better place to have mutton...
Going step by step...
When I saw the hotel the outside was kind a so so type but as I entered the restaurant the ambience was one of its class simply awesome...
The waiter were brilliant they only told us what to hav or not and believe me the food was simply class...
Never tasted mutton so well prepared and well served...
Our 1st order was a mutton kebab it was very very good...
One butter nun was Rs70/- and I was a bit hesitant to order it but den again I did but once ordered the size and quality was like something I can't explain in words then came mutton gost and like no words again to express it...
I would recommend you to visit it atleast once and have mutton there...

Aaira , one of the finest restaurant to hit when there is a crave for north Indian food.. The ambience is perfect according to the theme and the food live up to the standards as well... We have ordered for a hara bhara kebab as a starter and I must say it satiate ur taste bud . In main course we ordered dal makhmali , Subz babycon jhalefrezi , murgh makhani and breads etc.... All the food has perfect blend of spices and aroma. Above that the staff service is very amicable.  So one must pay a visit to aaira while trying out new places in Kolkata...

Judging by the good reviews, I zeroed down on Aaira for my birthday treat... and I wasn't disappointed!! Its on the 1st floor of the myx. Relatively small place with fewer tables as you would expect but the the detail in the decor from the marble floor with the engraving... to the walls with dull gold pattern the unique cutlery and the right amount of lighting was commendable... the service was good ... prompt
We had the chilli babycorn in starters along with cilantro chicken n chicken reshmi kebab... good overall... For the main course, we had their specialty chicken dishes... and a mushroom stuffed dish... Food was good and unlike many other places, each dish had its distinct taste and flavour... Good experience overall..

One of the best places in the city to try out authentic north indian cuisines. Located on the 1st floor of the MYX, this newly opened place is surely going to be one of the top north indian restaurants in the city in the near future!! The kababs are really delicious!!! We tried Murgh Rozali Kabab & it was one of the best I have ever tasted!!! The Biriyani was also equally good!! The decorum, ambiance, courtesy of the staff all deserves mention!!

It's in the Myx building, 1st floor.
The decoration and ambience is amazing. Service is also very nice, polite, cooperative.
I specially liked their thot of soap wet tissue to wipe our hands before having food! Being a microbiology student their sense of hygiene won my heart!
It's entirely north Indian food. Awesome mughal food I must say. Compared to the ambience, quality of food and service the cost is less.
We tried Lucknow e Gosth Biriyani. It had complementary raita with it. It's delicious. Biriyani is very good. The Mutton is tasty.
We tried Murgh Rozali kawab as starter. It's was jus out of the earth. It was filled wid cheese at the centre. Kawab had its unique flavour and taste!!
Quantity is quite good. Overall, lovely place for a fine diner :)

Aaira,located in the Myx complex in Park street opposite Peter Cat where Sourav's used to be previously was the venue for our food group's latest meet up.It turned out to be a fantastic gastronomic  experience.

The moment I entered the sophisticated ambiance caught my fancy.The white marble flooring with grape patterns and the brilliant frames donning the walls give this place a sort of royal elegance.

Coming to the food,we started off with the tomato shorba which was light,tasty and tangy-a perfect appetizer to set us on our way.Next came the chilli mili kebab which was a veg kebab with a crispy exterior and a soft inisde.I loved the dollop of cheese inside this dish.The chef explained the tedious effort it took to make this particular unique dish.

The razoli kebab was a chicken kebab consisting of subtle minced chicken in the centre and spciy tandoor chicken on the outside.It was brilliant.The raan e aira was up next and it was the undoubted star of the day for me.It was mutton at its best-soft,tender succulent and wonderfully tasty without being too spicy.It was simply sublime.The kesaria paneer kebab was soft and mildly spiced which made the taste of the kesar come out beautifully.The Green yellow chicken kebab came next with mushrooms and a slightly oriental twist.I being a huge lover of mushrooms loved this one of a kind innovation.The sweet and sour mango dip,the curd and garlic dip and the green chutney dip were all wonderful and great accompaniments for the excellent kebabs.

For main course we had the milijhuli roti,dal makhmali and malai kofta among the veg dishes.The dal makhmali was one of the best dal i have had anywhere.It was rich and delightful so much so I being a hardcore non vegeterain ended up having a whole lot of the dal.The malai kofta was creamy and lovely too.

For non veg we had the fish potli biryani and the dabba ghost both of which were brilliant.The dabba ghost was a rich mutton preparation wrapped in a light egg white omlette.The mutton again was impeccably well cooked.The Fish potli biryani came when we were full to the brim but we still ended up devouring this unique preparation.The edible potli forming the purdah in the purdah biryani lent this dish a different dimension altogether.I also liked the fact that they do not compromise on bhetki in the choice of fish used.

For desserts we had the gulab jamun cheesecake with pineapple rabri.The dish looked brilliant but I felt it failed to live up to its appearance and the exceptional dishes that preeceded it. I am huge fan of cheesecakes and I could not taste the cheese in this dish.It was more like a sandeshcake than a cheesecake.But this could not take the gloss off a wonderfully enjoyable meal.

Aaira serving up delectable Indian food with a difference was a lovely experience for one and all and this is one place i would surely recommend.
Enjoy!
Cheers! :)

Firstly to start with I will say I had great expectations from the place .. 
But I was little on the back foot given the quality of food in terms of taste .. Jhaal farezi was not up to the mark , masala kulcha was not well stuffed .. Starter called veg chilli niklo is a total turn off .. 
The staff were well informed and courteous .. 
Let's hope they work a bit on their food taste , rest everything else shall fall in place !

To start with the Decor, the flooring with grape shades, the wallpapers and the artistic interior, it's a very appealing and attractive decor. The ambience is perfect.
Then the menu and the food: the dishes in the menu are just the best chosen items, to start with you could have Murgh Razoli Kebab, Veg Chili Mili, Veg sheekh kebab, paneer saffroni. The main course could be tucked in with Dabba Ghosht, Dal Aaira, Methi Chaman, Paneer Makhani, Pindi Chana along with Cheese chili kulcha, Pudina Paratha, for sweet tooth Kashmiri Naan, veg biryani and for Fish lovers the all time Parda Biryani,. All this could be had with Cranberry Mojito or Fresh lime soda.... The service is excellent, courteous, friendly, and quick.. Over all a wonderful experience, will be back soon.. Thank you... A must visit for all

AAIRA, very confidently I can say that this new restaurant could be one the next big thing when we have to count on the finest North Indian Cuisine Restaurants in Kolkata.
My review is totally based on the vegetarian menu of this restaurant.
This place has taken North Indian Delicacy to just another level. Everything that we tried over there was absolutely mind blowing. 
Try Vegetable Chili mili, it will undoubtedly leave you craving more for it. Kebab Platter gives an overview of the standards of the quality of starters in any restaurant, and here the standards are way above par. The mushroom starter was the best thing I have had in Mushrooms ever in life. All the vegetables were fantastic. 

NOW THE BEST PART ABOUT THIS PLACE. I am sure most of the Indian food lovers, somewhere have a soft corner for Dal Makhani. Now AAIRA has taken Dal Makhani to I don't know which level, but it is definitely one of the nicest Black Dal I have had in my LIFE.  It is called DAL MAKHMALI, and as the name says it means every freaking bit of it. YOU JUST CAN'T AFFORD TO MISS IT.

Vegetable Subz Biryani in the end will just make sure you have a good long sleep. IT IS BRILLIANT.

Very decent service time, staff is well mannered, the place has been done up quite nicely. 

The only thing I thought lacking was, the varieties in the list of their vegetables, probably they could add more varieties of paneer and aloo.

Overall, this place has become my favorite for North Indian food. I just wish they maintain their standards. 

go and try it out!!!

Fantastic!  And this coming from me even though I am not a huge fan of north Indian food. The ambience did not excite me much first but the staff was courteous and helpful. Wet towels were handed out afterwe took our seats, it's these little things that makes one remember a place. And the food was beautiful, the shorba, biriyani and desserts were all wonderful but the one item that stood out was the Raan kebab. I am a fan of this place now and I keep recommending it to everyone.

Indian restaurants like us Indians reside in every corner of this country.  Therefore be it fine dining or your regular dhabas, handling Indian food  and not getting acidity the next day is inevitable. What makes Aaira different is that it spells perfection in every way possible. Located on the first floor of Myx down Park Street, the ambiance reminds you of a cosy little durbar so it won't be a bad thing for one to feel like royalty out here .

Coming to taste, be prepared to be pampered by flavours fit for a blue blood line. As a part of a food bloggers meet,  we got a tryst of what Aaira represented- Heaven.  The most delectable variants to try are the Chilli Mili Kebabs( crispy vegetarian kebabs oozing with cheese) , the Paneer Kesaria Kebab is unlike any Paneer kebabs I've tried- pure melt in the mouth and subtle spices- melted my heart. The Dal Makhmali is the best black dal in the city. 

Coming to the non vegetarian delights, be sure to feast your eyes and taste buds on the Razoli Kebabs(minced chicken kebabs wrapped in a spicy tandoori chicken kebab served with kasundi onion slices), Murgh Afsana , Dabba Goshst (spicy mutton curry covered with a parda of egg white omelette). The show stoppers here are the Raan E Aaira- the mutton pieces tender and melt in the mouth;  and the Potli Fish Biriyani - yes Fish! And believe me the taste will take all you sea food lovers to the 9th heaven.

Our dessert on the menu was a mini gulab jaamun cheesecake with pineapple rubri. The contrast of these flavours paid a fitting end to our gastronomical voyage. 

All in all if you crave for Indian flavours with no compromise on taste and also not go back home feeling heavy on the stomach, look no further.

I have visited Aaira on two occassions- one was on a Christmas Day when Aaira was offering a special buffet, and one recently for a special food group meet. I can barely remember the buffet meal except that I had turkey which was delectable. However the recent special food meet is etched into my brains and I can never forget the food even if I wanted to. 
We started with a Tomato Shorba which was light and tangy, it worked well for an appetiser. Next came a platefull of Chili Mili kebab which is a veg starter dish. Chef Sheikh Abbas explained that they are made with potatoes and narrated the tedious complex process with which he makes it. They are an absolute delight with a dollop of Cheese inside. Then we had Razoli Kebab which was a Chicken Kebab and goes perfectly well with their sweet and sour Mango dip. We were served Raan e Aaira next, which was mutton at its best. Soft, tender and rich in taste. It leaves you craving for more. We then had a Chicken Kebab with lemon and mushroom and Onion (can't remember name) which was a surprise and went perfectly with Curd and Garlic Dip. The Paneer Kesaria kabab was soft and balanced. For main course we had Milijhuli Roti and Do Moti Kheema. Millijhuli roti was soft and tasted heavenly all by itself. What I loved from the vegetariam portion was Dal makhmali and khofta. I have never tasted a Dal such as this and I can repeat the same for the Kofta. The Kofta was thick and creamy and the Dal had ghee and was rich and addictive. We also had Dubba Gosht which was the star of the evening. Although full to the brim we had Fish Potli Biriyani which was a subtle purdah biriyani with a potli full of flavour! We finished with Gulab Jamun Cheesecake with Pineapple rabri, which wasn't much like a Cheesecake but worked well for deessert. 
The ambience and the service is very commendable. Bottom line : Aaira is a must visit for food lovers as it serves off-beat high quality food with a fine dining experience.
Must Try : Raan e Aaira, Dubba Gosht, Kofta, dal Makhmali, Milijhuli Roti. I'm craving for Aaira food ever since I've returned from dinner.
Do Visit :)

One word that is coming to my mind while reviewing Aaira- that is 'Excellent'..The decor, the ambiance, the atmosphere all are top notch. Staffs are cordial, serving time is relatively fast and the quality and quantity of food they serve is absolutely wonderful. The portions are really huge, one plate can be shared by three people easily.. We ordered machli kalimiri tikka and murg rozali kabab for starter- rozali was excellent, very spicy but tremendously tasty.. for main course we ordered butter naan, dabba gosht and makhmali kofta, all were delicious. only negalive point was the mocktail-shirley temple which we didn't like. pocket pinch is around rs-1000 per head.. overall the experience was very much satisfactory..

I was thinking whether I should be there or not then I gave a call to Kuntal and he advised me to visit once. My maternal uncle and his family was in town we made a plan for dinner here and trust me the food was awesome, service is really good, worth having. Prices are not high it's the normal rate which it should be. So all in all its the best the only problem is with vallet parking you have to wait too long to get the car parked.

Splendid ambience and delicious kababs. Try kabab platter and chef special items here. Quality & Quantity justify the price. Also one-on-one offers on premium liquors are quite handy.

The high expectations that comes along with the restaurant being a part of MYX, is fulfilled by the great ambience, food and service. Once seated we were served with wet tissues to wipe our hands with followed by which we were handed the menus. The menu has a great variety of options to choose from. Everything that we ordered tasted delicious and the service is commendable. Prices are justified by the quality, quantity and taste of food. Highly recommend this place.

A combination of traditional hand embroidered Mughal art piece and contemporary yet Indian furnishings. Aaira has created a new benchmark for Mughlai and North Indian food. From ambience to cleanliness. From courteous staff to prompt service. Their menu had certain dishes that one must have tried in a lot of other restaurants but mind you, the taste Aaira provides is completely different. 
My favourites are:
1. Hara Bhara Kabab - Moist and soft
2. Bharwan Aloo - A Different spicy filling 
3. Dal Maharani
4. Onion Kulcha - OMG!! Kulchas were thin and well stuffed

The indian restaurant in the myx building, where saurav's used to be .

The ambience is ok, the place is a bit small and feels crowded, when your dining there.

The food service was fast and the waiter was there running around to get the table free.

The starters was not that great and its not worth mentioning. Also try ordering the chef special items.

As for the main course the chef special mushroom was very good , dal makani was also very good to taste .
Also tried the paneer makani, which was ok but the mixed veg was also good to taste.

The breads ordered were chilli cheese kulcha was not great , the garlic naan was quite good though.

Apart from the chef specials others food items were mediocre and for the amount of money you end up spending, I think they need to improve the quality of food.

Hopefully next time it will be better.

an awesome restaurant with a whole new experience and ambiance , the food was great to taste from starter to main course with the best of quality.  I personally met the chef Abbas Sheikh who came from middle east with lots of experience had the pleasure of interacting with him shared his experience on food also provided some tips of cooking. I would recommend all my friends & family to visit the place to get the best of food & service. I visited the place on Sunday it was crowded though the service was great.

We had a delightful evening at Aaira. The ambiance was good, though a bit crowded, and the service was very prompt. For starters we ordered a Jhinga Banjara, a Jhinga Nizami (which I liked better) and a Mix Veg Assorted Kebab Platter.

The Main course just consisted of Murg Afsha (which is tender slices of chicken in a spinach, egg and mushroom gravy) and Cheese & Chilli Naans.

The Dessert was a Cheesecake baked with Gulab Jamun and Rabri - innovative and delicious.

The kebabs were subtle and melt-in-your mouth, the main course was equally satisfying. The Naan was soft and crispy at the same time and had excellent flavour.
We thoroughly enjoyed our experience and look forward to many more visits. Keep it up Aaira! Highly Recommended!

Aaira is located in Park Street, beside KFC.It is on 1st Floor.Decoration and Ambience of this place is very nice.As we sat down we are at first offered wet towels to fresh-n-up.

Next come to the Drink and Food Part.As we ordered Black Label and 100 Pipers for drink, an offer is going on for IPL Match for one drink another drink is free.Complimentary Roasted Papad is served by them. Beside that we ordered Mix Veg Platter which contained Paneee,Tandoori Gobi,Bharwa Aloo,Hara Bhara Kebab and Dhingri Shabnami Mushroom.The whole thing is too tasty and really enjoyed it.
After that Main Course we ordered for a Sabz Biryani,Dal Makhani,Methi Malai Matar ,Romali Roti and Crisp Tandoori Nun.All the food is superb specially the biryani is fantastic.

Little disappointed service over there is very slow.Overall experience of Aaira was below average.

Well this place is located in the heart of our city kolkata park street .
This place has amazing interiors no doubt about it . You will love the ambience . 
When it comes to service I was little disappointed as it was very slow . I waited for the waiter about half n hour to come and ask me for my main course after my starters .
The veg platter is super amazing you get sufficient for what you pay infact they are so nice that you can change your items in starters if you don't like something in the platter by increasing the other item which is there in the platter . 
When it comes to food it was not upto the mark when I visited for the second time . The Pindi chola had extra salt in it and same with kulcha . Do try their paneer and dal makhani and if you like sweet breads then definitely go for kabuli naan . Veg Biryani was also nice . 
When it comes to desert do try all their ice creams like the one with coconut malai and other one nolen gur which is made of gur it's yummy though expensive . 
They also provide you free pan and the end of your meal . 
Right now due to IPL tgey are also providing you 1:1 on some liquor and they have also opted a good idea for their publicity that is if you check in and show then of facebook you get free selected mocktail . 

Atlast I would ask the restaurant to kindly increase your staff , ask then not to leave their table and be on time so that the guest doesn't have to wait . I would kindly ask the chef to kindly check the food and provide it to the customers . And ask the management to see that the staffs don't get busy on their own life .

Been here twice. The first impression... place looks chic n elegant. The staff is courteous and are forthcoming with their suggestions of dishes one shud try. Loved their "Bengali Thali" served during the Bengali New Year. Both..veg and non veg.. preprations are good. The only downside is the service... which I found is a tad bit too slow for comfort. Waiting for a roti... not expected at a place as good as this. 

My ratings...

Ambience... 4.5/5
Taste... 4/5
Service... 3/5
Value for money... 3.5/5

Overall... 4/5

Would definately recommend the place.

Landed up here this Saturday since we were on an exploration spree and it definitely didn't disappoint. Nicely done interiors, polite and hospitable staff, they effectively help you out to choose the best dishes, a bit high priced but the quality and quantity are quite good.

The chutneyz they offer in the beginning are the most tempting ones. We were guided to Murg rozali kebab and murg afsa. Both were brilliant. Overall, a great experience.

Nicely done interiors. Polite staff. Average food. Above average tableware. But, poor service and a poor manager. Overall experience at Aaira was below-average.
The kebabs (vegetarian) in particular were very sumptuous. The three types of dips served with kebabs were also good. Portions of main course (particularly, Dal Makhmali) was very less. Kulcha was nice and soft. Lasooni Naan was very much below my expectation.
However, if the food has mixed reviews the service was overall in itself very poor. The table was not being attended to regularly and repeat orders were not being taken at appropriate time. [Possibly as the staff were busy with a large contingent of 23 people].
Primarily, the manager should be held responsible for this inefficacy. Hope the service improves with time.

It was a Sunday evening and we headed out for dinner. After much discussion (yes it is indeed very hard to finalize a place given the plethora of options at the disposal in today's time ) we decided to give Aaira a shot and this is how it went .

Location - 5/5 Prime location ( It is next to KFC park street which earlier used to be Sourav's .)

Ambiance -  4.5/5 (Wasn't the best i've seen but yes it was indeed impressive, a special mention to the artwork displayed right as you come out of the lift ).

Service - 4/5 The reason for deducting 1 point is because it took longer than expected for the starters to come (20-25 minutes post ordering).
Lets get to the most important part - FOOD. 

Starters-
We ordered Paneer Kesari Kebab - a slight cruchiness towards the outside and soft from the inside (just how i like it) . 
Hara Bhara Kebab - Not a big fan of spinach but yet surprisingly i loved it . You could make out the its a spinach based starters but it wasn't overpowering which is nice. 

Main Course (i know we were too fascinated with "Makhmali" )
Makhmali Kofta - nothing out of the ordinary . Decent .
Dal Makhmali -  one of the better dal i have had . Next only to Lala Mussa Dal of "THE YELLOW CHILLI ".

Mocktails - Chocolate toffee ( tasted like kitkat shake and was really nice )
Virgin Pinacolada - It's not on menu but they still were able to provide that on request . Decent .

Overall - 4.5 /5
Highly satisfied, would love to visit again .
P.S. Sorry no pics yet again . I somehow always manage to forget taking the pic .

Firstly for starters we ordered Chicken Rozali Kabab was was simply delicious along with a long island ice tea.. For main course we thought of tryng out sumthng frm their spcl menu tht was laid down for valentines day.. So we wdmt into to order pyaar ki mehfil.. Which was boneless mutton with mutton keema cooked into traditional style.. And it was simply mouth watering.. We also ordered methi paratha and garlic naan which was soft and tender..the food, the service, the ambience, all makes it a perfect place to visit agn!! And so i go in and give this plc a 5 star..!!

I have to admit that we were not much hungry when we went to this place. So the order was just for a harabhara kebab, jhinga biryani and pinacolada. After eating the routine Kolkata biryani for so long, this biryani gave me a very different and satisfying experience. There was nothing to boast much about the kebabs and the cocktail. For people , looking for a posh meal outing, this is a perfect choice. You are greeted with wet tissues and then complimentary papads. A bit on the higher side of the price, it shouldn't matter for those wanting an exquisite time.

Visited this place on Lohri day with my family and I must say it didnt disappoint.It is situated just opposite peter cat,first floor.
The look and feel of the place is simple yet elegant.One thing which will win you over is their excellent service.As you sit down,you are at first offered wet towels to freshen up.Thereafter complimentary roasted papad is served with three dips/chutneys - tartar,pudina and garlic.The pudina and garlic dips were not very strong.The garlic seemed to have tamarind added to it which was tasting very nice.Overall,all the dips were tasty.
We had ordered a Mixed Veg platter, Dal Maharani and Fish Kalimiri.

1)The platter contained two types of paneer,tandoori gobi,bharwan aloo, hara bhara kebab,and dhingri shabnami (mushroom).I cant remember the names of the paneer dishes but one was slightly spicy which was good and the other one was white in color which I dint like as it was totally bland.I also tried the hara bhara kebab,it had some delicate flavours and I liked it.I dint have the other dishes but my family members mutually agreed to liking them.One thing I can say is that all the items were grilled very well.

2)Fish Kalimiri was the item that stole the show ! The fish just melted in my mouth.The flavour was something like a Malai kebab with a twist at the end.Excellent !

3)Daal was one of the better ones in Kolkata.You could say that it had been cooking for hours !

One interesting fact was that the option of having a "kadak" or a "naram" tandoori roti was included in the menu itself.This is the first time Iv seen such an option in the menu.I also noticed that the waiters/stewards were all speaking in Hindi only.Seemed like they were told to do so and I liked that.

At the end,to top it all,they serve you with Meetha Paan ( fresh and delicious ones at that ) So I must say that I was impressed with 'Aaira' and will surely visit them again very soon.

This review is long overdue as one must not wait in giving great places their due credit . I have had two meals at this outlet and it is simply mind blowing .

Beginning with the decor , what I love the most about this place is the flooring . Delicate marble inlay with grapes pattern show how much care has been taken in the eye for detail . I also love the beautiful zardozi frames .

They have brilliant kebabs and the jheenga e aaira is to die for . Even the dabba gosht that came wrapped in an omelette was a brilint presentation.

A hands on a winner is also the potli biriyani . Very different from any purdah biriyani . The presentions and inovatins need to be mentioned. The service is warm and very efficient too .

Overall one of the best balanced gravies I have had in a very long time ...

Kudos !!!

It was Christmas eve 25-Dec-2014 when we finally planned to visit newly opened Aaira during lunch time. Aaira, The Myx is situated in park street opp. to Peter Car. Myx has variety of cuisines as North, Chinese, Hookah Bar, Disq and soon they are coming up with Italian.

We opted for the North Indian |Mughlai Buffet.The staff their are decent, they will offer you a warm welcome. Aaira's ambiance hit our senses with its mild lighting with artistic paintings and good seating. 

Food:---The buffet comprised of Wine(White & Red),  Salads, Soups, Veg & Non-Veg Starters, 5 Curry's (Veg & Non-Veg) and deserts.--First section had Papri Chaat, Tossed Salad, Green Salad, Channa Aloo Chaat, & Dahi Vada. You must try the Tossed Salad(taste & contents were mouth watering) & Dahi Wada(the best i had in kolkata so far). --In soups both Palak Shorba and Chicken-Corn was delicious. --We were served with Makai Malai, Seekh Kabab, Murg Malai Kebab, & Chef's Special. Murg Malai Kebab was delicious, soft & juicy. Cooked to the perfection. Spices used are rite as per taste. As we are spicy eaters we requested the chef to add up spice and he served it as per our taste. --Main-course we had Pulao with Curry's. You must try the Makai Palak, Bhuna Gosht Simla Mirch & Ajwani Fish Masala. The Roti Basket had good mix of roti's. Soft & Tender.

In the entire course we were more attracted towards the deserts as it was mouth watering. It consisted of Plum Cake, Hot Gulab Jamun, Rasmalai, Gur Rasgulla and there was a signature chef special i forgot the name but it was in a small shot glass with rasgulla dressed with rabri & cream shot. Dressed with waffers. 

They have a decent collection of bar drinks.Rating:-
Food: 4.5/5
Service: 4/5
Ambiance: 4.5/5

I would appreciate the efforts taken by the management serving delicious dishes at reasonable price. Thanks to Kalyan Bose & Chef. Abbas(he is a all-rounder. His dishes was a must try in copper chimney, muscat) being so friendly and introducing mouth watering dishes. I would highly recommend to visit this restaurant and try out the mouth-watering dishes. My next visit would be a À la carte as i would like to try their other dishes.

We were looking for a new Indian place for a while, and Aaira was on our check-list ever since it opened. We were excited and it didn't disappoint. Not at all.

The tomato dhaniya shorba is good, if you're a Zaranj loyalist don't try, but otherwise it's a good shorba.
The kebabs came next and the paneer was melt in mouth.  The paneer jult melted away, and the flavours lingered. The hara kebab was good, and so was the dahi kebab.

But the superhero of the meal were the mains. The methi matar malai was just a complete experience on it's own. The Paneer in green gravy was another rockstar. And the kulcha's were stuffed to perfection, yet thin, crisp and a perfect accompaniment.

After a long while did an Indian restaurant not disappoint. Do try!!

We were looking for a new Indian place for a while, and Aaira was on our check-list ever since it opened. We were excited and it didn't disappoint. Not at all.

The tomato dhaniya shorba is good, if you're a Zaranj loyalist don't try, but otherwise it's a good shorba.
The kebabs came next and the paneer was melt in mouth.  The paneer jult melted away, and the flavours lingered. The hara kebab was good, and so was the dahi kebab.

But the superhero of the meal were the mains. The methi matar malai was just a complete experience on it's own. The Paneer in green gravy was another rockstar. And the kulcha's were stuffed to perfection, yet thin, crisp and a perfect accompaniment.

After a long while did an Indian restaurant not disappoint. Do try!!

Go to the newly opened restaurant with friends for dinner. The food quality is good as well as quantity except Biriyani. The biriyani is not value for money.

We hit the newly opened Aaira, and was charmed by the gorgeous decor. The ambiance is chilled out, and the service is good. As part of a group, I had the opportunity to try a lot of things, and ended up with a huge number of stuff. The paalak ka shorba was a twist on cream of Spinach soup, and can be safely called my favorite of the soups we had ordered. I was not much of a fan of the Mulligatawny or the Murg jehangiri Shorba. The assorted non-veg kabab platter ordered by my friend had me sneaking bites out of it, and the chicken kabab there was excellent, and my friend loved the prawn kabab. The Dhingri Shabnami, stuffed mushroom coated and fried could have lost the coating and we would have liked it more. The bharwan aloo, although vegetarian, made me go back to it. The chooza til shashlik (chicken skewers coated in sesame and deep fried) was hot and addictive. But the Machhi Kalimiri was my favorite - flaky bhetki rolled in pepper and cooked - simple yet effective. I was more in favor of the Cilantro Chicken Kabab, with the blend of coriander and chicken perfectly offset by my drink - a simple nonalcoholic Mojito.  

All this time we dipped little pieces of papad in the assortment of dips they served us. One word here - the dips are quite tasty and you can fill up on them if you're not careful. 

I am a hopeless case for Malai Kofta, and it was silky and delicate and exactly what I had wanted. The Dabba Gosht was one of the other things I had selected - the meat was soft, with robust flavors, and came wrapped in an omelette. Of course I was charmed by things which come inside packets. 

The Fish biryani was another hit, and it came in an edible "potli" which we had a lot of fun tearing apart and consuming. The fish pieces held its own against the really delicate and light biryani. The Mutton Aafreen came in a creamy spinach gravy - a bit too cream for my taste, but the fact that the chef had been able to make all the mutton dishes soft was a big bonus for him. My friends (who can consume prawns without getting hit by an allergic reaction) declared the Jhinga Aaira to be mindblowing while I looked at them jealously and munched on one of the kulchas from the bread basket.

We had ordered two desserts to be shared between four people - the sitaphal and the kesar pista - I personally preferred eating the Sitaphal one although I am not much of custard apple fan. We finished off with the cold paans they served us.

After a night show in Forum we planned for dinner in Bar-b-que as usually but it was almost 12mid night so I called up airaa and they asked me to come down and after reaching there I was glad they were open only for Us. Hospitality were supurb, Food and drink was great and the ambience was mind blowing, so not overrated and too classy. Specially for the manager thank you for the service.

Aaira was an absolutely delightful gastronomical experience. The food and service certainly had a "royal"touch and so it absolutely lived up to its name. The food we had blew me away .... we started with the shorbas (soups) the Palak Shorba was wonderful and I quite enjoyed the Mulligatawny as well after adding a little bit of lemon to it. Chef Sheikh Abbas certainly knows his stuff and I for one plan to frequent this place. The standout factor for me is that not just the kebabs but the gravies and biryani's were also excellent. 
The Tandoori Aloo , Paneer Tikka , a stuffed Mushroom Starter ( can't remember the name ) were the standout Vegetarian Kebabs .... the non-veg kebabs were all excellent and perfectly cooked juicy with just the right amount of char on the surface to give them and excellent flavor. Pick anyone because they are all good but I absolutely loved the Tandoori Prawn and the Mutton Seekh Kebab which was super. The Mixed Roti basket was great and served hot and paired well with the mains. Our main course consisted of Jhinga Aaira which was a standout dish of Prawns in a minced fish gravy this is a must try if you like sea food. A Potli Fish Biryani which was brilliant .... so light and subtle that just writing about it makes my mouth water , two out standing mutton dishes one was Dhaba Mutton the other was in a fantastic spinach gravy sadly can't place the name ... the  mutton in both was perfectly prepared . We also ordered a delicious Malai Kofta which was absolute creamy goodness. The Fish Moilee comes highly recommended but alas we were too stuffed to try that ... note to self - go back soon ;-) !!! 
A special mention to the dips/chutneys they serve which go great with both the Papads as well as the Kebabs and Starters ..... Mint Chutney , a Garlic Dahi (Curd) Dip and my favorite the  Mango Pickle Dip which is just lovely . 
We ended our meal on a sweet note with two varieties of Kulfi ... Kesar Pista and Custard Apple and some very nice Paan.
One of the finest new options for Indian Cuisine in the city ..... highly recommended.

On my way to the restaurant on the first day of its opening for lunch, I was intrigued by the name itself. 'Aaira' has a distinct feminine tone in the enunciation & a strikingly similar sound to the word 'aura' connoting a mood or ambiance or environment generated by or surrounding a person, object or place. On Googling, I was surprised to discover that 'Aaira' is an Arabic word used for christening girls and it means 'noble', 'respectful', 'honourable', 'royal'. With this entire word analysis at the back of my mind, I entered the 1st floor of Myx. 

Like 'Chilli Wok' on the 2nd Level, even 'Aaira' rolls out the moment the elevator doors open and it certainly serves an exclamatory objective. However, in this case, it was a different exclamation - I stepped into a 'Royal' reception! The entire 'aura' of the place is that exuded by pure gold created from beautiful self-designed gold walls, a huge painting of a palace in the middle of the longest wall, framed zardozi paisley work were all awe-inspiring. White Italian Marble top designed tables with high tufted chairs, Rajasthani patterns transported me back in time to the Mughal-Rana-Nawab era of India. Soft ghazals filled the air with a mystic Mehfil-like charm. The service staff, conforming to the reputation of Myx, was very courteous, well-mannered as well as well-informed as they guided me through the 'Shuruat', 'Dahi aur Salad', 'Shorbe', 'Aatish -e-Tandoor', 'Murgh-e-Lazaket' , 'Samundari Zevar', 'Sabzi Hariyali', 'Dal-e-Dawaat', 'Biranj', 'Luqmaat-e-roti' and rounding it off with 'Meethe Sapne'. I was seriously impressed with the creative work of the menu with optimum illustrations around a great gamut of food selections resonating culture, tradition, history & richness of Indian cuisine. 

I was offered a Mint Jalzeera as a complementary drink and the freshness of the mint laced with the even fresher spices instantly heightened my level of expectation from 'Aaira'. I started off with a Palak Shorba(Rs165). Palak, an integral winter leafy vegetable of North India never tasted any better in a delightful creamy consistency - the subtle presence of Indian spices during the perfect level of boiling the leaf tacitly gave me the confidence in the skill of the Chef to make me order a Seekh Kabab. 'Nawabi Seekh Dilbahar' (Rs395) as it is royally called in Aaira, is not a very popular food choice in Calcutta unlike a Lucknow due to inconsistent minced meat texture on the 'Seekhs'. However, after today's lunch I can proudly boast of the same :) Flavour of herbs in the perfect texture of the seekh kebabs was a classic stroke that the Chef played! The accompaniments of the starters were a fresh mint chutney, garlic flavoured curd and a brilliant mango pickle dip. Freshness of ingredients, crunchiness of vegetables, the quantity in a portion again stood out that even includes the vinaigrette salad,  I could not help but feel that I was savouring  a delectable Dawaat at the Durbar of the King of India with my main course choices- Fish Mooili (Rs475) with Chilli Flavoured Tandoori Roti (Rs55). Calcutta Beckty cooked in a rich South Indian coconut based gravy with green chillis & curry leaves, tasting hot as well as sweet and as well as tangy made by taste buds go crazy!!! The chilli flavoured roti is a treat for the adventurous as the pungent flavour of Kashmiri Chillis in roti captivates the gastronomer's senses. 

The service was quick & efficient with a lot of individual attention given by the serving staff members as well as the managers. My total bill came to around Rs1200 and that I believe should be the approximate average cost for a meal for two. The bill came with a 'Meetha Pan'. I was too satisfied to order a dessert that includes Bhapa Sandesh, Cinnamon Kulfi, Gajar Halwa, Malpua with Rabri et al. 

There cannot be more apt a name other than 'Aaira' of this blissful fine dining experience of the City of Joy as it offers one an enriching celebration of the honour, craftsmanship, respect & royalty of Indian food,
