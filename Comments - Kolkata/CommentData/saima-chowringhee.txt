This place may not be a treat to you if you are looking for a great ambience, but when the food tastes so good, who cares? Very ordinary tables and chairs, person attending us (cant really call him a waiter) was in his briefs, an almost torn menu card was what we started off, but somewhere had the belief that the biriyani wont disappoint us, and seriously, it didnt. Found it to be a lot better than what the more renowned shirajs and rahmanias have to offer. This one was light, and tasted really good. Having said so much about the biriyani, let me come to what actally stole the show. Its the chicken chap. The gravy was awesome. Am not a cook, but surely it had the right mix of ingredients added at the right times while being cooked. Came out with a smile on my face that stayed for quite some time. 
Will surely be visiting regularly....

Located near Chowringhee, Kolkata. It's a good restaurant to go with family and friends. It can be said as one of the pocket friendly restaurant in that area. The quality of the food is good even the quantity as per the price. I went with 6 of my friends and ate Biryani, Tandoori Roti, Chili Chicken and Chicken Bharta. The chili chicken was bit spicy and the bharta was good in taste with half boiled eggs in it. Chili Chicken in this shop is not normally like what other shops serves it's bit differently than those.  The quantity of Biryani was moderate as per the price. The sitting area is bit small as compared to other shops. It gets to much crowded because of the small size. Otherwise it has nice waiters and the service is good.

This particular outlet of Saima is located  on Russel Street, near the AC market building and is a stone’s throw away from my office. As far as the food is concerned, I have ordered the biryani and have also tried a couple of their rolls on a few occasions. I especially like their biryani; the chicken is cooked perfectly and the flavour of the rice is a little similar to that of Arsalan

Overall, I do feel that this place is a little underrated since the food is priced decently and is quite tasty. However, I would not explicitly recommend Saima to anyone since the food is not that special. Nevertheless, if you are in the area, this can be a viable option for some quick and tasty Indian grub

A place at this locality offering such mouthwatering mughlai dishes at such low rates is quiet contrasting. But that contrast is something which took me to this place as I was quiet broke, haha!! And and and I was like wow! 
6 of us went and ordered reshmi kebabs for starters and for mains ordered mutton biryani, mutton chaap, chicken liver and mutton tikia and ended with desert. 
Reshmi kebab was a bit buttery and lacking a bit spicy flavours. 
Biryani and all the other dishes was finger licking. 

That's all folks, until next time.. :)

Saima has long been a popular restaurant, specially its Exide branch. Of late though the quality had dropped there. However this was the first time we tried the Saima Russel street outlet, which is a branch of the Saima exide. And this Saima seemed remarkably better in taste and quality. The biriyanis were good, non oily and sumptuous in quantity. The chicken bharta tasted okay. We plan to try out other dishes soon. Since it caters mostly to the office crowd, its service and delivery are professional and quick.

I am a student living in a hostel and yes you get bad food there quite often so you prefer nearby dhabas or restaurants. Saima is one of them. It's cheap affordable and good. But one thing i Don't like about saima is it's gravy . The chicken seems to float in a bowl full of oil . Chicken kassa and roomali roti is what i usually prefer. Rolls are of good quality.

This place is a hub for people who want their food quick.. Tasty and pocket frndly.. A quaint little joint with a variety of choices.. We had ordered chicken tikka kebabs.. Chicken reshmi kabab.. Daal makhni.. Masala kulcha.. And mutton tikia..
The kebabs were bursting with flavours.. The masala kulcha was really yummy and just one was enough to fill me up.. The mutton tikia and daal makhni were ordinary..
Would love to visit again to taste their biryani..

Saima has been a student's fave for quite sometime now,the reason being it's easy on the pocket. The food quality might have gone down the graph over the days, but its economic factor has still kept customers flowing into the eatery everyday. We had our lunch consisting of chicken tikka kebabs which were pretty good and soft. The biryani doesn't deserve a special mention as one shouldn't have much expectations regarding the taste here,but it's cheap. The service is fast,friendly staff and that might deserve a tip too.
The Mutton Saima Special consists of two pieces and an egg in thick spicy gravy which is a great accompaniment with Indian bread basket or rice. The Chicken Bharta was just a name. It was not tasty either. It was shredded chicken in gravy with less taste and more oil,like so much oil which even reduced the feel of salt in the dish and it sucked on being a good match with roomali roti.The firni wasn't prepared well and was a complete dissatisfaction,it might be one of the worst firnis I have ever had in my life anywhere or in Saima before. I had been a loyal customer for quite sometime now but the detoriating quality actually earns 3 or maybe lesser points to Saima and I would definitely reconsider my decision to visit again, but still being an old customer I won't mind being a bit leniant. Folks,try it out yourselves! :)

Since my office is 10mins from this place, so I am a pretty regular customer here. Tried almost everything by now and I must say that this is one of the most affordable places to eat in Park Street. The quantity served is perfect, keeping in mind that most of the customers are office goers coming in for lunch.

If you want it to be Pocket friendly,with sufficient quality of good food, saima is one of them.. Visited this place today for lunch and ordered palak chicken, chicken bharta, mutton tikiya with parathas and rumali rotis. I ordered tandoori rotis but they said it will take some time.. The tikiya they provided was rotten so they asked us to order something else.. The chicken bharta and the palak chicken was awesome..

Was in the neighbourhood yesterday and decided to have a quick lunch at this joint. I was suprised to find that a part of the restaurant was air conditioned. We decided to be seated there. Got the special mutton biriyani, the chicken tandoori and mutton kati kebab which has 20 pieces in it ! Finished the meal with a phirni which is a steal since it is priced at 25 INR only ! They charged us 12% tax on the bill which is perfectly fine. I am very satisfied with the place and hope to wander into it sometime soon.

1 Food quality good but not satisfied me...as because chicken items like bharta is too oily.taste is not so good.Butter paneer is too much oily,which I can not eat.
2 Tandoori roti and toenail roti at good but last time I can not order tandoori roti as because it does not available between 4to6 PM.(according to my experience,it can be different)
3 Upstairs are remodeled to a new look..so the atmosphere is great with simple look..
4 The capacity of upstairs are not too much.But U also can take the seats down but without a.c.
5.Service is decent.
6 Price is truly affordable.
So in 10,food quality 5(I do not taste all the food,only the basis of some Manu)Atmosphere 5,Price value 8,Service 6.5.
At last according to me u can visit there,it is pocket friendly.
*It's according to my experience.Ur experience should be better,share it.

Had the Chicken Biryani, Chicken Roll and another Chicken Roll with Cheese.

Service is poor as they don't pay attention your specifications like for us we told them not to put sauce in the roll and when they did, we asked them to change it and they refused.

About the food, the Chicken Biryani was okay but quantity was less.
Rolls were below average. The chicken filling was not good and full of onion and capsicum more than chicken. The cheese one was still better.
Pocket friendly given the kind of service and quality of food they provide here.. if you could compromise on that.

This joint is located on Little Russell Street just before the crossing with Ho-Chi-Minh Sarani . Visit this place to grab a lunch or to have Rolls as it is near my office . Good place to try out rolls of various types , egg , chicken , mutton etc . I like their chicken roll ( without sauce ) most , they also make it according to one's wish - spicy , non spicy or whatever they want . Seating area is small , a bit bigger place is available on the floor above . Biriyani & various mughlai dishes are also available . Biriyani is ok type not great though popular with the people visiting this place .

If you asking for a great food within low budget, this is the place you should visit. It's in little Russel Street. Mutton and chicken Biryani both are good. U have to specific about the meat piece while ordering else you will end up with a boney portion. Gravy items are good but tastes are almost same. Katti kabab is a must order item. Tandoori n murg massalam are superb in that price range. Its a very good budget restaurant n quality of food is great according to the price range.

This place is situated right outside the Rabindra Sadan Metroon the Exide crossing. You cant help but get attracted to the whiff of aroma coming from the delicious kathi rolls and chanp they make.

The food is of good quality and easy on the pocket. A full meal would cost you something around 150 rs.

The staff is friendly and service is prompt.
Good place to grab a quick bite. The service deserves a special mention because of the rush this eatery caters to on a daily basis.

All in all its a value for money eatery with great food.

Tried out their egg roll and egg chicken roll first. Both were piping hot, and just what one would ask for in a kathi roll. The wrap was crisp and flaky, just enough of oiliness,  and you can actually distinguish the taste of the egg from the chicken. The chicken pieces were juicy and succulent, and sized just right. The next time I went there I sat down for a proper lunch. Its a cramped up place, people share tables with strangers too. But all these negative points were managed because of the good food they served. Tried tandoori roti and chicken bharta and firni. It was actually one of the best tandoori roti I've had, and the bharta complimented it quite well. Food was served hot, and I easily gulped down two rotis, which were quite decently sized. Two strangers sitting opposite to me chomped down 4 lachha parathas each!!! So I guess that one also was quite good! The firni was not upto the mark in context of texture, but the sweetness was just right for me. All the items are decently prized, as anyone can understand from the menu card. And for a reasonable eatery, the food also was above the mark.

Had Chicken Roll from this place as I was walking towards Park Street. Must admit, that the roll was sumptuous and delicious. Flaky Paratha to go with succulent portions of chicken. A sheer delight to tastebuds. Apparently, this place is also popular for their Biryani and Mughlai side dishes. Popular among the locals, this place is a good option to have food at a budgeted price!

Went here twice. Had biryani on the first occasion, and did not like it particularly. The quality of rice and the amount of oil in the biryani were not the appealing factors. The mutton too was a bit stiff. A friend insisted to visit and I had to accompany, and that was my second visit. Ordered roti, chicken bharta, chicken korma, mutton rezala and chicken tandoori butter masala. The food is a bit oily, does not taste bad nonetheless. The breads are just fine. The firni was not available.

I have eaten in many dingy and old eateries, however they have a charm of their own. This place just lacks the warmth and homeliness. It is sort of a clumsy place to eat. The service is not good and the waiters are indifferent. Had to ask for a fork almost 10 times.

The good part of the place is that they accept ticket restaurant meal vouchers.

Like any true Kolkatan, I too love my rolls, be it mutton tikka or egg chicken. I have had rolls from Saima a number of times, and they were true kolkata Kathi rolls, greasy, clumsy and amazingly tasty. Have heard good things about their biriyani too, and plan to have it soon.

I visited this place after multiple referrals from my friends. The place is very near to the Tata Steel building of Maidan.
I ordered chicken biryani along with chicken chaanp. Biryani was good in taste and less oily. The quantity was also fair. The chaanp I ordered was not that tasty. Nor it was bad. I also tasted the Saima Special Mutton and tandoori roti from my friend and the Mutton was very good with a thick spicy gravy.
This place is very pocket friendly. Also the service is pretty quick. A small yet clean place to eat after exploring the Maidan through the afternoon.

The biryani also tastes good and the rolls are okay. But the biggest problem of this restaurant is that some of its preparations taste just same. Chicken bharta, chicken rezala, chicken butter masala and chicken reshmi butter masala- all taste more or less same. This is very disappointing and weird. The restaurant must take note of that.

This is very near my office and we get lunch or evening food delivered from here. Good food made in a clean environment. Had the lachcha paratha and tikka kebab stir fried with onions and capsicum. The paratha is crispy and not at all oily and the chicken pieces are chunky. Could be a bit softer but tastes good.
Basically this is what you call a deconstructed chicken roll.

It's a very good place to hangout. I didn't expect that their biriyani would be so good. Chicken tikka is also outstanding. Price is reasonable. I want to go there to taste other items.

Good food and good value for money. Ideally we don't go to a Mughlai restaurant for healthy food but it's kinda too oily, be it biriyani or any other side dish.

Serves chicken tandoori at great price, one of those places in Kolkata where u get mutton lever as a dish. Overall good experience on Budget

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION: 
In the hot afternoon searching for good food and walking with empty stomach is such a difficult job. After walking such finally found this place at Russell street just near vardhan market. Dealing with North Indian food and biryani they always stay crowded. By seeing such a huge gathering in the resto it can be felt that they really popular at this place.

AMBIANCE AND SERVICE:
Not a very big resto to be honest but yet they have some decent sitting space. They tables they offer if all common because of the huge crowd keep coming in.
They have got normal sitting downstairs and air conditioned sitting on the upstairs. Interiors and decorations are very average. Staffs are very prompt on their service. but you always get confused because everytime you have been served with a new staff.

FOOD:
Done with the chinese so many times so this time it was all north indian. We quickly seen the menu and ordered Chicken Biryani, chicken Bharta and rumali roti.
Chicken biryani was decent enough. Taste was nice but it consisted of huge potato in it which decreased the amount of rice in it. Chicken piece was also nice and made well.
Chicken bharta was nice and spicy. Chicken were not shredded so well they were thick. But the taste did a great job and done justice to the rumali roti we had.
Whereas rumali roti was big and soft.

QNQ AND PRICES:
Quality was fine and quantity somewhere a bit poor. From the biryani rice to the chicken bharta quantity was just for one person. Biriyani rice quantity need to be increased according to me. Prices are very reasobale and cheap.

CONCLUSION:
A visit here was quite a satisfactory to me.. With such a tasty food and reasonable price they are already going quite well. The best part is they dont charge taxes on the food.

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

If I need to put down the reasons behind my gluttony..Saima would be one of them. Starting from the parathas to the mouthwatering biryani, each and every dish is nothing less than delicious. However, the only turndowns are the kebabs and tandoori chicken, that i would never advice anyone to try. My jaws got a good exercise while munching on those reshmi kebabs that were not so "reshmi"..the tandoori chicken was almost charred...seemed like someone tried to murder the chicken by putting it to the fire! The raita they serve is okay..not so good. If you do not want to spoil your experience, never order these things. Apart from these few things, each and every dish is super delicious. Its very much pocket friendly and a good destination for cheap and tasty food.

If you are looking for quick mughlai food at rock bottom prices around russel street area then this is your place. Quality of food is moderate. Dont look for ambience and cleanliness.just order, eat, pay and leave.service is super fast.You may have to share seat with others and this place is always buzzing with crowd.They have an air-conditioned seating arrangement in the mezzanine. Pocket pinch ₹150/200 per person.

This restaurant is located just beside green apple cafe. The interior is not at all worth complimenting. The service was slow and the servers were very reluctant. We ordered chicken biriyani and with that onion salad. They forgot to serve the onion salad and later on we had to cancel it. The biriyani tasted okayish.

Nowhere near Nizam's or Kusum's (both located a couple of kilometres away), Saima's rolls are still too good to not have if you're around. And if you're lucky enough to live/work around Saima located opposite Buzz and Kenilworth Hotels on Little Russel Street, you can order from the convenience of your office. The place won' disappoint and there's no pinch to your pocket.

Tip: There's an airconditioned place at first floor. You need to know it to go there.

From a distance this place may seem to be a hole in the wall. But if you venture nearby you shall find that it is moderately sized. The first floor even has AC. My husband has eaten here with friends. But I prefer to take away. Even the staff perhaps prefers that way when it comes to a lady; for as soon as I stepped nearby a person handed me a takeaway menu and suggested why didn't you order for a home delivery mam. I had to explain that I lived in Santoshpur, and they would not deliver it there (wish they did!). Now coming to food, this place is not for those who would like to shy away from oil and spice. But the taste is heavenly.

What we tried --

Mutton biriyani

Dal Tadka

Mutton Tikia (high on calorie, high on taste)

Mutton Saima Special Curry (comes with potato and egg)

Chicken Bharta (curiously, they add green peas to it)

The total pocket pinch was around Rs. 550. And the food lasted us (my husband and I)  3 meals with a mere addition of homemade roti-paratha :-)

This place is located very close Indian Council for cultural relations, on the Ho Chi Min Sarani. One of the most pocket freindly joint in the locality. They made very good chicken and mutton biriyani, had these with mutton chap. Don't worry about hygiene, if you are looking for mouth watering cheapest food joint, visit this place without thinking twice.

Best Chicken Butter Masala in Kolkata...and its CHEAP...order rumali roti and any Mughlai item...It will fill the hole in your stomach without burning a hole in your pocket.
Also if you have a connection with the cook he can set you up with the cook's special chicken Bharta...
Corporate foodies...do try it at least once 😊

I give this rating entirely for the food! If you want decent and cheap food, this is the place for you. There is no ambiance whatsoever, at least nothing to be proud of, it is crowded, there are too many people etc. But the food is decent. We tried the chicken biriyani, mutton biriyani, Chicken bharta and chicken seekh kebab. All of these tasted good. 

But you'll have nothing really to talk about the service, and the atmosphere in general. It's in a tiny place upstairs. 

But the food looks decent!

The glory of cheap food which delightfully turns out to be good food as well, is unparalleled in the restaurant industry. That's how I see it, and I can safely say that a few million other foodies will agree with me.

Saima falls under this heading, and even though it doesn't churn out the healthiest variety of cooking, it still does a damn good job in terms of taste. You'll come across hundreds of restaurants like Saima, all similar in taste and ambience, yet completely different. 
Their seating is exactly the sort you'll be expecting - cramped and with minimal comfort. They manage to fit in somewhere around 30 seats in something like a 200 square foot room. Not too cosy, yeah? If you're not with friends, or completely alone, you're not in for a good time.

They have a policy of customer rotation, i.e. once you're done, get out. Ambience and service is presented at its most base form - but you're not expecting to be treated like a King or to sit on the Iron Throne if you're coming to Saima in the first place.

Coming to their food, which isn't a world beater in itself, but comes across as surprisingly edible once you've come to accept the fact that your wallet is almost as light as air. In all seriousness, their food isn't bad at all. Don't go for the biryani simply because you can have far better for lesser. The tandoori is good stuff, and if you're feeling especially stingy with your cash, go for the Mutton Tikkia with a few Naans/Rotis. You'll manage to eat for a while but good luck jogging off that oil. Their sweet dishes are pretty good though, the firni and the lassi make for a nice end to a heavy meal. Try out 

In conclusion, definitely a place to visit. If you're in the mood for Biryani, go to a Nizam or a Zeeshan or something, but come here for their Tikkias. Saima is, in my opinion, better for the younger crowd. The placement and the seating can be quite unforgiving for someone who can't handle too much discomfort.
Thanks for the read and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made :)

I would say the only thing good about this place is its competitive price.Nothing special with the food quality being just okay.Service is good but the floor height in the 1st floor is really low which was really giving me a problem considering I'm a tall person.Me and my friend ordered Chicken curry and Mutton liver with rumali roti.Mutton liver was okay but the chicken liver was drab and tasteless.So if you want to fill up your tummy then it would be good place.But if you are really looking for a good food experience then I would say this is not the place for you. :) :)

This is a place where people from offices around Maidan, Kolkata hop in during their lunch time. So if you are in this area and want to have a satisfying inexpensive meal then Saima can be one of the places to be.

Very fast service.
Friendly people.
Decent food (both in quality and taste). You can't expect more in this price.
A good menu to choose from.

This place is located very close to ICCR . The restaurant serves a wide range of mughlai dishes , including biryani , rolls, roti, tandoori . The restaurant is on the first floor with a decent amount of seats with proper spacing so that one can chat over rolls without being overheard ! We tried the chicken rolls , almost all varieties of them , and they tasted great ! The service is quick and overall , it's a great place for some filling mughlai ! :)

One and only destination for food during my tenure with U S Embassy!! Small sitting arrangements but the quality of food is just awesome! We used to feast on Saima Special Mutton Biriyani, Tandoori roti, Chicken Bada Kebab and Mutton Korma and last but not the least Firni!! Their rolls are also to die for.

In the big names of Arsalan and Alibaba we're forgetting these small restros like Saima and Royal but for me it's a must if you really like a bit wet/oily biriyani!!

I wanted to visit this place since long. The good reviews from my frnds and the menu I checked on zomato are the real reasons behind it.. and an off class just before the break in college, and we knew where to head to. We were in a dilemma where to sit as they have both an ac sitting area upstairs and a non ac one on the ground floor. Finally we decided to sit upstairs. I guess there is difference in price between the ac and non-ac sitting place. We went around 12:30 and it was quite empty. Nothing to talk of the ambience, it's a plain and simple restaurant. Coming to the food, we had mutton liver curry-owing to my love for mutton liver, I simply loved it. At 42 getting a plate full of mutton liver is wowwiiee. We also had mutton sami tikka masala. It was nice, amount was good too. And we had tandoori rotis,which were bit on the harder side, with the mutton dishes. One negative point is none of the food served to us was hot.
We finished our lunch with firni which was not at all good. All in all, I loved the mutton dishes and would surely like to try biriyani.
Edited:we went there again the very next day to have mutton sami roll. The meat was in good amount but their same old cold food :( I don't know I wl try their biriyani or not. Cold biriyani is just not done

This restaurant is located very close to my school and thus, becomes the first choice when choosing Mughlai. 
Nice ambience and lighting, calm and quiet too. The waiters are well behaved but bot all of them(depends on your luck).
Well, I am neutral is this case because, their Biriyani tastes different every time I visit. You get in, get a seat, decide Biriyani and its served in a few mins....maybe 2 or 3mins. The rest takes time. Last month, Chicken Kasa tasted like raw chicken dipped in the curry, Biriyani was okay. 
But last week, the biriyani tasted like molten rice. Sticky and thick. Their rolls are just average and sufficient for an evening filling. 
At times I have found that the potato was too big and this rice was less, in take away parcels, so mad been disappointed mostly.

One and only destination for food during my tenure with U S Embassy!! Small sitting arrangements but the quality of food is just awesome! We used to feast on Saima Special Mutton Biriyani, Tandoori roti, Chicken Bada Kebab and Mutton Korma and last but not the least Firni!! Their rolls are also to die for.

In the big names of Arsalan and Alibaba we're forgetting these small restros like Saima and Royal but for me it's a must if you really like a bit wet/oily biriyani!!

I wanted to visit this place since long. The good reviews from my frnds and the menu I checked on zomato are the real reasons behind it.. and an off class just before the break in college, and we knew where to head to. We were in a dilemma where to sit as they have both an ac sitting area upstairs and a non ac one on the ground floor. Finally we decided to sit upstairs. I guess there is difference in price between the ac and non-ac sitting place. We went around 12:30 and it was quite empty. Nothing to talk of the ambience, it's a plain and simple restaurant. Coming to the food, we had mutton liver curry-owing to my love for mutton liver, I simply loved it. At 42 getting a plate full of mutton liver is wowwiiee. We also had mutton sami tikka masala. It was nice, amount was good too. And we had tandoori rotis,which were bit on the harder side, with the mutton dishes. One negative point is none of the food served to us was hot.
We finished our lunch with firni which was not at all good. All in all, I loved the mutton dishes and would surely like to try biriyani.
Edited:we went there again the very next day to have mutton sami roll. The meat was in good amount but their same old cold food :( I don't know I wl try their biriyani or not. Cold biriyani is just not done

The place seems to be known for its kathi rolls since I usually see a line of customers waiting for one whenever I go there.  The rest of the menu is worth trying but can be on the greasy side.

This restaurant is located very close to my school and thus, becomes the first choice when choosing Mughlai. 
Nice ambience and lighting, calm and quiet too. The waiters are well behaved but bot all of them(depends on your luck).
Well, I am neutral is this case because, their Biriyani tastes different every time I visit. You get in, get a seat, decide Biriyani and its served in a few mins....maybe 2 or 3mins. The rest takes time. Last month, Chicken Kasa tasted like raw chicken dipped in the curry, Biriyani was okay. 
But last week, the biriyani tasted like molten rice. Sticky and thick. Their rolls are just average and sufficient for an evening filling. 
At times I have found that the potato was too big and this rice was less, in take away parcels, so mad been disappointed mostly.

One of my friend took me to this place to have dinner. We went to the ac room which is situated on the upper level... OMG..!!! What the heck the whole city is here. Place is too congested n ambience is not too good but chalega. I sat n saw the menu... OMG...!!! What the heck so cheap....!!! And quantity was way too reasonable n for the price range their food was much delicious. Serving time was 10 minutes for us 4 people. Pretty fast. The main attraction of this restaurant is their cheap yet delicious food. Order anything i bet u wont be dissapointed....

So, let's begin with saying that Saima has more to offer in comparison to the money you pay. The menu card boasts the finest mughlai cuisine at the cheapest prices possibly within the country. On broke days, the shami kebab and rotis for a whooping 35 bucks is just the thing. The biryani is delicious and the rolls are to die for. The Russell Street out let is more comfortable to have a nice conversation while eating otherwise the best pick up joint in the city. Try it, you'll feel like paying more once you are done.

Found this place near my college a few weeks back. Nothing fancy. A good place to grab a roll or some good biriyani. Prices are really low and quality and quantity is quite good. It is good place to grab a bite after college.

Although a place quite small and nothing much to comment about its ambience and decor but still saima attracts people by the rich aroma of its food..
Not perfect in taste but still delicious,this place serves some really good stuff..be it biryani or a chicken dish..
The place is really small with just 3-4 tables closely joined..the service is no doubt fast as the food ordered comes in no time..

This one is one of the most convenient places to eat when I am in the Russel St - Middleton Row area, and I am not that fond of their biryani, but the chicken chaap they make is pretty sublime. I like it with a couple of rumali rotis, and they sometimes have the chicken liver, which is also great, especially if you like offal like me. Service is brisk, no-nonsense, and extremely pert, I daresay, and generally a meal for me is under 100/- which is a great deal.

This place is known for their fast food. The rolls are too much delicious. Whenever I visit around this area, I land myself to have a roll at this place which remains crowded at the evening rush hour. I had their biryani also which tastes delicious under the rate.
The quantity of food is okay and the taste can compete others in the same category.
MUTTON SAMI ROLL is my favorite.
Lacha Paratha, Chicken Kasa tastes good also.
The ambience is crowded and the place is too small. they have hardly 30 chairs.
the waiting time varies between 5-10 minutes only.
The place is not kept in a clean condition.
The price of the food is apt for school, college and regulars.
The staffs are okay as per the condition.
The narrow strip in front of the restaurant remains crowded all the time.
I LOVE THIS PLACE BECAUSE OF THEIR FOOD QUALITY, TASTE AND SERVINGS UNDER THIS RATE WHICH IS NOT AVAILABLE AT OTHER PLACES.

Saima is one of those little biryani and Mughlai places in Kolkata which you could easily miss, if not for the rich aroma finding its way to your nostrils whenever you pass by. The service here is definitely a dampener, as the waiters have a threatening demeanour which makes you ill at ease. Also, chicken biryani, which is so popular, was not available at lunch time, when we were there, thus making a few of us ask why we were there in the first place. Also, one of my friends wanted boneless chicken, but we realized there were only three main course dishes which were boneless. This was again a disappointment. Finally, when the food came, we realized the dishes were just dry kebabs immersed in a thick gravy which was definitely far from delicious. The gravy was also so little in amount that we could hardle dip an entire roti in it. The only saving grace was the lachha paratha, which was crisp and tasty at the same time.

just call them and place your order.. and they will be at your doorstep with 15 to 20 mins..

I was introduced to this place by one of my friends. The place is small and nothing worth mentioning about the decor. The restaurant has got two levels, the groud level is non ac and a upper small size level is air conditioned. The food taste good nothing extra ordinary but the price and quality is the main attraction.
The Mutton  Saima Special is good with added egg and potato along with 2 pieces of mutton. 
Rating it purely for its food and low cost

Temporarily working in Ac Market, this is my place to go to for Lunch. Great food at great price. Rarely one would find a Mughlai Joint with good vegetarian dishes, well this is one of them. The best part is that it comparatively lighter on pocket than other restaurants of the same class. However i was not much impressed by the rolls.
Stuff worth trying:
- Kashmiri Aloo Dum
- Dal Fry
- Chicken Kassa

Very cheap and tasty food can be found here. My office is within 400 meters of this restaurant and approx we place order in every 15-20 days. Good in lacha paratha, lever curry, tikka fry, chicken chili (A bengali type chilli chicken), biryani (less oily). They also make home delivery with just little amounts extra. Max delivery time 30 mins..............

This new outlet of Saima at Russell Street is grabbing a lot of tongues of late. Why? because it is probably the only place in that area which serves good mughalai food which doesn't punch a hole in your pocket. The place might look shabby and suffocating from outside, but the food serves is really good. They also have a first floor section with seating facility and air conditioning. 

The food, we order there is basically Shammi kebab and Rumali roti, or Dal Makhani with Roti And Chicken Reshmi Kebab. The Rumali Roti is big, well baked and soft, lacks that "rubbery" sensation that is often attributed to it. The Shammi kebab is very rich in spices and flavour. The mutton mince inside is soft and juicy, but plenty of oil in the gravy. The Dal Makhani was nice, had a very authentic north indian flavour, not very rich and tender. Really nice. The Chicken Reshmi Kebab topped my list, it was one of the best kebabs i had. Really soft, with a smoky flavour but juicy inside. It disappeared the moment it had arrived on the table! Overall, not a very bad experience.

After a hectic shopping spree at metro plaza and Bk market we had to grab some quick bites.With no other options left decided to try saima.They have another branch jus behind exide metro station.But that place is always packed and looks very suffocating from outside.

This branch is much cleaner with a ac seating area.Since we dint have much time in hand the order was small n simple.

Chicken reshmi kebab-100/-
Butter nan ,
egg tarka-28/-,
firni and thumbs upp.

The kebabs were 6 in number.Soft ,buttery and yummy.Just melted in mouth.
Egg tarka good too.

What was surprising was the bill which was 183 /- for all of these.Man its real cheap with the quantity and quality of food and in a comfortable seating area.No where u get such kebabs in the price.Next time I visit Metro Plaza will hit this place for sure to try out biryani and other varieties.

Many people have been across this place but do not know the name of it. Well, precisely this is the place from where the aura of smoked kebabs come when you come out of the metro station of Rabindra Sadan. If you want authentic Kebabs in Kolkata this is the right place. You don't need to get inside the small restaurant; the smell of the cooking will make you drool. And the food is damn cheap. Nowhere will you get such tasty Biriyani in such a cheap price. Don't forget to taste the Shahi Thukra and the Lassi. Bon Apetite!

We were shopping at Metro Plaza and suddenly we realised that we were extremely hungry! We didnt have much time to go to some other place or even at Park Street and wait for long hours to get a seat and hence, my friend offered me to have lunch at Saima, which was absolutely nearby! I had never heard of this place before and so I wasnt that sure how the food will be! But trust me, I have had one of the best biriyanis here! Our ordered menu was simple, 2 Chicken Special Biriyanis, 1 Chicken Bharta  Boneless and 2 Cokes! It was the first time that I could finish one full plate of Biriyani as it was so yummy! The place is a small one, one might find it a bit clumsy, but the service is really good and I must say that they maintain cleanliness unlike other restaurants of this sort! I would love to visit this place again and if you are a Biriyani lover, don't forget to visit Saima!

The outlet near Rabindra Sadan was the one I'hv been multiple times. The ambience would not be favorable for everyone. The food is rich and even some what non hygenic (seemed to me at least). But the food served here is absolutely delicious. The mutton tikka here is my fav dish. Rest you guys can try it.

The food here is nice but not the same thing cannot be said about the oil they use for cooking. Be it chicken or mutton version of their rolls, kebabs, biriyani, tikia, kassa, korma, chap…… all of them tastes very good. The Liver curry too is yum. The vegetarian versions too are good and almost tastes like non-veg. But if you are a weight watcher or a health conscious person this place is not for you. I know people who had stomach trouble after eating here often. This is perhaps the only drawback of this yummy Mughlai joint and that is the reason why I am stopping short of rating this place 'great'.

PS: The Little Russel Street outlet of Saima is clean with good seating arrangement. But the Saima located beside the outlet of Rabindrasadan Metro station is not clean and chaotic, not the kind you would want to visit with family.

An awesome Mughlai food joint...It caters 2 da need of the common mass and thus strikes out the wasteful expenses which in turn allows them 2 serve quality food at gr8 prices...
This place is a bit crowded due to their price and quality...Generally during the lunch hours it cn take a toll on u due 2 huge crowd pressure bt still quality does not gt dampened...Pocket pinch is really low and it thus gives an opportunity 2 try variety cuisines..Biriyanis are a must try...

This outlet of Saima is a bit cleaner and tidier than the other one near Rabindra Sadan metro station.If u cut short the ambiance and service part of a restaurant then u can come to saima.It is generally for the people who work in local offices there.The prices are reasonably low and the food is also tasty.But the quality of the food is not that good as expected in a low price restaurant. But for those who are near this place and needs to satisfy their hunger in a hurry then they can try here.The biriryanis are the most recommended here.Also take  chicken tikia if u going for punjabi meal with rotis or parathas..

Me and my friends discovered this place during the Kolkata Film Festival last year in Rabindra Sadan. We were getting hungry (as usual) we had a show like in half an hour so we had to eat something close by so we discovered this place which is very close to the metro station. Looking at its small tiny place I nevet thought it would have a seating arrangements above it. But to my surprise it did have. To describe the place the ceililngs are very low so when you're walking towards your table you have to keep your head low. But I was surprised to see that the food is very good. we had a chicken biryani and a chaap and boy it was good and cheap... and the service was average as you can expect... not a bsd option though

Saima, a place for mughlai khana. I went to the place way back in 2007 and found a  favourable eating place here. Although , you may not find enough peace by just sitting and chatting with friends while eating Shammi Kababs, because of space crunch here. But look at the cost, the food is really cheap, if you do not want a shaahi treat in this place.
I liked the food and and want to go again and again if they continue to offer good enough dishes at this cheap rate!!
