We found this place through zomato... and were a bit apprehensive when we first walked in... All that changed the moment we tasted their offerings. Food was extremely good, not too spicy and portions was generous. As someone from the South, it was literally like having a home cooked meal. The curd rice and bisibele bath aka sambar rice are awesome. Masala dosa and poori masala was delicious. Suji upma could be improved on. The decor is minimal, the staff are warm and friendly. Service is a little slow ... But worth the wait. Highly recommended for authentic South Indian vegetarian food

Going by the name Malgudi¬† we expected some authentic south Indian food and beverages. I tried Malgudi special uttapam and my friends had saapad. Its decent given the fact that not many restaurants in kolkata serve south Indian food.
Was really disappointed with filter coffee. It wasn't strong at all.¬†
Best thing about the place is the paintings on the wall which remind you of Malgudi days childhood stories.¬†

Looking forward to try some new dishes next time.

I was extremely disappointed with this place when I went to grab a quick coffee with my friend.
I asked specifically if they would serve filter coffee, they replied in an affirmative and what we were served was a watery mess most probably with instant coffee.
We then ordered for a kesari, one of my most favourite things, it was EXTREMELY sweet and had a synthetic saffron flavour. 
The staff were inexperienced and incompetent.
The rating is for the ambience and the decor mostly, which is elegant and pretty. But I will not be going back for the food.

Fond of Malgudi days by RK Narayan?? Then its a must visit place. Really touchy ambience with full of malgudi days memories. Little different south indian dishes served by them than others. Dosa and other dishes are really good but if you want to try out different saviour try out their chilli idli its really awesome and mouth watering

Thank you and Zomato for delivering food on a heavily rainy day when most other joints stopped taking orders by evening. Full marks for packaging of the food shows a lot of care for customers ordering food from home. Taste of masala cheese dosas and idly were awesome along with the coconut chutney. Sambar was good too but can do much better. Will definitely get back to you for some more delightful food experience.

A place that will take you to your childhood days. Expect the walls to be decorated with pictures and paintings of our childhood favourite " Malgudi Days". The way it's done, it is bound to have a nostalgic effect on you. The managers are very polite, the waiters very attentive. The owner personally came to us to talk and take feedback! Noted and appreciated! 
Coming to the food, I was elated to see saapad on the menu. Well, saapad is a South Indian meal consisting of unlimited rice, ghee malgapodi, sambhar, rassam, karaikoram, avial, poriyal..in understandable words, it basically comprises lentil based dishes, some South Indian style vegetables, raita, chaas, a sweet dish, etc. 
Since I've been to pondicherry and Chennai a lot of times and had saapads at so many places, I know the meal inside out. And the best way to judge a saapad is to smell the fingers even after hours, if that aroma of freshly grounded spices (the south indians actually grind their masalas everyday) persists, the saapad is a hit. 
However it would be too harsh on them to expect the same experience in Kolkata. Kudos to the kitchen team for trying their best to pull off the best possible flavours they could.

Gem of place in Kolkata for South Indian food! If you are on the look out for some authentic Udupi food, this is the stop.
Dosas  and coffee are great in taste. Idlis can be better though.
It's small place tucked in a residential area with limited seating. But the warmth of staff and good food , do make your day!

Filled with sketches from Malgudi Days, one is sure to relive his/her childhood! And its pretty affordable too! With the food being so great its sure a great value for your money.

This is my quaint haven of peace.
A visit to Pai's Malgudi on an overstressed day is the necessary antidote to appease your nerves.
Soothen your palate with the welcoming chaanch. The innocence of its ingredients will make you ask for more. 
You may try the Dhania Dosa next. The recipe for the chutney that makes it so special is a secret well guarded to the kitchen. The taste of the dosa is devotedly traditional with a modern twist of the chilli-dhania paste.
Satisfy the explorer in you with the thali now. Starting from the sumptuous puri across all the way to the moong dal ki halwa, this is an experience that will leave its mark.
The signature experience is not complete without a glass of filter coffee.
A special mention for the kind and generous staff here.
Vanakkam!

My immense love for south Indian food brought me here after I read some reviews about this place. I usually have lunch when I am out on work and thats where I have an advantage of trying out all food in the city under a certain perdium. 
I have been looking for some really authentic south indian food after I came back from Hyderabad and Chennai since last year. Though I had good south Indian at the Banana leaf restaurant in sec 5, but, the food I had at Pai's Malgudi was far better.
Superfast service
Absolutely fresh food
Quality is pure and tastes real south.
Simple,yet good presentation of food
Absolute value for money
I ordered for a mini thali, which came along with puri,sambar,poriyal,raita,halwa,and pickles,popaddums and fried dry chilies which is specially found in south.
As I had skipped breakfast, so the food I ordered was not good enough for a big eater like me, so I ordered for a second round of set dosa. 
To be honest, I was very happy to have the vegetarian food. It was 100%satisfactory. 
Moreover the ambience is very calm and peaceful. Associates are very courteous and responsive too. Its a 24 seater outlet and I am sure if you love South Indian food, you will love this place. They also have a separate menu for the day. Set dosa+mini thali was INR 225 including taxes.

Remember Malgudi days from the famous R.K Narayan's famous literature. This place is decorated with the 'Malgudi days' theme. Pais are the owner of this place, hence Pai's Malgudi. Visited with my mom and both us loved the place in every bit. Ambience is decent, service and cleanliness is top class. I tried their masala dosa, paper cheese masala dosa, alu parantha and dahi vada. I became fan of their dosas, it was sufficient and the filling was good enough, accompanied with sambhar and two types of chutneys, the platter is a wholesome meal. Dahi vada was mind blowing with the sweet tangilicious taste, vadas were soft and dipped in good amount of yoghurt.

A good place where one would want to head for South Indian, if around Ballygunge. I visited twice and surely will visit again. Best of luck Team Pai's Malgudi !

Need I say that Pai's Malgudi gave me a very quick flashback of a sweet childhood memory- R. K. Narayan's Malgudi Days. Replicas of R. K. Laxman's (R. K. Narayan's brother) paintings adorn the walls and it was so joyful to get a fleeting vision of those carefree days. Well, coming back to reality..... and the food.... We ordered a Mushroom Cheese Masala Dosa and a Malgudi Blast Dosa along with Cold coffee with ice cream. The Dosas were humongous, great to taste and worth every penny. A special shout out for the Malgudi Blast Dosa. The Cold coffee was standard. The service was quick and prompt too. Nice cosy place.... I am certainly going to revisit and try out the other specialities too.

The malgudi special used to be nice until i found ants in sambhar bowls of everyone on the table. Apparently their container was full of it. Or it was stale as we went for breakfast. Assuming it was a one time incident, i ordered on swiggy. And it was quite disappointing(no salt in coconut chutney, stale soggy idli, smelly red chutney)

Skip this place.

The one in Camac street used to be good.

My second time around to this small restaurant and I can clearly say that some stuff is really nice while the other is about average.

The obvious first thing that hits you if you are from Doordarshan's Malgudi Day's era are the paintings on the wall. So endearing.

The food is good. The usual stuff is moderately priced and the fancy stuff isn't too expensive too. I loved the thali and could visit it again and again just for the Blast Idli. The Malgudi Blast Dosa fills you up nicely.

It is fun to be in the place if the elderly gentleman is there because then the dishes mean more, the staff sadly does not know what is being served or what it is all about. I servers need to know more about the dishes. Please educate them, because some of the dishes need an explanation.

Lovely experience. Wish the place was bigger. Ah yes, could you please make the coffee more South Indian coffee then what you serve now.

Horrible experience ordering from this restaurant. I'll admit I had been meaning to try this restaurant for a while after going through all the good reviews. They have an interesting menu, that seems to cover a good variety of South Indian cuisine. So, today I finally decided to try them out for an early dinner with the family and placed my order on Swiggy. I decided to stick to the basics and went for 3 masala dosas and a dessert.¬†

The order arrives after 1.5 hours - which I was willing to excuse since it was raining. But the food was horrible! Soggy dosas, and only one teensy pack of masala (to think they even charged me extra for this joke of a packaging!). ¬†That aside, one of the dosas actually turned out to be a Sambar Vada. And, to my horror, it was also dipped! Now, I was in no mood for having Sambar Vada but above that I am by no means a "dipped" person. ¬†Any South Indian food aficionado can vouch for me that handing out Sambar Vada to your customer without inquiring into this is blasphemy and what kind of restaurant gets that basic wrong? Anyway, they also forgot my dessert.¬†
Needless to say all my excitement went down the drain by now. But, they decided to ruin my day further by not compensating for the "wrong item".¬†

A restaurant which expects the customer to be accommodating for being late and then in turn seeks "evidence" to compensate the customer for a mistake they made - is definitely not doing customer service and hospitality right in my opinion. About the ambiance? Well obviously I can't add to that since I'll never be visiting anymore.¬†
¬†
Bottomline: If I am going to order from Pai's Malgudi next time? To that I say - Never again!

An exhaustive outlook and feel with a hint of South Indian touch. A homely ambience with an equally friendly service. Tried out the unique dishes like paniyaram and lemon rice. Taste was authentic and certified with the fact that I have tasted native South Indian food. With a davi vada and butter milk in the end to add a cherry on the top. Not to the mention the masala dosa had a well doughed mixture perfectly embedded. Overall a good place to feel the souther food vibes in a cosy little ambience.

Located in ballygunge hazra, this place is a small eatery serving south indian. The menu boards of a good variety. 
Went here with family and ordered the following-

‚Ä¢ medu vada- was fried well but the inside was raw. Was replaced later and I liked the taste. 
‚Ä¢ idli chatpata was delicious and a good fusion to taste #recommended
‚Ä¢ masala vada was spicy, crunchy and made well
‚Ä¢ ghee butter masala dosa was really good
‚Ä¢ tomato onion pepper cheese Dosa was nice with good Aloo masala and chopped veggies
‚Ä¢ green pepper cheese masala dosa was just about okay
‚Ä¢ mushroom cheese masala dosa was really good though they could have sauteed the mushrooms before adding to the Dosa.
‚Ä¢ the malgudi blast Dosa was delicious. Special Aloo masala,  and lots of veggies and coconut made this one a good dish indeed.
‚Ä¢ cold coffee was made well
¬∞ mango lassi was a little too thin
‚Ä¢ normal lassi was okay.

Total bill was 1800 for 3 plates medu vada, 1 plate masala vada, 1 idli chatpata, 5 dosas, 1 hot coffee, 1 cold coffee, 3 lassis.


Service was okay.
Overall a decent experience.

Now coming to the food, I didn't know that there can be so many varieties of dosa!! We ordered Paper dosa, Garlic Masala Dosa, Mushroom Rawa Dosa, Aloo Bonda, Sambar Vada and Rose Milkshake. However the food was okay, Mushroom Rawa Dosa was very bland, the Sambar Vada tasted a little undercooked. The staff was very warm and friendly. Like every south indian restaurant this place too is pocket friendly as the dishes are reasonably priced. Overall it was a good experience..

Well..this place was long in my bucket list..finally paid a visit..a small place with good old wall decor..nice indeed..the place was already full..we were lucky to grab a seat...good turnover of customers..staff is courteous and service is prompt..
We ordered The Malgudi Blast dosa..their speciality..and this dosa has become my absolute favourite..served in 4 pieces along with sambar and two chutneys..
The crust was crunchy and the stuffing was spicy..cheesy..just yumm..their signature dish..superliked..
Next dahi vada..the curd was fresh..sweet..and flavourful..the masala was very unique..the vada a tad bit less salty..above average..
The garlic butter dosa..the aroma made me super happy..the blend of garlic and butter made me drool..this was yumm as well..
A bit overpriced..but a nice place to visit..

Taste is okay okay but not at all pleased with the quantity of food they are serving.. I ordered Dosa and the quantity of masala is pathetic.. If i had gone for any roadside joint, I would have gotten more than double quantitywise.. Won't go for it again..

Either a small and ordinary restaurant like Pai's Malgudi or a costly one like serafina or bombay brassieres, ballygunge restaurants have never disappointed me. Pai's Malgudi is a small restaurant opposite quadra that serves authentic vegeterian south Indian food. We ordered idly,veg pulao,coffee and kesar lassi. Wonderful taste. They served each dish in a true south Indian way(e.g. coffee in a stainless still glass exactly like the south Indians do). I am deducting half mark because of its small sitting area.

I'm not a sucker for South Indian food, but I quite liked the food here. Most exclusive South Indian restaurants I've been to do not have the best ambience to have a meal in, but this restraunt was clean, hygienic with a good ambience. The restraunt could seat about 15-20 people maximum. The service is great and the staff is friendly. We went on 1st January so they gave us a complimentary New Year Special sweet dish. Do try the paper masala dosa, medu wada and filter coffee.

The decor is not the only thing that's interesting about this place but that is, in my opinion,  certainly one of its USP! Indeed Malgudi itself derives it's USP from the fact that one could always relate to it and it was no different from the many small towns that have mushroomed in India riding on the back of the Railway station or the highway!  Pai's Malgudi has sketches of Malgudi, as depicted by R K Laxman, adorning it's walls and gives off an impression as if one is sitting and eating in a small eatery just outside the small Railway station in the town of Malgudi!  In sync with the decor are wooden benches and stout square tables, sans any ornate designs and carvings; just the way you would get in a small eatery in the smaller towns of India. The place may have the ambience of a small town dosa joint but it's menu is by no means short or basic. Vying for place on the menu card besides the ubiquitous masala and plain dosa are such varying combinations like dhania dosa,  spicy fusion idly and such fusion dosas, probably in a bid to attract a larger  clientele. In fact it also announces special daily North Indian meals on a blackboard propped up against one of the wall. 
As for the flavours of the food served here,   I would like to submit that I have only tried the idles and dosas of this place and quite enjoy the basic stuff which is always served by one of the young lady eager to please with their attitude and smile. 
I have loved the  Malgudi dished out by R K Laxman. I am a great fan of R K Narayan's writing and had yearned to visit Swami in the fictional town of Malgudi when I first And I love Pai's version of Malgudi... Where nostalgia stares at you while the flavours of food take you on a trip to Nirvana land.

Had food delivered to my place. The chutneys had a pretty authentic South Indian taste which was good. But the Dosa lacked a bit, it was just not upto the mark. The Kerala Paratha was good but the Kuruma had a lot of Laung/Elaichi flavour which almost ruined the taste.

Located at Hazra road near Hazra Law College. A small south indian food joint seating approx 25.
Wide vatiety on Dosas on offer. The taste is decent nothing extraordinary. Good for occassional sunday visits.
On our last visit we ordered Idly blast a dish made by frying idly and mixing with vegetables.
Suji Uppma which was freshly made and tasted very good.
Other regular like masala dosas(no onion garlic available) and idly vadas are decent.

Being a strict non-vegetarian that i am,this place was never in my list. However hunger can take you anywhere! So my friend and i entered this place with not much expectations. We settled down in a cosy corner. Well the ambience was pretty comfortable and cozy. The place is very neat and clean and properly maintained. We ordered for:
Rasam- tangy,spicy,perfect blend of spices and very soothing on the palate.
Ghee and butter masala dhosa- i am a non eater of dhosa. So did not try that. But my friend was very impressed with it. So thumbs up. (The sambar alongside was very tasty again and i finished the entire bowl without giving my friend a share üòâ) 
Keralan parantha with veg korma- this was accompanied with mango pickle. Though it was not very impressive but full of taste it was. 
Vegetable uttapam- we had this packed. This was very filling and tasty. 
They have held on to the essence of south india very beautifully from the cutluries to their exquisite wall paintings. 
Definitely going back for the rasam atleast.

It's a small little place serving authentic South Indian food. Liked their paper dosas, the uthappam wasn't that great though. The variety available is great though. The walls are beautifully decorated with artistic malgudi paintings. Service is a little slow, they probably should work on that part a bit.

A treat for every southindian living in Kolkata. Malgudi offers not only a variety of dosa and idlis but also extremely traditional and lesser known southindian fare like idiyappam, addai, set dosa and puttu to name a few. Ordered a mushroom cheese masala dosai and ended it with a traditional filter coffee. The dosai was large enough for two and they were served with a tomato onion chutney, coconut chutney and sambar. The tomato chutney got me back memories of my grandmother. So so tangy and delicious. Wished the mushrooms were a bit more saut√©ed before adding them to the potato masala. Filter coffee was served in the traditional tumblers and were brewed perfectly. Interiors are bright, well lit and neat. Reasonably priced and service was quick. Do visit if you want to try something different.

This is a quaint little eatery located near Hazra Law College and the thematic element running behind the establishment is quite obviously R.K Narayan‚Äôs Malgudi.

The food served here is inspired by south india and since I had stepped inside out of curiosity(without any knowledge of the outlet), I ended up ordering only a masala dosa.

The dosa I was served tasted good enough and while there was nothing special about it, the overall aesthetic and interiors of the place was what attracted me. I feel that this could be a great place to spend a relaxing evening with friends or family.

A cozy South Indian joint near Hazra Law College, this is nothing radically different than the other South Indian places in the city. Food is okay. Service needs attention but the main part is the decor. Although the white walls are painted with Malgudi Days graffiti but the bright white tube lights ruined everything. It would have been a magical ambience if only they have hung old yellow bulbs from the roof and kept the surrounding at par to the theme.

Pai's Malgudi is located opposite to the Hazra Law College and offers a healthy selection of South Indian dishes along with some specialty items usually not found at every South Indian Joint.

The entrance from the Hazra law college side is a bit unkempt since their kitchen is located there. I would strongly advise them to remodel the entrance to make it a bit more attractive.¬†

While browsing through the menu, I was glad to find out that they serve Gunpowder Dosa. Being a gunpowder fanatic (fell in love with Gunpowder during my visits to Andhra restaurants at Bangalore), I ordered for a Gunpowder dosa, spicy buttermilk and filter coffee.¬†

While waiting for my food to arrive, I further browsed the menu to find that they serve a lot of specialty items which the manager suggested. I decided to skip experimenting as I was visiting with my mother who does not like to experiment much.¬†

It took a bit of time for the dosa and filter coffee to arrive which was not expected as the restaurant was empty at that time.

However once the dosa arrived, I could wait to dig in. The gunpowder dosa tasted great and was spicy as expected. The buttermilk was also quite impressive.¬†
Next we ordered a Suji Upma. I must admit that I have not had such tasty Upma in a long time. Both my mom and I thoroughly ¬†enjoyed the dosa and upma. I did not taste the coffee so I would not comment.

Pricing is moderate, bill was around Rs450 for all the items ordered.

South Indian in your mind and near Ballygunj well this is the place you should visit. This is near the law college. I have been here just once. The interiors are simple yet I found it to be elegant and the will definitely remind you of the malgudi days.

I am not a big fan of south indian food and restrict myself to a few dishes only. However was a bit confused after looking at their offerings on the menu. Had the plain masala dosa and idli. I must say after a long time I really had a nice sambar and masala dosa.

In terms of the price point, its definitely very pocket friendly.

I am so so happy after eating at this place.  Malgudi was an integral part of our teenage days and having it back in this new avtaar is just awesome .  

The place is simple and smells awesome .  The smell of sambar is bound to make u smile.    There is something fir everyone.  Out if all the dished I have tasted,  I simply adore the dal wada  and also the podi  dosa.  The malligapodi us totally yummy.  If u ate a spice food love u must try the BKB dosa...  It's super spicey and I totally loved it.  The chutneys served (both red n white)  are fresh and light.  

The also make weekend specials.  The puttu with kadla was light and absolutely  delicious .  Even the idiapam with light kerela  stew was yummy.  

Very very pocket friendly.  A paradise for the veg food lover.  Simply awesome !

When you come to this place you know how your ideal restaurant would be like. A chatty owner talking food , getting geeky and discussing the book you have grown up reading, 3D Art on the wall , sleek black tables,chairs and simple food you will quickly devour.
Decently priced dishes , what I liked was them serving rasam in a glass as it is done in the south. Mango lassi was ok, but the Sada Dosa and Rawa Masala Onion Dosa just brings you ear to ear happiness. The blast idli is fried (not for the healthy heart :p) sauteed with veggies and spices .Give it a try, makes for an excellent snack. The chutneys are just the right consistency.

You get the true taste of South Indian food,  they have a huge array of dosa's, Idli, and Vada ofcourse. There's  even a thali meal if that's not enough for you. 
Best dish I had was their special Idli blast- minced Idli fried with exotic spices and topped with coconut shavings served with sambar and chutney the usual.

First the bouquets:

The food here is wonderful and satisfying. I had a Malgudi Blast Dosa which is like their signature dish. It was really tasty.¬†

I also liked the fact that I saw the eagerness in their staff to serve and serve with a smile. The staff is friendly beginning from the security guard to the waiters to the manager. And the service is fast too.

Now the brickbats:

The space is too small. So much so that loners like me would have to share tables.¬†

Someone needs to educate them that Shikanji is not the same as Nimbu Pani. It should be made with soda and masala.

Goodfood and wall illustrations that take you right back to the 90s equals happy me. The place kind of made me nostalgic. Good old days. We were there for a meeting and spotted this place and in a week we were back to try out their specialty South Indian dishes. I got myself a Saapad, which is a South Indian Thaali,¬† light on the stomach and so delicious. I think the only thing missing was the signature music of Malgudi Days. It's not just the food is light on stomach but the bill was light on the pocket as well. A pure vegetarian eating place with less of taam jhaam and more of good food. And what better way to end with a Filter Kaapi ;-)

Decided to check this restaurant after reading good reviews about this place specially after reading the review of my fav food blogger rukhsana. I did not have a pleasant experience at all. We ordered steam idly first and the coconut chutney served was stale and tasted sour which was replaced instantly after pointing out but question arises why were they serving stale food on the first hand itself. We also ordered kerela parota with korma which was horribly oily and very hard and the korma was nothing but dry mix vegetable that to was not fresh.The malgudi blast dosa was good. We also ordered paper plain dosa and specifically asked to make it crisp but was served a normal dosa which they offered to replace but we didn't coz my son was feeling sleepy and didn't have time for that. Now the most awful preparation was rasam which was the same sambhar mixed with water and served in a coffee glass it was thick and contained all the veggies which can be anything but a rasam .we traveled all the way from saltlake to gariahat and were simply disappointed.

The purely south indian joint offers unbelievable dosas and other stuffs. There is a menu of the day and you can choose from among them. The aloo paratha is a must order. In the dosa section i loved the mushroom cheese dosa and the next time will try the other varieties.

Of all the South Indian food joints in Kolkata, Pai's Malgudi serves the most unique and closest to authentic South Indian foods.

The name strikes a chord with most of us. In fact it is this name which prompted me to discover this place. Located at Hajra Road, it's just 2 minutes walking distance away from Ballygunge Phari.  As you enter this place you'll be amazed by the simplicity and calmness of the place. 

I've tried a few of their dosas and wadas. Gun Powder Dosa and Mysore Masala Dosa are my favourites. The best thing about their special dosas are the layers of special spices that add a certain zing and make you fall in love with their dosas.

In my next visit I want to try their Malgudi Blast Dosa and their special Uttapam. This is a nice place to go with friends or families and indulge in delicious South Indian dishes.

The food is undoubtedly AMAZING! We ate here  before but what disappointed me this time was the service. I ordered a thali. And instead of giving the food together, they brought it in installments. We were waiting for the poori and they got it after a long time only after we asked for it. Same went while serving the sweet. They forgot only about the sweet. When I asked them where is the sweet then they were like "Oh sorry I forgot. I'm getting it". 
But yes the food is amazing. ‚ò∫

Pai's Malgudi is a lovely little place to satiate your South Indian Food cravings. One sunday evening over a dozen hungry foodies descended and occupied the place . What followed was an absolute orgy of food where we stuffed ourselves into a food coma. Our feast comprised of the following .... Idli
 , Wada , Dalwada , ¬† Idli Blast along with Filter Coffee to start with. The Wada was my favorite and I was delighted with the Idli and Dalwada as well which was crisp and yum. The Idli Blast was a new and refreshing innovation.
Then followed the Dosa's .... Gunpowder Dosai ¬†slightly spicy and very nice ,Mushroom Cheese Dosai which was very good followed by the ¬†B.K.B Dosa which is a house special described as "This one is the super chilly spiced up masala Dosa, not for the faint hearted .. do order a cold beverage with this one " and an excellent
¬†Rava Onion Dosa
.
The specials they had on offer and we tried were Iddiyappam with vegetable Stew and ¬†Puttu with Kadla both of which were very nice and I had not sampled before.Overall a great meal my only suggestion for improvement would be a slightly thicker sambar as I found it a bit watery.

When the heart desires a welcome change from the ever rushed weekday breakfast, reach out to Pai's Malgudi. Ask for freshly steamed hot idlis, crispy vadas, rawa onion dosa served with rasam or sambar. But the winner is mini sapaad served during lunch. What I simply love is their ability to pack the right goodies in the right quantities.The thaali will have nice hot rasam/sambar and rice with a small portion of alu sabji that will make you feel good instantly. It comes with a well done papad, a spoon of aachar, grated carrot sweetish raita and a fiery fried chilli, Malgudi style, to balance the flavours. (pic attached) End your meal with a small portion of kesari halwa. It's not too sweet and the portion will not make you feel guilty either but you need to order it separately. They also have bigger thaalis with choice of pooris- nice and crispy and additional sabjis. A good choice when you want some home style cooked south Indian food.

I went there recently with a couple of fellow foodies. I have been here before and have ordered home delivery as well as it is quite close to where I live. Since it was our monthly meetup we had a preset menu available. I started my meal with buttermilk or chaas. I quite liked it since it had a hint of curry patta flavor to it along with the spices which were mild. We got our rounds of idli, Medu Wada and Parippu wada. Let me first just say that I loved their chutneys especially the red one which I believe is a tomato and onion chutney. Plus I generally dont like sambar but theirs was quite nice. I liked that it was slightly thin with the masala not being overpowering plus it was not full of vegetables. The idli and medu wada were quite basic but the parippu was nice and crispy, something that I have not had before.¬†

Blast Idli was my absolute favorite as was the gunpowder dosa which is¬†something¬†that I¬†usually order from them. Im not a fan of mushroom so I passed on the¬†Mushroom Cheese Dosa. The¬†B.K.B Dosa again was quite interesting which I found midly spicy. Their dosa portions are¬†quite¬†big and one whole one can easily fill you¬†up. The onion rava dosa was ok and it could have been a lot better. ¬†

Iddiyappam with vegetable Stew¬†and¬†Puttu with Kadla where both not something I liked a lot. The Iddiyappam was quite bland even with the stew. The puttu was¬†desiccated¬†coconut which I believe was slightly cooked and it was served with kala channa¬†gravy. It tastes ok if you mix both the channa and gravy with the coconut. Im not a fan of coconut so this was not the dish for me. I dont really know if traditionally these dishes are made in this manner but for me personally both of them didnt work. ¬†Overall I will go back to this place for the dosas and the blast idli.

very good place for south indian foods .. about 10 minutes walk from ballygunge phari, near the garcha road crossing ...

tried their masala dhosa .. vegetable uthappam and idly.. all of which are served with sambar and two types of chutney..¬†

all of them were quite good in taste and light too...

service and hospitality are nice....¬†

P.S. If you are a fan of malgudi days .. the ambiance is what you will like the most..

overall a very nice experience and worth visiting again...

it is situated near the garcha road crossing.
months after, i am trying southindian dishes.
we ordered masala dosa, vegetable uttapam and plain idly.
this restaurant is pocket friendly with light and healthy food. i loved the sambar !
the flavors are simple and tasty.¬†
ambiance reminds you of the pages from Malgudi Days.

Other day we bumped into this restaurant for dinner while . I was pleasantly surprised by the high level of service offered by the owner and the staff to their customers. Menu and the food offered was not the same as ordinary South Indian food that we get in any restaurant. We ordered a thali (Sapaad) and kind of Bonda (spicy) I forgot the name of the dish. Food was delicious. We are really happy with the overall experience and would highly recommend it to anyone ....

We had ordered plain dosa, regular idli and dahi vada through Swiggy. The delivery was quick. The packaging was very neat. The dosas and idlis were all well-cooked, however, the size of the dosa was a bit small. The sambhar was really tasty and so was the red chutney accompanying the dosa. The dishes are easy on the pocket too which made the overall experience pretty good.

A south indian delight in kolkata. Its on theme of Malgudi days by R.K.Narayan. Me and mom visited here 2months back for a change in breakfast and we loved it. The ambience was good. Malgudi days paintings done on the wall. We ordered a gun powder dosa and malgudi blast dosa and a filter coffee. Both the dosas were good but malgudi blast wae truly a blast. Its heavy and yummy. ‚ô•
Overall a nice place.

After reading the reviews in Zomata we decided to order from here. We ordered Mushroom Cheese Masala Dosa, Plain Cheese Dosa and Medu Vada. Well I was disappointed to say the least. There was no cheese and the dosas were almost burnt. And I have never found the dosa's masala to be sweet. The sambar was runny and tasteless, same goes for the white coconut chutney. The only thing that was good was the tomato chutney. There are many good south indian good joints so don't waste your time snd money here.

After collecting report from quadra I noticed the "pai's malgudi" board in opposite footpath and decided to have some snack here.Me and my friend entered the stairway..and found out that it was actually the kitchen area.Then we have to go to the other side of the road as guided by the staff there and landed up in the restaurant.

I just loved the decor of this place.The walls had illustrations from RK Narayan's Malgudi days.It took me back to the world of childhood nostalgia.Staffs made us feel at home with their warm hospitality.We ordered a masala dosa,dhania dosa and for dessert we went for kesari.

Both the dosas were very good.They were served with sambar,coconut chutney and tamarind chutney.The dosas were crisp.Masala dosa had an adequate filling of alu-masala inside still the dosa didn't become soggy at all.Dhania dosa had distinct taste of coriander from it.The condiments went with the dosas perfectly and also they tasted good on their own.

Kesari-It was perfect dessert to end the meal.It was suji halwa flavoured with kesar.It was warm,not-overly sweet and had tantalising aroma of kesar.I liked it very much.

Maybe it's not much light on pocket but it's worth coming here for freshly prepared South Indian delicacies and also reliving the charm of 'Malgudi days'. :)

This is the most inconsistent place I've been to. 

Some days food is amazing and few days it's a big let down.

Their masala vadas are just too good and they serve very spicy tangy red chutney with that 

The day we went around 8pm their dosas got over . How can a South Indian restaurant get its Dosa over by 8pm 

But this place is a must visit. Except that odd bad experience, every time we went food was amazing

After seeing the reviews visited this place on sunday evening. Located opposite to ballygunge law college its easy to locate. It is a small eatery serving south indian dishes. Interiors are plain and simple. Pictures from RK Narayan's Malgudi Days are painted on the walls. On a whole ambience is nice. Staff is well behaved. We ordered a mysore masala dosa which was crisp & good. Bissi belle rice was ok nothing special. But the kerala parotta with kurma is lovely. Its a must try and the showstopper of this restaurant. Prices are reasonable. But restaurants like Banana Leaf scores more on the food.

Finding a good south Indian restaurant in Kolkata is a difficult task. I was lucky to have two South Indian restaurants located in the same area where i was staying. This place is located in a quiet corner near the hazra law college. In terms of space it is very small and has about 6 tables.

Wanted to have a light dinner, so we settled for a bisibela bath, malgudi special uthapam and curd rice.

Bisibela bath was homely and made with the right ingridients, though not as authentic as how it is made in Karnataka. Curd rice was just ok. Malgudi special uthapam was basically veg uthapam with a dash of cheese on top. Tasted pretty good. Nothing much to complain.

Visited this place for a mid week lunch with my son and husband. The place is simple with simple seating arrangements and deco but the food is awesome . We ordered : blast idli, idlis, rawa masala dosa, vegetable utthapam , one South Indian meal . Loved the food and so did my 4 year old kid . Thumbs up for the sambhars , red chutney , coconut chutney . We were likely to have an onion paranthas which was not ready with them ( feel they should notify it before ). Secondly , we were unable to consume idlis which we asked them to pack for us and which they did but without sambhar and chutneys . I suppose the staff took my instructions literally of only packing the idlis .

It's a small South Indian restaurant in Ballygunge on Hazra road having basic interiors and Malgudi themed wall art. The staff here is very friendly.

I've been to this place multiple times and I love the food everytime. This is the place where I had mushroom in a Dosa for the first time, and I liked it.

I read a lot of reviews about their specialty, the 'Malgudi Blast Dosa' and so I tried the same, it was really tasty and a different kind of dosa.!

Ordinary food. Nothing special. Had a butter masala dosa and a cheese masala dosa. Bothe were similar. But their price difference is huge. 70/150. Excluding the price dosa was good but nothing special. Disaster came when I ordered gulabjamun. It was terribly bad and they served quite old stored sweet.  Very very bad.

Came here with a friend on 23rd Jan at 5.45 pm. The place was empty and we ordered a plate of Idli. The "fresh" idlis came in 2 minutes along with sambhar and two chutneys. It was apparent from the hardness of the idli that it was cooked long before and the coconut chutney had less coconut and flat taste. The Manager very arrogantly told us that this is the kind of taste they serve. If you are used to the taste of Raj ,Jyoti Vihar and similar then it's best to avoid this place. The sambhar and chutney taste better at home.

Found this place while checking the south Indian delights collection in zomato. Struck by the name decided to pay a visit. A small joint with its interior decorated with the pictures of Malgudi days. A bit cozy but the atmosphere was nice. Service was good and fast. Coming to the food we ordered one Masala dosa and one malgudi blast dosa. The masala dosa was normal. The malgudi blast was not up to the mark as described by the joint. They said it will be a bit spicy. But it was not at all that spicy.
Lastly a bit professionalism and adding some more varieties in the card will do the trick for them I hope.

One nice south indian joint near my work place, incidentally we entered from the backside and had to cross the kitchen area to enter the restro,  with a decent bright yellow lit basic interior with malgudi themed wall arts and some caring staff, insisting is to try out their MALGUDI BLAST DOSA and MALGUDI SPECIAL UTTAPAM and we agreed on that. 
Both the dishes were nice and so were the sambar and the two chutneyas,  but definitely a bit overpriced. Would like to explore more!

Pai's Malgudi is a pure vegetarian South Indian eatery, in the lane, bang opposite Mukti World, Ballygunge. It's located on the ground floor of a pretty old building. A big signboard is placed at the entrance. ¬†

It's a small and almost a square shaped place with light decor. Walls are white and they are adorned with black sketch replicas from R K Narayan's famous literature 'Malgudi Days'. These are simple, funny and old world, village sketches, by R K Laxman (author's brother). A couple of medium sized rectangular mirrors adorn the walls as well. Flooring is tiled and greyish in color. Since the building is old, it's ceiling is rather high. Thus the lights and fans are not fixated in the ceiling, but are placed on fixtures, hanging from the ceiling. You can also spot the old world d/c current switchboard on one of the walls! Furniture consists of wooden - chairs, rectangular tables and benches. There is a reception desk, with horizontal wooden slabs placed parallel in the background wall. Kitchen is closed door.

The menu consists of - dosas, uttapams, idlis, wadas, upmas, all of which are served with sambar and two types of chutneys. Alongside, there are five types of rice, which are served with their respective accompaniments like - pachadi (raita), papadam, mor molaga (fried chili) etc. Other Specialities include - special coconut chutney, puri masala, aloo bonda, dahi wada and kerala parotta with korma. They also serve three meals or 'sapaad'. They are - mini sapaad, sapaad and ultimate sapaad. And of course, filter coffee is also available.

We ordered - Idiyappam, Kerala Parotta With Korma, Rava Masala Dosa and Filter Coffee. Herein, Idiyappam was not present in the menu, but was served as the 'Dish Of The Day'. Originally, it is served with a veg stew. But, since we were not sure of acquiring the taste for a coconut based gravy, we asked them to substitute it with chutneys, and only serve a small portion of the stew for tasting. They obliged. The entire meal tasted very nice, including the stew! The hero of the meal was Kerala Parotta. These Parottas  were eggless, layered and very soft. The accompanying Korma also had the right blend of curd and spices. Idiyappams are steamed rice noodles, clustered in the shape of a spongy disc. They are rarely available in local South Indian eateries. So, we felt lucky to get them here. Rava Masala Dosa was crispy. Sambhar and Chutneys were average. Filter Coffee was very good.

Owners of Pai‚Äôs Malgudi are long time vegetarian caterers in Kolkata, and cater to many esteemed houses. Their earlier forays in the restaurant business were Coffee Pai and Malgudi Junction. The term, Pai's Malgudi is actually derived by joining the names of these aforesaid restaurants. They have also tried hands in fine dining via Blue Potato. All these three restaurants were Kolkata based, but had to discontinue. The senior Mr. Pai provided these facts while chatting. We wish the Pais, all the very best for their latest venture.

Very easy to locate this cute restaurant was not a disappointment. I love south Indian cuisine so i had to try the food from this place.  Tried the gunpowder dosa which was the same size as the other dosas. It was different and yummy but the taste is such  that one person cant have it. The dhaniya dosa was also great. The filter coffee is a must try. i also had fried idli for the first time and it was pretty good. 
The walls have beautiful drawings on them and the place is well lit. 
The service was friendly and fast. :)

I visited this joint with my mum a few days back. My mum being a lover of south indian delicacy I take her to new joints serving the same. This place was not difficult to spot because it is absolutely near department of law c.u (hazra campus). The place is small but very bright indeed with yellow colour everywhere. I liked the drawings which was put up on their walls. We ordered masala rava dosa, cheese rava dosa, Adai,  fresh lime soda and black tea. The masala rava dosa was okay and the quantity of the masala was moderate. The mistake which I made was that I wanted masala cheese dosa and while ordering I took it for granted that there will be masala in the dosa but alas it was only cheese dosa nevertheless it was okay and quite filling because of the cheese element. We have never tried Adai before but it was an over fried item may be it is supposed to be that way not sure and taste wise it was okay but i did not like it that much . The chutney and the sambar served with the dishes were really well made. The tea was served in a steel cup which looked pretty and also tasted good. The fresh lime soda was the worst I have ever had. I asked them to make it sweet and salty but it was so sweet that after few gulps of it I wasted it. The staffs are very nice but the major problem which I had with this place is the cleanliness issue. The glass in which the soda was served was damn dirty also same with the plates. I felt that they definitely should look into the matter as hygiene is the most important aspect. Nevertheless being a fairly new joint it does have scope to improve itself.

Just opposite mukti world, Pai Malgudi is the South Indian restaurant that Ballygunge needed. The food is very good and pricing is also decent. The only problem is the shortage of space, but it's not a major issue. Must try the Idli blast and cold coffee here. Also look out for the special menu. There's always something new.

With a lot of expectation, we ordered food from Pai's Malgudi via Swiggy (the answer to the gastronomers' wish of ordering in from restaurants otherwise out of bounds and a big kudos to them for that).

Unfortunately, it was a disaster for us right from the word go. We had ordered for a cheese dosa, a mushroom and cheese dosa, a mysore masala dosa, a paper plain dosa, bisi bele bath and upama. Only the upama was edible; the others a mere waste of money. 
It was mentioned in their menu that all the dosas are served with 3 types of chutneys, but to our dismay, we found only the normal coconut chutney accompanying all the dishes. The bisi bele bath had nothing apart from an overwhelming acrid taste, wherein actually, it tastes beautiful when prepared properly. In Kannada, Bisibele Bhath means a hot and spicy rice preparation usually accompanied with "spicy chanachur" or salted boondi.
The paper dosa was the worst of the lot with the dosa as soggy as it can get; even our local south indian joint prepares a better paper dosa at a much cheaper price.

I'm not sure if they even have tasted authentic south indian dishes; from the food they have to offer, I very much doubt that.

Verdict: AVOID!!!

Hi foodies!

It always helps when you get decent snack places near your college (just one minute from Hazra Law College). However, this is a South Indian eatery, so don't look for much options here.

We ordered:

1. Shikanji: I don't know what they made but it tasted like normal cold water to me. Thumbs down.

2. Mysore Dosa: This seemed like a normal dosa to me. Considering the price, they really skimped out on the stuffing. If you want a proper Mysore Dosa, it is better to pay 80 bucks more for the Mysore Masala Dosa.

3. Malgudi Blast Dosa: This is their special offering. This is pieced into 5, each stuffed with proper amount of cheese, potatoes and masala. #MustTry

4. Keshari: This dessert is basically suji but strangely, it didn't have the aroma of it. Tasted just okay.

>The decor is basically spartan with whitewashed walls with black outlined murals with the Malgudi theme. 

>This joint could decent, but I believe has scope to do a lot better. The simple dosas are not worth having. So they could do away with them and keep only the long, generously stuffed dosas with a pricing comparable to other joints (eg The Banana Leaf). 

It has been a good hit with the college goers. So a few minor changes would go a long way in making them really successful.

-Bon App√©tit. :)

I love south Indian food. People make faces,  when I say I love everything from dosas to the curd rice. So, I am always on the prowl to try out the next south Indian place serving delectable sambar. 
Pai's Malgudi didn't disappoint. Come in front of the hajra law college gate from bally guns fari, look to your right and you will see that there's a Lane that has bifurcated from the hajra road. Take the bifurcated road and this place is on your left. 
The place looked welcoming from the start with the owner welcoming you with a smile. The place was packed with diners since it's one the small side. I had to share table with two other ladies. I didn't mind and seemed like it that they had no problem either.  
Without delay the waiter served me a glass of water and the owner herself took my order since the waiters were busy service g other patrons. I love rava dosas. So ordered a plain rava dosa and asked for a curd rice to go. 
The dosa came without much delay. And it was very very good. Nicely spiced crispy dosa and an equally yummy sambar. I devoured it in less that 10 minutes! The curd rice was good too,  creamy with subtle seasoning. Perfect comfort food! 
Price seemed very reasonable. The place was very clean with attentive waiters. The warmth of the owner was another plus point for me. But the best thing there were the graffiti on the walls depicting characters from R. K. Narayan's Malgudi Days. 
Next o  agenda is to try their filter coffee.

Being an all day veg today we thought of ordering some south Indian specials . Ordered through Swiggy for home delivery. First of all an unofficial felicitation to team Swiggy for this unmatched service quality. Now coming to Pai's Malgudi and its creations. We ordered for a Bisibele Bhaat , Suji Upma, Paper Dosa, Mysore Masala Dosa, Cheese Dosa and Mushroom and Cheese Dosa.
1) Bisibele Bhaat : Awefully sour with overpowering smell of bay leaves and black pepper. No other kinesthetics worked Only SOUR SOUR SOUR. They served Appalam (papad) and Pachdi (Raita) which were nice. What's the point of accompaniments when the source dish is inedible. I was in Bangalore for 12 years and well adapted to South Indian cuisine. BISI means hot...it's like a spicy khichdi with veggies served with salted boondis. Total disaster 0/5
2) Suji Upma: Taste was average, they served only one white coconut chutney but served with two chutneys was mentioned in the menu. It was less seasoned and no smell of ghee. Banana Leaf Upma is any day a better choice.
3) Paper Dosa: Very ordinary...Sambhar was inedible watery very sour it can shame away rasam consistency.
4) Mysore Masala Dosa : Ordinary Masala Dosa .Only deviant was an unmentionable red Masala sprinkled which attributed no flavour. The pallya was as ordinary as any udupi. I have tasted Mysore Masala Dosa infinite times the red Mysore Masala(podi commonly called in south India is a mixture from hot red chillies, garlic, cumin, asafoetida) adds an extra zing to the dosa and the aloo Masala is spicy with coriander and green chillies. Total failure 1/5
5) Cheese Dosa : Good
6) Mushroom and Cheese Dosa : Good, give it a miss and buy a pizza with the same topping, your money would be better justified.
My verdict : Decorating a place to replicate Narayan's famous story and serving a regional food with authenticity is not the same ball game. I can vouch on Banana Leaf, Idli Express, Mission Cafe anyday to explore the south gourmet. DISPLEASED!!!

Nice cozy place just beside the Samsung  Service  centre in Ballygunge.

Recommended by a friend and wanted to see just how this place was.

It turned out pretty decent.Small whitewashed interiors with Malgudi painted all across the walls. Courteous staff and very quick and efficient service.
Had the Mysore Masala Dosa and the Dhania Dosa which were both pretty nice to taste.

The Rose Milk Shake was made up to my satisfaction. Also enjoyed the special Uttapam that they had to serve.

Had 2 filter coffees at the end which had authentic  south Indian taste.

I enjoyed there. Please visit this place at your leisure but have them know first if you are a big gang.üòäüòäüòä

Amazing place owned by amazing people... The uncle who owns the restaurant gave a homely feeling and gave us all the good suggestions to help us order our food, and the food was awww so amazing. We ordered a plain Mysore dosa, cheese rawa dosa, the medium thali all were equally great and the rawa dosa was specially amazing. And at the end we ordered filter coffee which I had to order again cause one didn't do for me... Must visit for an awesome south Indian food experience.

Had this outlet on my bookmarks for quite a long time.
Finally decided to give it a try on sunday when we craved for a south indian lunch.
The place is a bit small, not claustrophobic but rather cozy.
The ambience has the the charm of old times with the round tumbler switches & black wooden chairs. The wall murals of scenes from malgudi days just add to the same charm.
Coming to the food, we ordered plain idli, cheese dosa (regular size), a sapaad (thaali) & rose milk shake.
The idlis were really well cooked, & the accompanying chutneys were just the right taste.
As good was the cheese Dosa.
Now coming to the saapad, it was plentiful. The rice,pooris & all the vegetable curries, sambhar,rasam are enough for two persons. I didnt quite like the moor. & the fried chilli was a letdown. But the rest were fine.
But the rose milk shake just stole the show.
My better half just went gaga over it.
The ambience was good, staff courteous & service prompt.
Although initially they wrongly brought us the mini saapad but on pointing out, they immediately changed it.
The pocket pinch?
well, the items are fairly priced & you will not feel the pinch at all. In fact the whole of our meal cost us just 354 rs! can you believe it!
We left with a full stomach & a very good experience.
Will visit again.

Worth spending...
The ambience is good and the staff is also very helpful...
The quality of food is awesome, compared to its price it goes hand in hand...
The item I loved the most was the Malgudi Special Dosa like it has no comparison and yes the uttapam deserves mention also becoz it's base was soft like anything...
In short a must visit place if you want to have good South Indian food...

On the turn towards left just before the Ballygunge Phari, Pais Malgudi is a tiny, white, neat place that instantly takes you back to the epic teleseries Malgudi Days times. 

The Malgudi Blast Dosa, the signature specialty, although a bit overpriced when compared to the rest of the menu, is a unique must-try item with cheese and gunpowder. Dhania Masala Dosa, Uttapams and Kerala Parottas are exquisite and so is the filter coffee.

The couple who manages the show is very hospitable and extremely concerned about the dining experience.

One of the best destinations for South Indian delights in the town for sure!

OK so I'll need to visit this place one more time to give a complete review as i believe they are understaffed it being one day after puja

My issues
1. Bad waiters who didn't understand my order nor could they explain to me certain items till the cashier came up to help

2. Bad kitchen management or maybe the waiters screwed up as my special chutney came after I finished my dosa

3. I think the food was awwwwesome but didn't get to taste it as it should have been hot when I ate it but with their ac and fans running simultaneously the food got cold before it came on my table 

4. I would love to eat the food here again and will come on a non holiday expecting maximum service and hot food cos the menu is awesome , the cold food also tasted good so expecting magic with good waiters and hot food

Service is quick and waiters are approachable and helpful with selection ...
Best in d menu is Malgudi Blast Dosai which is a must try... U gonna get a blast of all flavours right from cheese till gun powder with Mysore chutney all over it...
Parippu wada was average... It was well made... Was crisp
Idli upma which was even really nice ... They added a lil sweet coz of d sourness of Idli.. So all in all it was really well made...

Yesterday I visited Pai's Malgudi. This is located just near the Hazra law college and reaching there was really convenient. As we went inside and got seated down, I was taken back to the old days when in my childhood I used to read about the Malgudi Days. The interiors are decorated really well and those cartoons drawn on the wall are really very attractive.
Talking about the food, I liked it. We ordered a south Indian thali ( salad). We were asked to choose the rice we wanted to have and I opted for the lemon rice. This was my favourite part of the whole Thali and I loved it. Apart from the rice, we were served 4 pooris, wada, Aloo poriyal, beans poriyal, sambar, rasam, pachadi, keshari, moor, achar, papadam and mor mologa( the Malgudi special fried chillies).
Pachadi is a kind of raita and it was really very refreshing and delicious. The poories paired with aloo poriyal tasted awesome. I am not a big fan of beans but I also liked the beans poriyal. The moor (buttermilk) was infused with different spices and I personally liked it. The sambar and rasam were also nice. We were served a korma which had a bit tangy taste and we also had bisibele bhat. The manager there told us about the history of bisibele bhat and how it originated. In the earlier days, it was prepared using the leftovers. Ending the meal on a sweet note, I loved the keshari which was a rava halwa and I opted to have another one of that. It was mildly sweet and delicious.
The best thing about the place was that the staff were really cooperative and friendly. Overall, I liked the place and would like to go again.

Noon,at 3:30,on a busy weekday;we(foodies) were in with a hungry stomach.Here,The space is small so we had to wait for 10-15 mins to get a table.
No doubt,AMBIANCE calls for appreciation. Cartoons on wall,adequate lighting, well furnished,air conditioned and obviously we'll behaved waiters.
But restaurant can't get full marks without it's foods.So,lets concentrate on that. Menu will tell u that it's a south Indian restaurant.
( die hard non-veg lovers,keep distance)
We had a complete thali there with choices of rice. The thali contained puri,rasam,sambar,papad,halwa,raita...(sorry,memory fail)..taste was good enough and the lemon rice made me remember of my bengaluru days. As dessert,we had more halwa. A curd drink was also given,that wasn't good at all. 
Whatever,pai's malgudi gave the chance to have an adda over their platter.

This little place packs big flavours in their offerings of south indian cuisine. Just a few steps away from my college this is a south indian heaven. The people here are very friendly and always smiling. You don't need to wait for long for your order to arrive. The very favourite part of mine is a cup of piping hot filter coffee, after the meal. The coffee smells and tastes like nothing you have tasted before. 
The decor actually reminds of the childhood days when we used to watch or read Malgudi Days. :)

I had visited this place with mom, it was a wonderful experience. Different taste and flavors of South Indian food. Must say the owners are very courteous and pleasing. I had ordered an item parripu vada which they serve only in weekends which I was not aware of, but the owner asked me to wait and he did serve it, Thank you. The masala vada very soft and light, the rava onion was crisp so it did not feel like a dosa which could be little taken care off. Overall it was a delightful experience.
Very good and reasonable priced... You have variety of rice items wanted to try but was completely full, will surely make more visits to try their complete menu. 
Next time there would be pictures‚ò∫Ô∏è

This place is within 100 meters of my home, so there is always a level of excitement whenever there is a feeling to relish dosa and idly. I have been there numerous times and it is always average compared to other classic South Indian popular joints. But there is always hope of getting things improved the next time. The last experience I had was simply very disappointing. I had gone there to takeaway dosas for dinner. These were the issues that made my experience pathetic:- 1. The potato stuffing was stale and lacking any taste.  2. There was a lot of imly in the sambhar tasting as if rasam and sambhar was mixed and then heated up 3. Instead of repeatedly reminding the server to give all the chutneys he forgot to pack others and packed only one(this has happened for the third time). 4. Also a request to the management that service taxes are not supposed to be charged in the takeaway and home delivery orders.   Hoping that the next this lovely small place does not disappoint as there are many yummy South Indian restaurants in South Calcutta and every time they cannot be given chances.

Somehow my last review got lost in translation and so I had to write a fresh one... After knowing the Pai's personally and hearing rave reviews decided to drop in to check out Malgudi. Its a quaint, peaceful and elegant place on Gorcha fork, and you can not miss the signage. The inside walls have sketches from Malgudi junction and the place has a very serene and homely feel. Its Udupi cuisine but food is just awesome and oozes love. The food is honest, light fresh and leaves you wanting for more. Loved the vada, thattu dosa and sappad. Try moor there local traditional buttermilk drink to wash it all down. The best thing about the place are the prices, super pocket-friendly.¬†
Overall great experience great food attentive service, can't wait to go back soon.¬†

Before my 'unlimited sapaad platter' arrived, I found myself being gradually captivated by the beautiful and 'nostalgic' paintings on the walls..as I kept admiring those, my food, with a very impressive 'look' was served on the table. With lemon rice, vegetables and a host of other items, I had a sumptuous gastronomical delight! The food was hot and fresh, tasty, satisfying and filling. The staff were extremely courteous, sober and prompt. The prices are decent enough. Looking forward to visit again...!

Visited today evening with my family and enjoyed every bit of being here.... From the 'Sapad' to the 'Dosa' everything was good... The decor 'Malgudi' was quite nostalgic reminding me of the 'Coffee Pai' and the 'Malgudi Junction' days... The most important part of the restaurant is probably a little beyond their food... Its Mrs. & Mr. Purushottam Pai who made all guests feel special with their warmth and personal touch.... 

I would recommend all to try out for yourselves and find out....

Tucked away in a non descript lane and a small seating capacity but beyond that it's smiles all the way for this restaurant. The drawings on the walls get you all nostalgic. The menu is varied and deep with a good assortment of everything. The taste is authentic. Service is quick. Smiles are served free. One of the two places that I know that serve good filter coffee.

Pai a word originating from the Konkan & refers to Saraswat Brahmins having roots from the aforesaid region where as Malgudi reminds us of the fictional town found in R.k Narayan stories & the famous score from the television series.
Trust me friends as i proceed and complete my review,both the terms will find justice. With 15th August celebration in full swing around the city and most of the eateries having eagerly waiting hungry independent queue, i was keen on going to a pocket friendly unexplored joint.Suggested by my fellow foodie Preeta Sen, i along with Aritrya Ganguly & the lady herself embarked upon the quest. On arrival we were greeted with a cordial smile by a south indian brahmin couple and a manager who escorted us to the table.
The menu was short sweet and crisp. I & Aritrya readily ordered for cold coffee with ice cream along with Kerala Paratha with Korma for me and Cheese Garlic Dosa for him.Preeta ordered for a Cheese Mushroom Dosa and Moor.
Now a days we all know that today's special menu is made only to drill a bigger hole in the pocket & the Garlic Dosa coming from that section was not an exception,taste was average but a bit over priced.The main reason behind ordering for cold coffee was the price was a treat to the eye when compared to the celebrated coffee joints of the city & it didnot disappoint us in terms of quantity but the ice cream portion was less than expected.The Kerala paratha was good and korma taste was decent.Mushroom dosa had ample quantities of the speciality.
The decor was awesome and gives you a feel of the notional town found in the stories.
The staff was cordial & very helpful.We had difficulty in understanding one item of the bill and the man himself ie the owner was courteous enough to come upto us to explain it,even before we asked for help.
Do drop in fellas if you want to explore a cosy little place over some food & coffee,mark my words,Pai's courteous beautifuly decorated Malgudi wont disappoint you.‚ò∫‚ò∫

Pai's malgudi is a very cute place (like a swami musuem) and the owner and servers are really, really nice and courteous people. Just very near Hazra law college, finding it may be a slight bother if you dont know the area well.

I went there with Maa and since we were both very hungry, we ordered two meals for ourselves with the lemon rice option. now here's the deal which is strange because the food was seasoned and cooked well, but lacked oil to the extent that it was so dry to gulp it down became a task.  the molagapudi was however delicious. I just think I landed up there on a really bad day, and I am willing to go back again and try the dosas for sure. 

I know that unlike most standardised south Indian meal places, Pai's sticks to a more specific mangalorean Pai family cuisine style which is very commedable but I do not like sambar with over-powering jaggery. that is of course a personal choice and has nothing to do with the quality otherwise.

Went for lunch with a couple of friends. My friends ordered cold coffee with ice cream, Kerala parotta and a cheese garlic dosa from the day's specials. I had the mushroom cheese dosa and moor. I must say that the experience is quite nice. The dosas were quite filling, crunchy, and served with delicious chutneys and hot sambhar. The menu offers a very large variety of dosas along with choices of uttapams, vadas, etc. Also available are set meals and a variety of drinks. The prices are quite easy on the pocket. Although not very spacious, a number of dark wooden tables are cleverly fitted and provide a clean, uncluttered feel. Interior decor is pretty nice with pristine white walls painted with scenes from the popular childrens' book. Definitely worth a second visit and more.

Go to this amazingly designed restaurant and have Malgudi blast dosa. If you are a food lover, you will be on Cloud 9. It economical and real value for money. The taste is real amazing. Mushroom dosa is also very good. You can also buy Gun Powder and the taste will blow your mind off. However they should add filter coffee in their list. It is a must go place for all foodies.

We ordered for medu vada and malgudi blast dosa and tea. Medu vada is not oily so its really a great news for weight watcher and its crispy too. Malgudi blast dosa is full of flavour. The service is quite good. Overall its a nice experience.  :)

When you combine simplicity with beauty, Pai's Malgudi is what you get. Located in Garchha lane opposite to Mukti World, this quietly tucked away South Indian restaurant is a gem of a discovery.¬†

We had ordered Medu Wada, Cheese Mushroom Masala Dosa and Mysore Masala Dosa, all of which were served one after the other within a span of 20 minutes. The hospitality was generous and so was the staff.

Cheese Mushroom Masala Dosa- Simply brilliant. Mushrooms wrapped in molten cheese, and the masala in the centre. Simply yummy. And the best part was, the masala consisting of mashed potatoes and fresh spices wasn't needlessly spicy as served in almost all of Kolkata. They gave the usual chutney and sambar, and my favourite gunpowder masala.¬†

Mysore Masala Dosa- Damned good, and the dosa was dusted with mild masalas.¬†

Medu Wada- Light and crispy on the outside, it was soft and moist on the inside. I wish they served 3 instead of 2.

A really great place, with a nice, homely, warm ambiance. Seating area is very less though, and I wish they served more than 2 wadas per plate!

Excellent food üòã. This is real south Indian food with a few few twists. I tried the Malgudi Blast Dosa which was gigantic and delicious. Also tried the rasam vada which was too good!!

Great place.. A great dine out for south indian lovers... Their Idli Blast and The South Indian Meal 'Sapaad' is a must try.. It has an elegant look with all the little paintings drawn so realistically.. The staff is soo friendly and the owner is the sweetest host of the small joint.. A must visit :)

This place deserves a 5 on zomato as it has  very very good food , good ambiance , very humble staffs. They give an unlimited southindian thali just for rs 125 + tax. I love the bessi bella rice and chhanch they gave in thali...
My friend took a gunpowder dosa ... it did not had aaloo stuffing but stuffed with some kind of masala powder which was also very tasty...

Had visited this place on a Sunday.
This place is too small and has a capacity of around 25 heads.
The things I liked about this place were :
1)The interiors were nice.
2)They had a vast and an innovative menu unlike other south Indian joints.
3)The staff was courteous.
4)The prices are quite reasonable.
5)The quality of their food was good.
6)They give two types of chutneys. Both their sambhar and chutney are nice.

Their Malgudi blast is a must try. The mushroom cheese dosa and chef's special uttapam are nice , but nothing too great.
Didn't like the set dosa. The sambhar vada was also good.

The things which I didn't like about this place were :
1)Although the staff was courteous and were trying their best , they were unable to manage the rush on a Sunday evening which made our experience there quite disappointing.
2) Two of the things which we had ordered were served very late , after around 20-25 minutes and after reminding them thrice. After 20-25 mins , the waiter informed us that they wouldn't be able to serve one of the two dishes. But after cancelling that order they got that dish after 5-10 mins. We had also asked for the masala separately but they failed to do so.
3)The quantity of the chutney is kept small as many people waste it( which is a good measure ) , however the staff should make sure so as to serve the extra chutney timely.
4) The size of their dosa is smaller compared to other south Indian restaurants.
5) We didn't get the coriander chutney which judging from the other reviews is quite good.

All in all the food of this place was quite nice. What was a bit lacking was the service. Thus I would like to give this place another try but preferably on a weekday.

Near Calcutta university campus, this is a nice place with good ambience. The food is very good. The malgudi blast dosa is the speciality a must try. The mushroom cheese dosa and special uttapam is also great. All in all most of the things are good. The only problem is that it is small and on Sundays the staff can't manage the place. The service is slow and not good. Maybe on a weekday it would be the ideal south Indian joint. The place is reasonable but helpings are small. Two kinds of chutneys are given instead of three written in the menu.

Kept me waiting for an hour and had no interest at all in speeding up the service to accommodate all the waiting customers. Even the food doesn't make up for such an experience. Killed my hunger. After I ordered out as well it was completely cold and the management refuses to accept responsibility. Pathetic.

A very small, quiet cafe, off garcha road. We were passing by, when my 3 yr old niece suddenly told she wanted to have dosa, we were elated because she hasn't been eating for the past two days. So we were praying she have at least half a bite, but lo behold, she loved it so much, she wolfed down one and a half cheese dosa! That speaks for the quality! Thank you for breaking her two day fast!

But otherwise, a decent south-indian joint, nothing spectacularly different, or bad, a good wholesome meal. The chutney is more of the chana chatni we get with the tiffin idli sellers, so it was a change.

The service though is spectacular. So much of a homey thing, with the 'uncle' gossiping away with my niece, giving her extra 'misri's' as a takeaway, to the attentive waiting staff.

Visit it once for the experience atleast!

Good cosy place. The decor goes with the name. If your South Indian food idea never went beyond dosa, idlee and uttapam, this place will show the difference. Try the Malgudi blast dosa for sure. The lady who runs the place takes special care that you get the right taste and is very warm and welcoming.

Pai‚Äôs Malgudi has undoubtedly become one of my favorite joints offering authentic and mouth-watering South Indian cuisines. The offering of these culinary delights is not the only factor that constantly attracts me to this place but the interior d√©cor and the general amiable behavior of the staff have almost equal shares in what constantly reminds me to pay a visit here for an overall enriching experience.
The Malgudi Special Uttappam is a must try for those who enjoy having Uttappams. The grated cheese layer that masks the embedded vegetables adds a different flavor to this delicacy. Trust me food lovers would truly enjoy this ‚ÄúIndian Pizza‚Äù. The Malgudi Blast Dosa is another must try. This is surely one of the best made dosas I ever had. What complements these delicacies are the delicious chutneys and Sambhar. A friend of mine once said that one can ascertain the overall quality of dishes offered by a South Indian joint simply by the chutneys that are on offer since a significant number of people would continue¬† paying visits to that joint simply to taste the chutneys again and again. Hence this place is a must try.
On a personal note, I have been an avid reader of R K Narayan during my school days. Hence if I am willing to reminisce those golden days at school, I pay a visit to this joint. I get into a completely different mood after I come out of this place.

Again.. reached this place by accident.. while searching for another dinner destination. An unassuming place.. saw the bright yellow board.. the name from childhood rang a bell.. read review instantly on Zomato... n there I was.

The ambience of the place was reminiscent of small time shops.. nuthng to speak of.. yet tastefully done. The caricatures on the walls were awesome. Check the pics I clicked. Wanted to click more.. but didnt want to disturb other guests. My rating for ambience.. 4.5/5

The food was absolutely delicious. I ordered for vada+idli sambar followed by a thali. Dishes were very well prepared.. without excess of masala or oil. Simple yet tasty. My rating 4.5/5.

The service was quick n with a smile. Typical of a small time establishment. 5/5.

Would definately recommend this place.

A 10x12 room.Very small but impressive with all the signature RK Laxman malgudi drawings. The boys are courteous and prompt. Ordered the blast dosa and coffee. Nice stuffing of beetroot chutni n cheese. The coffee good but not my favourite filter one. All in all must revisit to taste the whole menu.

Location: Very near to University of Calcutta (Law Campus); Diagonally opposite Vaiya's.

A tired soul traveling back home after work happens to cross this place, reads the name as ‚ÄúPai's Malgudi‚Äù and instantly an age old memory of a restaurant, ‚ÄúMalgudi Junction‚Äù came up. A hunch (later confirmed) about both the restaurants being from the same management house made the soul crave for the same flavors!

Pai's Malgudi was visited on May 17, 2015 over a family dinner. On entering, the first thing that caught the eyes of the soul and family was the non-descript yet, beautiful sketched walls, similar to those at the earlier restaurant (Malgudi Junction) and also reminded of the famous cartoonist, R.K. Laxman. The seating arrangement could only accommodate around twenty-five heads. The sketch were on white walls which had become dirty due to hand impressions and thus, slowly losing its charm. The walls need to be maintained :)

About the FOOD, the South Indian fare on offer was widespread and after a bit of contemplation, the now super-hungry soul placed an order of the following:

- Idli [2 pieces per plate]
The Idlis visually were sad and disappointing but, were soft and melted in the mouth. Nicely steamed and good to eat.

- Plain Vada
The Vada was crisp and tasted good. 

- Malgudi Blast Dosa
Plain Dosa with a filling of masala fry, cheese, molgapodi & their little secret spices. Their signature dish did taste good. One could give it a try.

- Rava Onion Dosa
The Rawa Dosa was perfectly done with a generous amount of onion in it and was crisp. Tasted good.
Recommended.

- Chef Special Uttapam
The uttapam was a South Indian version of pizza. :P
Soft uttapam topped with onion, capsicum, tomato, cheese and molgapodi (gunpowder).
The amount of cheese could be a little more. Tasted decent, could have been better.

- Papad
Crisp and good to taste.

- Fresh Lime Soda
Was very disappointing. It was nothing but, Jaljeera Sachet mixed in soda and served. Sad.

- Molgapodi
Way too oily. The flavor was overpowered by oil. Sad.

- Sambhar
Was decent to taste. 

‚Ä¢ Three types of chutneys are provided along with¬† each order but, in a very small portion size. On enquiry, the management had a very valid reason: ‚ÄúEarlier we used to give bigger serving sizes, but, since we provide three types, people tend to waste a lot. So to avoid the wastage, we decreased the portion size.‚Äù
For people who love to have more, repeat helpings are complimentary! :)

- Garlic Chutney
The garlic flavor was spot on, not too less, not too overpowering. The red chillies in it added a great flavor. Nice!

- Coriander Chutney
The best out of the lot. Fresh coriander chutney, tasted good.

- Coconut Chutney
Was slightly watery. Tasted just about average. Could have been better.

About the STAFF, they were polite but, need proper training.
About the SERVICE, was at a moderate speed.
About the PRICES, were slightly inclined towards the moderate end.

Overall a decent experience.

One of the best south Indian joints in the area with great ambience and food items on offer. Pair's Malgudi has everything going its way. The interiors are maintained well and tables organized nicely. What's best is their price sheet. With this kind of a place, having a good meal for two would generate a bill in the region for Rs 500 which is great.

Located at garcha road,  this place serves as a restaurant cum cafe,  having a capacity of accommodating around 20 people at a time.  If you are a die hard south indian cuisine lover this is THE place. The interior walls contain the replicas of the famous malgudi days cartoons by R. K.  Lakshman.  The food served here tastes very homely,  authentic and delicious.  I have tried their saapad (thali),  medu vada and the refreshing filter coffee.  The experience was very fulfilling .  A must-go for everyone who loves south indian food

Awesome place for South Indian. The decor is cool and trendy with various cartoons depicting RK Narayan'a imaginary world, Malgudi, artistically drawn on the walls. The food, though not very authentic definitely tasted good. The dosa was very oily and not like the ones made in authentic south indian restaurants. I ordered an unlimited thali and the waiters kept asking me where I tried anything more. They were courteous and nicely behaved.  Though its a nice place, there are better south indian joints available in Kolkata like Banana leaf.
Go there for a trendy new South Indian restaurant. 
Don't expect true authentic south Indian taste.

First thing.. this is a south Indian joint, which i was unaware of before entering the place, though i should have guessed it by the name and the big yellow hoarding outside the place..
My first feeling... i was disappointed... not because of the cuisine coz i love south indian dishes.... but because i didnt expect south indian cuisine at that point of time.. i was wondering for some bistro sort of place..
 But once me n my wife were in,the place impressed me by the simple but classy decor and the smell of dosas n filter coffee. We ordered dhania dosa n one cup of tea n coffee  for the two of us. The food was just awesome.. their service was great... and people were courteous. The place was full n even few people were waiting outside...
Very reasonably priced..
Best south Indian cuisine i have tasted in Kolkata...
Must go if one is fond of dosa.. upma.. idli.. vada... n other delicacies of the south..
Yummmmm... too good..

Zomato allured me to this South Indian joint! Ended up there with mum and mani. It's a cute little caf√© with beautiful interior,  the black and white decor with scenes from Malgudi Days painted on the walls! #beautiful
I ordered the Malgudi Blast Dosa, Gunpowder Dosa and Shikhanji.  The Malgudi Blast was heavy with creamy cheese, and vegetable filling. The Gunpowder Dosa was crispy,  with the chili flakes and other spices.  I'd go for the Gunpowder Dosa again and again!  The Shikhanji was okay, I ordered the sweet one.
The decor, the food makes up for a good place!  #ThumpsUp #WillVisitAgain

Very loud and very small, though I did like the taste and personalised service that they try to render, by the end of it becomes too irritating and you don't feel like eating. Within 5 mins the small 400 sqft restaurant was full and people were waiting like crazy. Very disturbing and non appealing if you like to eat peacefully...

Located bang opposite to the Hazra Law College lane, the fist thing that catches your attention when you enter is the wall art that takes you back to the 'good old Malgudi Days'. 
Not only does the decor impress you so that the variety of South Indian delicacies you get here. I was impressed by the quality of food as well as by the cordial behaviour of the staffs here. It's economical than most of the South Indian joints in Calcutta. 
So without much exaggeration I would say it's a place worth visiting!!

When I heard about this place, I was interested. When I realised it was located right next to my old paternal house, I knew I had to go there. And I wasn't disappointed. The decor is beautiful. The food is simple, quickly served and utterly reasonable. I usually judge a South Indian joint by the sambhar they serve, and trust me when I say it was pretty good. Not something to write long paragraphs about, but decent. The ambience makes up for the rest. :)

Gunpowder Dosa at Pai's Malgudi. I have a little love affair with Naveen Pai's Malgudi Junction. When I was in college, this was the place I would sometimes go for a nice, thick dosa, and a hot, filter coffee. When the place closed, I was sad. This time, I found that Naveen Pai had opened up Pai's Malgudi, and I dragged a friend there on a rainy evening. We started with a bit too salty shikanji, which wasn't too nice, but what followed was really nice. Gunpowder dosa, Mushroom Cheese Rawa Dosa, thick, garlic chutney, and a spicy sambaar, some extra papad, and finished off with some hot filter coffee, while watching the rain outside.
 We also packed food for home, and my lemon rice was much appreciated.¬†
Bliss.

Topline: I went in looking for good South Indian food and walked out feeling like I had the best South Indian food in a very very long time. For a while there, I had lost confidence in Kolkata's ability to churn out a heart warming Dosa. But thanks to Pai's Malgudi, the confidence has been rightfully restored. 

Order: Gunpowder Dosa, Masala Rava Dosa, Idli, and Malgudi Uttapum. And yes, coffee. :)

Experience: As soon as I was seated, I was greeted by the gracious and amazing, Pai family. There is a homely vibe that's synonymous with a small town feel or to some - Mom's cooking. Mrs. Pai had some amazing suggestions that made my ordering process seamless. And while waiting for the food to come, I couldn't help but notice the RK Narayan work on the walls that made the Malgudi experience even more real and authentic.

Food: Idli melted in my mouth. That hasn't happened since I was 8 and I was eating Idlis at my neighbors home in Lake Gardens. Both the Dosas were cooked to perfection and the best part was that I felt satiated and not bloated like you may in so many other local South Indian restaurants. The Malgudi Uttapam took some time, but then like all good things - the wait was worth every bite of it. The chutneys and sambhar did everything to add to the flavor and not overpower the main dishes. 

After thought: This is the best South Indian spot in Kolkata. Period. EOM.

This particular joint is somewhat difficult to locate, but obviously not impossible to find! Inside a lane of Garcha,very near to both Ballygunge Phadi & Hazra Law College. 
The place is simple and humble. The decor is modest and takes you back to days when life was definitely more simple. If I am not mistaken few years back in the Camac street area this restaurant was very much popular until it closed down for some reason. The teenager me with limited pocket money was a huge fan of their South Indian delicacies but it was shut down to my disappointment. One fine day in the last week of April when I was just passing by this street I was delighted to see this particular place open once again! A very curious me went inside and  discovered it's more or less the same place with the same decor ( though I didn't ask around whether it's the same outlet from Camac street  ) with super delicious South Indian delicacies and my favourite filter coffee. 
This was my first visit in this outlet and luckily for me my mother was with me who loves South Indian dishes as much as I do.  The dosa's though traditional definitely comes with the much needed twist, like a mushroom cheese masala dosa! It's a perfect combination and the flavours are amazing. Their simple butter dosa served with the spicy sambhar and chutney is also dish worth mentioning. I haven't tried many things from their menu, but believe me I am dying to go back. So all you people out there who loves to gorge on dosa's and lots of other variety of South Indian cuisine  please visit this place once I bet you are going to love each and every dish out here and keep coming back for more.

Small place for homely south indian food. They proudly own the fact that they're not fancy! Great upma  and exceptionally spicy chaas (almost a prank). Clean and presentable for a Sunday afternoon meal. Friendly  service

I had heard about this place and went for lunch. Decor, cleanliness and staff/owner behavior is excellent. Ordered Puttu, Dahi Vada and Poori Subzi. The prices are easy on the pocket and the quality of the food, portion size is excellent. Malgudi pics will take you back to nostalgia. A must visit place for south indian foodies and malgudi fans.

Visited after reading many rave reviews about the restaurant. The interioir d√©cor is very soothing with an old malgudi touch. However, the food was extremely average and nothing special to write about. On the contrary,¬†the¬†dishes available at Banana Leaf or Ramakrishna Lunch Home are way way better in quality, taste and freshness.Had Masala Dosa and Malgudi Special Uttapam,¬†but the ones available at Banana Leaf or Ramakrishna Lunch are much better in every which way. Although three types of chutneys are provided here at Malgudi.. yet the quantity of chutney provided is very laughable. Still looking for a South Indian fare that can match Banana Leaf and Ramkrishna Lunch home. Ammini¬†is the only restaurant where the staple South Indian food is better than the above two.

A tiny restaurant but very good food! We went for lunch, two of us had the unlimited thali and one of us had a dosa. The portions were good and very tasty. Being a Sunday the staff were maybe a bit run off their feet due to the crowd. I'm hoping service will be better next time I visit.

On a Sunday evening, waited for half an hour to get a table, but it was worth it. We ordered Kerela paratha with korma, saapad (thali) and idli and vada dipped in sambhar. The food is delicious. The prices are extremely reasonable. The only downside to the experience was the service. It was haphazard and not up to the level. 
We kept asking the server for the fried red chilli that is served with the food but he just turned a deaf ear to it. Finally after the food got over he got us green chillis. Also, the coconut chutney is served enough to go with one bite of the food. 
If the above can be looked into, it would be a complete experience.

Its all very well to be quaint and lovely and to have pretty artwork on the walls but this place has a looong way to go. We came on Sunday afternoon and the mornings TOI had a write up about South Indian joints in the city which included Pai. I suppose the place was not equipped to handle the rush at lunch hour. We did not get what we ordered and wrong orders came to our table thrice. Plates of extra gun powder plates of extra papad which we hadnt ordered were unceremoniously dumped on our table. The rawa mushroom dosa had no mushroom in it and when it was sent back and came again it had a few mushrooms sprinkled on top of the same dosa.

The owners have a young boy who was handling the billing etc. He is well spoken well mannered with customers and successfuly sold us a book too! He must be under 18 for sure. The owner came to him out of the blue and started scolding him.. you are too slow.. all this when all the customers are definitely within earshot. After a while something else went wrong at some other table and this boy was summoned inside. There followed an extremely loud uproar... the owner yelled at the boy not only in a most unpleasant and foul mannered way but also unfortunately for us patrons within view of some of us... the owners should have been in the dining area... pin drop silence and extreme awkwardness followed. This is not done! You are inviting trouble and frankly I do not approve of such shoddy behavior at any place least of all somewhere i am going to unwind on a Sunday... To top it all billing was all wrong not just for us but for two tables before us who were charged for things they did not order.

As far as the food is concerned disappointment here too.. the mini thali had only puris sambar masala curd papad and pickle. So basically a masala dosa with the dosa replaced by puri. The gunpowder dosa was too too dry with the gun powder falling off in flakes.. it should be patted down with enough ghee. The mushroom dosa had possible two-three mushrooms cut up and sprinked not inside but on top of the dosa.. the quantity of chutneys with all the food is too inadequate... see the pictures..

On the positive side everything was freshly made. The medu vada batter was excellent. The prices are reasonable and if these major service issues were handled better then perhaps it would be worth making this a regular joint.

Located in a small bylane in hazra area(near Hazra Law College) this simple joint flaunts nothing but good food and simplicity just like the mystic town of malgudi ! I instantly fell in love with the black and white depiction of malgudi and its inhabitants on the walls ‚Ä¶ kind of nostalgic ! We kept it clean and ordered for a Dosa and Coffee and liked them both. I quite liked the dhania and onion chutney they serve apart from the regular coconut chutney and sambar . It is easy on your pockets as well ÔÅä I do intend to visit again for their Sappad which is a south indian thali .

Simply OUTSTANDING! 
In terms of the food quality - Truly South Indian and makes you crave for more !
Neat and cosy ambience with the walls reminiscing of of the Malgudi days serial and of course R K Laxman. ..
The service is quick n efficient as well.
Perhaps the best South Indian joint in Kolkata and true value for money.
Try the unlimited Thali with options for Bise   Bele bhath or Curd rice ....The range of Dosa's is amazing ! 
End ur meal with Filter coffee.
Check out the directions before getting there.

A newly opened south india food joint, Pai's Malgudi is located on Garcha street, near Law collage.  A 20 cover small, well lit restaurant boosts of positive energy and full of vibrant feel. Painted in all white, the wall of the restaurant have hand painted Malgudi days caricatures and just being there will simply takes back you the the cult classic written by RK Naraynan.

The menu comprises of all popular south indian delicacies wherein they have this elements of experiments thrown here and there. My personal favourite is Dhania masala Dosa which tastes better with sweet lassi. They serve three kind of chutneys, all full of flavours with a rich taste with Dosa. Service is quick and proactive. They surely gonna do well considering the fact that the locality badly needed a decent food joint which is economical too and wherein one can drop in with office colleagues.

A newly opened joint located just opposite of Hazra Law College.. The restrau is not very spacious but the ambience is really cool.. It took me to the nostalgic world of malgudi days written by R. K. Narayan.. We ordered for sapaad,set dosa and butter dosa.. The food taste really good.. They provide three types of chutneys with dosas!! All of them were very good.. The service and the stuffs were also very nice!! Price is quite affordable.  Overall I had a pleasant time and will visit the place again!

So for starters, this 3 months old South Indian joint delivers quite well, quite more than the average ones. With seating capacity of only 20, this place may run into trouble as the food it is serving will get more people in time to come! Just avoid the fried idli and filter coffee and enjoy rest of the menu! Real value for money - worth every penny spent! Go for Malgudi, not a place to miss! Show stopper - Malgudi Blast Dosa!!!

You will be surely gripped by the ambiance if you have grown up with "malgudi days". ¬†Every bit of the restaurant has that south indian essence. the "tricolor" chutneys served along with the order is worth mention and the SS thalis too. Mysore masala Dosa a must try.Above all its value for money. A must visit .

Lovely south Indian restaurant. The paintings on wall reminds you of good old childhood days of R.K. Laxman's Malgudi Days. The staff are always ready to help you and suggest best order according to your needs. Though the place is small but it has its own warmth. They serve 3 chutneys with every dish which are great in taste. Mysore Bonda and Malgudi Blast Dosa is a must try. The owner is open to all feedback and herself keep a check on all reviews. Overall a good place for south Indian lovers... Good quality food at best price...
