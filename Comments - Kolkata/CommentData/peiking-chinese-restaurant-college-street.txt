One of the worth place to dine in at College Street. This place is situated just beside the Municipal Corporation in Surya Sen Street. I went here once to try out their Chowmine and it was a big mistake. The food tasted stale and poor. Too much oily and the Chicken Chow hardly had any Chicken pieces in it.
I wonder how they run their business.

This is a bong style barely tasty Chinese restaurant where mughlai dishes are also available. Every thing is sub standard. Service is surly. It has a business due to the location. Hardly any proper eateries around.

Very average kind of a restaurant. Had the Egg Fried Rice and Chilli Chicken from here once. Didn't like the food very much. Oily and unhealthy enough to kill your appetite. Portions are commendable, so is the pricing.

Even after staying in College Street I never tried this place. I visited here last evening. Ordered a plate of Chicken Chowmine. Quality was among one of the worst food that I had ever tasted. Poor quality Chowmine, cooked more poorly in lot of oil. After trying that I didn't feel like trying anything else from here. Still my friend was hungry so I asked for Chicken roll. And the staff replied that they need at least half an hour to make a roll because they were running short of Staff.
So I just paid for that shit Chowmine and left that place.
Too poor quality, please avoid.

So what do you do when you're hungry af in North Kolkata? You just step inside the nearest eatery you find. Peiking is that little messiah that keeps you from starving with good quantity and tasty fare.

Half plates each of Veg, Egg and Chicken Gravy Noodles were ordered along with a half plate of chilly potato.

Half plates were more than enough for a single person and could have been easily shared by two. Non-oily, homely noodles that is manna for a starved soul. The chilly potato was nicely done and wasn't overwhelming with red chilies. The perfect accompaniment to our noodles.

Don't judge by how it looks outside and don't feel awkward that people around you are ordering rice, dal etc. No AC, no bright lights, just normal tube lights and fans. Homely is the word for it.

I have visited this place during my intern while I was in this are since I was on the spree of trying different joint one for each day lunch.. the joint serves very average food and most importantly it is not hygienic.. I have seen may road side joint which are pretty clean and you are comfortable in having their food..
