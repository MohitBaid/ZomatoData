This cafe is located in Golpark, taking the right turn from the IDBI Bank (Golpark branch). The ambience of the place is pretty good. But the cafe itself is very small so not recommended for a large group, though they have another floor which I couldn't see for myself, which they open if the ground floor is filled.

I've been here a few times and I do like their food. But a few of the items are really pretty overpriced compared to other places, especially the beverage section. But if you're still craving some I'd definitely recommend to choose from their various selections of Hot Chocolates.
The other items are more or less priced okay. 

Coming to the quality of food, it is really good. I like their Tandoori Chicken Sandwich and BBQ Chicken Sandwich, the BBQ Chicken Sandwich being one of the best ones I've had. The Chicken Platter is also a good choice if you want to have a slightly heavier meal.

So if your only reason to visit is for a coffee or something along the line, there are better and cheaper options around, but for a full meal I would definitely recommend this place.

The staff themselves are capable enough so no complaints there.

And you can play your choice of music there, by connecting your phone to the speaker and they have free wifi, which is always a plus.

Went there on a date with a very special man.
There is romantic lighting i must say.
We just ordered two cold coffees and it was a beautiful date.
But this place is really really small.
I wish the upper floor could also be used.
But this place is over priced. No cafe would charge 315 for just two cold coffees.

On a rainy evening, I visited this place and taadaaaa, such a cute cafe. Located in the lane next to Anjali Jewellers, Golpark. Best place in Kolkata perhaps, to go out for a date. Though they can accommodate very few people, around 10-12 but the ambience is superb. I am simply amazed. 
We ordered cold coffee with chicken nuggets. Both the items tasted good enough. But was overpriced.

They charge GST extra.

This quaint little caf√© is located near Anjali Jewellers (Golpark). This charming place will give you Alice-in-wonderland feels once you enter. It is subtly lit and they have a nice collection of songs. The entire atmosphere is bound to sooth you. The cafe is beautifully decorated with framed quotes and with lovely cushions. 

It is a two storied caf√©. We went there on a fine Sunday evening. We sat downstairs. The menu is very interesting even though there aren't much to choose from. We wanted to order sandwiches but was disappointed to hear that sandwiches were not available. Instead we had Chicken Nuggets, Hot Chocolate and Classic Mojito. We had to wait for a while for the food as there was only one gentleman behind the counter. The prices are very reasonable too. However, I would request the management to add a few more items on the menu.

This quaint little place is located in the bylane of golpark near Santa's fantasea. This wooden little cafe will give you an old British vibe , with comfy sofas and quirky decor. We booked a table on the first floor for our friend's birthday celebration and they initially charged us with rs. 250 and we were told they will adjust the money with the food bill. The stuffs were really well mannered and helped us in every possible way. So we ordered 
CHICKEN NUGGETS - This was no different from the frozen food which we buy from the departmental stores and the size was also not satisfactory. 
FISH FINGER - This was again too tiny considering the price we paid and absolutely had no flavour in it. 
BROWNIE WITH ICE CREAM - This was the worst brownie I have ever tasted , it had a smell of coconut oil and we actually couldn't eat it. 
So this place might look pretty good but the food was not at all satisfactory. Again there was a bit miscommunication about the billing b/w the waiters which created a bit of inconvenience. Maybe not a place I would like to visit again. :(

We booked this place for one of our friend's birthday. Interior of this place is extremely gorgeous especially the first floor. It has a old rusty look with spotlights falling makes it really wonderful. Initial booking charges were 250/-. The staffs present their was extremely helpful. They even let use their music system.
Coming to the food part we ordered
1. fish finger
2.chicken nuggets and
3.chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream.
The fish finger was really tasty a bit short in length but acceptable.
Chicken nuggets well i didn't find it any different from the frozen nuggets which we buy from any departmental store.
Brownie, well this one was the worst brownie i had. It had coconut oil smell all over it. Tasted a bit bitter probably due too much of coco in it.
So overall this might be nice place by looks but not upto to the mark in terms of food.

The place is reaaaaaaaalllly small. Not meant for large groups at all. If you go in twos that might be apt. Inspite of being small, it is a very cosy spot. You can have long uninterrupted and undisturbed conversations here. They are trying to open up on the second floor as well. So once that opens up there will be more space. 

Coming to the food. Its good.

What I ordered : 

Mexican Chicken Sandwich - it was good. Full of tasty filling with lots of fries on the side. 

Cappucino - good. If you like you coffee sweet ask for sugar. Their coffee isn't sweet.

This quaint little cafe can aptly be called one of the hidden gems of Kolkata. We went there after having lunch in the adjoining Santa's Fantasea outlet. The place was so pretty that it was hard to miss. For a group of literature students that we were, the place visually resembled a little British bakery.¬†It was small but beautifully decorated, with a big ancient wall clock, intricate lampshades and quirky cushions on comfortable sofas.We had the hot chocolate and coffee which were standard. The Chocolate Brownie is one of the best I've ever tasted in the city.¬†Everyone should take some time off their schedules and visit this beautiful little place!

Located just two-three buildings before Santa's Fantasea (Golpark), this small cafe serves amazing coffee.
I went there for some beverage and ordered Vanilla Cappuccino, and was immensely impressed by it.

The place is very small yet the decor is impressive. Can't write much about the food but the Vanilla Cappuccino is definitely worth the price!

We went for a cup of coffee to this place.Its pretty small.There were just 3 tables and the place looked a bit cloistered.We had learnt via zomato that this place had top floor seating also but unfortunately that turned out to be untrue.When asked the man on the counter said this was the only space available.Hence we had to make do.The coffee was well made however; and if the place is empty then it is quite comfortable to relax and spend some time with friends.

I have given such ratings to few places. But this place deserve less than 1 rating .
Coming to the location.. Just located in the lane which goes along side the anjali jewellery shop. Very easy to locate.
From outside it is a cute little place with a attracting yellow little door to inside.
Firstly note it is a very very tiny place it has only 3 tables and can accomodate hardly 10 people, though it becomes too suffocating.
I got a place to sit. It was very suffocating inside.. And the ac was not working properly.
Now coming to the food..
Very limited menu and compared to the place the price were high.
High price can be paid if the food quality is good.. But unfortunately it was not good.
I ordered classic hot choclate..
It tasted just like chocolate complan.
I was never interested in having complan by paying about 120 bucks.
Then i ordered chicken sticks..
It was simply the sticks available in processed food section of spenscers.
Literally why should i pay double price for those food that are availble in the market i could easily buy them and sit at home with my ac on and watch tv while having them instead of that suffocating environment.
Literally will never visit this place.
And will suggest go and visit other cafes.. Kolkata has a lot place to hangout. Not this one. Please

There are so many cute cafes hidden in the lanes of Kolkata.
We spotted this cafe when we went to Santa's Fantasea,Golpark.Its located just beside it.
Finally,today we were craving some coffee and finger foods in this beautiful weather and this place came in our mind.
The cafe is tiny but well decked up with some really cool wooden message cards on the wall and cute cushions.
We found the place quite cozy.
The menu has like quite a variety of coffees,sandwiches and wraps.
We took the chicken platter,hazlenut cappuccino and Chicken strips.

‚Ä¢Chicken platter-It comprised of sausages,Salami,Chicken omelette and 4 toasts.There is option for add ons like cheese in omelettes.This is a very wholesome platter and highly recommended.
The omelette tasted amazing.
‚Ä¢Hazlenut cappuccino-A steaming hot cup of coffee with a subtle flavour of hazlenut.The coffee is really good.
‚Ä¢Chicken strip-8 pieces of chicken strip is tasty and fresh but yes tad bit overpriced.

Service is prompt.
They levy 18% taxes.
For small cute date or gossip over a cup of nice coffee,this place is perfect.

It's a tiny cafe tucked away at Golpark.
And I do mean tiny. Thankfully, I was the only customer during my visit so I had all the space available to myself.
They have minimal decor, the best of which is the "Happiness is" throw pillows.
I only ordered two beverages. One cappuccino, which I really liked. My sister took a green apple mojito, which she enjoy as well.
I hope to go back, when it's empty another time. ‚ù§Ô∏è

A quirky little joint at the neck of the slight bend in the lane, The Cafe Store was quite a little surprise. Boasting 3 tables, and more seating arrangements being made upstairs, this small and cute cafe is heartwarming when you enter. 

We tried:
1. Fiery hot chocolate (chocolate drink with chilli flakes - 3‚≠êÔ∏è
2. Crunchy hot chocolate - 3‚≠êÔ∏è
3. Chicken sticks - 4‚≠êÔ∏è

Would really appreciate if the chocolate drinks are more chocolate, and less milky/or chocolate flavoured milk based drinks that kids have.

Overall, 3.5‚≠êÔ∏è for the food & an additional 0.5‚≠êÔ∏è for the setup. Wish to return to try the menu in details.

Awesome place to hangout or to go for a coffee date. Hoping to visit the place soon to try more food.

It was a sudden Discovery while roaming around this place . I was in awe with their sweet and cute dec√≥r of this place in first sight . The coffee was really good . But you really don't have much choices when you have to satisfy yourself with good finger foods . It's much of a place where you can talk with people over a (or a few) cup(s) of coffee in a cosy air.

This cozy cafe might not have a lot of space, but the ambiance is just right for catching up over coffee. Since they have an open kitchen, you get to see your meal being prepared, and whether they're then sandwiches, omlettes or even just a drink, they're fresh and well-prepared. The overall feel factor is really high in this place with the yellow door, cushions, and hanging lanterns. Affordable, cozy and just really warm in its appeal, it won't disappoint you if you're looking for an opportunity to unwind.

This place is beautiful. The interior of this place will make you feel as if you're in a cottage beside a fireplace on top of a mountain. The food you get here is delicious as well , they're not that expensive either, making your overall visit worthwhile.

1. Hot Chocolates - There are a lot variations of this but each is delicious in it's own way. I personally love the Crunchy Hot Chocolate but would always recommend the rest.
2. Beverages - Beverages here are nice, both hot beverages and cold beverages, nothing to complain here either.
3. The Sandwiches - There aren't a lot many to choose from, but what I've had, I've loved them. They're well cooked, and they taste stunning.
4. The Wraps - Just like the Sandwiches, there isn't a lot to choose from, but I've tried each and loved them. A single dish serves a big wrap cut into two, pretty much like the rest.
5. The Platters - Personally I don't always dig Platters, it generally depends on the mood and there are only a handful of places that I prefer in this department and this is one of 'em. You can add Cheese to your Platter's Omlette if you want, it does taste a lot better in my opinion.

Too much overpriced food.the chicken salami omelette had no salami in it,and every food item(including bbq sandwich,cheese mayonnaise sandwiches) had excessive amount of sweetness to it.

I ordered Crunchy Hot Chocolate, Blue Lagoon, Mexican Wrap, OTCS Special Cold coffee, Green Apple Lemonade. Serving time is very fast and staffs were cordial. Food tasted great but very much overpriced. Will revisit if only the price is lowered by 30%.

However, it is a tiny and extremely comfortable place where you can sit with a book or your laptop with a drink or a snack for a long time.
Quaint little places such as these are rare in a city like Calcutta, which is why this place earns a 2.5 from me. Otherwise there is really nothing in there as a caf√© to praise.

This place was on my wishlist for long everytime I paid a visit to Santa's Fantasea. Once I came here with a friend to have coffee and some munchies. The place looked really attractive from outside. On entering, you would realise that it's very congested. There is a store selling boutique jewellery and all. The store is upstairs and stuffs are displayed in the ground floor too. The place had such a pathetic smell, moreover it was so congested that I was feeling really claustrophobic. So I came out without having anything. 
I think they should work on making the place eligible enough to sit and eat. Then I will come back and review again.

This place was on my wishlist for long everytime I paid a visit to Santa's Fantasea. Once I came here with a friend to have coffee and some munchies. The place looked really attractive from outside. On entering, you would realise that it's very congested. There is a store selling boutique jewellery and all. The store is upstairs and stuffs are displayed in the ground floor too. The place had such a pathetic smell, moreover it was so congested that I was feeling really claustrophobic. So I came out without having anything. 
I think they should work on making the place eligible enough to sit and eat. Then I will come back and review again.

It's a small Cafe with good decoration and free WiFi, located just a little inside the lane of Anjali Jewelers. We were a group of 5 and we ordered Pineapple Milkshake, ¬†Chocolate Milkshakes, Cold Coffee and a bitter version of Cold Coffee. The price was like CCD, a bit expensive and also their drinks preparation time was more than expected. But they didn't compromise on the taste and quality.

A small congested sitting arrangement.
Not an ideal place to 'hangout' with friends. 
A decent choice if one wants to get out of work on a lazy afternoon and sit alone, do some writing with a cup of coffee!
Service - fairly well!
Ambience - trendy!

I am to find a word that could describe my happiness and more felt during my visit to this place. If you are looking for a cozy corner in the city and feel like enjoying some good conversation over cushiony couches and furnitures this is the place to be. The cafe store is a discovery that has made me feel too good. We ordered for a Hot Chocolate, egg and mayo sandwich and Chicken Tandoori wrap. Food was good. And the Tandoori chicken wrap with a twist of fresh coriander conquered my heart. M coming back soon n this time the buttery hot chocolate will be on top of preferences. Cheers!!

A small cozy little place with amazing coffee and food is hard to find. This cafe near golpark ramakrishna mission is a perfect example of that. They have done their homework on coffee making and honestly they have done a good job. The coffee blend is just amazing. I have been looking for a proper coffee joint for a long time and being a coffee snob I am very picky about my coffee. Finally I found a place where they can make good coffee at such a reasonable price. To go with it, the food was also great. We ordered a cheesy chicken wrap, a Mexican chicken wrap and a double layred pork sandwich. The bread used for the wraps were perfect. They have followed all international standards about items in the menu card. The only drawback is the size of the place and the good news is they are soon going to expand the cafe. It's a must visit if you love real coffee.

Cute little cafe..Loved their simple yet stylish decor. Situated just near Santa's Fantasea. We ordered chicken mayonnaise sandwich,chicken wrap and cappuccino . üòÑ The sandwich was like home-made samdwiches, decent amount of chicken mixed with mayonnaise. But it could've been better I think. The chicken wrap was tasty.üòó Cappuccinoes were lukewarm hot..üòë So the taste of the foods could have been a lot better. Also the accomodation should be enlarged I think. üòÉ

Location- If you are travelling from ballygunj phari towards gariahat, cross the golpark circle. On the main road beside the kotak mahindra bank, a passage takes you to the small door on the left.

Ambience: A very small space with a maximum capacity of 6 to 7 is available. The seating is comfortable with artistic cushions aaccompanying the sofa-cum-seating arrangements. A jewellery gallery is also present on display in the cafe. 

Food: An average experience is expected as you dont have abubdant options on food or drinks. We ordered a Mexican veg cheese wrap, Chicken wrap, latte and a mocha. First came the mexican wrap which was nicely prepared from freshly cut vegetables and mayonnaise. The same is wrapped and then baked in the oven and served hot. Next came the chicken wrap which is strongly recommended by my friend

It's a small place in golpark. It has a very cute decor and limited seating of only around 7 people. They also have a junk jewellery store upstairs. It's mainly a cafe with more options in drinks than the food. The food is basic wraps , sandwiches and omelettes. I had the vegetarian special wrap but I did not like it. It was raw vegetables with a lot of mayo in a half cooked tortilla. It was very peppery too. But the only reason I like this place so much is for their coffee. They have different kinds from different areas of the world. We had the Colombian cappuccino , the Colombian Americano and the Bali Americano. They were really concentrated and really good. The hit that coffee is supposed to give you , it had that. The coffee smelled great and tasted great too. They have many varieties and the waiter is well versed in their types and the flavour they're supposed to give so you can choose accordingly. The entire pace had a cozy feel to it with the smell of lavender interspersing in between the roasted coffee smell. All in all it is a really good place for coffee.

There are very few places where you'll get a mug full good coffee. This is the place for true coffee lovers. Ornaate- The caf√© store will give you a fantastic range of International and national coffee. The Caf√© store is a coffee joint and also a very cozy hangout place for young people. Food is also very tempting. Specially their Chicken and Pork items. Anytime you can enjoy a sip of Espresso or cappuccino with some mouthful pork sandwiches.

A sudden rain in the july afternoon with a lookout for a shade pushed us inside this cafe.the tiny yellow window was a trailer of alice in wonderland.and after we entered the niche was a perfect pretty place with amazing coffee and bevrrages.people were nice and enthusiastic.the jewellery store had a beautiful  collection though though a little overpriced.
Felt pure bliss to find a cafe like this in my home town with my childhood friends. 
Monsoon break topped up with unexpected happiness.

A sudden plan of hangout with my cousin made us visit this place. It's a small cafe, located just opp of Anjali jewellers Golpark. First of all don't go by the size of the cafe, Ornaate will provide you a cozy atmosphere. Quite comfortable place for hangout. We ordered for Classic Mojito, Classic Hot chocolate & Barbeque sandwich. The order was served within a short period of time. Both mojito & hot chocolate were quite good in taste. But special mention Chicken Barbeque Sandwich, which was just lip-smacking. Chicken Barbeque Sandwich will always remain as one of my favorite at Ornaate. 
At the end its a must visit place for "Cafe Lovers".. <3

It's one tiny cafe that me n my friend visited this Wednesday as all other options were either about to shut or full. But then there are many good thing that you discover by accident. A teeny-weeny place is a nicely decorated place that will offer you warmth and has happy feel to it. The old walls have been nicely used for decor and you will find something interesting in every corner of the cafe. ¬†There is a happy corner with Happiness is... cushions and that's something that caught my friend's attention the moment we entered the place. They have very nicely done up the place. Now let's come to food. We didn't order much but just the regular Chicken Mayo Sandwich and Barbecue Chicken Sandwich with Green Apple Mojito and it was quite good. Would recommend it if you want to meet a friend over a cup of coffee and have loads to talk about.

Location: The lane beside Anjali Jewellers; Golpark. I saw this on my way to Santa's one day and that is when I decided I was gonna visit this cafe once!
Ambience: The place is teeny meeny tiny. It is extremely well decorated. The 'Happiness is' cushions were my personal favorite. Really liked the witty one-liners on small black boards.
I loved the cosy friendly vibe the place has!

Service: We were the only people at that time; so we got quick service and the waiter was friendly too :)
Food: We ordered one Mint Mocha Cold Coffee. I love mint. I ordered this purely based on its name and I am so happy I did . The coffee was excellent. Also had Strawberry Milk Shake. Well; what can ever go wrong with this drink?? Then we had Barbeque chicken sandwich. The sandwich was made really well.

All in all; loved the place and the food!!

Must-try for one of those lazy evenings when you just wanna sip some coffee and have comfor food :)

Located in Golpark near Anjali Jewellers lane, there is this small and cute caf√©, Ornaate. Well small would be an understatement, they have just 3 tables. But it‚Äôs remarkable what they have done with the space. Well done interiors.  I spotted this brand new caf√© as I was on my way to work and went there that very afternoon.¬†

We ordered Irish cappuccino, lemon tea and hot chocolate. Nothing out of the ordinary. Well I‚Äôve had better cappuccino in caf√© coffee day, so you can make the comparison, CCD not scoring very high on the points there. But the caf√© was so cute you‚Äôd want to visit again.¬†

Went there again after a couple of days, and this time I was disappointed with both the food as well as the service. We ordered a Chicken mayo sandwich, brownie and cappuccino. Would rate the food 2.5 out of 5. On paying the bill, the guy said they don‚Äôt have change. So we took some cookies. Oh and those burnt cookies, never having those again.¬†

However, it‚Äôs a cute little caf√© if you want to chill out with your friends, well not too many of them. :P

It is a very cute and nice place. The idea of making such a small place into a beautiful cafe is truly commendable.¬†
We had ordered Chicken Cheese Wrap and Classic Mojito. The food was equally good. And thanks for the Wifi as well :)¬†

I had tried an omlette with chicken and cheese, hazelnut cappuccino, green mojito, barbeque chicken sandwich and a red velvet cake.Everything tasted good.The place is run by a single staff and can barely take in 6-7 people at a time. 

If you have time on your hands and in mood to catch up with someone on a brunch this place wont disappoint you.

Ornaate- The Cafe Store, a little European theme caf√© placed at one corner of the street will get you thinking you about your childhood cartoon fantasy land. Has two storeys, one for their caf√© and the other for their Ornaate jewellery store, this place is okay for a one time visit when you have nowhere else to go.

Location: Ornaate Caf√© is located at Golpark. It is a few minutes walk from Anjali Jwellers. 

Food: the caf√© may look small and cute, but the food is here is average. 

Chicken Mayonnaise Sandwich: comes with the option of putting extra cheese, Chicken Mayonnaise Sandwich is nothing out of the world. Smeared with mayonnaise, this sandwich tastes like any other homemade mayo sandwich. This dish definitely needs to elevated flavor-wise. (3/5)

Chicken Platter: first of all, Pork Platter was not available which already sets the caf√© back a few points. Coming to the Chicken Platter, it comes with two sausages lacking serious flavor, two ordinary toasts, an omlette with chunks of chicken pieces in it, which tastes flat and lastly two salami which are a tad bit better than the rest of the elements on the dish. (2/5)

 Chocolate Sundae with Vanilla Ice Cream: this dessert is not listed on the menu but upon being specially requested they serve you their chocolate sundae. The scoops of ice creams are from Amul, as they would advertise right in front of you. It is not really worth having as they are so many better sundaes available at their decided price. This dessert is topped with a cookie on top. Price charged is Rs.150 exclusive of tax. (2/5)

Green Apple Mojito: disappointing to see how a caf√© does not really have their ingredients ready and upon making an order, the staff has to run to a store to purchase basic elements to make a mojito. There's a strong undercurrent of green apple flavor. Tastes more or less decent. (3/5)

Management: the staff there are courteous and friendly. Caf√© is maintained well. Well decorated with ornaments as the name goes, this place is a little too congested and small. Points on cleanliness. Ambience is warm.

The first thing that comes to my mind when I hear about ornate is small and cute. Located just before Santa's fantasea near golpark, this is actually a local cafe sort of place with a sitting arrangement of around 7 to 8 people at a time . Inspire of being small this place is decorated nicely and quiet clean. Food are OK sort of, nothing much to be exited of. On short a well place to sit and chat with anyone over cup of tea.

With all those lovely decorations, cute cushions and tastey hot chocolate, this place is unconventionally nice! Unlike other caf√©s in town, a small caf√© like this is perfect and cool in its own way!

heard a lot about this place but was really disappointed with the personal experience. the interior is way to dingy. the seating arrangement is not comfortable enough. the coffee they served was apt to be called lukewarm. it was not hot at all. and the hot chocolate wasn't anything exceptional. this place desperately needs to solve its space issues. although i would praise the indie look they have given to such a small area. the decorations are really nice.

This cafe is located in the lane beside Anjali Jewellers. It's a small establishment with only 3 place settings. The term cosy really suits this place.  Located in a garage, it has it's own appeal, i must say. A cool rainy afternoon, a cup of coffee and adda... Well, this is the perfect spot to do it. The waiter is polite and prompt in service. We ordered Irish cappuccinos and Blue lagoon mojitos, and we were not disappointed. They also have a jewellery shop on the floor above but i didn't really get time to check it out. Will surely do next time. Good spot to catch up with old friends or just chat with new ones. Ting :-)

I love the cushions there :P and the way they have decorated that place.
As for the food, I did not like the chicken nuggets at all. And the classic mojito was just fine enough. 
However, its pocket friendly and would be nice especially when you need to chill over lemonades.

I loved this tiny little place.... It just have 3tables...and that's what I like...this place is in the lane of anjali jewellers(golpark), so location is not a tough thing at all...the place made me feel like European caf√©, but it didn't quite reach to the level though, but they tried...they've got these special coffee which they get from all over the world....this month it's "Columbian coffee"...so one shud keep visiting this place to get all the flavours...this place very cosy and quiet...the only thing that was missing was the music...a coffee shop of this style shud definitely play some soothing music to compliment the place.... Anyways.. I'l just review on the items i'v tried...

Latte: nothing extraordinary about the latte...it was just nice....

Cuban Expresso shot: oohh! I loved it...not for everyone though....its bitter....a coffee lover would understand its taste better...

Mexican chicken sandwich: it was good..but I felt that Mexican tanginess was missing...still, the taste was good....

Mint iced tea: somehow it tasted ordinary, the flavour of the tea and the mint was missing...the staff asked me if I wanted mint leaves while I ordered this...I wondered why'd he ask that...mint iced tea is supposed to be given with that mint leaves for the mint flavour...that was lil wierd I felt...

French fries: they make the French fries in air fryers... And trust me it tastes bad... There was no taste at all...either fry them in oil or remove it from the menu...

I'd like to go there again for there for their ambience... Really nice...

Update:
Cheesy chicken wrap: till now this is the best thing I've had at this cafe...it was really good....

Italian Expresso shot: well, the Cuban Expresso is better than this one is all I have to say....

Kiwi ice tea: this was prety nice, better than mint ice tea...

A cozy cafe with lots cute items like cushions and lovely lights together with a junk jewellery shop overhead on the first floor seems a pretty idea for a quick bite. So we finally decided to give it a try after its raving popularity in Zomato. 

This review is based on the overall experience spanning two visits.

Located in the tiny lane beside Anjali Jewellers at Golpark (the same gali as Santa's Fantasea), Ornaate is a tiny cafe otherwise invisible from the main road. Lovely ambiance. Cozy chairs. I'd rather not comment on the jewellery section. The graph goes down as the food comes. 

To beat the heat, we usually go for something as simple as a BLUE LAGOON or a CHOCOLATE MILK SHAKE - both of which were way too ordinary for the price. In fact, the staff inside asked if I wanted some mint on the blue lagoon, to which I gladly nodded, before learning later they charge extra (‚Çπ35) for the mint! This is the first time I'm actually having to pay extra for something like this. Even then, the drink wasn't sweet enough and I didn't feel like having it at all. The milk shake was too bland - the essential flavor of chocolate was way too mild. 
Moving on to CHICKEN NUGGETS, which I must say, was an utter disappointment. The nuggets were as small as Cheetos Cheese Balls we used to gorge on during childhood. To add salt on the burn, the plain mayo dip was charged extra!
The only possible life savior was the MINT MOCHA COLD COFFEE which was something new as well. 

Note : As on 5/2/2015, the prices are steeper than the ones in the menu you see in Zomato. No extra tax but a service charge of 10% is levied on the total amount. 
Pocket pinch for a light snack : ‚Çπ800+ for two.

Decided to hit this place , near santas fantasea place was empty at around 6:30 pm and there were 2 attendants. We ordered the cheese chicken wrap and a egg mayo sandwich, taste wise the sandwich was nothing special but the wrap was spot on. The bill came at 314 bucks as they include serving charges 10 per dish, feels a bit cramped for room even as we were only 2 people.

I and a friend was waiting for another friend to join us for dinner on a cold December night when we spotted this little cafe and decided to go in for some tea. I decided to order a cupcake to go with my green tea and my friend chose a Darjileeng tea for himself. I was shocked to my core when they gave me a Twinings Tea Sachet and a cup of hot water. To add fuel to my misery, they microwaved the cupcake which I ordered and presentated me with a cupcake whose frosting formed a little puddle at the base of the cake. The poor cream couldn't brave the heat of the oven and melted forming a pool underneath. I don't know, how can somebody serve that to the customer and yet they did and I immediately sent it back. they came back with a normal one which on being touched by a spoon was hard as wood and I had to struggle for a few seconds before I could dig my spoon in. A little bit of honesty and sincerity is really important when you open an eatery and expect customers to dole out hard-earned money for the food that you offer. I was disgusted with my experience and the nonchalance of the owner/manager made it even worse.

This is really cute cafe cum jewellery store located in one of the lanes near Golpark. The place is tiny but has really cozy decor. It is the perfect place to catch up with friends over some coffee. In coffees, we tried the Irish cappuccino and the Vanilla Cappuccino. They were both quite strong and yummy. We also had the Chicken mayo sandwich and the almond coffee slice cake. They were both good but nothing to rave about. I'd definitely recommend this place for casual hangouts.

I had my eyes on this cafe for a long time and today I tried my luck. A nice cozy place. Made me yearn for fireplace and fairy tales. Well decorated. Only two staffs are there - young men who are friendly and fast. I met the owner too - Neil - a stylish young man with a mane of hair which reminded me of Bobby Deol of yesteryears.
I was feeling chilly so I chose crunchy hot chocolate and tandoori chicken wrap. It arrived in no time. Ah, this cafe knows that with food, you should serve tissue papers too. 10/10 on that.
The wraps came first. Delicious but heavy. The beverage followed. Taste perfect. I loved it, but I had expected more crunch into it, which was not there.
Apart from food, the little cafe sells junk jewelleries too- my favourite accessory. Very good and rare collection. I chose a few of them.
Good experience altogether and worth recommending and a second visit.

A sudden hang out with my cousin brought us here. It was a weekday evening when we decided to meet after work with no clue of our hang out place. Suddenly i located this cafe on zomato and we hurried to the joint. It's located near anjali jewellers, golpark. A very small,cozy,cute outlet with hardly 3 tables and 8-9 chairs,well decorated with paintings and colorful cushions. They have a junk jewellery shop upstairs. Since i heard a lot about their special coffees, both of us were determined to have coffee. Also the weather encouraged us; it was the first rain of the winter heralding the onset of chilly nights. We ordered one cappuccino and one Portuguese coffee and OTCS omelette and chicken nuggets. They made us wait almost half an hour to get served. Coffee was filled upto half of the mug and tasted like an ordinary one and nothing special as they claimed it to be. Omelette was stuffed with pork and chicken and served with a piece of toast. It was good in taste and soft. Then came the chicken nuggets- 5 small pieces with mayonnaise dip and it was average in taste. Then we went for red velvet cake. It was soft and tasted good. All the items were over priced with very less quantity. Nothing extra ordinary and the joint is basically over hyped.

A very warm and cozy cafe. I loved the interior decor. Such lovely concept. 
Coming to food,
We ordered BBQ chicken sandwich.
Well I would rate it 4.5/5. It was so yummy. :D
Then we ordered Pork Platter.
It had Bacon, salami,ham,bread,egg toast. A delicious preparation indeed. I would rate it 4/5.
Then we ordered Blue lagoon & French fries with mayo dip, well this part disappointed me a bit. 
As a whole mouth watering dishes
With perfect quantity and quality.
Would like to visit it again.

Ornate cafe ambience wise was okayish.
Coming to the food part we ordered a chocolate milkshake(which was okay),crunchy hot chocolate (it wasnt thick and actually felt like water)
Chicken cheese wrap which wasn't really great given the fact chicken filling was less and they put in more vegetables(a chicken shawarma wrap better anyday).
The only good thing we ordered was the barbeque sandwich.
The location of the cafe is great but they could really improve their food quality.

Food - Quality can be improved. We ordered their Fiery hot chocolate which was okayish but their chocolate pyramid pastry was yummy!

Pocket-pinch - Not to highly priced.
They have wifi feature and also has an accessories section. Their clothing store is right beside this cafe.

A cute cafe and also a jewellery store tucked away in one corner in Golpark, was such a delight to come across. You get segregated from the hustle & bustle of the city the moment you step into this cafe. The ambience will sweep you off your feet if you are a sucker for cosy rooms and a cup of coffee on any evenings. Alone time or a fun adda session with your loved ones? It will not disappoint you. 

The Pork Platter was scrumptious (though I think I would have loved the bacon to be crispy, but that's a personal choice). And, that was the most expensive dish on the menu. The strawberry milkshake had an unusual taste, one that can grow on you with time. I saw a lot of desserts as well and cannot wait to get back to this place gobble some up! 

All in all it was a pleasant experience!

Ornaate - cozy, well decorated and not to forget some yummy food. Even though the floor space of the cafe is not much, it is elegantly done up. The moment you enter the cafe it will make you feel like you are sitting in a cafe you have seen in one of your favourite British film. The food itself it really yummy and pretty economical :) Ornaate is a definite recommendation!

Recommended: pork platter :)

Looks very exclusive , well decorated all around and surely you step in with expectation ..
Inside ambience and very friendly Atanu the Magician bringing in all the magic drink , Cameroon Coffe with latte  , also the the double decker porky were not the run off the mill but really a hearts delight food which were also presented with a ornamental theme too.
As it turns out to be much beyond expectation ... You can feel the moving passion in art whether food or jewelry with equal percussion n skill.
At least for time the experience could not have been better . It's total containment . 
Revisit surely will happen n actually cannot be judgmental on such places where exclusive art is the theme... I wish them steady success with Ornate the coffe shop theme

A quaint little place tucked away in a lane of golpark.. This place serves quality food and has friendly staff. However a bit more items on the menu would be fine. The number of items are pretty limited. The chocolate Jupiter was extremely tasty so was the double decker pork sandwich. The wraps are also good. Do try...

Location- This is a small cafe located in golpark. Its in the lane of anjali jwellers just opposite to uco bank.
Ambiance- Ornaate- The cafe store is cute and beautifully decorated shop with wonderful lighting with appropriate furnitures.
Food quality and quantity-Well,this is the first time I visited this place just for a short meeting so couldn't taste much items.  I have tasted the otcs strawberry shake and blue mojito with added mints. Both the drinks were upto the mark. 
Other than the cafe they run a junk jwellery business. Few of the items were present in the cafe. The main junk jwellery shop is in the upstairs with awesome collections but price are on the higher side.
I would like to visit this place more often and try more of their items.

A cozy, dainty cafe located beside the lane of Anjali Jewellers, Golpark. This place was recommended by one of my friends. Must say a lovely place for good coffee, cakes and sandwiches.¬†¬†

Food: Ordered cold coffee, Blue lagoon, coffee almond cake and chocolate pyramid. Coffee tasted extraordinary, blue lagoon was good, cakes were fresh and yum!

Ambience: Nicely done interiors, minimalist decor, loved their idea of couch and cushions(nice homely feeling). It can accommodate around 10 people at a time.

Service: Quick service, the staff was kind and courteous.¬†

It also has a jewellery shop on the first floor, presenting an amazing collection of ethnic fusion jewellery. Loved all of them.¬†

Will visit again for sure! :)

A quaint little place in the lane adjacent to Anjali jewellers in Golpork.  Decked up like an English cafe with some semi precious jewellery which are an absolute misfit. However the store boasts of the best Chicken Meyo grilled sandwiches available and a sinfully good buttery hot choclate...puro makhon!! üëçüëç

PS Try out the OTCS special omlette as well...its a surprise!!

I am very impressed by the interiors.
It is SO prettily done. Small yet cosy.
And quirky, be it the counter,the drum-like hanging clock or the walls.

Coming to the food.
We had the egg and mayo sandwich which was decent,good enough.
The cake tasted a little bitter.

Hope to see more items on the menu. Desserts specially.

I saw this place when I went to Santa's fantasy and I immediately bookmarked it. Today afternoon went there for a cup of coffee. This place is really small. We ordered a cool blue with mint and a hazelnut cappuccino. The cool blue was really good but the cappuccino was cold. I asked them to warm it which they did and told me that cappuccinos are warm drink and not hot(but my drink was not even warm). I am not complaining as the cappuccino tasted good. Then we ordered their special sandwich which was good and was served with chips. Overall its a decent cafe and worth visiting. The main problem is the space.

I visited this quaint little cafe by accident today. Having got drenched, I was just looking to get something hot down my throat when I spotted it by the side of a small lane. To my utter surprise I found them serving various exotic coffee blends from around the world. Unfortunately I have made it a habit to move around without much cash and had not noticed that I was running really short today. They have not yet been set up to accept cards (although the owner did indicate that it was in the offing). The fear of exhausting all my cash made me settle for the house blend Americano. Even that was surprisingly good. While I can not claim to be a great coffee expert (for instance, I do not turn up my nose at instant coffee) I am sure that it would have been appreciated by the connoisseurs among my friends. The rest of their spread, though limited, looks enticing. I do intend to return ( with plenty of cash) and try some of them out soon.

Ornaate-The cafe store is located just beside the lane of Anjali jewellers, golpark. I have visited this place with a friend in a rainy afternoon for some desserts. This is a place which really attracts you. It is small but appealing, the decoration and interiors are really amazing. They also have a jewellery and accessories shop on the top floor, this combination gives the place an extra smart and pleasant look.Overall,ambience is excellent and enjoyable.
We have tried the yummy chocolates pastry 'Jupitar',it's wonderful in taste.Unable to enjoy other products because we have gone there just after the lunch but eagerly looking forward to taste their coffees also as I am a coffee addicted person.

the decor of the cafe is something that you would love.... but if u consider the food they offer...worst!!! the fiery hot chocolate was innovative. But the chicken nuggets was full of shit...the portion of chicken they use to make the nuggets was dull...disappointed.

Amazing little place. Beautiful decor. Ornaate - The Cafe Store is a must-try for coffee enthusiasts: you won't believe the variety they pack unless you give it a visit! I had an Irish Cappuccino, and it was one of the best cups of coffee i've ever had. Period. 
Don't forget to check out what's in store upstairs! ;) 
Heard a lot about their amazing wraps, will definitely give them a try on my next visit.

This little cafe is situated in Golpark, near the Anjali Jeweller's store opposite RKM, Golpark. It was quite a discovery and going there is always a pleasant experience. The ground floor, which houses the cafe, is extremely cozy. Wr ordered the Hot Chocolate and OTCS Green Apple Crusher, and both were extremely good, and priced very reasonably. Priced at around Rs. 80, the hot chocolate is out of the world. The staff is extremely friendly and the owners were very polite and interactive. I was told that the international coffee available here is extremely good- and I am looking forward to trying it during my next visit.

Such a nice cafe. Totally all new concept and design. Such a small place and so smartly designed that you wont feel..rather it will give you a feeling of a private cafe and a cosy feeling. Coffees are too good. The international coffees are must try. Foods have quite a wide range. Ambience is so good. Overall a must go place for coffee. Till now the best ever coffee in Kolkata.

A pretty little cafe. The ambiance was on point. It is the kind of place where you would want to be in on a rainy day. We chanced upon it whilst going to Santa's Fantasea which is a stone's throw away.¬†
Since it was close to closing time, we only had coffee. The Hazelnut Cappuccino was nice, but I wish it was a little less sweet though.

This is a quaint little cafe located off the road away from the hustle and bustle of the city traffic.
Inspite of being a very small cafe the ambience is very cute and well decorated. They even have a small jewellery store to boast in the top floor and some items are on display in the cafe itself. I could go on and on about the cute little "happiness is" cushions and the small mosaic lights hanging but I'm going off track.... :p
We ordered for cold coffee and walnut brownie ice cream along with something else which I cannot remember now.
Everything tasted pretty nice though the cold coffee was a tad bit bitter.
Nice little cozy place though.  :)

I visited the place after my friend's recommendation and ended up in front of pretty little green cafe with a yellow front door.  The place may appear a little  smaller from the outside.. But for size surely doesn't matter, once you're through the door. Cozy  ,comforting interiors along with an entire corner decorated by attractive trinkets along with funky couches and cushions.  There's the jewellery store upstairs, a must check out for the enthusiasts. The best part of course was thankfully the food! We tried the Chicken Mexican and Chicken tandoori wraps along with the Irish coffee, which were all quite delicious( and reasonably priced of course!). Looking forward to trying the rest of the menu.

This place is quite easy to locate..though it is a small cafe, the ambience is very nice and cosy and makes one feel at home..the coffee served is very good and at a reasonable price.They also have many international flavours of coffee and stuff like double shot coffee on their menu. Though I tried Cappuccino on my first visit, I will surely go back and try the other coffee flavours and also the other stuff on their menu.The staff is extremely well mannered and service is prompt.

Visited Ornaate - The Cafe Store on 13 June! At first I thought I'd never fit in to this TINY place! Surprise! Surprise! Not only did I fit in, but felt nice and comfortable too! A look at the MENU had me confused! Everything sounded delicious! Went for the PORK PLATTER! It was not only good, but filling too! 9/10 for everything I ate! 10/10 for the buttered toast! Need to go again to try the other items!!!

This is a first for me.... Reviewing an eatery.... and am glad that its Ornaate!!!... Being not much of a coffee afficionado, I was pretty skeptical at the elaborate international blends that were on offer... Tried one of the many available coffee shots, which was a real turn on for a decaffeinated person like me... Am sure that the coffee buffs of the city would surely find more appreciation here..... Which brings me to the food on offer.... the menu is a nice array of antipastos and light meals.... delectably chosen... I tried one of the Chicken Wraps, and it was a treat to savour.... will definitely do the encore of the Wrap next time as well.... it was that good!!!..... The Cafe has been aptly done up giving it a lovely boutique flavour which really compliments the nature and format of the store. The location is very convenient and at that the same time tad away from the hustle of the arterial thoroughfare, which makes it even better... Hopefully, the Cafe continues to dole out goodies in the days to come.... Strongly Recommended!!!!

... you be pleasantly surprised what this small little place has to offer. My girl bribed me into this place saying she wants to check out some cool accessories while I can sip a kenyan coffee and check my mails using their FREE wi-fi. I loved the warm ambience, soft music, coffee and chicken wraps so much - that I went twice again for breakfast and for just being myself with my coffee. Parking might not be dat easy in dat small lane and the place might be little small in size - but it is certainly a warm coffee shop where you can hang around with your friends to recharge yourself and check out offers for the ladies. Pretty affordable concept cafe store in kolkata.

In the city of joy, I found this European style cafe near golpark anjali jewelers. Decor and cozy little corner of this place took my heart..  And because I am a foodie, I tried most of the items from their menu.. Let's start with hash browns.. I think this is the only place in Kolkata where one can find hash browns... But what I liked the most were chicken tandoor wrap and their special sandwich.. My friend tried the chicken platter which contains two slice of bread with butter, chicken omelette, yummylicious sausages, salami and French fries.. ( I liked the way they fry.. Absolutely OIL FREE) I give 5brownie points to this pocket friendly and cozy cafe..
P.s: I simply loved their concept... While my man was busy tasting the lip smacking brownie with ice cream I went to upstair to take a round of the jewelry store and it amazed me.. Different kind of junk , modern and customized jewelry made me to visit the shop more often...

the newly opened right opp to my place..The other day we got two brownies packed thinking them to excel in terms of taste just like the decor of the place looks like...But sadly it was such a disaster...i thought I was munching on stale biscuits rather than fresh soft brownies..Its a big No no..Absolute let down..I never tasted such horrible brownies..Total waste of money
