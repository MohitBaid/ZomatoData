I am not a parantha person but yesterday suddenly my taste buds wanted to try them after watching a movie at Lake Mall. This kiosk is to the extreme left end once you enter the Yum Street Food Court. Two ladies were in charge of the stall with smiling face.

First I ordered an Aloo parantha which was made within 10mins. All of us that is me, my mother and two of our family friends simply loved. They were too soft with decent amount of stuffing. In a thali kind of plate two paranthas came divided into 4 parts with achar, dahi and pudina chutney. The dahi was too yum and tasty and so was the pudina chutney which complemented the aloo paranthas very well.

Next again went to the counter, thanked them for the delicious paranthas and placed an order for Methi Parantha this time which too was made pretty fast. And yes once again they hit the bull's eye. 2 paranthas came divided into 4 halves. All 4 of us thoroughlly enjoyed this variant too with dahi, pickle and pudina chutney. Only what I felt was the chilly content to be bit high though the methi saag stuffing was adequate and tasted good.

Again third time visited the kiosk, shared my feedback for the methi paranthas and placed an order for Kesar Fulfi. They did not have the regular size thus had to order the royal size.

The kulfi came accompanied with faludas over it and tasted decent although 100 rupees I guess is pretty much for its size but yes had a perfect dessert to end our evening.

Overall I loved the joint and would definitely recommend other foodies to give it a shot.
