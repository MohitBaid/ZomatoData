We came over this place near Golpark. Never expected it to turn out so great looking from outside. Never judge a book by its cover. üòÖ

The interior is well lit and decorated. They have a very well behaved service people in there. 

Everything we tried were up to the mark. 

1. Milk coffee. 
2. Chocolate Crunchy Shake.
3. Peanut Milk Shake
4. Apple pie. 
5. Chocolate tart.

A good place with good ambience.
It is situated in golpark opposite to ccd.
Ambience really good.
Coming to food i ordered chicken lasagna 
The taste was mindblowing and quantity is also good.
Price is bit high.
Overall behaviour of the stuff is also courtageous.
Hope to go again to try their other dishes.
Prices all are exclusive of tax.

This is a great breakfast cafe for people who want to have something meaty and different on their plate. Their meat platters are quite good and very filling. You almost always have to take someone to share it with u. I loved the pork sausages with the runny egg poach. Their great collection of Darjeeling tea and Vietnamese Coffee are must tries. They also have a small tea boutique where you can buy beautiful tea sets and exotic tea leaves. All in all, it's a worth a travel to Golpark from my place :-)

Thorougly disappointed

The first impression you get is of sitting in a cozy Darjeeling cafe. Interiors are sober with mild lights hanging on each table with a straw shade. And, I fall for this place on the very first side.

We ordered -
Chicken Sausages and egg, chocolate shake, margherita pizza, and (this one is my favorite) nathmul's exotic green tea. Right from the wooden furniture and decor to the milk bottle shaped glasses. The exquisite selection of tea and coffee given a feeling of exclusivity and class.

The owners, the waiters all were ever so welcoming and polite that we felt like being at their home and not at any coffee shop. The live music though not very professional was good and the boys were interactive and it felt more like a household Adda with music and beverages. I am so much in love which this place, that I can go more than two times.

Keep up the good work. Recommend to everyone, who prefers peaceful places. :)

Had heard a lot about the whistling kettle. It had been on my wish list for a long time. The ambiance of this place is cosy and superb during winters. The service is slow. The staff needs to be attentive. The live performance was excellent, infact that is what stole the show. 
What I ordered:- Black coffee and a Chicken Ham& Cheese sandwich. 
The black coffee was the normal coffee, coming to the sandwich it didn't have the wow factor and it didn't have any chips or fries accompanying it, which was disappointing.I hope the food quality improves. 
The place is good for a one time visit or incase you want to try other dishes on the menu.

We had our morning breakfast and sausages were a part of it, we found it was not properly fried and also the pancake they served was not upto the mark , bacon was overfried which is not expected from the standard set by Whistling Kettle..

The ambience was good though , service staff needs to be trained while taking orders.

Above all its an experience we want to forget from Whistling Kettle and expect better quality of food for which people flock in..

Surprisingly even after reading rave reviews, was not very pleased after visiting here. 
Had a pork platter and a chicken baked lasagne..the pork platter was well to do but the bacon was saltier and it would fill only one well eater. The lasagne although figuring on their favourites was really spicy and very very heavy of the layers although the quantity was huge.Not at all the Italian counterpart. 
The wait time is fair and ambience sweet. But they dnt give u water until asked for , not even glasses! 
Well maybe their tea needs tasting but for now theres room for improvement

This is one of my favourite place. It has a nice ambience and they cook the best chicken lasagne in Kolkata. The pork platter is extremely good,the pizza is mouth watering. Music adds spark to the place and the always smiling staff adds to it. I simply adore this place. If not anything go there for having Vietnamese coffee.

This quaint little cafe is tucked in a small lane beside Golpark Mouchak that gives away a feel of a shop from outside.But as you step in, you enter into this pretty little tea cafe decorated artistically.The interiors have been done up in wooden framework with dimly light paper lights hanging overhead.The fine china teaware display at the reception is absolutely mesmerizing.

We settled ourselves in one of the cosy corners.The servers are very warm and well versed with the menu.For our order we asked for a kiwi shake ,ham platter and a black coffee.

üçÅKiwi shake-- It would be safe to say that the milkshake tasted nothing like a kiwi shake.It was bland and tasted like lactogen

üçÅBlack coffee--I am an ardent black coffee lover.The coffee was not that great as i expected

üçÅHam salami egg platter-- The platter was an absolutely delight.The meat were perfectly cooked and the sunny side up sat pretty there.

Overall the place is nice if you want to have a evening gossip session but it is quite overpriced compared to other cafes in town.

We had the plater serving all the ham bacon and sausages with eggs. Pretty satisfactory. Good music. Mint tea was pretty amazing, however the milkshakes were very disappointing. Banana milkshake, chocolate milkshake, all of it I would say. But ambience and service is upto the mark. Good place for an all day breakfast. Pizza and pasta not so much.

Through a little shop selling teas and its accessories, the doors open to a small cafe which would be on every tea fanatic's list. Although I am not an ardent tea lover, just for the sake of exploring, and because I heard a lot of praises about the cafe, I thought of giving it a try.
The place is subtle in appearance. We tucked ourselves in one corner of the cafe and ordered some coffee. To my surprise, the place specialising in teas, also sells good coffees. Had a cheese omelette, a veg grilled sandwich and a chocolate brownie. Everything was good. The service was fast and prices good enough to fit the pocket. The place is good for long quiet chats and meetup.

A wonderful place to spend some quite time with your friends and indulge in some really good Darjeeling Tea.  The ambience is beautiful but it seemed like it was asking for some space, the tables are too closely spaced.  It was brimming with people so had to wait around 25min before we got a table.  But the wait was worthy as the yellow tea,  vitamese coffee and special variety Darjeeling Tea had the real aroma to get lost in Darjeeling.

Located down the Mouchak lane in Golpark, this body cafe offers a mountain caf√© feeling in the middle of congested South Kolkata. The wooden decor gives this place a quaint feel. I went there with my mother and we were treated to exquisite lemon tea and spicy herbal tea. We accompanied the tea with some cheese and caramelized onion grilled sandwiches which were delightful. Can't wait to go back and try more of their tea selection as well as their all day breakfast.

Such a cute place! Nice and cosy cafe for a conversation with your foodie-half (foodie better-half hehe). We accompanied our conversations with-

Lemon tea - Very flavourful (9/10)

Cold coffee - Nice! (8.5/10)

Nutella pancakes - MUST HAVE! Fluffy pancakes with generous amount of nutella (10/10)

Rum ball - okayish (6/10)

The cheque was Rs. 515/-
Had a nice time there. Looking forward to try the other varieties of breakfast and pasta.

Just one suggestion to the service team, please provide a spoon with the thick shakes which have some solid contents in them like brownies or cookies. The straws are not just enough to have them because people like me who have a craze for such lovely chocolate stuffs would definitely not want to leave the cookies or brownies in the glasses after the smooth shake is done with...!! üòä

In the bylanes of South Calcutta resides a call from the hill. Sipping through aromatic teas you're taken on a ride through the hills of Darjeeling. That too the Darjeeling of the British Raj set amidst cacophony of the bustling Golpark. It's like visiting Calcutta on the iconic Darjeeling toy train with memories emanating from the hills. Added to this vintage charm and somber sophisticated sips of tea coffee, is the quintessential Bangali bhodrolok waiting to be an English gentleman. So the near perfect English breakfast of toasts, sauted vegetables, mashed potatoes, pork sausages and bacon is the getaway. Even more if it happens to be the season of loved conspiracies - Christmas. So hop on the ride, this train will travel through your dreams. To the hills ladies and gentlemen!

Lasagna is my favorite but here it was a bit salty. Hopefully next tym when i visit i will be served with a better one.

The whistling kettle is a beautiful cafe in golpark. It has a counter where tea sets and kettles are showcased and they can be bought as well. The interior is nicely done with a section where a guitar is placed and if you are lucky then you can catch a live performance also. Coming to the food, tried the chicken supremo pizza, chicken Ham sandwich, chocolate shake and strawberry shake. Each and every item was excellent. The green teas available here are very refreshing too.

Ordered the penne pasta with shredded chicken in spicy sauce and a supreme pizza and was not let down. The quantity was quite a lot and the food was delicious. 
Will recommend this place to everyone who wants to grab some good tea and casual light food in a cozy atmosphere.

This restaurant was in my wish list for a long time ever since i have heard that one can get the meat platter of keventer's from Darjeeling, over here. Visited this place last night. It was not all hard to locate. Its near mouchak and aminia in golpark. From the entrance it looked small but upon entering the place seemed quite spacious. There was a place for live music too and a small bakery counter consisting of chocolate and lemon tarts, brownies and other sorts of dry cakes. 
  We ordered chicken meat platter consisting of 2 egg poach, 5 pieces of chicken salami and sausage and 2 slices of meat loaf. Though the quantity was really less than the actually quantity served at keventer's. But back here in kolkata, getting the exact taste of the original. platter, the quantity doesn't matter any more. This filled us up for the night, keeping in mind our appetite is really small. Then we ordered cookie shake which so thick and gooey filled with so much chocolate and crushed cookies. Though i had an eye on the nathmulls tea and the bakery section, may be that i will leave for my next visit.

¬†I went there to meet my friend and just chat over food and relax and loved it.

This place was high on my wishlist as I am very fond of the English style breakfast and good Darjeeling Tea. As it was breakfast time I went for their Pork Combo and a cup of hot Darjeeling tea. The combo came with sausages, bacon, egg, baked beans, garlic mushrooms, mashed potato, baked tomato and butter toast. It was wholesome and very tasty. Tea was out of the world. Service was slightly on the slower side as it took 15 minutes for them to get my bill. However, considering a Sunday morning I can bear with that! The decor is extremely pleasing and they have a music corner too. This cafe is extremely well located too and is easy to find out.

Ordered a whole lot of things at once.We ordered chicken ham sandwich, chicken pepperoni pizza, baked spinach lasagne and chicken salami sandwich. The sandwiches tasted like an average salami and ham sandwiches would taste.You can't really go wrong with that, which they didn't. Now coming to the lasagne, I was very skeptical initially while trying these dish, because it's a dish which requires both perfection and skills plus you also got to develop the taste out of a boring vegetables called spinach, and they passed it to, I also liked the fact that they were quite generous with the cheese.Finally the chicken pepperoni pizza was my least favourite of all,no complaints regarding the crust,but I personally felt that the chicken pepperoni were a bit hard to chew.However the other stuffs were good enough to win my heart and tummy,so this place has made its way into one of my highly recommended places to eat in kolkata.

Pocket friendly cafe. Where you get to taste variety of foods. Bacon platter is a must try where you will be getting ham even. A calm environment along with good service and good food will suit your mood anytime. Milk shakes are good here and if you want cream over them They will definitely taste heavenly. Varieties of tea and other drinks are available even. 
Just try the bacon here. Be it in a platter or the bacon sandwich.

The Whistling Kettle had been on my wishlist for quite some time. A nice little boutique cafe to delight in some delicious hot tea or coffee with savouries, pancakes or milkshakes, it's tucked away cosily in one of the lanes of Golpark, not far from Mouchak sweet shop and close to a Cafe Coffee Day outlet. A tea lover's heaven, the name of the place itself suggests a whistling kettle brewing tea. ‚òï

Over the past months it has slowly gained popularity, for on a Sunday evening it was pretty crowded and some of us had to wait a while to get a table.

The entrance-cum-reception has shelves lined with dainty and ornamental Oriental and Western tea sets, teacups, beautifully painted teapots, mugs, kettles, pretty tea light candles etc. including a toy train replica. While one waits one can browse or even indulge in purchasing from among the lovely accessories on display, or from a stock of exquisite gourmet tea bags and loose-leaf tea. The founder of the cafe happens to be the owner of Nathmulls Tea in Darjeeling, thus all their teas are sourced from Nathmulls.

The decor is smart and stylish, moderately lit with hanging paper lanterns showcasing a dais with a brick-styled backdrop for live band performances, walled monochrome photographs of old colonial Darjeeling, framed thanka paintings, neat and comfy wooden furniture, wood-panelled ceiling etc. coupled with soothing retro music adding warmth to the interior. There's also a little counter displaying gorgeous-looking tarts, brownies, teacakes for sale.

We opted for the Nathmulls Premium White Tea and Lasagne Al Ferno.

The White Tea was served in a champagne flute, and before sipping the server made us (it is done for everyone opting for tea) inhale the aroma of the fresh tea leaves from a kettle. The piping hot brew tasted different, without sugar, unlike conventional tea but very well made and of premium quality. Mentally I noted to try out the Vietnamese Coffee the next time I'm around.

Lasagna is supposedly the oldest type of pasta. The Lasagne Al Ferno, one of the popular picks, was a dish of minced chicken (lamb is also available) wrapped in layers of baked pasta and served in a rectangular glass tray. Delish to taste, the lasagne sheets were soft and warm, as were the generous portions of chicken filling inside tasting like spicy keema.

The bill came in a cute wicker basket.
The servers are attentive and polite but the dishes take quite a long time to be prepared and brought to the table, almost 20/25 minutes to say the least. For me the worse part was the long wait for the food to arrive. üò¥üò™ 
Initially we'd chosen Milk Coffee but the person taking orders had informed that it'll take some time for the beverage to be prepared, hence we'd gone for tea. The tea and shakes are however served early.

For tea connoisseurs or fetishists and avid tea-drinkers like me, and those fond of pasta, pork sausages, sandwiches, salami, English breakfasts, this charming tea boutique is a jewel of a place. 
To get a taste of the Darjeeling hills, sprawling tea gardens, a slice of Keventers and Glenary's Bakery, and relish a cup of warm exotic Darjeeling tea, do visit The Whistling Kettle. :)

The best pancakes I have had in the city. A cosy little place. Visited a couple of times. I mostly go for the pancake because it is so good. I hope to order something else soon. The only bummer is that the prices are a little too high. Otherwise lovely place.

My family has visited this place a couple of times and have tried their tea,Strawberry Shake and Chilli Cheese Toast.I have only been able to try the Chilli Cheese Toast as part of take away and really liked it as it was really really spicy since it was specifically ordered that away.My family liked the ambience and service though I was not a part of it.Overall,seems to be a nice place but prices are high.

The place looks nice and spacious from outside but actually its pretty small. The day i visited it was packed with people and hence we had to wait 15 minutes. 
We ordered a cold coffee, a strawberry shake and a chocolate milkshake along with chocolate tarts. 
The milkshakes were good and filling and totally worth the price. The tarts were pretty good too.

The staff should've been a bit more polite. They also have live music but the day i went it wasn't there, although it should've been.

We went to this quaint little eatery in a by-lane of Golpark for breakfast. The place looks like a memoir shop from outside, but inside, it gives you some really  warm, Keventers and Glenary's vibes like the ones in Darjeeling. 
We went for breakfast, and therefore, we sampled their breakfast menu.
The food, to be honest was disappointing .
We ordered Sausages, Ham, Bacon, Fried eggs, and Sandwiches, out of which only the Ham was worth the taste. The green tea at the end was pretty good. And the desserts and bakery are worth a try too :)
Everything else was either overcooked or drenched in oil. I really don't know what went wrong. The staff is really amiable and ready to help, but I did sense some unprofessionalism in their part.
Overall, I wouldn't easily go there for a second time unless I really have to.

Every porl lover should try their pork platter. Had orderd a pork jumbo sandwich once but it was just ok. A must try at this place is also the vietnamese coffee.

Okay so went there yesterday evening with  expecting live music but there wasnot any.
The place is very beautifully decorated.
 We ordered two milk shakes one chocolate and the other mango. Both tasted good.
I dint like the stuff here. They were not really friendly.
Then we ordered one chicken salami and cheese sandwich grilled...going by the milkshakes i thought it would be really good for the price they were taking for it.
It was little in quantity.
Lack of cheese.
Tasted burnt.
Dint like it.
I dont know why people are giving such good reviews and i had really good expectations from this place and it all went to waste.
This place is overpriced.
Food is average.
People here are snobbish idk why.
Only the interior decoration and the background music is good. I dont think i will come here again.

Quaint decor , led to high expectations on the quality of their food. 
Service was passable - you need to hail the wait staff if you need something.
Food ? It‚Äôs not worth the money you pay - far better options elsewhere. The pasta is a serious let down and being charged extra for grilling sandwiches is a crime. The platters could have rectified the culinary nightmare , but like others pointed out - those platters leave a lot to be desired. 

Oh - if you are in the mood for some veg food - there‚Äôs only beans on (soggy) toast. 

Tea ? Sure - that‚Äôs the USP of this place but they need to serve it in cups and not brandy snifters or wine goblets - the glassware they use , is suitable for wine and not hot tea ! They should glass mugs since tea needs to display its color and hues. 

If the tea can‚Äôt be served right nor is the food worthwhile , what do you go here for is something I am trying to comprehend.

A cafe centred all around tea is sure to attract all tea lovers.

Ambience- the place is decorated with cups,kettles and other showpieces open for sale. Walls with black and white frames looks like a cafe from the hills. The seats are comfy.
Menu and price- they have a wide menu of tea and coffee. And food items are quite good.

Food- we had pork,ham,sausage,bacon and egg platter, nutella pancakes and pork omlette. For tea we had the limited edition, lemon tea of black type of tea.
Pros- Love the tea. The platter was quite good.
Cons- The omlette was a bit turn off.
Price- it's not very difficult on the pockets.

All over a nice experience. Will definitely recommend the place for their amazing tea

Really wanted to try this out since some time. I am the rare Bengali who hasn't had the fortune of visiting darjeeling and having breakfast at keventers. So you can understand the amount of expectation I was carrying. We ordered chicken ham and pork salami sandwiches, pork bacon and sausages and crunchy cookie shakes. The sandwiches where okay but not mind-blowing. The grilling charges of 30 per sandwich seemed a tad high to me. The pork sausages were the biggest let down. They were not pure meat fillings and came in ridiculous sizes (like a French fry). The fact that the service was slow and inefficient did not help the cause either. On asking for water we were offered packaged mineral water or tap water. Last time I checked, tap water in India is not drinkable and eateries are supposed to be equipped with the basic facility of providing free drinking water. Heck, even movie halls have been forced to provide water. I think this is a serious violation and something the owners should take a note of.
Not all was bad though, the ambience was nice and the bacon were pretty good. But, then again, you cannot go wrong with fried bacon, right?

Average food really average. The Vietnamese coffee is however worth a try. Never order bacon here. It's not worth the price. They serve decent chicken sausages. But that's all. I've tried their platters and they are pretty average. Service  is slow, they don't serve regular water. They serve only Himalaya water that I completely dislike. D√©cor is nice and comfortable. Visit only if you are a tea or coffee lover. Else bypass it. This place is honestly over-hyped.

Liike it is rightly said that 1st impression is the last impression there guys nailed it for me and my mom...brunch on a Tuesday never tested so good..2 reasons hospitality and the food is to die for...
1.Pork pepproni pizza...
(Honestly no worse to define how brilliant it was made...thin crust...)
2.lamn lasagne..
(Minced meet was too amazing and the dish was loaded with cheese..)
3.Rissoto Scampi...
(Good helping of prawns and u could taste the parmesan cheese..shamelessly asked for more cheese and was given more)
4.Peanut butter and banana mikl shake..
(Never had something like that before)
Highly highly recommended to all..
Thank you to the entire team for comming up with such an amazing place.

This is what u call a real boutique place..little Darjeeling I would say..as I write my review I dwell more and more nostalgic about this place..have heard form many a ppl bout this new cafe but couldn't make it there earlier..
Last weekend me and my dad finally made it to The Whistling Kettle..there spread of breakfast is amazing..our love for pork was one more reason y we  went there and trust me they turned out to be much more than what we expected..
1..pork bacon sandwich...lip snaking good
2.pork platter..all the pigs were crying to us..
3.pork ham fried...oh la is
4.cheese garlic toast...cheesy to the core..
Ambience 5* and the lemon grass flavour adds to it..
Staff
Restaurants and cafes in Calcutta should learn from them what guest hospitality is..
Special thanks to Dipen who guided us through..
An initiative taken by the famous Nathmulls of Darjeeling and lemme tell u super initiative..
Kudos to the team Whistling Kettle.

This is quite a nice place at Golpark that is well known for it's food and top notch hospitality. 
Let me start with the ambience, the place is a bit dim-lit and spacious, which makes it comfortable to be in and there's also a corner dedicated to live music , whenever that happens. 
To add up on this , the food is definitely worth the visit, though not all perfection in the sandwiches' department but in the rest, there is a wide range of lip smacking dishes you could have here. They're all well cooked and in good quantity, leaving you with not much to complain about.
But most of all, the promises that I felt were kept from word to word, is hospitality. The people are very nice around here, they attend you immediately and make sure you're having a wonderful experience along the way. Their friendly behaviour as well as professionalism is striking and definitely worth mentioning.
Overall, a definite recommendation to everyone out there.

Located near Mouchak, The Whistling Kettle is one nice cafe to chill during the weekends. We ordered Nutella pancakes, spinach lasagna and chocolate shake. Let's talk about the food first, it was delicious and fresh. Oh! The chocolate shake, though. Ambience is very nice and the guy who played sarod so beautifully, just made my day. If anyone knows him, please convey him the same (he has a pony tail and sports a beard). There is one thing, I would like to highlight - The service, it is slow. I understood that you guys prepare fresh meal on spot, but you should not let a customer wait for above 50 minutes. Else, I highly recommend the place for food and music.

It's quite easy to locate , get down at golpark and then  follow google maps (2mins walk)
The first thing that impressed me immensely was the decor and the seating. This place also has provision for live music shows .
We ordered Honey Pancakes and The Chicken Platter
The pancakes were the best I'vr had though the platter could've been so much better.
The pricing is a bit high compared to quality and quantity .
Otherwise it's an amazing cafe where you can spend some time and have great food

My mother and myself wanted to spend some time at a good caf√© and narrowed down to this place, considering the Zomato reviews. It was worth the try. We were going to try the risotto but the chef offered to cook up something different.

* Veg Italian Rice dish (the chef told me the name, but I forgot). -- Brilliant! 
Nutella Banana Pancakes -- Little over-roasted but super yumm!

2 dishes were enough for the two of us. 

Pocket pinch - 700/- 
I feel it is a little more than my expectation, but it was an evening spent well at a good caf√© with yumm food. üòä

A small eatery as well as a store, this place was in my bucket list for a while. I finally managed to tick this off my list when a friend of mine insisted on meeting her in that area. The seating area is actually quite small and dimly lit. We were not really hungry thanks to the hot and humid weather outside, so ordered a cold coffee and lamb lasagne. 

The lasagne was quite sufficient for the two of us and very well prepared. The service however was not top notch.

The several kinds of teas served here gives this place a certain kind of authenticity that is kinda unique. The food here is fantastic with a special shoutout to the lasagna (its was sooo good). Although they served us the wrong drinks, it wasnt too bad cuz the alternate drinks served were quite enjoyable.

With only the view of the magnificient¬†Kanchenjunga missing, this place has it all. Absolutely superb collection of tea, some nice coffee and the fantastic meat platter combos from Keventer's.The interior is quite cozy and has the appearance of a wooden cafe from the hills of English Times.There is a tool with a guitar and you can go and play it and sing songs as well.The price is a bit on the higher side, but it is well worth a visit anytime 11:00 am onwards.

Stopped by there for a quick drink and ordered herbal spiced tea. The tea was perfectly tasty and aromatic and was served in a wine glass. The awkwardness is - the stem of the glass is too short to hold and the bubble of the glass is too hot to hold :). However an unique experience ! Their collection of little and cute collectibles are really impressive too.

In two words "cute joint". I just loved the ambience its really nice. Its not a BIG get together type joint rather small meeting place, can bring your family too for some light to medium munchies. Food is also good & I really loved the variety of shakes they offer, something for everyone. Staff are helpful. Since this is my first visit didnt try too much on the menu so giving 3.5, but I am sure it will increase in my next visit.

So on my birthday I went there and I will never regret my decision. From mouchak walk towards the CCD and it's there,diagonally opposite ! Getting inside you will get an amazing vibe , a music arena , wooden decor , quirky paintings , comfy seats for perfect date nights maybe. They have made a good usage of a very small place I must say. So it was bhaiphota and we were pretty full , so opted for a minimal order

CHICKEN SAUSAGE SALAMI PLATTER - This was heaven , loaded with sausages and salami and a poached egg this should be any non vegetarians absolute delight. The salami and sausages were tender and juicy. One can accompany it with garlic bread which tastes amazing as I have tried it already from here before.

LASAGNA AL FERNO - Loaded with cheese and minced chicken this was one of the best lasagna I have ever tasted and it was of enormous quantity.

And again , their hospitality is amazing. My friends arranged for a cake and the stuffs really helped us by serving extra plates , lighting the candles and even they packed the leftover cake. And never to forget , the singer there sang Happy Birthday to me which I completely loved and he also sang a tune on my request. They indeed made my evening very special. :)

Located at the heart of Golpark area, it's a small cafe where you get a variety of sandwiches, pastas, pizzas, tea, coffee, shakes and pastries. It's a paradise for tea-lovers. The entry has a place where they sell Nathmull's tea from Darjeeling and the cafe is located inside. This place is interestingly decorated and the service is prompt. A must visit if you want to chill out over a cup of tea.

A small cafeteria at the heart of golpark. This place has opened a few months back and the entry has a tea store selling Nathmull's tea from Darjeeling. The cafe at the end has a lot to offer oder than some great beverages. They serve pretty good sandwiches and the pocket pinch is also on the lower side!

Located in the heart of golpark beside golpark CCD.

As you enter an eye-catching arrey of kettlery awaits you along with different variants of tea which can be purchased. 

They have an acoustic set up for performance which is really heartening to see, as hardly places are like there which supports local talents in terms of performing arts.

The seating and decor is very much wooden alongside the music being ethnic tribal. 

Service is nice though I didn't like the part that they only serve packaged water and Also they didn't serve us glasses to drink the water from. 

Coming to the food we ordered Chocolate Mint Oreo shake along with a cake with was decent enough and for the main course we stuck to pizza, it had a nice layer of cheese with thin crust.

Bill for two was 600INR+ all inclusive 

This place though is a must more for tea lovers as the variety is just fab in terms of tea to be consumed also the variety available for purchase

The place is situated at Golpark, Gariahat. Nice place with nice decor and feel. The staff was quite friendly and interactive. The food was okay not that good. Zomato reads that it is Rs.600 for 2 which is totally false. Carry good cash if you want your apetite to be satisfied. 600 wont do. Thank you

Disadvantages :- 
‚Äª The menu doesn't offer much choices. It tends to play around with different versions salami and tea. 
‚ÄªThey don't keep a water in the tables, you can get water only if you ask for it or else they wont offer you any. They charge you for the bottle of water. 
‚Äª The food was okayish. 
The pork salami grilled sandwich was good. 
The chicken salami was bland and okayish. 
The thin crust pizza had too less cheese and the taste was okay. 
Advantages:- 
Good ambience. 
They might even let you play the guitar kept in a corner of the cafe. 
You can buy different kinds of tea leaves as a gift or something. 
The food is okay, worth the cost quantity wise but i wouldn't say it was worth it taste wise.

In terms of ambience - it's pretty classy. Unfortunately each time I visited this place there was no live music being played.

What used to be a gift shop has transformed into a cafe which is now the next bookmark in every foodie's list. 
The entry has a waiting area with the billing area on one side and an entire wall section containing kettles on the other side. Kettles in all shapes and colors adorn the wall of the waiting area. It gives an artistic look and justifies the theme of the cafe. 
I visited this place on a Sunday and there were at least 10 people waiting. I don't remember when I had seen so many people waiting to enter in a cafe. 
Surprisingly it only took 15 mins for our turn and I was impressed by their fast service and efficient management. 
There is a section for live music and a separate counter for sweets in the seating section. I think the space could have been included in the seating section. The ambience is soulful as they continuously play a soft rythmic music in the background. 
The menu is set into separate long laminated papers with the strategy to skip a section when the demand of the customers is not met. The same situation was experienced on a Sunday evening when we had to restrict ourselves from ordering any items from the Italian section. 
Mushroom Grilled Sandwich, Cold Coffee and Brownie with Ice cream were the items ordered from the available options.
The taste was average and there wasn't anything special about the food. The cold coffee was served in a glass bottle similar to the ones provided by Keventers; although only half as good as the specialists. 
Overall, except the ambience and the service I did not find anything special about this place. I feel i would have a better experience the next time and hope to have some clicks too.

I don't know if I ordered the wrong dish, but the Risotto Al Polo (I hope I'm not getting the name wrong. If you want to know which dish I'm talking about, it's the chicken dish in the rice subsection of the menu) was BAD. It was horrible.
THE TEA WAS GORGEOUS THOUGH.
I will keep going back for the tea but the food? I don't think so

A cute little place, as if taken out from Darjeeling. The place is very neatly done. The place offered Live music and the guy singing was really doing a great job! The ambiance was very nice and they have very friendly staffs.
I generally avoid having sandwiches when I am eating out, but seeing the different options in the menu card I felt tempted. We ordered Pork Ham Sandwich and Eggs Bacon Sandwich and both tasted awesome and end to end it was full of stuffing. The Kiwi Milk shake as well as Mango milk shake both tasted great! Kiwi Milk shake wins the prize.
The only negative point is the place is very small for which you need to wait for sometime before you can be seated.

So my friend and I decided to try out this new cafe in Golpark. What we were not aware of was the fact that this place is all about the tea, and we were diehard coffee folks! Anyway, when you first enter the cafe, it is the tea shop cum waiting area, and the actual seating is in another room on the inside. The outer room has an extensive display of tea varieties as well as fancy cups and teapots! The idea is to sample a cup or pot of tea and to come out and buy the same variant. 
After about fifteen minutes if waiting, we finally got a table inside. The actual restaurant area has a dias for live music, unfortunately we were not able to witness any that evening. There is also a pastry counter which has lemon tarts, apple pies etc. on display. The menu is threefold, one is the tea menu, one is the pizza and pasta menu and the third one is the all day breakfast menu. The menus are reportedly sourced from Keventers in Darjeeling!
Most of the Darjeeling tea variants were obviously not available, and also no coffee was available (they don't serve milk coffee in the evening.. sad :/ ). We ordered a couple of herbal teas - spicy and basil and a House Special Eggs and Bacon Sandwich. We wanted the sandwich to be grilled but the waiter told us that the house special sandwiches were pan fried. The sandwiches were very tasty and the tea was light. 
There was a continuous Zen sort of music which was playing in the background which was a tad bit irritating. The waiters were slightly inadept, they dropped a bit if the hot tea on the table and we're not able to explain the menu too well. Will get better with practice I'm sure. They have competition in the form of First Flush right next door which is also a Tea joint, which is also a very decent place (check out my review of the same).
Overall, it's a nice place to get pork, bacon and other breakfast items, but if you are a coffee person you will be disappointed. Still, do visit it over to make up your mind!

Amazing Decor. Amazing Service. Prime Location. 
Most importantly, one the best tea I've ever had. They surely are doing justice to their name. Loved their first flush and also the second flush. You can buy packed tea leaves for your home. The sandwich I had was a GOOD sandwich to accompany the tea. Pocket pinch is slightly higher than other caf√©s but totally worth it. 

If all these were not enough to attract you, they have live music too! 

P. S. I deducted 0.5 because of no open air place to have cigarette with your tea/coffee!

This place was recommended to me by some friends who grew up with me in Kurseong. Since i am currently based in Kolkata and get to go home only twice a year if i am lucky. This place reminded me of the hills the minute I stepped foot inside. The cafe has its walls filled with photographs of the Darjeeling hills. The place is warm and the hosts make sure their guests are very comfortable.
I was pleasantly surprised to hear some very familiar nepali songs playing which i last heard when i was in school. Nostalgia is the best way to define what i felt there.
Coming to the food, i was once again taken by surprise when i saw the menu was a replica of the one at Keventers, Darjeeling. I was elated once again.
I ordered a chicken sausage platter and chicken sandwich and lemon tea. The platter was too perfect for words, the sandwich was decent. The tea was served in a wine glass and was perfectly brewed. I ordered a brownie too. But wasn't impressed by it at all. 
However, Whistling Kettle definitely managed to bring back many many memories. A must visit for everyone.

Being Calcuttans, Darjeeling-Kurseong-Mirik and hills allure us a lot. And I think most of us will agree with me on this. Darjeeling is a near-to-the-heart place for me; because of a multitude of reasons ‚Äì be it the pleasant weather, the cozy calmness in the air, the tourism attractions, the views and scenic beauty or the food. When it comes to food in Darjeeling, Keventer‚Äôs and Glenary‚Äôs always leave a mark ‚Äì and we Calcuttans so wish that we had something of that sort out here in Kolkata. Our search seems to end when Mr. Sailesh Sarda and his wife Mrs. Bonisha Sharma Sarda has come up with The Whistling Kettle in Kolkata. Mr. Sarda being the fourth-generation owner of Nathmulls of Darjeeling Chowrasta, knows exactly how to quench the Darjeeling thirst of the people of Calcutta. That‚Äôs why this cafe ‚Äì The Whistling Kettle, with the essence and touch of the hills.

Came to know about this place through zomato.
Finally on nobomi this year me with my bff visited this one and had a wonderful experience‚ù§

Location : easy to locate,near golpark, the lane beside mouchak and opposite of CCD.

Decoration : i loved it very much,so attractive,it was an eyecatcher i must admit,near the wall there were small kettles and many things placed in the racks which were for sale.
Then there was a small corner which was specially for live music for a particular time..and i clicked pictures too..there was a guitar and two chair and mike for the singers..
Beside that,there was an area for cakes and cookies which will make your tastebuds feel to have them asapüòÉ

Ambience : soothing and peaceful and so good i mean i am falling out of words,the music i guess it was north eastern and it was a good vibe and was like 'i am feeling so calm and good' wala thingüòç
Positive vibes which i felt most while chilling thereüòå

Hospitality : they welcomed us with a smiling face and told us that no seat was available so we had to wait for over half an hour cause it was puja time and people were having breakfast after a tiring late night pandel hopping so the manager told that's why they were not leaving so early but trust me they behaved well in such a familiar way, we sat on the waiting area inside.
And when they got a table for us they made us seated and apologized for making us wait so long and we understood for there was a valid reason.

Food : well after having such impressive things around we ordered our food finally -
1) chocolate shake - yummyüòã
2) chicken sausage - i can still feel the tasteüòå
3) chicken salami grilled sandwich - wow too goodüëå

Foods were tasty and enough for both of us and we had a mouthwatering breakfast over thereüòã

Such a mesmerizing place and i was very happy that i went there. Nobomi started with a stunning place for sureüòç

RecommendedüòÄ

Located near Golpark, the Whistling Kettle, though not very spacious but has a decent decor, the accommodation is not very comfortable with the tables being too small to accommodate three people.(i am talking about the small round tables with 3 chairs surrounding them)

The staff is quite friendly and the ambience is good as well. Coming to food, it tastes okay and a bit overpriced (definitely more than Rs. 600 for two). Shakes are quite good.

Food : 3/5

A small joint, kind of hard to locate at first, but then the bright gate welcomes you to this cosy hangout with a small stage for 2 which is perfect for a stand up or live music. So full marks for Ambience. Be it the hanging lamps or the uber cool lighting.
Food options are decent. Vegetarians, if you are going for breakfast, you won‚Äôt enjoy this place much. We ordered pan cakes and caramelised onions and cheese sandwich. Both were very well made. But then, due to lack of options, thats all that we could get. The staff is not to say unfriendly, but they don‚Äôt make you feel very comfortable to say the least.
This place is still a good hangout joint. Can do better of the options are increased and the staff is a bit more welcoming.

The two main attractions are - Nathmull's and Keventers. Price is reasonable. Ambience is one of a kind. Decoration is eye-catching. Service is good. Food is awesome. Lasagna and the brownie is mouth- filling. All these makes it highly recommendable.

We ordered a large pot of Nathmulls Exotic Tea, Pork Sausage, Bacon and Egg Fried (just like Keventers) and a Vietnamese Coffee from the Today's Special Menu.
The tea was so refreshing and beautiful. The Pork platter was good.The Vietnamese Coffee was served in an unique manner. A filter was placed over a glass, the filtered coffee poured over a thick layer of condensed milk. It was bit sweet, but the flavour was really good. 
Loved the ambience and staffs were courteous. 
I would love to visit this place during their live music sessions.

Got a Darjeeling feel. Very well behaved staff. Coming to the food, we ordered SPAGHETTI BOLOGNESE(with Chicken) and RISOTTO AL POLLO. Both the dishes were mouth-wateringly delicious. Loved them.

This beautiful cozy restaurant is very small in space but tastefully decorated. Big groups may be difficult to accommodate. It's very popular and situated close to Mouchak at Golpark. 
The food is good. If you are looking for a taste of good tea and continental food then this is the place to be. 
However they are not very good with service. Will take ages sometimes to come take your order. And unless you ask will not even serve you water. Both times I went, has to ask for water, cutlery and napkins. The basics are mostly missing. They will however leave you to be around as long as you like.

Location: A little into the alley by Mouchak sweets in Golpark, Gariahat it falls on your right.

Ambience: So you go inside the fairytale bedecked door and instantly get transported to quaint little cafe, with wooden interiors and b/w photographs adorning the walls. It has live music and a very hilly feel to it. 

Food: I tried their fungi mushroom pizza which was absolutely yum along with spicy herbal tea and my friends ordered cold coffee with ice cream. Each of the dishes were delicious and service was extremely prompt. Inspite of going in on a top pujo hour, we got our tables within 10 mins and piping hot food arrived within 10 mins of order. Nice experience overall!

How this place rekindles memory of good old time at the Darjeeling Mall!
Exquisitely crafted bric-a-brac across the counter takes you down memory lane.
The food befits such glory.
A long cup of Ruby and freshly baked almond cake here can light up my dark days.
Egg and bacon sandwiches are a favourite. 
You may also explore the Pizza Supremo. Crispy crust, baked to near perfection.
I have issues with their White tea, though. Nothing near to what they serve at the Darjeeling Chowrasta outlet of Nathmulls.
But the hospitality of the staff is compensation enough.
Cheers to you!

This cafe located near Golpark CCD will definitely give you a feeling of Darjeeling in the plane. They serve you fresh Darjeeling tea along with beautiful sandwiches and sausages. In a post Pujo lazy Sunday morning we visited this place. The ambience , the decor the loud music playing -all were perfect to make your day. The staffs were courteous. We had Nathmulls iced lemon tea with chicken salami sandwich and chicken ham sandwich. The wiches were tasty and the tea was very refreshing. If you are in a mood then u can play the guitar too.

On soshti evening we five friends paid a visit to this cafe. Located at an easily reachable place,  it was a bit crowded but we could spent a couple of hours there. The interior is well decorated with photos, a small place for live music and a lovely ceiling. Ordered for grilled cheese & mushroom sandwiches, Magerhita pizza & brownie with ice cream. Though a little slow at work the staff were very cordial. If you are looking for a pocket friendly cafe with items that tastes amazing then do give this a visit.

The food :
Pork Platter - nothing great. Macazzo 's pork platter tastes far far better. 
Lamb Lasagne was still ok. 
The pork jumbo sandwich - completely tasteless. A homemade sandwich tastes better than that. 

Never been to any caf√© with such horrible hospitality before. We ordered for a small tea pot (for two) Nathmulls exotic tea and asked for an extra empty cup so that 3of us can share, since none of us wanted to have a big cupful of tea. They denied us the empty cup saying it's not their company policy. So if you want to taste & share it between more than two person, please carry a cup with you. & the tea is really not that great in taste for a Rs. 300/- (for two cups). Abar Baithak 's tea tastes way better and really pocket friendly. 

Serving regular water is a norm for every restaurant in India. But very conveniently they explained that they have a water issue in the building, so they can only serve you a 500ml himalaya packaged drinking water. I think a restaurant of 4.1zomato rating can actually buy a 20litre water jar if it faces any such difficulties. Or keep lesser priced packaged drinking water. 

They are just exploiting the name of Keventers & the Glenary's. 

Our evening got spoilt.

1. Kiwi Shake: The shake was a little too sweet but overall they did justice to the kiwi shake. It costs Rs 120(without tax) which is reasonable with respect to the quantity they provide.
2. Mango Shake: This shake was equally good but a little too sweet. You can't have much of it. It costs Rs 120(without tax) which is reasonable.
3. Nathmulls Specialities: So as the restaurant's name suggest us to order tea we ordered this speciality tea. I was disappointed with the quantity of the tea for Rs 125 and the taste was nothing extraordinary. I have had better tea in Kolkata. They provide the tea in a wine glass which looks really nice and anything new is always appreciated.
4. Chicken Ham Sandwich (Grilled): This tasted amazing. But they charged Rs 30 for the grilling. So the sandwich costs around Rs 160(without tax) which wasn't mentioned explicitly.
5. Pork Sausage Bacon Ham and Egg Fried: I, being a pork lover, was very excited to try this out and finally I did. I loved the sausages. The bacon was dry and no where close to Keventers in Darjeeling. The eggs were very soft and melted in our mouths. The ham was good enough. It costs Rs 295( without tax) but the quantity is too less.
People should try out this place and then be a judge for themselves.

A beautiful tea cafe that adds the Darjeeling magic to Kolkata. It offers two main attractions from the hillstation - Keventers & Nathmulls. The meat platters are the perfect way to start your day alongside some really soothing tea. 

We went there on a friend's birthday breakfast. The d√©cor and the ambience is elegant and serene. Decorated with some beautiful pictures and attest hanging lamp shades. It is guaranteed to make you feel the nostalgia of Darjeeling. The service is really appreciable and also quite quick.  

Being a green tea fan, I just couldn't miss out on the special Nathmulls green tea. The magic touch to this place is the way they serve tea. Before the tea is been poured into elegant wine glasses from the tea pots we are asked to smell the aroma of the tea leaves. The tea was absolutely soothing & was one of the best green teas I've ever tasted. This place is a true paradise for every tea lover. It bound to leave you mesmerized with every bit. 

Coming to the food - since we were planning for a light breakfast we ordered the chicken salami sandwich and the chicken jumbo special sandwich, which truly abides by its name. It is difficult to finish the jumbo sandwich by one person. Along with that, we ordered for sausages which was perfectly cooked and it tasted wonderful. So not just for tea, but if you're looking for a good English breakfast this place promises to serve the best. Couldn't try the meat platters, but I sure look forward to try them out next time. 

Totally recommended to try out this new cafe which has been quite the talk of the town lately. And oh yes, they have live music in the evenings which definitely adds up to the ambience. 

Food : 5/5

Okay so this place is located near Mouchak sweets shop in Golpark. I found the ambiance to be immensely mystic. No kidding but you will actually find yourself to be at peace in the comfy couches with the beautiful wall hangings around you. Obviously I went for breakfast with few of my friends. We had exotic black tea, black coffee, cold coffee. The black tea was too good. Very much refreshing. I personally ordered for the pork bacon ham and eggs platter. I am totally fully satisfied. Also, we ordered chicken platters, cheese omelette, and the delicious grilled cheese mushroom sandwich. Everything was on fleek including the hospitality. I would love to visit again and try the desserts. :)

A walk on the Mall in Darjeeling, a ride on the lovely little toy train in the hills ‚Ä¶. Memories of happily stuffing your face at Keventer‚Äôs, if you‚Äôre partial to these then you will love The Whistling Kettle. The Nathmull‚Äôs Tea Boutique with a great selection of their tea‚Äôs as well as a beautiful selection of Tea Pots, Kettles and accessories make up a cozy little boutique which leads into The Whistling Kettle. The wood paneled warmth makes you feel mellow the minute you step in. Some thoughtfully selected photographs add to the ambiance. One corner has a small stage for live music on some evenings and there is a counter full of tarts, tea cakes and brownies on offer. We are seated in a quieter corner and settle back with a sigh of contentment.

Whistling kettle is a new kid on the block of cafes in South Kolkata. Went there for breakfast with a friend on a Saturday morning. It is a shop selling tea and behind that is the cafe. It is a joint venture of Nathmulls and Keventers from Darjeeling. I loved the ambience.. beautifully done. Ordered for a chicken sausage salami platter, nathmulls iced magic, nathmulls exotic and marble cake. Tea and food is good but nothing extraordinary but i quite liked the presentation of the tea. Pricing is quite high. Service was prompt though. Overall a decent place.

A wonderful cost place with best combination and options for exotic tea. I ordered Iced Magic, the tea was perfect! It was not sweet and was a perfect mix of tea and lemon flavour. My friends ordered Vietnamese coffee! As I write, I get the taste of it. The staff is friendly because owners take care of customers and they know what they want to deliver. The ambience is pretty chai-conversation friendly. Added advantage is somebody plays live music there all time. The food was a great compliment to drinks. So the ovens also whistled! Search the place, reach there and its a nice place to be at for all day breakfast.

Now this is one place that is really "whistling". It's located just opposite to a CCD in Golpark, I'm sure it's giving CCD a tough fight. I dropped in on a Sunday evening and had around 15 mins of waiting. But the wait was aptly compensated by the sight of the beautiful wooden interiors and Darjeeling tea served in bordeaux glasses. A fresh waft of brewing tea hits you as soon as you enter the cafe. The staff is super friendly and help you in all the ways they can. Now coming to the food, the order was Darjeeling tea, stuffed chicken omlette and Chicken platter (chicken sausages and chicken salami). The tea was fragrant and perfect to my taste. The chicken platter was mouth watering. But the omlette tasted a bit bland. Lack of space can be a concern as it gets crammed on weekends. Otherwise thumbs up to Whistling Kettle !! It's a place worth trying.

They deserve a 5 star.

The moment you enter, you will feel like you have come to a quaint cafe in darjeeling. Very prim and proper, neat, hints of being old school and some retro feel. The decor and seating arrangement is very comfy. Not the kind where you would lounge on the seats and have a loud banter but where you will have your backs straight and enjoy a good conversation.

Their teas are a speciality and the way they serve it is different. No clear glass cups to see the how the tea leaves spread the colour when you dip your tea bag in the hot water. Instead you get your tea in dainty goblets and flutes, poured from a pot and then you are allowed to smell the tea leaves before you take your first sip.

Their food is good. Their portions are even better. You might find some of the items priced a little towards the higher side, but when the food arrives you will need help to finish it off.

Their pork platter is true love. 

Service too is very cordial. Overall it is a good addition to the cafe scenerio in all Kolkata.

DEFINITELY worth a visit. The plus is that they even have live music in the evenings.

PS : Their chicken salami sandwich is a great steal for 120. And do not order the Chicken Jumbo Sandwich for yourself only. Irrespective of how hungry you are, you just cannot finish it yourself.

I went to the Whistling Kettle to try their tea, since the selection in the menu seemed interesting. I had two different types of black Darjeeling tea, both fantastic. They also offer some varieties of yellow and white tea for a reasonable price.
The music was very pleasant too, the repertoire drawing mostly from soft rock evergreens. This is a nice break from the obnoxious pop and disco music played way too loudly in a lot of other cafes!
Tea selection and music definitely deserve a 4.

Another nice thing is the fact that they sell beautiful teapots and other tea related material at the entrance.

Unfortunately, the food didn't meet my expectations. I had a pasta all'arrabbiata which was overcooked and garnished with vegetables which do not belong in the recipe of the spaghetti all'arrabbiata. 

I am definitely eager to come back to this place and have more tea, but I would not recommend it for the food.

Very pretty, and cordial behaviour. The food is quite yummy and comes in good quantity. Do order the mango ice tea...it's really refreshing. And any pork lovers out there should have the pork platter, the bacon is on point. The chicken grilled sandwiches were great too. For deserts we had lemon tart and  madalieline cookies...which were surprisingly good. 

Best part was, the guy...serving Rwitika, Puja and me was my junior and he was fantastic in his job. Should have asked his name though.

Overall...it was one of my best Sunday brunches. Do drop by.

It was a rainy day and I was dying to have a cup of coffee. I was near golpark so, decided to try this cafe. This place is just opposite to the golpark CCD. It has got two sections. The first section is mainly a tea selling shop. The second section is the cafe. 
The cafe is neatly decorated. They also have a small section for jamming. It's congested, but considering the given space, it's utilized properly. Now, having read the reviews about the food that's served, I decided not to take a risk of trying them out. 
I decided on having Nathmulls exotic tea. Also, I heard a lot about the Vietnamese coffee, I ordered that. Alongside, I went for the marble cake slice and a lemon tart to complete my order.
The lemon tart was pretty small. But it tasted really good. It has that tinge of lemon and the right amount of sweetness to qualify as a tart. The crust was soft and perfectly baked. However, the winner was the marble cake. I absolutely loved it's taste.
The tea came in a wine glass. They also let you smell the tea leaves after brewing. I decided not to add any sugar cube as the tea itself was so refreshing. I really did get the Darjeeling feel after one sip of it. The Vietnamese coffee was served in an extraordinary manner. Thick layer of condensed milk and the coffee is left to filter slowly, and forms the upper layer. It takes around ten minutes. The staff will come and mix the two ingredients and pour the mixture in a glass and serve you coffee on the rocks. I absolutely loved the coffee. It's not bitter, totally qualifies as a cold coffee and has got a fresh coffee flavour. 
The staffs were very welcoming and courteous. If you're planning to visit this place, do try their Vietnamese coffee and the marble cake.

Good ambiance. The American corn sandwiches were good but the Margherita pizza we tried wasn't up to par. The basil would've added to the taste had it been fresh or lightly baked, but it was practically charred and wasn't very appetizing coupled with the dearth of cheese. The sausages were undercooked and didn't have much flavour. The tea would be the highlight. The quantity is decent, but the price doesn't match up to the quality. Also there was a problem with the debit card, which isn't a very nice situation to be in.

There are few things in our lives to which we love to cling on to! Even if that entity disowns you, you can‚Äôt probably let go the fond memories and you keep on making honest efforts to go back for that old magic. One such entity is probably Darjeeling, at least for the Bengalis this has to be true. And with the present political issues, it seems the distance is going on increasing between Kolkata and Darjeeling!! But there is a little glimmer of hope still left for the foodies like us (at least), who used to go there for the Keventers meat platter or that awesome Nathmulls Tea. Few months back an amazing caf√©-cum-store opened up in my city called ‚ÄòThe Whistling Kettle‚Äô at Golpark (near the CCD), by Mr. Sailesh Sarda. He is the fourth generation owner of Nathmulls, at Darjeeling. Lately I was invited to this place for a tasting session and I met Mr.Sarda in person, which was such an awesome experience in itself. He is so informative, enthusiastic and warm and makes you feel comfortable in a jiffy, which I absolutely loved. The place overall is pretty cozy, homely and adorable. We were seated at the farthest and probably the coziest wooden section having a lovely wooden ceiling. The place has loads of neatly framed black & white photographs of Darjeeling which helps you remember those pleasant stays and unforgettable moments in the hills.  The overall ambiance is very cozy, warm with nice optimally spaced out seating arrangements. There is an area on your left for the live performances where you will find a guitar standing alone waiting for his masters to come in. But anyway, even if you don‚Äôt get to see a live performance you will definitely enjoy the classy collection of western music that gets played here all the time.

Craving for tea and light snacks led us to this place.  The owners and the staffs welcomed us with warmth and smiling faces. We tried their much recommended chicken jumbo sandwich and Nutella pancake. Along with Darjeeling tea we tried marble cake from their own bakery. Sandwich was huge in quantity and stuffed with chicken and cheese. Though I had better pancakes than theirs; marble cake was pure love. It was the best I had ever had. The bill also didn't hurt our pocket. We will definitely come back to this place to try their pork and bacon specialities.

The decor here is really nice. We ordered pepperoni pizza, Nutella pancakes, and one of pork special platter. The pizza was too good, like REALLY good. The pancakes hardly had any Nutella in it, even if it was Nutella pancakes. And the platter was also okayish. 
To sum it up, a visit here will dig quite a big hole in your pockets and that might not be worth your experience.

I have been hearing rave reviews about this place for a while and decided to get some food packed. I had too.much expectations I guess since I am just back from Darjeeling's famous and almost cult like Keventers. They menu resembles and is more fancy I suppose. I ordered a full on pork platter and a spaghetti Bolognese. The pork platter though was good, it was also a bit too greasy. The spaghetti Bolognese was a disappointment. It's one of my favorite dishes and I couldn't eat more than three spoons. It was that spicy. A little improvement required may be.

In a rainy afternoon and after a hectic shopping schedule visited this place with a friend. They welcomed us beautifully. Loved their decorations. Minimalistic, simple yet elegant. We had nathmull speciality and a pork platter. The fragrance and taste of the tea was classy. Coming to the platter, the bacon was bit over cooked and a bit salty. But the quantity was enough for 2 persons. 
Later I had some trouble with the card payment. But they behaved so nicely and they were so humble that I want to visit this place again. And want to experience some good music next time.

There was a time when the city was known for it's restaurants and biriyani, but with each passing week, the city is taking it's cafe game quite seriously. One more name to the list is, The Whistling Kettle. Located in a prime location that is Golpark, this place by far is one of my recent favourites in town. To step up in the game, they serve something different as compared to other cafes, the Vietnamese coffee. Have always been a fan of it ever since i tried it in south east Asia, and I'm glad it's here now. Talking of their food, the place is especially famous for their breakfast items and tea choices. While the choice of cutlery being served in is quite nice, what deserves special mention is their decor. The lighting and the comfortable couches definitely lets you absorb the cafe culture. Pizza and tarts were good though the pizza seemed a bit dry. Sausages and eggs were cooked to satisfaction but nothing extra ordinary. Chocolate shake too was tasty. The place however left me disheartened when it came to their service. The wait to get be it a glass of water or the desserts, seemed like forever. They should definitely work on improving that. Otherwise, the place is a must visit.

Ambience and staff:the decor and staffs are real welcoming and the music is too soothing..we went on Monday Evening and they had their live music from 7:30..a guy came up with good music and and that perfectly set up the mood
Food:we ordered something in white sauce pasta that had chkn and eggs,though it was perfectly a cheesy affairs but it's presentation could have been better.
The chocolate shake had the perfect flavors that made the taste buds happier while the cold coffee was no less good.the chkn sausage sandwich was good but it's stuffing could have been a bit more as it was priced.
All over a good experience but it gives a real hard punch in ur pockets.
Would love to come here again to try the

I've been two times over here. The first time I had nathmulls exotic black tea, pork ham sandwich (non-grilled) and lemon tart.
Nathmulls tea is famous, so you can never go wrong with it,tea-lovers like me will understand. The pork ham sandwich was ok,it wasn't great but tasted good. Quantity is too less I feel for the price at which it is being offered. Now coming to the tart, I've one word on it- horrible. I love lemon tarts from kookie jar and cakes and this was far from them.
On my second visit, I repeated the tea and we had chicken supremo pizza which is actually a very good pizza,sliced perfectly so that u needn't pull them apart. No complaints regarding the size,they give a decent eight slices.
Regarding my low marking I have an experience to share- I don't like writing anything negative about any place,but on my first visit they indirectly told me to leave,citing that there were customers waiting. Now I had just been served dessert and still hadn't touched it even, which I rightly pointed out. Though they apologised to me when I was leaving, I can't still believe a place could actually ask their customer of such. I had no such experience on my second visit.
Go if you are a tea-lover. That's all I would say.

Already quite popular a tea boutique cum cafe near golpark ccd , striking the right emotional chords with bengali customers  by merging the nathmulls original tea stocks with the keventer's specialities - the all day english breakfasts and meat platters . The entrance is small , leads to a white washed store stocked with variants of tea sourced from Nathmull tea and some amazing tea pots and decorative crockeries , next to which is the cafe room for dining. The space though not huge offers cozy seating and dimly lit by beautifully crafted hanging lanterns which draws all the attention in the first glace , a part of the floor is demarkated to make a stage which shows live music on scheduled slots beside which is a bakery display presenting all savouries to desserts of the day.
I had to try a cup of NATHMULL EXOTIC , my friend had VIETNAMESE COFFEE which had an unusual way of serving , the strained black coffee was poured in a beaker with condensed milk , mixed and transferred to a glass full of ice cubes , the entire thing happened on our table. The coffee tasted nice , closely resembling a cold coffee . The PORK PLATTER had sauasages , bacon , salami , ham with two sunny side  ups. The bacon was extremely salty and sausages had a weird smell , may be from an older stock hence a thumbs down . It wasn't even a week i had been to keventers darjeeling and this platter was no where close to the kind they serve , they sell their products at siliguri as well from where i got few packets of sausages and meatloafs , tried here but the products were'nt the ones served at the whistling kettle. I am not sure if they source them from keventer's or process themselves but anything that smells bad shouldn't be served. We were in a hurry and left without complaining.

We happen to drop into this place as we were hungry and it was the biggest mistake ever since. Ambience is too good. The moment we entered the cafe we were greeted very politely. But ordering the food here was a grave mistake. We ordered for two strawberry milkshakes and one mango shake. But when we received the order and took a sip we realised that it was strawberry and mango watershake. They quality of them was pathetic. It was a 3:1 ratio of water to milk. Even though after complaining they changed the drink but still it was pathetic. Guys stay out of this place if u r damm hungry, instead head to the nearest CCD and get a value for money.

A quaint little cafe with pretty interiors, its sure to make you happy at the first look.
Situated in Golpark, its very easy to locate too.
Order- we ordered the chicken omelette, non veg lasagna and nutella pancakes
Food- omelette was okayish, nothing out of the world.
The lasagna was good but I've had better. And at a lesser cost.
Pancakes- It's hard to go wrong when there's nutella but I expected a more generous serving of the nutella over the pancakes!
Pocket pinch-- 1300 INR for two.
Overall--A bit overpriced according to me, but full points for the ambience and the friendly staff!

I keep stumbling upon such pretty places and this is surely on of them. The Whistling kettle is really famous for its huge variety of tea and delectable meat all the way from Darjeeling. The decor is beautiful, has a stage for live music and also sell various accessories, namely gorgeous kettles. 
We ordered the cold coffee with ice cream and the mango shake. They tasted good indeed. 
Then we ordered the pork platter which constituted of pork sausages, bacon, salami and fried egg. This is a sumptuous platter and leaves you craving for more. The meat tastes really good. Also we got the al prosciutto pizza which was a treat. Loaded with sumptuous amount of ice, this was exactly what we needed. The butter toast has generous amount of butter. 
The service was quick and the waiters were extremely cordial. Do give a try for a good conversation with some tea and protein from the choicest of the lot.

In hindi there is a saying "Jo dikhta hai, uoh bikta hai" .... and the management here seems to believe in this philosophy. I've just been to this place once and has only 3 items, hence, my review would be a bit small. Theiy, thankfully, serve a nice "Milk Coffee" instead of those fancy cappuccinos and taste-wise also, it's good. The pork-cheese stuffed omlette was stuffed with loads of ham and less cheese... while taste-wise it's good, at that price range, I don't think one or two slices of toast (complementary) would've hurt the pricing much.¬†

But, innovation is elsewhere. A good, creamy cold coffee (made with cream and not milk) is presented in a strange way, so that it looks something different and interesting. The brew is given on top of a glass andwhile it's done, waiter will come and mix the hell out of it and pour it into a glass full of ice cubes. Taste-wise it's just awesome, but quantity-wise not at the price range. But, overall recommended.¬†

Decor is superb and service is good. Overall a good joint. All the best .....

The food and tea are very good but the service is horribly slow. It took us 25 minutes to get a cup of tea and then we were told tea takes time! On another occasion also when we went it took almost half an hour for the order to come. If the quality of service improves its a great place.

Had been here for a quick lunch. This is a probably a new cafe with trendy guitars and musical instruments arranged for live performances. 
Coming to food, the menu is mostly Italian and Breakfast items like baked beans,omelettes,sausages. I was really hungry and wanted to have something really filling, and ordered for a plain Pork salami s/w. 
The order was served in 10minutes and to my surprise the sandwich was the tiniest al'a carte s/w that I had ever seen. Also no plate presentation, no accompaniments, only for a bottle of ketchup by the side. It seemed that the s/w was picked up from a buffet counter and just served like that. 
I had eaten s/w at many places, even the smallest and cheapest of cafes in and around the place serves at least a good quantity, or at least a standard accompaniment -ff/wafers. But it was not something I was expecting from a good decorated cafe like this in the heart of Golpark. I felt like ordering more and was thinking of a Spagetti Bolognaise but was afraid enough if the same would be value for money. The pastas were almost INR 400+ and taxes extra. Also extras was  vegetable-50, extra cheese-50, hope they dont charge for extra salt and pepper as well. 

Menu designing is poor and prices is very overrated. I had to move out of this place to Aminia nearby for a proper lunch.

Located at Golpark junction. Quite accessible. Tried their green and lemon tea. Tea was good and the service is prompt too. They have a good collection of tea. The decor is impressive too. And that's all that is good about the place. The sandwiches are reasonably priced however to get a grilled sandwich you have to Shell out 30 bucks more which is not reasonable. The pastas are unreasonably priced. They charge around 350-400 plus taxes for pastas. Even 5star hotels in the city charge around 450-500. Omelette or other egg preparations are not served with any toasts. To get a toast you need to again pay an additional 30 bucks. Overall the place can be recommended for their collection of tea and nothing more. The management should re-look at the prices and the menu again.

Nice Ambiance... Nathmull Tea varieties are a must try.. we tried the lemon tea and Nathmull green premium and they were refreshing...Service and hospitality is really good.. food menu is not properly designed specially on English breakfast items ,e.g: omelettes should at least be served with bread toasts ...you can consider my rating for value for money .. the pricing definitely needs to be revised for Italian items... over all good place to spend an afternoon on the love couches..

I will write this review to help make up your mind about visiting this place.

Go if
1.You are a tea lover or even better,a tea connoisseur.They have a few selections,but you must be able to appreciate the distinction.Otherwise it can feel like money drown the drain.
2.If you are going with family or workplace friends or friends you regularly meet or in some other scenario where you don't have a lot to talk about/catch up on. They play loud music and there are live gigs.The performer likes interacting with the people,appreciates song requests and of course,a good portion of your attention.
3. If you don't mind crammed table spaces or waiting outside for sometime .The tables are usually occupied.
4.You are okay with pretty normal food.The al fungi pizza was not better than dominos thin crust pizza.I have had better pancakes.The coffee on the rocks/Vietnamese coffee is served in an interesting way,but doesn't pique the same level of interest once it reaches your palates.Don't get me wrong, the food is good here.Just not avant garde.You could find better at the same pocket pinch.
5.You like a vibrant environment.The interior is small and interactive.It sets a tone.Not a serene Sistine Chapel affair like some other places.
6.You want to buy some nice tea later from the Nathmulls counter.I checked out a Rs 10k/kg tea and it was very aromatic.Yes,they open the jar to let you soak it in.
7.You miss Darjeeling especially,Keventers and want the English Breakfast no matter if the salami or pork is not always to your liking and not served all together in a plate,which I'd prefer just for the looks of it.However they serve the breakfast at all hours I hear.

Don't visit
If the above conditions don't suit you.

Despite being a small place the ambience was good for a soaking conversation over good food. We tried the chicken and pork platter (2 distinct dishes). The dish comes with sausages, fried eggs, salami and bacon. The sausages weren't great and seemed very similar to the ones that u will find at BigBazar or Spencer. The garlic bread, Vietnamese coffee and cheese sandwiches were very good. Most of the staff were polished and a delight to speak to. We were a group of 6 and hence needed a couple of tables. We were given one table and was promised a second one soon. But unfortunately a management staff allocated the second table to other waiting customers. We didn't like it as it was supposed to be allocated to us as pre-discussed. Considering this to be a trivial matter and mere dysfunctional communication, I'll recommend this place for a descent hangout.

This cute little caf√© is located among the hustle bustle of Gariahat Road, golpark. One of the best place for tea lovers in South kolkata. The tea shop sell variety of teas as well as designer little kettles, tea pots and other home decors. This beautiful caf√© offers a cosy ambience with wooden celling & furniture, soft lights and pleasant background music.
Coming to the food items I really loved their all day Breakfast platters . We ordered pork platter which had salami, ham, bacon, sausages and poached eggs...and for the drinks we ordered chocolate shake and mango shake. I loved all the food items....I'm waiting for my nxt visit to this place and As a tea lover I will love to taste their tea menu as they have a huge variety of it.

Golpark is fast emerging as an enviable alternative to the restro hubs of (hindusthan park,purna das road and southern avenue)..numerous joints serving lipsmacking delicacies have emerged in the recent past on the various lanes and bylanes of it..
THE WHISTLING KETTLE is a product of such a dramatic transformation..located in the lane adjacent to mouchak and just beside rg cellular this tea cafe is a haven for all those who love to visit the bong favourite destination for life ‚Äúdarjeeling‚Äù..from the tea to the keventer inspired menu to the decor to the old school music playing in the background u just cannot miss the vibe which is reminiscent of the golden era..just entering this place greets u to aladdin inspired tea  pots and kettles..also nathmulls which is famous for its tea gardens and fresh flush of tea is sourced directly from their gardens up north..coming to the food the all day english breakfast sourced from keventers might seem to be the highlight of the menu but it is not..u get good italian lasagna pastas pizzas and sumptuous shakes..also the tea menu is really the usp of this place..the ambience is cosy and though the space is limited i still enjoy being lifted to the hills owing the vibe surrounding the place..i had pork platter which consisted of egg fried,bacon,sausages,salamis and ham..it was so tasty and made me happy..followed it up by lasagna al ferno..again the cheesy crusted lasagna with shredded chicken inside did wonders to my tummy..finally ended my meal with brownie with icecream which was the house special that day..i didnot sip into their tea this time around but will definitely in my next visit..

This quaint little caf√© is truly a gem. You can never guess what is waiting for you once you step inside. The decor is extremely quirky and cute. A gift shop welcomes you and you will be taken aback by the beauty of these teapots. When you are done admiring the teapots, you can now step into the caf√©. The wooden ceiling, the live music set up, the pictures on the walls will definitely soothe your mind and will get you prepared for a joyride away from the hustle and bustle of the city from which you have stepped in. We didn't get the opportunity to enjoy live music but they were playing songs of Denver and at once the mood was set!

Moving on to the food, we were the very first customers there because we were actually looking for a place to have breakfast as early as 9:30am and we couldn't be happier with Zomato's suggestion of this place. We ordered the pork platter which consisted of Pork sausage bacon ham salami and egg fried. The bacon was a bit rubbery otherwise all the rest were simply too good! We also ordered chocolate milk shake and mango milk shake. The mango milk shake was okayish and the chocolate milk shake was... Umm.. Let's say too deliciously chocolaty!

The staffs were all friendly especially the guy who sits at the gift store counter. The only drawback I felt is that the place lacks a bit in privacy, maybe that was the case for us because we chose the first table to sit at and also we were the only diners then. However, the ambience as well as the food is sure to win your heart!

Went here last evening with my partner. I really liked the d√©cor and the ambience. Loved the fact that there was live music where the performers were also taking request. There was one point when everyone in the caf√© broke into 'Purano shei din'er kotha', it was beautiful.
Now, coming to the food :
We made the huge mistake of ordering the bacon and eggs platter. The bacon was burnt and EXTREMELY SALTY. I just had to gulp it down somehow as we had spent 200 rupees on it.
The other items were quite good though. We had ordered a mushroom grilled sandwich which tasted pretty good,the crunchy grilled bread perfectly complementing the soft saut√©ed mushrooms.
We had also ordered corn on toast. We loved the cheesy corn topping, it was melt in the mouth,perfectly creamy.
For dessert we had nutella pancakes. The pancakes were really fluffy and they were quite generous with the nutella.
May go back to this place but never having bacon here again.

With cozy interiors and a great ambience , The Whistling Kettle , attracts a lot of customers. The tea shop has a variety of teas to sell as well as tea pots , tea cups , and other accessories. They have freshly brewed tea of all kinds , prepared in the most authentic manner , all the way from the Nathmull tea gardens in Darjeeling. 
We had the Mango shake and the cold coffee which tasted okay. We had the al prosciutto pizza which had a generous amount of cheese in it and tasted well. The pork and chicken platters are a must try here. The pork platter consisted of pork sausages , bacon  , salami and fried eggs. Everything in the platter tasted good , owing to its origin which lies in the famous caf√© in Darjeeling , Kaventers. With that we had toast which had been drowned in butter. The staff was friendly and cooperative and the bill was easy on the pocket. It is a must try for all tea lovers.

I highly recommend this place to everyone. Its a paradise for tea lovers. There all day breakfast is simply perfect. The cakes and muffins are not that up to the mark but the personal favourite will be the filter cold coffee that they serve. The essence of the place lies in the fact is that you can actually smell the different types of tea on display and order for the ones you liked. If you love its taste, you can buy some for your morning tea at home. Customer service os at its best.

So I was there because of my bestfriend. He is a huge fan of exotic teas. This cafe is newly opened near golpark. So we went there and We ordered two types of sandwiches and spinach ravioli and herbal mint tea. The food was ok. I loved the thing that they served the tea in a wine glass.

Amazing! Yes, that's what this place is. My bff took me out for a supper date on my b'day and I had the most wonderful time ever. I am not a tea- connoisseur but being here I wanted to try a steaming cup. Had the nathmulls exotic pot for two and it was really soothing to the palate and strangely it went well with the delicious pepperoni pizza. My friend enjoyed the luscious pork platter and we both were in food heaven when two young boys came in to treat the diners with John Denver, Bob Dylan numbers. They even sang me a birthday song at the request of my friend. Everything about the place smells of happiness. I am so in love with this place!

A great place to hang out just behind Mouchak (Golapark) without making a hole in the pocket.¬†
We thought of going light on that day and ordered Sandwiches, tea and mango shake. Very fast services by the folks. There is a small shop while you enter the cafe. There is even provision for live music.¬†
We ordered veg sandwich and american corn sandwich. I must say that even those are common place sandwiches yet they tasted great.
I am bit disappointed with the mango shake and hence the 3.5 rating. It seemed a normal milk shake with a distant taste of mango lost somewhere.¬†
A recommendation..they can serve the fruit shakes as per the seasons with the real fruit

When Keventers and Nathmulls decided to bring a bit of the Darjeeling magic to Kolkata, what happened?
The Whistling Kettle!

The decor of this quaint little cafe, just beside Mouchak is as innovative as it's name! With provisions for live music and vintage photos of toy trains and darjeeling adorning the wall, TWK is the perfect place for hanging out for people who can never get over the nostalgia of Darjeeling. Provided you don't have a kitty party group laughing too loudly, you can enjoy he ambiance to the utmost over Nathmulls' special tea variants, or the Keventers special breakfast pork platter. Other recommendations will be the Cheese Bacon Omlette, and the Marble Cake! We also ordered Pizza and Milkshakes, as well as another plate of Pork Fried Bacon (because one can never have enough of bacon, right) but the other two stole the show! The Apple Pie, if warmed, is also a good steal.

The price is on the higher side, and the options are limited to mostly snacks and tit-bits, but the place runs on a Bengali's love for Darjeeling more than the food. So, if you're yet to visit the place, you need to rush soon! 

P.S. They have a collection of pottery items up for sale, and if it were in my capacity, I would loved to purchase each and every one of those cute little things!

Being a tea lover, this place has a special place in my heart. I am a " anytime tea-time" person. And The Whistling kettle is not too far from my house. Conveniently located near Golpark, it has well decorated ambience, dim bamboo lamp shades, tea posters , and a live performance area.  The whistling kettle has become my favorite place off late.

Being in the clamorous Calcutta streets, if you want to experience the feel and flavours of the hilly Darjeeling, then THE WHISTLING KETTLE is your destination.üòçüòç

One of its owners being the Nuthmulls--the well known Darjeeling tea company, the cafeteria serves you a cup of Darjeeling in the Kolkata lane. Following the trend this cafeteria too is small and cozy with quite comfortable sitting arrangements which along with chairs also include sofas. The decor of the place is quite soothing with dim lights and low volumed music all alongüòç. They also have a segment for live performances by the artists. The walls of the place are filled with pretty framed photos and witty write-ups üòçüòç. Entering the cafe you will also witness beautiful tea-pots and other crockeries for sale.üòç

Coming to the food, they will cater you with three large (really largeüòú) menu cards and somewhere in it you might get a resemblance of both keventers (Darjeeling) and our very own flurysüòç. We had butter toast, cheese omlet, chicken stuffed omlet, lasagne al ferno, chicken salami sandwich along with nutmulls hot lemon tea and exotic black tea and cold coffee. Both the omlets were equally good and yes they indulged with a good amount of both cheese and chicken in the omletsüòú. Talking about the sandwich, it was quite good and the stuffings tasted a little different from other sandwich jointsüòç. Finally the lasagne was delicious and is a complete belly-filler, infact it is quite difficult for a single person to devour it all alone!!üòÄ
Coming to the drinks, the Nutmulls never disappoints us and here too both the tea tasted absolutely superb. The exotic black tea was actually the show stopper!üòç One interesting feature of this cafe is that the tea is served in modish and sassy glasses!!üòç The cold coffee was good and is quite the same in taste as we find in other cafeteriasü§ì. Here they also provide you with a showcase full of cakes, tarts and other confectionary!!üòç One can also go by the 'today's special' choice of dishes of the particular day.ü§ìü§ì
Comparing to the contemporary cafeterias in town the prices are quite fair.

Mention must be made of the staffs and the crews who were very cordial polite and pleasant with a grin always glued to their face ü§ì. Pretty amusing was the way bill was served-- in a small beautifull basket (miniature form of those baskets taken at the back and used to keep the plucked tea leaves in the hills by the women). üòçüòç

Another enthralling section of the cafe was it's bathroomüòÜüòÜ where you'll find some chucklesom write-upsüòõüòõ.

Suming up all these it was a good experience enjoying a piece of Darjeeling in Kolkata and if you are a hard-core tea and meat lover then boy, you must never miss The Whistling Kettle.üòçüòçüòç

This is the new addition to the list of beautiful little cafes that are opening up every other month on the ever-expanding food landscape of our city. The cafe has been opened by the renowned Nathmull's, a well-known name among the tea-estates of our state. The cafe is quite spacious and contrary to most cafes with barely any space to fit in. But here you would find cozy sofas and chairs, warm lighting, walls adorned with framed pictures of toy trains and hills giving u the feels of Darjeeling. And then they have this space where u would find posters of Beatles, Bob Marley and a Marilyn Monroe as well along‚Äã with all sorts of musical instruments present for the bands that usually come there in the evening to play. Though we didn't get to listen to any band or musicians but had a good chat as I was meeting my school friends after quite a while. And Ice tea and a meat platter consisting of sausages, meat loaf and poached eggs. We didn't order much but the items we had were nice. I liked the iced tea. That's all. Might have to come back to taste the other items but I have this feeling that one should come here for the ambience, to have a nice chat with one's close ones, to get inside a world so different‚Äã from the one just outside the threshold of the cafe.

Located at Golpark, just a few paces ahead of R. G. Cellular just where Archies used to be earlier. They have revamped the place and turned it into a two phased outlet. While the first phase serves as a retail outlet for people who want to purchase the very famous Nathmulls Tea fresh from Darjeeling, the second phase is the eatery located inside. The interiors have been done up beautifully with some wonderful matting and furniture with monochromatic pictures of the hills from a bygone era replacing wall paintings. Most pictures will invoke curiosity for some and nostalgia for others.
The ever present staff are very very well mannered and are very prompt with service.
We had heard a lot about this cafe cum restaurant so we decided to drop in one sunday evening. It was fully packed and we had to wait our turn. This place is a must visit for every tea connoisseur out there. We decided to try out the Nathmulls Exotic tea and teamed it up with Pork Bacon & Egg Fried Sandwiches.
The robust aroma of the first flush Darjeeling tea filled the air when it was poured into our glasses. The interesting thing we noticed here was that tea was being poured into wine glasses as against the traditional cup and saucer. A move out of the ordinary and wow!
The sandwich was perfect though they could've been a bit generous with the stuffing. The bacon was quite juicy and smokey and it teamed well with the egg turning it into a very hearty meal.
Every bong holds Darjeeling very dear to his/her heart and visiting this place will transfer a bit of you to that very place which has also become the National Durga Pujo destination for most of us.
Also do keep a watch on the daily specials which we had missed out on. Oh well till next time then!

Lovely restaurant, perfect selection, helpful and friendly staff! Best place for English Breakfast in Kolkata! 
However parking can be a little tricky.

The Whistling Kettle is a very pretty cafe located so near the main crossing of Golpark that you will be surprised how secluded and tucked away it feels. Coupled with the incessant rains on the day of our visit, the ambiance is what you pay for.¬†¬†

The food left me a little cold, though. While the Al Prosciutto do Parma, a rather sumptuous pizza topped with plenty of cheese and parma ham, was tasty in its own right, it felt kind of overstuffed with a lot of flavor clashing. The Canelloni Grande was adequately cheesy and stuffed with well cooked spinach while the Nathmul's exotic white tea was, let's just say, not my cup of tea.¬†

I blame my choices more than the restaurant for the lukewarm experience I had here. That however is only an added incentive to visit this place one more time soon enough and try out their signature meat platters.

A cozy cafe that serves breakfast throughout the day is located in the lane next to Golpark Mouchak, opposite to CCD. Though it was bit tough for me to trace this place.

Went there for light lunch during late afternoon and most of the seats were occupied. Tried their pork platter served with poached egg, sunny side up on a wooden lavish tray which was quiet heavy for 1 person and the thick creamy Keventers shake, tasted very yummy. Tried their signature beverage - ¬†Vietnamese Coffee - milk coffee with sugar, on the rocks which was okish. Ordered their house special chicken jumbo club sandwich for a take away which tasted much better than the breakfast pork platter.

Coming to the ambience, the place looks bit smaller from the outside. On entering they have a gift shop with wide range of boutique kettles in display, designer mugs, tea leaves. Kettles are the best for gift purposes and i received lot of appreciations for the same. The shop lands to the spacious eatery area with a performance stage with a guitar stacked at one corner and a small pastry counter inside. The wooden furnitures and dim yellow lights adds up a classy ambience to the whole atmosphere. Love the green vinyl wall paper of the tea garden on one side of the wall..

The staffs were very friendly and helpful. The food is good with reasonable rates and is a great place for hangout with friends.

Though i am not a tea lover, but this is a perfect place for the tea drinkers to try out their wide variety of beverages.

This new cafe on the block is located in the lane next to Golpark Mouchak. It looks rather small from the outside, but is actually quite spacious. The interiors have a Keventers (Darjeeling) kind of a feel.There is a permanent stage where regular performances are held. 
We went for morning breakfast and tried their chicken ham sandwiches and chicken sausage. Both chicken ham and sausages tasted like the frozen ones you get in any good grocery store. There are six sausages in a plate, something we had forgotten to ask and ended up with too much. They have a wide selection of tea, which is served in wine goblets of different sizes. However we tried their coffee which is available in two varieties- black, or with milk. We finished the meal with one of their nutella pancakes, which was served fresh from the pan. Their pancakes are of the thicker variety, and not the paper thin ones you usually get. We left the place feeling rather full. The staff are courteous and helpful. The food is not great, but all in all this is a great place for a little chit chat with friends.

Amidst the hustle and bustle of Gariahat, located in one of the bylanes of Golpark beside Mouchak lies The Whistling Kettle as a gentle reminder of the beloved Darjeeling.
The ambience is beautiful and the prices are fair.
Coming to the food I was personally a little disappointed.
We had ordered Chicken Salami, Sausage and Eggs and a Chicken Salami Sandwich. Only the sandwiches seemed to have any flavour, while the other two were pretty bland and boring.

Been there and ordered few things from here. The food was not bad , liked the chocolate shake although the rest was mediocre. The only thing that disappointed us was the behavior of the staff. They clearly mentioned that they provide WiFi , but when my friend asked for the WiFi , one lady clearly signaled the staff not to do so. If they didn't want to provide they shouldn't have mentioned on their zomato page.

This place is nice for avid tea lovers.Different tea flavors you can get from this place.Variety of tea flavors is really awesome.The food here is affordable and good. The ambience is nice with a different yellow shade lighting.A tea place for to hangout. But the most important is the servicing should be much faster.Otherwise,it's a food tea cafe of southern Kolkata.

Refreshing new look and idea of cafe cum restaurant. Place is not much big but well utilised. The entrance is through a tea leaves shop. They have all kinds of tea leaves for tea lovers.
Now coming to food. They don't have anything unique except the meat platter. We have ordered white tea, cold coffee, lasagna and chicken platter. Frankly speaking we were not able to identify any difference between normal tea and white tea though. Cold coffee was a big disappointment. Chicken platter was so so. 
The serving time was too high compared to the crowd.

Visited a week or two ago, the place is located near Mouchak Sweet shop near Golpark. The ambience is superb. The owners were extremely cordial and a lovely host. The decor is out of the box. A must visit and highly recommended place. The baked fish was incredible as suggested by the owner. Truly enjoyed the visit.

The restaurant is situated in the lane beside the mouchak sweets shop at golpark. 
Very well decorated, it has interesting background music.
We had bacon,cheese and egg sandwich along with chicken sausage and egg poach.
With respect to price, the food is good.
They have smoothies and shakes.
They also provide with a beautiful dessert counter inside.
Will definitely visit again to try their exotic tea menu !

Ok. I'm in LOVE with this place, period.

I'm just surprised it took us so long to tick this place off the bucket-list. It almost felt like walking into TARDIS today, as the quaint glass door entrance opened up to a corridor of silent kettles and then a spacious eating zone with a guitar to the left! With enough space between the tables for the (apparently) under staffed, yet highly efficient team to run around with your orders, which reach the table pretty quick even with a full house. The sober decor and the ambiance music with the perfect volume invites you for AN EXPERIENCE WORTH ABSORBING. We had tried:

1.  Chicken Jumbo Sandwich (House Special) - 4‚≠êÔ∏è
[ITS HUGE! We would have preferred a little more varied taste out of it though; probably some potato wafers to go with it. But, a belly-filler, hands down]

2. Bacon and Sunny Side Up - 5‚≠êÔ∏è
[Ok, this set the standards. The egg was two, not one, and its not mentioned in the menu, so that was a pleasant surprise. And then the bacon...just hit the spot. Not too burnt, neither too raw, perfectly cooked, and without being scalding salty. A delight to recall the first bite even while I'm traveling back home now.]

3. Vietnamese Coffee - 3.5‚≠êÔ∏è
[So, it was milk coffee with sugar, on the rocks. My bad, should have asked for the specifications before ordering it. Well made, but I'm a no milk no sugar dark to the core espresso drinker.]

If you're a tea drinker, I've been told this is the place. If you're a bacon lover, I'm telling you, this is the place. And all this topped with a smiling team; their smiling faces almost makes you feel that they are happy to see you there. They are professional, yet still not being a a bunch of order-noting robots.

A rock solid 5‚≠êÔ∏è for The Whistling Kettle (and a few whistles for the kettles they have on display). A DEFINITE REPEAT VISIT place.

It's a cozy cafe situated at the heart of golpark. Bonus, it's near my office. Ordered a plate of bacon sausages and fried eggs with buttered toast along with cold coffee and a mango iced tea. The iced tea was brilliant, was looking for something that was so beautiful to the taste buds. Amazing food. The best bacon i had in ages. The cold coffee was spectacular and lastly the brownie. We were so full that we couldn't finish it, even though it was delicious. The people of the cafe were really amicable and helped us with choosing the Mango Iced Tea. I would just keep going back for it. Million thumbs up to the people working there. You are doing an amazing job. Loved the ambience and the songs that played. I hope to be back soon when I'm back in the city. Amazing place.

Small place. Seems like Darjeeling indeed with the authentic meat platter. Tea is served in white wine glasses but in large enough quantities. Lemon Tart has the right tanginess and sourness and may be at a level of competition with those of the bakery, Cakes. The chocolate shake is good too. The service is a little slow nevertheless pleasant, especially because of the one sweet girl who always greets with a smile and is ever enthusiastic about her work.

Another evening stroll around the gariahat side led me to the craving of visiting this place. Even though google indicated its location on the side lines o mouchak, it did undergo a bit of struggle on my part to arrive. Nevertheless the jackpot was hit.

A small shop on the outlook with a feeling that it is an exquisite tea leaf selling shop. Although a few tiptoes inside was like an Alibaba cave. 

A perfect sit and hangout cafe with mellow and soothing light conditions. Artworks resembling the touch of western classic rock on the walls. Music played was soothing and the seats were cosy. 

Continental food was something which actually fetched me here. The owner Debashish was quite a pleasant and graceful guy hailing from Darjeeling.

I ordered a penne with chicken shred with olives on top, a spicy omletter and nathmulls hot lemon tea. Overall the combination supported each other .penne was on the lines of pasta with blended sauce. Lemon tea was again pretty well filtered.

Overall a good place to try price though I felt was a bit on the higher side with what its associate cafes provide. Serving time was decent. Keep a look out for 18% gst applied. Lack of originality in the menus. But for people who wish to try and haven't tried such typos, they would surely love it.

The whistling kettle is whistling to a lot of foodie enthusiasts these days . Such is the hype that you will see it's name in the Zomato " trending places " list for quite a few weeks now . And finally after days of planning I managed to pay a visit . Golpark is the latest hotspot now with so many restaurants stamping their feet here . The only requirement was of a good cafe . The Whistling Cafe clearly intends to fill the gap with honest intentions . And they must have done quite a good job to grab the attention of many . But I feel that from the perspective of food , the cafe has to do a bit more .

So my current review for this joint will be based solely on the food that was served and not for the beverages .

¬∞ Location :- The whistling kettle is located on the lane of mouchak ( Golpark ) . You just have to reach the point and enter the lane . The cafe is very close within a short walking distance .

¬∞ Ambience & Service ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- The entrance of the cafe is a little shop where you get to see a wide variety of tea leaves and other beverages . As you move in you will be guided to a small yet neat interior surroundings . Decked by a yellowish dim light and packaged with wooden tables this place is comfy on the eye . There is a tiny podium in the front where they say a musician comes to play but only on Monday evenings . The staff is still learning but very professional and eager to serve . Service time was close to 10 minutes but everything was okayish . Not much flaws in.this department .

----------------------------------------

¬∞ FOOD :-  When I first looked at their menu I saw a lack or originality . The meat platters were the only different thing that they are serving other than conventional ones like pizza , pasta and sandwiches . But that is not a big thing if the quality is really good . But is it ? 


1. Pork sausage bacon ham and egg fried ( 2.5 / 5 ) :- Heard so much about their pork platter but this is really uninspiring and dissapointing . Firstly pork sausages were a disaster . Tasted synthetic and bland . Those were the worst sausages I tried for quite some time. It's time they improve upon the selection of sausages . Fried bacon were good although a tad too salty . But crispy and good . The ham slices were another pathetic item served . I just found them bland . Maybe the food served is a bit light for breakfast purposes. Or I don't know the reason but the platter was not worth my taste , time and money . A big disappointment 

2. Lasagna Al ferno ( 4 / 5 ) :- Thankfully the lasagna was great. We ordered the one with minced lamb and it was certainly the best dish of the visit . The lasagna was topped with a lot of cheese and beneath that there were layers of flat pasta . And withing the layers of pasta was finely cooked minced lamb meat . It was yummy and we loved it . Although a bit on the pricey side , this lasagna is the thing to have if you are in this cafe .

3. Pork stuffed omelette ( 2 / 5 ) :.- A culinary disaster . Had high hopes with this but it was totally not worth the try. They had simply sliced the ham that was served in the pork platter into tiny bits and put inside the omelette . And that's it . It was plain and bland and I had to put a lot of pepper to consume it . For 170 rupees price tag , I would have been a little bit satisfied if they had put a single slice of cheese in it . But it was awful and I had a hard time consuming the omelette .

4. Honey pancakes ( 3 / 5 ) :- A decent and basic pancake dish .2 pancakes were served hot with honey on top . The pancakes were fat and sweet and okayish . We just ordered it because we needed a heavy dessert . 

5. kiwi shake ( 4 / 5 ) :- Loved the thick milkshake with kiwi flavor . It had a mild essence of kiwi and the sweetness was perfect for my appetite . Good beverage to accompany your meal .

---------------------------------------------


¬∞ VERDICT :- Well considering the price tag the food is simply not worth it at all . Except for the lasagna everything else was just okayish , the meat dishes though were a disaster .The beverage was good though . I will certainly be back.for the tea because this time i had nose blockage due to a slight fever  . So definitely I will visit the cafe again but not for the food .People are talking a lot about their pork platter whereas it is certainly not worth it . Infact I don't think their meat dishes are in that level to be trending that much . But obviously there is a lot of room for improvement . My best wishes for the team .

The place is decorated in a great way with lots of pictures from Darjeeling. Also had ordered a cold coffee which was way strong for my taste. Decent place , great location and ambiance.

I visited this place today after reading the good reviews on Zomato. The ambience was nice, but the food was not worth the cost. Although the Lamb Lassagna ( I don't remember exactly what it was called but it costs Rs.395 and comes in 2 varieties - chicken and lamb). I also ordered a kiwishake and a honey pancake. The Kiwishake was kind of OK.

The whistling kettle is located near mouchak in Golpark..and it is a serene cafe escalated with the essence of Darjeeling cafes...which is amplified in the ambience of the cafe..coming to the main part which is the food & beverage
..me and my partner took two types of teas comprising of a basil tea & a special type of tea which according to me is the best part there..and was very gently served in a beautiful wine glass..and we took two types of sandwiches one each of egg & chicken grilled which was also very good..& also some cakes comprising of a chocolate truffle & chocolate brownie one..which was also good in taste..only the downside was that that of the quantity of the cakeswhich was very less and could have been better. & lastly we took a strawberry shake which was yoghurt based and was very different from a usual strawberry shake and was very good...the service was also overall good..if not the best..but overall we had a completely satisfying experience & could not wait to come back..aptly recommended for some private time with ur closed ones.

The Whistling Kettle is located just opposite the CCD in Golpark. The decor is simple yet elegant. Love the display as soon as you enter the store. 

Coming to the food we ordered lasagne, prosciutto pizza, cold coffee and chocolate milkshake- loved all of it. Also ordered the truffle cake- which was good to taste but was very dry. Our bill was 1322 INR. 

All in all it is a great place to visit. üòå

Overhyped place. We had order for black tea which they had forgotten and then told us we had ordered for green tea. We corrected them that its black tea  . The waiter who came to serve us again told us that green tea was being served and insistwd we ordered green tea only.so we told him and asked him for the menu to actually show what we had ordered. Finally he owned up and said it was his mistake.
Next we had ordered for chicken sandwich. We asked them to grill it to which they mentioned they would charge 30 rupees extra for grilling . Why extra charge for grilling? We also ordered for brownies and marble cake slice which were just ordinary. Didnt find the place great at all. I was specially attracted by the name but fizz iz out of the bag. Super slow service. Hope they improve their service. Not visitong the place again.

I believe this a great place to visit. It has this nice quiet decor in a bustling city like Kolkata. Top it up with the pictures of Darjeeling and it looks marvellous.

Coming to the food, we took the Chicken Ham Sandwich and the Chicken Salami Sandwich, along with Lemon Tea. The platter did live up to our expectations.

My visit to this place was very satisfactory. It has a cozy ambience and the staffs were very cordial. we ordered the pork platter with cheese garlic bread as suggested by the lady.The food was simple and yummy but made a wrong choice at drinks, did not like the mint herbal tea. Altogether a great experience and definitely will be back there just for the vibe of the cafe and to try something new.

Saw this cafe in Zomato and the first thing which dragged me to their cafe was the d√©cor of the teapots. Made my first visit as soon as I landed to the city yesterday. Quite centrally located and easy to find. The cafe is nicely decorated with a widely collection of their various teapots as soon as you enter the cafe. The inside decor is also very classy and chic with the right amount of seating and space. Well lit and bamboo carved lights is adding much more meaning to this place. 
Food : the exotica tea ordered was awesome with nice fragrance. Cheese omlette was just way it is suppose to be. Quick service and reasonably priced. Please visit !

My venture to this place has totally not been satisfactory... This well mantained cafe located just diagonally across the golpark ccd , was a huge expectation for me! I had read reviews and the speciality about their teas. I and my fellow foodie went there today . It was raining outside and the cafe had a umbrella rack so there was no worrying about the umbrellas! We settled down at our table which sadly had the drinks menu only. We thought that the people there would approach us with the food menu but little did they do so... And finally after 35 mins of waiting, we requested for the menu!

Coming to the food we ordered a chicken supreme pizza which had it's price drastically increased! ( It was about 375 rs earlier and now 410 rs). Not knowing which tea to take, we asked the lady in charge around there which tea to take and she suggested we go for a herbal basil tea which only warmed our body which was already cold from the rain outside. Hardly did it taste good! We kinda gulped the tea ... The pizza however was very tasty though they could provide a little more amount to the amount charged.

Finally coming to the bill we were taken aback by the 18% gst charged as opposed to the 6% vat earlier! (This is a major point to be noted as people may take the earlier tax in mind and take the required amount of money).

Overall dissafactory experience!

The old card shop in golpark has had an upgrade and how. Welcome to the whistling kettle which serves up a slice of the hills . They have a wide variety of tea and coffee and I hear it's quite the selection. My friend enjoyed her darjeeling and I  rather liked the iced tea. We thoroughly enjoyed the paper thin pepperoni pizza . The food and the ambiance cannot be faulted and I have to be back for the pork platter. The service is prompt but the place tends to get a bit crowded .

Oh I m in love with this place !!! 

When bored with CCDs and Baristas, happened to found this place. Its so nice to be here. Located in the bylanes of golpark mouchak. Not very tough to locate. Once you enter you have all those tea pots on display on the right and a tea counter on the left, if you want to buy. 

Now you enter a lazy cozy place packed up with people (lucky to have found a place instantly without much hassle). The source their tea from Nathmulls Darjeeling and they have quite a variety to serve. 

Ordered Coffee on the Rocks ( A Must Try), a cold coffee with ice cream, and the Pork Platter... 

Coffee on the rocks was really something different and I loved it thoroughly. 

The Cold coffee with ice cream was not upto the mark at all.

Now the Pork Platter _ Pork Sausage Bacon Ham Salami and Fried eggs. It was a treat. All so much meat and the taste was great. Although a bit oily. Everything was cooked to perfection.
P.S.:
A Small Piece of Darjeeling in the heart of Kolkata !!

Situated just next to CCD in Golpark this place is easily accessible and very welcoming .
It had a perfect ambience to sit around with a book and spend some lonesome time or catch up on old friends .
The variety of Tea is a speciality of this place and the ambience is perfectly sublime .
The place is moderately priced and their chicken platters are yummy .
Service is good .
The decor is very light and soothing .
There is a a Musical corner for gigs as well .

Review has been long overdue!! Just to give u an idea I visited first time on 26th June and already been there thrice as of today. Hence will write one consolidated review. What can I say the place ticks all the right boxes and would love to give them 5 stars but decided to hold back .5!! We ordered the Pork platter with ham sausages and eggs, bacon and egg sandwiches, pepperoni pizza, ruby tea, margarita pizza, Pork jumbo sandwich, white tea infused with rose petals and nathmulls limited addition tea.The food was delicious and cooked to perfection especially cos many eateries tend to overcook the bacon which makes it hard and I personally hate bacon cooked that way. The tea was served i champagne flutes and wine goblets which was fantastic presentation cos it showcases the tea to perfection- emphasises the color of the tea one is drinking. My personal fav is the Vietnamese coffee I have had all 3 times I went there. The pizzas are also some of the best I have had in kolkata. Service is also a thumbs up cos they take care and recommend the correct food or drink. Ambience of a place is also v important and here to they score high cos of the music u play. If buble plays I am sold on a place just goes to show that the owners and staff and good taste which definitely will help them go a long way. Bon appetite

It was a wave of nostalgia to see the wonderful tea sets on a cupboard that greeted us at the entrance of this dainty place. The Whistling Kettle captures the essence of an old tea room in Darjeeling in the blistering heat of Calcutta.

They source their teas from Nathmulls estates, and the selection is commendable. Try their delicately floral white teas or the excellent first flush. If you're a meat lover, you'll flip over the pork platter that comes with two fried eggs and a selection of cured meats, including a wonderfully lean ham and garlicky salami.

Also recommended are their fluffy pancakes, although they could go a touch more generous with the toppings.

The ambience is cozy, while the service is fast and polite. It was great to see the owner hold the doors for customers. This place can quickly become a modern classic in the city's gastronomic landscape.

Our only complaint was perhaps the portion sizes when compared to the prices, which are admittedly high. Great for friends and family though.

I am glad that I chose this place to quench my long awaited desire for lasagna. Though I am not a tea lover, when you see the beautiful presentation of tea being served on the tables around you, you might also crave for it like me. As my friend described, it's heaven for tea lovers. The cold coffe with ice cream served in cute mason jars also paved into my check list. This place has got an elegant touch. The simple decor, smiling courteous and beautiful staffs, live music add to it's charm. The thing that speacially caught my eye was the door mat at tge ebtrance which depicted a google map written on it "you have reached your destination''  üòä

The interior is quite impressive and the shop is well maintained. The lemon tart was delicious but the Swiss lemon roll was stale and dry. The server placed a bottle of mineral water on our table and charged us 30 rupees on the bill. Thankfully we didn't use the bottle so the amount could be deducted. The tea stock is limited but that is probably due to the ongoing strike In Darjeeling

Nice cosy place...suited ideally for the younger generation. Not recommended if you like to spend few moments quietly over a cup of tea. The USP of the joint is live music performance..at times which leads to cacophony. The grilled chicken salami sandwich was very tasty, fresh and wholesome...did not try other food options...may be sometime else...

The Whistling Kettle is one of the latest trending place in Kolkata. The ambience over here is praiseworthy and the decoration is also done nicely. Staffs are very friendly. I found the food to be a little overpriced. We had Chocolate Milkshake, Chicken Sausages and Pork Ham Sandwich. Milkshake had its usual taste. Sausages were not at all great. But yes I loved the sandwich. My friend told me that they serve delicious Lasagna and Meat Ball Spaghetti. You can for them.

The loaded pork breakfast platter is to die for. Brings back memories of sitting on the Keventers rooftop. The only thing missing is the panoramic Kanchenjunga view.

The pizza is quite good as well..the crust is thin and even - feels good when you bite into it. 

Service: 5.0. There was a slight problem with the food I ordered. Not only did they immediately replace it, they simply did not let me pay. These are the little things which always make you come back. Cheers guys. Keep it up!!

Cozy little cafe, serves all day breakfasts.
Tried 1.the Pork Platter with ham, sausages, bacon and fried eggs. The bacon was delicious.
2. Lasagne al ferno - contained chicken keema cooked in Indian spices. Decent. Too oily.
3. Cold coffee - strong coffee, nothing out of ordinary.
The lasagna seemed to be a wrong idea. Should have ordered pizza instead. Pizzas seemed to be popular, everyother table was having it.

It's a good thing in the city!

You get an assortment of tea leaves for the tea lovers for their daily cups.

We went their for a late lunch and got ourselves seats available without waiting and as the day passed into evening their were too many patrons.

Regarding the food:

Coffee on the rocks::: give it a try. You would be given a glass full of ice. And a small tumbler with condensed milk and a coffee filter above where the the hot coffee would filter and trickle down drop by drop. It's good to look at the gradual changes. Finally the person catering to you would arrive and make you the coffee on the rocks. It tastes great. Give it a try.

Pork sausage bacon ham salami & egg fried ::: it's a platter full of meat in all forms. The sunny side up eggs were made to perfection. The meat were well cooked and delicious.

Bread toast ::: the bread butter was ordered to go with the meat platter. They were fresh.

Chicken sausage salami meat loaf & eggs ::: this was another grand platter for the chicken lovers. I thoroughly enjoyed every morsel of the plate.

Walnut banana cake ::: this was good fruit cake. I have soft corner for banana cakes and this was it. Fresh.

Truffle cake::: this was awesome. Very chocolatey.

I need to go there again and again for the tea and the food and the entire environment out there.

Edit1- I visited here again...
Ordered a funghi pizza with added chicken topping- it's too good. Rich with mozzarella cheese and the mushrooms and chicken toppings. The amount is great. You can't finish it alone. It was awesome.

Kee Mao Piccanti con frutti di mare - I ordered it in speghetti. It had pan fried prawns, bhetki fried, mushrooms.. it was awesome and very delicious. It had a distinct flavour.

I also got tea leaves this time. Arya green tea- first flush.... I haven't yet brewed it. But the aroma of the leaves was great. 100gm costed 225/-. Hope it turns out great.

The first thing I loved about this place was the great music- oldies that I hadn't heard in so long. Even though I'm a non-vegetarian, I had vegetarian food because of the people I went with. And I wasn't disappointed a wee bit. I had one of the best vegetarian pastas I've had in recent times- packed with fresh and crunch vegetables. The presentation of the pizza was interesting too. Their cannelloni was delectable. 

The only con was the drinks we'd ordered- their chocolate shake was plain old chocolate milk with no flavour. Their pancakes were great but lacked presentation in the form of some whipped cream. 


All in all, a fun place to hang out with good food.

Too close to noise but too far to crowd.
The cozy cafe greeted us with charming smile and light music.
Very small place but well managed. Nice wooden interior. One small stage for live music.
We enjoyed a nice cup of darjeeling tea and milk coffee, with a egg and meat platter.
It was very nice place to have a cup of beverage untill the college crowd enters the place became very noisy.

Meat was prepared nicely, but little over salty.

The staffs are good to take brief orders.
But they are insisting us to leave with their weird behavior, that was very annoying.

Anyway... Thanks for the mixed experience

Cozy place at a very convenient location with good food and live music. Loved the ambience of the cafe...dimly lit, wooden seating, bamboo lights and black and white pictures of darjeeling on the walls. Food was quite good ..we ordered teas, pizza and lemon tarts. The live music ( we had some youngsters playing sinatra, john denver, elvis songs )  livened up the atmosphere. The entrance or reception area has an interesting collection of teapots and teas as well as the 'whistling kettle' ! A must visit for all calcuttans and those visiting it !!

I was not hopeful about getting a table without waiting as almost all the reviews say so. But luckily for us,it wasn't that crowded when we went. The ambience is very pretty with woven hanging lamps and black and white posters. The staff and the owner were very friendly. They gave us enough time to place the order as we were waiting for another friend to arrive. 

We had :

1. A mango ice tea : It was refreshing and sweet. The flavour was amazing!

2. Lasagne :  Minced chicken baked in cheese that melted in our mouth. One of the best lasagnes I had. 

3. Chicken supremo pizza : Thin crust pizza with lots of chicken and cheese. As I am allergic to mushroom,I had asked them to not put mushrooms and they were very careful about it. The pizza was spicy and hence I loved it more.

I was very satisfied with the overall experience. Definitely coming back for more again.

Finally the pork lovers of Calcutta got a lovely place to satisfy their meat hungry souls ! Located conveniently just opposite to Golpark CCD, this small joint has got everything Glenarys and Keventers have except the view of the majestic Kanchanjungha ! A perfect place for non vegetarian teenagers and also aunty uncles who miss Darjeeling ! Cold coffee with icecream and chicken stuffed omlete were üëéüëé but pork ham sausages and bacon were heavenly and the mango shake üëçüëç A bit of melted cheese could have made the Omlete taste a bit better i think ! The live music or the background scores were just cherries on the cake !

Overall ambience was good. Food was simple however the concept of serving tea in a wine glass is not so great an idea as u will be more cautious holding the glass rather than enjoying your cup of tea.We had also ordered for nutella pancake but we were told that" the kitchen is too busy ".Well this was not expected from a startup cafe like this.

Me and my friend met there for brunch. We ordered kiwi shake, nathmulls ice tea first. The kiwi shake was really refreshing and helped us cool down from the heat.. The ice tea tasted normal like any other ice tea.. Then we ordered chicken stuffed omlette and i loved its simplicity.. Nothing extra was added to it
. Just the home made plain omlette and in between you'll find chicken bits and loads of it. Chicken supremo Pizza was also good. It had a thin crust. Tastes good. Overall would love to go there again.

I had lot of expectations from Whistling Kettle. The reviews were brilliant, the menu looked great unfortunately however the food wasn't up to the mark. I took the Pork platter and was  utterly disappointed with the quality. The meat served was overcooked and terribly salty. I would specially like to mention the ham and salami which were so bad that it felt like having rubber with a coating of salt on top of it. The best part of the platter were the double fried eggs with sunny side up. I had also ordered the Mango flavoured Ice Tea which was terribly sweet and had no Tea in it. 

I however loved the Vietnamese Coffee. Interestingly that was not on the menu and I came to know reading the Zomato reviews. 

I might just go back again to give it another chance and hope I am pleasantly surprised this time.

With the whistle let's start the experience we had there. This is a very new joint in town. To be honest this is the paradise of tea lovers. This came from the famous tea brand of Darjeeling Nathmull and in association with the famous Darjeeling Keventers.
And when you hear the name Keventers the famous meat platter came to your mind for sure.

Location:
___________
It's in the lane beside the sweet shop Mouchak at Golpark. Just walk 10 meter, you will find the place on the right hand side.

Decoration:
______________
I am in love with the decoration of the place. When you enter the cafe the wall is decorated with different type of tea pot sets, cup, tea bag. That was just amazing.
Then we entered to the main area, where sitting is available. The decoration of dim light and wooden decoration was just class. But yes on the weekend the place is a bit crowded. We had to wait 25 mins to get our table.

Food and beverage
____________________
Well every time I write a review I always started with the food and then come the beverages. But this time I will not do so, it's because we loved their beverages items at best.

Beverages:
____________
‚úì Nathmull Limited Edition tea: Darjeeling tea for you. I am not a big tea lover but my friend enjoyed every sip of it. And yes do not waste the smell and vibrant taste of it by adding sugar. Nice one.
‚úì Kiwi Shake: this is just amazing. The flavour of kiwi with shake blended just perfectly.
‚úì Kiwi Ice tea: we basically opted for this watching the Keventers bottle in the table just beside us :P
And yes this was just smashing. Superb is taste.
‚úì Lemon ice tea: it also come in the famous Keventers bottle. But not taste as good as previous one.

Food:
_________

‚úì Pork Sausage Bacon Ham Salami and egg fried : the famous meat platter. that was superb. Loved this totally. Yes it would have been best if it a less oily. But the experience bis fantastic.

‚úì Cheese Garlic Toast: superb in taste. Going will with the pork platter. But I found it that tastey that you can have it stand alone.

‚úì Lasange Al Frena : we took the chicken lasange. When they served it the smell - that actually told you the food will be that tastey. Well shredded chicken cooked perfectly.

We had a plan to taste many more items. But we were stomach full. So, we have to visit again here, yes there are lots of items left out, and we are pretty sure that would be equally tastey.

All that cost 1350 INR.

Special mention:
___________________

about their hospitality :)

And last but very important one is the live performance. Live performance of setar and tabla was so soulful that it just dragged my attention from food to their performance. I don't know those guys but will request Whistling Kettle management to wish them from our end. It was a treat to have their performance in that evening.

To Management:
____________________
Love to see this outlet, very happy to find out the broad collection of all day breakfast and the collection of tea. Keep it up guys. Long way to go.

To all : I guess their is no need to tell you guys to give a visit here as this is already creating a buzz. And this is deserving also. So, if you are not yet sure, just give a visit there ..... Till then happy fooding... And yes with whistling :D

Situated in the lane of mouchak; the entrance isn't very impressive  but as you enter you'll see beautiful kettles decorating the shelves. Anyway , the cafe could've been better decorated. The seating arrangement is not so impressive either. The tables are extremely small. We took a table for 3 and the huge menu card would barely fit the table. The space of the cafe hasn't been utilised well. 

Coming to food. We ordered basil tea and  mint tea. Tea was pretty good. But they serve it in wine glasses which make it very difficult to hold since its so hot. Worst decision ever. To serve tea in wine glasses. Seriously? What were they thinking?
The bacon was good. So were the sunny side ups. All day breakfast is a good idea though. Do try the bacon there.
Overall this is a nice place to visit once. But revisiting it is questionable.

No greetings to start with..kind of finding own table ..
No cutlery in table even after serving a food..
No water or table preparation or even napkins refilled.
Forgot the shake ..had to remind almost after completing the food halfway.....
No attention to details ...
Food is just about average..nothing to blow you.
Over rated at zomato..

Only saving grace is the small but we'll decorated ambience and only if you want to sip a cup or coffee and enjoy with friends or special ones or family for long hours .

Well now that I've been to this place more than once, I should say this that there are cafes and then there are Caf√©s. And this one's the latter. Whistling kettle so the Name suggests is a Tea lover's paradise. You get the best of Nathmulls Darjeeling. And for the Caffeine addicts, you'd have a fair share of freshly brewed coffee here. 
The food you get is an All day breakfast menu. Eggs, Sandwiches, meat.. Or a slice of cake, you'd find them all here. 
Ambience is appropriate for a Bengali adda session or a nice romantic evening date. Really wish this place had a larger room accommodating more people at a time. 
They serve you with a smile and Tea in a Wine glass is such an exotic idea! 
I'm going back there again to have another second flush. Thumbs up.

This newly opened little gem of a cafe is located near Golpark post office. This place will take you back to the Darjeeling with it's neat and clean interiors and essence of Darjeeling Tea. You will get pork a chicken platter( Reminds you about the legendary Keventers), sandwiche, Pizza, pasta , coffee and ofcourse Tea.
We were really blown away by the simplicity of this place.

We Ordered : Pizza Supremo, Mango Milkshake and Strawberry Milkshake.

# Both the milkshakes were thick, fabulous and very tasty. 
# Pizza came in a wooden tray. 8 delicious slices of pizza topped with chicken ham, babycorn, mushroom, onions, bell pepper and Mozzarella cheese. The freshly baked thin crusted pizzas were filled with lovely flavour of oregano and Chilli flakes. 

Staffs and the owner are very friendly and the service is excellent too. Prices are also reasonable and they charge only 6% Service tax. 
We will definitely be going there for their other dishes. 
Recommended....

I don't even remember the last time I had given any restaurant a perfect 5. This one is bang on and it's just perfect from every aspect. You MUST MUST visit this one and not miss at any cost. The place is located diagonally opposite Golpark CDD in the 'Mouchak lane'. The place is always crowded even on weekdays so don't take it for granted that you will find a seat easily. The food is just amazing- right quantity, amazing taste and super affordable pricing. The pizza is really good much better than few renowned pizzerias in town and the best part the price is almost half, so double the taste and half the price what else would you ask for. The menu options are not plenty but the ones available are gastronomically satisfying. The lasagne is good too along with shakes and their delectable pork platter. A special mention about the super warm hosts who don't fail to impress you.¬†

Location:At Golpark,just beside the very famous sweet corner Mouchak. This place is extremely easy to locate.
We stepped in to this place yesterday that's 18.06.17 at an evening hour and this place made our teadate worthwhileüôÇ
We already had lunch n then we came here so couldn't have much but I was more interested to taste their tea which was really good n refreshing.
I must say they have a perfect tea room decor I specially loved the front room it has a brilliant look n feel.
Coming to food we had Nathmulls Hot lemon tea n cheese spread toast both tasted good enough!
Will definitely come over here shortly,all good luck to Team Whistling Kettle!

Interior wise, it's like an restaurant not The cafe feel. Sitting comfort just Zero. Serving time is very slow, Staffs are not experienced. Don't try black coffee, very bad taste. And sandwiches are good in taste but not properly grilled. Extra charge for grilling@Rs30. Cold coffee was taste average. Totally wastage of money.

Only come to this place if you have no work at all...and you can stand and spend hours waiting for a seat and observing people, who are just sitting with a cup of tea. I came here thrice and everytime the waiting time was around 1 hour. Even if their food is good....management is disastrous...! Even a simple tea shop like dolly's runs way more smoother than this place..! This place needs to buckle up as there are many tiny joints around this area which serve almost the same menu and the management is still excellent..!Never ever coming back to this place as the experience was disastrous..!

We Bangalis are very nostalgic about the hills in the north of our city. Ever since forever, Darjeeling has been the Mecca of all hilly tourist destinations for us. How would you feel as a foodie if a part of this Darjeeling nostalgia came down to you in the plains in this scorching heat of Kolkata? This is what has happened exactly this summer. 
The Whistling Kettle, an unit of the Nathmull Tea Group, a famous tea trading unit of Darjeeling has opened its doors to us Calcuttans in collaboration with Darjeeling Keventer's. We have always been missing the famous meat loaf platter from this legendary outlet of the hills. We are delighted to welcome this place and it is already evident from the rush that the place faces even on weekdays. 
After planning to come here for a long time, finally I had got the chance to visit with my sister and my friend

What is there to not like about a place that serves up a huge platter of chicken sausages, salami, fried eggs and meat loaf, made to perfection? Add to that the absolutely delightful vietnamese iced coffee (whichever, however, strangely, does not find mention on the menu card -- I wonder why), nutella pancakes, pancakes with maple syrup and crispy fried bacon and egg, lemon tarts and brownies. The music is lilting, the servers and owners are deliciously courteous,and the cafe is roomy, done up with old school pictures of Darjeeling and various delicate kinds of teas and tea sets. One could almost imagine being at a Glenary's or a Keventer's! The prices are on the higher side, but the food is worth visiting this place for. The Vietnamese Coffee will remain their highlight till any other place learns to make it as perfectly as they do.

Could you ever think of the best of Nuthmulls to be prepared and served to you on a hot humid day at Kolkata? Are you surprised that I didn't mention Darjeeling here? Please don't be. Visit whistling kettle to know how well a cafe in Kolkata think out of the box and rightly identify how Bengalis love everything about Darjeeling. Right from the variety of tea to the elaborate menu bringing out a resemblance of Keventers , it's a lively place to be. I visited on a working day around 5 pm and was amazed to see the footfall. By the time I left there were many standing in queue for a table. Well decorated , lovely service. Liked the way they serve you tea in small wine glasses. Also the serving time was not more than 10 mins. There is a lovely tea counter just when you enter where you can purchase your flavour of tea leaves and the area is well decorated with beautiful tea pots and tea sets.
Although I couldn't try much from the menu being in a hurry, yet another visit is soon on the cards.

We ordered chicken supremo pizza n I am still licking my lips. A great pizza after a long time. Must must try. The rating is thanks to the pizza. the place seemed short staffed too. I hope next time when I go I return back with more smiles n lip smacking food

The next time we had the Nutella pancakes "yum" and pork bacon. All i didn't understand is the tax system. The first time there was no tax but the second time we had to pay tax. The pork platter is still on the "yet to try" list.

Is is located just opposite of golpark CCD. Yesterday I was there  with my mom and had a great time over there. As I know the place is newly open but the crowd Said different. When we visited there it was full. After 15 minutes we got our table. It's a small cafe but well groomed. Nice place to spend a long time with buddies with tea/coffee and some food. 

They have variety of teas in their manu. But my mood was not support me to order tea. So I ordered kiwi shake which was so yummy and my all time favourite cold coffee  but one off their team member asked me to order Vietnamese coffee. He said, this is most selling house special coffee so I go with that and he was right. The coffee fragrance and taste was damn good. Next our order was spaghetti Bolognese. Little spicy in test as I like. Good portion. The service is also good courteous team members. All the best the Whistling kettle team. Keep up the good work.
Thank you

This has become a much talked about food joint in South Kolkata and being a foodie, I had to pay a visit here. Coming to the ambience, the place is not that spacious but is beautifully decorated with soothing lamp lights. On Sunday evening this place was pretty crowded and we had to wait for a few minutes to get our seats. Despite the huge crowd they provided service as fast as possible which is very impressive.
We had taken the nathmull's speciality tea, strawberry milkshake, grilled cheese sandwich, masala omlette, margherita pizza, lemon tarts and chocolate tart.
Each of them tasted very nice.
The masala omlette was nothing special though, compared to the pricing. The tarts were heavenly.
There's nothing to tell about the tea as everyone is familiar with Nathmull's blissful tea.
And about the pizza, I would like to suggest that adding the oregano and chilli flakes be left to us only since we can add them according to our preferances. I don't like chilli flakes in my pizza and thus it was a problem for me.
But overall I am satisfied with everything.
And long way to go for The Whistling Kettle!

A very pretty cafe. The entrace consisting of the cash counter have got several shelves on the wall and kettles with beautiful,colourful artwork adorned the shelves. This definitely did justice to the name of the cafe! üòä

They have a live music corner. Musicians play from 6pm to 8pm. Although if anybody wants to play the guiter and sing they can do so!üòÄ
Walls are decorated with pictures of darjeeling, pictures of tea garden and there were pretty ligtenings above the tables.üòäLovely ambience.

Coming to the food, we wanted to have lasange and pizza but they said that their oven is not working so they cannot offer anything from the Italian menu! üòî

We then ordered a chicken platter of chicken sausages and meat loaf with fried eggs. This was good. üòä

Chicken salami sandwitch. This was two pieces of grilled sandwitch with salami and mayo. This was tasty. I liked the crispiness of the bread.

Nutella Pancake was good too.

I would have given a 4.5 if all they had on there menu would have been availabe that day!

They have a tea store attached to the restaurant with a huge range of exotic teas and teapots, kettles, teacups and more to quench your thirst for teas.

Of all the breakfast spots that I have visited, this sits right on top of my list. The place is in a small lane near golpark and if only for some advertisement and publicity, it can easily be among the top places in Kolkata. The most important reason for loving this place is the staff which is accommodating at all times. The place lives up to its speciality i.e. tea and it does offer different and varied kinds of the same. The place caters to the young, middle aged and old people which can be evidenced by the fact that I had my mother and girlfriend to give me company & there was an old lady sitting right across the table enjoying her breakfast. Cheers to the people running this hidden gem, a revisit is round the corner!

The ambience was nice and the food quite alright but not as good as promised. I have heard my foodie friends highly praising  keventers but the pork platter I ordered was rather disappointing. The meat tasted good but the preparation was not upto the mark. They had too much salt in the bacon and the platter was cold. The lemon tea I ordered had a bit too much of lemon than that suits human taste. The strawberry and chocolate milkshakes were really nice and the spaghetti bolognese was also good.The manager was especially sweet and attended every guest personally. We expected faster service though the waiters were polite, given that they are kind of new I thought I would cut them some slack.I plan to visit again because I don't want to give up on a place that promises keventers meat and such an attractive menu, hope they the service and the food preparation will be better next time.

What an amazing experience of Darjeeling !!
This place is a love to die for people who are fan of tea & coffee!
Decor & Ambience -
As you enter the place you will find on the right wall eyeopener teapots and on the left is counter selling packed tea..then as u open the next door is the world of a Darjeeling waiting for you..feels like some posh tea shop in Darjeeling..there is a small place for live band..2 guitars were kept..and to comment upon the space it's not that huge.

Welcoming & Staff-
The staff was polite and prompt in understanding as well as serving the order. They bought the tea kettle to make our nose smell the fragrance of Darjeeling green tea premium and exotica.I liked this concept and gesture of the whistling kettle.

Food & Taste-
We ordered garlic cheese sandwich, American corn sandwich, lemon tart, Green tea premium & Green tea exotica. Both sandwich were good and the quantum of serving was also perfect. Lemon tart was fine. Last and the most amazing green tea..OMG!! I have never had such green tea ever..trust me fellas it's too good. The aroma of the was itself refreshing.

Overall Response-
I highly recommend this place for morning breakfast. Though I haven't tried the pasta and pizza but I will visit this place again for sure. If this place increases the area of its territory..it will be the Tea Territory of south Kolkata.!! Do not worry about pocket pinch as it is economical guys..5 items for 470 bucks..it's cheap considering the quality and quantity of food served.!

P.S. The Washroom Pic - Never seen such washroom at an eating joint of this order.! Specially the quotation..LOL!

This place a discovery...it is fresh, it is new, it has a great ambience n it has the soul of Darjeeling. The Whistling Kettle is located in Golpark, right opposite to the CCD and it is usually always crowded but the staff is really courteous and tries to accommodate everyone fast so that you don't have to wait much. 
The interior will remind you of the cozy eateries in Darjeeling with the wooden furniture n all. Also there is a small stage for live musicians playing n if u r lucky u might get to see one playing when u r there. 
Now coming to the food which I thought was really tasty. We enjoyed it so much that we ordered a second helping. We had eggs n sausage, omelette stuffed with chicken, chicken salami n grilled chicken salami sandwich, which in my opinion was the tastiest dish. The only let down was the chicken sausage which was not juicy enough n I thought of deducting half a point for that....bt their service makes it up for everything else. N a big thumbs up for that! 
The most interesting part in the menu are the variety of tea they provide n they serve the tea in wine glasses which just enhances the experience. Since I am not a tea drinker I chose not to take any beverage from the menu bt the staff insisted me to try the Vietnamese coffee which they make specially n it really tasted amazing. 
Even if you don't want to sit n spend some time here, you can always visit this place to try out the wide variety of teas which is up for sell in the front section. N next time I am there I will surely get some for my home. üòä

When I was in college, I used to frequent the card shop Expressions in Gol Park. It was a large shop with cards of versions occasions and pocket friendly gifts. I had lots of fond memories there. 
Nowadays the idea of gifting cards have become obsolete. Everything is available in the internet. Naturally the beautiful shop felt a setback in sales. And so, it departed to give way to this outlet.
I took a peak in there.
First of all, it is fantastically decorated. I loved it. The seating arrangement, the overhead lights, the wall decor, the large tv screen - all are praiseworthy and tender a warmth to the entire outlet. 
Looking at the crowd, I realise that it has become a hub for all the elite people out there.
The menu card is large typed, much to the  benefit of the dim sighted old eyes. 
The owners are very polite and eager people. The staff I should say are overworked and superbly busy but polite. 
The outside part of the outlet is the sales corner for Darjeeling tea and the gifts related to tea. The inside part is the eatery.
I chose Vietnamese coffee and prom platter parcelled.
Vietnamese coffee on the rocks comes with a different arrangement not experienced previously. The taste is a sweetened and thickened cold coffee. 
The pork platter was parcelled. It tasted crispy, but I would have preferred less saline in the food.
Parking is not an option here. You have to park your car some distance away and then come walking down this busy lane.
Price reasonable.

A slice of Darjeeling curved out in bustling Kolkata.

Its a delight to drop in at TWK. The outlet located opposite to Golpark CCD has a lovely decor and cool ambience ideal to hang out with friends over a cup of tea. The Darjeeling themed decor will give you a nostalgia of the typical tea bars of the hill. The small joint has a Tea & Kettle selling counter, an arena of live performances and a seating capacity of around 20-25 people. A big shout out to the patrons for arranging the availibilty of world famous tea brand Nathmulls in our very own Kolkata, wherein apart from purchasing raw tea one can even sip in various types of their flavoured teas starting from Green Tea and White Tea. The White Tea has been a revelation and is served in a wine glass !!
Even the food items are too good. The sausage sandwiches taste delicious. The omlett with sausage is also praiseworthy. The ex menu item of Vietnamese Coffee is alluring and a recommended chiller in this summer. Rarely I have come across such a place which has such a lovely combination‚Äã of good food, ambience,decor, services everything.
Last but not the least, the service is phenomenal as the staffs are cordial, gentle and friendly. The warmth of their ever smiling reception is really heartwinning, even the frustration of waiting in que will disappear with their amiable approach. 

This place is highly recommended. One should at least drop in once to experience the cordial warmth of this place.

This cafe is a gem. It is located at the lane of golpark ccd.. The decoration is great right from the entrance to the sitting area. It has a pleasant ambience and very friendly staff. 
Coming to food, we ordered the chicken meat platter which was tasty and chicken grilled sandwich which was again decent in taste. I liked the extra buttery flavor of the sandwich bread. Lastly, I loved the vietnamese coffee. It is one of the perfect cold coffees I had in a long time. 
I would love to visit this place again :)

Beautiful cozy little place.. the decor is very nice and offbeat considering the type of cafe it is.. they offer very prompt service. As you enter the cafe, the lady would greet you very nicely. Food is not extraordinary, but it's satisfactory. A nice place for evening conversation - i don't generally like the cafe chains present in the city. But  one can sit here with a cup of tea, for long hours - the ambience is such.. loved it !!

If you are a chai person, you must definitely visit this place. 
We went for brunch and ordered a vegetarian pizza, American corn sandwich,mushroom sandwich and nutella pancakes in food. All of them were really tasty. The pizza had a thin crust and lip smacking toppings! The pancakes were loaded with flavor. Might be the best ones I have had so far.

Now coming to the part I loved the most - The TEA!!! My God, these guys have the best tea in town! I mean it. I was never a tea person, but Shiley ( I guess I got the name right ) our host , was kind enough to tell me why I was brewing my tea wrong and how I could correct it. She suggested a tea after listening to my weird specifications. And I swear , the tea she served was the best I have had. (I shall add the exact names when I remember them correctly) . Making a coffee person enjoy tea isn't easy, that how amazing it was. 

Can we take a second to appreciate how friendly the staff were ? I would go back just for them (and their tea). They sell their tea leaves too. 

I'd give this place a 10 star rating if I could! This is a cozy cafe which will blow your mind. It really exceeded all expectations! 

 PS: Dear Management, you guys are doing a great job. I wish I had walked into your cafe earlier!

It's a new one at Golpark area. Quite easy to locate. I really loved the decor of the place. They have a small stage, kind of, may be for musical performances. Now I come to the food. We ordered Chk. Ham Sandwich & Lasagne al ferano. The Sandwich was too simple, I was expecting a bit more cheese and may be a thick piece of ham. But the Lasagne was mouth watering, walla. It made me forget the boring sandwich. I would like to visit once again.

The Whistling Kettle is one of the newest fine Tea Room/Cafe in the city of joy which is gaining immense attention and attraction for it to be one of a kind here.All the way with great spirit and roots of Darjeeling ,this place is located very close to the Golpark crossing or more precisely addressed at¬†23/3, Gariahat Rd, Kankulia, Dhakuria, Kolkata, West Bengal 700029. I was here on a invitation ,Thanks to Kamalika of First Idea Pr for fixing this up.Moving on and talking about this place well it is nothing less than a dream come true for not just Tea lovers but absolute lip smacking Cafe food lovers. The place is running in full pace for almost over 2 months now and it is doing excellent . Special thanks to Bonisha for being the best host you could ever imagine to come across ,as greeting you as a Blogger and every other single customer at other tables right from the start to the end with such genuine nature and friendly attitude is a sight to see and feel different, that is why the question arises how often do you see that happening in the city places to eat and drink when all are treated the same ? Probably in the most rarest and special cases but here people and things to eat/drink both are very chilled in nature quite literally (referring to the cold beverages) .
                                          ...

Whenever I visit Darjeeling, I go crazy over the food at Keventer's. Sausages, Sandwiches, Omlettes and Darjeeling Tea. Now, you can get all of that without traveling to Darjeeling right at Golpark. The Service is tad shaky ( Teething trouble maybe ), other than that the food is yummy and the tea is perfection served in wine glasses. I am going back there again and again and again......

DARJEELING- It's a staple in travel diet of Bangalis when it comes to hillstations.In this scorching heat of summer mountain is calling out to us for a getaway but most of the people can't follow their heart due to busy schedule.

Although it isn't a solution to the scorching heat,a slice of Darjeeling is here in Kolkata in form of gastronomic delights.The Whistling Kettle is here with a menu similar to legendary Keventer's.I came here with Anamitraa/The Gut Filling and her cousin last evening.We had to wait for few minutes as it was full even in a weekday evening.
The place is lit soothingly inside and there are quirky artworks adorning the wall some of which depicting culture and heritage of Darjeeling.We opted for a all pork platter and a chicken platter compromising of meat loaf and sausages.

‚Ä¢Chicken platter- It's the first time I tried meat loaf.I liked it.Meat was tender with a smoky note.The fried sausages were good as well.

‚Ä¢Pork platter- It was heavenly! Every component of this platter excelled in terms of taste.The sausage had a great flavour profile and almost melted in mouth.The bacon had the perfect proportion of fat and meat.Pork salami and pork ham had smokiness and seasoning which were spot on.We loved it and completed the entire platter in a very short span of time.

This place is so popular for its meat platters that they overshadow the desserts served here.For me and my friend a meal is incomplete without desserts.So we had a look at their dessert counter for a sweet ending to our meal.We opted for a special of the day chocolate truffle cake and a lemon tart.

‚Ä¢Chocolate truffle cake-The cake had a rich dark chocolate ganache frosting and flavour of unadulterated rum infused in it.I loved this classic combination of rum and dark chocolate.Every spoonful was a bliss to my palate.

‚Ä¢Lemon tart- It was such a refreshing dessert! The tart shell was perfectly crisp,buttery with a nice golden hue on it.The lemon curd had the right balance of sweetness and tanginess.This is the type of light dessert I love at the end of a heavy meal as it act as a great palate cleanser.We loved it so much that we couldn't control our temptation to order another piece of it.

Pricing is reasonable.Service was slow but maybe it's because the restaurant was fully packed and manpower was short compared to it.I am definitely going to come back here.

This cafe is one of the new buzz in the city.
A beautiful cafe which seems to be a tea and cutlery shop at the enterance,but there is another room inside with nice wooden chairs and dim light and music.
The staffs are friendly.
Initially we ordered for a chicken pasta but chicken was out of stock and so we were really disappointed.
So we took a risotto with prawn.
I am not much a fan of risotto but it was well cooked here,less spicy and cheesy.
But what we loved more is the Chicken Supremo pizza with chicken,ham,bacon.
8 pieces of thin crust pizza served on a long wooden tray tasted amazing.
This place specialises in tea and coffee.
So for drink we had tea.
We had magic ice tea in mango flavour.
I never had a chilled tea before taste so good.
Since Nathmula's white exotic tea was unavailable,we settled down for exotic green tea.
The tea was nice with perfect aroma and taste and served in a wine glass.Thats quite unique,again.
The staffs are well mannered and service is average.
Best wishes for this bright new cafe.

I am sitting at this place while i write this review. It is easy to locate situated opposite golpark ccd. 
It is a small and cosy place with vibrant staff. The decor is simple not over the top. 
Coming to the food i ordered ice tea, nathmulls exotic black tea abd caramelised onion and cheese grilled sandwich. The ice tea was nice. They serve their hot teas in  wine glass which gives you a sense of colour of the tea liquor. What i found really interesting was that they will bring the tea pot and ask you to smell the tea.
The sandwich was great as the caramelised onion and cheese turned out to be a hit combo.
Best wishes

Nice place and lovely decor, rather I must say it was a cute decor. Service was not so good. All over experience was nice. Had breakfast at this place. Ordered the Chicken Salami Sandwich which was really good and so was the cheese omelette. It was just awesome. But the scrambled egg was a disaster as it was very sweet. Their fried  Bacon was good but the Chicken Sausages were too hard as I suppose they didn't boil it properly. But you guys must visit this place as it really offers a wide variety of food including tea, milkshakes, omelettes, sandwiches, sausages, bacon, pancakes, etc. Do visit ::)) Was so hungry that forgot to click the picture!! :P

This new cafe has opened in Golpark just two shops after Mouchak. The entrance will seem like a tea shop and when you enter you will see a shop having varieties of tea and coffee displayed, they also have different kettles and cups displayed in shelves for sale. There is a second chamber which opens to the cafe area. The cafe is well decorated with a wall which has frames of famous bands and famous film artists and a jam area in front with an elevated platform which has a guitar and two high chairs. Each table has a unique lamp hanging above, the place is not too spacious but gives a cozy feeling. It is more like a hangout area for people of all ages. 
The menu doesn't have a large variety of food items but the ones that are there are well thought-of and worth trying. I ordered -
1.Pork Sausage Bacon Ham Salami Fried Egg- This giant platter will be served uniquely in a long wooden tray. The presentation gets A++ from my side. I had to taste all the items so I took a bit of each starting with the pork. People complain that very many places can't cook pork well. But if you try this pork platter you will definitely want to keep coming back to this cafe just to try the pork platter. The pork pieces were juicy and tender and easily chewable. The salami was a little salty but tasted well. I love poached eggs and it was an added bliss for me. The ham and bacon were tasty as well. The whole platter was so filling that 3 of us shared one and it was more than enough for us. 
2. Chicken Supremo Pizza- They serve this dish in a very innovative manner. They separate the pizza slices and place them one after another in a long wooden tray. They give mustard and tomato sauce in place of origano and chilly flakes- that's something new for sure. I tried with one pizza slice and put mustard and tomato sauce on it. The taste was unbelievable. It has thin crust and has a good amount of cheese and the small chicken pieces are good enough to fill your tummy. It didn't taste like an ordinary chicken pizza. The grilled mushrooms make the pizza taste better. Other than trying the pork platter, one can also give this pizza a try.
The ambience gets full marks, the presentation of the dishes is one of the most unique I have come across. Having pizza with mustard sauce and tomato ketup was different indeed. The food quantity is very good. The quality and the taste is commendable. The juicy and tender pork sausages and ham and bacon would definitely attract me to visit this cafe again and again.  The service is a little slow, probably because it was too crowded when I went. The price is reasonable enough depending on the location and the food is worth the price. A must try.

I am more tea person than coffee and I will be back here soon to enjoy their tea. Ambiance is very cozy and beautiful. Last but not the least, their music taste is so Good that this place give me such a warmth which I can't‚Äãignore. And, their huge collection of tea and accessories can be a good option to gift a tea lover. I will definitely visit this place soon.

The Whistling Kettle has created buzz recently ok the zomato and other social platform, so finally couple pf days back I visited this place.

‚óèLocated beside RG Celluler at the Golpark.

‚óèAmbiance and Deco was brilliant. Loved the theme and color..

‚óèOrdered Mango Shake and Chocolate Shake both were good but Mango shake should have been better if they used little sugar .
On the other hand Grilled Chicken Ham sandwich was mind blowing. 
Later I ordered Bacon Fried with Egg, it has too much salt and oil. Tasted average.

Hospitality was good. Will visit them again..

This place caught my eye especially because of it's convenient location. It is in Golpark. Almost at the opposite of CCD. The decor is good. We were informed that no baked items were available today as there was some problem with their electric lines. We ordered bannana shake, white tea, Scrambled egg and cheese and mushroom sandwich. The sandwich was the best. I dont like mushroom but I loved it in the sandwich. The tea was Refreshing. Most of the crowd was ordering shakes. The cost is not very high. Reasonable you can say. A nice place to spend evenings.

I am simply in love with this place. There are several reasons to fall in love with this place. Primarily, it reminded me of my favourite place, Darjeeling. The decor is unique, attractive & excellent. The host is welcoming, warm and gives individual attention to each & every guest. Coming to the food.. in one word its "wow"! They serve the original Nathmulls tea in wine glasses.. what a beauty! They serve the white tea in tall wine glasses which makes it look like exotic Champagne! If you are a Darjeeling Tea person then this place is a must visit. Also, they serve awesome sandwiches and meat platters. I am going to visit often & try out all the delicacies!

Wanted to check out this place chiefly cause it talks about one of my favourite place on earth but after my first visit I got more reasons to visit this place again.Coming to my experience , it is one of those place where the host takes utmost care to serve you,  you won't feel lonely or the ambience does not let you feel like a stranger. I headed there straight from office so needed a plate full of food and what better than a chicken platter which even for a hungry soul like me was enough to fed two persons. The herbal tea in basil flavour simply takes away your tiredness. I must admit it is first time I had something‚Äã like this tea and I would recommend this strongly. 
Overall the place left me with the desire to be there again. 
As an afternote I would like to add since evening is a rush hour for such a place you can expect to wait for sometime to get your place.

When you just end your jar of amazing shakes and you're greeted with the most genuine of smiles asking, "how were the shakes?", Your entire experience just automatically escalates to a whole new level.
Toss and top that with amazing sandwiches with the correct proportion of butter and mayonaisse and you're taken into the whole world of 'Chef, 2014'.
I am really amazed at how the new joints put in extra effort to the service and hospitality of the guests, almost making them feel at home for the little span you're in the place. Whistling Kettle is a must just to experience this being executed to perfection.
The interiors are very well suited to the ambience except the little extra large menu cards as compared to the tables.
But if you're in and around golpark and have an hour, visit this place. You'll have one ticked off of the cafe bucket list.

The Whistling Kettle from the Nathmulls of Darjeeling is the new talk of the town.. This cafe or should i say tea joint is a wonderful place which is at 23/3 Gariahat Road, near Mouchak Sweets, Golpark, Kolkata..
¬†

The exotic varieties of teas, that they have is amazing. You can almost feel the freshness of the hills from the aromas and the sight of them. I lived the white tea and how its presented.. Really top notch !
¬†

Special mention- The Vietnamese coffee is something that you can't afford to miss.. the presentation of it is beautiful and its heavenly.. I must have finished it in probably just 3 big sips..
¬†

In food, my favorite part, the Pork Platter is just too good.. The pork jumbo sandwiches with double layers and soft pork are excellent and i really loved them a lot..
¬†

Also in the Mediterranean section, the Spaghetti Bolognese or Lasagne Al Funo were amazing..
¬†

The atmosphere of the place is really soothing.. the staff is friendly and always ready to guide you serve you with a smile..
¬†

Once you visit the place you will want to come again and again... and again..!

Cursing those who are currently in the queen of hills Darjeeling and cursing them doubly that they are enjoying the delicious pork and chicken platters from Keventers and the heavenly brews from Nathmulls of Darjeeling? Well...  Stop the heartburn and you can be at The Whistling Kettle just off Golpark any day! 
Beautifully and minimalistically done up, the interior is cosy.  We tucked in at the House special Park Jumbo Sandwich while sipping the very very mild White Tea...  Said to be favoured by the Japanese Emperors for their youth retaining qualities. 
The chicken supreme Pizza is also recommended,particularly after drizzling some olive oil on it. 
All these, if they make you thirsty.. Have an iced tea. The iced tea will soothe you in true sense. 
I was looking forward to the pork platter.  It didn't disappoint barring the sausages.  I loved the bacon rashers. 
Those who like a touch of the Mediterranean,  try their spaghetti and the lasagna. Honestly...  I couldn't donjustice to them as I was too full of the other stuff. 
I brought back some lemon tarts for my kids and those were very very good too.. 
Try the Vietnamese Coffee too...  It's a completely different taste altogether. 
They have a in-house singer...  Just that due to the shortage of space it tends to get crowded. 
Visit by all means.

The Whistling Kettle is the latest destination for all meat lovers in Calcutta. The all day English breakfast menu which has been sourced from Keventers, Darjeeling is one the main reasons why Calcutta is greeting this place with love. Besides the meat platters, this place boasts of some amazing pizzas, pastas, sandwiches and a lot more. I was recently invited here and this place exceeded all my expectations.

The Whistling Kettle is located in Golpark, close to the CCD. What I loved the most about this place is the ambience. It looks exactly like those beautiful cafes in the hilly areas. The beautiful ceiling, the walls, the seating arrangement and everything else imparts an amazing feel to the cafe. The Whistling Kettle takes you on an amazing journey to Darjeeling with its stunning vibes and sets your mood. I was lucky enough to witness a live guitar performance, which was very soothing to the mind. Prior to the dining section there's a counter where you can purchase teas, tea sets and some beautiful kettles.

I was lost in the beauty of this place when I realised that it was time to try the food. It was a summer afternoon and I wanted to try some refreshing drinks to beat the heat. I initially started with the Lemon Iced Tea. It had the hint of lemon with slight sweetness. I loved the mild flavour and the refreshment it offered. I'm ready to sacrifice my craving for aerated drinks if iced teas turn out be so refreshing ! This is definitely a must try in this summer.

During the second round of drinks, I went for a Kiwi Shake. The quantity was appreciable. The shake was thick and not watery. It was sweet, chilled and refreshing. The flavour of kiwi in the shake was rich and brilliant. I also tried the Mango Shake, which my fellow blogger had ordered and it tasted equally amazing.

I was eager to try out their meat platter but they choose to serve the pizza first. It was Fungi Pizza, where the pizza was topped with mozzarella cheese and mushrooms. The pizza slices were cut and served horizontally in a criss cross fashion, probably to avoid the normal look. I absolutely fell in love with the base of the pizza. It was neither thick and nor too thin, but was soft enough that you won't be able to feel its presence. It was just the mushrooms and the enormous amount of cheese which I could feel in my mouth. That was a heavenly affair.

Next, I tried Lasagne Al Ferno. If you're expecting it to be very cheesy, then you're wrong. Well, I was surprised and taken aback by the amazing flavour of this lasagna. The minced chicken was cooked in a spicy sauce and stuffed within the pasta sheets. The flavour was interesting and it tasted out of the world. This definitely deserves a try.

Finally, it was time to try the much awaited Pork Platter. It included a fried egg, pork sausages, salami, ham and bacon. Everything on the platter tasted amazing. My favourites were the ham and the bacon. The quantity is huge and is well enough for two persons for a full meal. This platter can even satiate three provided you're up for some snacks. You can also order each of the ingredients seperately as per your choice.

I was too full to savour the Chicken Jumbo Sandwich which came next. I somehow managed to take a bite and it tasted good. The sandwich was stuffed with minced chicken and cheese. This isn't one among the same cheese and mayo dripping sandwiches. This tasted a lot different. The chicken had a pleasant smoky flavour. One plate consisted of four portions of the jumbo sandwich, which can easily fill up two hungry souls.

I ended my meal with the Vietnamese Coffee. In this, condensed milk and filter coffee is mixed and poured over a glass containing ice. I can definitely consider this to be the best variety of coffee available in the city. Even if you aren't a meat lover, you should visit this place just for this Vietnamese Coffee. The coffee had a beautiful sweet flavour which pleased my taste buds. I completely fell in love with it.

Overall, The Whistling Kettle is a hidden gem. You just can't stop visiting this place once you give it a visit. The pizza, the lasagna, the pork platter and my favourite Vietnamese Coffee made my day. The soothing ambience is perfect to chill with some food and drinks. The menu is vast and not just restricted to non vegetarians. Even vegetarians should visit this place as the menu has a lot of veg options. I will definitely visit this place sometime soon and try the other dishes on the menu, of course with my favourite Vietnamese Coffee.

If you are looking for a refreshing evening tea, W K, is not a bad choice. Good food and they definitely keep up to the flavour of the tea, in regards to their name. However, the shakes can be better and service has a lot of scope for improvement. Over all a fair experience.

The Whistling Kettle is another venture of the Nathbull's Tea house of Darjeeling in Kolkata and adding to the populous crowd of cafes around Golpark and the Lake area in South Kolkata.

Location: 
This is located just behind Mouchak sweets on the lane that leads to Kakulia and opposite to the Cafe Coffee Day. This place was earlier occupied by a cell phone store R.G. Cellular. 

Ambience: 
The doors of the shop opens up to a tea store which leads to the sitting area. The area is small and has around 9 tables and that does not leave much space. There is a tiny space for live performance. Overall the ambience is pleasing for this small cafe. The tables are tiny. They serve the tea in a wine glass shaped tumbler (same as they do in Darjeeling shops) and that is something that I don't appreciate. There is no open to air seating arrangement.

Food/Beverages:
Nathmull's is known for tea and that is what they serve in this joint. Sadly I am not a connoisseur of tea and will not make much comment here. The food menu, though small, interestingly comes in a gigantic sized menu cards (separate for beverages, Italian and continental). The tea prices are competitive. The food is OK and the prices are fairly high for the quality and quantity. We did not try the Italian menu. The menu card mentions that taxes will be added on the price but from the invoice it looks that the taxes are inclusive in the price.

Service:
I noticed that there were some reviews that complained of slow service. Being a newbie in a fiercely competitive space the management has taken it seriously. They strive to do the best and in that zest go hyperbole at times.

There is something that I had never heard from any cafe in Kolkata or elsewhere. If two persons visit the place and there is a space for four available, they tell the customer that they may shift to a two seater if there is a vacancy when four persons come over. They actually do it when that situation arrives. Whereas this helps them optimize the space for good business, to me it is outright insolence. 

Overall:
I may go back to taste their Italian menu. For those who enjoy tea with ta may find the joint interesting.

Located in golpark adjacent to "mouchak" towards south city college. The place has a vibrant sign board in green and yellow mostly like a tea store which although justifies the first section of the place which is developed for selling varieties of tea and coffee leaves. Inside you'll find a moderate sitting area accomodating around 50 people or so with a live jaming section for the audience. Decor of the place is nice with a good ambiance for a coffee shop.

FOOD
The Pork Platter - Although there was no response from the management regarding the speciality in this section so we had to pull our expertise for the selection. The platter was freshly prepared and the taste of the meat was fresh and not frozen. The only let down was with the pork fat which was saltly in taste.
3.5/5

Chicken Supremo Pizza - chopped chicken selections in every slice , evenly handled cheese spread and fresh vegetables had a good combination in a pizza. A decent choice for a pizza break.
4/5

HOSPITALITY
The overall behaviour of the staff was very polite and friendly but the let down was with the order delivery time. You will get a delay in every order.

Totally took me back to Darjeeling! Nathmulls & Keventers together, I was so happy to find this cost joint located in the midst of the hustle bustle of Golpark. The interiors are woody, the staff is super friendly and warm and the food was amazing! We had a great time with our Funghi pizza which was a thin crust and absolutely delicious! Will definitely become a regular at The Whistling Kettle!

Well after hearing really good reviews I thought to drop in. The ambience was impressive and attractive..so had a good thought about the place..until our food came out. The chicken sausage which we ordered tasted pathetic, so I informed a member of staff, to which she said.. the sausage is fat free..bla bla bla! No idea from which continent they are bringing such sausages.. whatever, she amazed us with her excuses. Nd if you are ordering for salami sandwich then definitely u have to go for a treasure hunt to find salami pieces in it. It felt as if the salamis were flattened by ironing.
Shocking food quality and vile, awful staff. I am pretty sure only the flies on the table would have enjoyed the meal.

Impressive decor... The boutique part is more attractive though. Cosy interior... We ordered pork platter chicken sausage exotic tea and tarts.. The pork platter was quite enough for two of us but the bacons were lacking crispiness.tea was awesome. Lemon tart was a bit more tangy for our taste. Overall a nice experience and the staff was highly cooperative

In love with the decor of this cosy nook....the pork platter is fantastic....also, the baked cheesy delights like Lasagne Al Ferno.
Among desserts, the chocolate delicacies are a must try....the shakes are refreshing.
For musicians, there's a corner for impromptu jigs too!!
The owner is extremely friendly and always around to ensure comfort and satisfaction for all her customers.

A must try for all meat lovers :)

Another new and happening cafe in the town.Near to Golpark Ccd  .the place is nice and not so over crowded and nicely decorated.One interesting thing is that they serve tea in wine or champagne glasses.The price is bit high.Like a slice of pineapple pastry would cost you almost 100 bucks.And the kiwi shake is awful.
Overall a nice place.

Just mind blowing overwhelming response in such a short period is a proof in itsef the quaity of food, tea etc. Ambience  is as if the Darjeeling hills have come to plains. Another attractive addition is the sale of different design of tea set, exotic Nathmulls Darjeeling tea packets and other stuffs.

Overall my first experience is fantabulous  and I feel like visiting the place more and more. It's  a very different concept comparing to other cafes in city.

Most important the prices are very affordabley and the service is upto the satisfaction point. Here it is important to mention the beautiful and cultured lady always in a smilind face is the owner who takes personal care of all the customers and tries to make the customers feel like home away home. Special mention to all the other staffs who are also always on their toes to fulfil the orders at the earliest. Needless to mention the smile on their face.

So my dear Cacuttans, please try to visit the place  once and experience the place and if satisfied..must share with your famiy and friends. Three Cheers...THE WHISTLING KETTLE

The house of "Nathmulls, (Darjeeling)" presents "Whistling Kettle" , a cafe where you can enjoy the brew from the hills and the brilliant pork and chicken platters.
The absolute or rather the must try is the "Vietnamese coffee"(ask for assistance they will prepare it for you.
Pork or Chicken platters. For anyone in love with pork this is the perfect platter (it reminded me of keventer's , Darjeeling).
The Pork jumbo sandwich is the house special. These double layered sandwich has fresh soft pork and is absolutely delicious.
Chicken Supreme Pizza, served with olive oil(infused with oregano) has the perfect crispy crust .
If you are a fan of Mediterranean food try Spaghetti Bolognese or Lasagne All Funo.
They also serve 2 varieties of white tea , which is a must try for tea lovers.
There are also a variety of first flush from different tea gardens.
The prices are reasonable and the ambiance is electrifying.
Disclaimer: Avoid weekends , and there is a rush and you might have to wait for your turn.
The cafe also has an in-house shop selling different types of teas and even tea pots, tea sets.

Completely in love with this place. The decor, ambience and the food - all are just perfect. We tried the meat platter and the bacon and egg sandwich along with chocolate tart and choco muffin for dessert. The meat platter just blew us off our feet. The sandwich was super yummy. And the dessert, just the perfect end to a happy meal. Going back soon again to try the pasta and pizza.

Quiet little place tucked away into a corner of goal park. Sort of like a tea museum where you will find various types of teas adorning the wall. The range and variety of teas that are being offered is mind blowing. It ranges across numerous countries and flavors. You can pick and choose a tea according to you mood and liking. You will definitely be happy about it. There is so much love and passion in this place. Food is at par with the ambience. We had pizza sandwich and the grt tea. Their interiors and their presentation is one of a kind. The crew was so sweet and kind that they left me with a note of thanks before I left. I would anytime like to go back there. It is an experience one should never miss.
Thanks to whistling kettle to make my evening so romantic.

[EDIT OF REVIEW ON THE BASIS OF THE SECOND VISIT ON 27/05]

On my second visit to this place i noticed that the place was full. This time i ordered pork jumbo sandwich , banana walnut cake and vietnamese coffee . The experience this time around was pleasant . Even though the place was full the service team including the owner were on their toes doing their best and with a smile on their face! kudos to them for that.....it is difficult to manage a full house with orders flowing here and there. The food came under 20 mins. The vietnamese coffee was lovely! It comes with a concoction of condensed milk and filter coffee and a glass full of ice. 

The pork jumbo sandwhich had a simple filings of cheese and bits of pork ham. The bread was perfectly grilled and the sandwich had a simple and classic taste to it . It did suit my palate. The banana and walnut cake was also nice and not too sweet , just that the banana flavor could be more.

Overall i am satisfied this time completely! many were still complaining around about the pricing. But for the ambiance and rent (if they dont own the place) of the place and location , its quite justified.... as its not fair to compare it to a joint right opposite which is just renowned in having chains of business and nothing else.

Perfection is an impossible task to do , but what matters is that more people leave your outlet with a  smile rather than complains , i sure dont have any more complains. I also request the people who have had a bad experience here to give them another chance!

Cheers!¬†

(the one below is my old review)
                        visited this place after hearing a lot of hype lately!
But super slow service and lack of staff present to address the people just ruined the experience.
The decor is very nice and service was polite and cordial. There were 4 tables occupied including mine and everyone were furious because of the delay in orders.
When asked we were told that we make everything from scratch so the taste and quality are different from others. So obviously the expectations from the food was also high.
It finally came after 45 minutes ....had ordered bacon , ham , salami, sausages and fried egg platter with aglio olio with prawns.
The food was disappointing .....the platter tasted like any frozen processed meat you get from stores or the frozen meat shops in park street or new market.
The sausages were not right....they tasted very sour from inside .....bacons were mostly fat and the salami were a bit burnt.
The aglio olio had too many things in it that diluted the flavour of the key ingredient that is garlic and prawns were not that fresh too.
Over all the prices are also very high , considering the quality of the food served especially the aglio olio which costed 385 rs !
I would still visit this place again as it might be an off day for them but according to me they should really take care of the timing of the food to be prepared.

The moment I entered the cafe the way they welcomed us pleased me a lot . The ambience , the d√©cor is appreciable. The service is the worst that I have experienced in all of the cafes that I have visited till date. Means I simply have to beg for a glass of water and after 30 long minutes when they did served it , gave only 1 glass when they were two of us sitting at the table . About the food we ordered coffee with ice cream , a margarita pizza and a omelette stuffed with Chicken . The ice cream was not at all visible in the coffee and rest of the food was not at all worth mentioning.

Always in a rush to try out different food joints took me to this cafe in golpark. I was actually very elated as I entered the place. The ambiance is awesome. This cafe gives a Darjeeling-like vibe instantly. The wooden ceiling and the pictures of the hills with the cozy wooden chairs instantly uplift your mood. There is a special music corner as well. 
Coming to the behaviour of the staff, I found it cordial.
Our plight began when we ordered the food. We ordered veg and cheese sandwich, baked spinach lasagne and cold chocolate shake because cold coffee with icecream (which we ordered initially) wasn't available. 
First came the chocolate shake. The chocolate shake tasted like water with a bit of ice sprinkled and added chocolate flavour. I couldn't even have the sedimented portion below because it was kinda sticky.
Then came the sandwich which I felt was still edible. 
The lasagne was a huge disappointment. Sitting there sipping leftovers of chocolate shake and enquiring about food every now and then made me bitter. Yet I thought that patience is required for a lipsmacking dish. What came near about 40 minutes later was something sticky and gooey. I literally convinced myself to eat the full plate because we would be paying. However the staff over there, a kind lady, tried to make it more edible by adding in some sort of spicy sauce. 
Giving the cafe a 3 rating because of the cordial behaviour of the staff and the decor.

This is new in town and I am totally in love with it. I actually wanted to order every single item on menu but sadly I couldnot !!! üòâ We ordered a pork platter which was absolutely awesome , very well cooked , a pork omlette which was great as well. But the showstopper was the Coffee on the Rocks ! The best part about the coffee is you brew it yourself infornt of you and on the bottom there is condensed milk which you need to mix once the coffee is totally filtered ! This coffee is heaven üëå A must try for all coffee lovers ! A great place,great ambience , good service ! Looking forward to visit many more times and try their variety of tea and other excellent items on the menu !! üòä

This place is so nice! Their meat platter, meat for which is sourced from the famous Keventer's , was so good! They also host occasional live music sessions which makes the place all the more nice. They also have a nice range of tea cups and kettles on sale.

Pocket pinch: A meat platter, a bottle of water with two iced teas set us back by around 725 bucks. Worth it, pretty much :)

A fine tea room in the city.

Located conveniently in one of the by lanes of Golpark - easily found, but parking maybe a problem because of the width of the lane. Looks bright and welcoming, with a tea counter in the front room and a shelf full of beautiful kettles, cups and saucers and varied kinds of tea for sale. Behind this room is a larger room for seating purposes, with a small area for live music gigs as well. Decor is perfect, aiming to remind you of sitting in a wooden tiled cafe in some hill station.

Menu cards are massive - since the space is smallish, it often becomes a nuisance to handle. Staff is excellent, especially because the owner personally takes orders, moves around greeting everyone and suggesting menu items.

Coming to the tea first - there is a pretty varied selection of excellent tea, ranging from 45 rupees a cup for Hot Lemon Tea to 400 rupees a cup for Nathmull's Rarest of the Rare. We had, between us, Ice Magic (iced black tea), Hot Lemon Tea, Nathmull's Exotic and Mint Herbal Tea, served in broad rimmed wine glasses, no less. Each were exquisite, there is no compromise in the quality they offer.

For food, we first had chicken stuffed omelette, which was wonderful. Their menu, I read, is sourced from Keventers Darjeeling. The chicken and ham sandwich was comparatively ordinary, though. Lemon tart was pretty good too.

Wonder why their Venetian coffee, which is iced coffee on the rocks, which takes specially long time to brew, is not there in the physical menu, only in the Zomato menu. We would have gone for it for sure if we had known about it, we only got to know about it because someone in the adjoining table ordered it.

In all, a lovely experience.
Maybe extension of space should be considered in the future?

One lazy non-working afternoon took us to this much heard-of place opposite CCD Golpark. There was a feeling of instant liking the moment we entered. The frontal portion of the restaurant is a tea boutique where one gets to purchase various flavours of tea apart from varieties of teapots etc. The restaurant portion is brightly lit with cosy sitting arrangements. There is also a counter with confectioneries on display. We were very hungry and our love of pork took us to order the pork platter along with vanilla shake, strawberry shake and iced tea. The meat is apparently from famed Keventers. While I loved the ham, salami and sausages, the bacon I found to be too salty for my tastebuds. Also, I am sure I have tasted far better quality of bacon at quite a few humbler places in the city. We thereafter ordered a brownie for dessert which was pretty okay. One problem with the place was while we found all nine tables occupied, there was only one server going around the entire place and taking orders. While he was very polite and pleasant, the sheer number of orders pouring in from different tables was enough to get him all confused. I feel the place would immediately need to rise up to occasions like this and have a few more servers in waiting. Overall a pretty good experience. Thanks to the owners for giving us a slice of Keventers in Kolkata, that too in this heat.

The Whistling Kettle, their area of specialization being tea, is located at the heart of Golpark.(opposite CCD beside Mouchak). 

Now there are two sections here: the first section is devoted to tea and its accessories where you can purchase them; the second section being the eatery one with an arrangement of live perfomance. The ambiance is lovely. A small bakery section is available at the end of the eatery section where you could go and choose what you want.

I went there for breakfast with my friend. We had chocolate shake and chicken salami sandwich(grilled). Loved the sandwich and chocolate shake. Quality and quantity was good. My friend too loved it.  Though i felt that the price of the chocolate shake was bit high comparing the quality of shake. Its still inclusive of taxes.

Coming to the service, it was great. The owner was very courteous and had a smiling face throughout our conversation with him.

Tea lovers can give a visit to this place.I'll soon visit this place for the dessert and tea.

Location - Opposite to Golpark Ccd.

Ideally, you should be able to enjoy your cuppa in a quiet place, with the company of your closest ones. However, our expectations of an "exotic" Nathmulls journey shattered when a large group of ladies seated right next to us filled the place with their high pitched laughter, loud speeches (that's right, some of them were reading out certain notes to the rest of the group) and unbearably noisy conversations.

Food - The Cheese Garlic bread had raw garlic pieces on it. Tasted bad. The Pasta with spinach was average. The dessert (Chocolate tart) was decent. The Marble cake lacked the sponginess.

Nathmulls tea was the saving grace!

Portion - Could be better.

Price - Considering the quality and quantity of the food, I would say the price is on the higher side.

Service - Good. We could see their efforts to make the guests happy.

My friend came from Bangalore and we suddenly decided to meet This store called "The Whistling Kettle" has opened newly near my place and we both wanted to try it.
Location- Take the lane of Mouchak at Golpark and this place is just opposite to golpark cafe coffee day. This place was previously Hallmark gift store which turned into a cafe. Nathmulls and Keventers joint venture from Darjeeling made this place a mini Darjeeling inside.
Ambiance- When you enter here you won't really feel there's a cafe inside of decent size. The first half of the store sells tea from nathmulls which has huge varieties of tea and tea pots. Inside there is a cafe which is moderately lit and very nicely decorated.
Food Ordered- Ice tea which met our expectation . Chicken sausage fried which was usual . The pork salami with egg was a absolute delight and I strongly recommend it!
Quantity and Quality- Food quantity and quality was okay according to the price.
Service - Service was excellent! They take care of each and every customer personally which I absolutely loved 
Special Attraction- There is an area where you can play guitar üé∏ and entertain the guests else you can enjoy it on your own also. We were lucky to have a musician among us who entertained us with his music.
This will be a permanent destination of mine being a place near my home with excellent quality food having a soothing environment.

Could you please pause for a while and take a deep breath which will take you back to the nostalgic serenity of Darjeeling. 
Voila you've reached The Whistling Kettle. 
(Btw its just beside mouchak in golpark, bang opposite to ccd as well) 
As soon as you enter, there is a little cutlery and teapot store for sale.. pretty pretty! 
Exotic and soothing interior. With a jamming area, backdropping it are frames of old school music legends and bands. 
Also frames of tea, Darjeeling and music adorns the entire place.
There is a bakery counter at one end. 
Comfortable cozy seating arrangements. 

Food and drinks ordered:- 
 Nathmulls ice tea :- absolute peaceful and refreshing in this weather. Served in pretty bottles and even prettier straws.
Fried bacon :- this is love and heaven on a plate. Perfectly crispy fried, generously served. 
Chicken supremo pizza :- serves 8slices . Thin crust pizzas, topped with fresh olives , chicken chunks, onions, cheese, peppers mushrooms tomatoes.
Additional Italian seasoning and olive oil is provided alongside. (More than enough for 2)  

The owner was very friendly , helps you if you need to know anything and socialised with all his customers. 
This is now my anytime go to place! 
Lovely experience. Looking forward to more :D

Love for White Tea and that also from Nathmull's was the main reason I decided to check this place out.The newest joint in and around Gariahat-Golpark-Lake Area.The decor is subtle and menu commendable.Being a vegetarian the options are always limited but I have no complaints.Being a newly setup joint they were a bit on the slower side as far as service time was concerned.But that can always be ignored. Overall a nice place to just sit and enjoy one's tea and assorted meat platter from the iconic Kev's in Darjeeling.

Darjeeling has been the single most favored holiday destination for Bengalis, across generations. And one place has been the Mecca for tea lovers ‚Äì Nathmull‚Äôs in Darjeeling. So what happens when in the newspaper , we read that the Nathmull‚Äôs current owners have opened a tea boutique, right in the heart of the city?

The Whistling Kettle‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the place. Right next to the lane of Mouchak near Golpark, this cute little tea boutique serves the world of Nathmull‚Äôs along with‚Ä¶. the famed Keventers breakfast menu!

FINALLY !!! Got my hands, or should I say, my fork and knife, on the much talked about Keventers Pork breakfast, at "The Whistling Kettle".. a small cozy place, in the bustling Gol Park area.. the decor and the "pahari" music playing in the background does make you feel a bit like you are sitting in a small cafe in the Hills.. as far as the Pork platter is concerned, the salami, I felt was quite bland.. but, that could also be because the Ham, Bacon and Sausages were full of flavour.. then again, that's just my opinion.. this place is a must try !!!

Now coming to food, they have exotic tea range and  We ordered a Chicken and ham salami grilled sandwich, Pork & Ham fried,  Iced coffee in milk base (I couldn't remember the proper name though) Nathmulla's exotic green tea..  And all the foods were nice..... 
Last but not the least in the retail corner they have lovely collections of tea and cutlery... Over all we love this place and will revisit again in the near Future...

Lovely place, ¬†the dainty little display of tea-sets bringing in the Nathmull's vibes from Darjeeling. ¬†The inner decor is cosy, though could be a little cramped during rush hours. Loved the tea and the food- we had a plate of fried pork sausages and eggs, and the risotto scampi and both of them were perfect. Quantity was good too, as three of us shared the food and was quite full by the end. I liked the music which enhanced the Darjeeling charm.
Was slightly disappointed by the patisserie display- expected a little more variety.
Location-wise, it's perfect, and we do need more teahouses in the city to keep up with the cafes. Would love to go back.

The ambience is perfect for a cafe within budget. Service and food quality is very good. However, one of the biggest drawback is payment mode, in a digital cashless society, towards which we are heading, they don't have any digital mode for payment. Second is that when they are serving foods like sausages or salami, they must give a knife with it. A customer must not ask for that. Else the staff behavior is fantastic so overall a good experience.

Visited  the cafe on Sunday,  30th April. 

We went there with lot of expectations but came out totally dissapointed.  I was there with my Dad,  daughter and husband. 

It started with the waiting period before getting into the cafe.  After waiting for more than 30 mins,  finally we get a table.  We ordered for a chicken platter,  2 types of sandwiches and 2 milkshakes. 

The milkshakes were served after 15 mins.  After that the test of our patience started.  We kept  on asking for the food and everytime was told " just 2 mins ma'am ". There was another family  sitting next to us,  they were also complaining of the similar situation. 

After waiting for 45 mins,  we had to leave the place without any food as there were other commitments for the day. 

I understand that it's a new place and there are lot of teething problems . I appreciate all the efforts they are taking to cater to the customers.  For that reason all this while we were waiting with a smiling face.  But they should have also understood and appreciated the fact that guests have other commitments too,  they have value of their time. 

Wish this cafe to overcome all these start up issues at the earliest and emerge as a destination where guests can relax and enjoy in stead of getting disappointed on their very first visit.

We had went for breakfast after t2 review and were there by 8:30. They were still in process of opening store. Everyone was gracious and the food was really nice. We ordered vanilla shake which was slightly disappointing but iced tea and Vietnamese coffee were really awesome. In food we had sandwiches and pork and chicken sausages which was one of the best we had. It was a great experience and would love to visit next time. Would like to give then benefit of doubt as they are still relatively new to the business and maybe that's why taking long to serve customers in peak time. For us they took just 15 mins to serve which is pretty decent. Would recommend them to keep a breakfast platter option with all the components in it to make it easier to choose. :) Cheers for great place and may you succeed in your venture.

The worst experience ever. Beverages which we were told would be served immediately came after half hour. Thats just the beginning. Food was served after nearly 1hr 20mins. By that time, one out of five of us had already left as he had some engagements. Guests on other tables also started leaving. Mango shake had bits of plastics in it. So did the chocolate tart, both of which was unfortunately ordered by a 8 yr old kid. Even the fried meat platter served finally was too oily and excessively salty. We had gone there with a lot of expectations seeing the newspaper review but seems no one was prepared to take in customers. Wanted to have a late breakfast but ended up having a very late lunch. Dissappointing.

Finally a proper Tea Cafe serving the best selections from Darjeeling. Pricing is sweet and i do hope the management sustains the same for a longer period. Very nice breakfast options aka Keventers style. Excellent staff hospitality. The front portion of the Cafe is a walk through boutique disolayimg a wide range of tea accessories and tea itself. One stop shop for the kolkata tea connoisseur's.

Loved the place.

A fab place.Mix of Nathmulls and Kaventers. Its a slice of Darjeeling in Kolkata. Super ambience and great hosts. Great food (we tried the Pork Jambo Sandwich,the chicken jambo sandwich,the famous meat platters and baked pasta)and the rejuvenating Nathmulls tea....what else to ask for! Sitting capacity being limited,if you are in a group of 8 or more,you may need to wait for a table. Will revisit for sure!

Very unorganized in terms of waiting and tables. The service is extremely slow. Guests from 3 tables walked out in front of us, tired of waiting for food. Food took 1.5 hours to come, and they forgot most of the order. 
Overall really bad experience.

Beautiful interiors. Nice old school music. Cheerful staff. Innovative drinks. Vietnamese coffee on the rocks was good. Kiwi crush treated like a bubblegum. Pork platter had a tad bit more salt. All in all a pleasant experience.

Popped in today after going through the write up on them in today's T2. My first impression was WOW... what lovely interiors & lovely hosts. There's even a Guitar zone where one can play a little jive. Since it was scorching outside we chose Nathmulla's Iced Magic which is their only Iced Tea. It was very very refreshing. We also ordered Grilled Chicken Salami Sandwich & Grilled Egg Sandwich which were tasty as well. But we felt that serving the Sandwiches took quite some time. They also have a retail section for Tea cutlery which is awesome...... Will revisit again in the near future....

When you love your morning cup of tea as much as I do , then this place is a must visit. Situated in the lane beside Mouchak , Jodhpur Park . This place has finally brought to kolkata the wonderful meat platters of #Keventers and the #Nathmulls tea estate of Darjeeling . They serve breakfast all day so no worries , drop in any time . And...  the tea is served in goblets and champagne flutes !!!! One of the best black teas I've had in kolkata and trust me being a tea fanatic , I've been to every place you know searching for the perfect cuppa !!

Lovely new place to spend time with your friends and family. Very neat and clean and great music. Went there today for breakfast and it reminded us of Keventers Darjeeling. Pork platter is excellent and so is the tea. They also have an Italian food selection . Only drawback at present is that they do not accept cards. Will definitely go back.

"Tea " is  not just tea  at this sophisticated outlet. You walk into this shop right in busy hub of South kolkata and the retro English music charms you  and teams up with the  vintage pictures of our favourite hill station  to instantly warm you.  Then comes THE CHOICE OF TEA . If you ever been to Darjeeling then NATHMULS is not an unfamiliar name. What more can it be when you get the same variety of fermented and unfermented tea directly from your favourite tea shop at the hills.  For those  who don't know "TEA" is just not served here, you experience tea  . You must visit it if you  just love  tea served in its best and unaldutered form. If you are a coffee addict experience what the proprietors call "coffee on rocks " , you will find yourself  just loving the conviction of filter coffee served with a difference. Summer chillers like milkshakes are on the menu. You will enjoy all the exotic drinks with a lip smacking breakfast from Keventers and also do try out the pasta and pizza.  Moreover they also have a place for live music and wifi. So it's a ideal place to gather  with your friends/ family and make memories while enjoying  good ambience and food. This place is kid freindly also.

Where will you get a Vietnamese coffee to be made on the table so that you can go through the whole process how the lukewarm water is poured on crushed coffee beans and it drops on the thick condensed milk below! Be ready for a full and heavy pork platter that has beacons, salami, hams and yummy pork tenders served with sunny side ups! Breakfasts are sourced from Keventers Darjeeling and while you gorge all that good things. Do not forget to sip the refreshing brews from the hills. Sources directly from Nathmulls, tea variants are diverse. Fermented, semi fermented all sorts of teas are available, Luxe and elixir to an otherwise mundane evening. They serve teas in wine glasses just to match the quality. The quaint cafe has live music arrangement too, you can test your hands on the guitar kept there. Wooden furnishings, cane finished hanging lamps and a menu that boasts with premium teas, English breakfast and Italian cuisines. What else do you need to have a beautiful start to a day or charming evenings. The Whistling Kettle "teas" you well. Atreya Paul

Whistle kettle had unearthed a very big myth for me in my head that it's only good for tea but when me and my lady love went here we saw a vast menu with a vide variety of some mouth watering food !!

after going throughly through the menu we decided to order for Pizza and carbonara was the best option we could choose for !! Serving size is good for two people and it's simple yet classy !! food was amazingly delicious.
Ambience is pretty good and so is the staff and the service was quite fast ¬†
Interiors are very well done and bright with plenty of tables and a good big tea accessories section. Thanks to shiny for giving knowledge about tea!! 

This place gets a big nod from me and everyone must try this without fail !!

The whistling kettle is sure a hidden gem for tea lover . I was absolutely surprised when I walked into this cafe to see how cute it looks and how cozy it is done up. 

We had pizza, salami sandwich and tea, impress ¬†!!The owner, was around and ensured we had all we needed to enjoy our meal. We were told he is in the cafe most of the time to give it a personal touch . The staff are friendly, cordial and helpful too. They got some nice tea accessories and the lady standing next to accessories is too good, she knows how to describe things.

I would definitely recommend visiting this chilled out place with friends for the quick munching and refreshing tea in the evening. . Happy tummy = Happy Me . I am sure going back here soon.

Before writing a review for this cafe.. I would like to take some time and talk about its super sophisticated and classy interior. Absolutely loved the place.
Yes! So this cafe is located beside mouchak in golpark and is just opposite to the ccd.

We went there at around 6 and it was empty, only 1 table was occupied.
My main reason to visit this cafe was for its exotic tea range. Oh! And they even have a tea and cutlery counter. We met the owner, and the staffs and all were very warm and greeted us..
Now, coming to the food.
We ordered1) VANILLA SHAKE
2) STRAWBERRY SHAKE and
1) LASAGNE AL FERNO
We wanted the mango shake but as it was unavailable so we had to order the strawberry one.
The strawberry shake was pretty fresh, tasty, refreshing as well as filling.
Well, the vanilla shake was a little disappointing.. There were too many ice inside it which made it freeze. And last but not the least the lasagne was lip smacking.. It was delicious, cheesy and beautifully baked!
Well, overall i had an amazing experience.. We had a great time. I am definitely revisiting this place for their tea and breakfasts and would highly recommend this place.
And yaay for free wifiüôå

It was a sheer delight to be at a place which serves you, your favourite tea. Directly sourced from Nathmulls, while sipping on the cup of Nathmulls exotic, I just felt a bit closer to the hills.
Located in the heart of Golpark near Mouchak, it's cozy little place where you'd want to sit and enjoy every bit of your time. Along with the tea, we also had Lasagne el ferno and that was equally lip smacking. 
Overall, my friend and I had a lovely time at The Whistling Kettle. Cheers to team! :)
