Best place for indian chinese in Howrah ! A combination of both quality and quantity is a rare but this pocket friendly and squeezed out food joint caters to both ... i would recommend pan fried noodles , you must also try chicken / paneer in hot garlic gravy.

Best Chinese Restaurant in Salkia without a doubt. Quality has declined a bit for the past couple of years but still quite good. Recommended.

The best Chinese restaurant at Salkia. It's very popular for its food quality. I strongly recommend that we the food lovers should be able to order via Zomato. The restaurant though small but a good joint for Chinese lovers.

Tried a hell lot of dishes out here, the best chinese joint in salkia. Im really a huge fan of the food quality out here. The restaurant is small but u can easily manage to get a seat in weekdays with ur group, weekends are a little hectic &dont even try to go there during festive season, untill n unless u have an hour in ur hand, may b more than that. But yeah the food will alwys worth the wait. I wanna suggest the 'drums of heaven' for starter. Its really my fav dish and for main course, order watevr u like, every dish is nicely made and taste good. Cnt give it a 5star due to lack of an AC, sometimes its really suffocating when get congested.

It is undoubtedly one of the oldest & best Chinese joints in Salkia rather Howrah located at very conveniently near the chowrasta crossing a tad inside a lane easily noticeable from the main road.
Its a small place , note a non Ac one , definitely not a place for dates but if you love Chinese cuisine Kolkata style this is the only place for you & that to in a bugdet .
Portions r large quality is good flavours r nice each & every dish has there own texture n taste.
I have been a loyalist for a long time now.
Generally i bring parcel to home .
On any busy day one will find it difficult to get a table its such busy a joint with minimal ambience , here its only about good food.
