Went there with my friend there a couple of days back..my friend had some money in dineout which he had to use as its expiry date was nearing...so we decide to go here...but somehow due to change in policy of dineout...they said they could not accept money from dineout at that time...Now we didn't have much cash and were kind of relying on the dineout money to try out some dishes...But their staff was courteous enough to understand our problem...they offered us two conplimentary coffees...it was lovely..
We tried out Pineapple flavoured Baked Rosogolla and it was okayish...would visit this place surely sometime after to try out other things...:)

They take pride in their Bengali cuisine and i guess they should. The continental food is okay for a change in platter, but not something great.

What this place lacks is in it's organizational capabilities. Forgetting orders, forgetting instructions, a long waiting time, undercooked food and they had even forgotten to bill an amount once. 

The food is great and almost pocket friendly, however there's some work required in order to be a fine dining.

Ordered food to delivered home on 2 occasions now.
 
The first time,Mutton Dak Bunglow had been ordered.
There were 4 pieces in a serving,all the pieces were decent. Instead of the whole boiled egg,they serve their Dak Bunglow with scrambled eggs in the gravy. Only disappointing thing about the dish was that the gravy was too salty.

The second time,we ordered Biriyani and Chaap. The Biriyani isn't the traditional Calcutta Biriyani. The rice was dry as well.
The Chaap was delicious. The gravy was thick and not too oily. Left me wanting more of that.

The place is in Jodhpur park with well seating arrangement. We have tried Chinese, Bengali as well as Mughlai cuisines. Biryani was good and low on oil but the potato was undercooked. The noodles were good in taste but bit less salt would have been better. The fish manchurian and chicken daakbanglow was very well cooked. The pulao was wonderful. The crispy chilli baby corn and crispy conjee chicken tasted good with lime and coriander soup. The service was a bit slow and we had to ask them to serve. But overall a nice experience.

If you're bored of the quintessential Bengali food eateries, such as Tero Parbon and Bhojohori Manna (and can't keep up with their ever increasing prices!), Lokahaar can be a refreshing change. Located in the convoluted lanes of Jodhpur Park (bang opposite the lane to Blue Mug), this aristocratic house-turned-into-restaurant has cozy indoors and is definitely pocket friendly. I've only tried their Bengali cuisine (although they do serve North Indian and Continental) and I suggest you do the same, since that is what they are known for.
If you're bored of the basic white rice, you can always try their mishti pulao with generous servings of raisins and cashews (a personal favorite). I had their cholaar daal, mutton kosha, chicken daakbungalow, shorshey illish. All of the dishes were deliciously cooked. One dish that hit home, was the doi katla. The sharp flavor of tok doi seemed to enhance the falvour of the fish. Honestly, one of my favourite dishes of the evening. The chitol maacher muitha though, was a bit of a let down. The fish had a stench to it and the curry was overtly tangy,
The staff is friendly, albeit not professionally trained but that didn't hinder much with the service.  Overall, a good experience!
Thanks for reading. Do comment your queries/constructive criticism. Hope you have a great day, with great food!

Lokaahar is a cozy multicuisine restaurant known primarily for their Bengali cuisine, but also serves Continental, Chinese, Thai, North Indian/Mughlai cuisines. It has been awarded Restaurant of the Year by Times Food Awards 2017 which has not only added a feather to their cap but also popularised their dishes which are no doubt rightly delicious in their own unique way.
The interior has a calm cool ambiance, with simplistic decor decked with handcrafted chairs and patta painting on walls.
The behaviour of our server was absolutely praiseworthy, most polite and gracious.
We lunched here one sunny afternoon on Steamed Basmati rice, Narkel Moong Dal, Jhooro Aloo Bhaja, Bhetki Bora, Dhokar Dalna and Chapor Ghonto.
Most of the items were fresh and tasted like mother's home-cooked food, imparting the taste of "ghoroa bangali ranna." The Dhoka was good but the Dalna I felt could have been made tad better.
Overall a wholesome appetising Bengali meal kept us satisfied at Lokaahar. Maybe next time would like to try some other great dishes they have to offer. :)

After roaming around jodhpur park had a quick aahar at lokaahar. It's located opposite to cafe Blue mug.
As soon as we entered, we wered welcomed by homely ambiance. It was simple but cosy and comfortable inside. We sat and ordered doi katla, moong dal, jhoori alu bhaja, basmati rice, basanti pulao & mutton kasha. Food came within half an hour. Quality of food was pretty decent, the service was good and we were satisfied.
So, it's a good homelike place to have homelike bengali food at reasonable price.

I have ordered home delivery and the great thing with this restaurant is that they customise the food if you cannot have spicy and that for me is a huge plus.
In a city like Kolkata..finding authentic Bengali home style food and to suit one's palate is truly a gem. 
Thank you so much!

This is located in jodhpur park just opposite to blue mug cafe..went here to have nabami lunch with a friend..they were having puja special menu..due to huge rush of their online delivery(as they claimed) we had to wait almost an hour for our food to arrive..though they had Bengali dishes,we opted for the Continental menu and tried chicken steak with mushroom sauce and fish in lemon butter sauce..the chicken dish was served with spaghetti which had cheese on top of it and two large pieces of chicken..it tasted good..the fish was served with herb rice and had lemon butter sauce on it..this dish also tasted good..neither of the dishes tasted extraordinary..one can give a visit to this place..

It's tucked in the lanes of Jodhpur Park and hard to spot. This place leaves me perplexed. The decor is traditional and good but it doesn't go with a place serving Italian and Continental. It just doesn't give you the feel. However, I tried Bengali cuisine and it was decent. Mutton Kasha and Ilish was good. Yellow Pulao was ok! The Dal had too much salt.
I think the owners are trying to do too much with the place by serving all types of cuisine. I would advise them to get a grip and train the waiters properly. They messed up with the orders of mine and others around.

P.S. - I was surprised to see a computer in the washroom-turned-office.

While starving after a hectic pandel hopping session we decided to give this place a try. 
This place is little bit hard to locate if you are not familiar with this area. 
We were waiting for more than 1hr..for our turn. Now the main thing.. The Food , it is just great. We have tried the bengali cuisine. We are more than impressed with the taste of food. 
Service is ok. But regarding the puja time its totally fine.
Only one thing i really dont like is that sometimes the staff reacts very strangely. I really like to mention is that midway between having our meal we felt that we need to order more to fill our hungry tummys. When we told the staff about our further order he became irritated and told us that we should have orderd all things at 1st time nd all that . Which we did not like at all. 
Beside that overall experience is pretty nice.

It was so not our first time dining out during Durga Pujo, and we have had better service during that rush hour.
So we visited this place on Saptami probably around the evening and were really happy to see empty tables as we were expecting to wait for a table for 4. So we took our seat, placed our order from the festive menu- chicken lasagna, chicken wings, mixed fried rice & Chilli prawn. Now we are aware that lasagna takes a long time to cook, but given that there were literally empty tables, we weren't expecting to wait almost an hour for our starter to appear. After waiting for what felt like forever, our orders appeared all together, and that's when we realized there were no spoons and forks on our tables. We asked for spoons and forks and waited another 5-10 minutes for just our forks to appear. Since there were no serving cutlery provided we asked for spoons and another 5-10 minutes. While placing the order we asked them about the quantity as we are aware that most restaurants switch to smaller quantity during festive season and they said that the rice and lasagna were good for two people. Once they arrived, it seemed the lasagna and the rice (individually) wasn't enough for a single person, so i looked up the menu for something that cooks fast and ordered gravy noodles. Which appeared considerably faster, 20 minutes or probably even less.
Now coming to the food part, everything we ordered were finger licking good. Like I previously mentioned, this wasn't the first time we dined out during puja, it was probably the tastiest food we tasted during puja.
Yes, the service was a bit disappointing, I didn't mind the waiting for food part, but I did mind the waiting for cutlery part as there's nothing worse than having food in front of you and no cutlery to eat with. But if they can serve food that tasty during that rush hour, I'm really eager to taste there food when the festive season is over (and I can order from the original menu)

Went here via dineout reservation. The manager refused to give the 10% discount which I should have got for dineout booking. Serving time is way too long. They charge 50 for a small glass of soft drink which is ridiculous. The only good part was the quality pf the food. Everything else was pathetic!!

Heard a lot about this restaurant. And as per knowledge it was a purely Bengali restaurant at that time. But now it has developed it other cuisine also like chinies, muglai.

This was on the ostami of Durga Puja and we were around Jodhpur Park and were pretty hungry. So, decided to give a visit there.

Location:
__________

It was very near to jodhpur park. 5 mins walking distance. We were also not totally sure about the exact location so blindly followed the Google map and we were right there.

Decoration:
_____________

It was on a 1st floor of the building. Very simple homely type feeling you would get. As they did not tried to put it in a restaurant way. Simple home type deco was there with Bengali and baul music at the back. And yes one portion of the restaurant having different hand made thing of Bangla showcased.

Food:
__________

The place is a bit full, as you know it was on durgapuja. So, had to wait a bit to get a table. But yes the hospitality was quite good.

On the Astami we decided to go for Bengali food.

✓ Beguni : in one plate it comes with two pieces. It was very oily. I am a die heart fan of beguni. But did not like it at all.
✓ Cholar Dal : It was very good, going excellent with luchi.
✓ Luchi : nothing to mention much. It served just out of the pan. Served hot. We took it 3 plates, each plate having 4 pieces.
✓ Polao : it was the yellow polao. Pretty nice. With kaju and kismis.
✓ Mutton Dukbanglo : it was a pure disappointment. Had a lot of expectation from this. But it did not taste good. Salt was also a bit less I felt. One plate having four pieces, we took two plates of it.
✓ Chingri Malaikari : it was okay type. Not that good.
✓ Chitol Mach er Muithya - this was just excellent. Superb one. The taste and quality bus just bang on. Each plate having four pieces and we took 2 plates.

We ended our meal with a sweet note, that is chatni.

✓ Pineapple Chatni : excellent one. We took it 4 times.

So, a mix experience. Actually had a lot of expectation. Few dishes are standout, few are don't.

All that cost 1850 for 4 heads.

I wish to visit the outlet once though in the non Puja time. Because things got a bit messy in Puja.

Anyway a Very happy Puja to all and happy fooding.

Service team should given a prize for forgetting order every 5 minutes as placed.  Thought of having a  soft drinks before meal which they served after meal.  I didn't  want to rate them a single star but to be honest the food was OK..

Quick tip: please Place your orders 24 hours prior because the food will never reach on time. Extremely callous attitude of the delivery staff, they never seem to find the house and don't bother calling and confirming the location. ' all in good time ' is the motto of this place.
The only reason I decided to give this place a second try was the quality of food.
But this place is a complete no no. It's a complete waste of your money.

Being an avid lover of bengali food, this was one place I had to go as soon as I had heard about it from t2 telegraph. It's truly a hidden gem as it is located within the interiors of Jodhpur park, very close to Blue Mug Cafe. The exteriors looked very simple and old world, giving it a very vintage feel to the visitors.
The interiors were also very well done up by displaying photos and art work of the respective culture. Hence, overall ambiance was quite good.
Now coming to the food, the choices were quite elaborate on the menu. 
Our order consisted of Chingari malai curry, Bhetki paturi, Mutton dak bungalow, topse matcher bhaja. Along with all of this were rice and luchi. I must say the food was totally worth it. The authenticity and taste were just outstanding. The waiting time plus lack of staff were the only reasons why the service aspect of this place let me down. But otherwise, I would really recommend this place to people in search of good Bengali food.

We visited this place (jodhpur park outlet) a few days ago. I should say this  place is a "must go"  for all bengali food lovers out there. Added to the delicacies, is its interior decoration,which is absolutely amazing. 

We ordered steamed rice, narkel diye moong dal, jhuro alu bhaja, mocha chingri, kosha mangsho. Each and every item were fresh, very authentic, and a sheer delight to your taste buds. The kosha mangsho is sure to remind you of our favourite grandmother's recipes & flavours. 
The price is the icing on top. Totally pocket friendly affordable prices.
Looking forward to further visits.  ☺️

I ordered veg Potol dorma, Daalna and plain Roti. Delivery took a bit longer time but the food was real good taste wise as they claim all the foods are feshly prepared and that's true indeed.  All in all, it is a hidden gem in South Kolkata having the authentic Bengali flavor .

Simple bengali style decor with interesting chairs. The menu includes bengali cuisine and a new continental section. The prawn cocktail was simple but the cheese balls were really tasty. Didn't quite liked the gandharaj lebu diye gholer sarbat. It was rather a simple gholer sarbat. The luchis were perfect and so was the jhuri alu bhaja. But the chholar daal although tasty was full of oil. We had expected the chicken duckbunglow to be authentic with a wholeboiled egg in it. But lokaahar uses scrambled egg. All in all a good experience but could have been better. The staff especially the manager need special mention as they were very courteous and helpful. By the way, the place will not burn a hole in your pocket.

Both of us bunked office today, and as always was too lazy to cook. So to satisfy our machh-bhaat craving ended up in this joint which we was featuring as "Newly Opened" in Zomato for quite some time.

The very entrance will make you feel like you're entering not a restaurant, but someone's home. A small verandah, featuring a large alpana, giving way to a comfortable old cane sofa, leading to a nice old fashioned wooden door. Inside, the walls are painted with traditional Bengali motifs, a la Shanti Niketan. It seats around 50-60 heads, and one of the three rooms double up as a store of handicraft items. Tables and chairs are also true to the theme, made of jute fibers, and wooden table legs carved with figures and figurines. 

The owners take pride in the fact that none of the menu items are pre-prepared, in their effort to serve as authentic and fresh food as possible. "Even the spices are freshly ground," he beamed. While that is a laudable effort, it is not a very happy prospect for starved customers waiting for food. One also wonders how they would manage to maintain this USP when the place is more crowded. In fact, the speed of service is about the only thing responsible for the deduction of 0.5 points from the total rating. Because the food, in short, was outstanding!

We ordered the Ilish Thaali, Aam Kasundi Bhetki, Narkel Bora and Shukto. The Ilish Thaali comprises Rice, Mug Daal, Jhuri Alu Bhaja, any choice of vegetables (we chose Chhanar Dalna), Shorshe Ilish, Chatni, Papor Bhaja and Mishti Doi, and is priced at a reasonable 550/-, considering the amazing taste of each item, especially the size and quality of the Ilish (and we Bengalis can be very sensitive about taste of Ilish machh). Shukto was amazing, I cannot remember the last non home made shukto that I had which was so much to my taste. Narkel Bora was slightly more deep fried than I prefer (probably should have considered soaking off the oil a bit before serving), but tastewise no complaints. The Aam Kashundi Bhetki, though, will reserve a special place in my culinary wall of fame. Just the right blend of kaacha aam and jhaal kashundi, and genuine fresh Kolkata Bhetki - Amazing!!

The owner came and personally chatted with each of us - came to know they serve breakfast as well, and have just started their continental section from today. They home deliver too - free for the first 2kms, and chargeable hence to a reasonable distance. I plan to come back to this place as soon as some of my non resident Bangali friends are in town. As for others, please try this out. Highly recommended!

Been to this place twice. Ordered kosha maangsho, bhetki paturi, luchi, porotha, cholar daal, chingri Masala. Nice ambience and very friendly staff. I would say though that the mutton was absolutely undercooked on the first occasion and on the second, it was slight quite tough to chew. The rest of the items were delicious but service has been slow on both occasions. Price is also quite reasonable so I would say go with time in hand if you want tasty Bengali food.

After finishing work before time we visited yesterday here for lunch .We arrived at around 2:10 .It was empty then (so far we could see ) so service was not very slow. The food was in table by 2:30 pm. As they demanded they prepare food instantly after taking the order which is good. The decoration is really nice. Ambience is also very good ,calm with soothing Rabindra sangeet. Coming straight to food. We ordered Veg Thali ,Narkel er bora,Mourola r jhal , Mourola r tok ,Mutton dak bunglow. The thali contains plain rice+plain mug dal+jhuro alu bhaja+two veg curry (we choose chanar dalna & potol er dolma)+khejur tomato r chatni+papad+rosogolla.Test wise all are good but Narkel Bora ,potol er dolma ,Mourolar jhal and Mutton duck banglow deserves special mention. Taste is more homely like ancient days.Only it has two drawbacks one is it's position (really difficult to find out ) and the second one is the quantity of food (one plate can't take by two) .The plus point is all the prices are inclusive tax so no extra charge is needed. SO the conclusion is if you really want to try some good taste of Bengali food made by grandma, being pocket friendly surely try it once .

I visited this food joint yesterday with my friends and its been a worthwhile exploration. The restaurant serves an authentic variety of the most sapid culinaries of traditional Bengal. We had Basanti polao, Chicken bon bungalow and Chicken dak bungalow. Each of the dishes not only stood but excelled our expectations with a delectable flavour. The Chicken bon bungalow calls for a special mention because it widely arrested our savour. The menu offers with enough of options for the vegetarians as well. Coming to the atmosphere, it was congenial,keeping in harmony with the bong-themed interior. The staffs were all cordial and hospitable. Overall, its just the right place to drop in for meal. All the best to the team for their future ventures.

After an extensive research on Bengali New year's this was the place that won the race. It is located in a very prime location of South Kolkata. Somewhere nearby the golpark area. Very posh locality yet a humble place. This isn't constructed as a normal restaurant looks like. It has a very homely feel, I guess mostly because the place is built on the ground floor of a home/ apartment. But the owner seemed truly inviting and caring. She had eye for details to each and every guest, arrived that busy evening and asked everyone whether they enjoyed their meals. We had ordered a lot of food and needless to say we asked them to pack them as we could not touch most of the things. Haha. Somehow we forgot about the parcels and left after the bill was paid and one of them ran to catch up with us and asked us to take the parcels. Very accommodating and nice experience. Well worth the visit.

A little overpriced for the amounts they provide, not returant type but quite homely cooking. So couldn't complain on that. Acceptable amounts of food, good taste and prompt delivery.
Recommendable.

The place is tucked inside a wider lane of Jodhpur Park on a ground floor of an old but well maintained house with nicely done up interiors. While it was a hot and humid afternoon, the restaurant was quite chilled inside. We ordered for Koraisutir kochuri with Alu Dam, steamed Rice, Loitar Jhuro, Rasun Bhapa Bhetki and Mutton Dukbangalow. All the dishes were well cooked with distinct taste of grounded spices. Bhapa Bhetki with garlic favoured paste smeared over the fish was a show stopper!! The waiter who was serving called Raj was hospitable and assisted us in explaining the preparations well. He was also quite honest with the serving time which took about 20 minutes , that many restaurants don't. This restaurant also merchandises bengals famed handicrafts which can definitely catch fancy of a non-resident. Over all, the experience was quite satisfying. Some of the photos I am posting with this review were taken after I had started eating, which also explains that you jump into eating without caring a fig in this world when fresh aroma forces you to look no further!!! They gifted a cute little jute doll to my daughter and yes she was delighted.

So Saturday afternoon my friend and I visited this place. We just got to know about this place from zomato .We wanted to explore one  amazing place for Bengali cuisine and LOKAAHAR is one such amazing place. First of all the ambience of this restaurant was splendid.The decorations and rabindrasangeet playing in the background was beautiful and soothing. Now let's come to food. Amazing food. Chicken dukbunglow is a must try out there. We had for starters fish fry . Then we had jhuro aloo bhaja, moongdal with narkel , dhokar dalna,  chicken dukbunglow, rice , koraisutir kochuri. The food tastes amazing and the quantity is also sufficient. Most importantly it is very pocket friendly. The staffs were very courteous. Overall a very good experience. I will recommend it to everyone. It's a must try  place for all.

Little hard to find this place.. have to follow the maps and able to find it.. To be exact behind Jodhpur Park Boys... 
Restaurant was incorporated at the ground floor of a house which gives you a homely atmosphere. We went have lunch and we ordered Plain Rice, Mocha Chingri, Bhetki Paruri, Yellow Polao, Chicken Dukbunglow. 
Bhetki Paturi was baked inside aluminum foil not inside banana leaves which actually reduces the taste and quantity of mustard is so huge that sometimes it tastes bad.. I am actually disappointed with it. Rest of the foods were tasty.
They lack trained stuff.. We ordered Mutton Duckbunglow but ended up getting Chicken.. Improvement is required..

Amazing interior with unique table & chair arrangement. Soothing rabindra sangeet plays in the background. This place sells handicraft items as well. Beautifully decorated walls with nice paintings. A complete 10/10 for the interior.
Full marks for quality of food as well. We ordered POTOL ER DORMA(NON VEG) which is potol filled with mashed potatoes & prawns served in a thick & nice gravy. BASANTI PULAO tasted just perfect. 👌
CHICKEN DAKBUNGLOW contained 3 pieces of chicken. The dish is served with fried egg on the top. The PARATHA was amazing as well. CHINGRI KOBIRAJI being the winner is a must try at this place.

SERVICE: The staffs are very cordial. A 8/10 for them.

Price: REASONABLE. Pocket friendly 😁

Surely going back for some more BangaliAna. ✌😁😉

Had ordered from them their thali and a fish curry. The package cost was huge because they charged me separately for each and every item. The chana r kofta had turned sour and was stinking , the fish was rotten. I had billed up 600 out of which 150 or 160 was the packing charge.

It needs a lot of improvement and sure as hell needs to offer better quantity and quality for the prices they charge.

This is the first time we visited this place for lunch but we found the atmosphere of the restaurant is good curteous staff but service is very slow and food quality needs to improve a lot... I felt the pricing is bit high in compare to food portion and the standard of the restaurant. As their are so many bengali restaurant we visit and I found this is below average compare to others...

Never ever ordering from this place again! I had placed an order for Thali with Mutton. The order was to be delivered in 60 minutes. After constant follow ups, it was delivered after two and half hours! I live just across the road from where this restaurant is located. After the order finally came, to my surprise, many items were missing from my order. Pulao, kumrophul bhaja, bokful bhaja, shukto, enchorer dalna, all these items were missing. The rest of the items had too much of salt in it. Complete thumbs down and ruined my Sunday. Zomato did not process any refund for this incomplete order either! They said that the order has been cancelled by the restaurant. Looks like a bunch of dishonest cheats running a business. Remember, these tactics wont take you far. Good business always comes with satisfied customers who are willing to return and recommend. Big big thumbs down to Lokaahar!

P.S. I got a full refund for my incomplete order. Thank you Zomato for the service!

We reserved a seat at this place 10 days ago for a lunch with family, but were made to wait for 30 minutes. Took another 30 minutes for them to take our order. Another half an hour after taking the order they informed us that one of the ordered items was unavailable. Then they decided to remake the unavailable item. A full two hours after we were supposed to get a table, we finally started seeing some food on the table. The food quality is average, as good or bad as an run of the mill Bengali place. Service is non existent, takes 10 minutes for them to bring sauce. If you value your time, it's wiser to go somewhere else.

I took my friends for a taste of local cuisine and was pleasantly surprised with the quaint restaurant tucked away in a lane in Jodhpur Park. I chose to order out of experience as a Bengali myself, for my foreign friends. Each item was exquisitely simple yet abundantly flavourful. I was taking a chance with Lokahar since I hadn't been there myself. My friends loved the food and I greatly recommend ' Moiralla Piyaji' a started with the boneless small fish. Great food must visit !

for straight up bong food made well and simply, this place might be the best kolkata has to offer. just did a week in kolkata and ate at all the usual suspects, but this was the only place we had lunch twice in a row. the food is amazing, the quantities are adequate and the prices are ultra reasonable. strongly recommended.

This might look like a rant. But I was so angry I decided to come here and write a review. But first, a little back story. So, I had a guest who wanted to taste the bengali cuisine to whom I had bragged about bengali food several times. And although I was born and brought up in Kolkata, I had probably never visited a bengali cuisine restaurant in Kolkata as far as I remember. So I went to Zomato to find this restaurant that delivers to my address and place an order because we were tired and didn't want to go out. The delivery was on time. But sadly that's about the only good thing I can say about the experience. The cooking was an absolute monstrosity.

1.  The rice was under-cooked for my choice. But I can let this one go as people have their own preference of how they like their rice. 

2. The daal was horrendous. I have lived in several states and usually people have different styles of cooking daal and oftentimes they are vastly different than what bengalis are used to. But nothing I had tasted before could prepare me for this. It seemed like it was cooked long before, had a weird smell and tarted horrible. 

3.  The aloo posto and mocha were at par with the daal. In my 28 years I have yet to taste aloo posto with that dark color from excess spices. I am no chef but as far as I know the only spices that should go into aloo posto is posto and kalo jeera. I have no idea where that dark color was coming from. Mochar ghonto was a little better than the aloo posto and daal. 

4. The fish was dreadful. There was a foul odour coming out of it. It didn't seem like it was fresh. The curry (made from an excess amount of kalo jeera and uncooked badi) both looked and tasted awful. I should also mention here that prior to ordering I called them and asked for a dish that was less spicy and they suggested this dish which they claimed to be their specialty. What a joke!

5. The desserts were far better than the actual food. The paayes and sweets tasted good. But I am sure anything would have tasted good after the horrible horrible main course.

I was so embarrassed by the quality of food (especially after all that bragging) that I had to apologise to my guest.  I have looked through other reviews here which were mostly good. So maybe this was an one-time occurrence and I was the unlucky one-in-a-thousand customer who got bad food. But I am definitely not going back to find that out.

Edit: I have changed my ratings since the service has improved somewhat and is now up to the mark. Thanks to the management for taking my account into consideration.

Following my rating system, Lokaahar gets a 5 out of 5 for food, 4 for decor and 1 for service. 
5*3=15. 3*1=3 3.5*2=7. Sum=25. Rating: 25/6= 4.25. Rounding up to 4.
Now you must be wondering why such a terribly low rating for service. Well, I believe Lokaahar has to work on its service rigorously if it has to sustain its quality. In the multiple visits in the last few months, there are a number of issues I've had to face. 
1. This is the most important issue; they don't follow orders often. We repeatedly asked them to serve the starters first and then, the main course. However, either they serve them together, or they forget about the starters. 
2. Once they completely forgot to pack the remnants as we ordered. We were in a hurry as they were being late in giving the bill and ultimately we had to leave without the packets. 
3. They take immense time to serve food. While they claim that it is because they prepare from the scratch, which I've no qualms about, they surely don't prepare Mishti doi from the scratch? Once they took 20 mins to give us three portions of doi. 

I have nothing to say about the food because they have been rated the best and they probably are the best in the price range and their genre of food. But this kind of service is strictly not acceptable. I would request the owner, who's remarkably amicable, to look into the matter. Great food is an imperative for a good restaurant, but great service makes it a place to frequent. I hope the owner knows it all too well.

Indulge yourself in the mesmerizing taste of bengali food. The smell of steamed fish and the aroma of the delicious "torkaris" will surely win a bengali's heart. Only a minor problem , they take a bit of time to prepare and deliver your food to your home. But afterall , the phrase "Good things come to those who wait" applies as always😊😊..

Lokahaar is a place to nurture your love for long lost bengali delicacies. This amazing 'Chitol Thali' was really fulfilling  and  my tastebuds satisfied to the hilt.  the grand chitol maach, accompanied with dal, aluposto, gorgeous 'Posto Bora', payesh, papad and chutney will make you feel 'kobji dubiye khaowa'.. All the dishes churned out were so well prepared. You will never feel that you are having food outside your home. The decor, hospitable staff and an aesthetic ambience ensures a must visit for all.

Situated in one corner of Jodhpur Park - a posh south Kolkata residential area. Looks brand new from both inside and outside. Menu is interesting, so is the decor. Comfortable seating. Warm hosts. Parking ample. Washroom needs upgrade. Service can go to the next level. Taste and quality of food is good. No - wifi. Should have some children policy or a seperate children play area. Rest is all ok. I was quite surprised to know its existence for the past 2 years. Must try guys!

A beautiful Bong-themed, spacious restaurant that definitely stole my heart. Went there on a quiet afternoon and was treated to the most amazing meal. Their Topshe Maach Bhaja, Chicken Dak Bungalow, with Mangsher Pulao, all washed down with Sweet Lime Soda provided a satisfaction that only good food can give. The desserts consisting of Misti Doi and Sandesh were great too. The interior is minimalistic and to top it all off they have a group of very courteous staffs. I'm surely going to be visiting again very soon.

As soon as you enter the restaurant they have a board saying : BEST RESTAURANT OF THE YEAR" please please let that not fool you into thinking that something wonderful is waiting for you inside. Food is no doubt OK but if not served well. every food tastes rotten.  First of all after we walked in we had to waited over 5 mins before anyone came and attended us. MIND YOU we were just the second table. Waiter suddenly sees us and gives us the menu... Should'nt we be offered water first...... GUYS normal common sense... We noticed that the Manager (A Lady) was sitting in the adjacent room the whole time... totally unaware of what is happening in the restaurant... I came to know she is the manager because we asked the waiter so.... just wonderful experience of simple service gone wrong... We would now expect better service in a road side shack rather than at your place.....

Thank you very much for ruining our day....

We have visited this place from nearby. The first visit was okay as we have opted for chicken thali voucher via nearby. The rice portion was given less however, we ignored it.

DEAL- Takeaway: Chicken OR Fish Meal- Package- Two portions of chicken, rice, dal, aaloo bhaja and a sweet/For fish one portion of rui is offered alongwith rice, dal.

This was provided on our first visit and no delivery charges. We opted two chicken thali's then.

Today, when we visited again, we have ordered the same thali however, this time, we opted for one chicken (Chicken Dak Bunglow) thali and one fish thali. They said the in fish they can offer Katla or Betki as per package deal and proposed to go for Katla Kalia which was acceptable and mutually agreed.

They also charged rs. 40 for packaging separately. Strangely, the voucher should also taker that charge as the name suggest: Takeaway: Chicken OR Fish Meal. Anyway it wasn't a big deal.

But, I after returned home ,we found that instead of Chicken Dak Bunglow they give up plain chicken kosha two portions (not good at all) and instead of Katla kalia they have given Rui portion which was also nothing to ride home about.
 NOTE- there was no aaloo or sweet this time.

On checking the offer we found that they have altered the deal now and have mentioned that for fish its only Rui, which is what they provided strictly speaking but we feel that we were cheated as incorrect expectation was set.

Why management or staff need to promise something which they cannot offer!! Completely unprofessional.

Also, the owner's (lady) behavior towards us was also not very welcoming as she was advising to order from normal menu instead to go for Nearby deals and justifying that the portions in the deal would be less intentionally!!
WOW !! instead of  acknowledging the past mistake which they did with rice portion she is justifying it.

I do not get it- IF if the restaurant and management are not happy about this, why have they tied up with nearby and offering package deal to customer's??
They should mention it, we offer good service only once, come via nearby for the second time at your own Risk!! hah.

Secondly,  she was saying that if we have normal dining,  then it should not take more than Rs. 500 for the meal for two. Cum'on its our decision what we want to order.  What I felt insulting was on what grounds was she judging our affordability. Also, she was behaving as if we are trying to steal food from her or something and paying peanuts!!

So, the bottom line is you may visit the place as it offers some good dishes but, do not have sky hopes!!!

Today we went for lunch. We ordered luchi,mutton bon bungalow. The mutton was just yumm and spicy. The mutton was succulent. We loved it. Then we ordered steamed basmati and daab chingri. The daab chingri was not that commendable. The potol r dorma was good. The staffs are coutraseous. But their serving is bit slow. But lokahaar is recommended for those who love Bengali Food. They serve authentic bengali food in reasonable price.

Had Poila Boisakh (Bengali New Year) lunch here with family and friends. Food was good. The ilish mach (Hilsa Fish) was of good quality and my personal favourite: dimer dalna (Egg curry). Couple of jarring notes - the drink was too salty; food arrived way too late, possibly because of poila boisakh rush; and the posto (poppy seeds) in rui posto (Rui fish in a poppy seed gravy) wasn't mashed well enough. Otherwise, good fulfilling lunch. Will definitely revisit.

I would have rated in negative if possible.ordered food on bengali naba barsho.. 15th April 2017. I understand the rush that day and deliveries are supposed to get delayed.my order was placed at 12:15PM and the wait was on till 3:30 PM. Zomato was co operative enough to make constant attempts in getting touch with the restaurant nd finally making an immediate refund. However the restaurant was irresponsible to such an extreme, forget about the order getting delivered, they never made an attempt to update the food wont get delivered.
The challenge on such a day is always understandable, but they never shud have accepted the order in such cases.in case the order was purposed for some guests imagine how the host wud have suffered trusting restaurants of the kind to have food delivered.

Had the most terrible zomato delivery experience today from this restaurant. On the occasion of Bengali new year today, I had placed a lunch order at this restaurant through zomato. The order was accepted by the restaurant at 12.39 pm and they promised to deliver by 2.34 pm which is almost 2 hours time. I absolutely understand the amount of rush today so I was okay with the 2 hours wait time. But then, it was already 2.34pm and the order status at zomato showed me that the delivery guy wasn't even on his way. I was still okay with it and thought that the delay must be due to excessive rush. So i wanted to find out how long it would take. Believe me, the zomato guys and I kept trying to reach the restaurant on their multiple phone numbers including the restaurant manager's number and all the other important numbers and not a single response. We kept trying that for the next one and half hours and not a word from them. I was astonished by their irresponsibility and lack of professionalism. Problems can happen on the restaurant's side. But if there's a problem then at least inform the customer about it so that we can make a separate arrangement. Our lunch was ruined. We had to skip through lunch and at around 4.30pm we had to do with whatever left over food we had at home. There was no response from the restaurant and no sign of delivery even at 4.30pm. Finally had to ask zomato to just cancel the order and refund the money. Thanks lokaahar for ruining the day. Don't know about the food as I never got to taste them but you have a long way to cover up when it comes to manners, responsibility and professionalism.

Be careful when you order from here, they suddenly turn off their phones and don't deliver your order. And you are left stranded with stupid Zomato support who keep saying they can't cancel the order as they can't reach the restaurant. So be prepared to wait till the cows come home or call your nearest egg roll vendor.

Visited this place with family. The decor and ambience is outstanding. However , the waiting time after placing order is exceedingly more. Had rice, moong dal, jhuri alu bhaja, potol dolma, chitol muithha, bhetki bhapa, pabda kalo jire jhol, chicken dakbungalow, aam chutney. So far as taste is concerned, the vegetarian dishes have a slight edge over the non veg ones!

I visited this restaurant today and came out with a big smile. I wasn't in a mood to have anything heavy so just ordered Plain Rice, Shukto and Begun Basanti & Aam pora shorbot...thought Aam pora shorbot was complimentary for the first one but I liked it so much that I ordered them two more glasses...it was that good :) any way the staffs were extremely courteous and friendly and full of warmth and also the place was tastefully decorated... The taste of the food was ecstatic to say...specially Begun Basanti had that strong taste ad flavour of shorsey bata ( mustard seeds paste ) which no other restaurant has ever provided me in Kolkata a least.. Kudos to u guys..keep p the good work !!! would surely visit again and wish after u garner fame n success u would keep your quality and price both in control and not exorbitantly high like some others do... :)

The place is nicely located; slightly i side from main road but yes far from the madding crowd. Small house is converted to develop but very ideal for having authentic bengali food. Tried mango based betki gravy and liked it. Also the mutton polav was very good with soft well cooked mutton pieces. Service is very caring and courteous. Like to visit again to try something different.

This place serves authentic Bengali food. Very warm and cozy. Staff extremely well behaved. Food takes time to prepare because it is cooked from scratch. I visited the place twice in 1 week and had fish fingers,postor Bora,bhetkir paturi,bhetkir rosun bhapa,kosha mangsho,potoler dorma. They serve dessert n small bowls and the kalo chaler payesh is exquisite.

If you want to try Bengali cuisine, No doubt this place is the best shot! This is the third time I am visiting this place for the love of Bengali cuisine, and everytime this place keeps me amusing with the quality of food and the service it provides. It says to get the best thing you have to keep patience and wait, likewise after placing your order, you do have to wait for few minutes but believe me it's worth waiting. Definitely give a try to Mutton Dakbungalow, Bhetki bhapa among the many dishes. And to add on, why not give a try if you get 50% off from Nearbuy for the delicious Thali they are providing. So, give it a try and do visit this place!

The place is nicely decorated, spacious, has a village kind of fill. Stuffs and owners are very warm and friendly. Coming to the food part, bati posto (a speciality of Bankura) was really good. Since I am a posto lover, I really loved that dish. Echorer dalna was also good. I had bori die tangra r jhol which was quite nice. Golda chingri malaikari was also good. In desert I had misti doi which was good as well. Hope to visit this place again.

If you guys are looking for a place that gives you the ambience of a true fine dining experience and yet the pocket pinch is not that bad then LOKAAHAR is the place to be. Special mention to the manger who goes out of his way to delight you. 

The best part is there food which truly lives up to its reputation of home cooked experience. Went there with my Family and was pleasantly surprised.

A special note of hanks to the the Manager whomade us feel as if we walke into his house rather than a restaurant.

will surely visit again

We visited the place after seeing laudatory reviews/recommendations in the media. As the title mentions was sorely disappointed with the experience.

Since ours was a first time visit we requested the waiter for help in selecting the menu and also asked what were the house specialties. Waiter suggested we could have thalies (platters) on offer and added we should also have a look at the menu! We ordered Prawn Thalis for both of us along with starters. We were pleasantly surprised when they served us a welcome drink, which was quite well prepared. They also informed us that they would be offering us a 10% special Valentine Week Discount. Thereafter the fun and games started!

They brought in the platters without serving us the starters. On inquiry, they nonchalantly informed us that they have not prepared the starters as we had cancelled the order for starters! We pointed out that we never cancelled the the order. They said that they can prepare and serve the starters but it will take it's own time! Since the platters were already served and we were hungry, we decided to give up on the starters.

The platter was also a rude shock. The portions served were totally inadequate and we we had to order additional servings from the menu. Dal served with the platter was extremely bland. The quality of prawn curry mediocre, to be highly charitable.

Overall it was a bad experience, not to be repeated again.

Well well well. A new kid on the Bengali Restaurant block!!! Situated at an almost hidden place around Jodhpur Park area this joint is beautifully decorated. The drawings on the walls were too good. The service guys were so so so nice and courteous and always smiling. We ordered Holud Bhaat(Basanti Polao), Postor Bora, Chhanar Danla, Mutton Bon Bunglow and later the cook(we presumed so) requested us to try Kalo Chaaler Payesh.

Holud Bhaat was decent.
Postor Bora was good.
Chhanar Danla was excellent.
Mutton Bon Bunglow would have been excellent but the lack of salt in it killed the taste. 😔
Kalo Chaaler Payesh was good.

Overall the 1st experience was very good and hopefully would be Excellent next time. What delighted me was the courteous behaviour of all the staffs and the manager. It had a personal touch.

We were given a 10% discount on the bill dont know why.

PS. They didnt add any taxes at all on the bill.

Definitely a must try for all food lovers.

Ambience:4.5/5
Service:5/5
Quantity:4/5
Quality:4/5(-.5 for lack of salt in the Mutton dish)
Value For Money:4.5/5

Went there last sunday...it was our anniversary and had relatives coming over from different part of the world who wanted to taste authentic bong food...having tasted most of the available choices and after serious deliberation  picked this restaurant based on the review and for the fact that it was pretty close to my place. My uncle being paralytic was another concern. However, we were greeted warmly by the staff.. they helped my uncle due to his restricted mobility.. coming to the food.. they were light, tasteful and fresh.. they even made changes according to our specifications.. hospitality was amazing.. the only concern being the service was extremely slow even though there was only one another guest other than us.. we later understood that they had bulk orders  which caused the delay.. WE had

Tetor dal -- good

Mug dal   -- good

Posto bora -- very good

Fulkopir bora --- good

dhokar dalna --- very good

potoler dolma -- excellent

polau --- average

chitol macher muithya -- good

mourolar jhol jhinge begun diye (ON REQUEST) --excellent

mutton dak bunglow -- very good

Mete chocchori -- average

khejur amshottar chutney - excellent

One of the newer places in town serving Bengali cuisine in variety. Being a stone's throw away from home, we mainly order from this place, cause it gets difficult to unite the entire family on the issue of walking to this place. I guess the old adage "Closest to temple, furthest from God" truly applies in this case. Coming back to the main issue....The orders from this place have always been on time. The quality of food is very very good. We have ordered various thalis on various occasions (mainly fish), and other items too. The different preparations of various types of fish are definitely something to savour, a reflection of the taste of Bengal, which comes through nicely. Variety is good, quality is good, quantity is sufficient and prices reasonable too. What else can one expect. Definitely want to pay a visit some day and experience the ambience.

The place from outside looks like a make shift arrangement as it is set in ground floor of a residential house. 

Inside also there is no restructuring but in a way it gives a feel of authentic bengali restaurant. 

Also, the setting inside is quite good. It is quite peaceful and I was relishing having cuisines in peace. 

Being a big fan of bengali cuisines. I had high expectations from this place and they came through. 

Papda_sorse was delightful. Aam Doi was also delicious. 

I didn't like aloo bhaja as they put chilli in it. 

Service as also good.

Lokaahar is the best restaurant serving Bengali food near my home. But without this proximity, Lokaahar is indeed doing a great job serving authentic Bengali cuisine. I have dined here as well as ordered online. The ambience of Lokaahar is amazing: brightly lit, neat and clean with excellent wall arts. 

Now the food, Chital muithya is my absolute favourite, though it is on a sweeter side, still the taste is lip smacking. Luchi and Kosha Mangsho are the deadly combination they offer. Duck Egg curry is too good here. Also, the fish fries are cooked to perfection. The mango chutney is s mouthful of flavours.

The home deliveries are always prompt. The staffs are really amicable and courteous. People who have a knack for Bengali cuisine, Lokaahar is definitely a highly recommended place.

This place is located in the lane just opposite to abar baithak. The decor of the place is very simple,  courteous staff and amicable owner. We ordered steamed rice , alu bhaja , mung daal , mocha chingri and robibarer mutton. Food is just like home cooked and they assure you that you get the best and fresh food. Unlike many restaurant I get the flavour of mutton as it is. The flavour of onion and garlic has not overshadowed the taste of mutton. Mocha chingri is nice. Daal is thick . Ambience is good with simple decor. Service is bit late as they make the food after u order.

Lokaahar surely keep their promise in the matter of serving authentic and quality food. The price they offer is fair and value for money. The homely atmosphere and friendly service makes it even more attractive. Located in a peaceful corner of Jodhpur park makes it easy accessible. I can suggest Lokaahar any day for its amazing experience.

Real gem of a restaurant serving 'real taste of bengal'...located in one of the bylanes of jodhpur park it is a bit difficult to locate but the food and hospitality really makes it worthy of the fame it has earned over a short span of time...the decor reflects the artisanship of rural bengal...went there on sasthi, so tried their sasthi thali...started of with shorbot(they use paramount shorbots), kumroful bhaja,luchi chholar daal,potol posto,navaratna korma,polao,chicken kosha,chingri bhapa,kalo chaler payesh...presentation was great...quantity more than enough for even a glutton like me...one of my friends being repulsive to milk products,her dessert was replaced with rossogolla which shows the kind of attention they pay to the diners.

The starter ie begun bhaaja took 45 minutes. The narkel daal served along with it was cold. The papad was half piece each for one plate along with one small bowl for chutney good enough for only one person. The sorschey ilish and bhaapa ilish was the saving grace. Bhekti Paturi didn't have the kick one gets from the mustard flavor. Overall the worst choice to end the Pujas. Only good part was abhishek the manager who could converse politely on phone. Almost all customers had to wait for their food. They are not geared up at all plus the  price they charge for such measly quantity.

Visited this place today and had to wait for almost 2 hrs though the place was reserved by us.. The gatekeeper didnt let us to get in and talk to the manager.. Coming to the service this place has the worst service i have ever faced till date.. They dont take care of the customers they dont serve the customers properly and half of the items were unavialiable.. We ordered Dak Bunglow,Bon Bunglow,Chingrir Malaikari and Jhuri Alu Bhaja. The food was basically tasteless and the chingri they serverd was not worth 250 at all.. The charge a lot and the place is not worth it.. untidy staff and worst management as a whole worst experience ever...

Was scouting for a new place to try something authentic Bengali...Hence fell back on Zomato to discover this place..At the onset, an average but neat place tucked in the bylanes of Jodhpur Park..Staff is friendly and the food is average however the service TAT's are a tad pathetic and need improvement by volumes....Had to wait for approx. 45 minutes before the starters got served..

We had been to Lokaahar on 9 October around 2 PM.

Ordered Beguni, Topse fish fry and fried pumpkin flower, Tangra fish Jhaal, mutton bon bungalow.

We were served at 2-50 PM, clearly after 50 minutes.

Toshe fish fry was stinking, all items were cold, only 3 tiny fried pumpkin flowers we were served.

I will try each day a new food joint; but will never never never never never never try this stupid Lokaahar.

I will recommend that DON'T TRY LOKAAHAR, DON'T TRY LOKAAHAR ever.

Quite impressed by the reviews of Lokaahar on Zomato , I decided to give it a shot and ordered food for home delivery. However, what I experienced was extremely disappointing.

First, they have a very inefficient home delivery system . The restaurants who extend the home delivery service , for a prompt and efficient delivery experience , they should own a vehicle (like four wheeler van or two wheeler motor cycle) - bicycle is the last option a restaurant can think of for delivery in a radius of 3kms. As expected that took a toll on the delivery time which they promised. Instead of 2pm as promised online , the delivery man actually arrived at 2:45pm.

Now coming to the food quality which actually should be the talk of the hour. We ordered 

steamed rice, (5/5)

holud polao, (2/5)

moong daal with narkel, (4/5)

Jhuro aloobhaja, (4/5)

posto bora, (3/5)

Fulkopir roast, (5/5)

Dhokar dalna, (0/5)

Potoler dorma (1/5)

The holud polao had a strong garam masala essence and was extremely sweet which I felt was unnecessary and the essence and sweetness could have been underdone!

Posto bora was tasty but the posto in it was really less.

Coming to the disasters - dhokar dalna and potoler dorma. Both the dishes had exactly the same gravy - the chef might have thought he would trick us and no one would know . 

The dhokar dalna was completely stale and had a foul smell . One of us tasted the dhoka first and realised that it is rotten and warned others not to have it. The whole container of the dhokar dalna was smelling like rotten food. We threw away the rest of the dhokar dalna. And to add to the disaster , the one amongst us who actually tasted the dhokar dalna initially got food poisoning that day ! 

I was really embarrassed as he was my guest and I felt guilty for what happened. I wonder what would lokaahar had done - had we ordered the same dish inside the restaurant. This attitude that since it’s a home delivery order - so you have the opportunity to get rid of all your stale food - is so disgraceful on the part of the restaurant.

However, I give 2 stars for the items I really liked and was satisfied with - fulkopir roast , daal , aloobhaja and plain rice.

No points for the delivery system and for the dreadful experience with some of the dishes , I would never go back to Lokaahar and neither would my friends.

After a long time went out to try bengali cuisine outside home and we headed for lokaahar. 
Food was ausome as we had luchi chanar dalna and mutton.
Waiters were courteous and the environment was indeed homely.
 I will definitely visit this bengali joint  again and again

Simplicity...thy name is Lokahar...in terms of its outer getup (off the busy-ness of a busy thoroughfare in a busy locality).. Its inner ambience(simple layout with touchups of artwork..reminding one of "grihosto bari")..the servers(simple in looks..talks and work- keeping the service simple).And the food was simple without any paraphernalia... Tasty ....the Khichuri..the maach bhaja...the bati posto(of Bankura fame!)...the Pepe(papaya) chutney...the Devil(the full egg chop...for understanding of  non kolkatans)...all praiseworthy...
If you want " more than value for money"...recommend it for those  who love and for those who wish to have authentic Bengali food!

Out of bengali cusine that I have tried in various places across the city, this place is indeed good with quality, quantity and taste..
We tried Alu bhaja, alu posto, pabdar jhal, tangrar jhal, bhetki paturi, behtki boda, chingri boda (those boda are basically chop),mutton dakbanglow and finally tomato chutney with amshotto and khejur.
The only drawback of this place would be delay in service since they prepare your food once they receive order so there is this delay in serving food.
However this place really commendable for bangali
 khabar!!

Thumps up!!

Many of us will agree, that, when you go to a restaurant now a days you have to think a couple of time about the food bill and the pile of taxes levied on them and then you start reconsidering your urge to eat out. Well, a sigh of relief on your urge of having Bengali food,maybe, now you dont have to think twice to fulfill the same. I would not say its super cheap because the mango chutney and the black rice pudding costed us Rs 70/- but the quantity was for only one person. I also felt the 'alu Jhuree bhaja' is my top favorite could have been a little bit more in quantity. The host was very friendly and the behaviour of the waiters were very friendly.  It felt like I was having food at home. I would definitely want to go ones again.

One day we skipped our home kitchen and after a long search decided to go here along with my wife and 4 years old angel. The name did not inspire me much, sounded like some government effort!
But once I entered the place... everything changed. What a lovely day that was with periodic rains outside and inside we were some where near shantiniketan or  traditional bengal.
The restaurant is a old building, morphed to look like a home-restaurant. Seating capacity is around 20. Nicely arranged and decorated. On reaching the place staffs welcomed with a homely smile. There is a small handicraft shop inside as well. By the time you get your food ready, look around or buy something if you like.
My biggest concern was food for my angel and they had the right balance... spicy, rich items for adults and plain well coocked items for the little one.
We had mutton duck bungalow, plain rice, bati posto, chatni and ended with koolfy. Enough quantity for two to fulfil the tummy. Tasted good.
But, hats off for creating such a nice place for escape from crowd and noise.

This is a gem of a restaurant. We went there yesterday for dinner. First of all, we fell in love with the decor. The restaurent is beautifully decorated keeping traditional art forms of rural Bengal in mind. It has a separate shop exhibiting Bengal handicrafts, too.
Upon entering, we were greeted by the stuffs. And to mention, they are thoroughly courteous and  they contributed to rate this restaurant 5 out of 5.
Coming to food, mourala peyaji was an absolute winner as a starter. Our main course was comprised of steamed rice, chanar dalna and ilish bhapa. Every item tasted wonderful. We ended our meal with chandana kheer and trust me, this was heavenly. Moreover, the prices were inclusive of taxes which simply added up to our level of satisfaction.
I would recommend all the food buffs to give it a try.

Lokahar is a quaint little restaurant situated in a remote bye-lane in Dhakuria. Visited today, being impressed by its high rating and reviews in vernaculars. It`s a restaurant that serves delicious home made bengali recipes of the yore at reasonable rates. Service is pretty quick and the staff extremely courteous and attentive. ambience is ok but can be improved. Only problem is to locate the resturant.Do you need any other reason to give it a near five star rating

Lokahar in one sentence can be described as one of the hidden gem of a restaurant where "ghoroa bangali khabar" is served with utmost care, the decor also compliments the concept of the restaurant, it is almost a 30 seater restaurant where the taste is equally important and also the quantity of spice used is less. I really like the chingri macher bora and chitol muitha here.

It was a couple of months back when i was looking for some excellent bengali food near my office and I found Lokaahar. The first time we ordered a takeaway of dal, plain rice, alu bhaja and aloo posto ( i am not quite sure about the last item) and since then, we are regulars at Lokaahar. We usually order delivery to our office and I have had their food so many times, that I have lost count. 

The food is just superb, delicious and perfect (almost always). Over the period of the past  3-4 months, we have tried their plain rice, alu bhaja, alu posto, mushur dal with hing, biulir dal, moong dal with narkol, lau chingri, lote maach er jhal, doi potol, phulkopir roast, chicken kosha, ckickrn cirry, sada chicken, chicken and mutton dukbanglo, chicken bonbanglo several times and we liked them at all times (mostly). 

The prices are all reasonable, compared to other Bengali franchises or joints. Though we have never dined there, yet we have visited the place. The ambiance will give you the Bangali feel and the inner room is decorated with beautiful traditional Bengali dolls. 

The staff are courteous and helpful and nice as well! 

Thumbs up!

The best Bengali food that doesn't burn a hole in your pocket!!!
I had a Nearbuy coupon for a chicken thali. I visited Lokaahar pretty late in the night, around 9.30 pm. The restaurant was empty and I was the lone guest. It was understandable, given it was the last day of the month and it was a weekday evening. The place is very easy to locate. It's near Jodhpur Park bazar. If you are coming from Gariahat, cross the Dhakuria bridge and take the first right, go straight and turn on the third left and then the first right, you will be at your destination. The decor is simple and reflects a traditional Bengali household, may I say, one in a suburb with nice potachitra on the walls and tables having figures carved out of wood. These figures are much like the wooden dolls that you see during traditional Bengali melas and I believe they originate from a district in Bengal, but offcourse my knowledge of the same is limited. 
So, the food was pre-decided by the voucher. The staff suggested me Chicken Bon Banglo (a spicy Kosha type gravy that will go well with both rice and pulao). The only modification made to the set meal was Roast Fulkopi in place of Mochar Ghanta. Plus, I ordered for a Milk Rose with cream sharbat. Lokaahar has a tie-up with the legendary Paramount Sharbat of College Street and you get the same thing for the same price, not a single rupee more. Lokaahar is probably the only authorised restaurant who can sell Paramount sharbats other than Paramount itself. So, here's a review of each and every item on the thali:
Milk Rose: Creamy with a curd base, excellent for those who doesn't want a heavy Sharbat like Cocoa Malai (that's my favourite at Paramount). 
Rice: Long-grained fine rice, had a slight aroma to it. 
Bhaja: There were two pieces each, of Kumro Phool bhaja and Bok Phool bhaja. These are traditional Bengali titbits that's offered as an appetiser and very few Bengali households make these things on a regular basis. It was my first tryst with these bhajas and I liked them. They were crunchy with a thin coating and the batter had coriander leaves and onions to make it a bit crispy. 
Dal: I was served the Moong Dal with Narkel. The dal had finely cut carrots and beans as well with a dollop of ghee or clarified butter. Words fall short to describe how much I liked the dal. I ordered for a bowl of dal for take away and Infact I will visit Lokaahar again to have the dal again. It was the best dal that I have ever tasted. 
Kosha Alur Dom: This one has two medium sized potatoes in a rich, spicy tomato based gravy with onions. It is the quintessential Alur Dom that we love with our luchis and parathas. My only gripe is here that potato seemed a bit too much boiled and lacked the firmness that you would expect from the Alu of Alur Dom. 
Roast Fulkopi: A subtly spiced cauliflower gravy in a white curd and cream based sauce. The cauliflower florets were properly cooked and the gravy was yummy. 
Holud Pulao: Another gem; this one was not overpoweringly sweet like most Bengali restaurants and the sweetness was nicely balanced by a subtle spiciness, possibly from the garam masala that goes into making an authentic holud pulao. 
Chicken Bon Banglo: Two medium sized chicken pieces in a rich, tomato based spicy gravy. The gravy was tasty and complimented the subtle sweetness of the pulao brilliantly. However, I felt the chicken could have been cleaned a bit more, as I found traces of the skin on the chicken ( I'm not sure if a chicken with skin was used). 
Chatni: Simple aamer chatni with kalo jeera, is perfect for your digestion. 
Sweet: One piece of rossagolla; standard fare.
The best part about the food is that it's not overtly spicy like some Bengali restaurants, yet it's much more tasty. And the pocket pinch will not send you looking for cover. The usual thali costs 400 INR, Nearbuy vouchers give you a 50 INR discount. 
The service is great. The staff is very welcoming, though the overall service is a bit slow. I understand that, possibly because it takes time to cook good food. Lokaahar has surely carved a niche for itself in a very short span of time and I can certainly see what's their selling point: good food and great service. Good luck team Lokaahar.

Visited this restaurant after searching for a homely bengali lunch. Though the place is located near jodhpur park we had little trouble reaching this place but as soon as we entered we were amazed by the homely environment and hospitality of the  staffs over there. We ordered sona mug daal, bhaat, alubhaja, chingri .since they took a bit time to prepare the alubhaja they gave us a complimentary daal er bora plate.all the dishes were awesome. Am alwaz an ardent lover of bengali cuisine and this one has become one of my favorite. Will visit again:-)

I was recommended by a food blogger about this hideout, decided to give it a try with a friend who was on a trip to Kolkata. 

The place was not difficult to find. Thanks to zomato. We had a very warm welcome. We found out we were thr only one at the restaurant. We visited the restaurant at around 9.15 pm

We ordered fish fry as starter at around 9.25. The promptness of service is impressive, but we waited a longer period than we expected for the food being served. 

The fish fry: it was well stuffed fish fillet, perfect spices, perfectly fried with kasundi. Its a must try.

We also tried Begun Bhaja: which was uncooked. 
We ordered dhania chicken, we were told it to be very spicy. But later we found out the gravy was sweet. What a disappointment.  

Rest all the items that we ordered were very average. But i personally loved mete chachchari. I miss such dish staying away from home.

Although it was a mixed experience, worth another try.

Please note: the quantity of food is on a lower side. May vary person to person.

The staffs are new and have lesser idea about the food and recommendations.

Unavailability of dessert items. We had a very limited option on the dessert menu. Most of them were unavailable.

Truly a warm and cosy little place this restaurant. Were in double minds to try out a new joint but all apprehensions were gone once we sat and spent over 1.5 hrs at this place.

Not only did the food tickle our taste buds to the core but we also felt the extreme warmth of the homely service that was given out to us.

Hope you guys maintain the same statndards further down the line.

Keep it up

The ambience of the restaurant is neat and clean and exhibits the culture of Bengal in it's interior decoration, and ambience. 
The quality of the food served were fresh and the preparations were also flavourful.

Now coming to the service - we had to wait for almost 50 mins after placing the order and even after waiting that long, all items which we ordered were not served in order. Like we were served mutton first followd by  Moong Dal and after poking the man serving us, who forgot to serve us the Shukto, it was served much later. The service of the restaurant is extremely pathetic. Once the food is served, there are no people around to serve you water or take another round of your order if you need something else.
The Lokahar team has to pull up their socks and improve their service and hospitality, if they want to consistently run their restaurant.

Intrigued by the name and positive reviews, I stepped into this paradise of traditional Bengali cuisine alongwith my Bengali friends. This is a place where all items are prepared fresh, unlikely in most famous Bengali Restaurant chains around the city, so it takes a bit of extra time to be served. But to occupy your time you can chat with the friendly staff and browse around their traditional rural handicrafts. The food is generous in quantity- especially the khichuri, with a variety in l prawn and mutton dishes and not overly spicy, just like home cooking. We tried the veg items like shukto and posto too. To end it all the dessert was chandana kheer which is served in little earthen pots. Definitely worth a second try. Pre-ordering/booking is recommended to ensure exactly what you need is ready by the time you get there.

I don't know exactly on WHAT BASIS you call this a "restaurant", because no where in proper restaurants I had to bear such kinds of insults. They have a landline(official) phone number where there is NOT MENTIONED about the time for calling. Throughout the day I was busy with my schedules so I called the number at 12:30 in the night, and that too because I had planned to go there with my friends on the very next morning. Will I not clarify about the online deals they provide? Well, so the person who took my call behaved VERY INSOLENTLY with me and said it wasn't 'JUDICIOUS' for me to call a person(though I never knew it could be some personal number-LOL) at this time of the night. And then when I started explaining about my urgency, he simply HANGED UP THE CALL. Such insolent and weird service-trust me- a great foodie like me have NEVER EXPERIENCED IN THE ROADSIDE STALLS EITHER. SERVICE IS TOO POOR AT LOKAAHAR. They never treat us like guests, as they don't even DESERVE to be in this job. I was totally demoralized and I will never even THINK of going there anymore.

খুব ভালো বাঙালী খাওয়ার খেতে গেলে লোকাহার-এ আসতে হবে.খারাপের মধ্যে খাওয়ার পরিবেশন করতে একটু সময় নেয় কারণ বাসি কিছু এরা দেয় না.আর খাওয়ার গুলি খেলে ওই অপেক্ষা করার সময় টুকু ভুলে যেতে বাধ্য হয়.অল্প কোথায় "খুব ভালো"

Tucked away in the sleepy neighborhood of Jodhpur Park (close to Prince Anwar Shah), Lokaahar is a hidden gem for local cuisine of Bengal!
The place is run by Mr. Biswajit who set up this place with a vision in mind- promote the culture of Bengal through Bengali cuisine and art.
Naturally the place exuberates beauty of Bengal culture. Intricate Bengal handwork on the walls, the colorful, tough grass table and chairs add to to the theme of the restaurant.
The restaurant also promotes local artisans from Santiniketan, and has a vast display of Bengal handicrafts dolls, figures, locally made ghee, spices and other artifacts are all on sale, which is Lokaahar's small initiative to support the cause.

The restaurant has a wonderful menu starring Bengal's favorite dishes which make up the cuisine.
I was here for an office team lunch. While my Bengali friends hogged on Katla, chicken and mutton I went all veg with my choice.
• I started with the pat patar bora which was delicious and completely tingled my taste buds. The dish is prepared with jute leaves, besan, spices and deep fried.
• Then we had the aloo posto which was delicious and I could smell the mustard in the cooking. The dish was a lovely blend and I tried it with bhaat.
• Posto bora, with ghee and rice was another favorite. Posto bora was stuffed with onions and topped with Posto adding the much needed crunch.
• The mix veg had a wonderful sweet flavour
• The dal was flavorful and thick and was amazing!
• the dhoka was delicious and I personally am a big of the dish so I gulped down too many pieces of that wonderful dish.
• We finished off with papad and chatni and that was a perfect end to the meal

The service was indeed very good and I was in awe of the hospitality extended by the team.

Good luck and best wishes for team Lokaahar.

We ordered for home delivery from this outlet after reading great reviews in Zomato. However, was not satisfied really for the below reasons.

I called at 10 minutes prior to their closing time and the person who answered the phone said that they have already closed! When I pointed out the timing mentioned he hurriedly handed over the phone to someone else who was better compared to him. 

I want ahead and placed the order for Holud Pulao, Moong Dal with Koraishuti and Posto Bora and below are my observations:

Holud Pulao-It has a very very strong flavour of essence of some kind and the colour was equally over powering. I didn't like the taste of it and would not recommend.

Moving Dal with Koraishuti-The seasoning was not right and overall nothing appealing.

Posto Bora-Extremely average and a little over fried.

Pricing compared to the quality was a big downside.

I ordered for home delivery for 15 heads a couple of days back. I could not write my views earlier. Its an excellent experience. It reached my home right on dot at 8.0 pm. The food quantity is beyond my expectation. It could take care of more than 18 heads. The food quality, all my guests asked for the address and my sister in law asked me to place order for a dinner at her place immediately.

Amazingly guests all enjoyed ALUR DUM more than the Chicken preparation. Each and every item is a class by itself.

Really nice place! Went there today for dinner with family. There were 6 of us including my 3 year old cousin brother. We were quite surprised to find the place empty! We settled down and ordered. The food took around 30 minutes to be prepared (it was a lot of food) and the quality was awesome! The thing that I liked the most was the rate. I've had food in many restaurants before but very few have struck me to being as value for money as Lokahaar.  We ate till we were stuffed and it only cost us 1720! Really satisfied. 

P.S. - Although the restaurant is not the easiest to find but you eventually will as locals know about it very well. Also, it is quite near to South City and thus the area will always have plenty of cabs.

It was a really nice experience visiting Lokaahar. To start with, the interior design was fantastic, enriched with beautiful applications of wood carving of Katwa, patachitra of Midnapore, sheetalpati of Kuchbihar, and much more. It provided a home-like ambience with a touch of special Bengali hospitality. 
The food was really palatable in all respect. "Mourala Macher Pneyaji", Pulao, "Pnathar Mangsho", etc needs special mention. And last but not the least, a delicious Koolfi which definitely stood out from other Koolfis available in the city. My heartfelt appretiation to Lokaahar as a food connoisseur. 
With best wishes,

One more of such local cuisine restaurants which are opening abundantly around the town nowadays. Tucked inside the ground floor of a two storey house, this place will remind you of authentic bengali artifacts and wall arts once you enter. The place also boasts of a small handicrafts store which is the recent trend of the eateries in town. 

Now coming to the most fantastic part of this place which is obviously the food. I must say after a long time i was delighted with the quality and taste of the authentic bengali cuisine in some restaurant. We started with Chingri Macher Bora (Prawn Pakora Bengali style) and it was a gem. 6 pieces full of spices and taste. The Moong Dal with Narkel was excellent and i was very impressed with the quantity. Next came the Chitoal Macher Muitha. The best item of the day. The square pieces were prepared perfectly and was soft and the gravy was equally tasty. The Bekti Paturi was good but i felt the mustard gravy should be provided in a more handsome portion to enjoy with rice. The Chicken Bon Banglo was tasty but the chicken pieces seemed a bit coarse and the gravy was excessively oily. 

Service is one concern. It took more than an hour to prepare the food and even the servers were not updated about the availability as well as the dishes. But they were well behaved and courteous. I also felt they are short on staff.

Located in the jodhpur park area near south city, this is not your regular restaurant. This is a restaurant where they provide you with their "passion for food" on the plates. There's an essence that, they haven't  opened the restaurants just for business  purpose but because they actually want to cater to the "bong-side"of a society. 
FOOD
They serve sensational food.
One major reason why their food is great is because they prepare it fresh unlike many, many other places! 
We (4 members) ordered a ton food. And every single one of then was excellent. From luchis to pulaos, prawns to mutton, every thing was fresh and amazing. 
Do try Chicken Bon Bangla if you crave for the spice content. Also, do try their kulfi, which as stated by the owner is homemade. All in all, everything was fresh, accurate and mesmerising.
SERVICE 
it took them about an hour to serve about 10 items. It might be slow but worth the wait as they prepare everything after the order placed. 
The staff is very courteous.
A special shoutout to the owner, who personally visits each and every customer after every dish is served for the feedback. Hats off to you sir. Kudos. 

Summing it up, please do visit this place, stimulate your taste buds and enrich yourselves with their beautiful yet simple decor, comment about what you've tried at their place for our next visit. 
Amazing place.
Cheers.
Happy dining.

Lokaahar Restaurant Review- Jodhpur Park

We visited this Bengali Cuisine for a lunch through nearbuy.com for a non veg meal to check the delicacies .

We were greeted with a Pora Aam er Shorbat which was very refreshing for a hot summer Saturday afternoon. It was one of the few non-syrup , real mango pulp shorbat, which you could tell by mango fibres in it.

We then choose Bhetki Maacher Boda (Non-Veg Starter)(picture attached). It had a thin crispy top layer with soft Bhetki fish and onion preparation stuffing s. The tomato sauce suited well with it but green chutney would be just awesome.

Moving on, we were served with Luchi, which is a always Bangali's fav, was accompanied with Cholar Dal, which had a good amount of Kaju khismis and Ghee that added a great smell and flavour to it, thus making it different than the usual cholar dal that we are used to. 

In the main course we opted for Holud Polao, which had authentic aroma of Well Cooked Polao with the right combination of the perfect spices, along with Mutton Dak Banglo. Mutton was soft and well cooked.
But this was not the end, we were also served Sorshe Chingri which had a strong mustard smell also tasted well with the Halud Polau. The Prawns were fresh which enhanced the taste, thus making Sorche chingri another hit, although we initially asked for Dab Chingri, which was not available at that time( Tip - If you want Dab Chingri - call them and let them know before hand as it takes 1 and half hour to prepare that dish )

Last but not the least,desert ,Bangalis-Rosogolla

The quantity was too much for two of us, and had sure filled, both our heart and stomach. Definitely Recommend

Lokaahar was on my wishlist from a long time. It was the occasion of my mother's birthday when me n my mom planned to visit Lokaahar dated 9th May. On the occasion of Poccheshe Boishakh, they were serving special thali named as 'Kobi Pokhe Thakur Baarir Thali'. We ordered this one special thali n one extra half plate rice n Chicken Bon Banglo but when we got the food we realised the extras were not needed. Yes, the quantity in the thali is sufficient for two people. Of all the items in the thali my favourite was Sol Begun Bharta, Kacha Lonka Dhone Paata Mutton was average. Desserts were outstanding. Overall was a good experience, only disappointment was the food was not served in a proper way like they first served us with Bhaat, Polao, Aam aada diye daal, kacha lonka dhone paata mutton, lau chingri, after that Sol bagun bharta n Mourola maacher piyaji whereas we expected Mourola maccher piyaji with dal. CHICKEN BON BANGLO, a must try dish at this place. Wish to visit again. Recommendable.

Whenever we come across a new restaurant, the first thing we do is look at their menu. We did the same with Lokaahar and we loved the variety. Now, one word of caution here. This is not like most of the other restaurants in this city. If you want a good meal here, you must, must book your table with the menu a day in advance. When I asked about walk-ins, they said they do allow that, but the menu will be limited, based on whatever they have on stock. Also the waiting time will be higher as they prepare all their dishes from scratch, once ordered. So, if you have just decided to go for a lunch / dinner, within the next few hours, this place is not for you. If you love planning for an elaborate meal sometimes, let’s continue.

The "Kobi Pokkhe Thakurbarir 14 Poder Thali" was introduced in Lokaahar to commemorate Rabindra Jayanti and Thakurbarir Hneshel. Lokaahar is a pretty new Bengali restaurant opened in Jodhpur Park, which celebrates the regional cuisines of Bengal.

Well, locating this place was a bit difficult for me as I came from Dhakuria side, but it is quite easily accessible from South city Mall. 

The best thing about this place is the decor as it takes you to one of those rural homes and the furniture and wall arts are done very beautifully in order to portray that essence. 

The spread comprised of Bhaat, Pulao, Aam Aada diye Bhaja Mung Daal, Morola Maccher Peyazi, Aam Jhinge Posto, Shol Begun Bhorta, Maacher Matha Diye Pui Shak, Sosha Narkel Dudh diye Chingri, Kancha Lonka Dhonepata diye Chicken, Chutney, Papad, Rabdi, Chandrapuli and Paan. 

We were welcomed by a drink “Aam pora Shorbot”. It differed slightly from the usual taste because of the use of the Bhaja Masala(Roasted Spices). The menu was well planned and had some summer cooler recipes like Aam Aada Diye Bhaja Mung Daal and Sosha Narkel Dudh Diye Chingri in order to beat the extreme temperatures outside. I personally liked the sosha narkel dudh diye chingri a lot as it was mildly spiced and pleased the tastebuds. The Mung daal and Bhaat was perfectly accompanied by the Morola Macher Peyazi. The Pulao went well with the Kancha Lonka Dhonepata diye chicken and these two made a great combination. I did not like the Aam Jhinge Posto much. The raw mango chutney paired with papad ended the meal on a pleasant note.

The overall portion was priced at Rs. 690 for one person. 

P.S: It would be better if you order the dishes beforehand so that you do not have wait much as they prepare every item as per the order.

Our family of five went for lunch. We had booked our table but the place was almost empty. Our order was Sukto, mugerdal with coconut, jhuri alu bhaja, kichuri, mango fish fry, rice, misti pulao,dak bungalow mangsho and bone bungalow mangsho. 

Sad to say no dish was cooked properly. It was as if an inexperienced cook was trying his hand. The vegetable in the Sukto was a mash. The yellow pulao was tasteless. The fish and bone bungalow mutton curry were just ok. The price was very reasonable though. 

We decided not to go back there again as we cook tastier food at home. 

One advice, pls get your food tasted by an expert and the cooking method standardised before opening a restaurant.

Tried Lokaahar last week. Good home cooked feel. We ordered home delivery. Quantity was good for two of us. We ordered maachh er matha diye mug daal, kochu bata, mourola maachh er tok. Daal was a bit disappointing as it was too spicy and hot. Kochu bata was made from good kochu, i.e. no itching afterwards. Mourola maachh er tok was the best, property balanced salt, sour, and sweet. Would recommend it.

There’s a new kid on the block, Lokaahar and as per the name suggests, its a bengali specialty restaurant. It has come up with its new menu called  Kobi PokheThakur Barir Choddoh Pokher Thali to celebrate Pocheeshe Boishakh, or the Rabindra Jayanti, the day which marks the birth anniversary of the great scholar and novelist Rabindranath Tagore.

From their exhaustive menu (please be aware, as the owner suggests, the dishes should be ordered before you reach the place, else, please be ready to wait for 45 min- 1 hour), I definitely recommend their Shol Begun Bharta (though the amount of shol fish could be increased slightly) and Aam ada diye dal (a good unusual flavor). Gravy of the sosha narkol diye chingri is  a cooler and definitely must-try, but use of shrimp there is a little turn-down for me. Overall, in 690/- per portion for a set meal, it can definitely be tried.

I was invited by Lokaahar along with food bloggers to sample the ‘Kobi Pokhe Thakur Barir Thali’ which was the special set menu commemorating Rabindra Jayanti over the period of 8th May to 31st May 2016.

The restaurant is located in one of the bylanes of Jodhpur Park, away from the hustle and bustle of south Kolkata. Parking is bliss here as the entire lane is at one’s disposal, as I and my food blogger friend (a co-invitee), found out.

It has been created by converting the first floor of a residential house, much like many of the neighbourhood restaurants in south Kolkata. 

The nice décor is ethnic and reflects the folk art of Bengal. The entrance is tastefully done with a mix of old-world and ethnic feel. The walls have been painted partly in a muddy shade of brown to resemble the wall of a hut. The hand-crafted chairs and tables made of wood and strings have been handpicked from Notungram in Bardhaman district by the owner Basudeb Ghatak himself who has a passion for Bengal’s folk art and culture besides traditional Bengali food. The table mats are made from ‘madur’. The restaurant also houses a gallery with a permanent exhibition-cum-sale of folk art materials collected from various districts of Bengal and a wide variety of organic rice (including some rare ones), all available at reasonable prices.

‘Kobi Pokhe Thakur Barir Thali’ is a painstakingly curated menu by sourcing recipes from the famous kitchen of Rabindranath Tagore’s family from the eminent culinary artist Pragyasundari Devi’s books (She is from the same family) as well as looking up the net.

Our welcome drink was ‘Aamporar Sherbat’ (Roasted mango drink) which had a pleasant twist coming from roasted spices. The elaborate menu was:

Bhaat (Rice)

Polau

Aam Aada Diye Dal

Mourala Machher Piyanji

Shol Begun Bharta

Machher Matha Diye Puin Saak

Aam Jhingey Posto

Shawsha Narkel Diye Chingri

Kancha Lonka Dhonepata Diye Chicken (Or Mutton)

Chatni

Papad

Rabri

Chandrapuli

Pan

I was hungry and the aroma of the rice was inviting. The Aam Aada Diye Dal

had the pleasant smell of aam ada (galangal) which mocks raw mango. The mourala fish in the small, crisp piyanjis complimented the rice and dal beautifully. 

The Shol Begun Bharta (Eggplant bharta with ‘Shol’ fish) was flat and I couldn’t find much of the fish which could have made it interesting. The Aam Jhingey Posto (Dry poppy seed and potato curry with ridge gourd and raw mango) was decent, but I couldn’t feel the mango twist much. The Machher Matha Diye Puin Saak (Dry creeping spinach curry with fish head) was homely.

The Shawsha Narkel Diye Chingri (Shrimp curry with cucumber and coconut milk) offered innovation in the use of cucumber. The light, oil-less gravy of coconut milk with dunked cucumber cubes punctuated by shrimps was delicious. A perfect summer curry that goes equally well mixed with rice or in spoonfuls with the polau. 

Kancha Lonka Dhonepata Diye Chicken (Chicken curry with coriander leaf and green chilli) had a thick, coriander leaf paste-based gravy, which was light on the stomach and perfect for the weather.

The raw mango chutney makes an elaborate meal complete and it turned out well with the subtle use of spices.

The two sweets were outsourced and I loved the rabri. 

What was particularly worthy of note was the homely taste of the dishes thanks to a rare, controlled use of oil and spices. Even such an elaborate meal was not demanding of the stomach.

This table-served menu comes at Rs 690 all inclusive.

Been hearing about this place for quite some time now, so decided to pay a quick visit. The interior is beautifully done and emanates just the Bengali essence that you had been hoping to find here. It is well lit up and the walls are sparsely decorated with tiny canvasses, black and white posters, tribal murals and mat wall hangings. I especially liked the chairs made from the mandatory Bengali item if you are looking for some adda, "maadur". The ambience is perfect too, quiet and with less people. Also, there is a room full of tiny quintessentially Bengali items up for sale - handicrafts, pickles, ghee, terracotta products, wall hangings to name a few. I find them quite overpriced though.

First impressions, however, are not always the best impressions. The food really disappointed us. We dropped by on a late summer evening and thus only went for snacks like Mourola Machher Peyaji, Fish fingers (4 in a plate) and Chicken Pakora. The problem in all the three items remained with not just the quantity but with the quality of the food. Taste wise, I wouldn't complain but the coating in all the fries was too thick thus resulting in sparse stuffing. We thought the prices too were quite high for food of this quality.

We mentioned our grievances to the people serving us and hope to see improvement in the quality of food the next time we visit.
With an ambience as amazing as this one, the place could really prosper with slight changes here and there. If you are charging high, make sure your customers can reap the value off the money they spend as much as you can!

In the mood for some ‘ghorowa bangali khabar‘? Then Lokaahar is the new place to check out. But don’t get me wrong, it won’t serve you the mundane things which comprise regular meals in most Bangali households. It takes the simplest of ingredients and elevates them to a much higher level.

Visited this place today! The place has got some very nice ambiance, very nice people and over the top the pace is wonderfully placed in Jodhpur Park. Coming to the food, it was nice but need to work relay hard on the portioning and the service standard. I was served with Aam Panna but it was not cold at all so I had to satisfy myself with warm aam panna only. The 'Mochar Chop' and the ' Mutton Bon Banglow' was just irresistible just fitting perfect with 'Sada Bhat'. Overall had a very nice experience.
Will be visiting soon!! Hoping to see the difference this time!!

This place was suggested by zomato itself under the newly opened category as i & my friend were looking for a quality bong lunch on a lazy sunday afternoon . We were not only greeted on arrival but surrounded by staffs and other crew members for a good 5-7 minutes as we were going through the menu (which was kind of suffocating). The menu is nicely crafted with variety of dishes from starters to desserts along with a couple of new items in each section (like postor bora,kumror phooler bora,postor bora etc ). Prices are set somewhere in between when compared to the big names serving Kolkata in this genre & the new start ups with attractive & low pricing policies. Neither too high nor to low.
We ordered rice,narkol dewa moong dal, aloo bhaja, postor bora,fish fry,chanar dalna, murghi dakbanglow. As refreshers we had am pannar shorbot. Quality  & quantity of rice was good . The dal was excellent & the fish fry was good but small in size as compared to the price charged. The chanar dalna was average & the taste requires improvement but the postor bora was good. The murghi dakbanglow tasted good with 3 chunks of chicken & 1 leg piece with a egg on top. The chunks of chicken was average as they were mostly bony & lacked the tender juicy flesh. The sarbot was disappointing as it had over stuffed mango pulp & it was difficult for us to sip with the straw.
The decor was good and the wall hangings will surely grab the eye. Don't forget to visit the small section (straight from the entrance) which sells variety of items from show piece for interior decoration to soap.
Overall an average to decent experience i would say as the eatery requires loads of improvement,promotion in order to sustain in the competitive market .

                                                                ...

Visited this place today! The place has got some very nice ambiance, very nice people and over the top the pace is wonderfully placed in Jodhpur Park. Coming to the food, it was nice but need to work relay hard on the portioning and the service standard. I was served with Aam Panna but it was not cold at all so I had to satisfy myself with warm aam panna only. The 'Mochar Chop' and the ' Mutton Bon Banglow' was just irresistible just fitting perfect with 'Sada Bhat'. Overall had a very nice experience.
Will be visiting soon!! Hoping to see the difference this time!!

This place was suggested by zomato itself under the newly opened category as i & my friend were looking for a quality bong lunch on a lazy sunday afternoon . We were not only greeted on arrival but surrounded by staffs and other crew members for a good 5-7 minutes as we were going through the menu (which was kind of suffocating). The menu is nicely crafted with variety of dishes from starters to desserts along with a couple of new items in each section (like postor bora,kumror phooler bora,postor bora etc ). Prices are set somewhere in between when compared to the big names serving Kolkata in this genre & the new start ups with attractive & low pricing policies. Neither too high nor to low.
We ordered rice,narkol dewa moong dal, aloo bhaja, postor bora,fish fry,chanar dalna, murghi dakbanglow. As refreshers we had am pannar shorbot. Quality  & quantity of rice was good . The dal was excellent & the fish fry was good but small in size as compared to the price charged. The chanar dalna was average & the taste requires improvement but the postor bora was good. The murghi dakbanglow tasted good with 3 chunks of chicken & 1 leg piece with a egg on top. The chunks of chicken was average as they were mostly bony & lacked the tender juicy flesh. The sarbot was disappointing as it had over stuffed mango pulp & it was difficult for us to sip with the straw.
The decor was good and the wall hangings will surely grab the eye. Don't forget to visit the small section (straight from the entrance) which sells variety of items from show piece for interior decoration to soap.
Overall an average to decent experience i would say as the eatery requires loads of improvement,promotion in order to sustain in the competitive market .

Very good ambience. The bhetki paturi is delicious. Also the Kali chaler payesh is something new I had here which was really good. This place is constantly coming up with rare Bengali food which is not easily available.

This was on my wishlist for a long time so when I visited Kolkata last week I took my whole family here for lunch. It is a small place so reservation is recommended as it gets crowded on weekends. I liked the ambience. It was traditionally done. Some soothing music could only enhance the ambience. Coming to the food, we had ordered a lot of items. Plain rice, shukto,kochu bata,kochu sag with ilish head, lau uchhe diye moog dal,beguni,mourolla jhaal,pabda kalojeera jhol, bhetki paturi,chitol muithya,robibaarer mangsho, aamer chatni,anarosher chatni and their house special kulfi. The items that stood out was dal,beguni,both the kochu dishes,robibarer mutton and kulfi. The muithya was not very fresh but the gravy was really good. The main disappointment was the paturi.. It was not wrapped in Kolapata but aluminium foil and also the size and preparation was not upto the mark. The service was good but it seemed that they were not professionally trained. We had ordered kumro ful er bora. Some waiters said they are getting it, others said it is not available. So this thing should improve. Overall i really liked the homely touch this place has. I know they will improve with time. Thumbs up.

Yesterday we have organised a family dinner with 20 people including 6 kids at this restaurant, honestly speaking I was little nervous that how this new place can manage such large crowd... To my surprise it was just an amazing experience we had.. All my guests were really happy the way all the food was cooked including Paat Patar Bora which we have tested first time in our lie was just superb to start with Muger Daal With Narkol.. Potoler Dorma with Chana , Chitol Macher Muthi, Vetki Paturi.. All of them were cooked with delightful taste with excellent preparation meant for homely taste.. At the end we had Kalo Chaler Payesh which I don't think any restaurant have in their menu list was just awesome and people ordered more to eat such a new item. The service people of the restaurants were just really good specially managing kids in that place with a smile. Nice to have a family dine with such homely environment with decent cost. We are going to have one more round of get together with my friends next time. Thank you Team Lokaahar..

One of the best Bengali traditional flavored restaurants in kolkata since the beginning of my food journey. The homely ambiance and the simple yet nice decor is very much soothing. This is my first time visit to this place today for having lunch through a groupon coupon and i have felt in love with it. Coming to the location it is near from south city mall (Either walk or rickshaw). After entering we were greeted humbly and the staffs are very polite. We ordered our non veg combo meal which includes amporar shorbot, bhetki macher boda, luchi, narkel dia cholar dal, holud polao, chicken kasha, bhetki paturi, chatni and misti (rasogolla). Ampora shorbot was a refreshing welcome drink. Bhetki macher boda was superb in taste. Luchi and cholar dal was also good but personally i prefer the cholar dal a little bit more sweeter than it was. The holud polao was perfectly cooked with a delicious smell. The chicken kasha was great. I loved bhetki macher paturi most of all the items. I would definitely visit again to taste more bengali dishes. Apart from eating delicious foods something that touched my heart is their homely atmosphere and their courtesy is worth mentioning.

Nice place but a bit away from the main road. It is a newly opened Bengali food joint and when we visited it was almost empty. We ordered ampanna sarvat, plain rice, moog dal, begun bhaja, echorer dalna, chital macher muitha and mutton dakbanglo. All the food items are prepared freshly and hot. Now coming to the food quality all the items are tasted good except the mutton. The mutton pieces are very hard and I'm not able to chew it properly. I also did not like the ampanna sarvat. The staffs are good and polite but they are not professional. Anyway it was a good experience. Hope they will improve their service with time. All the best for team Lokaahar.

Very authentic Bengali is served at Lokahar. Remodelled inside an old Bengali house, the mood is set right to indulge your taste buds with some delectable Bengali flavours. Inexperienced waiters need to learn a thing or two. But no complaints. Will come back again.

Thus the poila baisakh special menu was being introduced. Was invited by @pritha sarkar to a whole new bangali joint which has been recently launched. LOKAAHAR by the name itself is the food for people and it is indeed food by lovers as well. Thus we gathered on a sultry summer noon to welcome noboborsho the foodie way.

Location : This one is a bit difficult to locate. So the easiest would be drop down to lederland opposite south city. Take a rickshaw and they exactly know where lokaahar is.

Decor : the entry to lokahaar resembles a bangali bonedi house with belgium glass. This is interspersed with white decor in between. The theme of the restro is BANGALIANA. They have tried to bring into limelight the rural strata of people residing in bengal. They have based their theme on three things - lokosanskriti , lokoshilpo and lokoaahar. Loksanskriti stands for the culture of the rural people and they do for living. Frames have been captured and through tribal art the different strata of society has been depicted. Lokoshilpo is the rural art. The artefact gallery where there is a compilation of different artefacts throughout bengal is an instance which talks about how they are promoting the rural art. the lokaahar is however justified by the authentic food that they serve. The feeling of a clay hut, with green trees, the shitol paatir maadur speaks by itself.

Ambience : they generally play bengali songs. However occasionally to promote rural music, folk artistes from villages are called to present baul, bhatiali,jhumur and other folk forms. That further adds to the theme manifold.

Staff: the owner , Basudeb da is was a mind blowing host. He was all welcoming and ready to feed "paat perey khawa" just the way bangalis do. Dada was ever ready to serve us. The staffs were quite friendly and coopwra cooperative.
 
Food : coming to the most important realm, lokaahar. The authentic bangla food is what they promote. The concept of "paat perey khawa" has been redefined by lokaahar. The age-old bangali dishes is recreated again by Basu da himself with a magic potions intact.
Beverages -
1. Aam porar shorbot - we were greeted with aam porar shorbot. But this was definitely with a twist. The roasted mango pulp lay afloat which did enhance the whole new concept of the aam pora and was truly refreshing.
Food- Thus started the fanatic food tale.
1. Bhaat - Steamed rice which had a rich aroma was served to us hot and steaming.

2. Shuktoh - I advocated my mother made the best shuktoh in the world. Undoubtedly Basu da beat my mom, in the taste of the shuktoh. The bori , kachkola, raangaloo with the right amount of bitter gourd drawn into a broth with poppy seeds was the numero uno of the noon. The best ever shuktoh undoubtedly.

3. Narkoler daal - the chholar daal with coconut tasted amazing.

4. Aloo bhaja - the potato fries was just too well made. We could just stop eating. The chaat masala spread over to garnish brought the aloo bhaja to a different level. This complemented the daal real well.

5. Echorer dalna - this is basically jackfruit which is a vegetarian mutton fot the bongs. This was really made amazingly.

6. Dhokar dalna - the dhoka is a pakora made from grated pulses. This is one of the famous bengali delicacies. This was also very well made. 

7. Bori diye Pabda maachher jhol - then came the fish for the cat herself. The Pabda is supposedly one of the very important part of the diet for the Banglaseshis. I have had pabda fish not quite often and initially I did not quite enjoy it. So I was very reluctant to have the fish at the onset. But when I tasted it, it was heavenly. The fish was cooked too well with the right amount of spices. I did not even leave the bones behind.

8. aamer chatni - this was probably one of the better mango chutney that I have had. The right amount of garam masala and the right amout of sugar was put in . The chutney was effortlessly smooth and rich in the ripe mango flavour.

9. Kaalo chaaler payesh - this was again the second numero uno of the noon. Blackened sticky rice from manipur was used to make kheer. It was done so well that you could just not stop in one bowl. This is one of the authentic dishes from Basu Da's kitty, definitely a must try.

To sum it up, I would say this is one of the best bangali restros that has been set up in the recent times. To taste and evoke your palate to typical bangali delicious food, lokaahar is your call.

I've been here two times in two weeks and having been completely adventurous food, I've tried out 80% of the Bong food joints in and around the city, from the biggies to the more humble ones. This place is located inside a Jodhpur Park Lane, right next to Bablu Sweets (a popular landmark locally). Located on the ground floor of a typical 'baree' (house), the look and feel of Lokaahar is simple, down to earth and very warm. The menu, right from the design to the items to the pricing are all par excellence. We tried the chicken dakbunglow, chhanar dalna, phulkopi roast, holud pulao and luchi and ended up paying just 550 INR for two people. The quantity was huge, we had to pack some food home. Now, coming to the food:
Phulkopi Roast: 4/5- creamy consistency, good quantity,  just the perfect taste for what is more popularly called malai phulkopi
Chicken Dakbungalow: 4- not too spicy, but good consistency, this dish even had a huge boiled egg sprinkled on it
Chhanar Dalna: 3.5- the chhana pieces were not amazingly soft and moist, that's one thing they should work on. The gravy is impressive
Luchi: Massive 4 pieces of luchi for less than 70 INR! Impressed
Rice: 1 plate sufficient for two, and the best part is that you could order half a plate too
The service is painfully slow and we had to wait for 30 min for the food to arrive. Being a new joint, this place has massive teething problems like untrained staff, lack of a service structure, huge waiting time for food etc. However, what set this apart was the truly warm and courteous behaviour of the staff, including the owner because of which one would feel welcome to visit over and over. Recommend this place to all Calcuttans.

Location: In the lane adjacent Lederland (Opposite South City Mall).

The Kolkattans are ones who have a deep connect with their regional cuisine and relish each and every dish in a manner that no other place tends to exhibit. The people in Kolkata take pride in talking about the roots of the dishes from the Bengali Cuisine and have with time excelled each of them.

A Bengali cuisine is primarily made in a manner which gives each dish a touch of homely flavors. The history says, each dish has a very unique flavor but the taste, be it a home-preparation or professional preparation at restaurants, is just the same. The dishes are made with equal authenticity at home as well as at the restaurants! Such is the love. 

Lokaahar is a newly opened up place warmly located in a bylane near the South City Mall. This place upon entrance, spells of a warm & positive feel with leaves taken from the roots of the Bengali Culture. The AMBIANCE has been kept really simple and the place is so non-descript yet, full of warmth that dining here gives across a feel of dining at home. From the rural look of the clay-washed interiors to the seating from the artisan's kitty to the poto-chitro (a special art form of Bengal) and welded gates depicting the Lok Sansriti, Lok Krishi, Lok Shilpi and Lok Aahar simply drip of culture.
This feel is all because of the checks on each and every detail of the experience. The embedding of historical elements and artifact section to the place just gave it a brownie link to the roots.
Most of the handicrafts in the artifact section are on sale and one could have a look if they interest.

With Poila Baisakh (Bengali New Year) approaching, Kolkata seems to be bubbling with excitement and the people getting all geared up for the year change. With an aura of celebrations around each and every person, why would the properties be a step behind?
Gearing up for the celebrations, Lokaahar is all set to dish out delicacies, ones which every Bengali swears by, from their kitchen. Happened to visit this place upon invitation to witness and taste their Poila Baisakh Menu which has been specially curated for the people. 

A usual Bengali lunch is usually a five course meal starting with a Shukto & ending with a chutney. But, at times an extension is the addition of sweets at the end of the meal. The name itself is suggestive about what one could expect here. Lok-Aahar in simple terms is nothing but, the food which the mass in and around Bengal opt for. From the odd hundred items of the menu, the Poila Baisakh menu is set to offer around forty items and of which a select set was dished out for our tasting:

- Aam Pora Shorbot
Aam Pora Shorbot is a Bengali classic drink made from the pulp of Raw Mangoes. The mangoes are charred on direct flame so as to soften the pulp and thereafter, salt and sugar are added as per preferences. A drink which surely cools down the body temperature and is a must have to beat the heat. The drink here was pulpy and absolutely refreshing. With the rising temperatures, a chilled version of the same would be much appreciated.

- Bhaat
Rice is one of the most important staples in the Bengali Cuisine. And, it surely does make for an important part of the meal. Perfectly cooked rice is said to compliment more or less every single dish served as a side in the cuisine. The bhaat served here did impress by its fluffed up look and tender feel.
A brownie point here goes to Mr. Basudev who in a pleasureful tone, claims to have stocked around thirty types of rice.

- Shukto
A classic melange of vegetables cooked with poppy seeds and mustard, this dish is one of the most important of a Bengali Fare. From the bitter gourd being one the primary ingredients, the dish mostly has all the seasonal vegetables in it. Simmered and served along with rice, the dish is best savored. Here, the Shukto comprised of a lot of vegetables like drumsticks, bitter gourd, pumpkin, ridge gourd, eggplant etc. mixed along with poppy seeds, mustard paste and balanced seasoning which made it a heavy dish. 
Absolute delicacy the Shukto was!
Highly recommended.

- Aloo Bhaja
Crispy shredded potatoes deep-fried in oil and usually served at the start of a meal with dal and rice. The Aloo Bhaja here was perfectly fried with no trace of excess grease and was served with a generous sprinkle of Chaat Masala on top. Complimented well with Narkoler Dal & Bhaat.

- Narkoler Dal
A traditional preparation adorning the Bengali Cuisine is the Narkel diye Daal which is known for its texture and sweet aftertaste. The lentils were simmered to perfection and the added Coconut shavings took the flavors a notch up. Delicious the dal was.

- Echorer Dalna
A raw jackfruit preparation is yet again a leaf out of the traditional food book of Bengal. This dish is a spice based dish with a lot of flavors into it. The preparation was one of the best I have ever had.
Recommended.

- Dhokar Dalna
One of the known pillars of vegetarian dishes from the Bengali Cuisine is this dish. The fried light-spice lentil cakes (Chana dal Kofta) were tossed and simmered in a Bengali-style curry which primarily had tomato & ginger as its base and cumin-coriander as the agents.
Delicious it tasted.

- Aamer Chatni
Popularly known as the Kancha Aamer Chatni (Raw Mango Chutney), this chutney is traditionally served at the end of the course meal. The chutney is primarily tangy with a sweet aftertaste which leaves the taste buds wanting for more.
Was recommended to mix a bit of it with rice and taste. Oh-Boy! The mix did taste nice.
The chutney was perfectly prepared with no loophole left to plug.

- Kaalo Chaaler Payesh
Chaler Payesh (Bengali Rice Pudding/Kheer) is one of the traditional desserts; presence of which is of paramount importance in the Bengali Cuisine. The preparation comprises of soaking the rice in milk overnight and thereafter boiling the milk over direct flame until it thickens. The twist here was the preparation with the black Manipur rice. The taste was balanced and good.
Recommended.

• A Poila Baisakh Special: A special Buffet menu has been drafted which comprises of Aam Panna, Pulao, Sada Bhaat, Lal Shak, Kumrofuler Bada, Moong Dal Karaisuti with Narkel, Potol Bhaja, Alurdom, Echorer Dalna, Bhetki Bhapa, Chicken/Mutton Kasha, Chutney with papad, Misti Doi/Kaalo Chaaler Payesh, Darbesh/Mihidana. Priced at INR 649 inclusive of all taxes seems to be a great takeaway.

The SERVICE by the kakus, as the culture regards, was something that touched my heart. Spelled of culture at every step. Standing right beside the table and being attentive enough to serve whatever is needed without being asked for is something excitingly warm.

• "Bhojon Rashik Bangali" ("food loving Bengali") - wouldn't agree on it being myth as it is a well-known fact that Bengalis are extremely fond of eating and feeding guests alike!
Mr. Basudev Ghatak, a humble and soft-spoken person, is no exception and finds utmost pleasure in making his customers happy with his authentic preparations.

PRICES are something which does pinch if quality isn't up to the mark. But, surprisingly here, these delicious dishes wouldn't cost you a bomb! Reasonable this place definitely is.

Overall was a wonderful experience.
- Would surely return for more! :)
- The preparations are done with fresh vegetables (procured on a daily basis - a story of every Bengali household) on order. Thus, it is advised to either call & make reservations stating the dishes you would like to try on your visit else be ready to wait. Patience would surely pay off! :)

Food tasting at Lokaahar – Poila Boishakh special menu!

There are sudden turns and spots that you come across in your life where you can smell your lost innocence and the essence of your roots that you have somehow left behind in this mad rat race or in the quest to achieve something that brings quantified satisfaction. We are forgetting how to stare at nature or at the playing kittens, how to pluck an aromatic flower or to play with the leaves while humming a rabindrasangeet. All these thoughts suddenly rushed back into my otherwise confused and pre-occupied head and teleported me couple of decades back when I was a little kid and used to make clay idols and spend afternoons reading Bengali ghost stories! Lokahaar takes you back to your roots – that’s the definition of this eatery to me! I have never seen a restaurant so homely, so much grounded. There is honesty sculpted in every brick of this peaceful and serene ‘Bangali’ restaurant. There are no flashy stuffs, no marketing gimmicks, no strategically served dishes (in lesser quantity) and no indifferent servers (forget about the owner) like you get in most renowned eateries across the city, or maybe across the country. Here the owner Mr. Basudev Ghatak is one exceptionally humble and gem of a person who loves cooking and gets immense satisfaction if his guests like the food that has been served.

Frankly speaking I was touched since no where in the city I experienced such personal care and homely treatment in a restaurant, maybe because this place is way more than just another restaurant. It stresses on the lost glory and cultural traits that we disregard these days. It tries to unify Lok-Krishti, Lok-Shilpo, Lok-Sanskriti and finally Lok-Ahaar. This means it tries to bring together various aspects of our rural life - like the daily work of a farmer, the regular art and craft work that is being produced at various rural areas, the different cultural events that are still going strong in the remote villages all across Bengal or maybe in the neighboring states, and finally the food - that has got its origin in rural undivided Bengal – here comes the term Lokaahar that signifies the age-old dishes which maybe our grand parents or great grand parents used to have regularly but very rapidly they are vanishing from our plates and from our kitchens. But before they vanish from our minds or memories of our tastebuds, Lokaahar tries to step forward to save this amazing dishes and old rural cultures and art forms. This is an effort which first needs to be applauded. And then we can delve deep into the details of the interior décor and other elements that build this place.

The place is located in a serene para (locality) of Jodhpur Park and if you are near South City Mall then you can take the alley beside the Leder land shop (opposite South City) to reach this place. It is infact the ground floor of a typical south Kolkata house that has been converted to this eatery with utmost care. The iron gate has welded art forms that depicts the four aspects (Lok-Krishti, Lok-Shilpo, Lok-Sanskriti and Lok-Ahaar) which has been discussed above. We find the fourth aspect ‘Lokahaar’ is further depicted in details when we step inside the eatery. The hand painted figurines (poto-chitro) and floral designs on the walls along the framework of the door will surely grab your attention. The paintings have been done by a rural painter couple who came down to Kolkata only for this purpose. The paintings depict various stages of a countryside Bengali marriage and how it used to be, it shows the shikaar porbo or the hunting activity, the celebrations and processions, the paalki ride, and then the ‘paat pere khawa dawa porbo’ or the feasting episode where everyone is enjoying the food that is being served at the wedding ceremony where everyone is seated on the floor in a line like it used to be at rural weddings years back; the servers are serving with buckets in their hand that contain the food - maybe dal, curry or rice. All these pictures make me feel so pleased deep inside, they are so calm, so peaceful, and so much rooted. The walls are painted in a typical clay color with two shades that give this place the perfect feel along with those wall paintings. Them comes the tables where you dine and the chairs along with it. Both have been curved from solid and heavy wood and have been prepared by skilled artisans from Burdwan. It just can’t get more authentic! But the glass top with these finely crafted tables somehow goes really well but I guess typical wooden top with more paintings on it could have been more interesting, though that might have been bit difficult to maintain and clean. The entrance has more interesting elements that interest me - like the colored glass walls or the Tulsi plant that’s near the gate. The dining area is basically divided into two rooms including the living room portion.

There is one room which is basically an office but it is a treasure trove for a collector who is interested in collecting rural decorative items and food items from distant villages, etc. But this section is basically to promote the artists and talents from far-away villages who have produced such gems, and there is almost no margin to make profit from this section. The owner Mr. Ghatak also said that they wish to go to the distant villages and record local folk or baul songs and bring the recordings back to play them in his restaurant, this is such an innovative idea and I hope I will be back soon and then this amazing background music will be playing.

Now let us discuss a bit about the food which is surely the showstopper at this place. It gives you reasons to come back to this place again and again. I was invited with couple of my Panch phoron team members to taste the Poila Boishakh dishes. The place has got nearly 100 food items on its regular menu, out of which they have carefully selected 40 items for Poila Boishakh. And we were served few of these items from the special menu. Here are the items we tried –

•	Aam porar Shorbot – This is not a new drink to us, but the preparation here spelled magic with the first sip. The mild refreshing appetizing drink had solid mango pulps and pieces in it that was great to have besides sipping the optimally dense juice. Perfect one to order for if you are in on a hot summer day, the correct mix of spices in there will build your appetite and overall it will cool you down and help you settle down real fast.

•	Bhaat (steamed rice) – Mr. Ghatak had already informed us that he stocks different varieties of rice from various parts of the state and beyond (including black rice from Manipur) which are also for sale and these go out of stock real fast. That really speaks volume about the premium quality of rice we were served, the quantity of rice served was more than sufficient, which were perfectly prepared to go with Bengali curries and dal.

•	Shuktoh – Truly speaking I stay away from shukto since I do not like a bitter tasting dish, I know it’s my weird personal opinion and many do love shukto which is perfectly fine. But here I was pleasantly surprised to taste it, it was bit bitter but the strong aroma of ghee and other ingredients eclipsed the notion that I had with shuktos, in general. It was surprisingly very flavorful and I was blown away with the first morsel, Mr.Ghatak was extremely pleased when he found a satisfied smile on my face after tasting this dish! The generous amount of veggies, ghee and posto in there made it taste heavenly. This is a must try dish!

•	Narkoler Daal – Again a flavorful basic Bengali dish that had no flaw in it, the proportion of grated coconut in it was just perfect, the aroma was perfect, the density was perfect, everything was amazing! And yes, I ate one full plate of rice with this dal, so you can well imagine its taste now!

•	Aloo Bhaja – And yes, the one plate of rice with dal was aptly accompanied by thinly sliced fried potato or as we call it, jhhur jhhure aloo bhaja. It was very crisp and tasty and there was a sprinkle of chaat masala on it making it exponentially flavorful.

•	Echorer Dalna – Oh boy I loved this, I know I am repeating the same words but seriously I can’t help myself. All the dishes were cooked so well. The jackfruits were well cooked and cut into small pieces, the gravy was bit rich and spicy, but not too oily or soggy. The proportion of garam masala was just right and I felt like tasting some chicken or mutton dish, just too good!

•	Dhokar Dalna – This dish was served specially for my vegetarian friend but I tasted a bit of this and found the doka was extremely fresh and soft, the gravy was again tasty and had sipped well inside the pieces of dhoka. Nice option for vegetarians.

•	Bori diye Pabda Maachh er jhol – The big piece of fresh pabda fish was awaiting for my first bite when I realized this is another gem of a preparation! The well cooked gravy with well soaked bori was dense and packed with flavors, since the fishes are bought daily so they were found to be very fresh and the garnishing with coriander leaves and overall presentation was also top notch.

•	Aamer Chatni – It was served in a cute little bowl. The chutney was not too runny and neither too thick, just the perfect density to be honest. The piece of mango was tangy and fleshy and the dish was sweet and sour, it had just the right amount of sweetness according to my old-school tastebuds!

•	Kaalo Chaal er Paayesh – This was an out-of-the-box dish to add some punch to the whole meal. I had never tasted this before, it is prepared by cooking black Manipuri rice (which is soaked in water overnight) with milk and sugar in it, The milk is boiled again and again so that it thickens and forms a semi liquid substance with the boiled black rice in it. We could still feel the rice when we had this dish, it was still not over-boiled. Overall the taste is subtle, not overtly sweet with a nice aroma and taste. Really an innovative sweet dish. You should try it if you visit Lokahaar.

But one thing is for sure, it is better to book your table and menu by calling them an hour ago, or even better if you can call a day ahead your visit. All the dishes are cooked after you place the order. The vegetables, meat and fish are bought everyday in the morning, so if you do not book in beforehand you might feel annoyed finding your favorite item is not available.

As I said above, apart from these few items there are many items there for the Poila Boishakh menu, also there is INR 649 all inclusive buffet menu (available from 14th till 24th April), here are the items –

Aam Panna, Sada bhaat, Polao, Lal Shaak, Kumro fuler bora, Narkol koraishutir mug dal, Alur dom, Potol bhaja, Echor dalna, Bhetki Bhapa, Chicken/Mutton Kosha, Chutney, Papad, Mishti Doi/Kalo Chaler payesh, Dorbesh/Mihidana.

Overall, at Lokahaar it is recognized that it’s not only the taste that matters but it is also the ingredients that go in to those recipes making them more memorable. The team takes pride in carefully selecting each of these ingredients from the wholesale market to give you the fresh taste and the genuine experience of authentic Bengali cuisine! For people coming first time to Kolkata and looking for a great joint to taste the local Bengali food, this is your place to be, you will straight-away be introduced to the basic age-old dishes of Bengal, the dishes, the food which were shown in the old Bengali movies. People of this generation haven’t even tasted everything which our grandfathers used to relish in their meal. Remember the scene where Tenida was gorging on Bengali dishes in the movie Charmurti? The sheer innocence and love for food displayed in those few minutes portrays the true love for food still present in a Bengali and with these basic age-old dishes vanishing from our menu it’s really concerning, to say the least. Hopefully Lokahaar can stop this golden elements of Bengal and these golden dishes of Bengal from fading away. I wish Mr.Ghatak and the entire team of Lokahaar the very best and I am sure soon people will realize the essence of Lokahaar and the authenticity of the dishes it offers!

I wish everyone happy dining at Lokahaar, try their Poila Boishakh menu and try their various interesting dishes and stunning flavors that will amaze you everytime, hope you keep on hogging like Tenida at this place! Surely no one wants to be like Pyalaram who is left only with ‘potol diye singhi maacher jhol’ and ‘bashok patar rosh’!! :)

Cheers!

Noboborsho special Lunch @ Lokaahar
 
Lately a number of Bengali styled eateries have opened up in the city of joy. Some have opened up subsidiary branches, some ventured out into caterings, while some have opted to remain stand-alone outlets serving the food under a single roof. Lokaahar belongs to the last category. Located inside the quiet if not quaint neighborhood of Jodhpur park, Lokaahar has been dishing out delectable dishes of Bengali cuisines for the last year or so. The consistency in the quality is what has brought this restaurant a name in the foodie map of Kolkata.

As the name suggests this restaurant focuses on the aahar of the lok, i.e. the dishes found predominantly in the corners of the greater Bengal. Not only that, it also tries to bring in the flavours of rural Bengal's work,arts,handicrafts & culture into the eating part. This is evident from the decor of the restaurant, where poto-chitro adornes the walls. Even the colour of the walls & ceiling resembles clay-washed earthen houses of the villages. Also you will find handicrafts & items on sale sourced from farmers/artists of distant villages. Overall the vibe truly gives you the feel of a place which isn't gonna dissapoint. Even the furnitures have been sourced from Burdwan. The amount of effort that has been put in is truely remarkable & appreciable.

Recently Panchphoron got an invite to visit the place & try out some amazing dishes from their upcoming Noboborsho menu. Their regular menu consists nearly a hundred items, Forty from which has been hand-picked keeping in mind the type of foods,we, the bengalis love to have to celebrate the onset of the Bengali new year. This special Noboborsho menu will be available from april 14th to april 24th this year.
 
Below given is a short review of the foods we tried during our visit.

1. Aam pora Sorbot:
As we took our seats, we were greeted with glasses of very refreshing Aam Pora Sorbot. A very popular summer drink prepared from roasted green mangoes along with select spices, this has always been one of my favorite drinks to beat the unbearable summer heat. The drink was flavorful, & the chunks of mango in the glass added to the charm.

2. Bhaat:
The quantity of the rice was sufficient, the aroma perfect. Also note, They procure the finest of rices from all over Bengal. Their claim of stocking nearly thirty types of rice including Tulai Panji,Kalnunia,Swarnachur is prety commendable.

3. Shukto:
Hands down this shukto was better than any shukto I've had had over the past years, be it at home, or outside. Not very bitter, with a sweet note , the veggies tasted great, the poppy seed paste & added ghee also enhanced the flavor. I am not very fond of anything remotely associated with shukto, but eventually ended up having more than one serving.

4. Narkol diye daal:
This item needs no introduction. The lentils were optimally cooked, & with added coconut tasted all the more flavorful.

5. Aloo Bhaja:
The jhuri aloo bhaja, or deep fried fine juliens of potato is always a hit among the bengalis. The twist of adding chaat masala in place of rock salt made it all the more better.

6. Echorer Dalna:
Prepared from green jackfruit this too was really great. Infact the way it is cooked, it can easily replace a non-veg dish.

7. Dhokar Dalna:
This one too tasted amazing. The cubes of Dhoka were soft, yet not soggy, & the gravy tasted great.

8. Bori diye Pabda maacher jhol:
Its no point saying every dish was amazing. It suffices to say that everyone loved it. Do note the fish is sourced fresh each day. Inspite of the best efforts by the team, sometimes some items may or may not be available. So please place your order beforehand.

9. Aamer Chatni:
Chutney is something without which a bengali meal is incomplete. In fact the bengali waord is derived from 'chata' which literelly means licking, as in finger licking good. It was sweet, it was tangy, it was just perfect.

10. Kaalo Chaaler Payes:
This is something I never had before. Prepared from black sticky rice this one's a unique dessert. The milk is cooked till it attains the consistency of thick kheer. The rice is cooked along with it,seeping in the goodness of the milk, ultimately becoming the perfect ending to a great meal.

Overall had a great time trying out the items. Relished each & every item. A Bengali meal is best enjoyed with bare fingers, & not spoons/forks, & you are left licking your fingers afterwards. Kudos to the team at lokaahar for being able to provide such great food at reasonable prices. As I mentioned earlier, the fish & veggies are procured fresh everyday & cooked only after an order is placed. So it's advice able you call & place your order around an hour before you visit, else you'll have to wait.

So book your tables & embark on a delightfully delicious culinary experience.
Happy Eating,
Cheers.

Located near south city mall. Decorated beautifully with Bengal's art. Went there with mom on a weekday afternoon. Had a little trouble to find the restaurant without GPS. They welcomed us with ampora sorbot ! We had echorer kofta , chitoler jhal , dhonia tangra along with rice and salad. Food was delicious , enjoyed it. Staff's are very humble and friendly. Felt very homely :)

Pithe Puli Festival (Utsaav) at Lokahaar

Fall head over heels for Lokahaar, the newest Bengali restaurant that has landed on our shores! This new-fangled Bengali food joint Lokahaar had organized its first Pithe Puli Utsaav at its flagship outlet between 15th January, 2016 to 21st January, 2016 to mark its inception and meet the appreciation of its esteemed customers. Situated at 533, Jodhpur Park, which is a prime Bengali locality, Lokahaar is a 30 seated restaurant stretched across 700 sqft, which also offers exotic strains of rice, organic honey and ghee. They pride in promoting artisans, handmade spices and handicrafts from different districts of Bengal.

We had a horrible experience with Lokaahar. We saw the reviews in Zomato and order dinner for around 8 invitees at our place. while taking order they said the total bill is Rs.3700 but when the delivery boy came he charged Rs.5600!! We had to fight with the delivery boy who wanted to prove he is innocent. May be he was innocent but whoever has altered the bill is absolutely dishonest and basically destroying the goodwill of Lokaahar. At the end we ended up paying Rs.4000 which was again more than what we should have paid. But just to solve the fight we closed it there! On top of that the size of ilish fish was very tiny and also our guests were not satisfied with the food taste and quality.  This was our first time we ordered from Lokaahar which turned out to be pathetic. We would never recommend them to any of our friends and relatives.

back went to this place reading the Zomato reviews and still regret why I went there.
Yes I'm still disgusted with this place and want to warn people about visiting this place.This place has the typical character of a bong antel….the great intellectual who reads the reviews of a book but never reads one.
Bland food badly cooked. Only mug dal was good.Postor bada was hard worth replacing dang gull. Posto peyaj was smelling of raw onions.Even the mangsho was bad.  You ask for begun bhaja they bring you beguni.The service slow n unprofessional. Only the place is big.

Went to this place on an invitation…This place is located inside a lane near Jodhpur Park so please follow the Zomato map in case you don’t know this area well…. On entering,it gave a very nice “old Calcutta” feeling for it’s decor…An imagery of the wooden signs used to display it’s name pinned to a tree and the building takes you back to old lanes…

Tasting Invitation for ‘Boshonter Thali’ i.e. Meal of Spring Season @ Lokaahar, Jodhpur Park, Kolkata :)

Tucked away, in a quaint lane of Jodhpur Park, rests this 30 seater, authentic Bengali Cuisine restaurant called, ‘Lokaahar’ i.e. food of the common people. Sans any fusion, or frilly presentation, Mr. Basudeb Ghatak, the proud owner of this eatery, claims to have opened this place on 10th Oct, 2015, for the sole purpose of reviving and enjoying, not only authentic Bengali food, but also, farming, artifacts and culture.

To promote farming, he stocks - assorted varieties of rice from different districts of West Bengal, popular honey of Sunderbans, organic soaps etc. For artifacts, he maintains a collection of miniatures, pertaining to bengal schools of arts and crafts. For culture, he aims to survey and record, various popular instrumentals and songs from rural Bengal. He feels that, what circulates in the name of ‘Bengali’ culture, is just a scratch on the surface!

His passion for ‘simple, original and rural’ is evident in the décor of this 700 square feet eatery, which is built inside an old residential structure, and thus, it has high ceiling and d/c electricity lines. The place is divided into three rooms, two for eating, and one for shopping. Eating rooms have - old age mosaic floorings, and their walls are colored in grey and peach. Portions of walls are hand painted in Mehndipur Pattachitra form of art, depicting nature, scenes from ‘Ramayana’ etc. The outer eating room has metallic light structures hanging from the ceiling, while the inner eating room has false and flat ceiling with small spotlights. The inner room also showcases a framed collection of miniature doodles. Tables and chairs are straight lined, wooden and woven with ‘babui ghas’ i.e. a strong variety of grass, which resembles jute. Legs of tables are slightly carved and beautifully painted in shades of red, yellow, green and white, in such a manner, that they look like figurines. This artistry is exclusively found in Notun Gram of Burdwan District. Table tops are made of thick glass sheets. The shopping room has two big open cupboards, strewn with assorted organic lifestyle products. This room also has a LED TV, and an official big table, surrounded with chairs, as it doubles as the owner’s office.

The vegetarian options in the ‘Boshonter Thali’ consisted of –

Aam Pora Shorbot: Also known as Aam Panna, this thirst quencher was sweet and tangy, and more than enough in quantity.

Kumro Phuler Boda, Bok Phuler Boda, and
Shojne Phuler Boda: These were fritters made of assorted seasonal flowers. You rarely find them in home as well as restaurant cookings. It was an opportunity to taste these authentic flower based recipes. All the Bodas were well made and differently shaped. However, it was difficult to detect any distinct fragrance or taste.  

Saada Bhaat: The steamed rice was well
cooked and presented like an inverted bowl. All the grains were separate. 

Kaju Kishmish Polao: It was also presented like rice. Its taste was on the sweeter side, and it was pretty aromatic. Even the dry fruits – cashews and raisins, were present in abundance.

Shukto: It was a mixed sabji, inclusive of ‘badis’. It was non spicy, and tasted very nice.

Moong Dal with Narkel: The dal was thick and had a nice coconut aroma. It also had small cauliflower florets. It tasted nice.

Choto Aloor Dum: It was a spicy preparation of small spherical potatoes. The spices were well balanced.

Choto Echorer Dalna: It was again a spicy preparation of ‘desi kathal’ or small sized jackfruit and diced potatoes. It was the spiciest of all the curries, and tasted nice. Very few cooks can cococt a nice jackfruit curry, without making the spices overpowering.

Dhonkar Daalna: This curry had steamed ‘barfi’ shaped dumplings of pulses. It was filling, and tasted very nice.

Mochar Ghonto: It was concoction of banana plantation florets. It had lots of visible oil, and could have been presented better.

Kooler Chaatni: It was a chutney, made of a seasonal plum, called ‘kool’.

Rasogolla: It was soft, fresh, syrupy, and had a nice and subtle taste of jaggery.

It needs mentioning that, all the three Bodas, Choto Aloor Dum, Choto Echorer Dalna and Kooler Chutney were made of seasonal plant produce, and thus, exclusive to ‘Boshonter Thali’.

‘Lokaahar’ also has - loo facility, ample parking space, and home delivery service. In fact, its home delivery service is already quite popular, in the neighborhood.

The waiters are humble and earnest.

All in all, it’s an economic and authentic eatery, which dishes out delectable Bengali wares, with enough options for vegetarians!

Price of Boshonter Thali: Rs. 400/-

Availability of Boshonter Thali: Till March end.

A true gem of a restaurant. Delectable bengali dishes, ones which have long been stopped preparing at home. Been here twice. The combination of bhaat (rice), jhuro aloo bhaja (potato fries) and ghee warms the cockles of your heart. Also tried the tel koi, mocha, posto chicken and pulao. Each as good as the other. A special mention to the paramount sherbet. A cool drink especially nice for the summer. The staff are very helpful and efficient. Overall, a wonderful place to have good Bangali food.

One fine day I was caught by surprise by Zomato when a voucher for Lokaahar was couriered to me at home. Delighted as I was, I quickly searched for this new place on Zomato and couldn’t help but be impressed by the positive reviews from fellow foodies. The voucher recommended that the restaurant be called up 24 hours in advance with the orders but I’d called in only 2 hours before turning up and they were absolutely fine with that.

Lokaahar is situated pretty near Abar Baithak; just take the third by lane to your left once you’re in the street opposite to Tandoor Park. The restaurant emanating a very homely vibe, was comprised of three medium-sized nicely decorated rooms giving away that it was once someone’s house. We were welcomed warmly on arriving, a bit late for lunch and hence ended up being the only diners until Anindya Chatterjee of Chandrabindoo turned up with an acquaintance, a few minutes later. 

Our orders comprised of Chhanar Dalna, Chittol Machher Muitha, Mutton Dakbangla and Kooler Chutney along with plain rice. The first thing which struck me was the quality and quantity of rice they provide. They use Basmati rice of a real good quality which had a nice odor and a single plate had enough rice to satiate two people (but we were very hungry so had to order a half plate extra). The chhanar dalna had proper blocks of homemade cottage cheese unlike the readymade paneer that some restaurants use for this dish which becomes quite meaningless. While I loved the creamy consistency of the chhana, the gravy was a bit too sour for my liking. 

The star dish of the day was definitely the chittol machher muitha. That was the best muitha I have EVER had.  So, people who all are reading my review and contemplating about a visit to this place and are also fish lovers, MUST, MUST try this dish out and you can thank me later. The four cylindrical blocks of boneless fish were perfectly done with just the right amount of chewiness and flavors to make you sigh in contentment after the very first bite. The gravy was spot on as well. 

The mutton dak bangla was simply done sans too much oil or spices. We just felt that the dish could’ve made space for some more salt and seasoning. Otherwise, it tasted fine. And oh, I LOVED each and every dish with the rice. The consistency of boiled rice can make or break any dish for a Bengali foodie and Lokaahar made sure that their rice enhanced the flavor of every item they serve, making it ten folds more enjoyable. 

Lastly, we finished off with kooler chutney which was basically a TINY bowl having four ripened kools on a bed of a very sugary thick syrup. I had no complaints with it except for the fact that they could’ve served some more of the chutney in a bigger bowl. 

The manager greeted us on arrival and made it a point to visit our table once or twice to make sure everything was fine. The servers were extremely well mannered, informative and helpful. A special mention goes out to the washroom. They have properly maintained a very hygienic washroom with all the necessary elements like hand wash and paper towels. Overall, we are super impressed and super happy with this place, enough to make us visit again. They serve great food of awesome quality for very reasonable prices. It’s only a few months old and it’s already making its way through the hearts of some serious foodies all over Kolkata!

A total surprise in all respects. I couldn't find any flaw and no reason why I cant add this place to my collection. "Badir Khabar" is the term which I can refer to while recommending this place. Although I am not much into Bengali cuisine beacuse I am vegetarian but became a fan after visiting this place as they had plethora of veg options.
Let me start with the desserts.
Chandana kheer : Had no idea that kheer could be served in a "matki" with such an authentic taste. A sweet paste containing dry fruits, kesar, milk(obviously) is a must have dish to end your food spree here.
My friend ordered Bhetkir bhapa and 1/2 plate rice (serves two as quantity is quite a bit). She loved every bit of it and asked me to recommend it in my review.
Kodaishutir Kochuri and kosha Aalor dum : A famous dish at this place and the quantiity is enough to serve 2. Abundant kodaishuti filling and aloor dom made it a deadly combo. A must have in Bengali cuisine since ages.

In starter we ordered Mochar chop.
A delicate balance of boiled banana flower with the sweetness from raisins, pungency from ginger and crunch from the deep fried outer coating. Sublime use of spices brings the whole thing together and lives upto the expectation.
Decor: Very nicely decorared shelves with artefacts and show pieces. The theme of this place is village art (hastha shilp). Same is maintained in the designing of walls,tables and chairs.
Ambience: Locality is less noisy. The restaurant is clean, spacious, enough seating space and a large 55 inch tv : a combination of entertainment,art and food.

Service: Cordial and friendly staff. The owner is open to any suggestions and would surely ask you about the servings.
You want to know more. Its the cheapest as the rates are inclusive of tax. Beat that.
What more can you ask for.
Do make this your next stop.

To begin with this is not your average restaurant. If you visit the place without prior booking, chances are high you won't like the experience. Because, though they have an elaborate menu, they operate mainly on made to order model. So, you won't find all the items without pre-booking. Also it would take time. So, if you have just decided to go for a lunch / dinner within the next hour or so, give it a skip. If you are the one who loves to plan a meal sometimes, read on.

I was using a gift voucher from Zomato and in it was clearly written to book the table with menu 24 hours in advance. So I called them up a day before and placed my order. The person who received the call was very helpful.

The place is beautifully done with folk motifs and handicrafts. They also have a separate room where several handicrafts, spices, honey etc. are kept on display for purchase. Even if you are not hungry, you can visit the place for these.

The service was excellent. Attentive and personal. They were also all ears when we shared our suggestions.

Now coming to the main part - food. Our order was as below - 

Koraishutir Kochuri  -  Not impressed with this one. The filling was not enough
Kosha Alur Dom      -  Loved it. Perfect balance of spices
Kumro Phuler Bora   - The batter here was the problem. It killed the subtleness of the flowers
Bhetki Machher Bora - Excellent
Bati Posto                 - Excellent again. A must try for posto lovers.
Kochu Bata               - This was good.
Hasher Dimer Dalna  - Excellent again. Loved the gravy. 
Mourola Tok             - This was also good. Most would love it. But I personally love my tok a bit more sour.
Robibarer Mangsho  - Simple and beautiful home style mutton.
Pomfret Jhaal            - This was ok. The gravy was not bad, not even special.
Chandana Kheer       - Another excellent dish and a perfect way to end a satisfying meal.

In all we loved the lunch. The amount served was huge, so had to pack most of the items. 

I will definitely go back to try more dishes.

Are you too busy to cook at home?? Are you a fan of Bengali cuisine?? Do you want to tickle your taste buds with traditional Bengali recipes?? Or, you just want to have lunch or dinner with your family in a quaint Bengali restaurant??
  
    This restaurant is your one stop solution!!!
  
    I was invited to this joint through "Panch Phoron" group for a food tasting. It was an invitation for dinner on a weekday for introduction of "Bashanter Thaali" to welcome the spring season.

   It is located at jodhpur park, 6-7 min walking distance from jodhpur park post office or sugar and spice,close to Allahabad Bank.
  
   The owner Mr. Basudev Ghatak explained the theme and concept of the restaurant.  Traditional art and culture of Bengal has been focused here.
                The painters or patuas are called for drawing colorful 'patachitra' on surrounding of doors and windows. This patachitra is a type of folk art from west Midnapore. Each chitra or painting tells a story. Otherwise, the décor is very simple. Plain white or biscuit colored wall. But I loved those wooden dark brown chairs and tables with colorful small idols carved on the legs and back of the chairs-- a touch of rural art. The jute ropes have been used instead of cushion on chairs. The upper part of the table is again covered with jute ropes with a glass on top. 

  And we were surprised seeing a huge collection of folk art including forest products(honey from sunderban), several types of rice grain (for example tulaipanji),terracotta, dhokra, tribal masks etc. All of these items are for sell.

Now coming to the food---
  
  We were served with welcome drinks first. It was rose lassi. Pink colored, chilled and sweet lassi in rose flavour tasted great and thirst quenching indeed. And the bright 'abir' color symbolises the heralding of spring too.

We were served a thaali comprising several items- a combination of lunch and dinner. The ingredients of few recipes are available only during this spring season.

1.Rice of long thin grains-- properly boiled,white in color and each grain is separated from each other.

2.Shukto-- an essentially important and must have starter for all bengalis. The bitterness was balanced well with vegetables but bori was missing. So it could have been more rich in taste.

3.Bok phul bora-- crispy, well fried and tasted great.

4.Sojney phul bora-- a symbol of spring for all bengalis. Amazing taste, crumbly but soft.

5.Kumro phul bora-- again scrumptious,outer covering was thin and inside was soft but crisp.

6.Shona mugh daal-- bright yellow coloured green(though) gram lentil as the name says. Yummy and goes perfectly with all the boras.

7.Basanti Pulao--golden yellow colored well boiled rice with cashews and raisins, slightly sweet and tasty ofcourse.

8.Chhoto aloor dam-- a bit spicy and tasty dish of newly harvested small potatoes.

9.Echorer dalna-- small,unripened,green jack fruit in small pieces. Though I'm not a fan of this dish but here i just loved it and i would say that it's synonymous to mutton for all vegetarians.

10.Chicken kosha-- delicious chicken dish. It has a touch of home-made flavour and was in sink with the pulao. Fish and mutton(pathar mangsho) were also available instead of chicken.

11.Kooler chaatni-- sweet and sour chaatni of laal topa kool,a symbol of the season again. 

12.Notun gurer payesh-- I am sceptical about payesh and usually don't have it outside since I'm very particular about the sweetness, consistency and taste of this Bengali dessert. But here i just loved it. It was delectable with perfectly balanced sweetness and thickness.

At last, the thaali is very reasonably priced. It is rs.400/- only inclusive of all tax. Service is good.

P.S. The owner shared some recipes with me since he knows all the recipes and he can cook. I loved it.

When we think of themed restaurants, we mostly think of the props used in its décor – cars, bikes, kettles, this and that! Lokahaar, a restaurant themed around Bengali Community life, isn’t just like any of those themed restaurants, and I would say it goes far beyond to actually become a Curated Concept Restaurant. 

Mr Basudev Ghatok, its owner, conceptualized it around the four pillars of Bengali Community Life - Loka-Kristi (Community Collective Produce), Loka-Sanskriti (Community Culture), Loka-Shilpa (Community Art) and Loka-Ahar (Community Dining). Nestled in the ground floor of a house in Jodhpur Park, the moment I entered, Pritha explained the motifs on the iron grill of the entrance door, representing each of these – Rice Grain Harvest, Auspicious Owl, Bengali Music, and Fish, respectively.

And it doesn’t end with the décor, like I said. To showcase the rich produce from Bengal, Mr Ghatok has collected rice grains from various parts of Bengal in one room, and in another, he has curated handicrafts and other organic produces like Honey, Pickle and Badi, from folk- artists and artisans in Bengal – all for sale. All the doors have hand-painted Bengal Scroll Paintings, or Poto-Chitro, each representing a complete scroll of festivities of Bengali life – marriage, feast, birth, and such. All the furniture are made with Jute works, interspersed with colourful wood-works representing motifs from Bengali Puppet Art Form.

To eat Bengali food in a standard Bengali food restaurant is one thing, but to have it at a place so deeply immersed in spirit of Bengali Community Life, beautifully inter-woven conceptually through everything from the décor to curated collections, is another experience, and quite a unique one – and one, you shouldn’t miss out on !

The food, of course, is great! Keeping in line with food centered around seasonal produce, Lokahar has introduced its Basonter Thali, in addition to the standard offerings, to celebrate the Local Spring Produce. Lokahar intends to continue celebrating seasonal food and festivals throughout the year – so it is a good idea to check with the restaurant for its special menu anytime one visits or orders in.

The Basonter Thali, priced all inclusive at Rs 400, consists of seasonal Kumroh Phooler Bora, Shojne Phooler Bora, and Choto Echorer Dalna, Kuul-er Chatni, Nalen-Gur er Payesh, along with standard non-seasonal Bengali favourites, consisting of Rice, Pulao, Shukto, Choto Alur Dum, Shona Mugh Daal, Kosha Mangsh (Chicken or Mutton) or Fish. Lokahar has collaborated with Paramount Sherbats, a legendary Bengali place in itself, for drinks, and welcome drink I was served was the Green Mango Sherbat, using Paramount’s special recipe.

I loved everything in the thali – but my heart was stolen by the Shojne Ful-er Bora and the Payesh, which was outstanding. My only issue was with the Kumroh phule-r bora, which is Pumpkin Flower Fritters fried in Besan batter, which issue I have with every Besan Batter Fries. Besan is sort of a very strong ingredient, which doesn’t let the subtle taste of a flower come out. I usually prefer fries like Kumroh Phol and Bok Phul, in a lighter and neutral batter, made out of equal parts of Corn-flour, Maida and Rice Powder, added with a bit of Kalo Jeera and Oil.

If you ask me what sets aside Lokahar meal from any other standard Bengali food restaurant, I would tell that Lokahar doesn’t make the very ‘Biye-Bari-r Ranna’ style of rich, dripping-with-oil food, that has become common in restaurants, or the “Ghorowa Ranna’, which is made at home, usually characterized by watery jhols, and less spice. Instead, what Lokahaar does is the very home-style ‘Utsab-er Ranna’ – representing community dining, with large quantities of food made at home with many helping hands, to celebrate festivities - from the usual Sundays, Home-Coming of Guests and Family Members, Saraswati Puja, Dol Purnima, Kali Puja and such – where the food is strangely the most delicious version of home-food, enough oil but not oily, enough spiced but not stomach upsetting spiced. Mr Ghotok himself mentioned fondly, that his love for cooking came from cooking and feeding large groups of friends and family on special occasions, and when he did turn to starting a restaurant, it clearly shows that he did train his staff to cook in the same style.

Daniel Kahneman, a man unrelated to anything Bengali, and whose claim to fame has been to win a Nobel Prize in Economics for behavioral psychology, conceptualized the Peak-End Rule, where he concluded that people judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak (i.e., its most intense point, like my eating Sajne Phul er Bora or the Payesh) and at its end (like wrapping up the meal by washing fingers at the wash basin) rather than based on the total sum or average of every moment of the experience. Nearly every good food I have had at Indian Food Restraurants which call for food being eaten by hand, has ended with a horrible experience of walking up to the wash basin that has runy taps and are clogged with small soap bars, or worse still, a semi-clean washroom entirely. At times, finger bowls and tissues have helped, but anyone who eats in the ‘Kabji Dubiye Style’, knows that neither finger bowl or tissues really clean the smell of Haldi and Sorshe Bata leave the fingers. This place has huge hand-wash area – separate from wash room, extremely clean, well lit, and beautifully decorated with brick colour tiles, unlike any other place that I have visited in Calcutta. For people like me that live in the perpetual paranoia of unclean washrooms, this has been the greatest end to a great meal!

One of the very few places which serves true Bengali cuisine. I have visited the place twice.
The interior decoration is very unique. It clearly reflects the essence of Bengal.
The hospitality of the staff is excellent. I'll give them 5/5 in this section. 
Coming to the food....  The main thing which I loved is they are working with the lost recipes of Bengali cuisine, which you won't get in other restaurants. 
They prepare the food after taking the order. So you have to give them a bit more time. 
If you are planning a get together with your friends or family.. You should think about this place..though I'll suggest to book your table prior and to place the food order. 
:)

This place serves good food.. I ordered dal shukno, mochar ghanta,chital macher muithia mutton dakbunglow .. The spice was perfectly balanced., and service was bit Slow.. Only let down was the thumsup which was flat.. However they replaced it when we pointed out..the bill was just rs700 for 2 persons.. The ambiance has a bengali theme.. They also sell some gift items which are unique..
I will come to this place again.

Lokaahar not only excels in Bengali dishes but is also a representation of the cultural heritage of Bengal. For the ones who are in search of some homely Bengali food, this is best place in the city !

Lokaahar is on the same lane of jodhpur park where abar baithak is. I was invited here through Panchphoron group for a food tasting event. The decor is amazing! Mr Ghatak explained to us every detail of the place. The walls have pictorial representation of various scenes in the life of Bengali. There are two rooms for dine in, with an accommodation capacity of around 30 people. There is a seperate room where handicrafts made by specially abled children are displayed and are put up for sale! A good initiative! Also they sell various types of rice, bought from different districts of Bengal, at a very nominal price.

Coming to the food, we started with Rose lassi. It was a highly refreshing drink. Then we had the newly introduced Bosontor thali in the menu. The sukto was very good with fresh veggies, though it lacked bori. The Moong dal, served to us had a rich creamy texture, unlike the more watery version we are used to having at home. To accompany it, there were three seasonal boras of kumro phool, bok phool and sojne phool. All three were amazing and tasted great with the dal! The polao was good and with it we had alur dum, echorer dalna and chicken kasha. Each dish was brilliant and had a distinct flavour. A special mention to the alur dum and the chicken kasha which were light yet tasty.

We were full with this when we were served the traditional Bengali desserts- kool er chatni and payesh. The kool er chatni was highly impressive. Also the payesh wasn't much sweet which I liked. It was after a long time I had such an amazing Bengali dinner with every dish cooked to perfection.

This seasonal thali is priced at just 400 bucks and is valid till 31st March. Also, one can choose from fish or mutton instead of chicken kosha. So, the ones reading this review, go and grab it !

Went to this place on an invitation by PanchPhoron...This place is located inside a lane near Jodhpur Park so please follow the Zomato map in case you don't know this area well...

On entering,it gave a very nice "old Calcutta" feeling for it's decor...An imagery of the wooden signs used to display it's name pinned to a tree and the building takes you back to old lanes...

Another very interesting aspect about them is their promotion of handicrafts and artwork...for which they have a completely different section(They sell these artworks as well)...Very few restaurants do we find in Kolkata who not only satisfy your taste buds,but also promote the handicrafts of Bengal!!!A true Bengali restaurant in that sense...

Their decor and furniture particularly impressed me because it reminds me of a typical Bengali house...the flooring is also what one would find in old Calcutta homes!!!They have used jute for their chairs which is again a local product of Bengal...The artwork on the wall is particularly impressive...

Coming to food,we were given the "Boshonter Thali(Spring season Thali)"...which consisted of a combination of their lunch and dinner thalis..

They started off with a welcome drink...which I found a little too sweet for my taste...It was supposed to be "doi er ghol" but I couldn't find any curd in my drink..Mine was too watery...

Then we were given Plain rice(saada bhat)-The rice was of good quality and did not have lumps in it,
accompanied with Shukto-Luckily,this wasn't very bitter and was perfectly cooked..It had ample vegetables which were boiled well and did not form lumps..the only component that I felt missing a bit was "Bori" which actually enhances the taste..

Kumroh Phooler Bora, Bok Phooler Bora,Shojne Phooler Bora,-These were the tasted Boras I've had in a very long time...they were perfectly seasoned and not over fried or burnt...

Choto Alur Dum-The Alu Dum was quite good.

Shona Mugh Daal-This was well cooked and did not have a single uncooked grain,the added ingredients enhanced the flavour of the dal..In fact,I've tasted very few good Daal in restaurants..

Choto Echorer Dalna-Echor isn't particularly my favourite but this one did impress me with it's taste..again perfectly cooked,not too hard or too soft...

Then we were given the yellow Polaayu-The mishti pulao was indeed not too mishti but just perfect for me!!!It had generous amounts of dry fruits which added to it's taste...

Kosha Mangsho-We had Chicken(but there are options for Mutton/Fish)...This was okayish...did not really have the typical Kosha Mangsho taste that one would expect...The pieces that I got were not too good...It seemed like an old chicken and hence too fibrous...I would suggest them to use younger and smaller chickens to get lean meat...

kooler Chaatni-The chatni tasted good and had two "topa kool" in it so no complaints about this whatsoever!!!

Notun Gurer Paayesh-The paayesh was good...not too sweet(which I like)...

All in all,I had a good wholesome Bengali meal after months!!!It's a very good option for all working people who don't get the time to cook so much at home...or in fact,to eat a wholesome meal on weekdays!!!
Also,this thali is ideally recommended for those who have never eaten a "Boshonter Thali" in their life!!!

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION: 

I have been to so many places in my foodie journey and was still waiting for the 4.5 to arrive. Dealt with Indian, chinese, street foods, fast food etc but finally what purely touched me was the pure bengali cuisine at this place. We have got enough places for bengali cuisines around the city but Lokaahar thinks in a different way. Perfectly run and managed by Mr. Ghatak certainly this is the place i fall in love with. Location is a bit difficult to trace but map helps you out with it.Basically it falls in Jodhpur pak. Ways to enter from South City, Jodhpur park as well as jadavpur what you choose depends on you. You don't get a daily households dishes here but more than that which can really make you happy and satisfied. 

AMBIENCE AND SERVICE: 

From the main gate you get some positive vibes in you. Its beautifully setup in the traditional bengali culture which reminds you of  rich cultural heritage of Bengall. The walls being designed with some fine painting arts as well as the ambience is certainly very decent enough. With colourful chairs and fine decoration you gets to see more than food. Not a very big place to be honest but it will keep dragging you back. Coming to the service so the serive was pleasant. The staff were well behaved, polite and quick in their feets.

FOOD AND DRINKS:

It was a fine Invitation from Pritha Sarkar this time all thanks to her. While i enterd inside straight away greeted with a drink. Then finally moved forward to the main table and dining in there. Mr. Ghatak explained us nicely what we were going to have in dinner. So they were as follows: Rice and polaau, Sukto, Kumro phooler bora, Shojne phooler bora, Bok phooler bora, Alu dum, Echorer dalna, Mugh daal and finally Kosha Mangsho.

As the food came to the table i felt just wow in my mind. Bengali dishes have been my favourite always. So continuing ahead the three seasonal Boras were beautifully made. Less in oil and taste was nice.

Sukto was fab. Sliced vegetable in it. The preparation was very good. And the taste was perfect. Just how it should be.

Alu dum was was quite decent. Bengali alu dum never fails to impress me. Followed by the Echorer Dalna which was too impressive again.

Served on the plate with rice first with Mugh daal which made me felt like at home. The combination of mugher dal with the related dishes were just giving me the bengali flavor which i was looking for. 

Pulaao was excellent. it impressed me big time. Much of the time pulaao fails everywhere but Lokaahar gave me the perfect one. The misti taste and the flavor was beautifully coming in the tounge. It was just fabulous with the chicken gravy. It converted the sweet taste into sweet and sour and that made me utter "Daarun".

Chicken on the other hand was superb as well. I tasted the gravy first and It felt homely to me. Being a non bengali i just fall for these taste and different flavors all the time.

Finally ending the best of Bengali food with Kooler chatni which is seasonal as well and beautifully presented and included in the menu with Notun gurer payesh turning the things peaceful at the bottom. 

QNQ AND PRICES:

Quality of all the dishes were no doubt at its best. All thanks to Mr. Ghatak for making sure about all the things stay intact in the plates. Quantity was decent for one. As they are providing with a Thali system named "Bashanter Thali" so the cost is pinched with Rs.400/- till 31st march 2016.

CONCLUSION:

Lokaahar is a must visit for all.  If you are looking for some fine and well presented bengali cuisine then your search ends here. For me if i visit this place again it has to be much more on the table next time for sure. An finally ending with thanks to Ghatak da for such warm welcome and awesome food as well as to my Experienced co-foodie friends Shahbaaz,Devpurna ,ishita,Rajdeep da,Tanwyee,Subham.

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

Lokaahar is an experience one cannot elude. As the name suggests Lokaahar not only offers a top class "Aahaar" (Food) but also an endearing "Aappayon" (Hospitality), the 2 indispensable "A"s that classifies a true Bengali from any other Clan. To me I rate them a generous 5* 

This time when me and my husband decided to host a surprise Anniversary Lunch for my Parents, we were looking for a restaurant closer from our home, yet much alike home, which was accessible easily for my guests and family. Thanks to Zomato I came across Lokaahar and contacted them, being impressed seeing the Pictures & Reviews. Being away from the City, during the planning stages, I had to mostly coordinate over Phone Calls and Whatsapp, ensuring all the arrangements were done with utmost perfection at such a short notice.

As they say the first impression makes the final one, my interaction with Biswajit Babu did leave a lasting impression, who like a perfect Bhadro-lok assured that the occasion will be worth remembrance. Much as was promised, each and every intricacy was minutely looked after, starting from the Cake to Flowers, all was tastefully organized. Having invited almost 20 guests, I had opted for a Preordered Lunch Menu (as also recommended in their Menu Card), for an easy service delivery and yes, it was flawless. When mentioning the Food, Mutton and the Daab Chingri deserves a special mention. While the Freshly fried Luchi, Cholar Dal and Aloodum was absolutely lip-smacking!

Its advisable to walk in prepared with your Preordered lunch as unlike any other Bengali food Chain in Kolkata, their food seems fresh and made to order and not precooked, trust that’s what sets them aside from any other renowned restaurants in the town. One can easily make out the freshness of the food from the taste, texture and fragrance infused with rich aroma and quality par excellence, that each item had to offer.

Do visit Lokaahar with your friends / family, its Finger licking good!

l had visited lokahar on 2 nd February for lunch. I can just tell you that this place has the potential of leaving bhajohari and oh calcutta! far far behind. Coming from background where my sibling is the owner of one of the finest restaurant in dubai... i am a person who can be very choosy with food. Lets go the food first- we ordered luchi,begunbhja and cholar dal followed by paturi, pabdamacher jhaal, daab chingri, murgir mangsho and mutton. Each of the item had its own aroma and taste which mesmerised our entire lunch group(20 people).i cannot get over the daab chingri...the prawns had melted in the coconut and each item was farm fresh.service wise , they were most personal particularly the two waiters who served with smile. bishwarup babus charming personality  added a personal touch to the meal.his observations on minor details are praiseworthy. 
overall excellent service and great food quality

Well after going through some positive reviews in zomato I decided to visit lokaahar on last Sunday for lunch. Located close to jodhpurpark bazar this food joint has a homely deco n plenty of parking space. Coming to the food, I am really disappointed as i found most of all dishes are unavailable. Finally when i ordered according to their availability I got kachhkolar kopta instead of chhanar dalna. It was ridiculous. I went there with some huge expectations but nothing was happening acc to my wish. They had only few options from which one can order n dat too they were serving wrong. I was not worth at all. Robibarer mangsho was the only item we got to taste acc to our wish. It was tasted good. Finally they compensated us with aamer chutney but I cant forget such experience. Their overall hospitality was good but my suggestion would be they have to work enough to satisfy their customers who are coming their with some positive expectations.

After going through several great reviews of the place, i went their with one of my friend and the experience was not good. We ordered plain rice, baati posto, mocha chingri, moong dal, pabda sorse and boyal sorse (Some items were not available from their menu). First of all they took around 40 min to bring the first course of the meal. We had finished what they provided i.e the daal and sides, but they took an eternity to serve the fish. We were almost going to cancel the order as we had little hope of recieving the same. Only two waiters were their, and they were busy attending some private party going on the adjacent table to ours. They apologised for the delay, when we complained, but that doesnt help. The staff and manager lacked professionalism. They also took a while to provide the bill. The food was ok though.
Please keep aside 2-3 hrs from your schedule if you want to give this place a go.

As i was looking for a bengali cuisine on a lazy sunday i got this name from zomato.I was totally convinced after gone through several reviews.so with a  great expectation i had visited this place.location was really nice as you can find plenty of car parking place.if you are coming from gariahat side take the first right turn after dhakuria bridge.then the first left turn then again first right turn & drive till the end of that road.i really had a very bad experience in this restaurant,i have to re think again to visit this place in near future.i had asked for rice,aluposto,robibarer mangsho & kadaishutir kochuri.unfortunately they didnt have the kochuri at that time.i had searched for chingri mach in the menu,unfortunately they didnt have that too.best part was they couldnt served us aluposto also as they didnt have that too!!! This was just ridiculous.they have written down so many name in the menu but you cant order of your choice.this was not the end of the story.with their suggestion i had lastly ordered for chanar dalna but unfortunately......they had served us kachkolar kopta.serving time was way too long.decoration was good.atlast they had compensated us with a chutney.but i was just pissed off. Right now they have said to have the famous PARAMOUNT SARBAT so i had the lemon sarbat.i'm a frequent visitor of paramount sarbat & i have never tasted any such sarbat before.i think it was FAKE.mangsho was good in taste & quantity. I had observed that the proprietor of this restaurant was busy trying to make the guests feel comfortable & i really appreciate that.your PR skill was nice,but please look after these issues.

It was a totally unplanned visit to Lokahar. Was searching for authentic Bengali restaurants around Jadavpur and this came up. Was tired eating in 6th Ballygune, Bhojohari and occasionally at Oh Calcutta. I must say the location is a bit tricky to find out. However, once you reach it will worth every penny.

The ambiance is Shantinekatan type (at least I felt like that). Staffs were wonderful hosts. Felt like having lunch in my home. 

Foodwise Kachubata was the best :) I could have ate my whole rice with it only. Apart from that Daal,Shaakbhaja, Kosa Mangso (mutton) and Chandana Kheer were great. Postor bora and Chanar Dalna could have been better. 

Overall a wonderful restaurant and definitely will come back soon.

On a cold winter afternoon, i checked into Lokaahar for Lunch with a couple of friends. Located at Jodhpur Park, this place is a must go for all those people who love Bengali food, who cant cook the rich bengali delicacies due to their busy daily schedules or those who last tasted or get the chance to taste such food when their moms or grandmothers are around.
As its name Lokaahar, the restaurant serves some really good authentic Bengali delicacies. We had ordered Bhat (Rice), Beguni (Fried brinjal in Besun) must mention its huge size given in a big plate, Dal (with vegetables), Chitol Maacher Moitha (an authentic fish item from East Bengal), Mutton Curry, Papad, Pinnaple Chatni, Chandana Kheer (a special desert from the team Lokaahar) and last but not the least the Rasogolas. My special mention goes for the daal, moitha and the Chandana Kheer which is a must try out over there. 
The ambiance is made keeping in mind the rich tradition of Bengal . The atmosphere is quite homely with artifacts collected from all over Bengal which is available on the display and can be purchased. The makers also sell different varieties of rice collected from different districts of Bengal.
The menu and pricing has been kept keeping in mind, i believe, the household of a middle class Bengali - cheap, pocket friendly affordable with a menu that were once heard or taken grandmothers cook book now a only known or available in old traditional Bengali household.

Excellent home style Bengali food. This relatively new restaurant started in November 2015. Eating here is like being an invited guest in an upscale Bengali home. Service is attentive, the food is freshly prepared. The owners are very friendly. Go in a group because Bengali food is meant to be shared. If you call 24 hours ahead, they will prepare anything you want from their extensive menu. We had Topse Maach Bhaja, mourala Maach Bhaja, bak phooler bora, karaishootir kachuri, Chholar daal, kachubata, saag, duck egg daalna, liver curry, pabda maacher jhol served with hot fluffy rice followed by mango chutney, chhanar payesh and paan. Everything except the kachuri was outstanding. My sister who is a great cook and a connoisseur of good cuisine was impressed. I will go back to Lokaahar at every opportunity. I wish the founders great success.

Awesome bengali gharana food with great variety of veg & non- veg dishes in a banedi-bari atmosphere , that too within moderate budget. Commendable hospitality. Will visit again when I'd prefer Bengali cuisine.

Situated in jodhpur park. For me, they are going to be the best Bengali cuisine in this area. Home feel atmosphere, very well behaved stuffs and good management. Nice decor , fill with Bengal magic. They also have a collection of own creativity from various districts of West Bengal . coming to the food, we ordered karaisutir kachuri, alu fulkopi, sada vaat, narkel diye muger daal,bati posto, mutton dakbangla, anaroser chatni and chandana kheer. Every items were very good in taste . Quality and quantity both were good. Must try chandana kheer.

Visited on a Saturday afternoon…Its located at a quiet lane at Jodhpur park with plentiful parking available. Inside you will find traditional Bengali handcrafted furniture. In case you want to take mementoes you can buy those too.

About the food…its traditional Bengali, lightly spiced and brings back fond memories of an earlier generation’s cooking. Tried Plain rice, Lau chingri (nice), Bhetki Bhapa (serving size could be a little bigger), Dal, Alu Bhaja, Chital Muitha (gravy was great…pieces were much larger than muitha and moulded, rather than made by hand, so not very juicy the inside), Chutney (tiny portion). The food is nice and they can offer more variety if ordered in advanced.

But other than food this outlet is about the traditional Bengali family treatment that you get, where eating and adda is entertainment for the staff too, and the owners also enquire
about your enjoyment, rather than a chore to be performed.

For a leisurely afternoon or evening meal, highly recommended. Its also ideal for larger groups as they have long tables for family meals too.

Tasty Bengali fare, very similar to home-cooked food, at reasonable prices with a large number of entrees to choose from.  The mocha chingri & chitol muittha were the best of the lunch we ordered which also included dal, beguni, jhinge posto & chicken dak bunglow curry, all of which were pretty good. Quite satisfied with delivery experience as well.

'Marvellous' is the word I'd use to describe my lunch at Lokahaar. The atmosphere and the decor is very heart-warming and representative of pure Bengali culture and works. And the food... I have been pleasantly surprised. Bok phuler bora and Mourala maach bhaja were delights to start with. My family members are fish lovers; so we ordered Jambo Chital Peti, Lau Chingri and Moong Dal, and my daughters also relished on Haanser Dimer Daalna. Every dish has been a plate of pleasure for the taste buds. 
Besides this, the price is absolutely reasonable and the service of the staff is remarkable. The perfect place for savoring Bangaliyana in its totality.

Lokahaar is THE place to enjoy pure Bengali cuisine. Such delicious dishes at such moderate prices...I wish Lokahaar was situated in Bhubaneshwar but since it's not, I would love to visit whenever I'm in Kolkata. 
I am an ardent of Khichuri and here was served the best one I've ever tasted. My family loved it so much that we ordered another serving and even took a parcel home. 
The menu is exhaustive and we were spoilt for choices. Bhetki Bhapa was well-made and Robibaarer Mangsho truly justifies its name; the homely taste reminded me of childhood days when Sundays were special because such meat dishes were cooked at home. 
Chandana Kheer perfectly sealed the meal deal and all my family members were very delighted. The staff are very courteous and made us feel completely at ease. I wish this new venture all the best, surely it's turning to be a big hit.

This is my second review and just like the first, I'm glad to state that the food of Lokahaar is an absolute delight. I'd ordered a delivery for my grandmother, my aunt; they'd missed a recent family luncheon which was our first visit to Lokahaar. This time it was Khichuri, Fish fingers and Mango chutney, all of which I'd thoroughly enjoyed on my maiden visit and much more. 
The delivery was timely, but it's the food that was an out-and-out splendid. All of us enjoyed every bit and bite. This place is a must-visit for Bengali food connoisseurs.

Had lovely dinner @Lokaahar on Christmas. Really amazing authentic Bengali cuisine. Highlights of the night were Mutton Kasha and Moong Dal. Five stars to the hospitality and ambience. A nice collection of keepsakes from different districts of Bengal. Truely an authentic Bengali experience. Best of luck to team Lokaahar.

They are working very for uplifting themselves... starting from there table and chairs, wall deco to there boutique collections from different parts of Bengal making the place a new attraction for Bengali food lovers... I reached there in the late noon on a weekends for having lunch... the place was totally empty... the staff serving was very friendly and well behaved guide me through there menu and also briefed me about there restaurant... I don't found any other staffs there... whatever I ordered 1. Sada bhat... good, 2. Baguni... huge in size 2 in numbers, excellent one, 3. Moog dal narkel ... Awesome one, 4. Mocha chingri... Very very good, 5. Chicken dakbanglo... good, the chicken pieces are little stiff... 6. Rose paramount sarbort... Awesome and 7. Chandana khir... good but will be better if the consistency will be little smooth... taken home there, alu fulkopir rost and kachu bata... both are very good... the quantity they are serving was huge also the presentation are ok too... only thing I think availability of all items are very necessary, clarification of paramount sarborts flavours are necessary and the service need to be little faster... gr8 news was pocket pinch was very low here... should visit again definitely...

A first time visit for the celebration of anniversary and cherished many cheerful moments with family. As it was an event we had to reserve and ordered the Food. First served with chicken pakora and in main course it followed with plain rice, awesome tasted dal,  fine grated potato chips, white fulkofi curry, sorshe chingri, white chicken, olive and pineapple chutney and baked rosogolla. Last but nt the least one is the Chondona kheer served in matka.  Really delicious. Ambience, food quality and the behaviour of each individual worth mentioning. Thank you Lokaahar for the treat you all served.

I attended the full veg spread special on a particular Saturday. Being a hardcore Bengali foodie the menu was a sight for sore eyes. 

lomba beguni

narkel posto bora

kumrofuler bora

kochubata

shukto

dal

potol posto

dumurer dalna

lau bori ghonto

echorer dalna

chanar dalna

anaras jalpai chatni

kalo chaaler payesh

what else could I ask for !! I firmly believe such variety of veg dishes in Bengali cuisine is very rare in any establishment.

Cheers to Lokaahar

Bengali food lovers must visit this place. Ambience is good and the staffs are very helpful and polite. The most important thing is that the owner himself guides you about the food. We had plain rice, kochubata,  sukto, jumbo chitol peti,  jolpai chutney and chandana kheer. The taste of kochubata,  sukto and chandana kheer was awesome. Anyone who visit this place must try these three dishes. A pocket friendly restaurant. Keep it up lokaahar, will visit again and do not detoriate your quality and quantity.

The 'Sunday Mutton' is one dish which I will love to eat everyday as I have never tasted mutton in such a way. Kumro Phuler Bora, Kachu Bata  all are here.. Thanks for such personalized service to the people over here.. Will be back with bigger crowd.

On a trip to Kolkata after a long five years, I was really excited to discover

"Lokaahar" a Bengali cuisine restaurant.  The ambience has the  artistic local touch which adds to the super food that's served.  We ordered among others, kochu bata , bok phool bada , sukto, sada chicken , bhetki paturi, all of which were outstanding.  And how can you end a good Bengali meal without something sweet!  Ah, the yummy chandana kheer.  Ate Bengali food at a few restaurants on my last visit, but Lokahaar is something totally different - authentic and value for money, decent quantities and distinctly awesome flavour to each dish. Reminded me of my college days back in the 80's when I was privileged to savour delicious Bengali meals at homes of friends.  A visit to Kolkata would be incomplete if you don't eat at Lokahaar! Located in Jodhpur Park, a must try superb Bengali cuisine wonder.

Took my parents out for a Bengali lunch.. And we r really happy with the quality of food.. Never expected this.. Still remember the taste of a few bites still now.. Specially the shorshe ilish.. I wish this one does a great business in the future since its new and tops amongst the best in Kolkata in Bengal cuisine.. The service too of the waiters were very humble and homely.. And what more!! They have a tie up with Paramount Sherbet.. The famous juice shop in College Street.. So no second words on that while you're preparing for an amazing meal while having a juice before that..

Excellent !! This one word will be actual adjective of LOKAAHAR 
I was fortunate to visit LOKAAHAR with my wife, parents and inlaws, I found unforgettable hospitality, very very reasonable rate and super tasty well as quality food. South Kolkata got an excellent Bengali Cuisine with simple yet classy environment and homely atmosphere, and the Cherry on the top we can buy artifacts under one roof from all over Bengal and India, the quality of Honey and Ghee ( clarified butter ) was excellent and we have option to choose from multiple varieties of rice consume there and to take home also ........
Next time whenever I will be in Kolkata I will definitely visit as I feel this is a very nice experience

Read about the newly opened Lokahaar , and was planning for a couple of days to visit there..Finally today got the oppurtunity.Its in jodhpur park.If u r coming from anwar shaw mor..then after reaching lords mor  u have to take a left turn.and then some rights and lefts.and there is Lokahaar..Its good if u call them and ask for directions.
Now about the restaurent.They serve bengali cuisine.As we entered we found a beautifuly decorated place.The walls have beautiful 'pot chitro' paintings.The seating arrangements were also very eye catching.After we make ourselves comfortable we got a very warm welcome from the staffs and the owner himself..The owner is a very friendly person,and he personally helped us selecting and deciding the order.We ordered sada bhat,alu bhaja,kumroni,mug dal narkel diye,pabda macher kalojire jhal,sada murgi jhal, holud polao,anaroser chatni,papor,chandana kheer.. now  the food, it was just awesome..I have never tasted such delicious muger dal in any bengali restaurent of kolkata.alu bhaja was perfect..kumroni was ok.I had pabda.The fish was fresh, nicely fried and perfectly cooked.loved it.polao was good.bt a little more sweet would have made it mind blowing.sada chicken was also good.It had a white gravy made out of kaju paste.anaroser chatni was not so good..as papor they served fryams.chandana kheer was nice..we are very happy visiting lokahaar.. definitely will again go there. Visit Lokahaar and indulge your cravings for delicious bengali food..next tym when we will be visiting will definitely taste chitol macher muithya and mete chocchori..good job LOKAHAAR.. BEST OF LUCK and a big THANK U...😊

From veg to non veg dishes lokaahar reminds you of the long lost Bengali recipes of our ancestors. Full marks to the presentation. The prices are economical and compatible to the taste and quantity of the food. Try it if you are a true bengali food lover. I am sure you will love it.
