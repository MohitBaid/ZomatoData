Khana khazana has become my new hangout place,it's cheap and they don't compromise with the quality as well as quantity. It's also acts as savior in my part because whenever any guest visits our place I just walk into Khana khazana and get something to eat...It's that simple in here. In my opinion it's a must visit place to hangout with friends.

Located opposite National High school Boys.  
Khaana khazana has been one of the cheap favorites among the area.  
Stick with normal chilli chicken, chow or Fried rice.  
They will serve you well and good.  
I personally love the dry chilli chicken and the momo.  The Momo's are very fitting.

Khana Khazana has been the saviour for our family whenever no one is in the mood to cook and is craving good ol' Indian Chinese.
I have lost count of all the dinners we have had, ordering in from Khana Khazana. It's a five minute walk from my house.
I really like their fried rice, and another thing I like about them is the quantity that they provide for such low prices. I also like the additional Chinese gravy that they provide if you ask for it. Also, my aunt is a pure vegetarian (she is a Vaishnavite so no onion-garlic either) and whenever we have ordered food from Khana Khazana the cook has been patient and helpful enough to make my aunt's food without even a bit of onion and garlic but still managing to make it taste great.
The only complaint though would be that the sauces they use to make the side dishes are not of good quality, just a lot of food colour. It would be great if they concentrated more on the quality, increasing prices if need be.

I went to eat at this place after reading the reviews telling that the food is great and not to go by the looks.  And my review is also the same. Great Chinese stuff at reasonable prices. People can visit it without any hesitation. 
I had chicken roll (good),  and chicken chowmein (great, enormous amount). Though I  did not try the thukpa (noodle in broth),  it looked good. Strongly recommended.

Don't go by the outlook.. Try out the food here..its simply amazing.. Take home delivery and if you don't tell your guests or friends about this joint..they will definitely think that the food is from some expensive Chinese restaurant.. Try out their dry chilly chicken.. Its their speciality.. A thumbs up for this small food joint run by 4-5 people from the north east.
