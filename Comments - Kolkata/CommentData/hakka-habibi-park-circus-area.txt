All I can say is not very impressive. The staff is efficient but that doesn't help, neither their food not the set up is satisfactory. I've had better momos at road side stalls than here, they need to up their game if they want to be in business!!

Fried momos are a must try, there's limited seating area but very cosy and homely. The tables are hanging, fancy enough. It's a new joint so a lot can be improved. Mostly the ambience. Over all great food and damn pocket friendly!
They also manage bulk orders very well!

This new hub in the city is one of my favourites right now. 
With affordable price and great quantity accompanied by a dedicated crew who managed a bulk order with no complaints or compromises.
Thank you Hakka Habibi ðŸ”¥

One of the best chinese eateries in the city without any doubt must try for all chinese food lovers in the city. Specially for the drums of heaven and the momos
