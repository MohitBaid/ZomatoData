Food was horrible..i ordered mix veg sandwich worth rs. 50 but they send in a very ordinary container ans that too half sandwich... I mentioned the paneer rolls should be less spicy but still they add lot of green chillies.. Does these guys really check the comments before preparing food.. Really disgusted..
