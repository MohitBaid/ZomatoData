Ordered their "Mixed Sauce Baked Pasta" and "Nachos Supreme". Both items was over-flooded with cheese and mayonnaise. The pasta was sweetly tasted, and it was very average according to my taste buds. But the nachos was a prime hit. It was very tasty and there was a perfect blend of sweet cheese+mayo gravy with namkin taste of nachos. The nachos gravy base also contained a generous amount of diced veggies and corns that also helped to increase the overall taste of the item. This supreme nachos is a highly recommended item and will try it again in the future.

It's located very near to my home. So I wanted to give it a try. I had ordered a Grilled Veg Sandwich, and got it parcelled. When I reached from the outlet to home (in less than 5 mins), the packing was so bad that almost all mayo were out of the packet. When I had the sandwich, it was tasteless. Although it's cheap, the quality is too bad. Need to improve a lot.

Ordered a small meal for lunch as i was going off town and doesn't have time to cook. Using zomato app, i opt for one zinger lemonade, grilled veg sandwich and veggie delight maggie. They were 2hours late for delivering. After numerous attempts to contact them from both me & zomato authority, we finally had some conversation with the cafe owner and i finally get my ordered delivered. Taking about the food, i have no issues with. Items are all well made and pocket friendly also. But they have a pathetic delivery service. If you want to order online i would recommend to use other user friendly app who have their own delivery crew. As zomato doesn't have their own delivery service, it is left solely upto the resturent and they failed in that miserably.

Do not bother ordering here .If your order is not atleast 200-300 rupees they will cancel telling you that the restaurant has no people to deliver .Happened to me 5 times in a row and i end up waiting on refund .The only time i actually got delivery , the quality of the items wasnt upto par .They offer extra vegetables on the burgers but i needed microscope to find the extra vegetables .ORdered garlic bread but it was tough , hard cold felt like the bread was atleast 6 days old and they toasted it and they have no idea how to make garlic break .Terrible restaurant .Wish zomato would just remove this restaurant from here

This place is close to my coaching so I go there during lunch time every weekend. The food is cheap and the ambience is snug. Have tried their cheesy vada pav, chicken momo, sandwiches and garlic bread yet.
Vada pav was good in taste but the portion was very small. The garlic bread was fine but a tad more salty than I like. Rest of the food were fine and pocket-friendly.

Didn't visited the outlet took a home delivery. My order was Bombay special Vada paw, Cheese ka double Dhamaka sandwich and Mix Sauce Pasta.

Packaging - It was Good but the tissue paper and spoon was missing.

Food- Vada paw was decent in taste but the paw was is guess 2-3 day old it was quite hard. Stuffing was good and tasted well. Now let's come down to Sandwich named as Double Dhamaka cheese sandwich. I guess the chef doest know the difference between cheese and mayonnaise. It was the worst sandwich I had no veggies only a thin layer of mayonnaise. Pasta was under cooked it had hardly any sauce it was tossed up in oregano and Chilly flakes. I had two bites of pasta and left it for my dustbin.

Suggestion- You may be economical but you can't serve anything to customer. Focus on food quality rather than keeping funky food name. There is complete difference between Cheese and mayonnaise if the menu says cheese serve cheese not mayo. Ask your chef to keep his basics clean as pasta sauce was terrible. Try and visit some very economical food joints such as Bon appetite ( Lake town) and Pepperz ( Bangur) you will get know the issues. 

Virdict-  Please do justice to menu being economical won't serve the purpose. High time for chef to get the basics right.

Worst place to have pizza from. I had placed the order at 7:00pm and received it by 8:40pm . Zomato apologised for it and I totally understand that. But the quality of food? Yuck! What kind of a pizza have they delivered . It looks like they have picked it from some garbage heap. And the taste is even worse. Throwing all sorts of masalas and spices on a pizza doesn'tâ€‹ make it taste good. Really , and the cold coffee was just like Bournvita milk. The garlic bread was equally bad. I think they offer a discount to woo people and eventually fool them for this shit. Sorry ! I really am! But this is the worst Italian I've ever had. Horrible pizza and garlic bread. I feel nauseous!

This is the worst pizza i've ever had.
The whole food was tasteless and was not even properly cooked.
First of all,the delivery was late than the actual expected time but that was barely an issue.
But the bill which the delivery boy gave was bit different from what was shown in my zomato app.
I called the restraunt and the guy asked me to whatsapp him the photos and bill,on doing the said he told me to pay the zomato shown bill but he was not at all bothered about pizza and he said thats the quality they serve.
Totally dissapointing.

And lastly,the pizza was the worst part of the order.

Will strongly recommend not to order from here.

I ordered food from here and paid online for the order 
 The order was confirmed by 0 degree. But after some time someone called me from 0 degree and said that they are unable to deliver the order. When I argued that i had already paid for that the person said she cant help and she just informed me that they will be unable to deliver and not concerned whether how will the money be refunded

Worst service. I will never order from "0 Degree". The food was too cold and salty. No oreganos, only one tomato sauce. Waste of ðŸ’°. The size of the pizza was small, not medium (as written). Smaller than Domino's small margarita.

Fast life craves fast food. And it is here that you get wide fast food choices that satisfy any cravings. You name it, you get it from pizzas, pastas to desserts, mousse and mocktails. Yes it's a small joint in an inconspicuous road but nothing can beat the taste of rich flavoured food you get here. The dishes cover different taste like sweet, salty, spicy, bitter and sharp and brings your taste buds back to life. ðŸ˜Š
