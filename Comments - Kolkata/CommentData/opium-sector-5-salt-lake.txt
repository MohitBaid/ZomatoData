Used to be a one stop place in terms of unwinding when there almost no options in Sector 5.Food and service was okay within a reasonable price point.Would definitely visit again as I have not done so during the recent times.

Great Ambience üòç Crowd mainly consists of youths, students and young office goers. 
They are a good bar. Serve alcohol at a comparatively cheap rate. 
The little hike than the usual price can be balanced by the ambience they provide. 
They have a lot of space. 
It's good if you go along in a small group of maximum six. 
Also it's a great place to be with your girlfriend who loves to drink and listen to some good music. The service is good. 
Also you have a lot of food, appetisers to choose from. 
If you aren't on the side of alcohol you can choose from a good variety of mocktails. 
So overall to have a good experience you can come here with your friends. 
P.S. It would have been great if they had an indoor smoking area. Sometimes if it's winter evening it's a hot summer afternoon it's not that comfortable for the customers to come out and smoke every time. Hope the management looks into this matter.

If you are an IT professional, you do not need a description of Opium, cause it has already become a second ODC on Friday evening for you.

This well decorated and well maintained place offers you various types of alcohol at a very low cost. If you like cocktails, then you must go for the Long Island Iced Tea (LIT). They serve you Indian/Chineese/Continental foods and snacks at reasonable prices. Tastes are not much special but not that bad too as it's very similar to any other good bar cum restaurant. Oriental Omlet and Mutton Patiwala are the two 'must-try' dishes. Staffs are well behaved but less attentive. Off all those things, slow service is the worst part.

Anyway, Opium, having overall a good ambience, full of corporate gossips, is the perfect place to spend some leisure time on a typical Friday evening after office.

Opium needs not much of an introduction for the IT goers.

Its a all time goto place for all corporates..

The place remains full with office people all the time, boozing, good music, nice ambience at affordable prices.

The place doesnt have much of a speciality dish in their menu..mainly good alcohol at cheap rates and corporate dicounts....

Ambience : Very good...good music..good lighting...very well arranged and comfy seatings...

Food : Nothing much...its mainly of a snack and deink bar type...so tit bits like french fries and all are good.

Staff : A little less attentive but polite.

Nomad will rate this a - 

Food : 3 / 5
Ambience 3 / 5
Staff 3 / 5

Happy food hunting... :)

Dropping by Opium was a random plan with friends on a Sunday evening. Located near RDB Cinemas in Sector V, Salt Lake, this place is simply amazing for boozing and enjoying food at a moderate rate.

The area inside is quite spacious. Hence, despite having a dark ambience, you won't feel suffocated being here. The staffs are courteous but they can surely improve their services. We ordered for Oriental Omelette, Fish Cheese Sticks, Mutton Liver Masala and Mixed Hakka Noodles. We also ordered for Smirnoff 60 ml. and two bottles of Carlsberg Elephant Beer. The food was extremely tasty, especially the Oriental Omelette. It was stuffed with chicken, cheese etc.

Will visit the place again. If you are looking for a pocket friendly pub near Sector V, Opium must be your destination.

Cheers to food. Cheers to life!

Pocket pinch: 1500 for two (approx.) (With alcohol)

For rum lovers there is a must try item on the menu - the captain Morgan pitchers. It is one of the few places in India who serve this pitchers. For food it has both Indian and Chinese cuisines.

I wish I could post a good picture of the tandoori chilli chicken which is something that you must try if you don‚Äôt mind your starters  to be spicy and hot.

5. Tandoori chicken

Been here a couple of times. Service gets overwhelmed when there is a big crowd and may take you half an hr or more to get your drinks, and food like an hour or so.¬† Good mutton preparations. A little-clustered environment and gets pretty difficult in regards to mobility inside the establishment. But quite a moderate pricing, no loud music and a good place to hang out.

Drinks were comparatively low on price. Behavior of few staffs were really disgusting.
And I forgot when the last time I tasted these types of terrible food. Boiled rice would be better than the mixed fried rice. It was smelling bad, those chickens were starring at us. Can't say it was a pleasant experience. I will think before going there again!!

We ordered chicken tandoori which was good, chicken cheese stick which was v v v good, mutton patiyala... Was bit more spicy, though its their signature dish but i didnt liked. Staff n service was also good.
A disappointing point was that zomato says that the have 15% off on axis bank cards for food, but the restaurant simply denied the offer and charged normally. Then why its displayed on zomato till 31st oct 17.

Electrifying atmosphere. Good collection & option of quality booze. Great food. Great place to hangout with college friends and so we did. The entire bar is dimly lit & set up in a very casual and sporty way with Wallpapers of rock and metal legends hanging across it. The music on the stereo is 70s & 80s rock with little bit of rap songs amidst which made it perfect. We had Budweiser premium, Heineken & Carlsberg alongside chicken salad, mushroom chilli and the rest I wasn't sober enough to remember. All in all, had a great time and very satisfied with the service although at times they took a bit longer to serve our orders which was annoying but given that the place was crowded, its normal. Hope to visit again, soon.

An old favotite, Opium was one of the pubs that lined the electronic hub of the city in its inception days. Since then,  it has come a long way but it remains a favorite still.  Good food at pocket friendly price,  nice ambience- it is the perfect place to kick off the shoes and sit back to relax with friends and colleagues.. The item on recommendation would be a long list- but oriental omelette, mutton patiala,  malai chicken kebab etc are mind blowing. Service is good but delays occur due to rush hours on Friday.. Better to go early to grab a seat of your choice.

Though an out and out bar, this place serves you one of the best and cheapest dishes in Sector 5. Their service is no doubt fast and the waiters are equally hospitable just as you would want in a restaurant.
One of their best dishes according to me, would be Mutton/Chicken Patiala. The cooked meat comes in small pieces which is wrapped around by omelette topped with shredded boiled egg white. It's a must if you visit this place. Also had Tandoori Chili Chicken (Half). This is a fusion dish consisting of 8 pieces of tender and juicy Tandoori chicken prepared as Chili Chicken.
The interiors are quite comforting. As far as seats are concerned, you can choose from a sofa with T or, a dim lit corner table.

The first choice if I want to indulge during the weekdays, would have been the obvious choice for weekends if I didn't leave far away and also because it is so near to work that it feels like going to work on a Sunday!

All said and done, if you want to spend quality time with your special someone, do not visit. But if you want to enjoy mouth watering, overwhelming, satiating food along with great cocktails and super fast service, this is your heaven!

Mutton patiala, oriental omelette, betki zezero, murgh senakati, crispy chilli mushroom - these are my favorites. Also, I feel it is a crime to miss cheese-cherry-pineapple if you are there.
Cannot comment on the main course as I gorge on the tasty starters and almost never order main course and the spread doesnt appeal to me.
Not complaining, but I wish they better their music which is sometimes bit too loud for a place that doesn't have a dance floor :P

As it is Kolkata is known for backwardness n poor service and on top of that OPIUM IS THE MOST PATHETIC BAR having the worst service of first order that I came across.!

The waiter‚Äôs are just ignorant and least bothered about Customer‚Äôs. I think this place is not at all customer oriented. The food quality is pathetic as if it‚Äôs stale.

The best part is the low price of liquor that too by the waiters choice bcoz whatever you wish to order won‚Äôt be available always.

It's quite a surprise I haven't reviewed this place yet, considering I drop by on a regular basis. Any boy's gathering now happens at this place, which I'm sure will be echoed by many. Thanks to Opium for being the go-to bar in Sec V.

Booze is cheap and the food is great, service could be better, the waiting times could be lessened. Do try the signature items here - Mutton Patiala and Oriental Omelette. The senakati is a good one too. There's always some sports match running so the conversation should automatically keep flowing. All in all, a great place to be, be it for the cheap booze or the great finger foods.

Well I remembered how bangalore pub use to be loud rock music alcohol crowded all time.
With nice decor.

This is which I find here in this place not so loud music but remaining all are same.
As this is in It office para hard to find place after 6pm.
Quality crowd nice place to hang out with our friends.

They make some delicious food
My favourite chicken patiala this is bomb.
Garlic chicken kebab. Mutton patiala etc etc. 
Must try
Never get bored repeatedly this place.  Not effective to your pocket too.

Visited in the early hours after opening...but the empty seats soon filled up and the place became buzzing alive. Its a popular place in the IT sector. Had a decent crowd gowers unlike other bar places in kolkata. We ordered oriental omelette, chicken patiala, maxican fried fish along with some booze. Patiala is their signature dish...one must try that. Maxican fish was quite unique in their own style tastes good. Omelette was a bit salty. They don't offer any dessert in the menu. Otherwise quite a wide range of snacks & sides are available to go with the booze. Neat place, friendly stuffs with decent crowd. Definitely Worth many upcoming visits.

Dimly lit interiors greet one to this restaurant. The  place reeks of alcohol.
We ordered lasooni kebabs,and chicken tikka kebabs. Tasted perfect. Dhaniya chicken, and butter garlic naan were good too,washed down with draught beer.
Recommended.

Opium is one most happening places in Salt lake Sector 5. It has great ambience, very friendly staffs, big screen televisions for cricket or football matches and awesome music. On top of that, the service. Due to its variety of foods, it has gained enormous popularity among the masses. The price is very reasonable. It won't hurt your pocket. Food quality is superb. Most of the time, we had mutton liver masala, oriental omlette, stuffed omlet, crispy chilli mushroom and normal chicken dishes. Mutton liver masala and Oriental omlette are one of the best!! So please hang out there!!!

A good spot for after office hours drinks and food, that is light on the pocket. Responsive staff and waiters and they usually have all the drinks displayed in the menu.
Only downside is it is pretty crowded, almost every evening.

First of all this is a place where many college goers start their drinking phase. I did the same. First bar visit of my life so It has some sentimental values. So my review will be totally biased.
The waiters are very friendly, attentive and helpful. They don't commit any mistakes.
Food options are huge. Taste of which has not changed since my first visit. Drink costing is on the cheaper side. Ambience is good too. Friend circle masti or romantic date with girlfriend good for every occasion. Njoy to know how great a bar can be. Cheers!!!!

This is the Mecca for quality foodies and tipplers.. one of best places to drink at a low pocket pinch with classic starters that shall sooth all your worries and tiresome weekdays frustration.... Perfect place to hangout with collegues, friends..... Wonderful ambiance, loud music, the 9PM PINK FLOYD numbers when you are high takes you to the top of the world. Interiors are amazing be it the sports tv, lounge, bob marley's ceiling painting, english pop artists covers everything is just stellar.

It has been my 7th visit to opium, finally I am leaving a review about my last visit on 25th August 2017. Please be informed if you are a huge group try to book the table early or you need to wait alot.. anyhow we got outs reaching early. Coming to the food you should always try out few stuffs being the USP here the Mutton Liver Platter, Fish Irani, Oriental Omlette, Mutton/Chicken patiyala... This are the must javed and you van not miss it coming to opium...It's their signature dishes. Coming to the main course the Mutton Rara Punjabi and kashmiri pulao are few of their signatures too. For booze you always have some offers displayed on the table...So please take a look at it. Now you have corporate discount on the drinks too , just bring you id card with you... Highly recommended place for all..... The Axis Bank offer mentioned in Zomato is outdated and is not applicable.

Opium is not my one time experience.. this is a soulful place indeed.. a place of surplus unique delicacies with drinks at a pocket friendly budget..

The must have dishes over here are Mutton Patiala (If you are a no go with mutton, u can have Chicken Patiala) and Chicken Cinnakati kabab. 

Patialas are speciality over here.. these are richly cooked minced meat wrapped with a masala omlet.. it's heaven!

If you are a non-veggie n a cheese lover, you will love to have the Cinnakati kabab, it's large pieces of chicken kababs having cheese filling within it.

Oriental omlet is another dish to be appreciated.. a masala omlet having a filling of chicken and cheese within it.. and it's great too.

Ambience it good.. food is excellent.. staffs are nice but as this place is always over crowded.. you might need to wait for the food to get arrived. And if it is a Friday night, you may need to wait outside to get a table. 

Other the place is excellent. No food is bad over here.. either it will satisfy you.. or will exceed your expectations.. :)

The pineapple ice sticks.

One can also try chili mutton, chili fish, saute chicken... basically all the items mentioned in the menu...all are damn good, pocket friendly.

Went with a friend in afternoon to have a beer or two. It was empty and some stinky smell was there in the pub. Anyway ignored the same and ordered for a Budweiser Beer. As soon as we tested the opened beer in our resp ective glasses..we both amazed how this beer can taste like tamarind water? We immediately complaint to the manager who seemed not interested in his job and to our complaint. He just handed over one email id and asked us to email. We have paid the full amount and left the beer as it is. Absolutely no courtesy, no customer service and at the top no regret or even attention to the complaint. Absolutely rubbish. Don't know how this place is surviving.

Nice place for some not too pricey booze and quite tasty food.we tried the signature mutton patiyala,which is basically spicy cooked mutton keema wrapped in omlette.tasty and filling

The crispy chilly babycorn was also really good.crispy,crunchy and not overpowered by the sauce it was tossed in.

The chicken fried rice and chicken with cashewnuts were standard fares,delicious nevertheless.
Was a bit dissapointed with the peshawari kebabs.they seemed to be fried and was a bit rubbery not exactly melt in mouth.

Our bill for 4 was Rs.2049/-including 4 drinks and taxes

One of those restaurants in Sector 5, Salt lake which serves tasty food and cheap booze. None of the items we ordered disappoint us and were very tasty. We had mutton seekh kabab, Paneer tikka, Mutton patiala, mutton liver masala, chicken cheese sticks, bhetki zezero and each starter was awesome. But bhetki zezero was the best. Its more like an alternative version of fish fry but tasted very different and crispy. after so many starters, we just had dal makhani, chicken tikka makhani and naan for main course and they were pretty good too. Had beer and scotch along with our dinner and total pocket pinch was not much. Ambience was average and nothing worth a mention. The seating in the interior room does not look very cosy but the food makes up for that. Service was also prompt. Overall, one of the better places in sector 5, salt lake.

Chicken cheese sticks is a must, Mexican fish, chicken lollipop for Indian starters you can have the fish tikka kebab, or chicken reshmi kebab. Chicken steak is also very tasty and i so love the mushroom sauce . Mutton Patiala is a thumbs up !! They don't serve desert. Price is ok ! Service is good ! Must visit!

Nested at a corner of Salt lake sector V , it's quite a nice shack to hangout and chill with buddies. At first , we ordered mutton patiala which is a signature dish of this place. It really blew me away. But, the thing that really made me fall in love was their oriental omlett which is another of their signature dishes. Simply, loved it. Amongst the drinks, the Bacardi on Bacardi was quite a head spinner .üòâ Moreover, I loved the awesome ness of this cool restaurant and eager to visit again .

This is a late review, I could not bring myself to writing a review to this place, but writing it anyway. Since this restaurant is one of the highest reviewed ones in Sector 5 area, it has been on my list for a while. On a first look, one will absolutely love the decor and ambience. Opium is everything a well designed bar is supposed to look like. People planning to crack open a couple of cold ones must visit this place just to bask in the ambience. But the good things about Opium end just about there.

Coming to the service, it was extremely disappointing. The food we ordered was served after 25-30 mins, and I found that the noodle was completely cold which can only imply it was ready to be served for a while back, but no one cared. The staff behaviour related to this incident was also lacklustre.

About the food, like I said the chicken noodle got cold, so that is that. The chicken fried rice was good. The waiter's recommended chicken Manchurian gravy had a thick layer of oil on it.

Overall, I would strongly recommend people to steer clear of this place if they are looking for food only. In case someone is planning for a few shots of alcohol and a couple of beer then sure visit Opium. But, nowadays there are many good places in and around sector Five which offer a blend of both at a good quality and price.

One of my all time favourite bar(Used to come to this place all the way from Durgapur, during my engineering days). People will call me insane, but I especially come to Kolkata all the way from Ranchi with my friends just to visit this place(Nostalgia, a major reason, I guess). This place is a perfect amalgamation of decent ambience, awesome food(Oriental Omelette, Crispy Fish, Panfried Fish, Patiala Chicken etc), superb rock music and reasonable price. I've also been to other so called "upmarket and trendy" bars like Lord Of The Drinks, Hauz Khas Socials, Donningtons to name a few. But, the vibe of this place is quite different. This place is very casual and youth centric which is it's USP, and this why I love this place so much. OPIUM ROCKS!

Opium can be classified as a typical joint among the young IT crowd of Kolkata. I have been here a million times. Food quality is really good, both Indian and Chinese cuisine. It's a bit dimly lit with okay music... primarily to add to the ambience of having a few more drinks than you would usually have. Service is slow owing to the massive footfall that they experience.
Order oriental omelette as your first dish. Also try mutton liver fry, Irani fish.

Biggest issue is the huge waiting time in Opium.

An all time favourite of office people. Located in the heart of Salt Lake's sec-5, nearby RDB boulevard, this place has earned a special mention in the minds of people for an all time booze. At the entrance, you will be greeted by a jagged wooden door which gives you the vibes of the dusky interiors once you enter the bar. The place is kinda old school, with the music and low light that actually makes you yearn for more spirits with an outflux of intellectuality and emotions. [3.5/5]
Although the place is noteworthy for it's spirits at an affordable range, the lip smacking food offerings also deserve a mention. The Oriental Omlette has always been a personal favourites‚Äã of mine; well, it's exotic and worth a meal always. Nonetheless,the panfried chicken, chicken tikka kebab and dragon chicken have also etched their mark on my list. [3/5]
Pocket pinch normal, considering the ambience they provide and the location. The staffs are humble enough for a promt response.

To be honest I wasn't really impressed with the place at all. The only good thing that I liked was their collection of music. The chilli chicken is okay and they usually don't have pints (330ml). I can have way cheaper alcohol in other pubs with or without happy hours. The staffs there are very lackadaisical and pretty uncooperative. Again its completely my opinion and people are free to disagree.

This used to be our one of the best hangout place at sector v... but now a days the quality of food and service gone down dramatically..... last friday we four of us went there and ordered some mutton patiala,vetki zezero, few drinks and main course......
They took 40 mints to serve our starter.....test ... cold.. pethetic .... ..staffs are very rude....... .......think twice to visit this place.....

Located in the heart of IT hub, opium is the best place to hang around after a tiring day at work. Been there with my teammates and friends multiple times. All sorts of alcohol are available. Mutton Patiala, murgh senakati, mutton liver masala are must try.

One of the favorite hangout for the people working in that part of the city. This place sees a little lot of footfall and an ample amount of daily customers. Apart from the drinks it serves the food here is great too. While there make sure you try that Mutton Patiala. Spicy succulent pieces of Mutton wrapped in an omlette, will surely make you crave for more. The place is decently decorated and the staff behavior courteous. Prices are mid range.

Located in heart of sector v saltlake beside rdb cinemas.I have been there couple of times as they good sense of music.But on the other hand the service is pathetic.They took almost 30 minutes just to serve 4 bottles of beers.Food is average and overpriced.If you want to spend some quality times don't visit on Friday nights as it becomes too crowded. Though they have a corporate discount scheme but as I said the foods are overpriced so it's of no use.

The name itself is justified . Firstly I am coming to ambience . You will find a background western mysic soothing for you surrounded by spot lights . The wall posters make it worth to make the ambience perfect . Basically all items are yummy . However you must try Mutton Patiala,Tawa Fish, Chicken Tandoori Kebad,Mutton Sik Kebabs . Though you have to wait for 30 minutes there's nothing to lose . This place is so awesome that you may have to wait even on weekdays . A place worth to revisit.
Recently I have tasted Tandoori Chilli Chicken and Mutton Bhuna.I will rate both items 5 out of 5.

A legend among those who end up at Salt Lake Sector V. This place may look meh to some but has a very wide and dedicated fan base who will think thrice before going anywhere else.
Always choc-a-bloc on Fridays and weekends even weekdays find it full at times.
Staff are extremely courteous and efficient.
Food in general is on the spicier side - the kind that goes well with hard drinks. One can try the evergreen Fish Liver Gin, Mutton Liver Masala, Stuffed Omlettes or Cheese Cherry Pineapple. Arguably the best dish is their signature Crispy Chilly Babycorn. Nowhere in this city have I tasted this dish prepared better.
The place has been renovated and expanded over the years but still struggles to allocate tables to all customers who arrive each day. Speaks volumes about its popularity.

Honestly speaking, had v v v low expectations from this place. As it has that typical shady kinda vibe! It felt like a place where you'd go for an illicit affair! Or maybe if you are broke n still want to take your date out for dinner!!
Nope. It wasn't cheap
N it wasn't any of the things i mentioned above.
It was surprisingly a good place. Food was good
Beer was chilled.
Ambience - - nah! Not so good. Need to improve the interiors n clean the furniture. 
Waiters were bit unfriendly n too much involved in watching tv
Overall, a good place to visit if you have time n want some drinks.
Don't know why its always crowded though!!

A quick catch with your friends loitering around at an affordable yet wishing it would have been one of a kind pub experience, Opium is the place to be. With their reasonable price covering food and drink , well to do ambience, the place definitely sets apart for a recursive hangout. Be it mushroom or well roasted chicken or munching the veg delicacies, taste has never been compromised. And with booze to make you linger around, it serves as the best combo as the best price. The only con, you gotta wait for that is the only price you have to pay cause the place is in demand. Once entered , it gives one of a kind experience which keeps on calling you again and again

Opium is one of the oldest bars located at sector V near RDB. This place started out as a major hangout place for people coming out of office in that area. I have been to this place a lot of times but never reviewed them. I have had all types of snacks from peanut masala to paneer/ chicken pakodas, Chilli baby corn to paneer tikkas. Food is quite good. Since the service is quick, prices are not exorbitant and food is good - this place gives you a good satisfied feeling at the end of the day. Downsides are ambience and decor which have not come up with time to compete with other pubs in that area.

Situated in the hub of tech savvy and booze lovers, this place is a must to visit for casual hangouts. But if you are looking for some private times and chaos is what you don't like, then it is not the place. Ambience is quite pleasant with soothing lights and seats are comfortable with led screens on both end of the bar which also enables you to look at the t.v set without twisting your body and simultaneously engage in conversation with your peers.

My favourite cocktail is litchi sour and would recommend it to people who love trying different cocktails. Ambience could have  been a little  better but the taste of the food here compensates it.

If you are in a group and want to travel back to the "adda" you used to have in the hostel over the cheap booze, this place is for you.

Have been to this place twice so far and both were unplanned. Once you enter, the place has the proper "bar" atmosphere and is always quite packed. They play loud music, which is not as loud as music played in lounges, but not subtle either. You have to speak quite loudly for the other person to understand. The service is average. You have to keep asking them for the menu or anything you want separately. ¬†Though once you order, the food and drinks are served fast.¬†
We ordered for Thai Spicy Chicken which was basically a super spiced up version of chicken lollipops served with gravy, crispy chilly babycorn and their famous chicken cheese sticks. We had also ordered a beer and vodka with soft drinks.¬†
I loved the babycorn, it was simply perfect. Crunchy as well as spicy. The Thai chicken was too spicy for my liking though and felt a little overcooked. The cheese sticks were good, but nothing to brag about.¬†
The bill came down to around 1500, which is not that bad considering the location and place. So if you are a big group looking for a reasonably price place for drinks and don't care much about the quality of food, then it is a must visit, if not, then I believe there are better places in the city.

The place was overcrowded, as a result, the service was delayed. We decided to keep it short with a margarita, a jaggerbomb and two beers along with chilli chicken and babycorn. The drinks were good, but can't say the same about the food. The chicken was overcooked. Was disappointed.

We went to Opium with my group on Sunday. We entered the bar around at 3pm. Luckily it was kinda empty and we got the best location to sit. I ordered vodka ( they didn't have flavoured vodka, so had to have regular one ). The boys had old monk and BP. 
In dish we  ordered fish irani which was absolutely delicious, fish was so tender and tasty. Then we took mutton patiala - mutton wrapped with egg omelette,it just blew our mind. It was so awesome that we want to visit opium again for this dish and it was pocket friendly. We had mutton liver fry which was slightly spicy but as i love liver i liked that too. Then we ordered chilli mutton- i didn't have that as i was full but friends told it wasn't good, mutton pieces were hard.
All in all, it's pocket friendly and a must visit.

In case you're not too concerned about experiencing a burning sensation while taking a dump the next morning, you can go for it. Ambience was okay. The music scene needs to improve but staff were courteous. Overall, a nice place to hangout with friends.

We went to Opium with my group on Sunday. We entered the bar around at 3pm. Luckily it was kinda empty and we got the best location to sit. I ordered vodka ( they didn't have flavoured vodka, so had to have regular one ). The boys had old monk and BP. 
In dish we  ordered fish irani which was absolutely delicious, fish was so tender and tasty. Then we took mutton patiala - mutton wrapped with egg omelette,it just blew our mind. It was so awesome that we want to visit opium again for this dish and it was pocket friendly. We had mutton liver fry which was slightly spicy but as i love liver i liked that too. Then we ordered chilli mutton- i didn't have that as i was full but friends told it wasn't good, mutton pieces were hard.
All in all, it's pocket friendly and a must visit.

We went to this place on a Saturday. Had ordered a Heineken, Budweiser Magnum, Cheese fish sticks and the Dragon Chicken. Cheese fish sticks were good but the Dragon Chicken was way too spicy. In case you're not too concerned about experiencing a burning sensation while taking a dump the next morning, you can go for it. Ambience was okay. The music scene needs to improve but staff were courteous. Overall, a nice place to hangout with friends.

This is a very fine bar. It was really amazing experiencing this place. The place is very cheap and good for hanging out with friends. In most of the bars in Kolkata with this kind of cost range I have experienced very bad food but Opium was totally different, the food was very delicious. The ambiance is good, service is also nice, I didn't like the music though but that's considerable.

I am a Calcuttan now permanently residing in Bangalore. This is my first visit here. It's small and sweet. The retro rock and roll music they play here was soothing to the ears after experiencing the loud EDM pubs and bars in Bangalore generally play. The crowd it draws is a testimonial that serves to its popularity. As pocket friendly as it gets. Food is good. Absence of many drinks in the bar but that is forgiveable as they are not the most popular drinks. Good place. The corporate crowd that gathers here serves in favour of the gentler ambience of this place.

This is one of the most happening places in town.
Loved the ambience. Loved the service. I ordered one margarita. And crispy chilli babycorn for starters. 
For the main course I had chicken cheese sticks and panfried chilli Chicken. Food was good and sufficient in quantity. 
One of my friends ordered another cocktail. Both the cocktails were great. And the way of presenting was awesome. 
Loved the place. Would surely visit again in near time.

These days there are so many options available for a meal that sometimes it is natural to miss out on things that are near you . I have been to opium before for drinks and I am well aware of its quality . But very recently I came to know about some hidden gems that opium houses and these gems are some starter dishes that are quite favourites here . But inspite of being a food enthusiast and hunting down several items it was really a shameful act from me to be unaware of these world class dishes being served at a place which is so near to my workplace . So, this review is my tribute to Opium and 3 of their dishes that have simply blown my mind and those who by any chance still have not tried them , must do it ASAP. Because , very few dishes in this city can outshine these ones .

------------------------------------

FOOD :- Inspite of rambling about location and ambience let's get straight to the dishes that i am so eager to talk about . Opium has a reputation of delivering some fine starters but they have taken it to a whole new level with the following dishes :- 

1. Murgh Senakati ( 4.5 / 5 ) :- So, this is ur traditional tandoori chicken with an excellent twist . Think of  the finest quality tandoori chicken and then imagine it to be stuffed with cheese . It is absolutely mind blowing and we loved it . The chicken was soft and not over grilled like usual places. 2 generous pieces were served . If you are a big fan of tandoori chicken then your experience is incomplete without this dish . A highly recommended one .

2. Bhetki zezero ( 4.5 / 5 ) :- Now when I ordered this dish they said that the preparation will take some time. They frankly took a lot of time to serve this one but when they did it simply mesmerized us . 2 bhetki fillets shallow fried with a very thin crumb and served with French fries and sauted veggies .I simply don't have words to describe the fish fillets . The fillets seemed to covered in cheese , and the fish just melts in your mouth . I have been hunting grilled fish dishes everywhere and this dish is just amazing. The only thing missing was a little pepper on the top . A classic dish that is underrated and needs more attention . Highly recommended.

3. Oriental omelette ( 4 / 5 ) :- This is the most ordered dish from here. It's USP is that it is basically a cheese burst omelette . The stuffing is cheese , chicken and mushroom slices . The omelete is big and easily serves 2 person . Every bit was a burst of cheese and we loved it. Also a recommended one .

4. Mutton Patiala ( 100 / 5 ) :- And here is the main event . After being floored by some excellent dishes the meal just got better . Hands down this has to be among the top 10 dishes of the city . Mutton keema or specifically tiny bits of mutton pieces cooked in onion and garlic ( basically mutton keema kasha ) and served by an omelete covering. A lot of people must be wondering how much the dish can offer as only keema is served but be informed that every spoonful of this will give you enough tiny mutton pieces to fulfill your meat cravings . This is the dish I mean for mutton lovers an absolute delight . A lot of people are already well aware of this fine delicacy served here and are big fans of it.  Those who still have not tried this dish , please do . Don't miss out on an instant meat classic . A legendary dish .

5. Fresh lime soda sweet ( 3 / 5 ) :- Ordered to wash down the superb meat but it was not up to the mark . Too much lime destroyed the flavor . A cold drink could have been a better option .

------------------------

Verdict :- It will certainly not take my recommendation to let you guys know about how awesome opium is . It has been a favourite for many and will continue to be one of the iconic bars of the city . But this is to let the foodies know who are still not aware of the awesome starters that are served here . A big shout out for the following 3 dishes :- 

¬∞ Murgh Senakati 
¬∞ bekti zezero
¬∞ Mutton Patiala ( instant classic ) 

This review is solely written for the purpose of these dishes . I won't say much about the ambience and service this time but still mention that they are really good. Opium is always known for its dim lights and quirky songs . The service time is well withing the limits and the behavior is excellent . My 5 star rating though is for the 3 dishes which I believe should be tried by every foodie in the city .

The watering for the IT people, Opium has truly become like the olypub of sector 5. One of the first and foremost pubs in the area, it has serving great food with cheap booze. The famous dishes are mutton patiala, oriental omlette, cheese fish stick, chicken senakati along with a number of other delicious items. They also make a mean LIIT and other cocktails too.
We will always visit this place irrespective of any service or food issues because it feels good high on Opium!

Location- If you walk a few steps from rdb cinema you will find this place. Opium is very easy to find.
Ambiance-They have a large space which can accommodate around 70 people at a time. Opium is dimly lit. The music collection of this place is incredible. I went there after a hectic week of work and I have specially loved Opium because of its awesome music collection which slowly reduced my stress.
Food and drink ordered- Well,this was my first visit and we have got what we ordered. The chicken tandoori was so wonderfully cooked me and friend asked for two plates of that dish!
Drinks-Old monk supreme and Smirnoff vodka

I look forward to come to this place again and again. This is a magical place at Friday evening!!

Great place to reduce your stress after all the hectic day at office..  Excellent location for all the office goers.. Ambience is nice with the rock music on the backgrnd..  Now for the food..  For non veg starter chicken singha kathi is best..  The cheese melting journey is awsome.   N if u like cheese n u r vegeterian dont miss on the chili cheese mushroom..  Infact the dishes of egg are also appealing..  Compared to the main dish.. Side dishes are better over here..

Tried mutton lever masala,mutton patiala,chicken patiala, shikhari alu,peanut masala, oriental omelette ,tandoori chicken.

All was good.But quality of fish was not good in bhetki zezero.
But we faced long queue every single time.

My friends and I went to Opium yesterday. The food and ambiance were great. However, it was particularly alarming that within the enclosure of the restaurant, the security guard of the place and another man were singing lewd, lecherous songs right to our faces. The worst part was, the guard, instead of stopping this man joined him. Upon confronting both of them, all I heard was I "should mind my language", while the guard CONTINUED to sing. This happened around 10:00 last night.¬†I sincerely hope Opium takes some strict action against this, as this behavior is simply unacceptable. This is not OKAY.

Restaurant is good, food is also good.  If anyone looking for a veg item with drinks then one should go with Chilli Cheese Mushroom and in nonveg its Chicken Senakathi.  
The manager of restaurant should be more polite.  He acts like that he is serving order or listing to us and doing favour.  All credit or debit cards are not accepted in this restaurant.  Faced the problem jst yesterday. That god my wife had another credit card, otherwise I had to look for an alternative options.

Opium is one of the very rare pubs in Sector V area which serves real good starters along with liquor. I had been there around 6 times while I could only sit there only once (so imagine the popularity this area has).¬†
This place is around a 10 mins walk from my office and thus we dropped in one a Friday evening at around 6.30 PM. We still had to wait about 20 minutes to get in which is a testimony in itself.¬†
We finally got to sit at an inside chamber where the seats were a bit clumsy. Along with the scotch, we ordered Mutton Patiala, Oriental Omlette and diced Chilli Chicken. All of them were very well prepared while the stand apart dish was the Mutton Patiala. The service was okaysih and it is considerable with that amount of rush in the outlet. Overall a nice place to try out after office.

Went out for a team lunch. Has a rich collection of drinks. Absolutely loved the food, specially the Mexican fish, dragon chicken and  Murgh Kolhapuri.They were mouth watering Kashmiri pulao tasted just perfect, not too sweet, just the right bit. The ambience and the music was good. A little more light on the table would have been better. 
 Cons: Serving time is a tad too long
             No options for desserts
             Less available options in the food menu.         
             Needs to be improved

Went there on christmas afternoon. Nice location with parking facility. This restro cum bar is quite popular in kolkata. Themed like american pubs with good music and Spacious. Staffs are nice and cordial. As it was a christmas day so welcomed with complimentary cake.
Now coming to the food ordered MUTTON PATIALA, CHICKEN SENAKATI, BHETKI ZEZERO. And for drinks had BACRADI WHITE and SMIRNOFF alongwith Lime Cordial and Orange Juice.
MUTTON PATIALA- Pieces of mutton chunks wrapped in a egg fry with some cheese sprinkled from top. This dish is a MUST HAVE. The meat is so juicy and that tangy sauce is so yum.Loved this.

CHICKEN SENAKATI - Stuffed chicken with cream filling in it. Served with salads and most probably pudina sauce. Another master striker. So amazing. You can feel that cheesy burst in your mouth

BETKI ZEZERO- Fried Betki fillets served with sauted veggies and potato wedges. The fish was nice and soft. Proportion was also v.good. Tastes so good.
And all those items compliments with your drinks so well. Big hi5 for every items. It make my day. And were full.
Now the bill. It was really really worth every single items. Will not burn a hole in your pocket. Our total cost was Rs 2164. Which was pretty good. They even doesn't levy extra 27% charge on alcohol unlike some other restaurants. I mean what do i want more! Really it will bring a big big smile on your face. Highly recommended. And obviously will visit soon üòä

Nice place to spend evenings. It pulls a major sectorV mass. Food is good but service seriously needs to be improved. Perhaps it is because othe crowd pours in during evening hours. We reached opium at 10.20pm on friday. The security guard not only refused to let us in but behaved extremely rude with us saying that no seats were available. We literally faught him and entered and got to know that seats were available. 

Beer bottles were served but opened after requesting several times. Food quality and taste was good. No complaints for that. However, we were asked to pay the bill even before we started having the starters. 

Sorry, but I had never seen such poor service and rude behaviour annywhere else. I doubt if I shall ever visit again.

Opium has been a new addition to the foodies of Kolkata. It has become quite a popular place, specially among the young IT crowds of the city. The mesmerizing decor of the place along with their delicious foods are the main attractions of Opium. My sudden plan of stepping into this cool place with my dear buddies did not go in vain.  

The food items we ordered consisted of Vat, Murgh Kalmi Kabab, Crispy chicken, paneer cheese kulcha and Handi Murg. The mouth watering flavors of these authentic dishes will be there in my mind for a long time.

Opium is a popular pub of Salt Lake and I dropped in years later with my family, that's right, we drink together :P

One thing that struck me is that they did not share their Wifi password! I tried Gin and Tonic, and yeah I enjoyed.

We went in on a time when mum was eating vegetarian, so a lot of veg food were ordered.

We ordered FRENCH FRIES, CHEESE FISH STICKS, CRISPY FRIED BABYCORN, MUTTON PATIALA, CHEESE BALLS, PAN FRIED FISH.

¬†The French Fries were decent, but took a long time. But they weren't soggy or tough.

The Cheese Fish Sticks had the perfect amount of cheese , and a thin coat of flour. 6 hot and crispy Sticks were delightful.

The Crispy Chilli Babycorn was served in amle amount, and even though tasty, I'd have liked a tad more chilli.

Cheese balls held up to it's name as they were gooey cheesy decadence. Yes, you cannot be concerned with calorie count.. screw that and eat this soft little pillows of cheese :P

Pan Fried Fish was well cooked and the spicy hot sauce was lip smacking.. I'd recommend a little nutty element, It'd definitely enhance the dish.

Now the famous Mutton Patiala.. It was succulent juicy spicy mutton pieces wrapped in an egg omelette. The spices and herbs were prominent and it's a must try out here.

One aspect I really admired was the old stuff weren't changed, as they continued to serve us with a smile. I like this family feeling. Opium should be visited once in a while :)

Cheapest Best Pub in the City

I am not going to say it's good but it's one of the best pub I've been into, the place has a vintage look which attracted me. Best place to grab a beer and enjoy the sports as the place provides this facility. Coming to its service first, it's really good and fast. Drinks are good, and if you're a foodie then you will love their food. Specially Tandoori chicken, it was finger licking good. 
 The only con is its too crowded and if you're planning to visit on a Friday night, then be ready to be on the queue.
Apart from that, it has every reason to go and hang out with your buddies.

Thank you Opium for your serviceüòçüòç

I'm looking forward to visit that place again..üòä

Best place to visit for small corporate get togethers as you have an option for (15% discount) if you take your ID card along with you. P.S. - The Discount applies for only selected corporates.Have been here on many occasions¬†& I love the Mutton Rara Punjabi, Mutton Lababdaar. Please also try out the Malibu Cocktail for cocktail lovers. Would recommend to try out Mutton Items only & be selective while choosing Chinese Items. Starters are lip smacking with the drinks as well.If you are looking for ambience, this is surely not the place to be. However being a Corporate Guy myself would like to rate this place highly as this place helps during the end of the month times due to discounts.

I could rate this bar cum restaurant 5+. My favorite bar cum restaurant. And all the food I tried were delicious. Ambience is very nice but music was a bit loud for me although my frnds didn't feel so.

Opium has been a host to our numerous college reunions. No trip of mine to Kolkata is complete without a get together here. If you take its elements separately, there is nothing much to talk about individually, be it the ambience or food. But when combined together, the dark ambience, economic bitings and chilled beer are the reasons to hit the place again and again. This time we ordered for Bud magnums, wine, fish finger and tandoori chicken. Presentation wise the food will not look appetizing, but as said you cannot expect gourmet here. The fish fingers served with fries and dip were pretty good and got gobbled up real quick. Half a plate tandoori chicken actually felt like quarter plate coz of the quantity but it was cooked pretty well. Chilled beers, with good food, nostalgic music and great company to enjoy it all with, sole reason we will keep frequenting this place.

This is a pretty decent place to go and hang out with your buddies. Open bar counters, decent ambiance. The thing that you notice about the place is the comfortable decor and colour pellets. Now coming to the food, the kebabs are good enough, maybe even a bit better than that. But then when you have a good ambiance, good music such as this place with the pals you hang out with.... decent food and booze works out perfectly. My tip, it is worth the visit with your group

It was my first visit to this area of the city and was surprised. Maybe I have been stereotyping Calcutta way too much. So this are is like the corporate hub and hence evidently it is full of modern cafes and lounges to cater to the needs of young IT crowd. 

Was meeting an old college friend here and he suggested this place called opium. It was well decorated and had a pleasing ambiance. We ordered beer and starters including chicken lollipop and more. We had spent good two hours and ended our meal with main course of kadhai chicken and jeera rice. 

I think I would like to visit again when I am back in Calcutta.

A big disappointment. I used to go to this place by 8 years. It was so nice. But I went few days back and got disheartened so much. Before putting this review in zomato I went 2 more times there. Because I had a very good memories with this ¬†restaurant earlier. So before putting any negative comment, I wanted to be very sure.
Ambiance: Poor. Previously they used to have some good taste of music. Now a days so much loud music. even one day live commentary of cricket. The whole situation got messed up.
Food Quality: Tremendously bad, because I had food here earlier.Previously I had a good experience. Now a days the food quality is degraded. I don't know the cook has been changed or not.
Staff Behavior: They are so arrogant. They did not bother to write the order properly. If you tell them for a good music, you will learn the definition of ignorance there.

Very Pathetic experience.
2016 is a very bad year for this restaurant.

Wonderful ambiance and perfect lighting for a bar. To be honest it was my first time over there and I really enjoyed the moment I spent over there (apart from the rude behavior of the waiter).¬†

Since it was my first time my friend told me to try "Mutton Patiala" and honestly I can't explain how good it was, wanted to order the same thing again, but it was already late to order :-( . I would say if you visit this place please do try Mutton Patiala and you can thank me later for this advice.

The restaurant serves only chinese and north Indian cuisine. Since I am a vegetarian, so I cannot comment about the flavours of the non-veg food items there, but I found the vegetarian food taste average. A nice place if you are looking for long adda sessions over alcohol.

Opium is quite a common place to hangout post office hours, specially for the Sector V IT crowd. The location is very convenient. The ambience and seating arrangements are also pretty good. Generally it stays packed starting from Friday evenings throughout the weekend. The service from the staff is also prompt. We ordered plenty of beers and starters and it got served without any delay. The Mutton Patiala remained the pick of the starters. It's quite a unique dish to try out, spicy and shredded Mutton wrapped inside a fine layer of egg. It tasted awesome. Rest of the starters and booze were usual. Overall, Opium deserves a 3.5 out if 5. But, an extra 0.5 for that delicious Mutton Patiala.

Since my office is just 30min from this pub, most of the birthday treats or promotion treats drove us here. Opium is situated a few walks from RDB,Salt Lake. It is very famous for the cheap booze, good crowd and ofcourse Mutton Patiyala. 
I am not really a mutton fan or egg! Mutton Patiyala is actually a really well cooked dish with omelette wrapped around it! 
Tequila shots to beer, u can enjoy your time with your friends in this really good pub!

I had a very bad experience on Shashti. To begin with there was a long queue but considering that it was Shashti, it's absolutely pardonable. However what's not pardonable is when you order for Smirnoff and get something different, you are definitely not happy. We had ordered for Chicken wings as starters which was again half cooked and horrible to taste. However paneer pakoda did some kind of a saving grace act. We then ordered for Veg Chowmein, which was again horrible and had a weird pungent odour, something that says it's stale. Net net a very sad experience üò•üò¢

The place is a complete wow. People say the ambiance is dark and all but it allows you to simply blend in. Such warm reception and warm people. 

Fab food. Shikari Aaloo deserves a special mention. There are times when you lost count on the number of times its on repeat. The other dishes are also well made and served without much of a lead time.

We always tend to order the morgan pitcher which is a splendid cocktail of rum, cola, ginger and lemon. Its an exquisite blend with the right amounts of everything. 

Needless to say, being regulars, always give you an edge in terms of service.

Keep munching.

A great place for ocassional hangout and drinks along with a great range of good non veg foods to try for. I have been dreading to try this place for the review that i had recieved over the period of my stay in Kolkata, a good review but basically the review consisted the word "Cheap booze" which frightened me that this is place is nothing but a place that serves cheap booze but boy I was so wrong. The mutton patiala, the continental omelette, The lemon fried chicken, The mutton liver, The mexican fish,The Tandoori chicken are just lip smackingly good. It provides a good ambiance a good variety of drinks and great great variety of food and the best thing It also gives you a corporate discount that makes your heart lighter not your pocket . :)¬†One of my favorite party destination for booze and food.. :)

I am one of those unfortunate IT engineers who is fortunate enough to have such a nice and cosy bar near the office.

When we are allocated to projects, we visit this place after evening, other wise mostly in the afternoon. Food and drinks prices are pretty reasonable. Also, they do offer 5% discount to corporates.

Near the entrance there are huge comfy sofas to accommodate big groups. The food was above average. Must try the mutton patiala kebab, mutton fry & oriental omelette. Service was a bit slow, but can't complain as the place is mostly housefull.

There is something very savoury about neon rooms and jazz and alcohol that appeal to all the three Freudian topography(id,ego,superego).Greater minds have pondered over this and one must simply relegate to the future to provide a coherent answer.Meanwhile,we endeavor to find ourselves in such a harmony on occasions and fun weekends.Opium is the most famous watering hole of sector5.In opium,jazz remains amiss,the neon is supplanted by comforting specks of white in between the framework of wood.But to the inebriated,that's close enough.we ordered shots of absinthe,bailey's among liqueur and two food items-bhetki zezzero and oriental omlet.
In the fourth age of men(kaliyuga),the route to nirvana is via three shots of absinthe and a handful of meat.we porked up accordingly.Absinthe and bailey's need no introduction.oriental omlet is pretty,but not unique.However,foodlovers will find to their delight the bhetki zezzero.zezzero is briny,and tastes strongly of the ocean and rocksalt,and breathes in like the wetlands that the seas have brushed past.
Opium continues to remain¬† an iconic place for the youth,and I hope they continue to keep their standards just as high

I have been visiting this restaurant since 2007. What amazes me most is the consistency of their taste for so many years.
I have tasted their full Chinese menu and a wide section of their Indian menu. All dishes taste pretty good, the Indian gravy items are little on the oily side though. Chinese dishes are comparatively lighter. Their fried mutton is something you don't want to miss.
Ambiance is youthful. You can enjoy here irrespective of your age, gender or the size of your group.
The staffs are mostly cordial. The service, however, gets irritatingly slow sometimes if its crowded.
Price is very reasonable. Moreover, they offer a 10% discount to almost everyone and accepts lunch coupons too.
The restaurant is always crowded on Fridays, for both lunch and dinner. So try to come as early as possible on Fridays.
Opium is one of the most pocket friendly places in Sector V where you get good food and hard drinks. This is a must visit place. And believe me, one visit is not enough to know Opium. Keep on visiting... you will fall in love.

A nice place to hangout with friends on a lazy Saturday evening. Drinks are as usual, but in side dish I would recommend all to try Mutton Patiala and Oriental Omelette. The cheese that melts in your mouth when you take a bite of the omelette is just orgasmic. The ambience is not that much to mention but located inside the IT Hub makes it a convinient place and a must visit.

Located at Sec-V, Salt Lake. One of the oldest restaurant cum bar in sec-V. Visited this place many time before and the last was yesterday late-afternoon. The place has maintained its standard. Cozy ambience though the area is not so big. The music goes well with the place. Yesterday ordered burnt garlic rice and one of the chicken preparation and for my thirst, one chilled beer. The food was fresh which meant more for me than taste. Service was good and on time.

Opium is highly overrated on zomato. Food is just ok. You can get the taste at any other ordinary restaurant. Service is pathetically bad . Had to wait
 30 mins for starters and 30 mins again for the main course. Had to go personally and call the waiter to take orders. Cheese in cheese cherry pineapple tasted bad, not sure why. Chicken patiala with a coating of fried egg was the only good thing we ordered. Rest were nothing special. Rating it 1.0 because of the slow service. Strong critic I am. :|

The place is done up in a minimal but elegant manner. There staff is very friendly and courteous. The food is very tasty. The chicken shenakathi which is basically chicken legs stuffed with cheese is delicious. The drinks are priced moderately. Opium is a must visit for all the poeple working in Sector 5 or nearby :)

The price of drinks is cheap and the service guys are great.

What I so like about this place is the taste of food. Do try the following while enjoying your drinks:
Betki Zezero

Mutton Patiala

Oriental Omlette

Do you people even need to read this review to decide whether you'll visit this place or not?

This bar is a life saver for all the IT guys in sector V. ¬†Located a little ahead of RDB cinemas, this bar-cum- restaurant is easy to spot. It's mostly very busy after 6.30 pm in the evening, especially on Fridays and the weekend. So, do plan ahead and expect some waiting time.

Once you're in you will tend to appreciate the simplistic and dim ambiance. There are a lot of TVs too telecasting any important match( if that's the case).

The alcohol is priced reasonably and so is the food, Do try the patiala chicken and oriental omlet.

Opium is located in the road of RDB Cinemas in Sector 5. This is one place where you come with your friend for a couple of drinks and amazing food. It doesn't have great ambience because it's all about the drinks and food there. The service is prompt and the staff is polite too. If you are planning to visit this place on weekends then be ready to stand in a queue as people keep pouring in during the weekends.

What can i say about this place? This is in short what we call the Holy ground for all IT professionals in Sector 5. Fridays are incomplete without a hangout at this place.
Coming to the food quality,service, value for money...nothing to complain of...all are awesome. My favorite is the Oriental Omelette.

Well there is nothing much to write about this bar cum restaurant. This is like the Mecca of alcoholics in Sector 5.

The price of drinks is cheap and the service guys are great.

What I so like about this place is the taste of food. Do try the following while enjoying your drinks:
Betki Zezero

Mutton Patiala

Oriental Omlette

Do you people even need to read this review to decide whether you'll visit this place or not?

This bar is a life saver for all the IT guys in sector V. ¬†Located a little ahead of RDB cinemas, this bar-cum- restaurant is easy to spot. It's mostly very busy after 6.30 pm in the evening, especially on Fridays and the weekend. So, do plan ahead and expect some waiting time.

Once you're in you will tend to appreciate the simplistic and dim ambiance. There are a lot of TVs too telecasting any important match( if that's the case).

The alcohol is priced reasonably and so is the food, Do try the patiala chicken and oriental omlet.

Opium is located in the road of RDB Cinemas in Sector 5. This is one place where you come with your friend for a couple of drinks and amazing food. It doesn't have great ambience because it's all about the drinks and food there. The service is prompt and the staff is polite too. If you are planning to visit this place on weekends then be ready to stand in a queue as people keep pouring in during the weekends.

This place has always been my favourite. It's mostly an overcrowded place and you will never get a place if u visit the place on a Friday, Saturday, Sunday evening. Situated at the heart of IT sector, so it's obvious to be filled with customers always.
Coming to the main part of a review, THE FOOD!!
I'll tell you the must try out here are - Mutton Patiala, Oriental Omlette, Bhetki zezzero. These are super delicious with lots of cheese in it. I love the Tandoori Chicken here too. The chicken is tender and the green chutney is too tasty. 
Ambiance is good, food is good, waiters are courteous.
Live sport screening, good music and some bottles of beer. What else do you need?

Located near the heart of the IT Hub, this place remains full even on Mondays!!! I visited on a Monday expecting a quite atmosphere. What I found was just the opposite & oh yes I liked it. Crowd is mostly young & hip. I love their Mutton Liver Masala. Just too good. Mood is good inside except the fact that some of the staff carries an attitude which is clear on their body language. ¬†Next time I will note their names for sure....

Good sitting area, the entrance is not so good. Went with friends. Had tequila sunrise, malibu, 3 Heineken 330ml beer, crispy fish and panfried chicken. Malibu special was special indeed. As was the panfried chicken. The fish was having a stinky smell, maybe did not soak the fillets in lemon water before cutting them to make the dish. Beer's were as usual.

One of the most renowned joints in sector 5,had high expectations about this bar and restaurant. But the experience was below average to be very honest. Ambience and seating capacity wise it's very good no doubt..but the service is poor..too much waiting time for any order. Food menu is not very good,with almost similar options. Price wise a tad on the higher side,but that is expected because of the location. Overall, a so so restaurant and kinda over-hyped by the sector 5 crowd it seemed

Always packed during evenings and has got a wide seating arrangement...
Rates are reasonable and even the starters are good and have a variety to add on the table...
Been there twice with a gang and liked it both the times...But during late night's it gets over crowded which one may not like...

            Food Ordered:Mutton Patiyala => review( Just One Word Awesome, loved it so much next time we visit will have it in our menu. )Butter Nan => review( Just Perfect, taste texture, softness, heat everything )Navratna Pulao => review( Bit Disappointed on this but might be am not a pulao fan )Chicken Badami Kebab Masala( Another Awesome Perfect Dish. Having it with the nan was the perfect Combo)Fresh Lime Soda
I would recommend everyone to visit this place atleast once, then you are found to keep it in your favorite list.

Located near SDF in sector V, this place is great for a long adda with friends. The place has booming music all the time, but somehow that only adds to the ambiance. Although people mostly go there to get a little drunk, their food is also pretty good. In the starter section their fish cheese sticks are scrumptious. These are basically cheese stuffed fish fingers served with a special sauce which is a mixture of mayo and some sandwich spread and tastes really good. There is also a chicken counterpart of the cheese sticks. There oriental omelet which is stuffed with chicken, mushrooms etc are also delicious. These people serve both Chinese as well as North Indian food. In the North Indian section, there is something called the Mutton patiyala, which consists of diced mutton pieces cooked in a hot and sweet gravy and served wrapped in a large omelet, with grated boiled egg sprinkled on top. It is a mass of calories served on a plate, but so so delicious, albeit a little hot. The place is quite pocket friendly and I have every intention of going back there.

Go there if you want to get high in reasonable price! The place is so noisy that if you plan to have a relax time you in return will get more tensed. Food is just okay and you get only kebabs after evening. Service is pathetic.You have to ask thousands times to bring your order.Considering the amount of options coming up nearby this place will surely suffer if they doesn't imrove.

THE WORST POSSIBLE 

Today after college I came here for the first time with my friend for lunch as we have heard about this pub from many. When we entered the restaurant there was no one to assist us with the seats available so we found a place for ourselves. And then guess what for almost 20 mins we were sitting there unattended. We had several eye contact with the employees but none of them came to attend us and pretended to be very busy.
The first thing I asked from the menu was a bottle of Budweiser Magnum and it was not available. So we ended up ordering a Carlsberg for us. We also ordered for crispy mushroom which arrived in time but in a cheap steel entr√©e dish in which all the other small kiosks of sector 5 serves. The quality was just ok and nothing more than that.
In due course we finished the beer and the starter and was sitting for may be another half an hour and no body came to attend us at the table. The restaurant was not busy at all and there were almost 4 managers and 6 to 7 servers on duty. They didn't come until we called.
I this entire span they didn't even ask for a glass of water. I was really awestruck by this kind of service where the servers as well as the managers just forget to ask for water.
Our next order was Cantonese chow mein and crispy chicken. The noodles had enough oil to coat our lips and it was actually dripping. I really don't have any idea that where in earth people serve gravy noodles that coats ur lips. Being a restaurant hopper and a super foodie I bed the roadside dhabas in Sec v serves better gravy chow mein than them. All the vegetables were over cooked and it was served in a half plate. The chicken was extremely chewy.

No clearance was done from the first course till the last. When I asked for the manager he came and heard all our grievances and he had nothing to say and he said let's see what I can do. And he never turned back. Again I had to ask for the bill and then they prepared it but the manager was poof gone.

This restaurant doesn't value its customers and I would suggest nobody to visit this as your last option also. For the first time I got literally irritated by the service of a restaurant.

It's just A BIG NO PEOPLE.

Im really a positive person. (A point i would like to add before i go on with this review).
After college during lunch time me and my bestie decided to drop at this place just cause its so close to our college and we have never been here, (esp reviews on zomato attracted us) so after we entered a manager asked us to change our clollege uniform,(orelse they would not serve)we did it. After that got sorted we got ourselves a seat and for next 15 minutes we were unattended. After calling the server to take order We started off with crispy chilli mushroom, carlsberg. Mushroom was good but a tad bit salty, so far so good. Another 30 minutes paased that we finished yet none of the server cleaned our table or asked for further orders.
The worst thing is about to come yet, we ordered next veg cantonese noodles and Crispy chicken. Noodles had worst cuts of vegetables, overcooked and not at all crunchy. The amount of oil that came out of the gravy noodles was hilarious as the roadside stalls had no oil in their gravy noodles, especially cantonese. Quantity too low. After lodging our greivances to the manager he just nodded his head he din feel sorry for pathetic service n food. Even again we had to get the waiters attention for a glass of water.
It was worst experience ever, plus they dont have wifi and inside restaurant no network is available. So now i believe there is no reason to visit this place ever.

Ps- Thank you for no hospitality. And please stop following any kind of rules as you dont know basic etiquettes of serving your customers.

An unforgettable experience!! Whatever might be the height of appreciation, it will always be less...Mutton Patiala, Tandoori Chilli Chicken and Bhetki (fish) fry are a must try.Even Chicken cheese stick also deserves mention.
Opium is very pocket friendly and also they provide adequate quantity.Last but not least their service is also good.Hardly they take 15mins after placing order.

Been there many many times, giving an official review today..
The IT Bar of Kolkata..best place to hang out with friends after a nerve-wrecking day at office üëç
What we can have at Opium : 
1) A standard ambience
2) Decent collection of alcohol
3) Mouth-watering appetizers and Kebabs
 Must to have : Mutton Patiala, Oriental Omelet, Tawa Fish ‚úåüèΩÔ∏è
4) Music - Pink Floyd, Bryan Adams - mostly ü§òüèª
5) A good crowd
6) Cooperative staffs and quick delivery.
7) Reasonable rates of food and drink which is kind of unbelievable üò≥ 
and lastly, people queuing at the gate to grab seats üòì difficult during Monsoon.
One pain point : Washroom should be more clean and perfumed..
Overall, Its a fun place to be with fun loving people.. Lovely to have some drinking game or Daaru - pe - Charcha !! üòâ
Cheers üçª

I heard from people that opium is a very good place and was pretty much excited to visit it... However my experience was not that great.. We had ordered from the Indian menu - price was reasonable, but the quantity was also quite less.. A plate of Kashmiri pulao would be sufficient for average eating people (without sharing).. We wanted to order Kashmiri pulao, some roti/naan and chicken tikka masala... No breads were available, instead the staffs insisted us on ordering some noodles instead of breads... Probably they prefer noodles with indian side dish..

Also, we ordered pineapple raita - the curd was stale with a pungent taste, sugar wasn't mixed properly.. They somehow added sugar n pineapple cubes to the stale curd and served it... 

In a place like sector 5, where there numerous corporate offices, and people even visit for team lunch / dinner, this kind of service is not expected.. Not visiting again...

Opium is probably the best bar-cum-restaurant within an affordable pocket pinch, Kolkata has as of now. It is located at the far end of the street, running alongside RDB boulevard, at Sector 5, Saltlake. Been here a few times, and everytime its lively ambience amazed me. 
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Clad with posters and photos of world famous bands like Bon Jovi, Metallica, Linkin Park etc...the small outlet sports a large TV screen that often allows live streaming of many games. The tunes of "Comfortably Numb" or the entire collection of Pink Floyd, occasionally punctured by the cacophony of animated discussions among local working IT professionals, creates an atmosphere similar to that of a "Bangali parar adda". 
They have a vast bill of fare, although may be not that vast a choice of aqua vitae. The food is really good. During my Last visit, I was rather looking to have some quick snacks. I enjoyed their Crispy Chilli Babycorn which was fresh and tasty. Crispy Chicken (many small to medium pieces of crunchy fried boneless chicken) was mouthwatering too. Fresh lime soda was well prepared and complimented my dishes perfectly.
                            The service is a bit slow. But the staff are courteous. They have comfortable sofas for groups as well as two-chair-tables for couples. Overall, this is a nice place for hangout with quality food.

It was day before yesterdayevening when me and two my seniors Tanwyee Ray and Swarnabi Pal caught up and planned for a chill out time. We chose Opium for this.
We three met at the RDB cinemas in Sector 5, Salt Lake. Just a few metres' walk straight ahead from there, takes up to Opium which welcomes with a large wooden gate door with the name "Opium" inscribed. So its quite easily locatable.
The entrance takes us to the inside of the pub. We took a sofa seating for us to be comfortable. The seating was very comfortable with round pillow cushions added to the sofa seat. The ambience is decent and good. The decor is completely wooden, with various wall hangings and frames. On one side, is the bar area. The pub is quite spacious, and well organised.
Food and Drinks that we had ordered -
1. Breezer - it was a cranberry breezer served in the regular bottle as it comes, served chilled.
2. Stuffed Omlette - it was a big portion of egg omlette, with chicken and mushroom stuffings. The stuffings were in enough quantity. And it tasted good.
(We had opted for a half plate of Chicken Tandoori but it was unavailable at that particular time.)
3. Chicken Lollipop - we chose this then. These were well cooked and fried properly. Tasted decent.
4. Melibu Cocktail - Loved this cocktail drink. It was a vodka based drink with a sheer taste and flavour of coconut which made it stand out. Really a good one!
5. Tequilla Sunrise - Very mild cocktail. Loved its fruity smell and taste.
6. Fried Mutton - After lots of chicken dishes, we chose this mutton dish, as being fried mutton, it seemed to be a starter dish, so we ordered it. It had a tight gravy, spicy, cooked with onions and capsicum. I loved this mutton dish as it tasted really good, and also it had quite an adequate quantity.
7. Smirnoff Martini - It was a Vodka based somewhat strong cocktail. Presented and served well, with salt granules at the edges of the vessel. It was good enough too.
The bill was somewhat on the higher side as they had various taxes levied on to it, too. 
However, nice place to hangout and chill out with friends.

Opium is one of the few bars which has maintained its quality of food and efficiency of service for a considerable period of time, I like the cheese cherry pineapple stick and chicken steak, the place is mostly choco bloc on Friday, though the ambience is not that great but still a good hangout place because of it's effective pricing.

Opium is a pretty cool place to hang out with your friends and/or colleagues. The restaurant is definitely value for money as the food here is both good and reasonably priced. On our last visit, we ordered from the Chinese food menu, along with the special papads listed in the vegetarian section. The drinks included green apple vodka, whiskey, and a breezer. We really enjoyed the food and the drinks equally. The interiors are fine and the service is decent as well. Just grab a seat in the far interior of the restaurant and you would be good to go.

Foods are good, drinks prices are....well it's pretty much what you should expect from a bar located in the business district of salt lake. It's quite good for an afternoon drinks with your colleagues or a Sunday drinks with your mates. The atmosphere is quite groovy and doesn't really fits the mold of the conventional crampy bars. Best part is that this bar is suitable for you if you wanna take your lady out for a drink. The patrons are quite civilised based on my experiences.

Went thr last night around 10:30pm. it was pretty crowded even then. Ambience is okayish. Bar with loud music kind.ordered mutton patiala, mixed fried rice. Amazing mutton patiala. In love with it. Dhaba style mutton masala wrapped in a thick omlette topped with some cheese. Fried rice was pretty ordinary. The whole rating is entirely based on the mutton patiala.

We choose Opium for a get together party with friends. Little difficult to find it, GPS also very confusing and misdirect us. It is near SDF More,close to BBQ Nation.
Seats are available on Sunday 2pm with out prior booking for 7 persons. Nice cool interior, Live Sports show, comfortable seating, Quick and Prompt serving

No Happy Hours available, but limited offers on selective liquors like Antiquity, Smirnoff etc.
We ordered Black Dog 8yr, Carlsberg beer and Smirnoff.

Starters are delicious. Specialy Onion Pepper Chicken, Mexican Fish. We also ordered Chicken Cheese Stick, Reshmi Kabab and Tandoori Kabab. Those are nice.

Few Main courses like Mixed Hakka Noodles (sweet in taste), Chicken Fried Rice (tastes like Jeera Rice), Chili Chicken (pathetic in taste).

I also got corporate discount 10% after showing my ID card.

Moral: Nice budget Pub with delicious starter, they need to concentrate on main courses too

Been recommended by friends so many times that finally decided to try this place.The USP of this place is a bar serving delicious food.So even those who don't booze or sip can definitely visit the place.Since it's located in the Sector 5 hence mostly you would find the place thronged with IT crowd.It never stroke our mind that lunch hours even on a Saturday can be so busy.Tried our luck on Mutton Patiala,Oriental Omelette and Mixed Hakka Noodles.Oh man,how divine was the Mutton Patiala!!The mutton was tender and spicy and wrapped in an omlette.The Oriental Omlette packed with cheesy mushrooms and chicken sure did justice to our taste buds.The Hakka Noodles was as usual.But the prawns served in the noodles were stale and stank.Immediately we placed a complaint and asked the waiter to serve the noodles after removing the prawns.The staff acknowledged the same and acted accordingly. This is the only reason, I couldn't rate this place with a whole 5.The Mutton and the Omlette were overwhelming and at the end we two couldn't finish off the noodles.The place is a must-go for those who love to indulge in non-veg.I'm myself looking forward to try my hands on the other mouthwatering dishes they offer.

Take the lane beside the Infinity tower. Go straight and you'll hit the dead end. It'll lie to your left.
The ambiance is good. Particularly a place for the office goers in salt lake.
We had a few drinks and ordered Bhetki zezero. They gave two small fillet fries. Which was pretty disappointing. There were french fries and boiled vegetables sauted in butter.
I loved it absolutely.

Opium is the first choice for the office goers around sector V, on a Friday night. A bit too crowded, okayish in decor, and slow in service, this place is known for cheap alcohol and quality food. Tandoori chicken, tawa chicken, badami kebab, cheese chicken sticks, are the specialities in the list of starters. Pan fried noodles and Thai curries are taste busters. Did not try much of Indian main course, however loved the mutton keema, rogan josh, and chicken tikka butter masala. If you manage to get seats, you won't regret the whatever is on the plate, however there is a lot of room for improvement when the service is concerned.

Anybody working in and around sector 5 will definitely know of this place, it remains mostly occupied by IT professionals most of the day. To start with its a place to hangout with friends colleagues and booze and eat while having loads of adda. The alcohol is served at very reasonable rate and there are 3-4 TVs where you can watch live games, so it's kinda sort of a sports pub. The food is quite okay in taste, i would suggest for starters since they are tasty and doesn't pinch the pocket much. The service quality is good but the place isn't quite big so managing a table on weekends maybe take some time. It is located near the rdb boulevard so you can catch a movie after or before hopping into this place.

If you're working in Salt lake and want cheers to a peg or two with some good music and pretty decent snacks then drop yourselves at Opium because this is POCKET FRIENDLY (a quality bars in Salt lake usually don't have). Fish lovers, please order their bhetki zezzora, it has fish and cheese although be ready to be disappointed at the proportion served.

The ambiance is well suited.The drinks served here have the best prices in Sec V. Moreover we get 10% disc as corporate benefits. Food is extremely well. So all the foodie who want a proper restaurant with bar,here it is. Try fish irani,chicken omelet, drums of heaven. Its really nice.Only drawbacks are that they don take reservation and weekends are extremely crowded with waiting period of nearly an hour.

Opium serves the most delicious food among all the bars in Sector V area. With our drinks we ordered Bekti Zazero, Mutton Patiala & Dry Chilly Chicken. All the items were tasty enough but I was simply blown away by the 1st two - extremely well cooked & mouth watering. Bekti Zazero has the deadly combination of Cheese fillings stuffed in fried Bhetki (Barramundi) pieces whereas Mutton Patiala has juicy succulent mutton pieces wrapped in an omelette. For a first timer these are must try items at opium. The waiters are polite, well behaved and helpful. Only possible concern is the cost which is a bit on the higher side but it is totally worth it.
Keep up the good work!

This place deserves to be my very first review on zomato..!! My go to place for every other weekend.. Its a block away from my office.. mostly filled with IT crowd.. not cause it's just around the corner.. or coz there is corporate discount on drinks... the food is simply put lipsmacking... and paired with the rock music in the background... makes me go back time and again.. The service is fast and its also pocket friendly..
Must try's would be orient-al omelette(omelette filled with cheese, chicken and mushroom) , tandoori chilly chicken( tandoori chicken tossed spicy sauce), chicken senakati(tandoori chicken with cheese stuffing) and cherry cheese pineapple(which is served on an ice bed)..

One of the famous office para of kolkata...Opium is a perfect place for after office hangout with a good stocked liquor, this pub is quite famous at sector v area.
Though the decor is nothing fancy but it's offbeat and comfortable. Ambiance is lively generally the crowd is the employees who are working over their and wants to relax a bit.
The place is quite reasonable...Service is bit slow.
One of my favorites dishes are CHEESE CHILLY MUSHROOMS, MUTTON PATIYALA,FISH CHEESE STICKS. ( Recommend )

A little too shady for a date but a lot fun too go out with friends. The ambiance isn't something great in particular but the pocket friendly menu pulls in crowds in huge amounts, which often leads to lines outside their medieval style gate. Group of friends going out can easily pay out, without getting a hole burnt in their pocket. Recommended for the latter half of the month especially ;)

Opium started out as one of the few hangout places with college friends. Small place, but th3 interiors are done well. Has basically three portions (although undifferentiated) a small lounge, a drinks corner and the table zone! :p

Ambience: good.
Price:reasonable.
Food quality:nice.
Service:good.No sorry.Very good.

If you have your car/2wheeler, you can park them in the parking lot available infront and around the place. Chargeable by the parking lot guys though. If you are regular at RDB for films, this place might be your choice for food after a film!!

Ah! A typical after-office hangout pub. The vibrant decor is similar to that of any good pubs there around the city. It isn't that classy or offbeat but is young and lively. Food served along with the drinks are way good compared to the food served normally in a standard pub!

I've been here like a dozen times and always in a team of 6, always seated at the same cozy corner in front of the TV, ordered the same out of the world mutton patiala with a mix of drinks and fantastic memories to be nostalgic about. The service is good and the crowd is superb. The cosiest corner literally at saiktor paanch!

Too! My first Kolkata pub.
Beer collection: average!
Food: very nice! Suitably especially mutton Patiala and chilly chicken tandoori and Hakka chicken noodles!
Ambience: yes okay. But expected to be much more good.
On a whole I'll recommend it.

I have been visiting Opium since 2004/2005, ever since the time this was first opened up. Salt Lake lacked good bar then, and most of us had gone bored with the likes of Silver Sands and Mishras. Although, the place wasn't easy to reach, it offered good and cheap booze with great ambiance.

I believe ambiance was what had made this place an instant hit. Tucked at one end of the lane, near to RDB Boulevard, the sitting was cozy. The tables and chairs, decently spaced from one another, the bar with its attractive looks, the cozy sofas while entering the bar-cum-restaurant, it was a total package. The price of the drinks was unbelievable cheap, and was a notch higher than Mishras.¬†

I was particularly fond of the food here. Chicken Salt n Pepper, Crispy Chicken, Noodles, Kung Pao Chicken; I loved them all. When Chicken Balentine was first introduced, I had the pleasure of trying it as well. The captains who used to work here then were all familiar with our faces so much so that, when I paid a visit an year back after a gap of 4-5 years, one of them, an aged man had no problem in recognizing me.

I have had some of the best moments of my life here. Sitting hours with my buddies, most of them who have a separate life now. The countless booze and umpteen smoking, the people here caring less in what you were doing, their personal love, care and affection; and not to forget the 10% concession I used to receive for being a regular here then, this is one place I surely wish to go back someday and start all over again!

Note: Most of the food items mentioned above are not served here any longer.

This is your classic pub. A friend referred this place and their specialty Chicken Senakati. I took a chilled Heineken and ordered the specialty! The presentation wasnt much but they make up for it with innovativeness and good taste! What is better than chicken tandoori you ask..its one that is tandoori from the outside, and afgani from the inside. 
The pub does not have a great appeal from the outside but the interiors have a nice finish and the place is usually crowded with IT employees from close by corporates. It is economical and would be my regular hang out if I had a pack of guy friends and a knack for drinking.

OPIUM !!! Really it is. Its just next to my work place and thus I have been there quiet a few times. The most reasonable bar cum restaurant in the area with a good ambience and some great food. I had a few good dishes there from which the two that keeps repeating in my visits are the chicken patiala and the mutton liver masala. I simply love it. And the liquor rates here are much less then most of the places in kolkata. It has always been a good experience and will hope for more. See you soon !!!

This place reminds me of McLarens pub from himym. Ambience is really amazing along with their selection of songs and all. Food is above average. Mutton Patiala is a signature dish here. Its veg counterpart is equally good. About the service its a little slow as compared to the amount of people attending the tables. However it is always a good place to chill with colleagues or friends after office.

Located in sector V in the same lane as rdb cinemas, Opium is a popular place to chillax for the officegoers. I went here long time back with my partner after a movie. The ambience is good to relax with decent music. Ordered beer and breezers along with chicken badami kebab and fish tikka. The chicken kebab was outstanding. The fish was very spicy though i can eat spicy food. Pricing was reasonable and thats also a reason for the crowd. Awesome it was

This is the most happening place in and around sector v. The ambiance is very good with good quality of music. Also they have large screen tv and also few smaller once which make an excellent place during matches. The service is good and drinks are reasonably priced. But the selling point is their food. It is exceptionally well. And quality remains as it is for last 5/6 years. Be it the oriental omelette or the lemon fried fish or the mutton patiawala all are superb. A must visit for any food lovers.

I've been here on one of our bff outings. Not a big fan of their decor, it's basically simple and a bit dark. Nothing too extraordinary and fancy. Most of us are non-drinkers yet we went there because we'd heard some praises about their food. We mostly ordered chinese and one or two North Indian dishes. I must say the food lived upto the praise. They serve the best crispy chilli babycorn! Hands down the best i've tasted as of yet. But what was disturbing is the behavior of their staff. We were repeatedly and quite loudly laughed and frowned upon for not ordering anything from the drinks menu and their staff repeatedly came upto ask us even after we had politely refused. Overall, good food but not so great service!

One of the best hangout places in this area. For a group that loves rock music and are into sports, the conversations will never stop.. All thanks to the setup of the place. Menu wise, they have everything that any other restaurant has to offer, but the food is real good. Two of my favourite usuals here are the "Thai chicken spicy", which is a preparation similar to chicken lollypop but is really very delicious, and the "mutton lever masala". The only thing that might disappoint one is finding a seat, but that's only because the place is so great. Weekends or weekdays, for a bunch, this a great place to chat over food.

I have been to Opium so many times that If I had written a review for each time I would have been a 
connoisseur by now ! :) 

This is probably the best and most loved watering hole for all Techies in Sector V . 

Have been patronising this place for probably the last 10 yrs .

Good Service coupled with reasonable prices on drinks and a above average food menu are it's string suites !

Chinese is good but things that stand out are the Mexican Fish and Peshawari Omlette !

3 Cheers to them for making the office para a bit more bearable !!!

After one of my senior office colleague got promotion, he treated us here. Well, it was my first time at Opium. Enough stories now... I will cut to the chase:
Ambience: good. Even if you are going for a drink or two. Decor is very good.
Food: we ordered chicken tandoori with beers as starters, followed by fish finger, masala kulcha and chicken manchurian. Food Quality was very good.
Soft music was going on at one part of the restaurant and tv was there in another part.
All-in-all, it was a 'good old treat' with sumptuous and tasty food and good company.

Definitely recommended.

Opium - does it need any introduction? It is new age pub of Kolkata, similar to Olypub of Sector V - IT Hub (new gen's office para). 
Pros- pocket friendly price, ambience is good - music played in such a volume you can have gossip with your romantic partner or friends, service is fast & helpful, smoking zone is just outside of it, perfect location for partying.
Cons- no hookah ( Chai Break is there for you), closing time at 11:30pm

The good thing about this place is that inspite of being a watering hole admist IT hub it serves a great food. The ambience is pretty subjective with mainly rock music being played but to me its really great. The crowd is also good with rowdy folks being pretty less / rare. The rates I wont say is economical but more into the mid segment range (say 2.5x the retail drink price).Oriental omlete (cheese, chicken. mushroom stuffing in an omlette) has been an eternal charm of this place and its indeed recomended. Chichken Items are also worth trying. Didnt try out mutton / fish but heard that they are good as well.

I went there for meeting a school friend over lunch so couldn't take the risk to drink much. It's ¬†good thing that they give corporate discount. We took Sex-on-the-beach.

My office is in Sector V and this is the place where we all go to let our tiredness be at peace. Despite being famous as a bar the food is awesome from starters to main course . Both the Chinese and Indian food is very good. I will suggest Mexican fish, Lemon Fd Dish, Fish Irani , Tangri Kebab and specially Mutton Patiala is a must try with butter nun or tandoori roti these are my favorites. Whether for drinks or for full tummy lunch/dinner this place is very much worthy for a visit. The ambiance is very good, the music is very much soothing. They even played my favorite sound track. You will get 10% corporate discount on drinks here as well.
A must try for all foodies and alcoholics like me ;)

In drinks we had green apple flavored vodka, Budweiser beer and soft drinks. The restro is quite cozy with a great ambiance.

Went with my cousin for beer, but liked the lime flavoured breezer so much that had 7 of them. :P the place is really nice. The ambience is truly enticing. Good variety of drinks. The food was awesome. The only thing I have tasted in veg is cheese balls which were amazing. The cheese melted in the mouth. The bad part is that they remove it from the menu during the festive season. The non vegetarian dishes were awesome too. The prices are reasonable and the service impeccable. We were sitting on the counter(side of the bar table) as there was no empty table. We told our waiter to take us to a table when it gets empty. And honestly, with the delicious food and breezers, we totally forgot about it. Even then, the waiter informed us of an empty table and the added to our delight.

Good ambience.
Food wasn't excellent, but good only.
We ordered Paneer tikka which was average.
Next is Fish Irani which was good.
Next is chilli Paneer dry...not good.
Next is chicken Patiala... Average in taste.
It was something like Bengali style kasha chicken with omelet wrap.
The worst part I feel about this place is the staffs.
I knew that this is a place for drinks and hangout.
Food would be OK type.
Still I expected some suggestions from the staffs as I asked them many times to serve their best foods. They weren't telling anything.

Despite all this, we had great time over there with beers.

Hard Rock Cafe of Sector V..! Never gonna disappoint you... It's simply the best one can expect at a price they gonna quote you for... And if u lucky to be a chap working in and around sec v, u get a 10% discount on drinks as well! My personal favourite is the Fish Irani.. Even if you r not too fond of fishes, just give it a shot! N with the cricket fever round the corner, nothing can b more exciting than sitting with a beer mug n enjoying a match! Presently it has become a bit difficult to get a seat due to its immense craze among the corporate guys..! So just make sure you visit with some buffer time before u get the chance to enter!

This place situated in the heart of IT sector of kolkata is a very popular hang out place for the office goers, people mainly go there to have drinks but 8 of us office colleagues went there to have proper meal and the absolute great quality of food has blown our mind, never expected the food items to be such wonderful in a place which is mainly a bar. The sitting arrangement is like a lounge, not like a proper dine in restaurant, spacious area, loud music playing, overall apt ambiance for a bar. we ordered plenty of items, fish irani, chicken badami, panir tikka, masala kulcha, plain naan, veg fried rice, non veg mixed fried rice, triple seczwan fried rice, garlic chicken, chilli paneer, mutton rara punjabi, chicken chettinad, fresh lime soda etc and believe it or not both indian and chinese items were top notch, absolutely lip smacking and the price is very very pocket friendly.. Though its not a family dining place but a wonderful place to give a party with friends, service is good also. Overall had a wonderful time here and its highly recommended place for food lovers of the vicinity..

This place was quite famous in this locality. Everyone will ask you to go n visit opium. Been to lot of places in bangalore, I was not that satisfied with this place. One thing was that it was the only good pub near to IT parks plus it was pocket friendly bar too. We ordered beer, some chicken n fish Tikka. Food was average by standards. They didn't even have beer pint of most of the beers so we had to order the full bottles. Overall it's a okay pub where one can go n have some beer. 
Eat'a'lot!

If you are looking to spend some quality time with friends along with having alcohol and delicious foods coupled with good music,then Opium is the place to be.The bar is reasonably priced and the dark bluish ambiance is an added advantage. Undoubtedly,one of the best pubs in Kolkata.

Ambiance: 4.5/5
Food: 4/5 Though quantity was a bit lower than any standard restaurant.
Service: 2/5. They lags a lot in service. One need call again and again to get attention of an waiter. But they are well behaved.
Food to Cost: 3.5/5. It was satisfactory.

This one is absolutely befitting for a hangout with your buddies. The interiors are dim litted and you will like the ambient when you enter..A non drinker will not feel like a fish out of a pond because of its collection of mouth smacking delicacies..Special Mention: Chicken Patiala

Ah,if there is a bar in Kolkata which ticks all the right boxes,then Opium it is.Noone will find alcohol in such decent prices with so many options on the food front with the rustic Chinatown and modern lounge combo feel anywhere in Kolkata. Mutton Patiala is a must have item here.Beware,this is not a one time visit joint-it truly has addictive potential and you will find yourself here frequently if you happen to have few good friends!

Well if you are working in IT and putting up in Kolkata this is one place every individual would have visited once..... I have visited this place quite a few times but have always forgot to rate this, but finally found an opportunity to do so..... Opium if you are expecting sleek classy crowd, definitely not the place... The crowd is a good mix of young spunky people and mid aged people, which personally i find very amicable... Good music... alcohol is good, decently priced..not very taxing to the wallet.... food well i would rate average, but then i have never gone here for full fledged dinner.... So i would give that a pass... I would suggest to go to this place with all your friends for a good round alcohol and some good time reminiscing old times.. Cheers !!

Happy Munchin :)

Been there done that.  That place in sector 5 where hordes of zombies walk in on Fridays. If you work near that area, you know what I mean.  This place doesn't disappoint anyone either. Right from the music to the drinks to the lip-smacking starters.  

The Mutton patiala is a must have, even if you don't go for drinks.  Fish cheese sticks are a favourite too.  
One complain though.  The place sucks when it rains.  Ankle deep water when it rains isn't something you want to walk in to after a hard day/week at work.

Well it was a "within-a-minute" decision by us to make a boring evening happening. This place has its own repute. Visited a few times. But couldn't find time to pen it down. Luckily waiting period was shorter this time. We were placed in the back room which is a bit crampy when compared to the main sit out. We didn't mind though. Started with Mutton Liver Masala n Patiala Chicken along with booze, quite obvious ;) I liked the way they served patiala chicken, chicken pieces wrapped in a chapati type thing, most probably made of egg n bread crumbs. Frankly speaking it was a bit cumbersome to cut it with knives n then hav it. I mean come on, who would like to do all these when booze is on n we need a easier thing to munch on. Liver fry was a let down. We had to fish out liver pieces from the pool of vegetables which was equally oily n saucy. A bit down.... moved on to Chilli Fish n Lemon Fried Chicken. Thankfully I liked these two.... better. Though chilli fish was a bit tangy but it went good with the taste of 100 pipers :p
Verdict: A pocket friendly junction to booze n munch in the middle of 'the sector V'. That's it.

Been there few times now. This review points to my latest visit, a few weeks back.
Ambience wise a drinkers paradise. Loud music, good crowd, dim lights and live sports on screen. But this is only for the main room or hall whatever u call it. The space on the backside is crampy n not v good. Was seated there this time.
Service ok. Didn't take much time. Waiters were decent. Ordered lemon fried chicken (4 pieces, tangy lemon flavored), pan fried chilly fish( ok, not v good. Oily), mutton liver fry (less liver pieces, more of fillers, quantity should have been better), chicken patiala (basically a chicken wrap, again too oily for me).
Drinks were served in whiskey glasses.
Main course we had mixed hakka noodles only. Decent proportions. Good amounts of "minced" chicken n egg.
Pocket pinch : Around 4500 for 4 guys including alcohol.
Verdict: Is the quality on the wane? I hope not

A place perhaps every sector 5 guy will swear by as the perfect place to relax and unwind after those nine hours of corporate bulldhit. Decent ambiance, and some finger smacking delicacies keep its target customers keep frequenting this place. Had my fair share of memories of this place.

Went for a quick meet up. This is the most popular pub in sec v and one will always find it crowded especially on Friday evenings. Ordered 2 elephant beer , vodka and Oriental Omlett. Interiors are quite cool full of Bob Marley and Curt Cobain pics. The music being played were mostly of Floyd.I loved the omelette which my friend recommended . It was heavy and stuffed with chicken cubes and mushroom I guess. As I chewed it I also got the taste of cheese in it which I loved. Pocket pinch was not on the higher side.

Ever been at Sector 5 and searching for a place to booze with friends? Think no more and drop by Opium. But you gotta have patience, as there's always a crowd during peak hours. We had to wait for 40 minutes straight. The ambience is a bit dark, and smoky but cool. Music is good. There's different variety of drinks. Normal vodka or beer are good enough and pocket-pinch is okay. We ordered a cocktail, screwdriver. Costly much, but did not live upto the expectations. All in all, a good and clean place and surely lets you have a good time with friends.

Very dark inside, and the sitting isn't comfortable. You could be forgiven for thinking of the place as a dingy waterhole.

The food however is good, though the service again is a bit slow.

I have lost the count of how many times i have been to this place. We kept coming here when i used to work in Omega tower but the frequency lessened when i shifted to the nearby Technopolis. The place is awesome - perfect ambiance to spend quality time with friends over lots of booze. Sometimes it gets very loud though. This time around i was with 2 of my very close friends with whom i was meeting after very long. We chatted over gulps of red monk and peanut masala and chicken kebabs. For main course we had chicken butter masala and tandoori roti. It's never the food here but always the alcohol but as a bonus the food is also good here. Without saying will visit again.

I meant to write a review for Opium for a long time now. Located at the heart of Kolkata's tech-paradise, Sector V, Opium is everything you wish for at the end of a hard day or week of work. The ambience is pretty good. The music is never too loud and they have a collection of nice classic playlists like Floyd, G'n'R, Eagles and so on. The drinks are reasonably priced and you get a wide range of selections across a wide price range.
Although Opium has a reputation of being a watering hole, the food here is amazing. Must have's at Opium are: Mutton/Chicken Patiala, Irani Fish Kebab, Chilli Tandoori Chicken, Mexican Fish, Oriental Omlette.
If you are in and around Sector V - or even if you aren't :P - head to this place to chill out. One word of caution - it is full everyday after 8. Especially on Fridays and 'salary days' :P. But that is a good thing because generally that is an indicator of the quality of a place.

Opium is a drug which attracts the people in a same way this bar cum restaurant just beside infinity tower attracts sec 5 office goers.
Jam packed in Friday evening we headed down at 6pm n when we left,it was 8.30.
I don't take much food with drinks,so I ordered the basic...
1. Fish finger (6-7 pcs were there n good starter with drinks). So I rate it 7 on 10.
2. french fries (as usual, nothing worth mentioned) Rating 7 on 10.
3. chicken tandoor (as it priced,the chicken pieces could have been bigger). Rating 7 on 10.
4. Only I have 1 COMPLAIN ABOUT THE AMBIENCE. When we entered the bar, they  had very soothing ambience,light n good music was around. But as the time passed on,the music became louder n louder amazingly n at 7.30-8 pm it was so loud that we had to scream for talking. It was terrifically loud as if dancing floor around somewhere. Surely we would take another 1 or 2 drinks,but we just left out getting very irritated.
The loudness of music in a small room is very uncomfortable (rating 2 on 10).

I want to keep it really simple - in my opinion, the best alternative to BACKSTAGE in all aspects due to the latter's exorbitant cost of everything. The ambience and the music, both being very much hallucinating, will surely get you high, but the only downside is their seating arrangements.

Opium is pretty popular among Sector V IT professionals specially because of the Corporate discount. But sadly the Corporate discount is only on the drinks. It doesn't apply on the food and I can really guess why. The dishes are exquisite however it will not blow your mind.
We had ordered Bhetki Zezero, Mutton Patiala and Tandoori Chilly Chicken along with drinks
Bhetki Zezero was a little bland while Tandoori Chilly Chicken was a tad bit salty. Mutton Patiala though delicious, was not something that goes with your drinks since it was way too rich
The service is very prompt and we had to hardly wait for our orders to arrive. The ambience is the USP of this place. I loved it the instance I stepped into Opium.
All in all its a good place to hit with your collegues after a hectic day. Sit down with some drinks to talk about how frustrating IT is and don't bother ordering food--go home and have dinner with your family
Special tip: A panwala sits just outside Opium who makes amazing pans. So drop by on your way out and you'll get to taste one of the best pans of your life

I had to leave Kol after my first job but heard a lot of this place from my friends as their watering hole around sector5. That said during this visit me and my friend here wanted a place to hang out and we had lots to catch up on. We decided to hangout somewhere closer to home and Opium was the only suggestion in sec5.

The place has good ambiance. Framed pics of rockstars on the wall but seating can be improved. Specially the 2 seaters. the chairs need to be made more comfortable. The drinks are cheap. BP60 costs 165 before tax to give you an idea. Moreover they have offers and corporate discounts. Good stock of brands as well. Absinthe, Jaegar-bomb are available, but not the green fairy.

Amazing dishes will be continental omelette, patiala mutton and mutton fry. The crowd knows what the famous dishes are and i could see the roti wrapped patiala mutton on at-least 3-4 table. 

I was having a great time but the wow factor was not there that makes a place a 5 star and not a 4. At around 9 they started playing almost blu-ray version of Pink Floyd live at Earls Court concert on their humongous lcd. It transformed the atmosphere immediately (at-least for those who care). 

5 stars from me, everything was perfect, great food, cheap price, corporate discounts, good ambiance, awesome music , absinthe and floyd. What more do you want?

A perfect place to hangout with your friends. The ambience is good gives you the whole "today is Friday start of a great weekend" vibes. The drinks are comparatively cheaper here which is a plus. Of the starters loved the crispy fish, crispy chicken and chicken lollipops. Mexican fish was not what I expected. But the other starters were really good. Though main course is average and their anything schezwan lack the heat. But overall a chilled out place to just chill.

The place is absolutely befitting for a Friday night hang out with colleagues; as quite evidently put up by the crowd waiting outside for seats. The interiors flaunts a dim litted environment with loud music playing. The bar counter is impressive. 

Although being a non drinker, it didnt seem outwardly at all, as the place serves some amazing mouth smacking delicacies. We ordered for Crispy Chicken and Crispy Babycorn both of which was awesome. In the main course we ordered for Mutton Patiala. Its a terrific dish which I had for the first time. We also savoured Chicken Tikka Masala with Naan. Everything was too good. 

Nothing more could have been expected from this much talked about food corner.

Even though Mumbai is known for pub culture I think Kolkata can boast of this one quite reasonably. I have not been to many pubs in Kolkata as much as I had been to the ones in Mumbai, but this place offers quite an awesome ambience with young crowd hovering all around inside those walls. Two of us went there to celebrate birthday. The decor  gives the place a vintage look and songs like hotel California, pink Floyd sets the place on a roll. 
We ordered murgh senakati for starter and let me tell u all it tasted delicious. basically it was roasted chicken with cheese stuffed inside and the hot cheese just melts in your mouth making you feel like heaven.
In the main course we ordered mixed fried rice with Thai chicken in red sauce .the portions were generous for 2 and tasted good. Also liquor was decently priced as mentioned by my friend
I rated this place 3.5 as I need to visit again and again to give it a complete thumbs up.

I was paying this a visit after half a decade and boy,has it become popular! On a tuesday evening,around 6.30 it was teeming with people with us having to wait for a table for two for about 5-10 mins,but it was totally worth it. The ambience,though,is not something too much to talk about. What I liked about the place is the vibe,the constant chatter of hapoy people digging merrily into yummylisciousm food and the clank of the forks and spoons on the fast moving plates,'cause the menu list is long and the service is quite fast. I was quite fascinated to find a mutton starter on the menu,that too boneless,besides some uncommon items like chicken/fish cheese sticks,chicken ballentine,masala omlette etc. Moreover, it is a tad less expensive on the pocket than its neighbouring food joints. All in all,I came back with all smiles and with a hope to visit it again soon!

Good place to hang out.. rates are very less compared to other pubs like shimmers nd backstage.. infact i found the rates very much like chinatown.. happy for the pocket.. fiod is very good.. here are a few suggestions to the managemnt:

1. Please increase manpower.. we waited atleast 10 mins just for sm1 to tk the order... and the food took 40+ mins.. i understand that days like Sunday it happns.. but i hv been 3 tyms.. all the days the experience was the same...

2. Please please expand the washrooms... my God... the height of entrance is so low.. i banged my head thrice yesterday.. 5'9" should be head banging... and only 2 urine pots... c'mn... we are to drink alchohol and get on a queue... not good.

Opium was the first place that started serving alcohol to us in Sector 5. Thus, for obvious reasons it would be a place that would be frequented by office goers of Sector 5. It included me, and I ended up being a regular till the beginning of 2013.
 There are a few cult favorites in food that I have at Opium. Mutton Patiala, Lemon Chicken and Oriental Omelette are the best of the lot. Pineapple Raita as a dessert is amazing too. These are must orders, when you visit Opium.
Alcohol is on the cheaper side considering the ambience that they provide. 
They provide a 10% corporate discount. So, do not forget that next time you visit Opium.

Sector 5 salt lake kind of grew up with Opium as its best organ. Subtle pop and rock and yellow balls of light decking the bar/restaurant gets the girl in you up and impatient. Alcohol is served with utmost quirkiness, choice of which is slightly limited, but once a regular, you get tuned to their brands. Food is a league apart. Hot and steaming menu in there. Personal favorite- Oriental Omlette and Mutton Patiala. Service? 10 on 10. 
Do not try Long Island Iced Tea though, only hiccup so far in 6 years of boothing.

Opium was the first place that started serving alcohol to us in Sector 5. Thus, for obvious reasons it would be a place that would be frequented by office goers of Sector 5. It included me, and I ended up being a regular till the beginning of 2013.
 There are a few cult favorites in food that I have at Opium. Mutton Patiala, Lemon Chicken and Oriental Omelette are the best of the lot. Pineapple Raita as a dessert is amazing too. These are must orders, when you visit Opium.
Alcohol is on the cheaper side considering the ambience that they provide. 
They provide a 10% corporate discount. So, do not forget that next time you visit Opium.

Sector 5 salt lake kind of grew up with Opium as its best organ. Subtle pop and rock and yellow balls of light decking the bar/restaurant gets the girl in you up and impatient. Alcohol is served with utmost quirkiness, choice of which is slightly limited, but once a regular, you get tuned to their brands. Food is a league apart. Hot and steaming menu in there. Personal favorite- Oriental Omlette and Mutton Patiala. Service? 10 on 10. 
Do not try Long Island Iced Tea though, only hiccup so far in 6 years of boothing.

Favourite hangout location for any body working in sector 5. B it Monday or friday, it is always crowded. Must try: mutton/  chicken patiala, mutton liver masala and obviously the drinks which are reasonably priced.

With it's wooden entrance gate and a delighting ambience, I was all set to have a pleasurable dining experience. The prices on the menu were reasonable, adding to my expectation. But the first alarm bell came when they had only 3-4 varieties of beer in the stock. I could never understand this practice, maybe they only keep the brands with higher margin or the ones that offer them more offers and merchandises. 
Anyway, I chose one and then ordered some food. Then came the real disaster. It tasted aweful. You can trust me on that. Anyone can make better food than that. It was inedible and when we requested the waiter to take it back, we were shocked by his I'll treatment. He was fighting like a bania does on the ration shop.
And that is the fatal flaw of the restaurant. They lack the three basic things essential for a good dining experience: Variety, Delicious good and service.
I would suggest to try another in case you don't want to ruin your evening.

This place is great. have Loads of memories attached to it. Excellent collection of beverage u can find in here. The food is too good and so their services are. Chill out place. Complete fun inside. Great time spends during matches and after office. The place gets high after 7pm so its better to grab a seat before that. :)
Visit often and will continue doing so. Thanks for the good memories. :)

That was my College days when half of my colg life I spent there with my friends and juniors. Everyone knows If Mr Subhodeep Ghosh is not there in College then definitely he will be in OPIUM. üòÇ
This little Gem makes  some amazing unique dishes which you will not get anywhere in kolkata. The food is that good specially the starters that I prefer OPIUM more for the Food than booze. Though the bar is pretty well stocked.
WHAT SHOULD YOU ORDER?
1. MUTTON PATIALA- This is the speciality of Opium. You should order this item without watching the menu card. üòÑ
2. ORIENTAL OMLETTE
3. TANDOORI CHILLY CHiCKEN- A full chicken tandoori tossed in a Barbeque sauce.
4. MURGH SENAKATI - Tandoori Chicken stuffed with Cheese.
5. BHETKI ZEZERO- it is basically a continental dish with two fillets of fried fish with Fries.
Basically whenever I go to this place I simply try their starters.I haven't tried their main course.
Overall this is one of the coolest pub of sector 5 with amazing food, music and eye soothing ambience and more importantly it's very much pocket friendly.

Last time when I went there could not have anything so this time I decided to try alot of stuff.
To start with we ordered chic patiala first and some chilled beer to accompany the same. It is basically a chicken prep wrapped in omelette! &wow! Seems this is gonna be the signature dish for me at least. then came crispy chicken n fish irani & old monk..too good a combo! After the starters we ordered for pan fried noodles and garlic chicken but they served us gravy noodles which might be because it was so crowded they forgot.
Otherwise it was a nice experience overall.

A quality ambiance, soft spoken and courteous service staffs, nice food and very reasonably priced drinks, Opium has all of these things!! Be with your date or with your gang, this place never disappoints!!
Choose your own poison and for food, you can try CHICKEN SENAKATI ( tandoored chicken thigh with cheese stuffed in that) , this is a real gem. MUTTON LIVER MASALA is a spicy punch and goes nice with whiskey. If you want to keep it simple, go for FISH FINGER with tarter sauce.
One great thing for people working at sector V, they give 10% discount on drink bill. If you are not regular, they may ask for id card!

One of the good options available around work places. But hygiene needs to be seriously considered as I have already pointed several time to the authorities about the presence of pests in the premises. 
Coming to the food quality. Options are good and preparation is above par. My favourite is Kaju fry. Other dishes are average so I am not mentioning anything specific.

Ambience overall was okay at the bar side but the dinner side was too bad. They took a lot of time in getting everything n waiters had to be reminded around 4-5 times so that the order comes. A bit overcrowded place I wud say.

Went to Opium today on recommendation from a friend.

First things first, just entering the place, I was extremely impressed. The bar counter layout and the seating design was really impressive

Coming to the food, we didnt order much, just some appetizers and they were pretty good. The alcohol was cheap and worthy, and they had a quite good collection available too.

A great place to hang around with friends when you are in and around Salt Lake.

Superb place to hang out. Perfect location and perfectly priced. The starters are just amazing. Best items are the mutton patiala, a minced mutton spicy mashed item stuffed inside an egg wrap. Amazing. The oriental omlette, a  big omlette with cheese stuffed with mushroom and other veggies. Chicken senakati, a tandoored chicken stuffed with cheese, this item takes time for serving. Mutton liver masala, pan fried chili fish, crispy chicken, boneless chicken pakora. Mostly all starters are very taste and mostly different. I never tried the main courses though. A must go for sector v office goers. U will love it.

A really good place to relax with friends over some beer and what-not.
Went there on a Durga Puja afternoon. Located in sector-5, this place was just as far away from the maddening crowd in the city as we wanted it to be this day.¬†
Alcohol apart, we ordered the Chicken Patiala, which was lovely (and so we ordered more of it), and a plateful of crispy chicken, which was more around okayish.¬†
Love this place for its ambiance, its decent pricing, the friendly staff, the never-emptying katori-fuls of bhujia and the fact that the tvs are all tuned into sports channels.¬†
I would definitely recommend this place for anyone who frequents the area. Really good value for money overall, I'd say.

Owing to its varieties of liquor options and also the yummy starters that they serve..this is a big hit in sector-5 vicinity!!! Have been here umpteen no of times.

Apart from that kebabs and other Chinese starters are also quite good and there is no complain about the quality they serve!!Prices are reasonable and service is also good!!!

A long term acquaintance with this place. This is where we would land up any weekend or weekdays (now that you don't get seats in the weekend). Hygiene is a concern, they don't keep the place clean,the ambiance is good otherwise. Service is good, only if you know a good number of fellas out there, otherwise do not expect an extremely customer centric approach. Must try chicken salad,Oriental omlette, fish cheese sticks, Patiala chicken/mutton. Reasonably priced, a perfect adda for the IT sector.

In salt lake sector 5 opium has a huge popularity...I heard many a times about this place.. but yesterday I got the opportunity... It was a Monday. We went there on 5.30pm.. only a couple of guests were there.. but after 6.30 it was a full house..most of them are regular customers.. the ambience was very good. Not much light but enough to illue...good space.. there is a big screen in the corner for the live screening...there were also two extra rooms for the excess people.. coming to the food, they were real tasty.. we orderd fish cheese stick, tandoori chilli chicken and mutton fry.. everybody should try those dishes...though the fish cheese stick was quite hard but the taste of mozzarella cheese was vanishing it.. the tandoori chilli chicken was spicy, you can taste the smokiness of tandoor and the spices of Chinese...and last but not the least was mutton fry.. it was boneless, soft and the spices were mixed up very carefully...just loved it..

Opium is the best bar in saltlake area. The price of the dishes are cheap and for IT Sector, it is the best place to hang out during or after office hours. They provides corporate discount also. Only the negative point, it is so much crowded  after 6pm that getting a table is very difficult.

We went to Opium on a Tuesday night to celebrate something. The location is good, since it's close to our workplace. But, the exeperience wasn't all that great.

To start with we were seated at a table for 7 (we had 5 members), but were asked to move to a smaller table. Our jovial request, that on a Tuesday so many people might not come and that we were already comfortably seated, was strictly denied and we had to move to a smaller table. The way they insisted (not requested) that we need to move was not pleasant.

Anyway, we continued with our celebration and must say that the food and the drinks were good. In fact the Long Island Iced tea which we had ordered was very well made. 

But what ruined it for us is that from 10 pm onwards they started requesting us to leave even though we hadn't finished our food. First by the waiters, then by the security guard and again by the waiters. The behavior of the waiters to start with was very indifferent and rude, and their facial expressions showed annoyance. By 10:30-40 pm we were asked so many times that we left. 

In no other so called pubs have I seen this kind of behavior, people generally dont allow any fresh orders after a certain time but they never have this urgency for cutomers to leave.

I wouldn't want to go there again. And the two stars are solely for the Drink.

Great place to hang out with friends and colleagues. Super atmosphere and ambience. The best place I have been to in sector 5 yet. The best part is you dont feel cheated by the price. Food tastes good and drinks are super good. The place can use some extra space though.

Good food, relatively cheap price, awesome location for all Sector V office goers. Ambience can be worked upon but that is not a bid deal. Really love the chicken tandoori.

I would not say it is great place to visit and excellent place to have food,but the place is very close to us. We often visit this place and enjoy. Food quality is average and service is average too. Nothing great, but kind of a place we wish to visit many more times.

Not much to look at from outside but hey this place needs no introduction. If u haven't visited this place then u don't know how lively a bar can be and how a bar should be. Great music, great food and even better ambience. Once there have d orient-al omlette and fish cheese stick. U will see all your fav rock bands PIC on the walls and you can even ask them to play ur fav songs. This treat is wat makes it a must visit at least once a month if not a week. :P

Yes it does have a good ambience.. But the service is not up to the mark..one of the waiter is quiet rude and pretending to be too smart..Food was pretty delicious, and that doesn't allowed me to find out anything negative..over all its a Good place to hangout..

One of the absolute ideal places for a Friday night hangout nearby the vicinities of the IT industry of Kolkata, Opium serves with a unique classy feeling of Irish/Scottish pubs with very classy ambiance and comfortable seating arrangements with dimly lit lights. The alcohol range(except beer) is wide enough and reasonably priced. The food, though I have not tasted much, still has a very good aroma and plays perfectly with your taste buds. Reshmi Chicken, Chicken Patiala some of the exquisites of this place which goes with my glass of whiskey. Loud music, coupled with large screens showing sports and good company....all you need for an ideal Friday night. The staff is helpful, prompt and courteous enough. The food takes a bit time to reach the table, especially on crunch hours, so its better to order the food immediately.

I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for a good time....

Best place, one can ever have think of, if you have your budget.
The thing I liked most about this place, is (or 'are'), the music and the decor (particularly those posters), and those tasty fish-cheese-sticks. Ahh!
If you want to get high, staying within your budget, give a visit to Opium. Until and unless, it's Friday eve, and don't have to fight to get a seat! :D

So last to last Sunday Mr. Sahu picked up this place in honour of my birthday. He is a regular here and was all praises for the place.
And when I entered this place, I was awestruck- it seemed to me like some replica of a Scottish pub.
The two of us settled on the comfy sofas, cut the cake and got into the celebratory mood.
My better half, knowing my taste buds and the menu both really well, went ahead with the order - Chicken Patiala for the appetizer, followed by Kashmiri Pulao and Paneer Makhani for the main course, accompanied by our glass of whiskey. The food was really tasty and I must mention that the staff is really hospitable. So, I am looking forward to my next food journey to this Highlands of spices!

Opium is located beside RDB in salt lake sector 5 and is an extremely popular joint among office goers. The d√©cor is fine and the ambiance is okay. Food is average and the drinks are not very expensive. But the place is a little shabby and cramped.

I have been to Opium plenty number of times and the last time I went was on 31Aug on Office Dinner. God ! What is wrong with you guys ? The server suggested the chef's special starter guysssss no please don't do that to your taste buds and please tell your chef to do something else ! You guys served us in 40 mins gap one starter where we ordered three , so 120 mins to eat three starters ! We said pack us the main course you served it after 120mins . Wow guys !!! I even saw few other ppl freaking out when will we get our order ! I think you guys need to fix this issue cause I happen to like the place .

On entering opium i got an american styled cafe feel. It reminded me of HIMYM. So, thumbs up for the ambience. Coming to the food part. We had ordered tandori roti,crispy chicken and Reshmi Chicken. Everything was so good that i couldn't stop licking my fingers. And the best part is it didn't punch a hole in my wallet. Well,this place is always too crowded so don't raise your eyebrows if you don't get a place to sit. Last but not the least thumbs up for the staff members.

Welcome to opium, 'the' most popular bar of sector 5, offering delectable array of food, extensive range of drinks & a lively ambiance.

Highly recommended for after office hangouts  along with pink floyd or nirvana playing on the backdrop!!

Visited Opium for lunch with my office friends after receiving our 1st stipend at our then office. When we reached, the place was empty except for the four of us. We straightaway ordered for a full plate of Tandoori Chicken, a Mutton Patiala, a Chicken Bharta, Butter Naans, and beers for the guys.

The Tandoori Chicken was decent enough. The Mutton Patiala seemed innovative & was okayish for a first try. The Chicken Bharta was nothing hi-fi. The naans were okay.

The guys seemed to enjoy the ambience & they really enjoyed the music with their beers. But the place did not create a good enough impression for me, the main reason being small cockroaches running around all over the place. This, coupled with the fact that the food was average, has made me not too keen to set my foot at this place again for a long time.

Opium in sector V is a nice place to hang out with friends - nice ambience - good food üç¥ u will like it üòä - I went to opium last week for the 1st time with my colleagues - we were enjoying our time - we ordered breezers whishky beer omlete paneer pakoda cashew nut etc in main course we had dal tadka paneer bhurji and one chetinad subzi which was awesome along with rice and naan . One suggestion to the management of the place is that please keep an eye on those who come and after drinking too much makes scene at the place - three guys just made the place miserable - at first the waiters were taking it easy but after sometime rain of slang languages and even fight started - its very important to have good guards at such place to make sure good customers keeps on coming again and again

D price of drinks n snacks is not at all pocket pinching. Every1 who likes to hang out wid friends in a perfect place... Dis is d place... Hats off to d service n hospitality dey provide..

Perfect place to hang around with your gang over a couple of drinks and mouth watering dishes.

As most of the reviews testifies...this place s ideal for you if you want to enjoy time wd bunch of friends, good food, good booze and lots of time! We went in a group of 6 and stayed there from 1:30pm to 7pm...some crazy odd 5:30hrs with excellent food and reasonably prized drinks! The service is quite neat and fast. In food, i specially mention about fish cheese sticks, mutton liver masala and tandoori chillichicken! With these in the platter, panfried chicken tasted very bland. Same happened for chicken patiala, its an awesome dish with minced chicken well cooked in rich spices and the entire thing wrapped in an egg cover like a roll. But the taste s milder than the spicy tandoori chilli chicken...so try to order patiala before u order any f the spicy dishes. Overall, it was really a very good experience!

From where to start... ir was my second visit and very very disappointing one. To start with, it was so unhygienic. Ladies washroom was a complete mess. If its a food joint, the first thing which needs to be ensured is the hygiene, specially washrooms should be at least clean. But unfortunately it was just a horrible sight. 
Then comes service, waiters don't have manners to talk. As if they're supposedly giving us free food. Very congested not enough space. 
If it comes to food just fine, edible nothing extra ordinary. They serve actually nothing with the drinks. 
Its very unfortunate to be in such a place where you charge 15% service charge but it can't give you basic cleanliness. I am never going back there.

What a way to celebrate international beer day!! A quick visit to opium bar came as a surprise.. The popularity of the bar was seen from outside, as we have to wait 15 minutes before our turn came in.. I guess it would be the most happening place at sector 5. The bar menu gave a surprise as the menu and price which was uploaded on zomato didnt match with the one in our hand.. I request you guys to kindly update the current bar menu.. But apart from that, everything was perfect.. From beer to vodka to hakka noodles to chicken kebabs!! The service was quick despite being jampacked! Mazel tov!! üëçüèº

Nice place , with mixed interiors : located conveniently in sector 5 near Rdb Boulevard or better known as big cinemas, with ample parking space nearby( Paid off course), and maybe a seating capacity of around 70-80 people,, or may be more....
I am a regular and i feel like the waiters and other staffs  are very friendly, and we even joke around a lil bit...music is great,,rock and sometimes electronic,,( but gets repetitive,after u pay this place couple of visits )
Food is great, and we make sure we end up eating once we are there. Booze is priced right in the middle... Not too expensive( at the starting of the month when ur pockets are deep) ,, and not to low ( at the end of month , when theres a burning hole in ur pockets) .... 
I totally recommend this place if u wanna hang out with friends over a couple of drinks and have a great time...
P.s.- please make sure u reach early on weekends,, otherwise ur legs are gonna be in lot of pain ,,, due to waiting for a table... Lol

Opium - The name says it all. In one word, the best bar cum restaurant for Salt Lake Sector 5 area. I have been visiting this place since the last year of my college and since then there was not even a single time that this place didn't meet the expectation. Let me describe the place pointwise -¬†
1. Ambience - Awesome!! 5 out of 5
2.Food - 4.5 out of 5 - Try oriental omlette, Sina kati kabab, mutton lever masala (say Keema Chochchori), mexican fish -  these are the speciality of this restaurant. however, you can blindly order for any item and you won't regret ¬†- TAKE THAT!!
3.Drinks - apart from the regular alcohol brands, they also provide the rare ones in Vodka like "Grey goose", "Skyy" ; in Scotch like "JW Blue label", "Glen***" series etc. They also have a vast range of cocktails and mocktails
4. Service - 4.5 out of 5 - Excellent, definitely the people work over there are so friendly that if you are high enough, they would stop serving you for your sake and arrange for your homecoming
5. Huge rush on friday - make sure you drop in there by latest 6:00 pm else seek for other bars around
6. Music on demand - Not sure for others, but as I used to be a very frequent visitor over there, I had built a very good camaraderie with them. So after 9:00 pm or when the place is not that crowded, you can listen to your favourite AC/DC number and bang your head along with your friends as well.
7. Vat / Service tax is very high - Take a note on that, if your cost is 800 rupees, and you give a 1000 rupee note - be sure that you won't get any return after giving a nominal amount of tip.
8. They used to serve Hukkah also, not sure if they still onto that.
.

What else?? Go ahead...booze...enjoy the ambianc....Pure bliss!!

If u lov cocktail,  go n try the Long Island iced tea.. Just rocking..

A regular visitor when I used to work at Sector 5.
This place is good for quick drinking plans at affordable rates, finger-licking chicken cheese sticks, dry chili chicken along with your choice of drinks.

Ps: tried my first absinthe at this place. Perhaps,  one of the very few places in Kolkata which serves absinthe.

A very popular bar cum restaurant in the heart of salt lake, opium is practically the 1st choice for hanging out and boozing among the whole IT crowd and more. 
Ambiance - Amazing. Very chilled out, very aptly lit, cozy seating arrangements and nice wall murals make it a good place to hangout. 
Food - We decided on some drinks and had mostly finger foods along with it.
Chicken Pakora - Boneless chicken pieces in a crispy batter coating. Fared descently. 
Cheese Chilli Mushrooms - Okayish. A bit bland and dry on the outside. The filling of gouda and mushroom is tasty though. 
Chicken 65 - I would say it's a modified version of dry chilli chicken with large amounts of garlic and tasted well but it's no where near a 65. 
Service - Considering it was crowded, still delivery time of approximately 25 mins for every item including the bill is too long. The waiters are courteous and polite though. 
Overall.. Good place to hangout with friends, have booze at reasonable prices, but honestly wasn't quite impressed with the food quality after my 1st visit.

Been here umpteen number of times. Last Friday we were there again for a farewell of one of my colleague. Two signature starters that we loved were the Crispy Chilli Baby Corn and Oriental Omlette. Additionally since some hard drinks were on board, we had ordered Cheese Cherry and Pineapple. Thank God it was served in a bowl submerged in ice cubes wich was just what we wanted. It was a fabulous experience.

Hard to find a seat if you are visiting there after 6.30 in the eve,unless booked. The food here is also mouth watering with crispy chilli baby corn and pepper chicken at its very best.

Again a place, where I've been coming for ages, yet took so long to write a review for them. Everything done just right and perfect. Location is a big plus. Best place to go for a drink with your office buddies, if you work near sector 5. The ambience is perfect for a bar. Dimly lit, round tables all around. Great place for catching a game too, they have a lot of rooms inside, a lot of seating space and almost all angles cover a television. Very pocket friendly liquor prices, on top of that they have some offer or the other all the time. I've never had any main course here, but I've had almost all the starters on their menu. Every dish is delightfully different and awesome. It is just the best. My favourites - Mexican Fish and Lemon fried Chicken. The only thing is its difficult to get a place here from Friday - Sunday evening, there's a long waiting time.

Excellent ambience.. great food.. and obviously, there's alcohol - that's opium in a nutshell for you. Didn't expect the food to be of top notch quality in a bar but it beats many a restaurant easily with its good quality. Special mention - the chicken patiala. This one just takes the cake. The ambience is excellent to say the least. And yes, the alcohol is.. well, as alcohol should be. This bar is highly recommended for anyone in sector 5 looking to have some quality food over beer. Only con for smokers - no smoking, unlike the plethora of bars in salt lake. That aside, a lovely experience.

Although the first time I was there a lot have changed ever since. Staffs are well trained and have good courtesy to your service and well mannered. Its almost impossible after evening to get a seat there every weekend so.if.you are travelling that might be a disappointment. Nevertheless this place undoubtedly is the life line of sec v and we love it the way it is

I can't stop criticizing this restaurant and its services.DOWNSIDES:1. Half the tables are smaller than stools.2. Food tastes very mediocre, especially for the price they charge.3. The food is served in low grade steel utensils. Your mother has better steel utensils at home.4. Heavily crowded5. The promptness of waiters is also questionable. They are ill-equipped to serve such a huge onslaught of crowd.UPSIDE:1. The only good thing about this joint is that they play good Rock music. Unfortunately, the clumsy crowd makes it impossible to enjoy.

Being the oldest bar in sector V,it posses the nostalgia of IT office goers. A walk through the lane beside Infinity Building will lead you to this. Ambience is little bit noisy with lot of people and not so large space. Food is nice,liquor varieties are sufficient. Good place for after office hangouts so  call for reservation might be helpful. We ordered butter nan,kadai chicken, mutton keema with Bacardi rum and two bottles of beer. Crispi baby corn and chilli mushroom as starters. All of them was up to the mark and made us happy. :)

Location: At sector V, towards the end of the alley beside infinity building.

Ambiance: A vintage feeling, with nice decor. Good music. A bit loud environment. Perfect ambiance for chilling out with friends. 4/5

Service: Awful, to say the least. 1st, they were not giving us a proper table. They offered us the waiting area as our table(!!!). Then, they gave us a bottle of water, but no GLASS!!!! We ordered two starters, but they literally forgot what we ordered for. Several times, we had to call them and finally, we got our order after 40 minutes. 0/5

Food: We ordered sweet lime soda and starters: Silver chicken and bekti zezero.
Silver chicken was filled with cheese and It tasted delicious. But betki zezero was just out of the world. Sinfully tasty, utterly butterly delicious, served with butter tossed carrot and beans and french fries. 4.5/5

Overall, food was heavenly. I'd only consider opium for a next visit, solely based on the food quality.

Sometimes we cannot judge a restaurant only by the quality of food it serves and thus Opium is all about ambiance. Lovely place to be with friends and enjoy your drink. Starters are okay especially the crispy chicken was really good but the fish was a bit stale . Then the main course is like what every other restaurants in kolkata serve none of which deserves special mentioning. But I had a great time there because I was in the company of my friends and I was thirsty.

You do find the decor to be good and the ambience to be okay. The staff are really co-operative. However, I would recommend you to visit this place with buffer time as it takes long enough in the queue to book a table.

I love the atmosphere in this place.. a perfect bar cum restaurant ambience with absolutely apt music playing in the background.. coming to food.. we ordered murgh kalmi kebab which is awesome and goes perfectly well with the drinks.. for main course we had butter naan and chicken chetinad.. very spicy and delicious!
The waiters were very prompt in serving the drinks but very slow in serving the foods!! I noticed this strange thing every time I went there.. and the pocket pinch is very reasonable I must say..
so if you want to have a great boozing-n-eating time along with great music and live screening of matches without worrying much about the pocket; then this place won't disappoint you at all.

Best hangout place in Sector 5.

Opium is a famous bar cum resturant located near RDB. Space is less but ambience is great. They provide 10% corporate discount on booze to IT sector employees, so this place always remains packed mainly with office goers. Even during weekdays there is long waiting at peak hours. Waiters are friendly.

They have good collection of booze, although price is on higher side. Then again this is an ideal place to have beer and hangout with friends. A pint of calsberg costs rs 120. Food menu has large variety. Starters like crispy chicken, black paper chicken, chicken kalmi kebab, chicken lolipop are very tasty. I have mainly eaten starters along with booze here so cant really comment on the main course. However i once had dal makhni which is good. Tandoori roti and nun need improvement. Food price is also on higher side. The major drawback of this place is the huge delay between order and food serving. Even on less crowded days food takes almost 30 mins to reach your plate. Thumbs down for that. Otherwise this place is really cool.

Opium is defin tely the most popular watering hole in Sector-5 and adjacent area mainly patronised consistently by the techies in the neighbourhood..This has been our go to place in the last few years as it offers a perfect combo of booze and food together clubbed with a decent environment..
The major reason behind its overwhelming popularity is definitely its convenient location(close to RDB), delectable array of food, economical alcohol and the lively ambiance it offers..In a nutshell it offers a perfect balance between a good pub and a good restaurant..The alcohol here is not the cheapest in Sector-5(Go Where is more cheaper) but it has a extensive stock and it offers some tasty lip smacking food to accompany your booze..The interior is quite cool and updated,beautiful posters and comfy couches,tv for live screening,only issue is the usual long waiting queue outside which at times get irritating..The staffs here is decent I would say, gets better when you are a regular,even they serve us hot water if needed with drinks..
Coming to the food definitely its biggest strength..Some of the Recommended dishes are Fish Cheese Stick, Chicken Kalmi Kebab, Fish Irani, Fish Leaver Gin, Oriental Omlette and Chicken Patiyala..Most of the times we don't delve into main course since we get full with drinks and starters..Still the Indian Manin course were better than the Chinese dishes..Kulcha, Dal Makhani, Chicken Tikka Masala or Fried Mutton taste good too..Overall a must for tipplers and for techies do check for the special discounts and offers..

This is one of those places in my city which brings a smile on my face. A personal favourite when i am in a mood for drinks with my friends. The best thing about this place according to me is the music. Nirvana, Floyd and other similar soundtracks are a much needed break from the stereotypic Honey Singh that plays in other pubs. Eveb the posters on the wall are something that i am so fond of. The seating arrangement is a bit clumsy though in the main portion as the tables are placed very close to each other. The price of drinks are relatively on the lower side. Food is one big advantage. They offer very tasty dishes of superior quality. Don't miss out on Mutton Patiala and Bekti Zezoro for sure. These are the two items that they are skilled at preparing.

Heard about this place many a times but atlast visited this place and I must say all that what I heard and made a impression within myself didn't gone into vain. After a long hassle in front of the entry the guard let us in, a cozy haute place where most of the IT people of sector V hangout over some booze and the delicacies severed in house. 
We ordered the famous oriental omlet, cheese fish sticks and chicken tandoori with the first round of booze followed by patiala chicken and yes both the taste and presentation of the dishes were awesome. 
The in house music just adds up to the ambience of this place but can dig a steep hole on your pocket with a so so service. 
All n all a good place to be at when you're with your friends.

I've had heard a lot of my friends working in Sector V raving about this place. So when we were looking for a place to get together with old friends and drink, we decided on this.

First of all the interior is exceptional. They have the wooden feel with dim lights and lots of posters and looks very much like an American pub. And they have installed benches outside for smoking and for those waiting for seats. Its very considerate and makes for a wonderful experience.

Secondly let's talk about the food. We ordered Cheese omelette, mutton Patiala, chicken Patiala and chicken liver fry. The omelette was good with cheese and mushroom filling. I'm not a fan of spicy food so wasn't impressed with Mutton Patiala or the Chicken Patiala. The chicken liver fry though was exceptional.

The service was good. They served in short time and were courteous enough. The drinks and the food were reasonably priced and weren't too harsh on the pocket.

This is an excellent place to hangout and have drinks on a budget.

Have been thinking of writing a review for this place for quite some time now.Its my personal favourite pub for relaxing weekend outing with friends. old rock and metal ambience is really cool, but mostly heart itfor the really good finger food.drinks are reasonably priced as compared to most lounge bars in the city. Olypub could give it a tough competition but for the food! Mutton/Chicken patiala is a mouth watering side dish if your planning to down a few pegs.spicy chicken, crispy chicken, , chicken pepper salt also compliment the need same.main course, if at all you visit the place for that is decent if not mouth watering. I would suggest other better restaurants if only dinner is what you wish.bhetki zezero is a bit costly item but an item truly! Service is really good and so is the crowd. overall a great place to hang out.

Before watching Tanu Weds Manu Returns at RDB Salt Lake noon show, we decided to have some good lunch nearby and hence visited Opium Bar n Rest. On entering we got a sweet smell in the air which was definitely mixture of whiskey nd vodka! Understood that visitors mostly have drinks here. So was not sure how good the good would be. We had ordered Tandoori chicken and 60ml AB first. But Tandoori chicken tasted really good! Then we had butter nun nd murgh tikka masala, whose taste was just awesome.. Serving was good.. Well behaved staff.. Price of dishes was medium considering food quality.. Only delivery of food took some time.. Otherwise itz a very good bar cum restaurant :-) Must visit!!!

In short, it's a bar that serves really great food! If you are working in sector five or have some friends working there, this is the name you just can't miss. The opium has a typical English pub like environment ( personal opinion). Some of the most famous dishes are the oriental omelette, mutton Patiala, vetki jazzero ( pardon my spelling), mutton liver masala, chicken cashew nuts. Mutton Patiala is an exception among the typical high oil and spice dishes. It was little boneless pieces of mutton, nicely cooked and wrapped in an egg roll. The oriental omelette is a stuffed omelette, nice to taste. Chicken cashew nuts is a dry chicken dish with a good amount of chicken and cashew. Overall a nice place to visit again for sure.

One of the favourite bar in Sector 5, Salt Lake, Kolkata. Crowd is good and matured. We have ordered beer and chilly chicken. Food quality is average. The interior is awesome. The funniest thing is people get in to the bar with there i card(but the there is no swiping machine to capture). Overall a good experience.

Already much has been said about this amazing place. I've only been a short while in Kolkata, but my frequency here has been pretty high. In a very short time, this has become a favorite, and it has been the setting for everlasting memories with friends. This place has such a charm about it.
No praises needed. There's no way you can not like this place.

AND.. Chicken Patiala !

A great place to chill out with friends and unwind after a long day's work. There are 2 portions in opium. The outside larger portion looks hip and has a certain charm about it; though it can get very crowded. The 2nd portion is quieter where you can sit with your mates and chug down your choice of poison while watching a football match. Coming to the drinks, there are a pletheora of options. From your standard beers and whiskies to the rare single malts and even absinthe for the adventurous. The food is pretty decent too. Mention should be made of the patiala chicken which is divine and 7 on 10 ppl can be seen eating that at any point of time. And it doesnt pinch the pocket too hard either. Overall a good resto-pub to relax with friends when you feel a little financially wanting. :)

Very sorry to say that opium, what earlier used to be is no more now. A drastic downfall in both service and food was there yesterday. Was there for almost 2 hours but cant tolerate such mismanagement and went out to spend the evening elsewhere. Staffs with so casual attitude will left Opium no where in the competition in recent future. Guest waiting for there order to be served but the staffs were busy watching IPL match ( both kitchen and service team ) I thing the manager has also got a hunky dory place to hang around.

I do not want to remember that night for long, so I am writing this quickly. I went there with some of my friends at Wednesday night. We have ordered fish finger, chicken finger and some drinks for ourselves. We havve waited for almost an hour before the food arrived. That too, they were saying that we do not have fish so we should take two plates of chicken finger. The quality of food was not among the 'decent' too. After another hour, they told us that they got the fish. I don't know what they were up-to but it was a waste of money and time for us.

Opium is already legendary in Salt Lake and is frequented by students and people working in Sector 5, Salt Lake. The service is good and swift and the food tastes awesome (Mutton Liver Masala and Chicken Patiala are worth a try). The restaurant plays good music all the time,complementing the ambiance. Give it a try and you'll want to come back.

Opium is a basically a bar. But what makes it different from others is its amazing food quality. The interior and the lighting is just average like any other small bar. But what is good about this place is its different kind of foods. If you are visiting this place you must try, -¬†
chicken/mutton patiyala,¬†
Muttot liver fry,¬†
orient al omelette,¬†
chicken/ fish cheese stick,¬†
fist irani,¬†
dry chilli chicken.¬†

recently they have introduced a new dish dragon chicken but it is not up to the mark (at least not in my taste ).¬†

the price of the foods/drinks are average and its absolutely value for money.

Over all this place is really good for hanging out with friends but not that great if you are hanging with your special one. And one more thing, please try to avoid the cocktails. cause those are not that good.

Just been there for a drink and some chicken. The ambience is relaxing. More of a rock culture imbibed in the bar. The place surrounded by photos of rockstars. The bar counter right at the center. Dim lights. The food here has always been my lookout. I asked for a Malibu..and it came in the perfect glass with crushed ice. Nothing better and the taste as always heavenly to my buds. I tried the chicken lollipop which was quite good as compared to any other place where the coating amounts to a huge share of the dish. Enjoyed 8 lollipops in a plate. I love the Zezeros and the patialas here. All in all, Opium u keep me coming back for more.

Dingy lighting, bad interiors but cheap liquor and good food. Opium the place to be when you want to drink and dine but not spend a handful. The tandoor items are good (how bad can you grill?), and they serve till 11.00 pm. So if you are employee in any of the numerous offices in sector 5, this well is the ultimate chill out place. Pocket friendly and satisfying.

90% of the ppl working in sector 5 have visited this place. and on fridays u actually have to stand in a queue to get a place to sit. The rates are actually not quite of a pocket pinch. I typically like their masala papad preparation, omlette, and a cheese and cherry dip (dont remember the name). The only problem of this place is the wait time is a bit too long. apart from that, food wise they make really tasty stuff.

Excellent place for weekend hangout. Not a food heaven. But at the same time I would not say the food is bad. Acceptable quality of food, good taste, mostly spicy, value-for-money price range including alcohol make it an extremely popular place in the locality. Been here several times in big groups and every time found the same consistent standard maintained. Typical Indian Chinese and North Indian dishes make their menu. Signature dish can be considered as Patiala. Extremely rich and difficult to digest but strikingly tasty.

Been here after suggestions from many people.
Its a Bar and not a proper restaurant.Outside the place in the waiting area its infested with thousands of mosquitos.You can have a vector borne disease if you are in a long queue.
Its chaotic inside. With so many televisions around.Pretty noisy. 
Inside there is a  ?family sitting area which is claustrophobic like anything.And there are AC vents pointed directly towards you. After first 5 minutes i thought it will snow anytime.On repeated requesting also, the temperature was not adjusted.
We were 6 people freezing at the end of the room with a very small table and the smallest sitting area i have seen.Could not even keep the legs relaxed as i was brushing against the opposite person then
Back to the food. We ordered many items as starters. Including beers and whiskeys.
Food were a little less in amount .
The items were- Tandoori chicken,Mutton liver masala,chicken badami kabab,crispy chicken,Bhetki zezero,Fish cheese stick,Fish irani.. Among these.... the zezero and fish cheese sticks were exquisite.Absolutely marvellous.The food was fresh overall.
Teamed up pretty well with the drinks. 
Cocktails were also good.
But many items were not available due to supply issues i guess.
In the mains, we had Noodles , Butter nan , Chicken butter masala.
Now the food portions were good. Chicken was soft and well done. Noodles were also palatable.
We finished up a little late though.
Service was a little slow. Probably due to the fact that the place was full.
The place is not at all a family place.
Ambience - 3/10
                    A little Claustrophobic
Food Quality -9/10
          Quantity-7/10
Food was fresh

Location- Close to RDB 
Recommended for bachelors and groups.Not a family place.

Oriental Omelette and Mutton Patiala or Chicken Patiala r two must starters to be tasted at the first visit. A host of starters are available and main course dishes were very tasty too. I would have given a excellent rating if they had Car Parking, price is very cheap compared to taste and quality and location.

Opium is one of the olddest hangouts at Sector V. I have viaited it many times but not in recent times. One needs to walk straight past RDB coming from the Infinity side and will find Opium on the right. The place is good with a lighting arrangements suiting bits name. It's organized well and the place offers both drinks and food at a reasonable price. The service is smooth and I would suggest to try the Kabuli Naan for sure. 

Food quality is good and one won't be diassapointed. I look forward to visit again sometime soon.

This has become my go to restaurant when we decide to booze as well as have some good foods without spending lot of money. The restaurant has a very classy ambiance and atmosphere to hangout. Food quality is also very good price being reasonable. I have tried many of their dishes specially the starters. My favourite among them are mutton Patiala, cheese balls, oriental omlette,bhetki zezero,crispy baby corn,chilli tandoori chicken, Mexican fish. From there main course I would prefer their Indian items. The butter masala dishes tastes great. I think they excel some of their dishes which have cheese in them. Chicken senakati,fish cheese stick,silver chicken are also great. Every starters in the menu tasted great and some are out of the world which I mentioned as my favourites. I think one day I would end up trying every starters on their menu the way I like them.

Absolutely love the place. The ambience and the quality of food and service is amazing. For me its the perfect hangout place for a group of friends, with some soothing rock music, a screen for football, variety of drinks in their menu and their lip-smacking appetizers. Its the place where you can go, have you favourite single malts/irish- whisky(my fav) and still wont judge the bill coz the prices are very tight, and voila, inclusive of taxes. Just make sure you go as early as 7 pm in the evening during the weekends as the waitlist usually takes up around 30-45 mins.¬†Highly recommended!

Shakespeare said what's in a name. Lekin yeh opium naam mei hai kuch alag sa naasha hai. :D

By the way foods were delicious. Had beers , white rum and vodka. Ambience was too good. But they actually have weird sense of music. :P ;)

Have been a long timer in Opium! Who has not been a long timer here, men may come and men may go, but Opium goes on for ever! For every mood they have provided me space! Its rather going back to home!
As all say mutton patiala is just out of the world here, I would say about something they don't say about much. It is its Chinese dishes! Loved them all! Also would suggest for chilly chicken tandoor! A fusion of chicken tandoor and chilly chicken!

Great place if you want to hang out with your friends and have a few drinks. The chicken drumsticks felt a bit dry, but the garlic chicken was delicious. Had a few beers, ate some awesome food and the price was also very reasonable. I am visiting this joint again.

How many times you go there for a friends gathering it never disappoints.I have visited this joint innumerable times for the last 7/8 years but still it's the no.1 choice for an after office get together. 
Located in the heart of sector -5 ; this is a place for the old buddies to chat and have a sip and also get lip smacking dishes like Fried Mutton, Fish livergin , chicken cheese stick, lemon fried fish , chicken patiala to name a few . 
The service is good considering the amount of rush it has to deal with. 
Opium u rock !!!

Absolutely perfect ambience. Wonderful starter food and wide range of drinks. Very good music and wonderful wall-paintings which will attract you. Light intensity is just perfect. Absolutely value for money. The only thing which I did not like is, it's always too crowded. So you have to wait too long, especially on weekends :)

The best pocket friendly place to have a drink in sector V , Saltlake. Been here multiple times and each time it amuses me the same. Food is good and they serve very fast. Only problem is after evening its hard to get a place. The waiters are really helpful. Recently they added Jaggerbomb to their bar menu after we showed the bar man how to prepare the drink with Jagger Meister and Red Bull.

I have been to this place a couple of times. Every time I have visited, always been reminded the words, "the night is too young!!". Never ever I have seen this place cool down, even a bit. Welcomed by long queues after the office hours on Friday eve n way past 10 o clock, this place literally bounce with energy!!
Perfect place to release the steam after a week of work with alcohol n some finger licking foods. The oriental omelette, a dish with molten cheese n chicken pieces wrapped by an omelette starts n steals the show. The cheese chicken fingers, molten cheese inside warm chicken fingers are perfect to go with the pegs. Lastly but not the least, the mutton patiala, spicy mutton cooked n served wrapped by an omelette is The show stopper.
I recommend this place to every ppl who wanna get drunk n eat some yummy food, bitch abt your work life with the colleagues or even discuss ur childhood memories with your friends or even look at gorgeous women coming here.
Dont bring your family here...definitely not a suitable place.
PS without alcohol 800bux for 2ppl.

Opium has  always been my favourite hangout & remains so for its Consistency & price points which is very pocket friendly. 
Must mention had some foreign delegates  and they loved the feel of OPM ... thats how we call it !!!
It gives true feel of a pub &  their Cheese Chilli Mushroom & Fish Zazero & not to miss Oriental Omelette were too good !!!! Haven't been to too many  outlets in Salt lake as Opium remains my All time favourite!!!!!

Opium was a place dear to my heart... The amazing ambience... The music... And the service... And the food... Were all my favorite... 'were'... Somehow I didn't find my old Opium when I went there a few days back... Something was missing... Specially the service... The people sounded not good... And got weirdly slow... And the food didn't taste as good as back then... Anyways... I'd still say Opium is place you can visit over and over again... And the walls echoes of thousand happy reunions...

Although this bar is located at the heart of salt lake, sector 5, yet it does not have any special attraction. ¬†This place is noisy.¬†
However does not deserve a spacial recommendation as too many similar or better options available near by.¬†
The best cocktails are Margarita, Sex on the Beach, Martini and White Russian. Mocktail lovers can try their Blue Lagoon or Opium Colada. For food, there are preparations like Crispy Chilli Baby Corn, Makhmali Kebab which tastes awesome! :P

The ambience was heavenly. We entered this joint at around 7 in the evening and the it was filled up with people. Pink Floyd beaming from the speakers accompanied with a premier league match. While we went on drinking beer. This place is worth trying. Down side is the quantity of the food is not sufficient. The best part was that we asked the waiters to play a song of our choice. Wish this place was meant for smoking up.

OK, now, guys if you've been to Opium, you know what I'm talking about when I say that it's the Holy Land for college students and occasional drinkers alike... 

I'd go on to say that if you drink, and you haven't been there, you're wasting time, mate... 

Pocket-Friendly: Check(It's not too friendly, though, just not unfriendly, is all) Service: Check, Ambiance: Super-Duper Check(It's rustic, but charming).... 

Final Verdict: If you like the idea of catching up with old buddies from school or college for a drink on a random Friday night, on some of the best alchohol-accompanying music playing in the background, Opium is the place you wanna be... 

P. S. The food there's good, too... I had a Chicken Tikka with a pint of beer once, and it was great even by no-alcohol-restaurant standards...

Makes me wonder why it has taken so much time for me to write a review for this place! Nevertheless, I'll do it now... 

One of my favorite joints in the city, it's reasonable and good. It is located in the heart of the IT hub of the city, Sector 5. Considering it's location, you'll find lot of IT crowd there be it a week day or weekend. There's a separate smoking zone which is outside the restobar. I have tried a lot of things because I have been going there for a few years now. My favorite is beer and fish zezzero. The latter is a batter fried preparation topped with a whiff of butter, makes it yum like anything!

Visited this joint on Christmas day at noon. Surprisingly when we entered the place was pretty vacant.. The ambiance is decent. Since we were very hungry We directly opted for 
Vodka 
Bhetki zero
Chicken kadhai 
Egg tasks
Masala kulcha 

All the items were lip smacking. The only problem was their service which was a bit slow it took around 30 mins for our order to reach us. Quantity did seem less initially but the quality was good and the items were suffice for us. 
Other than that had an awesome experience even price wise the places is reasonable.. A great place to catch up with ur friends..

Ambience is perfect for rocking. I loved all the musical band's posters. Great food. The fish menu called Bhetki Zezzore is awesome. Every one should try it. The tandoori chilli  chicken is daaamn too hot & spicy. Loved it. The tenderness of Chicken in Chicken tikka masala was juzzZ perfecto. But an advice for room odour. Please change. itz very bad. I drink but didn't liked the room odour. It was neither smelling alcoholized nor any food odour.

Nice and vibrant place in Kolkata. I did not expect it to be so good - this is comparable to a good pub in Mumbai, dull lightings and loud music reminded me of Totos in Bandra. We just spent an hour in the evening having couple of beers together - music was good, service was fast and perfact, food was ok (we tried chicken tikka) - what else to comment. Happy experience overall.

If you wanna skip both Go Where and Shimmers because former isn't classy enough and latter digs a hole in your pocket, you should go for Opium. It is the perfect balance of good food, good ambience and good price. Their Crispy Mushrooms and Mutton Patiala are must haves. They provide a good variety of drinks and provide a discount on them for employees of certain IT companies. I rate it 4/5.

Ambience: Nice and cosy place with soothing lighting, tasteful d√©cor and popular music played in the background. They can however improve on what is shown on the small LCDs... One single advertisement played in a never-ending loop can be really frustrating for a person who is sitting exactly opposite to it. I rate it 3.5/5.

Service: During peak hours, they are pretty slow. It's pretty difficult to catch the waiters as they are always running. But the staff is well-behaved. I rate it 3.5/5.

Price: Little higher than many cheap bars but totally worth it.

Overall I give it 4/5.

It was a very nice experience we had at this place. The location was good for me as I had a plan to watch a movie in RDB. 
First we visited before the movie starts, for a quick drink n snacks. We ordered one Vetki Zezero and a chicken tandoori. They first served the tandoori. It was very well cooked. I liked it very much. Then comes the Vetki Zezero. Two piece of fish fried with a very thin coating accompanied with French Fry & vegetables like carrot, peas, bins boiled and light fried. The fish is so tender and rich in flavours. Leaves a light sour taste. Those vegetables perfectly compliments the taste of fish. All together its an blast of good taste. 

Again we visited the same place on the same day after watching a movie. Now we ordered Mutton Patiala, Sweet n Sour soup and again Vetki Zezero. Soup was ok types. Mutton patiala was another superb dish. Small boneless pieces of mutton wrapped in omelet and sauce. Amazing feeling....

Only one suggestion, the bhujia they serve with drinks should have been better.

After hearing from one of my friend who is a regular customer of this place, Me and my partner decided to come to this pub. Located just beside the RDB cinemas, opposite of Infinity benchmark. This is probably one of the best bur cum restaurant in the town. Ambience was perfect for all sorts of moods. The service and the quality of food is good. We ordered chicken tandoori, chicken bharta, plain nan, and Beer. All the items were delicious and the chicken was well cooked in the chicken tandoori. Chicken bharta was awesome and mouth watering. Nan was also very soft. The area is well spread and they have sitting arrangement for all sorts of people either couple or group of friends. The prices are also reasonable.

First things first, at this reasonable a price, the ambience is really good. Yes, there are seating arrangements for possibly every sized group, from couples to gangs, everyone will have their own space and privacy. 
The food they serve is also good, full tandoori chicken priced just above 200, is relatively a lot under budget for any kind of restaurants. 

Probably the most safest place to take girls along, you will surely have a great time with your friends over a couple of drinks. 

The location of this place let's you roam freely, without much nuisance of traffic, fire those who haven't yet been here, do make sure you come to this place, coz for the regulars, they already know how good a place this is.

Cons - 
The music. It needs to improve and they should undestand when to play what..Well it plays floyd and GNR classic stuffs but no playlist as such..That kinda is bore.!! 

Well the crowd..:P It is surrounded by IT companies and they comprise 90% of of the crowd or even more i guess.. A frustated lot i must say.. :D

Opium is one of the few places in Sector V , Kolkata ,you can call "Value for Money". Its a great place to hangout with your colleagues or your friends but please keep in mind to be early on Fridays or evenings.¬†

Lets come down to food.. they serve excellent kababs.. Their badami kabab is to die for. Also try crispy chicken/mushroom. Chicken/ Mutton Patiala are hot favourites too. My suggestion will be to go for the starters and snacks rather than main course.¬†

If you are looking for a cozy pocket friendly place to spend some time with drinks and good food, Opium is the place to be.

The best economical and popular pub in Sector V area. The ambiance is average... walls full of popular rock god posters like Foreigner band, Jimi Hendrix,etc. My personal favorite is Bhekti Zezero, Tangri Kebab, Mutton Liver Masala, Fish and Chips with your choice of drink. You can bring your corporate ID cards to avail the corporate discounts. But the biggest let down is the time consumed to serve starters/main dishes. Though I do not have main course over here, rather try to fill up my stomach with starters :P and BP. The best place to chill out with your colleagues/friends.

If you are working in any IT company out of Kolkata and you seek good food along with the mugs of chilled beer or on the rocks whiskey then Opium will be a regular visit for you.
Located amongst the midst of Sec-V , the IT hub of kolkata , this place serves a few most desired dishes within reasonable price that perfectly fit with your drinks. 
Bhekti zezero, mutton liver masala, chicken patiyala are the special ones. 
Environment is also okay. If you visit on a Friday evening be there before 6 else it would be really hard 2 get a place. 
A few TV screen with either some live game on mute mode or some old music show , walls full of hendrix-beatles-Morrison type poster but audio system is playing Bryan Adams on a repeat mode. All the frustration ( along with a few happy moments seldom ) of IT lives are put on the tables here and there - that's opium in a nutshell.

I had been to this place quite a number of times in past 7-8 years and to be very true I was never disappointed, the quality hasn't gone down a bit in all these years. This place can be termed as 'the most popular pub' of Saltlake area. With great food, ambiance, prompt service and choice of nice background music this place is sure to entice you. Here are few Pros and Cons which I had quickly noted down -

Pros:
a) Premium location in Saltlake Sector-5.
b) Great food, specially some amazing appetizers like Mutton Patiala, Oriental Chicken Omelette, Mexican Fish, etc.
c) Nice laid back environment with an apt interior decor and ambiance.¬†
d) You will feel all relaxed here in comfy couches with soft rock music, subtle lighting and LCD screens.
e) Service is fairly quick and the waiters are quite knowledgeable.
f) ¬†Several options in the menu for both food and drinks.
g) Corporate Discount for techies around Sector-5
h) Crowd is generally good here, may not be always super-safe for a lady at night, but this place is mostly occupied by techies and students most of the time.
i) The price is also quite reasonable and can be termed 'rightly priced'.
j) The music is also cool :)

Cons:
a) The place is always over crowded in the evening, might need to wait outside to get a seat.
b) The main course is not the best thing to have here. We had ordered for Chinese/Thai in the main course and found the mixed chowmein was good but nothing great, the Thai Red Chicken was very salty and we could not finish it in the end.
c) Hygiene of the place can still be improved, though it is not properly visible in the dull low light.

But overall a great place to chill out with your friends and colleagues after a hard day at work or for any celebration. Recommended! ¬†

Cheers!

I have been visiting Opium since last 7 years. Now I don't live there but still when I am business visit I make it a mandate to visit it.
Last Saturday, I have been there. But I was so disappointed very poor service, no water, no cutlery served with food. And new bunch of waiters who had joined now are not willing to listen us properly.

After this experience, I would certainly not go to Opium now. It is up to there management to see how to take care of their old veterans.

The drinks and the food served are great...... their tandoor section is absolutely delicious. If you are a fish lover, do try their Bhetki Zezero and Tandoori Fish......the staff is very friendly and they would always suggest you the best in their offerings. The only problem one needs to face is that there's a huge rush on weekends and holidays and you might have to wait a long time to enter.

Awesome ambience!!! Makes you feel the bongness with all those 60s-80s rock songs and pictures of music legends. The Chicken Patiala is the best out there with a good collection of drinks.

The best place for hangout in salt lake sec-5. Visiting this place since 2010, they never dissapoint me. Ambience is awesome.They really deliver some amazing food. Rates are reasonable comparing to the other places. If you are a corporate employee then there is discount for you also. You will definetly like the service.

A place for budget seekers and its targeted audience being school pupils, college students and entry level job seekers
If you are looking for proper ambience with good music for relaxation then this is not the place for you

A good ambience and corporate discount lures many loyal customers here . The goodwill of the authority charms me. Mutton Patiala is my fav dish here . 
One thing that should be fixed is their A.C . The uneven temparature may be uncomfortable depending where you seat.

Hands down, Opium is the best pub in Kolkata for me. Though its located in Sector 5 and can be a little difficult to get to if, you are travelling from south or central Kolkata it will be worth it. Best thing I like about it is the food they serve is delicious. I have rarely come across a pub where they serve such good food. My favorites there are Mutton Patiala, Bhetki Zezaro, Mexican Fish and Mutton Liver Masala. The Patiala is well cooked goatmeat wrapped in an omlette and garnished with boiled egg white and cheese. Zezaro is the tastiest fish around. fried fillets with the vegetables tossed in butter, simply amazing.
The second best thing I like is the ambiance and music. Alcohol prices are pretty decent compared to top bars in the city, and you can get a 10% Corporate discount if you are in IT. You don't get a cheap crowd there and will have a great time with your friends. No wonder its difficult to get a table if you are late.¬†
¬†I cant complain 5/5.

P.S.: Don't forget to try the misti pan outside if you go there.

When i entered this place i was like oh god spare me the horror!!! But as time passed and i started enjoying with my friends the experience turned out to be awesome. We went around 4. It was less crowded and the music was just about right. As evening arrived it became crowded with good people and the ambience was lovely. 
We ordered many drinks and other stuff from the food menu... and they were so amazing. The food here is really nice. A must try place for youngsters but provided you go after 6 pm or so... :-)

The secret of this joint is not the liquor but the food. There is a wide selection of liquor from cheap to vintage; but the most important part is the awesome food that accompanies it. Ask for something different than the traditional sides and you will be surprised.

I had heard about this place from my colleges and one day thought to visit the place.

Ambiance is good.Dimmed light and English popular songs will welcome you.

You can get drinks,food(Mughlai/Chinese) and that too very affordable price.They give discount for Corporate guys too.

We took Murgh senakathi,Chicken reshmi kebab as starters.Senakthi was not as expected but kebab was too good. In main course we took Opium Spl fried rice,Ginger chicken,Chilli garlic chicken.Spl fried rice was too good and to try it again.Side dishes were also as per expectation.

I didn't take any alcohol,so can't say on that.

Overall nice place,good service,good food and pocket friendly.

They accept Sodexo but you will not get corporate discount if you pay the bill by it.

This is a great place where you can drink and eat as much as you want without worrying about the bill. However it is not advisable for family outings as people mainly visit it for the bar.¬†
The food is really good. three of us went. the first two plates of starters were so good that we only ate starters for our lunch.
I specially liked the Mexican fish, crispy chicken and cheese chilly mushroom. Decor and ambiance is quite good. It gets full very easily so I would recommend prior booking if you plan to go on weekends. Overall, I loved it.

along with drinks and 6 plates of starters, the bill was around 2.7 k which is pretty cheap i think. i will definitely visit this place again.

Its the best omlette I ever had. Coupled with all kinds of liquour available. Huge area of sitting arrangements. Smart attendants. And lovely lounge feel. It still remains of the best hangout in Salt Lake specially in the IT zone. Kudos to Opium.

Drink is of reasonable price, and have a great range.
Food is awesome - crispy pepper chicken, orienral omlette, kebabs - fabulous.

Sit on the lounge to get very quick service, both on the drinks and the food. And you are quite familiar with the waiters and servers, ask them for Dragon Chicken, it's not in their menu, but it tastes fantabulous! ‚ò∫ There are other few items as well which they talk about only if you are a known face here.

Beware of Fridays, you might have to wait for an hour or two for a table.

Opium Has been THE hangout zone for us since college. For both emotional and economical reasons it has been our favorite place! Pub wise it isn't very muh hi fi but it's got all you need, all sorta drinks and chaknas and starters, and a FL  takeaway counter! And that too at a pretty affordable price, so no complaints please! Our group hot-cake is the crispy chicken. It's opium special and it's yum!!! Also try the Mexican fish, the tandoori chili chicken and the baby corn masala. These will win over your heart while u mull over the Smirnoff espresso or the Malibu Rum. Opium, we techno Indians faithfully love you.

Horrible hospitality and worst service ever in my life. The waiters don't have any etiquette to behave with women. Despite the ambiance factor I would not recommend this place. The management of the hotel think themselves to be Kings of Salt Lake- but my dear countrymen- you are absolutely wrong. You are there to serve us and not doing us a favor. I would never advice anyone to even venture close to this place simply because of the attitude of the management.

For most of the people in sector 5, opium is a pub, then a food spot. Well, for me, it became a food spot..and then a pub after I first tried mutton patiala. The ambiance is addictive, though the place is a bit clumsy. But that doesn't stop me from visiting this place. The top five dishes that I found are really worth the price:
1. mutton patiala
2. mexican fish
3. chicken senakati
4. fried mutton
5. oriental omellete

Will visit this place over and over again.

I like the music which they play specifically, which is why this place is one of my favourite spots. Coming down to food....really nice continental dishes. Oriental Omlette is my favourite one and along with Fish Cheese fingers. Although being in the heart of sector v the prices are not that high which is the second thing i like about this place. One thing which bothers me is most of the time their swipe machine doesnt work which pisses me off !!

One of the first , if not the oldest pub of the so called ‚ÄúElectronic City‚Äù of Kolkata. It has been around for a long time , since, Netguru used to boast a huge building ÔÅä

Oriental Omlette , Mutton Patiala , Fish Livergin , Cheese Balls are the house specials and I have not seen any reduction in quality for almost 6-7 years now.

Oriental omelette used to be a bit larger , but , the egg wrapped cheese and chicken still is a mouth-watering prospect. Patiala (Chicken or Mutton) are egg wrapped boneless gravy chicken and mutton. Goes without saying , this remains the ideal menu with hard drinks.

A definite 3.5 from me.

Opium is a great place to treat yourself to alcohol. Liquor prices are pocket-friendly and they do have a variety in stock. So, would suggest to go there only if you are drinker. Can't say much about the ambiance, a typical pub. The Murgh Senakati tastes great and goes well with hard liquor. Overall a decent place.

Located right into the heart of Sector 5, the place is a good hangout for corporate guys. We went there to celebrate our promotion. We were seated in the inner part of the restaurant and it seemed suffocating. The ambiance near the bar was good though. Drinks were good and we were also offered a 10% corporate discount. :)

The food was good. We ordered oriental omlet, fish cheese sticks, chicken patiala which was not that great, chicken Ballantine was impressive, traditional fish fingers. The taste was good however the kebabs seemed to be stale. The service was slow. We had to urge the waiter again and again to serve our order. However, overall a good experience. Will visit again for sure.

We ended up ordering Chicken Patiala, Mutton Patiala, Fish Livergin and fried chicken. The Chicken and Mutton Patialas were basically rich kheema stuffed and egg rolls. What I liked the most was the ambiance... perfect for after office chill out. Do pay a visit

So, this Bar cum Restaurant is situated in a convenient place in Salt Lake Sector V near the Infinity Benchmark which makes it a good place to visit. I came here with 3 of my friends when we were visiting the XOXO club and we ordered some booze along with some food. The inside of the restaurant was quite nice and fancy looking. After opening the door, you would first notice some comfy sofas where you could only drink and chill. Beside that was the bar. The bar held some good quality boozes as per your needs. The food was nice too and service was okay. The price was quite cheap to us and this place is a must visit for the people who live in Salt Lake.

We visited this place for a friend's bachelor party and started off with some cocktails. The Sex on the Beach was not that good, could only taste orange juice that too seemed bland and there was no cranberry in it. So we moved on to Scotch, pretty standard.

Now coming to the hors d'oeuvres, ordered oriental omelette(stuffed with chicken and mushroom tastes great), chicken patiala(chicken tikka kebab like pieces in a dry gravy rolled up in an omelette, my friends raved about it from previous encounters but i found it okay and not impressive), chicken Ballantine(now this dish was quite impressive, cut up in 8 pieces with tasty, juicy green stuffing rolled up by chicken), fish cheese sticks(traditional fish fingers with a gooey cheesy centre, good), chilli mutton(another impressive dish, boneless chunks of mutton in a dry gravy, first time I have ever tried it and loved it), mexican fish(fish fried in gram flour with a red masala stuffing attached to an onion ring, this dish left each of us dismayed even though we love beckty and the onion ring was poor) and finally the chicken sautee(boiled chicken and vegetables tossed in butter, personally I liked this dish though it was too simple but my friends didn't seem too interested in it).

Overall this place serves up some good dishes and the booze is cheap compared to others so definitely worth a try. Had an eye for some other names in the menu and will visit again for sure

Opium is located in one of the most young and happening places in Kolkata, Sector V, which is teeming with young professionals working in good companies, so it should definitely vie to attract more and more people. The ambiance seemed very confused to me when I went there in a group of five. While the tables are set in a way that makes it look like a family restaurant, it is very dark and noisy, which makes it feel like a bar. They should make sure that the restaurant looks like either of the two. Also, the TV and the music are loud at the same time, so you can't really appreciate the music even though that is all you hear, as everyone's voices are drowned out. That reminds me, they should improve their choice of music as well. The food was not too great either, with the Crispy Chicken and the Butter Naan being the only saving grace. The Chicken Reshmi Kabab was dry and tasted stale, the Chicken Butter Masala was too sweet, and had the Sweet Lime Soda not been just right, I would have left with a bad taste in my mouth, literally. Opium should definitely work very hard to improve the taste of its food and the customer experience.

The first hangout in sector V was planned here because of its privileged locational advantage. The place borderlines on being termed as small on crowded Fridays, but otherwise it is okay.

This is one place you will find full house almost all through the day with a lot of hustle bustle. The economically priced alcohol available here has made it a favourite place for office goers who throng the place after a hard days work. They have some interesting desi cocktails available for the ladies who prefer mocktails to alcohol. For others they have an array of liquor in their menu. There are offers running most of the day so your binge to drink increases even more ;) I love the mutton liver masala as chakhna here. My favourite is the Bhekti Zezero... its a fish item baked in cheese and its yummy. This is a speciality dish of the restaurant and should be tried.

The most popular hangout in Sector 5, quite truly lives up to its reputation. The interiors are cool and sassy. The service is prompt. The food is really tasty--specially the oriental omlete, fish irani, chilli babycorn and dry chilli chicken is an all time order for me. Specialities include -- mutton patiala, bhetki zezero, fish lever gin. You would be really satisfied with their taste, quality and quantity. For beverages ---- each its to own shall follow quite obviously, but for non-alchoholic visitors, their sweet lime soda with leave an impression and for cocktail lovers do try the indianised versions --- smirnoff masala maar ke and smirnoff kaipiroska. The price is too handsome so indeed something you can indulge in even once a week( may be every Friday!! )

Opium - one of the best places in the  entire city to  visit, if you are looking for a place to have a good drink with a few friends. Located right in the middle of Kolkata's IT Hub, this Bar cum Restaurant provides a perfect place to relax for a couple of hours after your hectic office schedule. The ambiance inside is one that is bound to compliment your mood to party. The lights, the western music (mostly rock), and the adequate number of TV screens makes the atmosphere within the bar very pleasant. Be it your weekend Football matches from Europe or a Cricket match, Opium ensures that you don't miss it for the sake of your drink. There are several seating areas within, this makes the place much less noisy compared to other bars, and also gives you a certain degree of privacy. The crowd at the bar is also pretty cultured and cool, mostly being the employees of the companies, and students of the colleges located in the area. If your are going there on weekends especially Friday and Saturday make sure you reach there before 7pm,  or get a prior booking, because getting a table otherwise would be subject to a long waiting period.
Now coming to the Drinks and Food - Opium offers a wide variety of drinks at a pretty reasonable rate I must say. And you do get corporate discounts on top of that. But the best thing about this place is its food, which is extremely delicious. Great variety of menu, both veg and non-veg. What I love here the most is the Mutton Patiyala. 
My recommendation: Visiting this place should be a must.

this joint is for long adda sessions over chilled beer and chicken lollypop starters without any hassles of time and worrying over a big pocket pinch..

the crowd is decent..and  so is the service

but alas our national problem of population  too surfaces here when long q's are seen ..mostly on fridays..
hope they open a place somewhere else keeping the menu and prices intact..

The place has been around for a long time but not everyone from other parts of Kolkata know about it. I myself didn't know about it. It is one of the best places in Sector V to hang out. The place looks good and has a great ambience. The music was good too but it could have been better. The place has pictures of rockstars and artists all over, which is cool. Going with the theme they should play rock music only. The food and drinks are reasonably priced and the service is not bad. The place has potential to do better. I only wish it was bigger than what it is. Overall it is a nice place to drink and spend a few hours.

A weekend seems a nice start to take a trip and a sip at this place. A well stocked bar and a 'will work out' menu will help you relax. Try out your poison with cheese chicken sticks, the dip provided is a good one. 
Note: try not to have absinth if you are having for the first time.

Again a team party, again a voting, again a
selection. This time everybody opted for a  known 'tried and tested' place - Opium. It's like returning to home ground after an elongated foreign tour. Opium used to be a weekly hangout when our office was at Omega Tower, Salt Lake. Every face were so familiar that we could speak our hearts out to them about everything. The menu card became a nursery rhyme book which can be orated even in sleep. 

Once inside Opium, we were offerred a personal space at the inner part of the pub, which is seggregated from the rest by brick walls. Each table were left to their own will in terms of order placement (we were 30 odd team members). For us, it's revising the old chapter. Without a hesitation, we ordered  Dry Mutton Liver, Dry Chilli Chickem, Cheesy Fish Stick, Crispy Chilli Baby Corn, Mutton Patiala and Opium Chicken Special. These are, without a doubt, the best in town in terms of the price which it offers. Mutton Liver is my favourite over here. The starters were repeated, also ordered Chicken Salad and Chilli Pepper Chicken. The last two weren't that great. We skipped our main dish (never liked it) and kept our taste buds satisfied with the awesome starters. Hospitality of the house staff is excellent - that is what draws me over there everytime. 

The pub doesn't have their own parking but you will find ample space to park in the nooks and corner of EP/GP block. It's not a restaurant, doesn't even try to give you that feeling. Excellent place to hit with your friends, not with your wife.

Cozy interiors with well spaced out seating, wooden bar that seems inviting, great choice of music being played at a volume that allows normal conversation, friendly wait staff, good crowd - all contribute to a fab watering hole for the techies and non-techies alike. Weekdays get really crowded and you might have to wait for a while for a table. Weekends are a little thin but things does heat up 7:30 onward. What I love is the typical laid back atmosphere that you look for in a pub and no one rushes you. You nurse your drink and nibble at your food, lost in pointless conversations. The prices are towards the higher side. Food is pretty decent. Mutton Patiala is their most popular dish - boneless pieces of mutton in a spicy gravy wrapped in a huge omelette and finished with gated egg on top. As innovative as it is tasty. I would recommend the mutton patiala over the chicken one as its much more tasty and spicy. Other starters like Chicken Tandoori, Chicken Lollypop, Chicken Tangri kabab, Chili Chicken are good. Food is good and accompanies your drink just fine but is not a real conversation stopper (except the mutton patiala)!!! I guess which is the basic criteria of a good pub. reasonable drinks, good ambiance and great friends....and that is exactly what Opium is about.

One of the best place in the town to have a nice drinking session with your friends. The decor is good, brilliant ambiance, service is swift, food tasted pretty decent and good music. I think they serve the best Cheese Balls in the town. Prices are reasonable and the best thing is that you can enjoy live sports.

Opium is our very own place- a regular bar for us. There are a lot of memories attached to this place. The ambience is good. Decent enough. Service is adequately fast given the crowd. Most importantly, if your snacks goes wrong, best of alchohol wont be able to make good of the lost mood. As far as our belief goes, Opium dsnt dilute your drink wid cheaper brand/ water. Its pocker friendly. The only thing negative about it is the queue. You have to wait for 45mins before you are lucky.
But overall, Opium is a smart choice.

Having spent 8 years in sector v before moving out of kolkata, I've visited this place n number of times. And I am happy to say that not for once I have regretted the decision to spend time there. The interior is good, albeit a little cramped; the food, excellent for a pub and the liquor is reasonably priced. The music played is mostly classic rock though recently they have added a dash of electronics and house. The service is quite good even though the place is filled all the time. Overall, one of the better places to have a few drinks with your friends. Highly recommended.

The music is over loud for your ear drums, so, I like it when the music is not being played. The price is a little higher yet its affordable. Overall, a cool place to hangout with friends.

One good,standard bar in salt lake area.

Place, ambience is good. Soft music, LCDs if you want to watch a cricket match with a pint of beer in hand and snacks on the table. Serving staff is very good and professional.

Hard to get a place on fridays as its official drinking day for IT people after a week long hardwork, so better leave the office soon :P

Drinks price is ok not too inflated. Food is very nice. Can smoke outside if you want, ample space and adjacent panwari shop.

All in all a good place to have a drink with friends.

One of the best places in Sector-5 to hangout with friends and colleagues. The bar has a very good stock and the price of the drinks are quite reasonable. The friendly staff, large screen televisions and good food makes it one of most loved bar cum restaurant in Sector-5, Salt Lake. The seating is pretty comfortable with big sofas and cushioned chairs.
    The bar stocks almost all kinds of beers, single malt whiskies, vodkas, tequilla and other spirits. Cocktails however are not worth a try. They have a wide variety of starters. The following deserve special mention:  rashmi kebab, cheese-cherry pineapple, chicken with boiled veg. However, the most popular starter is obviously the mutton patiala, an item which they create to perfection.
    Most of the items in the indian tandoori menu is usually good, though some chicken dishes in the main course may seem to  be unnecessarily spicy and the chicken may seem undercooked at times.
    At lunchtime, depending on the customer load, they may prepare traditional bengali dishes on special request and they prepare it very well. The food is always very fresh.
    The place remains full late in the evenings for most days of the week. The place does lack ambience but it makes up for it with good food and reasonably priced drinks. Not recommended for a family dinner.

Let me start off by saying that Opium is one of the coolest bars I have set foot in. Ever.
living in south Calcutta, what tempted me to travel all the way to the other end of the city was the fact that they are one of the few places in the city that offer tequila at their bar. And pretty cheap at that. 
It is a little difficult to locate, you might have to walk a bit from where the bus drops you, but it's worth the trouble.
The bar has an extremely fancy looking pirate-esque wooden door. If you think that was impressive, wait till you walk in the door. The place has soft music playing, pretty amber lighting, seating arrangements with couches if you're going in large groups, regular chairs, and also chairs at the bar. The service is extraordinary. You're ushered in very warmly and taken to a seating arrangement of your choice. The bartender we were assigned was extremely nice too. The waiters are very polite, they keep checking up on you every few minutes. The drinks er reasonably priced too. I had a little tequila and a beer. They offer my favourite brands of liquor and at very modest rates. 
Overall, a great place to unwind if you're looking for a relaxed evening. Thumbs up for Opium ^_^
And just a heads up, it can get crowded on weekends. So be prepared to wait in their waiting area, which is pretty comfortable, by the way.

Opium is one of the most affordable bar and restaurant in kolkata. Its services r also very much satisfactory until n unless u go on friday or any oublic holidays. The other thing is that they alsl serve dishes other than the regular courses. Their choupse and cheese omlette are just delicious. And the ambience is also cool to hang out for a long tym with your friends and partners. If you have not been here, I would suggest you should definitely try it atleast once.

One of the famous bars in sector V, its always overcrowded, especially on weekends. The ambience inside is pretty cool with dim lighting and pictures of famous rock bands adorning the walls. There is always some sport running on the numerous televisions. This bar is among the cheaper ones in the city. Their collection of drinks is pretty amazing and most of the time u get what u want. The starters are also mouthwatering. Do not forget to try out peanut masala. It goes well with drinks. Never had main course here so cannot comment on it. The service is a bit on the lazy side but all in all the place is great and is a must visit if you are in the mood for a drink in sector V.

I've been a Sector V regular for over 8 years - and I've always wanted to visit this very famous bar called Opium! The name itself spells addiction - and I  must say, once you go there, you'll always want to return!

It was only recently that I finally got the opportunity to go there. It was a Friday evening, and we weren't sure we'd get place to get in - it gets super crowded on Fridays and weekends - not that you'll ever find it empty - being in the heart of Sector V its the perfect place for an evening out! But since we were just 2 people, they could fit us in - and it was one evening I thoroughly enjoyed!

The drink suggestions were good, the service was also quite amazing considering the number of people at the time - the staff was very courteous and friendly. The starters - both veg (for me) and non-veg (for my friend) were also good. I'm not sure about the food - because we didn't really eat per se - just some starters and quick bites with our poison - but they were filling and delicious.

The cost was not too high either - and the fact that they give corporate discounts - means a lot of office goers can make it without burning a hole in their pockets! I plan to be a return customer - as and when I get another chance, and I hope it's not another 8 years! :P

One of the oldest and famous bars in the heart of sector v. can't say about the food as I went there with friends for a few drinks, but the service is good enough. Starters are a good company when you're sitting down for an hour or two talking about life with your pals. The odd thing though is the long queues on Friday nights which is obvious.

Opium - first choice if we plan a lunch/dinner get together in lunch break or after work! The food is Wow! The service is a bit slow but then the food compensates that!

Little issues: The place feels a bit jam-packed with furnitures and customers. Moreover the drinkers and non-drinkers are seated in the same area so at times it feels a bit uncomfortable for the non-drinkers and/or conservatives like us.

Being a south Calcuttan, salt lake isn't one of my regular hang-out localities to chill or have dinner/drinks at. Therefore when my friends suggested Opium I was a lil apprehensive and unsure- however this place turned out to be quite a pleasant surprise. The ambience is relaxed and easy going with most of the patrons being sector 5 IT professionals. The food and drinks are reasonably priced and even though the standard of food isnt outstanding, it isn't too bad either. Overall a cool place to hang out at. Oh, and the music is pretty fantastic:) Retro, classic rock, the works:)

Ok...thats a very busy place guys..better keep some spare time if you wish to visit here..because a queue is inevitable..specially if you are in a large group. But when you enter there is a particular aura that will engulf you. Rock Band playing in the background, live football in the tv, crowds cheering there teams as well as chatting with themselves... staffs enjoying themselves too. Lively. 

Straight to food...Oriental omelet (quite rich with the cheese inside) was pretty good, mutton patiala(bits of mutton and gravy with a crust of egg dressed with more cheese) blew away my mind, mutton sheek kabab was good but the chutney alongwith was a bit disappointing(didn't complement the spicy kabab), didn't find something extraordinarily new in tandoori chicken(which I was looking for after reading the reviews) but it was good. Crispy Chili baby corn and crisp chicken also shared the same fate as other average restaurant. We didn't have to look deeply for main course as we were pretty full with the drinks and starters as they were very quantitative. Ohh.. Not to miss out the quality. :-) 
Looking forward to try out some fishes next time I visit.

Nice ambiance. food and drinks are as per the quality. Service is really good. You can definitely hangout on weekends with friends or family but make sure you arrive a bit early on friday otherwise difficult to get a seat within a n hour.
Well just want to add a bit more--starters with drinks at optimum price you can find here. for other food, this place is not  one for any special preparations, neither they will dishearten you nor you delight you. So best place to sit and drink and enjoy the starters in a perfect ambiance.
My previous rating was 4.5 as each time I have visited this place , i was happy but things have changed a lot.
Let me narrate my last visit with a group of 10 people.
For starters, we had tandoori chicken, oriental omelette, fish cheese finger(as normal fish finger was not available), baby corn and mushroom.
The fish cheese finger--please either they improve it or I strongly recommend people not to have it, its just not edible, stale fish smell mixed with cheese--disgusting taste(felt like vomiting after that), chicken tandoori was also not succulent, appeared to be stale again.
Veg items and omelette were satisfactory.
Coming to main course--kulcha, chicken bharta and mutton keema was there-- not much grudge against those dishes excepting the last one we ordered --a gravy with boneless mutton pieces--trust me you will have a good facial exercise after having that food--hard pieces with bad taste.
So updated rating from my side is 3.5

If I remember correctly it was the first resto-bar that started serving alcohol in Sector V. I have been visiting this place for three years now. Every time I walk into Opium I happen to enjoy my moment.
Opium does not have a striking difference with any other pub; neither does it have an exquisite brilliant cuisine to offer but the feel, the surrounding, the alcohol and the sports channels makes me visit this place very often. 
For music lovers, it gives a decent look-around with a few rock music posters on the wall which includes the likes of Jim Morrison, Bob Marley and Guns N Roses posters, but I strongly wish they changed their playlist a little more often. 
Hanging out with friends is the best excuse that you can make if you wish to visit Opium.
The price for food and beverage is very modest and to add to it is the additional corporate discount on alcohol that they offer. Try the Mutton Patiala without spending much time on what food to order.
Opium did start without much competition a few years back, but with development of the place its competition has developed as well. Yet it is almost full on evenings, hence you may have to wait a little, but it is worth the wait.

Best food (specifically Continental), cheapest liquor and heaven for sector V people. It's so popular that it gets difficult to grab a seat even on Monday evenings. Specialities include oriental omelette, mutton liver fry, kakori kebab, saut√©ed chicken sausage. Very ordinary decor but very good service from the staff especially considering how crazy it gets towards the end if the week. USP opium is the liquor price along with the amazing food quality that supports the booze. There are not many places in town where you might end up spending more money on the food than the liquor. Long way to go. It has kept sector V alive.

OPIUM is easy to spot once we got out of RBD Cinemas. Located in the heart of IT parks of Sector 5, it gets pretty crowded on a Friday evening. The ambiance is very good with foot ball and NIRVANA playing on the various screens. Gives it a very sports bar kind of feel. There is a quieter non smoking, low music section which is okay as well. But we preferred the main seating area where all the action was. Unlike other descriptions, I did not find this place dimly lit or smelly. 
Service staff is very friendly and courteous. You get a 10% discount on your drinks if you mention that you are from the  IT companies here. Group of women too come here and enjoy by themselves, it is very safe and in a office area, so getting taxi is very convenient even when it is late. Opium closes by 10:30 PM.
Drinks are very cheap compared to Park Street and the crowd here is very decent, all professionals. Food was very good - Oriental Omelet was large and served hot, goes well with beer etc. Stuffed well with cheese, chicken and mushrooms. Almost all tables ordered it. Crispy chicken and was huge hit. Cheesy sticks was heartily stuffed with cheese...another hot favourite. We enjoyed our time with "November Rain" playing and Barclays' Premier League greatest goals playing on big screen.

We chose this place for couple of our colleagues treat for a weekday lunch, its located on the corner of the street where i work, so it was pretty easy to get there.

The restuarant inside had this bar kinda dim lights kinda effect(which i liked), on the entrance to the left side there was this pretty large booze counter(with interesting stuff although we din indulge in one), we choose a convinient corner for about 12 of us.

The interiors had the rockish decors with posters of Nirvana, Kurt Cobainish stuffs which were pretty cool. At some point I felt a little stuffy and i did notice a couple of small cockroaches on the walls(Its a complete put-off when it comes to restuarants)

The menu looked very interesting with some unusual list of items, the favourites were continental omlette (filled with cheese,mushrooms and chicken), chicken senakati,Mutton patiala among the non-veg colleague, i loved the paneer patiala and naan which i ordered, they were super delicious!!

This is a great place for some not-so-common super delicious food, with some booze and a chit-chat with not causing a big-hole in your pocket.Great place for value for money.

Opium is perhaps the 1st watering hole which started catering to the Sector V techies almost a decade ago. Definitely the most popular pub in the vicinity as it is characterized by long waiting times and is flocked by some regulars who work nearby. I happened to visit this place recently after a long gap of 7-8 years ! 

Located at the heart of Sector V, behind the Infinity tower, the entire place has gone through a metamorphosis as I could not recognize the place upon entering. It was a Friday night and was packed to capacity. We had to wait for around 30-35 minutes to get a table for two. The ambiance is pretty good. The bar area is pretty big. The walls are embellished with Classic rock posters. The playlist was definitely dominated by English Pop/ Classic Rock songs. The place is pretty big and can easily accommodate around 60-65 people. 

Our orders were simple, 2 Tuborg beers, 1 Oriental Omelette and  later on we ordered a Chicken Cheese stick. The beers came in a matter of 2-3 minutes. It was served chilled with some regular munchies. 
The omelette took some time to arrive on our table and when it did we were pretty disappointed with the fact that it was absolutely cold ! The stuffing was generous though with good amount of chicken, cheese and mushroom but it tasted kind of stale as the egg coating tasted weird. 
Next up was the chicken cheese sticks. Again the amount of cheese and chicken was satisfactory but it took a lot of effort to actually cut them into small pieces and have it as the sticks were very rubbery and hard ! Frankly speaking I was disappointed with the food in Opium and it is such a huge contrast to what the food used to be during my 1st visit several years back. 

Service was fine and the waiters were polite. Opium offers free wifi to its patrons, which is a plus. 

Food and beverage is priced decently and 2 people can enjoy food and drinks within Rs800-900. That being said, the food quality needs to improve significantly. It was a very average experience, still rating it 3.5 for my previous experience and the free wifi. Nonetheless a good place to hang out post work

Opium is a cracker in SeC 5 region with good ambiance with great food and hard drinks. Most of the times it is full in lunch and dinner-time.

Although I am not a drinker I can not comment on the pricing, but from the ambiance and others feedback it seems very good. Food wise it is very good too. Triple layered rice, Kalmi kebab, Tandoori, Chicken preparations (thai red curry) were very good. Proportion is ok, not overwhelming but can satisfy the normal eaters. Chinese and Indian both are favorites here with the drinks.

so you want enjoy with your colleagues and friends, give it a go. It will not disappoint you.

Opium was in my wishlist for a long long time.When I finally did visit,I absolutely loved it and so much so that I have already visited this place twice in the last month.

Located in Sector 5 very near to Barbeque Nation this pub is very popular and for good reason too.Although it is mainly a pub,this place has a very extensive and interesting food menu.The quality of the food here is a bit unpredictable but in general its quite good.Among the items I have had here are crispy chicken,crispy chili babycorn,chicken lollypop all of which were decent.They go well with the drinks.
But the items that mainly drew my fancy here are the Mutton Patiala and the Fish Mexicana.I had ordered these mainly for experimentation but I was so impressed that I am looking forward to trying some of the other interesting and different looking options in the menu.The Mutton Patiala is small pieces of tender well cooked mutton wrapped in a layer of egg.It was absolutely brilliant.It was one of the best items I have had of late and I could visit this place again just for this one item! The fish mexicana was like crispy fish pakoras with a very tasty spicy stuffing.

The main attraction of this place is undoubtedly the drinks.The bar is well stocked and most importantly the drinks are quite cheap compared to other places.

The ambience is decent.There is nice music playing in the background.The cleanliness and maintenance is not the best I would say as we had found a few small insects in the wall on one of our visits.The service is slow and needs improvement.The food and even the drinks invariably take quite a while to arrive.The seating arrangements though decent can be made a little more comfortable.The place gets very crowded in the evenings and the crowd may not be the best.

It is very hard not to compare this place to Oly Pub.The prices here are a little higher but the ambience is better.Opium can very well be called the Oly Pub of North Kolkata!!

Overall, in spite of the shortcomings this is a wonderful value for money place for the young crowd to get together and have a drink.I absolutely loved it and will surely be back.
Enjoy..Cheers..:)

If you are working at Sector V but never visited Opium, you have missed something. I am regular over there for the last many years, still don't get tired of having their Fried Mutton and Chicken Tandoori. Reasonably priced, their Alcohol menu is really enviable. I wish to have those in my home too. It's usually packed irrespective of Friday or Monday. The staffs are working there for quite some time now and always come up with good suggestion. They have also improvised on many foods, which, I would say is great !!! Opium happens to be my eternal favorite and I would recommend this to everyone, whether you are working in Sector V or not....

Last Sunday, I checked in at Opium with my colleagues. It was packed and we had to wait for about half an hour. Based on Zomato recommendations, we ordered Cheese Fish Sticks, Mexican Fish and Crispy Chicken. The food turned out to be good enough and the service was quick. The chairs are comfortable, a welcome thing after a tiring day. If you go in a large group, try to get one of the sofas.

I was dragged to Opium by some friends and as I am not much of a drinker I don't enjoy or frequent bars where people visit simply because alcohol is also reasonably priced to be honest. However I was dangled the bait of very good starters which is what tipped the balance so I ventured there. The decor is average nothing to get excited about and service quite poor unless your a regular who is a generous tipper ! What surprised me however was the variety of food on the menu much more than the average bar in most cases. We stuck to starters and ordered up Tandoori Chicken (very nice) , Fish Finger (average) , Chilly Chicken ( nice enough) , Cheese Ball ( average) and Crispy Chilly Baby-corn (nice). Overall not bad in terms of the snacks .... and I was told that the food was quite decent too. However the crowd is not always very sophisticated and as the evening progressed turned quite loud so ladies please head there in groups with male friends/family to escort you.

Visited Opium last sunday before wtching movie in RDB. Well initially it seemed like crap, not so good atmosphere,  tiny cockroaches here nd there...

We ordered vetzi zazaro... absolutely mindblowing, fish was so fresh and the cheese, OMG it was awsm. Then we tried chicked cicinati, fsh cheese stks and chicjen kalmi, all of them were preety good.even the staffs were good.

Well suggestions... please be a little more professional, I mean it does not feel good when someone has to wash his hands by a bottle of water given by the waiter after he does not get water in the toilet...

This is a lovely pub in Salt Lake and good enough to have a nice drink when driving down to Someplace Else is not an option. The pocket pinch is high but then if one decides to splurge on alcohol, surely pockets have to be filled with cash(or cards) right? Well, I have been to Opium quite a few times, both before and after its renovation and I liked the food there. The drinks surely are not their credit but the manufacturers' perhaps but they know their cocktails and it is highly probable that you will relax with a cool cosmopolitan while the stereo belts out Bon Jovi numbers.

I always use opium to catch up with my cousin and we just love the place. I am not particularly fond of the seating arrangements but the bar-top is good enough for a seat and a quiet drink (with rock music blaring all around, of course). The best oart is perhaps the decoration on the walls with the photographs of the rockstars of the good old eighties!!!

Highly recommended

Food is simply not up to the mark. Even the roasted papad sucked. Chicken tikka wasn't great. Chicken lollipop was so unappetising that I didn't been bother to try it. Drinks are quite cheap though and the Bon Jovi on repeat music isn't too bad either.

Being a bengali, born and bought up in Delhi, I've never had a chance to live in Kolkata. So when I got relocated to salt lake, I was delighted and opium was the first pub in salt lake that I visited. First impression, must say, was not that good. Going by the reviews, I would say that it's pretty over hyped. This is a place for regulars. Period. If you are a new visitor, don't expect good service. The waiters will serve you as if they are doing you a favour. Also, this place does not have a separate  DJ and the waiters are the ones who play the music. They claim that they play "Rock", but when you request them for a song, they are clueless! Having said that, I must say, the food is pretty good and, well, if you do become a regular (and tip well), you will be treated like a celebrity! Overall a decent place to hangout with friends.

Opium is a blessing in sector 5 and especially with the corporate discounts in place. My love for opium has drawn me to sector 5 even on Sundays, late evenings, seasonal celebrations, so on and so forth. As most sector 5 people would empathize, I have simply lost count of the innumerable raids at Opium with my peeps. Opium's uber popularity unfortunately makes way for long lines during peak hours but that fact is over looked, ignored and sidelined by the Opium fans. When you want Opium, you possibly cannot think of a compensation. ^_^
My friends and I have stuck to our favourite appetizers here and never had the opportunity to try the main course. Ordering and reordeing our favourites on the table generally fills us to the brim, not allowing to go beyond appetizers. Our particular favourites comprise the oriental omlette, Mexican fish, chilli chicken, chicken cheese and fish cheese sticks, crispy chiili babycorn and crunchy chicken. The oriental omlette is the best omlette I have had in Kolkata, it reminds me of Keventer's through and through. The generous stuffing with cheese and chicken inside the omlette makes way for each-to-his-own order amongst us. :P I love the onion rings and dip that accompany the Mexican fish. The deep fried sea fish has a lovely coating that goes brilliantly well with the dip and pushes one towards unstoppable gorging. The rest of the starters follow the same story of being a PERFECT snack and thus we are presented with an exorbitant bill that our hazy, spirit intoxicated eyes fail to make terms with. Yes, it is ALWAYS exorbitant, thanks to the greedy bunch we are. 
Since Opium has nothing to with the brands of alcohols they serve, I must appreciate their cocktails. The sex on the beach, long island iced tea and screwdrivers are my favourites. Strong and tasty, the cocktails they make ensure you treat them back with a large sum of money. This is not to say the place is expensive and highly priced. If one can spend with brevity at Opium, it is probably the best casual pub in Kolkata. Hic.

This place was partially closed for almost a month for renovation and has recently reopened. If you do drop in here, definitely try out the oriental omlet and mushroom cheese chilly. Good music to go with the drinks. Plus there's also a large screen which seems perfect on match days. They usually have a good collection of beer.

One of the most popular and oldest watering holes in Salt Lake Sector 5 where I visit frequently. The USP of this place is cheap drinks compared to the rest of the bars in the area. This is one place where you can quickly down a beer with some food and get back to work! The decor is pretty simple and as some of my co-reviewers have suggested, you better reserve a table if you're visiting in the evenings. The bar is well stocked and has a number of Indian and foreign liquor

The food is standard...i have ordered the most common dishes with my drinks..dry chilli chicken and tikka kebab. The taste can vary if you repeat your food order and can take some time. I am a big fan of their kabuli nan which is extremely well made and filling. You can have it with any mughlai side dish be it a butter masala or bharta. 

This is generally a place frequented by the IT crowd enjoying a drink or two after work. Be careful while bitching about your workplace, your boss could be at the next table showing his frustrations!

If you are going on any weekday evening please ensure to reserve your table. This is one of those hubs for IT corporates. Drink variety is endless if you don't have budget limit. Food are equally good. Liked their specialty Cheese Grilled Bhekti. Ambiance is kinda ok but it ought to be loud inside. The speakers inside the property is not tuned or good quality hence music is so annoying sometime. In case you like any of their liquor can pick it up on your way home form their FL shop next door.

Probably the best place to loose stress on Friday night after a monotonous week, if your office is in sector V. Drink is good. Food is good. Ambience is the best you can have for the money you are spending. Gives a pub like feel, which is unlike it's neighbouring places. The only negative I feel this place has, is the time taken for your order being delivered. But once you start frequenting the place, you'd get used to it.

The minds that worked behind this set up sure had a vision. It was set up when the Sec V story was just about unfolding. It now  is one of the Top Grossers in terms of Revenue in Town. Possibly has one of the highest daily footfalls. 
Decor : Very Western. Not a perfect square or rectangle. Various seating options. Apt lighting. Neither conjucted - nor space crunch - apt utilization. Where-ever you are seated - you will have a TV set to stare at within your eyesight. Super for match Lovers. Ambiance : Chic and young crowd. Young staff. Good music. Service : Top Class. Whether you tip generously or not makes no difference to Quality of service. Well managed by veterans like Mr Mukherjee. Drinks : Extended variety of liquor, cocktails and mocktails available. Possibly one of the best. Pricing : Nominal. Food : Being a vegetarian will be able to single out a few good veggie dishes that you will not find elsewhere :
1. Chrispy Chilly Potatao - Is crisp!!! Is tasty and simply out of the world. I have made quite a few frnz who get sick seeing veg bcum a fan. For that matter, the other two crispy chilly items are cooked well too - Paneer and Babycorn. 
 2. Burnt Garlic Fried Rice - Minimum oil. No spices. Subdued taste of garlic with Rice is enchanting.  Overall the food is good and not at all disappointing. Only exception being when the chef is not in the mood. The food seems like from some other planet on those occasions. But then that happens only when you are damn unlucky. A happening value for money zone. NJoy !!!

Opium is basically a Bar based restaurant where most of the visitors come to have drinks with thr food. Frequently visited by office n cllg ppl frm Sec V n I will not recommend it for a family visit.
The place is quite worthy if U r for drinks n dinner (or lunch). Ambience is quite standard and its a by-default choice for Sec V ppl as this1 is quite old.
Service is good enough and a variety of choices are available for drinks.
Price is very affordable compared to Sec V standards.

The booze is cheap and the quality is good. The place is nice and the waiters are friendly enough even though you have to wave your arms (not just hands) to get them to come over. Can't say much of the food, we only had the chicken lollipop and french fries which were more than decent. 
We encountered a rowdy bunch sitting adjacent to our table, constantly eyeing us and making weird facial gestures and sometimes whistling. We asked the waiters to change our table away from those. And it was better for a while till a balled up napkin came flying at my head from nowhere. It didn't seem like an accident. We decided to get our bill and leave soon. We didn't feel threatened as it was not that late and we had a car waiting just outside, but were severely annoyed at this experience.

A favorite watering hole once upon a time, but now visited less often. Food and booze is cheap compared to the rest of the places in the area, and many a time, as frustrated corporate people, we have come here, had a drink and bitched about our bosses. Prices are the biggest factor however, because the service leaves a lot to be desired. They are quite abrupt, and can leave your table in the middle of you placing your order. 

Our last time at this place had me sitting with a friend, drinking beer, when a major argument broke out between the servers and a group of customers over food, and continued for 40 minutes. The customers, drunk, were very loud, and I must say that the management did their level best to calm the people down. However, the disruption made me stay away from the place for quite some time afterwards. 

Personally speaking, nothing much to write home about when it comes to the food. Its okay, and yes, although many will disagree with me, I would say, the food here is probably sourced from somewhere else, as it does not taste very consistent. One plate of a particular dish would be nice, but the next plate might be a disaster. So yes, tread cautiously, and you will be rewarded.

One of the oldest pubs in Sector V and still the leading one by a huge margin... The food, music, ambience, decor backs up the great stock of drinks and cocktails.....
They always have the latest range of drinks, sometimes off menu as well.... So even if u don't see a drink on the menu, be sure to ask for it....
Delectable food... esp the starters like-chicken cheese stick, Vetki Zezero, Dry Chilli Chicken, Chicken Ballentine..... Even the main course is excellent.... This is one pub that will entice even the "dry souls" just for their quality of food!! 
Pricing is very reasonable... They even have offers on a regular basis...... And it's been quite some time they haven't hiked the price....Cheers to that!!!!

Good place in sector V area to eat out with your colleagues. Food items are reasonably priced and so are the drinks. So, without pinching the pocket, it will provide good food. Ednered (accor) and Sodexho restaurant coupons are accepted here but the 10% food discount (given in all other modes of payment) is not available in that case. The mixed gravy noodles is quite good. It serves equally good Chinese and Indian food

The best bar in Sector V. A perfect place to relax and unwind after a hectic day at work. Choice of music is excellent with mostly a classic / alt rock based playlist. Combined with this is the nice and cozy ambiance which makes one feel very comfortable. Liquor is reasonable and food is excellent. Some of my favorites include Dim Bhujiya (oh, it's excellent), Chicken Tikka Kebab and Chicken Balentine.

It even has a spare room which normally opens if the normal seating area is full and there's a huge queue. Alternatively, for any office party of 20 or more people, you can specially book that space and have it all to yourself. 

Overall, fantastic place and doing a great job over the years. Numerous bars have cropped up in Sector V, but this one still remains a favorite.

A funky, zesty place in Sector V catering to the young, hip, tech population around the area. With Jimi Hendrix and Bob Marley posters around and reasonable prices of drink, it is a favourite haunt for an evening out drinking with friends. 

The zesty youthful feel of the place drags in many crowds and weekend evenings are always very crowded. Unlike a lot of other restobars, this place doesn't compromise on its food, the quality is always good. The chickeen pakora and the tandoori make for good side-eats to one's drink.

Me and my wife are quite fan of opium.We were introduced to this pub 2yrs back by one of our techie friends and been going there ever  since. I like their english pub like ambience with a large screen lcd tv playing english hits. Their alcohol prices are reasonable.They also have an extensive menue for starters and main course. Our favourites are two fish items, mexican fish and bhetki jejero. Just try them and you will know why.

Being a slave of the IT sector and residing in Kolkata , there's simply no way you have not heard of Opium..Love the ambiance and the decor of the Pub and I would say one of the very few Bars in Kolkata where they have proper Bar Stools to sit and sip..
Now this place is as much a bar as it is a good restaurant, I know a lot of people who frequent this place just for the Food it serves, the service I would say is good, the waiters moderately friendly and the price well within Budget..
The Mutton Patiala just melts in your mouth and Chicken Salad, Mexican Fish, Fish Tikka Kabab are very commendable...i also love their Crispy Chilli Baby Corn and Chicken with Cashew..

Now as far as drinks goes they do have quiet a stock.rite from Cheap Indian Whiskeys like Royal Stag or Imperial Blue to Top Notch Single Malts like Glenfiddich or Jameson(this is very rare!).
I would say it shouldn't cost someone more then 1200 bucks for 2-3 People if dont drown your self there :).

This used to be the only bar inside the office places of Sector V at one time. Now times have changed and there are a lot of bars inside Sector V. This place serves alcohol at a very reasonable price. But this place is just not about cheap liquor. It serves some pretty good food. My favorite is the very simple chicken salad that they serve. The dry chicken starters and tandoori's are also very good. The Chinese food is decent. Overall a good place for food and drinks. Ambiance is not  very suitable for family though...

Followed by the reviews from zomato, i decided to go to opium on oshtomi with my girlfriend. The ambiance was very good and illutic. I loved the posters especially that of bob marley's. We went there to have some evening snacks so ordered chicken pakora, spicy chicken and these were very tasty and delicious indeed. The only thing i regret for is that was a dry day. I'm waiting to be there again and munch. For my end a thumbs up to opium :)

The food being not most important, this place provides the right ambiance and treatment for the office returns. Food does not taste great, but the snacks are well deserving as drink accompaniment.

Excellent food, good crowd and reasonable price are the KPI of this place. Located in the IT sector of Kolkata, this is one of the best pubs in town and a perfect place to unwind with friends after a hard day at office and/or otherwise!

perfect for hanging out with friends after a tough day at work. good food (mexican fish, fried mutton, chicken balentine etc are superb), nice drinks and very humble set of waiters (rishi da, dibyendu, dipankar, pradip etc) to help you for a nice experience. thumbs up for a nice restaurant.

For a change, this is a pub which serves excellent food along with beverages. It was surprising for me as usually the pubs I have visited do not offer great food items or are usually stale. But his place is a revelation,  right from Indian to Chinese the food is too good. Especially the tandoori chicken is splendidly cooked. The drinks are cheaper than other pubs around. This place is near the RDB Boulevard at sector 5. A place usually occupied by the tech people around. Nice place to catch up on a drink n munch on some tasty starters.

Four of us (2 boys & 2 Girls) visited this place today itself. It was the first time we went there. Its a nice place to hangout. If you want to have lunch or dinner at reasonable rates then this is the place. The plus point is Drinks are priced at reasonable rates. For instance jhonny walker redlabel scotch @ rs 250 teachers @ 270, tequila @ 190 etc. There were nice cocktails too. We had Tandoori Chicken and Crispy Chilly Babycorn for starters. Babycorn was good, Tandoori Chicken was competent. Main course was Chinese Chicken, Haka Chow, Chilly Chicken and Manchurian. Again Chinese was also OK. The only thing lacking is the slow service. But I don't think its a place to visit with family, youngsters and couples and office colleagues will enjoy this place without burning a hole in the pocket.

Opium is one of the best place to visit if you are at planning to have some delicious food with drinks at a resionable price. The favourite dish are Mutton liver masala, Oriental Omlet, Maxican Fish. The crew are nice, nice ambience. If you dnt booze , dont worry there are lots of other drinks and mocktails. A perfect place to be there with friends.

If u want an evening out with a group of friends with Floyd,Jimi Hendrix and the likes for company,sipping onto your favourite cocktail or soaking up those tequila shots,Opium is the place to be. Nestled within the bustling Sector V Opium is the kind of place where you want to be if you have company. And if alcohol isnt your call you have mocktails and juices to kip you company. The starters here are simply fantabulous-especially the Chilly Chicken dry and a variant of Kung Pao Chicken(which they call Chicken with Cashew),the chilli paneer and the crispy chilli babycorn. And all quite reasonably priced. So next time there's a drizzle when your'e heading home after work with ur group of friends,just spend some time at opium..and like the name suggests the experience would be truly intoxicating.

After a days work if you want to get some relaxation then this is the place to sit and booz. The ambiance,service and food all are good. I have visited many times with my friends and never disappointed by their food or service. "Chicken salad", "Maxican fish","Fish tikka kebab" are amezing, must try.

A nice,cosy pub in the middle of the hustle-bustle of sector V,offering a wide range of food and drinks for the weary and thirsty souls in a very reasonable price range makes Opium one of the places i love to haunt on a regular basis.They offer discounts on certain items daily,so chances are you might get your favorite scotch at a much lower price,if you are lucky enough.They also serve a variety of cocktails with price startin from Rs.120 only including the usuals like Sex on the Beach,Orange Twist,Long Island and the list goes on to Martini and various other delights.

Food is delicious,specially the chicken based starters.I never tasted a better salted pepper chicken anywhere else but here.The music and the dim lighting along with the wooden interior sets the mood.Besides its a great hangout place and being easy on your pockets its popular among college-goers like me too.
