These people have a problem picking up your call and thus, call you back later.

Located in the same building as Dominos, at the building entrance. Won't say it's very hygienic but its neither dirty, except that they make their parathas on a wooden table outside the outlet. Has 1 table to sit and eat while, 5-6 waiting stools.

Service- 7/10

Ordered Veg Rice+Chilli Chicken combo but they didn't have rice prepared and needed 30mins of waiting. So, settled with the Chowmein combo at the same price.

Generous amount of noodles and chilli chicken gravy.
The chilli chicken sizes were as small as a PULSE candy. WARNING, you might swallow a piece of chilli chicken thinking that it's just gravy and then think that they have you less pieces!
★Veg Chow(6/10): Good Quantity, Decent taste, but I love the thicker variant of noodles.
★Chilli Chicken(6/10): Too small pieces(see pics), like a PULSE candy as said earlier. Tasted just above decent.

If you don't have hygiene problems, you can opt for roadside stalls which fall on the same footpath(shops will be located left) as you walk towards the station. They serve similar quantity of Chow/rice , bigger sized chicken on side dishes and slightly better taste at same prices.

Good quality (indianised) Chinese food. Food was delivered on time. I had chicken Szechuan rice and mixed Noodles with chilli fish and dry crispy honey Chicken. The food taste was average. The prices are very economical. 400 bucks for a group of 4 is more than enough when ordering from Banzara.

The best way to enjoy food is a take away from this joint.At Rs 50/-they provide good amount of noodles+2pcs chilly chicken.[there r other combo options also,but i tried this only].

Momos are also good at a fair price

But the best thing is its highly pocket friendly & quite good in taste

This is a takeaway joint. They make tasty food at very pocket friendly rate. All Chinese chicken items can also be availed in half plate. Also makes good rolls.

This place is near the place I used to go for my tuition. So I was kind of a regular here. Rates are cheap. So food quality is okay type. Its something you know you can eat but not something you crave to eat. Rolls, Noodles, Rice, Chicken all are good but still doesn't excite your taste buds. But for a quick snack when you are hungry its good.

NOTE: Though it is a dine in it has only 4 seats and the interior is nearly 50 degrees. So you have been warned. Avoid the interior.
