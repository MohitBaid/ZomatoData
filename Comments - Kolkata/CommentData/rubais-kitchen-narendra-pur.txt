This is just a small snack bar under the ownership of Kichukhan restaurant and located in the same building. Same items are available in Rubai's kitchen and Kichukhan. But it priced little less in Rubai's. 

I got packed Rumali roti and Chilly chicken for dinner. I usually avoid such low priced eateries as the food is barely edible. I took the risk because of my prior experience with Kichukhan and I also did not have any other option that day. I was pleased to discover that the chilly chicken had no resemblance with the typical one available in snack bars where the gravy is either watery or only made of gelatin and the chicken balls contain less of chicken and more of flour coating. Rubai's  chilly chicken was more like the home cooked version. There were  six pieces of boneless chicken balls that had thin coating. The tangy  gravy was made with sauces and it was of right consistency. It went well with the soft rumali Roti's. The total costing was less than 100/. It is a great option for a quick hassle free dinner as there are hardly any other good choice in this locality.

I've never ever rated a restaurant this low. (You can check my profile)
I had ordered previously many times before when it used to be known as (KichuKhon). Though the food was average there but not worse like it is now (Known as Rubai's Kitchen)
I ordered 2 Biryanis along with a tikka kebab and Chicken tandoori.
Biryani was horrible. Tasted like rice saut√©d with Dalda and had to puke everything. (Even though I just ate half)
Tandoori was burnt and the only respite was tikka kebab but not great.
Hugely disappointed. I don't think am going there anytime sooner.

If you are from rajpur area then you will know what rubai's kitchen is. Actually its just a name only and there is now practical presence of this outlet. Let me explain, search for kichukhon restaurant in rajpur narendrapur area. Yes this restaurant and the rubai's kitchen are the same restaurants. There is no different between them even they share the same kitchen too. If you go there for a take away they will say that if you order the food with rubai's kitchen you don't have to pay the tax or if you order from kichukhon you have to pay that. Food quality is just ok ok only to fill your tummy. :(
