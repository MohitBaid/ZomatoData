Just now visited Hayat situated just near Barrackpore station. Well I must say they makes some good food at affordable price. I ordered some sezwhan noodles, blue lagoon and especially their green chilli chicken taste just awe! Not very much seating space but well managed inside. If you wanna go there, must try their green chilli chicken it's just awesome. Bottomline- A satisfied customer...

It is situated near barrackpore station area, 5mins walking distance from station actually, serves quality foods, the name itself is renowned, everybody knows what hayat brings to you, but this outlet of barrackpore is not so extraordinary as it should be by the name, anyway I ordered Kashmiri pulao and mutter paneer taste and quality wise it is as it should be!

The staff is courteous. Presentation and decor is good too. Since my family is a regular customer so we often get a priority service which is great.
My favorites are- chicken hayat kabab, Lahori chicken and the soft butter naan.

I visited this place for a casual Sunday lunch with a friend. The first thing I would mention about this place is the staff- kind, courteous and always helpful.
The food is not kept in a very hygienic place it being a roadside place that has a takeaway counter.
Mutton biryani, mutton rogan josh and lacchha paratha are particularly good.
At that prices and such a convenient location, its value for your money.

Located quite close to Dada Boudi restro in Barrackpore.Had ordered via zomato so cant define bout d ambiance of the place.Tried mixed fried rice & chicken butter masala, so cant say bout other items but to my surprise i wasnt disappointed in the field of taste.Though a bit dif combination still, it carried on well.Quantity was sufficient,quality was ok.Both the items were good,especially the chicken which was soft and juicy with the gravy having essence of butter & wasnt oily. The rice was also  okay not great,could have been a bit better,anyways was present with chunks of chicken & much prawns present in it.Overall in terms of taste was above my expectation.Service is the place for which my rating gets diminished.Quite pathetic when ordered online.Faced much problem with waiting time of more than 1 hour 20 mins,though the maximum required time is 55 mins.Should have rated+.5 if the service was good.A place to visit if you are close to Barrackpore nd try to avoid online.Another thing,online order remains closed mostly this is another loophole of this restro where attention should be provided.

so what comes first?maybe the looks,ambience and hygiene. It will get distinction in these departments.  When it comes to the food,surely its a surprise, the foods are great. We have ordered Tandoori roti,with Tawa Chicken,the flavors are distinct, well balanced,when its spicy its a burst of spices in your mouth,balanced with care. I didn't expect these much from Hayat,but you know what they say...

You will experience a great service in here,  a quality food.  
Pros-
> Better service than dada bodi and too much better than amania
> Food preparation don't take too long in general. 
> Maintenance & cleanliness are good. 

Cons-
> Food isn't that good to be honest either its veg or non veg or noodles
> They only serve Chinese and biriyani till 1:30 pm

Its good place to have a dinner or late lunch with family and friends. 
All the above points are personally experienced in 8 visits.

First the restraunt is very nice, neat and clean.. The staff are very courteous... 
Now coming to the food we ordered full tandoori chicken for starters and the chicken was soft and tender and the price compared to other restaurants in Barrackpore is low for tandoori chicken.
Nxt we had tandoori roti with chicken tikka butter masala, chicken bharta and mutton lazedar.
Must say all the food was yummy.. and the cherry on top was there green chatni, just what made our food experience best..

Decent place, considering it's located in Barrackpore. There 'Vegetable Navratan Korma' is superb. The remaining fare is alright as well. Has a good 'Free Home Delivery' system in place. The quantity though is unusually less, the least I have seen in any restaurant in my whole life. The photos I am posting here is a proof to that. The money charged is completely disproportionate to the quantity of food offered. Go there if you have an extremely small appetite and lots of money to waste.

Visited this place with a group of friends for a birthday treat. We were 5 and had gift items which we had to keep with us. We told one of the staff members and he told us to keep those on a rack far apart where other people were sitting. Coming to the food,the quality had degraded over time. The jeera rice was awful. The corns in the sweet corn soup were hard and chewy. The chicken item was okeyish. Not satisfied at all. Needs improvement.

I visited the place at the time of the Durga Puja.My friends were wanded to go to the newly opened Barrackpur Aminia outlet.But we didn't get the chance.So,we went to Hayat.It's situated just beside the famous Dada Boudi restaurant.

This restaurant is slightly congested. Ambiance was nice.Staffs were well behaved & Friendly.

Now talk about the food....I ordered Garlic naan, Mutton kadhai & Firni.Garlic naan was awesome.Mutton preparation was also nice.Firni was not so good.The good point is that they don't add tax with their price & the price was also very reasonable.We must say that this one is a pocket friendly restaurant. Want to visit again 💓

In the bustling area of Barrackpore, another everyday restaurant which serves the everyday cuisines hardly makes a difference. The good thing is it is a great choice to fill a stomach in the area because of its commendable quantity and fast service. However the food quality borders on the disappointing side as all the items are soaked in oil and therefore not really good for our cholesterol levels. Went there with a bunch of friends to have a last day of school get- together.  We ordered a variety of items which gave us a clear glimpse of its overall food quality. We had chicken and mutton biriyani, Chicken hakka noodles, shezwan chicken,  mixed fried rice, american chopsuey, butter naan, chicken kadai and crispy baby corn. All the items had more or less good taste but nothing exceptional. The decor is nothing extraordinary but it definitely is okay for a nice family meal.

Great place for couples  or  for small family/friends group.  Best for those who don't like crowd like 'dada boudi'.  Foods are almost same like 'dada boudi' and 'aminia'.  I placed order for special mutton biryani and the quantity was perfect for two people. Only one thing I don't like was ambience, I can give maximum 2 star for ambience. Inside space is really small for a multicuisine restaurant. Service is pretty good. Almost all staff was invited us, they are really good.

Hayat is located near  Barrackpore railway station. It is big with commendable seating capacity. Went there and ordered Tandoori chicken. It was good and tasted delicious. However something was missing in the taste and i have had  better tandooris. Nest we ordered chicken reshmi butter masala with butter tandoori rotis and masala khulchas. The khulcha dissapointed us, compared to its price the quantity was less. Rotis were good. The reshmi was fine though the chicken was bit chewey but the gravy was marvellous and one of the best i had.  Ambience is above average. Staffs are also well behaved. Overall it was a good experience.

This restaurant deserves a poorer rating than this
Dividing the total rating to 2.5 for food and service each, 1.5 is for food. Service gets 0.

Called them, placed order, asked for the total amount, they said they'll call back in 2mins to inform the same. 15min passed, we called and they still couldn't tell us the bill amount and were talking among themselves while we were on phone. As per the time mentioned by them, we reached the restaurant to receive since they couldn't deliver. Waited for another 30 minutes. They have a backdated menu here, when requested to update since we have budget problems later. Even the manager had an egoistic attitude. There were dine-in people in the restaurant, waiting for Biryani and Kebab for more than an hour, having frequent quarrels with their staffs, so it wasn't only us!

*Food*
>Biryani was decent at taste and quantity
>Tengri Butter Masala didn't even have the odour of butter, very spicy. Just average
Butter Naan went hard as soon as it went from hot to light warm,complimentary invisible butter came along
Reshmi Kebab was very good but they didn't provide any salad or sauces with it.
Paneer Butter Masala-Some of us liked it, rest got a bitter taste, I felt the bitterness.
Laccha Paratha was good.

Ambience is nice, clean.

Staffs are decent but service is bit slow.

Tried Chicken Tikka Kebab & Special Chicken Biriyani. Kebab was soft, juicy and yummy and of sufficient quantity. Biriyani was nice too, with tender meat pieces and was well cooked. Quantity was sufficient .

Pocket pinch is reasonable.

Can give Dada Boudi a run for their money.

Tried Chinese , mixed Hakka noodles, Manchurian chicken were delectable .
Tried their mutton biriyani too, it was good , meat was tender, can give tough competition to Dada Boudi. Quantity was good too.
On another occasion, I tried chicken tengri kabab as starter, dum sabzi biriyani, murg tawa masala as main course which were delectable.

Went there for a family dinner. The food is really good. Of all the things that we ordered, i loved chicken bharta the best. Service is commendable. The ambience scores in spite of the small floor space on each floor. Give it a try. Am sure you wont be disappointed!

This place sucks!

We ordered chicken hot and sour soup. It was over-salted. When complained, it was changed with just adding some water. The sweet lime soda is such a common drink but the worst I have ever had. The chicken tandoor was dry, overburnt and awful.
Never coming back here.

It's near barrackpore station. Tried here multiple times, since it's a multi cuisine one.
Tried Chinese , mixed Hakka noodles, Manchurian chicken were delectable .
Tried their mutton biriyani too, it was good , meat was tender, can give tough competition to Dada Boudi. Quantity was good too.
On another occasion, I tried chicken tengri kabab as starter, dum sabzi biriyani, murg tawa masala as main course which were delectable.
Space is average but well decorated and clean , ambience is good but service is bit slow. Overall a must visit for Barrackpurians.

We had biriyani and chicken tikka kebabs, both were delectable. The quantity is more than enough for one person, the mutton in the biryani was soft and could easily be torn apart with the fork. A plate of chicken tikka kebab has six pieces and comes with the green chutney. Hayat is a must visit if you are in this are, it gives a good competition to the other famous biryani restaurants in the area.

In the busy small town of Barrackpore there weren't that many good restaurants earlier. Well this Sunday me along with my friends went out for lunch in Hayat.. 

The dining place is at the first floor. It's quite small area but you normally don't expect much crowd in such small towns. 

We ordered tandoori chicken, kashmiri polao, Punjabi murg masala, chicken biriyani and chicken nawabi. 

The tandoori chicken was delicious and juicy. Just the way we liked it. The biriyani was okay about average. The Punjabi murg masala was also good. 

Overall, we enjoyed the food and had a great time. 

One important thing, they do accept cards. Restaurants which don't accept cards for payment are simply losing customers I feel.

The quantity is sufficient and the waiters are very friendly and on top of that, they don't charge any extras in the from of Service Tax and VAT. The interior decoration is really nice.

The restaurant is located near barrackpore station. The place is very small but they have cleverly used it so that many customers can be accommodated.
being a roll lover, tried chicken roll & egg roll there.the low price was the 1st thing to attract your eyes more than the name of the restaurant but due to the puja the price is hiked a bit.
capsicum is something that u will get more n more as u start eating the roll.good maintenance but small place to sit

After a long time , i came to Bkp on vacation, when my frends decided to go on a dinner on the independence day, as the day was a holiday for people of india....!!! There were lot of people who planned their dinner outside, after roaming a lot and getting disappointed from the managers of all the restaurant . I and my frends turned to Hayat; luckily we got the seat...!!!
We ordered Tandoori chicken for starters , the pieces were good enough and taste wasn't bad.
Then we ordered Biriyani it melted in my mouth, I felt the best taste after long time.
Also to penn down chicken bharta was also delicious with the butter roti.

Keep it up
All together
Me and my frends had a wonderful dinner

Hayat is quite a popular place in Barracpore area and heard about them from a lot of people.

##Location:
Near Barracpore station near the police phari.

##Experience:
Dropped in here for a quick lunch and tried their Chinese cuisine section. It is a multicuisine restaurant where you get Indian food as well which looked very tasty when I had a glimpse of the kebabs on the table beside me. Nevertheless was not in a mood for heavy food so settled down for Chinese and they made my food just perfect which I was expecting. Food is really good and will surely come back if I am in this area again. 
Service was a bit slow but the person serving was quite prompt with this actions. Liked it.

This place was in my bookmarked list since a year. Today got a chance to visit and I had finally a delicious and yummy experience over here. First of all the ambiance is nice and point to be mentioned that the place is very neat and clean. We started eating with the chicken tengri kebab as starter, followed by Dum sabzi nawabi biryani and Murg tawa masala as main course.  The each and every item tasted simply great. I liked the biryani a lot. Tengri kebab was yummy and perfectly cooked. Last but not the least Tawa murg masala was superb in taste. As per my taste I liked the gravy very much. The quality and the quantity both are awesome. The prices are affordable too with no extra tax and VAT. Personally I think this restaurant can give tough competition to the renowned Dada boudi restaurant. The service was prompt and the staffs were also courteous. Surely going back to taste their kebab platter and the chinese section.
5.03.2017 UPDATED THE RATING AFTER VISITING TODAY. DISGUSTING EXPERIENCE. THEY JUST FAILED TO KEEP UP THEIR SERVICE. THEY DON'T KNOW WHEN TO SERVE THE STARTER. IS IT A JOKE? MAIN COURSE WAS SERVED BEFORE STARTER. PATHETIC SERVICE. DISGRACEFUL FOODS WERE SERVED BEFORE US. CHICKEN WAS HARD AND MOST PROBABLY STORED FOR A WHILE SO IT HAD A WEIRD SMELL. NEVER GOING BACK AGAIN. NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL.

Pretty awesome place to be in when the wallet is low but you want delicious mouth watering foods. Been a few times but this time went with two college friends. Ordered the less known dish 'Murg-Masalam' and guess what it turned out to be quite attractive! 
Had to order it almost 1 hour in advance as the preparation needs time and it quite costly. It costed us 450 for one small chicken.
About the dish: Well, I kept expectation high which was not much met when I tasted. The size was small but the taste was better it being a baby chicken. The presentation could have been way better. I found it a bit sweet but my friends loved it. 
If you are up to try something new, go order this one 1 hour in advance and in the meantime have some beer somewhere else like we did. :p

Been there today, and may be the worst resturant I have ever visited in my life. Being a Barrackporian, I have tried almost all the resturants in Barrackpore, but this is the worst. As per their food quality and quantity the price is very high. The quality is very poor along side their quantiy also.

Today we have ordered Schezwan Mixed Chowmein, they firstly took a long time to serve the item, and served a poor quality food. More over they took the balance as tips without asking us.! Allover it was a bad experience.

Their Rolls are a must try.. First time Barrackpore has got a outlet which is as good as Calcutta Rolls!
Also their Biriyani is light and a welcome change from the over hyped Dada Boudi's goodwill Biriyani. Though competition is going to go up with Aminia opening soon.

I simply love its Mutton Biriyani. Mutton is so soft and juicy it melts in mouth. And,most importantly they serve good quantity of mutton,unlike Dadaboudi. This one is to indulge taste buds to fall in love more and more for Biriyani.

Other items in menu card is as usual, negative points for this.

Ambience is good,interior is good,Staffs are well mannered. Chairs and tables should be of better quality.

Recent visit: pan fried fish and assorted chicken kebab-both were very tasty.

Hayat is one of new dinning out place in Barrackpore and they serve yummy Indian dishes. Probably they offer best biriyani in this suburb area beating the legendary Dada Boudi's. Their mutton rogan joos and other mutton items are too good with the tastebuds. They serve chinese also, but these are just good!

Located near the Barrackpore station, and on the S.N. Banerjee Road, opposite to Sukanta Sadan it's a small place with nice ambience and heavenly yummy food. Price wise it's pocket friendly too.

This place give the best and foremost rolls within the Barrackpore area and the quality of food is way too much better than the other competitors in the present market. Rolls will cost you same in this place when compared to street food. So why take a risk on your health when you can enjoy the same food at the same price in a better place..? Ciao and Gracias

The ambience was OK sort of... Just now had biriyani @ hayat... Me & my brother visited today. I must say the service was really poor, in fact awful. My brother ordered egg biriyani, as he preferred not to have chicken or mutton, and the first reply from the Waiter was that they can't serve it right now.. Ok fine. On asking the reason behind it, they said that they don't serve egg biriyani(though it was there in the menu card) as it'll take 15mins to boil the egg and then only they can serve it so it becomes very hectic for them, so they don't serve...  F**k man, this is first time m hearing such stuff from a hotel waiter... Awful!!!!!!!

Coming to the food:it was awesome.the first bite just blew me off.for appetizers we ordered chicken reshmi kabab.it was nice soft and silky.For the main course I ordered chicken achari and chicken kashmiri.achari chicken was delicious and the ingredients could be easily tasted..it felt awesome.the chicken was tender and spicy.kashmiri chicken was good and tasty too..
Atlthough the staff was a bit buggy.they kept coming again and again I the food was okay..but its a new restaurant so It can be excused.food prices are very reasonable.enjoy this once for sure

This is newest addition to Barrackpore's food map. It is a very small place in area,so it has been made into 3 floors to make some space.Per floor, there is around 30 seats.
Ambiance - the minus point is we have to climb stairs to get a seat, so this is a problem for the elderly. The ambiance is nice, though a bit space crumped
Hospitality - The waiters tried their best but the fact that they were ineficient was very evident. For example they served chicken tandoori to someone's plate and in the other person's plate just gave some salad
Food - The kebaab section was not good. Both the tandoori chicken and chicken tikka was dry and not good
In comparison the Chinese section was better
The mixed hakka noddles was delicious and the manchurian chicken , though very spicy, was tasty
Final verdict - a good place to have Chinese
