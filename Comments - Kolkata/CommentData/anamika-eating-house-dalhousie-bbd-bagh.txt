A small eatery close to BBD Bag Square. This place sells casual dishes during day time. You will find all rice items.
And in the evening this place runs mostly for Rolls and other Chinese dishes mainly Chowmine. I visited here a few time for Rolls and Chowmine. Food quality is average here, don't expect much high fi Street food. Prices are low.

Heard and read much about Kolkata's PICE Hotels and wanted to experience it before leaving from Kolkata.
Visited this place and it was a small joint with around 30 people capacity. Place was adequately lit and I assumed there was a mezzanine floor as well.
Eating house was 90% full as I visited during office hours and this place is just near the court. Cleanliness was maintained so was the service. Service was quick and I could see orders flowing in as quickly within a minute. One server was running with bowl of Rice and other with Dal etc. I asked for Rui Thali and Alu Bhaja.Â 
Quantity:
The rui thali came in with wholesome portion of rice, 1 bowl dal, 1 small portion of aloo baingan veg and one rui fish piece of 3" x 2" x 1" with gravy. Plus additional portion of Aloo Bhaja.
Quality:
Rice was thick grained rice, cooked well but colour seems to be dull white. In Aloo baingan the propotion of baigan was not in comparison to aloo. Taste was good. Dal was very thin so was the broth of Rui. Taste was just OK.
Price: Everything was summed up to Rs 58/- I was stunned by the price point.
Overall I was satisfied in the sense that in todays time we can get our hunger filled with a complete meal ( non veg ) under 50/- plus I got a sense of achievement that I have visited a low cost operating model eatery which is a legacy of Kolkata's heritage.
I leave upto you to decide to visit a place which is just light on you wallet at the same time on your belly.
