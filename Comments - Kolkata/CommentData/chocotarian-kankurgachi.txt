One of the best bakers in town. From Brookie logs to cakes everything is superb. Tremendous hardwork and finesse can be seen in the quality of the products and the presentation of the cake. Looking forward to making many more sweet memories with Chocotarian cakes.

I don't know about the cakes, but I would love to give you negative ratings for unprofessional behaviour over phone . First you should listen to your customer than you can disconnect the call.

Since long was wanting to order the cake from Chocotarian and finally was able to order the super yummy delicious ferrero rocher cake for one of our special guest from US. I must say the cake was super yum , perfect in taste and even in sugar content . Each and every individual who tasted the cake loved it completely and even asked from where have u ordered the cake from even we would love to order. Thank you Surbhi waiting for next birthday in the family to order again...thank you once again.

Heard that Kolkata has great bakeries and after having these chocolate whoopie pies i was sure that the statement is absolutely Correct..
Being 100% vegetarian products make these more special and Miss Surbhi Jain puts a lot of heart in baking these so a big 👍🏻 😁😁

Imagine being the birthday girl, I didnt even get a proper slice of cake to eat and it got finished in fraction of seconds..love the taste n most importantly all my dadi's nani's could eat the cake as it was home made ... eggless... delicious... mouthwatering ... thank you chocotarian u guys just added in making my day all the more special...😘😘😍😍😍🎂🎂🎂 keep baking ... long way to go.
