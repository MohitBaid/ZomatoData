Today we ordered chicken reshmi butter masala and chili pepper chicken. Both the dishes are very nice and not very rich & oily. Full marks to this restaurant.

Food quality is excellent. The kashmiri pulao and mutton kasha that we ordered was finger-licking good. I am definitely gonna order from this place again.

Too good food, nice ambience for small parties and treat, For its food taste i visit here often. Cozy and comfortable for all age people. Momos are best in kolkata, so filling, kids also like the food from here. Chinese and indian food both are first and foremost verymuch pocket friendly as per its quantity and quality.

We ordered a home delivery,we need only veg items that day...so we were searching for veg items.Their menu is very very less,no varieties.So,we ordered burnt garlic veg fried rice and chilli garlic veg hakka noodles.We were searching for mushroom items, there's no mushroom items in their menu list.But whatever we ordered was in time,and really very tasty.The quantity is also good.Very less spicy and good taste.

Burn chillies is both a dine in & takeaway restaurant in garia area near hindustan more. The place is comparatively new amongst the many new outlets being popping up in this area. Yesterday for dinner i availed the services of swiggy to deliver my food from this outlet.

I had the following items:-

1. Chicken hariyali kebab - 6 pcs of tender kebabs coated in spicy pudina chutney. The kebabs were really drool worthy. The kebabs were really spicy due to the fact that they coated the pudina chutney over chicken tikka kebabs. However my cons of the dish were the excess presence of oil & inconsistent charring of the kebabs. Condiments of onion salad & pudina chutney were provided with the dish.

2. Chicken burnt garlic chowmein - Plain noodles with generous amounts of chopped veggies and chicken with chopped burnt garlic. Tastewise the dish was good with no soggyness of oil. The quantity was okayish which would suffice a single person.

3. Chicken in oyster sauce - 8pcs of succulent chicken dipped in thick oyster sauce. The chicken had no batter on it which was a positive. The oyster gravy was also well made. Had no complaints with the dish.

This place offers decent food at affordable prices. However there is room for improvement and consistency should be maintained.

This is a new place and I have been here quite a number of times. This place serves quality chinese food at a pocket friendly price. It has a limited seating capacity as the place is small. I have mostly opted for a takeout.
The service and the ambience is pretty good. The decor of the place was really good. Coming to the food the burnt garlic and the hakka noodles are plain awesome.  The chicken hot garlic and chicken manchurian are aslo good.
To sum up this is a pretty decent place. All chinese lovers should give this place a visit.

Visited this place today for the first time.This place has extended itself now,seating option is available now.We ordered Chicken Hakka Noodle and Chicken Manchurian.The service was prompt and the quantity was fair.Food was tasty too.Overall experience is good but 2things I would like to point out:
1)The interior of the resturant can be much better.It looks like a cafe and does not match with the cuisines they serve.
2)There is no proper car parking in front of the resturant.We really had a hard time finding a proper parking spot.
Apart from these 2things,everything is fine and would like to visit again.

Ordered food from here sometime back. Nice, easy-on-the-pocket restaurant. The place is very close to my house and the food is decent. We had ordered chicken reshmi kebab and crispy chilli baby corn. The baby corn was really good but the chicken reshmi kebab was not up to the mark.
