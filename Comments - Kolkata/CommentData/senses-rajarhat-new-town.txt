The food is great. The chicken is fresh, soft and succulent. The paneer tikka masala is fantastic! The staff is courteous and friendly. Also, the price is reasonable.

We ordered Biryani and it was pathetic. Delivery time is also quite long. Absolutely not a first choice to order food if other options are available.

Tried North Indian food. Fresh and hot servings(especially kulchas). Very courteous staff. Reasonable prices. Location might beat its positive financials.

Located in a small govt.  Market hidden from any prime location in new town. Small yet beautiful ambience with an open kitchen. Kebabs and curries are a must try delicacies. A recommended restaurant for Indian food lovers. Wide choice of vegetarian items also on the menu which is a rare sight.

One of the best place around here to have Indian and Tandoori.. Their gravy items are undoubtedly the best. Both fish and chicken dishes taste awesome.. Love to visit them again and again.

Disgusting attitude of manager and staffs.
Owner need to work on this else it's a disaster. They don't care about customers, they just want to shut down the store and go home. If you are in business then focus on it else get lost.

Finest and authentic kebabs, authentic Lakhnavi Biryani are their signature dishes. Chinese is good but could have been better. Mr. Mishra, the owner, is a very knowledgeable person with international exposure and vast experience on foods and restaurant business. Price is very low compared to the quality.

What else can you expect when the chefs here are from Kellinworth. The kebabs are a must try specially the lasuni ones. This place makes the best Crispy Chilli baby corn in this part of the city. The prices are rather cheap too. The sitting arrangements are a bit odd. So I would recommend take aways.

If u are looking for a quality food within a budget this is a place for u.
Well maintained interiors nice and comfortable seating arrangements and above all decently deigined menu.
Do try there tandoori and starters u will love it.

Helpful staff and quite atmosphere make sen5es as a very good option for family outing.

They also serve for online ordering 

My suggestion to the management please add discounts on online ordering

They do false advertisement on zomato. They do not serve what they write and the staff does not even know about the offers mentioned on zomato. They were like,"What offers sir?" and after we told them, they told us,"Those offers will be starting but we do not know when!"
Food is not that tasty. We ordered chilli chicken which was very sweet, there was no chilliness in it and the greavy was almost sauce.

Came here for a light meal...but order dinner for the family.  The food was really that good. 
We order a hakka noodle. It is a simple thing to cook but you could get it wrong so easily. At Sen5es ( thats is 5 senses i guess), it was done simple and comforting. After all a Sunday evening snack is not demanding 'art' food , but it is important as it set the mood for the evening to follow. And i might add, we are looking forward to our dinner.
We had
1) Mix hakka chow for the snack
2) Ordered Gravy Chow and dry chilli chicken for dinner

Its a newly opened place in new town. We were searching for a restaurant near axis mall and zomato provided us with this fresh one in town. It was hard to find as there were no banners in front of the market inside which the restaurant is located. So We hovered here and there a bit.

Pros- food quality specially the kababs, they were indeed sumptuous and delectable. ( although did not found the ch. munchurian to be impressive enough) , The nice decor, reasonable price, cordial staff

Cons - this place needs another ac or has to implement other mechanisms for proper ventilation. Since it has an open kitchen the room temperature keeps on rising and a single ac is not enough to cool the place.it was indeed uncomfortable with all the heat coming from the kitchen.
Since it has an open kitchen , it has to be kept in a much more organized manner with fancy utensils.

This place is perfect as a cafe but for dining it falls short as it is indeed a small joint with limited seating and the seats n tables are not much comfortable enough.

Its a small hangout place in the NKDA CB block market area(Close to Sankalpa 3/4). Trust me, Dont judge the restaurant by its size. It serves lip smacking Indo chineese . The Chicken Fried rice is a must try. Their kababs are really good and succulent. ¬†I have never reviewed their continental dishes so really can;t comment on that. Their Indian dishes are Okay. While the curries are good, the Indian breads are disappointing.¬†

Thali review: One can't have it on a daily basis. Was disappointing,

Final Review:
Taste: 4/5
Ambience: 3/5 (little Low on space and lacks proper ventilation)
Staff: 4/5 (super friendly people.... I broke a plate and they sweetly changed it :))
Value for money: 3.5/5

Overall review ... Its a must try for their Indo chineese and Briyani rice.

We visited this eating joint recently. It is not a very big place but does have very nice ambience. They have open kitchen and you can see how the cooking is being done. Food was great and chef was eager to know our feedback.
