Zaikebaaz is like a frequent restaurant for me . It never disappoint​ me . Food is good with respect to it's price . Quantity is also quite good.  Thai rice ,chopsuey , Dry chilli mushrooms are must try . Home delivery is quick enough and they give special discount in zomato . It's a small place with large variety of food . Good behaviour , Pocket friendly cost ,Large options in menu, quick delivery ,enough quantity ,what else is required... So whenever you are not in a mood to cook and if your are staying around garia you can easily call them and ask for dry chilli mushroom and Thai non veg rice .

Ended up experimenting one more time. So yeah Zaikebaaz was the one.
Stationed at naktala this joint serves some good set of dishes. I preferred a take away. 
We ordered Pan Fried Noodles, butter garlic rice and kung pao chicken.
The food was filling. The quality and the quantity was pretty good. 
The chicken needs a bit of improvement. The outer coating is heavy. 
I would suggest em to work in the chicken dish a bit more. 
More or less and satisfied with the food in aspect of the pocket pinch i had bear. 
You can try this place out.

We ordered a veg halka chowmein aloo jeera and lachha paratha .We called up for a home delivery.The food was well packed it was steaming hot.But the aloo jeera looked less like aloo jeera because it had a lot of gravy in it and was spicy as well .Though the flavour was good indeed.The lachha paratha and chowmein both were good and was absolutely oil free unlike other food joints were we find oil dripping from dishes.Overall experience was good.I am giving 4 stars only for the absence of jeera in aloo jeera. :p

Often I order from zaikebaaz either by Zomato or the other delivery partner. The noodles in Schezwan style is good but the crispy conjee chicken been ordered is not upto the mark, as i guess the crispness disappears as it is packed in a box. Apart from that steam momo, dry chilly chicken is upto the mark.

I was looking for some cheap place to order chinese from without stepping out during my semester exams. This place serves wholesome platters at very low rates. I thought maybe the quantity wouldn't be ample but to my surprise it was more than enough for me. The quality may not be very great but at such cheap rates that's all you can hope for. My veg chinese platter consisted of Schezwan fried rice, chilly babycorn, vegetable Manchurian, some potato gravy kinda thing which wasn't that great. I was hoping for crispy chilli potatoes but these were different. Fried rice ,babycorn and manchurian was welk cooked and tasty. Sauce and some spicy salad are also in this platter. The food is packed very nicely,the delivery time is very quick. 
So if you are looking for some cheap junk without compromising with taste, do try ordering at Zaikebaaz. :)

Yesterday evening I ordered food from this restaurant through zomato. I am  utterly dissapointed with their delivery.The delivery boy couldn't locate my place even after repeated guidance.As a result food was delivered almost half an hour late than estimated time.Besides he wasn't carrying any change.That too posed problem.The food was not bad but packaging could have been better.not highly satisfied

Located just two stoppage away from my house. This joint offers the definition of ideal fast food. Starting from egg roll to Chinese delicacies all are fantastic. They have their unique way to serve their food. I have ordered several times from here every time they served without a single minute delay. Naktala people can rock with this joint. Happy dining 😊

First: Worst delivery service, yesterday I ordered through Zomato to this restaurant at 9.00pm they gave me an estimated time of 70min. to deliver and as usual I got the order at 11.05pm. I used the term "as usual" cuz this is not the first time I'm facing this. Second : I ordered butter chicken and Butter Naan.. Honestly the chicken is too good but there is 0% butter in that so called "Butter Naan". C'MON Zaikbaaz Why are you doing this? Feel the heat..there are lot of options available for us don't forget that! Atleast pick up our call ,you guys don't even pick our calls . Truly disappointed!

It's a take away joint opposite to Naktala post office. The menu is huge and it keeps growing almost every month. Some of the dishes are really nice, like Kadhai Chicken, Chicken Kohlapuri and Veg Jhalphrezi. Thai Veg Fried Rice is another surprise dish. Love the fresh flavor. But the biggest problem at this place is the consistency in taste. One day you order something and it's delicious. The next day you order the same thing and it spoils your appetite. Even the simple Rolls would taste different on different days. The huge size of the menu is the reason for the inconsistency, I guess. Food portion is also not up to the mark as it keeps getting smaller with rise in the price tag.

This is a takeaway joint located in Naktala. I have ordered food from Zaikebaaz through Zomato. They also have personal delivery service. We have ordered for Konjee crispy chicken which was really yummy in taste but the chicken strips were a bit chewy. In mains we had-
1) Egg wrapped fried rice ( the thumbs up part was the egg beautfully wrapped above the whole fried rice and the fried rice was also light and good in taste)

2) Chicken hakka noodles ( good in taste and not much oily)

3) Veg hakka noodles ( I liked this one over chicken hakka noodles because chicken chunks were a bit chewy but the taste was good)

4) Chicken Munchurian ( really great in taste)

5) Chilli chicken ( it was also good)

6) Hot garlic chicken ( It was okayish in taste. Not much worth trying)

Overall all the food items were good. Both quality and quantity at that price was good. Time taken for delivery was a bit long otherwise all good.

One of the worst delivery experiences in recent times. Placed a rather small order at 7.14pm. It is now 8.50pm, the order has not arrived yet. Everytime I call they have an excuse, including misleading the Zomato CCE. Rain, diwali all understandable, yet more than an hour is not. Absolute crap service. Let's see how the food turns out to be.
Order received. Noodles are hard and cold. Probably mixed chopsuey noodles with this. Worthless food joint and pathetic experience. Definite waste of money.

Another part about the delivery..i ordered at 6:57pm they shows 75mins to deliver..but i got the food at 9:20pm..first time the delivery guy came with an empty bag and told me to wait for 5-10mins within this time he will deliver..but it was near about 30mins when i got the food finally.
Personally i feel I won't order any food from this restaurant though i got the full refund.
And thank you for the refund to the authority of the restaurant.

The rice content is less, should be a little more according to the price.
Or either you should lessen the price @150

This is a Chinese and North Indian joint which only provides home delivery. I have ordered several times from this joint. Chicken tikka kebab, butter naan, chicken bharta are my favourites from their North Indian menu. Kung Pao chicken, hot garlic noodles, dry chili chicken and sweet and sour chicken are my Chinese favourites from this joint. The food is delicious, portions are huge, price is dirt cheap, service is good and delivers in a very short time. Must try.

The entire thing was okay. The good thing was that the food was delivered before the estimated time. And the taste as I said was okay. But definitely it could have been much better. It did not disappoint me; perhaps because of the fact that I did not have high expectations. And I should mention the concern of the restaurant authority regarding customer satisfaction.

Zaikebaaz serves classy North Indian dishes. The Kashmiri pulao is garnished with Indian cherries and pineapple cubes, this brings out the true Kashmiri flavour. 
The smokey chicken kebabs and tandoori chicken add an extra zeal to your tongue. 
This food joint will give you good quantity noodles and rice, which is enough for a foodie like me. 
I'll update this review everytime I taste something new from here.

I have home deliveries from here on three occasions.

Their veg fried rice is very good. I loved it. It was non oily. The rice had a lemony aroma.

The fish sezwan was yet another dish which I loved. The fish fillets were soft and juicy.

The meifoon didn't make me a good fan. Not at par.

The chicken tandoori was average but good. I liked it.

The reshmi chicken butter masala was again on the average not.

The parathas were good.

Got some indian food delivered last week from Zaikebaaz : Tandoori rotis , chicken reshmi butter masala and bharta. The food was tasty enough and my friends loved the gravies in particular , however the chicken in reshmi masala should have been boiled more , hence the score. Packaging was satisfactory for food priced reasonably. Would like to explore more :)

This is a home delivery place . A  great place near my residence and that just makes me feel so privileged.
The food is new ,different and definitely tasty .
The starters would remind me of
Chicken afghani
Mutton chatpata
The main course would put me on the edge especially with the likes of

Mutton shahi korma
Chicken kolapuri .
A lot more to taste .these would be my recommendation .
The presentation  is out of world and definitely a budget restaurant with great food .

Worst food. I ordered dahi chicken, mutton do pyaza and garlic nun through Zomato. The service was prompt but the quality of food was below average. Smelled rotten and moreover mutton do pyaza didn't have a single piece of mutton. Only gravy. However it was sweet of them to provide me the same order again after apologizing. This time the food quality was great.

We have ordered kadai paneer & garlic naan..
Pros:

Delivery was on time
Packaging was close to perfect
Quantity was decent
Pocket friendly

Cons:
With lots of disappointment I have to say the food was not at all up to the mark.. Garlic naan was like parathas with hardly any garlic or flavors of coriander leaves on it.. Coming to kadai paneer, it was full of thick yellow gravy with very few or no pieces of diced capsicum , onions and red dry chilli. The main usp of any kadai item is the mesmerizing aroma of Roasted masala mainly with coriander seeds and other spices giving a nice aromatic flavor into the dish, which the dish lacked completely rather it was bland..
I have seen your so many on going ad campaigns, one request before delivering such kind of food to the customers kindly work for its quality improvement..
Hope you serve better next time for hungry people..
Good luck👍

I was over enthusiastic since this was my 1st online food order..And the delivery was done in a twinkling of an eye, within 30 minutes. 
The Chicken Reshmi Kabab was really really delicious, and I am saying this keeping in mind the variations in the same dish in few other top restaurants in Kolkata.
However, the Afghani Chicken resembled the Chicken piece in a Biriyani, and I had expected something more than that. 
The salad sufficed. On a last note, i would suggest that the chutney could have been sweeter. 
Nevertheless, the taste and timely delivery exceeds the cons and hence, I would surely recommend Zaikebaaz to anyone, who likes tandoori dishes.

The quantity is very less as compared to other restaurants. The quantity they are providing is of street food quality but the price they are charging are of good restaurants. Very disappointed. Ordered a chicken pasinda in shredded chicken. They delivered it in a transparent container which weighs only 250ml and charging Rs 150 for that. When given a call back they misbehaved and spoke very adamantly. Will never ever order food from here and will not recommend this food joint to anybody.

The fried rice was okayish. The asian chilly chicken was spicy and yum. The babycorn was good and crispy. The fish was fresh and light. The kimchi salad could be better.
But the food was more than satisfactory.

This place is one of the best places to order food from, though i live in garia but whenever i come to Naktala at my friends place we always order from here and till date this place has never let us down. Recently i noticed they have even launched combos which i am dying to try. Keep up the good job team Zaikebaaz

Very bad management. Food quality is also not good. Not worth the money spent. Even missed to deliver the main dish ordered online for home delivery and when contacted about the replacement the person who picked up the call requested me to compromise and adjust without the main dish I ordered , because it was too late. Well they delivered the order to me at 11:30 PM night. I ordered at 9:30 PM. I called them at 12:00 in the night just 30 minutes after they themselves delivered it so late. I am not going to buy from them any more. Above all the quality is just run of the mill like footpath food vendors.

A request to the Zaikebaaz team please launch some combos for your customers it will be highly helpful to us. Keep up the good job team Ziakebaaz

Today we had a horrible experience with the food of Zaikebaaz...Ordered tandoori roti, Chicken Tikka Masala and Dal Makhani and strictly told not to make it spicy with chillis. They poured chillis like hell in the dal makhani. Never ever will have from here again... Horrible service and food ...

Tried their online menu.
Service was prompt
Quantities enough for 2
But the food itself was a very sorry affair
Tried their hot garlic chicken and non veg hakka noodles. The chicken had a thick gravy, that was too hot for my liking, not an altogether pleasing experience, and the noodles were nothing better than that available from street food stalls, maybe worse even. Keeping in mind that both the items came from their recommended menu, I can only imagine what the other items would be like. Absolutely not recommended.

Ordered several times from home..cordial behavior..service is good..food is delicious..and the most important of all price is very reasonable,doesn't burn a hole in the pocket.
Love their Non-veg rice noodles(although rice noodles takes time to be ready,but worth the wait);Chicken and Mushroom Fried Rice;Drums of heaven ;Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken;Hot Garlic chicken, are some of my family favorites.

Ordered from Home. It is a small take away food centre at Naktala. I ordered Chicken Do Pyaza, Butter Nun, Plain Nun and Laccha Paratha.
Chicken Item was good but it can be better!
Bread items were soft enough but I didn't like the Laccha Paratha, it was supposed to be softer!
Delivery time was in time and packing was good!

It's a small takeaway center...we have tasted their rolls which was good,but some days ago we ordered roti and one chicken item through Zomato , I couldn't remember the name of the item of the chicken which was not good at all,tandoori roti was so hard and chicken pieces were worst and I think it was not fresh,tasted and smelling like old frozen meat may be it was becoming rotten & after eating those food we were not feeling well and the very next day our stomach got upset... actually we ordered from there because we were hungry,it was late night and we thought it will come fast as it's near to our residence...anyways,we never gonna order from there...very unexpected and worst experience I had.

If I had a optn I wld hav given 0 rating..
It was my anniversary,so I trusted zomato and considered this Zaikebaaz....I have ordered fish t
andoori,fish tandoor butter masala,sheek kabab,peas pulao and prawn items...

Fishes were firstly coated with flour in fish tandoori items(surprised) and God knows it taste like horrible..like Kaunsa jamaneka fish de diya..wohi hi Jaane...pulao was too oily like roadside restro..

Prawns r only visible through binacular only in the mud f flour ball..which is served as chilli prawn.

Sheek kababs r just bought one from arambagh ready to cook meals (u can get it from Benjy's chicken also) and fried.

Overall lost the mood...

Zomato should judge twice before tying up with this sort of roadside restro..

I HV spent almost 1k rupees for this...but value wise in terms f quantity,quality mushkil ke lagta hai 200 rupaya bhi ye log kharcha nahi kiya..

Zomato able ban this

Zaikebaaz is situated in Naktala Area near Naktala Post Office. They serve North Indian, Mughlai and Indo-Chinese cuisine. I had not personally visited it. However, the owner Siddharth messaged me few years back to try his food which had gone in my filtered request messages on Facebook. However, i was checking it yesterday and saw many invites which i had missed out on. I wanted to go and try and as Zaikebaaz is not in close proximity, he insisted on sending the food items at my home.

Exceptional Chicken Reshmi Kebabs. Tikka kebabs are a little too fiery, Tangdi kebab is avoidable and so is the chicken bharta. The staff is proactive which is what probably works the most for the restaurant. Ok for last minute dinner takeaways.

Not so far from my residence, I placed order for the first time a few.days back... Though the estimated time of delivery was one hour, the food got delivered within 40 minutes. The price is very reasonable, undoubtedly the cheapest Chicken Tandoori in the area. At the same time, quality was not compromised... The KaDhai Chicken was also very nicely prepared. The Tandoori Paratha were a bit heavy though and I could manage only one. Overall, quite a good experience. I would definitely try here in future and recommend my friends too :-)

Pros: 10 minutes walk from my home.
Cons: 
a) it took 20 mins to give me pan fried momo. Its a take away so after reaching home I understand that its hardly fried.
b) it is small outlet bt almost 9 people was working inside. Workers are frequently going out and coming in, and some of them are chewing something food or gum, don't know. So hygiene is the concern.

I was standing there 20 minutes so noticed many things. I'm not a regular but so many people within that kitchen, and since you are in zomato. The owner should consider it.

Quantity of the food as expected, but the taste of the fried rice was bland...inspite of being chilli garlic flavored and the preparation of dragon chicken was done in a stir-fry mode which I guess is good to be savoured right from the wok...so it did not work out well....have to try other dishes later

Tandoor is always a fav to me..and having it with half price than the top mughlai places is something you can't stay away from it. Such an offer is made by Zaikebaaz..I have ordered a home delivery seeing such a cheap price. Chicken tengri kabab and chicken tandoor. Well as you can see from the above rating..first of all the delivery service is a little poor. They promised to give the delivery within 45 mins but took 1hr 45 mins..Coming to the food part. The food was average..not so yummy..but when you are hungry  and less money..it will be a good try..The tengry kabab needs to be more tendered and the tandoory chicken should added a little taste..salt and peper has to be a little bit more..The pudina chatni was very bad..Over all an average rating would suit this restaurant..taste may vary..!!

Pros:
1. Good prompt service. 
2. Very reasonable price. 
3. Quantity is really good.

Cons:
1. Freshness of food. Salad was not fresh (except Tomato) at all. We had to dump entire plate of green salad. 
2. Professionalism. They missed to deliver reshmi kabab along with other dishes. After informing the same over call they again delivered the kabab. I appreciate that, but it is always a good practice to count the item before dispatching the order.
3. Quality of food. Reshmi kabab was too bad. It was too salty and not soft at all.

Ordered some prawn rice and baby corn chicken. The quantity was pretty good, and the quality was also decent. The baby corn chicken was in that white gravy, I would actually love to eat that in the soya sauce gravy. The prawn rice was 10 on 10. Decent pricing too. And overall the packaging was also good. Keep up the good work.

I mostly get food delivered from this place. The food is so good and it gets delivered smoothly. Everyone should try the mixed panfried noodles and chilly honey chicken wings. More over they have half plates for some dishes as well so its really easy to get food from here.... the quantity for full plates is okay but the taste of the food is so good that i mostly dont care about quantity. The restaurant is cheap as well.

Zomato should go through rounds of bgc before putting some in list. Its a below average snacks corner .. somehow using zomato platform. Food quality and quantity isn't satisfactory , then their service. Whats the point of keeping entire south in your delivery zone if you cant deliver properly.The good thing is I realised anyone could do business using zomato , even I'm planning so.

Well I ordered home delivery from Zaikebaaz and it usually came late as my house is quiet a distant place from the shop. I ordered Chocken Reshmi Kebab, Fried Rice and Chilli Chicken. They were packed nicely and the food was delicious. I didnt like the Chicken Reshmi Kebab though it was difficult to chew so hard. I think the chicken was not fresh. Although The Rice and the side dish chilli chicken was really well cooked in less oil and was fantastic.The raita was very good too.  Would recommend this place to everyone for Diwali. Definitely order food from here.

The strong point of this place is their kebabs which they do really well. And with their prices, there are few other places which can surpass it in terms of value for money. Their Indian main course dishes are also quite good but can be too spicy and overwhelming at times. If they tone down the oil and spices a little bit they can do a lot better. Their Chinese dishes are bit of a hit and miss and mostly not that good. I will highly recommend this place simply for their delightfully tasty and optimally priced kebabs which are a great bang for the buck.

After waiting a long 45 min for a veg manchurian noodles, mixed schezwan noodles n garlic chicken...i found i had entirely WASTED my time n money...the Puja rush had pruned their menu and customers had to be satisfied with the few items the outlet chose to provide. Even after that, the schezwan noodles was a plain noodles with NO SALT(no schezwan flavour as well)...even the chicken n prawns were just boiled without any SALT..n some pieces even tasted sour....even the other dishes i ordered turned out to be as BAD...i had some good experiences from the restaurant in the past which fell flat on its face today n i decided NOT to try venturing from their menu card anymore...EXTREMELY HORRIFYING FOOD EXPERIENCE!!!!!

Today was one of those rainy days, where you fell like having some hot and mouth watering foods but lazy enough to spent the entire evening in the couch with a hot cup of coffee. The laziness was covered but the sudden apatite for hot and spicy food needed to be answered ASAP and so Zomato.

 I found this place under the best delivery only places in kolkata and made an order for :-

Mixed Panfried Noodles,

 Tandoori Roti,

 Chilli Honey Chicken, 

Boneless Shredded Chicken Bharta .

                                                                                 CONS

1st.  I was supposed to receive the delivery at 7.40 pm but got it at 8pm, no big-deal, it happens.

2nd. I ordered a Mixed Pan-fried Noodles but instead i received a container that contained a gravy (made of cabbage, capsicum, bits and pieces of egg, chicken and prawn, which for some odd reason i thought to be a complimentary soup)  and in a separate container semi-fried dry and weirdly crispy noodles.  It took me some time to figure out that i have received gravy noodles.

3rd. Tandoori Roti, i think Zaikebaaz has an U.S.P. when it comes to their Tandoori Roti. They have invented a special formula to strengthen your jaws because that is what you develop when you chew a piece of leather for minutes.

4th. Chilli Honey Chicken.  ( On a hot summer day your walking through Thar desert bare foot and you see a jug full of cold sweet lasi. You run towards it like those zombies of "I AM LEGEND" trying to eat Will Smith, and when you eventually start drinking it but in the middle you find out that in reality its a jug full of white wash which is burning your mouth and everything, is the feeling i had when i was having this  "Chilli Honey Chicken".)

5th.  Boneless Shredded Chicken Bharta is synonym of boiled rubber pieces.

                                                                                 PROS

1st.  Could Not Find Any.

2nd.  I will use an electron microscope second time to find some.

I ordered a plate of steamed rice, one plate of chicken kasha and green salad. There are a few number of reasons behind  this rating. Where to start? Ok fine, lets start with the delivery person. He just refused to pay me the change and it was of Rs. 10 and gave me the reason that he didn't have the balance!!! How poor behaviour it was!. I just can't imagine. Secondly I asked them about the steamed rice and they told me that its deradoon rice. But it was made with ordinary rice. Lastly it was not the chicken kasha.The taste was very poor. And I am completely disappointed.

A takeaway food joint at Naktala which serves tasty food . I have been here quite a few times. The only complain I have from this joint is that they add too much of oil to the food. The rolls were amazing and delicious ,but again very sticky due to the feel of Dalda. Same with side dishes like chicken bharta. I'd like to request them to stop adding so much oil to their food otherwise it should have been a 5/5 rating!

These guys serve better quality food than other restaurants nearby. They use fresh ingredients and you can blindly go for their Chinese items, I think they are best at it, but the Mughal cuisine here is also no way less than that. Quantity is sufficient for 2 adult people in 1 plate. Overall it is a lovely place for Foodies and may not take a huge toll on your pocket.

This is the worst food joint I have ever been to. We ordered Chicken Chatpata, Chicken Kadai and Tandoori Roti yesterday. As per them, Chicken Chatpata would have small chunks of boneless chicken, but trust me all the pieces were just chicken lever and the cartilage areas. None of the piece were solid boneless chicken. In Chicken Kadai, the 4 pieces they gave are the left over pieces which can be bought for the pets. Taste of both the chicken dishes were same and that was also not at all good. The Capsicum was uncooked, raw masala taste. Very bad experience. Will not recommend this food joint to anyone. If you cannot make food tasty that's still understood, but giving the left over pieces for 120 / 130 Rs. is not at all acceptable.

Also had their chicken rolls which was above average. 
Fast delivery and affordable food.

A takeaway joint, also does home deliveries, got delivered from this place couple of times as its in near vicinity to my place. Normally starters are good at zaikebaaz like rolls, kebabs and in oriental drums of heaven, mushroom, corn dishes are lip smaking!
Although yesterday took a delivery of mixed fried rice which was cooked enough, had enough chunks of non veg but somewhat lacked in flavor. So i would not comment much on mains as i did not like their fried rice. But the starters are good and very affordable for days when your mom refuses to go to kitchen! 😁
Well this is been in my swiggy top 3 list, it has amazed me with its food and taste in Indian cuisine. In naktala area this would be the best option for mughlai paranthas, tandoori roti, naan, chicken bhartas, reshmi kebabs, tandoori chicken. The munt chutney and salad portions are equally great! Hence I increase my rating after their repeated marvelous food deliveries.

The best place for takeaway/home delivery in the area if you are planning not to burn a deep hole in your pocket.
      Living close by, we are regular customers of this place. Their delivery is pretty fast and prompt. I only saw this place with my own eyes 2 days back so i would not recommend a dine-in.
       We have sampled pretty much everything on their menu and i would only like to vouch for my favourites here. Go for the hakka chowmein. They make a mouth-watering job of it. The momos (fried/steamed/pan-fried) are the item for you on a lonely evening when you are looking for a quick fix. Their biriyani too is great and would put some of their neighbors to shame. On the side you could go for their Garlic chicken.
      Their portion size is big so order carefully.

As for today we ordered the Chicken Tikka Kebab Roll..... It was really good. The kebabs were succulent and loved the taste overall .

We had also tried their online ordering through Zomato and you will be surrised at how fast they deliver , if u are in the vicinity of course. So keep visiting, keep ordering

The owner Mr. Siddharth is a very well spoken person over phone (As I alaways ordered home delivery from there). I have ordered several times from them via Zomato or other Apps but they never failed the estmated delivery time. So be assured to get the food when it is required to you. Also they never charge for the container which is a really rare in these days.

A small place by the corner of a lane. If you want to order take away from here its suggested that you order before hand as it takes a lot of time to get the food ready.
On the other hand the food is pretty good. The chicken chow is good and has plenty of chicken and the quantity is quite good. The oyster chicken is good slightly on the salty side. The quantity is decent and taste is good.
The chicken momo sizes are big and filled with chicken with a slight hint of pepper giving it a good taste. Its served with some good soup. Another thing to try is the chilly honey lollipop. Which is very good. The lollipops are big and succulent. The spiciness compliments the sweet taste of the honey. The garlic finally adds the magic by enhancing the taste further and spreading a lovely aroma.

First things first - Thank you Zaikebaaz for your courtesy, prompt services and delicious food.

Placed an order of Chicken Reshmi Kebab & Chicken Tikka Kebab this evening and although initially the order was misplaced, they cancelled it and re-took the order on asking, without any hassle. Delivery was quick and I have to agree Rajib (the delivery personnel) with his cordiality sets a good vibe on behalf of the food joint. 

Coming to food - Tikka Kebabs were tender, juicy and delicious. Reshmi Kebab was simply splendid. Its a steal for the price. Perfectly done, very tasty and left me craving for more! Salad provided as a condiment was fresh and plentiful. The only complaint that I have is regarding the sauce (chutney) served along with the kebabs. Whether it is just accidentally not up to the mark today or otherwise, it had a mildly pungent taste. It's a regular condiment and I would humbly ask Zaikebaaz to ensure they don't dishearten with something so basic after raising our hopes with the amazing food. However, the quality and quantity both were great & I'm definitely going to try the other dishes too! 

Keep it up guys!

Well this was my first run in with this restaurant and, being skeptical at first, it was a pleasant surprise to see that this restaurant actually delivered what it promised. I ordered about six items and each one of those items where up to the mark. The only area this Establishment can improve is it's service speed. Otherwise, good quality food at budget price, great quantity and surprisingly light food. Good restaurant, great restaurant

Service time is excellent since its mostly a take away joint. Thanks guyss for satisfying my hunger. Specially the guy who delivers my orders since he had met with an accident but never left behind his effort of serving us better. Hats off and i wish him a speedy recovery.. Today i ordered #Chicken_butter_masala (cooked in tandoor pieces), #lachha_tandoori and #salad

The taste of the food is good.Usually i eat chicken & egg rolls in this restaurant.But their dishes are also good in taste.
The kitchen looks unhygienic. 
Overall its a good restaurant with cheap price but good taste.

Placed an order yesterday through Zomato only. The order got delivered within the defined timelines. Thanks to the delivery personnel Rajib! Rajib was very very cordial and can guess that the staffs there at the outlet will be courteous too. Mixed Hakka Noodles and Mixed Chilly Garlic Fried Rice that we ordered had ample bits of chicken, fried eggs and shrimps. I felt the noodles to be little thick than usual and they can try serving a little thinner quality of noodles, not like rice noodles but still a little thinner than what they serve now. The chicken pieces in Chilly Chicken Gravy were succulent and well prepared. Quantity they provide is worth praising too. They should work hard to maintain this standard in future. Will love to place an order again soon.

What we ordered - Chilly Chicken Gravy, Mixed Hakka Noodles, Mixed Chilly Garlic Fried Rice, Shredded Chicken in Oyster Sauce 

DELIVERY TIME - 4.5/5
FOOD QUALITY - 3.5/5
QUANTITY - 4/5
HYGIENE - 3.5/5
VALUE FOR MONEY - 4/5

I do not know about the food, deplorable home delivery service. I ordered at 11.50 am and was told that the delivery boy would call to ask my address and then come. Waited till 2 o clock, no call. Then when I called, again I was told that the delivery boy would call. I have cancelled the order. There is no surety of delivery at all. I understand it is raining a bit, but these people do not have the sense to inform the customer.

A very popular food joint in Naktala area Zaikebaaz is quite a popular one.

I had their momos which I really liked. 
Also to mention the Chinese items are better than others. 
Singapore rice 
Szechwan Chicken
Also to mention the American Chopsuey is one of the delicious ones. Loved it...

Ordered for home delivery for the first time from this food joint after going through the mixed reviews. However, most of the reviews I went through were regarding the chinese dishes. Thought I should try ordering some North Indian dishes so that I can write about it as referrence . My order was pretty simple.. Peas Polau(2 plates) and Kadhai Chicken(1plate i.e. 4 pcs.).. They turned out to be very good as the chicken pieces were tender and big enough to suffice one plate of polau. One plate of peas polau and two pieces of kadhai chicken will make you happy enough. The peas polau was not oily at all so no problem for those suffering from acidity. Only the kadhai chicken was a bit too spicy and hot for me but that's okay. To draw the conclusion I would say that I will definitely order more from this joint to taste the other dishes as well and it is pocket friendly too.. Thumbs up to Zaikebaaz.. Keep serving good foods and I will keep ordering.

09.04.2016 - Ordered again from Zaikebaaz, which has become one of my favourites. This time thought I should try chinese since it has gained most of the reviews due to its chinese items. So my order was drums of heaven, mixed fried rice and kumpao chicken. The rice was of good quantity and quality, delivered in time, kumpao chicken was not at all spicy which was good and the best was drums of heaven which surely gave a heavenly feeling. The only request to zaikebaaz is that please increase the pieces of drums of heaven from 5 to 6 so that it becomes easier to share. 
Thanks for the awesome food .

This is a pretty average eatery when it comes to snacks.Ordered 2 starters on a lazy Sunday evening at a friend's house.The delivery was quite fast.

We ordered:-

Shanghai Chicken-The quantity is pretty good but the chicken pieces had more cornflour than chicken.Not only that,the batter was a bit stiff so it might have been old.It would taste better if they could actually make the chicken balls fresh.

Pepper Prawn-This was an utter disaster!!!It had very little shrimps and more cornflour and the flavor of the cornflour was predominant..The prawn balls were a bit hard to chew as it was overcooked..I would request them to improve the quality and reduce the quantity if needed..

It's a small take away joint, with excellent quality of food. Their pepper fish is to die for. They use Basa fish, which is awesome for a small joint like this. Their chilly garlic fried rice and Manchurian prawn are awesome. And another feather in the cap is their behavior, owners are extremely polite, and so is the staff. They can totally compete with many of the prominent Gariahat Chinese joints, so far the food is concerned.

They ruined a perfect afternoon which I had planned for my old parents.

Searched  through Foodpanda and placed online order around 12PM, got confirmation and paid online upfront. Anticipated delivery time 13.30HRS.

Ordered Egg and Mutton dishes.Someone from restaurant calls an hour later and informs no mutton available -they can give chicken instead. I protested saying you should ve let me know while I was placing the order in the beginning. They hung up saying they will get back to me.

Its 5PM and I call to check with my parents if order was delivered,but to my disappointment,not only they had not delivered, but also not bothered to inform.
It compeltely destroyed the plans I had for my folks.

On calling the restaurant, one Mr.A Bhadra, argued that we told you no mutton was available and we called  - where as I did not recevive a single missed call in the last 4 hours!

Very very shameful professionalism and such a poor atitude.Forget apologising, they showed nonchalance and feigned ignorance! They should be blacklisted and removed from your listings for such sloppy service.

Not to mention ,this take away joint has every potential to catch the taste buds in case they give away with the fellow taking the order.He is pathetic!!!

I am more or less a regular customer at Zaikebaaz... The food is immensely good and the staff are also quite friendly... They have a wide variety of items to offer - from moghlai to chinese to tandoor - all of these at quite pocket friendly prices... and if something you want isn't on the menu, they will do their utmost best to serve you the dish... If they would just open a restaurant, it's a guarantee they will become even more successful than they already are...

Well yes its a 5*. The quality of food it offers and for the price it's best in this area. It quickly became our regular choice of ordering from FoodPanda for evening snacks and sidedish ehile partying. The quantity is great and due to coupons of FoodPanda, a order of 300/- (after applying coupons) its enough for for 5-6 foodies.

A quick take away counter. Famous for its rolls, moglais and kebabs. Food, tastes are good. But one thing is that you have to wait for a little long for food. Bad if you are in a vehicle as it is on the main road.

Ordered for the first time today and it was a great experience. Good food at reasonable prices. Finally found a takeaway place close to home, with food that is both value for money and delectable in taste.

One of the best place to have quality Chinese food in Naktala Area. They also help to customize the Chinese food for my lil one ( sometimes without chilly or Ajinamoto). Both Gravy and Hakka Noodles are real yummy and the quantity they serve easily satisfies 2 grown up people. The Indian dishes , though not all are tasted....are also tasty. The rolls are our every week weekend snack and starting from the eldest member of the family till my lil 5 yrs enjoys it. Chicken Moghlai Paratha is also nice as a heavy snack!!!! I love the food, their quantity and even delivery service even at 10.30-11 pm. Thanxxxxx Zaikabaaaazzzz!!!!!!

Tiny take away. Dont know why did they highlight dine in. Tried rolls, moghlai and chinese. All can satisfy you if you are terribly hungry and failed to find any other chinese restaurant within your budget. Heard their delivery service is quick.

Most worst service I have seen till date. Quality of food is also worst. They should improve the food quality and they should place a responsible staff who take the order properly.

I have ordered 3 times from them. They have failed to deliver within the promised time on two occasions. Repeated follow ups are needed to make them deliver the food. Absolutely exasperated! I would recommend not ordering from Zaikebaaz. Terrible terrible service!

I have ordered from Foodpanda today. Let me explain my experience. Firstly I found only one restaurant to deliver to my area. That is Zaikebaaz in Naktala. 

When I ordered, Foodpanda informed that they are denying delivery to my area stating it too far. My point is that if they deny duty to my area then why Foodpanda is showing it in my apps? And if the location I have selected is not pinpointing my exact location then it is the fault of Foodpanda. 

Nextly coming to the restaurant part, they told me to come halfway to collect it which I denied and went straightaway to the restaurant to collect it. They were happy and delivered the order. I came home and discovered that they provided me fried rice instead of Meifoon (Rice noodles). I don't know if they have mistaken or don't know what is Mei foon, 

This is my experience from ordering Foodpanda.

Yesterday I ordered home delivery from them (through foodpanda who BTW sucks)..first thing that I realised was their price is very less compared to quantity..they give quite good quantity.. We ordered crispy chili baby corn veg fried rice chicken schwezwan fried rice Manchurian chicken n chili garlic corn..n the total was only 510!!!..quantity of rice was superb.. Quality wise quite okay for everyday carvings.. Not extraordinary but then not bad either..crispy chili baby corn was not at all crispy but it tasted good and they gave a huge quantity.. Manchurian chicken was okayish good..garlic corn I didn't like much..too much gravy..overall good experience.. I guess I'll order again!!!

Good food for take away, I did not try all of them but few Chinese that I have tried are good few are so so, the rice noodle, Hakka noodle (mix) are good, the schezwan rice I tried was moderately good. Mutton liver roll, and other rolls are superb.

A tiny takeaway outlet which provides u yummy oil free rolls. Good tasty and pocket friendly food. Yet to try out their Indian menu. I think it's one of the best takeaway joints in Naktala. Their prompt service also deserves a thumps up

This fast food Center opened near to my house and have lots of things in there menu. Very small roadside eating joint. One day I went took mono as parcel it was priced at Rs 40 for six pieces with soup. I had one plate for me and one plate for my parents. I tried the soup didn't like that. The momo were soft but felt taste could have been better, the taste of the chicken was not authentic. Next day thought of get some things for my dinner, so ordered chicken egg noodles and chilli garlic chicken dry
Both the items tasted blunt no spice at all. The chicken in the chilli garlic chicken was hard 

Food 3/5
Service 4/5

Roll is their specialty.... Go for the Egg-Liver or only Liver roll.... It melt inside your mouth.  Prices are pretty low.  Quality of food is standard.

The most homely food joint in Naktala area. The momos are great with the red sauce. Other Chinese food is also good such as mixed noodles and chilli chicken. The rolls need special mention,they are way better than reputed roll corners. Waiting to try the newly introduced items.

A takeaway joint which has slowly & steadily made its name amidst the competition to serve quality pocket friendly food around naktala area. They serve both chinese & north indian delicacies.

Some of the dishes i have tried so far are:-

1. Chicken Steam momo- 6pcs of generous fillings of chicken & onions. Outer dough isnt thick & is just about perfect. The soup they serve also deserves a special mention.

2. Panfried chicken momos- Again 6pcs of momos made in schezwan sauce. The level of spice is just perfect(neither too hot nor too mild). Recommended

3. Crispy konjee chicken- Bits of chicken made in chilli sauce,onion & spring onions. A tad salty in preparation but taste wise it was awesome to eat.

4. Chilli garlic chicken rice

5. Manchurian fish- 8pcs of soft & perfectly cooked pure fish cubes made in machurian sauce. The taste is awesome & went very well with the rice dishes.

Pocket pinch is definitely on the lower side. They also provide home delivery service. Will be looking to try their north indian delicacies the next time

Food is yummy & warm. They increase price every now and then. Preference like 'no sauce in roll' is not cared but served at their own will. Customers on pavement obstruct pedestrians. More cordial behavior is expected.
