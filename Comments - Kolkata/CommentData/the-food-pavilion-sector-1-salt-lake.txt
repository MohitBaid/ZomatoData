I am a Software Developer at Salt lake and my primary point of dinner is Food Pavilion. If you want to have good quality home made food, this is the place for you. Even after eating regularly for the past 2 years I did not have any health issues (touchwood). I request you all to try it out once. Best dishes:  Aloo Paratha, Doi Rui, Doi Chicken, Dhakai Murg Pulao etc.

Though got discouraged after reading the previous reviews, I tried this joint anyway, and, I don't think its that bad. Perhaps people love to exaggerate or perhaps those were true who cares? Anyway, the bengali dishes served are really good, I'm impressed. Now trust me when I say its not that easy to impress me. Everyone must try this place , especially the bengali dishes.

This is the worst place I have ever been to..I wanted to try this place as it is nearby..the quality of food is bad..the service is pathetic and the attitude of the staff is horrible..Don't have much to say about this place..I would just suggest my followers not to visit the place.

A disgusting place to be at.. Remains closed half the time.. The quality is not worth praising,, and they dont have a proper ambience or sitting arrangement.. Thumbs down!!

The first place that I happened to visit when I shifted to Salt Lake. I must say that the unplesant attitude really shocked me. The average food was overpowered by the terrible attitude which I could not get over. An extra spoon to share my grub fetched me a ten minute lecture on how expensive cost of extra spoons are. I recommend no one to visit this place as there are much better places with friendly staff and good food.Overall-"HORRIBLE."

My office is in sector1 and I am a frequent visitor to this restaurant to savor quality Bengali food at an affordable price. They serve very high quality rice. I love the "doi rui". Overall,  it is  a good place for frequent visit for quality food.
