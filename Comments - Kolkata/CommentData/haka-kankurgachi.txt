Very nice place if you are looking for a buffet withing 500 Rs. Foods are tasty, ambience is good. 

As starter they served some dumplings (melted into the mouth), drums of heavens (super tasty) , crispy fried fish (yummy) and some fried veggies ( not up to the mark). After that the chicken coriander soup was served. Coming to main course they had veg fried rice, mixed fried rice, chilli chicken, one prawn item and some veg items also, and my favourite spicy crabs. But the dessert part really disappointed me. Only 2types of cakes, four flavours of ice cream with darsaan was available. We expected some more desserts. But overall a good experience.

The best Buffett for college student as it is cheap and the environment is good. With just addition of few amount anyone will get unlimited coke. Momo and the soup is good. As compare to the starter the main course is quite good but as a sweet love I am quite impressed with the desert they server as compare yo the cost.

If you are looking for pocket friendly buffet destination, then look no further than hakka. Soups ( veg and non veg), salads (not much variety), an array of starters (drums of heaven, dumplings, honey chilli potato, etc), main course (noodles, fried rice, veg & non veg sides) and desserts (ice creams and mousse) - all these at an unbelievably low price.
However, after couple of visits, the items tend to get repetitive.

And the buffet menu was really not enough. I felt a lot of the dishes were empty but apart from the dimsums everything else was quite good. The chicken drumsticks were amazing, it was really good and I really liked the Darsaans too.

I've visited City Centre branch of Haka before, but this was my first visit to the Mani square one. I've had my Chinese a la carte at Haka, but this the first time I sampled their buffet. Firstly, the place is nicely done and has a good vibe about it. The buffet was reasonably priced, with a minor surcharge if one wishes to have prawn, since that is not included in the buffet. The Haka chicken soup was just the right amount of tangy, to set your taste buds dancing on a wintry afternoon. For starters, there were prawn wafers, chicken drumsticks, chicken Waltons, veg wantons and spicy potato. Starters were pretty good, especially the chicken drumsticks(Hong Kong style) and the spicy potato. Main course comprised of the usual fare : egg fried rice, chicken hakka noodles, a chicken and fish gravy preparation each. It was nothing fancy, just good old conventional Chinese. Special mention should be made of butter garlic veg noodles.For dessert, there were pastry, brownie, darsan and ice cream. I quite liked the buffet and would look forward to visit again. I just wish they could add a complimentary soft drink to the buffet, that would make it oh-so-good :).

Haka is one of the popular destination for all chinese cuisine lovers in town and being a hardcore this place was in my wishlist for a long time. Finally today I got a chance to visit this restaurant to fulfill my chinese food craving. So let's come and explore this place.

Location & Ambiance - Haka situated on the 4th floor of the Mani Square Mall. The place usually remain crowded throughout the lunch and dinner time. I visit this restaurant around 1:30PM today and it was pretty much filled up with crowd and luckily got a table for myself without sanding in queue. The Place is really big in size with continuous music at background. Stuffs are really helpful, courteous, highly professional and always ready to take care about their customers' satisfaction.

Menu - Now come to the food part. I choose to have Non Veg Buffet which includes One non Veg Soup, 2 types of Non-veg starter item as well as 2 types of veg starter also, 2 types of main courses, 2 types of side dishes and desserts.

Soup - In Soup section, thay had Chicken Clear Corn soup. The Soup was good in taste but had little lack of salt into it. just add some salt & pepper and you are ready to go.

Starter - In starter section they had Vegetable fried wonton and Crispy vegetable konjeenaro as veg starter and Chicken Siu mai and Drums of Heaven (Hong Kong Style) as a non-veg starter.
Fried Wonton was too crispy from outside but I feel less filling inside of it. Crispy vegetable konjeenaro was excellent. With crispy texture from outside and soft from inside, the item is must try item here. Now come to the non veg starter section, Chicken Siu mai very good. Moist outer coating with chicken filling at centre the dish is heavenly for any Dimsum lovers. If the above mentioned items were good, then Drums of Heaven was really the showstopper. Crispy fried chicken with perfectly mixed sauce, the item tastes like heavenly.

Main Course - In the main section they had Sichuan Chicken Noodles as well as Chicken Fried rice. The noodle was good but hardly had any veggies in it. With soft touch of sauce, the noodle tastes good. Now come to the fried rice section, well cooked rice was carefully cooked with lots of chicken and eggs. Both the main items were good but was oily in nature, especially the fried rice.

Side Dish - In the side dish section they had Hot and Garlic Chicken and Fish in chilli mustard sauce. The chicken had no extraordinary touch, just like traditional Hot & Garlic chicken. But on the other hand the fish was just mind-blowing. Thin layered Basa fish was cooked in mustard sauce. Taste-wise it was quite different but I like it.

Desserts - In desserts section they had Darsaan, Cake, Desserts of the day, Mousse & 4 types of ice cream i.e Vanilla, Orange, Chocolate, Tutti Frutti. Darsaan was warm in nature, cake was good but the desserts of the day was pretty hard. Ice Cream was good as usual and the mousse was just perfect.

After telling my lunch experience, I especially want to mention the name of Mr. Prasant, Restaurant Manager of HAKA in my review for showing much courtesy. His polite behaviour, warm greetings really made my dining experience a grand one. Overall it was a great dining experiences from my side and definitely visit this restaurant again.

Very Nice reception and behaviour of staffs and manager. They celebration my birthday very nicely playing birthday mudic at background when they were informed abt it. Staffs behaviour was awesome and so kind and friendly. Free cake was provided. But the problem with food was but number items were less enough. And variety was also missing. Main course only contained chicken chow, fried rice, garlic chicken and fish mustard(which was not pleasant taste)... Started was almost tasty but variety was missing.... Chicken drum stick and soup was only non veg item in non veg buffet. Deserts also only have same micro cake pieces and dougnuts. Ice cream was there of four types but too common flavours vanila, mango, butter scotch, chocolate. Over all for the price its good but satisfaction of food wasn't upto the mark.

Celebrated my parents anniversary in haka.
We tried both from the ala carte and buffet.
Buffet had a variety of veg n non veg spread
Few salads, chilly chutney n the garlic chutney were great to take a dig..even liked their pickled salad.
In the starter they have both veg soup n a non veg one. I tried the chicken corn soup it was quiet refreshing. Then they served chicken drumstick in hongkong style- hit of the buffet, chicken suimai-much like momo, veg wonton, crispy veggies. In the main course they had mixed schezwan noodles , mixed fried rice, garlic chilly chicken, fish(bhetki)in mustard sauce. There were few veg options too although I didn't tried that. Moving to the desert section they served some exquisite chocolate pastries great in taste then they had a tart like thing which was also good. They serve several flavours of ice cream-vanilla,chocolate,tutty fruity,mango along with hot chocolate sauce, green sauce, nuts n cookie crumble.
We ordered a prawn dish in starter it was alsoo great along with it I tried the virgin mogito it was not upto the mark.
Overall a great experience in terms of food n quality. The staff were preety warm n charming. Last but not the least they gave us a complimentary cake for the celebration of anniversary. A great buffet to dig in ..with a low pinch on your pocket.

The lunch buffet on Christmas '17, was an absolute delight. From the eight treasures chicken soup down to the upside down pineapple cake, a complete 5 course meal, and one of the most delicious lunch ever. They definitely deserves a full rating of 5, for leaving neither quality, quantity nor presentation to be desired.

I went there to give my birthday treat to my friends. I called them up beforehand and they advised me to call them after leaving my place as they dont take reservations for lunch after 1pm. We went there and the manager was very sweet and was assisting us thoroughly. We opted for the lunch buffet which  was 432 per person. There were soup, starters, main course, deserts. In soup there was a veg/non veg soup, in starters they had chicken drumstick, suimayi, fried wantons for non veg. And in main course they had egg friedrice, noodles, fish and chicken. In deserts they had 4 flavours of ice cream, darshan, chocolate mishti, etc. All the items were perfectly cooked and presented. We loved all the starters. And the fish was lip-smacking in the main course. The desert was amazing too. The ice creams were really yummy. And all my friends enjoyed the food alot. In the end Haka surprised me with a birthday cake and played birthday music in the background. The staffs were very attentive and polite. I loved my experience here. Its amazing to get such a nice buffet in such low prices. Would absolutely love to visit again. ‚ù§

Only the chicken drumsticks were tasty and spicy to mention amongst others and rest were average. In the main course the sopu chicken and fish in oyster sauce were just good only. Desserts were also okayish. Staff was a bit slow in refilling the main course dishes. Had more expectations!

One can't go once and not go again. We went for the buffet, right from the starters with dumplings and wontons, main course with 1 chicken and 1 prawn dish , rice and  noodles. No matter what the respective day's menu is, the flavour, the taste is mouth watering. As for the desert you have ice creams, sweets and are allowed to customise it with choco chips , walnuts and choco sauce. They could have added pastries but maybe that's the menu for another day. The service is flawless and you will definitely leave salivating.

I took my family and in-law suite for a Sunday dinner. Just stroke my mind that it's a subsidiary of Mainland China. So went ahead without any second thought. Sunday so after a brief waiting got the table for 8 sitting. 
Food menu was great, quality is prevailing. A long list of menu doesn't mean better. 
Being a food loving bong, I tried almost everything.
Fish peper in the starter, the chicken in main course and darshan stood out for the best. But the crab caught the best of it.
Overall I was satisfied and that too with such small price to pay.

Am regular here is an understatement, we call it comfort food. After a long of work and meetings, we do not have the energy to decide the cuisine and place to eat at we wind up here. Buffet is really good, variety over the days (since I visit often) is lacking but that is not what I can complain given the economical price point. The cocktails needs a bit of work sometimes but its good nevertheless. I just love the chicken dumplings, they either make chicken dumpling and veg wantons or chicken wantons and veg dumplings. The days I miss the chicken dumplings they sometimes get a special plate just for us without even me asking. And the service is always with a smile. This will always be my comfort joint.

It might not be the best among the buffets in town, but it certainly is pretty decent when it comes to the price and quality of food. At around 400 bucks, the buffet spread offers soups,  dimsums,  starters, noodles, rice, side dishes and desserts as well.

The ambience is pleasing.

The staff is courteous. A nice over all experience.

A nice place to taste Chinese Cuisine. The soup and waffers in the starters are nice. With the chilli potato adding a spicy and tangy taste to the tongue. The main course has a nice variety of chicken items with the drumsticks being the best. The egg rice and noodles are well flavoured to be the main base food. Finally the desert comes with some chocolate cakes and a cheese cake with the as usual ending with the variety of ice creams with chocolate and mango sauce garnishings.

Was super excited to visit a place which had some reasonable rate for chinese buffet. For that we were recommended haka by many people and gave a visit. Here is my small review of the place:
1. The starters were extremely good and they will serve you the starters in your place. The rest was self service. We had Chicken Wantons, Haka Chili Potato, Clear chicken soup, Momos and Drums of heaven. The taste of every dish was too good.
2. The main course was too ordinary and plain. Could have been better and more options were expected rather than the regular hakka chowmin and fried rice.
3. The dessert had many varieties. The deseert is something which just adds on the extra essence on something. Two noteworthy desserts were blueberry mousse and Cream Choux puff. The cream choux puff was something very new that I tasted and I just totally loved it! It was a sweet which had chocolate infused in it. But to my surprize, all the ice creams were below ordinary. There was a variety of ice cream toppings. But still I couldn't make the ice creams tasty and they just didn't taste of any flavours but only ice!
4. The manager was well behaved and surveyed us to know if the taste was fine!

Overall Haka was a place which gave us both mixed feelings about the dishes there. I guess some of their items in the menu keeps upon changing everyday, specially their deseert of the day.

I went for the lunch buffet. 
Starters included two veg starters and two non-veg starters. Staples included chicken noodles and chicken fried rice. There was one chicken and one fish side dish. Dessert comprised of one mango cheese cake and a chocolate souffle. There were 4 flavours of ice cream with choice of different toppings. Coming to the quality, it was much better than most Chinese restaurants in Kolkata but it wasn't the best Chinese I had.

Bottom line: You can't get better Chinese buffet at this price. Go for it, you'll not regret it.

A nice place to dine out....

Now this must get a lot of praise !!!!
Haka was really amazing. I was impressed by both the food and the decor.I went for the buffet at Rs 440. now talking about the food the starters were really good. The drums of heaven justified its name to the fullest. Fried chicken wantons were praiseworthy .for main course i really liked the devil chicken .wat i really liked were the deserts and its varieties.the staffs were well behaved too. Overall it was a great experience. Please do give it a try üôÇ

I was a regular at this place during my school days. A good buffet after a odd movie, or a birthday celebration haka was the place for us. Always a big fan of Speciality Restaurant and their brand of food haka became a regular hang out for us heavy eaters. The decor is nothing fancy but quite nice and easy on the eye. Well to begin with the starters drums of heaven, or dimsums or fried wantons loaded with chicken and good to tatse. The soup is okayish with again a good amount of meat. The main course is not very fancy like the rice and chowmein over my numerous visits have not been something awesome but good at that price. What amazes me is that be it chicken prawn or fish in the main course there will be one dish which manages to stand out. I love their mustard fish or schezwan fish. Their chili chicken is also good. As the buffet menu changes over time so it is kind of difficult to keep track. But overall with newer options like crab and lamb in weekends they have kept their foothold. Now coming to the dessert section, the part which many heavy buffet eaters target is quite good at their price. I have had ice cream of 4different flavours in haka along with accompaniments like chocolate sauce, chips etc darsaan, cakes and mousse. The drinking option is there so you can easily go for something you like. Mainly this place gives you a buffet spread at a much pocket friendly rate and is total value for money. The staff is quite courteous and during weekends and holidays they get quite a rush So that gives you an idea how good they are. But lastly their a LA carte food quality js much better in taste though prices are higher.

If you're on a tight budget but still crave for a Chinese buffet,visit Haka at the Mani Square Mall. I've visited this place on multiple occasions and hence I've forgotten the exact menus on those specific days.

For starters,two items that stood out were-the Chicken Wantons and the Drums of Heaven.
Combine the crispness of the wantons and the juiciness of the drumsticks(more like lollipops)and you'd like to eat that forever and not proceed for main course.
Other items in starters include clear soup,crispy chilli potatoe and dimsums(or suimai).

In the main course I had concentrated less on the fried rice/chowmein,and more on the chicken and fish preparations.
The rice and chowmein were average.
The side dishes keep changing and I think they include crab,prawns and lamb on weekends(not sure).

Moving on to dessert, choose your flavour of ice cream from 5 different flavours.
Then there's darsaan,cakes,pastries and pudding,all of which were good.

Like after any other buffet,I initially had difficulty in moving as I'd stuffed myself up too much(starters mainly). 
The dining experience was good. Service was good and refilling of food counters were prompt.
They also have offers on drinks and certain dishes from the √† la carte menu.

Can do better with the starters. Average food quality, no wow factor. I didn't like the chicken drumstick at all. Chicken rice was good. I loved the dessert part mainly. I will rate it 3. Though the lunch buffet price is 440 per person, its cheap still its very average

today visited this restaurant after a long time, with family to enjoy a nice lunch. tried the buffet spread, all are chinese delicacies. starters were really good though I would like to see the option of steamed wanton or dimsum along with fried. introduction of lamb item could have been great. they provide prawn dish with extra 65 inr. also 40 inr per person for unlimited pepsi. service was good.

Haka was in my bucket list for probably last one month. We went to the Mani Square outlet. We were 2 people and there was an offer on drinks. So, we took one small peg of smirnoff and got another small peg free. All total came for 1056 rupees. Now lets come to the food. In the starter there were some regular chicken soup, chicken drumsticks and chicken wanton, crispy chilli baby corn, veg momo. I didn't even try the momo. Chicken Wanton contained very small amount of chicken and the Babycorn was not really very good. Just ok kinda stuff. In the main course we had some mixed kinda rice with honey mustard fish and a chicken preperation. Post that there were some pineapple pastry which I didn't like bcause of the strong flavour. Just the ice cream was pretty good. There are three things which I feel should be regarded and those are the ambience, the staff and the pocket pinch.

This place is definitely underrated!!!!
One of the best Chinese buffet at a super affordable price!!
They have very courteous staff and the ambience is perfect.
We went for the buffer and extra ordered things were two prawn dishes at rupees 68 each, where each plate consisted of 8pieces.
For the starters we had
Chicken soup which was light and flavoursome! Helped a lot with our sore throats.- 4.5/5
Fried chicken wantons- 7/5
Oh my Lord! I loved these. Had atleast 6-7 of these amazingly fried crunchy pieces.
Chicken drumsticks- 5/5
These were amazing and we went for several serving of these too!
Veg momo- perhaps the only item in the menu that didn't appear appealing to me! Very bland in taste- 2.5/5
Chilly potatoes- 5/5
This particular item tasted so bad and extra spicy in every place that I went to! But haka made amazing crispy chilly potatoes. Seriously guys, don't miss it!
Black pepper prawn- 3.5/5 tasted average. The seasoning overpowered the fish to some extent!

Mains:
Chicken fried rice- 3.5/5
Chicken noodles- had a weird smoky taste. 3.5/5
Devil chicken- tasted average. 3.5/5
Fish in mustard sauce- 5/5. Amazing taste!

Desserts:
Haka serves a amazing desserts. I tasted their vanilla and chocolate ice cream with chocolate chips and chocolate sauce. I must say that the ice cream tasted pretty damn good!

Overall, a brilliant experience! Andddd per person the cost was 440 including the prawns! So they've reduced the price of the buffet I guess as per the new gst! So , happy diner‚ô•Ô∏è


Went there again today for the weekend buffet.
Loved all the items but missed the chicken wantons in the starter.üíî But the chicken suimai tasted awesome and  the pan fried fish was really good. 
The crab was good but it didn't fit in since the pieces were so small that it became really hectic trying to pull out the flesh.
Loved loved loved the prawnnnns‚ù§Ô∏è
Today the place was packed with people and the people who served were very smooth and quick in responding to everyone. Also we took draught beer and ginger mocktail. The mocktail tasted damn good! Their current weekend buffet is priced at 510.

We went for the dinner buffet. If you are searching for a cheap buffet option then you may prefer haka, as it costed only 485 bucks on weekdays. Now though ambience and service was good but the main attraction i.e food was quite average and it didnt appeal much to the tastebuds. There will be decent amount of choice of food in the buffet but personally i didnt like the taste much so for me it was a so-so experience.

The food was pretty decent as well as the ambience. The starters, specilly thw dukplings were delectable and I wish I had more of those instead if trying the noodles. The only letdown was the crab though. They were served in the shell and were impossible to eat without getting completely messy. They should not include it in the menu and even if they do it should be without the shell, maybe as a crab cake or crab meat wontons. The desserts were also pretty good. In a nutshell it was a decent Chinese meal with not many frills or wow moments, but totally worth it given the price tag. If someone is going there, please concentrate on the strters & desserts and you'll have good time. Cheers.

Have been there in the bucket list for quite a while, and we finally gave it a shot last afternoon for lunch! 
Budget friendly buffet with decent spreads. 
Ambience of the place is pretty good,with amazing staff service. 
They generally serve soup and starters on the table and we got to take maincouse from the counter, like any other buffet place. 
Chicken soup was amazing, whereas honey chilli potato,veg wanton was just average, but chicken drumsticks and veg dimsum tasted amazing! 
Starters were too filling, so didn't try maincouse much, but chicken hakka Noodles, chicken fried rice, chilli chicken and schwzan fish tasted great. 
Desserts section had some delicious treats, pastry tasted good as well the mousse, didn't try the icecreams though! 
Overall a great experience! :) 
Will visit again soon.

This is one of the best destination if you are craving for Chinese. They have an amazing Chinese buffet at a very reasonable price. I have visited this place quite a number of times and they have always stood up to the mark. Never really tried any ala carte as their buffet is a total 'paisa wasool' buffet. So if you are really hungry for some Chinese, this is the place to go.

Was there twice for their lunch buffet. It was a delightful experience. The starters were served at the table and then we found those starters were rhere in the buffet spread as well...The mixed fried rice and the chicken siu mai impressed me the most. Their dessert spread was limited but good enough. We were there for nearly 90 mins and never felt too long for us. We were busy gossipping and gorging down on whatever we got from the buffet spread. Been there thrice already and will keep coming as long as this restaurant manages to impress me! :)

Chicken drumsticks and chili fish in the starters were finger licking.
Had fried rice with crabs later on. Must say both are must for crab lovers.
Had blackcurrant mousse with kiwi syrup as desert. Not a big desert fan being a carnivore, but trials didn't go waste.

I have visited Haka many times, but today's experience was worst among all. We went there today in a small group and opted for the Non Veg Buffet. The options were very less : 2 Non Veg , 2 Veg Starters ,¬† 1 soup. The main course also didn't catch the eye as the food options and quality of food was mediocre. The staff behaved politely but the service was poor and not at all up to the mark. No attendants , we literally had to shout for someone to come and attend us. Totally dissatisfied.

We went at Haka on 29th Oct'17 for a Sunday lunch. The experience was not at all satisfactory, strangely all the chicken dishes were having a bad smell and seemed to be stale. Be it starter, (chicken wings and chicken sui mai) or main course (chicken with cashew nut), the bad smell was prevalent. Rest of the items were ok, nothing special and not worth mentioning. Priced at 563/- ( All Inclusive), it would have been priceworthy if all the items were edible.

If I have to compare haka saltlake city centre vs haka Mani sq. mall. I would  have rated 4/5 haka saltlake and 2/5 haka Mani sq. mall . Only reason is food quality. I personally feel that haka Mani square mall should improve the food quality ,mainly when it comes to buffet menu. Overall experience below average and it's just because of food quality.

I have always loved the simple Chinese food that the Speciality Restaurants churn out. I have previously been to the other outlet of Haka at City Centre 1 and loved it, so when I had to choose a place to dine in with my cousins at Mani Square, Haka wasn't a tough choice. The unlimited buffet priced at 499 AI definitely helped in making that decision!

The buffet isn't grand, like the ones you would expect in some places. However, the food is delicious and the price is definitely way less than most places. Starting from the soup to the barbequed potato and chicken wings to the beautiful fish preparation for the main course and ultimately, the blueberry mousse and mango ice cream - almost all the dishes will satiate your stomach. The staffs are courteous and friendly. Overall, a happy atmosphere for happy dining!

Ambience-not bad. 

I will make this review short , crisp and to the point.
Starters as mentioned my others.They will give the starters on your table.Its unlimited.
Main course food items-as mentioned by others.
You have to go to the place physically  where  all food items are kept and take the main food by yourself.
Desserts -lovely ice creams.
Price and pics attached.
Good for 1 time visit.

We went there during Kali Puja Morning. We went for the Chinese buffet. That day the buffet price was Rs 560 but on regular weekdays the price will be Rs 480. We went there between 12:30-3.

Food :

Starter :
Chicken Soup
Pan fried fish (specially available on 560 buffet)
Chicken drumsticks
chicken wantons

Main Course:
Fried rice
noodles
Mustard chicken
prawn curry (available on 480 buffet with additional Rs69)
another fish item (I don't remember the name)

Salad:
papad
fried noodles
cucumber soaked in vinegar
achari salad

Dessert:
Pudding Sandesh
Blueberry moose
ice cream (vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, mango)
darsan
(with unlimited choco sauce, choco chips, jelly and nutty topping)

I suggest you to visit the place for the dessert and starter (pan fried fish and chicken drumsticks). The main course was okayish.

Staff:
The restaurant staff were polite and well mannered. They were personally taking care of us and settled every issue.

Interior:
The restaurant is well decorated, specially the wall papers attracted my view. Overall it was a nice experience.

Chinese Soup
Chicken momo
Chicken wings (Best one)
Two veg starters
Chicken Fried rice
Chicken Hakka Noodles
Thai Fish
Sheaf's special Chicken
Pastry
Four flavors of Ice creams
Darsan

Food was good. 4/5

But after the starters the disappointment starts. Some of the items in the main course were nice but there were some repetitive items in the main course from the starters. In dessert there were very few items.

The decoration and ambience are good. They play soft music which is very relaxing. 
The food is tasty. They serve authentic Chinese. Starters have lots of variety including chicken soup, dumplings, pan fried chicken lollipop, french fries and some other. The main course has egg fried rice, chilli fish and chilli chicken. Desserts are good. They serve different types of ice creams. You can garnish it with different types of toppings like choco chips, hot chocolate and etc.

So recently I went here with my friends to try their buffet.
Ambience is pretty simple and decent.
The buffet on weekdays cost 449/- including taxes.
With an additional charge of 55/- we got unlomited cold drinks each.
This is truly an amazimg buffet with a widespread of starters,maincourse and dessert for both veg and non veg foodies.

‚Ä¢Starter-The non veg starter section had Chicken wantons,Chicken drumstick.Veg is common and had crispy baby corns,Coated potato fingers and veg dumplings.Also,chicken sweet corn soup is there.Starters are served on the table and they give refills promplty.Each and every item was delicious.

‚Ä¢Maincourse-Non veg section has Egg fried rice,chicken noodles,Chilli chicken and hunan fish.Also the veg section is good having the same staples in veg with a mixed veg curry in mustard sauce and chilli paneer.The maincourse items are well cooked and lipsmacking.

‚Ä¢Prawn curry at 65-Yes you heard it right.If you are taking a buffet,an additional charge of 65 gives you the a bowl full of tasty 8 pieces prawn in gravy of your choice.We had it as a side.It can be taken as starter too.Me and

Have gone there twice for buffet.Crowded place,a little bit late service.Good tastes of starters & deserts were also nice,main course was a little bit blunt.One thing to mention that they don't serve complimentary drink with buffet,If you want a drink,you have to order it separately.Although It is recommended from me.

Buffet in Haka is very pocket friendly and a good place for a get-together with friends. 
The starters here are very good. Desserts are in less number but the quality is good. Though the main course couldn't match the standard with starters and dessert, but it was also good. 
The best offer you will get is Unlimited Cold drinks for just 40 per head. 
The service as well as the behaviour is very good. 
A well planned place for a get together with friends.

Serves amazing Chinese!! Not all places serve you the right kind of Chinese food in the city, but Haka is one of those which has authentic food. Shouldn't miss this place if anyone is a Chinese lover. The buffet was super delicious and we loved each and every dish right from the starters till the dessert. The hospitality is commendable as well. I loved the place and the food thoroughly!

Environment was good with that music nd cool decor. the manager was really courteous. but they need to develop their few food items like few starters..like there was dish like momo.it was horrible.i didn't like the soup.drumstick was just flat.but otherwise it is worth for money.just 440/-..so nothing can be better than this
Starters :- 3.5/5
Main course :- 4/5
deserts :- 3/5 ( lack of varities )
but for allover haka :- 4/5 ... will surely visit in future

We decided to have buffet today. So an economical option was haka. The waiting time was nearly half an hour. The starters were ok except that the fish was loaded with cornflour so I could hardly taste the fish. The chilli baby corn were amazing as were the chicken suimai. Main course had Singapore chilli crab and prawn and chicken which were quite good. Now coming to the desserts, I did expect Haka to come with a fruit platter atleast but sadly they did not have it. Also there was only one varient of mousse. Now coming to the ice cream quality, it tasted grainy which means the milk quality used wasn't too good. You could specially feel the graininess in vanilla (which by the way, is my all time favourite). So overall I have given it a 3.5 experience. Haka please improve slightly further more.

By far the best buffet in Kolkata if you are a value for money man. No hidden costs, no extra fuss, just good food. From the drumsticks at the beginning to the desserts in the end, every item is better than average. Some are quite delicious. Was a regular visitor during my college days. Food-4, Ambience-3.5, Value for money-5, Staff-5. If you're in Money square, you just can't miss this treat.

We visited the restaurant on a Sunday. It was very crowded and we had to wait for about an hour. The restaurant is not very spacious and pretty clumsy. However the food is impressive and value for money. The buffet spread is elaborate, my personal favorites being the starters and desserts. I won't say the service is amazing because they were taking quite some time to refill the food once exhausted. But then again it was a rush hour. Overall Haka is pretty good if you are looking for reasonably priced Chinese.

Located on the top floor of Mani Square this is a must visit place for all the buffet lovers!

Decor: Brightly painted walls and fairly comfortable seating arrangements. Nothing to brag about.

Staff: Polite and listens to you. Has fair knowledge of what they are serving.

Food: This steals the show without a doubt. We always try their buffet. The soups are amazing coupled with lip smacking chicken lollipops. Starters are good and so are the mains. They put out separately cooked dishes for vegetarians, a very good gesture. They have improved the dessert section and it is fairly strong. The best thing is unlimited soft drinks at a very nominal price.

Overall: Great food at a stellar price. A must visit specially for college and school goers.
A shout out to the manager who interacts with each customer to cater to their needs.

Crab was also good in taste..
I don't like to have fish but the fish item was very tasty so I can't stop myself to have it.

Ambience: Located at the top floor of Mani Square beside Machaan and Hoppipola, this place is a Chinese lover's ideal place. Spacious with buffet service, this restaurant offers complete satisfaction for the hungry one. The walls are filled with graffiti and the tables are arranged in fours and eights primarily. Place is well maintained and pretty standard.

Food: Since it specializes mostly on chinese cuisine, the buffets items contain chinese items mainly. The Soups and the starters are tasty and fill the stomach in a better way than the main course ones. The main course noodles and side dishes (mostly chicken and fish) are bland and does not serve the required purpose of palate satisfaction. Again the desserts come as a welcome surprise with ample variation in taste and flavor. 

Service : Service is okayish. Nothing great but nothing to criticise either. Cash and card both accepted. And the waiters oblige to clicking your group photos willingly. :)

Go here for some excellent chinese buffet. The chicken wantons,the dumplings and lollipop is awesome. Then there are noodles,fried rice,prawn,fish and chciken and soup. Among the desserts the darshan is awesome. They also keep 4variety of flavours in ice-cream. Great place to be! I have been here for more that 6 times!!

WARNING!! The 'Cleaners' got such an audacity here that they can insult you for sharing you food!! On my first visit during Durga Puja with 3 others including my Mom, one of the assistant/cleaner rudely said that I've to bill separately for my mom who wasn't dining at all due to health issue and I just shared 2 tiny scoop of icecream with a spoon. I visited the CC1 outlet of Haka previously but never faced such situation. I'd like to warn all my friends and Zomato users NOT TO VISIT ever this outlet, better you opt for other options in the same floor at Mani Square.

Been there during this durgapuja and had opted the buffet. 6-7 items were served as starters. The fish and the chiken was yummy. They had shrimp, lamb, chiken, rice and noodles in their main course. Rice was not that good. Dessert had very few items. Mousse was tasty. But during the durga puja rush, they did not compromise with their quality.

We went in for the buffer dinner on a hungry Tuesday night. Decent Chinese (although fully Indianised) food. Food is just above average. They serve the starters at the table. This is an added advantage.
The decor is good but can be much better as I saw the wall paper peeling off from a few places.
Service is good.
I would have rated it 3.5... But I rated it 4 because of the value for money it offers.... After all there are hardly any restaurants that offer you a buffer meal within 500‚Çπ

If you are looking for cheap chinese buffet in the city, this is the place to go to! Buffet at 675 offers a variety of food items to satiate your hunger. There were 3 types of non veg starters, out of which chilly fish tasted the best. Coriander soup was tasty. In the main course,there were a variety of options including lamb,shrimp,chicken etc. I liked the shrimp side dish the most. Dessert comparatively had much lesser options if you compare with other restaurants offering buffet.

One thing I would like to mention, even during the peak hours of the Durga puja rush, the quality and taste of the food was quite good and the service was prompt enough.

Totally disappointing experience went for dinner in mani square outlet..price was too high 675 all inclusive and the food was just the opposite.
Starter needs to be improved a lot..the taste was lacking..
Main course was also poor in taste..
Dessert section was okkkk...
Coming to the service it was low..
Bad and worse experience for 1st time..
I recommend not to visit during the puja days...

A very ordinary buffet experience. Coming to food the starters were good nothing over the top. Main course items were pretty much OK... Desert sections had a few options to choose from.. Only the ice cream was good.  Starter and desert sections need a lot of improvement. Coming to service it was too poor. The staffs are not at all trained. I opted for non-veg. When I went to fetch a veg dish in the main course section a waiter just reminded me that I had opted for non-veg. Then they were so late in serving drinking water. Also had to wait for 20 long minutes to get the change after paying a 2k note.

Went for dinner buffet with family at the mani square outle. Chicken haka soup was nice. There was chicken suimai on the menu but what they served was chicken dumplings, on telling the waiter they said that it was the same but its not actually. When I told them the difference they made suimai separately for us. The only dish that I liked was the chicken fried rice, rest evrything was terrible. The chilli fish, chicken manchurian, drums of heaven, chicken dumplings and suimai was not at all good. There were four flavours of ice cream along with darsan and a pastry for dessert which I did not enjoy as well, the ice cream had no taste whatsoever, I think they make their own ice cream. Me and my family were very disappointed. Never going back again!!

I was a fan of this restaurant since it's inception, but now I will make a point that me or any of my friends and relatives doesn't visit this outlet of haka. Everything from Fried rice to darshan was bad. Improve the food quality or u will less many followers like me.

We had the sunday buffet lunch @440( all inclusive )
The menu consisted of a variety of items including 2 soups, 4 starters, 4 staples, 4 sides. The dessert was great with darshan, ice cream, mousse and a pudding as dessert of the day.
Well, if you are confused between Haka and their neighbour The Chapter 2, dont think twice go to Haka. The food is better, staff is better, rates are cheaper.
The ambience however fails compared to Chapter 2.
Although the entirely asian/ chinese menu starts tasting the same by the time you go to the main sides, but this is definately one of the cheapest buffets in the city.

The service is good and the staffs are courteous. But it would be better if they help serve the starter platters. Quality of the food is really nice. Awesome ambience.Starters include round potato fries which are really tasty and the veg chef's speciality was also lip smacking. The desert in buffet menu entails the yummy mousse backed by the green mango sauce and the ice cream, pampering the taste buds with choco chips. Overall a nice place for casual dinning.

Me and one of my friend went to this restaurant today . we took buffet lunch for Rs.440.
Starter : soup, drums of heaven, chicken Momo, corn cube, crispy potato fry with honey. This part is really good and delicious.
Main course : egg noodles, chicken fried rice, chilli chicken and one fish item. The fish item was good. Others are avg.
At the end end there was darshan,mousse, pestry , 4 types of ice cream.all those are just awesome.
At the budget of 440 the overall menu is OK....but main course is like slog over that needs a betterment.

I went there twice within a gap of 2 days!
Being a chinese food lover, this is one of the coolest places for chinese buffet lovers at an extremely reasonable price.
Weekday lunch menu consists of
Chicken dumplings, Chicken soup, Chicken drumsticks and Crispy chilli potato and crispy sweet corn in the veg starters option. For mains they offer Veg corn fried rice (which tastes awesome!), Chicken noodles, Chicken fried rice, a Chicken and a Fish side dish.
For dessert you'll get icecreams, mousse and one more sweet dish.
Weekend menu had 2 more items extra, fried crabs in starters and one prawn side dish in main course.

Both the times, i had nearly uncountable chicken dumplings and too many drumsticks.
All these mouth watering dishes all at an extremely pocket-friendly rate is all that you would need to have a super duper chinese meal.

Went there once for a buffet lunch. Was really impressed by the food quality. So, decided order food from them for lunch this afternoon. To be honest, i was disapointed with the service, because the food was delivered about 2 hours later, but that's Zomatos fault. Coming to the restaurant, im not a very big fan of their packaging. I ordered plain old chicken fried rice and chicken in chilli garlic sauce. The rice was packed in a plastic bag, and because it was delivered to me 2 hours later, it was cold. But at the end flavour wins. The rice was simple,light and tasty, but the chilli garlic chicken was not at all spicy, even though i specifically mentioned to make it more spicy. 
I would rather go there for buffet meals, than order food online.

Me and my partner visited the place sometime back. The ambience was good but the sitting arrangement made the place look like a over crowded restaurant. We were served the buffet starters - soup, chicken, crab and dim sum at the table. The starters tasted amazing so I had really high hopes for main course. The mix veg curry with corn and other vegetables tested good. The fired rice, spicy chicken, and prawn tasted good but the Thai fish curry had too much coconut milk in it. The dishes were average in taste as compared to the starters. The desserts of ice cream, gulab jamun and fresh fruits ended up the story well.

It was a fine afternoon when we went for our lunch (buffet) there.At the very entrance we smelled a very much homely atmosphere inside.The manager is a wonderful person who keeps on taking note of customer satisfaction.Coming to the food, first we were served with CHICKEN & CORN SOUP.Then came the DRUMS OF HEAVEN, CHICKEN DUMPLINGS and two other veg starter items of which the names I don't remember at the moment.Then coming to the main course there was a whole lot of delicacies such as CHICKEN HAKA NOODLES, EGG FRIED RICE, CHILI CHICKEN, HOT GARLIC FISH and some veg items besides these.Lastly in the Desert section there were DARSAN, MOUSSE & MANGO, VANILLA, STRAWBERRY CHOCOLATE FLAVOURED ICE CREAMS served with HOT CHOCOLATE SYRUP & CHOCO CHIPS.Each and every food item were made to perfection.I personally am a CARNIVOROUS animal.So the place seemed like heaven to me.Besides these there was also a complimentary drink PEPSI which we upgrade to UNLIMITED PEPSI by payung a few bucks more.So many lip smacking dishes and the same time Unlimited !! What more can one ask for? I had never dreamt of such an wonderful buffet menu at such a nominal price.Hats off HAKA !! I would highly recommend this outlet to everyone.

If you are craving for plateful of Chinese cuisine then visiting Haka for a buffet lunch at Mani Square would be something really blissful. And if you can make it out on one of the weekdays, the experience would turn out to be really profitable as it just costs Rs. 440.
Coming to the menu, one would served with a bowl of hot soup (either Veg or Non-veg) followed by starters - Dumplings, Chicken Drumsticks, Crispy vegetables and two other veg starts which I didn't taste. The soup was really good - hot, thick and was filled with grated vegetables, paneer and chicken, you may add the pan fried noodles to it and have it like chop suey. The stuffings in the Dumplings had a unique taste, one would find it hard to have enough of it and the crispy vegetables were tasty too. The main course had two options both for rice and noodles, the Ginger fried rice had a nice taste. Apart from that there was Garlic Chicken and Fish. However, their was no option for prawns. One can have them on extra payment. The desserts were yummy too, it had Daarsaan, Mousse, bread pudding and ice-creams of various flavours with hot chocolate syrup, choco chips etc.
Perhaps had a great time there and would recommend it for food lovers. Just a reminder, do not take excessive food on your plate and then waste it. :-)

I dropped by this outlet to re live the fabulous experiences I have had before at Haka. On asking for chopsticks, I was denied saying that chopsticks are only given at fine dine outlets! Really? Even at the streets of Territy Bazar people eat with chopsticks. It is the culture around the cuisine. What does fine dine has to do with chopsticks? 

I request management to take this up seriously. Also in the entire spread apart from the dimsums the dishes were mostly below average. Stale shellfish and high on salt sauces dampened my expectations, and coming back is no more an option!

Went there with my family last Monday for the dinner buffet(non-veg).
FOOD:
Very average. Starting with the starters which comprised of chicken and corn soup,chicken dumplings, drums of heaven,crispy fried veggies,and some sort of corn cubes which tasted okay(nothing special). The main course offered egg fried rice, egg noodles,chicken in parsley and hot garlic chicken. Tasted very plain, not at all satisfying. Now, the desserts definitely were better comparatively. Unlimited supply of ice creams and chocolate sauce and choco chips is what made my day. üòç Apart from that, there was mousse,a crunchy topping which were again very average in taste. 

SERVICE:
Must say the staff here is very efficient and friendly. Continually attended to us without any sort of delay. üëç

AMBIENCE:
Decorated in all black and red, this place gives a really good feel. 

In all, good choice as per budget buffet is concerned. However, if you're habituated to really tasty food, you might wanna consider other joints.

Space is enough. The Buffet is decent which costs ‚Çπ440 each. According to the price the food quality is decent. The Veg Rice doesn't taste good at all. Other than that, all the buffet foods taste good. Should add more varieties in the main course. Desserts were mundane but of good quality. Overall , it's a good place to eat if you are in a budget.

On weekends they include some extra dishes in the buffet such as today is a Saturday and they included crab in starter. The buffet rate also varry from weekdays to weekends. On weekends they cost 560(inclusive tax). There were momos, chicken drumsticks, a soup, crab, veg kababs in starter which they serve at table. In main course there rice, noodles, numbing chicken, prawns, fish. Chatni and papad were also there. And obviously the desert. it was awesome.

Went to this place twice and I must say that both the experiences were satisfactory. On both the occasions we tried the buffet and the buffet here is splendid. Although the items were basic but they were cooked well. The menu contains a number of starters followed by the main course and desserts in the end. It will be a delight for Chinese food lovers to try the buffet once. The price was also very affordable. The ambience and decor is smart but it tends to get very crowded at peak times. So it is better if you go there for a wholesome Chinese lunch.

A cheap buffet is their specialty. But the buffet is average with 3non veg and 2veg starters,6 main course and 3 dessrets. We went on a saturday . The crabs shrimps manchow soup and fish tasted good. But we were not able to finish even a single piece of chicken as they were so bad. There were mousse icecream (4flavours only) and pastry in the dessert section. The mousse tasted awful so as the pastry and the ice creams were like any other roadside icecream shops.
Lastly the staff behavior is pretty good and the interior also. If you want a budget buffet within 500 u can go there but dont keep much expectations

Probably,if not actually, the cheapest buffet in the city. With such good quality,good variety of chinese food served here, its such a great place to eat a lot and not worry about the pocket. Starting with chicken and corn soup,the delicious drums of heaven,prawn papad,crispy fried mixed veggies and momos, it really sets the mood(or rather, the taste buds).unlimited refills of pepsi at 46+tax per person and we were even served prawn dishes cooked in sauces of our choice at ‚Çπ65(8pieces).main course includes choice of noodles and rice along with fish and chicken side dishes which tasted really great. Desserts included darsaan,mousse and 4 flavors of icecream. Overall--
Food quality and taste--4.5/5
(Cant give this 5 as there are even tastier food available at some other much costlier places)
Service-5/5
Ambience-4.5/5
(Very decent and homely ambience,neatly decorated and well setup, but decor can always be better,right?)
Value for money-5/5
Overall, its a great place to hangout with friends and family and i can assure that no one would come out of this place with a sad face because afterall,
Good food+money left in pocket=happy endingüòÄüòÉ

Its a foodies heaven i must say.  Eat all buffet at 450 is really affordable in this time. I visited there with bunch of my friends. 
Location- in the top floor of manisquare mall. 
Ambience- cozy. Dimly lit. Wall paints are really nice. 
Food- obviously we have gone for the buffet. It includes 6 7 starters. Then followed by 1 rice item 1 noodle with a fish and chicken side dish. For deserts there were 4 different flavours of ice cream.  Mousse (2 types), unlimited chocolate sauce ., choco chips, mango jelly, caramel crunch. Now coming to the taste,  the starts are just yum. Specially the chicken drumsticks. One just can't get over it easily. The main course should be improved. Lastly the deserts are heaven on earth. We mainly had starts and the@ deserts. 
Highly recommended for foodies

This restaurant is located right next to Hoppipola at Mani square, on the 5th Floor. The low lit interiors have a long sofa in the middle , and tables of 4-6 all around . The staff here are courteous, and the service is quick. The buffet , menu , however , is very basic , and hardly has any item that is exclusive to this restaurant. The non veg starters include chicken drumsticks, and the soup and starters are served to the table . The main course had one rice item and non veg noodles. The dessert section was great , with four different flavours of ice cream,with various toppings , that allows you to create your very own sundae! It also had mousse, and  tiny pieces of cake. Overall , a value for money meal that is also light on your stomach !

The food is so bad it caused food poisoning. Do not try it. 
The starters were tasteless and the soup was watery with a few pieces of boiled chicken floating on it. The staff is very courteous. But the food quality is below par.

Personally speaking... Haka has been one of my favourite outlets for buffets.... For the items they serve at the amazing rate.... Quality is on higher side... Ambience good... Becomes crowdy during peak time....so avoid peak time if you want buffet.... Overall great... But the CC outlet is more classy than this one...

Went to Haka with my family for dinner. We had opted for the Non Veg Buffet. The starters included a soup, Chicken Drumsticks, Chicken Dimsums, an item with mixed Vegetable and a prawn dish. The drumsticks was the best. Didn't quite like the dimsums. The number of items in the main course is quite less. Some of them were not refilled either. There was two types of noodles and two varieties of rice. There were two side dishes of chicken. All of them were good. Coming to the desserts, they had darsaan, banana mousse which was delicious, strawberry tarts and four varieties of ice cream with four different toppings. The strawberry one was a turn down. It was full of ice crystals and lacked the strawberry flavour. But rest of them were nice.
Overall, a very nice experience. They can work on the dimsums and the main course. Very economical as well. The staffs were always on their feet and courteous.

This is one of the best buffet I have ever had . The price is really reasonable. They have a limited menu specially there were only 2 types of starters in nonveg section. But both were great. There veg starters were great as well. Now in main course I find it quite descent. Specially the chef special fish was really delicious. Now the desert section was a heart throb. Ice cream ,moose,nut balls all stole hearts. They had a special offer on hard drinks too. One on one free
 Overall a nice experience

One of the budget-friendly restaurants with good quality Chinese food, Haka is a refreshingly good choice. Situated at a quiet cozy corner in Mani Square mall, the decors are simple and decent. The buffet offers a variety of standard Chinese dishes, which are well cooked, tasty and Value for money. Suitable for large group treats as it is pocket friendly. They gave discounts for large groups too. Only negative was that the buffet area was a bit cramped up, and got crowded after a while.

Haka has always been one of my favorite and ideal place for chinese buffet.
The food is great they have two to three types of starters and soup.
For main course they have fish, shrimp and chicken items and the taste is always exquisite.
And the a great dessert spread out with ice cream, mousse, puddings, etc.
Ive always returned happy and satisfied from Haka.
Keep up the good work.

I have tried haka at city centre before but this is the first time that I visited the mani square outlet. My parents had celebrated their anniversary here with their close friends . The spread was value for money . There were chicken lollipops, stir fried prawns , stir fried cauliflower , spicy potato sticks , veg and non-veg wantons and hot and sour soup both veg and non-veg for starters . We had ordered fresh lime, beer and iced tea separately as well . In the main course there were 2 varieties of fried rice and noodles each ;veg and non veg . There was a chicken side dish , a fish side dish and 2 veg side dishes , one comprising of a tasty mix of vegetables. The desserts comprised 4 varieties of ice-cream with chocate sauce , nuts , chocate chips and crispy cruchies as toppings , a mango mousse and a pineapple fruit cake . I didn't particularly like their fruit cake. Other than that everything else was nice , especially the starters. This is one of the best budget buffets in town and they serve good quality food regardless of the day you go. Will definitely visit them again.

Situated at the well known mall of Mani square, this restaurant is situated at the top floor of the building. The restaurant serves only Chinese cuisine. We went for lunch. It was little bit surprising to me as the manager said that they only have the option of buffet and there is no option of Ala carte menu. Left with no option we had to go for buffet, but it was worth it to me. There was a wide option of menu laid out for non veg as well as veg people. The starters were served on the table and were refilled as soon as our platters were empty. The flavors were real good and fresh. The main course was available with option of rice or noodles, with gravy option of chicken and prawn. The Datsun in the dessert and the mousse just took away my breath. All in all i enjoyed the food thoroughly. 

One striking thing to me was the ambiance, it not at all went with the theme of the restaurant. The ceiling especially looked horrible as if no efforts were put to make that look better. Although the staffs were very courteous and helpful, but i guess the dining experience could have been better in a better ambiance. 

For people who love Chinese cuisine, MUST try here for once.

LOCATION--Located on the top floor of mani square is quite a nice place. Their buffet meal is @‚Çπ575. We have visited haka on a sunday for their lunch buffet.  

STARTERS--Coming to the food they have served us three non veg starters which were meat balls, drums of heaven and chilli crab. The meat balls were very tasty and the crab tasted nice. The drums of heaven wasn't good enough. They also had few other veg starters which were not tried. 

MAINS--Moving to the maincourse, the section was starter+new items. So it was a repeat of the exact items tried moments back plus some few more. The newer items in the non veg section had fish in mustad sauce, shrimps, and a dish made out of chicken and chashewnuts. They also had fried rice and noodles. The veg section too had some additions. They also two variants in the soup section, salads, sauces, and papads. 


DESSERTS--The dessert section did fill our hearts. They had mini cupcakes, mousse(vanilla and strawberry), another sweet dish, four variants of ice cream(vanilla,mango,strawberry and chocolate) and the toppings section had hot chocolate sauce, choco chips, crushed butterscotch and jello.

It was a nice buffet meal at this budget. Overall a nice place to visit and offers a friendly environment. Refer to my account for pictures.

Cost : 450/- for non veg.  and unlimited pepsi at rs 39/-
Staff behaviour : Good. Fast. 
Food: 
Chicken sweet corn soup- soo tasty. Perfect. 
2 non veg starter-  chicken drums of heaven in hunan sauce was   hard.. not good. 1/5;  meatball in Manchurian sauce was good.. 3/5.
2 veg starter- very very good.  Veg starters were better than non vegs.  corn cube was damn tasty  and a sweet spicy tangy and saucy  fried vegetable were there... which was amazing.   Both 4/5. 
Main course :
Chilli chicken-  good. Fish- good and soft.
Egg fried rice- average. Chicken noodles - i haven't tried.

Darshan-  was good.  4/5. 
4 flavours of ice cream  with chocolate sauce, Choco chips. And crushed 'peanuts and hard honey'. One more greeny toppings.

Being a chinese cuisine lover, this was the place I went to for a lunch buffet.
1. Ambience- Amazingly decorated, vibrant colours. Made me feel as if I am sitting in some resraurant of China itself.
2. Service- They treated us in a nice way. Polite and helping waiters, well behaved too.
3. FOOD- The most important part. Well, they provided starters and soup on the table but main course was to be taken from the buffet. Chicken sweetcorn soup, manchurian chicken balls, drums of heaven and crispy veggies were given to us. I loved every dish although drums of heaven felt a little stiff.
For the main course we had noodles rice, chilly chicken and hunan fish.
Desserts had ice creams, darsaan, cheesecake and mouse. All tasted perfect.
I felt the fish was little undercooked, and the waiter took a great interest as to understanding how could things be improved.
Moreover, good experience.

Every dish was lip smacking starting from the soup to the desserts! I loved the small and cute veg dumplings! But its a place strictly for the Chinese and continental cuisine lovers!

We went there last week for a buffet.. The interior decor will give you a marvellous feeling. The ambience is also nice.. Coming to the food.. The starters were nice except the drums of heaven.. We felt that it was too dry and the flesh wasnt so soft and juicy.. The main course were average. The fried rice had an odd smell.. The very odour that comes from the rice which kept for a long time. Hakka noodles was nice. Szechwan chicken was not at all spicy. Instead it was a very light gravy with some chicken pieces. The chef's special fish was good.. Comparatively the desserts were nice. The mousse was of banana flavour which personally I don't like. The dessert of the day was awesome. There were ice cream of 4different flavours.. The were truly nice. In a nutshell I must say that the food were so so. Nothing special in them. Yes, undoubtedly they provide the cheapest buffet in town, but I think they must put some stress in their preparation of the dishes..

If you are a foodie, this the "The Place" that you are looking for. It's quite affordable as the amount of food we had for 500 was really something that would be hard to find in other restaurants. Starting with the soup the starters were awesome specially "drums of heaven". Other than than there were a lot more. Then the main course as i must say was a little disappointing compared to the starters and dessert. Now coming to the dessert there were 4 types of ice cream mousse tart and a whole lot of toppings like hot chocolate sauce,chocochips, jelly and much more. I have been at haka twice and I would not mind vising the place again and again.

Location- Mani Sqaure. Easily located on the top floor

D√©cor and Ambience- the sitting arrangement are done aptly to maximise the accommodation. The interior is neither too bright nor too dull. The tables are well managed and are kept clean soon after the customers leave. The ambience is cozy and warm. There's a constant buzz of people and you'll hardly find the place empty.

Food- The main attraction, buffet for ‚Çπ450. It's a steal for those who love gorging on chinese food. Spend hours munching on friend chicken wantons and yum desserts. I personally donot like the noodles, for me they are really bland to taste. Otherwise food is awesome!

Service and Staff- the staff here are very friendly and behave very well with all customers. They're always ready to help you. The food is kept warm and periodically refilled as the starters tend to finish up really fast. 

Overall this place is a favourite one for me. Spending time with family or friends, haka is a great option. üòç

Buffets are all-you-can-eat food for a set price. But the question here is; how affordable is the set price? It is definitely not acceptable to spend a lump sum of money at one go, especially when spending every pie does make a difference. So we need to very carefully decide whether what we get is a value for what we pay.
                                                                ...

It's located on the top floor at Mani square. It's a bit smaller than their outlet in salt lake and it gets crowded and very loud during weekends. 
It's known for its buffet which is quite pocket friendly. 
They usually serve the starters Nd soup at the table. Their starters are very tasty. They serve the usual chicken ,fish ,rice Nd noodles for the main course. 
The dessert section could have more variety.
It's a good option to try out if ur at Mani square.

The ambience was good. The service rendered was perfect. We had the lunch buffet. In the starters we had chicken wantons which were so crispy. The chicken drumsticks were so succulent  and also we had chicken soup which was so tasty. Next we had kimchi in salads which was different, chicken chowmein, chicken and egg fried rice,  good fish good chicken but the main course could have been better and the taste could have been better. And last but not the least the desserts were mouth watering. We had mousse which was fully creamy where we could add chocolate chips nd Choco sauce from our@ own. There was four types of ice cream ,the flavours were chocolate,  Mango,  strawberry and vanilla. On the whole it was a nice experience. @

The menu at haka mani square is the same as that of city centre.
They have a veg and a non veg soup.
Followed by the salads.
Then there are starters.
Usually they have fried wantons or dumplings along with dry chilly chicken or chicken drumsticks.
The starters are good. I love the dumplings. They are mini but taste amazing.
In the main course they have rice and noodles along with fish and chicken.
And dessert consists of ice cream, darshans and either a souffle or custard or cake.
They need to up there game now as a lot of restaurants are offering similar buffet for the same price but with better options.
But still this place remains close to my belly :p
Will I visit again- Yes. Definately.

Coming to food they had a wide variety of food to choose from! The most noteworthy mention is their mousse in the desert section! It was an absolute rocker! All other dishes were good as well! But the wonton did not live up to my expectations! Other than that the place was a great hit! üòá Apart from the buffet menu we also ordered shelled apples, forbidden punch and a mango ice based drink üçπ   They all tasted well as well!

This is undisputedly the most value for money buffet in town. At 450 bucks per person you can't really ask for more.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The ambience is good and so is the service. Coming to the food I must say what they have to offer in the starters and desserts department is absolutely amazing, but the main course fails to impress. After trying out the various dishes I went back to the starters for them to contribute most towards my lunch.

FINAL VERDICT- The buffet at Haka is definitely worth trying out for any foodie and if value for money is what you're looking for, then you will surely not be left disappointed.

One of my friend gave his birthday treat at haka, mani square. It was lovely experiencing a buffet only @575 still they need to improve on their main course.
The starters consisted of drums of heaven, crab, momo, fried wanton, and a chicken sweet corn soup.
All tasted good except the momo which we all felt that it only consisted of cabbage leaves and nothing else. Though it was written chicken sweet corn soup but it contained very little amount of chicken.
Now coming to the main course there was chicken hakka noodled which was okayish in taste and egg fried rice which was blunt in taste. Apart from that there was chicken, fish and prawn which were average in taste and nothing special. 
But the dessert won our heart. There was mousse, darsan, four flavours of ice cream and mango pastry... everything were very nice to eat.
So the main thing is that starters and desserts were the only best things in the buffet. The staffs were courteous and helpful.

Haka is a great place if one is looking for an affordable Chinese buffet with fairly delicious food. Their buffet comprising of one soup, a couple of veg and non veg starters, salads, noodles, fried rice, a fish dish, a chicken dish (in the non veg section) and assorted desserts is value for money. All the dishes including the desserts tasted good. Loved the chicken drumsticks and veg sui mai. However I wish they had included a couple of dishes in the main course and starters, but then again it costs around ‚Çπ500 per head. There is also an offer of paying ‚Çπ65 extra for a 8pcs prawn dish in a sauce of your choice.  The unlimited soft drinks offer is valid only for lunch.

Haka has been around for quite sometime now and it shows on the furniture which looked worse for wear somewhat. However the ambience is good, great for a family outing or meal with friends. The service is satisfactory. Overall, it's a good place for affordable and tasty Chinese food.

can't write a fresh and solid review. More or less the review is quite similar apart the 1000+.¬†First of all this a very pocket friendly Chinese outlet in a popular city mall. Though the variety of food item (Buffet) is less but according to their price you will exit the place with a big smile.Starter (5-6 items) are much tastier than the main course (5-6 items).Desserts are too good. finally good ambient, Decent atmosphere and no extra Tax to Paid for Buffet.Ok. Must Try..

Visited this restro last week. Having visited the other Haka outlet at City Centre I felt the service here was comparatively slow and the number of items were also less. For example, my father has ordered whiskey with starters, but despite reminding the waiter 3-4 times, the whiskey was not served. When it did arrive finally... the starters were nearly over and we had to go for a second round of starters. Mocktails served were too big for one person... I was unable to finish mine :D. In the starters crab was served instead of prawn. Main course was ok.... and the deserts were heavenly as usual :)

Craving for chinese food landed me here. Chinese is my all time love. Heard a lot about this outlet of haka and boom i landed there. They have the best of staffs...always ready to help.They offer the best chinese buffet in the lowest price. They had chicken drumsticks which are my favourite from haka's buffet , veg dimsums did not impress me...chicken wontons were okay, crispy veggies again won my heart.I have never been a soup lover..but their manchow soup was good.For main course they had chicken noodle, chicken fried rice,chilli chicken and chef's choice fish(basa fish).The noodle was love but I did not taste the fried rice so no comments but that must be good as well. Chilli chicken was good but basa again made me fall for it. Their dessert section is the best, they had mango mousse, daarsan, chefs special cakes, which were probably caramel and coffee, and four flavours of ice cream.All in all a must visit, pocket friendly.

Although always crowded, the service is prompt.
I would suggest them to work on their main course though.
Desserts are good. We were served shrimps too that day.

Overall a nice place with good service. 
The starters are extremely good specially the chicken drumsticks. 
In the main course the haka noodles and the fish preparation was pretty good. 
At last the ice-cream with different types of topping is delicious. Specially the chocolate ice-cream with chocolate sauce and choco-chips. 
Resonable price. 
Good place for spending some good times with friends and family.

They also have a desert counter where you can make your own ice-cream of any flavour with a wide variety of toppings. The drinks were also great. Service was very top-notch.

Went there yesterday with my brother and his girlfriend to celebrate my brother's birthday. We opted for the non veg lunch buffet along with one plate of prawn in hunan sauce for the added price of Rs. 69 + tax and unlimited refills of pepsi for Rs. 39 + tax. A good deal indeed.
About the food, to clarify at first, I am not a great connoisseur of fine dining experiences so the review is based on that basis. Infact this was my first buffet and I found it good enough to meet my expectations. I have heard that the variety in Haka is less compared to other buffets in the city however I think, so is the price, so one cannot really complain. The starters are served at the table remaining items are self serviced. We were first served a chicken soup (sweet corn chicken soup if I remember correctly). Soup was good enough, I am a soup person so maybe expected it to be a lttle thicker but what was served was definitely not bad. There were two types of chicken starters and the prawn was served as a starter which we had as an add on to the buffet. I loved the prawn dish. The prawn was succulent and soft and cooked with perfection blending with the hunan sauce. The chicken items were good but nothing special. I found the main course better than the starters. The chow mein was quiet tasty and the fried rice was good enough. There were prawn crackers too. The sides included a chicken and a fish item. I liked the fish item better but the chicken was nice too. Coming to the deserts. There was darsan which I didn't have, a mousse which was super yummy and not too sweet, a bread pudding which was great and four flavours of ice cream with choice of toppings.

The service was really good, the manager visited our table a few times to ask if we were enjoying our meal. The waiting staff were efficient and polite and removed the used plates and cutlery from the tables as soon as the course was done. The cold drinks refill is a good option coz they keep filling up your glass throughout the meal without having to call them to refill.

We went on a monday afternoon and the place was brimming with people. And was kind of noisy but I guess you can't blame the restaurant for that. There was a huge led television that was broadcasting cricket so sports enthusiasts might like that.

Overall a definite thumbs up from me and hope to visit again.

At last the deserts which was short but compact gave me a soothing experience in this outlet.

This Indochinese restaurant provides lots of tasty foods to make your day. In fact they provide buffet in minimum cost (450/- each person for buffet lunch). I visited the place 2 days ago for lunch buffet, nonveg. As the menu was limited I concentrated on my favorite foods much üòäüòä.  Veg, chicken, fish, noodles (2 types), rice (2 types), soup (2 types), 2-3 types of salads, ice creams, mousse, chocolate chips and many more, I can't remember all. I must say the person named Prasant  is very polite and helpful. I want to visit this place again.

I heard a lot about this place and I tried their buffet only. This place is located in Mani Square. They serve you Chinese delicacies which are really good in taste. They serve you limited items but the quality of the food is good. It's a pocket friendly place with good management. All in all definitely a good place to go for a meal.

Its a cheap chinese buffet, and thats about it.
The place is nice,well lit and spacious. But they had a tv which was playing cricket and that kind of spoils the mood. 
The service was not upto the mark at all. My family and I went there this monday for lunch and the guy who was supposed to give us a table kept us waiting for 10 mins even though the place was nearly empty.
They also take really long to restock the food.
Now for  starters they had chicken soup, wafers, chopsuey, drums of heaven, kimchi and wanton. The soup was nice and tasty. But the wanton was a let down. It was cold,soft and soggy. Personally among the starters the drums of heaven was my fav. The spices were well balanced and the chicken was soft and tender.
I was disappointed to find no crabs or prawn on the menu even though I heard they serve crab legs. Guess thats only on weekends.
Now in the main course were egg noodles,chicken fried rice,chili chicken and schezwan fish.
Both the noodles and rice were good. Both had loads of egg or chicken and cooked with little oil.
But the chili chicken was dull,had no taste and for some reason was loaded with black pepper. The fish on the other hand was too salty. The main was a big letdown
For desert they served darshan,mousse,chocolate cake and 4 flavours of oce cream. The darshan was nice but the star of the entire lunch was the mousse.
It was freaking amazing. The ice cream was ordinary.

I went to haka few days back for lunch..previously also I have gone over there with my friends..both the times the menu was same...the starters were good..it includes soup ,chicken drumsticks,momos and few other dishes..they should include some complementary drinks along with the starters..Main course includes chicken noodles,fried rice,fish manchurian,chicken manchurian etc..taste was ok..but it could be much better in terms of taste as well as presentation..there is no variation..every time u will get the same kind of dishes which shows their lack of innovation..Dessert was fine..but at least one more item should be included in dessert..all over the experience was average not as good as it was expected..at the end generally they give a paper to take the opinions of the customers about the food and the service..but the main twist is that you can't write it according to your choice and if you have tick the column of average then you are definitely in a big trouble..because they will come and force you to tick in the column of something better than the@ average..they don't understand the differences between poor and average..they think poor= average..at the end they will ask you to write about ur suggestions if you have given them average mark..thats all..both the times same thing happened to me and my friends..anyway if i will talk about the food then you can say it's an average quality of food and you can go over there for 1/2 times..

Craving for Chinese buffet??  I dont think this is the right place. Though many people say its worth the price (approx 500 inclusive of tax), it is not. The starters are okeyish, only the chicken drumsticks were good and the best part of the entire buffet. The main course is not even satisfactory. But if one is luck, he/she can get a chocolate moose in the menu otherwise the desert is also just satisfactory. 
Buffet not recommended but can try the normal menu.

I wanted to try the buffet here for a long time, we went there for dinner on a Thursday evening, and surprisingly it was house full on a weekday night. We went for the buffet, which was like okey, 499 inclusive of taxes.  Variety was less, main course tasted better than starters.. one minus thing, they didn't have any complementary drink in the buffet.  One time go for me. And it's an Indian Chinese food..

Haka is a great place for hanging out with friends. The ambience is so lovely. There is so much to eat at the buffet.the starters especially drums of heaven amd chicken dumplings are heavenly along with the soup. Though i liked the noodles more than fried rice. The preparations of fish ,chicken and shrimps were just perfectly cooked. The dessert section was even better. Starting with darsan to mousse and ice creams ...the experience was just wonderful. after that day i have visited haka for a number of times. I love this place.

One of the most economic buffets in town serving a three course meal .

Went there yesterday afternoon.Tried and tasted most of them .The starters were good and so were the main course but could have been better .The chicken in the starters were a bit smelly and hard .The prawns (add rs 65 /plate in choice of sauce) were delectable .In the main course the fish could have been better . The rest were perfectly okay . But the show stealer was the desert...The mousse ( strawberry and pine apple) ,the bread and butter pudding , darsan ,ice creams and condiments were absolutely sinfully heavenly . Couldn't have asked for me .
The 4 points is solely for the desert :)

However who complains when you get to eat a sumptous meal in just 450 bucks along with unlimited Pepsi.

Not up to the mark. Make sure you don't lose out to your competitors just because you don't end up putting enough efforts.

Lack of options. The Chinese flavor is quintessentially missing in all the dishes.

The place which I frequent the most in Kolkata due to a cheap buffet at a price of just 432/-

At this price, you get a non veg/veg soup, prawn crackers, chicken drumsticks (which are rather floury but... well... who's complaining), chicken wontons/sui mais, two veg starters, chicken fried rice and noodles with their vegetarian counterparts and three gravy items in non-vegetarian - Chicken fish and prawn. Weekends also have a crab starter with these.
There are also  a trio of vegetarian gravy dishes.

For desserts, there is chocolate mousse, two types of cakes, brownies, as well as four different types of icecream with three types of toppings for them.

The cheap price and a moderately passable taste makes this the best option if you want to fill your stomach without making your pockets empty.

Visited this place again today and absolutely loved it again!
The most pocket friendly buffet in the city! The starters are the main attraction with variety of options! They are delicious as well! Starters included chicken hot and clear soup,chicken dimsums(my personal favorite),drums of heaven,grilled potato,veg Manchurian! We added 8pc prawn with hunan sauce with just rs.78 and it was too delicious!
Main course has little variation with egg fried rice,chilli chicken and a fish item! The fish was so soft and juicy!
And in the dessert section,the mango sliced cake was absolutely yummy! I still can't get over it!
Soothing ambience and very friendly staff and they actually had smiling face and doesn't just awkwardly stare! Overall,lovely place and would visit again for sure!

Cheap authentic Chinese food screams the name of Haka anyday.Visited this place innumerable times.Recently took a home delivery for Stir fried mixed meat noodles and Prawn in Oyester sauce.I expected the Prawn gravy to be savory but it was kind of a mix of sweet and salty which was a littlr wierd.But again,fresh big sized juicy prawns.Also the chilly sauce they serve as a side is my favourite.Another thing you must try from here is their lamb.Haka sereves the best lamb in town.

We went for a Sunday dinner last night. The place was full @ 8pm. We opted for buffet. I was pretty disappointed to see that they decreased number of food items in menu. Though the food is still tasty as earlier. There were 2 types of chicken, soup and Crab in starters. I just loved the pepper chilli crab. Main course was same as earlier - noodles, rice, fish, chicken and shrimp. Dessert was not good. Only the cake was eatable.

I went there to attend a private party on a Saturday evening. As expected there was a long que outside, waiting for tables. So if you are planning to visit on weekends, do drop in little early.

The buffet starters options had Dimsums, 1 chicken preparation and 1 Crab preparation. Little disappointing!

The main course spread was good. It had fish, prawn, chicken and vegetarian options.

The Dessert options were far too less again. Though we didn't expect to be spoilt for choices, however here we could hardly make any choice.

The food tasted good. Don't miss the Chicken soup, dimsums, prawns and the mango creme dessert.

Service is good.

Failed to meet expectations and standards, as opposed to its Saltlake counterpart.

Buffet seemed well laid out, but taste was not up to the mark. Infact, its a waste to try buffet here.Strange, but despite being under the same franchise, the quality is drastically opposite to that of Haka,CC.

Haka is a chinese buffet restaurant in Mani Square. I opted for non-veg buffet so no idea about the veg part.As starter Chicken clear soup, Drums of heaven and momo have been offered; I loved ¬†drums of heaven- it was succulent and a bit spicy(had almost 10 pieces). Momo and soup were upto the mark.
There was another dish of crab which I didn't try but my girlfriend said it was tasty; so it might be delicious too.
Main course was good.. noodles, rice, a dish of chicken, fish and shrimp respectively. They should have offered a few more dishes.. Choices are not plenty.
And in dessert as usual ice cream, with chocochips and cheesecake were present.
¬†
The food they were offering was good and I liked it but choices were not plenty,they ought to include some more dishes in the menu.

full point to the ambience and service.

However the dessert section should be mentioned here as it was the only best part of the buffet. All in all, this place is worth a single visit in my opinion.

The gravies were slightly bland and the chicken (b/l) a bit tough. The noodle lacked that X-factor but was good otherwise. The pastry and cake were excellent though. Overall, I'd say value for money at 431 & 476.

Don't eat here on weekends though, as my general rating would have been 4, had I not experienced lower quality food last Sunday, compared to weekdays I've eaten here before.

Had yesterday off so we decided to try this budget buffet place. 
We arrived at 1 pm and opted for non-veg buffet.
They serve the soup and starters, main course is self-serving. 

You can add unlimited soft drinks at Only 39/- so better go for it because in other places they charge around 90 bucks for the same. 

Starters : 
1. non-veg soup, don't remember the name (2.5/5) maybe because I'm not really a fan of it. When asking if they have any other kind of soup the waiter said he would ask the chef, but I wasn't much interested in soup so I let it go. 

2. Chicken dimsums (4.5/5) they were they best starter item so we got two more plates. Wanted another plate but decided against it in favor of making space for main course, regretted it later.

3. Fried wontons (2/5) least favorite

4. Drums of heaven (3.5/5) didn't order more of it in favor of dumplings. 

Main course : 

1. Egg fried rice (2.5/5) not good not bad 
2. Noodles (3/5) okayish but better than fried rice 
3. Hot garlic chicken (3.5/5) 
4. Fish item wasn't good either. (3/5)

That's it. Basically their main course isn't their "main" focus. Its always the starter and desserts that steal the show. 

Desserts: 
Apart from vanilla, chocolate and mango ice creams the chocolate mousse cake was the best (4.5/5). I didn't try the darsan. Mango cheese cake was okay (3.5/5) 

Honestly, despite their main course being a big let down, their starters and desserts are bang for buck and I didn't feel that much disappointed. Those dimsums are still calling me back. 

Ambience : 3.5/5 
Seating : 4/5 
Food : 3.5/5 
Staff : 4/5 
Pocket pinch was 1000 bucks for two and totally  justified.

I have visited both the outlets. Both are equally fabulous. The CC1 outlet serves a la carte as well as buffet. But we had had the former. The food was out of this world. The fried rice is the best in town. & the claypot chicken with chillies & basil was outright insane. The other foods were fab too. And i don't even know how to start about the Mani Square outlet. It serves only buffet. But it is the best buffet in Kolkata (keeping in mind the number of items, the taste & the price). I visit that place whenever i can.

The Haka lunch buffet is always a good option for a hungry stomach. The place is quite spacious and neatly decorated. Their starters consisted of manchow soup, chicken fried wanton, chicken drumstick, sui mai, French fries, prawn wafers etc; two types of noodles, rice, chicken and veg sides etc in main course; and darsaan with three flavors (chocolate, vanilla, mango) of ice-cream in the dessert section. 
Keeping the price in mind, this food quality and the variety of items served is very rewarding. 

And yes..one of the days when we visited, they had this great offer of refilling our soft drinks glasses numerous times. Such kind of offers during the summers would be more than welcoming.

This is located at the top floor of the Mani Square Mall , we tried their lunch buffet .. 
They have 3items for starters and 4 items for the main course , starters were tasty ,though I didn't liked the main course ..specially the noodles .. but loved all the desert items , and I must say they don't have much option in any of the three course . 
Staffs are courteous and..
This place is good amount for the money ..

This is one of my favourite restaurants. I love the food here and I visit this place very often. My favourite dishes include chicken fried wontons, chicken drumsticks, chicken sui mais, and almost all the non vegetarian dishes. This restaurant has very good staff members and they ensure that their customers are comfortable and they go home with a full stomach. The prices are absolutely worth the food that is served here. Among the desserts, my favourite is the chocolate mousse. It's so yummy!
Haka has been consistently serving amazing food and the behaviour of the staff here is extremely courteous. I can assure you that no matter what you order from here, you'll be very happy with the quantity, taste as well as the quality of the food.
In case it's your birthday, they can get a cake for you too.
To sum it up, I love this place.

Today I went to Haka, Mani square. It is just on the top floor of the mall opposite Chapter 2. They provide buffet with this really cheap price. The items taste really good. Yes its true that they don't have that much variation of items in buffet still in Rs 450 (approx) you can't complain and ask for more. The ambiance is really nice. The staffs are really well behaved. I loved the deserts( darsan, cheese cake, ice creams and mousse). You should definitely give it a shot if you are looking for good food at cheap price.

Located at the top most floor of manisquare it is quite easy to locate it.
We went there for Valentine's day lunch.
The place has good color combination and on that day they decorated the place with balloons.
They served us wine which was pretty good.
The food was served hot and they were perfect in taste.
Also we can't miss out on their deserts..
I loved their chocolate ice cream with choco chips and chocolate sauce.
There was another mango flavoured ice cream with green sauce which was just the best.
If you want a Chinese buffet in proper budget,this place should be in your bucket list.

This is my 2nd visit to Mani square, Haka. First time I had no Zomato app, and also it was also not worthy. So I was bit hesitant this time. But this time it did surprisingly well. Food was really good, distinctively flavoring with different Chinese sauces. Items that need to be mentioned were chiken dumplings, shrimps and spicy chicken. Noodles was flat which was helpful.
In dessert there was not much variation but ice cream was good and also the ginger pudding.
What I expected and should be included in the menu is a complementary drink. Otherwise it was a tasty experience.
Good times passed in Haka.
My thumbs up.

Located at the topmost floor just opposite to Chapter 2 at Mani Square Mall. The decor and ambience on the occasion of Valentine's Day turned to be gorgeous and we were lucky to get a seat as soon as we entered. We went for the special buffet menu for lunch. We were served with Chicken Sweetcorn Soup at our table and the service turned out to be amazing. Really, the staff deserves to be applauded. Coming to the food, the buffet menu was enormous and we had a huge journey from the starters to the desserts. The veg items along with the non-veg ones were delicious just as the other. The starters are something which will make you want for more and more especially the Chicken Lollipop , the tasty Dimsums and the Fried Crabs. Food quality is absolutely top knotch. The main course left us dumbstruck as we were in a dilemma to choose among the many delicacies. Chicken Noodles, Chicken Rice along with One Fish, One Shrimp and One Chicken Side dish was great and left us craving for more. Coming to the desserts, Ice cream( Mango/Strawberry/Chocolate/Vanilla), Darsan, Mousse Cake along with Chocochips, Chocolate sauce and another Sauce (green) turned to be excellent. Fresh Lime Soda which we ordered were good too. Price is absolutely pocket-friendly. The Manager is friendly and courteous. Everything seemed to be on point. On occasion of Valentine's Day, we also received two chocolates from them too.

I assure that one would not be disappointed with Haka for sure. Recommended.

Visited during the pujas and only buffet was available then, so tried out their lunch buffet. Their buffet didn't have way too much of an option. Hardly 4-5 items for starters and main course each. Nevertheless, i loved whatever they served, especially the wantons. Very crisp and stuffed properly. Also, loved the desserts that were available. Nothing over the top, simple ones. The staff were courteous. And the place is good amount for the money.

Visited this place with my colleagues for lunch. Liked the ambience. Foods were good but not the best. We had Chicken baby corn soup, Chicken drums of heaven, Chicken deep fried dish (can't recall the name) and 2 veg dishes in starters. In main course we went for buffet. Options were very limited in buffet- crispy noodles, chicken noodles, 1 rice dish, 1 fish dish(with gravy), 1 chicken dish(with gravy). In desserts there were small pastry, custom made ice cream (ingredients were delicious) and 1 sweet crispy dessert (can't recall it but i enjoyed it). Service was good. In my overall experience I enjoyed starters and desserts more than main course.

I have been planning to visit this place for several years now, but for some reason or the other, I haven't been able to. I suppose all this wait had built up too much expectation in my mind about the place, because I was not exactly satisfied. I was expecting amazing food. It was a buffet, so there's nothing to say about the quantity, but the taste of the food was just above average. Starters, sea food and chicken mains, desserts - all average and run of the mill. Even the cocktails did not seem to have sufficient quantity of alcohol, because even after downing two glasses, there was no discernible buzz. The only thing good was the plate of dumplings - tiny, adorable chicken and corn dumplings, that melt in the mouth. But paying for a whole buffet meal might just be a little too much if the only option is to fill up on dumplings.

Haka is all good for a Non Vegan !
Being a Vegan getting a varieties is tough so, here, was happened we gone for a Dinner Buffet but both of my two Non Vegan friend happy with variety but I'm certainly not. So I'm giving it a 3 because of the taste and Quality. One more bad thing is that we have been there @8:30 so they were little late to fill up the food Chafing of Veg dishes. One Good and Awesome why I give it a 3 just because of the dessert and I'm quite happy with the variety.

This place has been around for years and almost everyone must have had dined in here at least once. What got me to write this review today is the drop in its food quality and spread variety over the years. Perhaps the reason for this is the not much hike in buffet price. But that isn't a good enough reason for such changes. Was much disappointed in my latest visit to this place. Don't think will be dining here anytime in near future.

This is the second time I went to this Haka. I liked the food. The staff were well mannered and polite. Service was good too. But the reason I'll give only 2 as rating is that there was a cockroach by the dessert section of the buffet table. This is not expected from a place renowned Haka. The management definitely should pay more attention towards cleanliness.

Undoubtedly one of the best places in Kolkata for Chinese food, Haka offers the best buffet for Rs 483/- only. Their starters are the best for sure and the price includes taxes and desserts. They serve 4 flavours of ice creams, which is the most you can get at that price.
BONUS?
IF it's your birthday, they give you a cake and free complimentary drinks!
You won't find a single reason that should stop you from coming here. :)
I was extremely happy with the staff behaviour.
Amazing!

Went here today for lunch(unexpected, as we were supposed to go to another place). The place was full however we did not have to wait(2 of us). Food quality was average-good.Numbers of appetizers and starters were 3 (can't complain coz the price is also low as per buffet prices in other eateries). 

Liked all the items except the egg rice and fish. The noodles and the chicken dish in the main course would allow you to overlook the other two items mentioned above.

In the desert section again I felt that nos of items were less but again can't complain. The strawberry pudding, caramel truffle and ice creams(vanila with chocolate sauce, mango, strawberry, chocolate) were present in the desserts section. I liked all(did not taste chocolate and strawberry ice creams).

What I felt worthy to be mentioned were the behaviours of the waiter and manager and their prompt response to our demands. They were constantly asking if we were liking the food or not. So really appreciate their gestures.

Total price was Rs 1082 after applying taxes.
So it is definitely worthy of a visit for it's low priced buffet.

Buffet price is reasonable.Not too much.
Chinese food is really delicious.Chicken drumstick and momo is just wow.
If u r a ICICI BANK CARD HOLDER then Carry it and pay by it then u will get FREE MOCKTAIL.That too awesome.
One fish item is there.I don't like that.Fish lover may like it.4 flavourd ice creams and cake is also good..
Must visit this.

I visited this place four days earlier with family. amazing buffet with Chinese cuisine . The starters were too good . The baby corn and baked fish and the salads were just awesome. We kept craving for more shrimp and the fish item .
And dessert in a buffer always remains my main target , and I didn't get disappointed at all. The brownie with mousse and hot chocolate were to die for . the Darshana was simply heaven .
Food 5/5 and hospitality 5/5 . the only thing that can be improved is that the place is bit crowded so the privacy wasn't there .

A good place that give you the fine dining feel within a budget. Service is prompt. The waiters are courteous. The day we visited the place, it was lunchtime and moderately crowded. The starter was great, but unfortunately the main course was not up to the mark at all. ¬†The desert was also underwhelming. For two people, the pocket pinch was around Rs.1100. Granted it's a buffet, and the quantity is not a question, but for that price, we should have gotten better quality.

Looking for a buffet in Kolkata and not finding a place which fits your pocket, Haka is the place. 

Visited the place on my last trip to Kolkata. 
The place has an easy going and bright ambience which offers good quality food, alcohol and hookah. While you can have alcohol with the food, hookah can only be smoked in a separate hookah room which is upstairs. Also, they have handful of tables and it takes time to get a table for a big group. 

Food was good with a three to four kind of starters of vegetarian and non-vegetarian starters. However, main course was purely non vegetarian. They also had three kinds of dessert which to be honest were a let down. 

The place is good but inadequate sitting space and incapability of housing multiple big groups simultaneously makes me give a rating of 3/5.

One of my favorite budget restaurant. Though the buffet cost has been increased at high percentile in just one year.

Ambiance is good for both couples & large family dinner.

They are having a lot of options in their menu which can satisfy all kind of taste buds.

Excellent behavior by the stuffs.

Optional hard drink can add the pleasure of having the dinner with a glass full of alcohol!!

Being a food lover I used to try foods from different Restaurants. I visited Haka@Manisquare with one of my friend for dinner. It is a place for Chinese food lovers complementing with some awesome deserts. I just loved the foods over there besides it is very pocket friendly. Also got a complementary offer from ICICI Bank, a blue -lagoon drink. The restaurant is on the top floor of Mani Square. The Buffet Dinner price was 900/- for two people. I would recommend food lovers to be there and experience some good foods from there. Let's come to sectional reviews....

Food: Food quality is awesome worth of your money . The deserts are also nice to soothe your test buds. I loved all the foods I choose to have there specially the Chicken Drumsticks and Salads. You can start with soup then starters and salads. There are different types of salads and starter are available for veg and non-veg both. I was almost full after the starter only. :p After I had noodles and some chicken and fish preparations for main course. I got only one fish preparation there. Then the desert section :) which was awesome and you can see lots of happy faces with their plates around the desert section and they are just not interested to leave the section. Ha ha...

            Service: The service quality is good and decent . The manger is very humble too. They are always there to serve you well as much they can. Though it was rush hour they were trying their best level.

            Ambiance: Due to heavy crowd it was full of happy faces. Some times they were even shouting that was bit disturbing.

This place is a letdown. Hands down!
I went there long back though ( writing this review very recently) .
The idea of Chinese/Japanese food has become so mainstream that they don't have much variety to offer here .

Quite a good place to visit. I liked the buffet menu. The chicken wantons were really good. In the main course I liked the prawns, even the rice and the hukka were tasty. There were a number of items. I guess the dessert could have been better both item wise and taste wise. Another point is that there were a lot of taxes added along with VAT and ST, I don't know for what. It was late and we had to rush back home so did not talk about this part. Except for these, all over a good experience

The dinner buffet had very few option just 2 non veg starters. The soup they served was very thin and not hot as well. The taste was also not great as per me and my companion.
The service and the staff were extremely nice and took great care while serving and even served a dish straight from the kitchen out of the evening's menu for my companion who was eating veg. The manager (forgot to ask his name) was very generous and hosted us well and on signing the review sheet(I gave less points) politely enquired for suggestions and  assured us of a better food on our next visit and complained for not asking him to get things customized for myself if I was not liking the food or had any other issues.
So for me the food (that evening) was not great but the service and ambience was good. So the points are mostly for the service. 
Will be visiting again.

I have checked into Haka for the first time after receiving good reviews and recommendations. But the restaurent could not impress me lot. We had buffet which costs 410 plus tax which is reasonable enough. The quantity and food quality were also fair. But it could satisfy my tastebud.... i had a feel of having the starters from any road side average restaurent... they were either too salty or tasteless... but the desserts were good... i had 6-7 pieces of pastries because i couldnt enjoy other items of buffet. I also ordered a mocktail 'peach mangifera' which was very tasty and refreshing. The service was very good... when i wrote about the poor taste of food in the suggestion note the person-in-charge who was very philanthropic apologized. I am not sure if i would visit the place.. but next time i go there i wont opt for buffet for sure.

The staffs are attentive and hospitality is appreciable... The chicken drumsticks were good, but lacks a bit of salt... You have to add by yourself... The deserts section is ok type... I wondered all the flavours were tasting almost the same.. Hahahaha... That's quite funny... Altogether nice place to visit... Will visit soon another day... üòä

Haka is a place for chinese food lovers..
Haka has always been in my favourite and top list preference when it comes for treating people for any occasion.
This outlet of specialty group is located at the top floor of Mani square mall.
As we all know specialty group gained their popularity from their first venture of Mainland China.
Even for Haka their focus was on such customers who are whiling to eat but in decent budgeting.
And especially this outlet serves terrific spread of buffet all day long,eat how much you want too without cutting your pocket heavily.
Staffs are courteous and service is fast..as this place attracts huge amount of crowd especially on weekends.
Food is pretty much decent won't say authentic chinese like Mainland China but decent enough for satisfying the taste buds.
Price is their main USP... pretty cheap and not at all heavy in your pocket.

Ever since I have developed strong affection for different cuisines , I remember how I used to hog day in and out till¬†now which has now transformed towards¬†more variety and versatility than having in huge quantity .¬†I was a student then and unlike any other student had very limited resource of money so used to search for budget places or may be a cheap buffet to suffice my hunger and passion. From then only the bonding ,the love and the passion was¬†realized within¬†and still that drives me to different destinations in the city of joy and beyond.
                                                                ...

Well, I am writing this review after my 17th visit to this place.
When you want Chinese with a touch of the Speciality Group(which also owns Mainland China,Sigree,Asia Kitchen,Machaan,Caf√© Mezzuna) and low on budget too, this should be your ultimate stop. This place has a new neighbour in Mani Square, Chapter 2  (course spread lacks variety and is not tempting.)
Except Haka no one can serve better Chinese buffet at a price of around 500 rupees(inclusive taxes). Haka has a new competitor in City Center 1 area(Since 2016),which is doing pretty well; but it is impossible to match Haka's standard and variety.
Haka has a well trained team working both in the kitchen and in the dining area. The manager is extremely courteous and the impressive part is the manager works in tandem with the entire team in serving or paying heed to any customer's demand and also keeps a check on the feedbacks provided by the guests.
When it's Chinese,it's Mainland China.
But, when you want to go easy on the pocket, it's Haka.

Haka at City Centre (Saltlake) is better than its twin in Mani Square.

P.S. you get a complimentary mocktail if you are a ICICI Bank card holder and unlimited soft drinks at a minimal price.

HAKA is a famous Chinese joint located inside the ManiSquare mall near Kankurgachi. They serve only buffet here and there is no option of a-la cart√©.
We were a group of 7 hungry boys who decided to celebrate the occasion of getting placed for our first job.
The lunch buffet starts here at 12.45 pm. It was a weekday and the price for weekday lunch buffet is rs 431 all inclusive. There were two add on options available with the buffet.. for rs 59+tax u could get 8 pcs of prawns and for rs 35+tax, u cud avail unlimited soft drinks of ur choice.
We chose the lunch buffet and the unlimited soft drinks option and our bill amounted to 477 per head inclusive of all.
The decor is preety good. It is spacious and resembles a high quality restuarant , although a bit more renovation and good arrangement of seats with bright lightning will  really gv this place a lift.
Coming to the food..
Starters:
1. Chicken surmai: it was lyk chicken dumplings. Tasted average. Nothing to brag about. It lacked flavor but had a pungent smell of minced chicken. Was moist. Not really a very tasty dish.
2. Chicken Drums of Heaven: crisp fried chicken tossed in a very delectable sauce. It was fantastic and tasted very good. Best dish offered..certainly their usp.
3.Chicken soup: average.with really tiny bits of chicken which seem negligible.
Starter and soup served on the table by servers and the repeats came quickly enough.
Main course :
Preety boring. Could not have much. The fried rice and the chowmein were preety average and bland. They had egg noodles and egg chicken fried rice as staple. There were fried veg wantons, chilli french fries, stir fried veggies, cottage cheese in veg while for nonveg they kept just a fish and a chicken dish. The fish was good and the chicken preety average.
The main dishes lacked variety and it was a disappointment!!
The desserts were limited but the darsan was really good. Mousse was okayish. Standard ice creams with hot chocolate sauce. Limited but good.
For the price, many ll say that they justify the buffet items. However mains need a little more variety and flavors. With so many buffet joints popping up every now and den, haka will face stiff competition.
USP is low cost and drums of heaven.
Typical indianized chinese is served. Dont xpct much.. average affair.. service was decent!!

The restaurant is okay if you want to fight your hunger.In case, you desire to spend quality time with quality food , there are chances that you may be disappointed in few cases.The hot and sour soup served was good but the sweet corn was a bit disappointing.The wonton rolls were a total betrayel as these did not taste up to the mark.The worst part was the time when we asked the manager about the taste of the food, he said calmly that it is the way things are prepared.Anyway, I do appreciate his effort in few concerns.Overall, you can go to this place once or twice and the rates are fine . However, I won't suggest this for a really good occasion

The very popular Chinese buffet eatery of our city but the food is not so great. We planned a Saturday lunch and managed to grab a seat in this overcrowded place. But seating and eating arrangements are alright and stuffs are very courteous just like other speciality restaurants. Started the course with a very flat chicken soup and two lovely mocktails. Starters consisted of fried chicken wantons and chilly pepper chicken: both of them tasted good.  Main course had everything from rice to noodles, fish to prawn, but only the prawn is worth mentioning. Being a sweet tooth, disappointed with the desert section too. Only Darshan with ice cream was great, its an all time favorite of mine. Overall a decent experience and worthy of a one time visit

Haka has one of the cheapest buffets in Kolkata which, though not as remarkable as that of barebeque nation or sigree is surely worth a try. They have varied options like crispy chilli baby corn, fish in hot garlic sauce, haka chilli chicken, drums of heaven hunan style, fried chicken, chicken hakka noodles, etc. Among all these, the drums of heaven and fish in hot garlic sauce are worth mentioning and easily the pick of the lot. The other dishes too are not very bland but again, not exceptional or impressive for that matter. There are limited options for desserts which consist of mainly different flavours of ice cream like chocolate, vanilla, mango and strawberry and a certain mousse but you have had those before somehwere else..so pretty mundane. The buffet is 450 per head, so if you want a fulfilling meal without burning a hole in your pocket..this is you place to be.

Went to this place for a weekday buffet. It is located on the 4 th floor of Mani Square Mall . The ambience, decor & staff courtesy was pleasing. Along with buffet they offer unlimited cold drinks @ Rs 35/- but we decided against it . They do not offer any welcome drink which is a bit of a dampener.
Soup : Chicken Hakka Soup & veg corn soup , both were ok .
Starters : Two veg & two non veg items were on offer . Chicken Hong Kong Style ( a type of DOH ) & chicken Siu Mai as non veg & veg wanton and another starter with potato as veg were served at table . The starters were ok though not outstanding.
Salads : Pickle cucumber & Kimchi , of the two Kimchi was very good .
Main Course : Veg fried rice with mushrooms , egg noodles & chicken fried rice were on offer , among them chicken fried rice was the best . Side dishes comprised of Vegetable in Parsley Sauce ( really good ) , corn & potato prepared in sauce , chicken in Oyster Sauce & Fish in Hot Garlic Sauce . Though I am mostly a non veg type of foodie still of all the dishes I enjoyed Vegetables in Parsley Sauce the most .
Desserts : Darsan , Mousse ( mint flavoured) & four types of ice creams ( vanilla , strawberry, mango & chocolate) made up the desserts & they were usual type .
Absence of any prawn or lamb item in either starters or in main course was a big miss .
At Rs 431/- per person ( including tax ) it is value for money but some more variety in buffet is always welcome even if it comes a bit costlier.

A buffet place that doesn't leave a hole in your pocket and is delicious too? Not many names would turn up inside your head. Haka has to be one of them. Lunch buffet is an absolute beauty in terms of pricing and food quality. Honestly I have never really seen anyone going to haka and having A la carte there. Should include an item of prawn, otherwise this place can fill your tummy to the fullest.

the food was good. Do not expect a huge buffet spread, because they do not have much options. A-la-carte would have been a good option, anyday after we choose the buffet, the baby corn was the only one worth mentioning, but then its the same alltogether. go early if u want quality over quantity

FOOD : The variety of food was limited and rather stale I would not say very delicious either. Starting with the starters the chicken wantons were good and drums from heaven did not do justice to its name. Haka noodles was not well spiced and rather dull and the Friedrice was malnourished and needed add-on like more vegetables and egg. This now brings us to the chicken and fish curry dully cocked in cornflour gravy greatly under spiced. The prawn curry was a hybrid of mustard curry and cornflour gravy very moderately giving hints of Bengali and Chinese in name only. We were done with our main course yet not sufficiently filed and forwarded to the desert section - Mousse was just baking creme with a flavour, bread and butter puddings were just simple walnut pastries and not pudding by any chance , and the only saviour were the 4 flavoured ice creams and chocolate sauce which saved the last tad bit of respect.

AMBIENCE : Rather crowded and not very homily nor peaceful and even lacks enough space to accommodate the stipulated number of guests they actually arrange for seating.

POCKET PINCH : Reasonable and at 543/- inclusive of taxes it is one of the more budget options. Thus, the price is the only stand point with a trade off that is variety and choices.

I would not say that it is"the" Chinese restaurant but it is definitely quite decent. I rate and review this place on the following basis :
1) AMBIENCE: Nice to look from inside. But it does not look very appealing from outside. The good part is that only the no. of people accommodated are inside and no more.
2) FOOD: Quality was quite nice. But as for Chinese cuisine the food was not as tasty as it looks and it was lacking spices. For me the main attraction would be the wonton dumplings. The rest of them are not anything special.
3) SERVICE: This is one thing that I particularly liked as the food stalls were refilled as soon as they were almost empty. Also the staff behaviour was very much appreciated by me as they served us immediately after asking.
4) POCKET PINCH: This part was the most amazing as for only Rs. 543 you are getting a decent Chinese buffet. Quite reasonable I would say in spite of the food tastes.

I was eagerly waiting to have the lunch buffet ova here, so i finally made it on aug 15th. They had special buffet menu on this day. But i was quite dissapointed with the food. This was the first time i was visiting Haka, so i cant compare with d food quility they had before. 
Coming to the food, the starters(Chicken drums of heaven n wanton) were tooo good in taste n quantity. Soup was okay.
Chicken noodles n egg fried rice was tasty. But the chicken, prawns n fish was aweful. I guess they used coconut to make the chicken curry. 
Lastly, the desserts were really good. They had 4 diff desserts. Darshan was v tasty. They also had ice creams(4 diff flavour).
Ambience was good. Service was indeed good. But when ot comes to food, it did nt match up to my expectation.

Its one of my favorite places to enjoy a buffet. Its pocket-friendly and they have a great variety of Chinese food to satisfy both veg and non-veg appetite. Haka's dessert section is good enough to please your sweet-tooth. The ambience is good and so are the staffs.
Overall, I always have a nice experience visiting this place.

The ambience needs some pump up, and the menu also needs a little more variety. The food quality is good but the variety is where it lacks. Love the fish preparation most.

First things first, the place was a bit small in space but overall the ambience was pretty cool. The family space was decent, while they had an attached bar cum dining space called Shack. 
Coming to the food, their speciality being Chinese was aptly justified. The food was great. The starters were okay. But the main courses were lip smacking. The noodle was as good as the Chinese prawn preparation or the chilly chicken. Yes, you might not like it as other expensive Chinese food chains like Big Boss, but then again, you can't say that the food tasted anything less than gut satisfying. 
Overall, if you compare the quality of food according to the price, you'll find that it's one of the best in it's category.

I have been here countless times because this is one place where you wont be disappointed because the menu is a sturdy one and the viffet is comparitively pocket friendly. The ambience is good. The service is prompt. 

Starters: A nice set of starter items. I love the cabbage and sweet cucmber n carrot salad. I avoid the lamb meat starter because its very boney. The chicken clear soup is creamy and tastey.

Main course: The haka noodles is good. So is the fried rice. But what I really like are the prawns, the two chicken items and the fish item . They are really equisite and spiced up. 

Dessert: I am not a big fan of their dessert section. They keep a darsaan ice cream and a cake or two which I usually skip. Their Ice creams are horrible. Need to improve the dessert department thoroughly.

Rate:6.8/10

Haka, Mani Square is undoubtedly a good place for a Chinese cuisine, and when you think about it, reasonably pocket friendly too. There's an array of delicacies on the buffet and the food is undoubtedly good and hot from the oven. Ambience is nice, staff is excellent in courtesy and very friendly and cooperative. However, it could really improve the fried rice of the buffet, and tweak around with the menu a bit more day to day. Overall, a nice place for pocket friendly lunch or dinner.

Had the dinner buffet at haka on a weekday. ¬†Fish in hot garlic sauce was really tasty and worth every bite. Chicken was also good, but i go to chinese buffets mainly to try out the fish, and luckily it was amazing. Even drums of heaven was good. I would have preferred more variety in desserts. Other than that it was good and tasty at a reasonable price.

Sunday buffet and Haka is a very cosy combo for Calcuttans. Starting with siu Mai, manchow soup, hong kong style drums of heaven and then going into black pepper shrimp, hot garlic chicken and mouthlicious noodles for main course. But it's high time that Haka should introduce some new items in their menu or else they will lose their repeat customers. The service of this place is always nice. In the drinks I tried orange and lemonade mocktail with orange chunks this time which was pretty nice.

Two days  ago I  went  for  my   birthday dinner with  two  of  my  friends !!!!   Initially  we  were  provided with corn  soup along  with  drums  of heaven  and  momos   !!!  The  starters were awesome  especially  the  drums of  heaven !!   Then  for  the main course   firstly  we  had  the  prawns  (  which  were  above  average )  !! Then  we  had another  fish  item  which  was   very  good  !! The  noodles  was quite  chilly and  bit  tangy  too   !!!!  Fried  rice was ok  !!! Chilly  chicken was good !!Veg  items were  also  present !!!! The  best  part of  the  diet  was the  dessert  !!!  The  musse and the  cake  was  simply  awesome  !!!! Finally the    4  types  of  ice  cream also  brought  a  very  good  ending to  the   whole  meal !!

Only  one  fallacy which  my  friend felt  that  there  were no  one  to  cooperate  while  taking the  food    from  the  main   buffet  !!  else  we  find the  service of  the  staff  good !!! Price ¬†is ¬†very ¬†reasonable ¬†and unlimited food . ¬†I ¬†will ¬†surely ¬†advise ¬†everyone ¬†to ¬†visit ¬†the ¬†restaurant , ¬†as we ¬†are ¬†getting ¬†a tummy ¬†filled and ¬†good ¬†quality ¬†food at ¬†a very ¬†low ¬†price !!

Just one word to express my feelings right now-WOW!!
It was sunday eve & we planned for Haka for my farewell party & trust me it was just mindblowing.Apparently I had planned several times to go there before but failed to make it out.
Thr interior is good,it's a specious place to dine-out.
Coming to food,we had opted for buffet dinner.
They offered us with,starters-chicken fried wanton & chicken-both of them are really tasty n i found not to be cheated with the chicken & batter ratio in both starters..‚Üí4/5
Next in main course rice & noodles both were ok.‚Üí3/5
As for side dishes,chicken was average in taste,i felt a lil bit of spicyness missing there.‚Üí3.5/5
Fish in hot garlic sauce was too tasty,perfectly cooked n spiced,‚Üí4.5/5
Oh the prawns,I love prawns n I can assure you that even if you aren't so fond of prawns so much then also you're going to love this dish!!‚Üí5/5.
Last but not the least,the Desserts!!you will get 4 flavors of icecreams there along with darsan,mousse n chocolate cake cubes..
Didn't liked the mousse though as I'm not so fond of it otherwise the rest of part was awsomely yummy!!‚Üí5/5
Courteous staffs,dimmed lighting,easy to go location,awesome foods-all of it you are going to get here
A must go.Thumbs Up for you guys!!

Yesterday night(22nd July, 2016) we went for a buffet dinner at the Haka outlet in Mani Square.
With full of expectations we thought Haka will serve us with authentic Chinese cuisine but to the contrary the quality of food was no better than a road side food shop.
The taste if I want to describe in one word it would be "YUCK".
The food garnishing and presentation was extremely poor. The serving gang was inexperienced and lacks in hospitality training.
To end with, we waited for 1hr to get our invoice for the dinner. To my surprise no computerised bill was given to us instead we were provided with a hand-written bill.
First the invoice was provided without any break-up of the tax levied onto it, on pointing out the mistake they provided us with the breakup of the taxes after about 30mins.

Heard a lot about this restaurant. Payed a visit today with my friends and i must say that i am impressed. Haka provides a modest chinese buffet at highly pocket friendly price. 
The food was very good 
some which i absolutely loved
Drums of heaven - the crispy coating ...... the soft chicken ...... the awesome taste. It literally landed from heaven.
Fried Chicken Wontons - another awesome dish. Super crunchy fried wontons with a delicious chicken filling.
hakka fried rice - the rice smelled reallt nice amd tasted nicer. 
Haka chilly chicken - soft and tender chciken with a very beautiful chinese gravy.
In desserts i loved two things .... one is the cream and another is darsaan. 
The waiters are attentive and courteous......
Surely one of the best buffets in town.
Cheers!!

Had a nice experience to be honest. The dishes they provided were more than enough! Starting with the soup till the ice cream. Although the variety of veg items were not upto the mark according to me. They did serve chilli paneer later though! They were late in filling the ice cream. But over all a good eating experience for 430!

Ok so I have been here a couple of times now. I tried the buffet once and ala carte the other. 
The buffet is really dirt cheap and for like 70bucks more you get unlimited pepsi. 
The starters are the best in my opinion and that's specifically where you get your money's worth. I suggest you fill up on those.
The main course is just meh.the fried rice and singaporean noodles are bland. The chilly chicken though edible do not ... And I cant stress it enoug... DO NOT try the chilli fish. The chilli fish is tasteless, period.
The staff is pretty cordial and the manager there has a warm smile and keeps checking on you... The desert is also okish, with darsaan, ice cream and a mousse. The a-la-carte is wayyy better and I highly recommend it.

Once this was known as a downsized version of the mainland China buffet, which is terribly popular!
But over a few visits I realised that the menu is repetitive and the cost cutting is pretty evident.

Haka, the name strikes a chord with those looking for a Chinese buffet spread at a reasonable price. Hence it's a big hit with students like me.  But one will be surprised to see people of all ages availing their buffet. Who after all wants to miss a decent Chinese buffet at such a good  price?

I've been to this outlet of Haka for a couple of times. Being reasonably priced it has its own pros and cons.  What I like is the politeness of the staff, the unlimited cold drink for Rs. 35, lip smacking chicken drumsticks. The service is so good that the containers are refilled even before they're empty. The cons include bland maincourse items, and less variety of everything.

The Chicken Manchow Soup tastes quite delicious. Having the Chicken Drumsticks and Crispy Chilli Potato alongwith is a blissful affair. The Chicken Siumai doesn't taste appealing. As you enter the maincourse section you're in for a little disappointment. The Chicken Fried Rice and Noodles taste bland. The Chilli Chicken is a careless preparation. The Basa Fish in a light sauce tastes good. Desserts section has 4 different flavours of ice creams, and a too sweet mousse!  

Buffet spread in Haka is a mix of good and bad. If one overlooks the few hitches they're gong to have a wonderful experience. Paying by ICICI card entitles you to a free mocktail. However I feel quality is not the same as before, even after raising the buffet price to Rs 431 for a Friday lunch.

Want cheap and good food??
Then this is definitely a must visit for everyone. A big spread with good dishes. Just because it is cheap, they have not lowered the quality of the food. This is something many places should follow.
Coming to the spread, dishes keep on changing. The soup and starters are something that are really well prepared and ¬†the food remains hot.
The service is really good and they fill the near empty food trays before anyone has to ask them!
A must visit.

I visited the place for the first time on 7th of june this month. It was our friend's bday and he gave us a buffet treat at Haka.. 

I was very disappointed with the quality of the food. I heard of the place from lots of people. But the quality dissatisfied me a lot.

We opted for non veg menu. And there also I was surprised that there was only 2 starter menu in a buffet dinner.
Coming to the main course there was only two main dishes and two side dishes.

Desert was ok as there were 4 kind of uce creams I.e. Vanilla, strawberry, chocolate and mango flavored. 
The pastry was so hard that it was not edible at all.
I liked thr Darsaan n thats all. 

Coming to the staffs , I found their behaviour very unsatisfactory. They were all busy in talking among themselves rather paying attention to thr needs of the customers. 
Only I found thr behaviour of a manager good and satisfactory. 

I give it 1.5 rating overall..

When you love Chinese cuisine and you want unlimited food without burning a hole in your pocket, Haka is your place. My relationship with this place started 6 years back and till now my go to Chinese place is Haka. Having frequented this place countless number of times Haka has never disappointed. Try visiting this place during the weekends. The buffet spread is magnificent considering the price and coupled with a pint of beer or sweet lime soda, which are not complimentary, you can enjoy your meal to the fullest. Be it birthday treats or a dull and inactive day me and my friends have Haka to fall back on. The place remains crowded throughout the day but you'll always find a place to sit even if you don't have reservations. The staff are courteous and are happy to take in your feedback.

Decent place with savory Chinese. The ambience was good but the decor needs serious attention along with the seating arrangement. The fish item in the buffet menu requires a revamp in its taste, since the too salty mares the taste of fish where the Basa fish itself being a salty one. Rest everything is fine n good to dine in or luncheon with friends group. Notably, the manager here is truly cordial n keeps a check on the hospitality of the guests. In my next time visit, I would like to see some changed menu with a revamped decor as well.....

This was my first time.....food quality compared to price is good. But I must say that they need more varieties in starters[ I didn't find crispy chilly baby corn in starter :-( ..... ]...All over it was a compact Chinese cuisine at a reasonable price.Tastes of deserts (specially ice creams) was average.

The points they gain for being the cheapest buffet in town,they lose that for the quality of food. I've heard it was better before,but this was my first time so I dont have another experience to compare it to.
The dumplings, chicken wings, the main course...everything tasted quite bland. The taste wasnt really bad,but the tanginess was missing. The mousse and darsaan for desserts was good though.

Quite disappointed. But I think its okay if you are planning to fill yourself without spending too much. Doesnt work for me. I'd eat less,but eat good.

I visited this place and wasn't disappointed. 
If you want to eat a lot without spending much, visit this place.

Rice, noodles, fish and chicken are the main course dishes. Starters contain several vegetarian dishes which includes Wantons and Fried Potato. Chicken Dumplings were really good. Deserts are one of the best part of this place

Located at Mani Square Mall, this is the best place to eat like you've never eaten before and that too without spending much. A nice place, with buffet starting at Rs 390 on weekdays and an A-La-Carte option is also available.The menu consists of 2 veg and 2 non veg starters along with 3 or 4 items in the main course. Deserts are also prepared. Each and every item is well prepared. Along with this, a Rs 35 unlimited coke option is also available.
I was told by my friends who have visited before that a wide selection of salads were available but I didn't get that.
If you want to eat your fill and without spending much, visit this place.

Visited this place for the umpteenth time. Buffet at its cheapest. Though now the menu rarely varies. Previously there used to be brownies or fruits for dessert..now its replaced by bread and butter pudding. Choice of salads also reduced. But the food will always make me happy. The drumsticks specially. Maincourse consisted of fried rice, noodles n  fish, prawn amd chicken in diffrent sauces. Sunday dinner buffet costs 490/ person.
Ps- huge crowd. Reach early.

Heard about this place many times but wasn't able to visit here. And finally i managed some time to visit here on 21st may. My friend gave her birthday treat here. Haka is known for their excellent buffet in a pocket pinch of price. In buffet they don't have so much of variety though. I kind of liked their taste especially their starters . i just loved their main course and dessert. But the soup or u can say manchow soup was yaaakk. It was looking too tasty but it didnt  taste good at all. Best thing is that if u want to have any soft drinks then u dont need to pay too much. Its just 35 rupees per person , and u get unlimited soft drinks. 
Would like to recommend this but its better if u dont taste their soup.

Buffet at such prices is a wonder but when you will have their buffet you will realise why their prices are so low. 
Their starters are ok, only the chicken lollipops are tasty!
Main course just have fried rice with chicken & fish.. the fish tastes stale. The chicken is worth having!
Their noodles is again a let down.
I personally just loved the dessert especially the darshaan with chocolate syrup!
Ice creams were very average!

If you are a meat fan, like me this place will disappoint you a little.
Rice, noodles, fish and chicken are the main course dishes. Starters contain several vegetarian dishes which includes Wantons and Fried Potato.
Chicken Dumplings tasted good. Small, fleshy and stuffed with chicken, it was a good alternative to the other dishes at display.
Desserts is why I go to Haka. I just loved the Farsan. 
Tip: Try the Farsan with a scoop of Vanilla ice cream.

Went there for a Sunday buffet lunch. Absolute value for money restro. Albeit the items provided are nothing out of the ordinary yet the price is unbelievably low. Probably the lowest price available for a Chinese buffet lunch in Kolkata.

The non veg starters were tasty - Chicken fried wontons and Shandong chicken drums(recommended) however the chicken manchow soup was fabulous (it's my favorite so I might b a bit biased to it). The veg starters included veg suimai( not recommended) and crispy vegetables which I did not taste cz it didn't look appealing. There was one vegetable soup as well which again I gave a miss. The salads were poor. Neither pickled cucumber nor Kim chi tasted fresh. The main course consisted of a number of options. There was Corn n potatoes in tsing hoi sauce which was okayish. Next was vegetables in Chilly Basil sauce which was an absolute disaster. Then comes chicken Hakka noodles and chicken fried rice both of which tasted very nice. Chicken in Sichuan sauce tasted more of a soup than a side dish as the gravy was toot thin and tasted bland. Same for the Shrimp dish. The star of the show was fish in parsley sauce. Not very spicy yet tasty. Dessert section was undoubtedly the best.Darsaan ( again my fav) with four different flavor of ice creams n chocolate sauce, mousse and cakes. Special mention of the mousse which was absolutely wizard. The cakes were nice too. By the end of the meal I was too full n could hardly move. This place is obviously not one of the must visits however recommended for college students for the dirt cheap prices.

Went well both with the rice and noodles . The deserts  were  also excellent. The mousse was brilliant,had to wait fr the refill as it was in demand. And a variety in icecream flavours. Overall a very good buffet at such a reasonable price.  :)

The soup and the starters were good. The main course pretty decent. While the fish in hot garlic sauce was one on the best I'd ever tasted,the chicken should have been better. The dessert counter ,though limited in variety,was still quite good. Especially the pudding and darsaan. But they should definitely up there cocktail game a bit.

Visited too many many times here due to their budget buffet. It is obvious they can't provide lots of menu item under 500 rate. But food quality is good enough. The starter is very awesome. Few items but taste is beautiful specially the Momo and chicken drumsticks. They may add some variations in menus. And also can improve the sitting arrangement. It's slightly cozier than other restro. Specially the table for two. One cannot put more than two plates on it. At the end of all a good budget buffet place for all who loves Chinese.

So I took a dinner buffet. I loved haka because it's pocket friendly and food was good enough too but now. The items are less, much less and the quality is not at par either. 
It's better to take ala carte than to take the buffet. 
It's not worth it anymore but loved the behavior of their staffs. No complaints on that department but really the food was a complete let down

Much heard about place, I finally got to visit Haka, for the first time over a dinner buffet. The experience was a healthy one. We were celebrating a birthday treat, the very look of the place is attractive, with all the red painted walls and illustrations i felt the decor was quite a match to the restaurants approach. Inaugurating the meal with the starters, crispy fried chicken wantons were simply awesome, the very first bite implied the wow effect each time I had it. other dishes from the starters in Non veg included drums of heaven and crispy honey chilli potato and were good to taste. Moving on to the main course, buffet was good and enjoyed the garlic prawns. The only concern is a constant clearance of the buffet counter as it was really untidy, and please keep a check on the Air conditioners. In total m planning a next visit soon.

Went yesterday with my college friends, the ambience was good. About the food...... Soup was awesome, both the salads and starters were delicious. In the main course you have to find chicken with microscope both in chicken rice and chicken noodles.  The taste of peeper chicken and prawns were good,  but prawns were overcooked, so it became rubbery, they fish item was not up-to the mark for me. In desert darsan was very tasty, a sandesh like sweet was there which is absolutely a disaster in the whole buffet menu.... The assorted ice-creams with hot chocolate sauce were yummy.... The staffs were very polite and helpful... So with everything it was a nice dinner experience for me.

We planned for a friends' reunion party at Haka, Mani Square. The menu promised an over-sumptuous Chinese meal at Rs.450 each, after all it was a buffet diner.¬†
The starters (Veg-soup and Chicken-Drums of heaven) were served at the table. The rest was for self-service, as it ought to be in a buffet. But it turned out to be an assortment of items, most of which were very common to taste, and not worth the penny.
The dessert was pleasant though, putting an end to the sundry affair. Darsan, Mousse with hot chocolate, and Assorted ice-cream saved the day!

I specially liked the 'Fish in mustard sauce' that was available for the main course, other items like mixed fried rice and mixed noodles were also good. In the dessert section the best thing was the mousse. There were mango, chocolate, vanilla and strawberry flavoured ice creams. It was a good experience overall with good food and ambience all at a very reasonable cost.

Haka is a reasonably priced restaurant for a decent Chinese buffet meal. The mani square outlet is spacious and well decorated. You get unlimited coke for just 35 bucks and free mocktails for all icici card holders!

The non veg buffet serves two veg starters and two non veg starters namely salt and pepper veg,veg wantons,chicken siumai and chicken drumsticks. In soups there were both veg and non veg options too. For main course there were veg/egg hakka noodles,veg/chicken fried rice, schezwan chicken,fish in garlic sauce etc. For desserts we had a cake,darshan and four flavours of ice cream. 

The starters were very good. The drumsticks definitely get a special mention here. Though the main course was little bland,it wasn't bad. Only the dessert section needs real improvement. The cake tasted bad and the darshan was ordinary. 

The service is excellent. Overall its a good place for buffet if your budget isn't very high.

I could not keep a count of how many times I have been here.. they serve a very standard buffet comprising of soups, starters, main course and desserts at a very reasonable price. I love their dimsums and wontons.. On weekends, they serve prawn along with chicken and fish.. The only complaint I have is that they need to bring a little more variation in their menu.. When u r a regular, u almost find it to be more or less same every time.. Otherwise, the food quality is good and service is prompt..

The food was okaish... prawn and the wantons could have been better. The fired rice was not up-to the mark . Liked the dessert specially the Moose.. The manager and service men were nice and quick.

Wow!! Haka is definitely the place you should visit if you want GOOD Chinese food in the city.
The staffs are friendly and nice.
The starters are amazing. The chicken drumsticks are properly done, the veg crispy honey potato was lovely.
Coming to the main course overall is was okay but the noodles could have been better.
The deserts are lovely.
So i would say if in kolkata, one should definitely visit this place.
I doubt you get this lovely food anywhere for the money you have to pay ;)

I have visited the place thrice and found very good. The menu they supplied is good enough and tasty for the rate they charged. I went their with my colleagues of a team of 15. They served complimentary mocktail when we paid through ICICI card. It was nice and calm atmosphere there. Its really a recommended place to join.

Went there today with a group of 14 friends... The spread was quite impressive keeping in mind the price(390 inclusive of all tax and service charges).. The ambience was good.. Service was promt and the staffs were really helpful.. They even provided a complimentary birthday cake and played the"happy birthday" song in the entire restaurant.. That was a really sweet gesture... Overall it was a good experience and Would definitely like to visit again...

One of my favorite place for a buffet experience. Again like many buffet places the starters and the desserts are the main attractions. Starters include an array of soups, wantons, chicken drumsticks and crispy potato fries to name a few. The wantons are really delicious every time. On the other hand the chicken drumsticks are excellent on some days while average on some other days. The main course includes a preparation each of chowmein, fried rice, chicken and fish/prawn. In the dessert, I specially like the mousse cake and the darshans. Overall, a meal at haka is a satisfying experience.

Had this in my sights since my Mio Amore visit on Christmas day last year; finally made it today on the 163rd birthday of Indian Railways...
On 16th April, 1853, the first ever train rolled in India from Mumbai to Thane. Whilst, on 16th April, 2016, two bosom friends from school and I rolled out in this sweltering heat for Mani Square.
Once at Haka, we were treated graciously and given a confirmation seat. Being Saturday, it was quite full. We opted for the weekend Non Veg Buffet meal. 
They served us the soup, Chicken Coriander Soup, and the starters, Chicken Fried Wonton and Drums of Heaven Hong Kong Style. While the drums could have been better, the fried chicken couldn't have been any better! Sticks to my tongue even now as I sit to pen down my experience.
A friend and I also ordered 30 ml of Johnnie Walker black label each to add some alcoholic touch to our meal.
In the main course, they offered Chicken Hakka Noodles and Chicken Fried Rice. Being out and out non-vegetarians, we concentrated only on the non-veg section. The Hakka noodles was the best I've had in the recent times but was seriously disappointed with the fried rice. They can look at improving it's taste a bit more.
Accompanying the above were Chicken in Hot Garlic Sauce, Fish in Chili Mustard Sauce and Prawn in Chili Basil Sauce. I personally don't have Prawn but loved the other two to the hilt, specially the fish was out of the world.
To complement things, they also served some fine dessert which included Hiraan, strawberry cream, Mousse cake and assorted ice creams; vanilla, chocolate, strawberry and mango favoured.
Overall a fine place to dine if your mind speaks Chinese anytime. The fact they offer drinks is also a plus factor. The staff are very courteous and well behaved. To top it all, the ambient atmosphere keeps you at ease always...go for it!!!

We had this place in our wish list for a long time.
An extremely pocket friendly buffet right inside Mani Square shopping mall. Not some highly decorated place but known for what they charge for their buffet and their service.
As we entered the restaurant, we were greeted and they enquired our choice of course and beverage requirements.
Then they served the food and as per our order, we were given a glass of pepsi which is served unlimited with the buffet at Rs. 35 only. 
The food started with the Chicken Manchow Soup. Amazing fried chow and beautifully flavoured soup made it so amazing.
Then came up the starters. Chicken Siumai was perfectly made with a lot of stuffed chicken and veggies. And the drums of heaven were really saucy and well made. We loved the starters.
Then we had to walk to the buffet and take the main course ourselves. There was a spicy coriander noodles, chicken fried rice, haka chilli chicken and the fish in hot garlic sauce. The noodles, rice and the chicken was just the main stream once that we always have. The fish is a bit different and surely well made. 
Then the dessert simply made the day. At this rate, such amazing deserts were really unexpected. Mango moose, Darshan and ice cream topped with hot chocolate sauce. All of the items were really good.

I am impressed with their courtesy and service. Recommended for sure.

Yes.. Pretty good when you have a buffet of 350 RS.. With all the food having a decent taste :)

Now you will get all the menu in zomato itself.. So, I am not getting into that..

Let me point out the most tastey items:
Chicken soup, drums of heavens, fried wonton

These items are really superb.

Fish in hot garlic sauce, chicken noodles, Hakka chicken was pretty good. And yes I love the stir fried vegetable and dumpling in Manchurian sauce.

They have offered normal 4 type of ice crm vanilla, choco, strawberry, mango with dransaan.

Very pocket friendly for a decent buffet. :)

After planning for decades about going for a buffet lunch at haka, i finally managed it . I went there early because it was weekend and I had a movie to catch at 2pm . I later realized it was a pretty good decision since the place gets really crowded after 1 15 pm Saturday weekend .

The very disciplined waiters greeted us and after taking our orders they served the starters . We skipped the soups . For starters the non veg items are : - 

1. Chicken siumai ( 3.5 / 5 ) - These are crispy fried chicken wantons . They were served with a mustard sauce . They tasted good . We didnot ask for a refill but the items were quite good for a one timer .

2. Drums of heaven hunan style ( 4 / 5 ) - This is the star of this buffet place . It is not an uncommon dish . You may get the saucy chicken drums in any Chinese outlet but here you can much on them as much as you like and fulfill your drumstick desires . We had 2 plates of them

After these we took a mini 5 minute break and went ahead with the main course :-

1. Chicken fried Rice ( 3 / 5 ) - Quite an average fried rice . Was looking forward to it since i am a serious fried rice eater but it was not cooked to utter perfection .

2. Coriender rice noodles ( 3.5 / 5 ) - This was better than the rice . Was skeptical at first but they got the flavor right here .

3. Fish in mustard sauce ( 4 / 5 ) - This is a value of money dish . The dish was a bit salty but it connected . This fish was " makhmali " to say the least . You can have a lot of pieces and you can still carry on .

4 . prawn hunan style  ( 3 / 5 ) - Now this dish is only available in the weekend . But inspite of having huge expectations with this dish , it didnot leave much of a mark . Had a lot of chilli flakes in it which put us off . The prawn pieces had a lot of arrowroot coating so definitely could not have a lot of it .

As for the veg items in the main course , there are really not much to offer . 2 veg curries which tasted pretty ordinary and the noodles and fried rice was not much of a mood enhancer too .So a strictly no no for the veggies .

Then we took another 5 minute break to our stomach and went on with the deserts . There were pastries but we were eager to jump on the darshaan and assorted ice cream which needs no ratings .

All in all it was a good one timer with the drums of heaven and fish in the main course as the best of the lot. There are soups, salads for you to try so I belive for 370 rupees this should be a good one time experience if you are in Mani square and have the appetite for a small buffet lunch .

The staff is very very courteous and helpful . The sweet lime soda was cool and the manager kept of asking about the quality of food which I felt sincere . So those who have not yet tried the place can have a go for atleast once .

Honestly, Haka is more popular due to its budget buffets than the ambience and food quality.Located on the 4th floor of mani square haka is the place for giving birthday treats, parties when u are slightly tight on the pocket.
Among the starters were Chicken siumai and drums of heaven. The Drums of heaven were tasty enough for refilling the plates but Chicken siumai were Chicken dumplings Which i felt were a little undercooked.
Among the main course 2types of noodles were there and rice.the fish tasted much better than the chicken.
Among the desserts there were chocolate mousse and strawberry, mango vanilla and chocolate flavor ice-cream with chocolate sauce.
The food were good when u compare with the price,however I felt would have been better if one more starters were added and some sweets in the form of brownies were added to the menu.
Another thing which i liked was the continuous refilling of cold drinks which was a welcome thing.

Location : 4th level, Mani Square.

‚ÄúChinese lovers‚Ä¶eat all you can‚Äù

The place is spacious and the ambience has a chilled out feel to it. The vibes are subtle to sooth you while you dine at one of the leading Chinese cuisine restaurants in the city. The d√©cor pretty much suits the ambience and is plain and simple. Unpretentious and comfortable furniture too. The main and only attraction is their excellent buffet menu which is so reasonably priced despite variety of dishes to quench your thirst for authentic chinese. And there is no option of a la carte so we had to go for buffet.

The food we had was some real deal, although not at par with the other category leaders, but gives a tough competiton.
‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Honey Potato : I would say I have had better, but these weren‚Äôt bad either. Pure taste honey with potato tickles your taste buds but the coating was a bit chewy.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Crispy Chilli Babycorn : A signature Chinese starter and it was prepared the that way. All areas checked out fine. Just a little snag was that the spice element was not up to the mark.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Vegetable Fried Wontons : These tasted satisfactory. The coating was thin and crisp on the outer areas. However they were undercooked on the inner side which dampened the taste.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Fried Rice & Paneer in Manchurian Sauce : The fried rice was nice with evenly cut vegetables. The Manchurian sauce was awesome with great spice elements.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Darsaan & Bread and Butter Pudding Mousse : Darsaan is a classic and can never taste bad, so eventually it was great. The pudding mousse, however, was on a totally different level altogether. And combine it with chocolate sauce‚Ä¶what a wonder. It was so smooth and soft that it would melt in the mouth just as soon as it went in. An absolute peach.

Despite the food had some minor flaws it is not devoid of quality. And offering such a wide variety at such a low price is a rarity. The service too was a delight. The staffs are courteous and manage tables well while keeping a constant tab on the needs of their customers.

The best buffet lunch in terms of ROI in the city! Situated in the food court of Manisaquare mall in Kakurgachhi this restro offers some of the best dishes at reasonable price!
I can't even remember the number of chicken dumplings and drumsticks I had!! Both were equally amazing! The chicken in black bean sauce and the chilly fish in main course was exquisite! Truly speaking I thought they would compromise with the quality judging by the price but they don't!! They might not have a loooong list of items but whatever they have to offer has a class!! Which is great!! The fried rice was nice, only downside being the noodles, could have been better!! In desserts they offer ice cream, pastries and darshan !! Short and sweet!!
Overall a great experience. The taste of drumsticks and dumplings still lingers in my mouth!! Great place to have a quick lunch while shopping or to have a pocket friendly buffet along with friends or colleagues!!

Food: 4.5
Service: 4

I went to Haka at mani square ordered a buffet  and one Pepsi. Well preparation I liked was drums of heaven , chiken sweet corn soup and afcourse the desert. Main course have very limited item to choose. Maincourse preparation taste is average. It is pretty much like speciality budjet resturant. 

Other than that I was bit disappointed to the fact that it does not accept speciality card. 

Service was like OK nothing special.

Cost for my order was around 540 INR.

My recommendation would be , in similar budjet we can have better resturant with better food.

Situated @the top floor of Mani square..
Nicely decorated well maintained Restaurant with good ambiance..
We went their for lunch on Tuesday..
They served chicken soup and starters on the table..
There were chicken suimai and drums of heaven in the starter.. Starter was good.. BUT service was very very poor.. We had to ask them minimum 3/4 times for extra starter as they told us that starter will be served on the table.. Then we went for main course.. Chicken fied rice, hot pot chicken, 1 fish item n non veg noodle were on the menu.. noodle was not good.. fried rice was average.. hotpot chicken was good and fish item was average.. Then the deserts.. Mouse was very very good.. 4 options of ice cream were available.. n that was also good..
Now coming to the comparison with Haka in CC1.. Though rating of mani square haka is more and price is cheaper than cc1 Haka.. but cc1 haka is more n ¬†more better than mani square in every aspect.. service was far more better there.. In mani square I had to ask them for water again and again.. even We had to ask them for clearing table properly.. service is very very poor in mani square haka.. Variety is lesser in mani square haka in each course. From starter starter to dessert cc1 offers more options..
We had a bill of 780 rs for two including taxes...
I vl prefer to visit cc1 haka again not mani square..

Easy to find ...at the top floor of Mani square mall at the last beside machan......I think they serve only buffet... Unlike the cc1 joint... Decoration avg and there is lack of attendants for the huge croud...the authority must see this....at this joint buffet is 70 rupees cheaper but they also serve bad food than the cc1 joint... In all aspect cc1 joint is good... First of all they served the soup on the table, and it was very much avg... Then they served chicken suimai and chicken lolypop drums of heaven style.... Suimai was good... And the drum sticks were over avg...then comes to main course chicken schiwan chow ,egg chicken fried rice.... Fried rice was not so good but in my likings the chow was good... Two side dishes chicken hot sauce was avg and fish in shewan sauce was not good fish is hard, not juicy and also not so tasty ...now come to desert section...
Darshan ,vanila mouse,4 types of ice crm...
After all this the buffet cost for two people is 780 rupees.... Which is very much affordable... So I am giving it a 4/5....

Excellent is one word to describe this place. My experience started yesterday at lunch(tuesday) and at the end of it I just had best wishes for this place.
We were three ppl, 2 vegetarians along with me(pure nonveg). To begin with we were very warmly welcomed by the manager and seated at any place of our liking as half the place was empty. Its spacious and the shade of red in there decor goes well with the ambiance.
Only buffet here. My veggie friends were quite sceptical about it before coming here as most of the reviews have been from the nonveg ppl. I could guess that very few vegetarians visit here from the fact that they were very happy to serve my friends and assured them that most of the dishes they would be served will be prepared fresh for them and took the pain of asking how the preparation was, most of the time. Not so for me though but I didn't have any issues with that as the nonveg food had many takers and was being replenished time to time by hot food.
Coming to the food,it started of with lemon pepper clear soup. A gud light way to cleanse ur palate before ur meal. My starters comprised of chicken drumstick and chicken wantons. Both of them were lipsmacking and I had two servings of each. My friends were served chilli babycorn, veg stir fry and green dimsums. The baby corn was too good. The best I have had till date. Stir fry gud. Dim sum though different but average in taste. Not to forget all veg items freshly prepared and piping hot. My main course had mixed noodles, meat fried rice, chicken chilli like dish and honey chilli fish. All except the fish were ordinary. The fish was heavenly, too gud. I cud see almost everyone eating there rooting for it. The veggies again had a dish extra(read freshly prepared). Chilli veggies, potato corn mix, and a paneer dish(the best amongst them), veg rice and chilli garlic noodles. The impression was mixed on the main course as it was not as good as the starters, a few things though did stand out.
Finally, for deserts there was darsan and ice cream(4 flavours) and mousse. The mousse was very delicious. All creamy, with a slight taste of coffee along with shaved chocolate in it. The ice cream was as usual with hot chocolate sauce and darsan at ur disposal. A debit card offer thanks to my friend, got us a round of free kiwi based mocktail which was very refreshing.
Paying ‚Çπ390(incl. of taxes) per person at the end of the meal, I felt very satisfied with the experience. I feel the lack in variety is justified. Not to forget the excellent service and treatment by the staff who readily accepted every feedback. The team is doing a great job led ably by their manager.
A suggestion though from our side would be to take more care of the main course. There is a lot of scope for improvement there. Also a complimentary drink should be added along with the buffet, (although u can have unlimited cold drinks by just adding ‚Çπ35)

It's an absolute delight to go back to Haka for Chinese food every time. This place is located in Mani Square. However, it successfully provides you with buffet food at a very cheap price. Definitely pocket friendly. And the food never fails to satisfy your taste bud.

Let's start with the ambiance, it was so noisy and crowed there that you can barely listen to the person sitting in front of you. The food was not at all upto the price that us being charged for. No variety for vegans and not to forget the service was very lousy . I had to wait and call the waiters again and again to serve the food.
Not a good place to hang out with friends.

Good price for their food.
The Buffet is okayish.
But considering the cost to about 400...its a good deal.
They also provide unlimited complimentary soft drinks at a reasonable price.

The most value for money buffet restaurant in the city. I was impressed by this place the first time I visited, and multiple visits later, I'm still impressed. The food is not just value for money, but its a place worth of multiple visits.  Its like, if you're feeling like eating Chinese, and also want unlimited food, look no further, its got to be Haka. The menu generally consists of 2 non veg starters, 2 main course dishes, usually chicken and fish, but on weekends and special days, they also have prawns. The dessert is also excellent.
All in all, food- has both quality and quantity. Service- average,  ambience- nice.
This place is worth visiting.

This is a small cozy place located at the Mani Square Mall.The best thing about this place is that you can have good unlimited Chinese food without too much pinch in your pocket.Chicken momos (both steamed and fried) and chicken drums of heaven are the ones which I loved the most as well as the dessert which was lipsmacking.The fried rice,chowmein and the chicken and fish side dishes were just okay.But you can have them as much as you like!The staff was also very courteous to mention.So I would definitely want to visit this place again given the value for money it offers.üòä

Unlimited Chinese food with soft drinks @ 400 bucks.
Quite a stealing deal.
Their dishes are very ordinary and bland except the starter, chicken wings.
Waiters are patient.

veryyyy bad experience........ very average food to be honest. Visited this place today for lunch..... very much dissapointed. only the starter chicken suimai and drums of heaven were good. options were very less. the main course was disaster...The noodles n the rice, both were tasteless.... The fish n chicken, worst kind...no spices in it... fish pieces wr simply arrowroot coated ¬†and did not exhibit the taste you look for in a Chinese dish. The options in dessert were very very limited. The ice cream was good though.

Not recommended for Chinese lovers.

Sunday afternoon .. We were very feeling bored. To get rid of our monotonous life we went to have Chinese buffet at Haka.
It was my first visit to this place. There is a saying how much you will pay you will get much only. This words are very much applicable for this place. Sasta and tikao compare to other places. 

They serve really good Chinese food. I loved fried chicken wanton very much. Desert section can be improved. 
I would love to visit this place again.

I cudnt stop from writing something abt haka..place is decent, price is reasonable ( Saturday lunch - rs.490/- ), they refill the food containers quickly, the staff including the waiters are too polite and courteous and lastly food is too tasty. What more you can ask for.. 

Today, 6 of us went out for lunch to this place. When we came out with big smile on our faces. 

Thank you..

If you like Chinese and a pocket friendly buffet, try once. Its ok type restro in terms of other competitors. Starters are good. Moderate maincourse. Good desserts. Though a fewer number of items, but you can give it a try. It will not disappoint you.

If we talk about buffet, this might not be the best place in town but considering value for money it certainly is the best. At a mere 400 bucks they offer a variety of food which includes soup, starters, main course and dessert. Quality wise its great. Service is upto the marks. Ambience is nice. Allover a very pleasant experience.

Even if they've started serving a-la-carte Haka would still be synonymous with cheap chinese buffets.
Don't expect tantalising food at such prices but the spread is extensive and the items range from average to really good.The starters and dessert section steal the show.One advice would be to steer clear of the main course.The items are really tasteless and waste tummy space.Starters like chicken lollipop,chicken wantons,veg dimsums along with warm delicious soups and not to forget several condiments and sauces make up for this otherwise major glitch.After the starters I pounced on the dessert.Brownies with glossy chocolate sauce bubbling away over a butane burner and 4 flavours of icecream are the stuff that every chocoholic's dreams are made of.I shamelessly decked up my plate with uncountable helpings of brownies,chocolate sauce and chocolate icecream.Yes chocolate all the way.Must say that station enough has me counting my days till the next visit.All this for 376 bucks on a weekday.The snobs step aside,this place is for people who see the chocolaty silver lining in a not-so-dark cloud of terrible mains.

They are very welcoming and some of them even remember us now! Anyway the buffet is pretty good, although I think a bit of addition of items will make the menu even more appreciable and palatable. The dessert was delicious and we were lucky enough to enjoy the custard pudding. Yummy!

Experienced Haka for the First Time for the Sunday Lunch though but would like to mention that in comparison with other buffet places..this one comes in a decent price..and the quality is very nice. Rush was not too much as expected but yes, the starters- Chicken Drums and Momos were off to a flier..they got vanished very quickly (Demand very high :p)..was waiting for that for little long. Atlast it really paid off for its less spicy and delicious taste. Now coming on to the main course, it was quite decent and simple with chicken noodles and chicken fried rice.
Other preparations include Chilli Chicken wih black pepper sauce (Very nice), Chilli fish with mustard (Didnt like that much personally) , Shrimps (Decent) and it follows.
Moving on to the last part, my second favourite after the starters- Icecream Scoops!!
Yesss, Four variants were available- Chocolate, Mango, Vanilla & Strawberry.
Tasted All. Loved it.
Maincourse needs to be much more tastier but Overall, A Very nice Outing to celebrate a little Family Occasion.
Thanks Haka.

A sumptous and inexpensive buffet!-
After a disappointing experience at Shack, Mani Square, we politely shifted to Haka. This place has a huge space totally packed with smiling faces gorging onto food. This however is only during the buffet hours. Starters contained drums of heaven (not for the faint-hearted, too too spicy), fried wontons which was not appealling to me and a soup (suggested: you do not try more of it, kills appetite). Starters are served on the table. Service is appreciable.

Moving on to the main course which had a spread of noodles, fried rice, chilly chicken, a fish and a shrimp preparation. Thoroughly enjoyed the main course. All the dishes tasted equally good. Next, was the dessert round. It disappointed me with very few items. Probably a pastry, icecream and darsan. What more do you expect at 375/- INR with taxes? :)

Happy customer. Dying to visit another time.

Food is quite good.I liked the crispy wanton and chicken drumstick.Fish cooked in mastered gravy was the best in taste yesterday. One suggestion the corn flower coating in the prawn was little too thick. Please work on that.The mausse was too good. Anyone can come and enjoy good food with family. Overall it was a great experience  for me.

HAKA : Undoubtedly the cheapest buffet in town, though they have increased their rates - weekdays : Rs 430/- A. I, weekends : Rs 490/- A. I @ coming back to the menu, its same old n boring serving similar recipes everyday.. They don't even try other flavours in desserts. 

Food quality looks good, hygiene well mantained, ambience perfect.. Overall seems great place to enjoy a wonderful buffet.

If your wallet disappoints you, but your buffet cravings keep bugging you, this is one place that may certainly appease your stomach and heart. Gorged on a weekday buffet lunch this week. Food was really good if you look at the buffet rate. The dimsums were yucky though. The decor was very ordinary, but amicable services, especially the manager who came up to talk with us. Lastly, I missed prawns. Why the hell only on weekends?

This place has the most reasonably priced buffet in the city. The food quality isn't compromised at all, the menu has a lot of variety and everything tastes pretty good. The buffet menu started with coriander chicken soup, then went on to two veg and two non veg starters with the drums of heaven and veg dimsums being the stars of the show. The main course had noodles and fried with pepper chicken gravy and fish in hot garlic sauce. The noodles and the fish dish were a disappointment though the other main course dish was delicious. The dessert had darsan, chocolate mousse and 4 different flavours of ice cream. The service was very good and the management made sure we had a nice time.

Stepped into Haka on a Sunday noon just for a quick yet filling munch. As we already had brunch in home, and awaiting a movie in Inox, our order was just one plate Double Pan Fried Chowmein with Mixed Meat and Tai Sui Chicken. Service was quick and extremely caring. Other restaurants should learn from them how to deal with customers with smiling faces. Food was very good, though chowmein could have been a bit more fried. What we liked was that dishes were not overcooked . Bill was 746/-. A buffet could have been a better choice at 395/- but we were not in mood for a buffet. Later a buy-one-get-one free Antiquity Blue at Kix (their bar) was icing on the cake.

I visited this place for a friend's treat, The place looks neat and bright... I have heard a lot about haka before... Finally when i reached,i found out its a buffet restaurant but contain far more less items to eat... They have veg and non veg both...Chicken lollipop was great no doubt...fried rice ,noodles, chicken chilly and paneer were just good... Not exceptional...Steam momo were amazing... The thing i loved is the ice cream... I ate a lot of that :p... Wish the flavor butter scotch were there too, but nope... The best thing about this place is that nobody serves the food to you... You have to walk and take the food by yourself and as much as you want...You won't feel shy to ask if you want more :p The waiters present are always alert and refill the food containers as soon as its about to empty...! Well had a nice experience... Didn't loved it but a suitable place to have your lunch or dinner...!

I had the chinese buffet on Christmas day. The whole atmosphere was pretty nice and waiters were very friendly. I started with chilly mushroom and prawns and chicken lolipops, which were very tasty. Hakka noodles was less spicy but good enough. General Tao's chicken was yummy but there was no other chicken dish served in the buffet. I liked the prawn gravy too. Foe dessert, there was unlimited cake and ice cream. The tota buffet cost 574/- which was reasonable considering the location and food quality. But I wish they had provided complimentary soft drinks or juice at least.

It was a private party from one of my friend & the Shack was booked for it. All the foods were provided by Haka over in Shacks place.

Location : Shack is located just beside Haka on the top or 4th floor of Mani Square Mall.

Decorations : Haka is having a great place inside for handling lots of people while serving them buffets. Sitting are comfortable & ambience is quite good.

Staffs & Management : Staffs of Haka were decently behaved. Manager is very caring to their customers. But one thing seemed odd to me was their sizes of plates were very small & the size of spoon & fork was very big compared to the plates. It was quite hard to handle those big forks & spoons on that small plate. You may feel falling the spoons & forks while filling up your plate, it made me quite uncomfortable while having the foods too.

Buffets : Haka is places into the Great Buffet collections of Zomato & their Buffet stays almost same with the following items...

Salad : Salad of the buffet were nicely decorated with 5-6 items. Salads were average but pickles were not so good.

Starters...
Drums of Shangdong Style : Soft, nicely fried chicken lollypop tossed into dark spicy sauces just touched my heart from very first bite & increased the expectations of the buffet from Haka. This chicken pieces tasted really good to me but a pinch of salt would have been great.

Cottage Cheese In Sichuan Chilli Sauce :  Diced Paneer Pieces were crispy fried outside & tossed into dark spicy Sichuan chilli sauce. Lots of spices felt in the mouth but as per name I was expecting good cheese fragrance from it, unfortunately it was not there. Diced capsicum & onion pieces increased its richness, but same as the chicken dish it was little less on salt.

Pan Fried Crispy Chilli Fish : Big fish pieces covered with crispy fried layer outside & it was juicy inside. Natural taste of fish felt well in mouth & quite tasty.

Mains....
Corn, Potato Tsing Hot Style : I don't know who would love potato & corn in their Buffet. Well somehow it was the first mains of buffet. Although it was cooked well & balance spices were there still it didn't tasted good in my mouth.

Stir Fried Vegetables : Mixed colly flower, carrot, cabbage, capsicum etc were dipped into white sauce. All the vegetables were not well cooked & some felt hard on mouth too. Gravy & the dish itself was washed out spices & didn't tasted good.

Vegetable Hakka Noodles : The noodles were very thick but soft, very less vegetables were used, spices & oil were minimum. Noodles itself tasted not good but combining with side dishes it felt quite good to eat.

Chicken Fried Rice : The rice grains were of average quality. Chicken pieces were hard to find & vegetables too. Very less oily & very less spicy. It tasted below average & very lite. Same as noodles side dish tasted good with it.
 
Fish In Fresh Chilli Coriander Sauce : Big, soft, over cooked fish pieces were dipped into white sauces with diced vegetables. Fish pieces were so soft from outside to inside that it was melting in the mouth that this kind of dishes didn't meant to be. Also the fish pieces has lost its taste due to overcooking & gravy was almost tasteless even with other dishes.

General Tao's Chicken : Big nicely cooked soft juicy chicken pieces were dipped into rich looking gravy. This dish tasted really good with noodles & rice both. It looked very rich & spicy but in mouth it was an excellent combination of spices & chillies. Capsicums & onions took the taste of gravy, while chicken felt the same from inside too.

Shrimps in Spicy Chilli Sauce : It was an item of prawn. Small prawns were dipped into rich looking gravy with capsicums, onions & red chillies in it. It was cooked really well & tasted very nice with rice & noodles.

Desserts....
Daarsaan : Crispy fried chips tossed into dark sweet sauce with lite spices & small beans for fragrance, it was such an awesome desert after dinner. It was something that is dedicated for all sweet lovers & as a sweet lover I liked its taste too.

Chocolate Brownies : With lots of nuts & chocolate chips each & every piece of the brownies tasted great & felt soft in the mouth. Brownies were very small on size but I just loved it's taste, so I took 10-12 of it.

Vanilla Ice Cream : The Ice Cream they served were on the average side. Don't expect BR's quality from a budget buffet but it felt nice in filled up tummy. You can even add chocolate sauce on it for extra flavour.

Pricing : Usually Haka's buffet costs Rs. 376-471 depends upon on offers & timing. This is known as the most affordable buffet in town & it definitely holds that tag. Even for Rs. 25 unlimited cold drinks adds another charm to it. In my scenario the buffet was a part of the party & total package costs near about Rs. 90k for hiring the Shack from 5-11pm on Sunday.

Conclusion : A must visit for every buffet lovers. But don't go with too much expectations, you will only get the quality you are paying for. In some scenario foods are really good, in some average but overall very good buffet specially when you are more focused on starters & deserts.

This is one of the finest places in Kolkata that serves good buffets at reasonable rates. Food gets refilled as soon as it's over. It serves quality food and the staffs are courteous and everything is synchronized here. :) Way to go !

This place has been on my wishlist for a long time. I have heard my friends rave about it and the curiosity to see if Haka lives up to the hype, was getting unbearable! :P

The Haka outlet at Mani Square, E.M. Bypass, located on the floor above the food court, is subtly done up in tones of red and black, with soft lighting, good music and helpful staff.

The afternoon lunch buffet had an amazing spread. We opted to add ‚Çπ35 to our bill(without taxes) for unlimited Pepsi. There were 2 choices of soup, and 2 choices of veg and non veg starters each. We went for the chicken suimai(basically, mini momos) and the chicken drumsticks. The soup was delicious, hot and tangy, just the way I like it. The quality of the starters came as a surprise for me. Although I have been to plenty restaurants and tasted the same food, these momos and drumsticks were prepared to perfection. The chicken was soft, tasty and with just the right hint of flavour. We couldn't help taking second servings of both the items. The pickled cucumber for salad, had a weird taste and gets a thumbs down from me.

The main course was a disappointment. The hakka noodles were rubbery and frankly, inedible for me. The fish in lemon and honey sauce didn't do wonders for my taste buds either. However, the shrimp was good. Unable to have the noodles, I opted for the egg fried rice and chilli chicken and both were satisfactory. I would request the management to bring in more choices for the main course. The egg fried rice and rubbery noodles do not make for a good meal. 

Anyway, after the disappointing main course, the desserts took our heart away. Though we were too full to have anything else, the mousse with chocolate sauce was so heavenly that we couldn't stop going back for more. Not having much of a sweet tooth myself, I'd still say that my Haka experience was worth it only for their mousse(and starters, too). Their were four choices of ice cream. The chocolate ice cream was amazing. And so was the Darsaan. 
I did not opt for any vegetarian dish. So can't review that! 

Coming to the service, I found the staff humble, courteous and efficient. The pepsi that we had paid for, kept appearing like magic, everytime, the moment we put down the empty glass, without even having to ask for it. Very rarely have I seen the staff so helpful and polite as I did at Haka.

To sum up, I'd give Haka a thumbs up and urge you to go. Though the main course leaves a lot to be desired, Haka makes up for it through the amazing staff, starters and dessert. Also, the pocket pinch is possibly the least in town.

Having recently relocated to Kolkata, I ventured out to manisquare and stumbled across this restaurant.
My mom and sis, also tired from the flat-hunting, were there too as we entered the place. Though non-pretentious and impressively unimpressive ambience, we sat down on not so comfortable seats. The waiters and their eagerness to wait the tables was palpable.

Giving the ala-carte a miss, we settled for the buffet dinner. We were pleasantly surprised with the quality of the starters. The soup and the handful of starters made it worthwhile.
The main course that followed was good too.
The desserts weren't that impressive save for the variety of ice creams.

This place would surely be visited when I am low on cash and wish to have some good Chinese.

Perhaps, I should rate this restaurant again based on my ala-carte experience.

Went there with one of my friends in weekend. We opted for buffet. There were 2 veg and 2 non veg starters which all tasted good. The main course was also very nice as they had chicken, fish and prawn in main course. We were a little disappointed with desserts. A little more varieties in desert would have made it perfect. Other wise its a very nice and pocket friendly place.

I have been to this restaurant several times but today was disappointed by the attitude of one particular staff member. He was very adamant that me my girlfriend sit on a particular table despite the restaurant been 75% empty. After repeatedly pleading with him he finally relented. The food was good but the unlimited Pepsi refills was a bit slow. I would have rated this restaurant much higher had the behaviour been a bit better. I sincerely hope that next time I visit the staff will be a bit more curious.

awesome food, First they served soup and then chicken lolipop type one dish(and it was delicious ) and then momo. after that it was totally of self service and u can get the 3 starters there in the list also. and even if you need any help they are providing it. the only thing that i didn't like is the pudding. else, the mousse , the ice cream and specially the hot melted chocolate is heart melting one. the was a fish, a chicken and a prawn preparation. egg fried rice was better than chicken noodles . but over all it was awesome. we went there at 12.55 and where finished at 3.40 . :) there was also veg items like veg noodles and fried rice but it was not so much like the numbers of the non-veg items.

This place offers an affordable yet tasty buffet at a reasonable price. The buffet menu consisted of a chicken sweet corn soup accompanied with chicken lollipop and chicken wanton. The main course offered fried rice, noodles with a fish, chicken and prawn dish on the side. The side dishes were really good to taste. The chicken, fish and prawn was fresh and well cooked. The prawn had a coconut taste to it and I did not like it that much. 
For dessert they had Darsaan, bread and butter pudding and four flavours of ice cream. Of them I liked the bread and butter pudding and Darsaan the best. It was nicely done.
However, one thing this place should improve on is its environment. As u enter this place you get an oily unclean smell which is a total turn off. Other than that, I am so very happy with the food they serve.

This is one of those few affordable buffets that can not only please your appetite but also save you some money.
Starting from the chicken and cabbage soup, spicy chicken wings and Chicken siu mai, all the dishes were satisfactory. All of them had great taste and we went on to repeat all the starters more than twice.
In the main course, they had chicken, shrimp, fish dishes along with rice and noodles and all of them were very well prepared. For desert, there were four choices and ice cream separately. All in all, a really great place to spend some time with people with good food and the best part was that it doesn't cost you a ton of money.
Recommended.

Would be happy if there's just a little bit more of variety. Since it's a buffet place, we expect a lot more variety, around 12-15 kinds of dishes. Otherwise this place is a must-eat.

The dessert choices were, my family loved it. Only thing was they dont take reservations as I tried . And I noticed table reserved when I got in. Value for money.

This has been undoubtedly the best value for money place to go eat because not only does one get quantity, but quality also. It may not be the more upscale looking place to eat out at, but when you get unlimited wontons and chicken lollypops for about 400 a head, hey hey hey!! Do not miss out on this place. Will definitely visit again.

Subtle ambience and a pocket friendly Chinese spread is what describes Haka for me. Not a very grt ambience but the quality of food is good. Drums of Heaven as starter is awesome. However there wasn't anything good about the dessert so didnt give it a try. It had fruit custard and Darshan along with vanilla ice cream. The cutlery should be given some attention since I guess they have almost worn out with time. But keeping aside everything else if food is the only thing u want to pay attention to... Then Haka is the place, with a pocket pinch of 1089 approx got two for a bouffet.

I have visited both the outlets of Haka. We had a buffet lunch at this outlet. And being a vegetarian the menu didnt impress me much. It was pretty ok. I have had better haka noodles and manchurian at food court in Hangout. But chinese lovers can try as its not bad. Maybe more variety for non vegetarians.

Once again Haka....however must say their menu is really being monotonous....
For starters ( NON-VEG)
1) Chicken wanton soup
2) Chicken Dimsum
3)Chicken drums of heaven

4) Chicken F. Rice (you really have to find chicken with microscope)
5) Butter fried noodles
6) Chicken something ( Tastes like plain chilli chicken...good thing unlike earlier now its boneless)
7)Fish in sauce
8) Darsaan
9) Mousse (cream)
10) Chocolate sauce
11) 4 types of ice cream to choose from.

Pocket friendly but quality is going down.
OK now for price sensitive customers like me, this is how they calculate:-
1) Base Price ( found in zomato, usually written like "Amt+TAX")
2) Service Charge@ Rs. 29.5 ( a new component dint see that before and also unsure whether its per person/table, etc)
3) VAT @ 14.5% on (Base Price +Serv. Charge)
4) Service Tax @ 5.6 % on (Base Price+Serv. Charge)
5) Swatch Bharat Cess @0.2% on (Base Price+Serv. Charge)
6) Total ( All inclusive):- 1+2+3+4+5

Therefore a weekday lunch @295+Tax comes to Rs. 390 (All Inclusive).
¬†Now its 450/- AI on weekdays lunch..Prices as on 26/05/2017.

My earlier review:-I have been to this place before, Excellent Chinese Buffet at pocket friendly prices however must mention that some of the items especially from their veg & soup section have degraded...However their non-veg section still manages to steal my heart at so pocket friendly prices.

Words aren't enough to describe the love I have for Haka. It has been my go-to restaurant over the years and at one point, I literally used to go here every day. 
Not only are they the most reasonably priced buffet place in town but the Chinese they serve is even better than Mainland China's, in my opinion, just that they have less variety. The prawn preparation they have in their weekend buffet, the Drums of Heaven among the starters and the Brownies among the desserts are super duper delicious. Basically, all the dishes in their buffet spread are. 
I've literally lost count of the number of times I've been here but they have not failed to please me even once. Though they are the most crowded restaurant in Mani Square, the servers are attentive towards each and every single customer. This place has the most well behaved staff members and managers. One time, in the suggestion sheet I had suggested that they should have brownies in their buffet every day, and to my utter surprise and delight, there they were with a plateful of complimentary hot brownies covered with chocolate sauce, they had from earlier their lunch buffet menu! That was the sweetest gesture ever. 
Also, the interior done up in hues of red and black does great things to your appetite and the ambience is nice too. You can also add unlimited servings of soft drinks to your lunch buffet for just ‚Çπ25. 

Haka rocks! I'm never going to get over this place.

Located at Mani square, haka offers the CHEAPEST Chinese buffet spread in all of Kolkata, and just because it's cheap it doesn't compromise on quality of food. Even though in terms of variety it is quite limited, I am pretty sure that after giving it a try, one will leave this place quite content. Simply because of the value for money offered by this place I give it a full rating, after giving it a try once, one will always feel like coming back here again and again.

The restaurant appeared to have subtle ambience to calmly enjoy food topped with a very courteous and efficient service, thereby making for a comfortable outing for a Chinese lover. Though was a little let down seeing the small smorgasbord of culinary dishes available to feast upon, leaving a very little variety to choose from and hence not a very satisfactory culinary experience.

No bullshit Chinese buffet. Don't expect high end tongue twisters. Simple all you can eat momos, noodles, chilli chicken. If you are lucky you might get a fish prep. No complaints. Satiates a Chinese craving all the way. Cooking is light and flavourful. Have (and will) visited multiple times.

Haka is symbolic to pocket friendly chinese buffet spread. This one is at 4th floor of Mani square mall.
Decor is same in all of their outlets, simple and nice.
Food was average I would say. Chicken SuiMai was really good and best of the lot. In main course they had only 1 chicken and 1 fish item. No prawn dish was there, which was quite disappointing. Fried rce here always taste like regular rice mixed with egg and chicken, this really lacks flavour.
Dessert was very much regular with brownie and scoop ice cream.
One good thing is , they serve unlimited pepsi for Rs 25.
Being a chinese joint, they should put more flavour in most of the dishes.

Haka mani square was good they served pretty average food in terms of quality those foods they serve some normal Chinese dishes like chilli chicken and momos but the I don't like the momos but if you want to go for Buffet which you can afford normally like some 300 350 rupees only and you can easily go for this if your budget quite low but if you want to spend money then go to Mainland China. Ambience and support staff were not good I ate a lot and they were staring at me like you have to finish it right now and then they were not happy because I was eating a lot I don't know if it is true or not but I feel that. Material chairs and plastic jars were not good. It was not that much great experience. But u can not complain at this price.

Everyone would agree that the place is value for money, but what took me aback was the speedy service. Containers were refilled pretty quickly and the food was hot(or cold). I ate to my hearts content, but then again there wasn't too much variety. I gorged on the fried chicken and the fried momos. Though the basil fish wasn't great, I really liked the chicken. Altogether the place is wonderful when treating large groups.

Haka is the economical branch of the speciality group! Unlike the city center salt Lake outlet, this one serves a pretty buffet menu.. I have been to Haka mani square, did not know another Haka outlet exist in city center salt Lake also.. Ambiance is very simple and staffs are very courteous.. Simply u can njoy a great Chinese buffet services that they offer, in which they provide almost all the delicacies that they have to offer. Haka started out as a restaurant serving decent Chinese food.. Awesome food for Chinese food lovers..¬†
Tried out the buffet here, awesome starters awesome main course, awesome desserts everything is jzt awesome all I can say.. Do visit even those do not the Chinese food lover, I'm sure u will fall in love with it..¬†
If u want to taste¬† a great authentic Chinese buffet menu at a lowest price then definitely Haka is the ultimate stop for you...

Be it starters , main course, or Desserts  their Buffet is always bang for the buck... Last visit was on Saptami for Dinner my gosh the food on offer in Buffet was fabulous!!!!! This place is the best Economical Buffet offer in town beats all competition hands down.

This place provides a good buffet at a reasonable price. And they even have an offer of unlimited cold drinks if u add Rs25 per person. Food was delicious. But I don't know whether it was because we went on Tritiya but service was very slow. They took forever to refill the starters. In the end we did not get to eat much of the yummy starters at all. :(  Also we had to request again and again for our water/cold drinks to be refilled before the staff paid any heed. Anyway, I'm willing to let it slide because the restaurant was packed that day. Overall, worth the money.

Visited this place on 17th Oct , 2015 with family. Opted for non veg buffet. Heard good things about quality of food of this place. Really this place is awesome when it comes to value for money. Non veg starters like chicken drumstick and wanton were good. I liked the prawn item very much. Other items were good too. This place is very pocket friendly and still maintains standard. Kudos to the team.

Hakka in mani square is a good place to hang out with friends . Its basically a Chinese restaurant. The main thing i like about haka is that is really good food at a very low price . Soup , baby corn , chowmien are all really delicious . The deserts are not many and thats the main drawback. Just one thing they should increase the number of items in main course. I will give 3.5 to haka

Haka at Mani Square Mall can be considered as one of the budget friendly restaurants in Kolkata serving quality buffet with a pleasing environment. The ambiance and decor is neat, appealing and the staffs are very courteous. 

I had visited Haka on a Thursday afternoon along with my friends for a lunch buffet and it was no doubt sumptuous. I really liked their chicken soup, chicken drumsticks, chicken fried rice and ginger chilli chicken. However, the chicken fried wantons and chilli mustard shrimps were not much impressive compared to the other dishes. I found the chicken fried wantons to be quite oily. Coming to the desserts, the darsaan and brownies were somewhat so-so. Yet, I liked their ice cream with chocolate sauce. The ice-creams available were of flavours: Mango, Chocolate, Vanilla, and Strawberry. The chocolate sauce over the ice-cream is just beautiful.

I have been there on 2nd october... This restaurant is situated at the top floor of Mani Sqaure.. Its quite a big restaurant...

Ambiance and Decor : The ambiance and decor is good.. but the problem is the place where the food are stored... its too small.. if the restaurant is very crowded it gives a feel of marriage function where people fight to get to the food...

Food : In phone they said they provide veg/non-veg soup.. but sadly i could not find it.. The starters they were providing 2 veg and 2 non-veg.... i must say the veg starters were even better than non-veg one....specially the one(i could not remember the name) which was fry stuffed with cabbage...the non-veg starters were also very good... i enjoyed the starters..  now comes the main course... i totally switched to non-veg part.. they had 1 mix-noodles, 1 chicken fried rice, 1 chicken, shrimp, fish side dish... this is the point i was really disappointed.. i like little spicy foods with strong taste... but food here is very non-spicy and does not have a strong taste to enjoy... all the side dishes available were very tasteless... then there was brownie and ice-cream... the brownie was the best part during the meal... you will have an option of 4 ice-cream.. u can take any... 

Price : for 2 people they charged us just 1000 bucks including soft drinks(we also responded to unlimited soft-drinks offered which costed us Rs 25 each).. so price is reasonable compared to the variety and quantity of food..

Staffs : Very good staffs... Very quick service...¬†

For me this place is good if u have a limited budget...

Great chinese buffet and that too in such affordable rates! Had visited Haka two days back, and opted for buffet. The spread was as usual good. I went for the chicken garlic soup, chicken dumplings which were my personal favourite, pepper garlic drums of chicken, noodles, and fish in mustard sauce, this one my second favourite! And no good food can end without dessert! Therefore mango and vanilla ice cream topped with chocolate sauce along with a waffer- ish thing filled with pineapple jelly was it!

Haka always manages to make its way at the top of the list whenever dinner buffet is considered. All the other items doing not bad at all, the dimsums serve to be the best starters, according to the review based on my 12 visits. Ambience is undoubtedly very cozy and the staff is very hospitable. Planning to hit next week again.... HAKA AWAITS

Value for money buffet. Most of the time the experience was nice and okay. Only once, precisely April 15, ¬†2014 I had taken bite into a boneless fish that reeked of chemicals. Provided they store their pantry in industrial strength- it does somewhat make sense, no matter how much nonsensical it actually is.

Haka is one of my favorites when my taste buds yearn for excellent chinese delicacies!! The buffet includes a variety of items from soups and starters to main course and end it with desserts which includes the yummy honey fried noodles. One can also opt for ala-carte which are equally good. Steamed momos are simply yumm.

I went to this place no preconceived notions. But when the entered the place, i felt good. The ambience was good. About the food, well the soups and the starters were very good. The main course however was very bland and tasteless. One can get tastier main course elsewhere. But the desserts saved the day!! Four flavours of ice creams and darshan and fruit custards were very good. there was a pudding too.  So final verdict.... cheapest buffet... go there for the starters and deserts!! Its worth it!! Also u can buy drinks though they cost a lot!!

Its a complete chinese restaurent having only buffet option. We have taken buffet lunch. It has almost equal options for veg and nonveg. It has dishes of chicken,fish and prawn. Prawn was good among all. One suggestion - they should increase the no of dishes in starters and dessert. Dessert was veryy veryy limited. Starter had also very less options. Only main course were better. Dont keep much expectations. Overall so so, not a memorable one. Value for money is less.

Are you searching for a pocket friendly buffet or lunch??
Your destination should be Haka then.Well it was my first visit to Haka.Got so many good reviews about Haka and trust me Haka did not disappoint me.In starter we had chicken drumStick and some another dish(the name i have forgotten,not worth of remembering too).Drumstick was good enough.I was seeing people to have this dish in good amount.Another thing, if you are paying for a non veg buffet if you want you can also have the veg items.but please it will be better for you if you dont try them.
in the main course there were both noodles and rice.Both were okay.One chicken and fish item was also there.they were very decent too.
For dessert they had fruit cakes and darshana.
Four flavours of ice creams were also there.Vanila,chocolate,mango and tutti frutti.Those were good enough.
See if you are a chinese food lover you must goanna love this place.The waiters were so humble and very polite.They will keep you asking on if u liked the food or not.
Dont forget to grab that unlimited cold drink offer at 25/- only.I would love to be here once more.But they should add some more options for main course and veg buffet.Otherwise it was nice to visit.

Getting a buffet spread under 400 bucks sure is something that attracts you.I had dropped in with 5 of my college friends to try out my very first buffet.Most of the items were veg including the noodles and the rice but tasted great, nonetheless.There were only two nonveg starters,chicken wings and chicken wontons.There was one chicken side dish.The dessert platter consisted of darsaan,pastries and 4 flavours of ice creams accompanied by chocolate sauce.Food is decent.High expectations might ruin your day though.

This is the place which serves one of the best Chinese buffet at a reasonable price..I had my first buffet experience from here when the buffet was priced at 149+tax some where back in my clg days.... From then only I have been coming here....I m pleased that they still keep the reasonable pricing style alive.. Service wise they are very extremely professional n polite...Never fail to impress me with that whenever I visit them.

In general they serve 2 soups veg n non veg, 2salads , 2 veg 2 non veg starters , 2 veg and 2 non veg rice and Noodles.. 2 veg main course 2 non veg main course ( Chicken n fish) in dessert u wl get darshan , brownie n 4 types f ice crm... They serve prawn in special occasions as well...Tastes good too

I have been to this place last Sunday, 6th of September, for my cousin's birthday celebration. It's located at Mani square top floor.

Pros:
1) Cheaper than most other buffet during weekends.
2) Operators are actively refilling any finished item. Also they are swiftly removing soiled dishes. Manager asked about food quality.
3) Enough number of food items with good taste.
4) Good ambiance.

Cons:

1) Food is good but none of them deserves special mention.

2) Ambiance is good but not cosy.

Overall its good place to hangout..

1stly i would like to inform those who are yet to visit #haka, kakurgachhi is that they only offer buffet meals.
My impression :--
Food quality - Not up to the mark. They just cook it. I got a little bit disappointed after having the food.. (My rating- 2.5/5)
Ambiance- quite nice. You'll feel comfortable while having your food. (My rating- 3.5/5)
Staff- they are quite good in behaviour. They will provide the thing of your need as soon as you order them to bring so. (My rating- 4/5)
Pocket pinch- very reasonable. We assumed that the total bill of two of us would exceed 1000, but then found that it was only around 750 which is truly reasonable. (My rating- 4/5)
## they usually close the lunch at 3pm but that day we reached there at 2:45pm. As we had only 15 minutes left, we actually were rushing for the food, but then the manager told us that he had extended the time for us and that made us relaxed.

AUTHENTIC AND LOW PRICED : Haka at the top floor of Mani Sq Mall is a great place to have Chinese at a very modest rate compared to all the over priced eatery on the floor below. Well furinshed, great ambience, soft music and self service combined together is the essence of Haka and its food. You'll never find a buffet empty at this place as there is always more to come from the servicemen. The taste is awesome and very much authentic Chinese. From starters with soup till the desserts consisting brownies and ice cream, everything falls in line perfectly. Two thumbs Up to Haka, coming from a person who is frequent ta this place. Go For It.

Weekday night birthday treat dinner plan... 4 foodies stepped into the stall..its cheap,agree...but compromised to quality and quantity is the key point.Soups and starters are good..but variety of non veg starters are very less..we expected a better starters. Main course was having only one fish and only chicken side dish.Even the chowmein is the normal one,no added saucy style.The only good thing was desert,for me simple and flawless. Impressed with the mannerism of the guys of the stall. Overall its an average attempt, there are lot more better stepin's are there if you prefer quality over quantity.

Haka is one of my favourite Chinese Buffet joints. My first visit to Haka was on my birthday last year, where my better half treated me. The food was delicious, and the buffet spread had both flavours and variety. The fish and meat tasted fresh and the dessert platter, delectable. Love the decor and the ambience. The staff was courteous and helpful. Would love to keep coming back.

I had been to the city centre haka once but it is my first visit to the mani sq. outlet. Located on the 4th floor this is a gem of a place. It wont say it is a big restaurant but it has got ample amount of sitting arrangements. 

The staffs were very polite. Now the food- first we took the soup. The veg one was tomato and the nonveg one was a soy based chicken soup, tangy and refreshing.
In the buffet menu there were wantons and chili chickn drumsticks and with the usual noodles,rice and one fish and chicken item. Over to veg there was a manchurian and dumplings and noodle and rice as usual. Now the food tasted good no doubt.. But i want to point out and say that the chicken and fish in the menu tasted almost same,both with a soy gravy..i mean the fish could have been made like some other preparation.

Off the menu they served us a paneer prep which was really really yum..the darsaan was fun. There were brownies and icecream with choclate sauce in desserts..

We had two breezers which cost us an extra 360 with added tax..other than that the price was reasonable..
Definitely worth going if you have not been already.

Visited haka a few days back..The ambience is okay,nothing too special..The kitchen seemed clean..The staff is courteous..Coming to the food,it is pretty good..Although there isn't too much variety,the quality of the food is good and offer great value for money...It is one of the most budget friendly buffets you can find..The buffet comprised of soup(not too good),starters-chicken sui mai and lollipop(I loved these) and for main course Chicken hakka noodles,chicken fried rice,chilli chicken and fish in hoisin sauce..For dessert there is a choice of 4 ice cream flavours along with darsan and brownie..Overall a very good experience..I'll definitely like to visit again!

If you want to have a zesty lunch or dinner without burning a whole in your pocket then haka is the stop for you, starters was good, wantons were the best, taste of soup was poor.. In main course, rice wasn't that good, it was poor than average but the noodles & the other two side dish was good; coming to deserts, was the best part, it was excellent ! The staffs are very polite & well behaved !

A nice place in Mani square of you really want a pocket friendly Chinese Buffet.. Starts from soup to chicken starter along with delicious momos.. they are good in taste.. Then chicken noodles, chicken fried rice, one chicken and one fish main course as side dish.. Fish was very yummy..there are crispy fried noodles kept aside, if you want you can take it with your chicken noodles to create a chopsuey texture.. In dessert, two flavors of ice cream is there, along with mouth watering Darshan and chocolate cake.. A good place for dinner..

Went today after a long discussion where to go. Mainly we chose it due to cheapest buffet.
471‚Çπ per head. Coming to my experience with haka,as usual main course don't make you excited to carve for some particular dish,rather prawn fish chicken gets away on their own. But fish item was bit tasty,we preferred it!
Chicken drums was definitely good,we ate it in large amounts. Veg items were very good.
In desserts, coconut rolls were superb,we enjoyed it. 4 flavours of ice cream were there,tasted all, good it was also!
Staffs were really doing great job by refilling very quickly!
Btw,buffet is not a place to tickle your taste buds ,people go there to have food and food not to relish it not to feel it,so chefs don't give much attention to quality ,they cook it just!
Haka,but,is doing a good job by serving buffet at such low price maintaining the basic quality ! And,like others,I also didn't like plastic glass and jar!
Loved the buffet,would recommend to go there with friends - have adda over food!

Probably the best budget buffet in the town. Ambiance is okayish. Food quality needs to be nurtured well. They have a long menu in their buffet course. You can really praise about the starters but the main course is too dull. The hakka noodles and fried rice could have been prepared in better way. Anyway overall satisfied as a complete buffet. The place can be ideal to give treats.

Less costlier than the others at the same floor... Reasonably priced restaurant with same old boring menu and food... Well some of them are well cooked and some of them are not.. If you want something unique and feels like you should be here once again, there are no wow factor... Biting on average but trying to give you a evening which you should remember for a long time.. The restaurant needs to pull their socks to make it great.. This place is having a huge locational advantage at Mani square but fails to meet an uniqueness where others are performing brilliantly...

Seriously the worst experience ever. After calling up in the morning to book a seat, they said it's not needed as seats are available on weekdays. After bringing my family and friend to celebrate that the entire restaurant has been booked. So not available for others. Any restaurant worth it's two cents have separate areas for parties. Horrible experience. Never coming back here again. Restaurants like these will never flourish.

A chinese joint with lots to eat and none to spare... starters are always good to start with... and the hunan chicken drum was just the dish to start with.... chicken wonton or simply chicken fried dumplings were smoooth.... moving on with rice noodles and fish.. had an average yet convincing taste.... the assorted flavours of ice cream were in plenty but a lack lustre taste... would like to see more and new ice creams flavours in the menu.... till the next visit here..... hunan drums will keep playing a tune on my tongue... :) ;)

My first visit to this place. Cordial staffs, but the seating arrangement could have been cozier. The plastic glasses and those red coloured PVC jugs gave a cheap look to the table. Coming to the food, we went on a weekday and opted for buffet (dinner). The soups, momos and the other starter was tender. The main course had rice, noodles, chili chicken, fish. The fish wasn't houri the mark. Oops, I missed the wantons !!! Yeah, it's a must have dish of Haka. The deserts have is a reason for delight though. The mousse,brownies and the variety of ice creams were available. They also had another Chinese dessert, which I can't recall the name. That is worth trying. Cost: Rs 1144 for buffet of 3.
So, to conclude, a great low budget resturaunt. You can't expect Mainland China level of buffet in this amount.

Okay... First off- Haka is NOT cheap! But it definitely is worth the amount you end up fishing out of your wallets. We are talking about the buffet of course. Individual dishes are good too... Such as the peppery chicken dishes and those exquisite dim sums... The buffet wins you over with its wide range of delicacies... The desserts are especially worth having. Should you feel hungry for some Chinese with an all you can eat arrangement and you don't mind ending up paying a bit more than usual... Do pay this place a visit!

Haka is owned by speciality group. I went there on a weekday dinner. I entered the restaurant as early as 7 pm. I was well greeted and shown my table. At INR 414 AI , its were cheaply priced for a buffet. Though being a pure vegeterian I always feel that items offered to us in buffets are always less in compsrison to non veg people but they compensated us by offering one extra starter & main course each. Decor was average. Staffs were well trained and they keep on asking if I like the food.
Coming to food items. Lemon corriander soup was divine. Just loved it. In starters, fried wonton & vegetable salt & pepper were served hot and it tasted amazing. Crispy chili babycorn, the extra starter, was average. The starters & souos were served on table. But I was suprised to find these starters in buffet also. When I tasted the same starters from buffet, It was not hot & that tasty. Have conveyed the same to the management.
Main course offered were ordinary. Hakka noodles, fried rice , veg potato corn in chili soya sauce & stir fried vegetable with dry red chili. Firstly all the items in buffet were not hot. So it effected the taste. But when I conveyed the same to the staff they immediately prepared fresh and hot for me. That was nice of them.
Deserts were good. Specially I liked mousse and chocolate icecream with chocolate sauce. 
Overall the experience was decent but buffet food need to be improved and should be served hot.

One of my worst dining experiences ever - this place really sucks !
Casually, went to Mani Square as it was a Sunday evening. Just strolling around, learnt that Haka @ 5th floor is offering buffets at Rs. 214 (A.I.) from 4 pm - 6 pm. Had heard decent reviews about this place earlier, so, decided to give a try.
Entered the restaurant at around 4:30 pm and noticed that the tables were still being cleaned and more than half the items to be served were not ready, so, waited for around 20 minutes. Since buffet was discounted, only a few items were offered - which is perfectly ok.
Ambience appeared decent as the seating arrangements were designed to appear China-like. Also, an LCD was playing a Cricket match.

For Veg starters, only Veg Salt and Pepper was there, which was cold and downmarket. It contained only half-fried potatoes - I barely had 2-3 pcs of the same. For main course, Veg Fried Rice was there which was decent and Veg Noodles - which I did not taste. Corn Potato Chilli gravy was also there, but surprisingly,¬†the staff told that no bowls are available for serving this gravy. Ultimately, I had to carry the gravy in a quarter plate. I have seen better standards in road side dhabas ! For salad, cucumber along with a couple of carrot slices and kimchi was there.
As soon as I went for the second helping, a staff came and hurriedly cleaned my table - I do not know why! Is this the hotel etiquettes taught to Haka staff?

As per the menu, Chocolate ice cream was to be served, but they served vanilla ice cream. I requested for correcting this, which was done in sometime.

Darsaan was available, which was crisp and nice.
The staff was very rude - as if he were doing a favour allowing me to eat. Somebody told that buffet gets over at 5:30 pm, somebody told at 5:45 and somebody told that it gets over at 6 pm - they just wanted the customers to gulp down some food and leave. Service is very poor. I am very sure that a couple of staff were bitching about me for reasons, which I do not know - perhaps, may be because I was casually dressed or may be I had multiple servings of desserts. I could make this out as they were looking at me and laughing.
Most indecent behaviour I have ever seen !
I was not having free food - I have paid for whatever I was having, so, I will not take this shit !
I simple paid the bill and walked off without tipping !

Request the management that if they are serving food at discount, they should not atleast discount the service quality, infrastructure and decency.

Visited the place quite a few number of times. Weekend buffet is more value for money in terms of the number of items as well as the quality. Crispy chicken fried Wonton is just the perfect starter. Prawn in  Tsing Hoi style is too good. Overall all the items have the authentic Chinese pinch. Considering the price , unarguably one of the best Chinese buffet in town.

An okayish sort of chinese buffet restaurant,I say the word okayish because it is so but u cannot expect anything better than this for the amount they charge.There were only two starters in non veg,a chicken drumstick sort of thing which was good and another is chicken momo which was again okayish sort of.There were no prawn items in either starters or main course which is a dissapointment in chinese restaurants but overall the other main course items was not bad namely chowmein,fried rice,boneless fish and chicken and the desserts were also good.There is another special offer in this place,pay extra Rs 25 and get unlimited cold drinks which is not bad at all.The service was also good and fast,overall I don't think anybody will get dissapointed with the taste and quality of the food.

Went there one afternoon on a visit to Kolkata. Ordered the regular buffet. 

Food: variety in starter was less, there were like 2 non veg starters. Main course was regular fare for a Chinese restaurant, fried rice, 3 types of main course, including fish, prawns and chicken. Desserts were pretty good, but again variety could have been better. Food was decent, nothing extraordinary.

Pricing: reasonably priced, hence, despite the less variety, worth a visit.

Service: could have been better, starters were expected to be served to us, but we ultimately had to go and get it ourselves. But it was a Sunday, and the restaurant was crowded, so can't blame the servers.

Ambience: OKish

Worth a try definitely!

I had gone to Mani Square last week with the only forethought of visiting Haka. Already I had got a good review, but I still wanted to check out the place on my own. The ambiance is pretty good and elemental. The staff too are very polite and friendly. Their service was quite cordial and accommodating. Now coming to the food: I had taken the non-veg buffet. The starters were quite delectable with manchow soup, chicken wantons, and chicken drumsticks. Since I had gone for a lunch, the menu was a bit different from the dinner time. The main course consisted of mixed fried rice, noodles and two different types of side dishes and there were other dishes as well. The food tasted pretty delicious and the buffet was unlimited. The dessert part was yummy! The various types of ice creams, puddings and sweet temptations-completely irresistible!
The price too is quite reasonable.
Definitely I would like to dine at this place, again.

Great satisfaction for your craving for chinese food in kolkata! Though they dont have the option of an a la carte, one is not disappointed with the menu,especially when one is a vegetarian! We were treated to some delicious food which comprised: sweetcorn soup,crispy chilli babycorn (which was lipsmacking!), chilli paneer and mini dimsums for starters. Main course included: kimchi (my absolute favourite of all the items!) Noodles, veggies done in a sweet n sour gravy and fried rice. The staff was extra courteous and surprised us with veggies done in garlic sauce (knowing there were not enough vegetarian options)! To tickle our sweet tastebuds there were 4 varieties of icecream! Mango,chocolate,vanilla with chocolate sauce and tooti fruity( the best of the lot!) The relaxed atmosphere and cosy seating space added to the eating experience. Big thumbs up! :D

We just went to Mani Square for a Movie on last Saturday. It ends near 2 pm. We both feel hungry. We plan to eat KFC Chicken, but we thought why not try HAKA Restaurant. We know that they only serve Shrimp on Weekends. So we change the plan and move to HAKA. At 2.30 pm we found that HAKA totally full house. We put our booking in their guestbook. After 10 mins we found a table. They offer 471/- with all taxes for weekend buffet lunch, also extra 25+7/- for unlimited cold drinks. We took both offer. It is probably the cheapest  but standard Chinese Buffet in Kolkata I think. It's just beyond perfect for pocket friendly yet a grand (almost) dinning with friends, family or colleagues.

We saw the entire restaurant is full and good to see that everyone enjoyed the food. They told us that they only serve the Soup and the 1st plate of Starter. After that you can join the mob who gathers almost every time near the buffet table. 

On the buffet menu they served with Spicy Tomato Basil Soup, Chicken Sweet Corn Soup,  Veg Dimsums, Potato Fry, Chicken Wantons, Chicken Lollipop, Chili Paneer, Veg Noodles, Veg  Fried Rice, Egg Chicken Fried Rice, Egg Chicken Hakka Noodles, Haka Chili Chicken in Sauce, Fish in Green Sauce, Shrimp in Red Sause, Darsaan, 4 type of Ice Cream Flavor Mango, Chocolate, Vanilla & Tutti Frutti with Chocolate Sauce and Pinapple Cake and Wanton type one desert preparation, made with coconut.

The Chicken Sweet Corn Soup was good, Chicken Wantons, Chicken Lollipop was Awesome taste. I took lots of pieces, both. Veg Dimsums, Potato Fry also had good taste. Non Veg Noodles was good, but Non Vrg Rice too simple like normal rice. Chicken item was average taste, Fish item also average taste, but the Basha fish itself very soft and tasty. The Shrimp was good and spicy also. Next move on to desert section where I found only Ice Cream is a good option. Others were very average. Darsaan taste like Khaja. Ice Cream with Chocolate Sauce always my choice. I enjoyed the Ice Cream twice. Here only I ate the main course because their main course items were also good taste. With this budget I am satisfied what they were served. Only I miss one extra starter. I think for that reason I give them 3.5. Haka is too Good, but not like MAINLAND CHINA.Haka's food is delicious, especially Chicken Wonton I found very interesting.

The Ambience is very classy. I like that. The service also good and prompt. For example,  whenever you leave your table, they change the used plates. Overall a nice experience with affordable Chinese Buffet and highly recommended.

Been this outlet of HAKA couple of times.Because Chinese is my favourite cuisine and also the people i love , celebrated two of the important occasions here.First,i treated my bf here after getting placed and second, my 22nd bday with my family.They don`t have huge range of items in the buffet but whatever they have is sufficient for a good meal.My personal favourite items are chicken dumplings(which are available only in the weekends i guess), dry chili chicken, Chicken wantons,shrimps and the desserts especially darshan.Rice, noddles and the side dishes are very light and perfect.It has a very comfortable ambiance.I would like to visit it again.

Awesome buffet at Haka mani square. Probably a little downside on the no. of fish preparations and the total no. of chicken preparations in a buffet. But great collection of desserts and great taste of all items. Reasonable price wrt a buffet.

Cheapest buffet in the town but with great Chinese food. Starters are of good quality, main courses need some more varieties , as it's been same for too long. The deserts are really good in comparison with the buffet rates. Overall a good experience. üòÉ

The Chinese Buffet at Haka was a moderately good experience. I was out for lunch with a friend and dropped by at this place. The items were spread in many. But the taste of the Chinese cuisine was not up to the mark. Authentic Chinese dishes are better in taste in comparison to the other Chinese outlets that I have visited. I specially liked the dessert spread at this place. The main course was not good. The rice and noodles dishes were without any flavors. The Fish and Shrimp dishes were better than the Chicken preparation. Man-Chow soup was good along with other starters. We were provided with complementary drinks as we paid via ICICI Bank card. That was a pleasant bonus to our tummies. Overall, a nice experience of Chinese Buffet.

We had the lunch buffet. Two of the great things about this place were the options and the service. Food was decent, not extraordinary but tasted good. Did like the babycorn and the chilly paneer particularly. Had icecreams for desert which were great too. Overall good place for great value and a fun filled meal.

We had been there for a lunch buffet on the occasion of pre-US-leaving party of one of my cousins. The ambience was cool but the music could have been better. The decor was nice and the service was warm.

Coming to food, the menu contained an amazing array of Chinese delicacies. The starters were tasty, especially the chicken drumsticks and dumplings were delicious. The soup was OK. The main course was not so appetizing. The prawn was good although. The deserts were flavoursome with four ice-cream flavours, chocolate brownies and chocolate sauce. 

Overall, it was a nice experience and worth an afternoon spent with close ones.

Had a weekend lunch buffet here. Variation and taste is not comparable with Mainland China. But that is not an issue since it is very reasonable in price. Starters and deserts are quite good and tasty. Main course is not impressive. Also they do not give complimentary drink and there is no "eat five pay four" provision like Mainland China. However keeping in mind the cost, the buffet is overall good and recommended.

Today's lunch out was in Haka.. mani square.  I preferred buffet menu as it was nice. The menu wasn't tempting I would say but not even bad that one would say no . So I thought of let's give it a try . Coming to ambience of the restaurant.  It was nothing exciting at all .they should improve in it. The service was good . Food was good too. The tomato spicy basil soup I loved it and crispy chilli sweet potatoes were also very yummy. The buffet had less variety but was quiet sufficient.  I would suggest them to add more varieties in deserts as there was just browine ice cream coconut wanton and darsaan. So could have added some pastries and all . Overall good experience!

The ambience with good spaced out seating arrangement with low music belting out in the background provides for the great time to catch a conversation with a friend. The starters of Chicken Dimsum was very very tasty and I ended up ordering for a second serving too! The main course at their buffet was sumptuously spread out with the all time favourite stir fried hakka noodles, fish in white sauce and great shrimps. The desserts could have been done better though rather than the age old brownie-icecream combo.

Located at the City center 1 on the first floor, this is a large place but I find the seating arrangements to be a bit cramped.
Simply bored of their menu that's all I can say. I truly do not see a single variety in their menu time and again when I have visited this place. The momo and chicken wings are nice rest are still boring.¬†

Deserts OK types nothing special. If you have visited this more than thrice no point in going for the 4th time.

I had tried Haka in City Centre 1 long back and it was pretty good at that time. This weekend we went to Haka, Mani Square for dinner. It was an utter disappointment. The spread was not satisfactory. They had corn momo as a starter, which tasted awful. The other starters were OK but the main course rice & noodles (non-veg) were extremely oily. I love Chinese food and would not expect a so called "Special" chain restaurant to serve such oily food.¬†
None of the items were tasty, they were very very plain and blunt. I dare to compare them with Mainland China, they are not even a close competitor of a good Chinese restaurant. Very very disappointing!
I had ordered for a bowl of plain boiled noodles for my toddler and two glasses of fresh lime soda for us. The boiled noodles were covered with a lot of oil and the fresh lime had no taste.¬†
Finally, I thought of filling myself with some good desert. More to my disappointment, they had kept almost liquid mousse. Can't we expect the chefs to know how to make a desert? Absolutely waste! The person who was serving the icecream did not even bother that the water from his hand was dropping on the desert. Yaks!¬†
I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE! ¬†
Haka manager: If you want to be a part of the specialty tag, ¬†then PLS IMPROVE. Please do not think that public will take anything anywhere without a single complain!

Visited this restaurant on 5th July 2015. Though this is not the first time mentioned the date for review purpose and obviously this won't be the last visit either.
First and foremost if you like Chinese this place will give you lots of variety to please your taste buds.

Starters- just awesome especially the drumstick/lollypop chicken, dumpling, fried vegetables in sauce. The starters are so appealing and so tasty you need to visit twice or thrice just in that section to fill the plates

Main course- Though the hakka noodles and fried rice are not so special a special mention needs to be given to the side dishes. The moshabi chicken, and fish prep was awesome. But best of d lot is the shrimp in oyster sauce, it is indeed their speciality since I was awed by this dish previously as well.

Desserts- Though there is not much variety here the mousse and ice cream satisfies our sweet tooth.

Now with the entire buffet at only 468 (+25 since we ordered unlimited 7up) this is a steal deal. The starter and side dish is awesome only the main course and desserts could show improvement. But with this price this is hardly a matter to complaint. Hope they continue this and look forward to the next visit.

Haka is a place I had visited a couple of times as a middle schooler. It was all √† la carte then. Great Chinese. Reasonable prices.

Recently, I got the opportunity to try out their buffet. It was a weekday. No rush. The food, although very good, was not √† la carte quality. But at that price, no one can even touch this place. Decent ambience. Can't speak much about the service, as it was a buffet. Although what I can say is, you will never find a tray empty. Surely a place to visit again.

I found the starters really good along with the blue lagoon drink that was complementary.. In the main course the rice was different and good... Tasty noodles n chicken... However I did not find the fish preparation that good..
Coming to dessert I got my personal favourite- chocolate brownie with chocolate sauce n 4 different flavours of icecream ... Overall we had a great time n won't mind going there again ..

Want to have e decent Chinese buffet without making a hole in your pocket? Haka is the only option here! This particular outlet in Mani Square serves on Buffet. The City Center 1 branch server both buffet and √† la carte. Nice and crisp variety of good Chinese. The momos, dumplings and chicken lollipop are to die for. Noodles, Prawn and Chicken sides dishes are awesome. Though not impressed with their fish platter, but there are always room for improvements. A special sweet dish named Darshan are pretty delicious. Overall a nice experience with affordable Chinese Buffet.

From a long time I was trying to visit this place. The ‚Çπ295 non veg buffet attracted me actually. But got the opportunity to visit after price got increased. 
Anyway, coming to the buffet, the food was awesome. A lot of items literally confused me. Tried only non-veg. Started with chicken sweet corn soup and prawn chips. Then starter chicken wings tossed in sauce, chicken fried wanton. Coming to the main course there were noodles, fried rice, chicken in black pepper sauce, fish in tomato coriander sauce & prawn in fresh lemon coriander sauce. In desert there were mango mousse, darsan, bread & butter pudding & four types of ice cream. 
The service was very good & prompt. Behaviour of waiters & restaurant manager was good.
First experience to Haka was perfectly good.

What you pay is what you get! This saying defines this place. Food was ok but the spread of the lunch buffet was not worth the 30 minute wait to enter the place. What was definitely noteworthy was the pathetic service they had on offer! Was told that the vegetarian starter was not kept along with the spread but will be served directly in the table. I cannot comment on what the starter was like since it only arrived when I was helping myself with the desert!!

Haka is known for its buffet, especially among the student circle. It is owned by the Specialty Restaurant chain (the same group which owns Mainland China, Flame & Grill and Oh! Calcutta).

Haka is extremely affordable, has quality food, good ambience and really pleasant and helpful staff.

I have been to Haka 3-4 times now, and their food taste is quite consistent, but the buffet items are kinda repetitive.
Nevertheless, the buffet is really good value for money. Food is refilled every few minutes, and is always hot and fresh.
The Vegetarian selection was kinda meager, but the non veg section was really good.
Location of the restaurant is in the top floor of Mani Square, extremely easy to find.

Overall a 4.5/5.0 for me, -0.5 for lack of variety in buffet. A must visit for college goers, big foodies or anyone who would love to have Chinese without breaking the bank.

Went to Haka.

It was almost full only a few tables were empty around 8 PM on a Saturday evening. 

Staff were very courteous, helpful and provided nice service.

The restaurant serves Chinese Buffet meals at Rs.468 per head on weekends. 

We opted for Veg Buffet. 

Menu for Veg Buffet on 20th June 2015 was as following

Soup: Veg Manchow Soup
Starters:¬† Baby Corn, Chilli Corn Potato, Veg Dumplings
Main Course: Three treasures vegetables in Red Sauce, Mixed Vegetables in Mahlak Sauce, Veg Haka Noodles, Chilli Paneer, Veg Fried Rice Shizuan Style, Kimchi and Pickled Cucumber.¬†¬† 
Dessert: 4 Flavours of Ice Cream, Mousse, Fruit Cake, Darsan

The food was not to our liking. Soup was average no taste in it. In starters, Baby Corn was good whereas Chili Potato was too oily and Veg Dumpling was horrible. 
Main Course: Both the curries were below par, Rice was good and Noodles were also average.

Desserts: Mousse was good.

We also ordered Virgin Mojito which was too sweet.

Only Saving grace was service. Starters and Soup was served on table and staff offered us Orientation to the Buffet. 

I will avoid this place due to quality of food.

Also the place is too noisy and sometimes it resembles as fish market.

I had been to Haka for a family get together and I was blown away by their buffet spread. From soups to starters and main course, each item was delectable. It was quite crowded but that did not affect the service. The waiters were readily available and were quick as well. The desserts could have been better but I can discount that for the rest of the items which had consistency in taste despite being a buffet. It was very reasonably prices as well esp since we were a group of 15. Surely recommended for repeated visits.

Kolkata's chinese cuisine has almost become synonymous with Haka as far as popularity is concerned, although I find it overhyped. Haka is undoubtedly one of the cheapest chinese eateries in our city . Its buffet accounts for minimum pocket pinch. But its coign of vantage probably ends there. Food is not that good. Chicken sweet corn soup, Chilli potato, Chicken lollipop were ok.¬† I was very much disappointed with Chicken szechuan pepper, Chicken wanton, Prawn chips. Egg fried rice, Chicken veg noodles were below average. The only palatable items were Chicken drumsticks , Vanilla+Butter scotch+Mango ice cream scoops with chocolate sauce , and Darsun... Furthermore, Ambience and decor are pretty average in the mani sq outlet...

Simply among the best places that will never leave you disappointed and in fact will always leave you with that special satisfaction that you get after a full range buffet with absolute value for money
Having been here thrice and also once in the city centre outlet I chose this one again when my turn came for a big family treat and their ambiance, space and lighting have always made me feel good about my choice. This is simply awesome to spend quality time offer lunch and dinner. Both the management and the stuff deserve a praise for the way they are running the show. Customer satisfaction is very high on their priority and everything from serving drinks to refilling buffet containers and taking away the plates I.e their entirety operations is so nicely streamlined that all the customers need to care about is spending time with their families and friends. The buffet on offer is a complete range filled with utterly delicious items. The wantons , the shrimp and the fish are worth special mention but rest all were eaten with equal delight. Absolute satisfaction.  Keep up the good work

After drenching the overpouring yet pleasant rain, six of us finally found and took refuge in Mani square.. Our tummies were going crazy..and so, we decided to eat at Haka..Haka was a restaurant which was soundly ignored by me..as I ventured into the world of other Chinese restaurants..and after trying Haka, I can ( with utmost pleasure) it is where I want to be when I go to the frequently visited mall... The quality of food is quite nice, and the ambience is subtle and peaceful..though there were ample people.. We tried the lunch buffet..my personal favourite was the fish in mustard sauce and the chicken wantons..the deserts were decent enough and the service and behaviour of staff was worth of mention..though their plates could've been a tad larger and their entr√©es improved...they managed to catch my attention well enough...they ROCKED ME TO MY CORE!!!

This has to be the best buffet in kolkata if you are a student with limited pocket money. Good quality food with a good ambience. For those who have a tummy and is proud of it should not miss this buffet

One of the pocket friendly quality Chinese joints in a city which goes bonkers on Chinese cuisine :-) and yes, do try the lamb chopsticks here, so soft and succulent ! Goes great along with a chilled beer !

I have been here twice and both my experiences have been quite pleasant. This outlet is specifically for buffet. The prices are pocket friendly and weekday lunch would give you the best deals. The ambience could have been a little better, thought the Haka CC1 has good decor. The food is of good quality and the buffet serves a good variety.  It is a good worth for money. Quite recommended if you are willing to give up on the ambience for pocket friendly food.

Food is not great. Pretty much average. Probably the cheapest chinese buffet in town. City Centre HAKA is better than this Mani Square outlet.Buffet is worth Rs. 373/- inclusive of all taxes for weekday lunch. You can add unlimited pepsi to your meal. That is worth another 25 bucks.The buffet had¬†Spicy Tomato Basil Soup, Chicken Sweet Corn Soup, Kimchi, Prawn Wafers, Veg Dimsums, Chicken Wantons, Chicken Hunan Style with bones (I wish it was boneless), Fried Rice,Noodles, Haka Chili Chicken in Sauce, Fish in Hot Garlic Sauce, Darsaan, Ice Cream and Brownie.

The drinks were good. There was mosambi ridges, mint leaves, Tropicana orange juice and soda. We had to ask for the ice.
It was pretty much downhill from there. The drumsticks, served under the suspicious title of Hunan Chicken, was possibly the only saving grace. The Chicken Soup was watery, the Fish in Chilli Wine and Prawns in Singapore (yellow sauce) was bland with a mild leaning towards salty. Ching's Secret could possibly produce similar results at the hands of an amateur cook! The Darsan was indeed divine- no hint of honey, or even the slightest idea of what it's supposed to be 
My advice- Don't do this if you value your tongue more than your wallet.

Been there last week and really had a bad time.. Well It was my first time and didn't expect this type of food quality. No doubt the ambience was good and the waiters were very friendly but the food was not upto the mark.. The chicken wantons and the fish preparation was worth having otherwise everything had a very bland taste.. :(

This is an awesome restaurant by specialities group.
i opted for a weekday lunch buffet(non-veg). i must say it is very pocket-friendly according to its class.
food quality is very good. they provided many varieties of starter, main course as well as desserts..
staff behaviour was very good..
i personally liked their starters, fish in wine sauce and assorted pastries a lot.
cherry on the cake was that they provided 300ml of refreshing pepsi per person @rs¬†25 only(on request) which helped us quite a bit to beat the heat of kolkata at this scorching summer..

So i visited haka a few days ago.The ambience was very nice.The staffs were very helping.But the buffet at 495 was a little overpriced.The menu had quite a few starters ranging from fried wantons,taipei chicken.Coming to the main course...it was elaborate...but unfortunately the same menu was repeated as we went before too.There were schezwan fried rice,shrimps,chilli fish and a chicken recipe.In the desert there was very few options like carrot cake,ice cream and darsan.

However,, two things you have to work on... 
a. Please don't be so eager to take away my plates... I know you want to keep my table clean when more food comes in.. But sometimes it gets really annoying... you'll have to judge that... Thats people skills. 

b. You are a Chinese speciality restaurant... For godsake please keep chopsticks..,

I've been to Haka a couple of times with family and friends since it's one of my fav resto wen it comes to buffet. Very reasonable for a variety of delicious food items... my fav are the soup,Dimsums,chicken lollipop, chicken noodles,prawn items,wanton,fried rice,custard,different flavoured ice-creams with hot chocolate sauce,darsan and brownie...yumm...my mouth is watering...Every item is served Hot.
Shifting of the buffet ws a great idea! Staffs are well behaved including manager. They are respectful and helpful.
At the rate of 371 and 409 they serve soup and starters on d table .. U cnt expect more because u will not get quality food and service in this price anywhere.
Keep it up HAKA!!

I visited this place last week. Firstly I found no one to greet at the front desk and to show the table. We went inside and found a free table for ourselves. Then we had to wait for nearly 7-10 mins to get the attention of the staff though the restaurant was not crowded. It irritated us a lot. Then the mocktails were served at the end. I will never visit this place again.

They provide a number of items in the buffet, specially the starters from soup to wanton everything was there. The main course was good too... But a more variation should there in dessert I guess.

Pocket friendly and tasty chinese buffet, variety is less though.

If you want to have a good chinese buffet at affordable prices then this is the place to be. They probably offer the cheapest buffet in kolkata. Seating arrangements are good, ambience average. Waiters are friendly but service may be slow at times. Its better to go through the buffet items yourself and take what you like rather than waiting for the waiters to serve you the starters and all.

The variety of items offered in buffet is small. Two veg starters and two non veg starter. Veg starters are average. But the fried chicken wanton is just awesome. The other chicken starter is good too. They make awesome snacks along with beer. Main course offers noodles, fried rice, garlic chicken, veg manchurian etc. Noodles are tasteless, i would suggest only go for the rice. Garlic chicken is okaish. The desert offers only four flavours of ice creams and chocolet sauce, i guess cant expect much given the price. Overall a good buffet option, nothing extra ordinary.

Update:  After quite a while, recently went for a saturday dinner buffet. Although prices has gone up, i must say the food quality has improved too. This time the chicken drumstick was even better. Main course items had general tao' s chicken, items with fish and shrimps etc. Desert had more options and all were satisfactory. Weekend dinner buffet costs rs 543 all included. Updating my previously given 3.5 rating to 4.

Haka has been one of my favourite places to eat in Mani square for quite some time. I have been here roughly 5-6 times in the past few years. The food is good and most importantly affordable for college students like me.  Not many people can appreciate chinese food, some may feel it is bland. Personally I find the food here tasty and filling. Only glitch is that the menu has been the same over the years. A little change would probably renew footfall in this place.

Had not a friend given his treat here, I wouldn't have tried this place.

So many freaking items made with tenderness. You won't be able to finish eating as if. It could go on as they keep refilling. And it was Christmas eve back then. :)

Located inside Mani Square Mall, Haka is a chain of Chinese restaurants quickly becoming very popular. 
To be very honest I have been here only once and have tried buffet. The experience was rather gloomy and hence never came back again. 
The buffet spread isn't extensive but surely looks tempting but the taste is rather horrendous, they absolutely have no standard when it comes to their dishes. The USP about this place is that their buffet spread is somewhat cheap as compared to the others and definitely fits one budget for giving group treats to friends and family but to save some money I wouldn't torture people close to me with their food for sure. This one should be avoided.

The buffet is a good affordable option of fine dining in the whole Mani square mall. Loved the prawns in white sauce, absolutely scrumptious. The setting of the restaurant is pleasant. The service is quite efficient. They keep refilling the items very quickly with freshly cooked dishes of the same. Overall a very good experience of the buffet since being a gourmet dint mean I can eat a great deal in quantity.

Food: You should try Chicken Drumsticks. The fried rice and the prawn item was also good. Desserts are OK.
Should order Unlimited Pepsi for Rs. 25/-

Service: Not so good. We asked every time for something (Please serve the Pepsi, please give me the paper napkins, please give me the spoons and ....).

Ambience: Good ambiance.

Suggestion for you: This is an 'OK' type restaurant. As the price is less than others, you should not expect the quality food like others.¬†You can enjoy your weekends with your friends if you want a budget restaurant, but should not spend your time with your special guest.

**Location = 4th Floor, Mani Square Mall, EM ByPass.

**Brief = I have been there many a times, mostly after watching movies at CineMax.

**Ambiance = Pretty large and spacious. The seats are comfortable and they give you a warm welcome always.

**Things Tried = My preference have mostly been the buffet, it being one of the cheapest in Kolkata.

In starters they provide Chicken Clear Soup with the Prawn wafers(Papads), the soup tastes okay-ish with chicken chunks.
Then comes the Chicken Fried Wantons and Chicken Drumsticks. The drumsticks are spicy and very soft. The wantons taste decent with the sauce.

One can opt for Unlimited Beverages(soft) by spending Rs.25/- extra.
I obviously try it everytime, ending up drinking 5-6 glasses of them.

In the Main Course, they have Egg fried rice, Chicken hakka Chow,Hunan Chicken and a fish item, which tastes better than all the rest. They dont have much items in the buffet spread, which I feel a bit disappointing.

One can try similar Veg buffet spread also, but after gobbling too much of starters and the main courses, I haven't had the calibre to try them.

In the desserts you have darsan(sweet chips),chocolate rolls,Mousse,Ice creams and hot chocolate sauce.

**Recommended = The non-veg buffet is quite satisfying.

**Service = Always they serve you with a smile, and they duly inquire about your needs.

**Purse Check = Rs.800/- for 2 people on a Weekday (Non Veg Buffet lunch). Very cheap :P

**Overall = A good place to have some decent buffet in cheap prices.

Cheers Haka :P

Present on the 4th floor of Mani Square, Haka offers arguably one of the cheapest Chinese buffets in Kolkata. I went for a lunch buffet on a Sunday. The sheer choice was staggering. One could pick dishes from both the veg and the non veg sections simultaneously. The soup with the prawn crackers at the start of the meal was quite hearty. This was followed by some Chinese salads, among which the kimchi stood out as a clear winner. Among the starters the one that clearly stood out was the hot basil chicken. The noodles and rice themselves were quite unimpressive in terms of flavour, but the main dishes were quite good. Even the dessert section provided an array of choices, from four different flavours of ice-cream to pastries, brownies and of course, Darsaan, that staple of the indo-chinese restaurant. Is it the very best chinese you can have in town? No, not really. But, considering the price range, it is certainly an offer that cannot be refused.

I have been a fan of Haka since 2011, when I visited this place for the first time. Nothing too fancy, yet a place that serves a nice fare at such cheap prices. I have only tried the buffet and never felt like trying out the a la carte, though i have heard the a la carte to be better. Anyways, i think haka is the cheapest chinese buffet available in kolkata. So whenever im short of cash, but need to satisfy the foodie in me, i head straight to haka.
Coming to the food. Some find it too good. Some, like me, find it okayish, not too bad, not to good. And some hate it. The soup that they serve in the weekday lunch is alright. The weekend dinner soup is heavy and nice. I eat too many prawn chips with it, every single time. Haha! I'M IN LOVE WITH THE KIMCHI. Its tangy, spicy and a mess of heaven. I always eat too much of kimchis in my every visit. Since im not much of a spicy food lover, i cut down the spice content with pickled cucumbers. I love it so much so, that i eat some of it even after dessert to keep the taste in my mouth for long *wink*
Among the starters, the one that everyone takes in abundance is the chicken lollipop thing. Its really crispy, tangy and oh-so-good. I also love the chicken momos that they serve in the weekend dinner. The veg wontons are nice. Everything else is OKAY.
Coming to the main course, i totally heart the prawn item they serve in the weekend dinner. Its the best among the mains i feel. I also like the thai fish from the weekday lunch. The fried rice is forever bland, no matter when you go. So i take the noodles. Its good. The fish in oyster sauce, doesnt taste the same. But palatable. The chicken items are good. Haka doesnt have a huge spread, so theres nothing much to choose from, especially on a weekday lunch.
The dessert always have the darsaan and ice creams. In the weekend dinner they have fruit custard and a bread pudding in addition. I cant eat too much of sweets, so i stick to the ice cream mainly. And the brownie slice from weekday lunch.
Overall haka is averagely satisfactory. I dont mind going there time and again. For lunch, they have an offer of unlimited soft drink at 25rs extra. The price is really reasonable. Recommended. Cheerie!

I have been to the Outlet of Haka at the Mani Square Mall, Kankurgachi 4-5 times, and the food is getting worse day by day. There are very narrow range of foods with very bad taste and in desert also there are only ice cream and cheese cakes. In many days they give only one or two flavors of ice creams. Nowadays they are serving unlimited Pepsi at Rs.25 but the drinks are not at all cold and also it seems to me that they mix water in it which is really annoying to me, and also the waiters are not that much active. So if you want to taste Chinese buffet at a low cost and you can't decide between the two outlets of Haka in Kolkata I would suggest you the one at the City Center Mall, Sector 1. ¬†The outlet at City Center 1, Sector 1 is far better than this one. List of items in the buffet menu are better and the quality of food is also better.

My Personal Rating is as follow
Food Quality: 4/5
Service: 4/5
Ambience: 3/5
Location: 4/5
Value for money: 4/5

One of the valued Chinese buffet in Kolkata for me, just because it is pocket friendly. The quality of the food is average. No compromise with the ambience. Service is average. Food items are too limited in Buffet.   How can anyone miss to mention about 'Darsaan' and the 4types of ice-cream which just the value add to the restaurant. The location is perfect for the weekend to cherish.

A good chinese buffet. Price well. Ambience good. A good place to hangout with friends. But  I preferred the deserts more than the main course. Give a visit. Haka kakurgachi not Cc 1 .

I have visited this place 2 times and both times I've had similar experiences.
Among the starters chicken wonton, chicken lollipop was quite good, the chicken sweet corn soup was ok but the veg momo was a disaster. You'd get better momo in any other restaurant.
The main course was decent enough though the fried rice was not properly cooked.
Desserts contained date wontons and 4 flavors of ice cream which were quite good. 
Overall I'd say that if you're looking for a buffet @400 then Haka is the best place.

Haka serves good quality authentic Chinese food. Buffet dinner at a very subtle rate was what we wanted. The dinner was light and thus enjoyable. Warm sweet corn and manchow soup with crispy babycorn, chicken chilly wings and domains gave a good start. Along with rice and noodles, chicken hoi tsung and fish in pepper and mustard sauce were awesome. If u want to enjoy a good light dinner, just head towards it!

went to this place on sunday(29.03.15) .Since it was sunday the place was full but we didnt have to wait much ¬†.Well if you like Chinese and like to eat like me this is the place to dig in.Plenty of items in the menu served hot . The staff is very friendly and the food is very tasty too . Loved their dimsums , drums of heaven ,shrimps ..all were super tasty ..and mainy all were hot ..not like places they keep the things and they become cold and they dont refill ..The dessert was a bit letdown not much to choose from .. 3-4 types of ice cream ,darsaan ,Orange mousse..They could add some more varieties would be my suggestion .. Anyways had a fun sunday and happy tummy :)

note : If youre paying by ICICI card then you get some choices of drinks free :)

Okay,so we were a group of 4 people after a movie ended up at Haka for lunch... It is located at Mani Square Mall,top floor.. THE CHEAPEST yet THE BEST chinese buffet at only Rs 371(including taxes).. And if u add jus Rs 25 u will get unlimited cold drinks.. ? So,coming to the food-starters were good,but what i liked the most is Basa Fish In Mustard Sauce,it will make u feel heavenly.. My bf dont like anything with mustard sauce,he too felt heavenly so i need not say more.. ?  coming to desserts- i cudnt stop myself having marble cake wid chocolate sauce(i think i had somewhat 25-30cakes) one staff member ARJUN (we managed to know his name) was so helpful and really made us feel different,he was so cute... Thanx ?  we love you..... Will visit again soon... ?

The buffet is really very cheap here. It is a good place for a family meal or a very cozy meal. The lights are totally apt. They make really good dumplings. i also liked the hakka noodles. howevr, one thing that i spotted was that the variety was not there at all. The buffet gives very less options.

The most "pocket-friendly yet good food" buffet in kolkata.. located in the top most floor of mani square this place has quite beautiful ambience with lots of reds and blacks.. coming to the buffet menu, all the items specially the starters and desserts were quite good, though nothing extraordinary.. the soup needs a special mention.. it was light yet tasty.. the momos and chicken drumsticks were superb.. well,  though the variety of food items were limited but the taste of each n every item was awesome.. and yes, one more impressive thing was the darshan and the tuty fruity icecream combo with chocolate sauce in the dessert section.. nice place to dine out with your friends group and enjoy some really good Chinese dishes at amazingly affordable prices.

I visited 2 days ago on a weekday buffet lunch. Ambience is average. Service not so good. The starters were not so fancy, main course was comparatively better. 4 type of ice cream was available in desert which was lovely. The fried rice and momo tasted very bad, any street side stall can make those items better. Every non veg item was based on chicken, one or two would have been better. 
There are a lot more buffets in kolkata better than this, but comparing the price and the quality haka is good. One can't ask for anything more than this at rs 371.

Valuable place in Kolkata for buffet. Ambience is good, welcoming staff, food is tasty. I love chinese so had a visit here. It was worth visiting. I m a vegetarian, there was less item in veg, but still the management provided extra food items for me. If you are looking for long lavish lunch, these is a must try.

My friends and I are great food lovers. We have been to a lot of resturants but we always come back to this place. It is the most economical buffet with wide variety of chinese flavours. Fish , chicken , veg & yummy deserts. Great ambience, polite service but little space around the service table.
Over all it was a beautiful experiance, unlimited food & awsom quality which always pulls me towards it.

'THE' most value for money place in Kolkata.¬†
Buffet is for 371 bucks only (the weekday lunch buffet) and if you add 25 more, you get unlimited cold drinks too. And this is inclusive of taxes.¬†The choices, though nothing flashy or exotic, are all good and has enough variations to keep you interested. Especially if you look at the price, the respect for what the place provides grows. I mean for 371, we barely get a couple of naan and a chicken dish these days and their buffet has so much stuff.¬†
The interiors and seating arrangements are ¬†decent. The staff is courteous.
¬†This is what you get :¬†
Starters¬†
1. Pickled cucumbers and carrots¬†2. Salad¬†3. Chicken dimsums¬†4. Spinach pakoras¬†5. Crispy veggies¬†Also there were various other fries and sauces.
¬†2 types of soup : chicken and veg
¬†Main Course
¬†1. Veg chow¬†2. Chicken chow¬†3. Veg Fried Rice¬†4. Egg Fried Rice¬†5. Hunan Chicken¬†6. Schezwan Chicken¬†7. Some fish dish which tasted the best¬†8. Fried vegetables¬†9. Chilly cauliflower
¬†Desserts
¬†1. Strawberry mousse¬†2. 4 types of ice cream with hot chocolate sauce¬†
None of the dishes were bad or tasted bland. It was all good food, cheap food, satisfying food.¬†All they need to do is keep the prices as it is.

I went with my friends.. This is my fourth visit but my friends visited this place for the first time as i requested them to enjoy the buffet lunch and i must say hakka just stood by the expectation. The food was really tasted and awesome..This time the chicken basil soup had a different taste and made the mouth watery and slippery.. The picked salad had a different sweet taste which all of us liked..chicken wonton the most exciting item which made us run towards the buffet stand more than two times.. Crunchy butter flavour with chicken stuff wonton.. Chicken hakka noodles and fried rice with different sauces was equally good.. Chicken drumstick could be better if salt added was little less. Fried rice was light and it is good for the people who are health conscious. Not at all oily but the taste was very good. chicken curry and fish curry made our tongue twist and dance a little and we licked the food enjoying every chicken pieces and fish.. Now coming to the dessert.. Hot chocolate syrup and brownie a heavenly feeling.. The daarsan was sweet. The brownie was soft and after the heavy lunch made our mouth sweeter. The ice cream different flavours with hot chocolate was equally good.. The ambience and lovely romantic English songs made the environment to cherish and enjoy the food every bit.. Hospitality management was very good. The warm courtesy of the staffs is the most important thing and they gave priority to every visitors. Only one suggestion it can give is just add one more item in the dessert list (a different variety sweet)
For the food i will give 4 out of 5 and for ambience and hospitality 4.1..i
would like to visit this place again as it is very pocket friendly place for having a good buffet lunch..

Probably the cheapest buffet place in kolkata wid decent food. Though its many f ur favourite chinese..but I don't lyk Chinese food too much.still I visited dis place to give a change to my tastebuds.
Neways when I eneterd dis place WS almost full.
But I visited alone so they dint face any problem to give me a single seat.
The ambience was OK.I can use the word GOOD.
I took the lunch buffet spread.
They served me a soup, prawn papad a plate f chicken wanton nd drumstick in starter.I lyked d chicken drumstick..so I orederd one more plate..in between I ordered a cool Shanghai drink.which was ok.
Starter WS good.
Den moved to the main course...dere was some veg items...but I don't give it a look at them.directly went to the non veg section.
Dere were noodles,chicken fried rice,one chicken item and one fish item..the chicken was heavenly good.
After that I tried their dessert items.there were only 3items.actually I can't remember their names.those were good. 4flavoured ice creams were there also which iS good for icecream lovers.but I don't like ice creams personally so I din't try it.
Actually there were not many items.but if u go with the price den its very well managed.
The waiters were very well behaved.
Overall my experience was good.

After a movie me and Ak decided to have lunch at haka..located at the 4th floor of mani square mall..its a nice place to be in with family and friends..the decor was simple and i loved the chinese food they served..

We took the buffet spread ..in thr starters it included chicken soup,prawn papad,chicken lollipop,fried chicken wanton..one can have as much as one wants..in the main course their was veg and non veg items..chicken hakka noodles ,chicken and egg fried rice,hunan chicken,chilli chicken , garlic fish, and many more..each item was tasty..in the desserts there was darsan ,chocolate rolls and four flavours of ice cream..i guess its the cheapest buffet in town with such quality and variety of chinese food..i liked it..specially the starters and the quality of the main course has won my heart and the hot chocolate sauce in the desserts made the desserts yummmmyyyy..

Staff were efficient,ambience was nice and the chinese spread is awesome..and its pocket friendly one..will be visiting here again..

Been there on my friend's birthday...had lunch buffet. The food is good..liked the starters and noodles. The experience was not as good as I expected since I've heard so much about Haka..still I have to admit you can't get a good buffet within this price range. Approx Rs. 800 for two people..I think Haka deserves a Thumbs up. One of the best part is you can get unlimited cold drinks for just 25 bucks. I'll definitely go there and try something else!

Step in to Haka and let your wallet feel easy and your tummy feel full.
For the price you pay for the buffet,you have more dishes than you can gorge on.
Ambience is great and the taste is even better.
You have my vouch.

This place is worth trying but once in a while

I love Chinese cuisine and Haka is one of my favourite. This place never disappoints me...I love the food...ambience and service...If one decides to visit Haka, the buffet is a must try...

My most recent visit to Haka was this Saturday and opted for lunch buffet...I loved the starters...To begin with Chicken soup was decent...Spicy Chicken drumsticks,Fried chicken wanton and crispy cauliflower were my favourite...Veg dimsim was pretty good..

Coming to main course, I must say it was not as good as the starters but one item that stood out was fish..There was a bhetki preparation in white gravy..I dont remember the name but it was delicious...The Hot garlic shrimps was not spicy enough and Fried rice was bland..

Moving to my favourite section - Desserts...I loved the ice creams...Chocolate..Vanilla with hot chocolate sause..Mango and Tuti Fruity... There was bread pudding..Coconut wanton and darsaan too...

To sum it up Haka buffet is a must try for Chinese lovers..Nothing extra ordinary but the food is simple and delicious..

If your hungry and you dont have much money...Haka is the place.... :)
The buffet they have is pretty good, its dirt cheap considering the quality of the food and the decore...u can check the rates on their homepage..... ;) if you want to treat a large group of frnds and not effect your pocket, its the best  place to be.....folks with large apetite, its a win win situation.....
The 1st time i went there was back in dec 2013 for my b'day treat...and  after that yesterday i went for lunch....the quality of the food has improved alot...it tastes alot tastier now....
I did not try all the items though....the menu had soups, prawn chips, 2 varieties of starters for veg/N-veg each and 4 varieties of main course each for veg/N-Veg, 3 varieties of desserts....in the buffet menu they had chef's special chicken, it was ridiculously tasty and so was chicken dimsum (the one that looked like momos).... i had 10pcs each... :D
Then came to the main course...i had chicken haka noodles which was above average and chilly chicken which was also ok....so i wanted to get the good taste back so again i jumped into starter and 5pcs each again...boomm!! :D by that time i was full....but then u know, being a true calcuttan a meal is incomplete without a sweet dish.... :p
So i tasted one of the item called daarsaan, it was very crispy and lite warm too and coated with sugar syrup...it just tasted awesome....there was pudding too, tasted that and it was ok... tried ther ice cream as well, that was the only turn off in the whole course....the ice creams tasted like cough syrups i dont know why...but it literally did all 4 flaovours.....so i had to eat lil mor darsaan to relax my taste buds... :)
The waiters were well behaved and very polite...and Special mention for music...they had a good collection of classic rock....each and every song played while i was dining were my favourites :)
So its time to  rate this place...
Ambience: 3.5/5
Food: 4/5
Music: 4.5/5
Hospitality: 4.5/5
Will i go again to Haka? 
Yes, of course.. :)

Visited this place today with my sister. The decor is smart,the staff courteous and the service was prompt.we enrolled for the buffet where we were informed that for a 25/- extra,ee can get unlimited pepsi/7 up/fanta.This offer was so exciting and the  exchanged the glass with a filled one no sooner than it is empty.we enjoyed the starters chicken dumplings and drumstick with delicious munchies and potato chilli fries and a good variety of salads. The main course consisted mainly with fried rice and noodles,non greasy variety,one chicken and one fish side dish.the fish preparation w tasted different yet tongue tinkling.I never tasted Chinese cuisine with  mustard.it blended really well with the taste. 
Dessert was satisfying. darsan brownies and four flavours of ice cream,vanilla,chocolate,tuti froooti n  mango with chocolate sauce.
The best thing one experiences here is of course the price.it is pocket friendly at its best.we spent almost two hours with yummy food and beautiful ambience. We would love to come back soon with more friends.

The lunch buffet spread isn't that great. But the dinner buffet is pretty good. The best thing is that the prices are very convenient. I've been to haka countless number of times and have always enjoyed the food. Chicken dimsums and Thai green curry with vegetables are my personal favourites. Beverages are BAD. The service and ambience is pretty nice though.

Everytime i have been to this outlet of haka it was only for the buffet..since the salt lake outlet doesn't have buffet arrangements therefore my main attraction to this place remains their awesomely arranged buffet. To be frank,haka is the only place where they offer buffet at such noticeable low price but still doesn't lack in any part..be it the quality of food,the preparations,the heavenly taste or the vast choice of items..haka has always been the top among my charts. Where places like mainland china offer the same variety of preparations(only addition being the squid and double chocolate brownie) at such a high price,haka manages it all within such a low price. Well,my choice always remains the non-veg buffet..since am a pure non-vegetarian and everytime i am amused by the choices they offer. Though there aren't very many changes in their starters and main course portion but they keep on changing their dessert menu. Starting from their soups to their delicious wantons,chicken lollipops,salads,main dishes,desserts everything just sweeps my heart away. Ohh and the staff..they are so welcoming,courteous and well behaved..my mother once did not like one of their starter preparations,the manager immedietly called the chef and asked him to do over the preparation...he tossed it with some kind of sauce and wowww..what we got was an awesome delicious mouth watering dish. I am just in love with haka..i hope they keep on their good work and some changes in the buffet menu would be a cherry on the cake! Looking forward to more and more visits.:-)

I went there with group of my friends. We were searching for a nice place for buffet & we had. They provide variety of items in the veg as well as in the non-veg section. All the items were good. We tried the screw-driver (hard drink), but it was disaster. I prefer not to have cocktails over there but a friend of mine had a mock tail which was good. The price is reasonable.You can tryout this place on weekends with family & friends.

In one word awesuuuuume.¬†
We opted for buffet and as it was weekday so the joint was not over crowded. Team members were courteous including the shift manager. We had been offered a table in the middle of the restaurant and crew served the chicken clear soup along with the starters on the table. The sumptuous buffet was really short according variety but very yummy and honestly very affordable; only Rs-371 all inclusive.

Guys please give it a try if you are near by and very hungry.

Hii,
This is a poorman's Mainland China.I didn't become a fan of the decor,but the food was awesome and more appetizing as the prices were great.The decor is white and red,and as per review of another person,resembles KFC in some ways.I ate a lot in this buffet.
There was a lemon prawn preparation,which tasted out of the world,and cheese fritters,which was just as awesome.The other dishes did not disappoint either.
The desserts were tasty.
Ambience-3
Food-5
Service-4
Value for money-6 out of 5...:P

Verdict-A nice restaurant that will be easy on the pocket.

I visited Haka with my friends for lunch and I found it pretty good. We chose a ‚Çπ475/- buffet lunch. The food was yummy and has only intensified my love for Chinese cuisine. Moving to the ambience and service, a thumbs up for both. I'll surely look forward to visiting Haka again. Who else can satiate my love for Chinese food better than the best Chinese joint in town?

Haka is targeted at diners looking for an affordable yet filling Chinese buffet. I did not go with high expectations but I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. Today my colleagues decided to go out for a quick dinner and we landed up at Haka (Mani square). The buffet was priced very reasonably at Rs 475 (All inclusive)¬†

There were 2 soups (1 veg and 1 non veg), 2 Veg and 3 non veg appetizers. A couple of veg main course and 3 non veg main course items along with Fried rice and noodles.¬†

The soup and starters were served on the table along with some prawn chips, pickled cucumbers and some tangy kimchi. The soup tasted nice along with drums of heaven, fried chicken wanton and a Fish (Basa) appetizer. The fish appetizer was not upto the mark and did not have much filling. The wanton was average but the drumsticks were pretty good.¬†
Since there were not much veg options and most of the stuff was almost over, the waiter served us crispy chili baby corn which was indeed very tasty. There was one cauliflower appetizer as well which we liked. We were later served with crispy mixed veg preparation which was also good to taste.¬†

Next up was the main course which consisted of chicken, fish and shrimps. The chicken and shrimp preparation was really impressive. The shrimps were pretty big in size and can be compared to normal prawn sizes. I was very much happy with the main course. The noodles was average and so was the fried rice.¬†

Then came the desserts. There was darsaan, brownie slices, normal custard, caramel custard and 4 flavours of ice cream with chocolate sauce. I simply loved the desserts and could not help stuffing myself to the brim !¬†

Over all it was a great dining experience. I was really not expecting so many options at a budget buffet restaurant and thus I would strongly recommend this buffet if someone is not looking for something very fancy. The staff is polite and goes out of the way to please customers. We were served 2 out of the buffet dishes which is indeed appreciation worthy.¬†

A solid 4 for HAKA :)

Decent place if you don't want to spend much on buffet.
Ambience and service - Really good (They serve you the starters, the soup and don't spend much time on getting your bill.)
The chicken and prawn starters were really good. They also served fish chops (on new year's eve). When i turned towards the main course, i didn't feel like taking any (only noodles and fried rice). They should improve the main course and desserts section. Desserts had only icecream and cake (NO SWEETS). I feel the most attractive part of the buffet is the dessert (which i expected to be a lot better than i saw here). If you can spend a little more on buffet, there are loads of choices in south kolkata.¬†

NOTE- Go through the menu before entering!!

Got a chance to have the special new year buffet at rs 464. It was simply great. The starters and main course were excellent. Fish in parsley sauce and shrimp in white sauce were my personal favourites. The Hong Kong chicken was not like the conventional one, but it tasted great.  The food was so cooked that you do develop saturation even after eating a huge amount. So its a good place to try out if you have a good appetite. The deserts were excellent. There were 4 flavours of ice cream, chocolate brownie, moose and caramel cakes. The service was good and the staff were cooperative. To sum up I must say it was a great experience and worth a try.

Chinese buffet, at such low price and so many of items was a good decision made by my foodie partner. The ambiance is cozy and comfy. No need to ¬†worry if you get busy talking and forget to eat (as in my case), they will take care of that, and will serve you on your table. As my mom rightly says I'm born carnivorous, I never try any veg items but since they served me the corn cubes and chilly potato, were shockingly good.
The prawn and chicken items were of good kind, however the best part was the desert. All of them are too good, specially the crispy Darsaan and chocolate brownie. I couldn't wait for them, hence served on my own.
Overall good experience.

Back in 2008, they launched their Chinese buffet @149! Good times continue, though at a tad higher pocket pinch - this Haka joint is known for its buffet, so much so that they refuse to serve a la carte in the evenings which is a little disappointing. However the buffet makes up for it - a great place for family get together- there is something for everyone - decent soups and curries, light-weight tasty noodles and fried rice, awesome dumplings, and pretty nice darsaan and brownie for dessert. This place will offer great value for money. 
There is a wine list, and some cool mocktails too! They do serve good starters if you ask for it, to go with the drinks (recommended for people who do not want to eat at the buffet). 
Ambience is comfortable and service very cordial. Take your loved ones here, especially if you have a group of more than 5.

Visited Haka with a few friends, I enjoyed the ambience . I ate alacarte and thought the food was good especially the crab fried rice and devils chicken ..its a dry dish with a lot of chillies and very spicy ..Well I love spicy food so it was very apt for me. I can still savour the taste of that amazing food. You could also try some of the desserts they are very good.

Been yesterday for buffet dinner and found good ambience and staff. The starters were as usual chicken sweetcorn soup, prawn chips and dumplings. However a bit dissapointed with the main course as the ingredients were cheap. However cannot complain as the price is damn cheap...u cannot get such spread with this price anywhere in the world. The service was cordial and good.

Awesome dumplings... !!!
Da Buffet spread comprises of
1. Chkn Sweetcorn Soup- Perfect blend of chicken sweet corn soup. 
2. Hot n Sour soup- Didnt try.
3. Awesome steamed Chicken Dumpling- Awesome perfect succulent juicy pieces of steamed chicken momos... The best of the lot... Simply wow... I cant recollect how many I had before I tried the next item. This should be treated as their signature dish.
4. Chicken Lollypop(ornamentally coined in some other name)- Nicely cooked Chicken Lollypop with dash of some Chinese sauce.
5. Egg Fried Rice- Very light with rare piece of fried eggs which goes a perfect combination with over spicy Devils Chicken.
6. Chicken Chowmein- Light fried rice with sparing pieces of Chicken in it. Another perfect compliment for the Devils Chicken
7. Devil's Chicken- Chicken cooked in red gravy full of dried red chillies. It isnt that hot but over spicy.
8. Fish Gravy- Well cooked fish dipped kn modestly tasting gravy. Deserved a repeat helping.
9. Darshan- Good and tasty
10. Chocolate Browney- Best of the lot in dessert section.
11. Ice cream- Local brand ice cream served.

(I dint speak of the Vegetarian spread as I was least inrerested in Vegeterian Chinese and never tasted it)

Overall well spread buffet with some strikingly good items- Chkn Sweetcorn Soup, Chicken Dumplings, Fish n Chocolate Browney deserves a second mention. 

Food-3.5/5
Value for money- 4/5
Ambience n service-4/5

Hence recommended... !!!

A great chinese buffet at an affordable price ! We had a chinese dinner @ Rs 409/-. The ambience is good and they do serve the food quickly. The starters included Prawn chips and Chicken Sweet Corn Soup,Chicken Wontons and Fried Chicken Wings. ¬†But, i am really disappointed with the quality of fried rice and the mixed meat chowmin. They tasted like ordinary street food. The Fish Garlic was too good. And, the best part was the deserts. Darshan, Puddings and the Icecreams were delicious. Overall, a rating of 3.5/5.0.

Haka, being a Superspeciality restaurant, lives up to its group in terms of quality. Although not meant for as fine dining experience as the likes of Mainland China, but it serves pretty good oriental food with fair enough ambience in case you are on a budget. 
Buffets are what to opt for. Being a regular at the Mani Square outlet and having dined there at lunch and at dinner on all 7 days a week, I'll suggest that you visit the place during weekends (lunch or dinner) and enjoy the food without burning a hole in your pocket.

The top two reasons I come here : 
1. It's an affordable buffet.
2. It is Chinese. 

There is also a third reason and that is, despite it's economic pricing per person, the quality is never compromised. 
I've been here for all of four times and every experience has been worth it. 

I'll tell you a little bit about my last visit there. 
We had the Lunch Buffet. 
Starters : 
Prawn chips and Chicken Sweet Corn Soup. 
Chicken Wontons. 
Fried Chicken Wings. 

Main Course :
Egg Rice. 
Chicken Hakka Noodles. 
Hunan Chicken.
Lemon Fish. 

Dessert : 
Darsaan. 
A mousse. 
Ice cream. 

And at 25/- per person, one can get unlimited pepsi. 

Although the choices are limited but at 370/- per person, it's a catch.

Haka located in Mani square is famous for its reasonable buffet spread. The ambience is quite good but sometimes looks like a Vodaphone store due to its white and red theme. The buffet spread used to be very good. The soups and starters were done quite well. The main course was simple yet tasty and the dessert of Darsaan with vanilla icecream always stole the show. Service was good enough and Prices were just right. This is one of the cheapest buffet in Kolkata and this outlet offers better food than their counterpart in City centre.

Last Thursday was my first time visit to Haka, and jolly was the food really good there. The ambiance was subtle and the staff had a very friendly behavior. ¬†The buffet menu was really appreciable. Although I would way that you could include a few other items in the starter section. The menu selection was good, but it was more chicken than anything else. Fish could have been introduced in the menu, in a more courageous manner. It might be such that I am expecting way too much from the cheapest buffet in town (as understood from Reviews of Zomato, I will try others and change my statement accordingly)... I will visit the place again with even more hunger...

Haka Mani Square is much better than its counterpart at the other mall in Salt Lake region. I maybe wrong but that is what i felt after visiting both the places couple of times. I have tasted both the buffet and ala carte here. I liked the buffet here which comes with a lot of variety at a very reasonable rate. It is perfect if you want to throw a small party for friends and family. It will satisfy your guests with the service, food and ambiance and will not be too dear for your pockets as well. My favourite are the prawn wafers available here and also the drumsticks and the thai fish menu.

Its one of my favourite places for Sunday Brunches. The most important feature of this restaurant is its reasonable price. The quality of food is good. The ambiance can be better but its satisfactory. The starters are good especially the chicken wantons, momos, baby corn and the soup. In the main course the chicken dishes tastes better than the rest. The dessert section is fairly good. The brownie with the chocolate sauce is nice but it can add variety to the dessert section. Overall the quality and taste of the food is good.
Taking a view on the management and staffs, they does their job quite well. The manager is quite courteous and ask for feedback each time I visit the place, the other staffs are attentive and knowledgeable as they can answer any quires without any hesitation.
The restaurant is big but its too crowded mostly on weekends and you have to wait for a while to get a seat.
The place is quite easy to find as its located in the top floor of Manisquare mall. So u wont have any difficulty in locating the place.
So if u want a nice Chinese buffet without thinking much about ambience and spending much bucks this is the apt place to visit.

A 3.5 is what I will give to this place.@

I don't remember how many times exactly I have been here with friends & family!!!!! may be 10 times..i doubt any buffet in the city can be so light on your pocket and equally wholesome for your tummy..this completely befits the ideology of treating while saving! :P But you tend to get too tired of the menu once you start visiting the place too often..the buffet menu needs to go for a revamp from time-to-time..!!

Haka is probably one of those places in Kolkata that provides the cheapest buffet!The ambiance is good,and the service is fast.For only 350 bucks you can have starters,mains and desserts!The food was good!The Mai sui and the fried rice were great and there was enough variety in the food.However all the non-vegetarian items were mostly chicken!So if you are a non-vegetarian who does not like chicken (Trust me there are some :P) give this place a miss!
Happy 'Haka'ing!

This place is amazing. One of the few places in Kolkata still serving standard buffet at reasonable prices. I've been here loads of times, with family, with friends, with a small group and with a group of 20-something people. They accomodate everyone with a smile. Their buffet menu, especially the weekend menu has an astounding number of items, with each one tasting better than the other. They usually have two soups, a whole lot of starters, salads and prawn crackers to begin with. Their drumsticks in a spicy, garlic-flavoured sauce and tiny steamed chicken dumplings are my absolute favourites. Sometimes I pile my plate high with these tiny dumplings and the delicious accompanying sauce and have gobbling competitions with my cousins. :P They have quite a lot of variety for vegetarians, with a completely separate main course section for them. The non-vegetarian section on weekends, is stuffed to bursting with chicken, prawn, fish all cooked till soft and juicy, in various sauces that are simultaneously light and creamy and smooth and robust. Flavour is never compromised, and their sauces taste great no matter what name it has. The main carbs, i.e. rice and noodles are also light and non-greasy with plenty of vegetables and chicken. The deserts section is overflowing. Darsaan, brownies, petit fours, custard, fruit, chocolate sauce, ice-cream and so much more. It varies each time I've been, but has never failed to excite me.

The food containers are refilled as soon as they empty with hot, amazing food of wonderful quality. Eat all you want. A 4.5 only because my vegetarian friend was a bit disappointed with the vegetarian starters.

The food was great and it is always better to opt for buffet.

But I think it's the cheapest buffet available in Kolkata. So a good place if you wanna throw a party (you would save lots of cash ;) )

The price is no doubt very less for the wide variety of food on offer.
The dimsum was good as always. The wanton was not that good. The main course was pretty average.
In the desert section, i liked the brownie, the kiwi pastry was too sweet for my taste.
Overall an average experience.

Haka, whenever we hear the word our mouth starts watering. It has became a phenomenal behaviour of our physical structure or perhaps i should say mental. Well i have been at that place for a couple of times with a special one to have a special time. But the last visit was a bit disappointing. We had opted for the buffet. As we were very hungry, we engulfed a large amount of chicken drumsticks. But as we kept on proceeding on our food line the more upset we were getting. Just the drumsticks & chicken wantons were good & tasted differently. And it ought to be happen because those 2 belonged to different food genre. But rest of of food tastes like the same. I mean whatever it might be chicken or prawn or fish all taste more less same. There were no differences i sensed. The worst part was the soup. Haven't thought that a restaurant with this stature could possibly make this kind of shit soup. Well the only thing we really liked about the place is the hospitality. I have to really accept that they took real care of that part. But i think if somebody wants to run owns restaurant oneself must give priority to the the fundamental things and that is obviously the quality of the good. I intend to give rating 3 but added the .5 because of there hospitality, couldn't give more than that. Well i have expressed my feelings exasperatingly but perceptions matters. :)

Was my very first time. Food quality is excellent. The best part was when i told them i cannot have the regular soup as it has carrots which i'm allergic to, they brought me a fresh chicken soup with mushrooms and veggies. Starters are nice specially the momos, drumsticks are good too. Try the sweetened chilled cucumber salad. It tastes heavenly. Chicken chilli and fish chicken are also nice. Another good point are the desaserts served here. Ice creams with chocp sauce vanilla and mango scoops. Now you must be wandering about your pocket? Well all for 763 for two of us. Total value for money. Reception is very well. So, don't forget to leave a generous tip.

Firstly I'd like to say that I'm coming back really soon, hence I've already proved that I've liked everything about this place be it the food or the ambience. The dumplings simply melt in your mouth and Fish in the hot garlic sauce was delicious. What I'd really like to mention is, the attendants are the most attentive ones I've come across in a while. Sweet corn soup was on the buffet and my friend is allergic to corn. So, I casually mentioned that once and he had arranged for Clear chicken soup without even being officially asked. Now I really regret not having asked his name. I definitely will the next time I visit!

Only two things I would like to tell about this place 1. Pocket friendly 2. Nice ambience.. They offer a range of chinese food at just rs. 352 on weekdays.. This is quite alluring to have a good time with chinese food... The quality of food is satisfactory... Ok you cant expect a heavenly taste at this budget and moreover you are having a buffet there!! Service was really good and the stuffs were well behaved... There were soup,momos,chicken drumstick,two types of fried rice and noodles, mixed vegetables,fish,chicken,sweetdish,mousse,ice cream.. Overall a good place with good variety of foods.. I loved this place n wish to visit again.

Watch out buffet joints cause Haka has improved rapidly in terms of quality of food.Great price to quality ratio. Soup, salads,two starters(both veg and non-veg),two cereals,two proteins and two types of sweet dishes and two flavours of ice cream all for 350 only(inclusive of tax!).On weekends there is one more type of protein on offer(450 inclusive of tax).                             * I would recommend non vegetarians to definately try out Haka.Sadly,its a loss if you're a vegetarian.

Visited this place on 1st October, 2014. It was a lunch-buffet costing 600/- per head for the Durga-Pujo season, otherwise the normal buffet price is around 400/- per head max. throughout the year.
The quality of the food was superb. There were around 20 dishes total (Veg+Non veg). The ambience was superb. The waiters are v.helpful and attending. The food is hot and freshly prepared. It was pretty crowded with long queue...thanks to the good food @ cheap price. A must-visit for the foodies out there.

1) STARTERS:
chicken & veg soup
prawn papad
kimchi (raw cabbage & pickle salad- quite refreshing)
different types of salads
burnt garlic corn veg fried rice
coriander chowmein
baby corn stir-fry
potato chips stir-fry
cauliflower curry, etc.

2) MAIN:
mixed fried rice
chicken dimsum ("momo"- very good & tasty)
chicken drumsticks
chilli fish
fish in garlic white sauce
hot chilli prawn
more noodles, etc.

3) DESSERT:
sweet sticky fried papad-type something
mango/orange mousse
pudding
3 types ice-cream (vanilla, mango, chocolate) served with chocolate sauce.

Haka...i have been there for 2 or 3times...but the reason was the so pocket friendly buffet over there...its so cheap that it can even beat the roadside restaurants...ambience is pretty good and reception is average...now come to the most imp part...I didn't like the food at all...all the dishes are so tasteless that you can not even thinking of consuming more n more...but you can have it plenty cause it's a buffet so whenever you have a budget crunch and you want to throw a party for your not so good friends its the perfect choice...

I don't think a review would be needed for a place this popular.
Coming to the point, this restaurant is v.famous now for its highly pocket friendly buffet spread. The food here is no doubt really v.good in taste as well as in quality. The place is more than worth a visit. Moreover it has become a regular place for me to go when I'm on a tight budget and am around Salt Lake area.
Ambience wise it's really decent too.
However one thing i would like to point out is that their menu is more or less fixed and doesn't change much. You would get the same Drums of Heaven and Wantons/Dumplings for starters every other day. A little bit change in variety would really be welcome. A buffet Spread ideally has:
1. Drums of Heaven,
2. Wantons/Dumplings
3. Manchow soup
4. Haka Noodles
5. Fried Rice (which taste n feel more like pulao)
6. Coriander/Chilly Chicken
7. Mustard Fish
8. Darsaan
9. Brownies
10. 3 flavors of Ice Cream (Choc, mango, vanila)
Yes this spread is mostly unchanged...

Looking for a good oriental buffet at relatively lower price? This is definitely a place worth trying... The buffet spread is wide with good selections of veg and non-veg dishes including salads and soups...specially the dimsums, wontons, fish in mustard sauce, worth mentioning. Generally I avoid the haka noodles and fried rice (sort of OK tasting) as I fill myself up with the other dishes...lastly they offer a good range of desserts as well including brownies, darsaan, mousse, three flavors of ice creams... Overall it never disappoints...the interior is soothing and makes the place a good one for a dine out...would be great if they update the menu periodically....

Appetisers (which include chicken drumsticks,  soups, chicken wontons, etc.), A1. Main course, comprising of noodles and fried rice,  superb... Finally, desserts... They wouldn't too let you down...  There's mousse, and that's awesome...  Ambience, is excellent... Laugh, gossip, chatter,  make merry and eat... All to your heart's content... Nice job, Haka!!!

I took my lunch break many times at this restaurant whenever I felt like having Chinese food.
Their lunch buffets are composed of some great platters though I hated the CHICKENS which felt terrible in the mouth.
The starters are yummy except the CHICKEN.
Dim sums are crispy.
Soup is warm and tasty.
Momo is properly steamed.
Rice comes with egg bhurji.
Noodles are great.
Fish tastes nice too.
DARSHAN is amazing.
try having it with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream, topped with chocolate sauce.
Custard is done in a fine way.

The staffs are friendly.
The ambience is cosy and easy to settled. I love their high ceiling settings which brings a feel of the land related to the cuisine.
The cost is apt for regulars like me and goes with the food they serves.

Haka happened...without any real plans to eat out. Had visited mani square mall for some work and as i was strolling through each floor came across this, machan and flame grill. With a lot of deliberation with my friend finally we zeroed in on this. At the entrance.. i saw the price as 370 fr weekend buffet and at another place 442. I was confused and after a lil enquiry found that the diff was the service tax. So we entered and as expected the place was swarming with ppl. The spread they offer at the price was impressive. The high point of the meal was the non veg items... shrimps fish and chicken all served with good preparation. I was disappointed with veg menu which was limited in variety not that i care..coz i am a hardcore non veg..but my friend accompanying is a vEg... what was even more disappointing was they served the paneer item when u order them (this was a part of the buffet spread). We informed the manager immediately and he took a note of it to mention to the customers.
The overall taste of the food was good enuf to nullify the disappointment and wen u get a 2 free mocktails jus because u are paying in icici debit card..who could complain ! All in all a satisfying exp at a very reasonable price. A one time visit i would say ....not more than that

The varieties are wide if you are up with Buffet ..
starting from the 1. chicken soup 2. Kimchi 3.steamed momos 4. veg. fried rice 5. non-veg fried rice 6. veg cm non veg noodles. 7. chicken drumsticks 8. potato crisper 9. chilly chicken ...till the desrt viz. 10. darshan 11. mango and strawberry moose 12 vanilla cm chocolate scoops. was pleasingly really tasty..¬†
I must add- the quality of the ice creams were classy (which I had was chocolate ice cream) and the chow-mien was way too awesome.. !!
the service was umm.. well.. it would seriously poke your sense of humour to tip them more..!! They are the kindest !!

Fill your ravenous tummy as much as you wish without a pinch in your pocket..!!!
Yes, you heard it right. With the buffet coming at only 388 bucks (including tax) and along-with a glass of lemon soda(ordered separately), one is left with no alternative but to literally "fleece" the place of the items they offer.
Factually speaking, there were a variety of dishes to pick from (but not limited to):
(1) Veg Soup
(2) Veg Chilly Baby Corn
(3) Kimchi
(4) Steamed Chicken Momo
(5) Hunan Chicken
(6) Veg Fried Rice
(7) Veg Hakka Chowmein
(8) Egg Fried Rice
(9) Chilly Chciken
(10) Chilly Fish
(11) Ice-Cream (3 different flavours)
The Veg Fried Rice and the Egg Fried Rice appeared to be different only in that the Veg Fried Rice had corns as one of its ingredients (amongst others) in lieu of scrambled eggs.¬†
The Hunan Chicken was crispy and tasted delicious when savoured with unconventionally concocted tomato chilly sauce. Steamed Chicken Momo along-with Veg Soup helped in replenishing the empty belly right at the start.¬†
Veg Chilly Baby Corn wasn't that much chilly, but it tasted soft. Chilly Chicken and Chilly Fish when consumed with Fried Rices and Chowmein adds the necessary flavor to the latter combo.¬†
The Lemon Soda, sipped in between, shall tickle your gustatory senses to crave for more.
The scoops of 3 different flavors of Ice-Creams, with some chocolate sauce spread over them, towards the end served as the fitting dessert.This one is a self-service place, but the staffs showed promptitude in clearing the discarded plates off the table.¬†
The ambiance was good; the place was brightly illuminated; the paintings on the walls were soothing to the eyes; the 24" television-set added yet another feather to its decor.
Overall, a within-the-budget place to stop by, especially when you are celebrating the birthdays of four of your buddies. :)

The cheaper version of Speciality Group's Chinese restaurants can not boast of variety but can definitely take pride for the quality of the food. The Buffet they offer can come up as a pleasant surprise for its pricing. ¬†The Mani Square Haka is the one that I visited. Ample seating space with a quirky Interior ¬†proves that, it may lack the Grandeur but it has its heart at the right place.¬†
The items from their buffet offering that deserve special mention here ¬†are Dimsums, Tai pei chicken, Vegetable Traingles, Fish in mustard sauce, even the chicken munchow soup they serve is delicious. The not so good list would include the fried rice, the haka noodles, chilli chicken. The desserts they offer is nice, specially the darsham and custard. Brownies and ice cream with 2-3 flavors to choose, bring smile to the ice cream lovers.¬†
Overall, if you can afford to give grandiose a miss and variety a temporary good bye, this place is suitable for you. At least after a sumptuous buffet experience, your pocket will still not lose much weight while you will gain some :)

The buffet at Haka is quite satisfying. The menu consists of multiple 
Starters like soups, babycorn, wanton etc.
Maincourse like rice, noodles, 2 types of chicken dish,shrimps and a fish item
.
Desserts like cakes and ice cream. 

When coming to the quality of food, it will be enough to dissolve your hunger at a reasonable price. It lacks a Chinese feeling but Chinese at Kolkata is somewhat the same here as compared with other restaurants.

Overall a quite satisfying ambience and good to be in but could have been better with the quality of food and items. A try once is deserving.

Coming to the main thing food it was good
The buffet contained
3- starters
2-main course
4-side dish (1veg item)
3-desserts
Starters were average bt the main course and side dishes compensated it... the dessert was yummmy :-D
Overall a good place to dine and hangout
Most importantly its pocket friendly and probably cheapest among all buffet restaurants..

To tell about the place it serves a Chinese cuisine........Thedecor is chinese too and anyone can tell just by looking at it......The ambiance is pretty awesome too as it holds mostly lots of people still carries a silence.... The staff is pretty helpful.....

Now talking about the food, its brilliant every time......In buffet it serves soup(veg & non veg), some starters, veg items(mostly dry), One or two chicken items, and on the weekend prawn also.....In the desert there is ice-cream with flavors.....(Every item Chinese though).......

As it is a pocket friendly place and a great place for those who love Chinese......So in my opinion everyone should try it...

The cons being the service aint very prompt and someone needs to inform the customers what is charged and whats not charged in lunch buffet.

Friday night and no good food sounds like an incomplete end to the weekdays. I went on a dinner date with my husband to celebrate the end of a long week. We had tried to get reservation earlier last month on a Saturday but the place was too crowded and there was a long waiting. That's why this time we went on a Friday and were happy to see no waiting.
Haka did not disappoint us at all. We ordered crab meat and shrimp soup which was a little spicy when hot but when it cooled down a bit, it tasted amazing. Spicy mushroom dumplings weren't a disappointment either. We love sea food and thus without a second thought, ordered the crabmeat fried rice and braised fish in sweet basil sauce. We did not regret ordering so much of sea food. It all tasted delicious.
The service was quite prompt which made us happier.
Will definitely go back to Haka soon.

it was way back last year that i had visited this particular outlet¬†
Guess what i fell in love with the ambience and the buffet system(specially)because ¬†its pocket friendly and also the eat as much as you can tag line make it even more hungry¬†
Starting with ambience well its neat and clean and spacious but i hated the table arrangement as few people were eating beside might jump upon your seat while eating¬†

secondly the food good... its basically a having simple chinese recipes which changes at every alternate days

The chicken dimsums are a must to try out its definetely a mouth watering item in there buffet system
and do not forget the desert at the end of the meal¬†
they are just faboulous!!¬†
overall the this restaurant is a pocket friendly one for those who are looking for nothing extra but good time spending with food this is good place lay your mouth on ........

A date with old friends and no food? Its not in my dictionary!! So this time we opted for some Chinese experience!! Must say Haka did not disappointed us at all !! Though it did not provide much option for starters, we started with soups and salads which were nice. Momos and other items were ordinary. Moving on to the main course, loved the mixed noodles n fried rice. The chicken dishes tasted nice but the shrimps were awesome. In dessert section also darshan was yummy. Brownies were just mind blowing. Ice creams with the chocolate syrup n different flavours also nice.
No complain about the service, decor is also good. Its really a delicious experience with much smaller hole in your pocket!! ;)

Hakka is the one of most pocket friendly buffet provider out there at Kolkata. Went there with my friends for hang out and we had noticed that everyone there are also came for the buffet i did not noticed anyone who order anything rather than the buffet. It cost us 352 with all taxes. I don't remember what exactly we had so I uploaded a Picture of the Menu. I did not like The Chicken Hot and Sour soup except that everything was OK.

A nice place to have Indo Chinese. This place is the budget version of Mainland China, coming from the same Specialty Restaurants Group. Both the buffet and a la carte give bang for your buck! Go for it!

I've been planning to visit this place for a long time and so I finally I managed to visit today with a group of 5.People mostly come here for the cheap buffet menu,I was no exception.All the reviews here are mixed.Some says it's good and some says it's not upto the mark.This is what i think:

##Firstly let me mention the items.It was a mixed buffet and I don't remember all the names of the items.

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Soups:

Chicken Clear Soup

Spicy Tomato Soup

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†Salads:

Cabbage Leaves mixed with red sause

Cucumbers/Carrots dipped in Vinegar

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†Starters:

Haka Chilli Potatos

Chicken Fied Wontons

Cruncy Spinach

Steamed Chicken Momo

¬† ¬† ¬† Sauce:

Plain Tomato Sauce

Some sort of Chiili Sause for the Momo 

¬† ¬† ¬† Main Course:

Egg Hakka Noodles

Schezwan Fied Rice

Chicken Fried Rice

¬† ¬† ¬†Side Dish:

General Tao's Favorite Chicken(Gravy)

Some Fish Gravy (not a fish lover,but it was good)

Potato and Corn Curry

Mixed Vegetable Curry

¬† ¬† ¬†Desset:

Darsan

Icecream ( Mango and Vanilla ) 

Brownie 

Chocolate Sauce & Strawberry Sauce



Now about the items:

All were very good except the main couse.The main course is not at all good like the other items.After having all those delicious starters,I just couldn't have the main couse.It tasted so sub-standard,all three of them.But it's somewhat acceptable since there are so many items they are providing at such a low price but if they some how manage to improve this i would give it a 4.Another thing the is items did not stay hot except for the soup.If they fix this,certainly a 4.5.And I loved the ambience,they had Sony Six on the whole time and I enjoyed my food watching TNA ( Yes,I'm a wresting fanatic).



Pocket Pinch:

I am that kind of foddie who wants the best but would not pay too much.I hope many can relate with me,if so,then this is place where you wanna be.Rs 352/- incl all taxes for the weekday lunch buffet.Sat-Sun Buffet and Dinner Buffet prices are different and a tad bit costly.Alchol is priced seperately. 



I hope it helped those who all are planning to visit. :)

Haka is always my personal favorite. I have always liked their buffet spread. Especially the kimchi salad, the soup and choicest of non-veg main course. I would like to suggest Haka to anybody who would wish to try some good chinese food at cost not big on pockets.

I would however rate it 3.5 because of an experience I had recently. We were 16 people, went here for a buffet dinner. While a few had finished their's the others were going through the desserts and last course. It was a sunday and naturally very crowded. The manager came to us and requested the ones who have finished to go and stand outside. And we were like - WHAT? Stand outside just because you have finished. So from hospitality view, I will give 0.

Went there on Christmas morning. The buffet spread is excellent. Loved the soup. The starters and main course were good too. Though felt that the dessrets could have been better. One thing this place definitely lacks is a bigger area. When you go to the buffet table, it gets a bit crowded. But overall that shouldnt dtere you from going to have a meal there. Definitely a amust visit..

One of the cheapest chinese buffet in Kolkata you can get here. At last visited this place after viewing so many reviews. Went there with friends. Food was good. The most disappointing thing was that there were only a few non veg dishes!! Maximum dishes were veg. I like the veg noodle though. I wish there were more non veg items. The darsaan was good. Don't go for the chocolate syrup like me. It tasted yuck! Like any medicine. I was fooled by that being a chocolate lover. Overall it was okay. Not too much satisfied.

Had buffet lunch this saturday...soup was the only item which was hot...food quality overall average...nothing special to mention...2 types of soups, stuffed potatoes & chicken drumsticks were there for starters...in main course there was noodles, fried rice, a chicken preparation, a fish item & a shrimp item...all cold & tasted awkward...the drumsticks should be more crispy...all the gravies were much diluted...in the desserts section there was darsaan(it tastes great), pastry, carrot cake & 3 types of ice-creams, of which I liked the mango flavour the most...the price we need to pay was Rs.442 per person...now coming to the ambience, the place is a bit chaotic...the service is prompt...here you will find the excellent behaviour of the staffs as well as a humble & friendly manager who goes around each & every table asking you if the food are okay or not, and solving every problems, thus successfully managing this restaurant...you can rarely find such a well mannered well behaved friendly manager & team of staffs...

Very conveniently located in Mani Square, Haka was my first choice as a birthday dinner place.First impressions,the place is very clean though the tables were worn out.The food variety presented in the buffet is exhaustive,quite literally!¬†The spread caters to both vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike.There is enough for both.There was a choice between veg and non-veg soups.The veg tom yum and the chicken coriander.I opted for the latter.It was seasoned to perfection.Alongside we had prawn chips which complimented it quite beautifully,Next there were braised veggies,kimchi and a couple other salads.The veggies were thoroughly appetising.I wasnt too impressed with the kimchi but my friends seemed to like it.Next there was veg dimsums,roasted potatoes,fried wonton wrappers,crispy veggies,noodles,rice and various types of chicken.I couldnt possibly taste each of them but a special mention goes to the roasted potatoes.It was perfect!Lastly dessert had mousse,darsaan and three types of ice-cream along with sauces.Overall,there was nothing to complain about really.Every dish was seasoned very nicely.The service is very decent and the prices dont burn a hole in your pocket.Very satisfying.

Haka, a moderately priced restaurant in town for Chinese buffet.  Last weekend I went there with my pals for lunch. We had to wait for a while, coz it usually remains crowded. The ambience needs no special mention because it is already well known for its bustling and enchanting decor. So, moving on to the food section. We started with the soups, it had Veg Corn soup and Chicken Hot and Sour soup which was palatable, accompanied with the crispy noodles and prawn wafers. Yes, no doubt, the soup was hot and tasty which added a zing to my mood. Then the starters, consisted of two non veg dishes (which was disappointing, being a non-veg) and a few veg dishes (mustard potato, one more potato dish, dimsums, a dish with baby corn). I didn‚Äôt try any of the potato items, the dimsums were soft filled with corn and the baby corn dish was fine. There was only Chicken Wontons and Chicken Drumsticks in the non-veg section. The wontons were up to the mark, and so were the drumsticks. The wontons had the perfect chicken flavor, served with a spicy sauce. I love that salty taste in drumsticks and they served the perfect one. One round of starters (few of my friends went for some more rounds  :P ) and then we moved on to the main course. The first thing that dismayed my attention was the lack of Chicken dishes in this section. It had  Chicken Hakka Noodles, Mixed Fried Rice ( it should be called egg rice, coz it only had fried  egg pieces, there was no sign of prawn or chicken on it), Hot and Garlic Chicken, Mustard Prawn and one more fish item ( sorry for not remembering the name).  The noodles were mouth watering and also the chicken dish. The gravy of Hot and Garlic chicken was so nicely cooked. The fish preparation was good enough but I just don‚Äôt know what to say about the rice, the taste was bland.  The Mustard Prawn was proper Sorshe Chingri ( our very own Bengali dish), and I don‚Äôt know what the chef tried to make. It was the odd one out!!  After this little disappointment, I was glad to see the desert section. The chocolate mousse (awesome), cakes, three kinds of ice creams(vanilla, chocolate, mango , served with hot chocolate sauce and one orange flavored sauce) and darshan  blew my mood. The chocolate mousse was too good (it was not coated with dark chocolate layer and that was the best part), the fruit cakes were soft and flavorsome. The desert section was simple yet nice. 

I expected a little more and hope to get it by my next visit. They should add some more dishes in the main course, atleast in the weekend menu. For that if they want to charge more then definitely they should go for it!!

We went to Haka for Sunday night family dinner.  Food was terrible - everything (including chicken and potatoes) fried to the extent of dry and "card-board".  Fish and shrimp were just battered and dipped in the ocean of tasteless sauce.

Very bad experience!

It's extremely cheap, yes. One of the cheapest Chinese buffets you'll find in town. However the food leaves a lot to be desired. The menu too. The chow mein was stale, or at least tasted so. Most of the dishes either tasted bland or they were simply overcooked and burned. The desserts were extremely mediocre. Overall it's so bad that it's not worth the money.

Visit the Mani Square branch of Haka yesterday night along with my family, to celebrate birthday. It turned out to be a great experience. They only serve buffet and no ala carte option. So, we had to opt for the buffet for the evening. It was a great spread at such a reasonable rate. At INR 388, the quality of food and service was both quite amazing. The ambiance is also quite lively. The waiters were amicable. There was a wide range of food options, both veg and non-veg. My sole complaint- they should have included atleast two chicken dishes. but am not complaing. This specialty restaurant held good on promise of delivery. the fish items were amazing- I preferred the fish in oyster sauce. The kiwi mousse was amazing, although the brownie was a little too grainy and floury. The chicken sweet corn soup was amazing. But the chili baby-corn lacked the necessary crunch. Overall, satisfied. Will surely recommend to others. Pocket happy, tummy happy. Surely going back again soon.

Pocket friendly, nice ambience, well behaved staffs, to summarize a good place for students
I did visit this place during the buffet hours, the quality of the food was 3.5out of 5, 1.5got detucted because the chicken was not boneless, otherwise the quality was nice, another thing which i noticed was they removed Brownie from their buffet charts, it was the main attraction and they took that off, moreover they were taking a lot of time to refill, i had to ask more than 3times to refill some particular dish which i dont remember, Overall this place is great and if they can overcome these small problems it would be even better, and the behaviour of the staff members was really good..

EDIT: 22 July, 2014

The price has gone up- it is now 357 instead of 321 (A.I.). But the quality is the same as before- in fact, worse than what I had last time actually.

The soup, this time, was way watery and had very little chicken. I loved the crispy fried paneer and the veg crispy wontons but there was a sort of runny curry of corn, potato and bell pepper which was quite bland. The chicken basil wontons were nice, but the problem is that in all that accumulated steam inside the chafing dish, the wonton skin gets soggy and glue-y and not very nice to eat. The crispy chicken was an unmitigated disaster. In fact, if I never visit Haka again, the whole blame is to fall on this dish. The chicken was so tough that I couldn't even manage pierce it with my fork! Not to mention the bones! Some of the pieces were nothing but a row of rickety ribs coated in batter! Most pieces had the meat to batter ratio of 1:2. I wonder if they just gather a pile of unused chicken bits, batter them and serve in the buffet!

The mains had overly garlicky rice and noodles and a decently cooked Chicken Manchurian. In fact, the chicken in this side was rather nice.

The dessert had Monte Carlo, which I liked because of the generous layer of chocolate on top (but I would have liked if the ice cream and the cake was not so icy!). But what was rather shocking is that when the chocolate layer on top of the desert was finished and a few pieces of the cake remained, they refused to refresh the dessert! When we told them that the chocolate was finished and bring a fresh bowl, they simply doused the pieces of cake in chocolate sauce. Appalling!
___________________________________________________________________
When you get over the initial shock of the buffet price (Rs. 321 A.I), you start judging the place by its food and the result is quite disappointing. 

First off, the chicken soup was actually nice, loaded with dark soya sauce. I liked that it was quite salty instead of sweet and sour/hot and sour soups that I am not particularly fond of. However, the itsy bitsy pieces of chicken were scant. The prawn wafers were nice but the crispy noodles were a little hard. Maybe our timing was wrong, maybe the next batch was better.

The starters consisted of a number of vegetarian items and two non-veg. The kimchi was ordinary, the chili mustard potato seemed to be composed of very unlikely flavors that shouldn't be put together. The crispy vegetable parcels (may not be the exact name, but this is what they were) were nice, the batter was thin and crunchy. The crispy, spicy fried vegetables were really good- the batter was thin, crispy and spicy while the vegetables were soft and succulent. However, one tip: load up on these veg when they bring in a fresh batch. Otherwise the crust seems to harden up. The chicken wontons were full of chicken and had a clean, purely chicken-y taste, which I like in wontons. But I wish they had a more fiery sauce to accompany it. The one served that day was nothing more than a sour tomato sauce. The chicken drumsticks of heaven Shandong style were nice, but could do with a slightly thinner coat of batter. 

The main course had one non-veg item, ONE. Why? How? This is beyond disappointment. Even when I had called them, they said they have 2 non-veg items in mains. This is just unacceptable. Even the only chicken item had a weird taste that I didn't like and couldn't eat more than one piece of. I didn't taste the noodles, but I was told that they were just okay. The rice had very little veg in it but was full of dry red chilli, so much so that I couldn't eat more than a couple spoonfuls.

The dessert were surprisingly good. I mean, do not expect the variety of Flame and Grill or BBQ Nation, but the two items they had were quite good. The darsaan was light and crunchy and the mango pastry was very soft and not too sweet. They had chocolate, vanilla and mango flavored ice creams along with chocolate, mint and strawberry sauces.

I hope on my next visit, that is when I go broke again, Haka will have a better buffet spread for me.

D buffet here is one of the most reasonable i think. And d food quality matches up to that standard quite well. We went on a sunday brunch and they had spinach fried rice, cottage cheese, soup n vegetables tossed in a green sauce on the veg side and shrimps, chicken, fish, mixed rice and chowmein on the non veg platter. Both the sections were just mouthwatering delicacies. D shrimps were one of the heroes of the menu...it took away my heart literally. D dessert served at the end was ok...a decent end to the day's awesome meal. A must go for all......

Whenever my friends ask me to treat them to good food, I'm reminded of Haka because for  young people budget is a big factor and quantity of food being served is equally important. And Haka caters to both the requirements and on top of that they serve tasty food. 
Haka is well known for it's buffet which serves vegetarian and non vegetarian dishes. It has a soup, a couple of veg and non veg starters followed by a couple of veg and non veg main courses. The desserts generally include Darsaan, 3 ice cream flavours, brownie slices and a mousse. 
It is value for money, hygienic,  tasty and the people working in the restaurant are great.

Haka is one of those restaurants where you can go when your budget is low and you are in the mood to have a buffet meal. Although l, I've been to this place quite a number of times...but am not a fan of the kind of Chinese dishes made by them. It is just okay. Their dessert section has that clich√© darsan and ice cream, which is the only thing I really like.

The one thing I will say about this restaurant is that it's damn cheap! Around 300 bucks for a whole fulfilling buffet (I had gone on a weekday afternoon) is quite a deal. And the food was actually pretty good considering the price. The ambience was also impressive, though a bit noisy and chaotic. All in all, this is THE place to be if you want to give your group of friends a treat!

Haka at Mani Square offers cheapest chinese buffet in the metro. Since my college days I am a regular over there. Haka maintains its quality over the time. At a very low cost Haka's buffet includes soups, salads, starters, main course and deserts. Weekend buffets are better and a bit pocket burning but worth the penny. If you are into kebabs, skip Haka and enter flame&grill just 2 shops beside Haka.

i have tried their buffet uncountable times and again i visited this place yesterday. I really enjoyed the first time i visited this place because the spread was really good and i was overjoyed because of the price of the buffet that they were charging but now i think it has become really monotonous because i think there is hardly any variety in their dishes and the standard has decreased along with the items. Yesterday their buffet spread had shanghai chicken soup ( as far as i remember but thank god they did not serve the coriander soup which i never liked) salads, veg dim sum, crispy vegetables ( but i think i found only one type of vegetable in it), some paneer dish ( not sure as it did not look appealing so i did not even try it), chicken wantons, chicken drumstick, veg noodles, spinach fried rice, hot garlic chicken and in the dessert section there were chocolate rolls( a new item which i did not get in my previous visits), darsans and ice creams. In my previous visits i always saw that their buffet spreads had fish in it but alas this time there was none. Except the soup i did not like any item and the noodles hardly had  any vegetable in it and the look of it was so pale that i did not try it and the rice had little amount of spinach in it and the taste was just average. i just had 3 types of chicken items to fill up my stomach as the veg dim sum and crispy veg were really poor in taste. Yesterday i was so disappointed. I cannot really rate them badly as the price they charged was really on the lower side  i.e Rs. 320( inclusive of tax). My only suggestion will be that at least have one fish item in your buffet spread.

I tried the lunch and dinner buffet a few times. The pricing here is a little lower than many other restaurants in malls and therefore attracts people who do not want to splurge. The food is good and the ambience is nice. Service is prompt. I love Chinese food, so I enjoy the food here. Do not expect highly aesthetic ambience and that kind of food.

Haka, a prime example of consistent and inevitable decline of a restaurant. A once great restaurant has now been reduced to just another chinese dine in joint. The buffet is pathetic, with very few items to choose from and even fewer items that you would actually like. Its true that they do not charge much for the buffet, but still its not worth it. The a la carte is, to a large extent better. Service is good, ambience is average.

Haka is the cheapest in the Speciality Group of Restaurants. Or rather I can say a cheaper alternative to Mainland China. The outlet at Mani Square has only buffet though I had a-la-carte at its Salt Lake outlet few years back. 

Located inside Mani Square Mall, this place has been frequented by me several times whenever I went shopping or to catch a movie. 

The Buffet has a wide variety of menu and is extremely pocket friendly at about less than 400/- per person on a weekday. The starters are quite soulful. The dimsums too are nice. Steaming hot soup with fried noodles also tastes great. In the main course they give you the option of both trice and noodles. So you can have some of rice with your choice of side dish and then again some noodles with what you feel goes better with it. 

The drawback here is that as many times as I have been there...about 7-8 times...I find the items almost the same. Maybe it has happened so with me. Although I don't really remember all the names but I love their prawn preparation with rice. Everytime I have the biggest portion of this. The foods are all hot and they fill in immediately once it is exhausted.

The dessert part is but heart breaking. Tiny bits of cake and general vanilla, strawberry & chocolate ice cream. Super simple. But anyways what more can you probably expect out if this money, honey?

Located at Mani Square , this place disappointed me the very first time I visited there. Food options in Mani food court are already limited , so our friend decided to treat us with a Chinese Buffet Lunch .

The dining area is not too big , and has a simple decor with yellow lamps. The buffet is cheap , so its wrong to expect extravagant options. We visited on  a Tuesday ,  and the menu read as ( as many as I can remember ): -

1. Veg Hot n sour soup
2. Chicken Coriander soup
3. Chilli potatoes
4. Veg Fried rice
5.Chicken dim sums
6.Chicken drumstick
7. A chicken preparation that tasted between chilli chicken n Manchurian chicken
8. Brownie
9. Ice-cream with not so hot chocolate sauce

The soups were good ... steaming hot . The veg fried rice was waay below average ,  dim sums n drumsticks were jusst okayyy , so was the chicken preparation . The only relief were the brownies , small n soft .... and the ice-creams . But , I have serious doubts about the quality of the ingredients used in the preparation .

The buffet is cheap ... so it is pocket friendly for college people . But , still , cannot recommend it !!

First of all the ambience is just perfect for having a good time with family and friends. The quality of the food is great. Personally I loved Chicken Dimsum and also the Chicken soup among the starters. The Mixed Fried Rice and Chilli Chicken are good in the main course. And in the desserts section Mousse was just delicious and also the Brownies were awesome. All over it was a wonderful meal. It's worth a place to dine.

went there many times.. buffet at this place hover good to average.. heard that the chilli chicken in a la carte is better than the buffet one.. but till date we never got a chance to order separately as each time they simply denied and told to opt for buffet spread only.. whenever I see only buffet option.. i think of commodities because most of the eataries treat their spread like that and offer stale food (not in this one) .. their food is always hot here.. but over the years the menu had almost remained the same.. i complained about this previous time.. one very strange thing we had observed and it is not about the food.. the cleaners hit the kitchen door with a solid kick by their shoes to open it each time, there are other ways to do it for sure.. what's going on!! they got bored of their job, or they were enjoying doing this very rudely..
but please do not mistake.. they are very courteous towards the guest.. and it needs to change little things to make guest more happier.. i suggest..

If you are roaming around in Mani Square and are hungry for a value for money Chinese meal, Haka should be your pick. 

The interiors and ambience are okay. The seating though isn't all that comfortable. Although, I have to agree that the food is not bad and the buffet is worth every penny.

The buffet starts with an option on one vegetarian and one non vegetarian soup and some salads along with prawn wafers. All these are good.

Then are are two vegetarian and two non vegetarian appetisers. The cumin potatoes were nothing great. To be honest, they were potato wedges with cumin on top. The wonton was good though. The chicken sim sum was good as well. The chili chicken appetiser wasn't great. 

The main course had and option of rice or noodles. Two vegetarian dishes, and one chicken and one fish dish. The food wasn't bad. But I feel there should have been more variety in terms of the riceand noodles(by keeping a non vegetarian option). The desserts were good. They had an assortment of ice creams, darsaan, pastries, and a pudding.

The food here isn't that great, but if you're in a rush and want some Chinese this is the place to go. I also felt that the service could have been a bit better.

Had gone to this restaurant for the buffet. And apart from the economic benefits there was nothing worth mentioning.  The prices were reasonable but the preparations lacked variety with only 2 non veg starters on the menu. Even in the main course there was only veg rice/noodles with a single item of chicken. Though one cannot expect much at a cost of 350 per head (inclusive of taxes) yet the experience was not at all enjoyable.  And unless some variety is put into that menu this place will surely not be visited in a hurry by me.

This was famous joint for me & my pals during college days..we have visited more than 10 times there..Not many variety of food but for the college students HAKA is worth every penny...

in around 300 rupees you get soup(Veg/Chicken)..kimchi salad..some prepariots of our bengali's all time favourite aloo..veg dim sum..chicken wonton...veg fried rice..veg noodles..Veg prepation with capsicum mushroom paneer...2 types of chicken...
Then dessert...they change the menu either brownie/cake/custard along with 4 types of different flavoured ice cream...

I have some good memories here...

Oh ha i forgot to mention they provide with darshan dipped in honey..If you are looking for a sweet ending to a hot and spicy Chinese repast then take darshan with ice cream & feeel it...

Another delectable outlet serving lip smacking food at more than affordable prices, i wonder if they make any profit whatsoever.

The specualtion depends on various fronts as to wats the price for the buffet, is it good etc etc, this review is for the buffet lovers. Its spacious with very well decorated nd maintained spaces , the use of space and the lining of the tables also catches your eye, coming to the food i went there on multiple occasions all on weekdays, the buffet spread starts with 2 kinds of soup ,prawn wafers, kimchi salad ( Not imp.really ):P for we all love chicken coming back to the menu then they had crispy chilli babycorn, schezwan cottage cheese , now the main course which consisted of drums of heaven ( a must have as many as u can gorge on ) noodles and fried rice both variants veg non veg, the fried rice was absolutely marvellous being so.light and you could literally see each grain of rice , there were dumplings which melt in your mouth and they had sweet and sour chicken , for desserts they had warm chocolate sauce and brownies and 4types of ice cream .
The staff is very cordial and helping and the best part is every item is being constantly monitored and replenished when nearing empty. The bill for two came at 630 bucks inclusive of taxes. They serve alcohol too if u have the urge for a buzz .

VERDICT - Pocket friendly , good food and ambience , ideal for students and LAWYERS alike . ( You know how miserly we lawyers are )

DIRECTIONS AND TIMING- its open for lunch from 12:30-3:30 and dinner from 7 - 10:30 pm. Reach manisquare anyway u can and its above the food court

The next time we went for the buffet which was even better. I would recommend this to those who wish to have quality Oriental fare sans the exorbitant bill.

Went to haka on a friend's bday treat!!! Well the decor was nice so was the ambience. Went for the buffet out there. Firstly, their starters was nice containing the devils chicken and chicken dimsums, but as we went along the main course the choices was less so was the taste was not up to the mark. But still considering price it was OK but then also they should provide more choices and also their deserts.

A place where they serve only buffet spreads -- both for lunch and dinner. 
Pros -- If you want to treat a large group and not spend a lot of money -- come here as the prices are pretty reasonable. Located in the top floor of a mall which is easily accessible from all parts of the city. The staff are friendly. Food taste is okay, nothing wow!
Cons -- This place serves a boringly repetitive menu with hardly any innovation or variety. The seating arrangement could be made a little more comfortable. 
Good for a first time visit but not for a second visit unless you do not want to experiment at all.

I have visited here many times. I have always had lunch from Buffet, both in Weekdays and weekends. The menu is mostly the same every time i have visited. There are no change in it all over the week. You might get bored if you visit here often. As I had my food from buffet I cant say much about Service. Haka offers mainly Chinese food's but I think It can do a little more work on their interiors. They are not that much special as U have wished for. But you can visit there if u are in Mani Square. The price is very low in Buffet compared to others.

Went there for a quick lunch buffet on Saturday, when we (wifey + myself) were damm hungry. 
We got the table and was seated near the buffet area. 

The starters were good, and it tasted yummy. The dry chicken was good to eat along with hOT momo they serve. The main course consists of 3/4 items including both fried rice and chowmen.  

Where they lack is dessert , and the options for desserts are really less. Only a cake, and some ice cream was there (not of great quality though).
Considering the low price for buffet, its a good value for money place.

I have been to this place about 3 times now.A movie at Imax coincides with lunch at Haka.The last time I went,music was soothing,decor is ok for a Chinese restro.The buffet is decent,with chicken sweet corn soup and the crispy noodles being tasty.We had fresh wontons come up,which were a delight.I liked the garlic pepper chicken they make,although the chilly chicken we ordered a la carte was boneless,and better.in terms of variety.there is not much to choose from.Chicken noodles and a spicy gravy chicken item were there,which was nice.The dessert is good,and they give you all the chocolate sauce you can have,with ice cream and brownies.For a Rs 350 buffet,I would say a good value for money.Good place for a family/friends lunch/dinner.

Prices being a bit lesser than its city centre counter part, the spread in offer  also has lesser number of items. the taste is good. Bt they didn't have any non veg item as a choice of rice or noodles. The worst thing was the hunan chicken which came with bones!! Sorry haka, this simply scored a negative. The haka special chilli chicken was tasty and went well with the ginger fried rice. The fruit custard was awesome but didn't quite like the darshan. Choice of ice creams with chocolate sauce was a nice way to end the meal. They even served a complementary platter of assorted stir fried vegetables.

We went for a buffet lunch, about 20 people in the group.
The food was properly arranged and the staff was assisting everyone with the dishes and there description. The ambiance was good and as we were the first one to arrive the place wasn't so crowded.
Starters were really good and by the time we reached out for the main course we were already full but we still munched on.
Food tasted really good and was hot when we had it.
Fortunately we spotted an offer that anybody paying through ICICI cards will be offered a free mocktail and we just grabbed on it and had blue lagoon mocktail as compliments from the restaurant.
Though I haven't tasted the a-la-crate yet but would love to go back and have it.

A terrible experience on a Saturday Dinner-
Buffet was the only option. One thing any 'foodie' would agree with me- Any food, specially Chinese tastes best when served 'HOT', as in temperature.
Here was an unique experience of a 'cold buffet'. No.. the soup was actually the only hot thing in the whole buffet.
The taste of all the dishes was way below any level of understanding. 
There were only 4 waiters to attend a full up restaurant on a Saturday evening. No managers/ Supervisors to be seen throughout. (Strange for a restaurant of any stature). So tables were not getting cleared when required. We even cleared ourselves to the Side Station.
End of it - a very Disappointing Experience. Should not have heard about some recommendations as well as the Zomato rating, which quite misled us.

Never again!!!!!!!

i have been there once and took the dinner buffet. the interior decor is nice and the stuffs are friendly. they serve chinese buffet and the food price is reasonable. however, the items offered on the buffet don't have too many non-veg dishes. they would have 2-3 non-veg starters and 2-3 sides in the whole buffet. the bar is well stocked but they would charge 26% SLT on alcoholic drinks. food tasted well and was tasty as well as not too spicy. my favorite was lamb in oyster sauce along with lemon chicken.

Haka, for me translates to 'value for money'. There is no other food joint in Kolkata providing as much bang for your buck as this place without compromising on the quality of food. I have been to Haka on a number of occasions and i was delighted by their service every single time. I would suggest the Sunday Brunch with a special menu. It costs slightly more than the regular weekday offering but gets you novelty dishes. Its a must visit if you can hog well on Chinese food. My personal favorites are the Crispy Chicken Wan-tons and the Chicken Drumsticks. Do order for a fresh lime soda to gulp your food down. It really is a must.

No body especially I would never have guessed that this Haka carries the same name of the Haka located in City Center, salt lake. I really don't find any other resemblance between the two. While I really seriously wouldn't think twice about a social recommendation of the other Haka, this one is a whole different story. 

I have tasted both a la carte and buffet dishes here as well, and the buffet was sub-par.... Like cold stale food... Nothing that appealed to any of my senses. It looked all messed up and dirty in the buffet dishes and its such a turn off for the palate to see food morsels here and there over the table and the dishes messed up with food being roughly shoved around on the dishes. 

The chef here is not to competent at turning out light tasty dishes from the a la carte menu either. The pan fried noodles which I ordinarily love were one big huge sticky mess :( The chicken soup was listless and uninspiring. 

The servers are not very courteous, the crowd is the loud/ raucous/ teeming with unruly children/ families from a certain community visiting Mani Square which doesn't add to the charm of the place. I avoid. Would ask people who want to try the food of haka to try the salt lake joint please.

Cheers.

An numerable visit may be since i live two block away from CC1 and go for buffet....as I love their buffets and My Korean friends love their foods, whenever they visit India.
But today I came here on lunch with my office colleagues 
Crispy Five Spice Chicken	
Honey Garlic Fish
Dry Fry Chilli Fish
Spicy Crabmeat and Shrimp Soup	
Crabmeat fritters in Hunan Style	
Mixed Vegetables in Sichuan Sauce	
Hot and Spicy Chairman's Chicken	
Chengdu Chilli Clay Pot Vegetables	
Prawn in a Spicy Bean Sauce	
Braised Fish in Chilli Bean Sauce	
Prawn Fried Wontons	
Roast Lamb with Chilli and Blackbean Sauce
Chilli and Garlic Noodles	
and please dont talk about deserts.......after all these we do not have space for many

First of all this is not authentic Chinese so Since it is one of those Sino-Indian cuisines born in tangra.....it was a great break especially it was impressive to my Japanese colleagues and It was hit and especially impressed our new client side from Taiwan, and thanks to Haka we got the project....
The staffs are always courteous. and just like in Japan, HAKA divide the bills individually. as it is frequent stopover to many Japanese coming to Kolkata for business tour.
So five star to haka

We went for their buffet, so this post is based on that only. Located at the top floor of the Mani Square mall, this place is nicely done up in very vibrant shades of red, the Chinese-wala red. The seating arrangement was pretty satisfactory, the staff were welcoming. Coming to the food, the menu was quite predictable. We went on a weekday and the menu contained the regular preparations, good enough for a buffet. Their dishes cannot be called 'Authentic chinese' but however they tasted, I really liked the food. Would happily recommend to someone who want to treat their BIG group of friends to a filling lunch/dinner but doesn't want much of the dreaded pocket-pinch.

Im not really a fan of this place when it comes to good Chinese food. For me, i think an restaurant's ambiance is extremely important and this HAKA could have done much more than just look so dull and boring. 
The food is light and tasty. What i love at HAKA is the Wonton Soup, sweet and sour vegetables on Crispy noodles, Stir fried Chicken and chilli garlic noodles.
Im not a fan of their buffet menu at all even though this is by far the most reasonable rate for buffets amongst all restaurants I've come across in Kolkata.

And please remove haka dry chilli chicken from the buffet menu as it is always infested with bones instead of chicken....

I have been a Haka (salt lake) fan for a long time and this is only my second visit at this Haka at Mani Square and it was highly disappointing. For me ambience and service of a restaurant goes a long way and in these spheres this restaurant lacked big time. The ambience is dull and lifeless. The service is close to awful. The waiters are unimpressive and lack knowledge about their own joint. The food was average, the buffet spread included chicken and coriander soup which was good but suprisingly the buffet had just one main course dish which was a chilly chicken and no non veg rice or noodles not even a one with eggs. Highly disappointing. And it did have desserts. All this came for Rs.321 which was quite pocket friendly if you ask me. I just expected a lot more out of this place subtracting the food. I would request to train the staff and do up this place in a better way in my opinion. And they should also include atleast a free lime soda with their buffets. Have a good time eating here.

Haka's quality has gone down over the past few years. I remember cherishing haka food at city centre-1 in spite of not being a Chinese lover. Recently visited their mani square branch reading such amazing reviews....unfortunately had a bad experience.

FOOD: The menu didn't have too many items...starting from snacks or main course or deserts. The only dish which is worth mentioning was the wontons but it was also very oily. Veg items were more than non veg items....didn't find chicken dim sum which a zomato member strongly recommended.

SERVICE: average

PRICE: Buffet- rs 400 incld taxes(Sunday dinner)

The Zomato reviews were only based on price & not on food, so got tricked.

very disappointed in the food quality and taste of HAKA. There were too less Veg Items and moreover the momos were kind of stale, with the crispy baby corn being everything but 'crispy'. I had heard great reviews about HAKA but was taken aback by the choice of Food ITEMS. 
Even the ICE-Cream had a taste of medicine with the carrot cake being as good as any other Britaniia Good day Cake.

I would not recommend anyone to have dinner at HAKA.

Haka - The most affordable of all the restaurants by the Speciality group.
Haka's cuisine is chinese. It has two outlets : Mani Square (E M Bypass) and City Centre (Salt Lake)

Friend and I went to Haka for an afternoon lunch. I was already sulking because I lost a few bucks to the cab driver and hence now chose to eat at Haka because it was not stingy in the pockets and pretty safe as well.
Haka has an assortment of an entire buffet right from the soup and starters to the desserts at an affordable price of INR 295/- on weekdays and the prices shoot up to INR 345/- on  the weekends.

Amazing isnt it?

So, we started with the soup and the starters. The soup of the day was Chicken sweetcorn soup and had a chicken starter which was spicy and nice and complimented the sweetness of the soup.
The soup was brilliant that day. I took two big helpings of it because I liked it so much.
 Proceeding to the main course, the veg rice that they have is very nice. It has veggies and corn sprinkled all over and is fresh too.
The noodles were butter garlic noodles. Had the slight hotness but the buttery element neutralized it and it tasted good.
There was also a preparation of chicken which tasted good too.

Food is generally good here.
Lastly, the desserts had chocolate cake slices (w/o chocolate sauce), darsaan and ice cream (vanilla, strawberry and chocolate)
I had all three desserts and with a tummyful of food merrily walked out.
An afternoon spent well.

Will be back for more.
cheers! :)



----- 13 Nov, 2013 -----

There is nothing to be described about Haka. It gives the cheapest buffet in town yet maintains a quality.
Went with a friend last sunday. It was almost full. We entered at 3 which was pretty late.
The buffet spread was pretty good. 
My friend and I had noodles, a preparation of mandarin fish, sweet n sour chicken and the chili chicken were with bones.
I 'd deduct one point for that.
But the quality was really really good.

The desserts comprised of date wontons, custard and ice cream/
Because i dont eat dates, i chose custard n ice cream.
Both of them were really good.
Haka was at its  best that day! :)

If your pockets are  bit tight, Haka wont make it difficult for you.
HAPPY EATING GUYS,
CHEERS! :)

Been there for lunch on Valentine's Day.
Pros: Buffett lunch@ INR 405, all inclusive was a good deal. The spread included soup, two salads, two starters (of which the fried chicken wanton was really good). Main course included a noodle (average), chicken fried rice,  one chicken, one fish and one prawn all of which were quite delicious. Dessert was reasonable with a good mousse, and average fruit salad and slightly stale ice cream.
Ambience was good,  service was ok.

visited this place innumerable number of time.. ambiance is good.. no complain with that.. moreover the menus @weekends are just too good considering the price.. earlier they used to be bones in their dry chili chicken dish.. but now a days most of them are boneless.. some special items which I like/recommend
1. paneer cubes
2. paneer stuffed momo (both if you like paneer, of course!)
3. chicken in red garlic sauce
4. chocolate brownie wid chocolate sauce (they were just awsum) 
5.choco mousse
6. darshan
spent some really good time here! :)

Well its really economical during weekdays. We were a group of 20. The ambience was good. Loved the kimchi, a traditional cabagge salad and the momos were delicious. But the swiss rolls in desserts was a bit too sweed and had too much cream.. Overall a good place to be in. :)

I had to change my previous rating of the place and increase it by an entire one whole number. They have surely revamped the buffet menu when compared to my second last visit to the place, some time in September 2013. I visited this place a few days back and was greeted by a whole new buffet menu, well nothing extraordinare, yet, the green minty curry of the melt-in-your-mouth fish and the variety of dimsums had me smiling. 
I noticed, and gobbled up quite a number of what seemed to be a new addition (again), crunchy coconut pastries. these beauties tasted glorious with chocolate sauce.

Keeping aside the food for a moment, the real wow factor of the place lies in the price of the buffet; so much food, and such a small price to pay for it (except for the uneasiness in walking and the tremendous "lyadh" that sets in right after you have over stuffed yourself :D )

We were a ravenously hungry and moderately poor group of five. Upon entering the enclosed space, going by the name of ‚ÄòHAKA‚Äô, we rarely stopped to think - we only ATE. In retrospect, we took the meaning of ‚Äòall-you-can-eat buffet meals‚Äô to rather shocking levels.

Adorned with all things red, HAKA is neatly and comfortably furnished. We chose the buffet meal service over the a la carte service. The following represent the items that I chose off the available buffet menu:
 (1) Grilled Paneer: Amazing? Check. There was a creamy smoothness to the paneer yet a lingering Tandoori impact of the grilled cooking.
 (2) Spinach Wontons: These gems looked like tea bags. They were slightly crunchy,  terribly delicious and even boasted of a cheese burst in your mouth on some occasions.
 (3) Stir Fried Vegetables: Honestly, it seemed like a consolation dish for the vegetarians - oily and completely unpleasant.
 (4) Chicken Dimsums: Yum yum, to sum up. Soft, delectable and unsparing amounts of chicken in every mouthful!
 (5) Chicken Taipei: In the same league as Chicken Manchurian, this dish, although not boneless, was scrumptious.

There were also chop suey, vegetables tossed in some kind of red sauce, chicken doused in soya sauce and the routine choices of Chow and Fried Rice up for consideration, and the ‚Äòthumbs up‚Äô agreement for all was unanimously taken across our table.

Of the dessert spread, I stuck to Chocolate Cake, several scoops of ice-cream (the available flavours were: chocolate, vanilla, strawberry) and Chocolate Sauce. They were ordinary to taste AND there was not an incredible variety to choose from, which I was ready to forgive on account of offering one of the most affordable buffet meal services.

Charging Rs. 321 a plate including taxes (weekday lunch), it was quite an experience. I deducted half a point because there were several instances of the food on service being cold (also, I wish the chocolate sauce had been served hot) and another half a point for the insufficient choices for the vegetarians.

I plan to revisit as soon as possible and shamelessly gorge as much as possible :D

Have been there to this place few times. Located at the top floor of Mani sqaure mall, it is an excellent place for chinese buffets. Have experienced both lunch & dinner buffets. Both veg & non-veg choices are available. It starts with a soup, then starters, few main courses of veg, fish & chicken, with rice & noodles. Finishes with desserts. Choices of starters are less. Food quality is quite good. To get this quality of food, at this cheap rate is truly excellent. The lack of variety can be expected at this price. Staffs behavior is very friendly. Both the ambience & cleanliness is very good. I thoroughly recommend this place to chinese food lovers for whom budget is an issue....

In my opinion:
Food quality 4/5
Ambience 4/5
Service/attitude 4.5/5
Value for money 5/5

Overall - worth a shot!!

Craving for Chinese food I decided to visit Haka on a weekend for the lunch buffet.We arrived at around 2:30 and was greeted by the staff with smiling faces.
Now for starters they are now served on the table whereas main course and desserts you have to go and bring.First we had manchow soup which was tasty and with a pinch of sourness.Then we were served with prawn papads which is normal and you can get them at local shops too.The next item (which I loved) was fried chicken wanton, it was crispy with the right amount of chicken,next came the pepper garlic wings which a little sweet yet very delicious.I think this was the item I had the most.For drinks we ordered a pitcher of mango juice with lemon and ginger zest.This was quite refreshing and tasty too.
Coming to main course it was a normal affair with chicken,shrimp and fish side dishes and garlic noodles and chicken fried rice.Since I was nearly stuffed with dessert I took a little rice and shrimp and chicken.Out of these the shrimp tasted the best even though I found the shrimp and chicken preparations were nearly same.
For desserts there was darshan,mousse,cake and ice creams (chocolate,mango and vanilla).I took a little darshan and mousse.The mousse had an unsual peppermint flavour.
The total bill was around 2020 which I would say is quite ok considering the amount of food they provide.Will be back soon for ala carte.

Haka is a complete value for money Chinese restaurant with class. I love the pocket-friendly buffet that never fails to fill me up. My personal favorite in the buffet menu is the crispy fried chicken and also the fried potatoes. The prawns are also delicious. What I do not like about the spread, however, are the noodles. They are never upto my expectations in a fine-dining place like this, I have visited haka six or seven times but never have I been truly satisfied with the noodles. I like the sauces that accompany the dishes, though. I also happen to adore the sui mai and the zucchini. All in all, I would totally recommend haka because it is extremely satisfying and I cannot help myself but glance at least once at the restaurant whenever I visit mani square!

Went for weekend lunch buffet with family of 12. Haka did not dissapoint. Shrimps were simply outstanding. And so was the fish is mustard sauce. Overall buffet was worth the cheque, however they could improve upon the sitting arrangement for larger groups. It seemed as if they had stuffed in more tables to get more customers per session, but that does spoil the interior decor a bit leaving less space to walk over to the food counters. And even less space to walk out of your chairs. Water jug could be changed. And its always a plus if a restaurant has a washroom. Haka doesnt. 
Coming back to food, rice could be tastier. So does the veg soup.
Service was nice, waiters were patient. Oh & I dont understand whats wrong with the choice of music they choose to play these days. 
Room for improvement available but yes, value for money. So go check it out.

We have been going to Haka for office lunch, this was our third visit. Its a self service restaurant. We availed buffet non veg lunch which had three parts: starters, main course and deserts. The starter had soup and some snack items. Main course was good with main options, of which most tasted good. The desert part simple with vanilla ice cream-chocolate and some good sweet dishes and cakes.

Value for money-wise this is perhaps one of the best buffets available in the city at present. Haka which is part of the Specialty Restaurants Group which also owns Mainland China , Flame and Grill etc. is focusing at making good food affordable and available to the middle income group. The place is usually packed and the buffet options are pretty great except the fact that their chicken dish is not boneless and they need to mix up the variety a bit because if your a regular the items get repetitive after a while. The a-la-carte menu also has good options and we often order from that as well.  Here are some of my favorites from the a-la-carte menu .... Chicken Suimai or Chicken Wanton Soup to start with , Crabmeat Fried Rice with Mixed Meat Hakka Noodles are both excellent ... pair with Hunan Chilly Prawns , Stir Fried Chicken with Chilly and Oyster Sauce or the Lemon Chicken. End with the lovely Caramel Custard they serve.

Wonderful, sumptuous buffet spread. The chicken, fish and prawn dishes were simply fabulous. So were the mixed noodles and fried rice. Soup and starters were ok (included chicken dimsum). Cannot imagine such a grand offering at 339 plus taxes (405 total) given today's market conditions. I would return here again and again if Haka maintains this quality and price point.

Food tasted decent enough considering that of  buffet BUT  my friend said that one of  chicken item was tasting little stale, and with a small whiff, i only agree the same.
Its the cheapest buffet n its true but cant be at the cost of stale foods!!, especially high protein foods like chicken n all,, cuz if they are stale then it might cause pretty bad of a food poison!! We are lil skeptic for second visit

I was never fond of Chinese food, but I would admit, I liked the food there. It was not something out-n-out delicious, but surely it was more than what I had expected it to be...

Both the buffet and a la carte food where good anough and reasonable...

Be there with your family or friends group to enjoy a light-hearted conversation and tasty food... !!!

Well this is one of the worst Chinese food  have ever had. The buffet spread may look tempting with the number of dishes as lined up but the quality and the taste of the food is horrible. In fact twice i  got some hair in my food , after which i stopped going their. this place may serve cheap buffet spread which fits to once budget for giving group treats to friends and family. But i shall never think in that way . Its avoidable for sure!!

An authentic chinese resturant. While many claim to be serving good chinese food, this place actually does that. And their buffet system is something more special about them. They offer from soups to desserts in their buffet and that too at a very reasonable price.. I strongly suggest people to visit this place if you would like to have some good chinese food. If you feel mainland china is a bit too heavy to your pocket, trust me this is the place you'd want to be..

The buffet is really good with wide range of delicacies and i really loved the place.
Please go folks and have yourself drooled over those tasty dishes.
I would love more of its outlet in the town.
Rated 4.5 out of 5 !

Haka should quote their buffet price inclusive of all taxes which they dont, so those who are planning to visit this place should research the price including tax.

Well i visited Haka at Mani square along with a friend of mine who is also am expert taster. An here is my review about this restaurant. First of all the good parts the restaurant is spacy and has a nice deco of a chinese lady on the wall eating a bowl of noodles. The deco and interior is satisfactory nothing extraordinary. The staff were polite but not professional. 

I decided to check out the buffet which was of chinese cuisine. Well there were shrimps, fish in basil sauce, Chicken, crispy baby corn. Salads, soup, Drums of heaven were also included. Fried rice and noodles, and steam white rice also was available. For the dessert there were Ice cream of three flavours vanilla strawberry and chocolate, and darsan. There was also one sort of pudding also. Although there was nice buffet spread but yet the standard of the food was certainly not to our liking, i certainly enjoyed the shrimp, the fish in basil sauce and boneless chicken. However the fried rice and the chowmein were not up to the mark. The soup was ok but nothing extraordinary.  I also enjoyed the darsan with ice cream however the pudding was very disappointing it lacked taste certainly and i left the pudding on the plate. 

I could not understand the logic of why the waiter came twice and presented us with toothpicks when we did not request for it. The price of the buffet was alright.

This probably is the cheapest buffet serving restaurants of Kolkata. The best thing about this place is the fact that the food quality is not sacrificed despite of the variety of items in the menu. 

The chili chicken is slightly disappointing because it is not boneless and I did not find the darsaan extra special unlike most of the people. They can include a few more dessert items but overall, this place is decent enough

I went there on Friday. It was Mahalaya, so they apparently had special buffet menu with a special price - 381 per pax (including tax).
The ambience and decor is nice and professional,  although nothing special.
On the food front, there were 2 soups, a veg and a non veg...pretty standard in taste. The veg starters were a big big let down. They had fried veg momos and 2 potato starters. I was hugely disappointed to not find either babycorn or mushroom in the starters. The momo was okayish, and the potato ones are nothing to write home about. There was steamed chicken momo and drums of heaven in non-veg. They were okayish. 
For the main course they had 2 rice and 2 noodles. Again, nothing worth mentioning. However, the chicken, fish and prawn side dishes were really good, especially the prawn. It was probably the best item on the menu. I didn't try the veg side dishes. 
For dessert, they had 3 flavours of ice cream (vanilla, chocolate and strawberry), darshan, cakes, mousse.
Overall, a pretty average-to-standard menu. I couldn't find any reason why or where this was special.
Go for it if you wanna have standard chinese buffet on okayish price.

The rating 1 is just for the desert and the music. Else nothing is worth tasting at Haka .  All the items just look different, but taste the same - - BORING.  Service is pathetic. Waiters hardly pay attention or feel very annoyed when you want something.  The ambiance makes you feel as if you are eating without paying for it .  Very irritating and disappointing place.

If you think You would save money If you Choose Their 'SPECIAL' Buffet instead of the A La Carte Menu Then Guys you are sadly mistaken, the Buffet Is A Sad Little Menu With Cold & Not Yummy Food, Boneless Starters WITH CHUNKS of bones, Literally No Options Left if you dont eat one or two items.
AND please note that this does not mean the A La Carte menu is something extravagant, It is Seriously not worth the money, Which says everything form the service lack to the quality lack.
Haka is just a restaurant that opened in the wrong place among'st some really huge chains, which has to pay huge rent, and thus is unable to succeed.
Hope for something better.

their buffet spread is probably the cheapest in town....
whereas the quality is not much compromised...
been there for lunch about 5-6 times and was overall satisfied with the food...

they serve a couple of soups which r quite good and is a must for chinese restaurants...
the starters r good as well as the salads..
though the dry chilli chicken still is not boneless(god knows why)....
wantons and dimsums are good enough...
noodles and rice are okayish..so r the chicken and the veg items...
in the desserts area, darshaan is the clear winner with 3 types of ice cream and cakes to accompany...

overall reasonable unlimited food at a more reasonable price....

The place is a very grab and run kind of situation. its a buffet system all day and the variety of the same for the price is just really good. it tastes good and the place is doing good. the pushing and the pulling of the people there should justify in saying that this place is doing well. it was a fun evening but the only issue is that due to the amount they need to make the taste and authenticity of the food goes down quite a bit.

all in all a good experience.

Pro -
1) The food were tasty.
2) Nice ambiance
3) Really nice improvements on the starters
Con-
1) non veg items from the main course has been reduced. 
2) Desert section needs improvement. Its becoming too monotonous.

Visited the restaurant yesterday at about 12.30. The buffet spread wasn't ready by then.. We were asked to have a sit and wait for 10 minutes, while they are on it. Mean while, they served soup and prawn papad at our table. 

The soup present were vegetable sweet corn and chicken soup. 
Salads were okay.. For the non veg starter, there were chicken dimsum, which was delicious. The chili chicken dry and chicken in sauce (Don't remember the exact name) was also good. 

The sad part was, the fried rice and noodles were veg. And they didn't have any fish item. 

The desert consisted of ice cream, Darsaan and strawberry moose..



----- 07 Sep, 2013 -----

It was my 5th visit to Haka.  The buffet spread was of Rs 300 All Inclusive. It was a mixed experience.. No doubt, some of the dishes were really good (Dry chilli chicken and chicken in sauce), but the over all experience was not as good as expected.. 
1) The non veg main course had fewer items than last time we visited. No fish item
2) The noodles were not tasty
3) They seriously need to improve on the desert section. Its really monotonous.. ice cream, darsaan and moose..
On the bright side,
1) They have improved on the starters.. The chicken dimsum was too good
2) The ambience and hospitality of the staff is good.
What really disappointed me was the reduction of items from their buffet spread.. Otherwise it was a nice experience

Haka has been set up to target the budget oriented people and pull them out of their regular food joints. A very spacious room with mediocre decoration but excellent Chinese food - that is exactly how you can summarize Haka; not to forget the comfort of your pocket that is left undisturbed. the buffet generally includes shrimps/prawns in the main course which is definitely a rare sight and the really good quality of those items ensures a positive outcome from the diners. They also present a Chicken Salad and Momo in the starter, and they taste perfect. Although a few more variety of soups and starters would be the next great thing for this place, I feel it is getting almost everything right with the young mall-hoppers wishing for an excellent Chinese cuisine with the least pocket-pinch. The desert section is perhaps the one area that needs serious improvements. Almost all the options are as same as that in F&G, without that quality. Haka needs to think of a separate desert variety that suits its overall presentation best.

Haka is another restaurant from the speciality group and an economy division of Mainland China.  The decor is mediocre. The place is quite big, adequately spaced and comfortable enough. The staff are warm and service is quite fast. They serve only buffet and no Ala Carte. The dinner buffet priced at 333 AI on weekdays and 380 AI on weekends which i feel is very reasonable. for such place.

I love their clear soup and i find it to be one of the best in town. They have 2-3 salads that are nice. Fried or steamed wantons are pretty good. Apart from them , they have 2 or 3 other starters. I love their paneer starters especially the hot basil paneer. The staff do provide complimentary 1 each of starter and main course dish of your choice apart from set buffet to vegetarians which i think is applaudable. The fried rice and noodles are good. Now for the main course vegetables, i find they do not keep their best possible options. I order for a manchurian or a potato and corn in hot garlic beside the buffet that makes it great for me. But the vegetables offered in buffet are not the best i would say and i tend to avoid them in the end. This is the only negative i would point. Deserts options include darsaan which i like and some carrot cakes etc and ice creams which was good enough. 

But in the end the buffet is crazy at its price !!

Pros:
1) Amazing food for that price
2) Comfortable place
3) Warm service

Cons:
1) Decor isn't that grand
2) Main course vegetables aren't that great

Today I visited the place with my friends.The price is reasonable for the weekend buffet, I think it is Rs. 319/- + Tax. You will have chicken, fish and prawn delicacies. Few of the dishes I can remember are - prawns in fresh chilli coriander sauce,fish in chilli mustard sauce,haka chilli chicken,chiken Tajpei,chiken fried wanton,veg dimsum,chicken sweet corn soup etc. I loved the prawn preparation and wanton most.In the desert you have Darshaan,icecream.

After Mainland China's success in Kolkata , Anjan targeted the young & budget minded people to draw them to his no-frill Chinese Restaurant called the Hakka which I admit was an intelligent move on his part & a great success too!Unlike Mainland China , this chain of restaurant has a very simple yet well done interior.I found the attire of the waiters donning  Black & Red,  pretty smart , in fact all his specialty restaurants have a different eye-appeal !This place was a hit & a favourite of  many as the spread offered in the Buffet was simply great compared to the price. I remember having had my first buffet for as little as Rs.165/-plus taxes & was more than satisfied with the food & service ! Of late however the buffet prices have  gone up and those who care for shrimps/prawns , which is generally served on weekends,would  end up paying more, as the spread on weekdays normally  does not include Shrimps/Prawns , even though fish is generally one of the items ! But let me tell you, you will not regret it & if you can really eat well then you are in a win- win situation! A  word of caution........Vegetarians do not have as much choice as Non-Vegetarians ! 

Only one area I feel needs to be considered, that is , the Starters could have some more choice & the desserts should be more &  varied too! I am sure my request would be addressed soon!

This branch is located on the top floor of Mani Square and offers the best value for money buffet at just 295+taxes.And,on 15th Aug the Celebration lunch provided here was just amazing for only Rs 380.The ambiance having a black and red theme is quite good but not excellent.Now coming to the food one will just be amazed by seeing the 10 -12 types of items being provided here.The buffet starts with Veg/Chicken  Sweet Corn Soup followed by 2-3 types of salads,Prawn wafers,paneer sticks with potato wedges tossed in garlic.Starters included veg dim sum,Veg pakora,and the best chicken drumsticks.And not to forget the 3 types of sauces they provided were really tasty.After all these they offer you with Veg and Egg Hakka noddles,Capsicum Rice and Chicken Rice accompanying  them were Chili Chicken,Fish in Parsley Sauce,Shrimps with veggies.And to end the  monstrous buffet we had 3 types of Ice Cream,Strawberry Mousse,Custard with fruits.
Though the food is  not the best compared to other Chinese restaurants but tasty.A must visit for foodies.

Haka is owned by the Specialty group and is a junior form of Mainland China. The restaurant provides both A-la-carte and buffet at reasonable prices (cheaper than Mainland China). After a visit to Haka, I was surprised to see the poor quality that Specialty group has come down to.

The food was nowhere near to the tastes of Mainland China. I had my stomach suffer the very next day after having a buffet lunch there. Now this could be just me but I strongly doubt the quality of ingredients used to prepare the food. Going to the menu, nothing out of the ordinary, in fact many items missing from the Mainland China's menu and in the buffet not many options are included.

Moving further to the restaurant, decorations are just about average. The restaurant is decently decorated but they have no false ceiling to cover the air conditioner ducts (at least it was the situation when I visited the restaurant couple of months ago).

To sum up, I don't think that I would recommend anyone to give a visit to Haka till I get some positive reviews about the restaurant and pay another visit. Haka seems to be just a cheaper varient of Mainland China wherein quality of food has been compromised by visible differences.

This one is located on the top floor of Mani Square and I have been here a few times for the buffet as well as the A-La-Carte and I must say I have very mixed feelings about the place. The buffet is nice, but I cannot get over the fact that I find the chicken starters to be too full of bones, and thus, have a feeling that they have just used the stuff leftover after deboning the chicken. Service is often forgetful and boring, but a la carte is okay.

Nobody, but nobody, offers such a huge spread of Chinese buffet at this price in the town, best, if you take price/quality ratio, and, the food are mouth watering. One humble request to the management, please fill up the buffet bowls of the mains, this is kinda objectionable to see people are standing in a queue for non veg mains and instead of filling up, you just put pieces of the same for several times to restrict them in amount, not expected from Anjan babu. Please look into it.

Having heard quite a lot on the Buffet spread "Haka" offers,  I decided to drop by yesterday.. Please be aware that, though Zomato mentions the dinner timings as 06.30 pm to 11.00 pm, I was surprised when someone outside the place told me, it was actually 7 PM. Then I went there at 07.15 pm again, only to being told to come back after 15 minutes as things were not ready yet.. Hence i have deducted .5 points for that..

Coming to the food now, they had around 12 to 15 items spread out.. I being an "Egg"iterian.. had to go on with stuffs which were marked in green. Started with "Sweet Corn soup" which tasted really nice and thick.. although its tasted really sweet..i had to add some pepper to get the taste i wanted..coming to the starters, In veg, there were, Veg Salad, Aloo Fry(Chinese Aloor Dum i found it to be), Vegetable Fry(Mix of Baby Corn and Potato). Aloo Fry was good..not too oily not too spicy which i liked...Vegetable fry had nothing worth mentioning..just the usual...Then I saw some Vegetabe Dimsums which were OK, followed by Mix Veg Konjenaro and another Veg items(which i cant remember)...this was there along side Hakka Noddles and Fried Rice.. So one gets a chance to have both of these, although i prefer rice anyday over noodles when it comes to a Dinner option.. Neverthelesss, these 2 Veg items contained the same vegetables which irritated me..Cabbage and Cauliflower.. they had these baked one in White sauce and the other one in Soya.. 

After tasting these, I was surprised to see the end of Veg items.. Instead Non Veg items were in contrast more..If you are Non Veg, they offer you the same food only chicken added..and one special item on Shrimps...

For Dessert, I got Darsaan soaked in Honey and one chocolate brownie and Mango crunchy cake...which were the best of the whole lot.. Darsaan would have been better, if they had put some more honey on it...but not bad overall..They also give you a complimentary drink (A Glass of Pepsi) :P

Service was pretty laidback..I was offered a paper napkin and a glass of water.. and the person serving me totally forgot to refill..The decor was OK..nothing to add on except for the fact that the songs were not good AT ALL.. coming to dinner and to have a quite evening.. i never expect some Vengaboys number playing loud on top of me..It might also be that the noise was coming from  "Shack" which was just beside this place..

Cost : 381/- AI for a Weekday Dinner Buffet.  :(

A sumptuous spread of dim sums and a simple yet power packed lunch menu, and pocket friendly buffets, the perfect recipe for success. Haka is a must visit. Located at a variety of convenient places, their food can be defined by saying, they know how to make the Indian taste buds happy by modifying Chinese platter accordingly. Everything ended with darsaan, the ' in thing ' when it comes to desserts these days. What a way to spend your money. 

WARNING: This place is only recommended for " Food Loving Warriors " with BIG appetites. Others may find this place unsuitable for themselves.

Haka...a delight for people who wish to binge on Chinese cuisine with pocket-friendly bills...this place has a good red and black theme which is rather badly illuminated...we were on a Sunday night buffet...I am providing just a short list of what I have been offered..Prawn Chips, Chicken Hot & Sour Soup, Kimchee with Cucumber Pickle, Veg Clear Soup, my favourite Veg Salad, Noodles,Chicken Taipei, Chili Chicken, Chicken Dimsum, Fried Wanton, Rice with greenpea, Chicken in Hot Garlic Sauce, Fish in Oyster Sauce, Shrimps, Darsaan, Chocolate Mousse....and many more...at least 20 items to choose from...the food was such a treat to eat , even I didn't got any time to remember the names...now the shortcomings...the place gets really crowded and cramped but that has to be when you are in a buffet....staffs are not very prompt to serve you...they do not come to you...they do not attend you at all until you hijack one of them...if you want good wholesome feel of Chinese food within an economy budget...this is the only place...A STRONG RECOMMENDATION.

Never having tried their dinner buffet, my friends and I popped up here. I always find this is a very informal and relaxing place to eat. Dinner was good, from the chicken coriander soup to the custard. Haka has always maintained their superior quality in the food they serve. For just 333(all inclusive) we had everything from soups, momos, fried chili chicken, noodles, fried rice, even three different types of ice cream! I think for the price they take, this is one the best places to eat. I'm never bored of this place.

Haka , to me is a great place to have a decent lunch buffet with friends. Its easy on your pockets, perfect for us college guys and the food is great. There may not be too many items on the menu but at that price, you shouldn't be asking for anything extravagant.  We used to have lots of treats being given at this place. Although I've been here quite a number of times, I'm never tired of their food. A good place for a decent buffet without having to empty your wallet.

Honestly,Haka is such a popular restaurant more because of the price of the buffet than the food.The quality of the food is only decent.The quality of the individual items on the buffet may vary a great deal.But you will find at least two or three items in the buffet which are quite good.The desserts are nice too.The ambience is also decent.
The buffet spread doesnt offer too many items but at that price you just cant ask for anything more than what they come up with,specially considering the extravagant prices of other buffets.
This place is just perfect for a large college group,for giving treats,when you are concerned about the pocket pinch.

A very ordinary and over hyped restaurant. This place seems to be very popular among college students. During buffet timings, it may also win an award ¬†for being the most crowded restaurant in the city!! I tried their lunch buffet once. The spread was decent. However, I was not very much impressed with their Chinese delicacies. When I ordered for two breezers, the server looked perplexed. Breezers arrived 25 minutes later. The servers were extremely busy as the small place was filled with a massive crowd. Don't expect attentive service here !!

A decent buffet at a very easy price. This is the tag that keeps HAKA going. Don't expect great variety  is choices but whatever they make, they make it good. Their buffet is best for students who don't have the luxury of spending a great deal more for better food. I have visited the HAKA at Mani square a couple of times and have loved their buffet because of the pricing. Definitely recommended as a place serving quality buffet at a reasonable price.

If you want to have good chinese buffet at decent price, Haka is definitely going to be on your list. You get multiple choices of starters (both Veg and Non Veg).

This is a decent place for an informal dinner outing. The buffet spread is well thought out with a good mix and match of vegetarian and non- veg food. The starter are  spread out across different categories. 
Never had lunch here though. Currently, the price of a buffet on a weekday is somewhere at Rs 250. Bar facilities are not available at the Mani Square outlet. 
Quality-wise there is a good standard across the dishes. However, amongst the negatives, chilli-chicken pieces used are not boneless ones! 
While the food quality is of good standard, do not expect it to be as good its premium sister outlet, Mainland China. 
But do try it out . Worth a place and value for money offering.

Staff is good and service is prompt and fast. The buffet spread is well thought out and includes a decent list of items. However, the food is not extraordinary and definitely there are better places in the city to have chinese. The place is a must try for college students looking for a buffet without burning a hole in their pockets. Infact, Haka serves one of the cheapest buffets in the city. The location is another boon considering it is located in the Mani Square Mall. Overall, decent chinese, ideal for hanging out with friends!!!

I have been there a couple of times, and always for the buffet lunch. They have a limited variety of stuff, but everything here has always been above average. It's best to call in and reserve seats as because it's always pretty crowded in there - owing to its location inside the Mani Sqaure Mall. Overall, I would recommend this place only if one needs to have decent lunch while visiting the mall - there are definitely better Chinese eat outs in the city!

Nice place to have chinese buffet but they stick to the same menu for a long time now. 295+tax seems to be justified if compared with other Chinese eateries. They have some nice starters like soup, dim sums wantons followed by fish, chicken, prawn in main course and Darshan with ice cream in desserts only which is a bit let down for the dessert hungry people. Overall I recommend this restaurant for the great Chinese buffet.

Hello Foodies
As a great food lover i have explored many of the buffet restaurants  in kolkata and Haka is the cheapest one (295 inclusv tax).So i have visisted this maximum times. But they have reduced the number of items. Anyway let me just give a brief description abt my last visit with my girlfriend for lunch.
There were few starters unlike my previous visits. the mix veg konjenaro was awesome if u r vegeaterian and chkn wantons for non veg.They also had chilly chicken,satay corn .I missed the chicken salad very much though i loved what they had.The main course was very limited but all were very tasty.Its ought to happen since they have reduced the price.Neway the hotly served 'chicken in hot garlic sauce' was great with ginger and capsicum fried rice.Hakka noodles was also a option but i preferred rice.I also remember the soft and delicate taste of the noodles which tasted from my girlfriend. :P
At last they had also limited desserts item with darsaan and 3 types of ice creams .I had to say that i love eating each and every item of Haka.The last thing i would declare - am going to visit Haka today with my bro for dinner for my BDAY TREAT and hope u guys wont let me down...

Haka is a place to enjoy good (tend to excellent) authentic Chinese food served with skilled hands. The ambiance of the restaurant is too good that you feel comfortable just entering the restaurant and taking a table to dine. Here at Mani Square Haka, the buffet system is very nice and receptive in terms of food quality and prompt customer service. The price is also reasonable and just love the idea of having so many type of Chinese recipes at one place. The only suggestion I would like to share is Haka, Mani Sqaure could offer a few more delicious recipes. Other than this a perfect family restaurant, very enjoyable.

The food is really good. 
They had fish and Chicken  both. 
The starters were very good and crispy and even the veg ones.
The main course we're delicious. Like authentic Chinese.
There's a real Gap in dessert section. 
But you can't expect everything right? 
So it's a desk greater.

One of the best places to go if u are looking for a moderate budget buffet. The food is really good specially the starters. there are plenty of places to sit. unlike other buffets here the waitors do not bring u he food u have to get it urself.The Darsaan  with the chocolate icecream is awesome

Haka was not so great to me as I am a vegetarian, and they dont have much veg fishes..the environment was confusing and nobody guided me on my first visit..After waiting we found that they will not serve starters as it is done in bar be que , so we moved ahead and took our starters ...the good was not hot and it was not tasty too...I will even rank chinese of rosenburg lot more times better than this..there was no gravy o eat with rice or noodles for veg people..the price is ok for non veg , but for veg its too much cz hardly 3 items were edible...on saturday the price was 381 with tax for lunch buffet.

I am really disappointed and embarrassed with the food. Last time I visited Haka, Mani Square about 2 yrs ago, it simply amazed me with good quality Chinese food at a very reasonable price. This time, at around Rs. 400, the food really disappointed me. The fish was too salty and the Chilli Chicken as a starter was too hard to even bite!!! The prawn gravy was too runny and the starters were not upto the mark and bland :( . I was embarrassed because it was I who recommended this place to my friends who came along with me and they were shocked to have such "low quality food" at such a price. The only good things are the ambience, the desserts and the Chicken main course for which I am giving Haka a 2.5, sans which I would have given it a straight 1.

It's a WOW buffet! I would have rated it 5 but the -.5 was because of bone's in the dry chili chicken they served. I don't like any Chinese grub that has bones in them. But except for that, it was great- especially the coconut wanton they served for dessert. The chicken dimsums were soft n melt in your mouth types but the veg domains in hot garlic sauce was more like veg pakora's. The selection of starters were great- new flavors and all but the best was the soup, kimchi, mom0's, soya chicken and DARSAAN! I love DARSAAN WITH CHOCO ICECREAM! I generally don't like buffets because they compromise on quality I feel with quantity but this one- despite being this cheap is quite neat. Drop by if ur very very hungry and you shall walk out- happy!

Being a sucker for Buffet and quantity,i really recommend this place! Nice and clean place, comfortable seating arrangements. A lot of place to sit! 
Their Buffet prices are one of the lowest I have come across and their food matches quite well with that! They have Prawn chips for starters which i can't get enough of. Their fried wantons are really nice too! Vegetarian starters happen to be equally tasty! Not elaborate main course or dessert but whatever they do serve are up to the mark! And most people can't eat so much anyway! So if we are talking low price all-you-can-eat buffet with nice tasting Chinese dishes mostly in chicken and veg i think this is the place you would want to visit! Go Haka!

Heres a the background. I stopped visiting Haka quite a while back. This was basically after some bitter experiences of encountering sharp bone fragments on more than one occasion in certain chicken items. While apologies were made by the staff, I realized little could be done especially when they were selling the buffet and a low price of Rs199 plus tax. I recall having written a fairly bitter review of the restaurant, my experience and some personal advice I gave to Mr. Chatterjee via Zomato. 
However true to his reputation it seems amends have been made and I am all praises for my recent experience at Haka. The increase in cost is worth it. There are now only boneless items as far as the chicken is concerned. The caramel custard, though not typically a dish I'd associate with chinese food was a treat as were the darsaan with vanilla ice cream. I would strongly recommend the buffet. Way to go!

Good, clean interiors with value-for money Chinese cuisine. In fact, the food here is comparable and at times even better than Mainland China and is a lot less expensive than the latter.Been here twice and thrice and the food has never disappointed me. Overall, nice experience and recommended for Chinese cuisine lovers.

If you are searching for the best quality food at the cheapest rate, Hakka is the ideal choice. It's buffet price is quite cheap with respect to the food quality they serve. One of the best iteam in the buffet is the "Chicken Momo". Simply awsome and juicy.
The ambience and the music is very soothing. Just grab it and you'll not repent.. :)

I have visited this restaurant many times. I really love the food here. The ambiance is wonderful. Very tidy. I specially love cashew chicken and caramel custard. Must try for everyone. It is one of my favorite restaurant in Kolkata. The staff is also friendly. The restaurant serves a lot of variety in buffet. There has been hike in the price. But definitely worth the money spent.

This is a place where you get best chineese food without pinching your pocket. They have prepared their buffet package in such a way that you can have fine dining experience with your family and friends.

I have even received wonderful co-operation when we organized our corporate team lunch here.

I would appreciate that they open up more branches in kolkata preferably in Avani mall.

This chinese restaurant with no frill environment is great for groups which is why you get large tables filled with college crowd and families. Be warned noise level tends to get loud.
I have had one dinner and one lunch at Haka so far.During both my visit I had opted for their buffet which was pocket friendly. Last one being Rs.380/-(including taxes).Their array of food starting from Chicken salad, kimchi,hot & sour soup,corn dimsum,egg fried rice,chilli prawn, garlic chilli chicken was delectable but my only complain lies with 2 items - Firstly the Fish in white sauce was full of cornflour and tasted awful, secondly the dry chilli chicken with bone chips was such a disaster.All of us were unable to savour the same and had to discard it.Wat a waste.If money is such a constraint we dont mind spending a bit more for better food.
Among the dessert i loved their date wanton and caramel custard.
Overall experience was nice.

Haka.. It is located at Mani Square Mall in E M Bypass..
If you go to this place, dont expect a fine dining experience. Or lavish interiors. Or amazing service.  This place is best suited for youngsters, a place to treat a big group or a group of friends who hang out every day & want to sip a drink or two with starters and dont want to spend much. The buffet has very very limited vegetarian options - when I had the buffet they had no eggless desserts available. The food and drinks are very cheap when compared to its peers but we are ready to pay a bit more for better food. The quality and portion of food in a la carte is not bad either but the taste is definitely not as good as other Chinese Restaurants like Mainland China. The service is not great and people are really slow but friendly. One and a half stars from me.

If you have a budget constraint yet opt for standard Chinese Lunch/ Dinner there is no better alternative rather than HAKA. I used to visit here once in every month preferably during weekend. Food is not at all rich in preparation but of excellent taste. Ambiance is simple (not overdone) and soothing for family.

With their Low-Priced buffet they seek to attract the younger, quick-meal customers. On the buffet Menu (Weekend Lunch) starters like Crispy Vegetables with Dry Red Chilly, Vegetable Fried Wonton, Chicken Momo and Black Peeper Chicken are offered usually (however they used to change the base sauce and mode of preparation time to time to employ some deviation in taste).  Main course is quite selective with present of delectable items like Burnt Garlic and Corn Fried Rice/ Five-Spiced Fried Rice, Chicken Fried Rice, Hakka Noodles (Veg & Chicken), Chicken in Chilly Oyster Sauce, Fish in Spicy Basil Sauce and Prawn in clear gravy (I can't remember the name). I haven't noticed their vegetable side dish section as I am purely a Non-Veg lover. Shuffling of base sauce is incorporated for main course menu as well.

The meal is accompanied by 2 soups (vegetable and chicken), Crispy Noodles, Prawn Wafers and 2-3 varieties of Salad (don't miss chicken one). Their desert section is not satisfactory, it is concise and I haven't found good Ice-Cream even for a single occasion in subsequent visit. Beverages are available on demand. Try to avoid alcoholic drinks; these are really very costly rather you may settle with Mocktails. Their service is fast and staffs are quite attentive.  They have an √† la carte menu too but it has few takers.

This was my third visit.. and I have to say I am quite dissapointed..

Yes ..it CHEAP,but we are ready to pay a bit more for better food. The food quality is degrading by the day..first of all only non veg starter was available, "Chicken Dimsum", which I liked..but only one starter?

Then for main course there were Prawn Noodles, Egg Fried Rice with Dry Chilli Chicken, another chicken dish (it was full of cornflower nothinh else, and tasted like FEET).. then Shrimp in Mustard Sauce which was not properly cooked. 
The veg dishes were more enjoyable..and the SOUP was good...


For dessert, we had icecream that was not properly stored and melted...so I DID not like the food THIS TIME..

The service was fast..environment is nice, staff is well behaved and trained..the manager got us seated quite fast..over all its OK, but I think they really need to concentrate on food.

A very pocket friendly buffet. They serve everything from soup to dessert, a full course menu. 
The ambiance of this place is good too.
The desserts however are not up to the mark.
I have visited the place 3 times, they repeat almost the same menu.

If u want to have a Chinese buffet at a low price, Haka is the place.

I visited Haka at Mani Sq. twice, once in City Centre too. The decor is ok. I think that they serve cheapest but standard buffet. The price varies weekday to weekend, festive days also. The range of dishes also varies the days. Food is good, wide range of starters and main course dishes are available, both in veg and non-veg. Some of dishes are really awesome. But the desert section weak, also the icecream they served in my last visit is not up to the mark. Except that it is very much satisfactory and price-worthy.

located at the top floor of THE MANI SQUARE Mall, this chinese restaurant do provide some fascinating dishes. the service is fantastic and so is the ambience. One of the prime features of this restaurant, in my opinion, is their buffet. packed with delicious dishes, this buffet just costs Rs.169/- ( V.A.T.) (as on 23-06-2010). the buffet is available on all days though the price varies by about a 100 rupees. the above mentioned price is for lunch buffet between monday-thursday. the items are not at all rich but great to taste. the waiters are also very polite and helpful. HAKA is truly a must-go for all chinese lovers.
