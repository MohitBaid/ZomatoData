This place should definitely be avoided. During the puja and yesterday's experience was worst. Entire family had their stomach upset after having the rolls. This place used to be good for rolls compared to their counterparts in the area. Utter disappointment!

At the onset of midnight when we were craving for kebabs then the soft and delicious reshmi & hariali kebabs of Salaam Namaste were our saviour. The six pieces of kebabs were quite big in size and the sauce and salad added an altogether different feeling. The prices were reasonable enough.

all those looking for rolls - this is the place! the double chicken double egg roll is outstanding. the kababs, the tandoori chicken, and the biryani are to just die for. it is the most dependable joint. i guess the only minus is that their delivery sucks! but, call in , place your order and drop in after 40 minutes to pick it up. it's just perfect!

Salaam Namaste, e name that greets you for a great evening . Located at Deshopriyo Park , opposite the petrol pump, it is a new kid¬† in the block compared to its Legendary neighbors. By¬† its own merit and unique experience , its being able to hold up to its own ground against the heavy weight contenders. A great place to hangout with friends. Colorful ambience ensures that you are going to have a fun tym. Decoration is very youth. Now comes to main business... foods are really mind blowing and standards are pretty high if you compare the price tag. Kebabs ( both chicken & fish) and Lazania (Lasagne) are to die for. Surprising their egg dishes are great which is a rare thing in Kolkata. Hookah is a must try. One small tip keep your eyes open , you never know what kind of surprises you will get there....¬† ;)

The location of the takeaway centre is good, but the food is not at all expected level. Ordered for the basic chinese cuisine like chowmein, fried rice and chilli chicken.  The chicken has bone inside it and the dishes are very vanilla type. One can get better food at lower prices in the roadside eateries.

Parcelled a egg biryani 
Quantity : quite good but that's the only gud thing.
It was not at all gud to taste. Food colour given extra. Not fully due to saffron.
Waiting time : 15-20 mins 
I would never try them again
I.may only go back for the kabaabs and update the reviews.

This place has a lot to offer on a platter but no seating arrangement.  It's a grab-n-go place, or if you happen to stay nearby then you can get home delivery. Food is fresh, tasty and reasonably priced. The mughlai stuff is really oily but on request they can cut down on the oil. From pasta to biryani, noodles to burgers - all kinds of fast food available here.

üëÑüíãSalaam Namaste, Deshapriya Park Is A Small Little Joint With Awesome Food Varieties And With Stunning Soft Drinks. And Now Coming To Food: My Younger Sister Malvika Ordered For Me And Herself And For Our Kalpana Di. From Her Swiggy App I Said To Her That Today Order Something Different From Salaam Namaste. It Was A Great Experience From Salaam Namaste Restaurant. So She Ordered Online 1 Plate Vegetable Fried Rice For Just Rs. 80/- And Chilli Chicken For Just Rs. 145/- It Was Awesome And Delicious But The Chilli Chicken Was Little Spicy. But That's Okay Okay. So I Said To My Sister Malvika That I Have Rs. 200/- In That Manage It. She Said OK Bro. So After That The Bill Amount Came Rs. 225/- So She Paid My 200 Rupees And 25  Rupees From Her Purse. Thanks Malvika And Salaam Namaste For Making Our Day Special.üëºüë≤

Food: Their egg and chicken rolls are very good.
The naan tends to get a bit dry and hard.
Their egg tadka is delicious.
The chicken preparations are good but the paneer main course side dishes are bad.
The paneer was of the synthetic type and it made our stomachs upset.

Expect for the paneer; the other dishes are well made!

I think excessively oily food should be considered a bio-weapon.In all probability,they will lead you to a gory death through an unfruitful life.So no wonder,the collective aversion towards oily food is ever on the rise.Its this oil soaked and oil dipped biryani of salaam namaste that makes its entire oeuvre,a matter of health hazard to many.But moving past that one item,the rest doesn't seem so plaintive or haunting.The chicken roll is has suave skewered poultry with a perfect harmony of sauces and onions much like arsalan's.the lachha parathas go very well with their mutton kasha.Chatpata chicken had the delectable tanginess as the name suggests.So,as long as you're not ordering their biryani,you're all set for a lovely meal.

Easily the best kathi rolls in the area. If you like egg chicken kathi rolls this is the place for you. Its located near the famous Maharani Tea Stall near deshpriya park.

The Staff and place is quite shoddy but the rolls make up for it. I would even dare to say that the rolls are better than the nearby Zeeshan outlet along the same crosswalk.

Looking forward to trying some other items in the near future.

Kolkata is known for its eateries and even the roadside takeaways as Salaam Namaste draw attention of the food connoisseurs... so move over golpark bedwin when it comes to kathi-rolls because your peer here is just as good... the kolkata-biriyanis are fab as well and the mutton chaaps are definitely better than zeeshan DB Park, situated next door... A pity that we do not gets chaaps in hyderabad, but salaam namaste did well to ease the cravings... a word of caution, if you'd like to have chaaps then try to place your of order early as it tends to get over fast....

Salaam Namaste is a takeaway counter which serves Chinese, North Indian, Kebab cuisines along with on-the-go rolls. This place has been on my list for a long time now especially for its rolls and finally the roll was tried.

- Paneer Roll
Succulent cubes of tikka paneer along with sliced onion, ketchup, chilli sauce and a dash of lime rolled in a flaky yet, a greasy paratha. Tasted just about decent.
Had it been non-oily, would have been much better. :)

The service by the friendly server was pretty quick and the prices were quite reasonable.

Overall an average experience.
- Yet to try the remaining fare, comments due. A point reserved for future visits.

In last 2 years, process have jumped , and quality in terms of taste though still very good, has faltered a little bit....... I guess they can improve and should stop raising prices frequently - I remember a Chicken Roll used to cost Rs 13/- some years back when they started, and its Rs 30/- now..... though prices have risen to a great extent in last few years, still I feel keeping them a bit on the lower side will attract more customers ...........................

Located near deshopriyo park crossing just beside Maharani ‚Ä¶Saalam Namaste is one of those places that never disappoints you with Tandoori chicken/chicken bharta (my personal favourites). You can safely put your money on any of their kebabs . I mostly visit them on weekends when there is quite a bit of rush but then I never had to wait long. Prices are more than good . overall an ideal place for the mandatory weekendwala  tandoori treat !

Nice take out near my home.Have been a regular here since it opened.The owner Vinay is a very good guy and once or twice when i told him to improve a few things he was very prompt to do so.

Their Fish kebabs are awesome.One of the few places in Kolkata which serve quality fish at reasonable price.Really love their fish Hariyali Kebab.

The Tandoori Chicken and Tangdi Kebabs are very delicious.The pieces are big and succulent and dont look like being taken from a malnourished Chicken.

They make excellent Murg Mussalam but you need to order the dish atleast 5-6 hours in advance.

The two chefs Ali and Akhtar are very helpful guys who if you ask will make the dish according to your choice(I always ask for less oil and spices)

The Chicken Kathi roll is one of the best in the city and very filling.

Their chinese and Continental food is underrated and are quite good too.They are opening a dine in soon.

overall very good food at reasonable price.

This is the first time i tried Salam namaste. Was expecting a couple of guests at home so diced to pick up some starters on my way . its very easy to locate ... Near Fire n Ice on Sarat Bose Road . When I reached the place I was very happy to see that the in spite of it being an Indian Restaurant, and that too just a take away , the place was neat and clean and the hygiene was being maintained. 

if you have peeped into tandoor kitchens of many stand alone restaurants, you might just get put off with the lack of cleanliness. A big plus for this . 

Coming to the food .. 
I simple adored the hariyali tikka . awesome flavor of coriander and not in your face green. spot on marinade. I would have given 4.5 to them but the tikka was just a little under cooked in one piece . But none the less the taste was brilliant . 

The kathi fry was superb too. soft chicken with lots of onions and chilies cooked in the tandoor and then finished on the tawa. It wasn't too greasy and  just lovely .

The tangdi was simply awesome . Succulent an juicy . The marinade was spot on too ... I hate the over spicy tandoori chicken . 

Another awesome thing about this place is that for people who don't like fried kathi rolls they make a tandoori roti wrap and that is made without a single drop of oil . And they also don't encourage putting ketchup in the roll as well . Signs of people who have faith in their kebab . 

Over all .... a lot more of it will soon be in my tummy .... 

KUDOS ! loved every bit of it .

These guys had an outlet in Lake Gardens bang next to my parents place so we used to do fairly frequent take-away's. Now I visit the Sarat Bose Road outlet from time to time and the food is quite nice. Chicken Bharta , Chicken Reshmi Kebab and the  Dal Tadka ... are my personal choices. Their Chilly Pepper Garlic Chicken was the only item I have sampled from their Chinese Section and I quite liked it. The Egg Chicken Roll is also very good and of late I prefer it to the rolls from the nearby Zeeshan which has gone down in terms of quality.

I am a sucker for the chicken roll they make. The paratha is so perfectly crispy and flaky yet soft that taking a big bite of it does not make the portion go around the mouth in dollops. The best part about the roll is that they avoid stuffing it with the vegetable sauces and curry chicken, and instead gives generous squeezes of lemon juice over chicken tikka. As soon as the hot roll is made and passed on, even if I am not craving a roll at that point, I end up fighting for a bite or two of it with my mother. My mom loves the rolls here and refuses to have it from anywhere else when she craves chicken roll, and my dad complies, everytime. I am basically the passive beneficiary in this case. :P On a few occassions we have tried their tandoori chicken and can safely state that it is much better than the general kinds available at takeaway joints of such a scale. Though it does have the artificial red colour, it also has a certain balance of the spices and tenderness making it a light and pleasant eating. One can blindly choose Salaam Namaste in this area for gorging on rolls over other joints. 

Funny anecdote- This restaurant came up just after the release of the film 'Salaam Namaste' and has kept me wondering ever since about its baptisation. :P

This is basically a takeaway Indian joint which I have been availing from time to time when I am in the area and in a bit of a hurry, or not in the mood to wait in front of Zeeshan for the undersized rolls there. This joint makes a very good chicken kathi roll and the paratha that encases the roll is flaky and very tasty, one of the biggest reasons for me to choose this over Zeeshan which is right beside it. They also make a good chicken bharta which my mother loves, and I like their chicken reshmi butter masala.

Salaam Namaste is opened just near to Zeeshan which is in turn located in the Sarat Bose Road where i recently visited with one of my friend. It deals in Mughlai dishes and is like a kiosk amidst the main road. I had ordered Chicken Biriyani which costed Rupees 130 inclusive tax and Chicken Egg Kathi roll which costs 35 bucks. It was a stomach filling dish for two of us. The biriyani and roll both had a lot of oil and health wise wasn't good but very delicious. 

Coming to the Advantages and Drawbacks of this place:-

Advantages:- 
1) Located at prime location.
2) Serves Mughlai dishes and caters to the locals of Kolkata
3) Prices are kept reasonable in fact very reasonable. 
4) Quantity of food is good and is even delicious. 
5) Service is prompt. 
6) Chicken Egg kathi roll alone is stomach filling.

Drawbacks:-
1) Food even after being outstanding, fails to be the best quality. The biriyani and Egg kathi roll both had a lot of oil. 
2) Nothing as such an ambience or a seating place. 

Suggestions:-
1) Take away is preferred. 
2) Eat when hot. 

Overall, very satisfied. :)

Been a regular at this eatery since its beginning. Love their Kathi Rolls. This joint has been giving good competition to Zeeshan nearby. The Reshmi Kababs are quite good, however Rolls are their main item, and I have never been disappointed.
