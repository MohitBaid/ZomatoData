Fresh ingredients sourced from far off countries... Easy peasy recipe with a step by step guide and voila.. Anyone can be a supachef...

Well i tried the Sphaghetti Puttanesca with Bocconccini cheese... It was yummilicious... The cheese was super chewy and the roma tomatoes heightened the tart component... It all blended perfectly to create the royale delicacy that i devoured to my hearts content.. Waiting to try the other recipes.. Soon!!!

Amazing food , easy to make , easy delivery and good quality . All in all very good experience. A must try for everyone . We ordered the porcini mushroom and the risotto. Both were very good , our family enjoyed eating something that looks out of a restaurant but healthy at the same time .

I'm thankful to Flavourbox for helping me to discover the Chef inside me...
If you can cook maggi, you can cook it too...
They will send you all the ingredients along with the instructions... which you just need to follow step by step... and belive me the end product will come out as a delicious mouthwatering dish...
They are right now serving some asian n Italian dishes...
I ordered for their "Spaghetti puttanesca n bocconcini"... they delivered it in time... and I do the same as per instructions provided by them... ultimately the dish came up so well... both in taste n preparation... just loved it... 
Only cons about the place it the price... it bit on the higher side... although I understand the reason but still it is a place they need to care about... otherwise it was an amazing experience...

Words fall short of describing this delicious culinary journey right from receiving those exquisite gourmet ingredients to preparing it in your own kitchen. The pseudo cook experience makes you relish every bite and the flavours and garnishing provided does complete justice to the name itself . Flavour box is worth trying and inculcating into your diet to break the spell of the typical restaurant food in Kolkata. Dishes worth ordering are the Yaki Udon noodles for the spicy palette, the fettuccini porcini pasta and the watermelon feta pasta . It will surely leave you wanting for more .. !

A friend and I have been wanting to experiment with cooking since quite a while. Having set out to look for "cooking for dummies" and then getting to zomato as usual, I discovered flavour box. They basically send you quality ingredients to cook up a perfect meal and also feel good about cooking :p i ordered the red pesto linguine and it came packed well in a box with easy instructions. It took me 10 min or less to make the dish and i was mighty proud. All ingredients were fresh and the serving was generous. Recommended to anyone who wants to grab a beer and spend a Sunday whipping up a meal with your loved ones!

I am not much of a cook. It's more like I can cook to feed myself. So when I ordered some of Flavour box's gourmet dishes I was looking forward to pleasing my family with my so-called-cooking skills. Truth be told, people looking to impress others with their chefanigans - this is the perfect tool. The dinner I cooked (or more like assembled) not only tasted out of the world but also looked no less than a Michelin star dish... a pat on my back and a bigger pat on flavour box's back (kudos Anushree and ritu aunty)

I heard about Flavourbox through social media and decided to give it a go. 
While I was not expecting much, I was pleasantly surprised. The packaging was great, instructions were clear and complete, and all the ingredients were provided in the box. Of course the ingredients were of excellent quality.
Portions were also substantial.
We really relished cooking our dish at home, and enjoyed our dinner home.

The flavours really make the food pictures come alive. My family and I wanted to go out for a good meal but due to the mismatch of time availability and restaurant preferences, we decided to stay in and enjoy a great meal at home. Flavourbox totally lived up to the gourmet food experience. Thank you flavourbox! :)

I had heard about this place since quite sometime. Their specialty is that they send you all the ingredients and instructions and give you a chance to become a gourmet chef ! 
I ordered the zoodles and spaghetti with bocconcini. The zoodles were really tasty. They had the hotness of chillies and the sourness of lemons. It was Thai flavoured and I absolutely loved it. The zoodles were basically finely shredded zucchini ribbons, resembling noodles. Crushed peanuts added a new texture of crunch to the dish. 
The spaghetti was good too as there was this pungency in the tomato sauce which brought it together. Two slices of baguette were also provided in the box and basil and bocconcini to garnish it with. The bocconcini was really soft and rubbery. 
The presentation of each ingredient was good. Each box was labelled and the ingredients, fresh. The instructions were easy and helpful. All in all a wonderful experience.

First things first I love to cook but don't have the patience for all the prep time. Flavour box is amazing because it lets me bake my cake and enjoy it too without the hassle of weighing abs cutting things. I tried the Thai Zoodle Salad which is a tangy spicy zucchini salad which is so healthy and the Angel hair with white asparagus which the angel themselves would love to take a bite off. Really easy to prepare with a comprehensive recipe. I loved this service and cannot wait to try everything out.

A friend of mine told me about this new concept called Flavour Box in Kolkata. As I'm working during the day I never get the time to make very fancy things for my husband due to the time it takes to prepare and source everything. 
This is why I loved ordering with Flavour Box - I got everything in the exact quantity I needed, so I didn't have to worry about wastage and didn't have to worry about having missed an ingredient or two. 
I felt so cool when the dish turned out yum and I earned a few brownie points with my husband and his friends. 
I'm a new Flavour Box fan and always ordering from here. I recommend this to everyone in town!

Not much of a chef myself but that is what FlavourBox does, transforms everyone effortlessly into top notch chef right in our homes !!

Every kit has all the ingredients perfectly measured and hygienically packed, all we need to do is look at the LET's GET STARTED (instruction) sheet, use our own utensils, cook and eat an absolutely yum food. Nothing can get any easier than this.

FlavourBox is worth every ounce of effort. Homestyle - check! Tasty - check! What more could I want !! A must try i would say !!
