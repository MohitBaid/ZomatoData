They need to clean up the place a bit n also they need to upgrade their lighting. Apart from this the sweets are of good taste n quality. Prices are also very reasonable.

Well, having due regards to the winters, I was planning to pay them a visit, but the pretty mediocre Zomato reviews for this place were deterring me all these days. I nevertheless decided to look beyond those reviews and walked into this mishti outlet based nearby the Ultadanga Railway station, and I am glad, I did so.

From the not so great variety of mishti on offer, the Giant Gurer Shankho impressed me by it’s size and composure! Ignoring all others, I had a single piece of this parcelled – priced at just Rs. 60/-

At home, I gained quite a veneration of the shankho after having unpacked it. It looked such a beauty that initially, I was reluctant to devour it! Nevertheless, the gur craving in me got the better of me and I broke into it and ate a slice – and immediately transitioned to heaven!

This could be 1 of the best shankho I ever had, a big thanks to the Niranjan’s for this experience.

Price and service is fine, but ambience and hygiene is somewhat a concern – since this is more of a medium-end Bengali sweet tooth outlet.

Overall, a big recommendation – try it to believe it!

Niranjan Sweets is an old sweet shop located near Ultadanga station.

Ambience is ok, untidy.

Service is quick.

Sweets are of nice quality with reasonable price , but still nothing to rave about.

A very old local sweet shop in ULTADANGA, just Infront of O P house. A very small sized shop. Takeaway joint.  I am one of the regular visitors here as I often get down at Ultadanga to take a bus for my office. As far as the ambiance is concerned is very ordinary and a single person operated shop. They also serve Radha ballavi, Samosa , dhokla beside traditional Bengali sweets.

An old local store for Bengali sweets. They keep all the usual variety of sweets which is decent in taste and quality wise average. Nothing extra ordinary to mention about them.
