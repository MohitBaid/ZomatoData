A little pocket friendly which has recently sprung up near hindustan more,garia. This is primarily a takeaway joint. I have availed the services of swiggy twice to taste their food. 

Till now i have had the following:-

1. Crispy chicken - Shredded spicy chicken prepared in hot sauce. Generous quantity was given. If you like spicy food,then this is the perfect dish for you. Recommeneded

2. Fish fry - Medium sized crispy fish fry which had a soft flaky fillet. The fish was fresh & was pure i.e. was not coated with too much unnecessary spices. Kasundi provided with it was of poor quality though.

3. Fish 65 dry - 8 pcs of fish cubes in prepared in typical south indian style with kurry patta & other south indian ingredients. Some of pieces had an odd fishy taste to it which indicated it was not too fresh or was not properly cooked.

4. Chicken lollypop - 4 pcs of lollypop which were quite large in size. The lollypop were coated far too much although the chicken portion was also present adequately.

This place offers decent food at pocket friendly prices. Quality of the food varies to some extent so that could be improved upon
