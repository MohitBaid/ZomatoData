The food quality is way too average. The behaviour of the staff is something that annoys me the most that's why I have stopped coming here. Food to price ratio is very high. For average quality of food you have to pay quite a heavy amount which is not at all acceptable.

This place right on dunlop main road has revamped itself since last known. They have brought in major sitting changes and decor changes since last known. Went for a short evening snack. Ordered an egg noodle soup and something called threaded chicken. Each item has a description attached to it on the menu, which is a good thing. The soup was clear, nice with sufficient chicken but not enough for two, it had a poached egg too with a lil less on the noodle
 The threaded chicken was chicken wrapped in a noodle coating, was served with sauces. It was quite tasty. Hospitability and service was mentionable too. Given the crowd on a weekday I was surprised that this place has a low rating. Innovatively paan was served at the end.
However maybe it is due to the quality of food. Not understood then. I had a stomach upset starting the very night of eating.
Given everything this place should move up the rating..

I don't know why this place is reviewed so less.. In my opinion it's a good food joint with some tasty foods and a wholesome tummy won't burn your pocket that much too... only the thing lagging is their service which takes a long time.. (particularly when u r damn hungry it's annoying) 

Happened to visit this small yet well decorated food joint to visit a couple of weeks ago..

Starters :- Had chicken Tandoori which was perfectly cooked.. The pieces were juicy and soft the smoke of Tandoor will always drive u crazy.. This dish was at par with some other mughlai chains.. I personally was satisfied with the dish..

Had two mocktails.. One the blue lagoon which is my favourite.. wherever I get this one I can't resist myself.. and the other was fruit cocktail I guess..

Had mixed Fried rice and chili chicken and Thai chicken too... All the dishes were lipsmacking and the quantity was huge too.. Each item was more than enough for two adults..
 
Overall a great joint to visit.. will be visiting again for their biriyani..üòÖüòÖ

Foods are expensive as per quality they offer. Menu is also quite simple, mostly north indain and chinese dishes. Treid cheese & garlic naan with makhmali butter chicken masala. Average taste. Service was fast.

It is located at Dunlop area, serving mainly North Indian & Chinese  dishes.

Ambience is tidy with sitting arrangements.

Service is swift.

Tried Cheese Naan, chicken butter masala , tandoori chicken & fresh lime soda. 

Naan & butter masala were well made & tasty. 
Tandoori chicken was average.
Lime soda was refreshing.

Pocket pinch is bit high.

Overall a decent place near Dunlop area.

Well this restaurant is quite expensive. The food quality too is average. We had chicken polao,butter chicken and chicken tandoori. The chicken polao was good but the butter chicken was not upto the mark. It had a bland taste. Plus the chickens were not boneless. Well i prefer butter chicken with boneless pieces. The chicken tandoori too wasnt much appetizing. These 3 and my bill was Rs.765. Well I would prefer aminia or arsalan over food village any day.

A reasonably priced, affordable food joint, mostly targeted at ISI students.

Probably because when we went the crowd was less, the service was good. All the dishes we had were very nice. Tandoori Chicken, Naan, Bekti Fish and rice, and finally a Lemon Soda. Everything was pretty good in taste and I don't have much to complain. Maybe one might feel that the taste is not so good for the price. But for me, it was satisfactory.

One of my friends couldn't come to see me at Park Street so I decided to visit him near his place at Dunlop. Though there was a warning that there aren't good enough restaurant to eat (assuming I am a snob being from Delhi). 

We entered to this place food village which probably had multiple restaurants. Not sure really. The staff was old school but courteous. Typical calcutta. The menu was funny: spellings were terribly wrong - so much so that it was comical. I had my apprehensions about the food but that's the thing with such places in Calcutta - they are good with what they should be and that is food. 

We orders pan fried noodles, fried mushrooms, chicken butter masala makhmali (my favourite), butter naan and more. Each of it was better than other. I never had better pan fried noodles I guess (except mcleodganj maybe!) 

The makhmali butter masala was a risk and we were glad we took the risk. It was probably malai kofta gravy with soft boneless chicken pieces. It was heaven melting in your mouth. 

We ended our meal with ice cream of some unique flavours. It was a mixture of tender coconut and the traditional gur.

This used to be the go to place for people staying nearby as there were dearth of good restaurants nearby. I have tried their food both in the restaurant and during few family celebrations which were organised in their banquet. The food they served at the parties were really good. What we ate at the restaurant, though not that good, was still decent. 

The Indian dishes here are better than the Chinese ones. The kebabs used to be really good and tasty. 

Of late their quality have deteriorated to some extent. Hope they successfully bring back the old taste.

Great place, given the fact that it is very much affordable. We ordered Hunan chicken with the non-veg fried rice. There were two of us, and the quantity served was more than enough. The decor is simple and elegant. I'm giving a 4.5 instead of 5 because the service was a bit slow. Would love to return for a second time!

Absolutely horrendous service. These guys kept us waiting for a simple naan+butter chicken for almost an hour. Served the starter after 30 minutes. And after all the wait, the food quality, and quantity was not anywhere near expected. And for all this, they charge quite high. Irritating experience. Would never visit this place again in my life, even if this is the last place left on earth.

It was a disappointing experience. Went with a few friends and were super hungry. The wait time was high and the food that finally arrived were least appealing, both taste wise and quantity wise. Plus the entire menu is pretty much costly. We had ordered different items which included masala dosa, Papri chat, chicken biryani and iced tea. The only thing that was worth the money was the Papri chat. The masala of the dosa was a weird curry and the sambar and coconut chutney were very thin in consistency. The biryani did not have a distinct flavour and was very less in quantity, so was the raita. The iced tea was almost water in normal temperature. It was neither chilled, nor had flavours of lemon or tea. I just don't understand how come a restaurant falter in preparing something as simple as iced tea.

Never coming back again, nor recommending.

Once Food Village was my favourite food destination... As they serves snacks, soup and main courses as well.... But now what I find there is low quality food, specially the materials they use for cooking is not fresh enough to add taste to the dish... However quality going down and price going high so I don't like this place very much...

The presentation is very kind and the serving is very humble and generous..
On a sunny day i visited this place with my friends .. after occupying the seats we odered the food tje service is really quick ..
The starters we ordered were excellent and quantity was sufficient..
We ordered a pulao and a fried rice ,garlic nan with makhmali butter masala and desi murgh..
The items were really delicious and classy.. specially i like like the way of presenting the garnishing of the starters were really good... ..

Once Food Village was my favourite food destination... As they serves snacks, soup and main courses as well.... But now what I find there is low quality food, specially the materials they use for cooking is not fresh enough to add taste to the dish... However quality going down and price going high so I don't like this place very much... 
Visit at your own risk.

This is located in dunlop above the dhake biryani house.. the Resturant is like a regular class Resturant but the ambience is really good also im amazed to see the seat capacity almost 60 peolpes can sit at once .. although they also have one section on the floor above. The presentation is very kind and the serving is very humble and generous..
On a sunny day i visited this place with my friends .. after occupying the seats we odered the food tje service is really quick ..
The starters we ordered were excellent and quantity was sufficient..
We ordered a pulao and a fried rice ,garlic nan with makhmali butter masala and desi murgh..
The items were really delicious and classy.. specially i like like the way of presenting the garnishing of the starters were really good... ..

The 2nd floor restaurant is the first to lay eyes upon when crossing dunlop. The roadside view through a thick glass can surprisingly become rather pleasant without the noise. In fact, the seating arrangement is varied and the place is spacious with a sensible d√©cor. In an attempt to live up to its name, the menu is quite varied. Impeccable waiters. But where food village fails is in its raison d'√™tre - the food. Simple, forgettable and a bit bland.

I just want to give them 5/5 just because of their behavior , loyalty faithfulness.

Their banquet hall is very nice and well decorated and perfect for a little party. We booked their hall with 10000/- INR and selected a menu for our anniversary party. 
Somehow we had a mishap on that same day and we were bound to cancel our party. We communicated with them regarding that and said they will refund that or can adjust with any other thing. 
as we did not have the condition to work out for another party we asked them to refund. They happily refunded our total money and consolidated. :-)

I must say I went their for another party I was happy with arrangements, decor and food. 
If you are arranging some birthday or anniversary or registry then this is the best place. You can enjoy without any headache of your own. 
Besides that their restaurant is also recommended.

A very old restaurant in Baranagar area. Located just before Dunlop bridge, this place serves chinese, north indian and mughlai cuisines. The pocket pinch is on the lower side. The interior is very nice, if you get the window seat you can watch the outside B.T road while having your food. Waitors are ok, no signature dish is known for this place - all the foods are ok type. Prob is, they don't have any dedicated space and the sitting arrangement is not that spacious.

Being close to home this is sort of the go to restaurant for me and my family. I understand that it has drawn a lot of flak in most reviews but since none of that has happened to me it remains one of my favorite places to visit. The price of the food items are quite nominal and the Chinese dishes are definitely more tasty. Also i love the soup they serve here. The only con is the staff. They are rather inexperienced and fail to suggest anything if asked

I have visited this restro 2 months ago with my family (son & wife). Average ambience & hospitality here, but that was not the main thing. AC was not working properly. We feel uncomfortable. Staff was not helpful. When I ask him for that if I had to order 1 or 2 mix fried rice and he told me that 1 mix fried rice will not sufficient. Then we go for 2 mixed fried & 1 chilly chicken, cold drinks. But we have found that it was more than sufficient for us. Either the staff has no experience or he makes us fool. As usual we cannot finish our food & we have to pack the food & that was also chargeable. 

Red Flag for your visit.

Well. The quality of food and hospitality has degraded very much. On my birthday üéÇ I dined at this place but it turned out to be the flop show as the "Salad" which was served had rotten tomatoes in it and the food was not up to the mark ..and the pocket pinch was costly.... So I recommend the readers to search for some other Value for money üíµ Restaurant.

I have been a fan of their 'threaded chicken' and I order this one every time i visit. None of the other dishes are amazing to be honest. The prices here are over-rated i believe. They make you wait long if your order includes chinese.

A very popular restaurant in the area. I am not really sure why. May be because it was very good when it started and the area had a serious lack of good proper restaurants. Presently it is just a celebration of mediocrity. Been there a few times and the food although was served in reasonable time, was generally ordinary. Not too bad, just nothing special. The interior looks a bit underdone but okay. My experience with the service is mixed. A couple of the times they were just indifferent, while the rest of the times they were quite attentive. I would recommend one visit if in the area and don't feel like any place else. Food 3.5/5, Service 3/5, Price 3/5

The food they serve is just average, both quality and quantity wise. Their fish-starters are worth mentioning specifically though.¬†
Both the time we were here, they took a long time to prepare and serve the food, though the behavior of the staffs were good.

This is your average indian-chinese restaurant with a few non-average qualities. Visited on a hot afternoon, and the place was nearly empty. However that ensured us the undivided attention of the waiters. Not in the mood for main course, we asked for the spring roll, but was informed preparing that would take some time. So we went for some crispy chilly baby corn, because that's almost always yummy. The dish was as I expected, nothing over the top, but could have been better with a tad less tomato sauce in it. However in the local restaurants I often had quite horrible variations of the dish, so I'm not complaining. For dessert, I ordered a kulfi. That was a delight. A normal kulfi ice cream served with loads of chocolate sauce, kaju, cherry and waifers. It was so delicious that I gobbled up a second one. Can't find that on the dessert menu anymore though, would be sad if they removed it. Also at the end of our meal, they served a paan for each of us, which was a very sweet touch.

Nice ambience. Nice AC. Nice attendants. 
Nothing else to like about.
Food quality is very poor. Some footpath vendors serve better than this one. Unclean dishes. Cost is unreasonably high!

If you are 2 go and grab the table beside window.I was there around 5.30pm so whatever i wanted to have they were not able to serve even in Refreshment section. So after a long confusion i ordered Fish with Galangal and Dried Fenugreek and the other i ordered was Chicken in pepper sauce. The chicken was not at all tender and quite dry frm inside but i must say that the Fish was awesome to taste. Hope to visit the place another time if possible to have something from main course.

Food quality is good. This is only one decent restaurant in Dunlop area other than ambrosia. Some one must try chicken barbeque which is really tasty and  tendering .though the food quality was good but response of the waiters is really poor.

Its situated in dunlop crossing. It is one of the most visited place in dunlop. Many people gave me a feedback that it's food is no good. Initially i trusted them. But one day i went to this place with my friend because there were no place else to go. At first i was very reluctant to enter, but she told me that place doesn't matter, peoples do.  So finally we got a seat & placed the order. Well to be very frank the position of this restaurant is very good specially the exterior view from inside, & because we were lucky enough to get a seat just near the glass wall. In that night it was raining and it was looking beautiful. After chatting for 25 mins the food arrived. While at a glance the food looked very delicious. The smell accelerated my heartbeat. But i was satisfied when i had the first bite. It was very nice food to have with such a nice people. We ordered soup, Korean rice, thai noodles, lat me kai chicken (thai dish). To be very honest every item was good and very tasteful. And the most significant thing was that it offered a "misti pan" after the meal which is very rare. Our total bill was 650 with tax for 2 people. Overall i really liked this place & i would love to visit this place again.....

I pass by dunlop too frequently. Have seen this restro. But never did pay a visit to this restro. But last saturday after a long bike ride wid a frnd. I finally managed to dash in to the restro. Was away for the whole day. Hungry.. rushed in to the restro. The ambience is quiet good. Nothing too special about the decor. Too much of loud talking is something what I hate in restros. And this was exactly what was happening around me. Irritated.. we ordered for a surprisingly weird combo of starters n mains..started off with a crispy chicken and chicken threaded with noodles. The crispy chicken was great. And the threaded chicken was out of the world. I would definitely go back for this. For the main course we ordered for mutton kasha n lachchha paratha. It was of  usual taste. But honestly..cant get over the chicken threaded with noodles. The taste still lingers in my mouth. Waiting.

The Description: At the Dunlop crossing. Huge building with full transparent glass from the front from where you can see the road view. And the bottom they have Dhaka biriyani for competition. Went there Long ago...¬†

The Ambience: Ambience is good, Very big and clean. Lots of sitting arrangements with table chairs as well as sofa..

The Food: ¬†Food is good overall. Coffee is very nice. Prices are a bit factor..

The Conclusion: Place is very nice but on a bit expensive side. thou affordable.

Note: The review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

Food Village is one of my favourite restaurant in the north kolkata. Being guite near to my residence at Sinthi , I keep on coming back here , specially on the occasions of Mother's day and Father's day. The ambiance , behaviour of staff  and above all , the variety and quality of food is really satisfying and fascinating here ...!..

Absolutely value for money foods serve here. Tandoori items are awesome. The location of the restaurant is very much connective to all the way. Seating arrangement, ambiance, service is good. Take away service should be more fast otherwise a good family restaurant.

Not the best but a bit more than just average.
Food- 4.0
Service- 4.0
Ambiance- 4.0
Pocket friendly- Decent

It is one of the few decent food joints around Dunlop after Ambrosia, and a decent option to visit with fiends or family.
However not all the food items are delicious as same and some of the items might disappoint you (mainly few Veg items) but overall the place is good enough to visit and less to complain.

Situated just at Dunlop More. 1st floor & 3rd floor for dining. 3rd floor mainly for snacks and table size is little short for dinner. Ideal for couple. Ambiance is excellent. Foods are very good. used to visit on regular basis. only issue, takes more time in serving the order.

This one is very near to my house at dunlop placed absolutely beside the main road and a very visible one to the passersby. .I have been there and have loved the ambience and the interior decorations..
We ordered fried rice, chicken hakka chowmein, chili chicken, lat me kai chicken ...and am in love with this preparation of chicken..
The price of food is reasonable and a good place to dine with family and friends ..the management is also very nice and efficient one..would love to visit this place again

A very nice restaurant who serves very tasty food. From sinthi more to dunlop we have only a few standard restaurants, amongst the lot FV stands tall and handsome :P

I like the shredded chicken,crispy baby corn as starters. I am fond of rice thus mixed fried rice is my choice. They provide nicely minced meat pieces in the rice :)
As the side dish u can try lat me kai chicken, its my personal favourite.

Real good food and nice experience for the Barnagar peeps :) Enjoy!

I chose this joint because I was meeting a friend who stays at stone throw away distance and this was all we could come up with.
S and I half heartedly entered Food Village because both of us have been here before and we know exactly how the food was but we decided to give it a try anyway.

Here is a summarized order for the first time in this joint. 
We had ordered :

Chicken sweetcorn soup
Threaded chicken
Kasturi kebab

The chicken sweetcorn soup was strictly decent. I mean of course I have had better but this was fine. It lacked salt. Anyway, passable.
Threaded is the only dish I actually like here. It is really nice. Chicken threaded with noodles is fried and rolled up in a spicy sauce. Tastes good and spicy. I totally like.
In fact, I come here with friends, sit and order only threaded chicken and soft drinks. Its an amazing time killer.
The kasturi kebab was something I was looking forward to.
S and I talked so much that the kebabs had already turned cold. However, kasturi kebab is chicken kebabs enveloped in a huge whitish omelette and served with chutney and papad and a bit of salad. It was again, strictly okay.

Will come back for threaded chicken.
Cheers! :)

What should I say : Disgusted with the ambience, food and the staff!
They act really dumb. The only thing I like here is the shredded chicken starter. Spicy and nice.
Once I managed to order a blue lagoon and all I got was sprite mixed with blue water. How thoughtful of them! : |

Ok the food is kind of decent, considering the fact that you get almost nothing in this area. The only edible items are :
Fried Rice and a few chicken items and yes the shredded chicken (starter)
Do not even try the Chelo Kebab, I made the grave mistake of ordering it and suffered through my dinner. :(
So, avoid this place if you can because its not really worth it.
Ambience is very dull and the place seems really dreary!

Not coming back.

Food Village.....a mirage...in the midst of a desert....is a fairly good restaurant....here in the  northern suburb of Kolkata....delivers good food...and nowadays....good variety....as well...I had Naan, Chicken Butter Masala with Chicken Reshmi Kebab...of which the third one was surprisingly good...their servings are good enough for a proper fill...keeping parity with prices....staff are nice, giving you personal opinion whenever you seek...the last but not the least...the place is spacious...and they have a glass window panel which can give you view of Dunlop crossing from top....the restaurant also have a private banquet hall...but they need improvement on the interior decoration of the restaurant hall...needs overall revamp..keeping everything same, a nice place to dine out....

Worst food you will ever likely to taste. Only good thing is that it is air conditioned. Please let the management look into my ratings. Biriyani is horrible and all the curries taste almost the same. Tandoori chicken is amess in the plate. The noodles are hard. I will never recommend you to go there.
