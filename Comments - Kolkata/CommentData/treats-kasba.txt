I went to Treats along with a friend of mine. The location is good as its just beside the road so no hassle of  searching it.
Its on the first floor of Down Town guest house. 
The lights, the decor, sitting arrangements were really good. 
The staffs also behaved well.
We ordered 2 veg Chinese combo on the first day and next day when we went there we ordered a Non- veg Chinese combo as the quantity of food is fairly good. 1 plate of combo can satisfy two people's hunger (at least that was our case). 
The food was very tasty. The chicken combo was the better than the Veg one but the baby corn from the Veg platter is one of my fave from Treats now.

The only negative thing is : A lot of time was taken to serve the food.

We visited the place for lunch during the Durga Pujas. Normally during this festival it’s very difficult to find space in any restaurant. Pandal hoppers fill up the roads and the other section fills up the eateries. To our surprise we found the place almost empty. We had this mixed noodle, chili chicken, jeera rice and paneer masala. The food was ok. The price is also reasonable. Can be visited again.

Hello Food Lovers,

Just completed my dinner from treats with "Chinese non veg combo" 
Reasons to like:
• very clean 
• good looking 
• serve jaljeera sarbat 
• Good behaviour 

Food 
• quality average 
• quantity satisfied 

Price 
Let's focus on price 
I don't like their price counting method as they serve  average quality food .....

•SVC&KKC ₹1.12
•Service tax 5.6%=₹15
• Vat 14% =40

Overall good experience 

Thanks

My parents wedding anniversary was organised in the banquet hall and it was mandatory for us to choose the food from their kitchen only. At first we were a bit reluctant but on the D- day indeed the food were freshly prepared .
The veggie and the non veggie guests enjoyed all the dishes .
It was less oily and pleasantly satisfying to the taste bud.
I hope they maintain the quality of food in future .

I ordered the fish thali! The food was good! It tasted like bengali food! I think the veg thali wpuld have been better! But the food was not so different we would get in a bengali household i am guessing and the portions of rice that they serve is quite less. U will have to order extra for which they charge extra wgich is again less in quantity! I would have given it a 4 but the portions which they serve there got it down to a 3.5.

The restaurant is only 20 mins. away from my place so always wanted to give it a try. Liked the place, the ambience is decent enough and the food was good too. We orderd Crispy Chicken, Red pepper chicken and mixed fried rice. We had to wait awhile before the food arrived but anyway loved Crispy chicken but Red pepper chicken not so much. One thing I must say is that I was really impressed with the quantity they served and it didn't hurt that much on our pockets too. So all in all, a decent enough experience. :)

This restaurant is a part of the down town guest house, a nicely located little Inn two houses down from mine. As it is owned by my friend's father, I always wanted to sample the food. They hotel services as I have heard are quite good and I expected the same when I went to order my meagre plate of dry chilli chicken. Considering they are a professional hotel, I can understand their refusal to deliver just one parcel of Rs 140 to my home (less than 100 metres away) but the unprecedented rudeness of the receptionist left me mystified! The food was quite average, but the taste was soured by my experience with the staff. Disappointed.

I came across this restaurant couple of times but never went inside to taste the food as the other restaurants in this area - Alibaba. Feast etc are tried and tasted safe bets. But today i had to visit this restaurant for lunch as Alibaba and the other restaurants were closed for some weird reasons.
Anyway when i entered the restaurant it looked decent and clean. As we took the menu card to order I noticed the rates were bit high considering it didn't look like a restaurant worth it, though I hoped that the food might be worth the rates.
But the first disappointment came when we ordered naan and came to know that there weren't any roti section available. Anyway we ordered pan fried noodles in chinese and chapati (which they managed) and murgh massallam. After several repeatations they kept on asking if we wanted the noodles dry or with gravy. Only they know why. They served the food after about 40 minutes.. And then came the disgusting part of it after tasting the food.. It was HORRIBLE. Even a amateur chef can do better than that... It was simply below average considering its exorbitant prices. One word to describe this restaurant is PATHETIC.

Its mainly a restaurant attached with 'Downtown' guest house. I went there in a rainy afternoon and waited till raining stopped completely. In that one and half hour I spend my time mostly on starters. First I tried 'Fresh Lime Water' with 'Veg Pokora'. Fresh lime was average but veg pokora has no taste, even with sauce I could not found it tasty. Then I tried 'Chicken Pokora' and 'Coffee'. Chicken pokora was just another flop item, no taste and no flavors. But I liked the coffee, infact I enjoyed drinking it. Pricing was ok as per quantity but I will never recommend this place.

Both  Chinese and North Indian foods are available here.
The dishes I have taken from here did not appear good enough for me in terms of both quality and quantity.
The rolls they used to provide few days back was good but they have stopped serving rolls now.
I had chicken tandoori there--firstly they took good enough time as they prepared it in front of my eyes. It was a good practice to serve fresh pieces to customer definitely but the taste was not good, the masala was not mixed properly and chicken looked a bit less-cooked, moreover at that price the pieces of chicken legs was really slender, you can have a much better tandoori in the Alibaba just located nearby.
Next I had american chopsey there once--quality was ok, but the shredded chicken pieces were too less. We also had fried rice and some chicken item, 1 plate of rice would not fill your stomach definitely.
One good thing is they dont take extra money from you--the price printed is inclusive of taxes--but just for saving few bucks I would not suggest anyone to have food there unless they do a better job in future.
I would have given just 2.5 but 0.5 will be more for the staffs there, they are polite and dynamic too.

A regular Chinese plus North Indian restaurant located in Kasba. The restaurant is fairly new so I thought to order some Chinese food from here this afternoon.

Food is nothing special and if you ask me, I would say not up to the mark with other nearby restaurants. Lemon Chicken was tasteless with small pieces of shredded chicken. Chicken in Hot Garlic Sauce was also not good and the pieces of chicken was very less. The most frustrating thing is that this restaurant does not have any proper Chinese starters present in their menu so we had to order two main course dishes.

Prices are very cheap but the quantity is not at all sufficient. One plate noodles or fried rice doesn't fill a stomach. Delivery time is very poor as it took almost 1.5 hrs to get the food delivered and the delivery boy was confused about the address and stated that he was not told the full address and only the road's name. Also when he brought the food, the gravy of the hot garlic sauce was leaking and our noodles and fried rice was covered with the gravy.

So, all and all a poor experience from a new restaurant. If you are looking for some real pocket friendly food, then you could give it a try but still I would say avoid.
