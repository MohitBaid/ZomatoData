I am glad to see this place on Zomato! Have stopped by for a quick bite here after shopping in New Market/Shriram Arcade quite a number of times. It's a small food stall with chairs laid in front. Service is mostly swift. Their rolls,be it egg,chicken or egg and chicken,all are filling and tasty. The crunchiness of the paratha is yum. I like their Gravy chowmein a lot. Almost always opt for it,being a fan of gravy chowmein myself. Had tried the chopsuey here also,it was so-so.

Emailed to Zomato to list this ages ago and finally it is listed now.Â 
This is one of the busiest and most crowded fast food hub at the new market. The majority crowd that comes to New Market for shopping opts for fast food and this is one of the place they usually choose to satisfy their taste buds. Just like that i was here for shopping last Durga Puja when i stopped to this place for some quick bites. They have got lot of variety in their menu so we took a Chicken Roll and a veg gravy chowmein. The roll was okayish but the veg gravy chowmien was so filling and tasty. The amount of gravy, vegetables and chow just made the tummy full. One plate is more than enough for a person. Price pinch is pocket friendly and inclusive of taxes.
