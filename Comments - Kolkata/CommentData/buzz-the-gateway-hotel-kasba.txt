Went for a buffet dinner with family I had buffet in many places but this was the worst experience I had the reason they get 1 star is for their service 
First the buffet is over priced and they will give u very little option in starters and main course 
Would have ignored that 2 if the food was good 
Sorry to say but I had a very high expectation 
Everything from pizza to starters were served without salt considering the brand I expected a much better quality and taste but from starter to desert everything was below expectations 
üëéover all a very bad experience

If you want to send some quality time with your family/friend this an ideal destination. If are looking for good food or fine dining avoid this place. This is costly and will never offer you value for money deal. Great location. Fine ambience. That's it.

Located right opposite to Ruby Hospital on the EM Bypass. Hopped in for a quick Sunday lunch.

Ordered - fresh pineapple juice and frilled Kolkata Bhetki which came with boiled veggies tossed in olive oil on a bed of smashed potatoes. Goes without saying that the food was so delicious in terms of its taste and quality.

In terms of ambience and hospitality its again 5 star experience.

Would like to thank their Service manager for the lovely gesture - White forest gateaux that came as a complimentary in the dessert. 

Would like to try their buffet breakfast and Sunday brunch...

Located at Kasba just opposite to Ruby Hospital at EM Bypass, Just like all the other top class restaurants around the city of joy and at the EM Bypass region this is one of them.¬†

The main feature of this very place is this is opened for 24 Hours where you can dine in and have your meal anytime but with the available menu. The ambiance is soothing, looks classy and royal. Huge sitting arrangement with some fine quality food dishes to offer.¬†

Reached their midnight to celebrate a friend's Birthday. After the cake cutting it was all Drinks and food on the table. Though it was midnight so the order was on a small scale.
It was started with three form of drinks

Strawberry Smoothie
Cold Coffee
Ice tea
Hot Chocolate Coffee

Smoothie was a nice one as well as Hot coffee done the things right. Ice tea tasted good but Was disappointed with the Cold Coffee.

Later we shifted to some eateries¬†
Chicken Sandwich
Beef Burger

Chicken Sandwich was very good with the fillings. And i dont eat Beef so no comments on that.

And in the Main course we had a Chicken Gravy (name unknown) most probably Chicken Tikka Masala with Paratha.¬† A very ordinary tasting Chicken dish and the parathas were also little disappointing to me.¬†

It was a Birthday of a special friend so i ignored few things but the service needs to be really fast.

This place has absolutely delicious. I tried the breakfast buffet here as well as had dinner there. The breakfast buffet has an elaborate menu - where you have poached fishes, perfectly cooked crispy bacon and chicken sausages. There is also a waffle counter and my favorite luchi with cholar dal as well as ghughni. They have a number of milk shakes as well as a separate dessert section that has a variety of flavored yogurt as well.

For dinner I absolutely loved the hilsa. Order hilsa fry, doi elish and shorshe elish as it was the hilsa season. They have a portion of rice as well alongwith them. The fishes were cooked to perfection and the doi elish was absolutely finger licking good. 

Would definitely recommend this place.

Very nice buffet breakfast layout. This buffet is not a huge spread but good enough to relish your taste bud. As the serve almost every type of European and American breakfast along with Indian as well. Couple of month back we had a stay at gateway hotel. Rooms are okay not very spacious, but as a budget hotel its okay. The hostess from north east may be was very helpful, courteous and charming.
We definitely come back again...

We were at the hotel for a day or two having our dinner They have a huge buffet spread but since we had arrived quite late at night and were exhausted, so we rather opted for a la carte. 

We ordered Cholar Dal, Mochar Ghonto and Shorshe Ilish Paturi accompanied with Rice and Jhuro Aloo Bhaja (Minced Potato Fries). The dal and fries were alright and the ilish mach preparation was quite good, but the Mochar Ghonto was just terribly bad, it was watery and there were tomatoes in it, one doesn't use tomatoes in this dish! It was nothing like a Bengali preparation. They took almost 30 mins to just serve the dal, fries and the mocha. 

For the next day's breakfast, there was a good buffet spread that we enjoyed. 

Service maybe a bit slow but the staff is friendly. 

Food:- 3.5/5
Service:- 3/5
Ambience:- 3/5

Buzz - the name is appropriate . This place is in the gateway hotel kolkata. Now the only reason for me to visit this place , as it's a very ideal place to meet the people for business. Gateway hotel kolkata is in charge for my engagement ceremony in their banquet... I have shared a very cordial relations with MR Deepak . This is my favourite place, as it's a very cozy and a calm place to hold official meeting and the sip of black coffee , sometimes combined with a ceaser salad just makes it perfect. When ever I visit a new place I would like  to taste the variety, so tasted their hing puri sabji which was just delicious... the smell of hing and the stuffing was just near to perfect. The service was superb... well spoken staff, smiling greeting each time I visited the place .... it was blissful experience. Guys looking for a hideout for calm and cozy official meeting with privacy or meeting up people this is a perfect location ... I am again going to visit this place .... as I have again lined up few meetings in Buzz itself.... the bakery section in buzz can be tried out once.. caution people on diet should not try it ... it does count calories...

We celebrated my 40th birthday at The Buzz in The Taj Gateway. It was their Sunday buffet that we invited our friends and family for. The food was really outstanding, very very unlike most five star hotel buffets, and I have been to a few across brands and cities. The live counters also were great. I loved the appams and the papri chaat. The mutton rogan josh was also outstanding and the stuffed zucchini a novel treat. In spite of all dietary considerations I couldn't resist one Gulab jamun and I was so not disappointed. They gave me a complimentary cake which was delicious and they looked after us like how! Taj service is always good but they really outdid most Tajs I have been to. Personally taking care of the elder members of the family and serving those who couldn't get up again and again. Thanks Buzz! We will surely come again! Saugata Mukherjee

It's very rare to find a place that bags the top marks in all foreseeable departments- food, hospitality, ambience, service, etc. It would be any foodlover's dream to have a fine meal at a place like Buzz. We didn't sample much. The breakfast buffet and dinner buffet were both at an inconvenient time for us.we arrived at around 4, and ordered a virgin bullito,a fungi fritti, araku veg biryani and stir fried tofu. Each of the items were masterpiece in their own rights, crafted and perfected by a chef who definitely believes a lot in customer satisfaction. The drink was a variant of mojito, and had¬† nice mint leaves sprinkled generously. Fungi fritti was perhaps the most amazing of the four, and its buttery goodness of mushroom remains unforgotten to this day. The araku veg biryani is green and spicy with a distinct southern tanginess and is best enjoyed with the delightful raita they serve. Stir fried tofu gives a reason to believe in veg diet, and an inspiration to become vegan.
The staff is very friendly, attentive and ever smiling. I recommend this place highly for all those who are looking forward to a special occasion for dining where nothing should go wrong.

I'm a frequent visitor at Buzz because of the convenient location and also its really a ¬†good place for having long conversations. Nice ambience. Warm and hospitable staff.
I'll recommend the Bengali set meals served here(Apnader Formaiesh and Amish and Niramish Bhuri Bhoj er Poncho Byanjon). ¬†These thalis are good and served well.

Buzz often organize Food Festivals based on either a region or cuisine and also during festivals. One must visit during these food festivals to indulge in some mouth-watering and authentic recipes. You can always depend on the staff for the best suggestions.

Although the buffet spread looks tempting but don't opt for it. It'll disappoint you.

Located on the grounf floor of Gateway. Sittings arrangements are comfortable. Service is no doubt excellent. In the buffet menu, very limited starters were there. Plenty of veg items are there, but non veg items were limited. Fish was awful so was the mutton kasha. Chicken in red wine jus was awesome. Biriyani was average, polao was great. So its a mix of good and average foods. Limited deserts were there.

Try the Creme Caramel Pudding with fresh fruits, it's awesome. For the prices, as it serves you the fine class dining, they makes a steep hole in your pockets too. But still,once when the bonus are credited in your account for the Durga Puja's you can try this out.

Dishes were from various regions and cooked to perfection. ....only suggestion is to have non veg bengali dishes too so that tourists can get complete flavor of Bengal.

Sundays are meant to be lazy. No hurried breakfast, no toiling in the kitchen and certainly no settling for a mediocre meal. Put all those wishes together, and the magic genie grants you a ‚ÄòBrunch‚Äô!¬†
As I looked around, I realized it is impossible to sample the entire brunch spread but readied myself to gorge on a rather long line of tempting looking dishes. The live counters doled out appams, pastas, grilled seafood, chaat, egg benedicts and waffles too. I started the meal with an Egg Benedict ‚Äì the buttery bun, runny egg and the velvety hollandaise on top together were important indeed. Next I tried the appam, made on a small iron wok deftly. The appams, spongy in the middle and paper thin at the edges, served with egg masala and a coconutty vegetable stew, was delightful was undoubtedly one of my favourite dishes of the day.

This is one place that serves excellent food all year round. You don't have to worry about bad food being served during special occasions due to the increased footfall.¬† I have been here on more than one occasion and i absolutely love their smoky seven lentil melange which leaves a creamy sensation in one's mouth due to the prolonged hours of cooking. Another great dish that is a must try is the Dum-ki-biriyani. I personally think they serve one of the best biriyanis in the city. It is light, yet so rich in taste and the aroma of spices is sure to make you want to visit Buzz over and over again. I've also tried out the sumptuous buffet that they spread out during the durga puja. The buffet had been carefully stocked with lip smacking bengali delicacies. The chalkumro paturi that they had in 2013 was amazing and the¬† koraishuti diye bati chorchori in the 2014 buffet was also good. Their service is also satisfactory and they¬† serve complimentary thin crust pizza occasionally. If one is a lover of both local and international cuisine, this is a place which you should visit.

The name of the restaurant didn't inspire much confidence and nor did the buffet spread! What more than made up for the above were the cozy corner in the lounge bar (Swirl)! And don't miss the happy hour - 4 to 8 PM. The starters were excellent and the service was great.
In the restaurant (Buzz) we went for the continental (a la cart) section and the food was indeed par excellence! We followed this up by a dig into their dessert section and they lived up to our expectation.¬†
Overall - excellent ambiance, good service and fabulous food (go a la cart though!)

Lunch outing to celebrate Father's day started with a lot of expectations. The restaurant was mostly empty with the waiting staff not doing anything. Yet there was no one bothered to seat us. We picked up a cosy spot and waiting for a while before we got the menu. The thin crust pizzas were nicely loaded with toppings. The crust perhaps a bit too thin. One pizza was served cold and we had to send it back for reheating. The risotto was disappointing. It wasn't creamy and the rice was cooked too far. The baked corn and asparagus was not any better. It lacked any general taste and the asparagus flavour was lost. We did want to try the ravioli but were told that it had "gone bad" hence was not available. In all it was quite a disappointment specially when it comes from a place bearing the Taj name. Our celebrations were quite dampened with this below average food.

Try the sizzlers at buzz as a part of the "Sizzler Festival " at Taj Gateway. 
There is a variety of sizzlers (vegetarian as well as non-vegetarian ) to tantalize your tastebuds. Curated by Executive Chef Asish Kumar Roy, the Sizzler menu is fusion of flavours from all around the world. 
There is Ham Steak Singapore, Tandoori Rana, Creole spiced grilled fish,  even a kathak ke gelawat.
For dessert you have the special "Bull's Eye", a Sizzler with is chocolate based. This is unique and I strongly recommend this.
It's part of their A-la-carte menu.

My gastronomic experience at buzz has been very pleasant. My mom and I visited here very recently for lunch. The place is spacious, well lit and has a quaint ambience. We ordered the gosht Biriyani, tawa fish masala for main course and tomato soup for starters. The soup tasted delicious and was made solely out of tomato puree and seasoned brilliantly. The tawa fish was Spicy and tangy and perfectly complimented the Biriyani. The mutton was tender and the Biriyani was not sticky at all, it had the perfect balance of flavors. The reception is warm and welcoming and I had a great time there.

My food Blogger's group, Kolkata Food Bloggers, got invitation from The Gateway Hotel for¬† the press lunch to introduce their new menu to "Purbo Banglar Aahar" or neighbouring Bangladeshi Cuisine. On a weekday, me along with my blogger friend, Sayantani has reached at sharp 1, at the Buzz, the restaurant of The Gateway Hotel.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Buzz, located at the lobby level of The Gateway, just beside the reception area, is an all-day diner which offers a perfect cosmopolitan mix of International cuisine - European, Continental, Indian regional and Asian. Since their launch, the Gateway hotel, Kolkata has also focused on an almost unexplored Bangladesh's Heritage Cuisine and has now curated an unforgettable experience with its "Purba Banglar Aahar" - a new menu of old favorites and new flavours. "Purbo Banglar Aahar"/East Bengal Food or Bangladeshi Cuisine which is very similar to Bengali food of Kolkata/West Bengal Food or "Bengali Cuisine" in terms of ingredients and cooking procedures, but still very distinctive in taste. The executive Chef of Buzz, the Gateway Hotel, Chef Asish Roy has traveled to Bangladesh back and forth to bring us such an extraordinary range of authentic dishes from every part of Bangladesh.
¬† The key to the authentic taste comes from freshly ground spices and using the freshest catch of riverine fish and fresh vegetables from local produce.
As we reached there,¬† a table was fully decorated with the newly included dishes and different kinds of fresh fish and vegetables.
Now to the newly added menu .............
In drinks, there are Aam Khejurer Sharbat(a thirst quencher of freshly pureed mango and dates, flavoured with Kagji Lebu/flavoured lime) and Anaras Porar Labang(refreshing drink of charred pineapple and yoghurt)
Appetizer/Starter :
Then in Starter/Appetizer, there are Mochar Chop(crumb fried banana blossom) and Paat Paatar/Shaak Patar Bora(Pressed seasonal leaves fried with gram flour, rice flour & khuskhus) in vegetarian and Poa Bhetkir Beguni(Gram-flour batter fried Baby Bhetki or Basa fish) in Non-Vegetarian items.
Veg dishes - Main Coarse :
Doi Begun(curd filled fried eggplant) : A very traditional dish made with brinjal/eggplant has been given a new look and presented in a very attractive and innovative way.

Gachh Pathar Gelasi (a slow-cooked spicy raw jackfruit preparation): Raw Jack fruit which is in local language known as "vegan Mutton" and also it tastes quite similar to mutton, cooked with the Chef's special spices in a slow-cooking method. No picture is available but the Non-veg. variation with Mutton( an old menu-dish) is below for your reference and it tasted just of this world.
Chanar Paturi : Homemade cottage cheese marinated in spices and wrapped in banana leaves and steamed to perfection.
Non-veg - Main Coarse
Bhapa Chingri : a rich preparation of fresh prawns in mustard gravy.
Dhakai Roast Murgi : It's a roasted chicken, cooked with freshly ground spices and served with Chatu/sattu paratha.

Dessert

Malai Kusum : a yellow colored sweet made with channa or cottage cheese, topped with malai or reduced milk - a very balanced sweet dish which just melts in your mouth as soon as you eat it.

Food Tasting : After, the food display, we were served a huge thali for tasting with more than 10 dishes with their new and old dishes. There were Mochar chop and Poa Bhetkir beguni for starter, where mochar chop was just so so or may be I was very familiar with the taste. But the Poa Bhetkir Beguni need a special mention here, it was just out of this world. It tasted divine. It would a hit among Kolkatans, I'm sure. Then there was Ghono dal or red lentil cooked with spices and reduced to thick consistency, it tasted great too with plain rice. next to the dal, is Chingrir Bharta or minced prawns cooked with spices was just extraordinarily delicious. I'll recommend everyone to try out this dish. And then there was Dhakai Roast Murgi and Mutton Gelasi or a slow-cooked mutton dish, tasted just great, a well-cooked mutton dish coated with just the right amount of spices. Chatur Parota or a layered paratha made with Sattu was just the right thing to mop up all the deliciousness. In dessert, there was Bhaja Pitha, a dessert native to Bangladeshi Cuisine, was just melt-in-the-mouth. Last not the least, Malai Kusum marked an unforgettable taste to my mouth.
These dishes are mostly available in a-la-carte with some combination of dishes and a vegetarian and non-vegetarian set meals are also available. Average cost for two to dine is Rs. 2000.

I am writing this review after a few visits and to start with i must say that the management has done a commendable job with this restaurant.  Located on the ground floor of the Taj Gateway Hotel right at the busy crossing of Ruby General Hospital, this particular place is quite big in terms of area and quite plush in terms of decor. The furniture's are quite simple but gels smoothly with the decor thus creating a very fine dining ambiance. I particularly admire the wall with the mirror and pores design. Exquisitely classy. 

I was here the day they opened their doors and i must say i miss the grand buffet they had at that period of time. They only serve the regular buffet now which is quite good in terms of options and cuisines. The Bangladeshi cuisine is their specialty and i would recommend everyone to try some of the items when they visit. Chinese items are really tasty and i would particular recommend their Dry Chilli Chicken which has a subtle old school Chilli Chicken flavour to it. Coming to the Indian Cuisine, Mutton Roganjosh is something that i order and i find it very spicy and a perfect dish to be had with Roti/Rice. Biriyani Lovers will enjoy the biriyani they cook. Last but not the least they serve some awesome thin crust pizza. The toppings are on the weaker side but in general it is very crunchy and tasty. The Bakery is quite disappointing to be honest. I found the Cheese Cake very very ordinary.

Service is one thing they should look into. I feel they are lacking manpower and hence during rush hours and weekends the existing people gets really stressed as they have to attend multiple guests. Otherwise the staff is extremely courteous and well behaved. I particularly enjoy the warmth they show towards their guests. 

Overall if you are in a mood to shell out some extra cash since this is a costly place, do give this place a try. Hopefully you won't be disappointed.

We bought coupon from nearbuy for dinner buffet for 899. It was a huge spread of food and obviously a lot of dessert. Obviously like all other buffet the food is not something out of the world but there was a huge spread of food, surprisingly there was basic Bengali food like daal, paanch mishala, etc.. The ambiance of the place was superb and also the service was superb. I will definitly recommend this place for a nice evening with family and friends.

Haven't heard much about the food of this place, finalised and canceled my plans to visit this place several times.
One day was craving for good dessert, all places closed down late night, landed up here.
And amazed as I was, dessert that night couldn't be better.

We ordered for:
Traditional Tiramisu- Served in a Martini glass, can you visualise Tiramisu in this form!!
Fresh Soft Creamy, with the right amount of coffee and chocolate. Though I have had better ones, but this was tough competition. 
Warm Chocolate Mudpie- in the shape of a muffin, served upside down along with vanilla ice cream. Being warm was the kicking factor and then the chocolate oozed out on the first bite, melting my heart.

Location:
Located near Ruby Hotel, easy to reach and fuss free. They obviously do provide valet.

Service:
On arrival we were given the option to choose where to seat, we got comfortable in one of the section, there was jus a couple in the entire place. 
The staff helped Us with our order, we specially mentioned that it should be real good and they took care of itüòä. 
Our desserts arrived after a little wait, which was worth it.

Ambience:
Peaceful, beautiful interiors, facing the glass walls. Soft music, late night with my Hubby. What more could I ask.

Pocket Pinch: 
Totally worth for the food, service and ambience they provide!!

Visiting soon for food this time üëåüèª

This one is based on my experience ¬†while back. It was a late night dinner with my wife. Be careful before going and a few of the items on the menu become unavailable after a certain time.

We called for Pasta, I called for some form of steak (do not remember the name) and were given a complimentary helping of bread. Food was good but the low score is because the chefs and stewards were fighting in the kitchen. We could hear all the abusives being exchanged and also complained the person attending us about it. But he could not do anything and it went on through the length of our dinner. If prices are fine dining, then a customer does not pay the same only for good food but also for service and ambience which was a major let downer!!

If you're looking for a perfect fine dining buffet with a really large menu, this is it. We had this dinner buffet which started from live made noodles and pasta. Then the main course consisted mainly of Indian dishes which ranged from fish, chicken, mutton and loads of vegetables. Everyone had something or the other for their likes. The table at the Centre of the buffet consisted of the desert. Two different types of moose, sweets, cakes and so many other things. And the big glass windows overlooking the Ruby crossing add up to everything.

We came here with family on 1st January. It was oddly empty for 1st Jan. The person attending us was very well behaved and served us with a smile. The food was great! We started with the amazing wild mushroom cappuccino (soup) and fungi fritti. Next we ordered pesto pasta, fungi risotto and asparagus and mushroom fine herbs. All of them were really really good. The flavours were finely balanced and the texture is perfect. The best was the dessert. The chef, Druv Rathore got us a warm kugelhpoff with strawberries instead of the said mango and passion fruit clot because mango and passion fruit would not go with the weather- winters. It was brilliant!

On a hungry and lazy Sunday afternoon I simply stumbled upon the place. The ambience is wanting for the touch of an interior designer, it's simply bereft of any worthwhile thing to talk about. But I do agree the tables have ample aisle place and you are not party to the loud conversation of the adjacent table.

The food: I have ordered for the buffet. The layout is simply marvelous what with Indian, some continental and some Chinese. Some of the dishes are really well done - awadhi chicken, baked fish, grilled prawns & squids (optimally cooked). Am happy it's a buffet with alcohol included, Jacobs Creek is available which is going well with the grilled stuff.

The place is optimally crowded with genteel cried with nose reduced to a minimum.¬†The waiters are well trained and safely located without being intrusive. Additionally, there's live singing which is really enriching my experience. The crooner knows her stuff, the sound not too loud, just enough for you to enjoy.

So far a good experience and definitely worth a visit.

So the story goes somewhat like this:
"Once upon a time there was again a multi cuisine restaurant in 5 star hotel which was rated high in food circles and it lured me into celebrating an occasion by spending a evening there." - This the happy part.
Now let us enter the dragon - "nobody cares to hold the door for you nor asking you what are you looking for. Just get in, find a table which suits you and make yourself comfortable. Now we selected the buffet option and other than a thin crust pizza, it is disappointment written all over the place. Service seems to be taken care of by disoriented and grumpy staff, food is pretty ordinary if nothing less, desserts like the Bengali ones had turned bad but nobody cared to check, I don't know....I am so disappointed that I am just getting pissed off writing this review and recollecting my experience. A place which should be avoided till the management gets a wake up call.

I stayed at Taj Gateway during my official trip. I had the chicken biryani for dinner which was full of flavour. They served it with a chicken gravy because I like my biryani with gravy. The peppermint iced tea was bland but tasted better once a little honey was added. I was surprised with complimentary desserts and loved the orange cheesecake.¬†
The breakfast buffet had everything I look forward to- bacon, chicken sausages, watermelon juice and South indian options. I also loved how the desserts were tiny- you can get a taste without too many calories.
Looking forward to my next visit.

Have been here thrice. Loved the buffet they had to offer. Worth the price! 
Huge variety and great hospitality, we keep going here with family.
Recently went for the ilish festival and loved the fare yet again.

Although it's a bit late, but this place I visited on my birthday in 2013, with 4 of my friends. It's a nice place in one of the busiest intersections of the city, in front of Ruby Hospital.

The decor is pretty sleek and modern. And the staff are friendly. Quickly they arranged a table for 5 of us to sit, right in the middle of the place. We ordered Paneer ke Sulle for starters, which was amazing. Spicy cottage cheese, roasted with a few vegies. Really good. For the main course we had a beef steak, lamb medallions, rissoto and chicken pizzaola. And for desserts we had chocolate milkshake and something else whose name i can not recollect... All in all a pleasant experience..

Loved my morning breakfast here with  calm and quite sorrounding and rihanna playing in the background. The gateway hotel is the second branch of taj located at kasba , Ruby. I ordered belgian waffles and tea . My sister ordered sunny side up. Sunny side was made perfectly and came with bacon and brown bread. Waffles were crunchy outside and soft inside and i likes then with cream. With waffles came small sliced fruits (apples mostly) and honey. Loved the food here. In their breakfast section they have south indian too. I would come back here soon to try their main courses.

Intersting to find a special Bangladesh-i menu at a "star" hotel restaurant. Probably indicating a large clientele of Bangladeshi tourists to Calcutta. Otherwise, like any other regular coffee-shop of a good hotel. Friendly service - tho at times a bit slack.

Gateway was in my bucket list for long and last saturday i managed to tick it off my list. It had a simple yet classy look about it. Coming to the food part - i loved it. The delectable Chicken sandwiches and a hot cappuccino made my evening. And yes kudos to the staff members.
Having said that, i found some flaws too. 1) It doesn't have a private zone. So, love birds don't opt for this. 
2) After 8 pm you will get to hear loud music coming from swirls bar next to it. Well, this is taj right?  So, where is the sound padding?
3) The picture like windows do make a statement but i seriously had a hard time sitting next to it, with streams of light from outside flooding in. 
4) Last but not the least buzz should make it a point to play soft music in the background to add flavour to the ambience.

Tried this place last night...after Taj Bengal had really high expectations from this one and it surpassed them to be true!! Food was great..had them at Buzz. We had indian food i.e biriyani and a few items of chicken and it was overtly delicious..The ambience of the place was probably better than Taj Bengal itself..thoroughly enjoyed every minute of the dinner!!

We tried this place out yesterday. The ambience is perfect for a lovely evening getaway with the family. One would think that food quality in any hotel may not be worth the money they pay but they would be gladly mistaken in this case. The food was tasty and the portion size is not too bad. The personalised care of the staff members just makes it an experience worth remembering

I came to Buzz for lunch and I've got to say that the food was extremely good. The staff were very courteous and there was a very good ambience. The buffet spread was very lavish and had a wide range of food including continental, Indian, Italian as well as Mongolian including a huge spread of mouth watering desserts. Very good value for money!A must visit place!

We decided to try this restaurant for breakfast as we had been hearing much about it ever since we arrived in Kolkata. I must say, it did live up to it's standards. From the moment we walked in we were greeted with pleasant smiles and exceptional attention. There wasn't a moment where I had to look for a service staff to ask for anything. They somehow knew when I wanted either my plate to be changed or a drink to be provided. 
The buffet spread was fantastic with ample array of continental, and Indian items. Additionally their pancakes and waffles were decadent! I would go back just for the waffles any day. 
All in all a great place for a lavish lazy breakfast.

This hotel near the Ruby Hospital is trust me one of the cheapest 5 star joint in Kolkata. The food served is good enough. The buffet has a wide selection starting from the salads to the desserts. Though we didnt have ala carter but the look from other tables serves us right. Definitly a try out for foodies.

Ambiance: Meets the standards of a star hotel
Service staff: Hospitable and welcoming
Food: Easily the worst tasted food served at a Star/non-star category hotel. It does by the way improve your patience level by serving food after 45 mins of waiting anxiously for the sight of food.¬† I at least expected them to make up for it with quality food, but it fails to even live up to basic expectations. There should be quality assessment on a regular basis to keep a check of its meteoric fall in the standards of food served. An utter disappointment to say the least. I would have rated it below 1, if the option existed.
PS: Try the cuisine/buffet at your own risk and only when no other option seem to be available. 
Cheers

The food was really not up to the mark. Both the veg and the non-veg section failed to impress me in terms¬† of taste. Given the price that they charge, as customers, we do deserve much better. The ambiance was good and the service-crew were polite and courteous. The band playing in the adjacent room was loud and skillful in their art.

Overall a bad experience. I shall not recommend this place for food.

The restaurant decor was really nice with a great ambiance. The staff are quick and courteous. I asked the ingredients for 3-4 items and the chefs provided answers to all my questions. For the taste, I would say this can be much better. There were several items which I thought were flat and could taste much better. For example, the taste of the mutton was pretty bland. Few of the dishes were nice and tasty. I liked the Mongolian dish best which was made from noodles and vegetables which were saute in sauce. Desserts were really good.¬† At Rs 1100, the choices and spread is really extensive. With it's awesome location and large spread, this is a very good option.

A nice restaurant just inside taj gateway. Good variety food of different cuisines available and the ambience is also descent, the pricing of the food is okay and you can go for a cup of coffee or lunch too, the staff was very well mannered and very active and quick food delivery. I really liked the place and the music was perfect giving a good feel. Overall a descent place.

I n my wife walked in last night to have a light meal at about 12 am midnight. After going through the menu we just ordered for a cold coffee and a banana smoothie. FIRSTLY the order came in relatively late...and secondly the drink was sour. Upon asking the waiter, he came in and promptly changed the drink...but alas..the second drink was not perfect too. But we just quietly had it and paid n came back. So not met expectations at all. Paying just for d sake of a brandname doesnt help anymore. It was my first time in d hotel and experience in terms of food quality is mediocre....

Ohhh such a lovely place it is where I visited so many times for having Dinner including Liquor as well.¬†
So I want to share my views in this regard.
Every time I use to get very good behaviour from all staffs over there.
Special thanks to my friend Chef Mr. Swarnendu Mukherjee who as of now provided me different dishes like Preparation of Prawn, Chicken, Fish, Mutton, Varieties Ice-cream, Biryani ¬†& few more delicious items.
Bar Section is very good & romantic.
Food Quality, Ambience, Service bla bla everything just awesome.
We people use to spend huge money here & there for different issues. So I suggest you to have food here at GATEWAY once at least though its costly.¬†
you will enjoy I believe.

I had been there with my parents post Durga Puja..Service is good but I am giving 3.5 as food was good, but a little less than excellent.The starters were good, but would be nice if you have a non veg soup also in the buffet. Also the fish was a little weird. It was a small fish (bele or something like that). Pasa or bhetki would have been better. A mock tail in this price is expected.¬† Rest all is good. The interiors and service is good..

This review is only about the Deli -the 24 hour shoppe in the Gateway. I have been to the cake shop there and the cakes are really inexpensive and tasty. The prices would really compete against any normal pastry shop and the quality is something extraordinary. The reddish white creamy pastry, the black forest, choclate meringue are really light and a gastronomical delight. A must visit for cake lovers.

Went there for a Sunday Brunch as a couple. The brunch spread seemed alright on the first impression. As we started out, we realised certain elements missing on the buffet which I think is a must for a hotel of this standard. These were cold cuts, cut fruits and cheese platter.

The buffet had lots of variety for chicken and me being a fan of anything  non-veg but chicken, was a little disappointed. Anyways, starting with the quality and taste of food:

Paya Soup - Was just average. I have had much better paya soup before.

Salads - Variety was quite less and not 1 of the salads impressed me. In fact I could not eat one of it coz it seemed stale and was smelly.

Starters - Weirdly starters were not segregated and was kept along with the buffet on main course. Only Chicken Tangri Kebab and Paneer Tikka was for starters and both of it was COLD!!

Main Course - High on variety, low on quality and taste. Peas pulao and steamed rice was kept seperately with dal makhani. Again, Dal was not nice. I myself have made much better Dal than that (I am not boasting!!). Steamed fish with lemon butter sauce had no sauce at all and was cold again. Tasted more but overall the food is really low on taste.

Live Counter - Pasta, Mongolian, Grilled fish/squid/prawn were all average. Nothing that impressed me yet. They had Appam Live counter too and I ordered for Appam with egg curry. Appam was thick and no crisy at all. This is not how Appam is supposed to be. BUT I do have to give credit to Egg Curry, the only dish in the whole buffet I actually liked!! I know.. I know.. Its just egg curry which probably every Tom, Dick & Harry can make at home but I stick by my words. I enjoyed NOTHING more in the buffet except the EGG CURRY. When I say this, am not sure if this is a point to be happy for The Gateway Hotel or a point of concern that they could come up with only 1 dish which was actually nice (Appam was not good though!!). They had Pizza Live counter too but I got to know about it when I was done with my meal so did not try it.

Desserts - Gr8 variety again. I tried cupcake, coconut macaroons, assorted chocolates, macaroon. Nothing great to cherish about any. But I was pretty disappointed with macaroons. I bit a part of it and the whole macaroon fell apart in my hand and on the plate. Pretty Sad..

Drinks part - Brunch included unlimited beer and they were serving Heineken. We ordered for it but after the 2nd glass, they witched to Kingfisher!! Am not sure why but I did not bother to complain.

Anyways after we were done, nobody and I mean NOBODY asked for a feedback. Being a new hotel, i think this is a must!! Anyways, we just paid n off we went. Not returning back again..

Located at the busiest crossing of Ruby Hospital, The Gateway created little curiousness in me. Buzz was in my wishlist since few months so thought to utilize my Groupon vouchers.On a Saturday evening the restaurant was quiet empty on such a busy locality. Interior was sober and minimal. There is no issue with privacy too for those romantic dinners. Anyways we opted for their buffet spread which tempted us visually. Started with salads were bland and only had good presentation but taste was horrendous. Moved to starters like Dahi ke Kebab and Murg Lasuni Tikka. Veg kebab was good but Murg Lasuni Tikka was very poor, it was though and cold. Driest Papri chat I ever had over here without any traces of dahi or chutney.¬†In main course fish, chicken and lamb preparation was average and had no special touch which is expected from such restaurants. Nothing to mention about veg main course too.In sheer frustration we thought to venture their kitchen counter where you can ask for think crust pizza and pasta. No points in guessing pizza was like hard tandoori roti with chicken, onion and capsicum as topping. Only thing we liked was Fusili pasta with chicken alfredo sauce. At least this helped me not to stay hungry before going bed.

In desserts they had mousse and gateaux and Indian delicacies like misti doi and maalpuah. Mousse was nice however gateaux was mediocre. Misti doi turned sour but maalpuah was again worth a little mention.¬†Finally never every try their homemade ice-creams which will completely spoil you taste-bud's knowledge about vanilla, chocolate or strawberry flavor.Staff needs more training. They are not aware what is Zomato which I came to know when they asked me my reasons for taking picture of food.

On the design part they need to install proper frosted glass window in the restaurant as harsh light from vehicles entering the hotel can hit your eyes badly. They have live music performance in the next Swirl bar where there is lack of decent sound padding to stop the noise coming inside the restaurant. Overall, such food quality is the last thing one can expect from Taj Group of Hotels. Needs a lot of improvisation to stay competitive in such market.

Buzz has been on the wishlist for a long time, and finally we did manage to visit here for a special occasion. The Gateway has various hotels, in which Buzz is right near the entrance from Ruby Bypass road. No complaints about ambiance and service, they're just right. Tables are situated at a fistance from each other, ensuring your privacy. The decor is simple and minimalist, making you feel relaxed. Choice of music, excellent.

As for food, we ordered Risotto, Murg Pulao, Khasi ki Gelassi (at least that is what I remember of the name. :P) , and jumbo Prawns. (yeah we were a variety of people who liked different things!) The Pulao tasted right with the homemade feel of sweet, cashews and raisins and other spices. Only one chick accompanies the whole big hundi though. The mutton dish was nothing less than awesome. All those flavors, all those spices brewed for exactly the right time, the marination and the time allowed for the meat to stew..that was one hell of a mutton I have ever had. Too good! The Risotto was however unnecessarily loaded with tasteless white sauce, and slightly tended towards bland. One gray spot. But forgivable, compared to the goodness of the rest.

We got a cake celebrating the occasion, 15 years of friendship, and was the cake Heavenly! I got myself high on chocolate, literally! The light brownie base, the mousse interstitial fillings, the chocolate layers kissing both..oh my God!! Beyond words.. Would definitely like to come back and taste the other desserts available on the menu..I heard their Tiramisu is amazing!

Never go for buffet in Gateway Hotel in EM Bypass. The food is really bad and very little choice.. The Pizza and Pasta is a shame and would say.. please stop giving something that you don't know how to make.. I have tried sigree.. please send your chef over to Sigree in EM bypass and he will teach him some of the tips on how to make good food.. You service is too bad.....Shame on Taj.. Please shut down your hotel here or send some better people to manage this..

Went for project team dinner on 8th August'2014. Opt for dinner buffet,which was below expectation. The welcome drinks was awfully bad. Only one tandoor item i.e. Chicken tandoori. Mutton Roganjosh was below par. In dessert Gulab Jamun did had its original tasre. There was no custard. 

Good point are the location, parking facility, excellent embience, internal decoration showcasing Kolkata's culture and heritage, excellent reception area, spacious sitting arrangement within the restaurant.

I visited on 6th July with my family for a dinner buffet at the Buzz. By seeing the reviews of the past  i thought I should give a try. There is hardly anything good to say about my 1.5 hour experience. As we entered and took our seats, our server was not very well versed with the options of drinks available for us. He kept running around and asked his seniors for the drinks available. We ordered some untoxicated drinks. It took almost 20 mins to arrive on the table. At 9pm the buffet had no snacks. We were waiting for a long time for the food to get replenished. In the meantime I asked the second server for a Margarita Pizza, it was almost 30mins and my pizza was nowhere to be seen. I asked my server about the pizza and he had no clue that it was ordered. He came upto us in next 2 mins and said the order was misplaced and the pizza was given to an another table. This is was pure mis communication among both servers who were looking after the table. I ordered a pasta right away and asked him to make it quick and serve before the pizza. While we ate the Chicken Tikka available for the starters, as soon as I cut into the chicken i saw the chicken was pink from inside and it was not cooked properly. I thought maybe it was just one piece of chicken which was undercooked, I was shocked to see that all the pieces were in same condition. We had enough of it and our hunger was almost gone. We were waiting for the pizza and pasta to come. I called upon the server and asked him why was the service so slow and what was wrong with their team, he didn't really have any answers to it but just told me that they were full on staffing. The server's name was Arnab. Though he was kind enough to keep asking us if we would like to eat anything else from the buffet, but hardly was there anything worth eating. In the meantime the pizza and pasta both arrived at the same time. The pizza was nothing great. I have had far better pizzas. There was hardly any chicken garnish on the pizza. The pasta was good. We all liked it. Probably the only thing we had liked it by then. 
Then we planned to hit towards the main course. In which I had Grilled Chicken, Paturi Maach, Mutton Rezala, Dal Makhnj and ordered a Garlic Naan on the side. The grilled chicken was not upto the mark it was very bland. Paturi maach was tasty well cooked fish. Though i had started eating, the Garlic Naan had not yet arrived. As soon as the Garlic Naan arrived my mom just noticed that the Naan was undercooked. That was when we thought we had enough of it. And we called upon the Chef. Chef Anirban Banerjee came outside and apologised for the service and the food. But i feel an apology couldn't just change our mood at that time. We were quite disappointed, though he gave us a fresh batch of the naan, none of us were in a mood to eat it but tried one piece of the naan. The difference could be clearly visible. Now the naan was very crisp and well cooked. The desserts were ok nothing too great, though I didn't really feel I was eating in a star hotel. But i think the evening was already way too spoilt and didn't prefer complaining.  Though my experience was not at all good the teams really needs to buck up.

Went here the first day i was in kolkata and we were really hungry.. as this is next to my place we ended up here.  
Being a vegetarian. The choices were less but the quality of the food and taste was on par with the prices they charge. The ambience is wide and open nd relaxed. The service is prompt. The dal is a must try , its taste is even better than some authentic punjabi restaurants i hv tried. All in all satisfactory experience. Its clean. Its spacious. Its comfortable.

Was more than eager to visit Buzz especially after coming across a snippet on the Telegraph about the Nabo Barsho buffet spread. 

But what waited for us was such a below-average experience that I am willing to name it one of the disastrous family lunches ever.  After going through other reviews where patrons had had a wonderful time, you'd wonder whats with all the badmouthing in this particular review. 

* The Buffet Spread : The Baishakhi Shorba - a veg soup which tasted like nothing. It was similar to drinking herbal water with a dash of salt and pepper.  Plain rice, Pulao and Osmani Dal- all three of them in a single, partioned serving bowl. The Pulao was prepared with this typical cheap kinda rice - it reminded me of my college days when we used to have "Frid Rice" (as pronounced by the canteenwallah) at Rs. 25 a plate. The Osmani Dal had this dhaba-ish kinda look - didn't have the heart to try it. Next, it was "Phool and Paatar Bora". (Phool as in -->Kumrophool ). I don't know what exactly happened - one of the Paatar Boras came across REALLY chewy which got me curious. Guess what, the consistency was almost like LEATHER! I couldn't muster enough courage to take it out of my mouth and inspect it, am a non vegetarian anyway so didn't I mustn't bother, I thought. The Dahi Echor, Paneer Tandoori and Mankochu Malaikari was strictly passable. But by the time I was eating the "Topshe Fry" , my anger had risen significantly. Why would you coat them in batter if you can't remove the bones? And more importantly, why go for such a zero sized fish to begin with ? There was a minced fish kinda dish and some chicken preparations which were the only saving grace. The sweetmeats weren't also the 4-star kinda stuff. 

On top of that, the a/c wasn't working properly. The staff weren't courteous enough. The place is freaking big and walking a mile with a piled plate doesn't appeal to any normal person - we were denied a closer seat to the buffet as those were already "reserved". On top of that, the food tasted like a 2-star hotel. And they were going to charge Rs. 1200 + tax for each plate. 

What I could have done was to work my way with vengeance, i.e. pile up on chicken and dessert . 
But I did nothing apart from writing this review.  Buzz the restaurant SUCKS big time.. I wouldn't write anything positive even if they treat me to a complementary dinner. This is just one of those ridiculously overpriced joints with COLD, COLD hospitality (barring the behavior of the security guards at the main gate!) and REAL BAD FOOD.I am not sure enough about the A La Carte stuff though .. maybe they need to work a LOT on their buffet spread. But anyway, after you market yourself as such a hip and happening joint with people waxing eloquent all over about how GRrrreat the food is over there.. this is just INEXCUSABLE.

I was really eager to visit Buzz and finally went there on the evening of my birthday with my fiance! Here is my impression of this beautiful place below:

Ambiance: Calm, Sophisticated and Private ! The tables are placed at quite a distance from one another and it ensures privacy. The best thing about this place is that it is not at all crowded and the soothing atmosphere really makes one feel at home! 

Service : The staffs are courteous, gentle and welcoming ! It surely feels that they are trained in a proper manner to welcome the guests and they are doing their work in the best possible manner. Kudos to them !

Food : As we had no intention of having dinner and as we were there during the evening time, we had ordered 2 cups of coffees, 1 Delhite Sandwich, and my birthday cake came after we finished these off ! The coffee was strong and truly refreshing. Along with it, there was complimentary home made cookies were better than any cookie available in the market ! I am not a cookie fan but I gulped down 3 at Buzz ! The sandwich tasted yumm and the chicken filling was sufficient. The Potato finger fries were crispy and tasty and the mustard chutney tasted equally great ! The cake was a surprise for me and it was a mocha flavored one and I loved it to the core. It was creamy, soft and delightful !  (I am looking forward to try out more dishes here soon!)

Price : A bit on the costlier side but once you visit Buzz, you will feel that the amount you would pay at last is worth it ! 

I wanted to give it a 5/5 but as I have tasted only a few delicacies of Buzz, I have kept the 0.5 along with me now. Would love to add this up after my next visit there ! :)

We had the weekday lunch buffet and everything except the sweets and fish fry was tasteless. For a hotel that had recently opened shop we were quite surprised to find the tomato soup watery, the dry mixed vegetable cooked in Bengali style tasteless, the fresh lime soda was without lime, the chicken curry was barely ok. Overall it was an very ordinary experience. Never mind five star hotel, this was below par for a cheap roadside joint.

The best thing about Buzz is that its bright lights and ample space inside the restaurant warms up the cockles as you enter through the large, clear glass doors. The decor inside is minimalistic and tables are spread apart from one another creating an impression of space that makes you want to sit down and relax. Relaxation, for those Calcuttans who want to while away time, is guaranteed because of the glass walls that provide a view of the crowded Ruby crossing approach. Calcutta is known for its slow, start-stop traffic that ambles on without bothering to keep pace with time. Those unfamiliar to the ways of kolkata may find the view a little out-of-sync because of the dirty looking, age-old  buses and the rickety, archaic Ambassador Taxis.

Once inside we have the staff, young boys, taking charge and again we were made to feel at home by the warm smiles and friendly attitude. 

The best part of the experience is the food, which was excellent in terms of taste, decoration and accompaniments. The chicken and garlic soup that we had ordered was creamy and subtle in taste and the assorted bread basket that came with it had a wonderful dip as an accompaniment, the taste of which blended well with the taste of the soup. The chicken kebab cooked with Goanese spices and coriander leaves came with a curd and garlic dip that wwas again wonderful to taste. When the dish was served, i noticed an Indian paapad baked in the form of a "katori", which housed the salad. This was unique and I had never seen such a thing before!

The best however was reserved for the sandwich, a tuna and egg sandwich that came accompanied with finger fries and--yes, a tomato and "kasundi" dip that was out of the world. The local "mustard sauce" had been given such a unique flavour by mixing it with tomato sauce that it made me feel like exclaim my appreciation with a loud "WOOOWWW"! 

Meal over, i ordered a cup of black Darjeeling tea, which was probably the only let-down of the whole evening because the quantity was just enough for a single cup when my heart wanted to have a little more! The quantity is one aspect maybe where the managers need to see how they can match people's expectations because whatever we had ordered out of the ala-carte section seemed a trifle inadequate!

Nevertheless, my first visit was definitely delightful and i look forward to visiting there again someday!

Had a great buffet breakfast here as well. And the Ham and Eggs Platter @ Rs250 /= is a steal . If your a breakfast person do give it a try. The Bengali and South Indian Varieties they served were also really good. Service is excellent and its a lovely place to relax and chill out.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I have been wanting to try out Buzz since it opened up and finally did a few days back. I had a great time .... d√©cor is simple and modern with very comfortable seating and double height ceilings and large picture windows which I really liked. The food we had was excellent. I ordered the tenderloin burger and my friend ordered Risotto Fungi along with a mock-tail called Rail Splitter. While we waited we were sent a complementary bread basket which was excellent and complementary Asparagus Soup which was a lovely touch in this weather and the soup was very nice. Our main course followed promptly and I absolutely loved my Tenderloin Burger , perfectly cooked and super tasty . My friend said her Risotto was excellent as well and we had a super meal. The Rail Splitter was excellent lovely fresh flavours of Pineapple and Apple Juice with a hint of Cinnamon... Spot on ! We ended our meal with a very beautifully presented and flavoured Orange Panacotta. The Panacotta was slightly more dense more like a mousse else it was a perfect meal. Loved the coasters which had a delightful picture of our very own Victoria Memorial ... thought that was a nice touch. Service was superb and I can fast see this place becoming a favourite with me.

Happy New Year all! :)

Dancing away to glory till 4 am in the morning left my friends and me pretty hungry and we needed to stop all the buzzing before making our way back home. The best option near Kalikapur at that point of the dawn had to be the Buzz, Gateway Hotel.
As expected, the ambience was extremely pleasing and made us feel at ease instantly. We literally dropped in the chairs expecting quality service and food. Firstly, the menu card was handed over in no time but we had to literally plead for drinking water. Huh! Which place does not serve water at the first go, and especially a restaurant of this stature? Nevertheless, we were ready to overlook this when at least three to four waiters had to be called for taking down our orders. They were least interested, and most importantly, the place is under-staffed and the ones there are quite inefficient. After quite a bit of them ignoring us, we were fortunate enough to place our orders - roast chicken burger, tenderloin burger, chicken biryani, one black coffee and two capuccinos.

The burgers were decent. I expected the beef patty to be thick, meaty and juicy, but it was just about average. The fries and chilli mustard sauce accompanying the burger were nice though. The biryani was strictly okay, not bad but nothing great either. My black coffee was strong, had a nice aroma and served its purpose and friends enjoyed their capuccinos too. Given the ambience and our high spirits, we had a lovely time. The menu is priced pretty decently too and thus didn't leave us poor for the rest of the day.

But, but, this is a part of the Taj Gateway where anyone will expect quality and efficient service with great food. Where was that? The management definitely needs to look into this soon.

We had gone to meet friends who were staying at the hotel. Had a snacky dinner one evening. I believe this is the only food outlet at this budget Taj property. The place is reasonably done, not luxurious. The service isn't perhaps of the regular Taj standards, but makes up by being friendly and helpful.

I started with a mocha caramel (or something similarly named) shake. Nothing to write home about. Very ordinary I thought.

My daughter had ordered chicken nuggets with fries. The nuggets were well done... crispy.

My wife and friends had ordered the Kolkata Chicken Egg roll and the Mutton Tunde roll. y first issue with them were the thick lachha parathas they came wrapped in. Too much paratha. I am not too fond of the lachha version anyway. Would any day prefer the thinner lighter ones.  They tasted reasonably nice and consisted of a rather large roll cut into two. Enough of a meal almost. Came served with some chopped salad like thing served in a papad basket!

I had asked for a Grilled Fish Gondhoraj. Sounded interesting. Nice fresh fish (would have prefered a tad more of it) served with Gondhoraj, but hardly much flavour of it in the fish itself. Perhaps I needed to have squeezed some more on. It was accompanied by with a spicy mashed potato that did not impress me at all. My daughter loved the fish.

We ended with dessert. Tried the house icecreams. Very disappointing. We had the masala tea as well as the paan flavoured ones. While the others preferred the masala tea flavour, it didn't go down well with me, and I found the paan flavoured one slightly more palatable. Best to avoid them both! Naturelle (or is it Naturals) on Russel street makes a 100 times better paan flavoured icecream.

Pros:
Convenient location
Excellent quality of food and service

Cons:
This pertains to my personal problem, which should be a common problem with those from other cultures (this is a hotel after all), young and old ones : that is TOO MUCH CHILI. This has infiltrated into foreign foods too, like a chilie'd onion garnish on a pesto dish, some chili garnishes on salads, etc.. How did such mass infiltration make its way in? I have complained many times, but to no avail, as far as the buffet is concerned. Although there is very good communication for a la carte items, about adjusting level of chili. 
The foreign foods selection is also high on chili, like chili chicken, thai dishes, etc.. I think the chef/menu manager is the exact opposite of me, that is, he selectively picks those items that are very hot and spicy.

Very less choice of non spicy items. But quality of food, no complaints.
