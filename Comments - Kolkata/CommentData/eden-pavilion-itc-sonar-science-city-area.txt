Ambiance and service is really good but food is ok. The menu was also not properly organised. It should have been placed just in front of the item but it was kept haphazardly which confused us. The no of food items was quite high. Taste wise, I didn't find it that good. 
I loved the ambiance, it has been very nicely decorated with flowers, there are artificial ponds with orange colored fishes, whom you can feed as well.

We tried the lunch buffet last week priced at approximately Rs 1980 all inclusive , vast spread from salads , maincourse and desserts . Our top picks were Pork ribs , ghosht korma , sorshe chingri , rabri and toffee pudding. The pizza was served late while we were having desserts and the staff were kind enough to get that packed, however it was below par . Full marks on hospitality. the maincourse mainly had indian options from mughlai and bengali , incorporating some more items from continental cuisine would be appreciable.

My friend took me there for a treat. We opted for the buffet. Must say the ambience is superb.
Now coming to the buffet, the star attraction is their authentic Bengali dishes.
For starters we were served hot piping chicken and paneer kebabs which were soft enough to melt in our mouth. They were really really tasty. Moving on to the salads there were plenty, out of those I had some with prawns, octopus etc whose name I didn't remember.
Coming to the main course they had a veg and a non veg biriyani , different veg and non veg dishes. Out of which I tried only the non veg ones.
The chicken biriyani was okayish, the kosha mangsho is superb again with the right amount spices and mutton cooked to perfection. The soft meat again melted in my mouth. Next I moved on to fish curry which was superb too and then there were other dishes also.
Coming to the desserts we had  rosomalai, cheesecakes, hot chocolate cake and a lot more. Desserts were excellent and were the best in the buffet.

This is one of the luxurious buffets in one of the luxurious hotels in Calcutta. It also consists of non-buffet arrangement, but I preferred the buffet. 
In the buffet, at the very beginning you'll be given endless number of kebabs, as long as you can eat. Then I went straight for the main course. The biryani was just amazing. The best biryani in a five star hotel in Calcutta. The chicken, mutton and fish side dishes were equally delicious. 
A must try for everyone. üçΩÔ∏è

** Location = ITC Sonar Kolkata, Haldane Avenue(EM Bye Pass).

**Brief = The rain God poured on Ashtami morning and after performing my Anjali on the auspicious day, the rats in my stomach started knocking and I felt like The Eden Pavilion serving some authentic Bengali dishes would only be able to satiate my hunger and I called up Miss Banerjee and we were off to the place in a flash.

** Ambiance = The ambiance of ITC Sonar always attracts me and they had a beautiful portrait of Durga Ma and her family members. Also the gentle lady was so kind to offer us a table as soon as we reached there although the place was bit full. The servers were as usual at their best dressed in lovely Bengali way and top notch hospitality.

** Things tried = We opted for the buffet lunch and they had several authentic bengali dishes in the buffet.
From starters to main course everything was delightful, the luchi & kosha mangsho is a special mention. The Chingri Machh(Prawns), Mutton and Chicken dishes were too good and I loved their Biriyani as well.
Each and every item was prepared with extreme perfection and I was enthralled with the experience.¬†

** Purse Check = Our Bill was total around Rs.4720/- for 2 person.

**Overall = I had been to Eden Pavilion on a number of occassions before but it was my first visit during Durga Puja and it was indeed worth the visit. Cheers to team ITC.

Extremely poor service! Everything tasty and sumptuous which was on offer was negated by the shoddy standards of service. The attendants had an elitist air to their demenour and it reflected in the way they were picking up tables to serve. There was an inordinate delay in everything that was requested from our table, whereas on a neighboring table there was more than 1 attendants everytime!

Overall very disappointed and not upto the mark you would expect from an ITC brand name!

It was Nabami when my partner decided to give me a surprise. I was overwhelmed after getting to know about the plan. When we entered the place our car was received by the valet and we were welcomed in. The beautiful portrait of Durga and the lights of the surrounding were a treat to the eyes. We were showed our way to Eden Pavilion after we clicked several photos near the portrait.
We were welcomed in after our reservation was checked. The ambience was totally 'Bangaleeana' and one could easily understand the importance of Durga Puja in Kolkata.
We were shown our table and the starters of Topse fry and mochar chop were served on the table. I started with salads, pasta, sauced egg, ham, chicken, turkey salami and prawn cocktail. The dishes were good enough to mesmerize a non foodie as well. I then started tasting the main course with Manchurian soup, fried rice, Singaporean noodles, pork curry mushroom in Lebanese style and salads.
Then came the time for the Bengali dishes. I tasted the polao, sorse chingri, mutton kasa and ghoogni chat. I am not much of a mughlai dish fan so I did eat the biryani. But I tasted from my partner's plate. The dishes were all well prepared. Just the rice of the polao was a bit over cooked, which could be easily ignored. We ordered for fresh lime and I can say this confidently that it was the best fresh lime I tasted till date.
The desserts were equally tasty as it had too many options for chocolates. Being a chocolate fan I almost over filled my stomach. The only problem we faced was while paying the bill. Our card wasn't working or was it the fault of the machine, the reason is still unknown. We were delayed for more than 15 minutes. But we ignored that because the staff was too well behaved to be accused of anything. The experience was an amazing one.

Good starters, average main course, good desserts, and extremely, extremely, and I can't stress this enough, EXTREMELY slow service. I understand that the service can be slow during the pujas, but, when I am paying a premium, I expect slightly better service than any other restaurants in the city that charges quarter of the price including taxes. The waiting time was disturbing in spite of empty tables right in front of our eyes. Then, the ordeal of waiting for starters, and all the other food. Oh, in case I forgot to mention, we were having buffet! We had to wait for 30 minutes to get a refill of the gosht biriyani. Then they took away the desserts just because it was 11:45 pm!! I would choose J. W. Marriott any freaking day.
2nd visit: The Lawn
A complete turnaround of my opinion. Highly impressed with each and every aspect. The services were quick, the food was awesome, and the ambience was amazing.

Was here for dinner on Friday night and was disappointed. The buffet was mostly Bengali food so we opted for a la carte.¬†
We got a side of bacon, egg Benedict with smoked salmon and fish and chips. We got 2 fresh lime sodas as well.¬†
The bacon was undercooked but when it was made crispy it tasted great. The egg benedict didn't come with any sour cream so was dry and there was hardly any salmon. The fish and chips was listed under continental and yet made in a bengali way. When we pay 1000 bucks for fish and chips we atleast expect it to be authentic.¬†
The service was lax and we had to ask twice for everything.¬†
Won't be back.

Went there yesterday with my parents.  Tried the dinner buffet. Ambience of the place is no doubt amazing and serene. However the main course dishes weren't upto  my expectations. The lamb was overcooked and some dishes lacked proper seasoning as well. However the desserts were fabulous and made up for the main course. Pocket pinch is high. The bill was around 7k for 3 people.

Went here post some meetings for a slightly late lunch buffet. The variety on the buffet was good and the salad and cheese counters were well stocked.¬†

The main course was slightly limited with only Indian and I felt that was slightly restrictive, the dessert counter was absolutely fabulous and had great variety and amazing tastes. I've heard a lot about the Sunday buffet here and hope to visit it someday.¬†

I happen to visit this place during the IPL so had the pleasure of seeing almost 90% of the KKR team which will definitely add some extra points to my review. The outlet looks like a typical coffee shop in a 5 star hotel with very simple and soothing to the eyes decor and no jazziness at all which makes it very much homely. We had gone for dinner so the spread of menu was a little more compare to the lunch buffet. The menu had a spread of north Indian, continental, oriental and even Bengali cuisine. They serve pasta and breads as live counter preparation. I loved the main course specially the biryani and the fish preparation. They have a wide spread of desert in offering and that makes the buffet more fascinating. The service personnel will make you very much comfortable and they are prompt in attending the table and service too. The only negative point would be the starters as I had expected much more variety in that. For all the desert lovers this place would woo you like anything.

We had Chicken katsu burger, chicken Caesar salad, club sandwich and Rich, smoky, creamy Baba Ganoush and soft drinks!
The Caesar salad was exceptional.
The atmosphere was pleasing and some exceptional service made the day more satisfying!

The Sunday brunch is my favourite and it's definitely worth the money!

ITC Sonar is one of the most popular name among luxury hotels in Kolkata. Therefore it needs no introduction at all. Eden Pavilion inside ITC provides a great outdoor buffet & offers various international cuisines. 

The ambience of this place is extremely decent for corporate party to date with your special one. Lawn flanked by calm ponds with lily pads touches the heart. Ambiance over here only can be felt in real not by words.

Their service is excellent just as expected. You can ask for any dish made of anything you are ever desired & there is a high chance they will not deny it. Yes its really true. Live buffet spread accross the lawn was very nicely presented.

For all of this & as per the standards the charges were also high. But for the pricing quality of food could have been little better in buffet menu. Still all together this place makes an unforgottable experience & definitely lived upto its reputation.

Our anniversary dinner at Eden Pavilion was the best I ever had; the food, the ambience, the surprise of it all made it an unforgettable experience. 
I was mesmerized from the time I stepped foot on the property, and Eden Pavilion surely lived up to its reputation. The buffet spread has a variety of cuisines, from Indian to Italian, and each of it is worth a try. 
For snacks, I took Papri Chat and Dahi Bhalla - the serving is in little portions, so that you don't get full on one and can give the others a try. The breads left me spoilt for choice. 
Also, the salad counter provides ingredients like red cabbage, lettuce, cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, and many dressings to make salads of your own choice.
I loved the Chicken with veggies (though I don't recall the exact name of the dish) besides Chicken Salami, it was well-cooked. However, I decided to give Metiaburuj Biriyani with Raita, and Kosha Mangsho a skip, I had other dishes to explore, but by the look on his face, I knew he sure enjoyed it. 
There is also a good number of purely vegetarian dishes offered, and the Baked Vegetable Tetrazzini was quite delicious. 
I had my fill with desserts - the Raabri (with no added sugars) was impeccable, the Rasmalai, the Tarts, the Creams just sealed it for me.
I must say besides the classy, perfect ambience, the service is topnotch. They also served us a complimentary Chocolate for our special day. Altogether, it was an amazing night. Eden Pavilion is definitely on the top of my recommendation list.

Yesterday went to Eden pavilion for our anniversary dinner ,when we booked the table they asked us that do you have any special occasion that day? We said yes we will be celebrating our anniversary there. Then they told ok,that's great we will serve you an anniversary cake to make your anniversary special.. but no cake was served by the restaurant. So in a way it made our anniversary dinner bad..
And have to say this also after having food from different 5 star hotels,this hotel serves less variety of food compared to the other restaurants of 5star hotel.

Paneer Makhani and Dal Bukhara were deliciously awesome...
I'am not a fan of typical punjabi sabzi, but this paneer makhani was the best sabzi i ever had in my life. It was subttle and tasty...very tasty...
Paneer just melted in my mouth...
And DAL BUKHARA, its one of their signature dishes and it was sooo yummy.. I ate it all by itself... These 2 dishes are highly recommended...

Visited this place a few days back, for breakfast, the service of this place is super slow. It took them more than 1-1.5 hrs to actually give me a dish. The dish ordered was also served wrong and the manager was reluctant in nor looking into ala carte orders, he was concerned with buffets. Usually ITC has great food and service, Peshawari, nutmeg all are good but for this one a big thumbs down.

It was a fine winter Saturday afternoon that I got an invitation to join in the lunch for the new menu launch at the Eden Pavilion, ITC Sonar, Kolkata. I had pictured some really fancy and equally delicious plates of food well before the eat marathon started‚Ä¶and why not it was ITC afterall! However, as I sat at the table in the eclectic company of my co-diners it was something beyond just luxury. Chef Vijay Malhotra and his team talked us through the entire menu explaining all the whys and hows. Handpicked assortment of flavours, textures and plain deliciousness highlighting the beauty of local produces, indian superfoods and grains of goodness is what we were served.
                                                                ...

The definition of luxury dining...the restaurant and its standards are impeccable. Delve into some awesome delicacies for buffet. Mouth watering prawn, chicken, lamb and other items are on offer if you are a meat person. You can also go for the variety of salads and other starter dishes if you are a gourmet. The dessert dishes are equally excellent. If you wish to drink, you can choose from a wide assortment of options. To top it all, you will get some of the most amiable waiters here, always ready to serve with a sweet smile. Overall, it was a fantastic appearance and definitely I would like to visit this place again.

Ambience and feel is very rich... And ofcourse the foods are over priced as it is located in ITC... Good for lunch or dinner if you want a place to have heavy and healthy meal in ITC

My "the " place in ITC Sonar.

Eden Pavilions remains the heart of ITC Sonar's culinary performance and loaded with innovation, delivery at its best and great service and ethical standards from the best in class ladies and gentlemen.

Eden Pavilion is in itself a 24 hour coffee shop where you get the morning breakfast and dinner or lunch as buffet.

The morning breakfast is diverse and one of the best in the country.

Dinner buffet is my personal favourite. I have never been able to complete the lunch buffet , because the breakfast in itself is so full filling, I had hardly felt like continuing with a lunch.

The club kachori in morning breakfast, chinese soup desk and biryani and chinese in the dinner buffet is awesome. Sometimes they serve south indian authentic dishes in the dinner buffet which is awesome.

The delight in this restaurant is also the Ala Carte Menu and Tom Yum Goong  is my favourite from
the Chinese kitchen.

Lamb chops are simply a delight and a must try with family and friends.

One great thing about the Chefs and the senior managers is that they have always delivered whatbhas been asked by the guest , and even onve Hot Rice with Daal and Posto at 2 am for a big band of my guests.

I keep coming back here and can never ever forget the people who make this place great.

Winter barbecues are generally good fun. Piping hot tandoor-made snacks taste better while shivering on a lawn flanked by calm ponds with lily pads, lulled by a quartet of violins and cello. And as you widen your mouth to bite into a kebab you may even experience a slight crunch from the unlucky mosquito that departed from the swarm hovering around the lawn. Such is the infestation plaguing ITC's outdoor winter dining. Perhaps the food was tasty? I can't recall. Too busy swatting away attacking squads of mosquitoes. All I took away from my dining experience were 10 itchy splotches.

For breakfast, ordered room service.

Kept us simple -- Egg Benedict and Fresh orange juice! I have eaten Egg Benedict at many places, but this was simply divine. Poached to perfection, with a chicken salami, this was quite amazing. So, if you are a fan of Egg Benedict, you must try it here. Room service by Kunal was courteous and efficient.

A great way to start your morning!

Life is all about balance; isn‚Äôt it; well I don‚Äôt know about others but we the food bloggers and influencers based out of Kolkata tried to balance our appetite and capability of trending a hashtag, #TrendingatPavilion, a few days back at the Eden Pavilion, at the ITC Sonar. Sounds interesting, isn‚Äôt it? It was nice wintery afternoon and that too on weekend, and the group of people who were invited at the ITC are quite well-accustomed with each other.¬† We found the bloggers‚Äô and Influencers‚Äô meet was a bit different from what we generally attend, as we were briefed about the initiative by ITC all through the country where all the Pavilion across the country has modulated their menu and re-launched the same at the same time in presence of the bloggers and influencers. The menu, as informed by the Executive Chef and his team was varying with city to city keeping in mind the regional palate. We found the entire plan of trending the hashtag fun and as I told earlier balanced our appetite for the specially crafted new menu at the Eden Pavilion ITC Sonar with the hashtag!

1.0 less just because it is a bit overpriced for the taste of food. I have given 4.0 just because its open 24 hours. I went there at 2:00 am , just to find jackie shroff sitting next table with his son and daughter, so yes its a good place if you wanna avoid clumsy people , ill mannered waiters, unhygienic food and time slot entries .Ambience was really very nice. Still i would suggest you can go there atleast once. I may visit again too.

Me and my family went here today for dinner and we had a really great time overall. We had winter buffet barbecue and the starters were amazing. We liked the smoke hilsha, chicken sausage was very properly cooked and well seasoned over all. I had some issues with the cold salad, specifically the cold fish was not fresh and the cauliflower is not a great choice for cold dish anyway. Coming into main course, the goat biriyani was excellent, well paired by chicken and paneer dishes. Dinner was complete with a sumptuous choice of desserts, especially rasgolla and sandesh were excellent.

Couple of tips for improvement
1. Service felt a bit slow, although many servers were present.
2. The lady in front was a bit shaky and felt to me is not doing her job. She asked us if we paid when we were leaving, which is very unprofessional. Although I didn't complain but I could have and she could have lost her job for it.
3. Mosquito problem is really an issue, when you deal with barbecue in a dark place, so should have been properly taken care of.

Irrespective of few downsides, food is well priced and the buffet is a great choice to go for, if you are looking for a great friend or family dinner in the heart of kolkata.

Well it was Durga Pujo and it was Nabami afternoon. It had to be Bangali khabar. For a long time Eden Pavilion was in my cards. Eating here was one of the wisest decision I have ever made.

The staffs are courteous. And when I say they are courteous I dont mean they are ¬†nagging and annoyingly happy seeing you, like the way any other five star hotel staffs do. The Eden Pavilion guys lets you be, enjoy your space and privacy...and most importantly your food.

The spread is nice. Good food. But the mind boggling part was the dessert spread. It just made my day.
We were celebrating our 3rd anniversary and even though focusing on her leaving aside the kosha mangsho was difficult, I managed it somehow.¬†

But the restaurant stays as special as her ;)

Another visit? Hell Yes!
Cost for 2: Exactly as it is mentioned in Zomato.

I loved the buffet during durga puja here. And the ambience too. The biriyani was great. And it had so less oil, i was overjoyed to see that.

If you are out for Late night dinner or Early morning Breakfast this the best place to hang out, i was there on saptami early morning at 4 in the morning with my hubby after south kolkata pandal hopping!!! 
Itc hospitality is so warm the durga murti & flower decoration added the festive charm in the decor. We ordered penne Ala napilotano & traditional american breakfast. The portions were good, the bacons were juicy & tasty. The pasta had a tangy taste of fresh tomato puree & the mozzarella cheese was just yummy.. And what should i say about the ambience, its a great place to sit with family & loved ones & have a quality time. Guys do try it for a late romantic dinner

I went there with my Bff on the day Durga- ashthami,they were welcoming,the food was light and fresh,not oily good for health conscious people but I won't say they lived upto my expectations as on thay auspicious day I would expect something more authentic,which I couldn't find,as it was a buffet so no worry about quantity,the taste was good,but not Wow!! 
It's a pretty hotel,i would expect them to upgrade the foods taste being a five star property!!!

I went with my family for a dinner during the puja. A buffet was already on and we joined instantly. The buffet had both Bengali and oriental delicacies. The Bengali foods tasted really well and the Biryani was worth a mention. As usual we get to enjoy the tastiest dessert in ITC hotels. So were the classic bengali sweets.

This place was in my list since a long time. Finally went there yesterday with my family. We were there in the evening time so ordered coffee and some snacks. Due to the rating and it being in the ITC sonar Bangla  I was expecting a decent quality to be found in the food. I was mistaken big time because the food was non edible. We had ordered one cappuccino, hot chocolate, one chicken pizza, one double chocolate shake. The pizza was extremely rubbery and the hot chocolate was too watery. We did share our experience with the management there but they couldn't help us and were just standing there. This kind of service and quality seriously was not expected from a five star place. We just left the pizza as it is.

Went for a Sunday brunch.. it was a very good change with the live music playing at the corner, so much food to indulge in .. almost entered a food coma! The service was excellent I must say. Started with pesto salad and I think Waldorf salad both were really good then I tried the Cous cous salad too- must have. I indulged in masala dinner roll and mushroom focaccia bread both were so fresh and yummy. I tried the biryani since they had it specially for some occasion and it was brilliant üëåüèª we ordered a pizza and spaghetti both were so so , we finally went on to the massive dessert spread and honestly I've lost track of what all I landed up eating, but what stole the show was the hot waffle they made for us.. oh my, it was the best waffle I've eaten in Kolkata hands down, fluffy and cooked to perfection with maple syrup, whipped cream and chocolate ice cream. Sinful! Going back for it anytime now!

This is the buffet restaurant of ITC Sonar and I think it's the worst possible restaurant a star hotel could present. 
They claim to serve all kinds of cuisine. But the options were very limited. My grandpa had asked for hot chocolate. They served it hours later before presenting the bill when the meal was over. 
I had found a strangle of hair in the mutton curry. This kind of callousness is never expected from a reputed star hotel like this. 
Dessert options were better compared to other parts of the meal. Not at all recommended. On the other hand, very pricey to maintain its five star standards but the quality of food served is worst.

Food is tasty and quantity is also good considering a multi-star hotel. Ambience is also nice. The price is expected to be high but it is totally your money's worth. Chicken pasta and sandwich are the best on the menu (among what we had). Service is not very fast though and they keep you waiting for a really long time (even when there aren't too many people). But staff is friendly.

Chicken pasta and sandwich are the best on the menu (among what we had). Service is not very fast though and they keep you waiting for a really long time (even when there aren't too many people). But staff is friendly.

It was my second visit there with family, first being at their lavish Sunday brunch. Like first time, this time they didn't disappoint me with their wide array of foods from Bengali,south and north Indian,continental including Italian, Mediterranean. There were cheese and cold meat cuts, extensive salad sections,finger foods,excellent Kolkata style biriyani , delicious dessert...they had it all. Staffs were courteous as usual. They even served complimentary cocktails and a cake exclusively baked for us. Only cons I found are the absence of live music and striking absence of sea-food items in the menu.I hope they will revise their menu in future to accommodate one or two sea food items .

Been there just yesterday.The excitement was there as it is ITC and yes I am not at all disappointed. The  classy ambience and the perfections leading to the Eden Pavilion just added up to the quotient. The place superb with nicely lit with ever helping people around. We opted for the buffet. Started with soup.Awestruck by the bread basket laid. The mouth melting kababs to the different salads from chicken salami to papri chat to exclusive grape salad.The arrangement looked superb. The main course was right in the top slot.We tried the north indian dishes.The mutton was just mouth melting best. The self customized pizza,chicken honey bowl are to name a few.The dessert collection was just devine with so mane varieties starting from firni , marshmellow,sandesh,ras malai,exclusive mousee. Do try the Lichi Bhog, it was such awesome.You have to be there to experience it. You will be full but you mind will long for more. Just not giving 5 as the taste of authentic Hilsa was missing from the dish. The classy lights,slow music and good food.What else do we need?

Had been here on the last pomp of durga puja. The ambience of the restaurant was very well defined pertaining to a classy theme and corporate background and look. The kitchen of the restaurant lies straight in the middle of the dining area and is open where ITC chefs flaunt their incomprehensible culinary art.
We had ordered a simple potion of steamed rice and Chicken kobiraj to go with the authentic bengali taste. 
Food here is undoubtedly very good and the atmosphere is very soothing and silent.
Would love to visit soon

Its a wonderful spread, be it for breakfast or dinner. I'v even had the chance to eat a buffet made by chef qureshi and boy was it a meal apparently he doesn't let any other chef touch the food while he cooks. I hope I get to know when his buffet's  available at Eden pavellion

When it comes to food quality, not many hotels can compete with the ITC chefs. Went for a brunch with friends. The ambience was great. I loved the buffet which was laid. The bread basket was amazing. Would have liked a bit more of cold cuts and desserts. Less of south indian cuisine maybe. A few f n b staff looked a bit disinterested. Guess d food and friends and d ambience made my day

Eden Pavilion was my first experience of 5-star dining in the city. The local newspaper had printed a list of restaurants offering special menus to celebrate the year end, and we were specifically looking for the 5-star options, as we hadn't been to any. After a round of elimination (and heated deliberation), we picked this place for a weekday lunch.¬†

At the fist glance, Eden Pavilion seemed to be a cross between a lounge and a formal dining room. It looked sleek and lavish, as one would expect of ITC Sonar. The tables were leisurely laid out over the wide dining area, with the buffet spread placed in the centre. And what a spread it was! North Indian, South Indian, Chinese, Continental, Bengali - as the saying goes, there was something for everyone.

We started off conventionally with the soup - there were two on offer and I went with the chicken corn soup. Starters were also two in number - chicken kabab and a preparation involving potatoes - and these were served at our table. Having disposed of the prelude, I swiftly moved on to the salad spread, which looked inviting even from a distance. By a rough estimate, there were around 15 type of veg and non-veg salads, apart from the usual fare of chaats and dahi bhallas. They were arranged beautifully, and I was careful enough to try at least one serving of each. Not all of them were equally tasty; in fact a couple were quite repulsive, while a few left me craving for more. By a significant margin, the winner of the round was the prawn cocktail. It was better than the one I had tasted at one of Goa's esteemed eateries, and forced me to go for a second helping.

The salads conquered a major part of my appetite and going through all the items in the main course seemed like a daunting task thereafter. Now I am the sort of person who likes to try out almost every single item in a buffet, at least the ones in red, but I had to make an exception here. I decided to stay off some of the common Indian items and give the exotic looking Continental dishes a chance. The success rate of this section was greater than the salads, and almost all the items were sumptuous enough to leave me with a feeling of gratification. Unfortunately, I can't recall any of their names, but there was one Italian fish preparation which managed to linger for quite sometime.

It wasn't an easy decision to just peek at a cauldron of pulao and put back the lid, or walk past a shimmering pot of South Indian chicken curry without trying even a ladle of it, but I had already reached my breaking (or stretching) point and the desserts were yet to be dealt with. Even the desserts section spoilt me for choice and I had to exercise an enormous amount of self-restrain to stick to just one serving of each item. Once again, almost all the dishes on offer tasted as good as they appeared, even the scoop of butter-scotch ice-cream.

Curiously, the buffet also included a tray containing cheese slices of various shades and shapes. Although it was kept right next to the salads, I hadn't noticed it before. I have a natural predilection for cheese, and couldn't let the fact that I had already moved into my desserts be a barrier between me and the cheese slices. I picked up a few, shoved them into my desserts' plate, and actually ended my lunch on a cheesy note.

A lunch buffet in Eden Pavilion might have been heavy on the pocket, but the sheer range and variety of items on offer made up for it. The service was top-class as well. We had entered quite close to the end of lunch hours, but they never hurried us, and we enjoyed a leisurely meal at our own pace. If you are looking for that once-a-year special meal, this place is definitely worth your time and money. But a word of advice - arrive with an empty stomach, and strategize wisely before taking the lunge.

A decent coffee shop situated in the ITC Sonar Bangla Hotel on EM Bypass. The coffee shop itself is well done up with a good elaborate menu. We called for Margherita Pizza, Penne Arabiatta and a dessert. We were given a complimentary helping of house bread along with our order. Food was good and service was very pleasant. However, somehow I expected more from a 5 star coffee shop. The food felt like any good cafe in the city which somehow did not meet our expectations.

No, not at all what we expected from ITC Sonar!! The service was pathetic, the waiters over there were literally confused to find a table for four. Somehow after making us wait, they arranged for it, no one bothered to give the menu card, nor even asked about any opinion. We had to call them several times, to ask about the buffet menu. Now comes food. Thinking about the fact, it serves 4-5 cuisines, we came here, and i can say, only Indian part was okayish, but continental part didn't have much to offer. I remember, there was a tenderloin preparation which had mustard sauce in it, and almost every dish there had coriander leaves to garnish. I mean, i can understand you are trying to mix the taste of bengal, but like this? And, also, if any dish was getting finished, no one bothered to refill it up. The worst part was the chinese cuisine, having some smelly fish in hunan sauce and orangish noodles. It was very kind of them, that they kept so many options in the dessert section and they were fairly good enough and tasty. So, 2 points for the dessert and ambience. Service and food quality and taste,you guys need to improve!

ITC sonar, Kolkata has got this excellent habit of organising different food festivals in their Eden Pavilion outlet. They invite their master chefs from different part of the world and give us, the food lovers in Kolkata to change our taste and try the authentic tastes one a while. This time, under the Kitchens Of India series, they‚Äôve invited chef Shankar from ITC Chola to give us a taste of the telengana cuisine and I was glad, I was invited along with friends from KFB.

In Telengana, we were told, ragi and millet were the staple food and they prepared a variety of it. Ragi mudde or Ragi Ball is extremely popular dish there and here also, it was there.

As the welcome drinks, tender coconut water was served to us, which was a pleasant surprise. And, shortly after, the Karjam Vepudu was served on table. Please don‚Äôt get afraid. Its a mutton liver dry item, flavored with black peeper and curry leaves. I felt the spice quotient was much toned down (probably to suite the bengal palate), but the dish was great. The next item was Pappula Gare‚Ä¶ aka deep fried lentil pakora. I found it quite bland and the liver fry had to be reordered again.

¬†

The main course consisted of Samundar pulao (a spicy seafood rice prepapration) with mirch ka salan, Steamed rice with Ulava Charu. Ulava Charu is basically horse gram cooked with onion, spices and finished with cream. Frankly, its another version of rasam- watery, spicy and enjoyable. The mandatory Ragi Mudde/ Ragi ball was there and frankly this dish does not come under my most favorite items. The prawn dish (Royyala Vepudu) was great in taste and so was the spicy Mamsam Miryala Vepudu (mutton in semi-dry brown gravy pampered with black peeper). There was a country chicken dish (forgot the name- sorry !!!) and I was through.

¬†

But as they say, no telangana meal is complete without a bowl of Khubani ka meetha. Its made from dried apricots and topped with dry fruits. Its a semi watery dish and extremely sweetish in nature. The basanti was there, but after khubani ka meetha, was not really my type.

¬†

It was all part of the regular dinner buffet and a meal for 2 should cost around 4000/- here. but ITC Sonar has never been there for the price-sensitive crowd.

So, overall, the idea was great, execution brilliant and thanks to Chef shankara and Arundhati, we had a nice evening.

Bon apetite !!!

I always have a weakness for the grand breakfast buffet at 5 stars. This was the first time i got to enjoy that here in Kolkata. 
Eden Pavillion at ITC Sonar is a 24 hour restaurant offering a wide assortment of cuisines. 
We had a combination of english and south indian breakfast buffet. The meat spread was excellent with soft pork and chicken saucages, ham, bacon. Got a cheese omelette made on order and it was excellent. The liquid yolk and cheese oozed out with every bite. Loved the satay mushroom and potato skillet too. The south indian dishes were equally good. A very pleasant breakfast experience.
Their dessert section requires a special mention. Amazing assortment of doughnuts, beagles, cakes and pastries. We loved it so much, got some parcelled for room. 
 Will look forward to enjoy some more next time.

I never thought I would have to give such poor marking to any of the units of ITC Sonar Bangla, as I have been at Panasian and Dum Pukht and both were wonderful. But here I was disappointed.
Yesterday I went to meet someone there. I noted the beautifully decorated place. Sufficient light, lovely comfortable chairs. But that's about all.
When I tried to sit, the chair was too heavy for me. Unlike in other restaurants, none came running to help me sit by pulling the chair. Maybe I did not look lady-like at all to them.
The Maitre de table Ankit came. The boy was really polite and professional. I asked for cold coffee /something similar and wanted to see the menu. This is something I don't understand, why they don't want to show their menu cards. Is there some hidden treasure inside it? I remember the same thing happened when in Hotel Gateway coffee shop. As soon as I mentioned cold coffee the Maitre de table absolutely refused to show me the menu card and I ended up having something I didn't like.
But here I was not ready to face that same ordeal and I made Ankit get the menu card. There wasn't much option though. I chose Double Chocolate milk shake. My company ordered Darjeeling tea. For the snacks, we chose cheese chilly open sandwich as per Ankit's suggestion.
A little later a staff came to serve the tea on a beautiful tray. A little later the milk shake came on that tray. Without any straw.
The staff came back carrying A.Single.Straw. in his hand and thrust them to me. He again returned, this time carrying in his hand a packet containing two cookies and handed it to my companion. What is this, yaar? The smallest and the cheapest cafe staff has the decency to carry the beverage with a box of straw together on a tray. And couldn't he have brought the cookies with the tea on that tray? Handing over by hand looked so tacky! 
There is no sense of "Doubleness" in the milkshake. It is as thin as water with tiny pieces of chocolate floating on it. The sweetness was sufficient though. But I missed the thickness of the chocolate milkshake that I have tasted earlier.
The cheque arrived and my companion proceeded to pay by card. The staff stood there while we talked, making my companion uncomfortable. When he protested, then only the staff left. Is it too much to ask for comfort and privacy?

Had breakfast at this restaurant during a quick trip in to Kolkata. It is relatively small for a 5* coffee shop. Also, feels like it is an extension of the passage. A bit uncomfortable. It was crowded in the morning and although still courteous the service level was below average. The menu had all the usual breakfast options. Quality was ok. Nothing really stood out. I ordered one of their signature preparations - 7-grain porridge. Nice presentations but no taste. I expect much better from an ITC hotel. Suffice it to say, it was a disappointment, especially since it is an ITC hotel.

I have visited the place multiple. Last I visited was yesterday. The buffet was arranged on the lawn outside. The ambiance was very good. Usually I enjoy the pavilion very much. Yday it was not the same. 
The change of location created an uneasy zone for the staff I guess. The renowned ITC service was absent yday. Long waiting and confused staff was a let down.
The starters in the buffet for vegetarians was bad. The barbecue both indian and continental was not Wat I wud have expected from such a resturant. 
Main course and desserts were really nice. No complaints there.. only admiration ... 
May be it was one of those days where things didn't work d way it was planned....

Nice Place. I ended up here late at night to meet a friend. This place was my only hope to get alcohol. After 2 days of non stop shooting, you need some of it. Although most places were shut in Kolkatta i gave up hopes of finding alcohol and good food anywhere. It was 1AM literally.¬†

Ankit was the in charge here and on requesting he did manage to get me some beers with some nice food. I also tried their shawarma sandwich which was quite weird to look at when you think sandwich but it was very yummy. They staff was very warm and i think i almost missed the buffet by being late. Nevertheless next time i travel to Kolkatta i am definitely staying here. I also missed all the fish delicacies this time :(

PS: I was busy hogging and drinking and forgot to take photos

Whenever I come here, there's always something different. Like the food is different. Something from some cuisine , something from another and so on. The pizzas they serve are good if you like thin crust pizza. But one thing that's constant and you'll find everyday is the mud pie. And if I  go there , I only concentrate on the desserts because they are so good. The mud pie, when you take a spoonful of it , it has this rich chocolate cake with a gooey chocolate sauce over it. And it's warm. And when you have it , all of it melts in your mouth. And that is the best feeling ever. If you want this piece of heaven ,  do go there and have only that. And it'll be worth it.

Over a period of two weeks, I have been to this place twice. Both the times for business purposes. When you talk of ITC Hospitality, the first thing that comes to my mind is the name of their flagship hotel, ITC Sonar. After reaching Kolkata, I was always planning to drop by here but could not do so for one or the other reason.

Moving forward, no issues with the food. We were served a buffet, which had a spread of Indian and Continental dishes. The dessert section was mouth watering and offered quite a variety of sweets. The service was impeccable which ensured that nobody was walking around with an empty plate or glass. The bar was good too with a variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks on offer. 

The ambiance of the place is grand. The lobby  had a live band playing some soothing jazz music, which added to the decor of the place. 

All in all, a fine experience. And a must go if you are in Kolkata and want to experience the hospitality of ITC

Be it Indian, Typical Bengali, or Western. Amazing range of food, starters and desserts. Quality is superb. Service is too excellent. All the staffs put an extra effort to take care of your every need. They always have a helping hand.

Disappointed considering the fact that the brand is ITC. Spread is minimal so no value for money when you consider buffet at Taj Bengal or Hyatt Kolkata. Service is mediocre they were busy winding up at 10.00pm itself and by 10.30 pm they were closed !! even the medium sized restaurants do not have such bizarre policy. Services and spread both needs vast improvement. I visited the place on 21st Aug night with my spouse and child.

Situated inside the ITC Sonar near Science City, one of those late night munching places when the Big Daddy is paying (to be frank, it's not as steep as it looks it would be - a pizza costs 700-1000 bucks) The spread is awesome, especially after you're happy and high and the place is cheerfully brightly lit - way more cheerful and less formal than the Dum Pukht situated next to it.

Breakfast a few times last week at this rather smallish coffee shop. They seem to have stuffed too many tables in with a result that there's no individual space at all. Service could be better as well, lots of staff loitering around but you struggle to get them to provide service. And anything you order takes min 20 mins to arrive. Rather surprising at an ITC property; they usually have superb food and impeccable service.

Breakfast a few times last week at this rather smallish coffee shop. They seem to have stuffed too many tables in with a result that there's no individual space at all. Service could be better as well, lots of staff loitering around but you struggle to get them to provide service. And anything you order takes min 20 mins to arrive. Rather surprising at an ITC property; they usually have superb food and impeccable service.

I had lunch buffet which was really expensive but there were various items from Bengali to Italian all of them. Most of the food was very delicious but extraordinary thing I had the various types of desserts which was just fantastic. I would really want to go have again and again but the it is expensive.

From start to the end, Eden Pavilion is class of its own. A feel good feeling every time you go there.

Last time I went on my girlfriend 's birthday and had the buffet. As usual we had no complain. 
Ambience - 5/5
Food - 4/5

The ITC Sonar houses some of my favourite restaurants namely the West View Grille and Pan Asian.So I was dissapointed to see an empty Eden Pavilion on my way back home from the airport after my Delhi Belly trip.I have been visiting this place for years and lost count of the buffets and fastivals I've participated in.

After being seated we were told that the only available options are soups,pizza,pasta and sandwich.Then why have an elaborate menu?Go figure.The service was attentive though and we ordered chicken egg rolls,Middle eastern sandwich with hummusand a soup.The quality of all the items were below par and unexpected from the exalted house.The roll was elastic and hardly any chicken in it.I think u unlike other cities,the post dinner supper scenario is dismal in Kolkata and hence the hotels have become casual about menu and service during this period.But for a chain to become great from just good it is this finer points that add up to glory.

We ordered a pizza and it was really good. It was all the things that a good pizza should be. The complementary bread served with pesto or the tomato garlic paste was nice too. Really nice pesto. The juice we ordered was fresh too. But my mood was completely ruined by this one flickering bulb over my head. It was annoying. It isnt something you expect from a place like ITC Sonar Bangla. Also, our table had no tissues or serviettes and the staff didnt seem to notice. All in all, an evening that would have otherwise been amazing was ruined by things you wouldn't typically expect from a place like this!

We raised the idea in front of our project manager "just like that" to have a dinner at ITC SONAR....we are still confused how that got approved....however, last week we a team 12 people dropped in over here for the buffet dinner...the interior, courtesy of the hotel staffs were really appreciable..I concentrated on the continental starters and salads...what else would you want if u see handful of pepperoni garnished with lettuces and chicken salami, pork slices, lip smacking sea food soup, shrimp with pepper, and many other items which i cannot even remember....It took me around 2 hours to complete my appetite...but something which is refraining me to put a 5 rating for this restaurant are like this-
1. Variety and quality of food in main course
2. Courtesy of the well dressed waitors. I had to ask for the drinking water 3 times and for the desert spoon, which upon promised, never reached my table. C'mon it's a 5 star property...and u just can't afford to deal with ur customers like this anyway.
Overall, the experience was nice...but the main course needs a lot of variety and improvement in terms of quality.

I went there twice. First time for buffet and next time for A la carte. The interior of ITC Sonar was incredible including the pond full of lotus and the statues, they create the 5-star luxury ambience. 
The food was lip-smacking. The shrimp dish was mouth watering. This was the first time I liked any shrimp dish that much. The chicken in the chicken burger was soft and delicious. Chenar Paturi was rich with nuts. The staff was helpful and service was really quick. Overall just love this place.

Eden Pavilion is the 24 hour coffee shop of ITC Sonar. 
Tastefully done decor, this place offers no view.
ITC sonar is a supremely beautiful property especially the lotus ponds in between, adds to the grandeur of the place but sadly none of the restaurants provides you any view. 

Anyways back to Eden pavilion I have tried their buffet a couple of times and honestly except for the dessert section I never found their main course or the starters to be exceptional. From their ala carte I have tried their hot steaming cappuccinos, mocha shake & their freshly squeezed watermelon juice, all very nice. But the food lacks a bit of finesse when it comes to both presentation and taste. Staff though expert in their respective fields doesn't make you feel welcome or special in anyway. 
I have ordered their deconstructed open sandwich more than once and didn't like the flavours, their aglio olio pasta was quite decent but nothing great. 
This place is very average compared to their other five star restaurants. The other speciality restaurants like pan asian, Bukhara and dumpukht are much better options but they also come with their limitations and are only open in the evening for dinner on weekdays and both lunch & dinner over the weekend. 
A place like ITC sonar Bangla with such a below average 24 hour restaurant is actually quite a disappointment.

Buffet has a combination of multiple cuisins both veg and non veg. It is not that the vegetarian would suffer because of a few options. The taste is good which gets a 4.5 out of 5. 6 to 7 veg dishes in main course. The service was slow when it came to serve breads. Ambience gets a 4. You amy try hot rasgulla to on request no extra charges. Great place to be with family and colleagues.

This review is based on the fact that it is a resturant in a 5 star hotel. The buffet is just average nothing spectacular that one needs to spend so much.

It's just a OK place... The spread is big but not so tasty. Various other places will give you much better ambience and food options

Well, ITC Sonar leaves little dust in the carpets, and the food at the Eden is no exception.
Delectable, and surprisingly, not as much of a pocket pinch as expected.
The non-veg buffet here covers almost all cuisine known to mankind. Among them, the shrimp cocktail needs a special mention - i've rarely tasted a more innovative, exceptional dish.
The bacon, pepperoni and other continental items are excellent, and so are the eastern delicacies, apart from the biriyani, which was a bit on the bland side.
The desserts - oh my lord, were those brilliant. The mousse, the pastries, the buns, the gulab jamuns, all of 'em. Utterly amazing.

The service is tip-top and perfect, as expected. It was the platinum jubilee for my parents, and I had told them that beforehand. What was unexpected was the complimentary chocolate mousse cake they gave along with the meal, along with a photograph to cherish.
The cake was, needless to say, very good. Capped off an excellent experience.

The Buffets are pretty lavish--from North indian to oriental,Italian and British with American thrown in for good measure!1 Great place for a Sunday relaxed Lunch with family and friends . the puddings ,tarts,gateaus,pastries are all fresh and excellent and bad for the midriff!!! Nonethe less take time off and go have a great meal. besides the buffet you can select your favorite from the ala carte.. So Enjoy.

Their menus are elaborate and never ending. Shivankit Mehta, Gaurav Chopra, Ivan Saha and Debayan Ganguly deserves special mention. Although i went for buffet today. Not to forget my chefs who always care for my taste Mr. Shubankar and Mr. Varun. Great experience and impeccable service.¬†its my 5th time to this place.

The starters were delicious. Being a vegetarian, having so many options was quite a delight. The main course however was a bit disappointing as the paneer felt like rubber while chewing. The desserts were amazing. The mudpie was orgasmic. Overall, the ambience is quite nice and it's a really nice place to visit if you're with your friends or family.

Celebrating the win of Kolkata Knight Riders over a long drive, we decided to chill down for sometime before heading back home at 4 am in the night. Somehow the first place that kept to our mind was Eden Pavilion (Yeah, official KKR stay and the word 'Eden' I guess :P). My love for bacon is always kicking, thus we ordered for a spaghetti carbonara. The dish was sufficient for two people at that time of the dawn. The complementary hot bread served with an extremely appetising condiment kick started our hunger and we waited patiently for the food to arrive. One look at it and I knew it is going to be awesome. Overtly cheesy, full of little bacon pieces strewn over the entire dish, the spaghetti looked heavenly. Adding some oregano and chilli flakes, we gulped down every bit of the dish and the molten cheese in fifteen minutes. It was profusely cheesy yet light and comforting. Definitely one of the best carbonaras I have had in town.

I did not particularly care for the way this coffee-shop is laid out. It seemed it was just haphazardly inserted into available space. Not the most comfortable to sit at either.

The food does better than the lay-out though. We tried the Kolkata style rolls that were well made, I personally had a mixed meat pizza with ham, pepperoni etc. It was rather nice. The coffee was like what one would expect.

Service is smart and unobtrusive.

The Easter brunch at Eden Pavilion was truly a treat for the senses - we scored some amazing food - including a delicious prawn cocktail, soft turkey roast, a divine pork saltimbocca among other stuff. The saltimbocca was excellent - soft meat, bacon wrapped together as one, and the turkey was absolutely juicy and tender. The prawn cocktail was very old school - and came with chopped eggs in it. One issue - I did not much like the asparagus, which was underseasoned, in my opinion. Otherwise, great! I also rather loved their coffee, and the lightened up eggs benedict they have introduced as part of their new menu.

Have been here earlier for lunch and dinner but this is the first time I tried their breakfast buffet and must say it was fabulous.Was really pleased with the spread and options available.
Starting from orange/sweet lime juice(did not like the beetroot juice but it was also aavailable) to chicken ham and sausages,pork sausages,bacon rashers,eggs to order,french toast,grilled fish(not as good as it looked),assorted cheese other than the regular south indian and bengali spread.There also was a wide range of muffins and breads.Taste of each was pretty good.We found service to be really courteous and attentive(some other tables complained of delay but we enjoyed our hearts out at leisure so did not feel anything but happy).The charge was around 1100 per person.
Overall a hugely recommended experience.

I have dined at the Eden Pavilion quite a few times now and have had a different experience (mostly in good ways:) each time. A week back, I was craving for a good thin crust pizza and decided to visit the place since we were close by and yes their pizzas are actually quite good! You probably wouldn't expect this, but they serve one of the best pizzas I'v tasted in Cal. So we go there and see the usual elaborate buffet dinner spread, but what caught my fancy was the desserts section- it had Everything my sweet tooth wanted - from the very bong nolen gur ice cream, to my favorite tiramisu, to the classic English apple pie, or something that looked like a petit four croquembouche.. oh yes the surprise element was huge bowls of marshmallows and jujubes! The buffet spread had Indian as well as Italian food selection so we decided to go for it. Everything we had barring the veg biryani was great - the pizza, pasta, and the lamb biryani were the best. Food rarely disappoints you, service is unquestionably exceptional (as is the case with most 5- star properties), ambience is decent too. I would come here again and again..

One of my favourite places,if I have time in hand and I'm not extremely hungry. It has a very relaxed feel to it. And the food is unquestionably of very good quality.
This place is a fish market when there is a celebrity or a cricket team staying at the hotel,as people flock to catch a glimpse of them. But nonetheless,the food quality isn't compromised.
As I said earlier,I go there when I just feel like having a soup and a few buns,or just a few slices of pizza. The quantity of the soup is enough for two people. They serve a complimentary bread basket with it,as is done in all five star hotels. 
The desserts were the main reason I had started going to this place initially. The variety and the uniqueness of their desserts is commendable. Do NOT miss them !

I visited the Eden Pavilion last evening for dinner and was pleasantly surprised. Honestly out of all the restaurants at the ITC Sonar this is my least favorite though I love Coffee Shops in general and frequent them regularly. Least favorite because only a few standard items are good and the rest are just average. However yesterday I had guests from Mumbai who were staying there a delayed flight meant they reached the hotel only at 10 pm and were too tired to want to venture out but wanted to sample Bengali food so we headed to the Eden Pavillion . Luchi, Steamed Rice , Bhekti Paturi , Cholar Dal , Alu Dum and Vegetable Chorchori followed. I have to say that the Paturi was the star of the meal .... the Bhekti was superbly fresh , perfectly cooked with lovely flavors. All the other items were well prepared the luchis were lovely light and not at all oily. Was perhaps one of the best meals I have sampled at the Eden Pavilion. Service as always was excellent so all in all it made for a great dinner.

The ambience is leisurely, and staff courteous, the buffet spread was a delight for a lover of cold cuts of meat such as myself.I had a satisfying time tasting and retasting the salami,beef caroaccuo, pork pepperoni cuts, the tuna salad, zuchini n bellpepper with parmesan, and other salad items,continental and lebanese on offer.The biriyani was delicious with succulent meat n fantastic aroma.the veg and nonveg sidedishes were good accompaniments.however I was disappointed with the baked bekti,which was dry.Dessert items were not upto the mark,with only the choco mud pie and pannacota with citrus zest creating aan impression.the plentiful mousse and puddings on offer were largely ordinary.all in all a pleasing experience.

Quite frankly this is not a restaurant that I look forward to going back to. The buffet spread is a wide one but the food somehow is not all that great as compared to other restaurants at ITC The Sonar. The only positive thing about the buffet is that there's a wide array of good cheese available. The ala carte menu also does not offer too man choices but one grilled item of beef that I had ordered was at best decent but not worthy of being served in a 5 star hotel's restaurant. The dessert menu is perhaps a bit of a consolation.

Food never tasted this bad. This is an awful place that I would never ever visit again or recommend to anybody else. For any restaurant the first thing I check is the food. We opted for the buffet. The pulao was made from smelly rice. Yes, SMELLY rice. the desserts looked good, tasted horrible. The salads were just simply blunt. the chicken was anything but not tasty. and we paid 1800 bucks per head for this shit they call food! If you love food do not ever visit this place. Simply and Strictly avoid. Wish I could rate it in negative.

Nice place, good ambience. However lunch buffet was not that much interesting. Soups were so so. Instead of so many salads it was preferred few non-veg items like kababs, grilled fish etc. on the starter spread. On the good side, Biriyani was good, all the chicken and lamb preparations were good. There were a lot of options in desert spread. The staff are courteous as one would expect from a five star resturant and the food is a treat. Though steep on the pocket, I would strongly recommend the buffet rather than a la carte menu.

The quality and the different innovations on food items especially the starters and deserts have disappeared.
 I had a conference there in august and recently went back with family in october. Unfortunately i ate at eden both the times. But i was surprised to find major items being the same. Even the deserts were not something to die for at least not ITC standards that were there once.

One of the best lunch buffets I've ever experienced ever. This was during holi. The selection of Indian dishes, the dessert and tapas section were on special interest to me for their sheer variety and quality. It's a must go for everyone even if on a low budget, because you get a lot more than what you pay for. Just my two cents!

I went to this place a couple days back, for the breakfast buffet. Started on a good note, warm food, good spread; the works. But when I ordered a coffee, the waiter got it, and picked the saucer from the nearby table, and coolly gave it to me. Well, if it was an unused table, I wouldn‚Äôt have minded so much. But, when from a used table, a used saucer arrives, I lose my cool. Overall the experience was good, but if the service has stooped to such a low, then I doubt I‚Äôll visit again.

I visited the place a week back. Nice place, nice ambience, waiters are very polite. However I found the lunch buffet could have been more interesting. Instead of too many salads I would have preferred few items like fish and chicken kabaabs. Also on that day I found 2-3 lamb dishes, that was too many, they could have arranged one mutton dish as not everybody is equally ease with lamb. On the good side, Biriyani was awesome, all the chicken and lamb preparations were good. There were many options to choose from even if you are a pure vegeterian which is not very common in most of the buffets. I found Chaanch and Red Berry juices very tasty. There were a lot of options in desert. Though the cost is on higher side, overall it was a nice experience.

What a food. Late night soups at the 24- hour coffee shop - especially the Roasted Garlic one leaves an after taste for you to go back there again and again. 
Obviously, once you are at such aroma set places, you leave your pocket worries in the parking lot.... Yet it is worth in every lifetime, to make visits at this place  for small bites even of that mean lightly vinegrated and garnished Ceasar Salad. Enjoy the moment, enjoy the food...

One of the worst places to have your food. Trust me, they are just horrible. I have had dinner at Taj Bengal, Hyatt, Grand & Park Hotel and was hoping for a similar grand experience when we visited this place some 3 years back. However, it was disappointing and infuriating to say the least. 

First, as a part of their policy, they do not allow camera and the person manning the gate pointed that to us in an utterly disgraceful and rude manner. In hindsight, I should have taken the cue from that incident and left the place instantly.

Second, they were short staffed when we arrived and it took them at least 15(yes, FIFTEEN) minutes to send somebody to attend to us and another ten minutes for that person to bring us two glasses of water. And all this while there were just two other sets of customers in the entire restaurant who too were facing a similar predicament.

We opted for the buffet spread and on insistence of the waiter we waited  in our table for our soups to arrive. Big mistake ! It took them another 15 minutes to serve the damn soup. Soup was just ok and way below expectations. Mood was spoilt beyond repair and we decided to help ourselves for the rest of the course.

Both of us being the continental food lovers that we are, loaded generous helpings of the pasta that they had. Ouch !! Never have I tasted such a bland, tasteless and disgraceful pasta. We literally had to empty our plates in the waste bin and ask for replacement plates. Yes, it was that awfully bad. Next up, was the chicken dish (Indian preparation) which was equally bad and tasteless. Tried 2-3 vegetarian dishes which turned out to be at least edible and we had to satiate our hunger with the kebabs and sweet dishes which were good.

Overall, pathetic service with the waiters being absolutely ignorant, snobbish and rude and after paying 1800 bucks per head for the kind of horrible shit that we had, we really felt like kicking whoever the manager was. He came and apologized profusely to us and even tried to sell us a membership at a discounted rate (Beat that !!!). 

My recommendation would be to strictly avoid this restaurant at any cost. 1 star from me just because Zomato does not allow negative or zero ratings.

I done know how people below had a pleasant experience and recommend this place to others.

I have been there a couple of time and have had TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE ALWAYS. The food is alrite nothing great and some of the dishes can be categorized as bad their tomato soup is terrible and their pizzas is absolutely rubbish too. I dont know how a 5 star coffee shop could go wrong with a basic pizza.

To top it all the STAFF, RUDE, GUD FOR NOTHING, ILL-MANNERED, UNPOLITE. 

This place does not meet 5 star standards and is below average, just as the other restaurants in this hotel.

NOT RECOMMENDED. AVOID.

what an experience.....i must say !! spending 5 grands there was worth it .. went for dinner with my fiance and to my surprise the open air dinner buffet was beside this beautiful water body .. and also there was a live performance of old english classics ... which lit the whole ambience actually... the starters were served in grilled sizzler plate ... grilled chicken and fish were sooo mouth watering and simply melted in the mouth ... there was also sarso da saag and makki da roti and biriyani in the main course which we loved ... the desserts had a hugeeeeeeeeee variety and also mouth watering ... special mention to the sugar free desserts .. !!!

We've been there thrice and it was a bad experience all the three times. The first time we just landed up for coffee and tit bits. The service was super bad and we thought since we turned up at n off time they were short staffed. The second time we turned up was for the buffet dinner. They had a fashion show they were catering to that day. I realize that the people from the fashion show are important people but its not like we weren't paying money. Neither was the food upto standards and again the STAFF SERVICE WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. The third time we turned up again for coffee and tit bits, the salad was way over priced, I've had food at the Marriot and Meredian but I never thought ITC would be this bad. Plus we were absolutely ignored the third day as well. It's sad a chain like ITC has this bad service, especially when Pan Asia provided us with brilliant service every time we visited. It's the worst restaurant I've ever been to I'd I would highly discourage it for other people as well.

Been to this place umpteen number of times. All for the sunday brunch. Cost about 2200-2500 per person. 

Salad bar is elaborate. The main course buffet seems dated now for that price. A little secret:- Call ahead and ask if they have mutton nihari on the menu. If no, they will make it especially for you and it is awesome every time. The mutton falls off the bone!!> so good, we called the chef over and thanked him.

Eden Pavillion exudes the charm and grace one one associate with the ITC chain. The staff are courteous one would expect and the food is a treat. The starters range from sea food to assorted cold cuts, salads, soups and I strongly recommend the buffet. Steep on the pocket? Of course it is..but is good value for money. Some only concern is given the number of international guests the main course focuses on a lot of Indian/ North Indian food... but a minor and bearable glitch in the gastronomical scheme of things!
