Went for a 5 Course North Indian Dinner with my friend via a coupon booked on Cleartrip.
The best thing about the place is it's ambience.  The place is nicely decorated and has good interiors. 
When it comes to food I would say it's average. The Welcome Drinks served to us were nice and refreshing. As starters we had Paneer Tikka which tasted good. We ordered Paneer Butter Masala and Dal Makhani which were also good in taste. But the veg jhaal frezy was worthless. We had to waste its entire serving as it was just like boiled vegetables served with spices and tasted pathetic. Butter naan was okay but a piece was totally burnt which I showed to a staff but received no response. Vegetable pulao was very tasty and finally the Hot Gulab Jamun with Ice Cream was great. Food was also served in sufficient quantity. 
Staff were nice and cordial in there behaviour.
However some flaws were also noticed. First of all we had to wait for a long 35 minutes after placing our order to get the food. Then we had to specifically ask for the chutney for Paneer Tikka and Onion Salad . And lastly we had to request for  Finger Bowls which had cold water instead of warm. Improvements are definitely required by the restaurant in these aspects. 
Overall experience was nice and we had a good time.
Would not hesitate to visit the place again but hope to have a better experience then. :)

My Friends and I had booked some Seats from Nearbuy . And accordingly we arrived at the Hotel CrestWood . We were a group of 21, so its apparent that some basic preparations should have been made from the Restaurant Staff. But they seemed surprised that we had turned up . And then we had to wait for 20 mins to get the Welcome drinks which had Thumbs Up . Two of the glasses had been diluted with water and on demanding explanation they said Thumbs UP had frozen so they added soda to get it back to liquid. Then ( about a decade) arrived Chicken Sweet corn soup but I better call it Chicken Stew. It was nowhere what we call a Soup. After that literally one hour later came Fried Rice which was insufficient in quantity. Chowmein was fine. Lemon Chicken was terrible. It seemed like the pieces of chicken had been Boiled in that Soup and lemon had been squeezed into it. The only item that was good was Crispy baby corn. No other item was worth the ¬†money or time we wasted waiting for the next Course. Talking About the staff , they seemed friendly and were trying to cover up the fault in their mismanagement. I had asked for Black Pepper which actually never arrived. The Ambience was Just ok but the place was a bit smaller than expected.¬†
Summing up, Guys if you want to waste your mood and time, Please do pay a visit here. And i promise , You shall Thank me for ages to come.

Looks are deceiving.The food is terrible. Crispy chilly potato tastes like finger chips, the baby corn is as oily as can be. 
The garlic chicken and chilly chicken are stale also it tastes more Indian than Chinese. Dal makhani was atrocious didn't have salt or anything. 
The dal was a benchmark for the next worst thing.
Jeera rice had kacha jeera.

I saw this place's deal in nearby groupon ..so purchased it. Saw the reviews of this place and found it perfectly correct as even i experienced the same thing . The place is little in interiors ...little difficult to locate. 
The ambience is nothing as that good ..just average. Its small that big also . Coming to food part.. yes some items were good but some needs improvement alot.  
Ordered chinese... crispy chilli potato wasn't that good. Even crispy chilli baby corn also needs improvement. Veg and non veg haka chowmein both were good . Veg machurian was just bad. Awful.  Was actually looking like lauki kofta of any home made... I actually told them to tell your chef to please learn.. even there wasn't any gravy though I mentioned that we need gravy . Fired rice was good. So overall food also didn't impressed me.  
Yes staff was good and polite.. but again disappointing factor was their SLOW service . Very slow indeed!we actually had to remind them and ask several times..." aur kitna time lagega bhaiya".... 
Yes forget to mention quantity ...only this was more impressive. Their quantity was very good. We cudnt eat every thing. We actually had to pack the food. 
So overall not an impressive dining experience ... !

The interior is beautiful and the staff very helpful and courteous.. But when it comes to food... It's awful.. Starting right from the drinks, which tasted like mixed with a lot of water and so you get a very slight flavor of the actual drink.. Then the dishes tasted ohh so very stale.. Though the quantity was quite good but no use.. And they make you wait for quite a good deal of time and then they serve you ohh so very tasteless dishes..Do not ever visit this place.. A BIG NO TO THIS PLACE..

From park circus take the road which leads to Shakespeare sarani.leave the 1st right and take the next right and after few buildings u can find the restaurant.
The very first thing i want to mention is the staffs are really nice and well behaved. Coming to the food,we took bengali buffet but it was not upto the expectation as the food were getting finished was replaced when your hunger is almost gone and the items which they serve u on table took hours to come.and also the variety of food is less.
But personally i loved the ambience and decorations. its can improve alot to attract more people.when i was getting out from the restaurant,the owner personally gave his card to me and behaved so well that it made my day.

Me and my friend went there on the eve of Kali Pujo. We brought package from Nearbuy for a dinner at ‚Çπ499. We went there at around 9:30 pm and to our surprise we are the only one there on festive night. What we really liked there is dal fry. Chicken was not good. Location is so so kinda, I'm sure many will not like it.

We went for a namami lunch with family..and apparently it was my husbands birthday...crestwood...is a small restaurant..that is not the issue..whatever food they served was good to taste...but the variety is minimal..for a buffet of 400 bucks..there was only a chicken cutlet and cauliflower fritters...with papads and chat..for main course and desert there was only six items excluding rice n roti...I have been to a large number of places serving buffet..but I must admit..it wasn't value for money at all...my 1.5 rating goes only for taste

Located near Shiraz Golden Restaurant or Park Sweets to be precise.
As we entered the place felt uneasy and lil scared because of the lighting and shady appearance of the place.
As soon as the food arrived all doubts and fears cleared from our minds. The food was exquisite , damn tasty.
Ordered Orange Juice , Kadai Chicken , Mixed Veg , Yellow Dal , Veg Pulao , Butter Naan & Butterscotch Icecream.

This restaurant is one of my favourite.. Whether i drop in for breakfast or dinner. It never disappoints. Interior is fab and so is the food. And the plus point is that it is So easy to locate. Cheese chilli toast is recommeded if you drop in for snacks.

One of the worst experiences I had in a restaurant. 

I had taken a deal which was 5 course meal for 2 people for 499. We had a reservation and we went half an hour late. The lunch hour ended at 3 according to the deal, we went at 3.30. When we had called up the manager, he was extremely defiant on allowing us. Upon explaining the situation, he was okay, provided we pre-decide and let him know what we'll have. 

We selected the crispy baby corn, mixed veg fried rice and chilli paneer. When I called him back to give the order, he tone was rude and he was repeating that we should not be late the next time.

When we reached there, we saw the restaurant was open, hence I could see no reason why our being a little late affected anything. The service staff showed us to our table, and we were made to wait for 15 minutes after that, with no service, not even being offered a glass of water. 

The starter came after 20 minutes; even though we had ordered in over the phone. It had excess salt and was much too oily. The main course came in then. The fried rice was again, too oily, and I have had much better in cheaper restaurants. The chilli paneer seemed to made with oil and soya sauce. It was inedible. We complained and it was changed after another 20 minutes. This time, it was at best, okay. The fried rice had become cold, and thus, it was all very drab. Meanwhile, we had order sweet fresh lime sodas, and what we got didn't seem sweet at all. Upon again complaining, they added more sugar, and even still, it had too much lemon juice. It almost tasted bitter. 

I'll never recommend this restaurant to anyone.

One of the best Restraurants in that area, with Privacy and comfort. Food is quite good also, specially the Chinese dishes. It's. Renovated recently and U will surely love your visit.
