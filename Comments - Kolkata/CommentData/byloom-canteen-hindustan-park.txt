One of those simple and comforting cafes with an ambience unparalleled in south Calcutta. A must visit for all of those who look up to a nice evening in a cozy cafe and not just a crowdy check-in.

Byloom is a store cum cafe with loads of 'bangaliyana'. A true bong would definitely love the ambience. They have a cool collection of cotton sarees, jackets and handbags. We browsed some items and headed for their canteen to try the food.

The canteen has both indoor and outdoor seating. We obviously chose to sat outdoors. The decor is neat, It has a glass roof with vibrantly painted wooden seats, cane chairs, a small water fountain at a corner, hanging lamps, artworks. The tables have brass bells to call the servers. It's a cute concept but ringing the bell too softly doesn't work, whereas ringing it loudly makes other people frown and is quite embarrassing.

The menu is simple and fuss free with some bengali favorites like luchi mangsho, daab paani, pithe, malpoa, cutlets etc.

We ordered the veg porota platter and a caramel custard. Service was slow but servers were extremely polite. The porotta platter had paranthas stuffed with sattu and sweet potatoes. Well cooked, not oily, soft and thin, but needed more filling. It came with a potato curry and tomato achaar. While the potato curry was a tad bland, the tomato achaar more than made up for it! It had tomatoes, green chillis, mustard, fenugreek and curry leaves. The tangy spicy taste went perfectly well with the paranthas. The custard took too long to arrive at our table. Nothing otherworldly but just okay.

Finally, we asked for the bill but it didn't arrive even after 15 minutes, so went up and paid at the counter. Overall, we won't mind paying another visit, preferably on a wintry morning.

Pocket pinch for us-
Porotta platter- INR 150
Caramel custard- INR 65
Taxes- INR 25
TOTAL- INR 240
No service charges.

Situated opposite Sienna Cafe in Hindustan Park. This place is quaint, ambience very clean and spacious. 
We ordered chicken cutlet,fish and chips,chai,coffee and luchi mangsho. Everything was superb,except for the french fries which were a little soggy and under seasoned. 
Highly,highly recommended. Visiting again.

It was a by-chance visit while on a quest to find a different cafe. And boy was it worth it.
The cafe is a nice and cosy one with a variety of options of food and drinks. Many Bengali Cuisines are available which looked absolutely mouth watering when they were being served.We had a pair of chicken cutlets and tea. They were perfect. The tea was lovely.But the thing which stole the show was the popsicle. Please do try the Daab Popsicle. It just seems that they have frozen the malai itself. It is superb.This is a must visit place for people looking for a quiet time pass and simply delicious food.Ohh and a temple bell is on every table to call the staff :)

Located in Hindustan Park.They have limited items on the menu. Cosy place with nice ambiance. We ordered Luchi Cholar dal and Kosha Mangsho.The taste of the food is normal.Mangsho was less in quantity.A Bell is kept on the table to call for any staffs.The cafe is basically attached to a saree shop. Pretty cool 😎

I had already been to the boutique earlier, but even though the canteen has been around for quite sometime now i visited it only recently and was pleasantly surprised. A very cosy joint with great ambience, the place is perfect for an evening hangout. The staff was courteous.
We ordered the chicken cutlet, darjeeling tea and lemon iced tea. The chicken cutlet was good, though its appearance didn't appeal much at first. The darjeeling tea was okay, while the iced tea was pretty good. But the show stealer was the Coconut Popsicle. It was the perfect dessert for those who might not be interested in overtly sweet delicacies.
Overall it is a decent place to visit. I'm definitely looking forward to visiting it again.

This is a place where you can just sit and go on talking with your friends with nibbles that comes in medium range. Whatever I ordered I was satisfied but only the chicken wings was too spicy(we asked for it but turned  out too spicy, our bad). Apart from that I thoroughly enjoyed sitting there with beautiful interior and good service.

Tucked away behind the very popular Byloom boutique, the Canteen has also caught the Bengali fancy. The place is now large and spacious since I last visited them a few years back. The food is ok. Liked the prawn cutlet but although the mansher chop was highly recommended, didn't like it much. You can spend a lazy afternoon with friends or family here which is what we did. 
The service is prompt and friendly and they will parcel if you would like to take home some food too. 
The ambience is nice and lighted and it's worth a visit once.

Lovely quaint canteen at the Byloom saree store. Superb pit stop for some food and rest in the middle of some hectic shopping. Highly recommend their Darjeeling tea. Mutton chops were pretty awesome too. Mostly Bengali cuisine. Very cozy ambience. Service is warm but slow (the 0.5 less is only because of the slow service - else this place deserves a full 5 star rating).

This place is the Paradise for every Adda-and-Food lover Bengali. This place got some amazing Bangaliana vibes in its store where they sell the products and also the food of the Byloom canteen. One thing that's a must-have for me whenever I visit Byloom is Luchi and Kosha Mangsho, and I die at its taste everytime I have it. You can call this my weakness here. I love its taste. I also love the Koraishutir Kochuri but its supposedly seasonal and its unavailable most of the times. The staff should be more responsive and active. Needs training. Otherwise this place is perfect.

Visited this place few weeks back with my friends. The tea at 60+GST is ordinary. The chili cheese toast was not cheesy enough. But the crispy fish and chips with a tartar dip is 10/10. Flaky fish coated with a cornflakes covering . Best eaten hot. The mutton kosha and luchi were another good combo. While they were one of best luchis I have tried the mutton was soft and made well. They use rewaji meat so it had that distinct smell which I don't like. Not sure if others even get a smell from rewaji meat or it's just my nose. 😐 the iced tea was a regular tasting iced tea.
The staff are very nice. Each table has ghonta to ring for service. They let you seat for a lot of time which really is a plus point.

A casual cafe with very little to offer on the platter. A single page menu boasts of Bengali snacks like cutlets, fish fry, mangshor chop and items like sandwich and wraps. Although the food was good the price was a little on the higher side. The ambience was good with minimal decor and high on impact.

Nice cozy little place tucked away inside the Byloom outlet. I was saree shopping with a few of my friends and did make it a poing to visit the cafe. The decor is impressive considering its carved out of a old south kolkata house.

Ordered a plate of mochar chop, mutton chop and chicket cutlet along with ampora shorbot. Mutton chop had more potato and less of mutton but fried to perfection and crispy. Mochar chop is good for vegetarians and had generous fillings of mocha I must say. The chicken cutlet was served with french fries and was okay. Bill was 600 plus inclusive of GST which I thought was a bit expensive considering I was having chops in air conditioned comfort! Although there were no customers then, the waiting time was less than 15 minutes.

A cafe attached to handloom clothing store - it's not what you will expect, but once you step in, you won't be disappointed. The first thing to notice here is the rustic ambience, with copper glasses and wooden furniture. Plus, as a sucker for natural light, I was drawn to the glass wall that let in so much sunlight! The menu includes everyday bengali dishes, and my friends and I picked what we went in for - luchi and kosha mangsho. Each plate, with four luchis and mutton pieces, was enough for a single glutton like me. The luchis were perfectly puffy, and the mutton dish was beautifully cooked; it's bound to remind a foodie Bangali of the good, soul-satisfying curry that he has grown up devouring. If the service had been slightly faster, the experience would be absolutely perfect.

This quaint place behind the more popular boutique is doing quite a good job at preserving the tradition of bengal. Although a tad bit overpriced, the food takes you to the rural parts where you can taste the 'maati' in the food.. not literally. The luchi and mangsho here was quite mouthwatering as was the fish fry, a nostalgic smell of fried river fish and kashundi, a local mustard sauce . The decor although modern is splashed with little tinkers that reflect the rich artistry of bengal. Kudos to the administration for coming up with the idea. The interior design was done by a well known architect , but the soul of this place is the art that they have housed

The eatery called 'Canteen' sits in the backdrop of glitters of a handloom called 'Byloom', which is in itself a huge crowd puller! But since food interests me most I loved the canteen more maybe :) It has two dining sections and I somehow loved the outdoor seating more which still has glass covering and AC, and there is a lovely small fountain and a hint of greenery at one end that looks so soothing, and helps you settle down real fast. A perfect joint for adda with friends or family if you are near Gariahat or Golpark. Last time we ordered for several plates of their signature 'Luchi o Mangsho' along with glasses of the drink called Kalmanjari. This combination truly constitutes the perfect quintessential Bengali meal if you are not keen to go for something heavier. The perfect Bengali style Mutton curry had thick gravy with perfect balance of spice and flavour. Went so well with the luchi or the Bengali style fried puffed breads! In this combo plate you get four large luchis, they were soft yet crispy outside. I devoured it greedily like no one can see me and I can't see anything or anyone else around me :) it was amazing to taste, and the mutton pieces were pretty juicy and not at all stiff. The drink 'Kalmanjari' was very chilled and refreshing, it had a dash of pudina along with fresh green mango pulp. It tasted close to a typical Aam pora shorbot with a minty twist to it, worth a try, especially if you wanna cool down fast. The service is tad slow but hey, who cares if you are in for an adda session over some awesome food! I will surely keep coming back to this genuinely good eatery that concentrates mainly on the food and aims to give a nice, artsy and relaxed ambiance! Do try them out, you'll surely like this charming place which has a touch of vibrancy and art in every element!

Cheers!

The service was very very slow even when the cafe wasn't particularly full. Just a handful of vegetarian options and half of them aren't usually available. Their cold beverages aren't even served cold during the peak of summer. The only reason I managed to spend close to an hour in the cafe is because the people at the table adjacent to mine were having an interesting conversation.

Nothing like an aam pora sherbet on a hot HOT day with classic Bengali food in a cool ambience. Small place but very niche, nice niche. Gets crowded at peak hours but then there are enough distractions in the attached shop - handlooms and handicrafts - to soften the waiting during a rush.

Byloom is always enticing with it's exclusive collection of sarees and merchandise and even more with "Canteen@Byloom" being a part of it. The charming little cafe tucked on the back end of the famed boutique, is a perfect place to relax and unwind on a lazy afternoon.

Located in one of the quieter streets of Hindustan Park, the easiest way to reach would be to take the street bang opposite to Basanti Devi College and as you walk straight take the second lane towards your left. The cafe on the ground floor, instantly catches one's attention with it's big signboard in red. A wooden board placed by the entrance reads out the menu of the day. The inside is cosy and very aesthetically done with the bright colorful upholstery beautifully complementing the pastel yellow walls and the dark brown wooden tables. The sofas have comfy cushions one can lean on, so I mostly prefer the indoors. The backyard which doubles up as the outdoor seating area has recently been revamped with a glass enclosure and is fully air-conditioned. The place looks absolutely beautiful with the decorative white lights and colorful wooden benches as dusk sets in.

The menu includes mostly Bengali appetizers, light meals, desserts and a few beverages. A tinkling​ of the bell and one of the staff rushes in to take the order. Here's what we settled in for today's visit:

⏹Kalmanjari - It's more or less like the Aam porar sherbet (A Bengali classic drink made from the pulp of raw mango) with the cooling effects of crushed mint leaves. Tangy and refreshing!
⏹Fish n Chips - Three delicate fillets of bhetki fried with a coat of cornflakes served with a tartar dip. The fish tasted nice and fresh with the cornflakes giving off a nice crunch. The spoiler was the fresh fries that came alongside, less in quantity and no seasoning.
⏹Whiskey-Walnut, Rum-Raisin cakes - The whiskey-walnut cake was okayish with a slight whiff of the whisky and filled with walnuts. The Rum-raisin cake was very dry and gave off a wierd after taste had to be left alone. Gonna stay away from the cakes!

The service is laid-back and at times very slow. (One needs to ring the bell every time for service) But then again, the very idea is take your own time to soak in and relax without receiving those uncomfortable glares. So I'm not complaining! Notable absentee from the menu at this time of the year, were the icecreams.😼 Food being nothing to rave about, the pocket pinch is definitely high😼..all of the stuff came to 590 INR (with taxes). Despite the glitches, the soothing ambience always makes me come back for a quick bite and to rest those tired feet after a shopping spree in and around..

(Looking forward to try the Luchi-Mangsho and the newly introduced Paratha platter.😺)

Located inside Byloom, it is a cozy place with good interiors. We order the Mangshor Chop and a Darjeeling tea. The taste was good and so was the portion. I personally liked the space behind the shop that had benches painted of different colour that gave it a somewhat giddy appearance. overall it is a place that you can visit for snacks and refreshments. cheers.

In true sense it is a Bangali canteen with yummy bengali delicacies..Must try are the Fish and chips, Mangshor chop~ these are simply mouthwatering and others. Special mention for Caramel pudding it simply melts in mouth and the caramel is very light and tasty..Would love to head back to taste Luchi and Mangsho..

The place where I want to come again and again. Mangoshor chop, cheese chilli toast and tea, I always love to order. If byloom canteen organise any special buffet or something like that, I will definitely come. After renovation, I like this place more because I can seat in outside every time.

The cafe named Canteen placed at backside of the boutique store byloom is one little cozy joint serving snackies and beverages. A small room with 3-4 tables makes an indoor seating , while the outside seating area at the backyard has a glass ceiling and thankfully air-conditioned. Canteen style pastel painted tables and benches gives a quirky touch.

Ordered one Fish and Chips with cup of hot coffee. The fish and chips was good enough ,nothing to brag much but the coffee at Rs 70  was sad, thin and watery . However i liked the cookies that came along.  The prices are quite high for the servings , would certainly like to go back for trying some more stuff.

Located inside Byloom, it is a cozy place with good interiors. We order the Mangshor Chop and a Darjeeling tea. The taste was good and so was the portion. I personally liked the space behind the shop that had benches painted of different colour that gave it a somewhat giddy appearance. overall it is a place that you can visit for snacks and refreshments. cheers.

Went today for evening adda!! And I was pleased. Its a well done cafe,and the outdoor seating area is the best. Only thing, a bit of light Bengali folk music would have been better and would have suited the ambience. We ordered mutton chop and whiskey walnut cake. The mutton chop was really tasty and was not at all oily! The cake was soft and filled with walnuts,but a light drizzle of whiskey I guess..which could be smelt but not tasted. Overall it was a satisfactory endeavour.

Byloom - known for their exclusive collection of sarees
Canteen@byloom - probably it is famous for its luchi mangsho but I went there at time of cha, that means evening & had Chai (served with orange cookies), chicken wings (extremely tasty, perfect blend of spices) & mangshor chop (I found it bland, honestly), the filling was more of potato & peanuts, and less mutton. Decor is beautiful & subtle with both outdoor & indoor seating arrangements. Perfect place for bangaliana adda after shopping over a cup of cha with appetizers!!

Yesterday (23/02/2017) I purchased a portion (3pieces) of fish fry from byloom cafe. I enquired about the kind and quality of fish they use. They informed me that fresh sweet water bhetki fish is used in the item. They charged Rs 287/- for this dish. While eating I found that this was the lousiest fish fry ever I have taken. The batter is made of cornflakes, which is absolutely yaaky and more importantly, the fish was definitely not fresh water bhetki, instead I could not ascertain what it was but it was at least a couple of weeks old. As a result, it lacked any taste of flavour. Please think twice before buying any item, disappointment is inevitable, I can assure you. 
This I consider an utter fraud that this restaurant is committing.

This is a small cafe inside a handloop shop in Hindustan Park. They have recently renovated the place and i absolutely love the new decor with the satin clothes and extremely soothing white lights. The food is average but the prices are a little on the higher side. Service is slow specially during the peak hours. Recommended for a quick bite if you are out there shopping or hopping anywhere nearby.

Located in the alleys of Hindustan Park. The Byloom showroom leads to this cafe in the interior. The place is compact, can accommodate 4-5 others at one go. Yet has a  peaceful ambience for the same reason. Dimly lit place which serves decent food. 
We ordered Fish and Chips along with fresh lime soda. The fish was good. Crispy on the outside and so much succulent when you bite on. The fries were rather bland, didn't have salt at all. I'm still confused what cream was served along, mayonnaise maybe which didn't taste like the usual one. 
Fresh lime soda was well made. 
Taxes are separately charged, and we paid a amount of Rs.374.

When you heart is filled with appreciation for the lovely stuff on display at the Byloom boutique, your nose will get the whiff of a mutton chop and your tummy will protest for its fill too. The whiff you get is from  The Canteen @ Byloom located at the back of the building that houses the boutique. Done up minimally but artistically as expected, the small pretty cafe also has an outdoor seating absolutely perfect for winters. 
The menu is limited but will still keep you speculating since most choices are equally tempting. Will it be the mutton chop or the mini chicken moglai? Will the fish roll lose out to the chicken cutlet? Or will it be all of them? Or will you say no to them all and get your fill of luchi and mangsho? As and when you decide, there is a tiny bell on the table (pic attached) that you ring to call for service. We sipped our drinks, coconut water with lime and honey and soaked in the  tastefully done environs. The food is nice and the mutton chops deserve a special mention. I know i have mentioned mutton chops in this review multiple times, but I just can't get over them!) 
While art galleries and cafés attached to them is not really a very new concept, Byloom surely brings it  wonderfully 
alive in Kolkata

Canteen@Byloom will give you a very different feeling altogether because of their ambiance specially. With an outside sitting arrangement along with lovely decor this place attracts me over and over again.

##Location: At Hindustan Park on the back side of the Byloom Boutique.

##Experience: Fish and chips is a must try dish here. Crunchy crispy outside quoting with soft and best quality fish used tastes heavenly in your mouth with a cup of your favorite hot beverage alongside. Though the service is slow but its worth a wait and specially the feel of the ambiance gets better with food.

I love this place a lot.. specially the ambience in outdoor sitting.The candlelights,climber shrubs,the lighting..it's so romantic.But it remains closed during the rainy season.The service is not that good.Water is not filled unless u ask for it repeatedly and they have a tendency to serve the tea/coffee at the end of the snacks which sucks because by that time those munchies get over or if u save them to have it with the beverage it gets cold.

But still I come here only for the sake of their fish and chips.The fish fry have a unique coating of cornflakes which makes it extra crispy on the outside with soft fresh flaky fish inside.Love the tartare dip they serve it with.I personally liked their masala tea more than the coffee.. though I am a coffee person.Coffee isn't that strong here and is a bit watery.I even tried the pressed coffee here which they claimed to be fresh filter coffee.But it wasn't that strong too.The cookies they serve with the beverage are absolute delight.They melt in mouth and are full of nuts.I also had their luchi mangsho which I found to be good but nothing extraordinary.Thanks to my mother who makes this dish a lot better so I am very hard to please when it comes to eating Bengali cuisine outside my home.

I keep coming back here only for the fish and chips.

When you want Bengali fast food but want it really slow head here. The store and canteen complement each other and when you sit inside its almost like you are having lunch at your Boro mashis house somewhere in north Kolkata. Love the kosha mangsho luchi , chop cutlets and the fish fry. Beware and be prepared to meet every body and their ex's .

This is the place to be if you are a lover of art and Bangaliana. Adjoining the beautiful Byloom boutique is the cafe with both indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is situated in a quiet backyard of a typical South Calcutta house. You will love the antique lanterns with which the place is decorated. The decor is minimum but heartwarming. Though I haven't had the opportunity to visit it in the evening but I heard that lamps are lit which makes the place look extremely romantic. Coming to the indoor seating I fell in love with it. Traditional bamboo work chairs on a typically black and white floor of the yesteryear Calcutta look so inviting. A dash of colours is brought in with the bright hues of the cushions and a posters that decorate the wall. Decor wise I give the place a 5 on 5. Coming to the food I loved their chicken cutlet and found it adequately priced. The coconut water with lime and honey is one to die for and nothing can soothe you better than it on a hot summer day. The Aampora shorbot is delightful too. I intend to try out the other dishes served by them. Yes, the price is a bit high but that is often the case with most of the well decorated places.

Canteen @ Byloom is a refreshment in Kolkata's Cafe which is giving a makeover to the traditional Cafe concept and menu. This is not a stand alone restaurant, but rather a extended refreshment unit of a clothing botique. However it has become quite popular among the foodies in very short time with its exciting concepts, vibrant menu & great quality.

The menu comprises of bengali & continental food, mainly snacks.

It's small room with cozy seating. It may make you feel a little uncomfortable if occupied to full capacity. There is also outside seating which I would like to check out in future.

But food is the king here. We started with honey coconut water. It was great. The we tried Chicken Cilantro, Grilled fish & luchi mangso platter. The food totally blown me away. Each dish was unique, flavourfull & best quality indredients used. Grilled fish with lemmon butter & grilled veggies was much better than many so called legendary restaurants. Luchi were cooked in ghee & mangso was mutton curry with flavour of garam masala. Mutton peices were extemely soft.

We ended up with Nolen gurer ice cream which was revolutionary.

Overall, it was a great experience & I just can't wait to come to Kolkata & visit tis place again. Basically it is one of the places which makes me miss my city so much.

If you love to dig into sumptuous snacks and milk tea- the bangali way, after a good shopping spree, then this is the place for you! The canteen is split into two sections. One is for the AC lovers and the other is for the ones who like to gaze into the open sky while sipping hot tea. The decor is bright and happy with posters from old Bangla films which will keep you enticed as you savour the taste of mutton with loochi and cholar daal.

My first visit to this place for the fish fry. I must say it was pretty good and unique. While the outside of the fry was more like cornflakes coated KFC style crispy fried chicken, the core was milky white and buttery soft Kolkata Bhetki.
3 medium to large such fries for Rs. 210 with some French fries was quite reasonable. They gave us Tartar sauce, tomato ketchup, chilli sauce and mustard sauce as condiments.
VAT and Govt. Service tax were added in the bill. However, I did not find the VAT no. or the Service tax no. of the restaurant in the bill. The management should look into this.
Service was prompt and staffs were courteous. Decor was minimalistic but clean and elegant.

We specifically came for the fish and chips. Wow... The fish was succulent and boneless, great with the sweet mayo dip. The batter was fresh, crispy and quite unique as it was made with cornflakes which added to the crispy texture. I loved the simple fish flavour, no masala or spice. They also served biscuits with our coffee, the biscuits were made with cornflakes, very interesting indeed! Only one thing I'd change is to serve more chips with the fish and chips, otherwise I'm looking forward to going back already!

A nice place with a well to do decor, both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements making it accessible for the smokers also.
Now come the unique way of calling the waiter that is a bell was placed on each table for calling them.
The quality and the price of the food goes hand in hand. Specially the gandhoraj ice was the item I loved the most. Beside this all the item were good enough.
In short a proper not atall expensive place to hang around with friends on weekends.

Canteen @ byloom disappointed me and left my pockets burning. Although the location is great and you have to convenience to shop and then drop down at the same place to eat, the food is hugely overpriced and the service I not that great. We had ordered Luchi and Pathar mangsho (Flat bread and red meat curry). The taste was great but overpriced by a huge margin which leaves you cringing as your mother can give you the same meal in a more greater shape absolutely for free. Not worth it.

Good Bengali food with a cozy ambience. Kosha mangsho, luchi, fish fry was a hit combo. 
But the 2nd time I went shopping there, I chose to dine at the nearby Kasturi l, which I found to be much more reasonably priced and a definite taste champion! My suggestion: Bylooom shopping, kasturi dining

A nice place with a well to do decor, both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements making it accessible for the smokers also.
Now come the unique way of calling the waiter that is a bell was placed on each table for calling them.
The quality and the price of the food goes hand in hand. Specially the gandhoraj ice was the item I loved the most. Beside this all the item were good enough.
In short a proper not atall expensive place to hang around with friends on weekends.

Visited this place quite a few times. Located inside this boutique called byloom, this place is a must visit. The food may be a little pricey but j promise it's worth it. The ambience is cozy. You can call the waiter by ringing a bell that's kept on the table.even outdoor seating is available. I've tried fish and chips, chicken steak , chicken wrapped in bacon, chicken cutlet and coffee . also they will fill the tiny bowl of dip they provide with certain dishes the second time without charging anything extra. The fresh lime soda is also decent. 
Happy eating!

I visit Byloom once in a while when I need to gift my mother a saree or get a gift for somebody and the shopping is followed by inevitably grabbing a bite in this cosy, peaceful and homely canteen. The mangshor chop, luchi - kosha mangsho, the fish n chips and fish fries ought to be tried. You may call it "over-priced" but then you could spend on such a menu, once in a while. :)

Went there to actually check out the boutique collection, instead stumbled upon this quaint corner cafe. Done up with yellow walls and red furniture gives you the instant vibe of a lazy afternoon adda. There are posters adorning the wall musing about Uttam-Suchitra and Audrey.The ambiance is simple yet charming.

 Coming to the food, we were already full so just went ahead with chicken cilantro and a lot of gup-shup. The chicken cilantro, though was a perfect spicy condiment to the spicy chat. Done up with a perfect mix of spices and herbs, this tender baby gets a thumbs up from me.

One thing though, the price in the menu shouted not your ordinary hangout place. Haven't tried the other dishes, but will surely go back soon. 
There is a ghonta on the table to summon the staff, and no matter how many times i kept ringing it, they rushed in. So if you're on a bad date, do keep ringing the bell. :pThe staff and the ambiance gets a thumbs up from me. :)

Very interesting place.

The ground floor of a typical old South Kolkata building houses this joint which itself is an extension of the hand loom store outside.

It works because of the wackiness of a small room with small tables and small chairs with small pillows and a small window with a large menu outside the room and two large posters and also the large portions.

I asked for chicken pakora and green tea.They said they did not have green tea which I found a little odd but settled for Darjeeling instead.In Kolkata the chicken pakora is a little like the chilli chicken.....there are a million versions of it including the Chinese,Bengali and the esplanade version of the same.

This was the Bengali version and though a little charred,it had solid chunks of chicken which were fresh and juicy and very hot and was served with a great chutney.Service can improve a notch.

The tea was good as well and I am definitely coming back for more....

It is a hidden gem, literally it is, in the truest sense of the term!!
Hidden behind 2 rooms of boutique of byloom in the by lanes of Hindustan park (in the next lane of Krystal chopstick), this beautifully decorated little canteen is a gem, which I learnt about, thanks to a friend of mine and confirmed by zomato.
Perfect evening ambience accentuated by the dim, decorative lights, we, my wife and I were welcomed in by a courteous attendant. We got ourselves a nice little corner seat.
We decided our order beforehand, and it was its famous fish n chips along with a chicken sandwich and amporar shorbot.
We tingled the bell and the attendant attended to our food order.
The shorbot was immediately served in a tall glass, it tasted nice, spicy and refreshing.
Immediately the fish n chips were served. It is something for which I have less words to describe. It was 3 pieces of big, tender fillets of fish,perfectly coated n fried crisply to our hearts content and tongues delight. I tried this dish in many different restaurants, food stalls but none did even come close to what I tasted yesterday from them. It was the definition of delicious.
The sandwich followed shortly, it was okayish. It was 2 pieces of sandwich prepared with chicken salami n mayonnaise stuffed inside mildly oil fried bread. Not even near the fish n chips, taste wise. But then we ordered it, so no complaints.
Next time, I hope to try their chicken satay, cilantro and grilled fish. Bet they'll be awesome too.
Its a small place with lots of demand. So prepare yourself for a queue time.

Crazy food. Brilliant Luchi and Kosha Mangsho. Exotic and flavorful Mutton Chops. Super crispy Fish'n'Chips. But the drinks were absolutely mind blowing. Aam Porar Sherbet is spicy and lip smacking and the Coconut Water with Lime and Honey is to die for. 

Many trips pending.

Have been there for a number of times. They serve really good food at a really cheap price. Since I have been there for a number of times, I have tasted all of their dishes. Of which I like the Fish and Chips to be the best. They have the real British essence serving with an awesome tartar sauce. On the other hand, Chicken Cilantro and Luchi Mangsho are also good. On a hot summer day, the Sweet Lime Water refreshes you and the Aam Pora Sharbat takes you to the other level. But I don't like the Mangsher Chop because it's awkwardly big in size and tastes horrible. They have really nice seating arrangements where one can backrest with colourful cushions and provisions for chair are also present. There is an open air seating arrangement which is available only during winter. They make really nice candle light arrangements for you in a winter evening if you wish to sit outside. Byloom is more famous for its handloom items, especially sarees. But paying a visit to its canteen and trying their Fish and Chips is a must. Happy Dining! :)

If you are looking for a quaint, cosy place to gorge on some favourite Bengali snacks. Then this is the place to be.
The fish and chips is a personal favourite. And the luchi-mangsho is excellent. 
Be it a day out with your mum or a meet with a friend. This place is a treat to be in !

A small snacketaria attached to the Handloom Shop "Byloom" in Hindustan Park! Meant for shoppers and visitors! It has on its menu beverages and snacks Bengali as well as continental. Two popular items here are Mangshor Chop and Fish and Chips apart from Luchi Mangsho Fish Orly etc. Menu is long one for this small place and therefore they hang up on the Board Day's Items.
Tried their Mutton chops several times there and as Take away and also fish and chips. Quantity used to be large - maybe it has become slightly less of late reflecting inflation. Prices are for a decent eatery and the quantities. The quality of their Mutton Chops and Fish and Chips are outstanding.
The only thing is their cooking time and order delivery time. They perhaps cannot reduce the cooking time considering kitchen limitations and quality requirements.
Recommend this place for afternoon snacks. One plate is sufficient for two persons.

The canteen@byloom- a perfect place to nurture your creative soul while sipping on a cup of freshly brewed Darjeeling tea with a side of delicious home-baked cookies( which comes in gratis with tea/coffee). One must try out their "luchi mangsho" (4pcs of luchi+3 magnum pieces of mutton, cooked in a Bengali style, tangy and spicy gravy) and the "Fish n Chips" ( 3 pieces of fried Basa fillets coated with flakes of corn served with french fries and tartar sauce). Each of the pieces are huge and can easily be shared with 2-3 people. Only sad thing is that they have stopped serving "chicken satay" for the time being. The place remains open till 8pm. Friendly staff,good food,nice boutique. Definitely coming back again.

I went there solely for their food after hearing much about them. I love their coconut water with lime and honey. My father also loved it. Delicious. I loved chicken cilantro, mutton kabiraji and luchi Chholar dal.  The atmosphere is homely and cozy. I wish I could go there more often but of late I don't go by that route.

One of the evenings after a days work looking for some character and coffee. Byloom cafe offers a range of delectable snacks which are simple yet tasty. I tried the mutton cutlets and the cilantro chicken which both had a homely touch to it. Cosy place with an eclectic mix of people where you could spend hours designing your webpage and reflecting on your creative side.

I visit Byloom quite often. I always make it a point to drop in to the Canteen and have a bite. I have tried the Mutton chop, Fish and Chips. They are quite good. It is difficult to get a free table at times. It has an outdoor seating arrangement, which is not practical in the Monsoons.
The Mutton chop was originally hot and spicy, but very tasty.. They have toned down the chillies, but added sweet, which has reduced the taste. The size of the chop is also smaller..
On a recent visit I found that the outdoor has also been converted to an AC room..

Like many others I discovered this place, while shopping at byloom! It is the latest trendsetter in town! Most of the afternoons it is empty where you can sit, have a heart to heart conversation with your pals. And you can be there with anyone! Your mom, grandmom, your friends and anyone! Minimalistic decor but gives a very earthly feel! My personal favourite till last time was mangsher chop, mutton minched round balls with an excellent sauce.. I went there only to have the chop! But last time, I preferred some change and tried their fish and chips! And I loved it.. And grilled fish was also good, but too salty! Overall its a good experience

If you wish to spend a day amidst complete Bangaliyaana, this is the place for you. This is inside a boutique, Byloom which in itself is a place to marvel. An old Calcutta house renovated and transformed, it ll never cease to give out its old world charm. The canteen has everything Bengali, from luchi and mangsho to dimer devil. I love their Masala Cha and Fish and Chips and most of all the ambience.

Made to wait frequently at byloom, for reasons pretty obvious, I find this place a nice way to spend the time. Their dab water with honey is perfect to chill the summer heat, or else they have some press coffee too. A quaint little place, with few but quite good items on the menu. People looking for some heavy stuff can also try their luchi mangsho. 
My only qualm is they close pretty early, at 8. So i kind of have to hurry to finish off my coffee, something which I don't like to at all !!

This was my second visit to Canteen @Byloom... The food average, the fish and chips albeit a little oily was good with good portions of fish fillets with a cornflakes coat... Which rendered it crispy. The chicken wrapped in bacon was hot... In fact too hot for even my "Jhaal" loving palate .... The tea was okay... Nothing to write home about. The biscuits adequate.... The sweet lime soda my friend ordered was fair. I wish the cafe was as amazing as the collection of "buyables" at Byloom.. But it is a nice place for a Sunday evening adda...
Pocket pinch: pocket friendly. :)

Overall an intellectual ambience with a homely cosiness within it, this place will make you feel as if you are sitting in your own drawing room.

Let me tell you that from the outside, you would find this place to be a boutique or a shop but that it is only the curious few who would know there's a cafe along with this shop at the rear . This cafe serves very good continental as well as traditional Bengali food. Had some fish n chips, chicken cutlet,mutton chop and some soda....really impressive service and quite different from other cafes. But one thing is that its open up to 8pm everyday and last order is at 7.15pm....but dont let that turn you off....the food is worth every penny...

I went to Byloom with a friend. The restaurant is tucked away behind a boutique in a quiet part of Gariahat. From the outside, you can't really tell that there is a cozy eat-in there. 
The ambiance is one of romance and seclusion. Waterfall, candle lamps, diyas; it's a beautiful place. I really liked the fact that you ring the bells on the table to call the wait staff, keeps with the seclusive ambiance. The staff were really nice. What I didn't like is the menu. The menu when I went wasn't what is uploaded. Moreover, there wasn't much of a selection; 15-17 items. A little more selection who have been preferred. But the food was good, and quick. I really loved the fish and chips.The bill came up to 450 for a plate of mutton chops, a plate of fish and chips and a fresh lime water. It was a fulfilling dining experience. If the menu had more selections, it'd be better.

This place was in my list since long before I finally visited it yesterday. And am super happy after the treat that canteen@byloom had in store for me.
This cafe has province for both indoor and outdoor sitting. Me and my friend went for the outdoor space as it was airy and nice. After a while when the evening dawned, the waiter lit a candle on our table. It was beautiful! The small bulb chains that hang around gives a cheerful vibe. There is also a fountain at one corner and the sound of the water makes you happy for sure. 

Coming to the food,we ordered coffee and fish and chips. The coffee was good and they served free cookies with it. The cookies tasted great.
The fish and chips here is a treat. The size of the fried fish fillets is good enough. It's crunchy outside and very soft inside. They serve it with a tangy tartar sauce.

The only disappointment maybe the very late service. But it just gave us more time to lay back and chat. The guy serving us was very humble.

I went to byloom's cafe for the first time with my mom... My mom is the best girlfriend I have. And I absolutely loved the place. It's amazing how serene and quiet the place is despite being so near the city's hustle. From the amazing coffee to the great mangsher chop, the food is awesome as well as the total ambience. I personally love to sit outside though the indoor area is amazing too.. The outside area has a rustic and homely feel to it with a  small fountain in a corner and table and benches to sit. The candles that are lit bring about a unique charm to the place. And the two cookies are free with tea and coffee... It feels as if  the cafe is giving you a gift for being there.
Although it is a bit of a pocket pinch its really a great place. Plus the coffee is really affordable and amazing. Worth a try.
A perfect place for a tete-a-tete with your loved one, be it your mom, sister, best friend or the special person in your life!!

I can't even tell you how much I adore this place ! 
I absolutely love this place!! 
From the ambience , to the service, quality, quantity of food.Everything!! 
There are two sitting sections here, out can sit inside and you can choose to sit outside too (that is if you smoke, here's a plus point for you) I prefer the outside sitting. This place is lit up by evening with all the candles which makes it all so mesmerising. 
It's fascinating, how it's in the heart of the city yet it has a place of its own. A tiny place with a lil water fountain in the corner and all the greenery. 
Coming back to the food, luchi mangsho is very very famous here ! 
And of course I was no exception to the luchi mangsho. Well now I know why everyone loves the luchi mangsho. 
Also I had fresh lime soda which again was a perfect blend with the mangsho. And it is extremely easy on the pocket

Well was just surfing through good saree collection in and around lake road when me and my bestie confronted byloom. Went in. Saw an awesome collection of ethnic wear. Especially the meenkari on jackets I loved. Was about to leave when we saw people eating inside a small little room. And that is when I remembered there was a canteen inside byloom.  Since we were hungry we decided on to stay on for a snack. We wanted to sit outdoors but since dusk was approaching, iwe decided on to stay indoors in the small little room. As we entered we say a small yet simply decorated room with chairs , tables and sofa. Since there was a rush we managed to bag a table. The last vacant table. What struck me the most was the Shilpi poster. Amazing it was to see the uttam suchitra poster and felt the bong bug creeping out. We wanted tea desperately. But while surfing the menu what struck me was the honey and lime coconut water. That was quite different, so we ordered. We wanted mangshor chop. That was not available.  The staffs were insisting to have luchi but we didnt want to. We ordered for a chicken satay as they suggested so. The taste was mind blowing. The satay was cooked to such finesse that no complains could be put forward. The mayo and cheese along with peanut sauce over the satay added to the taste. A must try. The good part and a cute feature were those ghontas which u had to ring if u have to call the waiter. It was so cute. I loved it. But there many complaints. Firstly,  the order takes too much time to reach the table. Due to time crunch we could not order anymore as they took ages to prepare. Another fact is that the waiters are just not interested to take the order. At times u have to ring the bell twice.  Lastly,  I believe it is over priced. The quantity isnt ample. The service charge is far beyond their service. For a satay and 2 drink, the bill is not expected to shoot up to 460 rupees. But nonetheless its worth experincing.

Me and my bestie wanted to meet and spend some quality time together. We searched this joint on zomato and decided to give it a shot. It is very small joint with limited seats. We wanted to have mangsher chop but it was not available. We also ordered some other recipes but they were not available then. We then ordered coconut water with lemon and honey and chicken satay. Though i loved the taste and quality but quantity is very less and overpriced. Service is poor.. We had to wait long to be served.

I chanced to go to this place after passing it off as just a shop for clothes on few occasions. I went there with two friends of mine and the moment I entered the place, the huge picture of "Shilpi" captured my mind. More, because the lights and the small sofas surrounded with various colored cushions were setting a brilliant contrast to the it. The moment you enter, you get this very French set-up with the most humble "Bangaliana", ever. Coming to food, please try the fish and chips because the tartar sauce and the soft and succulent fish they provide is absolutely mind boggling. You cannot finish hogging until you realize you're full because you just ate 3 big pieces of fish just worth 175. 

Inference: Pocket Pinch= Little. Also, try the Chicken Satay with quite considerable amount of chicken on the stick and a very juicy barbecue sauce.I already went there twice within a gap of one week and would probably continue going there, for quite sometime now.

This is really a cute little cafe, and I like the fact that they call it the 'canteen'. Like South Indians have their dosa/idli canteens, this place is like our own Bangali canteen which serves 'hinger kochuri with aloor phoron', 'koraishutir kochuri', 'luchi mangsho', 'moghlai', 'luchi cholar daal' and 'mochar chop'! Heavenly! They serve coffee too, and of course the sweet lover in me cannot ignore the caramel custard. And there are an array of other interesting items like khaosuey, pita pockets and sandwiches, and coconut water with honey and lime! Wow! Full marks for a tight, eclectic menu!
The seating arrangement is comfortable though the place is tiny. Service is not so slow as I had expected (though some items may be seasonal or may take more time than usual, which I think is very OK). The pricing is very reasonable and staff friendly. It can be a cool hangout for a lazy, true-bred bong Sunday morning brunch and adda.

This is the place to rest your tired feet when you had a long day shopping in and around Gariahat. The bonus is that Byloom itself hosts beautiful hand-loom and handcrafted products. The usual items that you can get in any odd day include samosas, tea, coffee, kochuri chholar daal. On special occasions Byloom canteen offers grand feast, that are available as per prior reservations. But on regular days, since mostly people visit to shop, the service and maintenance may not be like regular eateries. The higher rating is mainly for the grand feasts which are awesome balance of quality and price.

Relax,chat have a peaceful time over a cup of coffee or snacks, doing complete justice to your tastebuds if that's what you want then canteen@byloom is your ultimate destination. Don't actually remember when did i have such a relaxing time in cafe with no waiters eager to take order as soon as you take a seat.

Its basically a boutique wid a canteen inside for ladies to chitchat bt you will be wrong if u thing that only ladies and girls hangout there. Reached at around 6:30 in the evening and it was a bliss to see the lovely outdoor seating lit with candles. Though it was quite hot and despite of the ac room with comfortable seating we preferred it outside as there wasn't much crowd out there. 

Coming to the food. We ordered fresh lime soda, aam porar shorbot and mangshor chop. Fresh lime soda was made perfect as i ordered less sweet, mangshor chop was simply oshadharooon! Cooked to perfection. The aam porar shorbot was a bit disappointing as it wasn't chilled though it was mentioned at the ordering time as they had some fridge not working properly issues.

The service though not very prompt but we were dealt with care. The outdoors surrounded by high rises wasn't airy but i like it as it is rather i am in love with the place.

Knowing well that my statement could raise a few eyebrows ,I have no qualms in admitting that I enjoy my food more in a nicely done up place !  (confession) . Canteen @byloom is one of those places. I usually make it a point to drop by this cosy and aesthetically rejuvenating joint whenever I go shopping in and around gariahat golpark …. And my preference for sitting changes from indoors to outdoors depending on the season !  Some recommended dishes from their short and simple menu are the refreshing Coconut water with lime and honey, the wholesome Chicken cutlets ,Chicken pita pockets and the Chicken samosa for the samosa loving bong  .An ideal place for adda/gossip ;) … the only downside could be a delayed service but then I am not complaining …

Surrounded by concrete highrises on all sides, the outdoor seating area, with its dark setting and yellow lights, full with candles and a mini waterfall, paints an eerie picture in the evening. The chops and cutlets served are actually good. Definitely a good place for an evening adda session with friends in the winter.

This place came as a surprise as I was browsing through some Indian ethnic wear, since it is located inside an ethnic wear outlet (byloom), almost hidden from view. It was late evening and the outdoor setting looked brilliant with the tiny candles on the wall twinkling in their glory. By the looks of it , it was the most inviting cafe, enticing even. However being extremely full due to late lunch , I visited later that month.
 It wasn't late evening, so the candles were not lit yet. However we still chose the outdoor seating area. Although the indoor seating looks just as comfortable.The menu is quite interesting, They provide you with bells to ring for service and the servers are friendly and quick.
Now coming to the disappointing part. We ordered for Egg Mushroom Cheese Parantha, and Chicken Shamoshik. First came the Parantha and it looked quite nice. However with the first bite I realised something was wrong with it. It tasted nothing of chicken or cheese. The egg attached to the parantha was half done. And the mushrooms I think were stale. So the only taste I received from this mixture was a bitter gooey taste, and that's it. It was traumatic to go through on entire parantha let alone three! :/ Added ketchup to hide its taste, however it hardly helped. 
The Chicken Shamoshik was way better,. Its like Samosa, but the outside is crispier, and the chicken inside was beautifully done. I in fact loved these. Could have had another plate of this if I didn't have another place to visit later! 
The Paranthas were such a big disappointment that I cannot, (eventhough I want to), rate this place any higher. I will visit soon to try more from their menu and I am hopeful my second experience would be better than my first. 
Great ambiance.
Great service.

J had been requesting to come to this place but I had been revolting for quite sometime now. Finally came a day  when classes got cancelled and with a crunchy pocket and no where to go J, S and I landed here.
I was pretty worried about my pocket crunch and constantly frowned at both my mates.
J was exceptionally calm as he consoled me saying that this place is extremely pocket friendly and I though not so convinced, agreed.

Byloom Cafe is basically a handloom shop offering sarees, potpourri, handcrafted items, shoes and lots more. Inside it, has a small little cafe at the right end with indoor/outdoor seating. Trust me it is just B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L !
I liked the indoor seating more than the outdoor one. The outdoor seating has blue benches and also acts as a smoking zone. But that day, I was in the mood for some "lyadh" so decided to chill inside.
The indoor seating is pretty. Though the tables are cramped, but the cushions and sofas make up for it. The walls also have movie posters on them. J, S and I lazily chatted about for quite sometime now. Then we decided to order something.

So, the order placed was :

Fresh Lime Soda (sweet)
Fish n chips
Alu Hinger kochuri
Brownie
Caramel Custard

Now now, the surprise element. The food is dirt cheap here. A tall glass of fresh lime soda is only for INR 50/-
The fish n chips followed in no time. The fish is coated in crunchy cornflakes and tastes good. I liked it.
It came with fries which was nice and a delicious dip of tartare sauce. Now I have this huge soft corner for tartare sauce and I couldn't help but order one more helping.

Now, I got no clue about the alu ar hinger kochuri because J and S finished it within the blink of an eye and I was too busy nibbling at the fish.
After that, we were having a sweet craving so went ahead with the caramel custard and brownie which is priced at INR 60/- each.
The caramel custard was more of a pudding but I really liked it. The brownie was nothing extraordinary but thankfully had the bitter aftertaste which I like so I was happy with my share.

I am definitely coming back for more because this place made me so happy and I would make it a point to buy something from here too.
Cheers! :)

This place was introduced to me by a friend of mine.

A couple of things about this place that scored points in my books are...

1: Decor:: Once you enter you find yourself amidst a boutique ,I was confused if this a cafe or something else, But the rainbow of hues and designs works as a warm welcome & seduces ones senses uplifting it.

2 The main cafe is divided into two parts ::
a:: Non-smokers sections in a room with colourful comfy cushion of vibrant hues
b:: the smokers section outside has benches & tables with a fountain at the corner with lanterns & lamps adorning the  wall which they light with candles in the evening giving it a very aesthetic look, they even place table candles giving a touch of shakespearean romance to it.

3:: To place your order one has to ring a bell which is provided at every table which to me is quirky.

4: Food::
Chicken Mughlai- I simply would say its one of the best I ever had, they slice up the mughlai is small slices so as to make it even more easy for you,along with that the patato curry provided is a tinge bit spicy with small pieces of potato makes it even better and two small cup full of sauces which makes the taste even more delicious. The Mughlai is well stuffed and the layering of wheat is medium ,thus one doesn't have to chew too much before you can dig into the main ingredients. Just one let down they should work on oil factor which is a bit high.

Fresh Lime Soda:: They serve you fresh lime in this real real long glass, after you finish it you will surely have a biggest buro in ages... coz not only the fresh lime they is super tasty & tangy,the sheer amount is a hell lot.

Caramel Custard:: A must try, the custard is not only soft as its well made to the hilt. As you cut into it,its hardly breaks off but once can slice though it perfectly,thus given credit to its being cooked well and the taste is a sheer delight to the taste buds as you put it into your mouth, the dollops will simply melt away leaving a lovely feel.

Visiting Calcutta for the very first time with my family. We landed at Byloom for shopping. After a good four hours we wanted to sit down for a snack. We gave the tiny little cafe at Byloom itself a shot and we were not disappointed. The cafe is cute and charming. The menu is limited but more than sufficient for a cafe. After we placed an order for some tea, samosas and cutlets we were busy going through the collection of handmade paper rolls, books and mugs at the store. The food was great and simple. The service was decent as well. A nice place to sit and relax after a long tiring day.

They have an outdoor as well as an indoor section. though the indoor section looks very cosy with loads of colourful cushions to lean on, I personally prefer the very minimalistic outdoor section. It has a very clean and crisp decor with wooden chairs and benches, a small fountain in one corner. Sometimes they place a candle in your table and I just love that! 
I mostly go there to have a nice cup of steaming tea with the orange cookies they serve it with, but last day i was quite hungry and ordered khao-suey. It brought a smile to my face the moment it landed on the table in front of me and the balance of flavours were perfect. The variety of condiments to go with it added a new dimension to the main dish in every bite. I felt i was in the middle of a great experiment trying one condiment or the other, or quite a few together with every spoonful. I think i will be forced to order it every time i go from now on. 
But yes there is one major drawback of the byloom cafe, which is, not all things on their menu are available at all times.

My friend and I decided to hit this place for a cup of coffee one evening. It is near New Hindustan sweets. My friend ordered a tea while I went for the coffee. my coffee was okay - nothing to write home about, but they were served with biscuits, not too sweet, crunchy and nice. I liked the outdoor setting where you can smoke and talk without being interrupted and the service was nice. More than the cafe itself, I was in love with the sarees and clothes I saw here. Must come back again to buy a couple of them.

Update: Went there today and got the fish and chips, chicken sandwich and tea. The service was slow but agreeably so, and the sandwich was good. the fish was slightly oily, but big pieces of fish fillet fried in cornflakes made it quite crunchy, and it was served with a cream  tartar sauce. Also, we were severely happy with the mutton chop: one of the bests in the city, not to mention the tall glass of chilled fresh lime soda which kept us going through the heat. The Greek salad was a disappointment though - just a bunch of salad randomly thrown together.

I went to ByLoom cafe  for the first time with my family today. Their store is also lovely but  would be glad to return just for the food! Everything we ordered was excellent. The mutton chop was to die for! Other things we enjoyed include the chicken samosas and chilli cheese toasts. It also has a warm homely vibe which we enjoyed. I would definitely recommend this if you're looking for some snacks, coffee and adda.

I happened to walk in with a friend (on his recommendation) yesterday evening. We sat outside and thankfully there was a slight breeze which made it pleasant. The surroundings were a little cramped with the houses all around. What was a little out of place was the sound of someone having a bath and then coughing loudly from a bathroom nearby!

We ordered just two items. Masala Tea and Chicken Sandwich. The tea was decent enough. Thankfully not readymade, and had ginger and slight spices. Came with sugar cubes served separately. The sandwich was passable. Slightly overpriced at INR 100 plus tax. The bread seemed soggy which made it not toast too well. The accompanying fries were very tasty.

They have a limited menu, which is kind of okay.

The food was served very quickly, which was a plus. We didn't see the waiter after that and had to pay the bill at the counter.

Who ever came up with the earth-shattering idea of a cafe inside Byloom is very clever. Why? I'll explain in the next few paragraphs.

Women love to shop. ByLoom was started to pull such weak women in and it does a very good job at it. I am one such victim who goes regularly.

Women love gossip. Women love to talk and no matter their phone bills they will still and always continue their gossiping.

Women love to eat. Period!

Byloom cafe, very smarty, combines these above three traits and gives you ByLoom Cafe. *whoosh*

Cafe: Set in one small corner of the shop. There is a blackboard outside giving you the day's specials in big and bold. Also has a peek-a-boo view of the shop. There are two parts to it. The inside is thanda done up in comfortable cushions and rich colours and those little tables which are so typical of Parisian cafes. There are two movie posters on the wall. The outside is done up in solid sky blue tables and benches. Very chic! 

Menu: Limited and changes every day. It has a mix of common-everybody-loves-this items. You will definitely find something you like here. There are vegetarian items like chilli cheese toasts and pita pockets and non-vegetarian items like momos etc. The drinks have a good variety.

Food: Decent. I won't say it's delicious and I won't say it's bad. But whatever I order I finish it to the last bite and order more (relax+gossip). Everything is cooked well. The drinks like aam shorbot and cold coffee are great.

Portions: Perfect for their pricing. Can be easily shared between 2 or passed around. 
Service and other things: Service is quick. If you want extra ketchup or sthing then the bus-boy will get 'em quick without a frown. I know this because I always want extra ketchup with my chilli cheese toasts. You don't ask about the kitchen and crowd because it is ByLoom. The drinks are done up nicely. I tried the French press Arabica once and it was amazing.

I give this place a 3. I love a visit with my girls.
