Mainly a take away counter type. Has variety of items to order from. Don't go by the look or the space of the shop as the food is what matters and most of the items are pretty good. Best part is if you're living around then you can order almost anytime for a home delivery and they will deliver pretty quickly. Overall nice place to take away or for home delivery for small party.

On a rainy afternoon...cheap and home delivered food...best option...nothing beats it...Maybe not the best food you will ever have...but worth the price and best thing is home delivery for free.....

I have never been happy with any food from this shop, except probably the plain, handmade rotis on days mum feels too tired to whip those up. Sides are absolutely unremarkable, and as far as I can remember, most meals from this shop have given us food poisoning. The shop, however, attracts customers, probably because it's fast and inexpensive, and that has made the owner pretty cocky. Have had far better food at other pocket-friendly roadside eateries.

I have had Momos,Parantha,Tarka etc from this place as it was bang opposite to were I stayed till sometime ago. However, the only thing decent were the Momos especially considering the price which was Rs.45/- The rest was simply unedible and is best avoided.It's a roadside eatery with nothing to boast about.

Not bad. Chicken roll was reasonable for an appetite emergency. Local food joint like people reviewed. Very ordinary. Get the food and leave that's it.

Nothing special to talk about, the chicken roll was good though...it's like a para joint so everything is like any other street food joint..

Just had noodles at laziz, the quantity and pricing is good but the taste is not up to the mark. they need to work on that.
we have to rely on this joint because of location, we deserve better food.
