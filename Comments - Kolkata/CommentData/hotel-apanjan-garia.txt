Simple indian eatary house. Nothing fancy about it. Had takeaways multiple times. Preparation s are slightly oily. Affordable and service is quick. Visit If you don't bother about hygiene and doesn't want to burn a hole in pocket.

This is just another food joint who transforms from mat bhaat hotel in the morning to ruti torkar dokan in the evening. Recently they have renovated and upgraded their menu card. The quality and quantity both are good.

This your daily eat out type of joint. They serve everything, from mach bhaat, rolls, momo, biriyani, Chinese, north Indian. they are open till 1am. This joint is always crowded. try their kashmiri alur dum. It is more of a alu rezala, I bet you have not tasted like this before.

This place is a regular maach bhaat type restaurant, which pops up with a fast food joint in the evening. 

The best thing you can get here is the Moghlai paratha - the original Bengali kind. The Chicken cutlets and the rolls are good as well. 

Wouldn't recommend the Chicken pakoras - chewy and more cabbage than chicken !!!

a small outlet at sitalamandir more garia always crowded. serving various kind of foods....rolls/rotis/tarka/chicken side dishes/egg side dishes etc etc. but my preference is their tikia-a side dish goes well with rotis or parathas. even after tasting it a 20 tyms may be i m not sure what are the ingredients

I am a regular customer of this hotel since last year.i have tasted almost everything from rice thalis to chilli chicken,kosha,kabab and all.fried rice,biriyani and all those that the hotel has to offer....everything is good and what is the greatest positive point is that you wont fall ill(a common phenomenon associated with the hotels).overall good food and reasonable price.but the ambience is chaotic.

Probably the best takeaway restaurant in Garia...Chicken Chaap is their speciality...North Indian Cuisine is served....some varieties of Noodles and it's accompaniments are also served...Dining area is not that good.....but it can be a good option for takeaway
