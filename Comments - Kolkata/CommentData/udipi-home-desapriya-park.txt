Located at southern avenue, a difficult to find, but its beside the landmarks- kamala girls high school and oudh 1590, thank god for the GPS. I dont know why is the place is under-rated. I loved the south indian delicacies, uthappam and dosa, both were yummy. I loved the chutneys served along with it. My overall experince in terms of taste is my rating points. Nevertheless, the decor and ambience isn't much pleasing though. But if you only want to gorge on food, then you must try.

Udipi was one of my favourite south indian joint.. But my recent visit changed my view as the price has increased a lot..
1. Cheese rava dosa (3/5): Quantity of cheese was almost negigible inside it... Dosa costing 100 each..
2. Masala Dosa
3. Chaas (4/5): Refreshing..
But there is a detoriation in over all taste.

This is located near Deshapriya Park. The food was good but not as expected from a Udipi restaurant & the service was decent enough. Well the Interiors are not upto the mark which is the major drawback of this place. The filter coffee was tasty & the Dosa too is good but they should improve the taste of sambhar & chutney.

One of the most amazing South Indian Food serving restaurant in Kolkata. Like every other legendary outlet, they don't have air condition, and waiting time on weekends is long but the food makes it all worth. 
Perfect location of for a weekend breakfast.

One of my worst experiences so far. Tucked in Jatin Das Road near Desapriya Park, this is supposed to be a place for enjoying udipi style food.. however that is far from the truth. We ordered sada dosa and thali meal. Apart from the dosa (only the dosa, not the chutneys) rest of the offerings are just awful and disgusting. The ambience of the place ...less said the better...This place might be frequented by people but this has no connection with udipi cuisine whatever...Sambhar is laden with chilli powder...rasam tasteless, butter milk toxic and stale...chapathi is more like the sole of your shoe and rice is cold...the veggies are just unappetizing...papad is the only saving grace. Chutneys served with the dosa has the same stale taste but different color..I rue my decision to visit this place... completely stumped!!

Was craving for South Indian food again so decided to drop in into this joint. The interior looked like it is from the british era. Old walls , big doors which greatly complimented the ambience. We ordered masala dosa and cold coffee. The dosa was served within 10mins but the coffee was served after almost half an hour, which was a bit too much time  for making a glass 9d cold coffee. The dosa was nicely stuffed and really tasty. There were 3 kinds of chutney - white, orange and green. The orange one dod not taste great. The others were good enough including the sambar. 
There are no waiters when you need extra servings. I literally had to wait a good 5 mins to get extra sambar and chutney served. Overall a satisfying experience but they really need to work on their service a lot.

I visit Udipi when my parents have a sudden craving for south Indian food after completing their bazaar at Lake Market .

This place is famous for the different chatnis they serve with all their south Indian dishes. Apart from the usual sambar and coconut chutney they also serve a green and a red chatni.

The place doesn't have an ambiance but it's a clean place to dine in. The waiters are prompt when it comes to service and the food is piping hot .

I am biased to their sada vadas. You must try it if you're here. The others items I feel taste the same as those served by various South Indian restaurants scattered throughout the city . The chatnis are equally good . Make sure you give this place a shot next time you're in the area .

Udipi was our go to place for south indian food... Usually after catching a movie at Priya! I have always loved their crispy dosa and rava idlies... And the array of chutney and condiments ... And as students on a tight budget udipi was the choice to hang out while savouring lovely "south indian tiffin" and enjoying the DPP view!

It is so close to my office, but never went there until yesterday when one of my friend took me there. Had heard about it before so was wanting to taste the food. The ambience was very homely and the food lived up to my expectation. I personally like my dosas a bit thicker; not a fan of paper dosas and it was just about perfect for me. Price is really reasonable and the best part no tax added to the bills. I am surely returning to this place time and again.

I had this fascinating fried idly in town for the first time! It was nicely prepared and tasted like home made delicacy. The charm of this culinary destination lies in its ' recluse ambience'. You spend hours together, pampered with the prompt service of the staff. 
Every time my friend visits Kolkata, we treat ourselves with the most delicious uthappam and onion masala dosa. 
The seating arrangement takes you back to a by gone era.

Well, I found Udupi Home to be a good experience. It's not a posh place. The ground floor is the restaurant in an old house in Deshapriya Park. Not air conditioned so you'll feel the heat. Food is great. Bang for the buck. Since people regularly visit this place, food is fresh and that too for this price. I have a deep love for South Indian Thaali since I stayed in Chennai for around two years. Thaali here reminded me of my days in South India. Felt good.

Complete Value for money. Halthy Food. Though I wish the Thali would really be "Thali" but for that price i guess it's okay ! The Rasam is amazing. The Chaas when taken in the afternoon is just originally great ! But avoid Chaas here in the night since the taste differs. They probably make it like we do at home out of curd.  I normally go to have a lot of Rasam and Chaas !! Rest, the food speaks for itself ! Wish you Happy Serving !

I think they use coconut oil but being a bengali I don't like the smell of coconut oil in food so I didn't like the dosa. Lassi was quite good nothing special . I won't visit this place ever.

So, one of my friends took me to this joint a couple of days back for lunch. Nice soothing ambient, with a duplex for the eating area. We placed our orders, which was delivered pretty promptly (as we were the only other pair of guests there). But the waiter, who served us, had an air of arrogance with him. On inquiring about if all the "chunteys" were served with the dish, he counted them out with a weird sense of contempt, as if almost we had asked him to serve out his kidneys for us.

Overall, it was a really tragic experience for me there, was in no mood to click any photos of the food we were served, which was good though. A definitely "never return to" eatery for me.

I lived in bangalore for a while and if it's that variety I'm in the mood for I'll just convince the others with me to head to Udipi home

Udipi Home is an old eatery around Deshapriya Park crossing which proudly served the erstwhile President His Excellency Dr A P J Abdul Kalam. It is run by a Malayali family for several decades now. The house serves as a guest house with a restaurant in the verandah which serves hot and fresh meals. Udipi home is typically for those days when you want veg lunch in particular. Udipi home may lack the appearance but it does not lack in quality. That's Tomato Rice for you !!

A proper South Kolkata "Bonidi Baari" with huge varandas turned into an antique South Indian joint serving delicious South Indian food. This place is very spacious with a seating arrangement for about more than 30 people. Decor and ambiance is pleasing. Service is a bit on the slower side.
Ordered Dosas - Plain and Masala, Sambhar Idli, Sambhar Vada and Watermelon juice.
Dosas were good. I loved the Sambhar Vada. Watermelon juice failed to impress me.
Recommended for a taste of South India in the heart of Calcutta!

Udipi is one of the oldest food joint mainly known for serving south indian dishes.It is a perfect place for having some healthy and light breakfast.The ambiance and service at this place is also extremely good.Coming to the food we had-

1:Idly
2:Sambhar Vada
3:Masala Dosa
4:Sada Dosa
5:Watermelon juice

Among them their "Sambhar Vada" is a must try and their chutneys are by far the best chutneys we ever had in a south indian restaurant.

Food-4/5
Service-4.5/5

Been here with some of my foodie friends for breakfast. Udipi was one of the oldest south indian cuisine serving restaurant of kolkata and the one which serves the most delicious south indian dishes. Restaurant was beautifully designed and decorated. Retro looks was given. Bricks walls, classic lighting, classy tables and south india atmosphere. Ambience was really cool and hospitality was very impressive. Friendly and helpful staff. Service in reasonable time and presentation was superb. Price was bit high but their taste, quality and quantity deserve what they charging. We started with the fresh watermelon juice which was fully refreshing and tastes heavenly. We ordered sambhar idli, vendu bada, butter masala dosa and paper dosa. All were made Traditionally and tastes true south indian. Very tasty dosa's, idli and vendu bada served with sambhar cooked in desi ghee and tri colored coconut chatni. Orange made with tomato, coconut and garlic, green made with coriander leaves, coconut and green chillies and which was simply coconut chatni. Best place to have south indian dishes. Personal favorite. Must try place highly recommended to all.

Ambience is nice with sitting arrangenents.

Staffs are cordial and service is quick.

Tried sada onion cheese dosa , fried idli and filter coffee. All were simply delectable and well cooked. 

A must visit place for South Indian food lovers.

Udipi Cafeteria one of the oldest is the best for South Indian food. The ambience and decor of the restaurant is too good. They have lots of varieties in south indian, and amazing food they prepare like dosas, idly, vada, uttapam, sambhar , chutney of various types etc etc.
I love the dosas they prepare esp the coconut chutney is fab. The presentation is too good. They cleanliness they maintain, very hygienic which was quite impressive.The customer service they provide is too good, fast and on time. And the dishes are at  reasonable rates. The food is outstanding. Go for it.

Udipi's place is seriously one of the best places you can grab a South Indian meal for really affordable prices. It is ideal for college students. The service is fast and really Co operative. (They exchanged my 2k note when no was ).
Me and my friend had cheese dosa,uttapam,fried idli and coffee. The coffee here is to die for. They serve it in a steel cup and bowl and it's piping hot. You then have to cool the beverage by pouring it too and fro from the cup to the bowl. A real South Indian experience.
The dosa was crisp with a lot of cheese stuffed in the middle. The uttapam was a little burnt and I was under the impression that it won't be that good. However, the burnt part gave it a crispy top and it was a complete delight to eat.
Save the best for the last cause the fried idli was to die for. It was fried to the very core and went perfectly with the chutney that they had provided.My friend was even of the opinion that restaurants should be serving fried idli instead of French fries.
It is seriously one of the best places where you get a complete value for money.If your craving South Indian food you guys should definitely give this place a try.

Having lived in Karnataka for 12 years and having recently shifted here I was craving for good Dosa. I'd searched my locality but finally seniors from my college, all from Karnataka took me along to this place. The Butter Plain Dosa made me happy and reminded me of home. The chutneys were also delicious. The Sambhar was unfortunately not up to the mark, it being my favourite accessory really took away from the experience. However, if you are a South Indian food lover this is one of the best places in Kolkata to satisfy your hunger, do give it a visit!

Udipi home is the new branch of raos udipi home 

Masala dosa is good served with sambar and three types of chutney as it opens in the morning one of the good place to have South Indian.

Sambhar idly was also good.
Fresh lime soda was not good at all.

A nice, quiet place to enjoy authentic, tasty udipi food. The plus points are the availability of a variety of fresh juices(a south Indian cafe trend) and hot filter coffee. The chutneys and condiments served with the food are really spicy and yum. A neat, contained atmosphere.

The ambience is nice of Udipi Home, they make very basic South Indian food but don't expect for extraordinary taste. But yes, try their coffee, it's a must. They make South Indian sweets too. And they have a very clean n hygienic kitchen. And also they don't make a hole in your pocket at the end of the month. 
Quite nice for light South Indian dinner n evening snacks.

One may find it odd for a restaurant setting, as it's the ground floor of a house! It's okayish for South Indian food. Do not expect cleanliness or charming auras. Can try if you get hungry on the road.

Day before yesterday ,when the entire city was getting wet, my Aunt and I took shelter in Udipi Home.First I was amazed to see the place done up.Where we sitting water was coming from the windows and it couldnt be locked.So we shifted to another corner.Well this time the roof was leaking.After requesting they made us sit in a little dry place,where water was following under our feet.By that time our oder came - idly with cold sambar.Even after requesting a number of times the wet table was not wiped as the staff was busy gossiping.Oh what an experience!!! Is this the same place I loved going since childhood? Yes ,but not anymore.

The butter milk was horrible n I think they made it with a few days old curd.. U cannot take pple for granted... I know u pple have a good name n have been for a long time but y do u want to ruin it by compromising on the quality..

I am aquainted with the food of this place because i order south indian meals from here often through swiggy. I have never visited the place physically so i have absolutely no idea regarding the ambience or location of the place. But i actually enjoy the south indian food i have from here. It is comfort food and also pocket friendly. The dosas are good..the masala dosas have quite a substantial amount of veggies, the plain dosa are also tasty( but i have had better). I always enjoy their sambar as it is very very tasty. The chutneys( the white and orange) are tasty, specially the orange one. I also like their idlis but somehow the vadas are a tad bit soggy. Overall, the food served is of good quality and since i am a big fan of south indian cuisine, i love ordering for lunch from this place now and then.

Ok food with the pathetic customer service. Chutneys no@t available in a south indian restaurant. Had to eat Uttapam with only sambar. Contruction work going on next door due to which continuous hammering and drilling going on which was making irritatting noise. Honestly this is the first time and is my last visit to this place. Never would recommend to my friends and family members. Also to say if this kind of customer service continues then its bad for the original Udipi which is located near lake market.

It was yesterday afternoon when I was looking for a decent place to order some good south Indian stuff, bored with the same Oriental and Mughlai, I came across this particular restaurant in swiggy. Since I noticed a good rating, without thinking much, I decided to order from here. Keeping things simple, I ordered for a cheese masala dosa. The dosa came within 20 minutes of my order. It was packed well. The major reason behind my disappointment was that they had delivered me a normal masala dosa instead of a cheese one. The pricing of the normal masala dosa is just 80 bucks but for the cheese one they charged 110 bucks which was rounded off to 150 bucks including service and delivery charges. This is something unexpected from a good restaurant. Whatever, delivering something and charging for something else is the worst that can be expected from a so called restaurant. Also, I had placed the order at 11:55am which wasn't the actual lunch time and the restaurant isn't supposed to remain crowded at that time. So, what I guess is that they have knowingly placed a normal masala dosa in place of the cheese one, thinking that the customer will be fool to have it without complaining. Well, having said much, I just don't want to spoil my mood anymore. My recommendation, to all my followers and the ones reading this, is to strictly avoid this place.

This place just a few steps away from my house, i have been here so many times, though i don't like south indian much still like this place. Even it is very easy to locate just nearby to deshapriya park crossing. Its not a fancy restaurant with quirky decor and air conditioner. Its very simple with plastic chairs, hut like roof with mud tiles, and tasty food. So all the ratings and everything just for their food.
Amazing, authentic, fresh n superb food. Dosas, vadas, butter idli, variety of chutney, fresh juices, their lemon rice one of the best, one can get mesmerized with the filter coffee.

So when it comes to south indian and you are in Kolkata must visit this restaurant. Just go for it without thinking twice.

This love affair started from last half decade. Tucked in the narrow lane in south kolkata, lies this breakfast haven. Please enjoy…

Direction and Timing

From the Sharat Bose road and desapriya park crossing, if you go towards the southern avenue- the first right lane is Jatin Das Road. This lane lies just opposite to the first petrol pump on your left hand side. Get in the lane and just after 4-5 buildings, you’ll find one building with the ground floor painted as the red-brick-colored layout. There is a menu written outside for the specialities of the day and few of their credentials. Congratulations, you’ve reached Udipi Home.

Timing is 7 AM- 9 PM (all days)

Food:-

Once you get in, you get the feel of entering an old residential house with tables and chairs arranged inside. There are 2 sittings areas- one outside and once it gets filled, the one room inside. We, however, sat on the outer area only. AS soon as you sit dow, the menu is given to you and chilled water in steel glass- from the nearby visible water purifier and chiller. Go through the menu and most of the items are within the price range of 30/- to 60/-…. Hence chill and relax.

As we went in the breakfast time, we ordered pongal and idli. As soon as the food is served, they put 3 types of chutneys (plain coconut, coconut with coriander leaves and spicy coconut-tomato-garlic) bowl full at the table which, they assured, can be refilled if empty…

Well, for the unknown-to-the-southie-food, pongal is a south-indian version of khichdi which is hugely popular in the whole of south india- especially tamilnadu and karnataka. Made with rice and lentil and flavored with crushed black-pepper and masalas, its a treat at the breakfast. Mostly taken with coconut chutney and sambhar. 

Then came the idli…. Well, literally they just melted in the mouth. One of the most fluffiest and softest idlies in town. 2 in a plate with chutneys and sambhar 

Encouraged by the above, our next order was rava (suji) sada dosa and sada vada. Rava dosa was ordinary (not bad though). But the sada vada made for it. It was pure bliss with just the right amount of crispiness outside and soft inside. perfectly spiced, it was too good.

Well, we are almost full and longing for a buttermilk, while my friend asked for a filter coffee. Coffee here is served in the traditional steel glass-bowl-style and for the buttermilk, its a spice-bomb. Buttermilk is a light, thin salted lassi spiced with ginger, lemon chunk, green chilly, coriander leaves and tampered in standard southie style. Too good and taste-clearer.
 
Full and happy, we came out with just a  pocket pinch of around 120/- per head. Awesome !!! Please enjoy….

This is like Kolkata's own version of MTR.Serving selected items, but at low prices and great quality. In this hole in the wall, order anything they dont get it wrong. Starting frm Aloo bondas to pipping hot light idlis, dosas made just right and that steam hot cup of coffee is what will draw you to this place again and again. No jazz no fanfare just plain, simple , honest food!
If pasaing by just drop in for the filter coffee !It will set everything right!

Favourite place for having South Indian Food. I am in love with this place. It is inside an old house, looks like a Bonedi Bari. Not in the best of conditions. Renovation was going on the last time i had visited. I have been to this place many times and always for breakfast. Their Dosa is the best. Its really tasty and the best thing is that they serve the dosa not just with sambar and the white chutney but with many more flavourful chutneys. I loved their Uttapam too. Staff is very good. Service is great. Food is awesome. Cost is worth it. This place is a must try for South Indian Food.

If you want close to ethnic, no frills south India food, you should visit this place. Located in one of the bye lanes connecting Lake Market and Deshapriya Park, this restaurant is probably not as visible as the other Deshapriya Park restaurants, but is quite well known locally and has great footfall. Place is quite reasonable and service is quite prompt and courteous.

**Location**
Very near to the Dhakuria lake

I had visited this place very often in past and I like their place for my affection towards South Indian food. They make some good dosas which are very close to the authentic ones. Reasonably priced and good service makes it a decent place for visit.

Stopping by this place, pulling up a chair outside the restaurant sitting under the tree shade and sipping on a cup of coffee is what ypu would love to do while seeing the cars pass by. A lovely place to sit and chill. 
The cold coffee is nice and has that homely touch to it with the taste of filter coffee. 
The saturday and sunday special masala vada is a good try. Having a good crunchy layer with a soft spongy texture inside. Served with some old chutni and sambar and some nice tangy garlic chutni.

I love the Onion cheese masala Dosa here and it might be full of calories but I think its one of the tastiest dosas in town. The Idly they make is quite big in size and one plate idly is good enough to satisfy moderate hunger.  We bring home Idly, Sambhar vada and dosas from  Udipi quite often for dinner, and the pricing is a tad bit high but the amount of chutney and sambhar they always pack makes up for everything. try the watermelon juice here. its really good!

I am not a south indian food lover so I always avoid south indian restaurant in town. But sometimes due yo unavoidable circumstances I ended up in south indian cuisines.

Udipi is one of the oldest south indian food joint in South Kolkata. Established at 1969.

Located beside Priya cinema hall so it was easy to locate this.

Went there nearly 4-5 times. Never had a bad experience. 

I always ate Plain Dosa and Dahi Vada from the entire menu.. 

I liked there food, can't comment on quality and all because I said am not a south indian lover.

I was invited to this place by a rowing fellow. Since very close to the Dhakuria Lake, we often go to this place for some really amazing dosas. They make some authentic South Indian food and a good really fast service.
If you like South Indian food, this is surely your destination.

Good idlis, better vadas and the best dosas! That sums it up I guess. The sambar was tad bit watery, but the mint chutney, the tomato chutney and the coconut chutney were all thick and tasted great. The filter coffee was strong and good too. Prices are pretty cheap and service is fast. Good place for breakfast.

I am not a south indian food lover so I always avoid south indian restaurant in town. But sometimes due yo unavoidable circumstances I ended up in south indian cuisines.

Udipi is one of the oldest south indian food joint in South Kolkata. Established at 1969.

Located beside Priya cinema hall so it was easy to locate this.

Went there nearly 4-5 times. Never had a bad experience. 

I always ate Plain Dosa and Dahi Vada from the entire menu.. 

I liked there food, can't comment on quality and all because I said am not a south indian lover.

Well, I have been a visitor of this place since long for their tasty and pocket friendly South Indian foods. Though sitting arrangements are not that fancy, but the food is very nice and fresh. Try out their juices too. Very fresh.

If you love south Indian cuisine, especially onion rava dosa, your wait is over. Udipi home is the right place to serve you the best of south Indian dishes. Place is not all that spic and span.. but u won't mind being there as food is too good.

As my dad descends from the other side of Bengal, my second half from my mom's side has its origin in the southern part of India, that is Andhra Pradesh. Taking this link into account, my family is very regular over here at Udipi. Didn't get a chance to review this place earlier because since the time I am regular in Zomato, I haven't come here. 
Yesterday, I had been to Tiretti Bazar for the early morning Chinese breakfast. On my way back home, my uncle expressed her cravings for home food. So we landed upon here. Aged couples, South Indian families residing in Kolkata are the regulars over here.
We had ordered a Rava Dosa and watermelon juices to have over there and packed Idlis. and Upma for home. The dosa was okay, grains were not grinded smoothly and the sambar and coconut chutney served with was also average. Watermelon juice was also okay. The watermelons used were sweet but I think that they could have added a pinch of rock salt to bring in that magic of fruit juice at a restaurant. At home, the upma and idlis were okay. It is not the very good quality of food that keeps us bringing here again and again but the sheer nostalgia of my Mamabari. So, I am keep coming here again and again. Happy Dining! :)

Born and brought up near Deshapriya Park makes me an Udipi regular. It's nor exactly spic 'n' span but the unkempt, old-world charm of this place works for me. I tried their fried idli for the first time today and was BLOWN AWAY by it.
Ordered two plates to be shared by 3 people. Was a little sceptical about the quantity ordered but it's been 2 hours since I ate it and am still quite full.
The idlis are cut into thick wedges and fried till golden and crispy. The sambhar(a little watery and bland) and the three types of chutneys(white coconut, green coriander, red tomato with onion garlic) serves as a great dip to this sumptuous snack. If you come here, DO order these with steaming glasses of filter coffee and enjoy a good old laid-back adda.

My favorite South Indian place in Kolkata. My go to order is always Onion Rava Dosa and Filter Coffee. Coconut Chutney is really good and I always ask for a second's. Their weekend specials like Upma, different types of Vada are also quite tasty. The place is a little run down and you might have to share tables with others but it is under going renovation right now. Service is good but waiters tend to be a wee bit unprofessional at times; being a regular customer, though, I've always been treated well.

It's a pocket friendly outlet serving very good quality vegetarian South Indian food.Its popular among the students for its cheap rate.I used to go to this place during my school days a lot for tiffin after exams at Aakash institute. It's situated just opposite to Priya cinema hall.
I love the dosas served here.They r crisp with good filling of potato and other veggies in it. They are of big size..can easily fulfill hunger pangs of a single person completely.It's served with sambhar and 3 types of chutney on side. The coconut based ones(white and green) are my favourite. .love the subtle fresh creamy taste of it.The other one is a tamarind chutney.
I still order dosas from Udipi home through at times when I crave for South Indian delicacy for evening snack. Though masala dosas are good here. .I always prefer to have plain ones mostly(applicable for other restaurants serving South Indian cuisine too).

Udupi home serves the best south indian food that I've had in my city. The chutney's can be eaten with a spoon by themselves. The dosa, idli and vada are all star's here. Everything on the focused menu is fantastic. Unbelievable value for money and truly deep flavors make Udipi home a must visit. This place probably deserves one michelin star at the very least.

Visited Udipi Home yesterday for lunch with my family. The restaurant has two levels with kitchen and seating below and seating on the mezzanine level. The staircase to the mezzanine level is quite a challenge. Its steep and narrow and I think old people or healthy people would have a problem with it.

The idli and the vada were fine. Service was FAST and the sambar was really nice. The chutneys were average. Service was also average as I could hardly find stewards around me when I needed them and had to wait for sometime for them to show up so that I could ask for things although the restaurant hardly had tables.

The disappointing part about the food were the dosas. They were thick especially the dhania dosa I ordered almost like a roti. The dosa lacked crispness and flavor. The cold coffee and vanilla milkshake we ordered were good but thats not what you go to a south indian restaurant to eat.

All in all an average experience. The 3.5 rating is due to the sambar and quick service of our first course. But all in all the place lacks repeat value especially when you compare it to Ramkrishna Mission close by.

Quite frequently I visit this place to have onion Utthapam & Filter Coffee.

At times when I miss my Kerala & Hyderabad days - I get packed 'Sambar' from here along with their special 'Potato Chips'. 
At dinner - Sambar-Rice with Potato Chips & little amount of 'Ghee' sprinkled on it lead me to a rencontre with the memories of my South India days !!!

(irrespective of the fact that 'Udipi' is a place in Karnataka & cuisine originated from there, however to us everything is considered as "South Indian" be it Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam or Kannad 🤓 !!!)

Stewards here are courteous, super speedy in service, maintain hygienic cooking condition (master kitchen is visible from the ordering counter); place is price point-wise moderate.

I haven't tried their newly opened branch at Lake Road...would look forward to step in there soon.

This is an amazing place for South Indian food lovers. Right from vadas to idlis to dosas and uttapam all are simply fantastic. Tea and filter coffee is also quite good along with the food.

Rating of 4.5 only for the quality of food and the traditional South Indian ambience. Personally would prefer sitting inside during winters only. It's 100% advisable to sit in the car and get prompt service. #SouthIndian food. Be it breakfast, lunch or dinner or anytime during the day. From what I have heard front their own staff, they are open 364 days in a year. 

Would recommend Idlis, Onion Uttapam, garma garam chai and lime juice, tastes that are not even 1% different from what is served in Udipi(town in Karnataka where it all took birth). Since I have stayed there, I can relate to the taste even more. Just too good and authentic.

I visited this place to check it out without any pre-plans and ordered a glass of rasam and a Masala Dosa. The service is good, taste is also good but the ambience is not at all worth it. Many people were having but either were sitting outsite in open or in their cars. Not a place to visit with family. For those who are ready to shell out some extra bucks for a good experience, there are much better pure south Indian restaurants nearby including prema vilas, banana leaf and Ramakrishna Ashram lunch home.

This has to be one of my favourite restaurant,As I have eaten here minimum thousand times. This restaurant serves authentic n very tasty south indian dishes with very reasonable pricing.
Their all foods are extremely good,specially their Rava dosa,upma (breakfast) and filter coffee is a must try. And the best part is they serve their food with three types of yummy chutneys.
Dr. A.P.J. Abdul kalam also had food from this restaurant in 2003 at Raj Bhavan. And all our tollywood stars also often come in this restaurant to have south indian foods.

They have some sitting arrangements outside their restaurant also where you can sit n relax n have your food.
The owners and the staffs are very friendly.
Who are always ready to serve you better.

Another thing which I want clear to all of you reading this is that ,they have a staff whom people think is as a little boy n people often blame the owners to have kept that little boy and practicing child labour , I want to clear that he is not a little boy,he is a dwarf n his age is 30.

All in all a good south indian restaurant for foodies.

Intro : This restaurant is actually the entrance and balcony of a typical old  residential building. No ambience ,but food speaks !

Food : Went for lunch , ordered tomato rice and idli.
Tomato Rice is served with sambar and two varieties of chutney and papad.
The rice was very tasty, the flavour of tomato all over, just a bit of excess oil, else super.
The chutney s were amazing and so was the Sambar. 4/5

Idli- Super soft , just melted in the mouth, Sambar was also very nice . 4/5
Service: Friendly staff, very quick service 4/5
Overall - Authentic South Indian Joint serving very good food 4/5

Been to Udipi Home many times. A good breakfast and evening snack joint (in my opinion). I just love their sada dosa,their fluffy idlis and onion uttapam. They serve 3 types of chutneys which is great. Their sambar is also very good unlike other south indian places where sambar is awful. They also have an option of Jain sambar. Sunday mornings their upma is excellent. The service is very friendly. The only drawback is the decor. I wish they pay a little attention to the decor and ambience of the place.

Statutory declaration : The owner is a friend
Statutory confession : Even that fact does not make it better than Ramkrishna Lunch Home nearby.

The three points of an equilateral triangle in the lake market,deshapriya park,lake market area will be Ramkrishna Lunch Home,Udipi Home and Prema Vilas.All of them are more or less 50 years old and carry the old world charm of an era gone by.

Very few people understand and appreciate the fact that even in the simple idli or a masala dosa,the connoisseur will make out its origin in Andhra,Tamil Nadu,Karnataka.....and that they do from the sambar and the chutney.The Udipi home serves three kinds of chutneys which purists might scorn at but adds to popular appeal.

I asked for masala dosa,idli and coffee.They were good but not as good as my Gold standard of Prema Vilas.But these were cheaper,the portions were bigger and the service was friendlier.And the coffee was definitely the best filter coffee I have had this year.Burppppppp....

Been twice here. 
Dosas are good and sambhar are little bit of sweet.
Get 3 kind of chutney's, classic coconut, green coriander and red onion chutney.
Had filter coffee which was something which reminded me of my kerela trip. They taste quite different.
All and all an good joint.

The quintessential South Indian eatery. Walk up any fresh Sunday morning to have tamarind delights with filter coffee and you shall not be disappointed. The early 90s feel of a typical Calcutta home with food from the southern lands- that's what you can look out for here. Other than the cleanliness concern, it is a place worthy enough to spend a good time with real delicious smack up!

Udupi home is located just beside Desapriya park premises opp to Priya cinemas. They serve very good South indian dishes spclly their dosas are mouth watering. I spclly like the sambar they serve with the dosas.Pricing is good too for the quality served. Service is quick. A good place for a quick meal.

This Udupi home is located on the road which goes opposite to the Bharat petroleum Petrol Pump at Deshpriya park. Its an old place and anyone can lead you to the place. The restaurant is located in a traditional home which is modified to fit in some tables. Dont go here looking for anything other than good and cheap food. 
Pros:
1. Good tasty south indian food
2. Pretty damn cheap
3. Parking ain't much of a problem
4. Staff n the manager are courteous
Cons:
1. Ambience -no
2. Hygienic - not really. 
Must try items :
Rava dosa served with all those chutneys, poori masala, sada vada, filter coffee

Homely atmosphere with authentic South Indian food, Udipi has been by far my mosttt favourite place. Whenever I feel like having South Indian..its my first choice. Rava Dosas are a mustt try..whch are cooked to perfection, crispy n with the right amount of filling.. the 3 chutneys they serve ( red, green n coconut white) are all equally delicious. Idlis and Uttapams are my next orders if m in a mood to gorge more. Try their mixed Uttapam n Masala Vadas(served only on.Saturdays and Sundays). They also make a South Indian special halwa.. again made during weekends and on special occasions. Try their Tea served in a steel glass n a plate underneath, south Indian ishhtyle. Pricing is done very reasonably as all.the items are priced inclusive of VAT. Staff is extremely cordial and friendly. The food deserves a 5, giving a 4 only because its not that well-kept as it should be and the place isn't air conditioned.

Went for breakfast and ordered Upma, Pongal, Idly, Vada. Food was just amazing. Each item comes with 3 types of chutneys -  white, red and green - and delicious sambhar which is full of vegetables. Each accompaniment is freshly prepared and as much as you want. On the whole quality of food is top class.

Situated in Deshapriya Park this south indian eatery serves up good south indian dishes. I have tried their onion masala dosa and rava cheese dosa. Both were equally  tasty. What I love is their sambhar and chutneys. The sambhar has the perfect tang and the coconut chutney is divine. The green chutney is good too.
Prices are very reasonable.
My friends have also tasted the chaas and other variety of dosas like the mysore masala and have loved it. 
We usually order food from here during office hours so we have not visited the place, but I plan too soon! 

Overall: 3.5/5

Undoubtedly this place serves the best dosa with a  really low price chart. I have been having their dosas since childhood. They make fantastic dosas with just the right amount of oil. The uttapams are pure bliss. The vadas are crunchy and tasty just the way you will like. The white coconut chutney is among the best I ever had. The sambhar tastes really good. And the lemon juice they serve is just fantastic. They serve good coffee too.
The staff here is polite and friendly.

A standard restaurant serving exclusively south Indian dishes. Quite known in south Kolkata. The ambiance is a bit disturbing - lots of noise, not very clean and no visually pleasant decoration as such. Service is swift. Food is quite tasty. Quality and quantity are also as per standard. Price is pocket-friendly. Nice place to try if you are looking for something very light and quick to fill your stomach.

Undoubtedly one of the best south Indian places in Kolkata. Actually my favourite one.
Have been here a million times. Opposite the Sai Mandir's Lane in Deshapriya park, this is one of those cozy places where you can adda marofy outside sitting with your gang on chairs or stools till the last minute!
Recommended: all sorts of dosas even the plain one, uttapam, sambar vada.
Must try: the Filter coffee!!
If you want the real essence of the eatery, sit outside!
P.S go a tad early. Things get over fast. Super fast on Thursdays and weekends. (specially the chutneys and sambar)
Closes at 9:30. Go at 9:15 even on the above mentioned days and you're the loser coz I believe an early dinner is better than a half Hearted order!
Enjoy!

I have been to this place a zillion time when I use to reside out there in Kolkata. On the context to food nothing to complain about except non availability of it in a large quantities during the rush hours of weekend. My personal favourites from here are Mysore masala dosa, meals , rava kesari , onion vada , soft and warm idlies , filter coffee and Mysore pak. I have been there throughout south India for the last one and half years but I didn't get rasam and Mysore pak as awesome as it is served here.

I entered here just casually to eyeball what is there in the menu. Thought to have filter coffee accompanied by onion vada. Taste of filter coffee is not that great and vada was like any other South Indian street side counter. 
There is nothing called ambiance here, it's a make-shift shelter in front of an old house. Staffs are the rudest one I ever met. Simply throws plates on table as if they are doing us a great favour by serving. You cant dare to ask for extra chutney. Majority of the people stand outside and eat because of such behaviour of staff.
If you think its cheap then rethink. 2 plates vada and 3 coffee was INR 150 for a mediocre tiffin house.

The fact that the restaurant isn't air conditioned and you might have to share your table with other customers does make you think twice before you visit Udipi. The food, however, is tasty. They serve three chutneys with anything that you order for. More than the dosas and uttapams I like their lemon and tomato rice.
Anybody visiting should definitely try out their Fried Idly... It does redefine the concept of finger chips!!!

Hiding away from the decors of the main street, the lavish new restaurants, cafe opening up nearby, this outlet sits quietly near Deshapriya park serving south Indian dishes. One will not find great ambience over here but more of a homely feel with tables and chair put up in rooms. Food and water are served in steel glass and plates, this gives you a kind of retro feel, a nostalgia which will bring you back over here. Food tasted okay, nothing exceptional though. Cleanliness might be an issue, but for us the glasses and plates were clean. 

It is a perfect spot for hanging out with friends compared to the cafes nearby mainly because of two reasons :
1. Healthy food
2. Not at all heavy to your pocket

Might return whenever old friends want to catch up.

This is a place where u cannot expect a lavish decor or a very spacious sitting. Udipi home gives u a homely feeling. The sitting arrangements are quiet nice n comfortable. 

The South Indian food is very tasty n quiet fresh. They serve special udipi dishes only on Weekends. I had tried the butter masala dosa, plain idli, sada vada, masala uthappam (South Indian pizza). It was excellent , very tasty and at a very cheap price. It does not even pinch your pocket. And that's the best part of it. For me a cup of filter coffee at udipi home every time I visit is a must. 

The waiters are very friendly n well mannered.

Bon Appétit

Every time I have visited,this place has not let me down.This doesn't look like a regular eatery and don't expect awesome decor.They have revised the prices recently,but earlier it was really very cheap compared to other South Indian eateries. Still this is a good place for south indian food lovers. The idlis and dosa tastes good.Specially the dosa is very good to taste.They serve dosa with three types of chutneys and yes they serve it more than once and it tastes really great. The chutney itself alone is a good draw!!!! If you visit this place once you will surely not mind going back again.

Location: Deshapriya Park. 

This place is a small eatery which I found out during my usual evening walks. 
Not great on the ambiance meter, but definitely good in the food they serve. 
The ambiance is nothing but an old house turned into a restaurant with decent seating arrangement.

This place caters to South Indian Cuisine. Being near to my residence, have majorly opted for takeaways, but, have dined-in once.

- Fresh Lime Soda
Perfect balance of lime and sweet/sour. Good to taste.

- Filter Coffee
Wasn't as strong as expected. Towards the mild end, could be improved.

- Plain dosa 
Soft and tasty. 

- Masala Dosa 
The potato filling is good to taste. Flavorful yet, has scope of improvement.

- Cheese Onion Plain Dosa
Had a filling of onions and grated cheese. But, the cheese was scarcely found. Generous amount of cheese would be much appreciated.

- Cheese Masala Dosa
Due to the scarcity of cheese in the filling, tasted very similar to the Masala Dosa. Could have higher cheese levels.

- Onion Rawa Dosa
Was good to taste and was nicely prepared.

- Masala Vada 
A variation of the plain vada, slightly flatter in looks, great in taste and definitely not greasy.
Personal favorite. 

- Plain Vada 
Crisp but, oily. 

- Idlis 
Soft and always served hot. 

• Sambhar is decent and inclined towards a sweet nature, have had better.
• Chutneys (Has three different chutneys):
- The red chilli-garlic onion chutney used to taste great, but now the quality has deteriorated and tastes just about average.
- The Coriander chutney is good to taste, but isn't always available.
- The traditional coconut chutney tastes good.

The takeaway as well as dine-in service is quick! 
Staff is courteous and efficient.
Prices are slightly inclined towards the moderate end.

Overall always a decent experience.

Not up to our expectations.My partner and i had expected a typical south Indian authenticity, but nothing like that. The waiter forgot our order, served dosa without the masala and on pointing, brought a bowl of masala. Taste was just below average. Nothing actually impressed me there and my partner actually said this to be our worst dosa experience and it is so sad as we never felt like this after having dosas  :(

• Sambhar is decent and inclined towards a sweet nature, have had better.
• Chutneys (Has three different chutneys):
- The red chilli-garlic onion chutney used to taste great, but now the quality has deteriorated and tastes just about average.
- The Coriander chutney is good to taste, but isn't always available.
- The traditional coconut chutney tastes good.

The takeaway as well as dine-in service is quick! 
Staff is courteous and efficient.
Prices are slightly inclined towards the moderate end.

Overall always a decent experience.

Not up to our expectations.My partner and i had expected a typical south Indian authenticity, but nothing like that. The waiter forgot our order, served dosa without the masala and on pointing, brought a bowl of masala. Taste was just below average. Nothing actually impressed me there and my partner actually said this to be our worst dosa experience and it is so sad as we never felt like this after having dosas  :(

The thing with this joint is that it appears like a small dark cabin from outside and not particularly very hygienic.  But to be fair if hygiene was in the question then we would have given up puchka for long ! Nonetheless once you enter Udipi and eat the food its well worth it. :)
1. Dosas- I find the Dosas the best thing here, they are not as huge as Bana leaf's so that one person cannot finish them and they certainly taste better ! Try the Cheese Masala dosa, they do not skimp on the cheese I'l tell you.
2. Idli- Okay now the idli is very moody here, I come here often as it is near my best friend's house and on some days I find the idlis nice and soft but on some days a tad bit hard and chewy. So well, its something of a lottery :P
3. Tea- I LOVE THE TEA ! I know filter coffee is THE thing to have in South Indian restaurants but the tea has occupied a special place in my heart since the first time I had it. Perfectly sweetened I always taste the tea when I go there !

Now, the problem , the major problem with the place is the ambiance, (the interiors are typical Old Kolkata style but well with time a bit more disheveled) particularly the servers. They have young boys working there and it simply breaks my heart to watch them. It is disconcerting to watch that child labor plays such a significant part in some of the most well known joints. However, the food is good and well worth the price.

Very dirty!!! You even got child labors working there... n u got pricing that of a decent outlet - not done!! 
Therez a saying "when a job is done half hearted it shows" n its the case with UDIPI.  the dirty kitchen is real scary.. just a stand in front n you will get a glimpse of the kitchen..a horror show!!
Food taste is ok types ..but you will have real hard time to appreciate the food cuz the they dont clean the table properly..
My wife like the dahi vada so she visits there once month but i dont order anything but stare at the celing cuz its pretty dirty all around. And please dont have children working over there, u have movie star Jeet 's comment about your resturant all framed & kept and you got a small little kid running around and picking up plates.

the very first thing I would clarify is udipi home is not opposite to priya. from deshapriya park crossing if you take the road towards southern avenue and lake it comes on the very 1st right a bylane called jatin das road not lake place. now coming to udipi its an eatery that doubles as a boarding house. the place has been honoured to serve the then president APJ Abdul Kalam and they serve food quite worthy of so. the dosas with the variety of chutneys is too good. this happens to be the only south indian joint where the filter coffee is appropriately sweetened to my taste. certainly worth a visit!!

I have been a regular at this joint since I was a wee one (not to *ahem* brag, but I even have a personal server). The food is gastronomically divine for anyone who prefers good and flavoursome south Indian to the over-spiced and over-fried chinese(?) fare served at flea-ridden joints. The ambiance is not what you would expect of a five-star hotel, but they try their best to keep it clean.This joint is not air-conditioned and rather stuffy, and thus to be avoided at all costs in sweltering months. There are better sitting arrangements inside the house, but that portion is only opened when all the seats outside are occupied. The stuff is polite, and they serve with a smile. 

Now for the food. Their dosas are good and light. I have seen some posters raving about the rava dosa, but it seemed to me that the masala dosa and the dhania dosa were more scrumptious and filling. The coconut chutney is so-so, the dhania chutney is good, but the sambar is foodorgasmic. They have several varieties of uttapam here, and if you are not too much of a purist, you may try and be bowled over by the mixed uttapam, which my server called "south-indian pizza". I found the special thali by and large unsatisfactory, and the tomato-fried rice is not worth having. However, the pongal is better than I had anywhere else, and so is the sambar vada( the sole exception in Kolkata being Hotel Homely Raj, and in Chennai ID). They serve idlis on a banana leaf as a weekend special. Oil and spices are kept to a minimum, which makes this a haven for the health-conscious.

That being said, the usp of this place is filter coffee. Let me just say it would be downright difficult to go back to your cup of nestle once you have got a taste of this brew. The grounded beans are imported from the southern hills, and the aroma they cause is literally breath-taking. If the coffee is too hot for you, you may ask the server to juggle the liquid between two containers and produce an even finer result with just the right amount of froth.The price is cheaper than you would get in fancy cafes (only rs 20/-).
All in all, definitely the place to visit if you are in lake market and are on the lookout for a cheap and delicious bite.

Not the place for you if your idea of a restaurant is a bit on the fine dining side. But if you are famished after watching a movie at Priya Cinema Hall or are tired after roaming in and around Deshapriya Park with a light pocket, this should be your no. 1 destination. A small, quite, no frills place which serves quite nice South Indian, Udipi is located just opposite Priya above ( quite unusually ) over a Public Toilet. However don't let that deter you from enjoying the dosas and idlis here. The menu offers nothing out of the ordinary, though the food is delicious. The 1 good thing is the big glass wall overlooking the park behind. The feel of the place is comfortable and snug and you can always find an extra seat. 

Chakraborty Tip : Go there only if you have time to kill. The kitchen staff takes HOURS to send meals ( This happened on more than 3 occasions ).

Uncle, sitting at the counter is always smiling and shouting out orders to  "Master!" in the kitchen, whenever an order is placed. Have been going to this place since my childhood.

Rao's Udipi Home is NOT located opposite Priya Cinema Hall. There is a restaurant there that calls itself Udipi, but it has no connection with Rao's Udipi Home. The one referred to here is located on Lake Place Road, which is the first road on the right if one goes towards Southern Avenue from the Rashbehari Avenue-Sarat Bose Road crossing.

The restaurant area is the converted front portion of an old house. An inner room is also available, though it is opened only if the outside area is full, or if a large group turns up and wishes to sit together. It serves very simple South Indian vegetarian food. There are long tables that are often shared by customers. A two-page menu lists the items on offer. The prices are very low  - one can have a hearty meal for less than 100 rupees.

The food is very light and rarely oily. Though the quality varies every time I have gone there, I have had good food far more frequently there than bad food. The South Indian Thali is a good option for someone looking for an inexpensive, filling meal. Otherwise, standalone rice dishes like the Lemon Rice are also very good.

Of the dosas had there, a personal favourite is the Rava Masala Dosa (without onions). Their Paper Masala Dosas are also very tasty. Like most traditional South Indian restaurants, unlimited amounts of sambar and chutney are available - sometimes, they leave the chutney containers on the table so the customers can help themselves as frequently as possible without calling for the waiters. The best part about the accompaniments is that this is probably the only restaurant in Calcutta today that still serves three kinds of chutney.

The fruit juice and buttermilk here are well made. The filter coffee is still served in small steel glasses resting within cylindrical bowls. Waiters usually pour the coffee from one container to the other from a fair height to ensure that the coffee is nice and frothy. They also stock locally made Mysore Pak, which can round off a meal quite nicely.

The waiters are polite and the service good  Certain items (usually idlis and vadas) are served almost immediately; others, like the rava dosas, take more time. Of late, the cleanliness of the place has suffered, so the owners should try and address that. It would also be good if they could ensure that all three varieties of chutney be available as long as the restaurant is open - they say they make it three times a day, but sometimes they run out of them very quickly.

As a place for a quick meal or even a leisurely evening coffee with a friend, there are few restaurants to match it in Calcutta.

This very old restaurant is a place for authentic south indian meals. May look shabby to some people but that's the right environment for serving some uttapams, dosas, and ఊరగాయి. Foodies will feel at home. Located near Deshapriya Park, this place caters to the needs of the Tamil communities nearby. 

And some bengali foodies like myself too hop in frequently for some " சுவையான " (read tasty) meals.

Food: 3/5

Well this place is very ordinary and average I would say. This one is located just opposite Priya Cinema Hall. The place serves south Indian food which hints the food is 100% vegetarian. 
The advantage of this one is it can pull crowd due to its convenient location. 
The food is average but not that bad too. The prices are quite low so that is again advantageous.  So I feel if you have to keep your budget low and want some manageable food then this one is actually a good option. 
So I give it 3 for its reasonable pricing and average food but deduct 2 for bad ambience and sloppy service.

The dosas,vadas and idlies they serve are just highly delicious. The fried idly,onion uttapam,onion butter masala dosa and especially the filter coffee they seve are my personal favourites. The service was very slow last time when I visited, considering the fact that it was sunday and the place was full. Udipi home is the right place to have south indian breakfast or Bong's "shondher jolkhabar".

I would actually rate it a 3.5. Rahul has covered the place well and I did not despite having visted here so many times known that it is an old age home. I thought of it to be a simple cheap hotel cause I saw a few youngsters come out of the rooms. Now they have made a part of the rooms open for seating. It is a small eatery, red paint shed on top of your head and small windows. Not a place for a good dine out and very low on decor. Typical tile top tables and small chairs.
The food is good, nice, less oily and they serve three types of chutney, and you can pay to get two more options of chutney.
Try out the South Indian Fried rice or Lemon rice and they are pretty cheap so is the  Thali
Outside hangs a board thanking the then President of India A.P.J Abdul Kalam Azad for having tasted their food on their visit
All in all a good place with good food and do nto miss their Rava Dosas

Simple No frills Attached ... but Brilliant. 

have been here a couple of times.. the place is located in an age old house. id ur expecting anything above ordinary inters of decor and service this is not ur place. 

the south indian thali is a must have here. its filling and not heavy on oil . the dosas, idli, wada, sambhar all r nice.. they serve 3 types of chutneys here. with the dosa . 

one must try the aalo bonda and the murukku with the coffee... 

a stomach full here wud cost u beteen 80 and 120 rs only.. 

total value for money.

The food is amazing. The Mix Uttapum is light and fresh and the Filtered Coffee was as light and lean as water. The South Indian food just felt authentic. The place is a thumbs down when it comes to ambience and atmosphere. All in all it's a nice place if you want to hang out with friends.
