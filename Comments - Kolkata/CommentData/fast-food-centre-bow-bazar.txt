Passing through in Kolkata, you happened to have rolls from many a location that you do not even remember. This is one of those outlets, which I hardly remember but have had tasted various rolls from. Although, the chicken rolls are good but many a times you will find the egg roll too inedible. The paratha they use seems to be fine while tasting the chicken roll but totally different on having an egg one. But well, when you are hungry, you can just have a bite.

It's just a shack but packs a decent punch while serving kati kebabs. The kebab I got served was tangy and smoky, and with saut√©ed onions and bell peppers it tasted rejuvenating. The Egg Chicken Roll on the other hand didn't quite cut it with the best roll corners of the city. They spoil it with their cheap tomato and chilli sauces. The feel of the Paratha dipped in Egg was also funny and it wasn't crunchy. Overall the roll was something I wouldn't have there.

I have been to this place a few time. Their roll is good the Egg roll and Chicken roll both, the paratha of the roll is good. 
But the Chowmine they prepare isn't that good. I tried the Egg Chowmine and Chicken Chowmine both were average.
If you are looking for rolls only then come here. Else I won't recommend this place for Chowmine amd Rice items.
