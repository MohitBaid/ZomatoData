Ordered Dokar Dalna, Cholar Dal Narkel Diye, Chingri Bati Chorchori, Aloo Gobi. First, every item was priced a slightly higher than what was mentioned in the menu. The nearby Tilottoma, which is near Gitanjali Park, doesn't have their own kitchen, so they basically get their cooked item from the Metro Cash & Carry outlet, so you can't really customised as per your taste. We don't like chillies, and a request of not adding chillies was declined saying the food is already cooked in the main kitchens and they just parcel it over here. But the good point is ithe food turned out to not be very spicy. And the bad point, which was supposed to be that main point, the taste is average at best. The Chingri Bati Chorchori is the worst, and not only it lacked salt, but any flavour. It tasted liked it was made by an amateur person and not a chef. The pocket pinch was of 352 and to be honest, I would have agreed it's a low price, if I didn't have to open the container to see it can get an award for holding the least amount of food in a plastic food container ever. They can just use a smaller container for the dal and chingri bati chorchori to be honest and spare the torture. Too little quantity for the price. The cholar dal narkol diye was good enough, and so was the Aloo Gobi and Dhokar Dalna.

Overall service and ambience is good except the food quality. I visited there to have lunch but the restaurant was full empty and the food quality was not up to the standard.

Hello Food Lovers,
Last night visited তিলোত্তমা, firstly location on main road , decoration , well maintained every thing is fine .. food taste was pathetic ...

Ordered
 Chicken kasha 
Kochi pathar jhol 
Dal 
Rice

Both chicken and mutton was seriously pathetic , spend my money for 4 small pieces. And also got a dead fly with chicken...

If they maintain their kitchen , focus o@n food , hire new cook staff then it will be a good food destination  future . But now I can't recommend anyone ..

Visited during Pujas...the time most of the restaurant standards becomes low...but as had visited Moments (same owner) earlier which was quite good..had some expectation...only veg & non veg Thali were available...nothing in ala carte..which is really disappointing for Bengali foods..in which ala carte or add ons r essential..also some dishes mentioned in the Thali was replaced by something different..on confronting they tells that the other dish is finished...really don't know how it can happen when u have fixed Thalis...they served food & water in thermocol vessels & glasses..& charging almost 700 rs without tax...only mutton was good ...so 1 out of 1.5 rating is for the same only

Horrible experience with food. They served us a thali consist of stale and rotten items. I will never go back to this place again and neither recommend anyone. We are group of six and went their for lunch on nabami, they are mostly vacant (which is quite unusual during durga puja), we ordered for "Gajgamini Thali" for us (copied from (Bhojohari Manna) and they served bitter "Ampora sharbat", chingri less "Mocha Chingr", atleat 10 days old "Bhethki Paturi", miniature "Jumo Ilish %#4@", and rotten "Mutton Kassa" with a bill of Rs. 4,800/-. Congratulations "Tilottama" for making a fool of us.

The food is very bad. They serve us all food which is cold. We had taken buffet and they forget  us to serve most of the dishes which was mentioned in the menu. Very bad experience.

Awful home delivery experience. Received the items at 1:30pm after calling them for 4 times while the original time of delivery was at 12:30pm. Missed some items. Had to call them twice again for those missing items. Even switched off their phones as I called frequently. Finally received them at 2:30pm. Could not serve lunch to my guests due to their irresponsibility.

One fine evening I visited this place Nd it was totally unplanned. It's an authentic Bengali restaurant with amazing decoration. Foods are really tasty. I love their dhaniya chicken. Visit is recommended.

This restaurant and the Moments besides it have the same owner, so the decor, the service and all are more or less the same.

I went there in a sultry afternoon. The gateman is a cordial fellow who respectfully ushered me in. The decor is wonderful, I liked the black and white photos of Coffee House and sceneries from Kolkata. There should be sufficient light in the staircase which is black and makes it difficult for people to commute in dim light.
There was no customer when I went there.   As soon as I entered they turned up the AC. I chose a seat besides the big window overlooking the busy crowd passing by. A boy named Subho was my maitre de table.  A very polite and nice fellow. With his help, I chose rava fish fry and lime soda for the consumption then and there. The food arrived within five minutes. The rava fish was bhetki and it tasted crispy and tender which was really enjoyable. The lime soda was however not up to the mark.
I thought I would better pack something for home and chose chicken day banglow and luchi aloo dam. That too arrived within seven minutes.

Luchis were a bit too oily but warm enough. Aloo dam was very tasty. Chicken dish tasted fabulous.
The price is pocket friendly. The packing was good with no leakage. There is ample parking space. 

Overall good experience.

They don't hv all food items in their menu round the clock... It has to work really hard to stand up to its competitors in the city..

Had a really bad experience at this restaurant today. First of all there were a total of 5 ACs and none of them worked. Secondly there were just 4 waiters serving almost 30 people together. We were not even offered a menu card nor did anyone come up to our table to take an order for about half an hr. The manager or owner was ignorant about all our complaints. The food quality was bad as well. We had ordered the nababorsho special thali which was the only thing available today and none of the food items were upto the mark. Overall a very stinking experience. Wouldn't come back to this place again.

So a long awaited visit. Location is quite easily traceable beside the em bypass near metro cash n carry. Coming to the interior not too impressive rather below average. Can't find the classy bengaliaana ambience which can go with the name. Staffs are well behaved and responsive. Food quality is not that much good. Some dishes are unavailable around the clock few of the rests are good some dishes are below average. Some dishes are not freshly prepared.  Overall average one in the city compared to other giant authentic bengali restaurant.

The place is good. Situated beside the EM Bypass, the view is very beautiful, especially during the evening time. The ambience of the restaurant is also very sober. Tilottoma is a bengali-cuisine restaurant iffering traditional delicacies and dishes. The flavour is mouth watering, however if you do not prefer a little spice in your food then it's best to avoid the rich dishes over here. The taste carries with itself a typical homemade flavour and is very appealing. But, the best dish over here, that everyone must have, is the Nolen Gurer ice-cream, you can never have enough of it no matter how much yoh have it.

I gave 1 point extra due to the location of the restaurant and view of EM By pass from the restaurant. Recently on a Saturday I went to have lunch. Interior is just average nothing much. The quality of food is good. We ordered Bengali Veg Thali with Dab Chingri. The DAB chingri was really good. All the items in the Bengali Thali were good except the Mocha. It was average. Nonetheless a good bengali restaurant. The waiters were enthusiastic and tried to do a great job though they lack a bit of polish. But who cares a restaurant runs on quality of food and in that it is worth a visit. Once again the window view of EMByPass was a good memory of the restaurant.
