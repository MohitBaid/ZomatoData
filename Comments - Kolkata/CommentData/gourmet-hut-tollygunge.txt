Been there just today, maybe for the unkempt time and as usually was super happy! Now serve high quality food for really cheap price (all the price in the menu is tax inc.) and that too also in a humongous portion. I went there with my family and we couldn't finish two mixed fried rice by ourselves. The ambience is also nice, nothing fancy though!

The manager was well behaved, although the other staffs need to be more courteous. But the food is really really good quality and quantity. That's why I keep going back to this place again and again. And this place gets a thumbs up from me!

Very ordinary food compared to price. Taste wise it's similar to street food. Noodles were very oily. The shrimps used were stiff and tasteless. The chilli chicken was very sour and overpowered with soya. The soya sauce seemed to be of very inferior quality. Need to improve.  Not recommended.

This restro is very near to my place so i often order and parcel foods from here. The previous location was very catchy but the new one is a bit problem to find out. They have awesome chinese. From starters, gravy, fried rice, chowmein everything is delicious.
But I dont know whats wrong with the cooks nowadays. Recently i had chilli garlic pepper chicken as starter, and parcelled mixed fried rice with garlic chicken for dinner. All the items were sooo very Salty. Complete mess for the dinner. This experience I had even once before this one.

I just love love love love this particular place. Both the quality and the quantity is just amazing. People basically come here for food and they should be fully satisfied. They have widened their place to an extent, the food price is cheap, the quantity is humongous compared to their price (even during the durga puja times which is rare), they allow you to have cold and soft drinks from outside which no other restaurant allows and last but not the least so extra gst is charged although it's an ac restaurant. So anything else you need??? Exactly not. Come and rush to this restaurant If you are staying in South Kolkata. I have come here a couple of times and recommending this to all zomato fellows. The main course are awesome and I am looking forward to try their starters and momos. DEFINITELY AND HIGHLY RECOMMENDED üòò‚úåÔ∏èüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç

WITHOUT DIGGING A WHOLE IN YOUR POCKET THIS PLACE IS KINDA NICE.
FOOD ORDERED : Mixed manchurian rice and Black bean chicken.
TASTE : Taste was pretty basic..the manchurian rice was pretty much on the hotter side..the quantity was enough for two hungry people(depends on how much u can eat though), with a lots of chicken,prawn and eggs in it..The black bean chicken was okayish, nothing special, but the chicken pieces were tender and succulent..
SERVICE : They don't take too much time to serve the food.
AMBIENCE : Well its air conditioned and you can sit and eat your food unless its filled with 20 people because the place is not very spacious..
Overall if you are hungry and in netaji nagar area then you can definitely swing by..

So basically a 3-4table joint in netaji nagar which accommodates 10-12 people at a time..but really a huge satisfaction in terms of Chinese cuisine..They offer different flavours of rice and noodles and the mixed chow or Rice is just loaded with chicken eggs nd prawns.. The side dishes r also available in varieties. The main attraction is the quantity of food they provide within such a limited cost.. Highly recommended for the ample quantity that they serve and the taste is also quite lip smacking just a great value for money

This place is tucked in an alley of Netaji Nagar near to the main road. This place caters to Indian and Chinese cuisines. However, one must not try much with their Singaporean Noodles and the fish items, I have had my share of horrible experiences there. And, the crispy chilly babycorn, I most forgot the actual taste of the babycorn after having it here! Boy, such food items are dangerous. Anyhow, if one sticks to the regular Momo, Chilly Chicken (mind you chicken not fish), Fried Rice, then it is surely good value for money! The plus point is a plate of any dish will be enough of two hungry tummies. 
Ambience, don't expect much. Something or the other happened very other time I visited. I am not quite sure of giving this place a try if I'm in a mood of trying new  food.

Quantity served here is huge.
Ordered Lekmi Chicken,Mixed chow Hakka and Crispy Chicken.
All the platters were just huge in quantity.We two,just couldn't breathe after completing half the food.
Coming to taste,its average.Considering such low priced menu,one shouldn't regret.
In short....More than Pocket Friendly.

A small shack in netaji nagar, this is mainly a chinese restaurant. I visited it once, much prepared for a not-so-good dining experience which one can make out from it's looks and ambience. I ordered Sweet corn soup, dry chilli chicken, egg fried rice and schezwan chicken. The food was not worth the price paid for it. The dry chilli chicken was too salty and the schezwan chicken had less salt. They took a lot of time too. The staff isn't too friendly.
Overall, a bad experience. I probably won't visit this place again.

We've been taking food from this place since 2008. They were brilliant for the first 3years. Last night,we ordered a tonne of food because of a birthday party. Since, we were acquainted with their brilliant mouthwatering food, last night was the worst experience for my entire family. 

We ordered Crispy Spicy Chicken,which was filled with immense amount of cornflour and miniscule amount chicken. We still tried to chew it down, but it was rubbery to even gulp down. We also ordered mixed noodles and rice. The rice became soggy and didn't have any seasoning or salt in it. The noodles, they were a mixture of egg, chicken and prawn. The prawns still had shells and the black fiber which is not supposed to be comsumed. The oil used, made us want to puke everything out. We ordered sweet and sour chicken as our side. Nothing was sweet or sour in the saying and yet again immense amount of cornflour. None of us could barely eat any of it and we had to go out and have dinner somewhere else. 

Just because you have a reputed name in the vicinity,does not mean you can serve inedible food. We paid a good amount of Rs. 1300/- for inedible, indigestible food. The money isn't the factor, the point is, if you're charging so much for such bad food, which probably even you haven't tasted,then you should close down for good.

The hospitality is awful... It seems the waiters are least interested rather getting disturbed by costumers coming in.. Ambience is okay just bcz of the AC, else it's too small and gloomy. I went there for the first time. Experience not satisfactory. 
Lekmi chicken was good but too much tomato sauce. Schezwan rice n hot garlic chicken okay, not at all satisfactory.
With this budget there are alot of better places in Kolkata. Not even worth a try...

Bumped into this place on a rainy evening while yearning for momos. Though their ambiance and service aren't talkworthy, their momos are definitely are.¬†

Shared a plateful each of chicken steamed momos and pan-fried momos with a friend and man, it was tasty and filling! The steamed momos were perfect -- soft shells delicate yet firm enough to hold in the juicy filling -- just the way I like them. The pan-fried momos though delicious are not for the faint-hearted (or rather faint-stomached!) as the generous smothering of hot sauce makes these momos extra-fiery. 
Re-visited this place a couple of times, but ¬†everything else I've tried can be called just about decent. Being a chopsuey lover, I gave their version a try but found it pretty bland and lacking in veggies -- something that I'm very particular of when it comes to chopsueys. 
So I'll recommend this place only for their yummy and reasonably priced momos.

Located near netaji nagar more one of my favourite food joint. The resturant is small but the food is good and it is also pocket friendly.
Had crispy fried chicken which was awesome a must try (tell them in advance if you want less spicy) also had mixed fried rice which was adequate for two and had sizzling chicken which was very good especially the gravy which was a bit dry with minced chicken and all the costed on Rs415. A very good pocket friendly joint.@

Have visited this place more than I can count. 
Small Chinese joint.
I love their starters. Momos and crispy chicken are still my favourite. Portions for the rice/noodles are good. Their delivery service is fast as well. 
Overall pocket friendly and quantity of food is more than sufficient.

Situated near netaji nagar. A small food joint . ordered a home delivery tonight including pan fried momo , Singaporean egg noodles and schezwan chicken. As per price , the quality and quantity both were good. For schezwan lovers, try their pan fried momo. Awesome in taste. For me this is best Chinese food center in this area. Far better than K2 and Grub club. Must try for foodies.

It's a small food joint near Netaji Nagar, quite small but surprisingly the food they serve is quite tasty. We had Veg. Gravy Noodles along with Lekmi Chikcken which was nicely made with shredded chicken, it had a very nice sourly flavour mixed up well with hot and spicy flavour. Over all a nice place to visit for a quick bite. Only problem is with the waiters and untidiness around the joint.

The place might not look so convincing from outside but their chinese cuisine is really good. Space crunch is a big problem in this restaurant and we had to wait half an hour to get a seat. But the wait was worth it. The crispy chilli chicken and crispy baby corn are one of their specialities. And one should definitely try their garlic chicken. Overall the food is really good and prices are also quite reasonable.

A group of 5 cannot even laugh properly without attracting a few angry stares. Then came the food...It was too good..Although its been a year...i vaguely remember having Crispy chicken for starters..Lemon chicken and fried rice while my friend ordered Mixed chowmein and Manchurian Chicken most probably. I had to take some of my order home..My dog had a wonderful feast that day :D

This place is a saviour at times.

A decent place with decent chinese dishes which are worthy, both quantity wise and price wise.

I like the noodles that they serve along with the chicken side dishes.  Though the quality of the rice (that they use to make fried rice) can be better but still, the taste is always good.

This place is located at Nejaji Nagar and not Naktala as specified on Zomato. 

Perfect place for a casual dinning. Being in a locality that boasts of numerous food joints, this place has surely kept up with the competition. I have been ordering food from here for the past decade and trust me their quality has not deteriorated nor has there been an extravagant increase in prices.

Quantity - Ample for two.

Must try - Pepper chicken, Crispy Spicy Chicken (Unique), Shredded Chicken with Capsicum.

My rating of 4 is purely based on quality, taste, quantity and price.

Been there quite a few times..its a small restaurant near the Netaji Nagar crossing..prices are very reasonable..food quality is decent enough considering the prices. In fact food served here surprisingly tastes very good. However, what stand out is the quantity of food they serve in a single plate. A full plate of fried rice here is almost sufficient to meet the needs of two full grown adults. Considering all these and at the prices at which they are served this restaurant is definitely a place where you can drop in if you happen to be near it.

Have visited the joint only once, back in 2012. So my friend suggests this place when I ask her for a low cost yet good restaurant. And on a fine evening, here we were, enjoying the evening food. 

Not to go by the decor or price, this place will give you an excellent ROI (Return on Investment) only because even if they serve food that is reasonably good both in quality and quantity, the price is very low, compared to other big-name restaurants.  

What you should try :

1. Spring Chicken
2. Crispy spice chicken
3. Chicken/Mixed Thuppa
4. American Chopsuye

Lemon chicken, crispy chilli chicken, dry chilli chicken, chilli fish, manchurian, schezuan chicken; moreover they have a lot more options for the choice of rice too... That makes my taste refreshed all the time. A good place to try out; if not for dine-in, they obviously for home delivery or pick ups. Hope, others will have the satisfaction too.

First of all, the location of the Restro is at Netaji Nagar not NAKTALA, Which is about 5 stoppage earlier than Naktala. This place is near the Bus stop, situated at the ground floor of a old mansion. It has some 20 seats to dine, which are full most of the time in evening, specially in the holidays. Though it is known mostly amongst the local foodies, but the food quality , amount, along with the price, is really worth visiting even you are staying far. The Mix Thukpa or the starters like Pepper Chicken, the soups are of great taste. The Meifoons, Tampura fish or the Hunan Chicken are the aces in the main course(tried by me so-far). Though they are a bit in-consistent about the prawn items, & have an inclination of making the things real pungent . In that case also comes their Behaviour ans Service, which sometimes fluctuate drastically ¬†specially when there a long queue is waiting outside.

This is one of the famous food joints in Netaji Nagar, Sounth Kolkata. The food here is really nice. Very good for people who have absolutely low budget for having a good meal. The items are cheap and quantity is good. The restaurant is very small in size, just 4 tables. Most of the orders are take aways. Their Hakka chow and Shanghai chicken is very good. and I love the crispy chilli babycorn. It is a normal "para" restaurant, where there is no point ordering hi fi food or experimenting with them. It is advisable to order the regular tried and tested items.
Cost for 2 in my case: 450 (no alcohol).

GOURMET HUT - A POPULAR EATERY IN THE SOUTH OF KOLKATA!
2 out of 5

Gourmet Hut is a very popular food joint amongst the residents of Naktala. The place offers decent and average cooked Chinese fare. The place is a good option for a low cost meal. There is nothing much to add about the ambience, as it is a very small and ordinary looking food outlet. Yet, this small and ordinary restaurant serves food in quantities that are overwhelmingly generous.  The food quality is good without being extraordinary. Even for such a small place, the fast and efficient service deserves appreciation. They provide both indoor and outdoor sitting arrangements. At the same time, they do home delivery - something I seriously recommend as it will give you an honest basis for appreciating their food.

Non veg starters like chilli chicken, chicken pakora, pepper chicken, and fish pakora find a lot of takers though I have never had them. They are juicy and soft meat items. Their soups like manchow soup, Thai soup and hot and sour soup are spicy without being fiery hot and contain a generous amount of meat pieces and vegetables. Their soups can be followed by their delish veg and non veg sides. Veg side dishes (gravy) like veg Manchurian, chilli mushroom, and veg mushroom are best had with plain fried rice. Their non veg dishes like chilli fish, sweet and sour fish, hot garlic prawns, lemon chicken and Sichuan chicken are delightful preparations. Their noodles are light and soft textured preparations with a good amount of meat.

Their thukpa preparations are average at best. Their very limited chicken momo offerings are stomach filling and juicy bite-sized food options but not the best in town. They do not offer any kind of dessert items to end your meal; an area seriously lacking - dessert options should definitely be introduced.

People not enjoying super hot taste, warn them before hand, otherwise you will be unpleasantly surprised. I did not like the prawns over here, as they were not that fresh. Did not expect a lot either, so it was not much of a disappointment. My recommendation would be to have formulaic Chinese food over here i.e. fried rice, chilly chicken etc.
