Food is great and one plate is more than enough for two people. Great mocktail I must say. However options are very less. 
Service is very good and friendly.
Ambience is somewhat weak though. Visited in the afternoon and found nothing like in the posted photos. However the eating space, helpful staff and good food made up for that.

Find this place on Zomato and happened to visit it yesterday for lunch. Nice experience I would say. Splendid Decor and the spacious seating arrangement need a special mention. Staffs were courteous, service was fine.
We started with their mocktails and then for main course we ordered Egg Fried rice,Chicken Noodles and Pan Fried Chicken Noodles with Chilli Chicken and Hot and Garlic Fish. Liked the food overall except for the Pan Fried Noodles.Loved the Hot and Garlic fish.
Worth a try. 
Do try their mocktails if you pay a visit. 'Forever Young' is a personal favorite.

Gravity is located at webel more sector 5.. My office is very near by of this place. We had a team lunch yesterday. And I am very much satisfied with the gesture and of course for the food.. We ordered mutton biriyani, chicken biriyani and chicken masala, mutton kosha as side dish in non veg.. Peas polao and chilli paneer in veg.. The bill was around 1800/-.. The tastes of each and every items is just mouthwatering.. I loved their biriyani more.. But the quantity was less than the others restaurant.. Still I will recommend that place as it provides reasonable prices.. And they have large number of food items.. The decoration of this place is also very good.. They also have so many mocktails in the menu..

This is a relatively new place and hence you will get excellent staff behavior who are keen to make sure you are having a great time with the food. The food is also good. Quantity is more than sufficient and it's cost effective too. Though the chicken pieces in chilli chicken needed to be a bit softer. Seats are good and ambience too. This place will be a big hit once they set up a bar too.

I should give them five out of five starts for the ambience. It was well decorated and they gave a separate room for 8 of us. The waiters were also well behaved. But the quality of the food could have been better. We ordered Indian combo which had 2 naans, dal makhani, rice, a chicken dish and salad. Besides, we tried chicken reshmi butter masala. Taste was average but the quality of the chicken was bad.

The decor and lighting of the place is pretty cool. We celebrated my friend's anniversary there and had prebooked it. The staff and the waiter were decent and provided us with good service and the necessary assistance .
Coming to food it was not bad though the butter nan we ordered were notupto the mark but remaining side dishes and the starters were pretty good .
The pocket pinch is also quite low and u can get good value for money .

Visited this place on dashami with my fianceüòä We had no idea where to go as we had visited almost every place in sector 5,So we searched in zomato. Its newly opened and strongly recommended for everyone.Its a cozy place with comfy seating sofas,Very neat and tidy and nice decor.Nice music and everything is very pleasant.We had ordered hot and sour soup,dragon chicken ,butter nun and chicken dopiaza.The food was tasty and price was on okay too.Like worth the food.Not too overpriced not too low.The food was slighting rich with masala.Else it was nice.Overall we had an awesome experience at this place.We event got a 10% discount voucher for our next visit. We will definetely visit this place again.The behaviour of the staff was courteous and nice too.We loved the place.Its perfect for couples and friend groups‚ò∫Hope this place opens up a bar soon,then it would just be an icing on the cakeüòÅ Keep up the good work.All the bestüòä

first i would life to mention the good things there.the ambiance is amazing cozy with a big screen and good set up and a.c.their lighting and structural pattern is beautiful.the next good thing is the price of the food.the mughlai item seems  to be cheap rather than chinese.but yes gst is there to increase it.
i ordered chicken biriyani and chicken butter masala.butter masala was amazing in taste it goes well with the biriyani.but the quantity of the biriyani is so less that we had to order another one.after eating 2-3 spoons the biriyani tasted extremely odd because if too much use of garam masala.the chicken piece in the biriyani is full of garam masala and tasted really really bad then we regret for ordering another biriyani.the chicken pieces (4)in the gravy was quite large.i didnt get the opportunity to taste their chinese cuisine.but biriyani is such a special item and in puja time the restaurant is empty and they are providing such an aweful biriyani has proves not to be a happy experience.
staffs were good in behaviour but they dnt even  serve the food in the plate.last but not the least thing they have sofas and a big table as seat.its extremely uneasy to have food with such a distance...
