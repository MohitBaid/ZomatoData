Although a bit overpriced, the non veg kebab platter is a must try. Served sizzling hot and delicious, along with chutney, you won't regret ordering it. Service is moderately quick. Food is good. Staff is friendly. Ambience is good of course, if you're able to find yourself a table as the food court in Quest Mall is usually quite crowded.

Recently visited this place situated in 4th Floor of Quest Mall..... Its in food court area ....... They were having a Khichdi festival that time.... 10 different type of khichdi were on offer and all of them were very interesting .... Sabudana Khichdi, Methi Khichdi, Mong Dal Khichdi which I tried and all the khichdi were served with 5 kinds of accompaniments with veg and non veg options..... Taste was out of the world.... 5 Star Hotel quality with absolute emphasis on presentation ...... Pocket pinch very pocket friendly........

Located in Quest Mall's Food Court area...this one's a North Indian food serving kitchen...

Me n my Mom ordered ---

Butter Naan --- It was really very good...One f the best i have had till date for sure...Perfectly made as one would love their butter nans to be like...Moreover its served with a very tasty pickle and onion rings on the side... :) 

Chicken Butter Masala --- The flavour was spot on...
Gravy was delicious and chicken pieces were soft n melted in the mouth...So no complaints on this one too... üòÄ

I had tried some other dishes here before also with my Mom...don't remeber them exactly but maybe Kadhai Chicken n some fried rice or pulao with it...The chicken was very tasty i remember...


So overall a very nice place to have North Indian food in Quest Mall... üòé
There are nice combos to try out as well which seem good value for money... :)

Cold drink was flowing in carry bag and even gas was missing 
Only 2 capsicum pieces were there with paneer and were not fresh Only dal seemed a bit fresh and Nan was as good as chewing gum 
No salads No disposable plate or even spoon 
Delivery boy though was good and ensured delivery within timelines Food quality requires huge improvement

I am a moody person, my mood swings not only determine my tantrums but also the kind of food I want to have. Sometimes, I crave for something really spicy. At such occasions, my choice would be Masala Kitchen at the Q Court.
They have the tastiest Chola Batura; full of flavors and spices. A must try when you‚Äôre hungry and craving for some North Indian tadka amidst your shopping spree.

Masala Kitchen, a part of QCourt, is one of the most dependable stalls of a food court that I have ever been to. The place offers North Indian delights, and their Chhola Bhatura is a must have. The huge, puffed up bhatura was nice and crispy, and once inside the mouth, it felt deliciously glutinous. The spicy chole went perfectly with it. The pickles and onions pulled the whole dish together. A great option for veg lovers!

If you're looking for decent¬†North¬†Indian¬†food in Quest Mall, this is the place to visit. The menu has a number of options to choose from. What I had here was the¬†Chola¬†Batura, which is their bestseller. The size of the batura was huge. It was served with a bowl of spicy chickpea curry, pickles and onions. The batura was crispy and went well with the chickpea curry. One portion of this is well enough for two people.

Masala Kitchen is a place to get amazing food situated right at the food court of Quest Mall known as Q Court. By the name itself you can clearly identify the preparations to be spicy and a full hands down tasty affair.So saying so  recently an invitation had come from First Idea Pr represented by Anisha & Somenath to try out the food and share the beauty of it.Well that sounded very fine to me and it was an interesting time to review a food court counter than the usual full fledged ones. Over here the Chana Bhatura was tried which looked larger than life in appearance almost the size of 3 to 4 normal baturas .I was amazed to know that it is actually served the exact way in their menu and it is been one of the specials here till date. The accompanying curry was a yummy chana indulged one which was pretty neat to go with and does not give you any reasons to complain about.
If you happen to visit this place anytime do keep this on your order list to experience it as it is the biggest one in the city for sure.

Masala kitchen is probably the best option to have North Indian food at reasonable prices at Quest mall and it's definitely the only North Indian food option available at the QCourt. When we were last here for a food trail we tried their signature dish which is Chola Bhatura, and trust me it's truly impressive and was packed with flavours. 

The Bhatura was huge and enough for two people, though the stuff was bit crispy and less stretchy or a tad less tender. The chickpeas curry was tangy, spicy and flavourful and went so well with the Bhatura. Also onions dipped in vinegar and pickles were served along with this. So that was a pretty filling evening snacks. Price is pretty reasonable as well and service is warm and prompt. Surely worth a try!

Cheers!

An easy to find outlet in the food court of the Quest Mall, kolkata.

The size, yes the size, the one thing that attracted me the most when i saw people taking Chole Bhature in tons from this outlet. Since Delhi doesn't offer such a huge size bhatura, I was mesmerized and excited to have it all.

So I ordered Chole Bhature - They were yum, the chana's were well cooked and were spiced up with all the Indian spices and it was tangy, delicious and drooling enough.

The bhatura as I said was huge, not so oily and trust me it was enough for 2 people.

Goodluck üòá

I don't usually have food from food courts in malls. I prefer paying a premium for better food and services. However, I was really impressed with Masala Kitchen. I ordered Tandoori Chicken Tikka which is served on a sizzler, Masala Kulchas and Raan E Kurchaan (small boneless pieces of Mutton cooked in spicy gravy with capsicums and tomatoes), and given the price, I was surprised with the portions and the taste. If you are craving Indian food in Quest Mall and are on a budget, then try this. It is full value for money.

Two weeks back, I along with all the family members were invited to Food Court of Quest for celebration of my grandparents anniversary. That day, we ordered from all different outlets and had fun tasted each of the items. During that quest for food, I also happened to taste good from Masala Kitchen.

Since I haven't personally placed the order there, I am unable to comment what combo pack it was. However, it contained - 1 roti made into half, a plate of paneer, a bowl of dal and a pickel to enhance the taste. It was cutely served in a good looking disposable plate.

Though, I haven't ordered the items, I was there to take it once served. The people out there are polite enough and does their job in decent pace.

The roti was good, but, the dal was exceptional. Yes, it was so good that I literally licked my fingers having the roti dipped in it. The paneer was okayish and nothing grand. Overall, the quantity seemed to be less for even a person having it.

A visit is recommended!

A comparatively affordable place amidst the other restaurants in Quest. I have tried the veg n non veg combos and panner and chicken items separately. Found the paneer tikka masala amazing. Even in the veg combo meals the paneer preparations were to my liking ( big chunks, well marinated tikkas, flavoured gravy). Portion size won't disappoint and service time is commendable all the times I have been there.

Paratha Platter @ Masala Kitchen - Food Court of Quest Mall, Kolkata ‚ò∫

Event: Paratha Festival

Venue: Masala Kitchen, a food counter in the food court of Quest Mall, Kolkata

Date: 2nd to 31st Jan, 2017

Time: 4 pm - 7 PM

5 veg and 2 non-veg Parathas adorn the menu of this ongoing food festival at Masala Kitchen. This festival entitles you to enjoy any of the 4 specified Parathas at the flat menu price of Rs. 150/-. 

The vegetarian options are - Paneer Paratha, Moong Dal Paratha, Mooli Paratha, Gobi Paratha and Rajama Paratha. We opted for all the parathas except the Gobi Paratha.

4 big albeit relatively thin and oily Parathas were served along with a bowl of curd, some mixed pickle and green chutney. Filling was stuffed generously in Rajama Paratha and good enough in Moong Dal Paratha. They tasted nice but little dry. Both Paneer Paratha and Gobi Paratha had less filling. The former one still tasted nice, but the latter one tasted quite bland. The aforesaid accompaniments tasted average. 

The service was fast and the staff was quite patient in explaining the platter concept to those who enquired.

Serves slightly over priced north indian food, nothing spectacular about it. The food looks really amazing, but disappoints with taste. I had Chana Bhature which was kinda all right. Chana lacked the typical punjabi taste! Bhature was more oily than I would have liked. Service was slow.
The sizzler smelled fantastic though! I'll keep that for next time :-)

We ordered this Special Non-Veg Combo for lunch.
Having a Non-veg starter, a Nun/Roti, Rice, Dal, a Veg main (Mix Veg), a Non-veg main (Dhaniya Chicken), Salad, Coke and a hot Gulab Jamun.
Quantity was sufficient for two people.

For the non-veg starter, it was a four piece boneless kebab. Not well marinated as a result of which the chicken was pale and tasteless inside.
The nun was well enough. The rice was just plain white rice. The dal was good but felt like it was missing something. They called it Mix Veg but I don't know what kind of Mix only has aloo in it. NOTHING other than potato.
The Dhaniya Chicken was the one I liked quite a much. I was expectating something different and very basic.
Gulab Jamun was warm and good for a sweet ending.
Overall, it is a complete meal. In ‚Çπ422 (including taxes) serving two people.. it is reasonable but there is definitely scope for improvement.

Ordered one Panter Butter Masala and one Yellow Daal Tarka (both are recommended by the restaurant) today at 6.44 pm. 
Here is the review of the total experience of dealing with the restaurant.

1. The food arrived very late (at 8.10 pm).

2. Food is below average, very oily and doesn't taste good.

3. BUT, the most amazing and worth mentioning thing is the behaviour of the delivery person.

4. After arriving late, he refused to come to my door at the second floor and called me so that I collect the food from him downstairs.

5. When I refused to go down, the man, very reluctantly, delivered the food to my doorstep, BUT, again uttered something which was borderline abusive.

I AM REALLY AMAZED TO WITNESS THE RUDE, RELUCTANT, ARGUMENTATIVE AND UNPROFESSIONAL ATTITUDE OF THE RESTAURANT EMPLOYEE.

I Visited masala kitchen with family in quest mall.To be honest food was of average taste, preparation was slow but hygiene standard looked ok from the counter.Just out of habit i was having a glance at the bill while waiting for the food and saw service charge of 5% was added in the bill in addition to service tax 6% and vat 14.5%(which is explainable) BUT IT'S A SELF SERVICE COUNTER and I HEARD THE STAFF CALLING US LOUD FROM THE COUNTER TO TAKE OUR ORDER.I have no problem in self service as i am a house wife but WHY CUSTOMERS ARE CHARGED SERVICE CHARGE when no one serving them,no one is ¬†taking order from them.When i asked the same question to the staff there he had no answer to this,he just managed to mumble few words like"sir yha ase hi hota hai i am just an employee".We as customers think its just few bucks so no one bother to take stand against organised loot like this.I mean how shameless you have to be to ask for money from customers for the job they are NOT doing,it resembles some one i know who sits in railway station footpath and ask for money for doing nothing(apologies for sarcasm).Management must address this issue asap and stop looting the innocent customers like this.I hope after reading this review some customers will notice the same and confront the management there. I am ¬†adding the photo of the bill just ¬†incase management or someone else needs it for themselves.best regards.

Masala kitchen is located on the 4 th floor of quest mall. We ordered the special veg combo. The food was exceptional and importantly the people manning the counter were really pleasant to deal with.

I am not particularly fond of North Indian food. But the food was such that I definitely want to reorder from this counter.

Our order consisted of

Special veg combo
Paneer tikka 
Salad pickle 
Rice 
Bread
Dal makhni
Kashmiri Aludum
Paneer butter masala
Coke 

Add on
Garlic naan

Quantity was really good. Hygiene and presentation were spot on too.
Special mention to the dal makhni. It was creamy and  super delicious. I will say it is the best Indian food I've eaten in any food court in Kolkata. It definitely worth a try and I'm gonna revisit soon.

Ordered one Panter Butter Masala and one Yellow Daal Tarka (both are recommended by the restaurant) today at 6.44 pm. 
Here is the review of the total experience of dealing with the restaurant.

1. The food arrived very late (at 8.10 pm).

2. Food is below average, very oily and doesn't taste good.

3. BUT, the most amazing and worth mentioning thing is the behaviour of the delivery person.

4. After arriving late, he refused to come to my door at the second floor and called me so that I collect the food from him downstairs.

5. When I refused to go down, the man, very reluctantly, delivered the food to my doorstep, BUT, again uttered something which was borderline abusive.

I AM REALLY AMAZED TO WITNESS THE RUDE, RELUCTANT, ARGUMENTATIVE AND UNPROFESSIONAL ATTITUDE OF THE RESTAURANT EMPLOYEE.

This restaurant is located at 4th Floor of Quest Mall, Ballygunge. North Indian dishes are in the chart. I took special non-veg combo thali for last Thursday dinner. They store few dishes at front desk in metal pot (Kalash). It looks neo-classical. In the said thali one naan, rice, chicken tikka, mutton masala, dal tadka, aloo dum, salad, paneer masala, papad & one hot Gilab jamun are all. This thali is enough for a heavy foodie like me! Price tag is also reasonable. Mutton curry tastes different (little bit sour) but good and tendered. Very good experience.

It comprised of a kind of chicken kebab, naan, tandoori roti, rice, dal, aloo dum, a chicken main course, mixed veg pickle, salad, green chutney and gulab jamun. Though the plate looked quite appealing, food was just average. Service is promt.
Value for money 2.5.

One of the better places to try North Indian cuisines, this one is located in the food court of Quest Mall. Had tried the Chole Bature, and was served with a large piece of Bhatura. The Chole was absolutely lipsmacking with a spicy and flavorful taste. Although, based on my personal opinion, the Chole Bature served at Howrah Food Court still beats this one by a long margin! Nevertheless, a decent place to be, the pricing here is quite affordable, and the service is pretty fast as well. Would try dropping in here in the future, to try the rest of the delicacies!

Masala Kitchen serves some nice north indian food. Though this is not my first option when I am at Quest but it definitely is a nice eating place. The chhole bhature here are really nice. The bhatura is quite big and is definitely quite filling. The food in my opinion is good but not really spectacular. But the place will definitely not leave you grumpy as the food is pleasant enough.  I think the price is also decent too. Not too high. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone looking to satisfy their north indian craving after shopping at Quest! 
Happy Dining!

Had paneer butter masala with plain naan, but was not quite satisfied with the taste of the paneer, since I've tasted paneer butter masala in many places in Kolkata and other parts of the country. Their chana batura was fairly good. If one's looking for some quick North Indian food then one should pay a visit to Masala Kitchen in Quest to add 'masala' to the experience of eating.

Masala Kitchen is the one and only place to go to if you're in Ballygunge looking for good North Indian food.

Location: it is situated at the food court of Quest Mall, right beside Desi Street.

Food: sells more or less North Indian food. The items made here are lip smacking. Totally worth the price.
Their combo meals are over the roof. And frankly, much more economical and wise to order than just a side with your carbohydrate.

Murgh Tikka Masala: boneless pieces of chicken in red masala curry topped with circles of curd. Spicy as North Indian food goes, this dish is an absolute winner. (4.5/5)

Chicken Bharta: Masala Kitchen serves its Chicken Bharta in a big bowl with lots of curry. This boneless pieces of heaven, and is a brilliant choice if you're a first timer at this place. (3.5/5)

Butter Naan: excellently made. Definitely a better substitute than their other options in the bread section. (4.5/5)

Management: their service is fast and professional. The staff there are courteous. This place has an open kitchen and one can see how they keep a good check on cleanliness.

We just tried chana bhatura as it looked really tempting - with the king-size bhaturas. We were skeptical about the authenticity of the Punjabi taste, but we went for it anyway, and were not disappointed - it tasted pretty decent, and was quite filling too - good portions. Good for a quick and yummy dinner when at Quest Mall.

Pujo lunch. At 500 rs. Incl. Surely not a cheap option. Pulao was pretty sugary, fries were very nice but little too much salt, that probably to balance the overly sweet Pulao. Dal was run of Mill, mishti doi was average. So all in all nothing spectacular in a too high price.

Had been there when we had ordered from Mezze, that was an awful experience, nevertheless this place was the same..
The breads are cold and like papad. The gravy items are hot, way too much oily, and the hygiene is not maintained by the staffs.
The food quality has really become very bad. Moreover the staffs are not at all attentive, nor they are courteous. If you ask them to serve you a certain piece of chicken or serve with less oil, they will just refuse or ignore it. This is the hospitality what they have been and are being trained with.... 
Hope they take it into consideration and do something about it.

Masala kitchen @ Quest Mall food court.

I think this is my Fourth visits in last one year. My apologise I never wrote a review about this place.

I must say, Restaurant type quality and taste at a food court outlet. It will give all restaurents run for their money.

We organised a small birthday party on 11 aug 2015 and they provided a separate cubicle for a party of around 30 to 40 persons.

Very good service. Smiling face.

All items, from baby corn, Paneer tekka, kulcha, naan, mix Veg, to Paneer , jeera rice to biryani , etc. Everything was very tasty. The birthday's cake was also delicious.

All very fresh. Amazing consistency in quality from the last one year. Keep doing good work guys.

Every time I visited Quest Mall, I had my meal everywhere else but Masala Kitchen. So finally when came it's turn, we had Chola Bhatura there.!

Did someone tell you that they serve a Giant size bhatura.? Nope.? Trust me, the bhatura is not large, its giant size.!
One bhatura can suffice for 2 people for a meal.!
The quantity of Chola was also appropriate and not very pricey too.!

They said their Biryani is good, shall try their Biryani someday.!

Situated in the food court of the Quest Mall, this outlet is quite a strong contender among the other outlets on the floor. The food quality is well above the average mark. The menu is nicely made out to provide complimenting morsels in a single item. Combo meals are definitely good choices one could have. The place follows self-service, which I favour as its always better than having a bad one. Finally, the prices are slightly above the food court benchmark, but its justified as long as quality holds on.

Some great stuff at Masala Kitchen. The staff there is extremely polite and takes your order quickly. The food is fantastic, while being reasonably priced.

We had ordered one combo order, which included roti, black dal and paneer. It is just wonderful to eat and a great choice to go for the simple basics. The combo also included other side dishes and a drink.

Definitely a must visit for good North Indian food.

For all other wheelchair users, Quest Mall is completely wheelchair friendly from top to bottom, including wheelchair accessible restrooms. You will have no problem accessing any of the restaurants there and the same goes for all restaurants in the food court, including Masala Kitchen.

Having gone there "n" number of times, i can safely say that for quality north indian food, please do not look anywhere else.¬†

the chicken chaap with paratha is amazing. So is the Mutton Dum biryani. For the vegetarians, please try the chole bhature....¬†
The service is quite fast and the staff very courteous. ¬†Almost everything there is quite good.¬†

One of the best options to eat in Quest.

Masala Kitchen is a part of the Quest Mall food court and offers some relief by serving some affordable yet delicious food in the otherwise super expensive mall. Quest Mall is full of high end restaurants which are really expensive so having this place inside the food court is a blessing in itself! 
Staff is superb and efficient, takes orders and serves food quite fast. I have been here innumerable times because I love their food. 
They serve this dish called the chicken Reshmi kebab which is basically minced chicken sizzler! It's super delicious. It has all the amazing flavours of a brilliant chicken seekh kebab and it is served like a sizzler with lots of vegetables. The kebab itself is quite filling, rich in taste and flavours the portion is huge for one person to actually finish this one.
Their chole batura is equally good and humongous!
I would really recommend this place to anyone and everyone who wants to have quality food inside a food court, trust me guys this place is a little gem tucked away in a corner! Please give it a try!

Their kebabs r really good so is their combo meals with dal , non veg kebab and butter naan and salad. It is not out of the world but it surely is better than most of the food court food compared to the other malls in the city.

Some great stuff at Masala Kitchen. The staff there is extremely polite and takes your order quickly. The food is fantastic, while being reasonably priced.

We had ordered one combo order, which included roti, black dal and paneer. It is just wonderful to eat and a great choice to go for the simple basics. The combo also included other side dishes and a drink.

Definitely a must visit for good North Indian food.

For all other wheelchair users, Quest Mall is completely wheelchair friendly from top to bottom, including wheelchair accessible restrooms. You will have no problem accessing any of the restaurants there and the same goes for all restaurants in the food court, including Masala Kitchen.

After winning a voucher at the social media contest of QCourt, I visited Masala Kitchen..I appreciate the behaviour of the staff...They are very gentle and sober to their customers...We ordered for Murg Malai Tikka at the starter and Kosha Mangsho and Butter Naan for the main course. All the dishes were very tasty. Service is fast and nice.

Food--> Cost-to-food quality good,
Ambience-->Good
To round it off,comparatively one of the cheapest¬† places in Quest Mall to dine-in
Mutton Biriyani-> Rich gourmet meal for everyone,quantity generous enough.
Tandoori Chicken:- Served hot and sizzling.Was delicious and the spices&herbs topping was good.
It could beat¬† any famous restaurants of Kolkata¬† serving North Indian platter, and the authenticity of recipe is commendable.

Vsited this food kiosk which is located in the food court of Quest Mall during puja.We were wandering what to choose between all available options like Desi Treat,Chinese Soup,Masla kitchen,Kfc etc .Decided to gave a shot to north indian based Masla kitchen :-) .We were hungry and immidiately ordered pulao ( mixed veg one) and Chicken bharta .Although there was a waiting list as it was during puja,they served the food fast .

Food ( in brief ) -
1.Pulao was decent .

2.Chicken bharta was nice and very tasty !¬†

3.Food was freshly prepared and hot :-) .

4.Accompaniments -freshly cut onion with masala which was tasty too.

service :-

Service was too good and very prompt .

Quantity was good.

They included enough spoons and dishes which I liked.

Price :-

Chiken bharta-250/-(including taxes)

Pulao- 130/- ( including taxes )¬†

So our bill was 380/- which is quite right with respect to the great lunch we had there :-) .

Be there If you visit Quest mall !

The last time we had been to this place was on July 6th, it was raining terribly and we were damn hungry. The smell of this joint took us closer to them in a way. :D
We ordered Murg Malai Tikka Masala along with breads, the food was ready within 15 minutes and it was really tasty. :) Hope to visit it again by next week.

This is the only food joint in Quest Mall that I have tried out yet and that too twice. Try their Garlic Naan and Dum Aloo. Both I think are the best dishes you get here. The dum aloo is not the regular dum aloo, its mildly spiced with methi. Try it and you won't regret it. We got a chicken kebab too but I didnt like that one! I felt it tasted a bit bitter. Their Mutton/Chicken chaap are also good. Give it a try :)

We visited the outlet for a late dinner.We ordered Mutton Biryani,Non-Veg & Veg thali.The biryani was good but the food served in the thalis was not fresh at all.The naan was thin & hard.The paneer was smelling & so were the other dishes in the thali.Overall not a good experience.

Update November 2014
On a recent visit, the chicken served was smelly, as in it was not fresh, but not gone bad. I did point out later and they offered a replacement, but by then I was full. I tried the same a few days later and was relieved to find fresh chicken.

----------------------------------
Visited this outlet at the fourth floor of Quest Mall during lunchtime. I was at first interested in the kabab meal, until I found out it just had a tandoori chicken piece apart from dal rotis and rice. They also had a kabab player but that was expensive at Rs 550. The person at the counter explained the options patiently.

I looked elsewhere but not finding anything exciting, decided to have a Mutton Roganjosh. I asked for a couple of buttered Tandoori Rotis, which were well made, and of atta. They were kind enough to add in some onion salad. The mutton was expensive at Rs 250 for two pieces.

Food was ready in about seven minutes. Unfortunately I was clumsy and footed done odds my Pepsi, which was anyway too watery. They did not like it when I mentioned it. The two initial pieces off mutton were all bony, and I made them replace it.

Turned out to be a tasty meal. The mutton was nice, the pieces soft and the gravy just right... Not too spicy. The Rotis, as mentioned previously were very nice.

Wish they would look at their pricing. Worth a visit otherwise.

Good Food, Reasonable Price and a great ambiance to start with. Ordered  Mutton Seekh kebab, Fish with Gravy complimented with Plain rice and a Chicken tengri kebab. Food was served within 10 minutes steaming hot, Kebab has very juicy unlikely what you expect in a food court. Price wise its cheaper than the other food court I have visited in the recent past. Also got two chocolate pastry as a promotional offer from them. Overall a very nice experience will definitely visit again..

MASALA KITCHEN - North Indian Food at Quest Mall. 
=====================================================================================================
Brief: 

Masala Kitchen is located at 4th floor, Food court in quest mall. It‚Äôs like a kiosk at the food court.  Masala Kitchen has a variety of north Indian food to choose from. 
=====================================================================================================
Food:

The Thali: We ordered the thali, which had the following:-

‚Ä¢	Yellow Dal: It was a good change from usual dal makhani. However, dal was thick and tasted good.
‚Ä¢	Panner butter masala: It was okay, not too great. 
‚Ä¢	Aloo: It was spicy and tasted good.
‚Ä¢	Gulam Jamun: It was delicious. It was served sizzling hot and I totally enjoyed it.
‚Ä¢	Tandoori Roti: Was crispy and served hot 

Along with this Rice, Onion and pickle was also served. 
=====================================================================================================

Pros 

1.	Service was fast 
2.	Food was hot 
3.	Quantity was good 

Cons 
1.	Panner didn‚Äôt taste good.
2.	Apart from panner aloo and mix veg there should be more vegetable curry as option.
=====================================================================================================
Overall, Masala kitchen has good north Indian food and should be given a try if you want to try north Indian food and have visited quest mall.

After a much awaited break from the daily chores of life, had an opportunity to visit Quest Mall this Sunday. Hearing much about all the fine restaurants in Quest Mall, I decided to give a random try to one of the mall's restaurant. To be honest, my first attempt was  Chili's but could not proceed with the option as there was a huge waiting list. Then I saw Masala Kitchen located at the extreme end of the food court and made up my mind for some good North Indian food.

The food I must say is extraordinary. It beats many famous North Indian cuisine restaurants in Kolkata when it comes to some authentic food. We tried out Mutton Biryani, Murg Malai Tikka Masala, Lucknowi Gosht, Chicken Lasooni Tikka along with some Naan. The Lucknowi Gosht was awesome along with all other dishes we ordered. The naans were big and the thickness was just perfect. Apart from Chicken and Mutton, Fish and Paneer kebabs and dishes are also available.

Prices were very nominal considering the quantity of food and the tastes. Service is really fast and our food was ready in flat 15 minutes despite of the huge crowd. Crowd management is good and Masala Kitchen does not entertain queue breakers while taking order.

All and all, a very good restaurant and if you love North Indian food you will surely love Masala Kitchen.

Last visit i had seen this bhatoora being served and I kicked my diet plans and decided to order a plate. Also i was very enticed by kathal biriyani on the menu ! 

I ordered the thali for a take away and i was told that it wan not possible . I don't understand when Mezze can pack a combo meal why cant they !  

Disappointed i took solace in the kathal biriyani which too was not available. Especially now when kathal is in peak season i don't see the reason for it being not available  

The choola bhatora was more of a Choola puri and not a bhatoora . The poori was nice and big but the chhole was a let down . They missed a punch . They didn't taste bad, but I get better chholey siting at home from my cook . 

Overall a disappointment, I probably just hoped a lot . Lesson learnt.

One of the many new places to open at Quest Mall and located in a corner of the food court this place caught my eye because on one of my previous visits I saw people sitting at the next table eating a Chola Bhatura that looked huge and smelt good too. I was too full that day but returned a few days later to sample it and it was pretty good and very filling. Pricing is decent and the food we were served was freshly prepared.

Again for a food court i dont think the food gets better than this.... i had the veg biryani and it was very very good... the people were helpful and they served well... the plate was fully loaded and the taste was very nice... the yogurt was fresh and we asked them if they could give us some extra onions and pickle and they were more than happy to serve us... 

next time i want to go and try the Chola Bhatura for a simple reason that the Bhatura is HUGE!!!!! i mean bigger than cream centers also....

i liked the food and it is not that exp also...
