Kheer er shingara is the main attraction of this outlet for me. It is just beautiful, delicate and delicious without being too sweet. 
Apart from that, the mishti doi and amritti are also popular.

It was a awesome experience when I went to Amrit sweet shop at the noon of a summer day. It is located nearby Shyambazar Five point. When I tried a var of Misti dahi, my mind was changed for the delicious teaste. It gived me to reduce my tiredness. That day I tried 3 var Misti dahi. And also in this shop, Talshas and Khirer Singara was very renouned for their quality of teaste.

Amrit is located at Shyambazar, mainly sells sweets & snacks.

Bong simple ambience with quick service.

Tried their Misti doi and khirer singaara. Both were awesome and had perfect sweetness balance. A must try. In fact they are very famous for their Misti doi.

Pocket pinch is friendly.

Amrit is famous for the 'Doi'.. they have variety of sweets too. The Doi is not very sweet, but just perfect! The singaras are tasty too! Do try out the singaras and sweets if you are in fariapukur area in Shyambazar.
