Located at the 4th floor of Forum Mall, this little and cosy bakery is an absolute must visit for my chocoholic tongue every time we go to Inox Forum for a movie. I absolutely love the grilled chicken sandwich there. However the star attractions for me are the ones with chocolate in them and trust me, each and every one of those taste delicious and take you well over the moon. I just simply have to munch on something from Biscotti either before or after the movie. Would go back again and again. The space is quite limited, else would have given 4.5 stars easily. The 4 stars is entirely for the amazing fare that this place has to offer.

Got my hands on these tiny cute cupcakes from biscotti. 
The chocolate frosting was very fresh and melted right in my mouth.
The overall pricing of the place is quite pocket friendly too. 
A must try if you ever drop in Forum mall and your craving for something sweet.

Tried their brownie sizzler.
Tastes delicious.
Delivery is a bit slow & the place is a little expensive.
However this little bakery calls for another visit.

Have you felt the silk err....Mousse lately!!

Yes, this is what you say when you try anything different, silky, yummilicious chocolate dessert from Biscotti... Forum mall has an outlet of Biscotti and what can be more exciting than having something chocolacious treat on your birthday!!! Tried Brownie and Chocolate mousse. And yes, it tasted heavenly... The softness of the silky mousse, the crumbly chocolate on top makes your mouth feel luscious... Wish to explore some more from Biscotti someday.

I had a blueberry cheesecake here and needless to say it tasted awesome. 
I absolutely loved the texture of the berries and the base of the cake was crunchy too.
It had a nice slightly sour flavour that I enjoyed. 

The staff was nice. 
But I think the price is a bit on the higher side. ðŸ™‚

Apart from the food court of Forum Courtyard, Burp this another outlet of Biscotti is dedicatedly larger and has a number of pastries and quick munches on their menu. Their black Forrest slice is amazing and belongs to one of my favourites. The service is quite quick as well.

Biscotti is really a nice place with probides quality stuff! We had ordered a birthday cake fronm here and it was soo delicious and looked just perfect! It was a black forest cake which was soft and chocolaty with a layers of chocolate mousse followed by a layer full of cherries! 
Next our all time favourite from this place is the Chocolate Mud Slice Cake which is again very gooey and chocolaty and suits our taste palette the best .. :)

We went here for a quick snack before our movie as I was very hungry and tried the lebanese wrap and a lemon tart, the lebanese wrap which was vegetarian tasted good and the lemon tart also did not disappoint.It's a good place for snacks and is reasonably priced.It does not have a seating space of it's own so the customers have to sit in the common seating space of the mall.

Location-Forum mall,4th floor,Kolkata.

This is a venerable shop which mainly deals in desserts and snacks.We only visit this shop to have their tarts and biscuit cakes(we can't recall its name).It also has a small seating area of around 7-8 people.It has been around 15 years  since this shop opened and its still the same in both the taste of the dessert and interiors of the shop.This place has 3 outlets in kolkata but this one is most popularly known and recognized.

Service-4/5
Food-4.5/5

This place is a must visit and you must try its biscuit cake.ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ

One of my favourites! This is my go to dessert place in forum mall! I am in loveeeeeeeeee with their 'Death by chocolate'. A MUST TRY for all the chocolate lovers. The taste totally justifies the name as what one experiences after having a spoonful of it is food nirvana. I have tried all their cakes and death by chocolate will remain my favourite forever... recently i tried their black forest cake which was great as well (nothing comparable to my favourite but still a good 1).All their products are so fresh and so tasty I have been trying them right since my childhood and not once was I disappointed with them. Their cakes instantly seem to cheer me up and lighten my mood!
Highly recommended!! :)

I tried the cheesecake today, which was nice, but the sitting was very uncomfortable. The cake was light and airy, with a bit of a lemony taste.  Nice although I would call it a cream cake rather than a cheesecake maybe. There's no proper sitting arrangement so best kept for take away only. Prices are very decent.

Entered this outlet on the fourth floor of forum mall , just out of habit of having something after shopping , quality patisserie and bakeries being my hot favourite stops, tried the chicken cheese quiche and chocolate mousse ; both were really good . On a previous occasion also had their mushroom spinach quiche and blue berry cheesecake and there is no point hiding the fact biscotti maintains a decent standard in both sections of pastries and savouries.
Planning to order a birthday cake soon!!

As the name says biscotti I would expect varieties of biscotti but what i found there was only one variety of almond biscotti and many cakes and savouries item . So I went and ordered almond biscotti and afgato . Biscotti was good and coffee was cold. When asked he said since it has ice cream it cold but on complaining he asked to opt for something else and I had a mocha. Mocha was ok but they were served in glass. So my suggestion is go only to eat don't dare to try there coffee.

Forum launched in early 2000s was the first mall of its kind in the city. It brought along with itself big brand outlets, shopping experiences, multiplexes and a variety of eating options. Biscotti has been in Forum forever delighting lakhs over the years. Take a break from shopping or satisfy your craving after a movie, there's loads of choices. Breads, cakes, biscuits to cooked items like sandwiches and wraps. I have never left the outlet without their quiche - veg has spinach and chicken and mushroom for non veg. From the dessert offering, I could recommend the light mocha biscuit and lemon tart. Some places continue to be where they were and there's a sweet comfort in it.

A visit to Forum Â Mall generally ensures buying some sinful desserts from Biscotti.
Once my colleague ordered a birthday cake from this place and it was bit too sugary. Apart from that single instance, I have never been disappointed by Biscotti!

This small outlet is on the 4th floor at my favorite mall, Forum. To begin with , I strongly appreciate the staff there. Coming to food, I have explored - The blueberry cheesecake, chocolate mousse,black forest, chocolate mud cake, red vanilla cupcake (I believe, that's limited edition, as I hardly see it these days), chocolate biscuits and much more. People having a sweet tooth or who just love chocolates , must visit this place,at least once. The pastries are delectable and the chicken croissant is a must try. :)

My memory with Biscotti goes back to year 2002, when I was in standard IX and visited Forum Mall for a couple of times to watch movies at Inox. That was a scenario when, the nearest Inox was here and the place being far from my residence was a perfect spot to hang out at if one feels like bunking classes. I do not exactly remember the other shops which were there in and around Biscotti, but seeing this shop once again yesterday made me refresh my memories once again.

They used to make fresh sandwiches and was a food heaven for me during a time Subway didn't even enter the market at Kolkata. Their sandwiches were fresh and filling at the same time. The pastries too were rich and full of cream and flavors. This outlet stands exactly the same with the similar glass display box. Ordered for two donuts yesterday for take-away, and once I had them after coming back to my residence, I was simply blown away. Fresh and chocolaty, there were pretty much worth the money. Don't know if they still make those fresh sandwiches, but would love to visit them once again just for the sake of nostalgia. :-)

I tried the blueberry cheesecake and chocolate mudslide. The cheesecake was great( will go back for more) but the mudslide was not. It maybe has more to do with the fact that the staff didn't put it into oven before serving it to us (he was on the phone all the time) hence the thing was very dry and left not a good impression.

This is the bigger standalone outlet of Biscotti in Forum Mall.(not in the food court). Here the variety is much more. They make sandwiches,also have variety of breads to choose from. They keep burgers,tarts,quiches ,puffs etc. They have mouthwatering pastries,chocolate and other flavours. Their cheesecake is also good. They also have big cakes and they take customised orders for birthday and other occasions.  Good outlet.

Biscotti isn't very well spread throughout Kolkata as other confectionary shops , but what they sell is good enough for me to go again and again. Their chocolate mousse and cheesecake in particular are very good. In the savoury section , the chicken quiche , chicken burger and the chicken and corn roll is good.

I frequent Forum Mall a lot and Biscotti located both inside the Burp food court as well as on the 4th floor, is one of my all time favourites. I fell in love with their baked items and amazing array of pastries right from the very first time I tasted them. The Chocolate Mud Cake is to die for. Ask them to serve it hot and ohmygod it would definitely be one of the most amazing mud cakes you'll ever have. The Blueberry Cheesecake is delicious too. Also adore their chocolate tart, black forest pastry, chocolate mousse and brownies. Basically love love love all their pastries. Now coming to the baked items, their spicy chicken roll and chicken quiche are yum. The other baked items are quite palatable too. The prices according to me are decent and completely value for money considering how amazing each single item on their menu is.

I am huge fan of their baked products. They are located both inside the food court of forum mall ( Burp ) as well as on the fourth floor, Forum Mall ( just besides the washrooms! ) yes that's the location. Nevertheless the pastries are yummy and the baked items are really nice. 
Love their chocolate mousse and their chocolate tarts! Also their chocolate stick is really good to taste. Made with fine chocolate it's a chocolate lovers delight to actually eat their products. Also one of their best desserts would undoubtedly be their "Blueberry Cheesecake" it's absolutely yummy and should be on the "must try" items list if you ever cross this little bakery! Couple of times I have tried their quiches and they were good and flavourful too. Staff is a little useless and slow but you don't have to care about them because you just either order a take away or are there inside the shop for a couple of minutes till the time you finish your dessert. All in all a good place and highly recommended!

It is a small place on the 4th floor of forum mall, Elgin road. I have been to this place only a few times as i prefer krazy for chocolates for pastries and donuts ... Though the shops has many delicious sweet and salty items but Blueberry Cheesecake is the best pick (Since, I have been to many places and had all sort of blueberry cheesecakes, so I can judge it :) ) . 
The space inside the shop is limited. They have only a couple of tables to sit inside the shop. The items are very limited in the menu and are limited in stock :(... but the best part of this outlet is the freshness of all the food items. You must try at least one of the items to judge.... The prices are comparatively in sync with krazy for chocolates....

A decent bakery with good stuff nd decent pricing.
Orange tea cake is nice, chix croissant was good,  coffee lovers like me should definately try The Cappaccino Cup.

I am huge fan of their baked products. They are located both inside the food court of forum mall ( Burp ) as well as on the fourth floor, Forum Mall ( just besides the washrooms! ) yes that's the location. Nevertheless the pastries are yummy and the baked items are really nice. 
Love their chocolate mousse and their chocolate tarts! Also their chocolate stick is really good to taste. Made with fine chocolate it's a chocolate lovers delight to actually eat their products. Also one of their best desserts would undoubtedly be their "Blueberry Cheesecake" it's absolutely yummy and should be on the "must try" items list if you ever cross this little bakery! Couple of times I have tried their quiches and they were good and flavourful too. Staff is a little useless and slow but you don't have to care about them because you just either order a take away or are there inside the shop for a couple of minutes till the time you finish your dessert. All in all a good place and highly recommended!

I like this place! Tucked away a corner on the fourth floor of forum! My favorites here are chicken quiche, spinach quiche, hotdog, red-velvet cupcake and chocolate pyramid! The staffs are courteous! Nice place :)

It is a small place on the 4th floor of forum mall, Elgin road. I have been to this place only a few times as i prefer krazy for chocolates for pastries and donuts ... Though the shops has many delicious sweet and salty items but Blueberry Cheesecake is the best pick (Since, I have been to many places and had all sort of blueberry cheesecakes, so I can judge it :) ) . 
The space inside the shop is limited. They have only a couple of tables to sit inside the shop. The items are very limited in the menu and are limited in stock :(... but the best part of this outlet is the freshness of all the food items. You must try at least one of the items to judge.... The prices are comparatively in sync with krazy for chocolates....

Biscotti is a little pastry shop located inside Forum Mall, the shop deals in cakes, pastries, cookies and savories. The shop doesn't really attract that much crowd but is a descent option for cakes and pastries. They have items like Chocolate Mousse, Doughnuts, Pastries, Puddings, Tarts, Pies and other similar stuff. The Chocolate Mousse was very good, doughnut was equally tasty.

Pricing is moderate but it is expected from a premium shop in a famous mall. Service is fast, however stocks are very limited often due to the small size of the shop. The items barely last day long and in the evenings things completely empty. Ambiance of the store is overall average. There is no space to sit and enjoy your meal inside the store however there are a couple of tables outside, separate from the store.

Overall a descent pastry shop and would be good if they are able to maintain their stocks, more people will be attracted to the store.

Biscotti located in the Forum food court and also in the floor below is quite highly rated.I have tried it on quite a few occasions and I have had mixed experiences.
Overall,the cakes and pastries are better than the sandwiches and burgers.The pastries have never really let me down.The chocolate ones especially.While the cheesecake didnt impress me much,once I had got a black forest birthday cake from here for a friend's birthday and it was brilliant.The chocolate mousse and the honey almond bar are quite good too.The tarts are also good,specially the shell.But the flavors could have been better.
Among the others,the lebanese wrap and the sandwiches are quite tasty.I did not like the burger that much.The bun did not seem up to the mark.It felt as if it was part of old stock.But I guess it was a one off because I had it some other time and it was better then but nothing out of the ordinary still.
The prices are on the high moderate side,as you would expect from a place like this.
In short,the items on offer are extremely tempting to look at but taste wise I did not find them that irresistible.

Biscotti â€“ Much expected from it. Didnâ€™t Live up to that level though
===========================================================
Brief: 

Biscotti is located inside the Forum Mall in the burp section. It is located on the exact right side when you enter the burp section. I had visited it with one of my friend when I had been waiting for the reservation of CafÃ© Mezzuna. 

===========================================================
Pastry ordered: 

I ordered one black forest pastry. It was not very great. It had to be totally soft which it lacked. However, it was not too bad too. It was a little better than the moderate and little less than the excellent pastry. I really enjoyed it though. But, it could have been much better. 
===========================================================

Pastry price for two â€“ 235 bucks (max)

===========================================================

Conclusion:

Overall, one can rely on it in order to have some sweet dish. â˜º â˜º Pic taken from iPhone. :)

Recently had Chicken Corn Puff and Chocolate Bar. Chocolate bar was tasty but seemed over price to me. Chicken corn puff was not as tasty as expected. It has loads of scope of improvement

I have been a regular at the Biscotti at metro cash and carry . and also like their fare quite a lot . Usually a quick bite at forum means biscotti only . 

I like this savories much more than their sweets. The do a good job with their chocolate desserts but the non chocolate ones are average. The Horror that i saw today was the red velvet . I don't understand why every single cake shop wants to have something called red velvet. Also a red velvet is not a cup cake with red frosting . 

People you are good at many things expand your repertoire in a direction that does not hamper you. 

amongst the things I like : 

chocolate tart, the ganache is always so perfectly piped ... and the tart shell is brilliant too . The lemon curd is a tad bit too sweet for me . I like it a little more sour .

The brownies are really nice, as is the chocolate mousse. I have loved their chicken corn puff and the crunchy veg puff . Even make decent sandwiches if you are wanting something to grab and go. 

Had the Lebanese wrap the other day  and it was delicious . Huge portions and very very tasty .  made fresh in front of me . 

The star however for me is the honey almond bar ... I just love the chewy texture of it . totally brings out the child in me. The make good cookies just a point .. an almond biscotti cannot be round ! You are named after a biscotti ... please don't call an almond cookie a biscotti ! 

Just a few lows otherwise I would give them a 4.5

Biscotti at one time was a must visit every time I went to Forum and I would always stop by and grab a bite ..... the Chicken Quiche , Almond Biscotti and Honey Almond Bar were all just plain delicious. Unfortunately the quality and flavor have taken a downward plunge in recent times. The cookies are not as good , the only thing I liked was the Chocolate Tart and my friend had the lemon tart but that was just Ok while the other friend who ordered a Chocolate Mousse again said it was not bad but not great either. The Chicken Quiche was not on display and while chatting with my friends I forgot to ask if its discontinued or just not available that day because I was eager to try my old favorite. All in all I do hope the management takes note and is able to rediscover their old touch !

I have recently come to discover many good places to grab a quick bite at Forum mall. Biscotti is one of them....because to me, no meal, no matter how small....seems to be complete without desserts ! Everything on the display glass counter looks super tempting....but till now, I've only managed to sample a few. The Chocolate Mousse was simple and nice....topped off with plenty of shaved chocolate, it was everything chocolaty ! The Lemon Tart was good....but not great. The crust was well made but the filling itself didn't appeal much to me. The best of the lot was the Nutty Surprise....it basically has a pudding like consistency, filled with various nuts that provides a welcome change in texture from the gooey chocolate. It is extremely rich so make sure you love (or like, atleast) chocolate when you order this one ! 3.5 stars for now. :)

It's a little bakery conveniently located in the Burp Food Court at Forum. Discovered it very recently and didn't have much from this outlet. We had the Chocolate Mousse, Double Choco Chip Mousse cake and the Lemon Tart.

The chocolate mousse was too sweet to derive any pleasant taste. Same goes with the Lemon Tart, it was excessively lemony. However, the crust was absolutely perfect, and blended in perfectly to the pleasure of my palate. Next is the Double Choco Chip with Mousse cake. It had a beautiful combination of the chocolate and the cake, the sweetness was just perfect. Just melts in your mouth and is really yummy!.  

Overall, not a bad place place to try out.

At Biscotti, I have grabbed an occasional bite or two, an apple pie now and a lemon tart then. Or the one time when I did not have time enough for a lunch before the movie, the chicken quiche. It is actually hard to resist the mouth watering victuals on display.

Here is the deal - its pretty difficult to miss Biscotti if you are on the same floor and are waiting for your friend to grab tickets while you have nothing better to do. So you move sneakily, enter, and buy a chocolate eclair. And well, you really dont want to disappoint your friend, do you? So a cheesecake is added to the game. Then you precariously balance the two things and walk back to your friend and proceed to eat them because its the right thing to do while waiting in a line.

And they are pretty good, too!

I used to like Biscotti for their blueberry cheese cake, elcairs, the honey almond bar, the chocolate sticks and the croissants. The burgers and sandwiches on display do not appeal to me that much hence I have never even given a thought of trying them out. Also I like the lemon tarts and chocolate tarts. The blueberry cheesecake was so good at one point of time that my brother (who loves cheesecakes) used to have at least two one after the other whenever he could and as often as he could. The last time he had it a few months back and instead of heaping the usual praise he could not stop cribbing about the decline in taste, quantity and quality. I decided to sample on myself and sure enough I could not help but agree with him. To the fullest. The other things that I liked are still more or less the same. Thankfully.

I guess this is the 1st outlet of Biscotti in the city. Finally got a chance to try it last Saturday since I had some work in Forum and was hungry as well. I had heard that the confectionery boasts of very high quality burgers, sandwiches and other pastries. I tried a Chicken Burger priced at Rs84. The burger seemed pretty big in size but falls flat when it comes to taste. The entire burger had a very stale feeling. The bun was not soft, the patty was very dry and did not pack a punch. The mayonnaise and the tomato was the only thing that tasted a bit juicy. The Chicken Quiche looked pretty tasty from outside but I did not take a chance.  
Having tried only one item, I cannot rate it over 2.5 since I was disappointed. I doubt if I would be back.

Biscotti has its outlets in forum, sarat bose road and offers cakes, pastries and some snack items. All the savouries  are priced between 55 to 75 range but i must mention that the size of cakes are pretty big. The sandwiches are priced from 75 to 100. I have had a few experiences wherein they sold a day old stuff perhaps which was a shocker.

The cakes and pastries i would say are very  very good. I feel their cakes are well balanced and there is no overkill of flavour or sugar or a cream. so ultimately there is a bit of natural flavour in the cakes and optimum sweetness. The blueberry cheesecake is their best offering at Rs.74 and its heavenly.The mud cake is just awesome whether you freeze or warm before having. The pineapple slice is good. The snacks are ok and i like their lebanese wrap the most. 

Ultimately, they offer limited variety but they are all amazing and offer a fresh change from the cakes or a kookie jar or krazy chocolates who all i feel go for an overkill of creme or flavour.

Pros:
1) Great pastries at descent prices
2) Blueberry cheesecake and mudcake are must haves
3) Optimum flavour 

Cons:
1) Snack items are just ok at those prices
2) I feel they sometimes sell their earlier day's stuff

With so many bakeries in town one expects to be spoilt for choice but the truth is only a few give products of a  certain desirable standard. Biscotti has been housed in Forum since a very long time and has a few standard pastry items which have a good standard. Their chocolate tarts with a filling of ganahce is quite tasty. The cheesecakes are creamy and delicious. While the section of pastries has a good standard the savoury items are worth a miss. Their sandwiches are a tad too dry for my taste. While their bread is not bad and cheaper than what is available at other bakeries one of the biggest flaws of the place is that they try and sell off the stale items from the previous day if one visits the shop before 12 p.m. and that is unacceptable.

Biscotti is an average bakery that used to make good cheesecake. Though it is located very conveniently and is far cheaper than the other restaurants/cafes in Forum, the quality of their food is no longer very good. The shop is also very stuffy for some reason.

Since the bakery is primarily a buy-and-carry place, the seating arrangements are very limited. The Spinach and Cheese Quiche and the Blueberry Cheesecake are worth a try, but nothing else stands out.

I have been to this outlet a few times. I dropped in for a quick lunch today, walking away from the  counter at Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf as they were taking too long.

Here are my impressions:

1. Someone suggested I try the burger which I did. At Rs 80 it seemed reasonable value. It was disappointing. It was very dry. Although the store staff claimed it was made a short while back it didn't even taste too fresh. The chicken patty was a tad hard and very dry too. A complete waste.

2. The cold coffee was sad. I asked him to make it strong, and he said he had. For Rs 85 I got the same size shot of coffee I would get with a much smaller portion of hot coffee. End result was there was hardly any taste of coffee. He said he couldn't do anything till I said I wouldn't accept it, whereupon he added in another shot of coffee. It didn't make a real difference and this time the cold coffee was warm! Had to make him add in more ice. Shoddy and disappointing.

3. The Rs 50 charged for the chicken and corn puff was perhaps a tad high, but it was definitely tasty and well made. I enjoyed it.

4. The Rs 45 lemon tart too was pretty well done. Not everyone can make a lemon tart as well as Cookie Jar / Cakes, and they did.

With so many bakeries in town one expects to be spoilt for choice but the truth is only a few give products of a  certain desirable standard. Biscotti has been housed in Forum since a very long time and has a few standard pastry items which have a good standard. Their chocolate tarts with a filling of ganahce is quite tasty. The cheesecakes are creamy and delicious. While the section of pastries has a good standard the savoury items are worth a miss. Their sandwiches are a tad too dry for my taste. While their bread is not bad and cheaper than what is available at other bakeries one of the biggest flaws of the place is that they try and sell off the stale items from the previous day if one visits the shop before 12 p.m. and that is unacceptable.

Biscotti is an average bakery that used to make good cheesecake. Though it is located very conveniently and is far cheaper than the other restaurants/cafes in Forum, the quality of their food is no longer very good. The shop is also very stuffy for some reason.

Since the bakery is primarily a buy-and-carry place, the seating arrangements are very limited. The Spinach and Cheese Quiche and the Blueberry Cheesecake are worth a try, but nothing else stands out.

I have been to this outlet a few times. I dropped in for a quick lunch today, walking away from the  counter at Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf as they were taking too long.

Here are my impressions:

1. Someone suggested I try the burger which I did. At Rs 80 it seemed reasonable value. It was disappointing. It was very dry. Although the store staff claimed it was made a short while back it didn't even taste too fresh. The chicken patty was a tad hard and very dry too. A complete waste.

2. The cold coffee was sad. I asked him to make it strong, and he said he had. For Rs 85 I got the same size shot of coffee I would get with a much smaller portion of hot coffee. End result was there was hardly any taste of coffee. He said he couldn't do anything till I said I wouldn't accept it, whereupon he added in another shot of coffee. It didn't make a real difference and this time the cold coffee was warm! Had to make him add in more ice. Shoddy and disappointing.

3. The Rs 50 charged for the chicken and corn puff was perhaps a tad high, but it was definitely tasty and well made. I enjoyed it.

4. The Rs 45 lemon tart too was pretty well done. Not everyone can make a lemon tart as well as Cookie Jar / Cakes, and they did.

Tried Black Forest pastry and the Walnut Brownie from Biscotti after a movie. The black forest was tasty. The walnut brownie could have been much better although it was served warm. The no. of options were less and I chose from their best selling items.

Overall a good pastry experience. Would try the sandwiches on the next visit. 

3 stars from me for Biscotti.

For those who are picky about their baked desserts and other savouries, Biscotti offers a decent range of items from the humble doughnut to exquisite mousses. You will find most desserts that people with a sweet tooth crave on offer and... however, there could be improvements made in terms of ambience and seating arrangements. The prices are also a bit on the high side.

1. A medium-high priced somewhat 'gourmet' bakery
2. I usually pick up good baked doughnuts and croissants from here
3. Good mousses. Decent cheesecakes.
