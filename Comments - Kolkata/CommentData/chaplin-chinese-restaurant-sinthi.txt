It's a normal small chinese restaurant where the quality and taste of food varies from time to time(except the chilly chicken, mixed chow mein and chopsey). There is no need to expect any remarkable ambience. But, one thing worth mentioning is the old lady who is the owner of this place....she is too good and courteous. It's because of her good behavior, we like visiting this place for quick snack.

I have been visiting this place since my childhood with my aunt and mama.

Today we have ordered Chicken Thai Soup and Fish Ori and salad. This time also they didn't failed to disappoint me . The soup was adding great flavours of non-veg , hint of spice and veggies . You must try this when you visit again . Next we have ordered Fish Ori that was perfectly cooked and very nice soft to eat . Nice place to be , it's reminding me of China Town at Tangra when I visit here . The staffs are very humble and polite , service is good .

I have visited this place once. Small place. Ambience is nothing to write about. Ordered egg Hakka chowmein and chilly fish. Chowmein was okay. Chilly fish was terrible. Staffs are not friendly. They do not accept cards which cause inconvenience to me.

Another restaurant, after Pleasure, that is associated to my childhood mamabari memories is Chaplin. I don't quite remember when I had last been here but it surely was on one of the eating ventures with my cousins. Chinese is good.

Don't know if it can be called a restaurant, it's an a.c dhaba, though dhabas serve better food than this place. There's only 4-5 tables. Food is cheap but garbage, take almost 30 minutes to serve food even when there's only 1/2 occupied tables. The owner is so rude, they don't even look at you while giving the bill/change.

Disappointed by this restaurant. This place is very old and is located at the busy place of Sinthee more . Had heard from my Dad that it is a good restaurant serving good Chinese since his college days, however they seem to have degraded a lot. The egg hakka chowmein and the garlic schezwan noodles were fine but nothing great. The biggest disappointment was the manchurian. They just dropped in the vegetable pakoras in manchurian sauce. They should revamp their quality of food .

Today went there with a friend. A small place. Parking sparse. Ordinary decoration with cramped space.
Soon after we sat down, a middle- aged lady came and sat at the cash counter and facing me, began picking her ear. Ugh!!! Would have left the place immediately but my friend assured me of good quality of food. So sat down once again , gritting my teeth.
An old man took our orders. Mutton sweet corn soup, fish green chilly as starters and veg Hakka chow mein and schezuan chicken as main course.
My friend specifically ordered that the soup and the fish would come together but it did not. Soup came first, fish dish arrived later after much prodding.
Tissue paper not given voluntarily. Given on asking.(sigh!)
The soup was delicious and the fish came in a green gravy but the gravy was also delicious. 
Then came veg chow mein, enough for two of us. But the only waiter of the restaurant forgot that we have ordered Chicken schezuan. My friend shouted. It came at last in a thick gravy. Taste nothing like chicken schezuan that I have tasted till date. 
The lady began talking to my friend. It appeared that she is the owner of this restaurant. She began telling us of her struggles and her family life, so much so that we did not have time to talk to each other.
Price pocket friendly but service slow and too much informality. Food is ok. Don't think would venture there again.

Chaplin has been serving Chinese food in our neighbourhood for a long time. There's not much ambience to speak of with cramped sitting & stuffy interiors and the staff can be downright rude but the food is alright; atleast we haven't found it to be totally untouchable. Although the issue of de-veining prawns & shrimps is neglected as usual (and this is a serious health problem in majority of the eateries in the city). I'm extremely curious about their 'Drygan' items though I didn't dare order them.

Was there yesterday for lunch in search of some decent Chinese restaurant round Sinthi More. 
The place is spacious with I guess 5 to 6 tables, less decorations but decent and as it was too humid outside, an AC in their was enough for me for the perfect ambiance :D
I ordered one Veg Chow and one Hot & Sour Chicken. 
First they served me Veg Fried rice instead of Chow, which I asked him to replace and the waiter did that as asked but the owner created a small scene at that moment shouting to the staff in front of all the customers while they were having their meal and said she will recover the loss from their salary. I guess that was not proper to shout at staff in front of all the customers and they should check it. 
Gladly, had a peaceful meal after that. But there was nothing special about the meal except the quantity is decent and items are reasonably priced.

here i have tried their mixed fried rice,chicken hakka chow,chilli chicken,garlic chicken,manchurian chicken..i mostly like their noodles which is a good one..and they have a wide range of side dishes..

the ambience is homely one and the servers are good but sometimes they take a lot of time which is a con..yet getting good chinese in the locality is a nice thing..!

INTERESTING LOCAL CHINESE FARE @ CHAPLIN CHINESE RESTAURANT!
3.5 out of 5

The food of this very ordinary and plain looking restaurant will definitely impress you.  The aptly named Chaplin Chinese Restaurant is located near the Sinthee More area. This small sized restaurant manages to serve lip smacking and delish Chinese fare at affordable prices. The prompt and efficient food service is definitely commendable and deserves the appreciation of one and all. 

Instead of the usual fried rice and Hakka or gravy Chowmein staples, they serve and specialize in a variety of American and Chinese chopsuey preparations. Some of them are mixed American chopsuey, chicken prawn Chinese chopsuey and their innovative (and one of a kind!) mutton Chinese or American chopsuey. These chopsuey options are undeniably their house bestsellers.  The noodles are delightfully crispy, and are served with a generous amount of vegetables and tangy chopsuey sauce.  The quantity of their chopsuey is huge and ample. One person might find it difficult to finish a single plate of chopsuey.

They also have a separate section for their Manchurian dishes, dishes cooked in Hong Kong style and dragon dishes. Likewise, as part of their vegetarian side dishes, they serve some mouthwatering mushroom, paneer and potato items. They even offer a good number of mutton dishes like chilli mutton, hot garlic mutton and sweet and sour mutton. Whether it is chicken, fish, prawn or mutton, the pieces are juicy and succulent.  Even non veg snack options like spring rolls (of chicken, prawn or fish), pakoras (of  prawn, chicken or fish),  and spring chicken are not only crispy but luscious and soft as well. Like their chopsuey, even their snack options are sought after.

They also offer very limited north Indian delicacies for mutton and chicken options like chicken Rezala, mutton chaap, chicken bharta and so on, but this is not the place for mughlai food - just enjoy the Chinese here.
