Quite a nice joint. Nearby Masjid in esplanade. Small cozy place. Ordered chicken biriyani, mutton Masala, green salad and firni. The quantity and quality of biriyani is okay. The mutton needed to be cooked slightly more. The firni is awesome. Great place for lunch mainly when you are broke. Quick services and pocket friendly.

It's a hidden gem. The biriyani was average, the mutton pasinda was amazing, especially with tandoori roti, also had malai kabab which was not so good and finally the faluda was amazing.

Aalamir,situated just behind the Tipu Sultan Mosque,Esplanade is somewhat more like a secret place for the foodies to discover.As they say don't judge a book by its cover,this restaurant in a way justifies the proverb.It might has a shabby and nonglamourous decor,but the food is excellent over here.And what makes it more admirable is the cost.It is so very much pocket friendly with absolute good quality.I tried a tandoori thali as this was my first visit.The thali had one big chicken tandoori,4 small pieces of chicken tikka and 2 baby naan rootis.It was a dry combination though.But tasted so well and priced only â‚¹ 90.It's a must recommended for the people who will be visiting esplanade and haven't yet tasted food over here.

Good quality food at a very cheap price. We ordered dry chilly chicken, chicken tandoori thali, mutton pashinda, butter naan. And in desserts we ordered faluda and firni. Every item were pretty good, especially the kababs. I definitely recommend this restaurant.

I went to this place recently after shopping this place is not very easy to locate...you have to ask local people for assistance other than Google maps...one can go straight to Tipu sultan mosque and it's quite close to that. It has two floors ground floor in non ac 1st floor is ac...they don't charge gst but the ac portion will cost ten to twenty rupees extra.
# Seating arrangements are ok...this place is  usually too much crowded so most of times people have to share their table...one can imagine not a very cozy ambience at all but it's clean well organised and hygienic.
# Now come to food, food is heart of this place...they serve finger licking good chicken which costs you very less.
I along with my friend ordered Biriyani and Tandoori Roti combo...biriyani was good....but if u compare it with it's price then it's a hidden gem...and tandoori roti combo consisted 1 butter tandoori roti,one chicken tandoori and two pieces of chicken tikka with salad and green sauce I was eating this combo and this was one of the amazing things I've tasted in recent times...chicken tandoori was perfectly cooked with perfect portion of spices and chicken tikka also was delicious.
# after tasting all these good food pocket pinch was very less... Our total bill was 180 rs. When you go to esplanade and feel hungry after a heavy shopping this place is a must visit.

It's located behind the Tipu Sultan Masjid in Dharamtalla. The entry is through a narrow gully behind the mosque from Lenin Sarani side. I was unaware of this place until my friend took me here one day. The menu is a simple and square cut one with a variety of North Indian and Mughlai dishes to choose from. Needless to mention that it's pocket friendly and hygienic. We had biryanis and Mutton Masala,both tasted satisfactory considering the value for money factor. The biryani was the usual one, not to expect the best but appreciable to some extent. Mutton Masala had tender and juicy pieces of meat in a spicy gravy which was pretty good and tasty. I will go back and surely try out some more dishes before being the best judge. Recommended,when broke.

This eatery is located near Tipu Sultan Mosque, Esplanade.

Shabby ambience and minimal decor .

Service is prompt.

Tried Tandoori chicken, tandoori roti & Chicken Bharta. All were very tasty. Bharta was lip smacking . Tandoori chicken was juicy and savoury.

Quantity is ample too.

Pocket pinch is very reasonable.

This place should truly be called a hidden gem. Aalamir would be your perfect place if you are looking for north indian delicacies at dirt cheap prices. Located behind tipu sultan mosque in a lane. The mesmerising smell of the tandoor would attract you automatically.

This place has 2 floors of dining area with the upper being a family section. The place is always crowded due to the availability of their affordable thali system.

We had the following:-

1. Chicken tandoori combo - A popular & famous platter of this place. This contains 2 medium sized tawa roti, 2 tikka kebabs & 1 medium sized tandoori pieces. The flavours made me go 'WOW'. The kebabs & tandoori were fingerlicious tasty due to their masala marination, spicy & was just perfect to eat. The pudina chutney provided with the platter deserves a special mention. However my only complain would be regarding the tandoori since it was a bit undone & could have been cooked more.

2. Chicken bharta - The classic companion for your rotis. The dish was not rich with spices nor it was too oily. It had bags of flavours with the shredded chickeb & a half boiled egg. This was very tasty.

Prices are extremely on the lower side since it cost about 150 per head for both the above items. The service was good. I was extremely satisfied with the experience. Recommended place for whoever is looking for an economical lunch/dinner.

The chicken was soft and the quality of the food was unexpected with the pocket friendly price. 
I enjoyed the food. 
Biriyani lovers needn't drop in Arsalan or Aminia as in terms of pocket friendliness. 
One may just drop in Aalamir or enjoy biriyani at home ambience. :'")

Located near Lenin Sarani. Absolutely value for money. The Kebabs they make are mesmerizing. The Biryani they serve is heavenly. The tandoor combo at such a less amount is the main attraction over here. Quality is top knotch, I must say. The service is good too. They have two floors. The joint is neat too. The decor is okayish. The upper floor is small yet cosy for dining. Any item on their menu is tasty af. Any chicken item along with baby nun turns out to be a great combination. They also serve chinese. But I prefer not to go for them as the chinese items on their menu has a blend of North Indian taste in them. Nevertheless, go for any North Indian dish. Be it Chicken Tandoori/ Biryani/ Kebab or anything, you won't be disappointed for sure. Definitely a joint worth trying for. Good food. Great quantity. Less price.

If you're on the lookout for a restaurant that serves tasty North Indian food but isn't heavy on your pockets,  this is the place for you. 
As a college student, I normally visit this place towards the end of the month when I run out of pocket money. 
Situated just next to The Tipu Sultan Mosque in Esplanade, this place is easily accessible. 
Coming to the food: 
1. Chicken Biryani is very tasty and it almost tastes like home cooked biryani. 
2. Almost everything listed in the Menu under "Chicken -E- Firdous" is delicious. But but but, there has to be an exception here.  And that is Chicken Kashmiri which doesn't live up to the mark. 
3. The Roasted Chicken, Tandoori Chicken and Chicken Tikka are tasty. My personal favourite is the green chatni that they serve alongside these dishes. 
4. Tandoori roti and Naan both are incredible. 
5. Lastly, the sweet dish Faluda is heavenly. 

Foot Note : They also serve Tandoori Combo Thali  but I felt that it was a really bad combo because all the dry things were paired together.

A great Esplanade style place to grab delicious food and nominal rates. Lenin Sarani holds some real gem of food stalls and this one is in that list. Don't care much about the ambience cause you won't need to once you taste the food. Good old days reminds me of my time in the area... A must visit spot for every foodie..

Pros :
- Food quality is good
- Price is cheap and within reach
- Service is good
- An array of North Indian dishes and rotis to choose from
- A must visit for a quick bite or when low on budget
- Ambience is acceptable
- Hygienic

Cons :
- Non-AC
- Tables are not cleaned properly, after having eaten at one
- Place is small and may tend to get crowded
- Quantity of food per item is a bit low, compared to the price

Conclusion :
If you are tight on your budget and can overlook some flaws, this is the place to visit. This one's a win-win place

Note :
Meal per head would cost about Rs. 100-120 at max

This place may lack the fancy ambiance but the food is excellent beyond any doubt. Must try the Chenghizi chicken and firni..

A great Esplanade style place to grab delicious food and nominal rates. Lenin Sarani holds some real gem of food stalls and this one is in that list. Don't care much about the ambience cause you won't need to once you taste the food. Good old days reminds me of my time in the area... A must visit spot for every foodie..

- Ambience is acceptable
- Hygienic

Cons :
- Non-AC
- Tables are not cleaned properly, after having eaten at one

Firdous is our office favourite for Biriyani Parties....Located in the busy esplanade area.... Biriyani is too good. I generally prefer Chicken Biriyani !!
I suggest you get the food parcelled coz many may not like the ambience..its typically old kinda ones. N there lies a perfect sync between the price and the taste... Priced well and tastes too well... :)
