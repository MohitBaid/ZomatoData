Heard alot about this place in burrabazar, so finally went there with lots of excitement to taste authentic indian food. BUT was dissappointedðŸ˜”, though people say u get home like food here But honestly home food is also not that simple the simplicity they serve.ðŸ˜‘ Food was lacking little taste of everything(salt,masala,oil etc), So i didnt like it much may be when i am sick that time will love it..ðŸ˜‰

Food is just fantastic. 

Thumbs-up : food is awesome the quality of the food was very high and light on both tummy and pocket. 

Thumbs down - the place is located in a very dingy area.  U have to walk for 5 - 7 mins in that narrow lane to reach the restaurant. 

The kind of crowd it serves to ( mostly small business men and business travelers) ,  I must say its a very good place. 

Cost for 2  - 250-300

Visited today for lunch. Food is good as always. There is a little price difference in online menu and hotel menu. May be online menu is little  older. Good for lunch n dinner in burrabazar area. Missi roti is always special.

Worse place to visit.. In North Kolkata behaviour of hotel staff & counter personal is very rude and food is even worse.. Afternoon lunch time I and my friend visited at thakur mahal....both were very hungry.... But the behaviour of counter personal was so ridiculous that we had to return empty stomach......

The food of Thakurmahal is great.Began ka bharta,Malai kofta,kheer,tondoori roti,papad is awesome. Service staff's behaviour is good, cleanliness is ok. Their roti is made from a grade atta . Papad of TMahal is so crunchy & yummy.                          All ok , but nowadays they use  simple tap water.                 They have no water purifying machine.They have to think about it, thanks.

This is a time tasted one of the my favourite restaurant for great North Indian food. Here you get always great food with great taste. I have been visiting this restaurant since many many years and this restaurant has never disappointed me. 

My recent visit for this restaurant was for dinner and I had ordered Paneer Butter Masala, Mix Veg fry with Tandoori roti and half basmati rice and they serve complimentary daal with rice. All the food was so delicious specially paneer butter masala was mind blowing,  I strong recommend it's Paneer Butter Masala,  Tandoori rotis,  Mix sabzi. 

One thing you should never miss while you are enjoying its food that is Kesariya Kheer, which was so  delicious and beyond description. 

It is so famous for its food so some time you may have to wait for your turn,  service is good and fast. Ambiance is basic & simple.

When I was growing up as a child, this place was one of the most buzzing places. Madwadi familes like mine use to dine here regularly. So I decided to take a parcel after so long years.

Look and ambiance haven't change over the years(upto what I can recall). Pricing is pretty cheap. I like their deliver system sorting. When you place your order with the cashier, your order goes in the kitchen and you are alloted a token number. Your order packed reaches the delivery rack and it is disbursed accepting the token.

Ordered vegetable fry and dal makhni, on opening the container my hands were full of oil. Dal makhni was blunt in taste, no butter, no spices, extra salty. Veg fry was okiesh but nothing matching to the high perceptions of earlier days. I can now see that with increasing prices, it has maintained its price but lowered its quality.

An old time favorite, they have great curries and parathas. The menu is limited and not really innovative, but they get the basics right. The seating is not really great so I would go for take out.

Wow. Still a master class place. They are very famous for the take sways but food is awesome. U have to have a Rajasthani taste to love the food over here. Paneer kulcha, missi roti, raita all are very good and service is pretty good. A traditional type seating arrangement in the interiors of Burrabazar but full marks for the quality and taste.

This is a small restaurant in Burra Bazaar situated near Mechua fruit market. Authentic veg food in Marwari style. And the food is awesome. I specially liked their Missi Roti and their Dal fry. In fact the other items which I had was also good. Even though I am strictly a non-veg person I relished their preparatpn. Would like to visit again.

I have not been to the restaurant but a friend got it delivered through Hungerz and man was it not worth it! Being overdone with Don Giovannis and Jai hind this was an appetizing change. The Kaali daal, paneer, alu do pyaja, chana along with the peas paratha and normal paratha were very tasty and addictive. Definitely a great order option for tasty Dhaba style Indian food at home for dinner with friends or family.

Firstly the food:
I had visited the place expecting to eat a marwari thali, however to my disappointment, Thalis are available only for parcel. So I ordered Paneer butter masala & Tandoori Roti. Tandoori Roti was very small in size, about 5cm in diameter & didn't justify the price. Paneer dish had ample of paneer but gravy was too thin without any spices, it was like paneer cubes in yellow salty syrup. Later i ordered a Mixed paratha, it had some vegetables, and was dripping with ghee, the taste was Ok. I had to leave the place without fulfiling my appetite. above it the staff is not very cordial & they employ child labour for serving food & water which is simply disgusting.
Â Â Overall not worth the pain searching for this restaurant in the narrow alleys of Bara bazar. Utterly disappointing.

It was an office party!! Heard about this place from a collegue and considering we have to make it a veggie affair we decided to try it out.
Food ordered- plain paratha, mixed paratha, raita, khir, mixed pulao, dal makhni, papad, chana paneer,mixed vegetables, malai kofta. Pheww :P its almost the whole menu.
We had huge xpectations from this place , but was dissapointed and i am not telling from just my point of view .
Food was less in quantity, parathas were half burnt and hard to chew, mixed pulao tasted like fried rice. The khir was the only thing we enjoyed.

Some of my nearby outstation relatives who visit burrabazar regularly for work purpose, took me here on one of the shopping days Â in Burra Bazaar. Tired, still regular people here walk so much to reach this place and then wait for a table space to have lunch here.

Ambience - Average canteen Type seating space. Go there just for food.

Food- Blessing for people who are away from home for work, need a home type food without much spices at reasonable prices.

Service- Have to wait for sometime as they have to cater to a lot of people.

Hygenic- AverageÂ 

Pricing - Resonable

If you are Hungry in Burra Bazaar and need less spicy food, head to this place. Little Difficult to Locate.

Now what do I say about this place. I don't know how many times I have been here. For a marwari working in the sweaty burrabazar, yearning for some good cooked food, and wanting to take a break from routined home cooked food, this place is the place to be at. Anything ABD everything they cook, from palak paneer, to  pyazi mesi roti to biryani to the daal. It is extremely economical and the taste is as good as your home cooked food. Next time you are in burrabazar and want to have a hearty lunch, do not miss this one.

4 stars only for its food & specially for its 'kesariya kheer'. I have not tasted a better kheer yet after I first ate here around 10years back. The lane leading to this place is very narrow & dirty but it's worth going just coz of the food. On a visit to this restaurant you get quality food at the cost of ambiance.

Thakur Mahal is for people who want good quality, delicious food at the price of ambiance and hygiene. Yes the place looks dirty& unkempt; yes, the table chairs are old and scarred and yes, you may have this uncontrollable urge to wipe the plate with a paper napkin once.. but It is all worth it.. The food is awesome.
Mostly North Indian fare, some dishes on the menu taste like home cooked food and make me not miss my ma and her food, a little less. Limited menu, which according to me a plus because they know how to make whats there on their menu. 
Must try Khichdi, which is exclusively served on Saturdays. Another thing to try is Aloo Parantha, No one makes it like like the parantha walas in Delhi and Thakur mahal in Kolkata,

At the price, at which, the food is served.. This place and the food served here is a complete winner.

if ambience doesn't make the difference, no one can beat this restaurant. The amazing quality of food and the pricing is the manifesto. The Print has and, the chana masala makes it fabulous!. It has a very short menu with less than 30 items in total, but it performs well with multiple staffs and managers to see that no guests remain unattended. Lacks AC and availability of Mineral Water. Lacks the basic means of hygiene satisfaction visually but not in terms of food quality. Noisy but always busy. To me the food is satisfaction but i prefer it packed and but if you wanna have the real best taste have it in there.
