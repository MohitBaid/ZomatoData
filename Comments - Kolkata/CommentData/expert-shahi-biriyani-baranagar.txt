** Location = B.T. RoadBonhoogly More.

** Brief = I have taken biriyani several times from here, but always had it at home as they dont have proper seating.

** Ambiance = You cannot expect any ambiance from these newly opened biriyani stall which have been like muhsrooms all around Kolkata and its suburbs.

** Things tried = Chicken Biriyani with extra chicken.
Not world class but sometimes when you are low on your budget you can try them.
Ask them for better pieces of chicken and aloo strictly.

** Purse Check = Rs.70/- per plate of chicken biriyani and extra chicken is Rs.30/-, so Rs.200/- would be enough for 2 people.
