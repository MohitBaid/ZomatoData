This is a roadside stall, but they have covered an area of the footpath in front of the stall and there are proper tables and chair to seat. Good variety in menu and the prices are really pocket friendly. 

We love the Gravy Noodles here. Huge amount and the classic salt and pepper flavoured gravy.

The kebabs here are good too.

Nice place to hang around with friends and have good food at pocket friendly rates.

VERY GOOD QUALITY FOOD IN THE PRICE RANGE, IT IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE FAST FOOD CENTERS IN MY LOCALITY & THEY BEHAVE ALSO VERY GOOD WITH THERE CUSTOMERS WHICH IS ONE OF THE ANOTHER MAIN REASON TO CHOSE THIS FAST FOOD CENTER.. THEY OFFER THE BEST QUALITY FOOD IN THE CHEAPEST PRICE. FROM MY SIDE IT IS A THUMSUP.. :)

Lord is another small roadside restaurant located in the lane of Goabagan near Hatibagan. Unlike other roadside restaurants this one looks little modern but is very simple. There's also sittings for few people made out of metal that feels like dhaba.

They serve Indian, Tandoor & Chinese. They make the food in front of you & they serve it fast. I shatteled for the following...

Chicken Hakka Chowmein : Hakka Chowmein was thick, mixed well with vegetables, small chicken & egg pieces. It wasn't very oily neither very spicy. Taste wise it felt quite average.

Chilli Chicken : Chilli Chicken was very rich & spicy. Its dark red thick gravy tasted hot. But chicken pieces were big, solid & well cooked. Overall it didn't tasted that good. Also it made the chowmein tasted bad.

I found this restaurant empty most of the time. Probably because food quality is moderate over here. You can fill your tummy over here but satisfaction to your taste bugs isn't guaranteed.

Nice pocket friendly food joint. Visited several times, never disappointed. Quality and quality both are pretty good. Poor dining arrangement. 
Personally from here I prefer the noodles.

What can I say about this legendary place? This place does not need a review. I have been to here on a number of occasions and have tried almost everything on their menu.

On my last visit, I tried Chicken Hong Kong.I dint quite like it as it was different from what one gets in other places but then maybe those are not the authentic ways to make. Otherwise, everything else from Chicken Paturi to tandoori it was just awesome.The food is just delicious..

This has recently opened in the bylanes of Goabagan area in North Kolkata. Had been seeing this on my way to work everyday Nd decides to try it out. The place is a small set up with a decent and organised kitchen. To start with i took the chilly chicken nd chicken fried rice and to my delight i found it really good. My only suggestion would be to continue the quality nd taste in the times to come. Reasonably priced so thumbs up to that too . Will try other dishes soon.
