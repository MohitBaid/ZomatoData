Chaska, Elgin. Its just beneath EDM (every doors mystery). To be honest i didn't like this place. It could have had been better. Though people who smoke, its cheap for them but the place is something which even matters to person. In general i dont think anyone is going to like it. Service is good. Smoke or the sisha is not that good. For price you're paying for sisha, its worth. A okayish place to visit once.

I visited this place with my friends on a weekend and the place was practically empty. We were a group of 7 and yet found a table easily. As for the service, the food was below average. The pizza was tasteless, white sauce pasta was bland and we needed extra salt for it. Chilli babycorn was decent enough. In short I wouldn't recommend the food here. The shisha was good enough, considering the price.The music and ambience were nothing special. The worst part is the waiters will be standing right next to your table as if signalling you to leave the table as soon as the bill is paid, which is not something you want when you are looking to hangout with your friends. I'm quite sure I won't be visiting this joint again nor would I recommend it, as there are many places better than this one, for the same budget.

This is another hookah lounge tucked in the lane opposite to forum mall..the ambience is just like any other hookah parlour..we had planned to organise the birthday party of one of our friends..so we had the vip section booked to accommodate us..firstly the air conditioner doesn't work..its just for show may be..we had to keep the door open so that we could get some cool air from the a.c. in the hall..they keep on playing bollywood numbers.we had ordered  hookahs ,cold coffee,crispy chilly baby corn and mixed sauce pasta...nothing was extraordinary..the quantity of the baby corn and the pasta was too less compared to the prices they charged..the cold coffee was nothing out of the blue..service is too laid back. so I cannot say we had a great time..and yeah they don't accept cards..I'm definitely not coming back here.

So one of my frnd had her bday party there at its veryy lil sweet private place!!
The whole place just felt like ours, the staffs made us feel soo comfrtble!
Hookah was too good.
We had a four cheese pizza whch dint taste tht great bcz the crust wasnt so good!
The chickn n fried rice was still bttr!
They decorated the place fr the bday party really well
Hence, the food may nt b that great but they made us feel really good!
Thank you chaskaa cafe.. hope to celebrate more parties there!

Been here with some of my friends to try their hookah. It was situated in Allenby road near Forum Mall. Ambience was really good and so as hospitality. Friendly staff and prompt service. price was pocket friendly. We tried their brain freezer hookah, it was brain freezing and Perfectly made smoke's delicious. We had a wonderful experience here. Now it was our regular point. Personal favorite. Must try place. Highly recommended to all.

The staff that seemed friendly at first turned out to be sloppy for he didn't even know we weren't served for half an hour when he had been standing right beside us as we were sitting near the entrance to the main hall. Ambience is just average though it doesn't matter much if you have a group to hang out with. Food isn't their main attraction.

Once renowned as one of the top runners in the locality for hookahs and hangouts,this place has now lost its status. The place is gritty and uncool. The ambience is dark and tacky. The place once used to be my fav hookah place but now when i went there few weeks ago, it was a disaster. The service is quite slow and the staffs are friendly. Its more like an adda now for locales and students of the locality but man this place needs to revive its stature.

Chaskaa has lost its glory from past time.As we went inside we were quite shocked by the ambiance of this place,It was all dark around and the inside section was totally messed up.The couches were damaged and the potraits around were half down.The service was also quit slow and overall it was a very pathetic experience.Hope that they would revive up soon.

This place is just off Elgin road. A totally dodgy, creepy hookah joint cum Cafe. A major hit with people from bhavanipur college as its just around the corner. Unless u like to be surrounded by hookah smoke as your oxygen, give this place a miss. There are plenty of cafes to visit in the area. The one time I visited, I kept looking at the door wondering if it was going to be raided by the cops, (it's that dodgy)! Thankfully we ate and left ASAP!

This place has gone to shit the ambience, overall service everything is poor. The food is bad. The triple cheese pesto pizza we ordered was absolute shit there was no pesto and the cheese was bad the dough looked stale. The hookah wasn't good either . The place was completely empty. In the bill they blatantly overcharged for everything and had put 25% cgst and 25% sgst on every item. This place is a waste of money and should close down.

Have been here 3-4 times. It's an average place to be. Not bad. Neither that good.¬†

This kinda place can turn into an adda if you live around Elgin. The food is good enough. Not bad at all. The hookah is good too. The ambience should be worked upon. SHould be more lively. The music here is too loud. Too loud. Plus they play either hindi depressing songs or edm.

Word of Advice - Try making the place more lively and do experiment with the genres of music.

Its located in the same building as EDM... Almost everything is same between EDM and this one when it comes to interiors. The staff here takes a lot of time so if you have lots of time and wanna relax, you can go here. However I prefer the room inside as it is better than EDM.
But when it comes to the staff some of them are very unruly and I don,t know for some reason they even tend to refuse to give you the wifi passwords.

The cafe is a place that opens as early as 6:30 and closes after 1am. The service is slow, the food here is not that great, we always had some complain or the other but was politely replaced or sometimes even given credit notes to redeem in our further visits.
The music is extra loud to allow a conversation. This place was close to our college and tuitions and go to place to chill in cancelled lectures.

This place is near forum mall, dates long back among the city's hookah joints.
Been here quiet a few times, the comfy couches, dim light and smoky ambience creates a perfect ecstatic ambience, while the music adds on. On weekends and late evening this place sees crowd. Always loved their wai wai bhel, baby corn, and veg noodles. I have tried lots of flavors in hookah here all of them has nice longevity! If you are expecting great food this is not the place, but light snacks, pocket friendly hookahs are the mojos at chaska! üòÉ

I wish zomato had negative rating even that would be less.I bought a deal from little app and it had a hookah,babycorn and 2 moctails. Firstly, the waiter brought hookah of his own choice not even bothered to ask which flavour we want. Babycorn was worst ever in this country I guess and for cocktails too waiter ordered his own choice.On complaining they changed everything but still they took approx 1Hr for another babycorn which was slight better than before but still worst and moctails was worst specially kiwi smoothie didn't tasted like a kiwi at all. It had worst service..its not chaska reloaded its downgraded and cheap cafe with such a worst service.

I have been here previously but now the people working here are deceiving the customers. When asked for a hookah menu and even the combo offers (7am-12noon)they did not provide one instead told us a hookah would cost 500bucks so I enquired about the 300/390 bucks hookah and later they brought a 390 bucks hookah without even asking us about the flavour. We ordered 4 pizzas and it took about an hour to be served, probably the worst service ever. Lastly they did not supply us with a bill when asked instead told us just an arbitrary amount that we had to pay for no reason. Probably because they did some manipulation to their profit which wouldn't have been possible if the bill would have been supplied. I think the authorities should take charge and see that the customers are not deceived in this manner.

The place is awesome.I have been in Kolkata for almost a year n have been to many cafes but chaskaa is really different n above all others.the food is yummy which pulls me towards this cafe...staffs are very friendly,they don't treat us like guests but as a brother.we feel like home whenever we visit chaskaa reloaded.ambience is also gud.the place where we feel free to jump,hop n enjoy ourselves...if anyone is yet to visit chaskaa please go asap.U r miss the flavour of it....thanks to all the staff n managent of chaskaa reloaded...shabbir u r taking this cafe to the next level according to the trend as it changes.thank you so much.

Chilled out place to have a hookah and something to eat. Best of all the seating arrangement let's you relax whilst you puff the magic dragon. Dimly lit as you would expect a hookah cafe to be. Close proximity to Forum. Didn't try the menu. May be I will another day. The music projector plus sound needs careful coordination. What was being projected was not what was being played.

Firstly, 2 years ago this place was completely different. I don't know why they bothered renaming ig to Chaska Reloaded, but honestly that happened for the worse. They ruined the ambience. Loud, and I mean loud music in horribly tampered speakers playing all the time making it impossible to even hear each other at your own table. Food and drinks are over priced, staff behavior inhospitable and borderline rude. It's turned into a cheap dump hookah bar. Something polar opposite of what it was 2 years ago. Don't mind visiting.

Chaskaa has a wonderful ambience.
One of the suitable places for friends to hangout.
The staff was very friendly and our order came quickly. 
Hookah was a bit pricy and not so good.

Located in opp. lane of forum mall,above cream centre.. There are many positive and negative points of this cafe..

 In positive - ambience is good,,space for couple,,small group and a bed lounge for large group too,,food is tasty,,hookah is best in bhaggu area,,hookah prices are reasonable...     

In negative - Food quantity is very less comparatively to other cafes.. service is too much slow,, only one attendant is there to take the order and serve the food...   we have to wait long to ask for water as there was no any attendant to ask 4 order.. they didnt provide us the bill as there printer was out of order..

Me and one of my friend visited this place today
First none of the single staffs to welcome us. the ambience was very noise the music was too loud.
the ac was switched off just after 10 mins
the food we ordered was pan fried noodles and  it was pathetic the vegetables was not properly tossed .
the hookah was good.
the service staffs was not customer friendly.

I have always liked this since it was only Chaska Cafe. Having three different areas for seating arrangements, it includes a small private area which can be called The Green Room as it is lighted up so. If you're in a group of around 15 or so, it's best to chill out at the Green Room with your own personal space. The food out here is pretty good. I liked the Mexican Pizza a lot the first time I visited this place. But after a year or two, when the same was ordered, I found the taste different, not so great. Still, the other items were all really good. So overall I would say, having both a good ambience and food, it's a nice place to chill with friends.

They have miles to go as far as service is concerned.They are visibly understaffed and the incumbent staff need to learn the tricks of the trade when it comes to serving customers.We were made to wait for 10 minutes before being told that the order we placed was not available.And then again we waited for almost 45 minutes before we ourselves cancelled our second order and left.So I cannot share my experience about the food.
Nevertheless,the hookah is good and they let 5 people share one hookah,which is a pleasant surprise after burning big holes in my pocket in Mumbai.And I quite liked the whole set up inside the cafe,right from the interiors to the lights and the comfortable sofas.

It's a horrible place with pathetic service. We asked for a pan flavoured hookah, they gave us something that was fruit flavour. The hookah was so disgusting, it was giving out soot and we almost choked on it. We could not smoke it because we were all coughing. We asked them to change it, but it was still pretty much the same. We asked for pasta in white sauce, they gave us red sauce. The pasta was yuck! I don't know why the served us sweet pasta. The only thing that was worth having was the crispy chilli baby corn. Service was so horrible and everything was late. When we asked them for the bill, their machine miraculously broke. They gave us the wrong bill, which we had to get rectified. The ambience was ok but entertainment was bad. There was a different music being played and a different video being shown.

All in all, a complete waste of money and a good sunday evening.

Perfect place to go to unwind yourself and drown ur tiredness. Located in a nice and quite place where u can really let ur hair down. The ambience is very good and the service is also good enough. The variety of hookah flavours are quite good. And the food and snacks though a little on the higher side price wise it is good enogh. The crowd consists mainly college crowd and the best part is that they are open till the early part of the morning. All in all a place where u can let ur hair down with friends

Awesome place. Ak-47 (hookah) is a must try for everyone. Their mocktails taste better than many pricier places... good food. Service is ok too. Unlike many other hookah cafes they don't cheat their customers by giving out pre-semi-burned coal to make them choke. And reorder earlier. Worth the money.
