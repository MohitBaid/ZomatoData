Ordered pea paratha. The size of the parathas are huge and the are very filling. They Alo provide raita and aloo sabzi with the paratha. It's worth the money.

I order food from this place - online. The price to value is just too good. This restaurant provides food that is healthy & can be consumed daily, at a very very reasonable cost.

Ordered Plain Thali & Suji Uttapam. Took 40 minutes to deliver to a location 1 km away.
Plain Paratha, Suji Uttapam & Raita was good and quantity was good as well.Â 
Although Sabji in Plain ThaliÂ  was a typical street food type.

This was initially named a Benaras Chaat centre and eventually turned into Paratha Point. I am happy they have done this. Tried their Aloo Paratha. It was too big a person with medium or small appetite will not be able to have one full Parantha (exceptions will be there). They tasted good. Gave complementary sabji and raita. Sabji was ordinary but the raita was good.
