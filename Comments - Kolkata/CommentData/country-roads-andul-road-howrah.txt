Had a delightful time with office colleagues.
This was my fourth visit in four yearsand everytime it offered me something different.
This time it was kayaking, rope walk and archery caught my attention.Not to mention the amazing pool.
The staff were all friendly and more than helpful.
The food was extremely delightful and healthy.
The DJ played some good music and we enjoyed our time at the disc.
Thank you DEBASHREE DASGUPTA, the silent worker and the main player behind all these shows.
You have really made our day as you always do.

Me and my wife, both visited Country Roads recently and the memories are lovely. Both the interiors and exteriors are well designed, we enjoyed in the swimming pool together, thanks to the manager and the staffs for their full co-operation. I would like to mention about the food separately, we learned that everything is freshly prepared and served. All the preparations tasted delicious.

Country roads is a great place to spend a weekend at. There are cute homes and activities to do there , complete with all amenities. 
The restaurant here serves Chinese and Indian cuisines. We decided to have aloo dum, kadhai paneer , black dal , naan, tandoori roti and chilli mushrooms. The food served was very good , with complimentary limes, onions and chilis to go with it. The dal in particular was very creamy and delicious. The naan was cooked well. All in all a great experience.

Last weekend me and my friend wanted to have a getaway somewhere city and he suggested Country Roads.
This was my first visit to Country Roads. I am still cherishing every moment of it - the scenic beauty, the rooms and especially the food. their food deserves a special mention as I came to know, all they cook in the kitchen are absolutely garden fresh! 
Every preparation tasted fabulous! especially, I would like to mention about the mango souffle, luscious and delicious! One must taste it whenever on visit.

Perfect picturesque setting for corporate parties with excellent food and activities. A piece of heaven away from the commotion of the city around kolkata. The staff are very cooperative, helpful and very courteous. We have had a great team building fun and a corporate outing for a MNC in kolkata. The sales manager debashree is commendable through round the clock support and extensive business development. She had left us with a great set of memories. Thanks debashree.!

An amazing experience. If you're planning to go for weekend getaway, this is the perfect one...backed up by a pool of well behaved and efficient staffs, CR is a perfect destination for all those romantic couples. Equipped with various adventure sports (Zipline, Zorbing, Kayaking, Ropeline), indoor games (Pool, TT), plush swimming pools and lush greenery, they are even capable of pampering your taste buds with a multi-cuisine restaurant and a bar...

Had a lot of fun with my colleagues while attending our corporate picnic... Simply loved the ambience and now I'm planning to visit CR with my fiancé very soon...

As our office is situated in close vicinity of this place, we always visit the place for official purposes like team meet, team lunch, meetings etc. This is basically a resort and a refreshing place altogether with swimming pools, other recreational games etc. Now coming to their foods. Foods are basically very ordinary respective to their prices. Most of the time they don't have all the items listed their in card. Services are not prompt either. Some dishes like paturi are pathetic indeed. Will never try this place if I have to pay...

It is a great place to be during the weekend. Perfect place for relaxation and the food lounge is so elegant that it attracts anyone to go there again and again. The food tastes perfect and is available at a reasonable price. The ambience is very soothing. I would like to visit the place again.

Worst at the time of billing. They mismatched there words. It was a huge dissapointed to come here. There was a mosquito in the bread they served us. The whole management is faulty with absolutely ridiculous staff services. This so called great resort with a 3-4 star ranking is a waste of time. The name which would be better suited would be ROADS and not Country Roads. Thank you so much for wasting our weekend. Our first and last visit in this ROAD. Whoever wishes to waste their time can come and visit. Hats off to the faculty.

I enjoyed a sumptuous lunch at Country Roads' Five Spices. After a long tiring road journey, we wanted some quiet and elegant place to relax and enjoy a meal. I simply fell in love with the place. Dining options are available in many places but this place has something that truly leaves a mark. The interior decoration gave complete comfort. I found there was also a poolside seating which I would definitely try the next time, I visit the place. Surprisingly for such a posh looking restaurant the prices were reasonable. I ordered Chicken Monchow Soup, Kung Pao Chicken and Chicken Singaporean Noodles. The food was delicious. I tried Ice Cream with Chocolate Sauce for dessert. The staffs were cordial in their service and took care of our requirements. I will definitely revisit the place soon.

Located at National Highway 6 the food joint offered us a big list of menus. We have been planning to take lunch break while we were on a long drive. We have easily located Country Roads's Five spices. The surrounding was too good that we could not resist to take the break there. The inner section was well decorated and cozy.  The behaviors of staffs was also nice to deal with.  We found a lot of option to choose. They were offering all the cuisines. The taste was also delicious to treat our tongues. The quality of food was also good. We found the maintenance was quite good to welcome the guests.
