Chinese is always one’s comfort food not just from minimum preparation time point of view  but also due to the exciting amalgam of sauces and flavors each dish offers.  Sector V , Saltlake is becoming an emerging food destination and Old China is a pleasant addition in it . However sometimes you do crave for authentic Chinese food which is so different in terms of subtle balances of flavors instead of  the loud spices we generally eat. Thus comes my outing to Old China. Situated on the Bytes Food Court, Infinity Benchmark, Plot A3, Block EP & GP, Sector 5, Salt Lake. The place offers a decent ambiance for dinning. Now lets talk about the food .  The potion sizes of the dishes were very good, especially the mains.  The servers have good knowledge of the food and I loved that they explained the dish to us as and when it was served.
                                                                ...

Salt Lake Sector-V is the first IT hub of Kolkata. And Infinity Benchmark is one of the commercial developments of Infinity Infotech Parks in Kolkata. This place has a food court in the ground floor. And one of the food courts is OLD CHINA. One evening, after office, me along with my foodie mates of Team Panch Phoron, decided to visit this joint.
                                                                ...

Present at the bytes food court in the infinity building. My friend and I, availed an offer on little app- 300bucks for a meal for two. 
First a chicken hot n sour soup was served. Very spicy, tasted good.
For mains, there was chicken noodles and chicken fried rice. The noodles was too oily and not that good. The rice was also bland in taste. 
For sides, we opted for chilli chicken, but sadly the gravy just tasted like soya sauce. 

Quantity wise the dish was more than enough u would expect, but taste not good.

A great place near Sector 5 serving mainly Chinese food is great the glare of its own. Mainly crowded with office people, this place is best for quick bites and serves delicious Chinese food.
If you happen to love Chinese and working near Sector 5 then do drop in to this place.
Happy eating 😊

Never visited this place physically but ordered online couple of times on weekends... they serve decent food considering the price and they serve it fast!
taste wise it is okay, not exceptionally good but hey! look at the menu and price!and the portion!
my all time favorite is chili garlic egg noodles (extra spicy) and salt pepper mushrooms or crispy chili babycorn.. one noodles with side orders is enough for two, plus they have happy hours 4 pm-7pm🙂

I tried out this outlet a couple of days ago, courtesy ordering for delivery at office via Swiggy. We ordered for Veg. Chilli Garlic Fried Rice, Chilli Chicken and Schezwan Fish. 
The rice had an okayish taste and was quantity wise sumptuous. 
The fish tasted disappointing. Although the fish was fresh and portion-wise generous, the gravy was blunt and dissatisfying.
The best of the lot was Chilli Chicken. The gravy was thick and tasted better than average. However the chicken pieces were very small.
Overall, the meal left us unsatisfied but to our luck, our pocket wasn't pinched much ! I would perhaps not try out here anytime soon !

Located inside the Bytes enclosure, Old China has been my saviour during my hunger pangs, especially during lunch hours in Sector 5. I have ordered through Zomato several times. I have tried almost all the noodle types and their egg chicken thukpa (this one i order frequently). I also tried Lemon Rice,  Non veg Thai red and green curry. The noodles taste great (but it's a bit on the oily side) and the thukpa is excellent. I also tried their crispy chilli babycorn. The food quality is good. The lemon rice has a nice flavour. It's light and doesn't feel heavy. The Thai red curry and green curry are yumm! The flavour of coconut wasn't overpiwering and the chiecken pieces were soft. Both are a must-try here.

I had tried a 3 course Chinese chicken meal from old China which I purchased from little app @299 for 2 person.Now coming to food- Food includes a hot and sour chicken soup..This tym I really liked the soup.Then next was 1big bowl of chicken fried rice and 1 big bowl of chicken Hakka noodles with 1 plate chicken Manchurian which had 6pc chicken.With only 300 Rs this deal is more than enough as quantity for 2 people.Taste of fried rice and chicken Manchurian was okay type.But I really like the taste of chicken Hakka noodles.But I would suggest the resturent to give less oil in chowmin then It will better.But one thing is bad in Bytes food court.That they didn't serve a single glass of water to their customers free of cost.Please from next time atleast give some water to your customers free of cost.And I would suggest to add mocktail and a starter with this deal @50 more.So it could be a bestseller deal in Kolkata.

Bytes have a chinese cuisine court and that's Old China for you. It serves you plenty of chinese appetizers but we decided to come along with 'American Chopsuey Chicken'. The flavour... The color... The essence of the dish will give you a totally different experience about chinese cuisines. The quantity of the food is also a true match for the quality. The crispy noodles along with the fine shredded chicken plus the saucy flavours... A Total Combination Of Sizzling Taste!... Need to get stuffed... Then make the easy step ;)

Located just opposite to the RDB Boulevard this is a paisa wasool Chinese joint. The food isn't that great but you get great offers from the Little App so no harm in trying chinese from this place if you are running a little short on money. The hot and sweet soup they serve is totally pathetic, they put a lot of chillies and totally ruin the taste. But the Chowmein and the rice are good. The quantity is adequate for 2 people to share one plate. The garlic chicken was quite good though the chilli chicken wasn't tasty at all.

i ordered for home delivery. they delivered on time. they also called me which is rare, for confirming my order. all went well but when i had it, it was not that great. their chinese is made mainly of chillisauce...and it taste just like roadside chowmein which cost you 50/- . they added so much chilli that i was unable to get the taste of the food properly. i ordered chilli chicken also, it was mainly cornflour and little bit of chicken hiding in it. i would say the price they are charging for the food is not equal to the taste and quality of the same. i have loved their packing and they also delivered hot foods. only problem is i  had  lot of expectation with taste. 
you can order from them as taste differs from person to person.

This is located inside bytes food court beneath Infinity benchmark. Ordered chicken schezwan noodles.
Tasted decent. Portion of chicken in the noodles was too less, however had enough of veggies in the form bell peppers and capsicum. Noodles were thin and much oily.

Update 2: Ordered chicken chili garlic noodles and mixed chili garlic noodles and lemon chicken and hunan chicken. The noodles were fine and spicy enough. The sides were extremely disappointing. The lemon chicken was the worst I've every tasted in the city. Please refrain from ordering the same. Hunan chicken was just about okay though.

Chinese chopsuey was okay nothing great tasting like cantonese gravy but the american chopsuey was the shocker. The american one was way too sweet and equally sour not like the usual chopsuey that we have had previously on other places.I guess ordering chopsuey was a bad idea and we had a bad day.

Located inside the Bytes Food Court and so it's very close to most the people having their office at Sector 5. It's one and only plus-point is the location only. Tried their combos and one of the available sizzlers on two different occasions. Got disappointed on both the days! Staffs are not that much attentive. Food is way below average. Garlic chicken and chili chicken were just okay, not good but lemon chicken and schezwan chicken were uneatable. The quantity served in the combos was good. They don't serve chicken steak sizzlers as well I guess. The normal chicken sizzler were nothing great either. It tasted like only chicken fried rice accompanied with under-cooked gravy. Won't recommend it at all.

What we ordered - Combos - Chicken Fried Rice and Noodles with Chili, Schezwan, Garlic and Lemon Chicken, Chicken Sizzler

Located at bytes food court near sdf building, sector V, salt lake, this Chinese restaurant serves ample quantity and good quality Chinese food at reasonable prices. Nothing too special about the ambience, but the service is quick. We ordered Chinese main course - Hong Kong chicken fried rice, schezwan chicken chowmin and chicken garlic as a side dish. The quality was okayish for a small food court. There was too much of onion, capsicum and tomato pieces in all three dishes, something that we didn't like.Overall, 3.0/5.0.

Bytes is close by my office, so its easy to pick something fro. China town if you are bored and exhausted outside, where there are just too many options but too little space to stand and eat! I.

Better than the other outlets in Bytes Food Court. Good for a decent Chinese Meal. Combos are quick pocket friendly. Noodles and Rice items are good, but their side items are awful. Tastes like a road side stall with low quality sauce used for preparation. Momos are nice. Pan Fried Momos are way too spicy. A bit too over price with respect to quality and quantity.

The lemon was over used making the dish extra sour as well as bitter. I was thoroughly disappointed with the quality as well as quantity. In an area like sec-5 such food quality is not expected.

I have been there with office colleague on sasthi. It is located near SDF at Bytes food court in infinity building. 
Ambiance was so so. We ordered chicken rice and chilli chicken, since it was sasthi and pick hours so order takes more time than usual. But anyway its okay.
Good place to have lunch(Chinese) during office hours. Price is reasonable.
Overall an average experience.

We were craving for some good Chinese food at pocket pleasing rates, when we found this place in Zomato and decided to pay a visit for our lunch. There are always loads of road-side stalls which sell nice affordable Chinese meals but then hygiene is not always kept on mind while you go for one such joint. So we were actually looking for hygienic nice Chinese lunch at very affordable rates, and at Old China we got all these, well almost :)

LOCATION - - - - - The place is conveniently located at the Bytes food court (Infinity Benchmark building) which has almost changed all its vendors six months back, and Old China is one of its new vendors. The Infinity Benchmark is located just opposite the RDB Boulevard building at Sector-5, Saltlake (close to SDF crossing).

AMBIANCE - - - - - The ambiance of Bytes Food Court is pretty pleasing, well lit and tidy. The furnitures are typical of a food court, they are nice but pretty ordinary. Though I found the area of the food court has been reduced to nearly half (in recent times) and so at pick hours you may feel the scarcity of empty seats.

FOOD - - - - - We went in for couple of dishes to get a hang of the quality of food served at this joint. We ordered for:

a) Veg Lemon Coriander Soup: Well it was nice and soothing with moderate quantity of soup in there. The taste was nice if we consider it is from a food court stall. Though I actually wanted to go for the noodle soup which looked pretty appetizing but my friend decided to go for this Lemon Coriander Soup which was also a nice way to start off your meal.

b) Chicken Hakka Noodles: I really liked the Hakka Noodles here, it had plenty of ingredients like chopped veggies, egg and chicken in it. It was tossed and prepared to perfection. Tasted even better with that Chili vinegar they serve. Would recommend this dish and it is definitely a safe bet even on the bad days. 

c) Garlic Chicken: The gravy was tangy and aromatic with minced garlic all over. But I felt it was tad too watery and synthetic in nature. This is some preparation which is sort of bookish and has no soul in it. You will at best feel the preparation to be okayish, but you can never term this dish to be great. The three chicken pieces which were provided in the dish had very little chicken in it :) it was filled with the tasteless coating which was a big let down, it was better to serve just one piece of solid chicken rather than serving three balls of garbage and charge that amount of money. Very disappointed. Minus 0.5 for this point.

d) Kimchi Salad: Clearly this was the WORST Kimchi Salad I had tasted in my life! It had some finely chopped cabbage drenched in normal tomato sauce and it tasted terribly bad. We tasted a bit and had to waste the entire dish, something which I hate doing. Minus 0.5 for serving such garbage in exchange of money.

SERVICE - - - - - Well there was a bit of drama that showed the real ugly face of service at this joint. My Kimchi Salad was not served and the person at the counter said that my entire order has been served, when I insisted that the Kimchi salad is due and it should be served as I’ve already paid for it (you need to pay here by pre-paid system with the food court card) then the person admitted that the Kimchi Salad has been finished, I said that I’m ready to wait. After waiting for 3-4 minutes I was served the normal cucumber/onion salad in a bowl!! Can you just believe it! They presume the customers are so ignorant that they can’t even differentiate between a normal cucumber/onion salad and a Kimchi salad! The person asked me to take it and insisted that this is the Kimchi Salad, I kept on denying and by that time I was determined to take the real Kimchi Salad from them :) Anyway, after waiting for another 5 minutes the person came back with a bowl of salad that somehow looked like Kimchi salad, but I found it had only finely chopped cabbage in loads of tomato sauce! That was the worst thing I had tasted in a while. Thus ended the Kimchi Salad episode which allowed me to deduct entire 1 point from their final rating. Anyway overall it took them a long time serving our entire order, as a result you will find lots of people in front of this counter since everyone is waiting here for a long time for their orders to be served.

SUMMARY - - - - - Here are my granular ratings:

Food quantity: 3.6/5
Food quality: 3.1/5
Value for money: 3.4/5
Ambiance: 3.4/5
Service: 1/5

Bytes Food Court has got few moderate options to have food and Old China is just one of them, it is nothing great or out of the world. There is no other Chinese joint inside Bytes Food Court so people tend to buy meals from them who want to have Chinese. The prices are reasonable and the quality is strictly according to that price range. Overall an average experience.

Cheers!

Its the groupon open voucher that makes the lunch cheaper. Been there lot of time with collagues during lunch time because its pocket friendly compared to the quantity and quality they provide. Food is quite good, service is prompt. Hunan chicken and sizzlers are my all time favourite. The guy at the counter is efficient. Only problem that exists is the limited sitting arrangement at the food court bytes, that gets overcrouded during the noon time (1-3 pm).
Cheers to Old China.

I went there with my colleague with a groupon open voucher. We could order food for rs 300 so we did. All we could order in this amount was a  chili garlic chicken noodle and a schezwan chicken. I felt the food was way too over priced and the quantity also didn't do any justice. But the taste was good so for that I am giving it 3.5

A small outlet inside the "Bytes Food Court" of Sector V.
As the name suggests, they serve authentic Chinese stuff. Ordered Sweet Corn Soup and Veg Rice Sizzlers today for lunch. Since it's part of a food court, obviously there will be self service.Preparation time was not too much. Some English numbers keep on playing in the background. Ambience is nothing great.Prices are not high.
Coming to the most important part - food ! Soup was just ok. The sizzler was indeed very very hot - it should be as it is a "sizzler". Taste was just average - nothing much to speak about. Quantity of rice therein was less and that of the gravy & vegetables was more. 
I have given such a low rating because of 2 reasons:-
(i) I found a huge piece of hair in my sizzler - which really pissed me off.
(ii) The rice had a very small stone in it which ruined my lunch.

Request the management to redress such grievances if they really want to survive in a highly competitive environment like Sector V.
Thanks !
