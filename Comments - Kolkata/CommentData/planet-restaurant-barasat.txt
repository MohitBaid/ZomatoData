Been there a few times.The biriyani here is quite different but good in taste.The north Indian side dishes are also good but a bit highly priced comparing to its quality and quantity.ambience is very nice but most of the time it remains vacant.So it takes a bit time after ordering.

I've been here once and don't wish to go again.
The decor and ambience is great. Location is good too, except the 2nd floor issue.
The food tastes average to good. But the quantity is awful and not at all worth the price.
Services are slow and weird.

Its near dak bungalow more Barasat. The restaurant is in fourth floor and the view from this restaurant is awesome. Tried chicken tikia here which is so tasty.

Well first of all it's ambience, very nice view from the fourth floor and service, food and other aspects are average. I must mention one point here, the cost and quantity is fare enough. Â I was there three times and will go there again. Thums up from my side.

Thank you, enjoy food.

The ambience is pretty good to hang out with your buddies. Food is average according to the price.  As we were sitting next to the window so the view was quite a pleasure to the eye.  Overall it's a good place.  But the gateman seemed too much friendly.

Place is good, good subtle lighting, foods are average but price is reasonable. Amount is also okay. Order takes time to be served. The gate man is a moron, as soon as we went down he was begging for tip. Are bhai wait,we are giving, we ain't running away. That was a big let down. Sitting beside window was good,good view from 4th floor.

Probably, the best place I have been to in this locality, in terms of food, ambience and service. The food has never failed to impress me. Ambience is perfect for a nice and quiet lunch or dinner. Staff is well behaved and caring. Aspects for improvement are always present, and I hope they will keep up the good job.
