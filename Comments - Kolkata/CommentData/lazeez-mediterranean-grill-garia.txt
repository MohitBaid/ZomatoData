Food quality was very average. The soup was good but may be they forgot to include salt (ha ha ha). The only thing is the price, it's reasonable else don't expect higher from them. It's a average restaurant.

My friend had ordered chicken biryani from here sometime back. The quantity given was quite good keeping the price in mind. Taste was average. It wasn't anything special,but it wasn't bad either. Have heard good things about this small takeaway joint. They arer mostly popular for their momos.

Food items are really good and the momo is utterly delicious. Just located at the basement of our apartment and thus it feels like of our own kitchen!!! Cheers :D

This tiny food joint is in my locality and one can't recognise it at a glance. Yeah it's pocket friendly. But quality is just not good at all. Moreover maximum items in their menu is not available. Not impressed with the service also. Improvement is needed alot

This tiny take away counter in our locality serves authentic Chinese dishes along with north Indian and continental dishes. I had the privilege of visiting this place sometimes and I must say I was not dissatisfied. They serve good food with A1 ingredients. Good food at great price.ðŸ˜Š

TOOK 2 CHICKEN BIRIYANI 1 CHICKEN BOTI MASALA AND 1 PLATE FISH FINGER TODAY AT ONLY RS.430/-. HAD A GREAT LUNCH WITH MY FAMILY AND I MUST SAY THAT THEIR QUANTITY IS ALSO MORE THAN WE EXPECTED. THE QUALITY WAS VERY GOOD. DID NOT HAVE ANY DIGESTIVE PROBLEM EITHER. THIS IS PERHAPS THE ONLY POCKET FRIENDLY PLACE IN THE AREA WHICH SERVES MOUTH WATERING FOOD.
