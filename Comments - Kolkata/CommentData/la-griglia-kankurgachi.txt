Visited this place with my friends. We had ordered Chicken drumsticks in Starters and Veg Hakka Noodles and Chilli Chicken as main course.
Food- Coming to the taste, Chicken drumsticks tasted quite good, but the main course wasn't impressive at all.
Ambiance and Service was good.

The roof top restaurant in Mani Square!! The view was amazing. Have been here only once. The service was too delayed. But the kebabs tasted good. What more relishing than the kebabs was the green chutney that they serve with the kebabs.
1 point for the view and ambience, 1 point for the name of the place and the rest goes for the food and it's taste.

The most important thing about La Griglia is the open space around it. This aspect attracted us as we visited there for the first time. As first time visitors to the restaurants new to us, my and my husband's cheat is to try out veg chowmeins and chilli chickens as they are normally well prepared and safe to the tummy. So, we tried out veg chowmein and chilli chicken here also. Not too happy with the quantity though but liked the quality. Looking forward to try out the North Indian dishes next time.

This is located at the top floor of mani square mall..attached with food court! Itz an open place at the rooftop! Ambience is nice!
Me and my friend Samrat D Alves ordered chicken biriyani which costs rs.160 excluding gst! They served it with dahi nd spicy salad..! They served the chicken biriyani with chicken leg piece which looks like as if chick was on diet.. üòè and a boiled egg and a fried alu which is supposed to be half boiled and grilled! The quality of rice was really good..nd it amazed me seeing the biriyani served with zafran!it tasted good! But the quantity was not for two actually! If you r foodie..then 1bowl of biriyani wont be enough..u need one more!
And i will request the management to give proper chicken leg which deducted the rating of quality! Otherwise it is good!

This is the roof-top restaurant at Mani Square, and a welcome change from eating at the mostly crowded food-court from which it is separated by a glass wall. I went there with my school friends for a reunion, and we selected this place for its open-air dining area and the panoramic view that it offers of Salt Lake & New Town.  The food too was enjoyable  ‚Äì we had ordered mixed chowmein.

This place really impressed me, to be honest.I had ordered an Indian Chicken Combo and that HUGE platter was the biggest combo assortment I had seen.There was a Butter Naan with sesame seeds and black cumin seeds.The taste was very unique.Next came Veg Pulao, Dal Makhani, Chicken Curry, Chicken Tandoori, Papad, Achaar, Sweetened Buttermilk and Salad, which was yummy.Also it had a serving of Coke as well.All these at just Rs.293 that is inclusive of taxes.
Coming to the quantity, it could easily be shared by two people and in terms of taste, it did not disappoint either.This place is highly recommended,if not for anything else, only for their humongous food platters.
Do give them a try!

This outlet is located in Mani square food court that serves pocket friendly dishes.Ordered Chicken biriyani combo which serves biriyani with chicken chap and raita with a soft drink and the amount served is enough for 2 people to be fed in one combo. Tastes very good and staffs are also very courteous.But as per my opinion, the menu needs to be rearranged a bit since this offers the same old menu which they are serving for a long time now!

So we ordered Chicken biriyani, tandoori chicken which was perfectly‚Äã done, though before ordering we thought that for such a price the quality and quantity will degrade but that was not the case the food was good..

completely out of the world¬†

felt like I was not even in Kolkata¬†

long far away from the din and bustle of the food court¬†

The food was not so inspiring but the view of the sky, the other side of the mall was so electrifying I still feel the good breeze ...

La Griglia is located on the Mani Square Cafeteria level of the mall, just beside the normal food court.

Try their Biryanis, Chinese non veg combo or Indian non veg combo. It contains a cold drink as well. 

Nice food quality though very average in every other aspect but cheap too. Service was a tad slow when we were there.

The staffs were really helpful and when they came to know that we were in a group of four, they helped us to select items accordingly. We tried their biriyani, chicken chap and raita combo and also some noodles and Chinese gravy items. My uncle was really satisfied with the biriyani. The Chinese dishes were good too.

Its located beside the food court of Mani Square on the roof.It is a open air restaurant and the ambience is good.The restaurant has a large seating arrangements.
we had Chicken tangri kebab and Chicken biryani.
Biryani and Kebabs were decent considering the place.
Also moderately priced.
Recommending everyone to give it a visit.....

Only the place tempts you to try here! Considering the pleasant wind that blows when you sit outside. Thats it nothing more you expect. Food is very ordinary and the service is awful. Just go there if you want to relax and enjoy the wind. Keep your tastebuds away otherwise you might be disappointed.

Was tempted to eat out here owing to the name 'La Griglia' and after hearing from a friend about it of her experience here. This might be an open air restaurant with a nice view and all, but when it comes to food I was left unimpressed. Had expected more deliciousness to be served from its kitchen. But then again ambiance was pleasant so I'm giving it a rating of 3 out of 5.

Recently been there after a really long time and the experience was fairly not good enough to give even a 3.0
The food was just usual in tests, not so good but not so bad as well. I can say if u r hungry then u can have it there. The worst part I have experienced was the service. The place is hardly packed with ppl, as much as I have seen it till date, but even then they were not looking happy with serving the food or taking the orders. These ppl should really learn that. Its only the open air that can interest you to stick in there with mere some starters and the service guys will not bother u with anything. Lol. I seriously don't give any reviews on the food cause I think its ok as compared to its pricing. They do serve food real fast and thats a good thing while u r hungry and are on rush. Good for a low budget casual hangout and sure u can click good groufies with the nice view at the background.

Beside the food court of Mani Square on the roof, la Griglia is an open air restaurant... This place feels awesome in good weather... and seeing the cloudy weather we preferred to have lunch here... And it really felt good seating on that roof...
We had
The Chinese Non Veg Combo Meal
It had Salad, 3 Chicken Drumsticks, Chicken Chowmin (or fried rice), Chicken Manchurian (5 pieces) and a Coke... and in just 290 bucks...
This dish is more than enough for 1 and sufficient for 2...
Taste was ok... but I was really surprised with the quantity...
#A place to visit in a pleasant weather...

I visited this place during puja so the rate was so high.i had to pay 550 for a mere 350 rupees buffet.that took sweat.but speaking of foods,those were not up to the expectations.foods were unlimited but cudnt help our hunger üòÄ ,beacuse of its taste.
wings and fist item on buffet seemed nice.so was lababdar a bit.
it didnt taste so well.so i wudnt suggest anyone to go for buffet..theres hakka and flame and grill over there.both can be a better option.

The location is amazing . Specially for the summer evenings . For me it was basically an extension of the food court . Though the food is pretty bad . Please don't try their biryani combo . Biryani doesn't taste like biryani here .  Thai soup and baby corn were okayish . Good place to grab coke with evening snacks. Not for dinner or lunch.

Had higher hopes visiting it. Had always thought of visiting here in trips to Mani Square, and was terribly disappointed with the food!
We ordered Mutton Biryani combo which serves a plate of Mutton Biryani, Chicken Chaap, salad, raita & coke.
To start with, the biryani didn't taste like biryani. Could have been way better. Might sound hilarious, but the potato lacked the Biryani taste!
Coming to the Chicken Chaap, somehow it felt the gravy was stale. Maybe I was wrong, but never liked it.
The rest is OK. But when the main dish disappoints, you feel bad!

It was the day after Bengali New Year, when I had to visit Mani Square Mall for some work and I was all alone. It was afternoon, and already lunch hours, so I was hungry also. I took to Zomato to look for where I can have my lunch in the mall, and getting La Grilia as an option, I thought to give it a try. 
I was having no cash at all. So, I enquired in the counter whether they accepted cards. Getting a negative reply, I again had to visit the ATM inside the mall to fetch money and get my order placed. (They should start accepting cards!!... Aaarghh) 
Going through the menu, from the Indian Combo section, I ordered a combo meal which comprised of Mutton Biriyani, Chicken Chaap, Raita, and a Coke. I ordered a bottle of water differently. 
I liked the biriyani, rice was well-cooked, soft, there were two to three medium sized mutton pieces, supple and soft, also the biriyani masala was evenly mixed with the rice. Overall it tasted decent enough. The Chicken Chaap was average. There was one large sized piece of chicken. Chicken was well cooked and tasted well no doubt, but it tasted little sour. The lemon juice went extra most probably. However, it was an okay dish to have with biriyani.
I loved the Raita. It tasted really good. The curd was very well mixed with the chopped onions and cucumber pieces, and it had a perfect balance of saltiness and sweetness and sourness, which made it taste really well.
Overall, the lunch was good, okay for an afternoon to have lunch here. Also moderately priced, placed within the mall, a kind of okay and good experience with La Grilia. üòä

Pathetic food, the biriyani was disastrous, the aloo which is an integral part of the dish was awful and separately fried having no connection in tatse like a biriyani aloo. The chicken chap was too bad it tasted sour. We took it but we couldn't have it owing to its awful taste. The price was comparatively lower but what's the use of serving food at a lower cost if the quality is deteriorated at this level.

Been thr many times, but never cared to review this. Located on the 3rd floor of mani square, food court, the glass doors beside the food court card counter is la griglia. Visited during the offer period of Rs51, and I would say that they served good food, despite discounts. The plus point of ths food joint is the rooftop ambience, and the open space to hang out for large groups, and also quiet corners for couples.

Mani Square Food Court has been organising "Mani Square Boisakhi Blast" since 2009 and here some food items can be purchased at 51 rupees.So,being the obsessive foodie I am,we decided to go on a short food trip to Mani Square.Our food trip started at La Griglia.First we saw that the prices were not Rs 51,but Rs 61.La Griglia runs its store right outside the food court.It has an outdoor eating place as well which looked really good.We ordered chicken drumsticks and the food arrived within five minutes.The chicken pieces tasted really good.But,the use of batter was high.The sauce in which the chicken pieces were fried tasted like an ordinary tomato ketchup.In addition to this,the person taking our ordres acted in a weird manner as if ordering only one item hugely reduces the value of a customer.Pathetic.I will go here again only if no other option is feasible.

It is simply one of the best place if you are looking for ambiance but if you are looking for good food it is certainly not the right place to check in. we ordered non veg starter and main course and 2 Chinese dishes and the taste was no where close to a restaurant available on the every corner in kolkata. Talking about the staff, they have n number of staffs standing in front of the billing counter but it you need something you will not find any one there. These people have to work really hard to improve the quality and the service.

The only thing good about this place it its location that is the rooftop of Mani square mall.
Seating arrangement is so so with the defective seats that will do disco once you seat on them. So many staffs hanging around but hardly someone responds when you call them. Food is so so with a very limited menu to choose from. Only the bhuna murg tasted good enough.

I'm gonna wrap it up in two words.. Food poisoning! Bad food, bad and bad food. Just don't even think about it! I ordered a lot of stuffs like pan fried chicken,chicken hot and sour soup, egg and chicken fried rice and schezuan chicken. The pan fried chicken was the only good item that we ordered, then came the soup which was beyond horrible (I mean when did chicken hot and sour soup had a fish smell?), I asked them to change it to sweet corn soup, which was again horrible it had way too much starch in it and lacked flavor. The fried rice and schezuan chicken were okay but still not worth it! PS: Did I mention me and my girlfriend both had food poisoning! Oh, I guess I did.

this place is a "must" for me, whenever I go to mani square. a big spacious open air resto in the food court area of the mall, serves quite different varieties of food and is really good in taste. have been there innumerous times, still, havent been changing onto the items we used to order. unlike, pan fried chicken/fish is a must for us to order along with chicken sweet corn soup. yes, I would want to admit that I personally dont like there chicken sweet corn soup to a level, because I find it a bit weird in taste. the corn kernels in the soup is always a bit hard and the quantity or quality of the soup is also not upto the mark; as per what I have tasted in other restaurants too. coming to the pan fried chicken/fish, i love it. its tangy, fresh, soft inside yet crispy outside with lots of capsicums and onions, less oil & extremely tasty. I am very much satisfied with this particular dish. hope to post the pictures of the food sometime soon when I go there :) for now, a must recommendation for everyone who ever visits LA GRIGLIA :-)

This is a nice little restro which serves good food and that too in very cheap price. We ordered Chicken manchow soup, pan fried fish and Indian combo meal. The food items are sumptuous. Also the ambience is awesome due to its open rooftop seating. Though its not preferable during summer season. They can improve their service. Hence deducting .5 . Apart from that, everything is perfect.

La Griglia is a rooftop restaurant situated on the 3rd floor terrace of Mani Square Mall adjacent to the Food Counters. As it is under the open skies, it provides an outdoor fine dining experience with a quite and serene atmosphere. The staff is more or less prompt and serving time is acceptable.
However, when it comes to food, I have to say that it's a bit of a let down. Granted the proportion of food served is more than plenty for an individual. However, the quality is not satisfactory. The biriyani and kebab platters, in particular are quite dry, and lack taste. When it comes to Chinese dishes, it's better than the North Indian dishes. However, I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's mouth watering. The price is reasonable enough, though. As a place to dine and hangout, it's not somewhere I'd frequent a lot.

Have been here almost every time I have visited Mani Square. Set by the side of the food court, its a pretty big restaurant with decent seats and quality food at cheap price. The only downside, one might say, is no AC. However with an alfresco setting, its a nice place if you are on a budget, yet want to have a full meal. Quantity is nearly always sufficient and the taste is good. Worth a try!

The only downside, one might say, is no AC. However with an alfresco setting, its a nice place if you are on a budget, yet want to have a full meal. Quantity is nearly always sufficient and the taste is good. Worth a try!

Went there for my birthday celebrations. The quantity and quality are up to the mark to be noted. Their combo meals are always worth the price you pay. Downsides are you don't even get a complimentary glass of water. The prices are a bit on the higher side! A perfect place to hang out - especially the open air meals!

I'm a sucker for rooftop restaurants and this particular rooftop eatery on the 3rd floor of Mani Square mall adjoining the food court has my heart not only because of its amazing view but also the food and the more than affordable rates it comes at. I've only ever had the Indian combos cos I'm in love with them and hence I end up ordering the combos every time I visit. The Biriyani combo comes with a more than generous portion of chicken or mutton biriyani, chicken chap, raita, salad and a coke, priced at 310/ 330 for the chicken and mutton biriyani combo respectively. The biriyani is great, so are the chicken chap and the raita. You can't finish off a combo by yourself because of the large portions, its a better idea to share. Also I love their Indian chicken combo more than the biriyani combos. For just 300 bucks, this combo is great value for money and consists of 2 pcs of chicken tandoori, kadai murgh, dal makhani, naan, pulao, raita, achaar, salad and a coke. Each and every item in this combo is brilliantly done. The Strawberry mist mocktail priced at ony Rs. 50 is quite nice as well. Also the staff is polite and efficient and they serve the food real quick, unlike the other outlets inside the food court and this earns them a few extra brownie points. I had once visited this place one late afternoon and the weather was pleasant and they were playing old Tagore songs which went so well with the rooftop ambience that I stalled having my meal just so I could stay a little while longer.

The restaurant is separated from the main food court and it is outside on the balcony. The food quality is good. Combos are worth buying except the mutton combo.

Visited on saptami durga puja... Buffet price was 550 all tax...  Thought would b a good one... But apart from a very few items... The rest were all bad... Food not fresh most of the items... Tandoori chicken was worst... A roadside tandoori wouldv been better.  Rice wasn't good and chicken was ordinary. And mutton gravy.. River of oil

This review is for the restaurant & the adjacent A/C party area as La Griglia manages both. The food here is good, especially their Indian items, though the quality has gone down with their increasing popularity. Some items are only available for the party zone (if you're hosting a party there). The previously efficient staff members have been replaced by rude ones & novices. The open-air sitting area is nice but uncomfortable due to Kolkata's weather (though it's fine to sit there in the winter). You can order food & consume it in the air-conditioned food court if you want. Their event management skills are still good but the management should look into the attitude of the staff & rectify the situation before old customers, like me, start degrading them.

Have been to Mani Square Mall many times but never tried this place. But the other day due to overcrowded food court we were literally forced to check out this joint. The roof top location and the beautiful afternoon weather gave us no point to regret. The service however literally sucks big time. We ordered Kalmi Kebab, Murg Tikka Kebab and fresh lime soda to be on safer side. Within 5 mins they served us the fresh lime soda and then after 20 mins later they asked us whether we have cancelled our orders or not ?!? We said no! And then we have to order again !! Then after 25 mins they served the kebabs. So 45 mins waiting time for a plate of kebabs. The quality of the food is strictly average. The kebabs however was cooked well, pretty succulent with right balance of spices. 

Pros:
Outdoor seating
Pocket friendly

Cons:
The pathetic service 

I will only go back to this place if I find the food court overcrowded again. Recommended for the big college gangs for quick bites and adda sessions.

On visits to the Mani Square food court, we all have eyed this place due to its open rooftop setting. And that is what actually lures people to this place. La Griglia provides affordable alfresco dining which is a rarity in our city.

The food quality is decent, nothing too extravagant, and the quantity is sharply proportional to the price. The combo meals are apt to satisfy gluttonous folk.

To dine here was an appreciable experience, but to be honest, apart from the environment there is nothing much to this place.

Shopping at Mani Square and then having a meal over La Griglia is great combination.. Outdoor seating is ok-ish, food is fine and very much pocket friendly.. Crispy chilli babycorn and sweet lime soda are great choice to Start with, on the twinkling sky and cool winter wind.. Then we tried Indian Chicken Combo... Worth than its price... Tender chicken tandoori, rajma tadka dal with tandoori roti, and polau with kadai murgh is soooo delicious and quantity is more than perfect for one person.. They also serve pickle, onion, raita, green chatni along with a coke.... A full phase lunch/dinner... But one thing I must suggest that this place can be made more decorative and attractive..

I went in the Mani Square Outlet of 'La Griglia'.

AMBIENCE (2.9/5)- Roof-top is good during Winter time, otherwise majority will prefer to be within the Food-Court Area.

SERVICE (3.6/5)- Nothing mention worthy. As usual a normal service, as expected.

FOOD (2.5/5) - Didn't had the chance to taste their Biriyani.
We had Indian Non-Veg Combo and Chinese Non-Veg Combo.
Food was not that tasty, good, but didn't have any 'Ahhhh..' factor.

POCKET PINCH (3.8/5)- Reasonable.
As per the quality, price was 'Thik..Thaak'.

Have frequented this place many times only during the winter due to its open seating arrangements which is really very tempting during the winter days. This place has me attracted only due to its extremely lovely ambience...other than that the food quality,specially considering the not-so-low cost of the items is not very much enticing.
The place is mainly organised for big b'day parties or other occasions and mostly remains reserved. Thus,their single servings are not very prompt.
I have mostly tried their combo meals which have the identical quality and quantity as the meals served by the other counters in the food court. No special effort is put in considering the fact that they have opened a separate restaurant altogether. The lollipops served in the combos seem mostly stale and chewy. The chilli chicken dry among the starters though is a tad bit alluring. Other than that no other item here seemed promising.
Overall,a nice place to hang out during the winters if you consider solely the blissful ambience,other than that no special attractions in this place.

Their indian combo offers you a tangri kebab,chicken side dish,pulao,nan,salad and a fountain coke..all at just 290/- and satisfies your hunger as well..Chinese combos are also good..

       I personally like the food....but the drumstick sauce must be little more spicy.....And the noodles amount should be little bit more.....

       I personally like the food....but the drumstick sauce must be little more spicy.....And the noodles amount should be little bit more.....
        The ambience is super....its open air..so it is good place for people who love open air restaurant...And suprisingly cheap also..

I totally love this place... Great ambiance & great food.. probably the best joint in the food court of mani square mall.
I love the Biriyani+chap+coke combo,the kadai murg,chilli chicken,chicken lollipops...
Price is not very high.And now the Baishakhi Blast offer is going on.You will get awesome food @ Rs51 only (excluding tax,tax is 10rs though). Go for La Griglia...

Not a very nice place I'd say. It's okay and their sitting use to be in a terrace. Hot and humid. So a huge negative on that from my part. Quality of food was also not great. It was okay, considering the bucks you have to shell out and its a huge value for money in case you have to feed a gang of 'bhukkar' friends on a birthday or some party. So, that way its cool. The tandoor here is good, I don't like the Biryani here. The kebabs are good as well. Its a good place to visit once the Baisakhi offers are on from 10th April tentative. So, again go here if you want it easy on your pocket. 3/5.

After an afternoon movie show me and my friends were looking for a cheap option for lunch apart from the fast food outlets.We were keen to try out this open air place.
The place is almost unbearably hot in the late afternoons.Be ready for your own sweat dripping into your food.We presumed that windy evenings would be pleasant with the view and everything.
Service was more or less prompt.
We ordered the crispy chilli babycorn and Indian Chinese combo meal.The food is decently tasty but the quantity is commendable at such prices.A combo meal is good enough for two people if you order a starter along with that.
Overall decent experience.

This is for the location, never knew of the open area sitout in mani square. Coffee is excellent here, worth the wait.

Has a closed party hall for 50 PAX. Glanced through the menu, it should work across a wide section of diners.

Had Tandoori Chicken from here. The food was brilliantly made....it was lip smacking, delicious, tempting. The tandoori chicken itself was of great taste but when accompanied by the dip made of yogurt, mint (i guess) was simply an¬† awesome combination and the salad preparation was also so tasty. I have just fallen in love with this particular preparation from La Griglia and surely looking forward to another visit as soon as possible.

Among the food courts of Mani square this is much better and probably the best one which serves good combos be it Indian or Chinese. I had their non-veg Chinese combo a lot of times and it is quite decent which has chicken drumstick (2 pieces) chicken rice/noodles, chicken Manchurian (5 small pieces) and 1 coke. All the items are good but the drumsticks are better in taste than the others. I would prefer to have combos only from this joint in Mani square.

In spite  of it being a Sunday half the items on menu were not available..out of the limited choice we order a non veg biryani combo, veg Chinese combo, Monchow soup both veg and non veg, prawns..the combos and prawns were very average while the soups were quite bad..

The service was quite average..the utensils used for serving were dirty..overall I would not like to visit the place again..

La griglia is an open air, non ac restaurant has been terrible on both my visits to this place.On my first visit we ordered for chilli paneer and fried rice and the food was terrible.
On my second visit to this place, i reluctantly visited this place with a few friends and the servers there were terribly rude. 
A huge quarrel followed and the manager did not help either. I was surprised at their behaviour,very shocking.

Never going back to this place.They serve average to terrible food and are extremely rude.
 
Never recommending my dear foodies this place.

so last week I visited it both before n after watching a movie at Cinemax. It was food festival time and being a super foodie I cannot miss that chance of dropping there a couple of times on the same day. Each item costed Rs. 61 inclusive of all taxes though they didn't compromise with the quality and the quantity. The staffs there were very gentle and polite too. On the first visit we ordered from Chinese cuisine which included chicken drumsticks in the starters and chicken fried rice and chicken manchurian in the main course. They were accompanied with a medium coke. :D. The food was good though the drumstick could have more spicier. On the second time our order was simple and sweet - chicken biriyani and butter masala. The quantity of the biriyani platter was really something worth appreciating considering when you are paying 61 bucks for it (courtesy the food festival ;)). Overall enjoyed the visit and it's a really nice place to go n dine.

La Griglia - Placed adjacent to the food court of Mani square ,a great place for an al fresco dining.. It can be bit odd in the afternoon sun but can be very romantic under the clear skies at night.. :-) 
This place is quiet famous for their wonderful starters ... So you can chill out with friends in the evening while enjoying some crispy starters..  I have visited quiet a few times and I can recommend the following dishes to my fellow foodies - Crispy Chilly Baby Corn , Pan fried Chicken , Fish Finger with tartar sauce and some Tandoori Items such as Murgh Nawabi , Qalmi kabab and chicken Tandoori..
Service is quick and prompt..
Best time to visit : 5pm after the sun goes down and you can also enjoy a nice view of the surroundings from the top..

It was winter, and this being an open air restaurant I wasn't too keen on it. But my friend had already set her heart to it, and hence am here doting down my experience. This place makes up for a perfect romantic evening ( even though we were not romantically involved). And most importantly the waiters didn't bothered us till we asked for it. 

Deciding to cling on to starters we asked for a plate of Crispy Chilli Babycorn and a plate of Spring Chicken. For drinks we had the Blue Lagoon, which was my choice and the Pineapple Mist, which was hers, but in the end we ended up exchanging the glasses. The Crispy Chilli Babycorn was a bit sweet, good in quantity and delicious too. I would, however have liked it to be a bit spicy. The spring chicken was served with a chilli sauce and with a thin batter was delicious. Nice time spent.....

One of those places with good  starters where you can just go chill ..... La Griglia is great for alfresco affordable dining which is quite a rarity in our city. Its a nice setting for a little "me" time or to take your special someone out and have a relaxed conversation over some good nibbles. 
My recommendations for the starters are Crispy Chilly Baby Corn , American Corn Pepper Salt or or try the Prawn version which is very nice , Dry Chilly Chicken or Prawn and Spring Chicken. I have never tried the Indian Food so shall not comment on that section of the menu in all fairness. Pair the snacks with a Masala Thums Up and your in a happy place.
Great to visit in the evenings especially in the current cooler weather.

A great place in Mani Square to grab a bite....the open air seating provides a pleasant relief from the hustle and bustle of the packed mall. Winter is the perfect time for this experience. The servers are not pushy and you can stay here for probably as long as you please. Very laid back place indeed !
Coming to the food....even though there's both Indian and Chinese on the menu...we decided to stick to Chinese starters. We ordered a plate of Crispy Chilli Babycorn and a plate of Spring Chicken. For beverages  we had the Blue Lagoon and Pineapple Mist. The drinks arrived first. Although they were colorful and had fancy names....they were actually pretty simple. Refreshing....but a tad bit too sweet. The Babycorn arrived next.....the quantity was good enough for a starter. It had a tomato base and was pretty tasty....though I wish that it would have been a bit more spicy. The Spring Chicken was served with a red chilli sauce that went very well with it....the chicken seemed fresh and the batter coating was less....making it a delicious bite. Overall, a relaxed environment that provides a nice place to hangout. :)

Went there on the 26th of December with my friend. The weather was perfect for sitting outside. :)
We ordered two butter naans and paneer butter masala. We later ordered for a laccha parantha as well. The items arrived after about five minutes of waiting.
The butter naan was quite soft. The paneer butter masala was quite creamy and tasty. We were licking our fingers as we devoured the food. But I felt the laccha parantha could have been better. 
The pricing was pretty reasonable. About Rs 220. A great option for some delicious food, served quickly, which will not burn a hole in your pocket. The open air dining is a big plus point, as long as the weather is agreeable as well.

La Griglia actually makes a very decent version of the tandoor items, and I have had their chicken biryani quite a few times. Although it cannot be compared to a place like Arsalan, the biryani is pretty tasty, and they make an addictive crispy chilli babycorn, which I love a lot. My favorite thing to do is sit outside, with a glass of coke and a few starters, like dry chilli chicken and chicken tikka, and just enjoy the view (I prefer coming here around 5-5.30) while I eat. The place serves up food pretty fast, and have a nice veg thali which is also quite good.

If one wants to have a meal while enjoying the weather outside, how many options do us calcuttans have, not many !! Though to be fair to the restaurateurs, such weather exists not for more than a third of the year but nevertheless, i feel our city deserves a few more open air destinations besides the barista or ccd outlets.

Located on the fourth floor of mani square mall, it is located beside the food court in a secluded open space with a great view of the salt lake stadium etc. The place engulfs a huge potential but somehow fails to travel the distance and ends up being mediocre. Though the space is spacious and clean, the seats are well spaced but are not so comfortable being made of wrought iron and ambience could improve a lot with better decor and music. Open kitchen looks very good, neat and clean. The staff are courteous and service is fast but staff mannerisms could improve.

Coming to food, prices are decent since it faces competition from the food court in front and various fine dining restaurants at a floor above like haka, rajdhani, machaan, flame n grill etc The food options include north indian and chinese ala carte menu with a few combos that are formulated well and pretty filling for a person at 200 bucks.

The food is very good at such prices especially the chinese. I think the crispy chilli babycorn or a chilli paneer are pretty good though the serving is not so generous but at these prices, i would prefer them maintaining the quality over quantity. Fried rice is pretty good and the stir fried english greens, manchurian the best dishes to go along. Indian kebabs are pretty well grilled. Rotis are decent and black dal, paneer makhani are nice. Veg biryani is not avaialble which i hate.

I feel the food is very good without being heavy on the pockets and that open air seating makes for a deadly combination but the place does not do justice to them by compromising on the ambience. Overall if one is looking for good food on a roof top without fascination for a fine dining experience, la griglia is worth a try !!

This was the first time I dropped by the rooftop restaurant at Mani Square. I have sectioned my review in 3 parts.
Ambience : Being on the rooftop, the soothing breeze and the view is something to look forward to. However, on a bright sunny day its kind of hot to sit out there. So if you're planning to dine out , give this a shot  but for a quick lunch it is to be avoided. 

Food : We ordered crispy chili baby corn which was good. Nothing too special though.The proportion was good for 2-3 people as a starter. Next came the noodles. Well, the proportion per plate is for 1 person , an average eater. comparing the price the proportion is acceptable though. The chili paneer was a bit overcooked. and the paneer was not that soft. 
a few of us tried the indian dishes. The kulcha paratha is good with stuffing,and the butter nun was soft  but again the size is just for 1 person. And if you're really hungry you may even require two.
the combo meal is preferable if 2-3 people go, else depending on the quantity and price for a group of 5+ , combos should be avoided..
The pasta is good. the proportion is enough for 2 average eaters. Sandwiches are a disappointment though.toasted bread with just the stuffing,without even a slice of cheese ( if you're counting you're calories you may go for them. These sure won't grow your curves)

service : the waiters were polite. credit cards are accepted and you don't require to make the food court card for dining here. 

ambience : 3/5
food: 2.5/5
service : 3/5

This is the only rooftop open air restaurant in mani square mall,and the ambience makes this place extraordinary. You can get a view of the entire salt lake area including the salt lake stadium just in front The other side faces the food court of mani square. Coming to the food,tengri kebabs are exceptional here. The Biryani is not that good in my opinion. Summer and monsoons always keep me away from open air ambience,otherwise it's a very good place for mughlai food.

I simply love the ambience of this rooftop restaurant. I've tasted both the Chinese and the Indian here, and I liked the former better. The Biriyani was nice, nothing extraordinary, the only advantage being the chicken pieces they serve. The chicken was tender and juicy. They also serve an egg with the Biriyani which will surely amuse the egg-lovers. On the whole, the food is decently priced and well cooked simultaneously. So, if you wish to enjoy a meal without a pocket crunch 'La Griglia' is your destination.

We were out for a night show @ Cinemax Mani Sq and wanted to have dinner before that. Everything was good about this place.
1. The Food Court unlike others, takes cards. That's great!
2. Prices are Very Reasonable.
3. The food quality is good enough and the portions good for more than 1 person.
4. The open air renders a lovely breeze[that's provided by somebody higher up :-), but the good part is they don't charge a premium for that]

I loved it!!!

This is an open air restaurant besides the Mani Square food court. So you can enjoy your food inside the comfort of the food court air-conditioning during the summer times or enjoy a pleasant breeze in the cool evenings while having your food. This place has a plain but neat decor, well behaved and prompt staff and most importantly pretty good food. The items are reasonably priced. My favourite from this place is Crispy chilly baby corn, Keema matar and Masala kulcha. The biriyani is good too, if not great. A much better place place to have your dinner or some light food after a movie at the mall compared to the others on the food court.

La Griglia is one of the food outlets at mani square food court. Since there are so many food outlets in the food court, one might miss it. However from my experience i would suggest the foodies to give it a try.
Firstly about the place, it's a rooftop restaurant, different from the usual restaurant settings.So you can enjoy some quiet and nice time with friends and family. There is nothing much to the decor, just decent spread of tables and chairs.
Rooftop may become a problem during summers, but you can order there and have food inside the food court.
Now the food, I have tried pan fried fish, pan fried chicken, Crispy chilly baby corn and the veg and non veg Chinese as well as Indian combo meals.
Pan fried fish is really special. Fish is cooked with capsicum, tomato and onion. Fish is always fresh and tasty.So this dish is worth a try,
The combo meals are also good and worth the money. The Non veg Indian combo meal is delicious and very filling. 
The other dishes are tasty and good.
Overall - A good experience. Nothing very special, but the standard dishes are well prepared and worth the money.
