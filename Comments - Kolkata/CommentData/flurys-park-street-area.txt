I can't believe how bad the standard of food has become in Flury's. The masala omelette, which earlier used to be so good, was terrible this time. So was the coffee. The cheese tomato sandwiches were nice. The place seems to have lost its charm. The standard of food has gone down drastically. Really bad experience.

90+years of presence & services!! Keeping the same ambience through the years is unique. Bakery products, snacks are all special. Sometimes we have to wait in cues to get in but the wait is worthy.

I have been here multiple times on multiple occasions over the years. One definite feel that you can get just by stepping inside Flurys Park Street is that of grandeur and aristocracy. The interiors are royal and stupendous with extravagant lightings, furniture and decor.

Coming to the food, cakes are great, not all of them but most are. The assorted ones like black forest, pineapple, chocolate cakes and rumballs are expectantly good. Sandwiches taste very ordinary and appear hastily made as there isnt much garnishing. Chicken patty is quite good. Once we bought a chocolate birthday cake of 1 pound and that tasted very humble too. The seating arrangement is nice but the service is slow. The staff are surprisingly complacent and sometimes they can be snobbish too. Once we were a group of 5 people and we had requested some extra spoons and the serving guy simply commented we share the 3 spoons laid on the table! Pathetic attitude and customer service. So we got up ourselves and brought 2 more spoons from the counter.

On most days its a full packed restaurant with people queuing outside for a seat. But much of the Flurys craze is from the hype thats created. Perhaps because of the hype, the staff can afford to be nonchalant even in a competitive environment. Prices are on the higher side but that can be justified from the lavish fine dining ambiance. Overall not a great place for great food but definitely a happening place for spending quality time with friends and family. Hence the 3 star rating because of its ambiance and historical heritage in Kolkata

If you know about Kolkata’s Park Street then there is one place you would know about for sure, Flury’s. A tea room that has been there since the time when Kolkata used to be the Capital of this country! It is a place which every Kolkata resident knows about and you’ve got to have a “Breakfast at Flury’s“ day at least once in your lifetime!

It was two months back. A farewell treat from a friend. She insisted in visiting Flury’s (being her favorite place in town). Moreover, I always wanted to come here, so, I couldn't resist the temptation! We were three hungry souls needed to be pampered! Yeah a lone wolf accompanied us (and annoyed us from time to time). Now let me tell you about our experience!

The very first thing we ordered is their famous English breakfast. Oh how long did I have to wait for this day! This wholesome meal is something one should try because it is a perfect and filling breakfast to begin your day, if you are a non vegetarian (Veg lovers may cry their lungs out) :p  The whole platter comprised of Omelette, Hash brown, Fried Bacon, Fried Sausages, assorted veggies also a grilled (eye-popping red) tomato.

Along with it, we also had Viennese Coffee; Darjeeling First Flush & Blackcurrant infused tea later on. Now, I went for something I usually don’t have. Egg Benedict. It was delightful. I will certainly order it again next time! The open face sandwich seemed to go well for her but I haven't tasted it so no idea about that. But I can say a lot about the magnificent Grilled Fish we took. It was the star dish. Very few people know of this dish. Those who missed it, they know not what they did! 

The tea was honestly a disappointment (took a sip from her) because this was the first time I actually had tea there. I am always a big fan of tea. Growing up in a Bengali household, tea is an integral part of my life. I was sad to see that they serve teas that I can get from anywhere! The Blackcurrant infusion was nothing but a gimmick. But the Viennese coffee was quite aromatic. It tasted fine too. 

Now lets come to the part what our silent buddy took. He is a strictly America dish fanatic. So he had an “American Overdose”. Starting with Americano and Bread Toasts, he moved on to more “heavier stuffs”. Mac & Cheese followed by Cheese Omelette. Hell, he even took American Pancakes! Quite a glutton, that one! 

By now, our tummies were nearly full. But, boy-oh-boy did she started ordering again! This time in the form of Chicken bits with fragrant rice & juicy prawns. Though the dish looks & sounds appealing, it tastes pretty opposite! It put me a negative vibe among us so we ended up ordering a Peach Melba & Red Velvet Cake. Yikes! Peach Malba was so-so. Red Velvet cake was pure sin! 

All in all it was a nice experience to have breakfast here, apart from the Tea & “bits” of chicken situation! So if you hail from Kolkata, you must visit Flury’s at least once; if not for anything, and then only for the sheer nostalgia. It’s worth all the hype!

This is the best bakery and café in town, in my opinion. Everytime you visit this, you will never regret it. Each and every food is just great, be it the cakes and pastries, to the pasta, to the coffee, and everything. 

My personal favourites :
• Non Veg Pasta (with grilled chicken, ham, bacon, sauté mixed sea food, tuna, olives, walnut, mushroom and zucchini.)
• Chicken Hot Dog (with lamb chilli, pickles, onion, mustard, bacon and ketchup)

Bakery with a small restaurant area located at the hub of park street area. I ordered :
Grilled fish : done to perfection. Melts in your mouth.
Fried fish : loved the crisp
Veg club sandwich : not the most exotic sandwich but a good one for a casual meal.
Roasted chicken sandwich : a filling sandwich. Would like a better bread.
Cannelloni : soft and filling. Not too cheesy. A good savoury dish.
Red sauce pasta : too spicy for a pasta

They serve tea/coffee with the mains which has to be asked for. Service can take a little time if it’s crowded. Overall, a value for money meal.

One of the legendary places of Kolkata Flurys has been serving foodies for decades .The iconic place & their famous English Breakfast is invariably mentioned in any description of Park Street .There is always a queue in front of the outlet during the Christmas festival period .The gorgeous interior with varieties of bakery items & beautiful smell of coffee greets you as you enter the outlet.The cakes , pastries are of good quality though price is on the higher side . The Almond Cube has always been my personal favourite.

Went there for a quick snack. Tried their good old Croissants and Bbq chicken wings. Somehow felt that Flurys is a but overrated and has lost its charm. Full marks for Ambiance, but the bbq chicken was okayish and was very sweet. The croissants however was really good and soft. Overall a decent experience.

Smoked salmon was absolutely smoking. The buttery aftertaste combined with spinach made it special. Just that the salmon was not as soft as I would expect.
The spicy cinnamon chocolate pudding wasn’t to our liking. Chocolate biscuit pastry and mousse were delicious though.

Went there just to have dessert cause were already full. 
Classy ambience. Ok services. Ok taste
The red cheese velvet pastry attrated our eyes but on the contrary the taste not at all attracted us.👎 had a higher expectations, bt tbh my taste buds didn't like it.

Moral: not everything that looks good, tastes good.

One more thing, you cannot just take a pastry and sit n eat... even if all the seats are vacant.. this was a major 👎👎

It is an iconic and one of the oldest coffee shop of Kolkata. This is the only place in Kolkata where one can still find full English Breakfast.
It also has a section for cakes and savories as well. The views from seats near the window are awesome as one can have a roadside view of the Iconic Park Street...It is generally crowded on weekends.

I am a big fan of Flurys. Born and raised in Calcutta, I am as emotional about this restaurant as any other Calcuttan would be. Now that I do not stay here, I love visiting the restaurant and trying my favourite rum balls whenever I am in town. However this time I had a very different experience.

We went to Flurys on the New Years day to pack some sandwiches home. We ordered Tuna Sandwich and Roasted Chicken Sandwich from the restaurant and Classic Chicken Sandwich from their take away counter. Taste wise they were perfect. But I was very surprised to see the price, ₹520 for a Tuna Sandwich!! But I thought may be thats the rate now, plus they were giving fries to go with that as well. The shocker was when I saw the same Tuna Sandwich being sold at ₹160 at their Kolkata Airport counter! So Flurys charged me ₹360 extra just for a handful of fries and the parcel??!!😮 Same with the Classic Chicken Sandwich, I bought it for ₹230 from their take away counter, when it was ₹160 at Airport! Is it because it was New Years day and they thought they could charge anything and people will buy? Was there a revised menu / charges just for this time of the year? Or is it a snobbish attitude that has set in?

This is one of my favorite outlets wen it comes to tasting some good fruit cakes n pastries.. One of the iconic bakeries in the heart of the City of joy at park street, this place offers a variety of cakes, pastries, patties, breads n even more..they never compromise on the quality n so pocket pinch is slightly on the higher side.. If being a Calcuttan u still hvnt paid a visit to this old n iconic bakery then do visit.. U sure won't be disappointed..

My first visit was on a regular day and we have had pastries at that time. I liked the pastries, although I felt it's too expensive. Visited it once more and for the second time during Christmas and I would say it's way more expensive as compared to the quality of food. The crowd was sober and ambience was good too, but the food did not impress me much. We ordered their set menu. First, they were a bit late in serving some of us and others had already got their food, so we had to wait for it. And the mocktail contained more cinnamon than I had expected.  Overall my first experience was not so good but I would like to visit it again for their breakfast menu, which I have heard is quite good as compared to other dishes.

Flurys has been a heritage landmark of Kolkata since ages and has been associated with classic English breakfasts. I had gone there a couple times before, for pastries but today we decided to sample the much talked about breakfast menu. 

We had to wait a while to get a table, even at 8:30 am. The Christmas-New Year decor is pretty with a big gingerbread house sitting in the middle of the café, and the hustle and breakfast-table chatter of the customers fills the air. 

We ordered the following:
1)Cheese Quiche: very cheeesy, as the name suggests and soft 
2)Mushroom Omelette: I felt it was bland and under-seasoned and didn't quite like it 
3)Eggs Benedict: This is an ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE!! It's basically poached egg on a muffin drenched in hollandaise sauce. They serve it with crispy bacon on the muffin but since I don't eat pork, they agreed to substitute it with hash browns. The eggs were perfectly poached and the sauce was so buttery <3 
4)Panini with grilled Italian Veggies: The bread was actually a tad too dry for my liking. It comes with a side of fries. The filling comprised of pesto sauce and mozzarella which was good had a taste of pickles to it. 
5)Pineapple Pastry: This was very fresh and creamy, and had a distinct pineapple taste of tartness to it.

All in all it was a sumptuous breakfast! The service takes around 25 mins, which they have mentioned in their menu and they stick to that time. The pocket pinch is however extremely high, our bill came up to Rs 1600. I don't think it justifies the food but since it's a Heritage eatery, the charm has got to do more with it than the quality of food.

Flurys isn't just another restaurant for Calcuttans, it's an emotion. Last time I was at it, I was probably in my first year of college. After a long long time had a great last breakfast of the year with my sister. Even after all these time when you gorge on the hash browns and put your fork in the sausages it manages to feel your mouth with the same old happiness. The prices have drastically accelerated over the years but in the end flurys is worth it. Our breakfast consisted of their golden all day English breakfast with black coffee, Egg Benedict with bacon (another top dish), American pancakes with maple syrup and cold coffee with icecream. The service is just right and warm. Don't forget to take a rich plum cake/date and walnut cake home when Christmas is around the corner!

It's the place where people go for a good breakfast, but I think it's a bit overhyped to be honest. I'll only be stating the negatives.
The food I'd say is fine with regards to their prices also considering such great breakfast places that are already present in town now. The Prices are high no doubt but people are ready to pay because of the fame that they already have. (Why would a plate of pancake (3 pieces) cost you almost 500bucks??)

You can always expect a waiting que before you. (Waited for 20mins or more on a normal Tuesday morning!!) Parking is always a problem in that area.

Service isn't greaaat, the guys are a bit laid back.

There will always be that group of classy aunties (pretentious) who will keep chattering amongst themselves with a fake English accent. (It can seriously ruin a fine morning).

The pastries are great though, no complaints about them.
Don't worry, you must visit the place once, if you haven't. (Or else, how will you end up bragging about that lovely 'Flurys breakfast' that you had?)

Stale and dry pastry, service that speaks of nothing really as no one even tells you the names of their pastries, go figure, poor ventilation and sad tea / coffee. Alas this place didn’t even close to live up to the hype around it. Do yourself a favour and skip this place.

I visited flurys on my first visit to Kolkata on Christmas Eve. As expected the place was crowded, there was 45 mins wait for lunch tables.

I especially love the way the staff treats the customers. The cakes and pastries are no doubt delicious. This is truly a destination for people with sweet tooth . I loved the black current plum cake but unfortunately it wasn't available this year so went for the dates and walnuts cake.. it was full of dates and walnuts which is very rare(I didn't really get so much of dates and walnuts in a cake from any other shop)

One of the most iconic places in Kolkata. Their park street branch is basically serving awesome confectionaries for last 8 decades to calcuttans. But recently, with the expansion of their business, the top class quality of flurys had came down a few notch when compared to their own older standards. However, with new confectioners coming up every other day, I guess Flurys really needs to work hard to uphold their esteemed name. 
P.S: Unfortunately, the catering service by Flurys is a total disaster. Personally, I would prefer if they maintain their quality and quantity in their shops first.

Flurys : Five Generations Of Fine Confection

English couple Mr Joseph Flury and Mrs Frieda Flury founded Flury’s at 18, Park Street in the year 1927.
It gained immense popularity as the favourite tea-room of the prosperous Britisher and the affluent Indian alike.

Flury’s is a special feeling for the city dwellers and the tourists as well. The old world charm that the place invokes is nostalgia for many.

Location: Flury’s is a landmark on its own in the Park Street area. Tucked among a number of other New and old restaurants the place attracts and caters to a wide array of hungry souls daily. It’s neighbours may keep on changing, but it stands strong and has seen generations come and depart.

Ambience : undoubtedly this eatery provides superb ambience with old English charm. The muted and brown upholstery, the grand chandeliers , seats overlooking the busy Park Street crossing impresses all. 

The seating area is a little cramped and on busy days one might end up pushing another chair. The confectionary side is a bit relaxed , mostly because it’s a take away area.

Food:
With time, though Flury’s have sustained their ‘H’ (heritage) dishes, they have also introduced new items in the menu to catch up with the contemporary palette.

#Meal 
Breakfast at Flury’s is widely popular. The English Breakfast is the most well known item on the menu. It comes with two rashers of crispy bacon, two grilled sausages, two poached eggs, one grilled tomato, two hash browns with two slices of bread & butter. That’s literally huge for a person of medium appetite.

Sandwiches come with fries. The typical sandwich breads stuffed with veggies or non vegetarian options. Not the best taste wise, in the city. 

Eggs Benedict , this dish was perhaps brought to Kolkata by Flury’s first.

Quiche and tarts are good. And equally popular.

#Beverages
Teas and coffees are served in pots and cups.
Flury’s is calligraphed on every cutlery, that’s a real beauty.
High tea is served with cookies. 
Lazy meet ups, cosy conversations, heated arguments,intellectual get togethers, the place has witnessed it all.

#Confectionary
The place can well boast off for having few competitors in the area of bakes and chocolates. Number of patrons are literally huge, and there are many families in Kolkata who might have never tasted cakes from places other than Flury’s.
The almond cake, baba cake, fruit cakes, chocolate boat cake, rum balls are the most popular. Chocolate boat cakes are my personal favourite. 
We are fond of their praline chocolates, almond rocks, truffle chocolates.


##Christmas is special##
Flury’s is a sight to behold during Christmas.
The beautiful decoration inside, heap of pink cake tins, aroma of cakes and brewing coffees, multilingual banters creates a magic like no other. Patrons and gourmets like us don’t mind waiting for hours before getting admission inside, and getting served.


As mentioned earlier as well, Flury’s is a special place,where one needs to get soaked in the surrounding for getting it’s essence. 
In the current era of advertising and competition the food served here may not be the best or something very extraordinary, but still it’s highly recommended.
The prices of the items on the menu card may not seem close to reasonable at times, still it’s an experience which pulls foodies again and again.

Note: If you don’t manage to drop at the Park Street main restaurant while visiting kolkata, don’t miss to pick up a few goodies from the kiosks at Airport food court, or Howrah railway station’s upcoming kiosk. They make the same great stuff available to people on the go.

It's Christmas time and if you are in Calcutta you should visit Flurys atleat once.  It makes awesome pastries and cakes.  Meore over the decoration and the entire experience is very special.  Park street is the place to be during Christmas time in Calcutta.  Being Christmas we had a turkey and the food was awesome. As the night progressed the crowds started pouring in and being the backdrop of beautifully lit up parstreet through the window was a lovely experience.

Visited this place after such a long time. The only thing nice about this place is the location and the so called “heritage”. The service was pathetic, the croissants were soggy. 
The 1.5 star is for the Egg Benedict which was decent.

The breakfast is awesome in taste. The eggs are perfectly made and the taste of butter makes it even more awesome. The Eggs of Benedict is a must have if you are planning to go for breakfast. Also, you can enjoy the yummy pancakes with maple syrup. They generally serve these with beacon, but they can be replaced with chicken sausages. The ambience is perfect to give your day a good start.

Does Flurys even need to ask for a rating? I think not.
If you are looking for having English breakfast, this is THE best place to go to, especially on a Sunday morning.
It does not matter if there is a long queue ahead, because eating out here after is worthwhile.
As good as the bakery, I need not speak about the Breakfast menu, because it is good, as everyone is aware.
We ordered :
• Creamy Chicken and Mushroom Toast ( a must try )
• The three layered, Flurys Club Sandwich, non vegetarian
• A three egg, light and fluffy omelet, served with white or whole wheat buttered toast.
• Watermelon juice.

Always wanted to have breakfast at Flurys. And finally did. Of course the atmosphere and ambience over there was "Christmas-y" with all the decoration. It was nice.
We had...
1. Chicken mayonnaise sandwich - It was grilled. The taste was normal , not something exceptional.
2. American pancake - Always wanted to have Flurys pancake. They serve the pancake with bacon. If you don't want bacon, they will serve it with chicken. The pancakes were very soft and fluffy. It tasted super awesome with the maple syrup.
Of course it is an expensive place. But it's okay to go there once or twice because it's worth it.
Overall I liked the place and it's food.

Every time I visit the city, I make it a point to drop by for a quick bite. However, the situation was totally different this time. The attendant at the door promptly threw her arm in front of my face, stopped us as we made our way in and shoved a menu on our face saying we could only order from that, after which we would be seated. At a place where I am ready to pay for the food and service, I would like to choose for myself what I would like to eat and although I had no qualms on this, there is a way to convey a message without being outright rude!! The inhospitable behaviour was a real put off and I chose to go elsewhere instead. Disappointing service!!!

I have known this place since I was a kid and there are many associated memories including running away from College for a breakfast. My first introduction was through my father who used to get assorted pastries for us. I used to love their chicken patties but this review is not about that.

We had gone for breakfast and had the egg benedict. One of the best i have ever had. Brilliant.
The Ham sandwich was good too.

Enough said!!!

There are mixed feelings on the cakes and pastries though.

This is it. I've got it all figured out; I have a thing for breakfast places. And this is the mother of all! There is a reason few places are given the  respect of legends since they rightfully own it and how! My vacation companion and me had planned our food schedules in such a way that after a night of careless drinking we decided to land here for breakfast. I've been hungover a lot of times and regretted it but not this time. The glass walls of the place let in plenty of daylight and it feels like walking into an English tea parlour as you step into this places. Serves wearing pink uniforms look like cookies with icing on top and a dessert counter seduces you as you try to focus on the menu. Not that it was an easy task to pick what you wanted to eat either!
After a long and hard time pondering, we asked for the Eggs Benedict and a Cold Coffee for me and an Espresso with Whipped Cream for my companion. The drinks arrived first and there's not much that could possibly go wrong with a Cold Coffee anyway. The Espresso was so delicious that if I were dying, I'd want that to be my last drink before my soul departs. The thick cloud of sweetened whipped cream and bitter, hot espresso screams flavour bomb and instantly put my friend in a good mood. 
Now, the Eggs Benedict deserve their own special place in the epic breakfasts hall of fame. It was such a complex play of textures and flavours, it would give someone an orgasm! The Hollandaise sauce over the muffin, bacon and poached eggs elevates the experience of a Benedict; this one in particular elevated it a few hundred notches higher than what it already had been. Perfectly poached eggs, a decadent muffin base, thick cut slices of bacon - oh, what a dream!
If you're going to enjoy a meal so much and not pay attention to the brightly lit dessert counter less than 30 metres away, you're cut from a cloth I have no idea of. Speaking of which, we were so elated by our breakfast experience that the desserts were sort of a disappointment. The Chocolate Brownie was very average and I say that because I've had better brownies before and the Biscuit Slice was decent with a few textures ranging from crisp biscuit that was implssible to break with a fork to sponge cake and cream like centre. Overall, I'd say that I'd go back again to try the pancakes, french toast and other brekky items on the menu for my never-satiating appetite for breakfast food.

The best cafe in town till date. It was a part of wish list for a very long time so finally did. Though I was their before for cakes and pastries, but this time it was about breakfast.
A very good experience, a perfect cafe experience and very comfy. The service was good and prompt.
The food was equally mouth watering and healthy.
I went there to try their english break spread which consisted of 2 hash browns ,bread,beans,ham and many egg and many more which was yummy and quite filling. Along with that their egg benidict was my favourite. Perfectly cooked and tasted heavenly and their hot chocolate with cream was the perfect end to this elaborate breakfast. Though the price was a little on the higher side but still worthwhile trying.
This was the perfect breakfast and a great place to meet up with old friends.

Spent quite a few memorable mornings here. It is not just about the food but also the company , the ambience , the heritage - the flow of people passing by unnoticed , with a lingering stare or with quick furtive glances. It is also about the lonely flute player outside , the melancholy ballonwallah and the almost forgotten customary visit to Music World while in Park Street. I love those lazy mornings here, where you watch Kolkata rushing past with a coffee at hand...doing nothing...absorbing the charm of my beloved city from beyond a glass wall.

One of the oldest cake shops in Kolkata and albeit legendary! 
Ambience- old world British high tea kind.
Food- love their croissants and sandwiches. Among sweet dishes, I love all their pastries! They are really unique and have a distinct taste of their own.
Pocket pinch- on the higher side. A slice of pastry will cost you around 100 while savoury items are priced around 300-400.

Perfect destination when you feel like having best pastries and deserts in town. 

Started with rum cake and chocolate pastry 

Decor is amazing and it feels so good to be here and spend time trying various cakes and pastries.

The service at breakfast was terrible. We ordered an English breakfast  with fried eggs done well on both sides and extra bacon instead of the chicken sausages. After about 20mins we were served sunny side up eggs with a runny yolk and chicken sausages! We then returned it asking them to make  the changes and then 15 mins later we were served the chicken sausages yet again and the yolks only half cooked!!
Very disappointing!

Wonderful decor and a very posh ambience makes Flurys special .. such a wonderful hospitality gives you a great charm .. breakfast at Flurys is like a mandate for all the Park Street area lovers .. I spent my first anniversary with my wife at Flurys .. jogger’s breakfast and sandwich were there for the hungry stomach .. and of course the pastries .. pls try RumBalls if you are visiting .. and yes you need to have a good pocket .. but it is value for money ..

The moment I step in Kolkata, I wait for the moment I go to Flurys.. This is the place that tops my list of best breakfasts ever eaten.. The English Breakfast is a must must must try! Muesli was ordered by a cousin - even that didn’t fail to make me go ga-ga.. Double egged chicken omlette was another best try.. The ambience was just amazing along with the British-styled decor that proves how old and well-maintained the restaurant is..

This place instantly takes you back in time with its quaint English café feel. Apart from their cakes, pastries and savouries, their English breakfast is worth a try. Another must-have is the Eggs Benedict - the hollandaise sauce left me speechless. Do try their lemon tart. I'm definitely going back to sample their lunch/dinner menu.. Although the place is a little pricey, the portions, ambience and service justify it.

I went to Flurys after ages today, hence I decided to try something new. I chose the chocolate biscuit pastry because it looked really interesting. A biscuit top and a base, I had expected the middle to be a light whipped cream or layers of moist cake with airy mousse, but to my disappointment it was a tasteless chocolate buttercream! Buttercream is 'heavy' in its texture to sandwich between a biscuit base and top. The top layer biscuit was so hard that the fork almost broke while trying to eat it! 
Being a dessert fan I really judge a place by their desserts, this eighty rupees that I spent would have been worthwhile if I walked further down the road for an ice-cream or two maybe ;)

Staffs were good and interiors had hint of old charm with chic music which will defiantly tune your mood in happy mode. It's a "Must visit" place in Kolkata.

The five stars are just for one dish - the eggs Benedict! I try to avoid eggs as much as possible, but how can someone refuse to eat this amazingly presented and temptingly served dish! The melting egg yolk, crisp bacon and soft bun make for the most perfect breakfast ever. The English breakfast served here is also good. I'm not a big fan of the sandwiches here, but the breakfast food is droolworthy. The darjeeling tea and flurys special tea are worth a try too. The ambience makes one feel as though they're in a capsule which is still in the fifties while the rest of the world has moved on. Really relaxed atmosphere... Makes for a peaceful, tasty meal!

A lot of my friends had advised me to go to gluteus Atleast for a bit when I was in Kolkata. I was rather full but decided to step inside as everyone had praised it so much. The place is gorgeous and has ample seating, beautiful decor and wide variety of bakery items along with a good food menu. I just had a milkshake which was good.
I think everyone must pay a visit to the legendary flurrys when in Kolkata.

My one stop solution for BDay cakes. Like their certain sandwiches too. Some others (sandwiches), on the contrary, are bland and insanely expensive. A tad too heavy on the pocket. A simple chocolate pastry comes for 80 bucks! Rather, their BDay cakes are more ecomonic (1 pound comes for Rs. 650, including GST). So if you are in for a BDay celebration and want a cake or craving for some light evening snacks and ready to shell out a handsome, then hands down its the place to go for.

Flury's is one of the most popular bakery shop of Kolkata. Their special sandwich is awesome. It is available in three types. Three layered veg club sandwich and three layered non vegetarian club sandwich and the other one is original open swiss sandwich with shredded chicken, ham, tomato, cheese. Coupes are also available. They say those are available since 1927 and is kind of heritage item.

A Choco eggless truffle.

Delicious and balanced. 

Topped with a thick,semi hard,sticky layer of chocolate with hints of coffee.
The cake part was dry. Two layered. Separated with a very thin strip of chocolate which wasn't too sweet. Finally,the little leaf shaped chocolate was a mild dark chocolate. The bitterness was barely there,slightly sweet and perhaps even had a nutty flavor. 

While eating,the chocolate would stick in your mouth. If anyone's had five star,its that kind of feeling.
Would love to try this again.

Staff service was very nice.

Relaxing and quiet ambience.

Nice and classic place for coffee dates or some "me time" or family hangouts..
They do serve freshest pastries and breads and all.
But price range is a little pocket pinch for some extent.. May be the prices for cakes and pastries could be reduced somehow.. but You are getting the best thing for that price.. so it can be neglected..
We had ..

Flurys thrives more or less on its history and classic vibes.The food is good no doubt but not uniquely delicious which its reputation makes you lean to believe. It used to be one of my favourite places to dig into pasta. But because I've been here so much, I've noticed a gradual decline in it's quality. Like the cheesy white sauce has started to taste more corn flour-y than cheesy. I take my pasta sauce seriously, so I've stopped ordering it altogether now, here.

With a lot of hope baught their pineapple pastry as I hard a lot of fame. It costed me Rs. 100 each. My initial reaction was, Rs 100 for a pastry?!!!

I still went ahead and baught. I am not a pastry lover but Both my wife and daughter are. However their feedback wasn't very exiting either. The cream is good but the sponge cake inside it is quite hard and not so tasty. Also it is overpriced.

I also had cheese croissant which was also pretty average.

So, Keeping the nostalgia apart (could we? Really?), we loved spending moments here!

One thing I must say, as pointed out by many, we didn't experience any rude behaviour from the staffs. Rather I must appreciate them.

So here's what I tried there, Jogger's Breakfast! Though I don't love Jogging :p , but I loved the dish a lot!

Located centrally in ParkStreet, you get mouth watering desserts at flurry's.

We went directly after a lunch at Peter cat! And this place didn't disappoint us.

Ordered coffee caramel roll which was exotic.

Lemon tart was perfectly balanced with the sourness and sweetness.

You get the authentic ambience at Flury's. The moment you enter the place is so lit up that you feel special.

The only thing which I wanna mention is that the desserts price at the given taste was not matched.
It is overpriced. I guess they should lower the prices by 20-25%.

Other than that one should experience flury's if you are in Kolkata.

Flurys in Park Street has a league of its own, which is mostly to do with the heritage attached to the name and place and less to do with quality of food that is served. I find the pastry they sell to be pretty standard, some tiny patisseries throughout the city are serving much more interesting and delicate desserts and pastries. Though i must admit, I am rather partial to their Almond Cheese Tart! The food, especially the English Breakfast, is again pretty standard fare. Snacks like the Chicken patty are filling but quite basic. Most people still go to Flurys because of the cult following that it holds, but I really think it's better to spend that money on the number of excellent eateries that have been sprouting up throughout the city!

Prime Location.
Nice and comfy sitting arrangrments.
Staff Behaviour : Polite and Nice.
Service: Good!
Food Quality and Quantity : Good
Not so pocket friendly.

We tasted :

English Breakfast: A platter of sausages, bacon, 2 eggs with sunny side up, potato cutlet sort of , bread toast, butter and white brand and a cup of coffee. A complete , perfect ,huge breakfast platter. Good enough for two people. But the sausages were very pale in taste.

Egg's Benedict: two buns with butter and bacon. Two Benedict were serve on them, with herbs(may br spinach, not sure)and garlic. The Benedict were perfectly made.Highly recommended dish.

Some chocolate pastry: Good as usual,but but but I got a hair in it. Little bit disappointed for this. But when I asked them, they replace with a fresh piece.

Though English Breakfast is famous over here but my vote goes to Egg's Benedict for its flavour!

Its a heritage hub of cakes and patties. The interior carries with it the British heritage. In my childhood I have had the cakes and patties of flurys but I am surprised to see that they have maintained the same level of taste. All the items are superb here but I particularly like English breakfast, mutton puff,lemon tart.
The food here is a bit costly but when it comes to quality the same is  more than justified.

GST included..

I have always tried to reach this place in the morning to savour the great English breakfast but somehow could not.  Hence have tantalised my taste buds with their amazing plethora of desserts. Well I have also ways loved them and the interior.  The old Calcutta charm that it retains makes it the number one still around Park Street.  But it is expensive.  Very expensive.  You are up for it?  Then you go right in,  sit  on one of those high chairs and enjoy the cheesecake.  :)

Went to Flury's (yes for the first time) on a Sunday morning for breakfast. The breakfast at Flury's is rather famous, and I decided to give this a try. My wife decided to go with a masala omelette instead. The waiter told us that there is some "technical issue" in the kitchen, and the only cooked item they can serve is the set breakfast. We pointed out that the set breakfast anyways includes fried eggs and toast, and it should not be too much of a pain to make an omelette instead of a fried egg. That did not help. Then we tried ordering some croissants, and were rudely told that all confectionary items are self service, and if we wanted croissants, we could go buy it from the counter, and then have it. At this point, we called time of death, and proceeded to another restaurant for breakfast which worked out rather well.

You may try anything here from sandwiches, omelette, quiches, cold coffee, puffs, chocolates etc etc and I bet you will not be disappointed at all.

The food was extremely tasty and of exquisite quality. The Grilled Fish Muniere melted in the mouth. The Mince Lamb Steak was very fresh and tender. The coffee and watermelon juice were the perfect refreshing accompaniments.

Can't give higher than this because of their limited varieties in pastries as per their prices and their fame!

We got 2 pastries

Chocolate Brownie( 7/10 ): It tasted really good but, it was too brittle so went powdery when I tried to cut with a fork (they gave). Costs Rs 120

Chocolate Cake English Something(9/10): This was good! Nothing extraordinary but not apt for the price they charge! It had a cold temperature.

Poor and limited seating for dessert orders.
Slow service.

Wasn't very happy as the hot chocolate we got served had stain at.the rim. Plus in order to get pastry we had to go up to the counter ourselves and order and get the bill and then show to waiter so he just delivers our pastry! What is the point of sitting in a restaurant  when we have to do all the running around????

Finally visited this legendary place for brunch! 
This iconic place have been serving people since ages and never did they compromise with their quality. 
We ordered their age old famous English breakfast with tea . Later we ordered a chocolate pasty. 
Have had English breakfast in several places but having it in Flurys added flavour ! 
Chocolate pastry was the best I've ever had. 
Will keep visiting this place! Because Flurys doesn't get any old and boring for people in Kolkata! :)

One of the oldest bakeries in Kolkata. Located at Park Street. Always wanted to try as have heard alot about it.However my experience was not so great.Had a blueberry cheese cake and chocalate cake. The cheesecake was okaish..less creamier.. the biscuit layer was not crispy and buttery.

We picked up the cakes from bakery counter and we're moving to the seating area. We were not allowed to sit there and we're asked to sit on the high rise chair only which is opposite to the bakery counter. That was very rude of the staff to do that.

Okaish food. Service bad.Ambience Good. Just over hyped.

This iconic place really needs no introduction. Though famous for its English breakfast , I went for their lunch menu. Ordered Fish and chips and Honey grilled chicken. They serve two pieces of heavenly Bhetki enough to satisfy two people. As far as the honey grilled chicken is concerned it will satisfy those with sweet tooth , the chicken was perfectly grilled yet tender and the  accompanying salad was fresh too. Overall a nice experience.

Flurys has been a part of our city for generations now. Our family has always had a soft spot for the pastries from here. Today we decided to go there for lunch. This place has beautiful interiors and the food served here is great. They serve delicious sandwiches here. The staff is helpful and friendly. The prices are on the higher side and you have to wait a while to get your order. However the food is worth the wait.

Don't believe the hype. Been here a couple of times and the food is average at best. Service is snobbish and condescending. Would expect them to have a good variety of loose leaf. They are popular only because of the brand name that has been established a few decades ago.

Yesterday 19th September was my wife's birthday and on 16th September I placed orders for 2 cakes, 2 pounds each, which was suppose to be delivered on 19th September at 12 PM.  

Order Number: 452 and 453

I waited till 1 PM and called the Park Street office, they asked me to contact the outlet where I placed the order and hangup the phone. Not sure why that person was so rude. 

I searched for the phone number of Metropolis outlet of Flurys on internet and found it on Zomato, I called the number and to my shock nobody answered the phone till 3 PM. 

My guests and friends started leaving my house. At 4 PM someone called my number and told me to come and pick up the cake. When I told him that I have asked for home delivery and paid Rs.300 for that in advance, he said that there is nobody available for home delivery. After this everybody left from my birthday party. I have never been this much ashamed in my life. 

At 5 PM a guy came with two cakes and I had no option other than returning it and ask for a refund, to which he spoke with him managers and assured me for the full refund. 

I'm extremely shocked to find such shabby management of a brand like Flurys!

Get your service quality right otherwise the good will that you have earned in the past years would not stand any where.

On my first visit to this outlet of Flurys at Park Street I am very dissatisfied. I ordered for a cream of chicken soup and Caesar Salad which took them half and hour to be served. 

The cutlery given to me for soup and the salad is ideally used for meat and are over sized, probably bigger than the plate which spoiled my entire meal experience.

The quality of the food was not as expected but mere ordinary.

When I asked for the cheque it took then 15 long minutes to make at it was presented to be after asking thrice. That also an incorrect bill was given to me. They took another 5 mins to amend it.

I was highly disappointed with the service and asked for the manager. The service personnel didn't even have the courtesy to apologise and he didn't even care to inform the manager.

I had to walk by myself and talk to the manager while he seemed totally uninterested to listen to my problems and to take action. 

Your organisation is under staffed and everybody has taken things for granted. This kind of service is not expected out of you.

Located in one of the busiest streets of Kolkata, Park Street. This iconic restaurant has been in Kolkata since decades! The ambience is amazingly beautiful and especially in the morning like around 8:30-9 one can get the smell of freshly brewed coffee and tea and the smell of breads. This place is surely the perfect place to start off a day!
The pocket pinch is a tad bit high but then again it's inclusive of the taxes (after the introduction of GST).
The food is amazing have been here so many times that if I start mentioning the food items I'll have to go on and on and on... However, one must definitely not miss the breakfast platter. They do take around 25-30 minutes to serve, then again, it's worth the wait.

One of the oldest and most iconic bakery shop of Kolkata located at park Street. It's a legendary outlet serving great cakes and pastries. The ambience is beautiful with a classic touch to it. The staff is polite. The food is beautiful to look at and tastes brilliant. The sitting is nice. Prices are a bit high compared to other bakeries. But, it sure gives you the colonial feel. Great place to visit when in calcutta.

I have been placing online orders from Flury's for quiet some time now and my experience has been pleasant so far. But today the pastries I ordered for were not the ones I wanted. Instead of Choco Roll pastries I got Choco Cube pastries. This is highly embarrassing since the order was placed for a friend and his family. So 3 rating is for wrong product delivery.

This iconic place is a must-visit if you are ever in Kolkota. Located on Park Street, you can easily wave it into your sightseeing itinerary and drop in for a snack or a meal.

The place is pretty huge and luckily for us, it wasn't crowded. The staff was nice but rather slow. The decor is sparkly and the ambiance exudes the charm of an iconic place. It seems to have been renovated through and looks very modern.

The menu offers a large variety of snack foods ranging from sandwiches to pizza and pasta and other savories.

I ordered some fresh lime soda, pesto pasta and dessert.

The drink was good, pretty standard. The pasta was also fairly delicious, light and the pesto was tasty. 

For dessert, we ordered a chocolate fudge cake, which left us disappointed. It was a bit hard and not gooey enough.

There are a variety of pastries and cakes to choose from and we simply made the wrong choice. It didn't seem so fresh but it wasn't too bad either. 

Next time, I will certainly try a different dessert. I was surprised that the food was so good but not so happy with the dessert.

The prices were ok-not too expensive but not cheap either.

Thats how see Flurys as, a genuine gentleman's place in the heart of park street. With an assortment of sweet delights to choose from, be it pastries, cup cakes or chocolates to the fine seating and a mean cup of coffee, I can see myself spending hours chatting away with family and friends alike.
Prices are a bit steep, but then again, its located on Park street. Highly recommended for a great conversation.

When you talk about pastries and cakes, flurys is one of the best we have in our city . I took a parcel of chocolate cupcakes , strawberry cake and almond cake . All three were best at their places . But I liked the chocolate cupcake the most , a smooth taste with Choco Chips inside . And creme were well blended and very smooth , the cake was soft like a spong bob :p . My favs from here are rum ball and choco cupcakes . Must try this . The Park Street is the best flurys outlet we have .

The tart tasted awesome than any other lemon tarts that i have tasted before. While the almond cube was so soft and buttery. Its totally value for money. Might come back for more whenever i am in park street. 😊

For the reunion of my University batchmates, we selected Flurys since it was centrally located and would have been convenient for those coming from both South and North Kolkata. The chicken sandwich was run-of-the-mill; the coffee nothing to boast of. My review may come as a shock to many who swear by Flurys, but frankly speaking it is only the decor, ambience and the view of Park Street on a New Year's Day which impressed me....not the food!

The iconic confectionary and coffee shop is a place most Calcuttans identify with. I guess you wont find anyone in this city who has not experienced what Flurys is. The serve the best pastries and cakes one can buy. Their breads have their own distinct flavour. The baked beans on toast served here has no match. The list is long....dundee cakes...patty....ommlettes....you name it and its just delicious!! If you are visiting the city....do spare sime time to drop in for breakfast here. Just in case you miss out....check out their outlet at the airport for some breads and deserts. Oh....need to mention their Coffee Sprungli....awesome....go indulge my friend!

The essence of Flurys is not the same anymore. They make you wait for hours.. FLURYS CHARM IS MISSING! It's just like any other place in Park Street. It is becoming dull and boring. Something is seriously wrong with the staff, they are daydreaming, frustrated and extremely slow. The quality of food has also gone down considerably. It's not a grand heritage anymore.

Result box full of goodies whenever he came to my place.
The Rum ball-Ambrosia.
Vintage look still partially retained.(Missing-Pressure cooker whistling at right side of main door,Old timers may remember or correct me on this between 1995-99).
And more eggless options now.
This time I had Spinach Quiche,croissant and Darjeeling tea.
Eggless chocolate truffle and Pineapple pastry.
No rum ball for me...though

Yes...the english breakfast was amazing! The sausages were really tasty and the bacon was really juicy!! Adding to that, the pancakes and the tea...made sure that we have a very good breakfast experience! However, the only thing that I didn't like was the sandwich! They promised that it was gonna be a mayo sandwich..but it had no hint of mayo in it! When we asked, they said they were out of mayo! That was really surprising!! However, the other items totally made up for it!  I would love to go back to this place...particularly for the english breakfast!

Not much impressed I must say. I can understand the wait outside on a Sunday midday, but not the interminable wait to have the order taken and food served. At least 25 mins by my watch. I sincerely hope that the kitchen facilities and staff are increased to handle the numbers. The chairs probably have bugs in a few of them, my wife felt couple of bites and discovered rashes later.  
On the food side we ordered the English Breakfast. Cannot say to fry eggs and bacon or toast bread you need superlative culinary skills, so the food was decent. The hash browns were smaller than Aloo tikkis, some room for improvement there. The coffee was rather nice. I wouldn't say the waiters were discourteous but they exuded the idea that you have come to 'Flurys' and you better be happy with how we do things. Even the check took 10 mins to reach us!

I heart Kolkata for this cup of happiness, this is their signature Viennese Coffee.

Had veggie walnut cheddar salad and the yummy almond cake.

Service was nice and staff is courteous and gave their best suggestions

There's no complaint about the food served in Flurys. Though the pocket pinch may be high, but the quality and quantity of food suffices for it.
The major problem here is service. It takes a lot of time to get hold of a staff and place the order. Also time taken to serve the food is also too long. Hope they pay attention to this matter.

We went to the place expecting good quality of food but frankly the place is more of a heritage site . We ordered two dishes - French toast and veg omelette . French toasts were very chewy and soggy kinds. And omelette had hair in it. I am sorry to have visited this place. It is over priced with below standard food.

It's got a beautiful interior with a very quite ambience..  The service time took a bit long which I think cab be improved, however the staff was courteous.. Me and my friend got this Creamy Chicken and Mushroom and Egg Benedict.. The food was good , however not an exceptional taste to mention..  If you are alone and wanting to get some "me " time, alongside a reader too, you can visit the place for the coffee or tea with the cookies and the ambience will definitely please you!!

We went there after dinner at Mocambo. The place has nice seating arrangements.
We went to the pastry area and order four of them. Rum ball was good, chocolate boat was just fine, chocolate roll was great and the bread shaft was bad. We also ordered tea which was nicely served and tasted fine. The lemon tea in fact went really went with the pastries.

There's no complaint about the food served in Flurys. Though the pocket pinch may be high, but the quality and quantity of food suffices for it.
The major problem here is service. It takes a lot of time to get hold of a staff and place the order. Also time taken to serve the food is also too long. Hope they pay attention to this matter.

This place was a disappointment. The only good thing about our order was the mutton puff. Both the chicken puff and choco-truffles were disasters. They charged 200 bucks for a cold coffee which was quite plain. Quality was compromised on a major scale. Ambience and service was okay.

Oh what have I not loved here!

Flurys always lives up to it's name.
My favorite pastries are the blueberry cheesecake and the rumball. 
The cookies are yum too, also the chocolates. Loved the raisin covered chocolates.
I should mention that the strawberry cake wasn't a favorite for me. 
Overall- a go to place for every foodie.

One of those crazy Flurys fans and I am going to write good about it. I have visited this place zillion of times. However writing this review for my recent breakfast experience. Opens quite early in the morning, thats the best part. Ordered quite a few number of items starting from Beans on Toast, the English breakfast, fried bacon with honey, my favorite cup of coffee and how to end the breakfast scenes without my favorite Flury's cakes!! Loved every bit of it. Service was okayish, could have been faster. Love the ambience of the place as always!!

Looking for some good deserts we headed towards flurys. It is one of the most popular desert and breakfast place in Kolkata. As we entered the staff told us that they followed self service and we happily took a while choosing from the varieties of pastries there. In the end we ordered four of them:
The chocolate pastry was rich in chocolate and perfect in terms of sweetness.
The red velvet was great
I don't remember the names of the other two but the one with the cream center was no doubt better. The other I think was baked blueberry or apple pie which was too hard to break and dry as well.

Flurys - heard a lot about this but could not find much when visited. It was over-crowded so was unable to get a seat. Later somehow managed it took a long time for someone to come up to our table & take the order. We ordered for a lime soda which tasted pathetic, cold coffee & sandwich - roast chicken, with mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato & cucumber.At the time of billing we were told the figure by a staff's mouth & then again it look almost 10-15 mins to hand over the bill to us. Not happy with the service definitely !!

Times have changed and so has flurys! Today I tried some cream of chicken soup and later some pork curly. The tastes were nothing to ride home about. Moreover the service is pathetic. It's not that this place doesn't have ample waiters, it's just that unless you call someone no one comes to you, which is kinda sad. Hope it goes back to those good ol' days very soon.

Flurys has been all time favourite for breakfast since the time I step my foot in the city of joy which was 14 years ago. Have been visiting Flurys ever since.

Ordered for a grounded spicy lamb ciabatta sandwich, butter croissant, baked beans on toast and a chicken cheese omelette.

Lamb was ground to perfection. It was cooked well enough for it not to be chewy. It was spiced enough to ensure that the spices didn't over power the overall sandwich. Croissant was just perfect. Cheese chicken omelette was just awesome. Enough cheese and chicken fillings without each of them getting onto each other.

The only disappointment was the baked beans. It had too much amount of beans to my liking.

Aah! Nothing can be more delicious than desserts nd breakfast here! Flurys is one heritage bakery in Kolkata, known to serve the best breakfast in the city! English breakfast!

You cannot just resist the ice creams or cakes!each one of it had its own taste which potentially surpluses everything else. 

The only reason for less rating is the staff behaviour which I honestly didn't like. There was a table of 7 apart from me nd everyone was busy serving them. Well one should provide quality service to each one o the customers, I suppose.

Its a bakery, cafe, historical tea point all at the same time. One could feel the heritage and vibes of the bygone era at this place. 

Food:
Quite good and satisfying food, will review dishes that we ordered

Croissant - Extremely fresh and great tasting croissants, one of the best I have ever had.

Chocolate Croissant - Usual I would say as it can't even come closer to plain Butter Croissant. Maybe chocolate filling was less.

Veg Patty - Very good vegetarian patty, fresh and great to eat, was very light as well.

Mushroom on Toast - A classic dish, creamy mushroom on top of bread toast, mouth watering and delicious, heaven for mushroom lovers. MUST TRY

Masala Omelette - Usual, nothing extraordinary, in fact I would say that it can be skipped.

Chocolate Truffle and Fresh Pineapple Pastry - Both the pastries were excellent, very fresh.

Beverages - cappuccino was good, cold coffee was very good.

Ambience:
Breathtaking... 11 out of 10

Service:
Very good, well trained and cooperative staff. On time service, did not had to wait for even a single thing.

Its a must visit place, simply for the feel and vibes that this cafe has and great food acts like a cherry on the top.

Very poor cake quality. Hard to believe that it was one of the best cake maker at some time. Very less variety of whole cake, old style Black Forest, I bought 2 pound chocolate cake today, taste very poor, local and poor quality chocolate that you can taste easily. The chefs need to work on taste and innovation, before the brand name fallen off.

Have been visiting Flurys, the Heritage Tea room of Calcutta since I was 4. Located at the heart of park street, the place has a British charm. If you are visiting for the first time, try out:
1. Rum ball
2. Almond financier cake
3. Darjeeling tea (the best in Calcutta)
4. English breakfast

Ambience: 4/5
Food: 4/5
Service: 3.5/5 (not all staff members are great, I find a few rude ones too who don't let you take a table by the window even when the tearoom is empty.)

PS. Kindly check your bills. Last time we went there, they gave us two bills ( one for tea another for the food) separately with GST charged twice. Which they aren't supposed to do. After being questioned they said "charged separately or together, the price which you have to pay is more or less the same with only a Rs2.5 difference. Now, you dont wanna drop down to that level and argue for a Rs 2.5 difference, but mind you, Rs 2.5 from 100 customers adds up to Rs 250 extra a day. So watch out for it. 

Nevertheless, Flurys is flurys.

Ahh Park Street! The most happening place in Kolkata. The city has grown and so many food streets have come up. But, Park Street still continues to lure me with its rustic old world charm, I will always be a boy filled with awe and wonder when I will walk down you dear Park Street, my muse, my lifesaver!

And amidst the paradise of Park Street, Flury's sits like a queen in all its majestic splendor. This place is older than most of us, it has almost a 100 year old history which dates back to the British Colonial times. Any given day, you will still find Bengalis, Anglo Indians and foreign tourists having breakfast or lunch or evening snacks here in harmony. The ambiance, the view through the window of Park Street Chowrasta, the vintage smell of tea, coffee and sausages will never fail to bewilder you.

When in Flury's, go for the English Breakfast, complete with baked beans, sunny side up, bacon and sausages. Have the Flury's special tea, which can get you back to pre-independence colonial times, when the finest Darjeeling tea leaves where brewed in here. Of course, have the Chicken or Vegetarian Quiche, the ultimate baked snack. And, well, how can you ignore the mouth watering cakes, pastries and chocolates?

You can also order birthday cakes from in here. So what are you waiting for? Attack now!

On a Sunday morning,  we had expected Flury's to be crowded and rightly so! 
Being Flury's we had both expectations of quality and service but unfortunately we were disappointed. A group of six adults, we were tended to and once the order was placed, we waited for our breakfast to be served. They staff however missed out on one of the items totally and then disappeared.  Hence we had to explain the entire order and what was missing to another staff. Finally, after a lot of confusion we were served accurately. 
The food quality did not match up to our expectations.  For breakfast,  we had requested omelettes but they turned out to be dry and rubbery. 
On the whole,  Flury's could do a little better to match up to it's reputation!

A trip to Calcutta is incomplete without a breakfast at Flurys.There are few places whose name and fame is as popular for breakfast as Flurys at Park street Kolkata. 
The legendary place is decades old but even after so many years,carries the old age charm alongwith great English breakfast. 
I visited the place after almost 10 years for brrakfast and was still charmed by the iconic bakery cum cafe. We ordered  my fav English breakfast which had 2 poached eggs,toasts alongwith sliced bacon,chicken sausages and potato hashies. Also ordered Vegetable patties,croissants and ice cream soda and hot chocolate to wash them down. 
The service was a bit slow as compared to when I was there last time in 2007, but food made up for it.
A sneak peak into colonial times of Calcutta revisited through the institution !!

Flurys is a good old bakery since many years... I read about it in zomato and also many sites advise it... It's a old bakery but it has kept itself in tandem with all the changes... My order was chicken filled croissant, chocolate truffle and cappuccino... The service was very polite and swift... The size of the croissant was enormous... The taste was really good... I enjoyed the food, finished it and I just kept sitting for some time to enjoy the aftertaste of the food... 😃😀

Our Sunday morning tea outing was a disaster. I haven't visited Flurys for ages so thought the time is right. The patties served were stale and reheated which made them awfully chewy. The bread basket was filled with baguette that was so hard that I almost injured my tooth and the tea was dishwater. Not the Flurys that I used to frequent years ago. I don't understand why patrons are still lining up at Flurys when there are several options today. Will never visit or advice friends to either. Good bye Flurys.

Flurys being one of the oldest bakeries in town still stands upright even after decades. They stand out in their breakfasts and Sunday brunches in-spite of their popularity in Bakery and deserts. 
The ambience of the restaurant is just amazing; an old heritage site of the British era, giving it a very sober and sophisticated finishing. The management isn’t very good here. The service has degraded over the years. I will not say much about their food, the quantity and quality are still the same. 
Flurys being located in a prime location in Kolkata is a recommended place for good English breakfast.

From a tearoom to a restaurant, the journey of Flurys is synonymous to the journey of Kolkata from early 90's to modern day.
From it's stand out breakfast spread to luncheon flurys today has evolved from just a tearoom.
But for me flurys is all about desserts, cakes and omelettes. As a kid by birthdays would be incomplete without a special cake from Flurys.
We all have different favorites and I prefer desserts over savory while at Flurys.
The English breakfast though.
Flurys is one of the few places giving English breakfast a exposure in Kolkata.
They have a skillfully crafted breakfast menu.

This place needs no introduction. Always been here for cakes, pastries and milk bread( favoriteeeeee😋)
First time had lunch here..and as I am on a healthy lifestyle phase chose to have their ceaser salad and my friend chose their mixed sauce pasta. 
The Pastaaaa was amazing. Such smoky flavour and aroma. Best best best. 
P.s. I am a Pasta person. ❤️
But I was not happy with their service. It took them 20 mins to just get us our Lime Soda. 
Aaand the Breakfast there is sooo popular, had to try it and I was not dissapointed. The sandwich, coffee, pancakes, fries everything was good. Inspite of being a sunday morning and crowded the service today was really fast. A good sunday means a good week. Will come here for breakfast more often now. ☺️☺️😍

One of my mom's friends sent over a batch of pastries, cakes and desserts from the confectionery section, and boy, was I in heaven!
Loved their almond tart (?) and cinnamon roll. The tart base was soft and buttery and crumbly, whereas the cinnamon roll was perfectly sweetened, filled with raisins. Loved their pastries too but not the strawberry one because I generally don't enjoy strawberries.
The rating is solely based on the food although on previous visits I have quite enjoyed the ambience even though I don't remember what I had ordered back then. 😅

Good place for breakfast and Sunday brunches. This old and historical place is perfectly located and it's always crowded. Their beans on toast and mushroom on toast is a perfect breakfast for vegetarians. Their strawberry shake is average but their cold coffee with ice cream is nice. 
I like the brownies. Their triple layered club sandwich is also good.

A bitter-sweet experience!

This place with its regal, royal t0uch is the best place for pe0ple having a sweet tooth and 1 can never desert the dessets 0n display here.. The ch0c0late truffle cake, the rich chocolate d0mes....
H0wever any place seeking to specialise should think twice before diversifying. Flurys is 0ffering a brief lunch/dinner menu but unf0rtunately the seating area isn't demarcated 0r sh0uld not be s0. The staff perhaps f0rg0t that Flurys is a cafe and not restaurant which is why they first made us seat by a window side but when we sh0wed 0ur interest in having only desserts, they asked us to vacate and shift to the dessert c0unter that had high unc0mf0rtable chairs - quite bitter for such a sweetening place, huh!

Known to all for its location and history, flurys is a must go for anyone who visits Kolkata. Try their lunch menu, you will love it. Desserts could be a little let down, but not the pastries. The pastries are great and a must have. :)

This is on every Calcutta tourist's To-Do list so as a first timer in the city, we headed straight to Flurys.

Location - 5 on 5 (what better than Park Street)
Food - 5 on 5 
Service - 2 on 5 (read on to find why)

The ambiance was like all old Brit era restaurants. One can compare it to UCH, Embassy or Kwality of Delhi's Connaught Place. The food menu was not very vast but it was a delight nonetheless.

Grilled fish meunière with mash and veggies was perfectly done! The grilled chicken was a tad under seasoned but well it was a first visit to Flurys and we were beyond caring.

We loved the Apple Pie the most from the pastry section.

Service - An old man with name-tag Rahim spoilt it for us. He was grumpy, frowning and he practically threw the plates and stuff on the table. Forget cracking a smile, he even poured water for us as if doing us a favour! A younger sweeter waiter explained that he has been in this place too long and has become like this. We asked for a repeat of the fish and he forgot!! After we had waited patiently for over 20 minutes and it was almost closing time (10.40pm) he simply said 'oh? accha?' He started clearing the plates when we had barely put the fork down after the last bite. He reminded us of bitter, disapproving, khadoos uncles! That was a spoiler.

Flurys is part of Kolkata's heritage and symbolises our nostalgia of the long gone British era! However with the last few visits to the place, I can't help but wonder, whether they should start thinking about innovation too, rather than JUST holding onto the memoirs of the bygone era. 

Their cakes, pastries and even meal platters taste the same old, same old. I ordered the Coffee Eclair which was good, but the base was too soggy.

Having said that, Flurys rum ball is still one of their best. 😊

Situated in the park street area and is very easy to locate.

The food quality is also good..
Not that much highly recommended to go.. still a good place to go if you are at park street area

I have spent many hours at flury's since childhood... Sipping coffee gorging in black forest pastry. And somehow I feel the best seat in the house is beside the window just overlooking what was once music world!!! Many have told me that the standard of flury's is not what it once was.... Somehow I don't believe that... Call me biased.... But I love flury's!!! This instalment of flury's my best friend and I went for a soireè. We had fried fish in jerk sauce, spicy and delicious!! And all pork sausage made into a spiral, served on a bed of creamy mash and dousced in opinion sauce... Yummilicious!!! I died and went to pork heaven!!! The red velvet pastry was very nice, moist and delicious! I had a Viennese coffee and my friend had flury's special mocha!!!! Awesome!!! And no trip to flury's is complete without black forest... And so we had black forest.... And suddenly life was rosy... And all problems seem to melt away!!!

One of the few places of Kolkata,I wanted to go since I was a kid.I usually go to the Park Street Area either during the pujas or Christmas,and at that time Flurys is always full.This Wednesday,I along with my mother finally could make a plan to go to Flurys.We had a Chicken-Cheese grilled sandwich,a Flurys Sundae and two pastries-Chocolate Truffle and Red Velvet.Delicious food with courteous service.This place is definitely worth the hype.

You can't write a review for a heritage place.Flurys is synonymous with the aura and culture of the old Calcutta.I frequently visit the Park st joint for chocolate shortbread, but this I went for dinner.The grilled fish was so exquisitely cooked with just the right amount of parsley butter that it melted in my mouth.Must try!

The place was in my bucket list when I went to  kolkata for some work.. The extravagant ambience of this place says it all but the place.. The place gives u a hint of a rich British rule.. Although the price of this place was a bit on higher side,  the exclusivity of its menu truly justified it.. The bakery products were economical and the service of the staff was also good.. The place is perfect for a breakfast or for indulging ur evening with some delectable desserts..

Flurys being the legendary English breakfast place, had to go there once in my lifetime. But the entire experience was quite disappointing. We ordered English Breakfast, eggs Benedict and pancakes.  We ordered a black coffee which we never received. Pancakes were tasteless. The staffs were absolutely disinterested in serving us.

With great food comes great responsibility says Uncle Damn! So when you walk inside Flury's, know that this place was once visited by the English for their breakfast. One of the oldest in Kolkata and obviously still surviving against all odds!

English Breakfast, Coffee, Grilled Chicken Sandwich, Chicken filled croissants, French Toast,  Chocolate Mousse, Mutton Puffs, Patties, Grilled Chicken Steak, Grilled Ciabatta (filled with spicy ground lamb) are to name a few of the best here!

For a long time,Flurys was in my bucket-list. Though I have gorged many a time over their pastries in the Jodhpur outlet,but I didn't get a chance to visit this outlet until this Wednesday.  Been there for a breakfast, we ordered for an English Breakfast and Flurys Sundae. My meal was a delightful one. The breakfast comprised of a poach,sausages and bacon. The coffee which I had there had a strong aroma and it tasted wonderful. Quality and Quantity were okayish..but service was a bit disappointing...
That's it..

Will the real Flurys please stand up?

This legendary restaurant doesn't deserve the rating. But this place is past its prime. 

It was a Sunday breakfast morning. Nothing better than a good family breakfast here. We reached early and this place was empty. We asked for a table of 11 and we had to join the tables ourselves. The staff here is rude. Really rude. I decided to ignore this and thought the food would be better. 

He took the order. I waited 45 mins for my English breakfast to come and it was horrible. The food was cold and not what this place serves

If you're thinking this is the same old Flurys? Think again. It's not. The staff is rude. The food is cold. Not a good place for a breakfast. Thats for sure. Never ever coming here.

As the stories go, many many years back the Nawabs of Murshidabad used to hold competitions as to who could perfect a better breed now cult Himsagar (called Khirsapati in murshidabad) , Langda etc there were countless other breeds developed which varied in size, shape, colour, texture, smell and so on. There was even one mango which was eaten to cleanse your palate between two different varieties! So no wonder that with time mango has established itself as the Nawab of all fruits. And the fact that it is seasonal adds more to its allure.

To my surprise  the service of flurys  has gone down. In this heat they didn't have cold water.  Ice was given in ice-cream cups and with a tea spoon. We were a group of 10 ladies.  Some of us had club sandwich which was OK.  I also had blue berry cheese cake  which  crumbled before the waiter could place it on the plate!!! The cold coffee with ice-cream was pathetic.  Cold runny brown watery with a tiny blob of ice-cream.

Apart from the fact the fact that everything (except the Peach Danish) took more than 15 minutes to arrive, there is absolutely no complaint as far as the food and presentations concerned. Really nice place and a must try in the Park Street Area.

Old world charm still lingers in Flury's and the way the staff is dressed confirms that the management is still in the 60's. fortunately the menu throughout the day is a mix between old favourites and world cuisine. The food is consistent and above average, the service is slow and the experience is nice but very overrated Bais the legendary tag attached

Was here when I visited Kolkata with friends the ambience was soothing with light music, nice decor and lovely aroma of the pastries. Sorry no pics to put as we were busy feasting on the pastries. The only disappointment was the butter cream frosting used for few of the pastries, it was too much of food color used in it which made the pastry a little bitter.

Just had one of the worst experiences dining here. The chair cushion was infested with bed bugs, so much so that it followed me back home on my clothes and gave me a rashes all over. Not to forget, the dead insect which found its way into my baked beans. Am giving an extra 0.5 in my rating only cause they replaced those beans with another one in one instance.

I have dined here many a times, but lack of cleanliness and hygiene was very evident in the furniture and in the food this time around. Don't see myself visiting here anytime soon, truly one of the worst dining experiences I have experienced here.

"For a Pastry Pilgrim like me, Flurys is a temple"
Flurys according to me is by far the best bakery chain of the city and its all about the taste lads. No one comes close when it comes to delicious mouth watering pastries. The sheer joy of these little devils made me crave for more and more. 
For the first time ambience didn't matter to me because my mouth was full and eyes closed to savour the taste.

Flurys is symbolic to an elegant and eloquent dining experience. I've always loved going for fasting medical tests at Tribedi and Roy because it was synonymous to breakfast after that at Flurys. The English breakfast and fresh juices add the freshness to mornings. I love their omlette as well as the simple chicken and mayo sandwiches. Tea and coffee sounds like a good addition. Apart from that, a birthday is incomplete without a Flurys cake.

Hey thanks for spoiling my mother's day. Don't take online orders if you can't deliver the right cake. Today evening i had ordered Pineapple fruit cake for my mum. Every year on Mother's Day i give her Pineapple Cake from Cookie jar because that's her favourite. As i am in Bombay i thought of getting it delivered , so i thought of Flury's .I placed my order for Pineapple fruit cake. Now when my mum was on a video call with me i see they send Chocolate eggless cake. I am sure Puja Rajak doesn't sound like a Marwari or Jain name that you send a eggless cake and secondly i wanted to surprise my mom not myself. It's not about money but like every year in wanted to give her the Pineapple Cake . Thanks

A moderate experience at Flury's.

The food and ambience is nice and elegant. However, this eating house is going to make you tolerant and patient if you have the will of course. Had ordered English Breakfast with Watermelon Juice. Thought that these two come together. To my surprise, the juice arrived when I was done and dusted with the breakfast. Hey, Flury's folks, please serve these two things together. Service is extremely sloppy. Everything bad also has a silver lining, I guess. You get to stay inside an air conditioned zone for a longer span.

This is one place I've been wanting to go since a long time due to it's 'name and fame' but was left pretty disenchanted. The quality of food is pretty average, nothing too good or worth hyping about. It's nothing to write home about. 

Personally, I felt that this place ran only and entirely on 'brand name' due to it's sub-standard to average food quality and an even worse quality of service. 

Each food item is overpriced and service is pathetically slow. We had to ask at least twice for the waiters to serve water and the proper cutlery. The dish was unclean and had to be replaced. To top it all, there was a hair in one of the puffs which wasn't replaced by the staff. 

We ordered a plate of Hash Browns which were alright. The Mutton Puffs were mostly filled with mashed potatoes and a minimal quantity of minced meat. The Chicken Puff was even worse, terribly bland with absolutely no hint or trace of chicken, just mashed potatoes filling, plus it had a hair in it. 

The Mushroom Omelette was again just bland and tasteless, one of the worst omelettes ever eaten. I, myself, can make better omelettes than that. 

The Baked Beans with toast were alright, pretty basic. 

The only thing good about our meal was the Spicy Ground Lamb with Tomato and Cheese Panini which tasted good but there was no hint of cheese in it and the lamb was too little. It still tasted better than the rest at an exorbitant price of ₹429. 

We finally concluded our despicable breakfast with a cup of cappuccino and a Black Forest which was just right. 

Are we going to visit here again? Definitely not! Would we advice anyone else to visit here? Sure if you want to empty your wallet for an average meal when you've better and cheaper options.

One of the iconic restaurants situated in the heart of Park Street, is well known for its breakfast offerings. Visiting to Kolkata always meant mandatory visit to Flurys for breakfast. Flurys is associated with fond memories with families and friends. It is almost after three years that we were visiting this place for breakfast. We tried to reach early, so that we didn't have to wait for long. Luckily, we didn't have to wait for long to settle. Yes, we ordered for our old favourite English Breakfast along with fresh watermelon juice and tea. The breakfast consists of crispy bacon, grilled sausage, egg, hash brown, two slices of bread with butter. The same taste which has been there for ages. We also ordered for mustard chicken sandwich and french fries. And at the end we had almond honey tart. The service was a bit slow, but we were not in hurry and were not complaining but were enjoying every bit of it gazing over Park Street.

Flurys is perhaps one of the most famous eating out places in kolkata, right in the middle of park street, its stood thru 5 generations, serving i am sure great food, desserts, breakfast and lunches, but today the standards have deteriorated, so much so that i ticked this place, only because of its reminisce value. 
We went here for breakfast, ordering the English breakfast and pancakes. 
The pancakes were not hot, the coffee was crap, and the butter had a FLY freezed in it, my only regret, i didnt take a picture of it. 
The continental breakfast had the most substandard bread toast, the only saving grace the bacon, which was first class pig back!!
The service  were slow, the cutlery unclean, and the prices, not so ancient!!
The crowd i must say is still the classic refined kolkata crowd, which i loved!

After having lunch from McDonald's Park Street  with great expectations and excitement I went to Flury's with a friend of mine. I have been living in kolkata from last 24 years but never tried flurys pastry to be honest ,but today I wanted to go for it,so yes I was excited.
As soon as I entered I was spoiled for choices and I was so damn confused.
Finally my friend ended choosing red velvet cake and chocolate cherry pastry for myself is what I went for.
As soon as we had a spoon of both of the pastries we were so disappointed with the taste of it.
As soon as we went for second and third spoon (since we thought at first it might be our taste buds so we thought of not wasting it) I was disgusted with quality of the pastry and it was smelling at the same time.
My friend went to the counter and told to check the red velvet pastry and to have one spoon of it himself,the guy just went in and replaced it with another one and I was like seriously? What's wrong with them?
I demanded for the manager to have a spoon of chocolate cherry pastry then ,he simply took away the pastry and replaced it with another pastry instead ,when I refused he told us that he himself knows that something is definitely wrong with the pastry and asked us to write down a complaint and offered us our money back instead and told us to visit next time to have a good experience.
So at the end of the day my expectation went crashing down as we both were feeling sick at the same time and we just decided to leave the money and the place.
I have decided I would never suggest anyone for flurys ever.

Flurys is the fame of park street. As a coffee lover I can say they serves awesome coffees over the years. In breakfast you can try their Arrabiata pasta, it’s marvellous. Sandwich is enjoyable which is stuffed with lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise. Desserts are also mouthwatering with different flavours of ice creams. Last time we took a pineapple cake from there for a friend’s birthday. It’s amazingly tasty. Pancakes are average but pastries are terrific specially the chocolate ones. One recommendation is go for their usual menus not for ‘’Pooju special’’ menus at the time of durga puja. Ambience is really nice. But Flurys is costly. If you want to enjoy standard breakfast and you are okay with the ranges you can surely try Flurys.

Flurys never disappoints. It's an age old bakery located at the heart of the city,and in the centre of the party street,Park street. Their desserts are to die for. Had chocolate mousse,brownie,and black forest. They are tasty at their level best. Can't complain. A must try for all.

It's a pity I couldn't eat "The Breakfast at Flurys", but nevertheless, I ended up there at about 9:30pm for a cup of hot chocolate and their signature brownie. I couldn't have asked for more, but the next time I'm in Kolkata, I promise that I'm going to get my hands on their breakfast!

They are known for their breakfast (not all good things are vegetarian, so non veggie buddies HEAD HERE!) and desserts. Ambience is amazing, gives you the feels of old Calcutta with slight a slightly English hint. 

Must-visit for all you foodies out there!

This place probably runs only on nostalgia value. Did not order anything and left because of the bad attitude of the waiter from refusing to give a 4 seater because we were two despite the place being empty since it was 3:30 p.m. to asking a Lady to move her chair while she was eating to make place to squeeze us into a 2 seater, and then bluntly refusing to serve us a cake stating those items are self service despite the guy at counter asking us to seat and order. So mismanagement at it's peak and not an ioata of shame or guilt when we walked out.

So , they call themselves a heritage place in terms of years in service but believe they should also invest in a) treating guests well , serving at least fresh pastries , having clearly defined area where you can sit and eat .  We picked up your pastry from the sales counter but even though tables were empty we could not sit and enjoy just because we were not ordering " food " from the menu .what kind of rule is this ? We aren't sitting for
Free - we paid for what we took !!! And to talk about the staff - highly arrogant , and really do not know how to talk or respect customers . It's a place I would never recommend anyone even though they boast about their delicacies.

Service Quality was really not up to the mark. I went around 11:30 AM today and have to wait for 20 Minutes approximately to get a customised arranged seat which I don't know why. We didn't told them to hurry up to get us a seat. It was not the traditional Flury's Table. Anyways, I Ordered a English Breakfast for me and dad. A bread Omelette with butter and jam for my Mom. Also there was Darjeeling tea on the order. We have to literally ask for the Jam and Butter to be served. Then also when I asked that where is the juice, the waiter told us that you didn't asked for the juice. Even though at a certain point I agree that I didn't asked for the juice or rather forgot to mention but then I was expecting from their end to have some talk regarding this during taking the order. They told us that they will adjust the bill of the Tea for two with those two juices.Black Pepper and Salt was not there in the table again. We have to call them to give a spare tray from a table.Honestly speaking, don't know why this kind of services they are running here. This is a honest rating from my side. May be it can be good or excellent to so many people but based on today's experience I am giving a thumbs down.

Located in the heart of Park Street, this establishment will definitely make you swoon with nostalgia.
The ambience is exactly what you would expect from any decent café in Europe. 
Sadly though, if you're going there for a good meal chances are you won't find many.
The food is average to say the least and for a brand as famous as this, the service provided here is average. 
So, if you're willing to wait for a very long time for a meal that's not quite up to the mark, then this is the place to be in Kolkata.

I loved the hash browns nice and crispy, I liked the food and juice. The experience was nice. One problem with flurys is their stuffs are blunt and snobbish. One man was playing flute out side the restaurant it was so amazing. Overall I liked the food and will go again for it.

Well this place needs no introduction!!
This gem has been catering the classy calcuttans and celebrities since the colonial times.
Famous for its pastries and the widely acclaimed english breakfast.
The brightly lit place,friendly staff and beautifully decorated interiors speak volumes of its rich history.
This place was definitely on the list!
Went there on a lazy evening
Amazing friends+intresting coversation+sipping on hot and steaming earl gray tea= a perfect evening
The tea stmulated the hunger centres in my brain and i ended up ordering the english breakfast in evening😂
The breakfast consists of:-
1. Hard toasted bread with butter
2. Two sunny sides up
3.crispy bacon
4. Two sausages
5. Burnt tomato
6.sauteè mushrooms
7. Two brown hash
Its was very filling and the eggs were well poached,the bacon was quiet crispy and the mushrooms wre quite palatable..
Want a Great place to hangout with friends or making a good impression on your first date? This place is the one u should turn to!
One of the best patisserrie i have been to till date.
Full of life, full of nostalgia..and if you are lucky u mi8 run into a celeb as they frequent this place often😉

Revisited this place on 9th may, on a lazy afternoon.
We ordered for early gray tea, double expresso coffee with butterscotch cake and fish and chips.
The early gray tea was as always heavenly, but the fish was a tad bit oily the dips and the breads served with it tasted good. As always the service was good, and the ambience regal.

I have visited twice and tried the English breakfast and the Joggers breakfast. The former is a much better option though they have very less variant between them. The ambience is  'okay' and the bakery food I had tried were nothing special to brag about.  The bacon is not so good though the sausage is one of the best I ever had. Price is on the high side.

I wonder what the fuss is all about. I was served extremely stale scones with my tea, and was refused quiches because apparently they ran out of it, but they did not seem to know which story to stick to. I was told: (a) they didn't have any; (b) they don't make it any more; (c) it's finished. The chicken sandwiches, too, were basic, which I guess is how it's meant to be. But the strawberry-something pastry looked dreadful and we almost did not touch it when it refused to break under the pressure of the spoon. And to top it, the billing was all wrong: I was billed twice for the sandwiches, which took them AGES to rectify.
I'd always wanted to try Flurys because everyone seems to like it, but my visit to the 'legendary tearoom on [the] fashionable Park Street' was sheer disappointment. I changed my rating from 1.5 to 1, as I wasn't sure to rate my disappointment.

This place is legendary. It is highly reputed and is known to be one of the best dessert places in the city. I have taken away desserts for home a few times, and I tend to disagree. In the brownies, they overload it with walnuts. Walnut in brownies taste good but overloading it doesn't help. Having ingredients in the right proportion is important to enjoy the taste. In mostly everything, they do the same. I feel the cakes are a bit on the drier side.
However, their tarts are nice and mousses are nice!

While I love Flury's for breakfast,  this was my first visit in the evening. As I walked in I was asked by the staff on what I wanted: self service or dinner? The system is really strange. After 7.30 if you choose self service you pay first and then you're served at the 'self service' section. I had reached at the awkward hour of 7.25pm. I didn't want to eat dinner so early so I chose self service. Since I wanted two different items, one a beverage and the other a snack, I was supposed to go to 2 different counters and pay. The staff themselves were confused as to what I was supposed to do. I was just wasting my time traipsing from one counter to another. One of the service staff was condescendingly helpful enough to let me pay for both together at one counter. I was beginning to feel very harassed. I had gone for the purpose of enjoyment instead this was turning out to be a circus! An extremely irritating one at that. 
This kind of system can be expected and accepted at malls or fast food chains/ low end stand alone eateries but to be at the receiving end of the same system at a high end diner/ cafe was a big let down! It definitely took away from the charm and class of Flury's!

This legendary joint in park street gets a 5/5 for their ambience. The place is sumptuously decorated and a cool place to hang out too. The quality of food us moderate. I think the place is overhyped. Their Baba cake was wonderful though. I have had better black forest than theirs. Their mutton patty didn't taste much good. Now coming to their staff behaviour, i must say that u guys really don't need to put up such mournful faces to customers it just doesn't help. They are not at all helpful. Overall foodies can give it a try for their cakes but i think take away would be a better option considering the staff behaviour.

Update:_ on later visits though i found the food ranging from average to good, staff behaviour again disappointed. As my order was of less quantity they didn't bother to attend me at first though almost four salesperson were standing chatting nearby, later one of the sale girl asked another to attend me by saying "bill quickly and leave her ". They seemed to be only concerned for the people dining in with bulky orders. Even they weren't much bothered to adhere to my instructions about the packaging i was taking away.

Have passed by many a times only to return for a brunch on a sunday "less crowded" afternoon.

The look and the location:

Fits perfect location wise and the look the decorum it has maintained is quite good or maybe average on the higher side.
I really felt that the long couch which provides a sitting area catering to three tables goes a waste amd much of that could have been used to provide ample floor and table area.
Needless to say that this place does fight with the problem that is space crunch.

The food:

The menu limits itself and your tastebuds and your hungry stomach. We had ordered pasta and crossiant. The pasta seemed quite nice and well prepared where as the crossiant lacked the freshness and the tenderness. I almost had chopped off the plates with the cutlery while taking a slice of the crossiant.

The service:

Whether it should be categorized under service or "space crunch" is completely viewer's choice. Which is; the neighbouring tables are so close to each other that the persons waiting your table has to curl and swing his hand carring food while he passes from your table to another. One might certainly feel that sooner or later the waiter might trip the food on to you.


P.S: Space crunch is an issue.

Likes: the decor, the cake, the entire place is love.
Dislikes: i feel their Patties are a bit too dry.

One of the iconic places in Kolkata, a breakfast at Flurry's never hurt nobody. They have a vast menu to chose from and of course I went for the must haves in breakfast that is the pancake and French toast and some eggs and some sandwich all of which was above average. The pancakes and sandwich were really good. The place is not very expensive and even students going dutch can afford it so I say why not pay this place a customary visit! @tinglytastebuds

I had recently visited the Flurys on Park street and my experience there was mildly disappointing. Let me first point out all the good about Flurys. The anytime tea is a must try for anyone who has even a little love for tea, they offer great selection of pastries and cakes and the ambience pairs well with the offerings.
The bad about Flurys was the quality of service I experienced, which was borderline rude. So, if you want to have some good tea and desserts with a dash of bad service do visit Flurys.

You can spend a whole day here. Seriously! Start your day with the famous English breakfast, have lunch with their soup and pasta and end it with Flurry's Sundae..... how does that sound?  :)

Severely disappointed with the "iconic" Flurys of Kolkata. 
A red velvet cake worth Rs. 650 bought in March 2017 not only tasted awful and nothing like a proper red velvet cake, it was stale and smelled like it was in some paper box for a long time. It even caused a few upset tummies. The artificial colour they used was so terrible that it coloured your mouth in a deep hue of red for quite some time.
While buying, they mistakenly added some patties to our bill which we hadn't ordered and refused to change saying that "Bill toh ban gaya hai, abhi change nahi hoga" and forced us to pay!! Luckily we found the people who had actually ordered those and they took their stuff! 
Legendary eateries shouldn't let their fans down this way... Actual photo of the cake given below!

Awesome ambience,staffs are nice and polite,great place to spend time friends and family.
food is really tasty, healthy and heavy. If you are having breakfast, you need not have to take mid time food upto lunch.
There is also cake and chocolate parlour inside with attracting packaging.
It is located in the main road of park Street area. You can easily find out and must try this place.

I went there with by college buddies in search of some deserts of good quality especially cake. Well, we all(9) started with chocolate cake which was awesome followed by a fantastic chocolate mouse. It was the best item of the day. But we also tried a lemon cake which was shit resulting in lowering ur rating.

Brilliant food and disgusting service - this is where you really gets confused whether to revisit or not.

Flurys in Kolkata is a legendary cafe and known amongst all foodies, specially those with sweet tooth.

This outlet in Park Street area is one of the oldest outlet of Flurys, and has a charming decor and lights. They have some beautiful chandeliers hanging on the roof and a huge place for dine in.

The cappuccino there was just brilliant with strong aromas of coffee and the perfect flavour. Really relished it.

Corn and Spinach Quiche was soft with lot of cheese and just melted in the mouth. Chicken Patties was also good.

Non-veg club sandwich was also brilliant with the egg, chicken and a different twist in favour coming from pineapple. 

Brownie with Ice Cream was out of the world. Baba Cake was little hard, could have been more soft.

Coming to the service, it was awful. It's an example of how a bad service can ruin the reputation of restaurant serving lip smacking food. The staffs were arrogant, not attentive and clueless of the orders they were taking. 

Overall the food was great, and would visit again only because of the food - service might be repulsion.

When ur in Park Street n it's about patisserie the one that lingers in mind is this destination. The blend of cakes that will simply melt in ur mouth n the wide variety of innovations! Well we had only the #Blueberry Cheesecake. It was so soft n creamy with the nutty berries jam on top n the crusty base of butter n biscuits is just too good to complete ur dessert with the soulful sweetness!

There's really nothing new I can add to all that has been said about Flury's. The quality of food somewhat compensates for the price. Everything here comes in epic proportions. The interiors are elegant, the staff are courteous (mostly). 
The breakfast menu of course is famous and though many restaurants now offer similar meals, Flury's remains legendary. It does still deserve a place on the list of "Must Do Things in Kolkata"

One of the iconic restaurant in kolkata known for it's breakfast. We had tried english breakfast with sandwitches,brownie and sundae. The english breakfast with Darjeeling tea and chicken mayonnaise sandwitch tasted good. The chicken mustard sandwitch was not up to the mark. The special flurry's sundae was very expensive and do not feel that worthy.

In simple words a must visit place for breakfast. 
Now my main reason for going to the place was to have cakes and thus went on one Sunday morning. The place was a bit full so had to wait up a bit. While I was confused in which cake to have one of the staff asked me to try an open sandwich before the cake. Hearing from him I just ordered and when it came and after having it I felt very good. To be true nothing to criticise about.
Now abt the cakes the red velvet and the chocolate mousse was just awesome.
The best part in this full case was that I was guided by their staff and yes the staff suggested very good.

Can anyone from Calcutta, say No to this place? I bet not. 

This is an antique ( if I may say so ), yet, most visited joints on any Calcuttan's list. Known for its confectionery and tea-time bites, this place has grown to be one of the best breakfast go-to's, as well. 

It beams of an amazing ambience, and visitors ranging from expats to the movie industry, corporates to lazy vacationers, to you and me. 

My favourite : sit by the window, coffee by the pot & a Peach Melba or two 😄

Note : to savour this place, definitely avoid it during Christmas.

Maybe this place was great in 1927 as a teahouse but it's really pathetic now. Great decor, but really it is a wasted effort. Fresh Pineapple Cream was okay. Apple pie was good. Almond cake disappointed. What was most irritating is that there is an army of waiters roaming around but none can serve water despite requesting multiple times. I don't generally review, but I am forced to put a review sitting at Flurys due to very callous attitude of staff. Over rated. Over priced. Very few items good.

One of the most popular place in Kolkata. Located in park street.. !! As one enters this place , it gives an exotic kind of feeling. The chairs and the chandelier gives that amazing touch to the beautiful ambiance. Especially That pink touch in evrything is such a treat to eye.
As it was sunday afternoon so the crowd was obvious.But the service was somewhere not up to the mark.
Coming to the food. We ordered penne pasta in tomato basil sauce and chicken cheese croissant. The croissant was really good but the pasta didnt taste that great. Overall the ambiance was great and yes pocketfriendly.

Whatta disappointment early in the morning!
The Kolkattans used to fancy this place since its' inception. But now many of us don't recommend this to anyone. Exorbitant prices,pathetic service and unprofessional behavior of the staff- define Flurys in a nutshell.
The club sandwich has lost its' charm. The mutton puff was tasty. The scrambled eggs was good too.
The waiters are absolutely a shame! They are not attentive at all. Even on repetitive requests the food served is delayed. We were absolutely at our wit's end.
Flurys must gear up to stay in the competition with the new restaurants, cafes that are worth a thousand visit. It would not be too long that the Kolkattans would stop thronging their old favorite. The upsurging prices should also be accompanied with a professional conduct.

Visiting Flurys on a Christmas morning is quintessential for a Kolkatan. The age old confectionery chain has consistently won our hearts with their finest pastries and the ambroisial breakfast and lunch platters. Leaving out occasions one can find a huddle of people waiting at the entrance to get a seat. The menu hardly needs an introduction. Order anything (salads, sandwiches, English or Mexican breakfasts, desserts) they'll win your heart and make it long for more!

Well, it was a Sunday morning, so had to wait for 40 minutes for our call. The famous English breakfast was the only purpose. So, placed the order right away. It took quite awhile before the breakfast was served. While the taste of each item on the table was nonetheless really good, a few in our group who had had Scottish breakfast, were a bit disappointed as they had been expecting something on that line since it's called "English breakfast". Anyway, after finishing it off, we ordered some pastries and, yes, those were really good. Maybe, we will visit this place again for their cakes and pastries, but certainly not for their English breakfast.

Five generations of fine confectionery isn't as great as it used to be. Simply because of the service or rather the attitude of the staff which doesn't make you feel that welcome. However, their food remains top notch with Creamy Garlic Mushroom on toast being my favourite. The coffee however seemed a bit off. Still have to give it a 4/5 for its chocolate boat!!

First visit for me. First visit for him. A big deal for both of us! Him, because his city of love.  Me, because I'm chasing 'firsts' and somethings need to be struck off the list..  And sooner the better! 😃
And so, being the quintessential 'Saheb' s in the Bongland, we chose to break our fast this way. Was really surprised to see the place crowded at 10.30 on a weekday. A place for two and food for two followed by a coffee for one.  A bit more attentiveness, smile on the face and the general feeling of you being the royalty were lacking on huge fronts. Struggled to get the order in. Struggled a bit more to get the complete order in. 
I'm glad for the first, but not sure of there will be any second to this.  Compassion, is the need of the hour.

Okay so this is my first negative review! And the reason is purely based on food! No decor , no service, just food! 

We called for the signature flurys non veg club sandwich and a grilled chicken breast with tomato salsa! Both fairly safe and basic items for a popular bakery like Flurys! They were both below average. 
1. Sandwich - it was served cold. the bread was chewy and didn't taste fresh at all. The h and egg filling wasn't great either. Definitely one of the bad sandwiches of my life. 
2. Chicken breast with salsa - the salsa on the breast was good but the chicken again was chewy. All the juices had run out of it. 

Very disappointed with the place. As they say 'With food like that who cares about the ambience'. Could be used both ways, don't you think?

This place is known for its breakfast,  but unfortunately we missed it by half an hr and went ahead to try their Christmas special lunch -  turkeys and chicken. The meat was tad bit overcooked, hence chewy. 
First with the good points -  the desserts out here are yummy,  and whenever I cross Flurys I do stop by to pack something for my home. Well,  coming to the times I stopped to eat here. On my second visit, we ordered from their usual menu -  the bacon lettuce sandwich and it was real good in taste,  and the chips on the side added that extra crunch. 
The coffee is good,  but not so much was their sangria from the Christmas menu. 
Not happy with  the service.  It does take considerable effort to grab their attention for menu to water to the bills. 
The place is beautiful,  and if in Kolkata one should visit this place.  It gives the nice cafe feels. And is quite with a chic look.

Flurys has been a cultural heritage of the city, standing tall in the middle of the food hub of Kolkata- Park Street. Over the years, not only has Flurys maintained the British feel, but also become a legendary place in the list of must-visits. The huge glass window overlooking the door, the high ceiling, the beautiful chandelier, and above all - their amazing collection of pastries, and continental food makes it one of my favourite places to drop by. The special plum cakes and fruit cakes on Christmas, and the ever-so-perfect birthday cakes are no less popular. I have had their legendary breakfast as well - the Egg Benedict is a must try. Service is a little slow on most days, due to the crowd it manages to pack in anytime of the year. But above everything else, I feel the charm of the place lies in the soothing ambiance it manages to provide even among the hustle and bustle of the city.

Flury's for me is a breakfast den since 1991. The Flury's that we know of in those times was unique
 in terms of the quality of service people and their expertise and maturity.

Disappointing.  I looked forward to a nice greasy English Breakfast on New Years. But..tables were dirty as were the cutlery and cruet set. Everything less the eggs was made from frozen packeted stuff : the sausages, bacon, hash browns, baked beans. The toast was cold - probably picked off from a stack of previously made toast. and the butter was frozen. The juice was also canned. Never again thank you. The adjacent Mc D would probably be better!

An overrated place !!
It might be a good hangout place in old days but now it has not maintained the same charisma.
On Thursday, around 9:30-10:00 p.m., me n my family went there, we bought couple of pastries, when we headed toward a table to sit, the guard asked us not to sit in the restaurant area though it was vacant . High chairs near confectionery section were broken and its difficult for an older person (my father) to sit on those chairs. I was very disappointed by this behavior and even in earlier visits, i have noticed that they are not courteous towards customers.

One of my favourite places to eat in Kolkata I.e. I love calling it #Calcutta. Was in Calcutta after 4years.So many things have changed in Kolkata in these many year but Flurys is still the same.. best place for deserts and especially Chocolate Truffle cake. This time I tried Alfredo Pasta and the taste was well balanced. This place started in 1927 and it's 90years now. It's great to see how they have preserved their heritage and have adopted the newest flavours of modern India. Truly at heart #Calcutta

Well! Blake Edwards would have definitely made a Breakfast at Flury's if he was in Kolkata!The Hepburns of Kolkata swear by the name of Flury's for an authentic English Breakfast(you will find it on the menu too!).Bacon, fried eggs, sausage and grilled tomatoes served with bread slices make a wholesome and delicious breakfast and if you are returning after two rounds of jogging in Victoria you could add a few Croissants and pastries to your plate.With a cup of piping hot chocolate, you can sit back and watch the morning passers-by in Park Streek.You will definitely get absorbed in the classy ambiance and soak in the aromas of patties and cakes.I have posed for loads of photographs with the customary white cup with the gold Flury's signature and the legendary photo-studded wall as the backdrop.I call this place Kolkata's Heritage and maybe you too are yet to discover the classic joint!

Tasty food aside, really rude staff. Lord knows why the attitude or why the anger? I usually over look these things, but when a waiter asks you "Why're you sitting on this table for four when you're alone?", Twenty minutes after you've been sitting there and having placed an order, it's stupid. Food was ok, but the service entirely spoilt my experience. Nothing special, not a place with the time.

I was in kol for two days and was searching for good places for breakfast
This was highly recommended 
So i went ahead with this option

Ambience: A beautiful setting with a feeling of an era gone by. I was escorted to a table in the corner area. The view overlooked the street.

Service: i was warmly welcomed inside the space. There is parking available for the vehicle.
The servers are knowledgeable and when i was told that i was looking for a pure veg/ eggless options, i was graciously suggested the same


Food: I ordered a butter croissant along with Cuppacino . It was beautifully crisp and soft. Accompanied with butter and Jam, made me the happiest. It was sooo amazing, i had to order a second serving.


Good place and great experience.
Only thing I missed was more vegetarian options

I visited Kolkata in the last week of December and had to try the oh so famous Flurys. There was a huge line for people to get in and my table was available only after half an hour. So I decide to go to the cafe next door. After half an hour I got my table and ordered for the English breakfast (kept the pork items on hold) the eggs I asked for were not what they got me. But since I had a flight out and many places to sight see on my agenda I continued eating what was served. The grilled tomato was not grilled at all. It seemed more raw than grilled. The coffee I later ordered for was brilliant and gave me right amount of verve to kick start my long day. Overall I didn't enjoy it as much as I was told I would.

This place needs no review. Food is good . Coffee and deserts are great. Cakes are awesome. That is Flurys in a nutshell.
My favorite is Walnut cake.

This place is an icon in itself. Straight at the center of Park Street, it lures both the rich and the poor. I had been to this place many a times to taste its delightful array of bakery items but the breakfast has remained an elusive affair. So when India went against England in the 3rd ODI at Eden Gardens, we made a plan to have our breakfast 1st at Flurys and then head to Eden. On D-Day, which again happened to be a Sunday, we reached the place around 9.30 AM and had a waiting time of around 20 odd minutes. We were a troupe of 8 people so when we asked them to make us seat altogether, the staff was more than happy to oblige. The place was jampacked with people from all age groups, enjoying the different kind of savories.

For ourselves, we majorly ordered the following:
1. English Breakfast
2. Jogger's Breakfast
Both these breakfasts are a wholesome meal. The bacon is the best I have ever had. The sausages are juicier. Not sure why the hash browns in the Jogger's breakfast was bigger than the English's. The egg served is different with the yellow yoke missing in Jogger's. We ordered a fresh watermelon juice and Assam tea to go along with the two breakfasts.
3. Pancakes - Awesome pancake - with butter, syrup and whipped cream. The combination is deadly
4. Sandwiches and Quiches - Best of the lot were the toasted ones.  Crispy and filling.

Even though there was such a rush, the staff was able to serve us quickly. They ensured that we were comfortable. With this kind of service and food, they can only expect their client base to only increase.

This one is my favourite shoppe. 😍
I went with my mom and one of her colleagues to this place. We had Spicy grilled lamb sandwich with cheese melt and Chicken crossiant. Those went delicious. Cappuccino and latte were great! Almond tarts and pretzet were also good. Loved it! ❤

I have been a customer of Flurys for many years; the food remains the same but this time the service was horrendous.

I arrived at the restaurant at around 1 to have some tea and snacks. The restaurant was almost empty. When we asked for a table, we were asked if we were having lunch. An odd question, but we clearly stated that we were having only tea and pastries. The gentleman at the door said that were only serving lunch but he would seat us at a table (Clearly, he had been told that no customer is allowed to sit at a table if they're not eating a meal there and he had to make an exception for us). 

When we sat down, nobody took our order. I went over to the pastry counter and ordered a chicken Patty. When I brought the Patty to the table, a waiter/maitre d' appeared from nowhere. We ordered our tea. He took the order and asked us to move from our table to the standing counter to drink our tea. Because "lunch was being served". 

Flurys is famous for its pastries. To be honest I'm a fan, each time I pass through Kolkata airport, I pick up a big box of pastries to carry back home. But the policy at the restaurant is that I can't have their signature pastries if I'm sitting at their tables, even if the tables are empty. Also they're very comfortable asking me and my guest to shift tables, regardless of our dining experience. 

 I must say the take away counter of flurys at the airport has far better service than the original. Such a shame; I won't be returning again!

There is nothing more I can write what has not already been said that it is a legendary place. 
I would get straight to my food review 

What I had:

:Coronation Chicken Croissant - its a whole meal in itself as the chicken is well cooked and fully loaded in a huge croissant but the taste left a little more to my desire which I had before

:Cream & Mushroom on Toast - a toast sunken under a river of heavy cream and truck load of mushroom. I liked the dish but what made it better was that I ordered for another crisp toast as the sunken one went really soggy

:Mushroom Puff - excellent

:Sprungli Cold Coffee (STAR DISH) - made my day. Absolutely beautifully thick and wonderfully chocolatey. I don't know if they use any Lindt in it but it is brilliant

:Rum Balls - its one of my most favorite pastries there. Whenever I get a chance,I have to have it.

The service again was very poor. We had to remind the servers for cutlery,water,toadt,bills multiple times but then again its Flury's.

This place is iconic enough for people to say directions from this place, bhiya flurys se right. Known for calssic environment and deserts, this visit of mine was also for desserts.

The Brownie was over heated thus burnt, spoiled. The red velvet was fresh but not classy this time, expectations were damn high for red valvet. The coffe eclair tried today was good.
Missing baked alaska but, see you in the menu soon

Iconic. Great ambience creating a buzz of colonial days. Polite but dispassionate wait staffs. Nowadays they are becoming less impersonal though. Hugely expensive place. But you get a different feeling when you dine here. The menu has limited but very delightful options of classic continental cuisine. The english breakfast is a legend- but probably better and cheaper versions are available elsewhere. Here it's around Rs. 600. On my recent visit I tried the omelette with mushroom and cheese fillings-putting me back by some odd 350 rs or so. As much as I try to forget about money and focus on food, I can't forget the pinching of paying 300 rs for a omlette. Sorry for that. My friend had the classical fish and chips. I tasted from her- nothing sublime. But good quality fish fillet no doubt. Also the omelette was huge. I couldn't finish it. Taste was very good. Non oily. 
Cola with ice cream is usually my hot favourite. 
I will continue to visit- if not for the food then just for nostalgia at the very least. 
All are recommended for a visit if their budget permits.

Cant say NO to this place. Flurys is a legacy. You have to be here once when you visit Kolkata. You will find people flocking in here all the time. This place have everything that makes it so special. Right from breakfast to snacks to desserts, it has got everything. The desserts deserve a special mention. Yum food !

Though you have to wait a bit if you are going for breakfast, Flurys makes the wait completely worthy once they start serving the dish. Nice ambience accompanied by great food is that you expect there. Went there on the new year day for breakfast and I am completely satisfied with their food and service.

The breakfast place.. If u are an early riser or have no problem with waiting for a seat this is the place to visit in early mornings for a scrumptious breakfast. Mind you if u r looking for very healthy food u might just be disheartened. 
The best breakfast options are the english and the joggers breakfast. The bacons are just enough crispy on the outside and soft inside to melt inside your mouth. The hashbrowns are again of the same quality. My 5 year old son just loves it, making it an absolute choice for kids. Its not that oily, no spices except for a bit of pepper and oregano, superbly flavoured yet not spicy and non oily. The darjeeling tea is a better choice than english breakfast twinings. It indeed has the flavour of the hills. The coffee is good but a bit on the creamier side. I personally like the creamier one, but not sure of others. 
U can also try the house mayo sandwich, croissants (real fluffy juicy affair)
Finally for the sweet teeth, go and indulge in the legendary  rum balls, mixture of real rum and real chocolate. Remember not to have more than 4 in a single go.

One of those places surviving on the nostalgia factor only. They serve a pathetic joke in the name of English breakfast. 2 strips of soggy bacon, 2 teeny weeny dry as hell sausages, one hash brown and tomato, sickly looking cold eggs, beans straight out of the can and tea bags instead of brewed tea. Add to that terrible service (1 hr to serve food, won't let you sit at tables of your choice even if they are vacant, rude staff). Finally they will slap you with a massive bill (that awful breakfast is Rs 600+). Do yourself a favour and get over the nostalgia and go au bon pain next door if you're thinking of breakfast in the area. 2 only for their bakery which has a reputation of selling stale stuff but I haven't had the misfortune yet.

Honestly speaking I feel people just go here to show off that they had an so called English meal. 
I feel the cakes and pastries they make don't deserve a 5star rating. I had bought a one pound fruit cake for my parents anniversary and found that to be very dry. 
I had asked at their counter whether the cake was fresh, they promptly said yes. This is not the kind of service you expect when you pay 400rs for one cake.

Cult place in Calcutta. Does not need any review for one to visit the place. I have tried their patties and pastries, which satisfies every cell in my body. 
Just one complaint though, I ordered 1 pound birthday cakes twice from here, both times the cake being eggless. They made it and madde my decision right. Though on the third time suddenly they said ''For eggless the cake has to be minimum 3 pounds''

Loss of memory I guess.

For me, "Flurys" is a place where all the staffs fly around it will take some time to catch a hold of them... may be you can catch them after calling them twice or thrice to place the order...
If you are in search of menucard, they will give you one menucard consisting of the starters main course and the deserts...
I don't know whether or not they have the menucard for drinks...
The glasses will be provided empty and you have to ask for water otherwise the glasses will remain empty...
If you order any pastries they will serve it along with fork and knife, no spoons will be provided... if you ask for spoon you'll get it after 15 mins and that too if the staff (to whom you have asked for spoon) remembers...
If you want seat for two people and going to have a lumsum amount of food there will be scarcity of space on the table as only 3-4 plates can fit in there... if you are not yet done with one dish and another one comes in, and if there is no place left to keep that, the staff won't mind keeping it on your head...
Coming to food now...
We had ordered Darjeeling tea, two pastries, white sauce pasta with veggies, golden fried prawns, club sandwich and one sundae... and I'm not going to complain about any of the food items, each of the items was extremely delicious and mouth watering... So full marks on food...
Lastly, this oldest pillar of park street though maintaing its tradition with the quality of foods but is getting rusted with the vice of peacockery.. Sarbani Bagchi

Flurys needs no introduction... It's standing like a Piller showing the rich history of kolkata or Park Street. Now we can see some wings of it but the huge giant size building says it all about Flurys. Love to eat a lazzy morning breakfast here grabbing a seat just by the windows. The puffs, pastries, breakfast platter, coffee, tea everything has it's blend of freshness and well-known stories.
I strongly recommend my friends to visit here and try the breakfast platter... And if you can still find out a little place then try out chocolate pastries. I'm sure you will fall in love and come back again and again...

Note: I have tried breakfast mostly here so not well aware about the other meals.
Little costly but every bite you take, worth that price...

Me and my Wife went for Dinner at Flurys as on Dec 24, 2016 midnight. Before entering to the restaurant, we asked, are they serving dinner or not and they said, "Yes". 

So we ordered from their special menu for Rs. 950 inclusive of beverage, non-veg main dish and dessert and grilled chicken steak served with grilled vegetables.

Bad experiences as follows:
1# they served all items after an hours.
2# The juice was nothing special, it was a regular THIRD GRADED canned orange juice (already fermented and bad smelling)  served with rotten apple mini-pieces.
3# Main dish was OKAY.
4# We asked for a Pudding from the combo but they tried to serve us simple choco lava cake and that also served after 2 hours without seeking for our PERMISSION.

Overall, this was the WORST EXPERIENCE in Flurys. I will never ever put my foot there and even I will highly NOT GOING TO RECOMMEND to Anyone.

SHAME ON YOU GUYS.

This place has been always nostalgic for people from Kolkata. Whoever today I was shocked to see the arrogance of the management.
Went for high tea with my mother so that we could have some pastry and other savouries such as party etc. But the Stewart had the audacity to say that he cannot provide table because we were not taking main course.
They have forgotten the flurry name is synonymous to fine tea shop and not a restaurant. They have chosen to become a main stream run of the mill restaurant.

So this iconic cafe lived up to the hype. The legend is true. It should be on your hitlist when you visit Calcutta. The service, ambience and quality of ingredients used is all top class. Order everything that has 'H' on the side depicting that it is a heritage dish of the cafe. Further the in-house bakery offers you a wide variety of options to satiate your sweet tooth.
Recommended : Bean with Toast, Eggs Benedict, Belgian Mocha, Chocolate Boat, Chocolate Short Bread

We heard a lot about this place being an old and famous joint before visiting the city of joy, but this fine morning  we visited the restaurant and the ambiance seemed good but half of the breakfast items were not available from their menu, so somehow we ordered from the rest of the stuff and then the nightmare started when they took 50-60 minutes just for serving espresso, forget about the breakfast.  You can't expect someone to wait 60 minutes for their morning coffee and then behave like an unapologetic lying douche.  I don't write bad reviews for one bad day at a joint but this was very much needed after their pseudo egoistic handling of the issue.  Hope to never visit such low life place in my life.

31st December anywhere in and around Park Street calls for a long queue followed by waiting at the table for your food. But, we were lucky enough to get a table within five minutes of penning down our names in the waiting list. 
Flurys being one of the many famous names in Park Street is quite easy to locate: right next to Au Bon Pain(now) or Music World(then). 
Coming to the food, we ordered for one Christmas Stuffed Chicken, one Chicken Steak and two Christmas Cakes. The order took quite sometime to come. No complaints since it was 31st and the area was jam packed with people. The food was delicious and filling. And so, was the cake - any plum cake fans would absolutely love it. 
The staff were helpful and well coordinated. The crowd comprised of mostly families - joint and nuclear - enjoying their last meal of the year. The ambience was different when compared to other restaurants of the area - Flurys were playing their own set of Christmas carols.
The bill was on the higher side and cost us 1600 inclusive of taxes.

But I must say that the management lill bit poor. Because of 25th December there was a huge crowd gathered. They were unable to provide seats for two where  the two seats were available. I think its a pressure of festive season. I want to be there on non festive days

The place was always amazing. Its renovation resulted in a significant price hike, but it still continues to attract visitors from Calcutta and abroad. It is still authentic. It is still beautiful. Iconic location. Old Calcutta feel. The food is good, nothing great. Pastries are delicious. Their typical chicken patties requires an acquired palate, and is historically a must-try. Sadly, they have done away with the cake-tray and their popular chicken sandwich has degraded in quality. I recommend 
#Any sugar topped pastry 
#Chicken Patties (filling comprises non-spicy steamed Chicken mashed with bread)
#Lemon Tart

Morning dates lead to breakfast cravings and this place is a no brainer, specially on Christmas Eve mornings! 
I have been here more times than I can remember and it is a special place to me, with lots of childhood memories associated with it. 
It was my date's first time and I had said so many good things about it to him, I was actually a bit nervous. I'd be disappointed if he didn't like it as much as I do. 
There was a longish queue outside and we had to wait a good 45 mins before we got a table but the wait was worth it. 
I had the jogger's breakfast and he ordered the eggs benedict. The food was brilliant and more importantly, consistent. The only thing I was a bit confused about was the lack of green tea on my table. The joggers breakfast is supposed to come with juice AND green tea. But none was served. Minor thing. I didn't ask the waiting staff because they had a lot on their plate already. 
Although the place was packed with people, the service was patient, something not very easy when there's a mad amount of people still waiting outside. We were not rushed and spent more than a few hours inside, just chatting and leisurely enjoying our breakfast which slowly turned to brunch. 
The Christmas decorations were very easy on the eyes and I was happy to see a gingerbread house. 
Overall it was just as I had thought it would be, which for this place means perfect.

Flurys has been an Integral part of childhood and college life... even now it is a part of the must visit when I am in Kolkata. 
My all time favorite is the barbecue chicken wing... it's one of the best I have eaten. I also enjoy their honey mustard chicken. Even though it's known for cakes... honestly I am not a very big fan of their cakes. 
The service is slow ...as usual.. and the servers are rude at times. This has always been the case. 
But still this place has a charm of its own... and a visual to kolkata is not complete without a visit to flurys.

Flurys the legendary tearoom on fashionable Park Street in Kolkata was founded in 1927 by Mr and Mrs J Flurys. Presenting fine European traditional confections, it had soon become a popular meeting place for all ages. It introduced the city and many generations to authentic Swiss and International delicacies. Breakfast served here are just stupendous and will never put one down.
We ordered for baked beans on toast , tuna panini , chicken croissant , cheese omlette and cold coffee.
Each and every item packed a punch of their own flavours. We were just awwstruck by the quality of food here. Another thing which was big tick in the box was the ambiance.It gave a feel of the english era.
Good service, sumptuous food , great ambiance and reasonable pricing...what more can one ask for.
Highly recommended for everybody!

Flurys at Christmas, the best you can ever have! The ambience is really nice quite calm. 
Strawberry cube - It was soft & fresh. Tasted so good not at all like ordinary strawberry pastry. 
Chocolate boat - not exactly sure about what it was. Kinda like a cookie base shaped in boat & choco glaze on top of that. Tasted fine. 
Blueberry cheesecake - it was the last piece they had & I feel so lucky I could get that. It was like heaven in my mouth melted as soon as u eat. Really delicious 😍. Wish could have more 😕

Enter this iconic joint and your sure to be transported back in time, such is Flurys' old school charm and aura!
Over to the food (lunchtime), great portions and decent taste sums it up. An enormous veg club sandwich, huge chicken croissant, chicken wings and a chicken stroganoff make do for three folks. However, a great cold coffee and an equally delightful chocolate eclair were the highlight of our meal.

The service though, leaves a lot to be desired. Specifically, the lack of prompt service or, the eagerness to help.

End note: When in Kolkata, go visit, for the great collection of pastries and its 1927 charm.

Christmas at Flurys really is a treat. The best thing which stands out about this place is the ambience. Well let me cover the points in the usual sequence. The prim, proper and inviting atmosphere that welcomes you to this place just gets warmer during this time of the year. I also must commend the management for handling larger crouds pretty well, which i have found lacking at some places (read my other reviews for details. Cheap publicity of my reviews, right? :P). Well anyway, the ambience inside is wonderful. The lights, decoration, the music...all of them are unique beautiful bits in themselves, that together contribute to one magnificent and picturesque experience that remains as an eternal, magnificent painting in your mind. The service however, was a bit lacking at certain areas. Though the waiters were really helpful (and spoke better English than many people, and that's really an important thing to a grammar nazi like me), it was pretty obvious that they were struggling a bit to manage the busy restaurant. Yes they do try to make up for it with their mannerisms and behaviour, however there is room for improvement. Now we had ordered from the Christmas special menu as well as the regular menu, and the food was pretty good as expected from this place. I shall heavily recommend the cordon bleu (learn to pronounce it people) if you are visiting this place. It was an absolute delight, with all the right flavours falling in just the right places. And if you're visiting during Christmas, do try the Turkey. And the hot chocolate - one word: bliss!! No further comments required on that. Well to finish it off, i'm sure most would agree that, Christmas at Park Street is special; and Flurys, with all its elegance, just elevates that experience manifold.

What an ambience! Visiting Flurys that too during Christmas is so delightful, English Breakfast sounds exciting, looks tempting and tastes amazing , fresh watermelon juice was a perfect match with it ! French Toast was buttery and yummy ! Background supported with Christmas decorations and carols was the only reason we waited for a cup of coffee for 30 mins & the coffee wasn't good , it was too strong ! We didn't regret our wait because of the lovely ambience ! The only reason I'm not giving a 5/5 rating is that i find flurys overpriced !

Over rated and bad service! Would have given negative rating, if possible. When we arrived, we were told that there was waiting. After about 20 mins, we got a table and that is when the actual waiting began! None of the waiters meet your eye, and the only way to get their attention would be to stand up and shout and wave. After trying to get their attention for 10 mins, and then asking 3 times, we got the menu card! What an achievement!  We then ordered the grilled chicken with salsa and corden bleu chicken (stuffed with cheese and deep fried).  We were told that it would take 30 mins. After  15 mins we were told that salsa was not available and would mushroom sauce do instead ? After another 20 mins the food arrived, and there is just one way to describe it - horrible and almost inedible. The chicken (both preparations) were so   tough we had to literally have a battle with it. Taste was mediocre.  Our ordeal was still not over. After trying to catch the attention of the waiters for 10 mins, my husband lost his patience and we went up to the counter to pay our bill and walked out most disappointed and disgusted!

The first thing which comes into my mind when I hear this name FLURYS, is the leagcy of bekary and cakes in the park Street area.

Location: I mean I guess this segment just need no words, it is at the heart of the park Street, just beside the place where music world used to b there.

Environment: okay, this place is pretty congested and crowded. And when you visit this on Xmas week this would be the obvious thing.

Now coming to the food. We went their for the special lunch for the Xmas:

Main course 
_________________

♣ Traditional roast turkey with all trimming:  have tried turkey for the first time.  Amazing in taste. Serverd with veggies and chipolata sausage. Tossed in cranberry sauce. (Took it 2 times)

♣ Stuffed chicken breast with mushroom reduction: very very good in taste , served with veggies and smashed potato.
All are continental served with bread and butter.
Desert 
____________

♠ Flurys special Xmas pudding: fantastic in taste.  It's served with caramel custard.

♠ Warm choclate and whiskey lava cake: a pure delight. Just heavenly in taste.

♠ Warm pannetone pudding: I didn't like it. Didn't like the taste at all.

Beverages 
_________________

♠ Ice tea: just superb , very very refreshing.
♠ Sangria: they served the port wine. Didn't like it much.( Took it 2 times)

Overall a nice experience. You would not have any thing to tell to a legacy started in 1927. We just went there to be a part of legacy.

Price is always on higher side here. All cost 3450 for 3 heads.

But yes a great experience on the Xmas week. :) Cheers!!!!

Over-rated because of its vintage and legendary status. Forget the food, this place needs lessons on customer centricity , behaviour and customer focus. 
The customer interaction is managed by the security guard who is quite curt and has his own yardsticks (known to him and the flurrys mgmt) and decides who needs to be responded to. 
Coming from Mumbai on a vacation , visited this place. Typically dressed in casuals , me and my brother Went there the first day for deserts at 3:15 approx. As I attempted to enter, The security guard very curtly used his judgemental skills to say - Not here for food? U then don't get a place to sit. U can try your luck at the bakery section and see if they serve you anything! I peeped in and could clearly see people clad in blazers were enjoying tea only. Still, Giving benefit of doubt that they would not have meant offence, we went there the next day at 4 PM for deserts again. This time, the security guy again stopped me and said - No place. There is waiting.At the same time, I could see a complete change in tone when he responded to another guest (foreigner and hence, may deserve a different treatment as per flurrys policy) and it irked me. 
I asked him on approx time it may take or call the manager. He sternly said - Can't predict, decide if you want to wait . When he realised I am not moving, he said 20 mins. Do you still want to wait? 
By that time, I was so irritated that I decided to make a move anyways.
TAKEAWAYS :- Horrible customer behaviour , need to understand the changing customer dynamics and age-group better if they are looking to survive in this changing world.

This place has it's own charm. Must try the chicken and ham omelette. My favourite us the Hot Chocolate with Whipped Cream. People going there for the first time can try out the English breakfast. The chicken and cheese grilled sandwiches were also yummy. The triple layered chocolate pastry, which I tried for the first time was also great. Guys just go to Flurys if you live here or are here to visit the place :)

I came here with my family on 26th December. Had to wait for a long time to get inside.. Waiter came after 15 minutes.. Then the order came after 40 minutes. We got the bill after 25 minutes of asking for it. They took the bill after we repeatedly asked for it. Cannot understand what these waiters do. They are so slow. If you have time, go. If you are in any hurry, do not go.

This place has such a lovely vintage vibe to it. Absolutely delightful! Went in for a quick dessert post dinner. Ordered for a red velvet cake and some baba cake. The sponge was very heavy and thick. Nothing like the modern day, light and fluffy ones. So slightly disappointed there. Service was almost negligible. If you are here for a proper meal, they will attend you well. The moment you say you are here to grab a quck bite or maybe a pickup, you are on your own. Search your table, get your food, suggest menu items to yourself 😂. I guess it was worse than Candies (bandra, mumbai), in terms of grabbing the server's attention. They work at their own sweet little pace and choose to ignore you completely, for as long as they want!

A foodie landmark of Kolkata. This confectionery cum restaurant is situated at the starting of the park Street and is a must visit for their breakfast menu and pastries. There is always a waiting of minimum an hour but the food is worth the wait. We had their English breakfast -fried eggs with crsipy bacon and deliciously soft chicken sausages accompanied with crunchy hash browns, a grilled tomato and some sautéed mushrooms with bread. The quantity is good enough for two people. We finished our breakfast with their black coffee and cold coffee with ice cream. Since we also wanted to taste their famous rum ball we had that too along with their chocolate short bread and both were perfect and yummy. Not at all expensive looking at quality and quantity. Service is professional.

Hyped. Overhyped. 
Legendary because of its age and coordinates, def not because of the way most of their desserts taste. Boxer's Day, and these are the only 3 desserts available. Can't believe we had to leave some on the plate and walk out.
Still, sentimental attachment would always be with the place.

The chill in the wind suggested that the holiday season is upon us, and we decided to celebrate. We went in only to find out that regular menu won't be working for the season. There's a special menu and we should order from there. After waiting a while we got in,  and ordered GRILLED 8 OZ. PORK CHOPS WITH MAPLE GLAZE, PAN SEARED STUFFED CHICKEN BREAST WITH RED WINE AND MUSHROOM REDUCTION, FLURYS SPECIAL CHRISTMAS PUDDING and WARM CHOCOLATE AND WHISKY LAVA CAKE. 
The Pork Cops did not disappoint. It was a Rib Chop served with a bacon rice and veggies. The smoked bacon bits added texture to the rice. The sauteed vegetables were delicious, especially the corn. The glaze was a pineapple sauce. Coming to the pork, the fat was rendered, and the piece was charred to the perfect amount. The sweetness of the sauce worked beautifully in elevating the dish. 
The chicken was served with some vegetavles and Dauphinoise potato. The chicken was cooked well, although cut a little thick, it was delicious. The reduction worked well with the dish.
The Pudding was the thick Christmasy cakey one, and was enjoyable.
The Chocolate lava cake was decadence personified. It was a sticky, chocolaty sinful platter. This is a must try at Flurys. 
I'll be back soon, for breakfast this time! :P :)

I'm embarrassed to admit that after 27 years in Kolkata this was the first Christmas morning that I spent in Flurys and though we had to wait outside for approximately 30 minutes, the experience was completely worth it!

We had English breakfast, American pie , choco truffle pastry and chocolate ice cream and each item was absolutely delicious. The bacon strips perfectly complemented the sweetness of the pie dipped in honey. The chicken sausage was fresh and sumptuous. The hash brown was not too oily and the mushrooms were well cooked. The chocolate ice cream was the best I have had in a long time and the taste continued to linger long afterwards. Overall, Flurys completely deserves the hype that surrounds it. The only con is that the service is a bit slow and you have to put a lot of effort to gain the attention of the service staff.

Flurys has a systemic issue - it is a victim of its own success. It doesn't have the space or operational know-how to manage crowds. It relies on a certain target group with disposal income and a taste for class. However, the same TG sees through its idea to have people wait at the bakery for a bit before the table is set, in the hope of patrons ordering pastries before sitting for the meal. Or maybe its an honest attempt to keep themselves close to their roots, or what made them famous, the bakery menu. I'm inclined to stick to the former because of the subsequent lower-than-average interaction quality with the staff once we finally got a table. Food is average too. Honestly, I got an impression that Flurys is like a Page 3 personality - famous for being famous, there's nothing more to it.Flurys can do better, especially with a couple of competing bakeries growing in vicinity with the same concept.

Christmas celebration is incomplete without a visit to park street and a drop in at Flurys. The long snaking lines for the Christmas cakes speaks volumes of their legacy. We tried out the Christmas special menu. We ordered pan seared chicken and parmesan crusted basa. Both were pretty palatable options, the chicken being a little too sweet for my taste buds. I thoroughly enjoyed the fish however especially the side of mash it was accompanied by. We finished off our meal with a traditional Christmas pudding.

Honestly the food here is amazing.  They even made one of the best Irish breakfasts I have tasted since arriving in India.  However, the staff and management is the true let down.  They had tables empty and made us wait for over 30 minutes at the bakery bar stools.  When they finally gave us seats it was the same empty ones that still hadn't been filled.  I also ordered a capuccino from the very start (since I knew it would take a long time).  However,  I only received it after I finished my Irish breakfast.   I'm only writing this review because I believe Flurys has great potential but time management and orders needs to be improved first. 
 
I would come again for the food but definitely not the service!

This review will be based on my multiple experiences with in Flurys, Park Street. I had been to this joint on a lot of occasions, ranging from morning breakfast to random cakes and coffee in the late evening. The interior designing looks absolutely stunning, with the chandelier being the best part of the entire decoration. The prices are a little bit high but dont let that bother you. Breakfasts are absolutely tasty and i am in love with the cakes they sell here. Classic and good. Hoping to come back here soon.

Been here only once and experience was not upto the mark...Staff behavior was not friendly but too formal... I loved the chocolate pastry that I tried out anda coffee...wow it was damn expensive...they have too many things on the offering but for a normal guy it becomes quite expensive....Ambience is quite good but you cannot count everything on ambience...I find the Flury outlets better than this place as they charge comparatively less...the taxes charged here is also quite high...

My recommendations if you have not visited before just try out once first because of its long laid history of being one of the oldest Bakery Joints of Kolkata....

An iconic joint in Kolkata. 
Ambience is fairly laid back but the service is too formal and at times, not so friendly. I was asked to sit at the bar stool instead of a table because I had ordered only pastries. It was 830 pm in a weekday and there were precisely 5 people in the whole place. 
I've tried many of their baked goodies on multiple occasions. Their baba cake is quite nice, so is their Paris Brest.
Overall, a must visit place,not only for the legend quotient but also for a good cup of coffee and some nice baked treats :)

Extremely painful experience at a place which promised so much. The Service is horrid, biased and the staff need to learn to acknowledge the customers. Went to the place twice in a span of 24hrs. First time around just to get a taste of their 'famous' bakery spread. The Baba cake tasted good but not something I would write home about, the Almond cube was different and the brownie was.. well a brownie. The plum cake I bought and took home. let's see how that turns out. Usual stuff. Order taking and Service took a long time. I wrote that up to it being a busy Saturday evening. Done with. 

But the rating of 1 is based on the joke of a Continental breakfast and the absolute mismanagement of the place. We were a group of 6 and had heard an awesome lot about Breakfast@Flury's. It was a horrible experience. First the long wait to get a table. We could see empty tables inside but the people were kept waiting outside to add to the 'hype' of the place, probably. A guard was posted at gate to manage the waiting while none of the restaurant personnel inside were interested in managing the crowd. Moreover people who muscled their way in on random excuses were seated while we waited and waited our turn for over 1.5 hours. Ultimately one of our group had to go inside and gave the Manager 'Shourto' a piece of his mind. We were about to walk away from the place when voila, we get seated alongwith another group of 6 who had been waiting. Space creation must be magic @Flury's.
But that wasn't the end of it. We all had flights to catch and requested the attending staff 'Pratul' to take our orders while the table for us was being cleaned. The answer -'NO'. First you sit, only then will they take the order. We just looked at each other and sat down. Finally order taken and waiting for food. 
Two of us requested that the eggs in our Continental breakfast be fully fried and not Sunny side up. Out of 6, 4 were halfway through their food before the fully fried egg breakfasts made an appearance... And that too after repeated reminders. 
Now this is the masterpiece by Mr. 'Pratul'. On requesting that the remaining two orders be brought out, he says that just to fully fry two eggs we can't hold up all the other orders. Makes no sense. Probably they need a serious lesson on how to make a fully fried egg... Just flip the egg...  Does not take 20 minutes. 

As for the food, nothing special, had better. 

Now the cherry on the plum cake I bought from them. The cake had a STONE in it. I have no words to even express how I feel right now.

NEVER recommending Flury's to anyone for ANYTHING. EVER. 
Rant over.

Interesting place and location is quite central with is surrounded by other high top end restaurant. I would give them hip hip hurray as they are one of best place to have cakes and pastries. I have tried couple of them when I was roaming on park street and found it quite nice and tasty. Staff behavior, lets not go there as I really dont care about the obnoxious ones and they usually discourage ppl to have small meals, quite sad. But then its all about good food. Anytime recommended for short meals like breakfast and deserts.

Again, partly retaining that old British charm, rest evolved with time, here's another foodies delight flury's. This is a place where we spent hours with a pot of tea and brownies, reading, teasing. 
Today I visited this place after ages. 12 to 3 pm is strictly for lunch now, still they allowed us to get in and head for the pattiserie section , for self service only. We ordered for a red velvet cake and also got the candle and knife , right there, to celebrate my aunt's birthday. Thanks to M , we got all the things needed to celebrate the birthday there. It will always remain a place in my 'must visit' list whenever, I am in  Calcutta.

We had ordered darjeeling tea n cappuccino as well. Both tasted inferior compared to other joints in kolkata.

Flurry's has that authentic ambience that they used to have in the earlier 50’s 60’s after the renovations. The moment you enter the bakery you get that sweet smell of breads and cakes.. They have added heritage dishes to their menu which is actually great. I ordered Flurry’s Viennese coffee from the heritage list and that was too great!!! The Sandwiches are awesome and so are their cakes. This is a great place for the people having sweet tooth. 

In short loved the place…!!!  :) Cheers

Today it was my first visit to flurys. It is one of the legendary bakery of Kolkata and it was in my wish list since long. The service was really slow and somehow biased. They would pay attention to you if are in a big group. We had 
a piece of rich chocolate dome - a dome of chocolate mousse
Cheesecake slice- it was really tasty.

They have added heritage dishes to their menu which is actually great. I ordered Flurry’s Viennese coffee from the heritage list and that was too great!!! The Sandwiches are awesome and so are their cakes. This is a great place for the people having sweet tooth. 

In short loved the place…!!!  :) Cheers

Today it was my first visit to flurys. It is one of the legendary bakery of Kolkata and it was in my wish list since long. The service was really slow and somehow biased. They would pay attention to you if are in a big group. We had 
a piece of rich chocolate dome - a dome of chocolate mousse
Cheesecake slice- it was really tasty.

This is situated in the heart of the city i.e. Park street. The place is always crowded. You can get good breakfast their and the pastries are really good. The price is on the higher side. Recommended

I wish I could rate it a 0. I had expected better of this renowned bakery, the pastries were dry, the waiters was rude. There was nobody to even clean the tables. Such terrible pastries that even the dog outside the cafe refused to have it.

Ordered a 1 pound FRESH Fruit Pineapple Cake, the delivery was good and was within time. However the word FRESH was only a word used by Flurys. The Fruits were stale and it smelt really bad when we opened the cake. 
Just wondering how come a branded and a renowned shop can sell items like this!!!

Had high hopes when my daughter and I went to Flury's on Park Street Kolkata but the good and dessert really disappointed us. The service was terrible. No one around to take the order, give extra water, bring bill. I know it's a laid back city but people also want to eat and leave! Also it would have been nice if they had asked if we wanted less spicy food as the server cd see there was a child who was eating an arrabiata pasta. Disappointed

Well, we went on Wednesday evening and ordered Veg. Pasta, Tea and Hot Chocolate.
The Pasta was raw and we complained to the waiter.
The Waiter apologized and brought in new semi-cooked dish of Pasta.. we were in a hurry so asked for bill. 
The restaurant had added 2 plates Pasta quietly to the bill. Being in a hurry , we didn't realize the forgery by the restaurant . 

Serving semi-cooked and raw food to customers and billing them to pay twice for the cook's mistake . Thankfully, I realized later on how the restaurant functions .

This was the second time I'd been to Flurys. The food was just as good. The English breakfast was a treat to my tongue. This is one of the few places that actually knows how to prepare chicken sausages, they weren't hard and weren't too soft either. The Bacon was as good as it gets. The egg could have been slightly better. The pancakes were a little disappointing. I just wish Flurys would incorporate Waffles into their menu. Service was top class. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone, especially those like me who love European breakfast.

So yeah like most of the other normal citizen I went here to have some beautiful delicacy food , as I have heard about it. I went out with my friend today afternoon and I can't believe my eyes , there hospitality was so discriminating .......I don't know for what reason. They made us seat in a corner where the chair got dumped. I mean seriously this kind of behavior is incredible and unexpected from such a legendary place. After all behaviour matters the most! Should hire some better staff members for hospitality. Food was tasteless as the hospitality sucks!!!!!! Thanks!

Welll they say Flurys & Kolkata are synonymous people rave about their bakery products, chocolates and whatnot. Well my experience has not been very encouraging and two times. First time I just blamed it to my difficult day and let it pass but this time a friend informed me that I can't form opinions about Flurys or for that matter any place by visiting once. I must give him a chance to redeem his favourite jaunt. 
Well he is right , and here I went braving traffic on a Wednesday evening hoping my friends set expectations are lived up to. 
Well here I was disappointed again , grossly disappointed . There are enough staff members looking around mostly angrily or unpleasantly, forget about service they were frowning. The property is good at a prime location but the upkeep was horrible. The table was dirty and toilets were horribly unclean .
Well may be they need to improve their facility ambience, and may be the food is it's spirit.  Grossly wrong I was when k was served a club sandwich which was grilled but cold, fresh lime was just as bad and cappuccino pastry little sour. All in all a bad very bad experience. I have no reasons to come back

This place is okish with rude staff. I went there with my wife and asked for a table for breakfast. The staff was not at all hospitable. Even though there were many empty tables I was denied place. While eating they shifted me to a different place. Overall the food was okish. I feel there are better eatries around.

It wasn't possible that I come to Kolkata and not eat at the iconic flurys. We went here for what they do best desserts. We took a rum ball, baba cake and chicken and mushroom quiche. The quiche was just ok but what was superb were the two desserts. The baba cake is this dense sponge with loads of tutty fruity and nuts and just the right amount of sweet. The rum ball is like Christmas in your mouth, soft, gooey and a great kick of rum. I am not a big rum ball fan but am.now a big fan of flurys rum ball. This is one thing I will keep coming back for. Must try.

You know when one uses a lot of combinations to make it taste right and when the combination of some methods work and you know thats how they obtain the flavours and make the food taste so desirable! This keeps on happening until they gain experience and expertise! They here are the chefs who toil so hard to make the recipe tempting enough.. So Mr & Mrs Flury found this small tearoom in 1926 and named it Flurys.. Twas well known for cakes, creamy pastries and perhaps the best Swiss chocolates! They are able to retain the quality till date.. Leme start the gupshup
It is located in the most fashionable street of Kolkata, i.e. Parkstreet! This place is always full with elite guests.. So is the Ambience.. gives it a European feel.. the gigantic chandelier with crystals shining as if its necklace! 
So i went there with my family for Breakfast.. Yes Breakfast at Flurys! Here's what we ordered:
Creamy Garlic Mushroom on Toast: The toast was lying in the puddle of white sauce creamy garlic mushroom! Mushroom fans must try this dish! Its my favourite! Quite a Stunner!
Beans on Toast: Same as above only difference being red sauce and baked beans! It was okayish for me! 
Clubs Sandwich with Cheese: Three layered toasted cheesy sandwich full of veggies! Yum twas!
Double Expresso: Coffee always goes well with the English breakfast! And this cafe complimented well!
Signature Coffee: This was tasting more like a filtered cafe.. so if one has a taste for it then do go for it!
Strawberry Qube: I love this pink coloured pastry.. somehow instills in me the childlike me.. it is attractive atleast for me and i love the creamy flavours!
The chefs are experience holders when it comes to serving good food and no wonder this place runs crazy! The staff are courteous and royal! However, i found this place priced high.. it is an expensive place to be.. Even if they are good at it, it really burns ones pocket and one has to think twice given the price! Anyways, Flurys is ideally best for breakfasts! Please do share your flurys stories.. Thanks!

"Flurys has got a wide variety of pastries". That is what I had heard from my friends since school days, when a Flurys outlet opened near our school. But my dad said that the park street outlet is more famous for the breakfast than its pastries; which is actually true for the rest of the outlets. To prove his point, he took me and my mom to Flurys for a gala breakfast. And probably that was the best breakfast I had since birth. The wide variety of food, the sausages, the pancakes, the pastries, the coffee and even the staffs! Everything was too good. If you haven't had stopped by flurys for a breakfast, you have no idea what a grand breakfast feels like. The only glitch in this fairy tale meal is the pocket pinch. Spending 2.5 grands for the breakfast of 3 people will give you an idea of the price scale.

Flurys....the iconic tea room on Park Street has been around from the time I can recall ( it's been there since my childhood) and I've grown up with it always there. There was a time when birthday cakes were either from Flurys or from Nahoums ( in new market). Flurys was the more expensive place while Nahoums was the cheaper option.vThere weren't many other options unlike the present times when one is spoilt for choice.( with so many outlets with cakes). 
Nostalgia.....plays a big role in rating Flurys, for undoubtedly I simply love it. The baked beans on toast I love to have here for old times sake. Also their old typical pastries, square shaped with icing on top...standard Flurys.The pistachio pastry is good as are their baba cakes. They have added many new items but I simply love going there for the old stuff and to relive old times.....Ah Nostalgia!😃

Flurys is a Kolkata landmark, an institution. And I hear it’s a decent bakery and dessert parlour too. As a restaurant, specifically where breakfast is concerned, it leaves much to be desired. Expecting so much from the endless reviews and recommendations, my father’s more than anyone’s (although not Indian, he spent ‘the best years of his youth’ in Calcutta in the swinging 50’s and 60’s), I was totally disappointed – totally.

This review is based only on the red velvet cake that had been pre- ordered!
It was a two tiered (layered) cake with flowers on top specially ordered for an engagement.It looked amazing.Texture wise it was simply the best! Velvety outside but melts when put inside mouth...but somehow the cream tasted a little coconuty. Had the undesirable extra taste of coconut not been there it would have been one of the finest red velvet cakes that I have tried! Also the flowers on top were excessively sweet for human consumption!
Overall being an ardent Flurys fan I wouldn't say it's their best product!

I ordered a Chocolate biscuit and Monalisa Slice to-go. They were as usual delicious. I had a bit of a trouble cutting through the tough pieces of the biscuits on top of these pastries though. I'm a big fan of the buttercream they use in their pastries. The cream and the biscuit went very well together. Each of these delicacies were very heavy on my stomach. So if you have one of them with tea/coffee I'm guessing it will keep you full for a good 4 hours atleast. That was basically my breakfast. It is always a pleasure picking delicious pastries and cakes (can't wait for the Christmas fruit cakes!!!) and/or sitting down for a cup of coffee or tea.

went there in search for eggs benedict which was unavailable.
their people dont know for sure anything. one said it wont be available for the whole day, another said it is available only in the morning and evening.
so, we packed two pastries- 1) apple blueberry pie cake 2)chocolate mousse , because they dont allow people to sit on the tables available, even if it is empty just because their pastries are on the self-service counter. we thought of ordering some lunch but such poor service is not expected. maybe it was some misunderstanding, but anyways the pastries were good.

Ordinary bakes and extraordinary fakes.. Been there around afternoon with my wife and occupied a seat. Had heard a lot of this place so started looking at the menu card. We were immediately interrupted by the waiter that the seats are allowed only for lunch . We were ushered to a corner in a very distasteful manner even when all the tables were empty. The corner reminded us of separations created to keep the poor away from the rich. We still went ahead and ordered pasteries and beverage. We din't find it any better. Overall a very sour experience of a place expected to serve sweet memories (pun intended)

Flurys is iconic to Calcutta, those who have never visited Calcutta also know of flurys and that's how big the legacy of flurys is. 

Went there for Saturday breakfast and I have no regrets, went ahead with the British breakfast which had 2 hash browns, 3 rinds of bacon, mushrooms, tomatoes, 2 chicken sausages and 2 fried eggs. Topped it off with a sprungli shake, which you shouldn't miss whenever you go to flurys next. 

Overall, amazing food, service was slightly down on this visit, but it can be glanced over cause of the quality of food.

Flurys has been around about as long as Independent India! It's got anything you'd search for in Paris, Manhattan , ZURICH or London, but better! Great croissants, Cheese Quiche, Eggs Benedict and American Pancakes ( if you speak with a Texan's drawl?). My partner loves the French toast, even though he's been to Paris! I like the Tomato, Ham and Mozzarella Cheese Sandwiches that are just like the ones prepared in Harvard Square in the 60's.
Even if you don't speak with a twang or Parisian accent, you'll be welcome there from 7:30 in the morning right through the day!

Flurys is the essence of Park Street. It is one such place that will continue thriving even in the face of armageddon (I went a bit overboard :-p). In all seriousness, everyone knows Flurys and the heritage it carries with its name. The question is: Is this hype worth it?

I had ordered their ever so famous English breakfast along with a Belgian mocha with cream. Quite honestly, the food was great but nothing that can't be prepared easily at home. The coffee was really good and I enjoyed every sip of it. 

The place is expensive, no doubt about that. A bit overrated too, but no one can deny its importance here in Kolkata. If you are in the city, visit it.

Heard a lot about this place so went for breakfast. The food was very okay. The ambience was very slow. Firstly, they service was slow. And when the food came, it was already cold. Ordered for the mushroom and corn toast. Wasn't as good as it was hyped. The sandwich however, it was some exotic one, which turned out to be really good. The chilli cheese omelette was super. The coffee wasn't diluted properly. It was just as though they did everything in a hurry. Overall, not a pleasant experience for me. It could have been better.

Since 1930s stands this tearoom which will transport you back to the times of the fancy Britishers and the affluent Indians. Being a standard in cakes and confectionary, it's a piece of Kolkata's history for taste and times. With the classic timelessness to it's aura, occupying a comfortable main corner at Park Street. 
It's not just any breakfast, it's Breakfast at Flurry's.

We had a triple layer club sandwich. Which was so wholesome and yum.

Flurys is one of those legendary eateries that has defined the culture of tea houses and breakfast joints in kolkata. Been there so many times but I never paid any heed towards reviewing this place. Being a vegetarian it becomes quite difficult to choose it's items because purely veg items are very less. Since I have no inhibitions for eggs in pastries and cakes and other sweets I can try all. Butterscotch, cheesecake, black forest, Apple blueberry pie are some of my favourites. Among breakfast menu, I like their hot chocolate and cheesy mushroom on toast. Always satisfactory and always the same.

Review No 319:

This review is based on the sweet goodie pack brought over from Kolkata...and what a delightful surprise.

The pack included:

a. Almond Honey Tart: Subtle with the rich aroma of honey in the bite followed by the almonds hidden beneath. Very nice. Price: Rs 58.09

b. Almond and Cheese Tart: Again, very similar lines to the earlier Honey and almond tart but this had a very nice texture and taste of cheese. Nothing over the top. Another winner. Price: Rs 58.09

c. Baba Cake: The first time I tasted something like this and its unique. Not having taste one before I cannot comment if it’s on par or better but good taste. Price: Rs 58.09
 
d. Plum Slice: Humble Plum slice. Nicely holding its own and not crumbling. Price: Rs 58.09

e. Lemon Tart: Again, a classic recipe. Tangy, sweet and melts the heart and mouth. Awesome like. Price: Rs 124. 48

Price: mentioned above. The total came to Rs 430/-

Service: Was reported to be prompt

The ratings this time more based on the taste is as follows:

Food: 4.5/5
Price: 3.5/5

Then again 1day got courage to try out their desert and ordered brownie and chocolate truffle with some cookies, everything was bad the quality and taste,i actually left the pastry half eaten and parcel the left over cookies and not to my surprise nobody in my family ate those cookies. One wl get btr pastries on local brands of kolkata i guess. Very horrible experience.

Ok so i was told that this is a must visit place in kolkata and was told to have breakfast here. Couldnt make it for breakfast but landed up here just after lunch. Wasnt too hungry so ordered a lemon tart and molten chocolate. I havent had lemon tart in my life so i had no idea about the taste. All i can say now is that it was too lemony for me. A sharp lemon taste which din go well with me coz i was expecting something else. The molten chocolate tasted more like rum than chocolate. Overall it was a bad experience.

The infamous cake shop. Word was that only the elite could afford here. Located at the hub of Park Street, this is a famous place. Price is on the higher side, but quality is very good. A must visit shop in Park Street for me.

It's more than surprising that being the crazy sweet tooth that I am, I visited the Flurys at park street as late as yesterday. Built circa 20years before independence,Flurys and Calcutta goes hand in hand because of the heritage it beholds within its pink and cream decor. Our generation, I am more than sure has grown up hearing compliments about this place from our parents and  without we would do the same in future. Despite the beautiful,optimumly pompous and most importantly vintage decor, Flurys gives you an unexplained homely feeling..that is vested in each of its entity- be it the drapes to the red velvet pastry in its bakery. The taste of the food, goes without saying is more than heavenly..giving the visitors a feeling of having maybe a high tea with fresh bakes and food straight from your home oven to your plates directly. I could go on..hence to conclude- I am all praises for this place and my rating for the same echos my feeling.

Upon entering this place and just by looking around and not even at the food, just like that your craving for something sweet will surface. It has the most amazing deserts and give those grandiose breakfasts a try. The only thing questionable is the level of service I think that can be improved upon.

The best place in Kolkata for continental breakfast. I had been here twice before and loved their English Breakfast. This time, however, I decided to go for French Toast and a Shredded Chicken Omelette. I have no complains on the taste. We were a big group and everyone ordered something different (English, Joggers, Pancakes, Egg Benedict, etc.). All the dishes were perfect! (Tip - they have the best chicken sausages)

The one thing they can certainly improve is their service. The restaurant made us wait long as there are very few tables which can accommodate 10 people (fair enough!). But even after waiting for an hour they offered us two separate tables (unfair!). Our waiter was all over the place. Extra items were charged to our bill and they took 15 min to correct that. Worst part is - none of the waiters seemed well trained and didn't bother for any of their mistakes.

Go there if you think great food can compensate for horrible service.

To be honest, I am confused while rating Flurys. I have been to this place many times. But today was something different. I was at Park Street at 9 in the morning, and the best place of having breakfast was this place. I ordered for Cheese Cake, Chicken and Cheese Toasted Sandwich and Bacon. The taste for all 3 was kickass! No compromises on the taste for sure! What was SHOCKING was that they by mistake they put a glass of coconut water on my table and I took a sip. Later the person who was incharge of my table, came and and enquired about it and I said its fine thinking that it's complimentary. 

Later when I saw the bill, I found out that they had added it in my bill and when I reasoned with them that it is their fault, they simply told me that since I said fine about the drink, they added the same. I found the matter petty to argue, and paid the entire amount. But, a place with the reputation of Flurys can definitely afford to treat their patrons better. The saddest part was that I had to pay for something which I never ordered, and I took a sip thinking that is water and when I realised that it is coconut water, I thought it might have been complimentary.

Sorry to say but flury's has lost its speciality in desserts. The flurys coup tasted very very average and the lemon ice tea was horrible. Even quality across the street gives much much better sundaes. It really needs to tighten its belt to avoid such negative reviews.

This is a confectionery with a great connection to kolkata's, as well as India's, food and cultural heritage. No one could beat the iconic icing Christmas cakes of Flurys stuffed with fruits with a santa positioned strategically,at one point of time. It is the pride of kolkata.  
Around the end of the nineties the standard and quality of the products and services began to falter badly. However, credit has to be given on how the place reinvented itself and improved its quality by leaps and bounds, especially its gooey chocolate shell easter eggs. In fact, they were the first confectionery to start making such delectable easter eggs. Another confection to definitely try there is the pineapple pastry. 
             Most products are popular and yummy. The place is frequented by natives as well as international visitors. It is kolkata's classy hub for breakfast and tea. It is a different, traditional style English experience.

One word: Vintage or Antiquated 
Choose one and it describes this place perfectly,the dishes here are antiques in their own right.The service is Vintage to the point where they know there regulars since we were born probably.
Food hasn't changed that much over the years neither has the old school charm of this place.Love the Chicken and Cheese Quiche ,Beans on toast , Ham and cheese sandwich gulped down with a glass of fresh orange juice.

There is actually no need for a review for Flurys atleast i feel. The best coffee shop of kolkata with a decor that exude old world charm and a must visit destination for people from all over the world coming to visit kolkata - what else can i say. One of the best places to visit during teatime. They have excellent assortment of bakery products and one f the best acrdn to me being the choclate eclair they prepare. The cost is at par with the new generations ccds or barista but the warmth n nostalgia a calcuttan can feel here is what ccds or baristas cannot provide with. I stricly feel that if i really need to shell out something within 600-700 for a cake/eclair, coffee or snadwich its better to drop in here than anywhere else

This IS a kolkata institution, and I went there, again with my parents. The pastries were quite tasty, but hey..you get this sort of thing at 1/3 rd the price, at other confectioneries. The ambiance was really good, sort of old-kol feel to it! You have a view of Park Street, which is really nice.

Looking for Continental Breakfast?? Well, Flury's is THE PLACE you're looking for! It is indeed the Legendary Place for Breakfast in Kolkata serving authentic English Breakfast among others. Situated in Park Street, this place serves the best of sweet delicacies, it's actually the ideal place for sweet teeth for their yummy cakes, pastries and other bakery. During Christmas, it's actually the Hot Spot in town for their special festive fruit cake.

The ambience is very good. It is so good that they charge extra for it. Compare the prices of this shop with their south city counter. Their sweet items hark back to an earlier era, of less subtlety and less lightness. The dessert items are "heavy".

Was in Kolkata for work and it was my first time.. had dreamt of having breakfast here. Well breakfast didn't happen but has a chance to visit the place at night.. I was amazed the moment I entered. It's nothing short of a Cafe in Paris,the ones in the olden times.
Don't have words to describe what it felt to be inside..  completely mesmerized. I requested if I could have the famous corn toast for dinner but the server politely informed that it's an item only served during breakfast hours.
I tried the much talked about Rum ball and an experimental Chocolate cube. Both were nice.. very different and old school kind. I don't know if I liked it or just found it different.. definitely the ambience influenced my experience way too much. But next time I'm in Kol, I will definitely try the English breakfast and share review soon.

Well what can I say about this place that hasn't already been said. having stayed in Calcutta all my life, we have come to know Flurys as a landmark. But it had deteriorated over the years. The beans on toast is not what it used to be. The pistachio though definitely is, and so is the sprungli. So go here for the old Calcutta feel, and for these two items.

One of the legendary bakery that serves the best English breakfast in the town in the heart of Park Street. Perfect place the I ensure to take my western clients to experience the real high quality aromatic tea and their clubbed sandwich loaded with chicken chunks. Simply die for all their assorted pastries and chocolates and of course the seasonal mango souffle. Service is bit slow.

Update: I visited Flury's in the park Street area this Sunday. We wanted to sit down for a coffee/tea. On entry the attendant asked us what we wanted to order. It seemed abrupt. We told him coffee. He said we are serving dinner only. Checked my watch, it was 6:50PM. Surely, people do eat dinner at 6:50PM in Antartica I think. Later on saw a placard saying that we serve dinner only after 7:30PM. May be you guys can explain me that.

Seems like top management has no idea what they are doing. They need to decide who they are really quick. A dining restaurant, a bakery or a coffee shop? My guess they have no idea.

Old review: Great location at Park Street. Ambience is good. Loved the tea cutlery and biscuits provided with any-time tea, however tea was sub-par. Coffee was exceptionally good.  No window side seats for those not in groups of 3 or more. They have an extensive food menu as well. Will visit again to try more options.

So I went here on a Friday afternoon after attending class since mrng! I was starving and so asked for a parcel of chocolate croissant. And guess what they refused to serve it to me because I was not giving giving them change. As if I would not give it to them had I had change. I don't get the point of being such a reputed restaurant if you cannot satisfy your customers!

The legendary tearoom stands with pride since the early 1900 and commands a special place in the hearts of anyone or everyone who has lived in Calcutta.  Much before the explosion of baking studios, this tea room for generations has introduced and made all of us fall in love with exotic cakes, creamy pastries, rich puddings and of course the heartwarming English breakfast where till date people queue up on Sunday mornings. 

A relaxed and cheerful place, you can bump into people of all age groups chatting away to their heats content. Its timeless decor with a modern touch with large glass  windows adds to the charm to this European styled cafe.  

While you could start your Sunday morning  or any morning with a breakfast complete with eggs of your choice, bacon, hash brown, sausages, baked beans and feel like a king, an evening  adda with mushroom on toast, the huge non veg club sandwich and the signature Darjeelig tea  just make life seem perfect. 

Come Christmas and till date no one beats their deliciously rich plum cakes. If you don't want to queue up, just place an order online and they delievr them in pretty pink tin boxes.

Flurys is not a tea room. It  is an experience.

Living in the glory of days gone by, will not do a lot of good to this heritage restaurant. Quality of food and service are the only 2 things that should matter and if Flurys continues to get raving reviews by patrons who visit because of its iconic brand name, it should feel very grateful for that.

My friends and I visited Flurys twice during a 3 day vacation to Kolkata. The first time we ordered the most regular breakfast fare - Scrambled eggs on toast, some coffee and rum balls. The order took ages to arrive, while everyone around us, including folks who were seated after us were being served. After waiting for around 30 mins when we enquired about our order, we were told that "the machine isn't working so they can't get us toast". That took a while to be fixed after which we got our toasts n eggs finally. There was one mix up of the order where a "masala scrambled egg" was served instead of a "scrambled egg". Instead of 2 coffees, we were served one coffee and one tea - We had to return that and wait again for our coffee. We went to the confectionery counter and ordered a rum-ball for our table. Despite being ready, it took at least 10 more mins for the rum-ball to arrive. The foo, however, tasted just fine during this visit.

The restaurant has an open kitchen of sorts that caused the whole place to be filled with smoke. They tried to keep the AC temperature to freezing low, but that doesn't help smoke, you know!

During the second visit, we ordered some pasta, scrambled eggs and more confectionery items (cheese cake, eclairs, pineapple pastry) and coffee. The pasta was the only dish that was fine. The cheese cake was hard, extremely dense with a base that was soggy and not crunchy. There was some cream on the pastry that should have been fresh whipped cream, but instead was stale and hard cream that we could cut through. Out of 2 cappuccinos, one arrived and the other didn't - they claimed that "their machine wasn't working". 

Overall, please give Flurys a complete miss for any meal or confectionery. If you want to visit them because you want to check off a heritage place on your list, go ahead and have a coffee. Calcutta definitely has better confectionery places and it's time that we stopped letting Flurys be the benchmark for Calcutta's confectionery expertise.

A brilliant place to start your day!!
I went there with my family for breakfast for first time, though we were quite late for it, as we reached there almost closing hours around 11:40am (there timings for breakfast: 8:30am till before 12 noon), still they were very excited to serve us. 
We ordered their special breakfast menus, like American breakfast which includes poached eggs, chicken sausages, bacon though we replaced with chicken sausages (it's optional), pancakes served with chicken sausages as well and with maple syrup, chicken quiches, blueberry cheese pastry, watermelon juice, cappuccino. Simply you can't compare the food quality and quantity with one another, as we enjoyed their food as long as with the hospitality. Beautiful ambiance, vintage feel, situated in the centre of the Park Street area.
Really appreciated with overall experience including value for money. These whole thing were cost us around 2100 including taxes.
Must visiting place!!

Flurys has been a pride of the city for years. However off late I felt though the food is still  exceptional, the service fails to live up to the expectations. Visited last thursday for lunch to catch up with some friends from Delhi. We ordered a cheese tomato croissant and a club sandwich which were delicious. But the waiters were utterly confused. They brought us a lamb steak which we didn't even order. Knives and forks had to be asked for. We further ordered grilled fish and chicken cordian bleu which were delicious. The only disappointment in terms of food was the red velvet cheesecake, wasn't upto the standards.

Flury's must be on everyone's to do list when the visit Kolkata. The decor has that old charm and the staff too is very cordial. One of my favourites here is the open sandwich, it's a classic. Also tried the crossiant sandwich, grilled chicken and cheese sandwich and the eggs benedict. It's a legendary restaurant, perfect for breakfast with family and friends. No meal is perfect without dessert so do try out their array of pastries. My favourites are the black forest, pinapple and butterscotch. A must visit definately!

I had ordered a cake for my mom's birthday recently.  Everything arrived on time (cake and bouquet) and so did the receipt! The bakery was thoughtful enough to remind my mom how much I had spent on her birthday! When my family "signed the receipt" for the order which I had already paid for, believe me I had the most depressing 10 minutes of my life.

EXTREMELY BAD SERVICE WHEN DELIVERING CAKES. I had paid for the cakes before as that is the rule where they give you a receipt. Then they deliver the cakes without any stamp that the cake is delivered.After paying for the cakes  me and my friends had coffee and chatted for some time and then went outside to smoke a cig. Then we came back and asked for the cake using the reciept. Then the HORROR started. The manager told us they are sure that they have delivered the cake. We disagreed and told them that the cake was not delivered. The manager had the audacity to tell us to move aside as he apparently did not have time for such hassles. Then he insulted us for lying! It is shameful that a iconic place like this is being served by this kind of corrupt management.Then we had to shout for some time and demanded higher management untill some old man came and told the management that I was standing in front of him in the line and he has seen the item is not delivered. I do not understand why flury's does not have a stamp "paid and delivered" when they are taking the payment beforehand. It is shameful that unprofessional in every aspect of business and very soon the next door competitor like au bon pain will draw more people. We hate Flury's now..After all who wants buy from a shop with all the hassles and bad experience , insults even after paying!

So i had a dream day in Kolkatta where in I was living in Park Plaza and had breakfast at Flurys lunch at Peter Cat and dinner at Mocambo and all of them were awesome. The place is really fancy and i headed there around 9 am. The breakfast menu was tempting and we had eggs benedict and a Flurys toasted Ham sandwich. Both items were well made. Tried the coffee which was also really good. Even the bakery items like cakes n all did not dissapoint. As a person from Mumbai I was loving the pricing of food in Kolkatta. However this place is expensive. Prices are on the higher side but for quality i dont really mind paying. Nice place ! Keep it up !

The egg sandwich which we ordered was warm from outside where as the egg inside was cold. On asking the manager he said that they keep the preparation in deep freezers.  The place is full of flies, a fly fell in my coffee cup, they however replaced the coffee. The manager on duty was weird and was staring at customers around, passing comments with his colleagues. Ambiance is nice and location is good. You can spot a few local celebs sipping tea in this place. Staff was not very cordial. I am rating the restaurant based on my experience. The place is a well known one in Park Street area and opinions may differ.

it's with a heavy heart that i start writing this review for a cafe/eatery which has a special place in my old childhood memories. hailing from a mofussil town in bengal, my dad used to frequently take us to this place. we would gorge on the numerous pastries and hordes of puffs, patties and some such similar stuff. i also remember having a huge  horde of a week's worth of take-away stuff to carry back to our town raniganj. then we would devour them at breakfast and also carry them to school.

naturally when i re-visited the place, i was crestfallen to see the changes. many were for the better, of course while some filled me up with sheer pain. a much bigger place to flaunt, sprawling seating arrangement etc are things which impress you immediately. what irked me most was the most of the old items have been done away with. much of the stuff available now is the standard fare available at any bakery at any metro in this country.

also done away with was the earlier warmth that effused from the staff behind the counter. the old anglo-indian gentleman behind the counter who dishes out stuff these days may not remember me. many a times during the late 80s-early 90s the same person has cheerfully helped me pick up my choice. there he's now a distant vestige of his old self.

there's a certain degree of bureaucracy which has crept in the cash counter which is really bothersome. having standard charging sockets for charging cell phones is something unthinkable at this place. and the mere enquiry is frowned upon.most of the staff is unfriendly. there are exceptions though when i have been treated well, so am not going for the sweeping generalizations but the trends.

however, i do agree the breakfast remains their single largest USP of recent times. though nothing extravagant, one has to understand in a pre-liberalised post-independent India having an english breakfast was a great thing.it's when you view this place from such a  vantage point of its heritage that you realize it's contribution.

never could i think that a review about a cafe could become such a philosophical catharsis for me. maybe, am saddened at my own emotional apathy towards the place. maybe while pouring my heart out here, am lashing out at myself.

only the old management will recall and understand what am talking about. the younger generation wouldn't even know why am rambling on!  though i have my own misgivings, it would really gladden me if someone from the management writes back to me. a must visit, any day

The vintage lights and decor set the most beautiful ambience in Flury's. There is a grand old nostalgic feeling in everything about this place. I have tried their butter cream pastries in all the flavours- chocolate, strawberry and butterscotch. They all tasted great but may seem a little too creamy and heavy. We have ordered birthday cakes from here and they tasted great too. The chicken and mushroom quiche tastes quite good and the chicken  and mayonnaise sandwich is made to perfection. Overall it was a bit expensive but a wonderful experience and a must visit in Kolkata.

English breakfast, American pancakes, coffee.
English breakfast has got:
1. Sunny side ups
2. Hash browns
3. Bacon strips
4. Chicken sausages.
5. Toast and butter.
American pancakes just looked sumptuous.
Coffee was great too.
Wake up in the morning to have breakfast at Flurys.

Breakfast at Flurys is an experience class apart. 

Occupy one of the tables beside the glass walls and enjoy the super awesome breakfast with your loved ones. 

We reached at 9:15am on a Sunday morning and had to wait for 15 minutes to get a table. The aroma of the freshly baked goods & steaming coffees will increase your appetite in a moment. 

We ordered a Chicken & Mushroom Quiche, Roast Chicken Sandwich, Chicken & Cheese Sandwich, Chicken Sausages & Hash Brown, Darjeeling Tea, Coffee with Cookies, Lemon Tart & Choco Chip Muffin.

Serving time was  around 7 minutes. 

We were little disappointed with the lemon tart which was too sweet, the Chicken Quiche which was kind of bland and the Roast Chicken Sandwich which was little dry
Apart from these, Chicken & Cheese Sandwich was brilliant, Chicken Sausages were good, Hash Brown was excellent (we wanted to re-order but were too full), Tea & Coffee were good, Muffin was great. The cookies served with coffee were okayish. 

Prompt Service. 
Price little on the higher side, but considering the overall experience at this legendary place of Kolkata, you will not regret shedding the few extra bucks.

Absolutely Recommended!

This is another one of those legendary eateries part of the famed Kolkata food haunts and i vividly remember stepping in here and enjoying a mutton patty as a little kid.

Fast forward to the present day, they have renovated quite a bit and the place looks even better with new lights complementing the high arched ceilings. However, on my most recent visit I felt that the service was not up to par and the waiters were a little rude. 

Now, as far as the food is concerned, although not bad, I feel that it is a tad over hyped. The sandwiches, patties and pastries are all pretty good, but not mind-blowing by any stretch of the imagination.

Flurys, to be honest, is nothing but a legend in Kolkata. I used to hear stories about it as a kid from my father. I decided to try it one evening. It was a busy weekend evening. 

It's a beautiful cafe with very nice chandeliers. Warmly lit with the staff being always busy. 

I just ordered a brownie and ice cream as I sat down to take in as much as I could. All the people there seemed to be enjoying being a part of history. So did I.

The brownie I was served was equally legendary. Beautifully presented with abundant chocolate syrup and ice cream. I loved it to the core. 

I would definitely go back to it again, try some more delicacies and post a more detailed review. Until then I am happy to have visited an all time legend of a cafe.

This place do not need a review since it's reputation speaks for itself. You don't get a very cozy ambience to seat and hang out in this outlet but for a quick breakfast or snacks there's no better place than this in the all over kolkata. The bakery items and pastries are meant to gorge upon. Pricing it a bit high but totally worth it.

Flurys at Park Street is known as one of Kolkata's most loved places. I have been here quite a few times but as they say the last impression is the one you hang on to. I was there at Flurys on 28th August Sunday with a friend. We had coffee and hot chocolate and sat and talked for sometime. It was surprising for us to find the hugely unprofessional behaviour of the staff thereafter, who despite several calls did not hand us the bill at our table. I had to walk up to and pay directly at the counter. No wonder the cafe just beside it gets a huge thumbs up from me and my girlfriend who are regulars there.. Flurys should take note and act immediately anyways they have lost 'charm' in todays age of competition.

When you have a legacy of five generations behind you; it reflects in everything right from infrastructure to interiors, from food to the service. I was in Kolkata for a couple of days and a friend suggested that I must have breakfast at this place. So I landed up here on a lovely Friday morning at around 8:30 and I must admit I didn’t expect the place to be quite full at that time of the day. The menu is impressive; they serve homemade muesli and they are in business since 1927! The place is a bit pricey but the experience is definitely worth the money. The service is impeccable and food ofcourse tastes heavenly! This goes in my “must visit places list” in Kolkata.

Being a foodie, coming the review for this classic place now is bad i know.. what is there to say about this place, its a place tat every kolkatan knows, whether they have been there just to grab a cake, or to meet sm1 first time, or for an informal corporate meet, or for there daily routine all time favorite English breakfast. The hospitality is great. U just sense some aura sitting inside this landmark rich place. We ordered a joggers breakfast, which was so tempting even being a vegetarian, u get 2 hash browns, 2 toast and butter, 2 sausages, 2 bacon strips, and choice of a beverage. Ordered for myself a bean toast (which again is the specialty here). Pinch in pocket is 4.5/5, but obviously keeping in mind that this place is a no non-sense place

This is the place to be at, when your sweet-tooth needs some pampering! 
It's nothing less than a heritage for Kolkata. 
During my last visit, I grabbed some pastries from their outlet at the Dum Dum Airport. They were so good that I made it a point to visit their outlet in the city during my next tour. 
It is there that I came to know about their 5-generation long history. 
A must visit place on the itinerary while visiting the city of Joy.
Although it's a bit on the expensive side, but totally worth it. The yummy-ness quotient wins over the cost.

One of the most heard of bakeries of Calcutta, outside of Calcutta, would be Flurys. Of course then it had to be one of the pit stops while exploring Park Street. The outlet is large and spacious and has a vintage feel about it. Their range of pastries and desserts is amazing and delicious. We tried the chocolate mousse and chocolate elaichi pastry as an after dinner dessert, both of which were really tasty.

Next morning we headed out early for the legendary Flurys English breakfast. It was the most fulfilling plate of eggs and sausages, and thus is a must have. They have an option of bacon too for the meat enthusiasts. I got mine replaced with more chicken sausages. The morning sunshine filtering through the blinds just added to the whole experience. A slight buzz kill for vegetarians though. Since there is no vegetarian alternative of the English Breakfast at Flurys, you will have to choose from one of their fancy enormous sandwiches.

Pastries are a one part of looking at them for me, they are no doubt the best but even their customer service is also awesome. I asked for charger and nobody had that as due to phones are not allowed for their employees at the floor, and most businesses don't allow them at the workplace. Just because they couldn't help me, they treated me pretty well and offered another pastry for free (though cheap, but atleast something). I liked their this gesture and though I denied out of courtesy but this is something I'll remember them for long (Y)

We have all had those days when we have woken up in the morning and said ‘Aaj monta Flurys Flurys korche’ or ‘Flurys hobe naki ?’ or ‘Chol aaj Flurys jawa jak’. Right from inception in 1927 this tearoom belonging to a Swiss gentleman, Joseph Flury, and his wife, Frieda has revolutionized the restaurant culture of Kolkata. Today It’s owned by the Paul Family. Not many know the story of young Jit Paul, who one morning in 1965, struck up a conversation with Joseph Flury on the street and ended up making an offer that Joseph couldn’t refuse.

The English Breakfast was on my list for a long time. I went their with my wife and we ordered 2 English Breakfast. In the menu it was written that you can have either Juice or Tea with your breakfast, but the waiter told us that they will serve both without any extra cost👌. The orders arrived within 10 mins and it was looking delicious. The bacon strip was awesome, perfectly cooked. Sausages were also nicely grilled. Everything was cooked to perfection. We ended our breakfast with some nice tea.

Do you always crave for desserts?? If yes, then this place is a truly paradise for you. When i was roaming in the lanes of Kolkata and exploring the city i saw this cafe to settle down. I ordered brewed coffee (they use 100% arrabica coffee beans) with pistachio dessert. The place is like a royal bakery because of the influence of British architecture in Kolkata. I would love to go again when i am in town.

Have been a frequent visitor but now I feel I should certainly add my review. While it has been one of the landmark breakfast places in Kolkata for ages, it never lets go of the high quality service along with lip smacking food. The English breakfast is always a good choice before I take client meetings in that area. Their Masala Chai has a distinct flavour that I go there for. A must visit got many things but I'd go for their breakfast selection. Any day!

This much hyped, famous and a guaranteed place for celeb spotting has maintained all that aura and quality from the British era. If you're someone who wants to breakfast in style, go for it. Also if you're the "aantel" intellectual Bangali, you won't be alone here. And if you're none of these, you could just go for the fun of it. It's high on the budget as well as elegance. Do not be intimidated by flaunting fellow eaters, it's perfectly normal to instagram the beautiful dishes with the Flurys signature or the luxurious decors. People visit this place more for the heritage and affluent association than actually eating. Coming to food, it's pretty much above average, but not quintessential really. The breakfast platter is a real challenge to finish. So order wisely if you don't want to go penniless. On an ending note, Flurys is a must visit for every visitor to the town and all those too who take Swag seriously!! :)

I should not say much about this place . Definitely its counted one of the top 3 well known restaurants in Kolkata . Just want to add small review of its service in recent days , i.e the staffs are very rude , they dont know how to behave with customers. When i last visited there , I felt the service has deteriorated drastically. The staffs were arrogant and not helpful . We were not allowed to sit in a table where it was not reserved. So Flurys I must say You lost your charm and overrated.

People usually go for breakfast or tea and pastries and the reviews here are mainly about them.
Let talk about dinner here.
We were a group of five (two veg and three non-veg) walked in on a week day at 9:40 in the evening.
We were cordially seated in the completely empty dining room, and were informed that they were about to close in half an hour.
We ordered 'crunchy garlic filled mushroom with garlic mayo' and 'mediterranean grilled prawn salad' as starter. For main course it was 'grilled fish', 'grilled chicken steak','mushroom,broccoli and baby-corn stroganoff' and 'grilled skewered cottage cheese'. 
The best among them was the melt in the mouth grilled fish. It was soft, moist and grilled to perfection, showing us why the place is a legend. Next best was the mushroom dish with crunchy exterior and filled with melted cheese and a large button mushroom inside, which left us craving for more.
We finished off with peach melba and Flury's coupe which were excellent.
the only drawback appeared to me is that the tables were greasy.

D staff really need proper grooming in etiquette... v had to almost ask five times to get refill of our glasses...
Poor presentation clubbed with inefficient staff was a big showdown...
Surely it's a legend but then I feel sorry with such staff and service the legacy shall take a hit and a major setback is inevitable...
Food was gud but then nothing great about it...
I hope d management take note and make efforts to improve service... 
I hav rated 3 jst for food.

Excellent food but the service needs to improve a lot. On a recent visit for weekend breakfast was dismayed to find the service staff behaving like that of a mismanaged wedding house.
Moreover had an issue with the billing, though it was sorted out. 
This establishment is one of the major culinary destinations of Kolkata, have had requests from out of town guests to take them to "Flurys" ! So would request the management to improve the quality of service that they provide the guests.

To write or review about a "Legend" is quite a daunting task. A Legend is never made in one day and with the passage of time, the embelishments make up the legendary tales of today.
Flurys, is surely the legend among the patisseries in Kolkata. Crown jewel, among the restaurants decorating the park Street, this place is also known for its breakfast!
For long, my wife and I had this interest of trying out their legendary breakfast, rather than their pastries and cake, the last Sunday morning we finally got that chance!
Ambience of flurys is something which I have always been love with and the other restaurants should try to emulate it. High arched ceilings, warm lights, glassed walls, plush sofas everything makes it look very chic yet there's this old rustic charm about this place! 
After a waiting time of 20mins, seated comfortably, I ordered a joggers breakfast and my wife settled for their famed, English breakfast.
The main problem about legend is that they are over-hyped and so was the case with our breakfasts. 
English breakfast consisting of 2 pieces of toast, bacon, 2 grilled sausages, couple of rashers, a grilled tomato, beans and 2 egg poaches accompanied with a glass of tender coconut water and tea to be served later, was okay. The bacon was salty, the sausage should have been grilled a bit more. But anyways the hype of this breakfast (read, the price also) was much more than the dish itself!
Same was the thing with joggers breakfast, lesser cholesterol contained version of the English breakfast.
Anyhow, that is the thing, in one word the breakfast in flurys is over-hyped! But, then again, it is expected, the hype of legends grow with time!

One of the worst places I have been to in the recent times. I went to Flurry's with my Mother and Sister and as we are vegetarians , we requested to the server if he could suggest something in Veg, he was clueless. To add to our disappointment his mobile starts ringing and he suddenly answers his phone and walks away while we are still waiting at the table. 
Finally we manage to order 1 appetizer and some veg sandwiches, the sandwich arrives after 20 minutes when I kept staring at the guy, however the appetizer does not arrive. To our dismay... there is a strand of hair in the sandwich... to which I had call out to the staff of Flurry's and then when they finally see what i showed them...there is no regret or apology. he straight away goes to the billing counter and cancels the sandwich from the bill, as if we had come to have a free sandwich.

The staff is least interested and they are perpetually fooling amongst themselves...no one is keeps a eye on the customers response to food or taste. 
I guess its all Hype that Flurry's is surviving on. to make the matter worst....no one is interested in Customer Service or service standards of the restaurant. 

Now my belief in Hype of certain places which purely live off the heritage of the brand which may have had a history to something good in their times...is absolute facade in 2016.

Hope the Flurry's management is listening.

Overpriced. Over hyped. Abjectly fails to deliver.

I can absolutely visualise this place making Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares, were he to ever base the show on Indian restros. Which is a pity, given the fond memories my mum has of the fare this place used to dish out in its heyday some 40 years ago.

Avoid it. Give the newer patisseries in the city a chance. Or if you must go at least avoid the tasteless American Pancakes and pastas and the tepid tea selection. If you must have something, the quiches are not inedible.

Flurys is well known for its ambience and confectionary items.
We walked in on a rainy evening and ordered a cappuccino, a peach melba coupe and a red velvet pastry.
The items looked wonderful but  was not great to taste. Very sugary. And personally I have had better red velvet. Tad overpriced.encasing on the brand name. 
The ambience zone though made up for everything else.

Couldn't try much here cuz by the time I could get over this place, my stomach was already full. But nevertheless I still wanted to hog some more. Tried the red velvet(of course I can't leave any red velvet cake anywhere) and it was delicious. The chocolate mousse was also quite nice. Had a nice well balanced coffee(I still prefer strong) but this one was also nice. 
The ambiance is very nice and the variety is quite elaborate. Good for a nice breakfast!

I love this place because of the old world charm and the warm food. The cheese almond tart was something new and in fact correct for my taste buds - just about sweet with a hint of saltiness. The lemon tarts are good too. But what made me feel good were the giant big pieces of fried fish with tartar and pea mash. There is nothing better than a properly fried fish- crisp but not greasy and yet soft and flaky in the inside. Flury did well to send me home all happy and fed up.

Kolkata is not just any other city it is like a lady who has embraced the people living here and has tried to provide them with all the comforts, flavors, colors and happiness of life. Now talking about taste, my food hunt took me to Park Street. Within two minutes of my stroll I find myself in front of Flurys – the legendary bakers and confectioners in Kolkata. This place has been feeding Kolkata with it’s mouthwatering cakes from 1927. Neither  Kolkata has changed her ways nor has Flurys, both are providing comfort to the Kolkatans. From interiors to food taste, reception to billing everything is a perfect, made for a comfortable experience. From British colonial rule this place was a hot spot for cakes, pastries etc. And now thanks to Zomato it s more easy reachable global food destination. Now this place serves great food from cuisines like English, French, Continental etc and cakes, pastries, breads and buns, pies, tarts and patties. My personal favorites are chicken asparagus patties, chicken patties, chicken envelops and chicken masala patties. From cakes I love their red velvet cake, chocolate truffle, black forest, white forest,rum balls and the list would never end. In breakfast the classic English breakfast tops in the menu. Their grilled prawns are juicy, tender and very flavorsome. The pastries are moist and each has it’s significant taste preserved. Like truffle cake is sweet and heavy while red velvet is soft, light and moderately sweet. I can very well guarantee that this place can never turn anyone down. This is the best place to feel Kolkata’s sweetness and love that she has nurtured in her garden.

One of the most iconic and Heritage restaurants on the party zone of Kolkata. Flurys is a benchmark in confectionaries and not just of the city but of the country. The ambience of the place is like those European cafes with high ceilings and arches. Flurys serves amazing cakes and pastries and a lot of other confectionaries, but 1 thing that I crave about is the English breakfast they serve. Ohh it is heaven if there ever was one. I have always been there in the mornings and mandatorily I've had their Breakfast platter. In case you miss the morning visit I recommend their sandwiches, they are another thing to swear by, lots and lots of variety that you can just spend hours choosing. Their Darjeeling tea is from another planet and not just from the hilltops from the north of the state.
Statutory warning : For anyone who wants to have their famous breakfast on the Christmas morning, you guys better be there by the break of dawn or else have A LOT of time in hand. I once spent a couple of hours easy on the queue.
I jump at the opportunity to visit this place again, so yeah I'll be there soon enough and till then keep visiting.

Overrated joint , food is not so great , staff are dumb and lacking in customer relation skills.
Ambience is good. I saw the manager fighting with two customers in space of 30 mins and twice the flury's personnel were at fault , owners need to look into the matter so that these customers who are ill treated don't go away as their family members , relatives , friends will also stop coming and in the end all good things come to an end saga for you respected people .
Get well trained waiters , managers to run the place.
After ordering my items I see the waiters kicking each othet in a joking way and nearly took out the pastry counter . The customers were staring at them still they kept on kidding around as if its a play ground for 6 year old kids , I mean it was crazy the pastry counter almost went overboard.
Oh yes! There were a couple sitting in the left corner as soon as they told the waiters they are going to order for beverages the waiter tells them to sit in the right corner I mean wow what a rule , as if its the apartheid era .
Then I told the waiters i'll have some pastries and a sundae i guess the first waiter did not understand what I meant still politely told me and my friend to sit in the other side , Well another waiter comes tells me what you wanna have I tell him double chocolate sundae and when I tell him so am I allowed to have this sundae in the left corner he says yes sir sure , one waiter says you can't the other one says you can , weird and they are extremely uneducated and dumb.
Then I call the other waiter I was going to order a sundae so why didn't let me sit there , he got tongue tied .
Then again another gentleman goes up to one of the waiters telling is it Wagah Border yaha Pakistan waha India and Mind you that gentleman was in his late 40's.
Overhyped joint to say the least , my advice go to other joint give this place a miss , so much for heritage of Bengal.
So we had Double Chocolate Sundae which was average , quality has certainly deteriorated obviously if you have such obnoxious employees'/personnel working for you.
Chocolate Pastry was nice but the Almond Doughnut was poor really poor it was like I was having sugar.
Overall an extremely poor experience.

I will make sure my friends , my colleagues , relatives , family , penpals , social media friends , my employees , my teachers , my students , my boyfriends , my girlfriends nobody visits this so called heritage joint , it's a big lie like being told Santa Claus exists. Plus you are lucky I gave you 2.5 and not 1.0 .    
                  (JOKES APART)

I hope the owners look into the matter and get the old charm back and replace such obnoxious , ignorant , incompetent fools with proper well trained personnel, such people are giving a bad name to FLURY'S.

This one Name, takes me back my memory lane, where mornings with dad used to be omelette with sauce and long queue of waiting people.

Was there last week and had baked beans with toast and scrambled egg with cold coffee... Baked beans still has no competition anywhere in Kolkata. To my surprise the scrambled egg took away the credit as didn't imagine it to be so delicious. Cold coffee was absolutely perfect with right amount of coffee and it was chilled.

One of the good places to have breakfast. One thing has changed drastically over the years is the price.. Breakfast would not be less than rs.500-600 per person .

Flurys is Kolkata's one of the heritage café cum bakery, opened in 20th century, British colonial time. Since then it stole Kolkata's heart serving their delicacies- one of the best cakes and poodings available here. Plum cake from Flurys used to be ( and still very much popular) a must on Christmas day list for Kolkata's who's who, the charm hasn't faded away. They are also famous for their heavely reach poodings and ranges of cupcakes, truffles and handmade chocolates. Also who haven't heard of Flurys Special English Breakfast which still brings on old colonial essence. However this review is not in Flurys' deserts but on the savourys served here.
So, I was in Park Street on a rainy humid evening, wanted to try out something else but simple and light at Flurys. We ordered Fresh Lime water, Flurys Special Tea and Grilled chicken breast with sauted veggies on the bed of tomato salsa served with butter& home baked bread roll. Special tea was nothing special although that Grilled chicken stole my heart, it was very light yet very fulfilling and satisfying. Chicken breast was stuffed with minced chicken marinated with some simple ingredients- few fresh herbs, salt and pepper. Side of vegetables had grilled baby potatoes with skin, baby tomatoes, carrot, asparagus, broccoli, beans and few rosemary leaves, tomato salsa was one of the best i had! So simple yet so tangy and spicy!
This place is the one when you are looking for a quiet(and high quality😉, prices are not so pocket friendly) place to spend quality time with your bae/family while enjoying some great colonial foods. And desserts! You might even end up spotting one or two from our Tollywood celebrities even. I met Anjan Dutta here😇🤗, giving interview to some magazine maybe! 
So why not try this place out, once in a while we all can spend a bit more money while dining out, after all, the experience gonna stay lifetime.
-0.5 point as after 7:30PM, they have different menu card which have many less options than usual. And I meant, 7:30 PM, not 7:31 PM😋!!!

The British Should have taken Flurys back with them during Independence bcoz it does not belongs here /represents us... They should start billing in $USD or the price in Rupee can give burning sensation to many... the money they charges for simple menus are the daily stripent of 60% calcattans...they sell normal foods for so high prices .. even i can cook msot of the items at home and that would even cost less than 100 rs.. Ya If u r representing a particular Class thats totally acceptable... During British period infront of buildings they used to state " Indians and Dogs are not allowed inside " ....

Now we have got Independence ..so, Poor and Middle class Eat at Home . Others who has enough money not for charity come to Flurys .

**( everytime i think of going to a posh resturant , i donate the money to charity .. atleast it will fill 20 stomachs)

Five generations of fine confectioners? Boy, I think even 100 generations of fine confectioners could not have been able to put up pastries and confectioneries that lip smacking!! The thing about flury's is that it just makes me feel grand every time I enter this park street outlet....I get that grand english era feeling....and then the chocolate delicacies, OMG, they are to die for!! However, the staff needs to be a bit more polite and patient with customers.

This is a very hyped place on park street for all good reasons & surely look very upmarket café inside out. We went there for a coffee & evening prayers for our stomach :) It felt that the prayers were successful. The place is extremely good in terms of its ambiance, taste & first look of the snacks & beverages. The staff was extremely professional. We got few chocolate boxes packed even though we didn't had any intentions of buying chocolates. I would love to go to this place again with old friends & catchup over a weekend. Highly recommended place if you are in Park Street & have an urge for coffee or chocolates.

Flurys is a hallmark breakfast/lunch/dinner institution of Kolkata.It's been ages since Flurys has adorned a quiet niche on Park Street.

The food over here is par excellence.Every time I come here, the food here manages to satiate the foodie in me.

The service is incredibly good, the staff is very polite and courteous and the food is always fresh and to the T.

Must have items : Eggs Benedict, American Pancakes, Stuffed Omelette, Mango Bread Pudding, The Earl Grey Tea ( it's divine)

Had the sumptuous English breakfast and a pot of lemon tea. Portion was large enough for two as you can see in the pic. The presentation was absolutely gorgeous and made up for the fact that the fare was rather average. The real charm of Flurys lies in sitting by the window watching Park Street go by whilst you soak in an old world ambience.

The serve mouth watering chocolates and a perfect joint for chocolate lovers.

The insider decor , you will surely attract you :)

You can go for  any coffee options and desserts.

My personal suggestion will be, don't go on the short eats.Its not that great just basic and can make a hole in your pocket. :P

Must try the Lemon Rolls and the Rum balls.

Now I see why this place is on her number one list.
She met Charles over the counter who had been regularly serving her.25 years ago.
Yummy to die for pasteries,  garlic bread and baked beans on toast.
This place has completed my list and made Kolkatta a heaven for foddies.

This place has been feeding Kolkata with it's mouthwatering cakes from 1927. Neither  Kolkata has changed her ways nor has Flurys, both are providing comfort to the Kolkatans. From interiors to food taste, reception to billing everything is a perfect, made for a comfortable experience. I have visited here for like more than 100 times and from the time Zomato did not come into existence. I love their grilled prawns, chicken asparagus patties, chicken masala patties, English breakfast, red velvet cakes.... the list might not end. Be it birthday, anniversary, farewell my one stop cake shop is this one. People can try anything and I can assure it will be good. Totally worth 5.

A place that has been the very definition of confectionery since forever. Long before Zomato, I have haunted this place for its mouth watering pastries. My personal favorite is their black forest cake which is hands down the best I have ever had. I love their English breakfast platter with bacon and eggs and also their sandwiches. Their coffee is good too. Some people have complained of falling standards. That is perhaps true, however even the fallen standards are pretty amazing.
On a recent visit we tried out their new menu. The pork sausage with onion sauce is a treat to the tastebuds. Their red velvet cake is amazing and the black forest pastry remains as mind blowing as ever.

Flurys is a legend. A place I have adored since childhood. Thereafter spending three years of college life near this bakery-what more can I say. I visited the Flurys bakery twice to talk to the chef and also wondered how the process goes on.
The price is on the higher side. But you will not mind.
Recommended- Flurys breakfast, Blackforest cake, Truffle cake, Chicken masala patties, soft breads.

Try not to miss the cake mixing festival during christmas. The ambiance is splendid although you will miss the Music World store.

As a child I oggled at their numbers of chocolate cakes  (well that's what I used to call it then) and now  the very aroma that literally attacks me once I enter Flurys in park street kolkata, leaves me intoxicated. 
Historically, I have heard, it dates back to the British regime in kolkata hence you can fairly gauge the authenticity of the variety and taste. 
If you are a patisserie lover and have a good taste of confectionery, Flurys will engage your taste buds and transgress all material boundaries. Please try their Sunday brunch which is a paradise in disguise. Their whole day menu is rum balls,meringues with cream, gateau opera,sinful muddy fudge....these are just a handful. Hot beverages like flurys tea,Belgian hot mocha,coffee sprungli. They have special Christmas menu and separate lunch and dinner menu...and yes their good old European classics like apple strudel, linzer, and sacher tortes melt in the mouth. 
Flurys still successfully carries its European class and collection

Red Velvet Slice - Tried it for the first time, worth making it one of your choices if you are buying at the least five different slices.
Alician Slice - It has two layers of cake with frosting and biscuits which make it delicious in a different way.
Cappuccino Eggless - My favourite of the four slices and is recommendable.
Rum Ball - I was told by the staff that Rum Ball is a knockout of Flurys but I wouldn't really recommend it to add it to your top five choices.

The sandwich with shredded chicken, ham, tomato and cheese was expensive and quite heavy even though we were three people gorging into it.

I started with the Vienesse coffee and it was as good as it can be. I would surely recommend the single expresso with whipped cream.

The place needs no introduction... A historical masterpiece of British era stands tall even in present in the heart of Kolkata. 
1. A place for lazy laid back breakfast or a quick chat over office meetings or wanna take someone special.. This place has it all. 
2. The place is a feast for non vegetarians having a supreme menu for breakfast, bakery and desserts. 
3. Try all from the menu. Especially egg Benedict.

Hello. This is my first review on Zomato and like any other, I am excited. I will make it as simple as possible. My pick is 'Flurys at Park Street'.
This was my first trip to Flurys. Me and my friend chose Flurys Mocha, Chicken Sausages and Brownie. Firstly, the place.  The decoration and the ambience of the shop will make you feel like those of in the films, at least for persons like me living in small towns. It was air-conditioned and lights were making the place more attractive. Now coming to the food. I loved the sausages. Every ingredients in it were balanced. You can try it with the sauces on the table. I kinda liked it. Then came the coffee. Well, I don't have much idea about coffees. I can't differentiate among a normal coffee, Espresso, Cappuccino and Mocha. I believe I have to build the taste buds so that I can give better reviews on coffees next time. But I loved the Mocha. It was not so strong. They served it without adding sugar like every coffee shops do. I had it without sugar as I prefer. And then came the treat to our sweet tooth, the Brownie. It was hot and it was chocolate. Nuts and chocolate, when combined, brings great taste. I felt like heaven it melted in my mouth.
When all these tastes and brews mix with drizzling rain outside and best friend beside, you get a great evening.

Flury's for the old Calcuttan charm. 
It's a 90 year old gastronomic monument of Calcutta.
Visit on a weekend morning and order yourself the English breakfast. You will not be disappointed. The sausages were excellent.
The selection of pastries is amazing and everything looks sinful. Prices are on the higher side but for good reason.
Don't miss if you are in Park street or nearby.

Right off the bat, I have to admit that Flurys falls prey to the classic case of a place just not being able to live up to the monumental expectations you have in your mind just by the virtue of it being so popular and talked about. I had my Sunday breakfast here. I ordered the Cheese Omelette, Hash Brown and Cappuccino. The Good: the Cappuccino was heavenly. It is undoubtedly one of the best cups of coffee I've had in this city. Perfect for a Sunday brunch! The hash browns were crispy and golden brown. Absolutely perfect. The Not So Good: the omelette was just plain ordinary. I've had way better cheese omelettes at places much smaller and quaint than Flurys. So that left me quite disappointed. I also took a chocolate chip muffin to go, which again was just OK. I'll admit that I didn't try things like The English Breakfast and Chicken Patty, things that this place is really well known for, but even so, couldn't help but feel a bit let down. Anyway, it by no means is a bad place, you can have an excellent Sunday breakfast/brunch here. It just failed to live up to its 'legendary' status.

Breakfast at Flurys had been on my checklist for a long time. The place is really cozy and warm. We ordered the English Breakfast and American pancakes and cream tea. The quantity is generous and the quality good. However, the service has room for improvement. I had to remind the server to get my tea. We even had to ask for the bill twice.

The place is all that is legendary in all its glory. Epic breakfasts with dessert items to kill for. Had a few visitors from Indonesia and they were truly satisfied with the breakfast there. Since south-east asian culture relies on a good breakfast and they were not really satisfied with the breakfast they were getting at their hotel.
Flury's has the epic rum ball that needs to introduction with their egg preparations topping the chart. a very well laid out english breakfast and epic signature teas to sip on.

Even the name is pastry like.....

It was my absolute dream come true when I finally made it for the romantic ' Breakfast At Flurys ' one morning with a dear friend.

This was my 'Parineeta' and 'Breakfast At Tiffanys' Moment rolled into one.

Since the day I watched the Bengali remake I have romanticised this place in my mind.

Prior to my arrival at this British Raj Tea House my friends used to carry their signature chicken pattice for me all the way to Mumbai.

It was my MIL who used to tell me about her times in Kolkatta and introduced me to Betki fish and chips served here.

Everything on the menu is from the Vintage world of an Era gone by. An Era I idolise.

Love the Old World Charm.

The owners Mr. And Mrs. Flury started this place in the early 1900s and served cocktail sandwiches and special Flurys tea.

They serve their food in beautiful personalised crockery and tea sets.

Cant wait to go back to Park Street and Park myself here at my Favourite.

I have done break fast here with a friend.... and lunch with my daughter.

Next I go there for High tea.

Coming??

There are two things constant in life :
(1) Change
(2) Quality of Chicken Patties in Flury's

Oh Flury's. Have been coming since I was a child and yet I never get bored of this place. The masculine brown decor has been replaced with a more European decor , but no change in the quality of food. Cheese & Mushroom Quiche , Chicken Patties, Club Sandwich , Ham& Mushroom Omlette - topped off with a Chocolate Milkshake. Dunno what Shah Jahan had said about Kashmir , but I've found my heaven here , here ,here !

This heritage bakery cum restaurant tops my list of 'must visit places' during every Cal trip. It is best known as a breakfast place but people flock here all through the day. Between 10 am to 12 pm, be prepared for waiting for about 20-30 min on an average for a table. Its not such a big issue though because of the great location of the restaurant, as you can spend the waiting time just strolling down the beautiful Park Street or checking out the stores on the nearby Camac Street or if you are a book lover, then spending time in the lovely Oxford bookstore just down the road. 
The food at Flurys is absolutely superb! I am totally in love with the beans on toast here. The portion is huge and very filling and they serve chopped onions and green chillies on the side, which add to the taste. The corn on toast is quite good too - corn in cheese sauce spread over two pieces of toast. Another must try is their heritage cold coffee - Cafe Sprungli, vry rich in taste and served in a beautiful glass looking like a waffle cone. It has a tinge of bitterness though, so if you like your cold coffee to be sweet, then you may not like this. The chocolate mousse is excellent too. The place has such a lovely vibe and old world charm that you just cannot step out without having a smile on your face.

This is a place which doesn't need much of a review.
It's one of those heritage places that you have got to visit when in Kolkata.This reviews is going to be only for their pastry section.
LOVE their chocolate cubes almond cubes, however the strawberry cube is too sweet for my taste . Their chicken patty is delicious and so are their brownies. Can't really stop .
Oh and don't forget to get yourself a bar of Flury's chocolate when you are there.sinful indulgence as they say!:)

Flurys, Park Street was on my list for quite a while, and finally I was delighted to be there..!
The look and feel was posh and classy, with counters elaborately displaying pastries and other confectionery items. My intention was to try their continental though.
The waiters were cordial, service was neat and fast. Coming to the food, we ordered English breakfast, Caesar salad, BBQ chicken wings, for two of us. The Caesar salad was extremely satisfying to start with, then the wings were perfectly tossed in a BBQ sauce and was quite appealing too, with 8 pieces on the plate. Finally the English Breakfast was quite authentic in its preparation, with the ham, sausage and hash brown as they should be.... The dishes were all very tasty. The pocket pinch was quite high compared to the number of dishes and the amount served. The bill stood at 1400.
May visit again.

Legendary place for breakfast..have been a regular since late 90's. Although the culinary experience has undergone a steady decline, the old world charm still suffices to pull me back again and again. The egg benedict always has and shall always be the recipe for a perfect start to a day. The quintessential English breakfast has never held my interest. The range of pastries, again, has taken a nose dive but whatever remnants remain- inspire me to parcel an assortment for home every time I visit . 😊

Flurys have been one of my favorite from my school days, because we had one just opposite our school,though a small outlet,inside Spencer's. I ordered a cake to be made in the Game of Thrones design and a photo to be pasted on it, yesterday got the delivery, the cake was awesome and quite satisfied with the design,but it was sooo sugary in taste.
But I must say that they are somewhat careless with the orders. I ordered the cake 23days before, I was actually taken to the Flurys Factory to talk to the chief chef - Vikas Mishra about the design of the cake,( pleased with the meeting though) , 4 days before I mailed them again with all the details as a reminder but they forgot to paste the photo. They made me wait for another 30mins but they took the trouble and did. Thanks a lot to the management. 😊
This Flurys outlet in park street is the biggest in Kolkata, has a nice ambience and quite courteous staff, the English breakfast,lunch and dinner are delectable.
Must try.. 😃

It has been often that I have crossed this place but never visited. I hence get in to treat myself to some pastry. Now I am not really fond of pastry but cheesecakes I crave for. So I buy a cheesecake and a red velvet for my companion and move towards the tables but the unpleasant staff says pastry is to had only at the counter table but I did wish to order ala carte and I told him so yet he was asking us to get ourselves seated at the rather crowded section. Finally he decided to get us the table of our choice. Rude person, if you ask me.
Now the place is simple and adequate and tends to get a little noisy.
Now a croissant with ham, Flury's mocha and a cappuccino was ordered. Food was decent and there is nothing i can really praise about it. I have had better and at cheaper prices. Highlight is the pastry which is as good as it gets. Coffee is decent too.
Visit here only if you wish to enjoy the pastries since they are as good as it gets.
Food is on the pricier side and staff here seems too uninterested.
Only visiting again if I have a craving for some cheese cake!

This place is one of the most well known and oldest places in the city, and certainly lives upto its reputation. The decor is classy, and the menu is not too extensive, but well thought out. I had a chicken steak for lunch, which was just brilliant. The 30 minute wait in line definitely justified the experience.

This place is so famous that I always wanted to try things and decide what makes it so famous. I've heard a lot about the English breakfast but I'm yet to try it. However I did try sandwich and some other stuff. The taste was just average,the staff is snooty, the tables are small and is very uncomfortable. Everything which is legendary need not be good.

This place is a legend on park street, which makes it a legend in Kolkata. 

But over time I've lost my liking for the dine in sections of this joint. Its portions aren't exactly hearty. Not what makes a legendary breakfast place. They are really flying by the name.
That being said, 
I love their confectionery section!! The pastries are nice and old school and so are the other offerings, their bread are pretty great too.

I love this place, but then that's for their confectionery.

The most annoying part is that, half of the items are not available during special occasions, and the pages are removed from the menu, leaving a very few options of sandwiches, beverages and tea cakes.

Nothing new to mention about the decor, but the service is not good enough. The waiters are often rude.

Coming to the food. The English breakfast is good, nothing extraordinary. A bit too over hyped in my opinion. The pancakes, chicken-mushroom quiche, Egg Benedict, are better options for breakfast. The toasted sandwiches are pretty ordinary, be it mayo-chicken or the BLT. Among the main dishes, grilled fish and lamb lasagna are pretty decent. The peach Melba is delicious. Did not like the tea cakes much. Various tea options are pretty aromatic and nice, so is the hot chocolate.

A bit too high on the price chart though. The service surely needs to improve.

Flury’s is a perfect blend of old world charm of a European cafe with a contemporary touch of the modern era. This place is a heritage when it comes to food in Kolkata. Frankly speaking Flury’s needs no formal introduction, the name itself symbolises a mark of taste and quality. It’s not just about the food but the presentation, classical interiors, ambience and the overall experience make this place a perfect choice among all generation.

The dish which I like the most here at Flury’s is “Creamy garlic mushroom on toast”. I can bet, once you try this dish, you are sure to fall in love with it like me. It’s a feast to your taste buds. The combination of bread toast, soft mushrooms and the thick and creamy sauce spread all over is just amazing.

However, one thing that even though the dish had a thick creamy sauce, they didn’t serve the spoon with it. Only the fork and knife were kept at the table.

On being asked about this, the waiter replied, “Sir we intentionally don’t provide spoon with this dish, since you will enjoy more by having a small portion with the fork”.

The next dish I ordered was grilled skewered cottage cheese and vegetables served along with tomato salsa and herbed rice.

The dish was good and the mild flavours of herbed rice (rice infused with herbs like thyme, rosemary etc) and soft cottage cheese went really well. Moreover the tanginess of freshly prepared tomato salsa was like a cherry on a cake. The best part was that it was more of an English taste.

Lastly I tried their Vienese coffee which was just superb – strong and flavorful.

There is nothing new you can say about this place which hasn't been said before. I have not been able to go beyond their breakfast menu, which is just perfect. Loved the ambience and loved the food, however the service is not upto the mark. Though the staff is polite, one might call them slow.
We ordered English Breakfast, two hot chocolate with whipped cream, an add on of hash browns and American pancakes. Each of the items were delicious and the pocket pinch was around 1500.

Well, I dont think introductions are needed for this iconic place right in the heart of Park Street. Located opposite The Park Kolkata, just beside the newly opened Au Bon Pain, Flurys is one of the oldest names in the one of the most sauv place of Kolkata. The one thing that draws the crowd is the English Breakfast with coffee/tea/juice. One catch regarding the English Breakfast is that the juice comes with one two variant: either it is coconut water or watermelon, neither of which is my favorite in terns of juice concerned. The ambiance, well in one word is eccentric, given it is located in the classiest part of the city. The waiters are very courteous and very friendly and prompt with their service. 

Flurys' main attraction is their coffee and pastries collection. I had my sweet buds tested to its ultimate temptations with all the variety of cakes and ice creams. The double chocolate sundae is simply one of my favorites and urge everyone to give it at least a try regardless of the price. 

The sandwiches are also a show stopper of this place. Though I only had it once, never really made it across the breakfast menu, the sandiwches are worth a try. 

Anyone wanting to go for a first date or is in the mood for international style breakfast, the right place to be.....

This was the first and most awaited visit to this renowned place. That day we had no plans for lunch, as we were walking down the street and having different small items frim different places, so we went for cakes and pastries. We took one almond and cheese tart, on black forest and one molten chocolate. We also had a slab of dark chocolate. The pastry and cakes' section is a self servuce one, so after taking the things from the counter we sat on a table nearby, as the seating arrangement for this section was full (capacity : 4 people) and the rest of the restaurant was quite empty. The tart was really delicious whereas the other two could not make up our expectations. Anyways, the foods were overall good enough.

Now let me come to a very serious issue about the place. Two staffs (Intentionally, I don't mention their names) who were attending the tables were ridiculous. At first one of them came and said hello to us, as we sat down and asked what we would take for lunch. As we already took our foods, we said those are enough. After knowing that we were not going to have lunch there, the man started behaving weird, he removed everything kept on the table even the water glasses. Then after few minutes, we asked for some tissues from the second person. He gave JUST ONE but in a weird manner. He just threw the tissue on the table and made a strange face to us. We were very shocked and dissapointed. So we just came out of the place as soon as possible even without finishing the whole food. Now we understand the why they behaved like that way, as we didn't have lunch there and still sat in the main dinning section, they treated us like outcasts. If there is so called "RULE" that the customers from the bakery section can't sit there, then they could separate the bakery part or they could write it in BIG FONTS.

We had a sure plan to go and have lunch there someday, but now we just don't want to enter the place ever. It was a pathetic experience.

Oh my! have visited this Legendary spot on the Park St corner, which declares proudly - Flury's! Being a student of the nearby St. Xavier's College, Flurys had been a no nonsense, any time visit for me. It opens early morning, just in time for a great breakfast when we are busy bunking our oh-so-biring classes. The place is quite spacious, ambiance is decent, and you get to take a look at the busy Park St with those giant glass façades all around the eatery. I really like how the place looks. Coming to food, it's no doubt top notch, screams TASTE & QUALITY. From the toasts to the sandwiches to the pastas or just about amything, you can't really go wrong with its food unless of course you know what you are ordering. I highly recommend this place to any body who asks for a decent place to eat around Park St or even Kolkata. One of my favorite places to eat, filled with memories anf nostalgia😁

How do you rate a place which is an iconic landmark, part of the identity of your city? It is difficult indeed. The old world charm, the colonial feel, great food, and the whole ambiance come together beautifully here at Flury's which is a must visit for everyone with a Calcutta connection. 
I like going to Flury's solo, when I want to sit down with a book or write a new post for the blog or just stare at beautiful Park Street right outside.  The best Caeser salad I have ever had in my whole life is here at Flury's. It is simply out of the world and I keep going back for it. I also like their grilled chicken dishes and the English breakfast is an old favorite. 
Flury's is not just a cafe or restaurant. It is an experience.

Why is mango called the “King of Fruits?” Because it is perhaps the most delicious fruit on the face of the earth that can be eaten much before it has ripened, in its rawest state. Besides, raw or ripe on in different degrees of ripeness, the mango can lend itself to a variety of preparations reflecting different ethnic food habits of people of South Asian countries in general and India in particular. The only problem is that it is seasonal and therefore, cannot be relished in its raw state round the year. But pickle it in oil or mustard paste to make an aam kasundi out of it and there, you have the aam throughout the year! Mango pulp can be converted to mango ice-cream or mango juice or baked into a succulent cheese cake right through the year provided you are ready to shell out the astronomical price. The famous Persian poet Amir Khusrau called the mango Naghza Tarin Mewa Hindustan which means – the fairest fruit of Hindustan!

One of the few reliefs during the sweltering summer months other than the air-conditioning is the mango. As someone says so meaningfully, “What is summer without the smell of spiced, raw mangoes left to dry on the terrace, the chilled mango slices post dinner and mango leather candies soaked in some milk. It is the most versatile fruit of the season and is overrated for a reason.” In fact, our childhood days are filled with memories of sneaking out of school during the short recess to secretly buy raw mangoes on the cut peppered up with salt and chilli powder! ‘Yummy’ is an understatement! In fact, the dictionary does not have the right word to describe what the mango is all about. A burning desire to bite into a raw mango is considered to be a sign of pregnancy for a young married woman. Mango pickles of all varieties form a staple diet for people who love to have their curd rice spiked with mango pickle and it is not an also-ran, it is part of the main menu.

Triggered partly by such nostalgic moments and partly by the challenge of dishing up this king of fruit in all its glory to spread out one of the most sumptuous tables ever, Chef Vikas at Flurys has created the most imaginative menu in town to celebrate the season with a festival aptly named Mango Mania.  I have yet to meet a person who is not passionately in love with the mango. So, there are no two questions about whether this festival will draw foodies across town to cross its glass doors and step inside. 

Founded way back in 1926 by Mr and Mrs J Flury, this tearoom’s name spread like wildfire for its exotic cakes, creamy pastries, rich puddings, rich Swiss chocolates and of course, the all-hour British and/or Continental Breakfast you can dip into and forget lunch. Today, it is an integral part of The Park and  the heritage that Park Street has built over the years, part of history, part nostalgia and part culture. All this has been achieved through Mango Mania with the combined ingenuity, imaginative and aesthetic powers of the management and the culinary skills of Chef Vikas and his team. 

 The mango has been known to Indians since very early times. Scientific fossil evidence indicates that the mango made its first appearance even earlier – 25 to 30 million years ago in Northeast India, Myanmar and Bangladesh, from where it travelled down to southern India. Legend goes that Gautma Buddha was gifted a mango grove so that he could rest under the shade of its spreading branches. The mango tree is an ecological treasure too. 

Let us take a closer look at the very delectable, irresistible and mouth-watering spread laid out in the festival enigmatically names Mango Mania. The King Caesar Salad with Mangoes and Stuffed Mango Mushrooms adds the perfect twist to the summer starters. The Salad is an amalgamation of fresh mangoes with or without bacon depending on whether you are a veggie or a non-veg. Traditionalists might wince at such ‘corruption’ of the holy fruit but what is food without challenging innovations?

For the spicy food lovers they are offering Chicken Wings with Mango Jerk Sauce which is just that much tangy as you need it. Meat lovers will fall head-over-heels in love with the Caribbean Pork Chops with Mango Salsa, all summer long. The amalgamation of the intense flavors of pork and mango is bound to be heavenly. The pork has a mango glaze but could do with some softening because most of us found it too tough to handle without help from an expert to chop it up into bitable slices. Topping a layer of rice, it looked sumptuous but one wishes it tasted that sumptuous too! Of course it would be a big no-no for the veggies but the non-vegetarians who do not relish pork might want to experiment a bit. Last but not the least, with the Fresh Mango Whoopie Pie, Mango and Mascarpone Custard Tart, Glazed Mango Dome and other dreamy mango desserts on the menu you are going have good night’s sleep.

Every Hindu is familiar with the  Purnakumbha, a pot filled with water topped with fresh mango leaves and a coconut, a mandatory part of any Hindu pooja. This ghatam forms the very basis of any pooja because the mango leaves are a symbol of Life. The mango is not just a fruit to be enjoyed and tasted and luxuriated in. It is a part of our cultural legacy and thanks to Flurys for carrying on this tradition and keeping the legacy alive through Mango Mania. The festival ends on June 19 but may be extended if the demand goes rushing up.

Located in park street, beside Au Bon Pain. I have only had their coffee, grilled fish served with fries and pastries. The interiors are really amazing, looks like a 5 star hotel. You will love everything about flurys (ambiance, decor, food, hospitality, etc). Classy, extremely good and posh (words are not enough to describe flurys). A good hangout for Sundays. Will visit again.

A good place to be on Park Street to catch up with friends or do some business meetings out of office over some decent hot & cold beverages, wonderful breakfast and a decent enough lunch.....was there for a business discussion over luncheon and we tried the Grilled Chicken with the Mushroom Sauce and the Veg Stroganoff. Chicken was well cooked however lacked ample seasoning thereby rendering it somewhat bland, sauce was enough and definitely saved the dish, greens as garnish on the chicken was quite too much which I did not like...boiled veggies were just perfect, beautiful, bright and crunchy. Stroganoff was nicely seasoned, creamy and good in taste... the overall dish was decent & sufficient for one person. Cold coffee good, aptly bitter and the right consistency. Darjeeling tea was real Darjeeling, loved...however flies were constant irritant & extremely disturbing...the Manager, Sumanta was fast enough to understand and got the Housekeeping staffs to act in a jiffy...look into the shortcomings as this heritage dine out is so close to our heart and we always love to go back again and again for all the wonderfuls, goods and not so goods.

A stunning place filled with old world charm and amazing scent of delicious freshly prepared food and beverages. The moment you step foot inside. You can feel the heritage it consumes in itself. The sheer amount of clean decor taken from the late 90's and pictures hung from the wall showing what it was like directly teleports you back to its start. 

About the food well. Now they do the best at what they do. The menu is clean and simple and to the point. Filled with lip smacking dishes and beverages and snacks and freshly done pastries. 

Now I ordered my favorite and all time loved English breakfast. The order took some time to come in , but damn was it just absolutely stunning and delicious. 
Great brewed coffee topped it all. 

It's been open since 1927.  And believe me when I say this, this is the best cafe in town   a must visit , go in to consume not only the best food but also the English heeitage and charm. 

Kudos to all. 
If it looks good.  Eat it !!

Again a place visited by me and mom on our weekend exploring Kolkata. This place has a very old, English feel to it. Being here is an experience. Walking in through the very doors you find yourself almost transported back in time to an era where diners were all the rage. We order 2 shakes/smoothies (strawberry and chocolate, don't remember the exact names) and one desert (I think it was a sundae). But regardless, the dishes were excellent and both of us having a sweet tooth enjoyed it a lot. Plus they had display cases full of cakes and pastries, browsing through which was an awesome part itself.

Flurys is a legend in itself. Standing tall for more than five decades in park street, it is always synonymous with legendary food eateries in kolkata. I have been visiting here from a long time specially in my childhood, but with time the number of visits have decreased Hence this review is just based on a single cake which i took from here for a friends b'day . I was in flurys a few mornings ago on a saturday to get a bday cake for my friend. This place on a saturday is always overcrowded and the ambience is hustling and busy. I was stopped right at the entrance, and i had to clarify that I was just for getting a cake when i was allowed. This was very irritating. You just cant prohibit a tentative customer from even entering the shop, just by assuming things. Anywaysl, i took the chocolate hazelnut cake which looked better than the other b'day cakes displayed. It was one pound and the cost was 650. The cake was undoubtedly very good in presentation and the outer texture was extremely smooth and shiny, making it very enticing; but , when the cake was finally cut, the inside of the cake was not soft. It was dr and a bit soggy. But the outside chocolate and hazelnuts were a saviour which overpowered the dryness inside and thankfully the cake was enjoyable. Since i havent tried any of their other dishes in recent times, i cannot definitely comment on them.But my expeience with this chocolate hazelnut cake was a tad bit disappointing.

Flurys in Park Street is an all time favorite for all Kolkata. I have been going to this place for 19 years now, and yet it hasn't lost its charm. Even today the waiters are courteous, even today you'll always find a good crowd even today you'll have a lovely time in this place.

Today, I had asparagus rolls, a classic flurys dish, veg patties, cheese cake and red velvet cake. 
I always order their asparagus rolls, for I am in love with them. Richly prepared bread filler with cheese and asparagus, these rolls are cooked to melt in your mouth instantly. It is the very sudden presence of asparagus which makes it delicious. 
Cheese cakes in flurys are always tasty. I had had my first cheese cake here in Flurys and even till date in savour the cheese cake. The cheese cake has all the requirements of a good desert. 1. Savoury 2.Divine, and 3. Indulgent. The cheese cake is divinely indulging. 
The red velvet cake as always was pretty good. With the rich cream and incisive tanginess the red velvet cake always attracts my attention and I never regret choosing it.

I however feel that over the years their service has slowed down a bit if not deteriorated.

Bon apetit 👌

I had visited this place only once and so am not sure whether I am worth reviewing such a renowned and traditional well known place in the heart of park street. Though I am not a frequent goer to flurys, I have had enjoyed their chocolate birthday cakes. I have become a blind fan of their chocolate pastries.

They surely don't pick their phone up. I wanted to order a cake, but failed to do it online called two times to ask them the procedure. The call was answered the first two time but my order was denied, saying they will not take order on phone so they asked me to send a mail. But didn't receive any respond to the mail , failed to do it online and called so many times but didn't get a respond. You should removed the home delivery option.

Located in park street, this is certainly a very high end desert/ breakfast zone. If you go early morning, you can find luxury vehicles outside, and can make out that this place is a great to have a different experience during breakfast time. The English breakfast is famous. I have had their cheesecake and coffee only and so do not know how the breakfast is, other than knowing that it is really really popular. Also the interiors are amazing, it looks like a 4-5 star hotel, or a big high end restaurant. The desserts are amazing, and i always ordered  one pastry extra to have it in the cab ride back to college.

The people of Kolkata are known for their love for food and good cuisine. Flurys was founded in 1927 and is situated at Park Street and nearby Au Bon pain and Peter cat. 

Flurys is know for its exotic cakes, puddings and pastries. 

Came here with friends on a late summer morning for a brunch. Found it to be spacious. Somehow felt that the staff still thinks that it's British era. 

Ordered beans on toast, scrambled eggs, omelettes, watermelon juice, three layer, flury club sandwich and cold coffee. The food was well prepared and tasty. A little over priced. Would definitely love to come here again to taste rest of the dishes.

Maybe because it is such a hyped place that expectations are always very high from flury's.
Before Au Bon Pain (pardon spelling mistake, if any) opened i stopped going there coz i felt this joint has started to enter that phase where name only matters but not the reason for which the name was earned.Anyhow in recent times the quality has been somewhat restored.
The fault that i still find is the quality of the pastries- the frosting is too heavy sometimes, but maybe thats just me.
Otherwise it is a legendary place, cannot comment on a legacy. Just want a place to be known for its consistent quality, taste along with the legacy it carries- this place has a looooot to live upto, year after year.

The Mango is our National fruit and is popular across the country age no bar. Juicy, delicious and versatile it can be eaten both raw and ripe, cooked and uncooked, paired with savory or sweet. No wonder then it is such a favorite and I am no different. As a child it takes me back to summer vacations at my grandparent’s home in Nasik where there were always a few boxes of Mangoes and our ritual after breakfast everyday was to check all the boxes to see which mangoes were ripe to consume and were put in the refrigerator so we could eat them after lunch. Naturally I was delighted when I was invited to a tasting of Mango Mania which has a menu comprising of Shakes, Soup , Starters , Main Course and Dessert all showcasing the King of Fruits our beloved Mango.

We walked into Flurys a few evenings ago looking for some lovely cake for our friend's birthday. To our bad luck, there were only a few cakes remaining and we were genuinely disheartened to see the remaining cakes on offer. However we did settle for a mocha cake, with butter cream icing.

Once the cake was cut and tuck into we found the actual cake inside to be very dry inside. It was obviously stale and not at all fresh. This kind of mistake is not expected from such a legendary establishment. The butter cream was light and fluffy. It did have the mocha flavor, but if you did not know that it was a mocha cake, you would definitely have had a tough time guessing. Yet, it was the only saving grace for the dry cake below all that icing.

Flurys at Park Street has to be the best Flurys in South Kolkata because (a) Park Street (b) very spacious (c) sitting arrangements

Flurys at Park Street is a little far from your Au Bon Pain.

Food here is like regular Flurys food. They obviously have the best sorts of cakes and pastries available. But besides that, they have a lunch/dinner menu too.

The food is obviously spectacular. But besides that, this Flurys joint is very spacious. It is royally decorated and has feminine accents to complement the decor. The room has a golden but not entirely bright lighting to it, which makes the entire setting very dreamy. There is a very warm ambience to this place. Service is prompt.

Pocket pinch is reasonable. This place should be on your wish list. Bon appetit!

If there is this one place that I love going back to again and again,it's definitely Flurys at Park Street😍 You call it nostalgia,old world charm or the yummy food on the menu,but it has got something that you just feel like revisiting the place once in a while. Though it's a bit overpriced comparing the newly opened cafes but then sometimes you just don't mind to overspend for a good meal! I usually visit for breakfast,this time I tried their American Pancakes which they serve with either bacon or sausages as per your choice,along with maple syrup and butter,pancakes were soft and fluffy,loved every bit of it!! I love the muffins there and their coffee is awesome,we ordered a mocha and a cappuccino☕️☕️ We also tried their eggs on toast which was pretty good,overall a very happy experience!! ☺️☺️☺️

Flury's basks in its 80+ years of tradition in serving the best cakes and desserts in Kolkata. The Viennese coffee, Darjeeling tea and sundae are a special here. 

I keep visiting Flury's every now and then. But this Park Street outlet amazed me the last time I visited - I think they've either changed their decor quite a lot or I've visited after way too long to remember the last time it looked so beautiful.

For any one residing in Kolkata, Park Street is synonymous with good food. And after a tough bout with my REM cycle I managed to visit Flurys during their breakfast servings. I had the English Breakfast and roasted panini sandwich. The food was surprisingly well seasoned specially the hash browns. The panini was roasted adequately and the smell and sharp taste of the cheddar made to the pallette. All in all a very pleasant meal with a wonderful cup of coffee alongside it.

This is how the story goes!
I like Au bon pain, like the ambiance, the food and, the prices. Since that was under renovation, my better half and his best half walked into the "iconic" Flurys with much scepticism.
A bored yet arrogant waiter (Yes, a waiter, coz he doesn't deserve any upgrade on the work tag) met us and guided us to a table.
The ambiance, though quaint and charming, lacks depth.
After the orders were taken (I ordered the cottage cheese steak-ish dish, see the photo of the bill and the dish for further details), we began with the drinks served I. E. coconut water and cheese cake mango smoothie. The coconut water is exorbitantly priced and the cheese +cake, both made their absence felt in the smoothie).

Then came my steak, which was decent, the accompanied water glass reeked of staleness. This is promptly changed with another unwashed glass upon expressing displeasure. So much for hygiene!

The waiter, very heroically, decided it was time for us to give up our plates and picked up the utensils, without so much as consulting us. Hmm.

The story ends, alas, with disappointment and a hole in the pocket.
The means don't justify the end and the end is, well, the end of this restaurant for me.

Pricey, obnoxious, overrated... Thy name is flurys.

If a localalite suggests this as a must eat-at, ignore the fossil and head to Au bon pain next door.

Flurys located on Park Street Calcutta was founded in 1972. The place features one of the finest European traditional confections and has become a popular place for gathering among all ages and cultures. The place was known far and wide for its exotic cakes, creamy pastries, rich puddings and perhaps the best Swiss chocolates outside the European continent, and in no small measure to the relaxed and cheerful atmosphere that it provided. There exists an old world charm of a European Cafe with a homely and calming, trouble free and relaxing space. The most popular breakfast item is the English Breakfast, which consists of Fruit juice, two rashers of crispy bacon, two grilled sausages, one fried egg, one grilled tomato and one hash brown with two slices of toast, butter and tea or coffee.

Flury's has never failed to impress me. 
Their confection is brilliant (you know I'm talking about the black forest). In fact, over years I've always had their food and never was I disappointed.
I've had their breakfast and it's good (really good pork sausage) but some people will find it minimal and simple. Well, that's the way it should me.
Sandwiches are magnificent, people find it very unique, the club ones are awesome and have tons of flavours combined.
The cappuccino here falls a bit flat but it's pretty decent.
Employees are excellent but service takes time.

This place is an iconic bakery/café in the heart of Kolkata. A little small in terms of space when considering there is a huge crowd almost always, the food here makes up for any inconvenience faced. I absolutely loved the English breakfast and the club sandwiches. The pricing is not strictly fair, but I would kill for the food. A perfect place for a lazy Sunday afternoon brunch.

As my three year stay in Kolkata comes to an end; I decided to re-visit all my favorite cafes and bakeries and Restaurants; one last time!
And ofcourse Flurys was one of the top 'Places-to-go'!!
I got my first Flurys Birthday Cake when I was 14 and there was no going back!!
Christmas, afternoon tea, evening snacks or Morning breakfast; Flurys is one if the most loved destination of Park Street.
I do not remember every item that I have had here... So let me just list out my favorites!
First comes the Creamy Chicken and Mushroom toast and The Chicken and Cheese sandwich. These two are heavenly delights for all the Cheese lovers out there!

Yet another very important mention is the American Pancake from the All-Day-Breakfast section.

The grilled Chicken steak that I had was one of the best in the town.

Now; the desserts!!

Chocolate cube and Strawberry cube are all time favorites. The Flurys Coupe is an amazing choice for the ice cream lovers.
I dont remember the names of the other pastries (I usually go and choose the ones that look the best!!)

Oh and before I forget; DO have the Flurys Cream Tea!!

Visited the place twice and tried American Breakfast, American Pancakes, Chicken Mayonnaise and Chicken Mustard sandwiches.  American Pancakes were really delicious served with syrup. Chicken Mayonnaise sandwich will make you fall in love with it. The cakes were also up to the mark.  Without any doubt, the place to have a  good breakfast when in Kolkata.

I think it is needles to say about its location and ambience. It's known as one of the most Heritage Restaurant in Kolkata, standing tall from the ages. Visited numerous times for Cakes and Pastries but recently been there for the Dinner after a match at Eden Gardens. 

We have ordered the non vegetarian soup of the day first. The soup tasted so nice to me that I won't be able to forget it easily. It was a clear soup with small chicken cubes and cubes of various vegetables. Apart from the soup the garlic bread which was served alongside was fabulous.

After that we ordered i) Grilled Fish served with Fries, Steamed Vegetables and Parsley Butter Sauce and ii) Chicken Cordon bleu with sauted potato and mixed tossed salad. 

The dishes were served with conventional bread baskets and butter. The grilled fish was nicely cook yet juicy. The Chicken Cordon tasted good as well. We thoroughly enjoyed. Would like to visit again.

Visited Flurys with someone a couple of days back,  had ordered 1 creamy chicken and mushroom , a  vanilla milkshake, an omelette and a cup of  tea. Food was as usual delicious however the only disappointing thing was the  delay in getting something as basic as tea, everything was ordered together but tea only came after we thought that it had not been written when the order was being taken  and were almost about to ask for the bill. Hence, a -1 in the rating. Please work on this so that I can give Flurys a 5 next time.

So the flurys I once knew is now so much more different than I flurys I visited today. Where do I start.. We asked to shift to seats beside the window and were shifted by a very reluctant manager. Once we shifted, a waiter came and enquired how many of us were there and showed open surprise as to why two people were sitting on a table meant for four. 
We ordered Darjeeling tea, asparagus roll and chicken mustard sandwich. The tea was good.. That's all I can say. I think I can make better sandwich at home.. I mean who takes credit for putting some chicken mixed with mustard in between two slices of toasted bread.. And the asparagus roll.. Well, we had a good laugh over that.. Take an asparaugs, roll it in a slice of bread with cheese spread inside... Need i say anymore after this?
Thank God I was meeting an old friend who's company I enjoy, otherwise the whole evening would've been a disaster.. For those of us who have such fond memories of flurys, this was a real disappointment.

Flurys is probably the most iconic dining establishments in Kolkata.... Originally a tearoom set up the Flury family in 1927,,, it’s known for its fine European confectionaries... Over the years,,, Flurys has expanded to become a full-fledged restaurant while still maintaining its charming European café feel.... Especially legendary at Flurys are their rum balls,,,, scones nd Christmas menu complete with roast turkey nd pudding served during the holiday season....

This was my first visit, went for an evening snack with friends before leaving for college. I am very happy with their spontaneity of services..And the food..it was awesome and very good in quantity. We ordered open chicken and ham sandwiches, chicken sausage, french fries and ice cream...there were 5 of us and we all were more than full. Thus everyone should try the open sandwich if he/ she is a meat lover. And the only problem were it's seating arrangements of couple seats which made the place little congested...rest its well enough for more visits😉

If you are kolkataian and foodie and want to try kolkata's heritage restaurants. You must must must try FLURYS. 
And FLURYS, USP is English breakfast. It's warm sunny morning me with friend went to Ho-chin-min for a work so we decided for a healthy breakfast other than everyday.
We order English breakfast which contains crispy bacon, chicken sausage, fried egg, grilled tomato, hash brown, butter with a warm coffee. 
I don't think that I have to write anything about English breakfast in FLURYS it's a trade mark food in Kolkata (like Peter cats chelo kebab) it's perfect and in morning with a wide view of slow lazy awaking Park Street make it more romantic.

You can never go wrong with flurys ! Its one of the most celebrated heritage restaurant in Kolkata. The location and ambience would score more than anything. Food is standard, though the menu is somewhat limited, many being heritage items. The breakfast is highly recommended. The Mushroom appetizer is really good. Awesome location, great views and they also have one awesome bakery.

I was in Kolkata and in Park Street, a little too early to start drinking. So I decided to head to flurys for tea and sandwiches with a friend mine.

We ordered for a green tea, a cold coffee, a tomato and cheese sandwich and a tuna sandwich.

Now coming to my thoughts of the place. A beautifully done up cafe. The quintessential cafe if you ask me, but for the kind of music they play here. I mean who want to listen to Taylor swift and Justin beiber while having tea? A bit of jazz or any slow music would have been perfect.

Coming to the food,

The cold coffee was decent, nothing out of the world.

The tomato and cheese sandwich was quite alright. Whereas the tuna sandwich was way too dry, I would have loved a bit of mayo to add a little moisture. Where as this sandwich had just tuna in it. 

Overall, not such a bad experience but there are things they certainly need to work on.

Flurys ... This review is not based on a particular visit ! I have been there umpteen number of times. Thanks to my father, who used to bring me and my elder sister occasionally here for English breakfast, when we were kids. Am emotionally attached to this place. Since, I have a sweet tooth , I prefer thi he pastries which are delectable, alongside the ice creams, which they have. My aunt pampered me with this cake on my birthday and needless to say, it was so tasty. Also, one just can't miss Flurys, during Christmas. It's a must visit during the 'Most Wonderful Time of The Year'. :)

A classy place to have breakfast. The ambience is really unparalleled. The ambience is legendary added with the princely aura. You do not have to search a lot to find Flurys. It's a landmark. The flurys club sandwich and hash brown is a recomendation. Ummm...price is a bit high. Service is decent. You should atleast try this place once. I assure you will never get disheartened.

It really hurts me to give a review of 1.0 to flurys. The way it has degraded, or will I say the other shops picked up and exceeded our expectations. Well beans on toast and English breakfast still remains good.
I wanted to order a cake in flurys, was so so very disappointed with the pastries. It seems like a piece of bread and cream. The vanilla, the pineapple tasted awful. The chocolate truffle was so hard we were tempted to ask for a steel spoon to cut through. Add to it the attitude of the staff. Disappointed is an understatement. Avoid

Flurys, the name is synonymous with Park Street. If you are looking for a classy place to have breakfast then this is the place. The ambience is excellent, like the pink & black wicker chairs. Kudos to the maître d' for wearing the pink tie & carrying it with aplomb. Went there for a quick breakfast & ordered my favourite Creamy Garlic & Mushroom on toast & a glass of fresh watermelon juice. This is so yummilicious that I can't help it but have it every time I visit this place. 
Though I find Flurys to be quite overrated & the staff a little snobbish but what can you say!
This is Flurys after all!!!

Flury's?
Do even need an introduction to this Big name ?

If you are in Kolkata you should definitely go and visit this place. This stands with pride in the Park Street Area since the 90's and will definitely lure you inside with the legendary and princely aura of the place. The place still holds strongs just because of the decor and ambience inside. The decor is as regal and grand as it could be.

Flury's at Park Street is well known for their all time favourite breakfasts and the cakes come as a bonus.

CONS: The prices though are a bit exorbitant here and does not justify the service. The staffs can be a little inconsiderate at times.

As my trip to this city was a short one, I was looking up for a place that was famous for breakfast. Few of my friends suggested me this one, so did the locals too. Finally dropped by for a lazy breakfast here and it wasnt much crowded as i was warned of. This place comes in the list of Legendary outlets in the city and the ambience is maintained pretty well to fit in the list.
I ordered for a Flurys all day breakfast with juice. The service wasnt that quick as most of the staff were busy trying to impress the foreign guests and the ladies who were present over there. For the pricing at which the food was served, i couldn't convince myself that it was worth it! Having said that this place is a Legendary restaurant, i couldnt understand if i was expecting too much from this outlet or has the restaurant lost its charm!

Flurys was my go to breakfast joint in Kolkata. But I'm afraid to say that I won't be going there anymore. Reason - pathetic service quality. We got a really rude waiter to begin with and that's not even the worst part. When I showed the manager a big strand of hair in my omelette the manager didn't even bother to apologise. It's really sad to see Flurys go down like this.

Flurys has achieved a legendary status at Kolkata and I must says it is in no way a disappointment. I am noticing really a fan of their chicken panties though I dont like the way it looks. I had tried the Englishes Breakfast once and it wasn't fabulous. Everything on the plate was just amazing! The eggs were perfectly sunny side update, the mushrooms were splendid, the hash brown waste any pleasant delight, the bacon needs no praise as its just amazing and surprisingly I also loved the tomato. I am noticing quite don't on grilled tomato bit somehow with everything else sorry delicious, I even enjoyed having the tomato.
The ambience is quite posh and it is simply stunning. The decorations are quite classy and it just lifts your Spirits! One must definitely pay a visit here for some good quality breakfast. The Princess are high but it's worth it to spend at times and you can definitely spend money on this wonderful place! 

Happy Dining!

I was meeting my school friends after 1 whole year and we decided to begin the day by having breakfast at Flurys which is like a MUST on every foodie's bucket list. 
We had the Heritage chilled coffee sprungli which was heavenly and I recommend it to all. The Flurys mocha was nice as well.
Then we ordered one grilled chicken,cheddar and tomato rellish sandwich and another spicy ground lamb,tomato and cheese melt sandwich. Both were quite heavy and very filling. We liked the grilled chicken sandwich better. 
Flurys is a legendary place in Kolkata that you must visit for it's ambience,and the no-hurry attitude. We sat and chatted for hours,while the authorities were more than happy to let us :)

This popular place has been here since a long long time but does live up to its fame  in terms of the food served.
We ordered the chicken omlette which by the price in the menu seemed a total pinch,however when served on the table ,it pacified the taste buds a little.
The Darjeeling tea tasted great .
The chicken club sandwich calls for some praise .
The bakery adjoint serves a delectable range of confectionary but priced above the local range.
Ambience is good and recommended for a casual hangout.

This was the first place i went to after landing into kolkata in the morning. I had heard a lot about this place's breakfast and it was breakfast time, so i wasted no time in visiting here. The place is about 90 years old and located in the located in the prime park street area . The place is spacious enough and the interior has some colonial influence to it.
Wasting no time, i ordered the english breakfast recommended by the server along with their special tea for me and watermelon juice for my friend who was accompanying me for a short duration.
Our order came and was beautifully presented on the plate with portions of deliciously looking half fried eggs , crispy bacon , well grilled chicken sausages, two pieces of hash browns and one grilled tomato along with bread. I have to tell you , anybody would love to have this breakfast daily . The eggs and sausages were made perfecty and bacon was good. As a tea lover i have tried a lot of qualities of tea and this one was quite good. The watermelon juice was fresh and nice. We also tried one of the dessert from the bakery named horseshoe which was okayish. 
Overall, a very good place place. I would definitely visit again when in kolkata.

Flury's is one of those places which you keep going back to. The decor and the ambience is sure to transport you to some other era. Flury's serves classic vintage food, which is a treat for any true foodie. I personally love the sundaes and the sandwiches. The lunch and dinner menu could do with a little updating. But above all what draws me to this place is the quaint charm and the old world feeling.

A visit to Flury's for its ambience is the FIRST. Once in Kolkata it is more of a landmark than a restaurant. As compared to earlier sloppy service the present service and responsiveness is definitely better, but somehow the nostalgic passing of moments and its aura have recessed. Quality food is decent , even though a few of the new bakeries are tasting and serving, no doubt, better products the name Flury's and the quite okay quality augur very well and becomes such an unforgettable experience that every visit in Kolkata is accompanied with a visit the restaurant. And the other foods except bakery products any day they are DAMN Good and power lunches can be equally inviting for the Executives on the go as well as others. The ideal time for visiting to create a love filled nostalgic feeling would be evening when the saxophone player creates an unforgettable aura about the place.

I would have been very happy to give a five rating but only because of the attitude of the staff I sadly need to deduct one !
So it was my friend's wedding and after being stuffed with lovely bengali food for two days we decided to explore the culinary scene of the ever so famous Kolkata!
Which better place to start the culinary journey than Park Street in Kolkata !
So we found ourselves at the legendary Flurys !
As soon as we entered the place, we were stopped quite rudely by one of the servers and asked if we would like to have pastries or lunch ?
We were three of us and new to the city so Jd not really decided what would we like to eat and without seeing the menu we didn't have any idea about the same, hence we tried explaining this to the person .
However he would not budge and insisted that we must make out order clear before taking a seat in the restaurant!
Now that was quite weird and we found ourselves saying that we would eat as well as order beverages and only then were offered a table !! So that was quite a bad start but things only went uphill when we complained about this to the manager present who understood our plight and was most accommodating.
The food was simply outstanding!
We ordered a sandwich , shakes and cold coffee , pastries and something very interesting that I found on the menu - Peach Melba (A classical dessert that is very rare to find on the menu these days )
So I would definitely recommend  this place to everyone but be sure of what you want to eat before you enter the place !:-)

Have been to this place quite a few times earlier. Today, my friend arranged for some veg patties and Chocolate pastry from this place as take away. Packing was exceptional and I believe that it cost Flurys more for the packaging rather than the product cost (just joking guys!). It seemed so beautiful in their trademark deep pink cartons that we just did not feel like opening them and eat our stuff! 
Nevertheless, we went ahead and unpacked the patty and pastry. The pastry was brilliant – fresh, soft and tasty. Remarkable to see that size was pretty good and 1 pastry just made my tummy full. However, the patty overshadowed all my joy. The stuffing was one of the worst I have ever seen – just not the kind of stuff one expects, especially from a bakery of this rapport. Since, I am not quite a kitchen expert, I don’t know exactly the vegetables which comprised that stuffing,,but whatever it was, it was definitely not edible. I literally ate the patty after removing all it's stuffing. Disappointing to see such a major decline in food quality here!

Coming to the ambience and service, it is always very good and this outlet is quite legendary and one of the most popular restaurants in Kolkata and often crowded. Even my maternal grandfather has been here, which speaks of the legacy attached to this place. Prices are high, but that does not stop customers from hovering at this place!

Request the management to carry on the legacy of this place by maintaining the same food quality!

This place becomes a 'must visit' for the tag name it holds. 
My school was just near to this place and thus paid often visits.
Tried their pastries most of the time and was overwhelmed everytime. Flurys stands apart anyday compared to Mio Amore or Sugar & Spice. They keep a huge range of chocolates during Easter which itself makes it so tempting to visit this place more often. 
0.5 deduction for the price ofcourse. :3
Nevertheless, will definitely suggest you to go and get a guilt-free box of pastry. :)

This place does hold the 'Legendary' tag, but does absolutely no justice to the same. It has become a much over-hyped restaurant with mostly exorbitant prices. Coming to the brand, Flury's is a name many people have grown up with, since their childhood. Standing tall as a landmark bakery shop in the middle of hustle and bustle of Park Street, it has forever been serving quality pastries and delicious food items since ages now.

Even for people staying outside Kolkata, this place is not unfamiliar to them. If you have watched Parineeta, this is one of the two restaurants which got featured in it. As you walk in here, you realize how big the place is. Compared to the overall size, the number of staffs seem less, mainly due to the high service time they take to cater to customers. Sometimes, you keep sitting on the table, waiting for someone to come up and attend you, but no one actually does.

You can start off your day, with their breakfast platter. Although extravagantly prized, it still is one of the major attractions here. Apart from this, sandwiches, puffs and patty are famous here as well. You could very well spend hours here by sipping into some of their trademark coffee along with a bite of their ever famous pastries. Try digging into their chocolate varieties or their cream and nuts ones something which I am a huge fan off!

I haven't tried much continental dishes here apart from their Lamb Lasagna and some Turkey dish, the name to which I do not remember. A couple of years back, me and two of my friends had walked in here to cater to your hungry appetite and ordered for a Lamb Lasagna. The Lasagna was wonderfully done then, probably the best I have had in ages. Full of cheese and sumptuous lamb, the sight of the juice mixing in with the white cheese was an absolute treat. Years later, I order the same item, and I all I get is a washed up replica, much smaller in size with a higher price tag.

It would be a sin to ask people not to visit here. Do come here and enjoy some of the nostalgia buried deep in here, but at the same time also be careful of the items you order for!

Iconic place. Witness to many events and happenings and still trying it's best to uphold the quality and aura of the bygone era. I visit this place occasionally as part of nostalgia and do enjoy their breakfast options, pastries and breads...but somewhere down the line I feel they are struggling to maintain the balance between price and quality  and which is proving to be a boon for new entrants in this category...

Photographs added are of all time fav Black forest and the new molten chocolate

Just visit this place if you want to enjoy the best breakfast in Kolkata, or lunch or dinner. They serve the best pasta both veg and non-veg along with some mouth watering parties and chocolates.
If you are in to coffee ,try their Heritage Chilled Coffee Sprungli.

I have never been to kolkata, but i love flurys. 
My friend gets me goodies from here. 
I absolutely love their cinnamon roll, and the famous chocolatey biscuit dessert that they are famous for. 
I have had the baba cake and muffins as well. 
I love this place and will definitely visit it when i visit kolkata.

Went to flurry's today with my bestie, located at the heart of park street a great place for satisfying your hunger , the ambience is great so is their service ,and that's the reason they have a strong dominance in that region when it comes to breakfast. Ordered chicken and ham club sandwich, chicken croissant ,watermelon juice and finally hot chocolate with whiped cream . The sandwich stole the show ,chicken ,ham,cheese and fresh veggie's is a must try dish. Coming to croissant it had an Indian spicy touch . The watermelon juice was like a oasis in the desert apt for this hot summer eve,the hot chocolate was average .overall a great experience.

Definitely a place to be if you happen to be on Park Street. Apart from the wide variety and finesse in breakfast / cakes / pastry you will surely enjoy its grandeur which is somehow retained from the British Era. The chandelier, seating layout and the entire furniture will surely give you a majestic aura. Relaxed eating with bustling crowd for buying Marzipan eggs, Easter Eggs and pastries is a view to watch when you yourself is not in middle of queue. It was my bad luck that all quiches were over. Hence I have to settle with Almond and Cheese Tart. As expected, experienced refinement in the end product from its quality of ingredients to its subtle taste.
Highly recommended.

Flury's is one of the best slice of the city of joy!! This old heritage outlet of Kolkata ,situated at a prime location at the heart of the city has one of the best breakfast spreads and bakery in the town!!
The food is really good....the ambiance is chirpy and happy...service is appreciable...
If you manage to grab a sit by the glass panes..then the food experience is definitely enhanced...
Definitely give it a try!!

The food was well, mixed. The Eggs Benedict i ordered was amazing while the baked beans on toast that Aarti ordered was definitely avoidable. The cheese croissant was very nice while the muttton puff was avoidable. The coffee mocha was good.

The most alarming part was the dirtiest bathroom i have ever been into. No flush, no water, stinking at 9am! I have been to better loos at the Kharagpur railway platform. They really need to get their act together to remain rlevant with Au Bon Pain nearby.

Oh Calcutta why have you over hyped this restaurant so much?
I entered into this place around 9pm on a Monday night to find enough seating for a football team. So I was expecting to be served pretty quickly. Even though the place was quite empty i had to look around for a table because most of them were quite dirty. After a 20min wait at my table I just gave up and went and took a pastry to go. The tiramisu cake definitely had a touch of the essential tiramisu flavors but was lacking in actual cake. They should probably call it the tiramisu cream bar.
The brownie was a disappointment as well.
The location and ambience are definitely great for date night if you aren't really interested in good food.

An absolute must visit for every tourist in Kolkata. I don't need to say this to a local guy because it is impossible he hasn't eaten here. Excellent spread. Very good service. Extremely humble staff. The food is delightful. Croissants are so light they melt in the mouth. The big breakfast is wholesome and delicious. Desserts do not match up to the expectations set by the food though. All in all a must visit joint.

A place known for its legendary confectionery, a royal heritage and the fine dining. This restaurant finds its place in so many stories and memories of people of this city.
Want to know what to eat? 
Go for the English Breakfast at Flury's. This should be one of the check listed item when you're in Kolkata. 
Moreover you can try their various pastries, cakes, sandwiches and patties. Everything is simply mouth watering. And having all of it sitting in the Stephen's house is in  way living the Heritage of Kolkata.

Hurried in here after a heavy lunch nearby for a quick desert grab. Realized shudve had the lunch at Flurry's itself given their heritage reputation and kickass breakfast/brunch menu.  So, the place is divided in two areas - one for the bakeries and one for the eating section. The place is spacious and with an old school ambience all around it. We straightway ordered the menu favs - the chocolate boat alongwith chocolate truffle pastry and chocolate cube and choco rum balls.
All of them tasted super yum. The boat esp was unique with a chocolaty spread over crispy biscuit. The cube version which was creamily fab as well.. was there even in pineapple and  butterscotch options. Shud try them out next time. With

If any institution tastes success and establishes itself as a giant in the field, very soon a question arises: For how long? A great institution is always wary of this question as competition is always cut throat in today's market. 

I happened to visit Flurys on Saturday, 11th March evening. I ordered corn puffs which were freaking cold. Sweet pastries taste better when cold but not puffs. This is elementary. The puffs were tasty and hence the three star but again why would you serve them COLD? I would like to visit the place again though.

But still I shall go forward with mine. I had an Omelette with chicken and ham and then The rum ball. Simply Great. The English Breakfast in the morning with the chocolate truffle. Amazing. Ambience is naaice. Service is good. A nice and a delectable experience it was.

This is the third time I visited this place and coincidentally each time it was a Sunday Morning.

If you are planning your Sunday breakfast in Flurys you better have time in your hand - waiting time may be from 20-40mins depending on the rush.

The security guard wouldn't take your cell no and you have to stand there in front of the gate for him to call out your name.

One of the oldest place in Kolkata to have your breakfast and the decor of the place suits its heritage with chandeliers and ceiling fans. White and off paints on the wall.

We ordered 
English Breakfast - Grilled Chicken Sausages (2), Fried Egg (2), Crispy Bacon (2), Grilled Tomato and Bread Toast (2 slice) with your choice of Juice (in fresh juice they had only Watermelon and Coconut Water - we opted for Watermelon juice)
Joggers Breakfast - Grilled Chicken Sausages (2), Omlette, Crispy Bacon (2), Baked Vegetable hash brown and Bread Toast (2 slice) with your choice of Juice (in fresh juice they had only Watermelon and Coconut Water - I opted for Watermelon juice)

Food is no doubt very good and they have maintained their standards. Also I have previously have had their patties and all from take away counter inside the restaurant which is also very good taste wise.

They need to improve on their service a bit, shouting on junior surfers by a senior surfer in front of customer while taking orders is definitely not cool. But these are trifles and shouldn't discourage you all to have you visit this place again and again.

So Flurys, Park Street outlet was a strong recommendation to me by a few friends during my Kolkata Visit in November 2015.
Evidently, it is a Renowned Restaurant, for its existence over last 8-9 decades!! And it just didn't disappoint even a bit.
I initially experimented with Rum Ball and BlueBerry Cheese Cake on my first visit. And OMG, every bite would just melt over in the mouth. Another visit materialised the day after morning for the English Breakfast, which again lived up to its expectations.
A must for all the visitors!!

An one-time institution, the changes here are a little difficult to digest. While the ambience and cleanliness are much better now, can't say I have the same enthusiasm about the changes to the menu. The menu seems to have been pared down by a lot, and I am not sure that is a good thing.  

Visited after more than 2 decades! Ordered a standard chicken dish while a friend ordered an open sandwich. The chicken and fries were good, but the sauce was underwhelming. Friend's open sandwich didn't really look appetising but he did give it a thumbs up.. Coffee was good. 

All in all, have to admit I liked the taste from way back, but the current ambience of the place is nicer. Odd to have reached an age where I have started reminiscing about the past :(

Went to Flury's for a cup of tea in the evening. We ordered Darjeeling tea, chicken mustard sandwich and assorted pastries.. The food was good and tea as usual superb! But the place was buzzing with flies all over. We felt as if we were sitting on a open drain instead of a upmarket restaurant. As I have been going to this place for the past 50 years it really hurts me to see how the place has deteoriates over the years in service. I will have to find another tea place in the Park Street area.

Very English :) The pinks everywhere makes the place very 'pretty'. My favorite here is the chocolate cube - they are just too good.

Try the English breakfast , it's quite nice. If you happen to be in Calcutta you cannot miss this place

I had this craving for pancakes one morning. So, I dragged mum with me to Flury's. 
I haven't regretted a craving more.

The pancakes were floury to say the least. 
The bacon wasn't warm rather was odd tasting and cold. It felt like eating rubber (No, I haven't had rubber before). 

To top it all, my mum's cappuccino was too creamy and we shelled out an insane amount of money.

Dessert review: This place serves great pastries and cakes, hence living to its legacy of being one of the oldest cakery in Kolkata. Located right in the middle of the Park Street, this place has a lot of variety and enchants the sweet taste buds like a boss.

I'm taking away one star for the super lousy cash counter system. The location of the cash counter at the corner is very odd. Nevertheless great pastries !!

Always thought of it as regular restaurant chain, but seeing the waiting line and crowd inside changed my mind a bit. Seems like it's been a hang out place for many during their teen years. Anyway, decided to explore what the fuss was all about. 
To an outsider, there was nothing special in the food.  We ordered chicken mustard and egg mustard sandwiches. They were good but nothing extraordinary really.
The service boys seemed very busy but the service eventually was quite slow, especially considering the number of people in the waiting line.
My experience with part street flurys: Just alright, food and service wise, not worthy of the hype.

Went to Flurys after a long time, waking up early on a Sunday morning, standing in queue for 30 mins, all for the delicious secret ingredients of their beans on toast.....
Well, the secret is gone. What we got was a regular can of beans poured over soggy bread. The mushrooms on toast wasn't up to the mark with the mushrooms floating around in the cream sauce. 
The cold coffee was pretty regular.
Overall, really disappointed with the food of this landmark joint. Hopefully they work towards improving the quality to get that old taste and charm back.......

It has been a legendary place in Kolkata. I tried this place for the first time 4 years back and since then it's quality has drastically deteriorated. The bakery and confectionery stuff used to be amazing but now a days it feels as if it has been made using cheap ingredients. I wish to try their breakfast someday but couldn't get a chance to be there so early.
For the people who are visiting Kolkata as tourists, they should definitely give it a shot because there are really very few good options in this city.

What i did not like was the quality of bread they used as it was hard to break or chew.... I have had much better and softer breads that just melt in your mouth....

Flurys is nostalgia.  It's very difficult writing a review for a place which has been part of your very sense of self.  In few words I love the place.  From the ambience to the food to their fuchsia pink sweet boxes it just takes me to my wonderland.  Lovely sandwiches,  eggs benedict and their amazing English breakfast.  And more wonderful is the feeling of being part of a legacy.

Flury's is all about Park Street, Kolkata & nostalgia. A place where automatically you will find peace, it will make you feel good. Sandwiches & pancakes are too good. A special mention to deserts, specially I love their cheesecake, so damn tasty ! And of course Darjeeling tea, my all time favorite ! Although a bit expensive, but its an experience ! Either for breakfast, or for desert after dinner in any other Park Street restaurant - Flury's is a must visit place ! 
Recently visited after a long gap. Have tried chicken meyo sandwich, iced lemon tea, red velvet cake, chocolate tiramisu. Everything was fine except sandwich which was little chewy.

One of the Few Places to enjoy a proper English Breakfast in Kolkata. 
We had to wait for a while on a Saturday Morning but nothing not worth the food inside. 
The food did not disappoint.
 We had the English Breakfast which came with an option of either Watermelon or Coconut Juice, we chose the former. It consisted of bacon strips, sausages, two eggs, sautéed mushrooms and toasts. Quite fulfilling for one. 
We also had the open Swiss Sandwich which had shredded chicken with veggies topped with ham and sunny-side up egg. 
Overall the food was on the lower side in terms on salt, the English way i guess, but they have salt and pepper on the table, so wasn't a big issue. 
Overall a nice experience with a elegant ambiance and delicious food.

I have been visiting Flury's since my childhood. And all I can say is that it's an amazing place. Inside it smells like a bakery(which it originally is) and it looks classy and ethnic and everything on the menu is superb. My personal fav is Stuffed Non Veg Omelette and Plain Cake with Hot Coffee. 
Well trained staff and long variety on the Menu will keep you coming back to try newer things.
You might find it a little on the expensive side but its worth it.
Memorable place.

The most delicious breakfast in the world-- Cheese, mushroom and asparagus stuffed three-egg omellate with toast, an insanely thick and creamy Coffee Sprungli which I tried on the insistence of their very courteous and knowledgeable manager. Try their dry cakes too- Vanilla, Fruit and my favourite-Plum. Flurys' Lemon Roll's got to be the best- light, fluffy with a sweet-tangy elusive umami quality. A must try.

A must visit for anyone who is visiting kolkata or would like to immerse oneself into culinary delight of the sumptuous desserts. A solid 4.5 if not 5.0 for the dent in the pocket made to pay for the extravagance lol ))) ^-^

This should be one of top list brunch place. Omg one of the oldest bakeries and we'll known for its rum ball, éclairs, mutton patty.But above all for  sleepy bum like me who prefer brunch to anything else shud take up a seat by window and just enjoy the English breakfast and satisfy yourself having heartfelt food even though ur still  nt in uk but who cares as long food can keep my mind in peace. He hehe. Restaurant nt being so much dramatic as me but still maintain its originality and ethnicity even after long yrs, nt so much on variety side.

A classic place not only in Park Street but over all of Kolkata as well. Some of the items on the menu are fantastic but a lot of them fall way short of the mark in terms of taste. As near regulars, we are quite upset to see that their food quality is slowly deteriorating and wish that they improve their food standards - particularly their menu items.

We are die hard fans of their milk bread and cinnamon rolls.

After a sumptuous lunch in gabbar's we landed up in flur's for some small talk over coffee. And we definitely made the right decision ! Contrary to the modern cafeteria coming up flury still has the old park street nostalgia to it! Be it the decor or the location (prefer the window side tables) which gives a nice view of the passing crowd and traffic through park street. But the one thing that's definitely remarkable here is the no rush attitude of the staff! Highly courteous and efficient! You'll get plenty of time to catch up without being pressured to order something more! Coming to the coffee we had flury's latte which was creamy and delicious! Also tried their heritage section which is filling. Next time will make it for the full English breakfast!

This rating could go all the way up to a 100, if there was an option. But but but. Why is that all the stuff I rave about are mostly unavailable? They should stock up on their chocolate offerings and patties and quiches. That apart, I'm good with their generous serving of beans on toast, Darjeeling tea, and a bustling park st view from one of their corner seats.

This place is one our best and favourite places to have a continental breakfast. One thing about this place which can be taken as a positive as well as a negative thing is that the place has not changed. Some of the items on the menu are classics like the baked beans and buns. Their cinnamon rolls are to die for. However their vegetarian food items are a bit limited. 

In the recent times, we have reduced our visits to this place as the food quality has suffered a bit. Its like the staff are just going through the motions. They need something to spice up themselves again. Maybe a live counter for food - an omelette station to go and directly place their orders or a grill section or a pancake and waffle station.

I still do not know why and how....but in all the time that I have spent in this city this was only my second visit to this iconic place. I had set my sights beforehand on the English breakfast and I was not disappointed. The bacon....The sausages....all of it left a great taste in the mouth. Ambience is as good (as expected), the service is exceptional (as expected). Will definitely try out the other stuff in the near future. This institution of Kolkata has stood the test of time and will continue onwards on its journey.

I visited this famous joint on this new year.  I was with my friends and as it was 1st Jan it was very crowded.  We had to wait around 1 hour to finally get a table. That day was a self service for the pastries as it was very crowded  but the other eatables were served. We ordered triple omelette with mushrooms and toast, chicken wings, coffee and pastries. Loved the omelette and the chicken wings but was a little disappointed with the pastries. They were a little dry for me and also there weren't many varieties to choose from, just 3-4 types. Enjoyed the ambience of the place and special mention were the chandeliers. And the last thing this place will definitely bore a hole in your pocket. But overall a great experience.

I ordered a cup of Darjeeling tea. Probably the best Darjeeling tea I had in a long long time. 

Paired it up with multiple cake varieties. Each one was heavenly. Simply melts in your mouth.

In a typical indian city, you find more coffee shops. So finding nice tea becomes more and more difficult. But Flury's lices up to its expectation. Zero compromise on quality. Excellent tea, cakes and pastries.

I guess this is what people mean by old is gold. Exceptionally warm and exhilarating decor with excellent service. While some items, such as the breakfast spread, are quite expensive, there were many other food items that are quite inexpensive. Had pretty good quiche for just 33 bucks. This makes the clientele quite exhaustive. Would definitely recommend the place for dessert (pear belle helene), coffee (mocha especially), chicken patty and of course, the breakfast spread.

The legendary Flury's, its almost a shame that I have missed reviewing this place for so long. Oh only to think of the sheer number of times I have spent 1-2 hours in this restaurant, starting from their amazing bakery goodies to the delectable breakfast menu and evening snacks. Over time, I have tried the English Breakfast, Eggs Benedict, American Pancakes, Original Chicken Puff, Chicken and Mixed Capsicum Envelope, Chicken Masala Patty, Chicken and Mushroom Quiche, Chicken & Cheese Sandwich, Tuna Sandwich, Egg & Mustard Sandwich, Three Layer Sandwich, Spicy Ground Lamb Sandwich and God remembers what else! I love Flury's, love their food, love the ambiance, the crowd, the service, everything to do with it. Nothing can beat heading for the breakfast on a Sunday morning, such a good start to the day. For foodies like me, Flury's is an absolute must.

It's a name which is almost synonymous to the kolkata food scene, since ages. I love visiting this place for the feel more than the food itself. Not too fond of the old fashioned, overtly sugary pastries. But do love their pancakes!

To me, flurry's is one of those overhyped places that survive mostly on past grandeur and reputation. I read about Flurry's in every food article written about kolkata! And believe me, I've really tried a lot to like the place ! But I've failed.... Sigh ! Time and again I've failed to c what makes flurry's a Kolkata legend! I've had pastries  much much better than flurry's in other bakeries in Kolkata. 
Yeah sure it looks fabulous and the ambience is awesome and u c the "right" kinda crowd It does LOOK like an iconic pastry shop. But it has failed to deliver the goods. 
Im not gonna write about anything specific cuz I've not tasted one thing that I wanna write about. Oh! How about the pineapple pastry that my friend was dying to taste but found so dry that he couldn't even finish it? Nah.... Don't wanna talk about that either 😜

This place had been recommended by all who knew that I am traveling to Kolkata. Could not find time for breakfast but had lunch here.

1. The place is easily identifiable on a busy Park Street road. Everyone knows where to find it. Ambiance was good. Wooden furniture all over, the tables somehow appeared to be laid in random manner.

2. The place is really high on cleanliness. The napkins, cutlery, floor, table were absolutely clean.

3. The service is average-good here though the turn-around-time is good. The waiters are not really engaging and purely transactional.

4. I tried chicken curry of the day with rice. Butter chicken was really yummy but lacked adequate curry to be consumed with rice. My friend tried something in beef and it tasted equally good.

The quantity served per individual meal was sufficient for 1 person.

Another special point for this place is the crowd which walks in. You will find half the tables occupied by our foreign guests. It's kinda Kolkata's fav place.

It's really pricey !

By far the best culinary experience in Calcutta. The food is outstanding in terms of Presentation and taste. I ordered a chicken steak and it was fresh and juicy. The sauce was rich and tasteful. Prawns tasted fresh as well. 
Apart from the food, this intimate place provides a very homely environment. 
Although the staff isn't on their toes at all times, slow service. 

I suggest everyone visits this place if they are in Cal.

Take a Step back in time... Breakfast like a king.. is a phrase for this place. Decadence in food is what flury's symbolizes. No holds barred. At 9.30 AM monday morning, if there is waiting outside a restaurant, then it must have something good to offer!!. It lives upto all expectations. Whatever else you eat, do not miss the Eggs benedict , the french toast, chocolate mousse & cuppacino. Desserts are ofcourse outstanding and superbly rich. Efficient service, busy atmosphere , lots of food energy. Do not miss in kolkata.

The best confectioners in town .. Hands down ,  and  it serves confectionery of premium quality,  right from vanilla, strawberry cube cakes to their plum cakes ..its heavenly, their oven baked pasta is really well cooked and complements well with chocolate balls cake.  Although, they need to revamp the look of the entire place and think about the ambiance of the place. Overall, nice place to sit and chat  and refresh your old memories.

This is a place that every Calcuttan knows and has grown with. This iconic restaurant is at Park Street, and is hard to miss! I've always gone to Flury's for that special cake or pastry, the amazing bread and chocolates to take to friends in Chennai. Before this Christmas eve, I had never been there for an actual meal. So, come Christmas when everyone's celebrating at Park Street, I decided to head over to Flury's for a meal with my friend. We were just two, so we got a seat quickly and didnt have to wait in that long line of people wanting to eat the Flury's special Christmas meal. We usually prefer veg and so we didnt try the turkey!

Ambiance (4/5) : This is something you have to give it to them, maintaining the old Calcutta charm. The pretty lights, the white and the beige, the very exquisite and elegant logo, the style of seating, all give off a very British vibe and Flury's while sitting on Park Street, now, doesnt seem to belong to this era. The dining and the bakery are well segregated. This helps the waiters on waiting at the tables and also the people dining who dont want the hustle bustle to disturb their meal.

Service (2/5) : The staff at Flury's have become less and less polite. They are courteous, dont get me wrong, but their way of speaking and treating people at the bakery or the dining is not pleasant. Otherwise, the service is quick and efficient.

Food (4/5) : I need to mention stuff from the bakery first! You must must have the bread from here. Its soft and fluffy and one of the best breads I've ever had. Milk, garlic, masala, take your pick! The pastries - pyramid, boat, truffle, or pie, or mousse. All are amazing. The chocolates are brilliant too! Flury's has these gift pouches and boxes that you can give away, its always nice to give that off to your friends and family. The coffee here is good too. As for the food, I took the baked spinach cannelloni with garlic bread and my friend took the cottage cheese skewers with vegetables, accompanied with salsa and herbed rice. We also got some extra fries and garlic bread. The portions were a little extra for us, but maybe we just didnt have a huge appetite that day, but Im sure otherwise, its good enough for one person. I loved my garlic bread. The cannelloni was baked nicely and spinach was cooked well. The cottage cheese was really soft and the salsa was really really nice. I really liked my mocha. The cold coffee my friend took was a little too sweet for me. 

Vfm (3/5) : This is an expensive place, both the bakery and the dining. My father never took me to Flury's except on special occasions. Even for our food, the bill was a lot. Now, I was particularly disappointed at the service. Given any other day, when it would be less cramped, and with better service, I'd be pretty happy with this place and would recommend it to anyone who wants to revisit the Old Calcutta once again. A must visit for everyone, if not for the dinner, definitely for the bakery and some coffee.

Visited there after a very long time in a December morning of 2015. It was around 8:00 AM. Few visitors, couple of them are guests from other countries visiting India. Couple of old Calcuttans with Victorian gentlemanship. A light christmas carol being played. Large glass windows, nice decor inside instantly gives me a mood that was missing for me for a very long time. 

I was hungry. I was walking for last 90 minutes in Kolkata Maidan, and now I need a heavy breakfast. So I ordered for English breakfast. It comes with a fruit juice, toasts, butter, 2 fried eggs, sausages, bacon, mushroom, hash brown and a grilled tomato. The juice they served was of watermelon. I do not know how they managed watermelon in winter, but it was not canned juice. It was fresh and worked very well on me after the long 90 minutes of brisk walk. It took them around 10 minutes to serve the breakfast.

The toasts were a bit crispy, but I like toasts that way. Perfectly fried eggs with sunny sides up. It looked so beautiful, that I took some time to break it. Sausages were perfectly cooked and piping hot, like everything else in the plate. But above all, I liked the bacon. It has been years that I had good bacon anywhere. This one brings out my sweet memories from San Francisco in 2007. I used to go to Deli type joints on every Sunday morning.   

mushrooms were juicy inside and has lots of flavor. That means they were very fresh.  A perfect hash brown with good crispy texture outside and tender inside. I took around 15 minutes to complete the serving. An aged gentleman was having Egg Benedict, another superb item at Flurys. But I have my stomach filled up like a loaded truck. Cannot take anything, not even tea. So I planned to take some bakery items home. I took few Croissant and few pastries. Pastries are excellent, but believe me, the Croissant is unbelievably good. You just need to take a bite, and it reveals 10 more hidden layers inside. so fresh!!

I like to visit it again and again. The given photo is of the "Joggers Breakfast", the low cal version of English Breakfast.

Flury's, the love of Calcuttans and Park Street's favourite restaurant. This place is a sign of happiness. Great aura and the soft music is an extra add on to the good mood. The waiters are absolutely gentle. In fact, they guide you through the menu quite well, not pushing you towards the expensive dishes. They exactly know what you want.  In my opinion, I feel it is ideal for breakfast. The pancakes are definitely the dish to be tasted. It makes you want to eat more with the melted butter. Damn! And, the sausages with the crispy potatoes will keep your tummy over loaded. I promise. Not to forget, the long and absolutely less oily french fries is mandatory. Lastly, the cold coffee shake with these is an ultimate bliss. Alone or with family, a breakfast is a must in Flury's. They won't let you down. I bet.

So I've always made it a point to visit Flury's whenever I come to Calcutta just out of fondness. However, this evening's experiences are liable to turn me against the establishment permanently. Not only was the service and behaviour of the wait staff perfectly lousy during our meal, I came back home to find that the 'rum and raisin' cake I had purchased had a STONE in it! 
It's terribly sad for many of us to come to terms with the fact that Flury's has just let the ball drop on all accounts as a quality food joint, which is a shame. 

PS: the black foreign object in the foreground is the stone. It looks deceptively similar to the raisins. Fortunately didn't ingest it.

Taking down the rating from 5 to 1, after my recent experience.
Utterly disappointed to see such deterioration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
One of the pioneer confectionery of Kolkata catering people with its exclusive preparations of confectionery and breakfast dishes since ages.
And so far my preference is concerned, since my childhood, my Christmas celebration is incomplete without Flury's.
Each and every item bears a signature taste which leaves you utterly delighted and mesmerised.
Brownie, chocolate truffle boat, vanilla cube, almond cube, and the list goes on and on which is sure to increase your appetite with its appealing look and leave you mesmerised with its mouth watering taste.
And off course, do try their darjeeling tea, English breakfast and bread basket once.
A must visit for everyone.

I personally like the peaceful ambiance. Their open sandwiches specially that with the bacon,cheese one was very tasty and stomach full. Another one 6 inch closed lamb sandwich was really good. Their chicken wings was little hard. I did not like that. Overall friendly staffs abd good for spending some time with family and close ones.   I had their ENGLISH  BREAKFAST too. Becons were too salty. But I hope it was an exception on that day. The watermelon juice was really freshly made and no bottled or canned material was served. Breads were of very good quality. I thoroughly enjoyed.

Tad too expensive and a burden for the middle class families. With dessert cakes and shops like Mio Amore, Sugar N' Spice and Kathleen round the corner, the high price is a sort of tight compensation for the amazing quality of food.

Christmas Night and this place seemed to be overflowing with people. This was my wife's first visit to the City of Joy- Calcutta and she wanted to taste the best pastries and what better than Flury's on a Christmas Night. Late in the night, they were only selling Plum cakes and only pastry available on the 25th was BlackForest. With so many people making a bee-line we decided to just order a takeaway. The pastry was bliss, melted in the mouth and soothing it offers to the taste buds are no match. 
P.S. I have promised my wife for breakfast date at the Flury's.

I've  been in Kolkata for six years, yet my first visit to flurrys was post Christmas this year. I went there as a customary thing to do after Christmas for lunch. Now, it didn't meet upto my expectations. Ordered from the Christmas menu; turkey , pork chops and stuffed chicken breast and a Christmas pudding for dessert. The taste was okayish (I've had better conti food elsewhere) and the pudding wasn't upto my liking at all. Overall, the ambiance and the cakes are what makes flurrys special. So its better to go for tea and cakes and pastries.

It' christams and if you are in park street, there is no way you can ignore Flury's! So going by the rulebook, we went here for a post lunch dessert session.

Now with heavy heart, I have rated 3, because my earlier encounters are worth of 4/5 stars.
We ordered pineapple pastry, black forest and choclate mousse. The mousse was fantastic, not too much sweet, had choclaty punch and nice creamy texture. But both the pastries were real disappointment. Cream was fresh and nice, but the cake was not at its best. Texture was not that much soft, feeling like it was made a day before or some problem with baking.

May be next time I will avoid these festive rush to get the real taste from this legend!

Went at the christmas eve with a lot of expectations
Ordered from the christmas special menu
Turkey combo
Roasted turkey and a dessert which was priced 960
What could have been better than a roasted turkey and a christmas pudding at the chrisymas eve ?!
To my utter disappointment , the turkey wasnt properly cooked .. the pudding was toooo small and nothing overwhelming
The hot chocoate was too milky and of thin consistency
Like expected , it was a bit too crowded today.. waited an hour for the special christmas dinner only to disappoint myself
To this visit to Flurys( which never disappoints).. i would never come back here during festivals atleast.

The phrase 'stuck in time' is aptly used for this cafe. From the decor to the food to the staff, the place takes you back to the 1950's. The moment you step inside, time slows down..!

If you compare the quality of service to the present restaurants, then it seems very bad because the staff is extremely slow. But that is the charm of this place. You go there, sit, order and wait for the food to come, and then wait another half hour for the cheque to reach your table. Totally worth a visit for nostalgia sake.

Heard a lot about this place so had to give this place a try. The place is located at the best possible place in the Park Street area. The pastries and coffee was amazing & the ambiance was great too. Try visiting this place in the evening when the whole street is bustling with people going up and down the street and the whole place takes on a very heavenly look. Go there for a fantastic experience.

Flury's is one of the most famous places in Kolkata as it exist since early 19th century. Being so old the place has the authenticity from the British time . Ambiance is lavish unlike today"s coffee shops ,with  huge ceilings and wooden finishing . Food is good , not that great. I ate egg benedict , it was good but the bacon which came along where disappointing . I loved their hot chocolate , must try . The overall experience being there is nice as the place lie in the heart of city , so i would recommend if you are in Kolkata , have  cup of coffee at flury's for sure.

I can't decide which was worse - the scraped-from-the-bottom-of-the-barrel food, or the surly, slow, unbelievably arrogant "service".

I was excited to visit the "legendary" Flurys on my recent visit to Kolkata, despite many of my local friends warning me about its sub-standard food and experience. Mea culpa. 

The table setting was dirty, and it took us 15 minutes to finally get a waiter to our table. His demeanor was surly and disinterested from the get go. You'd think we were making a major imposition on his evening routine of standing around doing nothing by placing an order. We asked for two glasses of water, the mutton puffs, the spinach quiche and asked for a pastry recommendation. "Are mutton puffs available right now?", HE asked ME, which I found rather strange, considering he worked there and I was merely reading off the menu. "Umm, how can I find out", I asked. "Go find out from there", he quipped rudely, pointing to a station containing pastries and other items. Er - why hand me a menu if I've to corroborate the availability of every item at some display? And why didn't he already know if they'd run out of the items on the list? It wasn't like there were that many. 

Anyway, I did check, and as it turned out, they did have mutton puffs and quiches and since the waiter seemed utterly disinclined to make a pastry recommendation, I thought I'd order the Triple Chocolate Torte as well. 

The mutton puff and quiche arrived 15 and 20 minutes later respectively, which is strange because the items were Right. There. Now any decent mutton puff has a nice, flaky crust housing a soft mutton paste within. Not this one. This was stone cold, and by stone cold I mean hard as a rock, and nearly frozen. The paste was a congealed mess that looked and tasted horrendously stale. The quiche was equally terrible. The water still hadn't made an appearance. 

The pastry never came. When I asked about it, the waiter told me that I clearly had not checked if it was available at the display (I had, and it was available). "I did, and it is available", I responded. "No it's not, you can go see", he announced defiantly. So I led the way to the counter, and of course there stood a dozen pastries right there in plain view. The man didn't even have the grace to look remotely apologetic.

Ten minutes later he slammed the pastry down on our table. I haven't had a worse pastry in the last ten years. The cream was stale, and the pastry wasn't even chilled. We'd given up on the water by this time, which was a pity, because I'd have liked to wash down that awful pastry with something. But then we didn't wish to engage with the waiter any more than we absolutely needed to. 

I was hardly surprised when I threw up later that evening due to an upset stomach. 

Do yourself a favor folks, and avoid this place like the plague.

BREAKFASTS ARE REALLY WORTH HAVING WITH GOOD VIEW OF EARLY MORNING PARK STREET.
SANDWICHES ARE JUST AWESOME.DURING LUNCH PASTA IS AVAILABLE WHICH NEEDS SPECIAL MENTION.
WHENEVER AT FLURY'S I SIGN OFF WITH A PASTRY AND A CUP OF DARJEELING.

Have been there many times, and have some memories attached to this place. While I was a kid and walked down the park street with my Mom, I always used to look at the people having food inside this place.  What I was used to receive from Mom was 4 pieces of pastry and that too after a lot of nagging. As I have already been to this place for quite few times, I will pick up the recent experience for this review. Things change over time..I was in park street for a meeting with a client and decided to have the breakfast here a couple of days back. 

Ordered English breakfast, the sausages I simply can't forget the taste of those, if you like bacon, I would say this is one of the best places to have it. simply loved the breakfast and then there was something more. The hot tea, its was a pure bliss I would say. Starting from the pastries to there breakfast, all of them are really good.

One of my favorite places in the city. Is pite of Flurys being there for ages, I never got the opportunity to visit although I have had their pastries. It was last month when a friend took me there during lunch time. The minute I entered I loved the ambiance. My friend had a cappuccino while I ordered their grilled fish with french fries and veggies on the side, along with two dinner rolls. The fish was so tender and the lemon butter sauce gave it an amazing flavor. Later on my friend and I craved our lust for pastries which too were oh-so-sweet. I have been to a lot of cafes but I always feel like coming back to Flurys. The next thing I want to try is their English Breakfast, Eggs Benedict, French Toast, and I can go on and on and on.

Located at the poshest place of Calcutta, Flury's has things going for its location, feel and ambience rather than its food. I definitely prefer the savoury items over the pastries. I think Flury's should definitely give a thought to reinventing the  pastry section. However, be sure that nothing you order would be bad. It would just be average.

We weren't very hungry, when we walked across Flury's, but had to give this place a try - during our short visit to Kolkata. The whole street is very famous and blingy of course - but the location of Flury's is especially good, and so are its interiors. We tried the veg soup of the day and a chocolate biscuit pastry - both were very good. But service was a little bit of a let-down - the staff seemed peevish and not-so-welcoming. Prices might be a little high. Good experience apart from that.

Caesar salad - good. Tea - bad. Well that sums up the Flury's experience. A lazy evening tea, lots of talking and a small meal, thats all I looked forward to. I ordered an Earl Grey tea while my wife ordered a Orange Spicer tea. Was quite surprised to be served Typhoo branded tea which is easily available online or at Park St Oxford for ₹250 for 25 teabags....and I here I was paying ₹130 for one cup i.e. one tea bag. I sincerely expected something exemplary. Anyways, then we ordered a Caesar salad. The salad was good. Lettuce was not 100% fresh but good nonetheless. Its ironic that the only salad option was Caesar salad whilst the menu had atleast 3 other options as well. Certainly not mark of a legendary cafe. The only upside..a good evening conversation. Now I am planning on making the Joggers breakfast at home than visit Flury's for it. It was also surprising that the man could not even give me a proper timing when the famed "baba cake" hits the shelf each day.

Kolkata's favourite breakfast joint for so many years. Situated in the corner of park street is the restaurant to go have an authentic English breakfast. Delicious savoury and sweet bakery dishes along with eggs, bacon, sausage, beans on toast, coffee, tea and cupcakes. Everyone has something to choose from. The waiting line outside the restaurant shows how running the place is. If in kolkata one must definitely have breakfast here.

Located amidst tonnes of eateries, fast food joints, mithai shops on Park street is this fancy looking confectionary - Flury's. 

Having bookmarked this place, during my recent trip to Kolkata, I got here with the intention of checking off the box. 

Flury's is one historic confectionary and tea room in Kolkata open since 1930s? The interiors do have an old world charm to it  - High ceilings, huge chandeliers, wood panelled walls, porcelain tea sets on the table etc. I quickly took some pics of neatly arranged cakes, croissants and gift boxes and had a quick chat with the waiters around. Then placed orders of - chocolate cube, coffee butterscotch cake and crunchy garlic filled mushroom with mayo. The cakes looked moist and the crunchy mushroom looked, crunchy. The taste was basic, absolutely nothing to rave about. Mushroom seemed to be plain fried with a coat of batter and the cakes were extremely dry from the inside and I wondered I have eaten better cakes at regular bakeries. The price seemed outrageous for what I ate, consoled myself for having been able to get some air conditioning inside a good looking eatery  amidst scorching Kolkata street.

I would still call this a very disappointing experience!

When you are looking for a place to have good breakfast after a long morning drive, Flury's is just the place! We had both the English and the Jogger's breakfast and the English breakfast was definitely a win win. The pastries were however too sweet for my taste. Lovely ambience, the service was pretty good as well. Won't say the place is too costly, but it isn't too cheap either. Perfect place to be on a cold winter morning with your friends.

This veteran has lost its charm and quality but the rum balls are still in huge demand and it got finished before evening. We tried the almond honey cheese tart with chocolate boats and cherry slice. Tart and cherry slice were dry and was not exceptional. The chocolate boats were decent but could not exude the quality of a good cocoa.

When suddenly guests give a surprise visit and carry a big cake all the way from flury's then the waiting becomes all the more irrestible till you have your bite of cake. Needless to say this place is a trademark of cakes but l found the cake pretty much sugary. The cake was perfectly baked and the cream proportions went well with the cake but the yellow frosting or sugar coating on top of the cake was not at all perfect. Slightly harder and on top of that it resembled a mound of sugar. I didn't enjoy the top layer of the cake much but the inner portions were better and the cake was fresh also. The quality was nice but the decor of the cake mismatched giving too much sugary finish. Hope to try out their other delicacies sooner.

This place is legendary and I have heard so much about it that I had to try this place out. The interiors are amazingly decorated and especially the tables near the glass windows are charming. However, I didn't like the food so much, may be because I had very high expectations. The chicken envelope was more or less okayish and the chocolate truffle cakes we had were very dry and a bit hard. The staff here appear sharp but are actually very cold. It's expensive and wish the food were tastier.. Disappointed 😒

I entered child like into this old world with gleaming eyes to the legends that must have taken place at this historical landmark of Calcutta (yes, it was Calcutta then and the snooty British meimsaabs sipped their high teas over cakes at this very place). The place seemed to retain its charm through its wood panelled walls and crystal chandeliers. I could see the young Bengali couples giggling and sharing cakes over their cold coffees and the old time businessmen striking deals with government babus over their teas while arguing loudly over the tenders for new roads :) 
The foodie in me went from counter to counter staring at those  little glossy cakes dressed into neat cubes, all the while imagining myself transported in the pre-independence era viewing this Swiss confectionery in all its glory. In the middle of it while half dreaming and floating I must have taken my phone out to click those pretty little treats when I was woken up suddenly by a stern voice behind the counter, "Photography is not allowed out here, please keep your camera away!" The waking up was like it connects in your dreams, I felt a British officer shouting at me, a poor little Indian boy, that I am not invited in their rich club :) 
Took my table and ordered a couple of goodies; Chocolate cube, Almond Cube and Monalisa and my regular black coffee to accompany all the sugar
The neat little cubes that really made me take their pictures from every angle and in light condition, when cut through revealed the hollowing history of this place. The dried up cake and the cream that was crumbly made me feel as if the glory of flury's is now only a fairy tale or maybe Ive been spoiled by young chefs whipping up amazing desserts or simply the Delhiwala in me finds 'Wengers' far superior in quality and consistency than this old time swiss bakery of Kolkata :)
Monalisa had the same story to tell; the puff pastry with layers of coffee buttercream and vanilla sponge had too less of coffee... too dried up buttercream and too artificial a vanilla in its folds.
I looked up again this time and the glory of Flury's had transformed into an old ruin barely scraping through, on its golden past. The people had all disappeared and the crystal chandeliers seemed duller. My fantasy of living a day in the Raj era through this swiss confectionery was smashed by the hardness of the chocolate and almond cubes.... rubbed dry with the crumbly staleness of the buttercream in its Monalisa.

The classic memory of Park Street remains Flury's. 
From the chicken omelette to the chocolate cubes, nothing lets you down. 
And good old Darjeeling tea.

Growing up in a place like Calcutta,you're bound to be spoilt for choice when it comes to food.However,there are certain places,which dont change even a tad bit,no matter how many years roll by, and Flury's is just that place.
I've been to Flury's more times than i can count.The staff is ever so courteous,the decor is impeccable and their food is just oh-my-god-out-of-the-world delicious.
I make it a point to try something new from their menu each time i visit.This time i tried their chocolate cube pastry.You know that feeling of bliss which you experience when you manage to find something you've been craving for since a long time?This was nothing short of that.
I'd suggest everyone to check this place at least once,grab a novel,enjoy a cup of tea(they have the best tea in the world) and a pastry to while away an idle evening :)

It used to be a legendary confectionery at one point of time. Sadly Flurys is losing its charm and is unable to compete in quality of modern confectioneries. The only reason why people go to Flury"s is nostalgia .

Park street flury's is legendary bakery shop which needs no such review. The cakes and cookies can beat any other bakery but the most loved item of mine is the morning breakfast.yummy.😍. 
So many sweet memories are created with the help of them. Other outlets of flurys are similarly good but nothing can be compared with this park street flurys.
Vist and having a morning breakfast is recommend

I heard a lot about this place and lot of my friends have strongly recommended but to my surprise this place fails in all possible levels. I was in Kolkata for a day and tried out few places in Park street before heading to this place. Once i entered the waiters stared at me as if i landed from Mars. I had to find a place by myself and request for a menu card which was an achievement. After a quick glance i decided to try their cold coffee and i was waving my hand frantically to get someone's attention. After 15 mins a sever who was least interested took my order and left even before i could finish it. Cold coffee was terrible and over priced. Its milk with chocolate syrup even then they made an effort to make it bad & they were successful. Very arrongant and riding on their past success.Overall BAD !!

Bacon..Cold coffee, all the food was equally good, really laid out in style... the ambiance of the restaurant was also very nice. They are also well known for their pastries so decided to try the pastries and i think you would get some of the best in town at flurry's... A must go for everyone.... Do get seated at the table that overlooks the busy streets... Very Classy !!!!

There is something about Flury’s thats beyond logic. No matter the number of times you have been here, no matter how often you decide that the ice cream soda is not that great, you still land up going to this corner, to sit in nostaljia and watch the world go by. It has a hard-to-beat vintage reverence..

It's Breakfast time folks, whatever time of the day it might be. The best thing about the place is that even at your nth visit, the place will not bore you. It's an ultimate Park Street classic. Though a tinge heavy on the pocket, Flurys have a lot to offer in terms of fingerfood. The grilled sandwiches & the croissants deserve a special mention. Rest it's all about the beverages.

The pastries, I heard are some of the best in town. But unfortunately I couldn't feel that way. May be because I had over estimated going by the reviews. The brownie was sure shot a loss item as it was too hard. Pricewise, it's still okay but quality was not upto the mark. I believe this is hyped to a large extent. 

Besides, the sales executive in the bakery section had left his smile somewhere else as he had bore an unpleasant expression, which was why he was not approachable.

A place with history and heritage. A must they said if you ever visit Kolkata. Being a Bengali from this land of food, I had to go. The word that strikes you when you enter is 'elegance'. The ambience is very classy and the display is very inviting. Since I had gone in the evening, I couldn't have their famous breakfast or other meals (they come highly recommended) but I did treat myself to some pastries. They were quite delicious. And reasonably priced too. Having lived most my life in Pune and Mumbai, these prices weren't alien. Especially for one of the most elite joints in town. So I'd highly recommend a visit here, preferably for some meal. It's probably unfair to judge them for this, but the pastries weren't as mind blowing as I'd hoped. Although it's probably coz everyone has hyped it so much, my expectations were unrealistic. Legendary place, good food and ambience. A little heavy on the pocket, but if you're hanging on Park Street, I'm assuming that's no issue.

Apart from tasty brownies and pastries I loved the Full English Breakfast which is by far I think the best yet keeping in mind the price at which it comes. The breakfast was really good and very much accurate with the no. of items a Full English Breakfast consists of. The waiters were very much hospitable. I would definitely visit there again for the breakfast and pasta this time.

Whatever they said about going to Flury's only because you have to go there because of all the this-place-is-so-old crap turned or to be true.  
Absolutely don't understand the hoopla behind this place. 
Can still feel some sort of divide the servers have in mind. If you aren't ordering things worth a minimum of ₹400/ person, then you might as well not be there. If your bill amount is just ₹200, why the hell would you bother paying by card?

I had the heritage chicken sandwich, the mutton patty, two ugly and bitter chocolates and one pastry the name of which I can't quite remember but it had some biscuity thing in the middle. EXTREMELY average food. Pathetic service and condescending people in suits feigning interest in being courteous to half the people present there. 

Neah. One visit was more than enough. Never again! Not even for that English breakfast.

This place is one of the oldest confectionery shop in kolkata.. I hav always find this place to be over hyped. The cakes n pastries are no doubt delicious, but I find kookie jar serving much bttr pastries than flury's..
Now coming to the food, I went there fr evening snacks and ordered the three layer non veg club sandwich (without ham) and a cappuccino coffee.. The sandwich was served with a layer of omelette, Chicken, olive, cucumber, tomato n pineapple. the toast was too hard n crispy to eat. Literally my teeth were paining.. Didn't like the sandwich at all.. It was too dry.. Pls dnt try this club sandwich. U will regret ur order.. The coffee was nice n warm which I njoyed a lot.. Overall I feel pastries are the only good thing served here..

The place is a heritage to the city. Never fails to charm. The culture of city of joy feels so imbedded in this place. However I feel the quality of their cakes and pastries have comparatively fallen. The specialty house tea is amazing. The sandwiches and omelettes are a must try. I love their croissants . 
Last time i went to this place i tried out the fish fried with chips and it blew my mind. I am not much a fan of fishes being a bengali but this fried fish was just amazing. 
Do try the egg Benedict its a yummy dish with beacon and egg pouched in a bun bread topped with the yellow yolk. All time favourite is also the chicken cheese sandwich.  The hospitality keeps the tradition of this place.

Flury's at the end of the 1st junction of Park Street. They shut at 10 pm..... be warned..
They have no Happy Hours , how dare you even think like that..... Hurry up and eat and leave..  the cash counter is closed now.... 
yet... we loved everything they dished out.

The Fish and chips was very authentic and British , all with a tartar, fried and mashed peas...          8/10

The honey mustard glazed,  grilled Chicken was delicious .....    8.5/10

My dish was a work of art .... 
 Chicken Le Cordon Bleu.... 9/10

The iced tea and lemon drink were very average..... that and the attitude of half the staff pulled it down to a 4/5 

Still, highly recommended 
Slightly over priced yet very decent quality.

A Must Visit.

See, when you are suppose to write something & specially when it's a good one.. You would be confused; confused what to write.. Whether it should be the ambience, service or the most important thing for a food joint - FOOD! And yes, when it comes to the eternal breakfast items (English Breakfast - Eggs Benedict etc..) Or even your choice of #pestry... All is yyyuuuummm good. And believe me when I'm saying this - this is good stuff... Only thing ME is concerned would be the price, which is bit on a higher side.. Which again may be their niche marketing strategy.. 


P.S. I really don't think, need any further word to explain the ambience which actually speaks for itself. 

I did it on a Astami morning, accompanied by a lovely lady... You'll love it, your lady love will love you in turn... Go for it!

I am a big fan of Flury's. The desserts you get there are amazing also the tea and the snacks are so aunthentic. They have held their quality for years now which is a lovely thing. But the waiters are a little rude at times. Also during the puja they had a special lunch system and when we went to have dessert they did not let us and told us to stand and eat. Which is no accepted from Flurry's

The food was very good and Flury's still maintains its standard and the ambience. However the bacon which was part of the English Breakfast was a bit too fried for all three of us. The Service was also a bit slow. However there is nothing better than an English Breakfast at Flury's in Park Street...

I love their pastries, they are famous for their bakery if I am not mistaken!!! Then just because it is puja they have started "special lunch" which is fine but if one visits them during their "special lunch hour" one cannot seat and have desserts. You have to stand and eat at the counter. Even though there were plenty of tables empty. How rude is that? I was really pissed at this attitude.  Only for lunch people. I mean really? 
I would have understood if there were a huge queue outside like that of peter cat or mocambo, but when there is space why not utilise it and get business! 
And this is the sole reason for me to give 1 as a rating.

This is one of the go-to eateries in the Park Street area. In effect it is a brand and an old darling in itself. Last time we went here to please our sweet tooth, we treated ourselves to their cakes and pastries as it was the Christmas day.
Flury's is a top choice for a scrumptious, delectable, colourful and wholesome breakfast. The preparation of each are absolutely great. I have recommended many to explore this part of the world if is still an uncharted one. The surroundings will charm your heart and freshen your mind up promising a great start for the day. I love this place. And I think you must try it too.

Flury's has been there since 1927 and somewhere has created its name over generations.

Always fascinated and hoped to be here when I would visit Kolkata I found a chance on my recent visit.

I purchased a plum cake and some almond chocolates which we received complimentary.

As a souvenir and may be as a memory to Cherish the taste is indeed worth the name.

Our cheque was just Rs. 700/-

Loved it.

Flury's! The name says it all! Ambience, too good! Food, excellent! Prices, absolutely value for money! You can't call this place cheap, but its not costly either! Every thing about this place is perfect! I have tried a lot from their menu, and all of them are amazing! Heritage and Flury's are inseparable!

Was pretty disappointed with the place. I have been here a lot of times for new year's eve and always managed to give my taste buds a joyous new year countdown. However this time I was simply let down. I will not complain about the confectioneries which are always splendid. Truly a legend among bakeries. What failed to hit the right number was the other stuff I ordered. I have never had a sandwich worse than the one I had here. The croissant seemed somewhat closer to what one would expect here. For newbies I would recommend the breakfast menus. If you want a fabulous English Breakfast this is where you want to be!

After 21 years I stepped in to flurys and I loved it. The mushroom chicken quiche...not good.
The watermelon juice was alright. 
But the original English breakfast was so English. The toast was just right. The bacon were medium done but yet goood. The sausages were out of the world. Mushrooms in the platter so yum. Well the chicken cheese sandwiches we ordered were equally nice. Fresh chicken, nicely mixed with cheese melted in the mouth. Breakfast at flurys will happen soon. Thanks

When it comes to flurys doesn't needs any introduction the people of Kolkata.. The decor is very grand and has a contemporary feel.. Needless to say, the ambient lighting is very apt and optimum, that along with the decor creates an elegant atmosphere.. The hospitality is laudable.. 
The legendary restaurant in Park Street, has been there for ages, made people que up in front of its entrance for hours, but has always managed to live up to expectation.. 
Yes it's a bit overpriced but the ambiance and the heritage is enough to balance it.. 
Probably they served the best pastries in Kolkata.. I like to visit the place for a great cup of coffee,pastries,sandwich especially the chicken and cheese sandwich..

Went in for lunch and had the creamy chicken pasta mixed sauce but the chicken wasn't cooked that well and we had the roasted chicken sandwich which was decent  and the flurry a open sandwich which was something different and tasty and tasted quite a few pastries and the chocolate truffle was good and the chocolate boat !

Wanna see the who is a true calcutta person then go check in there @flurys park st.
It is not only a breakfast place..it can be as good as an evening tea party or a friends get together. Both official & unofficial meeting can take place since you can always discuss business ideas or a wedding planning over a cup of darjeeling tea..or salads sometime!
Oh the most famous part is the croissants here..you can order any of them & am sure you have to order one more.
My fav: cheesecake & darjeeling tea.

Then the over rated baba cake followed by an equally distasteful bean on toast! Won't suggest it to any of my friends! And seriously...please do something about the flies! C'mmon i am paying good amount of money to be disturbed with the flies! Then what's the difference between flury's and a roadside sweetshop?

Have been going to Flury's since when I myself don't remember but I feel this place has failed to maintain its quality over the years. The legacy and nostalgia associated with Flury's is what pains me when I see this place deteriorating. I miss the aroma of butter that used to ooze out from their cakes. The price has steadily gone up, that's no issue if they continued serving good quality food, what was once the hallmark of flury's .What's still perfect and refreshing is their tea!

If you are searching for a place where you can sit for a while with your near and dear one or with a friend then this place will a good idea. I went there a few months back(April 2015)  with my fiancé and fell in love with the environment instantly. Staffs are extremely well-behaved and trained. Crowd was cool. We got a very nice seat near the glass window.  However I found the price very high. Also the taste of the food was good but not finger-licking.

A tad overpriced but what else can be expected from flurys. We ordered the english breakfast along with the triple layered flurys sandwich and loved both the dishes. The bacon was crispy the poached egg watery the sausages just as it should be & da sandwich just yummy. Strongly recommended

The biggest disappointment were the flies which became a constant irritation during our breakfast.  Really hope next time am here in kolkata,  the smallest details are looked upon.  Cheers.

I was working on cruise ships for last 10 years and used to come to kol twice a year. Eating at some of the places has been a ritual for me ever since. And it hasn't changed much in the years. From my college days till now I still go to flurys whenever I'm in kol,  maybe not for the food anymore but just the place, the memories, the heritage, the nostalgia and have the same order always. Double cappuccino, baba cake and plum pudding my fav flurys craving.
The place is grande with a Paris bistro feel. The food is cool specially the bakery n vienoisserie offerings. And real good coffee. The waiters like most of the restaurants are smart n professional, remnants of a bygone era. It's highly recommended as is a milestone in kolkata culinary journey.

Visiting Flurys for tea and pastries with my old pals is a nostalgia for me. It's a must on my to do list whenever I come back home to Kolkata. This experience was dampened this time by the poor quality of service by the waiter. There was lack of communication between them which resulted in a confusion while seating us. One of the new faces made a big deal about seating only in 3 seat area instead of 4. I would have understood his concern if it was a rush hour or overly busy but it was neither. He had assumed that we were there only for a cup of tea and pastry. As our orders increased so did his hospitality. Inspite of the food quality being good I would not really care about visiting Flurys w my friends or family again as I was disappointed w their lack of customer service and the warmth that the heritage restaurant / bakery used to withhold.

An absolute favourite.. no matter how many more bakeries come up, none can ever ever ever be like flury's. It's a class apart. The eggless chocolate pastry is what i swear by.. they should have more eggless options. Flury's is the ultimate and age old breakfast destination in Kolkata. If you are planning for a nice european breakfast the first name that would pop in your mind would be Flury's.

Worst place in terms of service and attitude and Behaviour. I work in Bangalore.I was in kolkata last month with my parents in Park street , so thought of visiting this place once as i had heard a lot about it. We went there in a busy evening and i wanted to taste something in this place so thought of going for pastries. We sat in one of the tables and were waiting for someone to come but no one turned up . Finally i got up and asked to give us the menu for pastries. So they asked me to order in a separate counter which was on the right side. I paid for 3 pastries and came back to the table were my parents were sitting thinking that they would serve it. Then when i looked around, the pastry counter guy asked me to take it. Till then also it was fine. I n my father brought the pastries and we just started eating when a waiter came and asked us to move to the High Tables. It seems if you are having only pastries or similar stuffs, then you are not supposed to sit on tables. Whatever bullshit they told, i felt humiliated. We had already started eating and really felt bad to move to High tables with my parents.
I dont even remember which pastry we ordered neither do i remember its taste.
What i remember is the waiter and what he told us and how humiliated i felt about it.
I dont know how you Kolkata people are taking this. But in Bangalore i can bet this can never happen.
If required, I am ready to protest against Flury's.
I would not recommend Flury's to anyone on this Earth.

We had Cappuccino pastry, Almond Honey Tart and Cherry Chocolate pastry. The times have come that nowadays people look out more for brand than quality. Flury's has reached such a time in its history that their confectionery now runs more with their heritage presence. However, at the end of the day, their quality is not something that appeals to me as an individual (not staking any claims for others' opinions).
Frankly, the pastries that I had today were by far Just-Average quality and not something that I'd drool over. Maybe for some, any kind of goodies wrapped in that pink box is a luxurious outreach but for me, the taste has to be compelling for me to truly vouch for me!

Flury's-Perhaps the first thing that comes in any foodie's mind in Kolkata once they hear about cakes and pastries. Probably they serve the best pastries in Kolkata. We had pastries from here a number of times. They are priced around 70-90 Rs on an average. Yes it's a bit overpriced but the ambiance and the heritage is enough to balance it. This is again one of the best places in Kolkata where you can have your breakfast.

Flurys is a name which every Kolkattan is aware of. The decor of the restaurant, the ambiance, the looks all make it very posh as well as aristocratic. 

However, having said that, the food is inconsistent with price. So in terms of taste and food, I just felt that its overly hyped, overpriced with not so great food. The staffs are somewhat courteous.

Flury's is legendary when it comes to breakfast and even though I though newer outlets similar to it are coming up, this place still holds its charm among the Kolkata fraternity. The decor is excellent and the service is amazing too. Things to try are the english and joggers breakfast, swiss open sandwich and the club sandwich. The juice that came with it was watermelon and super fresh it was. It also has a confectionary section where you can choose your deserts . Today being Rakhi special had misti doi cheesecake. A place everyone must visit to have breakfast and have an awesome experience.

The thing about Flury's is that it is consistently inconsistent,both in terms of food and service. Once upon a time I loved their open sandwiches and cube cakes. I can't be certain about the quality of these anymore - they might or might not disappoint you; exactly like the people waiting on you - they might or might not smile at you. It all depends on how lucky you are that day. Yet Flury's will live - it should live as long as Park Street lives. Losing Music World was bad enough. Flury's is one of those last remaining landmarks that should be immortal.

Well everyone who has ever been to kolkata has been asked to have breakfast at flury's. Infact I have myself taken a few on this grand food experience.

Like all calcuttan , I have been visiting this place since childhood. A lot of things have changed, but the aura of the place remains. Strangely I realised on that I have mostly stuck to the same order of baked beans or corn on toast , with hash browns and darjeeling tea for years. But this time around I experimented and truly loved what I had - chilled coffee sprungli and the three layer sandwich (try it pineapple). 

Yes everyone has their favorites at this place, still I urge people to choose beyond your regulars trust me you will love it. 

Yes I still miss having their pineapple pudding, but I found my new favorite in the sprungli...yummmm.

Am a huge fan of Mushroom on toast. Pannini sandwich was also great. However, personally found the otherwise legendary beans on toast pretty average. With the great ambience and with a view of the bustling park street, it has a rare charm to it. Hiwever, they may want to improve on staff quality which seems a bit untrained for the place.

Does it really need a review, this place? :D
I'm not even going to mention the pastries and cakes as I am sure everybody has had the exquisite experience.
The thing that I will like to mention is the English Breakfast. You get rashers of crispy bacon, two grilled chicken sausages, two fried eggs, one grilled tomato and two hash brown with either two slices of bread and butter or toast and butter, all in INR 418 excluding tax. It's a bit costly BUT it is worth it.

Want a proper English breakfast in a serene ambience? Don't think twice, go to Flury's :)

still standing tall at Stephen's court rights on central Park Street, this is one classic confectionery with old styles decor.... reminiscent of the 30's, it goes with Calcutta's culture and history, you sit here & enjoy life pass by.

Their cakes, pastries & sandwiches are worth mentioning & are one of the famed one in the city. Been here twice for breakfast which happens to be very popular, as a matter of fact there is long waiting during breakfast hours at weekends. It has been a benchmark in city's confectioneries, though bit expensive but a delite for the people like me with sweet tooth.

Its funny sometimes, how an eatery is successful thanks to it's  legendary status alone; and not so much for its food / service. In fact such is the elevated status that we sometimes merely convince ourselves that the food too must be good, when all we get is sub standard experience. Flury's too seems to have reached that level of legendry-ism... where its just another legend on Park Street. The place was never known for its service and lets just face that. The staff are either dated or just arrogant or all of the above... and the level of their arrogance / aging is directly proportionate to their volume of business. But that, I guess, is a function of legends. The food... and that is where it should matter.... has consistently failed to deliver last every occasion I have been there. 
My order today Egg Benedict - the poached egg was extra vinegary though poached to perfection (gooey in the middle). The hollandise sauce was like flavoured mayo and the bread was soggy. Next, the legendary Chicken Patties - I have grown up to this stuff.... but what was served today was like a close imitation. It did not have the buttery, flaky, crispy, devilish coating it is famous for... though the chicken filling had a memorable taste. Triple egg omelet with ham followed and did not fail to disappoint - though the accompanying slices of toast were cold and brittle. 
Now, what is the first memory we have of Flury's ... and most people I know of, tells me of the view of Park Street.... voila! and what do we see today... curtains drawn shut. For a moment I thought I had entered a wrong place. On inquiring, I was told its to prevent the 'blazing' heat outside... I quickly reconfirmed the time on my watch... really... blazing heat at 9am? And there was no offer of opening them. While seated and gaping at the unimpressive textile, we had a good mind of walking out... till we helped ourselves to draw them open ourselves... if that action of ours makes us unwelcoming... we might as well go down fighting... luckily, we did get a helping hand from one of the waiters... he must have felt the same claustrophobic sensation like us... and through out our meal which lasted for about 2 hrs, ours remained the only window which had a view... maybe I had a very wired set of friends, how jointly think that the view of the morning bustle of Park Street with a second flush Darjeeling is the stuff legends are made of.
Would I go back to Flury's in spite of all this... of course... otherwise how do I have by non resident bong friends 'liking' my social media status update in envy... well, is that what this legend has come to?

Needless to say, Flury's has been in my heart since long and perhaps one of the must-visits for someone who is visiting the city for the first time. Flury's is a must visit for me during the Christmas time. I like to visit this place for a great cup of coffee and sandwich, especially the Chicken and Cheese Sandwich.

Apart from that, try out the English Breakfast. That is great and perhaps the only place in Calcutta which knows the exact proportion, combination of an English Breakfast.

There are few waiters whom I know since long and hence, I get a good service every time I visit there.

This place is nostalgic to me. Really waiting to visit this place again, very soon.

One of the most iconic places in the city! This is a must visit place for anyone visiting Calcutta. Although I used to prefer the old place which had a rustic British charm to it, the new place also has a charm of its own. Mouth watering selection of pastries is the best thing about this place. The chocolate short bread and the rum ball is to die for. Another must try is the creamed corn on toast. This in one place I love going back to, again and again!

Nice ambiance, but highly disappointed with the service, had English breakfast there, sausage and bacon was the once you get to buy in any store... seemed like most of the products were not actually made kitchen, they were just cooked there, only thing I liked was the juice, the worst part was the bacon, it was so fried that in mouth it was like oily fried biscuit, and it tasted so bitter that I had to do something I do not usually do or like to do, that is to return the food, and what they replaced it will was no different, just the fry was less but tasted bitter, totally missed the taste of bacon, zero flavour of bacon...

I have very seriously wanted to like Flury's since the time I visited it first around 2005, since liking this place and going nostalgic was a fashion. I was then a much social-approval seeking teen-ager exploring food.

A decade later, the place still serves the same sugary over-priced desserts, which always reminded me of Iyengar bakeries in South India and hopefully liking the place is no longer a social obligation for me. 

of course I never tried the fine dining section and I fear the over priced breakfast will be a let down. the ambience is very nice, pretty, swanky, posh and british, but I would rather walk down the shabbier and less flamboyant restraurants on park street for excellent food for good price.

This heritage English tea house gives you an authentic British dining experience, starting from the menu to the ambiance, boasting of understated class.. The pastries n cakes, as I had tried earlier from diff outlets,are divine..but this was my first visit to the main outlet at Park street and the puffs and the quiches, the flury's special tea were equally good and worth every penny.

The best place for breakfast. Period.Eggs (the way you want) , creamy garlic mushroom on toast , beans on toast , club sandwich . It will make your day.  The only issue is that there is less innovation here in the menu , so its been the same for years. It has still managed to maintain its fondness among guests. That's what Heritage is all about.   It lives up to the expectation of all and sundry.  Must Visit.

Legends can’t be rated but like history, be imbibed and infused wholeheartedly .  Calcutta's tryst with the British era comes alive at Flurys. Known for it’s old world British ambiance and equally delicious English breakfast, cakes and bakes, I head there just for that. The ethereal combination of Bacon,  Fried egg, crispy toast, hash browns and a glass of freshly squeezed juice is just what perfection should be defined as.

For the health conscious, the Joggers Breakfast gives you an ultimate high. Rindless bacon, baked hash browns, lean chicken sausage, egg white omelette, multi grain bread toast- what else do you need?

Very few are aware that Flurys shares an equally delightful spread of delicious cheesecakes. Though the flavors are a standard Blueberry, Strawberry or a Mango, the taste is equally delectable par excellence.

Pancake lovers must give their traditional Butter pancake with maple syrup. An ethereal combination of chocolate milkshake makes it an affair to remember.

All in all relish the fusion of traditionalism with the renaissance in all sundry.

This place has been there for generations to generations and it still has not lost it's charm. A great breakfast place where we can actually choose from variety of options. From English breakfast to sandwiches everything is a must have. Though known for it's legendary breakfast, I am fond of it's lunch menu as well. The pastries and cakes here do not really match up the expectation but again the staff is helpful and cheerful. They say desserts here are the best but I would suggest not to spend on pastries except for the truffle.

This is a heritage tea and cake shop in Park Street and for old timers a frequent haunt whenever there is some time in the area or there are friends to be treated to tea or an English breakfast.
Their website says: "Flurys the legendary tearoom on fashionable Park Street in Kolkata was founded in 1927 by Mr and Mrs J Flurys. Presenting fine European traditional confections, it had soon become a popular meeting place for all ages. It introduced the city and many generations to authentic Swiss and International delicacies."

Flury's are top confectioners in Kolkata. Now Au Bon Pain has come next to it and a number of other Confectioners have come up elsewhere in the city! They are by and large on commercial lines.
However this is the concept of a tea shop as it evolved here and therefore it is heritage!
The Darjeeling tea served here in their immaculate white tea sets is the best out of all places that I tried.! This is the place to imbibe Darjeeling tea! Done to perfection with efficiency and care! You don't get this in Calcutta's Clubs too!!
With Darjeeling tea, one can choose to have a croissant, cookies, patties or pastries of choice from the Baker's counter inside the restaurant! Or one can go for the menu for the morning day or evening. I have had Breakfast Brunch and Dinner meals here and it's really authentic European taste and presentation! Their omelette and egg preparations are a must try too. Simple tasty food but takes the cake! Many foreign tourists visit this place.
Service is efficient and food is great. While leaving carry some cake/pastries for home or as gift.

We ordered coffee, chicken grilled sandwich, Egg sandwich, Tuna sandwich, Mango shake and some seasonal fruit cake alond with a mango mousse. All the foods are fresh and tastes good expect the egg sandwich, I found it less tastier. Nice experience. Thank you.

My first visit to Flurry's during this business trip to Kolkata, i had heard a lot about this place from my peers and the place lived up to the expectations, they have  tried to maintain that old world charm of a tea room where in you can sit, relax and have a discussion. 

A quiet place in crowded Park Street of Kolkata, i was told that the place gets very busy during the weekends.

I had a point in my bucket list to have breakfast here someday. That got ticket today morning! 

The staff here is very courteous and very warm in heart. 

I had a chicken patty, chocolate croissant and bacon. All three were mindblowing. 

At the end, you must have their hot chocolate with cream!

If you feel to have a very authentic English dining experience. Look no further. This is an overpriced Pattison joint serving those with distinct taste for the continental platter which limits itself to general munchies and doesn't go overboard with the menu. Good choice of pastries and puff. I personally love the rum ball ( which contains a decent bit of the hapoy juice )
Excellent joint for breakfast and their juices are fresh and satisfying. You won't find it too crowded by midday but happens to be a joggers retreat in the mornings. Good bilingual staff and keen security. The interiors remind you of a forgotten Victorian hall.

When it comes to flurys, the first thing that comes to mind is their English breakfast. But that does not mean one should overlook the coffee, pastries and other snacks they serve. If you have given a miss to the morning bliss then you must spend an evening there and have their delicacies. 

The quality of service has definitely deteriorated and the place is not properly maintained which is evident once you've settled down. 

However, it is the heart of Park Street and one could never love it less. The street looks charming and lively when you sip a cup of coffee sitting on those comfy chairs by the window and get lost in your thoughts.

Flurys has a special place in the hearts of anyone who loves kolkata.  We have grown up on pastries from flurys. Going to flurys for breakfast was considered to be the high point in our lives as children. The taste of the baked goods has remained unchanged. 

But sadly this place is stuck in the old age. They are not innovative and are not trying to change with times. The palates of the customers have evolved but the menu in flurys is still out dated. 

But if u want to enjoy the taste of the British era and experience nostalgia this is the place to be

There are not enough words to describe what Flury's means to Kolkata-ians. It is a place for sheer nostalgia, the British-Raj style. Even though this flagship store offers lunch options, breakfast items is your best bet. We ordered the grilled chicken sausages, chicken masala envelope, chicken&mayo sandwiches along with Flury's special tea, chocolate shake and cold coffee.
Service took them a while but the orders were delivered piping hot.
The chicken sausages were juicy as ever and had tiny hint of spice to it. Sandwich portions were decent with a good chicken to bread ratio. Chicken masala envelopes were stuffed with the chicken filling but the puff pastry was too biscuity for my liking. The tea was a self-assembled deal which added to the flair and the coffee and shake were moderately good, but not brilliant. 
This place is a good option in case you want to spend your time reading a book while sipping on delicious food and looking at hustle-bustle of Park Street through the window. The ambience is quite and sophisticated and the decor is British-ly elegant. Even though things are on the higher side of the price, Flury's is a must-visit just for reliving the nostalgia associated with dining in the Raj style.

So, yesterday I visited Flury's, the historical eatery in Kolkata for the first time ever (better late than never). It was an informal meet between Logitech's Product Cluster Manager & tech bloggers (I blog at www.thetecholic.com). We were shown the newly launched K480 Bluetooth wireless keyboard & UE Boom compact speaker!

Flury's has adopted a "Pink" theme and the ambience was pretty laid back & lazy. Maybe since it was around 12:30-1pm on a weekday.

I had Cold Coffee & Chicken toasted sandwich, since I was repeatedly asked to have something! The combo turned out be pretty heavy and was a perfect lunch for me. Both the dishes tasted quite good.

Pricing is on the higher side but you need to pay a 'premium' if you want to eat at one of the historical places in Kolkata! Would definitely go back & try out more, soon!

P.S.: couldn't click any pics as i was in a 'meeting'. :(

I had heard a lot about this place for years before I went there and obviously I had some expectations. But it ended in utter disappointment. The sandwich we ordered was just too bland. The drinks were good but I wouldn't say anything was worth the image flury's has in Kolkata. And we had gotten a seat in one of the corners where the staff had a small counter and they kept frequenting it and it wasn't something I would prefer to have. My friends still ask me to give it one more chance but with Au Bon Pain and CCD being right next to it, I doubt if I will.

Flury's is a timeless classic. The glass walls overlooking the busy traffic of park street with a dreamy ambience inside coupled with a soothing playlist sets the perfect mood for a lazy indulgence. We opted for the English breakfast which had a serving of two slices of toast with poached eggs, generous amout of bacon, chicken sausages, hash browns,mushrooms and a glass of watermelon juice.Then we helped ourselves to American pancakes with maple syrup,honey,butter and two rashers of bacon. Also, we HAD to order Eggs Benedict! Needless to say, the breakfast was superb..each of the dishes pampered our tastebuds and the Eggs Benedict was perfection! Service is of course impeccable and lastly, we treated ourselves to chocolate truffle and Peach Melba. The desserts were the cherry on top of a splendid brunch! I want to come back here time and again.

One of those places which people visit to kill their curiosity. When people talk about breakfast options in Kolkata - this place has to be right there at the top.  It is spoken about so much and well deserved as well. There are many words that can be used to describe this place - legendary, heritage, etc but the one that I think suits best is "Iconic". That's what this place is like. What to eat - well you can try almost anything and be rest assured that you will not be disappointed.

This was and shall remain 'legendary' for generations to come.
The breads and pastries are good(do not read 'great'),coffee and tea -fine and fashionable. Among cakes the one I detest is the Plum Cake. Once you've tasted Nahoum's ,this would annoy you. Flurys is overpriced given the quality is no Extraordinary. But it still stands strong,head held high and always welcoming you to come and spend some minutes inside.

Heritage of kolkata.. I have heard from my grandfather that flury's used to be the place for his celebrations.. Well the same for me and much more.. The breakfast is awesome as you all know but the lunch and the dinner also is as good if not more! The amb is lavish! The simple bakery items are way better than any fancy cake or anything!thumbs up!

One of the most iconic places in Kolkata and it does pack a punch!! The wonderful ambience...full of life and vibrant with enthusiasm adds to the appeal of this place. The cakes here are delicious to say the least. I have had Black Forest at many other shops but the one at Flury's is simply incomparable like all its other cakes. They simply melt in your mouth and you yearn for more without being worried about the calories!! When i had first visited the place i had this dish called fried chicken wings and it was simply the best of its sort and an absolute delight to my taste buds...unfortunately it was later removed from the menu!Truly one of the best in its segment and a joy to visit!

Located in one of the best areas of Kolkata- Park street, Flurys needs no introduction.
But of late, its quality is deteriorating. The prices are going up for no reason, quality of the food has also gone down and the service is not at all cordial.
The glory which it attached to this place is slowly fading away.

Very bad experience. Food still stays good but the service is horrible. The waiters were screaming and talking to each other across the restaurant! The final nail on the horrible experience was being served diet coke in a dirty milk shake glass. The waiter was unapologetic and couldn't care less. Wasn't replaced and was billed! Never going back to be treated like that not even for the awesome sandwiches.

Flurys - one of the iconic places on Park Street is conveniently located on the main road, attracts a good amount of guests because of its years old name. It has both bakery and dining area. It offers delicious continental food with its hearty English breakfast considered one of the best in town. If one has a sweet-tooth  Lemon tart, Butter-scotch gateau and black forest gateau are a must try. They run out pretty fast so grab one soon!

This is probably the most overrated restaurant in the city! From nauseating baked beans to weird-tasting sandwiches to overpriced omlettes, they've got it all! To add on that, they've got the most tasteless teas and coffees in the city!

The only thing that gets this place going is the vibe and feel of sitting in a classy restaurant. Apart from that, there's nothing more to this place. Waiters think they own the place (and the patrons)! They're rude and do not respond to calls promptly.

I'd suggest against going to this place unless one is dropping by to get some bakes or desserts, which personally I don't like.

The ultimate place to enjoy the legendary park street culture. Must try- Darjeeling tea (ask them to serve in a tea pot), berry melba, black forest sundae, black forest pastry, chicken sandwiches, and various types of deserts and pastries.
A must place if u love to spend time over tea & small bites.
P.s. should go for breakfast.
Will go back again n again n again.

Overrated and exaggerated place. Had ordered for Flury's special open face sandwich with bacon and they got me a their club sandwich without bacon. Sad service and two servers were arguing  with each other in the service area. Bland coffee and their almond cake tasted old and sour. Wouldn't recommend.

Loved their service and ambiance. The view from my table was also quite refreshing. Though the breakfast menu is recommended, I wouldn't go for the french toast ever again. It was too hard.
Cheese and tomato croissant was amazing! Though I wish they paid more attention to the presentation.
The desserts were amazing, but then again, this kolkata's lengendary bakery is known for that! 
Leaving remark- Happy! ^_^

What can I say about the quintessential English café in Kolkata that hasn't already been said before? We went there for breakfast on the 21st of June early morning as this place is one of the places in Kolkata I definitely cannot miss when on vacations here. The thrill of going there early in the morning was awesome. The decor was very classy and sophisticated reflecting its old British heritage. We ordered English breakfast which came after a long wait. The food looked delicious, the presentation wasn't very artistic but the look of bacon and eggs covered up nicely. The plate was full of English delicacies such as bacon, fried egg, fried tomato, mushroom, hash brown and juice. They tasted wonderful. The bacon was nicely fried. Afterwards came the coffee again after a long wait. It tasted like the instant coffee you get in shops. Wasn't gourmet at all. 
Go there for the old Kolkata nostalgia and charm and the classy decor. The hearty English breakfast will definitely make your day. Be prepared for a long wait and sluggish service.

I will do something dishonest. I will commit a crime, travesty, sin.......... I will judge a famous renowned legendary cafe (the only cafe for which "legendary" won't be exaggeration) by it's one single dish. C'mon, all the stock brokers out there, haven't you all started your journey by buying blue chip shares??? Then? I am not the villain here. I can review Flury's, rate it, take pics. But, I don't know, it felt somewhat that I am clicking selfie with my Grandpa's Gold Plated Parker, sharing it in Instagram with an array of hashtags. No. What I will do is I will take one dish. And praise it. Tell everyone that heaven has a taste. Blueberry Cheesecake. I think anyone who is suicidal, about to jump off a cliff, when given this piece of serenity, will regain faith in life. So good. Heaven. That's it. You will get it here in Flury's. Really, can I complain? :)

The best flurys outlet in kolkata. I was not so hungry when for the first time i went inside the place but the smell itself made me hungry. I am a die hard pastry and cake lover and flurys is like heaven for people like me. Every item, mind it, every item is to die for. The break fast they serve is delicious but i couldn't taste the bacon items as i m not a pork lover. The ambience is beautiful and the staffs are so helpful and patient( i took 15 mins to choose a cake).
I must say flurys has given me my best cake eating experience so far. Cheers!!

This is one of those over the top places situated in park street, immensely famous but don't know why !! This place used to b great once upon a time but it is not the situation anymore, at least not for me. The coffee is very average and ordinary and their breakfast is ok. I like their baked muffins and tarts but not any of their pastries as I find is very sweet and sugary for me.

Flurys is considered one of the heritage places for good in kolkata. :) And every time I went past the past in park street I wanted to peep in but due to some reason or other never got a chance.This day as I was waiting for a restaurant to open I thought of not wasting time in any other coffee shop and entered Flurys. We ordered Flurys special coffee , Hot chocolate and Chicken patties and Chicken masala patties. The patties were really good .The hot chocolate thing i found tasted more or less like health drinks .But the thing I loved most about this place is its ambiance , the decoration :) overall it fells good sitting inside Flury's .Will definitely visit again for more time.

The pastry's, baked beans, breads are amazing. The only bread I eat is flury's. I never eat bread unless I have no other option. So flury's scores above everyone else in breads. Pastrys are good but you get the same everywhere too. It is a MUST GO for its English style breakfast, breads and the aura around it.

I'm still unsure about my opinion on Flury's...
One fears an outright dismissal because the bakery is as much part of Kolkata's history as a Satyajit Ray or a Howrah Bridge is. But one has also tasted confectioners from upstart new-age bakeries which are miles ahead in terms of flavour, range and technique.
Although led there with fiercely contradictory views of their cakes, both the lemon tart and chocolate shortbread were pleasant on the tongue. However one is always wistful wondering if the fame is after all another manifestation of the city's tendency towards nostalgia.
Bottom line: I felt it was overpriced simply because I've honestly had much better!

nice place, had gone there with a friend to see how posh is park street but was pleasantly surprised to see the iconic flurys had a crowd n staff not snooty at all infact they were pretty decent, hadn't ordered much just cold coffee n croissants.... Both were quite good. Just one thing I would have really liked is that if someone had assisted us with the seating it would've been great, I found out later that one part was for dining n the other was café.

Food is fine not great but just fine for a light snack but needs to improve customer service and etiquette urgently. It is a Kolkata icon but that is not enough for a high score. Wanted quiches and puffs for a late afternoon tea but was told abruptly that these were not available. Available light snacks option was not offered. Had to also pay the bill at the counter as it did not appear despite asking for it twice. The au bon pain next door may have been a better option and a missed opportunity. All the best in retaining status as a kolkata icon.

Flurys is known to be one of the legendary restaurants in town. It's elegance and looks of that of the old days attracts people. If you're going for breakfast, tuna sandwiches and the English Breakfast is a must. Otherwise, pancakes, bacon, chocolate truffle, tarts, and others products are heavenly. Though, it's a bit expensive, the mindblowing taste makes it up for that. One staying in Kolkata should try it for once. Definitely one of the best bakeries  in town. Recommended.

Have heard so much about this legendary landmark of Kolkata & promptly visited the place on my first visit to the city. The place was bustling with people & I loved the atmosphere. Servers are fairly attentive, considering how busy the place was that evening (I am assuming it would be busy every day). Very interesting menu. Ended up ordering eggs benedict which was very good. Washed that down with a cuppa hot chocolate. On my way out picked up a couple of the ready to go cakes from their bakery counter as I was visiting relatives who have been residents of Kol for a long time. They were very happy receiving their fav cakes & promptly gobbled them up before dinner...Nice!

Saw quite a few interesting dishes on their menu that I want to try out....can hardly wait for my next visit to Kol!

So not being a local and being touted as a legendary eatery, I went in here on three separate visits and each time I left thinking I must've missed something for a place so highly spoken of cannot have disappointed my tum-tum so. 

Now when one is used to having tea in those thick kaanch ka gilaas on the roads, a magnificent looking tea set would give one the creeps. I mean, what goes where, who knows. Thankfully, the waiter politely suppressed his laughter at my ignorance and fixed me a cup of fine tea. Fine, I say, doesnt jostle you up like Chai would, but FINE. I have tried the classic English breakfast, the omelette made to order, the eggs Benedict, the French Toast (absolute must-try, they use the legendary milk bread), the chicken cordon bleu, and the peach melba. Oh and croissants are always take-aways. All this on separate visits, of course. The English breakfast has been a clear winner and I can safely assume, is a favourite amongst most. The omelette was done as requested, the eggs Benedict were nicely done, albeit, not enough for a big breakfast. The chicken, although I liked it at the time, wasn't anything to write home about. The peach melba has been the only dessert I tried, and have had it every time. 

The service is good, the decor is charming and a loaf of milk bread is a must take-away. Soak that in some warm milk later when you're hungry again and you will be transported to your warm, fuzzy bed. 

Flury's charm, they say, has been dying over the years. But it remains on most tourists' maps. And for the right reasons. One goes in for the experience of dining at Flury's, not the food, per se.

The original Flurys. The best place for a breakfast of bacon and eggs. The breakfast menu has a lot of choice and unlike in other outlets stays open till quite late. Do not miss the eggs benedict and the mango mascaporne tart. However, due to the heritage tag, the place ceases to be reasonable.

Had heard a lot of amazing things about the place and hence when I visited kolkata on a tight schedule it was one of my first picks for dessert. However I was disappointed. We had 2 pastries, tiramisu and 2 slices of cheesecake. The pastry was really dry. The tiramisu, was moist and fresh but did not have the distinct coffee flavour that you would expect in one. The cheesecake however was delicious with a nice buttery base. Prompt and courteous service, but unfortunately I expected a lot more.

Flury's is relic of the yesteryear fondly remembered by the older generations and those who have stayed in Calcutta for long time. The nostalgic value and ideal location make this one of the most iconic spots in Park Street. Food compared to its hype is not much to write about. Thankfully its not one of those places where one would go with high expectations and then return wanting to kill themselves, like most heritage Delhi outlets make one feel. The staff is courteous and food is decent. Slightly on the expensive end but tolerable

I would start this review with a small trivia: Frurys and Trincas started as a single restuarant or more aptly as a confectioner..they latter split into 2 separate joints becuase legend says that one of them actually eloped with his partner's wife from which we get this modern day version of this joint..Though this place has a widespread reputation and is legendary for its cakes and savouries I feel they are just a mere shadow of their glorious past..I have seen many people patronising their Breakfast spread but personally I have found it to be a way over-hyped and over-priced as well..The servers in this place are totally lackluster,inefficient and at times even sloppy than a tortoise..Still I love their Sandwiches,Grilled Fish and their desert items..I haven't spend a single Christmas without a Cake from Flurys..it is something which reminds you of old Flurys..their chocolate items are also quite enjoyable and provide a sheer pleasure for sweet tooth like me..Their Chocolate hampers are conveniently priced from Rs.350 and above..One can also try their special in-house cookies..The ambiance still retains that old Colonial look with its antiquities and decors..sadly the food don't resembles that of old times..Overall if you are yet to visit this place do visit it once for its experience but its better not to expect anything stupendous from this place anymore..

To start off, Flurys is definitely open before 11 am. Don't know why Zomato has listed it wrong and why the Flurys management hasn't got it changed. But I reckon, everyone in Kolkata knows this joint for so long that hardly anyone would be checking Zomato for this!

Anyway, I was visiting Kolkata and a colleague recommended Flurys for breakfast. Entering it is like getting into some time capsule. While the place is suitably modernised there still lingers the wistful ambience of British era somewhere. 

I had a cheese bacon omelette. Was I bowled by it? Absolutely yes! The omelette was just perfect in taste, looks and presentation. Skilfully done in a golden hue, it's the sinfully melting cheese with bits of tantalising bacon, that tickle and tease the taste buds.   ( How I wish Dominoes could get this melting cheese correct in their cheese burst pizzas). 

The portion size is huge. And one omelette accompanied by two crisp brown toasted bread, is sufficient. 

I still had a chicken patty alongside, not knowing that the omelette portion would be so large.  Again, I thought a patty is just a patty and would be those measly little oily things which we are used to.   No! The chicken patty was one big mountain of shredded chicken housed in a flawlessly done outer lining.  

Topped it all of this with a great cup of Darjeeling tea.  

My visit to Kolkata this time (in May 2015) was a culinary journey and Flurys was definitely an important landmark to savour and fondly remember.

The best pastry shop in Kolkata...infact calling it just a pastry shop wud be unfair as there are other main course dishes which are really good...brownie and black forest and their chocolates are to die for

Flury's is one of the best bakery shops in Kolkata.
The quality of cakes and patties here is second to none.
When we I visit Park Street during the day , I make it a point to come to this age old place and satisfy my taste buds. Be it chicken Caesar salad or sandwiches - the taste is awesome.

Well, Flury's needs no introduction and i won't give one as well. We all know how reputed it is and that it has lived up to it a fair bit till now.

This is my first time surprisingly and i went there for the cheesecakes but AGAIN it wqs not avail. Disappointed.
Anyway, ordered a Mutton patties and Pineapple cake and the latter was a bliss. The patties was nothing too good or out of the world but ya big and quite heavy for your stomach.

Ate a piece of tart from my friend and it was more or less like an expensive chawaprush come cake. Classy chawaprush maybe.

The atmosphere and the place is top notch, no complaints there but i feel one should definitely keep more stock of their A1 products. A good place for breakfast and some fast snacks. Recommended.

Of the famous Park Street eateries and restaurants that made this road the crown jewel in India at one time,and associated luminaries like Cliff Richards,Engelbert Humperdinck,Pam Crain,Louis Banks and Usha Uthup with the city of Calcutta as it was called then,very few remain in their original avatars.Blue Fox and Skyroom are no more,Trincas a pale shadow of its former self,Magnolia changed owners and character,Bar b Q is more of a Chinese restaurant,Moulin Rouge has become an ordinary watering hole,Peter Cat and Mocambo the only two places to hold the flag high.
in this ruin stands Flury's which was orginally Eastern Indias most loved "tea room" but for some unfathomable reason in the early 2000's was changed to look like a parisian restaurant foregoing its Swiss roots.I have spent many lazy afternoons here with a pot of tea refilled with hot water by the friendly waiter and when in money helped by their rum balls,horse shoe and pineapple pudding.
went there today after a long time and found out pleasantly two of the old waiters and also that the taste of the abovementioned items have not changed.The coffee was also very good and the service nice.But the question to ask is whether the proprietors should have consulted some well meaning city architects and designers to preserve the flavour of the old Flury's which had a much better feel than the glitter we see now.....just a thought.

This may be the MOST over-hyped cafe/dining place in Kolkata and you know it's overhyped when every second Bengali you meet tells you to go here. 
Sure, Flury's is one of the best in terms of ambience and their menu cards are quite lovely, with a description of the history of the place, which I found quite appealing. 
However, as many of you can doubtless ascertain with your Bengali friends again, its past its prime. Apparently every third Bengali will talk about how it used to be a great establishment but has since lost its standing but I refuse to see any logic in that (tried, couldn't find it). 
I've been here twice in as many years and each time, the experience was dismal. The waiting procedure outside the place where sometimes people can magically jump ahead of you, the clamour, clang, clap & clatter of the people, the indifferent waiters (which is kind of the norm in Kolkata it seemed to me) and the atrocious prices; all just exacerbated an already bad experience. 
I wouldn't just put down a restaurant after one visit, hence the second visit. Things were as bad as they always were and the food was not particularly "blow-my-pants-off" brilliant either. It's a bit different yes, but I couldn't find anything that I wouldn't not have been able to make in my own kitchen, for a tenth of the price.
Wouldn't visit again. Don't listen to the hype, but do visit for the ambience.

Been here for countless times....and every time I feel equally delighted. Arguably one of the best legendary restaurants in town....it's food is as ionic as it's presence...be it the authentic British breakfast or the classic Italian Au gratin or the sinfully indulging desserts...their repertoire is an august ensemble and the taste of each dish will leave ur palette deeply satisfied. There are simply no words to describe the charm of the place... the elegant classy decor and the extravagant chandeliers literally transfers you back to the bygone era....Flurys is truly a slice of heritage in our own backyard and is definitely a part and parcel of the history and culture of Kolkata.

So I love the pastries here but today was unfortunate and How does flurys ruin your lunch? 
By not letting you sit at a proper table because its reserved for lunch, even tho it was virtually empty at 3pm.  So if you want to have just desert you'd have to sit on the long rusty noisy stools and let the mqosquitoes bite you while you try and enjoy your desert.

We ordered for English Breakfast meal and Caeser Salad. If we talk about the Caeser Salad, I have had better Caeser salads but the English Breakfast meal steals the show. The Bacon, toast, and egg deserved special mention. And I did parcel the Blueberry Cheescake, Chocolate Truffle and two Tarts. The desserts, I must say were perfectly sweet. I mean majority of the times the desserts are extra sweet but this time here it was an exception. Nice and friendly behaviour too.

I felt the place is quite hyped.may b the brkfast is awesome othrwise we were really disappointed.

Flury's is a LEGEN...wait for it...DARY place. If you are in the Park Street area you just cannot ignore the bulging importance Flury's holds in that area, just by showing off its architecture. 
Pros:
1. Ambiance
2. Nature of Waiters: Polite and sophisticated.
3. Food: A wide variety of sandwiches; I selected the Flury's Own Open Ham, Cheese, Bacon sandwich which was exquisite. 
4. Desserts! 
Cons:
If I be too critical I may find some cons, but in reality there were no cons. Just to satisfy the mental hunger, here is a couple for you:
1. Nature of waiters
2. Price of desserts: I've had better rum balls in my life but none at such a high price.Now you may be surprised to see I mentioned the Nature of Waiters in both Pros and Cons. I mentioned it in Cons because the waiters appeared so confused while attending to us. When we were calling them nobody was coming, and when they eventually came, they brought the whole platoon, we were literally surrounded by 4 waiters all looking at each other confused gesturing "You go, I can handle this."Another thing I noticed was that the waiter that took the order wasn't the waiter who gave us our food, that caused more confusion because the one who gave us the Iced Coffee did not know there was supposed to be ice cream with it. Once again the order got delayed because then the Iced Coffee went to get ice-creamed. 

Overall: Would I go? Absolutely yes. I have a fascination of trying their club sandwiches.

Oh Flurys! You cannot miss this one when in Kolkata can you? The food is excellent and the pastries are to die for. Personally I think the breakfast is way overpriced and it is better if you visit the shop in the evenings and try out their lovely sandwiches. The constant buzz of activity inside and outside adds to the experience.

The shop runs as a super hyped place!! But you still get to have a variety of breads and confectioneries at reasonable prices, and the ambience is really great!!

Flury's is one of the oldest tea joints in the city. Known for the age old European ambience and style, it creates a statement of status and class. I am going there since my childhood and still can't get over their cakes and pastries. In their confectionery section, the black forest, pineapple fresh cream, cheese almond basket and the chicken and mushroom quiche are my favourites. Earlier, when I was a child, they used to sell slabs of chocolates during Christmas. Now they have stopped it and I badly miss my childhood days of sheer chocolate indulgence. It's a request to their authority to restart the same.
Now, at the restaurant section, I am obsessed with a few things again. I love their cutlery and cups in which they serve tea. Here also, I prefer the window side seats to get the feeling of dining at an European cafe. People praise a lot about their breakfast. But I find it a bit overpriced and I think you get better breakfasts at other restaurants in Kolkata at a better rate. On the other note, you can try their other delicacies. Every year, during the Christmas season they serve a Turkey roast for which visiting Flury's during that time is a must job for me. You will also love their sandwiches and the creamy chicken spaghetti. The rich creamy taste will lead you to the ultimate level of peace of mind. Flury's is really one of the best restaurants in the city and you should go for it. Happy Dining! :)

Summary
Ambiance: 10
Food: 8
Service: 9Location: 10
Value for Money: 8

This is probably the most famous confectionery in Calcutta. It is a symbol of the glorious past of the city and is one of the emblems of British influence on the city

Ambiance: You simply cannot beat them in ambiance. The best! The interiors are almost regal and elaborate. It has a very sophisticated atmosphere where the creme de la creme of the city rub elbows and sip teas silently. Impeccable manners is a must almost!Food: The cake is a bit overrated. Every Calcuttan will invariably give an outsider such reviews which take their expectations to stratospheric levels. That person will almost certainly be disappointed. There are places serving better cakes in Calcutta in that very region. However, the breakfast is an experience in itself. As British as the Britishers get. 

Service: Starting from the moment the door is held open for you to enter, to the moment it is again held open for you to leave, you will be made to feel like a king! A welcoming smile is consistent throughout the place, be it at the entry or be it behind the counter. 

Location: This does not need any reference to locate. It is a landmark in itself. Period. 

Value for Money: If you try to dissect the services and their value objectively , it is not worth the money you shell out. However, one needs to realize that Flurys is not just the food, it is a slice of history, a little corner in the street that reminds us of the city that once was. 

The importance of this shop to the city cannot be explained in terms of profit margins or sales. It is like a time machine which alchemizes every visitor to aristocracy of a city far away from the squalor of the present. It is of momentous importance to the cultural fabric of the city and this street particularly.

I haven't been to flury's yet. I'm writing this review based on the cake that was brought on my friend's birthday from flury's.

The name of the cake was chocolate butter cream cake. The appearance is worth mentioning. It was made of white chocolate, with a layer of butter cream and garnished with roasted almonds. It tasted simply delicious. Tje cake melted in the mouth. Though it was not on the sweeter side, but the taste was nice !!

Nothing else.
At least as far as the highly reputed 'English breakfast' is concerned.
Pricey would be a term highly unsuitable to describe it.
I paid six hundred bucks plus tax for toast,poached eggs,bacon,sausage and a glass of sugarcane juice!
And the coffee! Gawwshhh!

My first visit & I totally got mesmerized by the decor. The old English looks, the warmth, all grabbed my attention. For a few moments I thought I went back to the 1930s. We started with stuffed omlette & sandwich. They were awesome. But the dessert made my day. That dark chocolate pastry's taste is still there on my lips when I think 'bout it. A must try of Flury's  is their pasta. The prices are a bit too high but its worth.

A short 'about-closing' Sweet but A visit itself!the simple charms of the olden grandeur encased with the brown cafe like furnishings on the left with it's famed bakery show on the right.. Since it was about closing time - the cafe was already closed ; a quick and much needed dessert trip was justified thus.An unamused but mandate order for the blueberry cheesecake (though the honey & almond tart kept tempting me to order it's variety ,but the appetite refused to it) By looks- I could only visualise one outer aspect to the piece (but couldn't deny ordering) and had seemed like the usual creamy n Creamy sorts ... But the first slice and bite - the Firmness of it, cleared away all doubts.for me it's All about the consistency - and it passed with Bluer hues! :D 
PS- their bakery manager  (one of the first Anglo-Indian's in their 6 gen history,as I was told by my friend) called upon my order, "one slice Blueberry cheesecake for the Lady here." : aah such sweet Happiness ;))

Okay so everyone has a very high opinion about this place! Seeped with history and located in a prime area this place has everything going right for them.
But I have never been a fan of their delicacies. So I assume it would be unfair to judge them. I find their pastries overtly sweet & sticky most of the time. Even the baked products  lacks a little bit of finesse.
But what I like about this particular place is their authentic English breakfast! Complete with scrambled eggs/omelette,  baked beans & toast! It's wholesome and quite filling. Their open sandwich is also one dish I really like to order when I am there! 
I don't usually like to hangout in flurys but I don't mind coming here once in while!

Its featured in legendary places, but the legend just did a cardinal sin, screwed up coffee. I am no stranger to English breakfast and when I came to Kolkata this was the place to have breakfast as I was told. Finally I went there and ordered the most basic thing, the prized and on the top and obvious this English breakfast. It was just OK. I mean like seriously just OK. I hope the repeated words make it clear. I mean it was not something legendary or over the top. OK is the word I would use for it. No change in taste or anything. I liked the roast tomato the best probably because the tomato was ripe and picked well. And the worst thing was the service, the people who serve looks like they other important business and people. We literally had to call a waiter at least twice for anything, even something small like a maple syrup. The place is highly priced, its food is OK and the service is horrible. I guess we are paying the English for the breakfast menu they left behind. If I have it not said it enough I am saying it again that it is just OK

One of my favourite places in Kolkata, Flury's is in many ways, the jewel of Park street. Been there many times. Love their English breakfast, sandwiches and desserts. My favourite dish here, is Chicken cordon bleu, and as for desserts, I love their 'lemon tart', and their special range of chocolates, which they offer during Christmas, specially, 'orange marzipan' and 'dark truffle'. Yes, it is an expensive eatery, but with the class it exudes, the heritage tag of Flury's and the old world English charm, Flury's is a name Kolkatans rely on, when they need to have a good time.

You can start up your day with Baked Beans/Corn on toast, American Or Continental breakfast & there has soo many followers at the menu, but I can assure you that you wont forget the taste. & Of course you cant put apart yourself from trying out the delicious pastries too. Those are simply fantastic. Its a kind of Most old Heritage Continental cuisine, Coffee & Pastry shop.. If you have not tried yet, please go & try its delicious item once...

Few forms part of history and it is this legacy that carries it beyond the basics expected. This place is one of them. You don't arrive at Flury's Park Street for just having the food. This shows the other side of Calcutta which has a long history of Anglo Indians and their influence on various facets of life and Calcuttans ( including Kolkatans) have grown over years to fond this blend. The ambience, the menu choices (especially during the festivities mainly Christian) are delectable and prepared to perfection. If for first time in Kolkata, don't miss out to drop in for a late breakfast here on a Sunday. You might also come across a few celebrities who prefer to hang around

Well as they say think breakfast and this is where you would want to be..  Though the food was good and tasty and for a change quicker service today than usual, I contribute it as there was sufficient number of staff for a weekend..  I like this place and the food, but yes I would say you should be lucky to get it that way, it's true the staff are a bit stubborn and come across as rude. But the disappointment is at times they do serve stale stuff mainly in the pastries I've tried. Otherwise it's just a nice place to relax and enjoy the feel of being at that corner of park street at Kolkata. It gives you a feeling of belonging. And mind you it'll burn your pockets.

It has a very nyc ambience.. One side is the eating section and the other side take away. The confectionery section is the most lovely place in there.. The chocolate brownies..fruit cakes. Marble cakes. Pineapple fresh cream pastries and assorted cookies are mouth watering and a must try.

One of the finest bakeries in the city and a staple Sunday breakfast destination for many, Flury's has stood tall for a real real long time. Love the breakfast spread however the quality of the coffee served probably could be looked upon for especially people like me who lets her morning coffee decide how the day is gonna be! I love love love their club sandwich (I can only manage to finish one slice) and fish n chips although the Spaghetti Bolognese I tasted the other day tasted OK! Love the brownies and the almond cakes...yummm!
My perfect place for a date :-)

pleasing vintage ambience. we ordered eggs Benedict and pancakes. however the hollandaise sauce on my eggs Benedict wasn't up to the mark at all. the pancakes could have been a bit fluffier. being such an old and reputed eatery, they should consider raising the standards and maintaining it.

Again, if you are a foodie, it is a crime if you haven't heard of this place(along with many great joints in the Park Street area).

The ambiance is great. It gives off the same feeling that you get when you see all those english movies where the characters go for coffee, little food, gossip, and great bakery. The glass windows give a very classy, elegant look to this place. It gets crowded, so do plan accordingly.

The service is good. The people are very courteous, be it young or old.

The cakes and other desserts are great. Haven't had the chance to try out their other items yet. You should definitely try their cakes, pastries and other desserts out.

Ambiance - 4.5/5
Service - 4.5/5
Food - 4.5/5

Well I'll only write about what Flury's is famous for, the English Breakfast. From the menu it might not suggest to be a filling option but it surprises you as go on eating the entire thing! It comes with a slight boiled tomato, two pieces of sunshine egg poach, which looks beautiful! The potato pieces help to fill up your tummy. The bread is slight over-toasted and hence is a little hard for my liking and the butter too could be little more mushy. I opted for the watermelon juice. which tastes raw and awesome. Bacon is perfectly boiled & really tastes nice, however I liked the chicken sausage most, although I would have liked to have a couple more pieces than just two of them! The ambiance is extremely pleasant, the architecture of the place takes you back to British India. The staff is well mannered and friendly. Overall I loved the English Breakfast.

Value for money: It costs around 630 including taxes, with the current tax rates. So many may feel it's over-priced, which is actually what it is. However sitting in one of the vintage restaurants of the country, having such quality of food is an overwhelming experience, and you certainly cannot quote a price for experience! Try it atleast once, you will like it.

I am now one year old in kolkata but have rarely visited park street due to heavy work schedule. Saw this place just next to where taxi driver dropped me. I roamed around a bit , tried Bar-B-Q but it was overcrowded, so were many other places. Finally entered this place or I may say, was pulled in this place by the beautiful view it offers from outside. The ambience is realy nice and staff very courteous. The guy even helped in deciding the menu and quantity considering I was alone. Ordered chicken sause pasta. It was good. However I was full enough to taste any cake or pastry. Damn I hate the feeling when I could not taste the famous dish of a known place. Till I visit it next time :)

My ratings
Food:3.5/5- pasta was tasty
Service:4.5/5 -realy liked the way they help us in menue

Well I tried the much hyped / venerated breakfast at Flury's a few months ago. It was a normal English breakfast with nothing on the plate even remotely exciting or outstanding. In fact equivalent to any road-side breakfast available across UK. 

If you can grab a seat in any of the restaurants serving english breakfast in UK, the quality would be at par but you would be offered a greater variety at similar prices. Not sure what the fuss is all about. Of course, the quality and taste is good but at the price they charge I would expect them to serve good food!

Well, we all know that this place is legendary and shit, and I won't bore you to death by reiterating yet another broken record playing of how it still manages to evoke old world nostalgia every single time you walk in there. Wait, does it really? Yes, absolutely. 
Their take away counter with numerous cakes, pasties and bakery products to choose from is definitely the best part. If you haven't tried Flurry's cakes yet, you are really missing something from your life. Their eating place is tastefully decorated, and offers a grandiose view of the Park Street area. However many may find the food here, hardly value for money. One has to love the English breakfast available here however. Especially the sausages, the crispy bacon and that glass of all season fresh watermelon juice that comes with it. A must visit, only if to add some weight to your dining resume.

breakfast @ flurys has been a regular weekend scenario for the past few years. With happy street feature in the last few weekends, post run breakfast has been that extra pleasurable.

Our hungry group of 7 arrived at flurys at sharp 730am, as soon as they opened doors for business on this warm & humid sunday morning.

the orders were for freshly made sandwiches ( tuna, chicken, veg 3 layered club)
Eggs - primarily omelettes with diff stuffings
fresh juices / darjeeling tea & cappucinos.
And yeah a few shared a rum ball. 

Enjoyable as always. plan to return for another happy breakfast tomorrow.

Amidst the ivory façades of park street of Kolkata, this bakery cum deli has carved out its niche space quite prominently. The fancy chandeliers, tables by the aesthetically draped glass windows overlooking the bustle of the city, enchanting aroma of fresh confections and beverages, the silence peeping through the chatter- all this and much more transported me straight to the European coffee houses as seen in the before sunrise, before sunset and before midnight series of movies.

I tried the almond croissant, the decadent rum ball, the cheese and almond tart and the pineapple fresh cream pastry. All were good, nothing spectacular though. I was disappointed by the service however. Just one whimsical man to manage the over crowded pastry counter, that's unbecoming of a confectionery of this repute. Mind you, they also serve the classic English breakfast, sandwiches, pasta and many more items.

But ambience stole my heart. The serenity just inspires you to embrace the solitude within, helps you to clear your mind and create something that's truly your own. Its so happens that the heart of park street houses the living, the pumping and the reinvigorating heart of the city's confection and ambience lovers.

PS: For all those romantic movie buffs, if u haven't watched the before sunrise series. Shame. Watch it asap. Cheers.

Finally got a chance to stop by the much talked about Flurys at Park Street for desserts after a sumptuous day meal.It was my first visit here. Ordered a blueberry cheesecake which was fine. I have definitely had better cheesecakes before. The chocolate truffle was satisfactory. It had a wine like aroma which was way stronger than its chocolate flavor.
However the interior is beautiful at this bakery with perfect interior lights. However the seating arrangement is too clumsy. Overall an okayish experience.

Well when the name Flurys comes to your mind you can feel the taste of rumball and other such mind blowing pastries with an ambience that resembles the environment having an essence of European culture and traditions but all this come at a little hefty price. Recently when I went there I found though the quality of the food that is served has not lost the Flurys touch but still it is serving food at a very overpriced rate.Thus unless somebody is really eager to taste some European cuisines or quality pastries and doesn't mind shelling out an extra buck or more I would suggest they can go to other places around.

Childhood Memories :)

Flurys was always one of my must visit places in Kolkata since childhood. But off late something seems to have gone amiss.  

I wish I could point it out. But the charm of Flurys is no longer there. Maybe the current generation like it, but as a part of a family who has patronised Flury's since it began, I was not satisfied.
Nways , food is nice specially tht all day breakfast is my al time fev . N lov tuna sandwich but i dont like dessert out there. Wen evr they serve rum ball or any sweet dish its gvs me tht creppy feeling like 2 or 3 days old . I dnt kw why. May b its my feelng but i do get it . Evrytime .

Heard a lot about this place from a friend, so made sure to visit it during my short stay in Kolkata.

Present amongst the various other food joints along Park Street, Flury's welcomes you warmly to enter a huge seating area with an appealing ambiance. Their menu has a good range of dishes from appetizers to desserts. They also have something called as "Tea Sandwiches" - they are basically a small portion of the actual sandwich they serve. So, if you want to try something out or just need a small bite with your tea, this is what you should go with. Small portions of sandwiches is something that I have never seen or heard of before. Their all-day breakfast menu is something that is really famous and a must try.

The waiters / stewards are friendly, but a little slow. Their response time and pro-activeness is something

that can be improved. Our steward was really helpful in suggesting us the dishes that we could try. Upon learning that we were new to Kolkata, he suggested a few places that we could visit during our stay. 
Their bakery has to be mentioned. They have some amazing pastries, cakes and desserts chocolates (including the dark ones).

In all, the "oldest" cafe of Kolkata(and probably India since it started operating from 1926) is a must-visit place. So if you are in Kolkata and a food lover then you know where exactly to go.

This is one of the oldest bakery shops in Kolkata. And for a place with such a historical significance, you would expect the manager of the place to be aware that his claim of Flury's being a "French Pastry Shop" is incorrect when their croissant tastes like bread. Their Lasagna is good and so are the honey mustard chicken and barbecued wings. The chocolate cube is my all time favourite.

Been born and brought up in south hardly can you spot an English style breakfast hangout. Flurys a cafe spanning across for various generations definitely keeps up with my expectations.

The whole experience of having their signature tea along with a brownie and cookie absolutely sinful. Chocolate mousse and their panoply of cakes are to die for especially the fruit cakes with perfection infusion of natural flavors.

Special mention to the antique collection which makes the ambience legendary.

Hopeless customer services and especially the chef Augustine gomes. He refused to serve us simple milk bread toasted sandwiches and instead said that French toast is the same. It turned out that French toast was sweet and soggy and not what we wanted . In stead of being helpful the entire staff was helpless. Customer service is important and the manager and chef are expected to be more responsible. Feedback form has also been submitted with details with the name M.S.Bagla.

Well the problem of Kolkata is that once a thing is considered as a jewel, it always remain a jewel. Maybe this equation works for Flurys. Heard a lot about this place from childhood starting from grandmom to elder sister no one stop praising this iconic landmark of the city but alas this old charm definitely didn't work out for me. I decided to visit Flurys with few of my south indian friends from Chennai to get a glimse of the legacy and so called charm of Kolkata. It was sunday evening around 6pm and the chairs were almost empty which was bit surprising. We decided to have few titbits instead of heavy meal. Now i dont have any complaints regarding the decor and ambience of this legendary place ...the grand chandelaur ...the chairs and crockery....all are fantastic in one word...But is that all..When it comes to food it left me highly disappointed. We ordered 1. Cafe Latte 2. Souffle 3. Chocolate truffle pastry 3. butterscotch pastry and 4. lemon tart.....None of these food items were upto the mark according to the steep prices ....taste according to me is very simple nothing special....in this context I must admit that CAKES & KOOKIE JAR serves better pastries and tarts than FLURYS do. Moreover the prices of food items are very high and definitely not worth it. .According to me one time visit is ok....even they are opening small outlets all over the city which are worse too. but at last I must say LEGACY IS NOT EVERYTHING, ITS TIME FOR THEM TO WAKE UP.

The first eatery we entered while exploring Park Street was Flury's. The curlicued script, the candy pink hued board and Bachi Karkaria's review beckoned us and we were invariably drawn to this place. 
The lighting is a tad unflattering and the cake centerpiece is exceedingly dusty, but we didn't let that deter our exhilaration over trying the confectionary. We called for a coffee, a tea and some cookies. The cookies deserve a special mention and were certainly the silver lining of our visit. Sweet but not overly cloying, they made our taste buds do the tango. The tea was so-so and the coffee didn't stir up any emotion within us. We were anticipating a decadent snack, but it was an absolute downer. Unfortunately, Flury's did not live up to the hype or our expectations. You may as well visit the swanky Au Bon Pain next door.

When anyone in my family or in my friend circle goes anywhere, I always to bring me back some food. So this time around, I asked for stuff from the legendary Flury's. So I got to try the veg patty, mutton puff and chocolate brownie. Now I'm not a huge fan of patties, but the veg patty from Flury's was quite nice, and the mutton puff was delicious. The chocolate brownie, however, was just average. Overall, this place has a legendary status in Kolkata, and for that alone, it can be tried.

Flury's is one of the finest bakery shops in town. It has it's own charm which is different from a usual places in the area.

Appropriate for a fine breakfast or a quick grab if you are not that hungry. Most would not find it reasonable to spend so much for a simple breakfast or a quick bite. Well, Flury's offers a wide range of options you can choose from. I've been to this place 5-7 times in the last couple of years and had a fine experience.

The Grand Old Lady of Calcutta Cafes continues to churn out goodies & provide that unique old world ambience that cannot be matched by others.  We had the Jogger's Breakfast, Eggs Benedictine & Beans on Toast which were all excellent.  Service could be better, though, and why they did not have orange juice, amd had watermelon juice in this season, was somewhat of a mystery.

A legendary place to have a true English breakfast. I loved this place right from the moment I caught a sight of it, let alone the moment I entered it. They have great hands when it comes to cakes and pastries and one must not miss their sandwiches : especially the mustard sandwich. The ambience is just perfect. Sit by a window side and I can bet all my money on the fact that you'll experience Park Street like never before. My advice would be 'Do pay a visit'.

On e has to have audacity to review this legend...and what legend it is...Park Street and Flury's are synonymous.....it is the pioneer of English Breakfast Culture in India not only in kolkata...My Mother, my Grandmother have their childhood memoirs sated in this Giant of an entity. My 1st Christmas which i dont even remember was adorned by Flurys' Rum Cake. I remember every Sunday when i used to visit my father he used to deck me up in a lavish new dress bought from Strawberry and we used to head down to Flury's for our Sunday Breakfast. I tasted my 1st Pork Sausage here. I just love there signature Double Decker Club Sandwich and i end up adding extra helping of Bacon on them. They are just the perfect harmonic-al concoction of Egg chicken and Ham with the crunch of lettuce to give you the gourmet fresh feel. I love the smokiness of Bacon with this and with a perfect 1st Flush Darjeeling tea to wash it with it's a marriage of GOD's. I love their Baba Cakes, Chocolate cones which they have but recently stopped making. But what i am a regular disciple of is their Starwberry cubes.....the cascading layer of strawberry flavour and the less sweet but absolutely mushy strawberry cream between strawberry shortcake like sponges..... You feel New Hampshire In Kolkata..... Of all the Double truffle cakes I have had i Love Flurys' the best..it has a definite sweetness with a perfect bitterness enhancing its  taste. The texture is as smooth as silk and as poignant like a luscious new Rolls Royce. But every time one visits flury's one feels he ate less...options are many...but we are just mortal human beings with limited years!!!!!

This is the destination for those who wish to have an English touch to their cup of coffee or tea. Anytime of the day is the best time to come here. If you are a lover of the classics as I am this is the place you should be. Location is such that if you are in park street you would have to be blind to miss it. Fair warning if its a after office visit you might have to wait for a table as they take no reservations. 
Description of how good the food is, will actually be an insult as it is way better. You can enjoy your favorite combo as they have everything. Enjoy you favorite tea or coffee with classic sandwiches to croissants or with a pastry. Their Darjeeling tea is perfectly brewed and goes lovely with ham or chicken sandwiches. Or if you are hungry then have their club sandwich. 
Do try their pastries also. Be careful they are as sweet as they are beautiful

This is the place to go for satisfying your breakfast and desserts cravings. It has been there since eternity. Its sandwiches, croissant, english breakfast, coffee are some of the best kolkata has to offer. You cannot leave the place without trying the chocolate rum balls, lemon tarts, and its wide variety of pastries. The decor of the place is very modern and there is a lot of space to move around.

This is the place that I fall in love with everytime I visit her.Situated at the heart of parkstreet,calcutta, flurys boasts of its rich heritage and legacy. The view by the window, the chandeliers,the high ceiling fans, the central multi tiered cake : it makes one 'wildly romantic'.I have never missed the English breakfast every Single time I came here.I love the fries and the Bacon and the all season watermelon juice. I tried Eggs benedict for the first time here and it won me over complelety,though my favorite here is the coronation chicken croissant : its absolutely delightful.the rich filling keeps u wanting for more.
Flurys and no favorite desserts?it can't be. The flurys truffles are a must try for every chocolate lover, and the Pineapple fresh cream cake is without doubt the richest and most amazing freshcream cake i ever had in my life.
Flurys is a must visit for every calcuttan who has ever lived and loved her.
Verdict : for you, a thousand times over :)

The name speak of heritage. The name speaks of Calcutta (not the mod Kolkata). The name speaks of good old english breakfast! Been there for the first time,and was spell bound! The ambience,the laidback attitude of the place and people around,windows overseeing our fav Park Street-what more can a Calcuttan want? Coming to the food, I would surely not comment on that- the reason being obvious. Loved the experienxce

Big fan of Flury's. Have been here a number of times with my parents and cousins. Ambiance is very English and always has a mixed crowd. Explored almost the entire menu ;). English breakfast , spinach and american corn quiche , egg and mustard sandwich , Onion rings , open egg chicken sandwich all are delectable!
If you love desserts then Rumballs and Tarts are not to be missed. It is always a pleasure to walk into this place.

Day-long breakfast option 

Flury's is a place for continental lovers especially ones who love breads, sandwiches, eggs, and coffees. Restaurant is in one of the oldest area of Kolkata and the interior also reflects the same - tables, fans, and chandelier will remind of you of the pre-independence years.

Breakfast menu is elaborate and highlights the heritage dishes served by the restaurant. However prices are sometimes exorbitant especially the heritage menu is expensive e.g., a 3 egg-omelet will cost you 300+, 150+ for a coffee. Portions for some dishes (e.g., Toast with beans) may be large and hence one many be conservative in ordering dishes. We did NOT find the taste to be overwhelmingly good as we had expected. 

My recommendation is to try afternoon coffee / tea. Afternoon coffee / tea offering consists of a choice of coffee / tea, cucumber sandwich, lemon tart, and a pastry. Black coffee and milk is served separately and you can prepare the coffee as per your taste.

The go to place for breakfast and Sunday brunch! If you have been to park Street and haven't ever been to flury's, well for a foodie that's a shame!!! 
Been there a hundred times and never been disappointed once! From the food to the service to the ambience, PERFECT is the word. I swear by the English breakfast and you might too if you try it, that in case if you haven't yet, as these folks serve the best sausages and bacons in the city.... The pastas are also authentic and will sway you off your feet with their flavour.. The cheese omelettes with bacon and sausages are indeed legendary... And it's an universal fact that  flury's is the heaven for the sweet-tooth... Their teas and coffee are unbeatable too... But it's the sausages and the ambience that I miss the most in shillong...

I went to Flury's in 2007 for the first time. Since then the place has just vitiated into a worthless place to waste your money.
During my last visit i noticed that the food was mediocre and the service was pathetic. The servers were snooty and cold. The tables were not cleaned properly and everything looked shabby..
Its sad to see a good place turn to this.

If you are looking for an early English-ishtyle breakfast in Kolkata, this is the place you could be. This is already a part of Kolkata's culinary history and map and dates back to the British sometime in the 1920s. 

Today Flury's, after much renovation, looks roomy and is a nice place to enjoy your coffee, bacon and omlette. Catch up on the cakes and in-house pastries as well. 

People queue up in the evenings to catch savoury cakes and breads. The downside remains the price - 320/- for a breakfast omlette remains pricey. And though better confectionary options have come up all around the city, Flury's remains the destination of the connoisseur.

This is perhaps a non-review. From Elgin Road we came down to Park St at around 1500 today so that we can settle in at Flury's and gorge over pastries/cakes and tea. After all, Flury's has renown as a "tea room". We were shown to a table near the window that was yet to be re-laid. Food scraps from a previous meal were on the chairs and around the area. After requesting a staff member to take steps to make the table ready, we walked over to the pastry section to make some selections. That done, we came over, asked for a list of tea/coffee selections and indicated that we would like to walk over to add an assortment of pastries to our afternoon tea. The staff insisted that we can get tea only if we order something from the lunch menu. 

Since we weren't very keen on having lunch, we did end up moving out. The question though is whether 1500 is really the "lunch time" for a 'tea room'. And does that prevent anyone from ordering an afternoon tea and associated savories. I've had better memories of this establishment and it would now be impossible to visit it again if there's so much focus on "meals and time slices"

Undoubtedly a legend in its own right. I have been seeing this restaurant since my school days, more so because park street is where my school used to be. The last time I had visited this Flurys was  way back in 2008, so it was my priority in the To-Do list during my recent visit to Kolkata. We visited this place for breakfast on a week day. As always, it was more or less full yet we managed to get a table. There were lot of orders from our table - egg benedict, french toast, chicken and cheese sandwich, pancakes dipped in maple syrup, flurys special tea and coffee. I kinda liked the egg benedict and the sandwiches. Ambience was good too. Coming to the low points, I was surprised that there are too many. Starting with their service, all I can say is that Flurys should focus more on this side. Earlier it never used to be like this. We had to call on the waiters multile times before they looked at us and then came up to our table. Several times they failed to clear off the table and one, I was given an used fork when I asked for a fresh one. Also, we had requested the sandwiches to be served along with the tea/coffee but they gave us the sandwiches first and then after around 20mins, we got our beverages. That was pretty annoying. Hope they mend their ways soon because we all love to see the legendary Flurys stand tall!

Right in the corner of the Park Street is this legendary shop. Large glass windows and shiny lights are the external beauty and amazing palate satisfaction is the one to talk about here. I didnt have any reservations obviously, hence, had to wait for a couple of minutes before was seated. Again, it took a moment to gain the waiter's attention, agreed I wasnt waving my hands or going ape on the table :p I ordered an egg n cheese sandwich from their legendary section and a serving of bacon and a double espresso. The coffee arrived in no time and it was bitter and was very strong, just the way I like it. The bacon and sandwich arrived soon after, and thats when things got a bit different. 
The bacon had almost no salt in it, yes, I can add to it, but, bacon, when fried, should have some salt in it. Also, 3 strips for 110 Rs, is a tad too costly.
As for the sandwich, the bread was warm, the fillings were not. Maybe thats how sandwiches are, but I didnt like it so much. 
I was pretty interested in the chandelier, took a photo too :p
And I feel, the waiters should smile a little more. It seems that in the attempt of being impersonal and formal, they appear  a bit rude. 
This place is pricey, no doubt, but most of us, the student-recently employed bunch, wont mind visiting this place a few times though.

Legendary outlet with a neat ambience. You'll hear all folks trying to speak in English. Oh how I wanted to blurt out "Dada, oi cake ta deen to!". Only had a rum ball and cinnamon roll for a frugal damage of Rs 111. Was it worth it? Yes! Go there. Just go there. Pretty sure that the other desserts will also be pretty good but cannot comment about any other food.

Another thing to note is that the staff here is just too laidback. Did not like that fact one bit.

Being there, at the heart of Park Street, the cafe expresses a feel of aristocracy and sophistication with brilliant set of cutlery accompanied by very exquisite ambiance. Quantity is comparatively a bit low as compared to the price but it could be looked over. Each and every item in the menu list is very tasty. PLease vivit the cafe if you are willing and i bet it wont disappoint

ANY amount of words I cough up for this place will fall short, well, to be honest this is not a review for the a la carte food but the savouries, breads, chocolates and cakes/pastries available. Flury's is a truly heritage spot and I have been a visitor with my parents since I was born, it truly holds a special place like countless other Calcuttans and pretty much all my birthdays have had a cake from them (the same cake, nearly every single year). The quality of their cakes is extraordinary and so are the patties and other savouries. 

The legend of Mr. and Mrs. J. Flury carries on...a century of excellence is not far away! :)

The place needs a review not because we doubt its credentials but because it simply needs a note of appreciation. The must have open Swiss sandwich has not altered but may have bettered if i am not too prejudiced! The tiramisu deeply reminded me of Italy and the soft music always helps.

Flury's is some sort of an institution over here, the beloved breakfast place where it is a must visit when you are in the city. While I would always pick up their plum cakes from their airport counters (and they were much appreciated back home), I only happened to visit their flagship outlet on the first saturday of the year. 
There was a waiting for about 20 minutes at 10:30 AM.
The place inside has a nice old worldly charm. I was very excited about finally being there and went overboard in ordering - 2 of us ordered Chicken Mustard Grilled Sandwich, Beans on Toast, Masala egg scramble and Grilled Veggies & Pesto Ciabatta along with fresh watermelon juice and green tea.
All the excitement kinda went down when the food came. 
The chicken mustard sandwich was dry, with pieces of boiled chicken in some sort of ready made mustard sauce. The baked beans were again tinned baked beans with a slice toast drowning somewhere making it really soggy if not had right away (the only nice touch was the chopped onions and chillis on the side). The vegetable ciabatta was dry. 
The service was slow but that could also be attributed to a packed house (but one assumes them to be used to such crowds).
I would have been less critical about the food if it was not such a hyped place like Flury's.
From next time onwards, will just stick to their cakes.

The place is a delight to visit, specially during Christmas and New Year - very nicely decorated and lighted up both inside and outside (park street). It's a perfect place to catch up with friends over coffee and light snacks.

They had special menu on Christmas Eve. I must say their Penne in White Cream sauce was fabulous - not sure if it's there in the regular menu. Grilled chicken sandwich for my friend was ok, nothing fancy for the price. However, I must admit that I was let down by the only cake (Cappuccino) I tried, given Flurys is primarily known for its bakery products. The cake was nothing close to being soft and the taste of the cream was not the usual loveable cappuccino. I guessed it right seeing the cakes right away and I am sure Kookie Jar is notches better than Flurys as far as cakes are concerned.

Prompt service and helpful stewards.

I say this with the heaviest heart that Flury's is no longer the institution it once was.  Service is stern and shoddy at best; food is mediocre; and, most disappointing, the 3-lb fruitcake I ordered from them weeks before Christmas was the driest fruitcake I have ever served at a party.  I expressly apologized to my guests about the quality of the cake.  It is unlikely any of them will ever visit Flury's after eating the made-to-order catastrophe.

Went there, enjoyed to be there and of course got entirely spell-bound with our emotions. Lets come to the food quality. Tried sandwiches, pasta and the favourite grilled fish in association with coffee. Black Forest was the ultimate show-stopper hah hahh! Fell in love with this place and its delicious servings. Wish to be there in future too.

The place was packed .. we got the table and we had ordered five sandwiches ,the famous puffs, (a must try),egg Benedict and a croissant . Most of the food were good to taste but the chip served along was leftover from the package ..broken in very small pieces ..we didn't bother as we don't like chips but they shouldn't serve sub standard product. Rest everything were great to go. to finish the meal we had coffee and it was not that great. 
So choose your order but puffs are must try. Cheers..

Tried the Eggs Benedict and Flurry's Vienesse Coffee. Both are an amazing delight. The wholistic decor of the cafe gives one a feel of the victorian ambience. The courtesy of the staff speaks itself for the worldly match of the place.

Flury's the mightiest of the confectioners is unsurpassingly elegant and enriched in etiquettes. It gives you an impression of a formal ballroom. At the same, all the wonderfull baked sweet treats help creating a frivolous atmosphere as well. We had ordered sandwiches and cakes, of which, the balance between crispness & mellowness was absolutely perfect and taste was exceedingly divine. The price listings were pretty over the top though, which is expected as one cannot find a better confectioner in town.

A great place to dump all your worries and enjoy the start of the day with a cup of coffee and toast. Placed at the heart of park street, its one of the reasons to visit this place once a day atleast. Though its one of my fav place to hangout in kolkata, you might have to think twice if your pocket is running a bit short. A bit expensive, like a pot of darjeeling green tea may mount to 200, but a peaceful and cozy place to start your day with.

This is a destination in Kolkata, if u in Kolkata it wud be rare u would not visit this place, hv been here many a times but during Christmas this place is just awesome. 
If u plan to dine in at the restaurant u wi be waiting for long during this period.
The plum cakes or the rum balls or rum and raisin cakes are to die for 
As u enter the place the aroma just pulls u and makes u salivate 
Their sweet bread is a must have 
A must visit if u in Kolkata 
You will fun people from all ages here

This place is just legendary and undoing one of the finest bakeries I've ever been to. I have too many fond memories of this place. When I was a child my mother used to take me to Flury's often on weekends. We used to sometimes enjoy the breakfast otherwise we grabbed my favourite pastries. The chocolate boat and truffle have always been my first choice. The breakfast here is legendary. I Remember visiting this place on so many different occasions like Christmas eve or day and New year's, I think I have been here even during Pujo. The staff here is so nice and helpful and since we have been visiting since good knows when most of them recognise is at the first glance. Makes me feel so special! The decor steals away hearts effortlessly. The look and feel of the place from outside would act as a magnet that draws people inside. At least that's the way I feel about Flury's.
But that's enough nostalgia!

Coming to my most recent visit there on 25th night, 2014... There's no better way to celebrate Christmas than to have coffee and cake at this wonderful place full beauty and heritage. One must dig into the desert and hash brown here! Pure food-love!
The Dundee cake.... A must buy for Christmas! 
Don't miss it! :)

P.s. the pictures are oldies.. I forgot to click pics of the food on 25th. Too much of excitement, you see!!

Went there during lunchtime on 26.12.14. Surprisingly they had a special Christmas menu which had only 3 veg items out of which one was unavailable. Ordered veg club sandwich which was so so. It seems flury's has been decreasing the quantity of coleslaw put inside a club sandwich. Service was very bad. Had to ask for water thrice before getting. Given the high prices quantity and service should be much better. Nostalgia adds but is not a substitute to these.

The food at Flury's was delicious. The English breakfast was sumptuous. Club sandwiches were very filling. The pasta (tomato) perfectly balanced the tang and sweetness. Even the tea had a very nice flavor. 
Ambience was good. 
The drawback is that it will be pretty hard on your pocket.

The food n ambience is quite good .... Nyc having ur morning brkfast watching the city waking up through its glass walls ....

A bit costly .... Breakfast for 2 will take at least 1000 bucks.... But quality is not at all compromised!

N the reason to cut that 1 mark is the space crunch.... The tables are not big enough to accommodate all the ordered dishes...

I had Christmas morning breakfast and loved it. One of the best places to have English breakfast in Kolkata. The level of services dropped drastically due to huge rush as it was a holiday but it was still a good experience. The best part was the Christmas songs which added a lot to the festive mood.

I was on a rushed visit to Kolkata on work but the foodie in me could not resist visiting Flurry's. Since 1927 it says. The ambience lives up to expectation. 
I came there closer to Christmas and the store was decorated in festive spirit. We opted for the breakfast. And since bacon is not me they were kind enough to substitute it with extra chicken sausages.
Frankly as I bite in, it is a standard breakfast.
A 4 star resort in Mahableshwar can serve you better. Even if I decide to pay for the ambience and heritage still a bit overrated.

Go/No go meter: go if you want to have a "Gaylordish" experience but frankly there are places with better experience at a cheaper cost.

I had a whistle stop in Kolkata on way to my backpacking trip to Kohima and was so excited for , what to me was a pilgrimage, to the Mecca of heritage  colonial fine dine and culture in India , The Park Street area , More specifically to one particular shrine of fine dine there , Flury's. 

With only two meals , a breakfast and a lunch , planned for my stopover , the first thing I did as soon as I reached Kolkata , at around nine in the morning , was to hop in a cab and head straight to the Park street area. Wandering around there , soaking in the heritage feel , walking through a bookshop , I was finally in front of my destination and it did not disappoint me at all , huge , spotless clean ,glass windows , a wood and glass door with a handle in shape of the restaurants name a a polite English speaking doorman , who informed me that I have to wait a while to be seated , no problems , I just stand around for a while and am told that my table is ready and I 
Walk into a sparkling clean , bright , happy feeling hall with a high celling  and a huge chandelier hanging down from it  As I sit down at a neatly laid  table , I notice a separate area with showcases displaying their baked good , some elegant wood and glass , tall cases , displaying more goodies and a most spectacular & huge Multi tier  cake , in all , a perfect setting for what I thought is going to be a perfect breakfast. 
Here , let me explain why I am devoting so much time on describing the decor and the ambiance , because it was these combined with their top notch service that earned them this high rating from me and unfortunately not the breakfast . Being fair to them , I think I was partly responsible for this less than perfect experience. Let me explain. 

After being seated by a smartly presented and polite server , it was the time to place my order , and this is where I guess I erred. Noticing a standy sign on the table announcing the introduction of new international preparations , I decided to to bypass all the delicious sounding heritage breakfast dishes in the main menu for one of my all time favourites , though a new introduction to their menu , Eggs Benedict ( ₹ 303/-+ taxes but note NO Service Charge ) to be washed down with a brewed Coffee ( ₹125/- plus taxes ). Both big mistakes , ordering a predominately American dish at a place known for its imperial cuisine and a Coffee at a Tea House :). 

The coffee that arrived first was quite weak on both counts , strength and flavour and I was just getting over my disappointment that I was presented with a very sad sight , The Eggs. They looked so lonely lying all alone in that elegant BIG plate , guess I am so used to seeing them served with some sides , maybe seasoned country fries or coleslaw or a skinned boiled potato or even a merger lettuce leaf and some slices of tomato , anything at all , but this plat had just the eggs and even they looked quite unappetising , dressed with a very meagre amount of Hollandaise sauce . The disappointment increased as I dug into them , the sauce was , not only very little in quantity but it also lacked the creamy texture and the flavour , the muffin was just ok again lacking the sharp flavour that  I am used to. As I took a bite of the first half , the bacon was done quite nicely but the sunny side up was over cooked , the center had gone all hard and cooked. Bad , but what was worst was when I ate the second half , the egg here was perfect but the ham very under cooked , it was as if the two halves were cooked by different people  and it was maybe the first time I had a dish , any where , when one half was over cooked and the other one so under cooked. A total wash out , so not expected form an establishment with such high standards .

So am I going back ? definitely , but this time would stick to their tried and tested old time favs and no experiments at all and will I recommend it ?  again 100 percent , a very well worth experience , I surely hope , but that is only if you order right :)

ENJOY

Flury's has recently come up with a Christmas menu which is on from the 12th of December, 2014 to the 4th of January. The two-course menu offers a choice of a main (with turkey/pork/chicken/fish/veg) and a dessert. I opted for the turkey with the panettone for dessert while my friend went for the pork chops. 

The pork chops were amazing, the fat-to-meat ratio perfect. I did find my turkey to be slightly tough, but the cranberry sauce, perfectly cooked vegetables and the sausage stuffing went a long way to make up for it. The service was slightly slow and they did mix up an order in our table, but it was an honest mistake so I can give them that. 

 We also liked the warm Panettone, which is more like a pudding rather than the bread I was expecting, but tasty nonetheless. I also carried home some Sacher torte sliced and rum balls for my family, which they loved.

definitely a good restaurant but i think it's a bit Overrated. The food is Good but the cost is way too much. I mean who would want to pay Rs.250 for an omelette? The staff is trained but somewhat not very friendly. The environment is great. 
                                                     The bakery is excellent. The cakes never fails to amuse me, the items will also not fail to satisfy you. So i'd only recommend this place for some snacks, as there are other way better places to eat a full mean in park street.

Legendary place, needs no introduction. Flury s is a park street landmark, a Calcutta monument and the ultimate colonial cafe. Any table is a cosy corner and one can sip and talk. In at a wrong time, the fag end of an afternoon , an expresso and cheese plain sandwich were the light orders keeping the larger pie due for next time.
Have been coming since the last thirty years making it one of the oft visited places in my life.

It reminds you of a cafe in europe on the inside. Go there for the ambience! The taste of the pastries: i would rate a 6/10. The display of the pastries is an eye-candy. A must visit for a kolkata newbie.

Flurys is considered to be one of the finest tearooms in Kolkata. On my first visit to Kolkata my friend from that city made a list of eateries for me that are a must do in Kolkata. Flurys featured among the top 5 in that list. So we went there for brunch on an early afternoon.

Flurys has a classy feel to it. They have a good number of managers and serving staff who manage the restaurant so seriously and attentively, looks like they are going to perform some complex neurosurgery. From table cloths to cutlery to condiments - everything is managed with precision.

At one corner, they sport a glass case displaying cakes and bakery items. We had a look and couldn't resist drooling on their delectable selection.

After some brain storming, we ordered grilled chicken sandwiches, tuna sandwiches, egg sandwiches and tea. All the sandwiches were fresh, mild and tasted out of the world. The tea was aromatic and complemented the meal very well. For sweets, we had shortlisted rum balls and vanilla pastry.  The Rum ball turned out to be an item to die for. It was super delicious and looked so amazing - straight out of the cover page of a gourmet magazine. The vanilla pastry had a thick white icing layer on top and was soft and creamy below. It turned out to be another little piece of heaven.

We were seated next to the glass wall facing Park Street, which is equivalent to Delhi’s Connaught Circus. When one is travelling to a new city, apart from the brick and wall structures, it's the people and food that give a city its character. Sitting at Flurys, one gets an almost decadent pleasure leisurely biting into the food while looking at the people hurrying by on their businesses.

We would have spent the whole afternoon there, talking and sipping tea but we could see a lot of people were waiting for tables. And now we knew why. Absolutely 10 on 10 experience.

It is definitely a heritage place of Kolkata. It is famous for its Breakfast and Bakery items. Located in the ever popular Park street area and is mainly flocked by people in the morning for a great English breakfast and a cup of tea/coffee. I personally felt that the food do not justify the prices which are very steep. Quantity is less for the price they charge especially for English breakfast. You get the same breakfast platter at half the price with a better quantity and same quality in the best breakfast place in a more expensive city like Bangalore. So thats a bit turn off for me. Otherwise food is good enough barring the quantity. Service is good too.

Flurys its not just a restaurant but it is a heritage for Kolkata..so if you wanna be a true kolkatan or should I say intellectual kolkatan then you should visit flurys atleast once and have a tea and pastry there...I had been there for numerous times...whenever I visit park street I always pick a pastry from flurys...now...
1.ambience-i have told it heritage you just go and check why I have told like this only
2.food-pastry n cakes are good but sandwich and tea are really pathetic here(Amar bhalo lageni that's it)
3.reception-its park street and its flurys I have nothing more to say
4.price-a bit costly but kinda okay..
To conclude just visit this one...its a part o Anglo bong culture..so if you are bong then you have to visit flurys...

Flurys

18, Park Street, Kolkata

Serving the fine European traditional confectionary on Park Street in Kolkata, Flurys (a legendary tearoom) is a popular meeting place for all ages. It has authentic Swiss and International delicacies to serve to the city.

A tea room, which was only for British and the affluent class, had always drawn me towards it. Finally in one of my visits I made it a point to drop in there. It was an awesome experience being there. The ambience, the culinary and the desserts were just wow. 

We had ordered Flurys original open sandwich (with ham & bacon, tomato and fried eggs) and Chicken & Mustard sandwich. The sandwich, when served, was looking heavenly. As the name suggests the open sandwich was open and one can see all the items used to make it. If we go by the taste of it I would say it was bang on. The veggies which were used had a crunch and the chicken was properly cooked. The egg was kept sunny side up on the sandwich.

The price list will surely not burn a hole into the pockets.

If one wants to enjoy the evenings in Park Street this place could be an option. It's a place one should visit when in Kolkata.

Flury's ..it was a birthday surprise actually. Always had a wish to go there  during our hangouts at park street. One of the most lavish and highly built restro of park street. Its highly spacious with giant ceilings following primitive architecture patterns with heavy lights all over . It provides one of the Best ambience in the town. Coming to the food we ordered coronation chicken filled crossiant and flury's sundae. The crisp of crossiant was very good  but sundae I didn't like that much. Waiters aren't that helpful. Overall a so so experience .But would surely like to visit again for a better experience :)

I probably would have given this place a rating of 3. But because of the hype and the low value for money it deserve no more than a 2. This place has been my second disappointment in Park Street after Bar-b-q last night. Both featured in the Legendary list on Zomato.
For a place with a queue outside for breakfast, I expected nothing but heavenly food. What I got was the opposite. Here's what we ordered:
American Pancakes - I can't even begin to describe how bad this was. Even McDonald's makes 10x better pancakes for a quarter the price!
Beans on bread - What I got was one thick fluffy slice of bread almost floating on a plate full of baked beans.
Egg Mustard Sandwich - Another disaster!
Chicken Croissant - Just about alright. Same as what you would get at Dunkin Donuts.
Chicken Club Sandwich - The only saving grace.
The decor and service do not matter if the food is so disappointing. This place is not at all worth the hype!

I guess my journey as a foodie can be attributed to the proximity of my college to the legendary eateries of park street.  Flury's being one of the prime places. From standing in a queue for the Christmas cakes to early morning taste of English breakfast.  My first taste of bacon and also the yummy pastries.  Still go there whenever I am in the city.  The charm and dazzle seem to have faded and what a decade ago looked awesome seems a bit jaded.  Maybe it's my imagination or reality but somewhere or somehow the glitter of it's ambience seemed a bit on the downward, but as long as the food remains same I will continue my sporadic dates with the oldest tea room in Calcutta.

I guess there is nothing new to be written about Flury's. It is as synonymous with Park St and Kolkata indeed as say, the Taj Mahal with India. The food is very, very good. Decor, top class. Good place to while away your time as you look out of the glass facade at Park St.Pastries are a speciality here.

Think about a breakfast outing and this is the place that hit’s your mind first. Flury’s is one of the oldest and the most appealing posh eatery in the Park street area offering authentic English breakfast. The variety of menu will simply lay you off, however if you want to experiment with the spread this isn’t the place as it might hit your budget a little too hard. Flury’s is more like a must-visit destination for kolkatans and outsiders.  Delicacies that you must not miss out are items from coupes and sundaes and the special Flury’s bakes. Food wise I would rate is average, and but yes the place is over-hyped.

The roots of Flury's takes us down to 1927 when it was found by Mr & Mrs. J Flury. Flury's is not just a restaurant it is something without which Park street would have been incomplete. It is the most important and eminent feather of thw crown named "parkstreet". This joint has given a new definition to confectioner and bakery in kolkata. The view from the glass panes adjacent to the tables gives an unmatchable experience to your visit to flury's. The detailed and transparent optical view ofbthe street which never sleeps brings a precious experience to the table. Flury's have taken monotonous activity of having breakfast and evening tea and supper to a new level.  A Breakfast at flury's along with the exquisite few blended with unmatchable hospitality is something which couldnt be defined with words. The "jogger's breakfast", "muffins", " chilli cheese toasts" etc; are some of the iconic offerings of flury's which laid a permanent and irreplacable foundatio among the heart of kolkata's people.  After experiencing the unmatchable realm of flury's, there is one thing i can say i.e. Flury's complete's (the times square of kolkata)  Park Street.

My friends have been recommending me Flury’s for a couple of years, though I know very well that it does not require any recommendation. Though my dad gets my birthday cakes only from Flury’s, I never went there to have food directly from the counter. Last Wednesday while returning from office I went to Flury’s. And I do agree that it is one of the best bakeries and food joint in the city. 

It has a high ceiling, curvy chairs and the old café ambience which will transport you to the colonial era. The shop is divided into two parts- the seating area serves amazing breakfast, nice Darjeeling tea, coffee and other beverages, sandwiches and other snackies as well! My favorite is the Chicken and mushroom quiche- you should definitely try it! On the other side they have a bakery; their chocolate cake is awesome though I think it is a bit over priced. If you want to catch up with an old friend and spend many hours in peace, this is definitely the place to go. 

I felt that the service could be improved a bit more and made prompt. But overall this is a place to be!

A pâtisserie... a confectionery... a breakfast place - call it whatever you may - but it's a place that won't disappoint you.
The British world charm to the place, only adds up to its pluses. This is one place that I visited once and wanted to visit all over again and every day during my 15 day stay in Kolkata.
There sweet sour chicken breast was to Die for. It's one thing, I didn't mind reordering!
And if I visit Kolkata again, I would surely visit this place again!

Flury's has the reputation of being one of the costliest restaurants in Kolkata.. Truth be told, in fact, I didn't find it quite that costly.. It was on the higher side, but the money you pay, is well compensated by the quality and amount of the food..
I had been there two or three times, and this review is based on all of the experiences..
We mainly had sandwich there, which was really good, and I should say, its a band for the buck..
However, its light, and if you are looking for something heavy, go for the three-layered club sandwich, which is enormous.. More than enough for one person, but still, would leave you wanting for more.. The staff are courteous, and the interior is beautiful, along with a nice ambience.. Would like to visit again whoever possible..

lovely location. can drop in at anytime of the day or evening. sunlit atrium makes the room more spacious. and the chandelier is a masterpiece to make the evenings memorable.

I am afraid but this place has gone downhill since ages. Perhaps it is fair to say that except for the bakery items rest do not even hold a candle in front of any half decent brasserie. Inflated pricing demands quality food but not to be the case here.  I guess except for some fading memories of childhood this place has nothing to offer anymore...

Their Chocolate Boat has been my all-time favourite but only recently I happened to try their much-hyped breakfast and I must say that it exceeded my expectation. Really impressive! We called for English Breakfast and the Open Swiss Sandwich, Coffee and Watermelon Juice. All that made for one of my most favourite meals in Calcutta. Flury's in fact is one of those places that contribute in defining the city. The prices however, I must say are going to pinch your pocket. Recently I stumbled upon a picture of their Peach Melba and it looked so gorgeous that I can't wait to give a try.

I recently bought Muffins which was very bad as it was not properly baked . I called up Flurys and told the person who picked up the phone to check the quality . After a while I again called to check and was told that they have removed the Muffins from the counter as it was not good . Today i.e. 30th Oct 2014 I again purchased Muffins (Invoice no 57443) and it was again underbaked . I again called up and enquired that it is a standard product being made by them for decades then why poor quality again and again . I was again told (after they checked the Muffins at their end) that they have removed it from the sales counter . When I asked that we Kolkatans trust Flurys and it should not have happened for the second time . The person on the phone told me that if there was a complaint in writing then they can take action against the chef . I told them that they should check On Zomatos today so that they can see the written complaint as well as all Foodies .

The two old gentlemen behind the counter were a pleasure to talk to.

Flury's has always been a legend around these parts. No visitor to the city of joy has left without at least once entering this pink and brown tearoom from the past.
Whenever I'd come to Cal, going to Flury's was a great treat.
Go in. Get yourself a coronation croissant sandwich. Finish off with a cup of Darjeeling tea. And don't forget to get a box of pastries for the people back home.

My association with Flury's dates back to my childhood days. Have been regularly visiting the place since then. It seems that the quality of food has declined to what it was 20 years ago. The cost of some items are a bit on the higher side. I do have a nostalgic soft corner for the place however the service can be a wee bit disappointing at times!

Flurys it is one of those places which truly defines Park Street. And it also defines Kolkata is some was. Many memories linked to this place.
Like the one of a friends birthday treat. We went and ordered Mushroom on toast and when it was served it was completely soggy. We din like it at all. Just then another friend arrived. He instructed the waiter to get another Mushroom on toast. Just that this time get the mushroom and toast separately.
And then we realized that this is simply the best Mushroom on Toast that I have ever had.
We ordered croissants which were freshly made and excellent. Wonderful place, always enjoy going there for breakfast.

I don't know where to start and where to end commenting about this restaurant.Three generations of my family has always been dining out here my grandad in his business days,my father in his college days an myself in my childhood and youth too.The former setting of the restaurant i liked more than the modern one because it is too much commercialized.The brown couches still remind a good deal about the pastries which were served on a tray and brought to you and you had to select one.Those days are probably gone now but the new one is also very nice and got a European touch to it ie mixture of all countries not only Britain.The heritage items are worth trying out like the patties which are now flattened out instead of its former puffy look.The coffee is still nice and aromatic.Altogether this is one place where you can go and have a real WONDERFUL time whether it be with friends,family or anybody.

This place is less about food, more about nostalgia. The bakery items are good, rest are just average. Extremely overpriced, the breakfast combos will literally burn a hole in your pocket.

Serves one of the best breakfasts. Try the double eggs, the chicken sausages, potato crispy's, bacons strips, baked tomato, the mushroom puffs .... add bread toasts. Sign it off with a cup of coffee. Try some of the chocolate truffles, dark chocolate bars, brownies and the dry cakes too. 

The service is pretty prompt.

Complete value for money and more... Stand in a queue if you land late in the morning

Flury's for me is waking up early for the most amazing breakfast. Yes, you need to be really early, else you end up standing in a long queue. One of the oldest , well decorated tea room not only serves good food but also has the awesome view of Park street. One should try the bacon, sausages and the omelettes!! They are very nicely done. However, I am not too fond of their cakes. They are very sweet. Also, Flury's is slightly expensive. However, its a must visit at least once.

I can't write anything new about this place that has not already been said or reviewed. This classic breakfast located in Park street has been a frequent visit for pastry lovers and loyalists for years.

The American Breakfast is a whole meal. The double eggs, the chicken sausages, the bacons strips,the baked tomato, the mushrooms and the potato crispy with a side order of bread toasts is all in all a heavenly breakfast. And a huge cup of coffee to end it with. The bacon strips are tasty and crispy. The chicken sausages are lightly sauteed on a light flame and nicely done. It is worth every single penny.

Come early or you might have to stand in a queue like many other enthusiasts who have come to experience the american breakfast.

My first trip to Kolkata and my Bengali friends suggested Flury's. Flury's has great ambience. However the service is bad. I wasnt that hungry so I only had tea which I did not enjoy much. There is also a Flury's at the airport where I had the rum ball. Again the rum ball was not that great and was too heavy.

I was visiting Kolkata from mumbai during navratri this year (2014) and had read that Flury's is one of the oldest and most popular cafe/restaurant/confectionery. Walking distance from the park street metro station- this place is located in a beautiful area. Walked into the place and from the doorman to the waiters smile at you and welcome you.

AMBIANCE: Try sit by glass wall from where one can see the hustle n bustle of the street. The place has a very happy vibe. It is clean, big and spacious. The majestic chandeliers really birghtens up the place one the sun goes down. 

FOOD: things i tried here were, the brewed coffee, mushroom puff, omelette and toast. I even bought some of the chocolate truffles, dark chocolate bars, brownies and the dry cakes. The service was pretty quick, the food was absolutely delicious. The first day i went here was just for coffee in the evening. The place was so good that i went the 2nd time in 4 days specially for their very famous breakfast. I thoroughly enjoyed myself both the times i was here. These guys are the top of their game. 

PRICING: i wouldn't call this place particularly cheap (around 500 just for breakfast) , however it is worth every penny. It's an experience in it self. 

As a tourist i absolutely loved the place, food and he service.

Writing a review for Flury's and appreciating the beauty of Taj Mahal are very similar. There's hardly anyone who doesn't know how wonderful both the places are. Somehow, even after being born and brought up in Calcutta, I never had the opportunity to try the English Breakfast (which is the speciality of this place, in case if you don't know). As days passed my urge for having the English Breakfast at Flury's grew stronger. So, this time when I came to Kolkata for a week, I couldn't resist myself anymore. One fine morning, I headed to Flury's and ordered for the much talked about platter. I wasn't surprised at all. Many a times I have found popular dishes and platters of various restaurants quite overrated, but surely this one met my expectations. If you have a lunch plan after this, please keep it in the late afternoon or better postpone it to some other day as it is a pretty heavy breakfast. There's no point talking about the quality of the food at Flury's because everyone knows how delightful it is. But sadly, I was disappointed with the pace of the service, which I felt is little slow. Overall it is an amazing experience and if you are in the city, this is a much try.

I have been to this place after hearing a LOT about this brand! First take was AMAZING! Transparent one - You can have a look from the roadside. I feel this is one of the way you attract more traffic to your store. Branding was awesome - no doubt about it! Once you see the place, you feel like going inside and try them out. 

I was not an exception - Ambiance looks cool to me and was attracted by the decor. I was about to step inside when the security guard informed me about 10 mins wait. I agreed to it. He took down my name and we waited for our turn. It took exactly 10 mins for our turn to come. Never mind, after all I am going to try out something big in the world of food joint (In my mind).

As we stepped inside, we're given a corner table at the dead end. I was OK with that too. I skimmed through the menu and found the confectionery items along with a Durga puja special menu costing around 750 + taxes if I am not wrong and the dishes were mouth watering to me. But, we're full by then as we had lunch just an hour before :( Missed something - I thought. 

Anyways, we ordered for 3 cup of cappuccino on the first go and a piece of cake to try at a later point of time. The taste looks normal to me - you can have the same kind of taste in any other confectioners. Be its coffee or the cake. Everything is the same only the brand name! 

Ambiance is pretty good. I liked it and enjoyed the moments and also the clicks!!! Service is good enough. Pricing is super high! 

Overall, experience is OK OK. You can try out once if you heard N number of times about this brand like me and satisfy your DESIRE! :)

Just for the pastry they offer. They might charge you 100bucks for 1 piece...but you can rest assured that they are being honest with what they are offering.

You will have just 1 from them.. and in the end will leave peacefully.. smiling and feeling ever confident of making an awesomely good choice.

You in the end stand to gain the following:
a lot... less calorie intake
.. huge taste bud jump
.. high morale
.. and a lot of happiness

...at the price of 4 pastries compared to any normal shop..

So just ...chill chill...just chill...
and enjoy!! :)

Although Flury's is an authentic restaurant reminiscent of the 30's , my only quibble is that the place should definitely be open till late and wifi enabled .
The inexhaustible menu has everything , ranging from an English style breakfast to exotic desserts & cake varieties.
There's an array of sandwiches, grills, salads & pastas of your choice.
How to forget the chocolates, cookies & pastries. They are to die for.!
Come here for the experience. It's totally worth it.

Its a heritage place in the heart of Park Street since the times of the British raj, often visited by tourists and foreigners. The shop is incredibly beautiful and big, well lit & decorated throughout the year.....feels like being in a dessert shop in London/Paris ^_^

It has loads of variety in cakes, pastries, mousse, patties, breads, sandwiches, etc. The quality is supreme. The taste is even better. 
But I think the food in here is overpriced. The same quality of food can be found in Cookie Jar & Kathleen at a far lower rate. Its for this price that I prefer not going here at times. The quantity is even lesser when compared to the price. 

People with sweet-tooth should definitely visit here!!

Kolkata's oldest tearoom, Flury's has a cozy ambience and genuine old world charm. The spread from their bakery was quite comprehensive and looked delicious, I always appreciate places that make a good croissant. However, wasn't too happy with the food. Felt like it did not live up to it's hype. Must try the strawberry milkshake, though. 
This place is a must visit for it's ambience, maybe coffee and desserts, food not so much.

You are Bengali residing in Kolkata and you don't know about Flury's.... Well can't be i am sure. Flury's at Park Street is nothing less than a historical place to visit. It is the legacy of Flury's that makes it so special. It is the place which has an English feel to it right from the menu to the service and the ambiance. Flury's is not just famous for its bakery and confectionery items, it is also equally well known for its English breakfast which is simply awesome and a must try. There is a kind of serenity about this place... you will never find loud people here. One of the reasons why it is considered a posh eating joint. It is frequented by celebrities who come here for a quiet session of adda and also visited by corporates and foreigners. I love the pasta here and i am in love with their Spanish Omelette. In the pastries my favourite is the truffle cake, rum balls, lemon tarts and the list continues. The price is on the higher side but it is worth if you want to visit it to experience Flury's and its legacy.

Personal favorites include  Good old chocolate truffles, the Chicken mayonnaise sandwich, the delectable bacon sandwich and the Flury's coupe with a spanish omelette accompanied by a cup of special darjeeling tea can satisfy your platter any time of the day. . Prices though expensive, are definitely worth it..

There's been a lot of talk in the reviews section regarding the overpriced menu of Flury's. Well to start with, people who are looking for Flury's and cheap in the same sentence have the choice to let their attention waver to the outlets at South City Mall, Mani Square etc. etc. Price will be cheap, so will everything else. Flury's is not just another food joint. It's an experience. From the food to the ambience, the cutlery to the gracious etiquette of the waiters, from the wiff of smoked bacon to the sweet fragrant pineapple tart, Flury's is a forerunner among exquisite bakeries in Calcutta and I hope it continues to be so. As for the review. I have rarely looked beyond anything other than the Grilled Bacon Club Sandwich listed on the last page of their menu and needless to say I have found it deserving of the 5 star.

Located in Park Street crossing this bakery is one of the oldest in the city and this is personally one of my favorite. Be it chocolate truffle or lemon roll. I love all the pastries and the cookies. But for Christmas cakes they lag quality, I used be a fan of their fruit cakes, but in this particular section they seriously deteriorated and now I have settled for some other bakery, which is also one of my favorite! For English breakfast or for a tea Flury's is just awesome. Coming to ambiance, the heritage, the class, the decoration everything is just wonderful. The service quality was good but on a recent visit I found that it also has deteriorated . But still, a 4 out of 5 for me cause they deserve it!

This used to be a place where you could waste an entire morning looking out on the street with a pot of a delicious second flush of Darjeeling tea and if you were in the mood, you could ask for a side of fried bacon or fresh madelines. They have a pretty long list of items on their menu but I would usually stop reading after 'all day breakfast'. This mega meal came with sausages, eggs, bacon, ham, toast, hash browns and coffee served by the ever-smiling, Hassan Bhai. But I have had pretty dismal experiences in my recent visits. They have become very popular and they have snazzy interiors now. But the old charm has disappeared with the old staff and I wish it didnt have to be that way.

Ambience of this place is complete bliss.
The food, the service, the pastries, all makes Flury's 'The one'. One of the most renowned food parlour in Park Street. They even provide special menu for Durga Poojo. The bengali food over here is also delicious! I would highly recommend Flury's for those who are skeptical about it!

Much heard about the place - I finally get a chance to visit when I had  a short trip to Kolkata this year! I was in a rush and had very little time to take an Almond Cube which was absolutely decadent!

The outer crust with shaved and smoked yellow almonds and the inside comes with a little surprise of Mascarpone and Sweet Cream Cheese surprise!

I can't miss a full-fledged meal here when I come for the next time, breakfast especially since that is really special!

I didn't like pineapple cream as it was not that soft..... Asparagus roll was also a waste..... Limited options for vege lovers.... Attendants were very good n helpful.....

I do have a sweet tooth and I just love cakes and pastries. Thus, flury's being quite famous a confectionery, I paid a visit. Headed straight for a place to sit. I was immediately shoved off to the pastry counter as I was told that the table and chairs were not for people who orders only cakes or pastries. Well, I was quite disappointed at it. Anyways I took a chocolate pyramid and a brownie with chocolate sauce. It seemed to me that the person serving the cake was irritated to do the job and was under some compulsion. The food tasted great though I was unhappy with the behaviour of the staff.

In Kolkata, there are quite a few places that are living off old glory and Flury's tops that list. Fooled by good reviews and reccos from friends, stepped into Flury's a few years back. The food was stale, overpriced, the service was slow, the overall attitude of the people who run this 'iconic' place was- we don't care. 
Its alright to talk about stuff like 'childhood memories' , 'must-visit' blah-blah. But please, rate a place by the service and quality of the food it serves. The world has moved on. Places like Flury's have ceased to be special.

First visit. The food was ok, service quite slow, billing was erroneous, value for money was low and hence the overall impression was just ok.

Chicken and mushroom quiche was good, the panini sandwiches were just ok - the bacon one was not well done.

Choco milk shake and cold coffee was good.

Cappucino coffee was just ok, liked the serving set - cup and saucer.Restaurant looks good especially the cakes/bread counter area.Summary - Heard a lot but nothing to go back to. I would say Kookie Jar is way better than what Flury's offers.

I had heard so much about Flury's from relatives in Kolkata that it was on my must-visit list. Of course I had read the reviews too and some warned that the quality had deteriorated. So although I wasn't disappointed because my expectations weren't that high, it turned out to be less than mediocre.  We ordered for chicken mustard sandwich which came without fries and literally only with chicken and mustard between 2 slices of bread and nothing more than that. It was insipid. Other items were grilled vegetable panini and I've never seen a panini so small in size. It was also nothing to write about. Just 2 bites and it was over. The chocolate cake (this was decent) and the chocolate roll was dry and stale. The only saving grace if at all was the flury's tea which is served in the traditional English way. But not at all worth the price which is true for all dishes here. I would never go back here!

I used to visit Flury's as a child on our annual summer trips to Kolkata. The elegance and old world charm are missing in its glitzy and bright avatar. I tried the black forest gateau and was disappointed like never before. There was butter cream frosting over a chocolate sponge!! I didn't bother trying going there again. I prefer to keep my childhood memories intact. How the mighty have fallen!

Every time I visit Kolkata, I make it a point to head to Flurry's atleast once for break fast, so much love I have for this place. Since I haven't spent my childhood in Kolkata no nostalgic memories of this place. However, it goes without saying that this is one of the best places to dine out in Kolkata. Ambiance is lovely, love the chandelier there, English breakfast ten on ten, chicken croissants ten on ten, Baked bean on toast love the way they serve it ofcourse minus the onions and green chillies. Black coffee is awesome. Their pastries, rum balls are simply the best. I make it a point to get some rum balls packed on my flight back. Best part is if you get one of those tables near the window on a rainy day, just nothing better than it. Food and coffee becomes even more enjoyable and tasty in such a setting.

You Walk around Park Street full on restaurants and at one moment, the delicious pastries outside Flurry's catches your eyes. Being known for my sweet tooth, I entered this place to have my fill. Sadly, the pastries did not have much of an option, so I decided to have a Pasta. The service wasn't up to the mark even though I had heard a lot about this place. Maybe I was there at the wrong place at wrong time. Expecting a better service the next time I'm there. Hope, I won't be disappointed.

If you a gourmet person and love the more finer things in life, then Flurys, Kolkata is the place for you. We had croissants, cause I love em the way they make it. We ordered the English Breakfast, Joggers Breakfast and pastry. It was wow! The service, well sometimes there are wait times since the queue is huge some mornings, but that is okay. Since we were ordering two breakfast options, and the Joggers one had tea and juice and the English one had tea as add-on. Our server, suggested if you don't want the juice, I can get you two teas for em, no need for the addon. Impressive!! Be it breakfast or brunches or the awesome cakes and pastries this is one my favorites in Calcutta!!

Well the first thought /imagery that flashes across my mind as I speak FLURYS has to be that of standing in the long queue on a Christmas eve to grab my share of happiness …. It has been so since ages … and with that kind of in-built bias instilled in me I dropped by the newly undertaken and revamped FLURYS (ofcourse its been a while now) with high expectations . I really hate to say this but my dinner experience was almost horrible.we went there on a Saturday at around 8 ish when the entire park strret neighbourhood was bustling …. And there we were sitting in a almost empty flurys … where they did not have the Mediterranean prawn salad we ordered and came to inform us about it some 20 mins after we have placed the order ! the PRAWN THEMIDORE WITH HERBED RICE  tasted about average …..but then how can you enjoy your dinner with flies hovering around your table… yes seriously! You heard it ! I was nothing less than shocked ! so much so that a ordered some caffeine to gulp this down ! I am just not go to flurys nor recommend especially for dinner on saturday nights !

Visited Flury's after may be 10 long years and was ushered into a crowded place. It was around 6 PM in the evening and was packed to capacity. We ordered Chicken Mustard Sandwich,Chicken quiche and baked beans on toast for the vegetarians,followed by tea and coffee.

Service was quick and all items were served hot, they served baked beans the Indian way - it was actually served with accompaniments of onions and green chillies. This was very unique to me and i found all of them enjoying, though personally, i will never eat this way.

Overall a good experience - they have really priced all items quite high now.

I have heard a lot about the nostalgic value of Flurrys. Though I can't relate with it as I have not spent my childhood or college in Kolkata., but agree that pastries are good and better than other bakeries in Kolkata. I am yet to try the most famous puffs and English breakfast. The one thing that is not very comfortable is the pricing.One chicken sandwich cost me Rs 450 with taxes. Rest all is fine. The ambiance is good too.

In kolkata there is not many places where you would find bakery items unlike Bangalore. I feel it's the only place you actually get freshly baked authentic cakes and other items. Situated in the heart of the city it's taste is out of the blue and it's worth the money you spend, unlike monginis and Kathlene where the food ain't that fresh.

Flury's is the definition of authenticity. From the tea and coffee to the puffs and pastries, eveything tastes brilliant. 

I cannot comment about the english tea as I didn't have it. But the Flury's Mocha looked, smelled and tasted brilliant! It is not like the cafe mocha you get at Baristas and CCDs, it was black coffee with chocolate, it tasted perfect! 

The chicken puff tasted good. It had a lot of filling but didn't compliment the tea and coffee that well. The chicken and mushroom quiche, on the other hand, was amazing! I actually had 2 or 3 of them, it tasted that good!

Amongst the pastries, the lemon tart and rumball need no introduction. They are the best pastries I've had in a long time. The almond pretzel was also good. If you like pretzels it's a must try. 

The only downside is that their service is really slow.. The waiters do not pay much attention to the table. I had to speficifally ask the waiter each and evrytime for a glass of water. But I guess that's not that big an issue.

Overall I'd say this is a place you have to visit at least once if not more. I'd definitely visit Flury's again. :)

Ambiance : 5/5

Flury's is a legendary institution (and I use the word advisedly), which has fallen on bad days. But before I dissect their fall from grace, let me relive some fond memories. One's love affair with Flury's began with Sunday breakfasts in childhood. The fare either consisted of Grilled Cheese & Tomato Sandwiches or Baked beans on toast and the main attraction was always Stuffed Cheese & Mushroom Omelettes with a side of Pork Sausages (now the serve the lame chicken sausage), perfectly cooked Bacon and Hash browns. One can never forget bunking classes at St. Xavier's and going on a date and sipping endless cups of Viennese Coffee with Rum Balls and Patties. What I'm trying to say is Flury's always held a special place in the hearts of Calcuttans. 

The story changed after the management of Park Hotel took over Flury's. Things were still ooja-cum-spiff till Shaun Kenworthy was in-charge of the Menu. After he left the Park group, rot started setting in. Nowadays the Pastries they serve are mostly stale. Last time I ate a Chicken and Mushroom Quiche there it was full of cartilage instead of chicken morsels. Their choice of Breads and Assorted chocolates have also suffered.

Having said all that, I still go there - for an old style Chicken Patties, a Rum Ball or a Sacher Torte and a cup or two of Viennese Coffee. I dearly hope things improve and they live on to create more memories for newer generation of Calcuttans.

A part and parcel of the traditional park street food joints.. Surely needs no introduction.. The quality of the confectionery is really right up there with the best.. Personal favorites include the Chicken mayonnaise sandwich, the delectable bacon sandwich and the Flury's coupe. Prices though expensive, are definitely worth it..  An iconic place that shall always remain special.. :)

Breakfast at flurys is a classic experience and is much hyped such that some people include it on their itinerary when they visit Calcutta. I didn't feel it was anything extra ordinary. Coffee was nice and the omelette decent. I was disappointed with the bread for the most part. I expected more range and better quality. I have had better breakfast at many other places. They do make really good pastries and chocolates. I liked most of the things I tried.

Flurys is legendary. Everybody who has any Kolkata connection, has some nostalgic associations with Flurys.  I love the ‘cubes’ - huge cubes of creamy pastries with thick icing that smelt of pure butter. And also the patties - the flaky, crumbly, crispy crusts of pastry sheets disintegrating as one bit into them and the filling of meat (I loved the chicken) melting into the mouth. once you flip through the menu card, you will be surprised at how many of the dishes are marked with ‘H’… these are the heritage dishes. Sometimes the service fluctuates from being really slow and uncaring to really really attentive and super efficient, everything else remains the same. For example, today’s lunch… everything felt exceptionally good… the club sandwich, chicken wings, crispy fried prawns, chicken cordon bleu, spinach cannelli… and ofcourse the legendary rum balls.

Its sacrilege to go to park street and never make it to this food temple, especially if you are a bread person, with a sweet tooth. Well that's me, and Flury's never seems to disappoint me in the least. Their masala omlette, Mushroom on toast, lemon tarts, rum balls, cookies, swiss roll, Bread, everything is so finger licking good :D The breakfast deals here are awesome.. :D The original open swiss sandwich with extra ordered portion of scrambled egg and bacon being my favourite. They have a beautiful tea time spread too, and there's nothing like Flury's for some fun with your taste buds :)

This is one of the most legendary places in Kolkata at the heart of Park Street. I think above everything - the location of the place is unique, the layout of the place is unique and provides lot of privacy. One of the best places in Kolkata for breakfast meetings. The bakery stuff is really good. Coffee etc is also good. Service is good but as with most Kolkata joints - go with tempered expectations. If you ever travel to Kolkata -  this is one of the attractions to visit.

flury's is all about nostalgia and tradition. it's the most favorite food joint in park street and famous for its bakery items. however, people also flock here to savor the breakfast items, specially the english breakfast consisting of bacon and chicken sausages with a cup of darjeeling tea - a perfect way to start your sunday morning. another specialty is the sandwiches, i liked the chicken mustard sandwich most. also, another must have is the special omelette. the tea served is enough for 3 if you order 2 cups. they serve in traditional tea pot with milk and sugar separated which you can mix as per your liking. the ambiance is very classic and the staff here are friendly and well behaved. if you are looking for authentic english breakfast, then head over to flury's on a sunday morning and savor your taste buds with your friends/family members.

I was previously not fond of the spanking new interiors of what was once my favorite childhood haunt. I used to visit Flury's as a curious, aquarium obsessed 5 year old who harbored the desire to one day spear one of their delicious silver hued fish in order to pair it with a perfect fluffy omlette and a welcoming pot of tea.. but nevermind. Out with the old and in with the new!


The staff are very courteous, respectful, and are helpful which is a welcome change from last year when most of us refused to enter because of their unhelpful and arrogant attitudes.  I am especially fond of the gentleman who serves me my favorite Jogger's Breakfast every Tuesday. The Jogger's Breakfast, incidentally, consists of lean sausages, bacon (minus the not-too-healthy, but delicious rind), a yolk-free omlette, some fibre-rich multigrain toast, and a choice of fresh juice (which is "100% fresh" by the way, just saying). This is a good way to start the day on a slightly healthy note. 

They make a decent teatime spread, where you can sample their regular offering of patties and puffs, and for those who would like something more flavorful, a selection of quiche or "special" sandwiches. Among the many variants of sandwiches  on offer, I would personally recommend the following in order of frequency of consumption + general awesomeness - 

The Original Open Swiss Sandwich, which includes generous slices of ham, cheese, tomato, and chicken (shreds). 
Suggestion - Order a plate of bacon on the side to accentuate the meaty, cheese goodness of this sandwich!

Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato and Mayo toasted Sandwich - The classic BLT with a little mayo for some added flavor, although personally, I ask them to replace the mayo with cheese for some good o'l pig-meets-cheese flavor. 
Suggestion - Indulgence central occurs when you.. yes, you guessed it.. add more Bacon to the equation and top it off with a side or two of Hash Browns. 

Tuna on whole wheat bread (I prefer mine untoasted) with a lot of mustard, maybe some cheese (yes, bacon and cheese will remain firm favorites throughout this review). For those who want a really filling tea, try a Chilled Coffee Sprungli and end with a decadent rum ball.

I swear I used to love the rum balls at Kathleen's but Flury's wins the battle of the (rum) balls hands down in context with size, texture, and flavor. Priced at INR 50 presently, a single rum ball is difficult for one person to consume after a meal.. unless of course you are a bottomless pit. 


For purely liquid indulgence, they have a more than decent selection of teas on offer which include the usual suspects, i.e. Assam, Darjeeling, Lemon (hot as well as iced, the latter is better), and a couple of "Anytime tea" and "Cream tea" combo offers which include a cup of tea with cookies, and a cup of tea with scones and preserves or butter. Their "Afternoon tea" is more substantial, offering a sandwich and pastry along with a fruit tartlet to accompany the tea. In terms of coffee I only find their Sprungli to be exceptional, otherwise their expresso, iced coffee, and cold coffee are good but not over the top in any way. 

Their extensive lunch and dinner menus are yet to be sampled, so I hope to write a separate review on them after having sampled what is on offer. 

In the meantime however, if you are looking for a mid to large budget range spot for an early morning breakfast or a cuppa amid lush interiors (giant chandeliers at 7am are quite a sight), Flury's is the place for you.

Its remains to be one of my favorite places in kolkata. I had been there a few years back and tried the mushroom on toast and had been yearning for it since then. Finally i got a chance this time and it was as delicious as i remembered. Tried the omelet here as well but was a little bland for my taste. The pastries like lemon tart and rum balls are surely worth a try.

Must say..its a gr8 place to hang out wid ur frnds or family over breakfast or just having coffee. The ambience is jus perfect to start ur Saturday morning over a cup of coffee. Have tried their chicken croissant which is good. I m a coffee afficionado and i mus say i was impressed with their Belgian mocha with cream fill. I also liked the creamy mushrooms and garlic platter. The cakes and confectionery was what i had heard a lot about. So i tried almost 6-7 varieties of them including cheesecake,baba cake. But the best of them was the Rum ball. Do try it. Though i felt the other cakes were too much hyped for what they tasted. I am yet to try the English breakfast.. which is on the cards when i visit it next...

The Flurys legacy has stood the test of times and still offers the best quality confectionary in Kolkata. Special breakfasts coupled with really fresh brewed coffee variants are just wonderful. Good crowd as well as ambience. But food is a tad bit expensive. Otherwise a top place for cakes and other confectionary items.

Flury, Kolkata
Visiting Kolkata and not confectionarying is bizarre! Kolkata has since long been the capital of Swiss confectionary since the passing of the hands of Flury from its Swiss owners to the Surendra Paul group. In fact as the story goes Mr. Paul had taken over the entire Park Street establishment except the crowning glory – Flury, Park Street. How the owner kept on dodging the Paul’s acquisition overtures and finally handed the same over as a goodwill gesture with the condition that the confectionary standards would remain the same for eternity! Long story short……. It’s sacrilege to miss this iconic place when in Kolkata. 
Now, the adda crazy Kolkatiian have a habit of cribbing of the depleting standards every now and then just like blaming the centre for any mis-rule in governance! Just ignore these lackadaisical lucky blokes and get a taste of the pastries, Bread, Swiss Rolls, cakes and Rum Balls, cookies etc. Breakfast at Fluries for me since childhood has been a better option than the Tiffany kind!  My, wife and I have thrived on Heritage Baked beans on Toast with Flury’s Piece de resistance The Heritage Chicken & Bacon Omlette since the 80’s ending up the loaded morning meal with a lemon tart. If you have followed me in Zomato, you will, believe every word about this MUST HAVE breakfast before understanding the impossibility of Tiffany!!!  Picture of the Lemon tart is attached!!
This time we avoided The Loaded breakfast for want of trying out new eating joints in Kolkata during our fortnight here. My apologies to my followers – that way I can share more about the joints than I could with the breakfast.
The English Breakfast is Rs.540/- inclusive of the coffee/juice whilst the stupid joggers breakfast was tagged at Rs.520/-! Bloody losers, I say! The Heritage Baked Beans on Toast is priced at Rs.240/- per plate, Quiches at Rs.54/- per piece, Scrambled eggs at Rs.50/- per portion. The Heritage Chicken & Bacon Omlette is available at Rs.370/-  and guys, believe me it’s not the price but the experience!! I consider myself as a swell cook on the matter of eggs and omlettes/akuri, poached eggs etc but in spite of having made a 12 egg version of this Heritage original I was never near the real Mccoy. Wafer thin petite English Heritage Sandwich is available at Rs. 50/- per piece.  
We settled for pack aways of the Lemon Tart, Rum Ball and a pastry to save our frugal souls! Pictures attached!

Ambience – 10/10 (warm, spacious, Bright and clean and very Tiffany’s in touch)

Menu – 9/10 Excellent Confectionery  

Taste – 9/10 Swiiiiiiiisssssssss………………Sllllllluuuuuuuurrrrrrpp!! 

Customer Service – 7/10 Good 

Value for Money – 8/10 

Recommend –  Don’t ever miss the Breakfast for the bitch – Tiffany!!!

i have been here in flurys many times.. if i want 2 taste any cakes or backery products the only name that i will think of is flurys..i have tasted ,many cakes..such as pyramid slice.chocolate cake,vanilla cake,chocolate pista,rum bell these are very much tasty.if i want to say if anyone want to think of cakes and backery products then just flurys is my option..its pritty big and ya well fournished too.......KOLKATAS HERITAGE BREAKFAST AT FLURYS. ENGLISH BREAKFAST HAS ITS NOSTALGIC DEMAND TILL DATE. A LOOK ON PARK STREET THROUGH THE GLASSES FROM INSIDE FLURYS GIVES A FEELING OF BEING IN KOLKATA.a centrally located fav joint for people needing sumptuous breakfast. its a old and famous bakery of Kolkata. a very good joint to visit.Best Place to really feel Kolkata. Get the best classic breakfast with a view of busy street. A must try is the mushroom or beans on toast. And while going pick up the breads to warm your taste buds for next 3 days.Decent bakery in a very good location. But this place is a big boast but a small toast. Food is decent but not for the price you pay. 1 more issue is that its very difficult to buy bread from this bakery, maybe they cannot make much from selling bread and want to discourage people entering the bakery with an intent of buying bread. The ambiance is good and one should give a visit if you are around park street for coffee/snacks. This bakery is mentioned in a lot of travel blogs and related books for Kolkata less

I had higher expectations for confectionaries' from Flurys. The main reason I was attracted to this place was the prime location of the outlet and the "since 1927" board. Park street has lots of similarities with Colaba in Bombay. Like Leopold I was expecting some delicious deserts from here apart from their breakfast menu. The blueberry cheesecake wasn't a delight for my taste buds. I had also tried one chicken quiche, which was also not up to the mark.

I am still waiting to experience their breakfast menu.

Happens to be one of the vintage cake shops in the city. Almost every celebrity has been here, from Tollywood, Bollywood and a few from Hollywood as well.
The moment you step into this cake shop you feel yourself moving into an old British era cake shop, in the heart of the city. The feeling remains the same till the moment you leave the place. Even the ceiling fans must be dating back to the early 50s.
This place offers you a very homely ambience apart from its food. You can sit with a cup of Mocha for hours and browse through the web or the newspaper, or better take your office work even. 
The place is even more popular for its breakfast. You can have anything simple like poached eggs and choose from a selection of assorted breads, to roast turkey during Christmas.
On a regular basis I really won't be recommending this place because of its exorbitant price.
The antique beauty of the place is something that draws most of the customers. Even in the evening if you find this place a little less crowded try taking a few snaps, because the indoor lighting is really good. And if you're visiting this place after a hard day's work just sit and sip into the Hot chocolate coffee.

Even with its old age Anglo indian charm, Flurys has always fallen a little short of the expected in my eyes. 

One time I stepped in for evening tea with a friend and 3 of the things we requested from the menu were not available. 

The breakfast wasn't bad but as is the case with the Confectionary section I found it over priced.

We went there today evening, after a long time to get a taste of old school dishes in Kolkata’s oldest tearoom, Flurys. It normally offers an experience – right from the chandeliers and the designer cakes on display to its menu of exotic beverages, sandwiches and desserts. The dessert counter boasts of a wide variety of cakes, Swiss chocolates and other confectioneries. Ours all-time favourites include the Flurys open sandwiches, stuffed croissants, baked Cannelloni, honey-mustard chicken. After committing five generations of fine confection to Kolkata, the city’s oldest teahouse needs no introduction. It still wears the pre independence look with antique furniture and well-dressed waiters, reminiscent of the days of the British Raj. Tearooms conjure up images of cigars, butlers, men with magnificent moustaches, wine coloured decor with a fireplace, and of course tea and scones. Alas, I was cursing myself that I should not give this visit. So that charm of old Flurys will remain in my mind. I normally used to order their open sandwiches with cola punch but today I went for ‘The Three Layer, Flurys Club Sandwich’ (Chicken, Ham & Egg) along with ‘Iced Coffee with Cream’ & ‘Belgium Mocha Coffee’. Service was horrible; waiters don’t even care for any manners. They were talking with each other & laughing while taking orders. I have to say three times to make him listen what I need. Triple Layer Flurys Club Sandwich was really good, very much filling and tasty but I was missing the mouth-watering heavenly feelings. Iced Coffee with Cream & Belgium Mocha Coffee were not at all up to the mark. If you are charging this much, you should concentrate on the quantity and quality. Flury’s cup or glass will not make up for the taste, quality & quantity. I definitely don’t enjoy this visit.

Flury's was one restaurant that was recommended to me the most along with peter cat by my friends so  this was the first place I decided to visit today on my first Saturday in Calcutta. I initially thought I would go there for breakfast but a late Friday night made sure that I was running behind schedule by 11 hours and I finally landed at Park St. at 6:30 PM :-) Luckily for me, I got off the cab right opposite to Flury's and I wasted no time in walking into possibly the most famous English Breakfast place in Calcutta. Must say, I was pleasantly surprised by the place. Totally loved the ambiance of the place, there is something about the yellow lights that adds to the charm of the place. The staff is extremely friendly as well which is an added advantage. I ordered a Heritage- Toasted Chicken Mustard Sandwich, a Heritage- Flury's Vienesse coffee and a pineapple cube for my sweet tooth :P. I simply loved the chicken sandwich and the famous Vienesse coffee of theirs. Pineapple cube on the other hand looked really tempting but didn't satisfy my taste buds. 
Overall, I must say, I loved the place and would definitely be visiting it again, hopefully this time a little early so that I can actually enjoy their English Breakfast.

Everytime I go through park Street Flurys attracts like a magnet,mainly by its historical glamour. I absolutely love pastry and ice cream items. The peach melba and double chocolate sundae was the items I tasted first time and it was quite delightful. But I must say quite a bit overpriced also.because you can get more variety of items from gelato and other places. But still it was worth a experience remembering.

Flurys is situated on iconic Park Street in Kolkata and is an icon itself .Best known for Swiss chocolates. My favourites includes Rumballs , English wafer thin sandwiches ,tea and cream coffee , bean on toast.

 It is slightly expensive. You can eat there or shop. 

A visit to Flurys is must every Christmas. They prepare wonderful Easter eggs and bunnies.

Heritage is all that comes to mind when I cross flurys! I have been taken here for breakfast quiet a number of times as a kid and I immensely enjoyed it. But now the food in flurys is certainly not like before but not bad either... Their bakery has gone down a little but their breakfast items are still good! Flurys amongst everything has still maintained it's class!

One of the most significant contributions towards me becoming a foodie is my dad's. Every time he travels( which is quite often), he remembers to bring a food-gift or a souvenir of sorts for me and its these mementos that have helped build my own ideas and know more about all those distant places daddy works at. 
This time, like many times before, it was the most popular bong city- Kolkata.
I'd heard so much about Flury's from him and a few of my bong friends, that this time i had to ask him to bring me something to sample from there.
Having a very good acquaintance with my sweet jaw, daddy decided to bring his (now not so litle girl :P) some chocolate balls.

I have to say this-the sole reason behind me writing a review of a place i wish to visit are these out-of-the-world chocolate balls, in fact they're the best i've had in a very long time.
Yeah yeah, pretty ordinary a dish, but Flury's managed to make it so grand that i happened to visit the rest of their menu and now i know why is it featured in Legendary, Sweeth Tooth and Breakfast collections all three!! 

My rating of this place is only on the basis of these amazing chocolate balls-packed in this simple yet elegant pink colored box, king sized, moist, filled with the goodness of walnuts and resins and topped with chocolate too.
Since they were flown in all the way from their counter to my plate, their presentation can be pardoned.
Still, in a pretty good shape and a really great taste- these are a must have if you're in or going to Kolkata. 
I wish to sample many more delicacies from their menu and write about them too. 
"Five Generations of fine Confection" says the opening lid on the box, and trust me when i say this, the contents (which i devoured with closed eyes and immense satisfaction) leave one with absolutely no doubts regarding their expertise!

I was stunned at the behaviour yesterday of the wait staff at Flury's.  The waiters were extremely rude to my mother and me. The wait staff used incredibly loud and foul language in our vicinity. What should have been a nice leisurely visit turned into us rushing through our meal and leaving disappointed.

Sumptuous. 
I went back to Kolkata after about two years. And when my lovely sister invited me to Flury's, and although I had already made prior plans with others for a lunch, I did not even blink when I agreed.

What can I say? After gorging down delicious delicacies(Ice creams blends I did not know existed), we were chirping among ourselves about the heat, and other things, which led us to talk about watermelons. Just as we started talking about how we loved freshly made watermelon juice, one of the waiters overheard us and offered to bring us watermelon juice, even though it wasn't in the menu! THAT, I suppose, was the home run for me. Very, very satisfying. Finally!

Every person from Kolkata reveres this place as a must visit. However, I've been there multiple times, mostly forced to accompany friends who wanted to visit this place as they have heard a lot about it.
Firstly, the food is decent. Probably a 4. It is well cooked and presented. But nothing exceptional.
Secondly it has vintage value associated with it. However service is poor and takes ages to arrive. The waiters tend to get your orders mixed up as well in case of a large group.
Go here just to tick a landmark off your list. If you're hungry and craving good food or dessert, there are better options on park street.

Just try their Chicken cheese sandwich with a cup of Darjeeling Tea or go for any sundae ( vanilla+chocolate).. You will be loving it and wont never be able to resist urself from visiting the place again :-)
pocket pinch is bit high but food and ambience is really up to the mark! But try to avoid Flury's during christmas eve. The place becomes so noisy... not enjoyable :-(

Though the decor was new, the staff, the partrons and the vibe of the place seemed to exude memories. Good food, nothing fancy, tempting bakery and pleasant staff. I guess I could have missed it and not missed anything great but I'm glad I didn't.

A heritage place that everyone coming to Kolkata should definately visit but its ok for once in a while visit but if u wanna have a regular breakfast outlet, then Flurry's not your place. Very highly priced, the complete pricing is for the heritage value. Food is decent, the sausages, the onion rings, sandwiches, cold coffee all are good but nothing to justify the price tag. 
Staff and service is good. Sitting there gives you the kind of feeling of sitting in a historic restaurant which has seen many a summer.  Breakfast/Evening Coffee is good but for Dinner/Lunch, not my recommendation
Suggestion: Definately worth a try once, just for the experience.

Flurys Park Street is exactly as it is categorized: Legendary. It is a posh place no doubt, overpriced but it crowds never the less. The food tastes good, but it is more of a 1 or 2 time experience place. Not exactly where you will go back regularly. It is our heritage and would deserve more stars if they could have kept the price a tad lesser.

All my rating goes to food and bit to ambience....it could have been better if the price tag could have matched the outlet...just heritage tag dont entitled to harge exhorbitant....Calcutta bhodro loks please stop idolizing if its just heritage even though service is pathetic...
 Few pointers which has pulled down all my n comrades enthusiam -
1. Person taking the order isnt aware of all items in menu...to my surprise cant pronounce it properly..
2. Served two bottle of M water...one of which wasnt..I can clearly figure its normal filter water..I wasnt expecting any acknowledment of them still pointed one the person wandering around and he said the botle tasted so coz it was in room temperature:"voila its kolkata"...and he siad he never tasted the water brand so cant differentiate...
3. Ordered for a pie..requested them to cut them into 4 and bluntly said no...
4. Many of the items in menu not available.
 If you guys were in another ciy like bombay may have vanished long back....Professionalism or customer service is nowhere...And just the price tag dont put you in elite brand....Heard that renowned personalities visit the place not sure attitude/service toward them is same or not (these still exists in bengal which is hampering its image as place to live)...Really disappointing, thought flury's will not depict bengals last 30 years diaspora...

The place smells of pride. Makes you realize that money can buy happiness! Just try the omelette. Serving classy food since 1927! 
I had the Coffe Sprungli. It was thicker than a normal cold coffee and felt like drinking a classy blend of icecream and coffe. Recommended if you like a thick drink. The mushroom patty was very ordinary with loads of not-so-tasty stuffying other than mushroom. Anyway, this place has a legacy in Kolkata. Pay your tribute as you talk a walk around Park Street.

For those with a huge apetite there is the English breakfast. The bakery also has good stuff. Its a busy place on Park Street. They also serve lunch and dinner. FOod is great. Service is great. The prices are a little on the higher side. But its worth it.

I have been a great fan of Flurys for a long time now! after all it is one of the heritage attractions of kolkata! A breakfast at Flurys is a must for anyone who visits or stays in this city! and their english breakfast or the creamy chicken and mushroom on toast is just pure heaven!  that is my staple order there! 

However my recent visit to flurys was not so memorable. I had very gladly recommended flurys for breakfast to my colleagues after we finished doing night shift for a hearty breakfast, but upon reaching flurys the service was nothing less than awful! We had waited 45 mins or more and asked for our food more than 4 times to which we only got the same reply that its on the way,  just to be sent away by the manager in the end stating that the kitchen has collapsed! I cant believe that a restaurant which was packed to capacity on a sunday morning can have a kitchen which collapsed and couldnt serve food to all the guests waiting outside! however it seemed that we were the only ones who were told after 45 mins of waiting hungrily that we wont be served food as the kitchen has collapsed and it would take 30mins more to function so we can leave for someother place for breakfast! My colleagues who were new to kolkata and heard so much about flurys were appalled by this type of a service as we are all from the hospitality backgroud and the thumb rule of our profession is maximum guest service with promptness and excellence. no doubt their first experience of flurys was very bitter making us take an oath that flurys will not be a place to go for breakfast anymore!!!! even a small roadside cafe has better service in comparison to Flurys now. I guess with the changing times, the great heritage breakfast at flurys is also gone with the wind!

To Sum up our experience:- VERY VERY VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!!

The legendary Bakery at the most famous street of Kolkata Flury’s speaks of class and substance. With so much history attached to it, generations in Kolkata talk about it with love and affection. 

The huge glass windows and Pink board is what you associate it with. It looks very classy and English from inside (Flury’s has received many style awards). 

Many members in their staff are working there for years and they are very friendly. My favorite in the staff is my friend George. He once saw me struggling to hold two pastries and naturally I dropped one. Without saying anything he replaced the pastry for me. Since then I always say Hi to him (even if I am visiting some other place at Park street)

They have a huge menu consisting of continental food besides pastries, cookies and chocolates. 

One must try their English breakfast. It’s got everything from Sausages to Bacon to eggs and grilled tomatoes. It’s served with juice, tea or coffee. 

But a must have is there Non-veg Club Sandwich. I have not had a club sandwich as perfectly made as it is at Flury’s. You will dream about this sandwich years later. You can ask them to omit Ham (if you don’t like it). They make it using the classic technique of roasting the bread and filling it with lettuce, mayonnaise, ham, tomato and Chicken. Their pastries are regular and their chocolates are really good. 

One must go to Flury’s to witness the heritage of Kolkata.

The legendary cafeteria in Park Street is frequently visited by the foreigners for its very much "english" statement. Price is very reasonable considering the quality they offer,,(trust me..the fancy coffees in CCD, Barista doesnt stand a chance against its Earl Grey). A plain chicken patty offers such treat to the tastebuds that any foodie will love the place in the 1st time only. One hitch..quantity is on the lesser side. Also recently the standard dropped a bit. U may walk in there for a romantic date as it offers a lovely ambience but would not recommend for a family dinner.

Some pics of my recent visit is attached as my older review was devoid of any pics of this fantastic place.

We went to Flury's after a fantastic lunch at Bar-B-Q. And it was extremely disappointing to have such a bad experience at a good place like Flury's. First of all, after entering the place, we went to a table and were about to sit when the manager comes and asks us what we wanted to eat, we told that we were in search of some dessert, so he forbade us from sitting and instead, asked us to give the order at the bakery counter. We went to the bakery and placed our order and went to a table to sit, as soon as we pulled the chair, the guy comes running and stops us from sitting. We were like, what's wrong with him. He said that bakery items are meant to be "take away products" so we couldn't sit on tables. He then asked us to go to a dark remote corner of the restaurant with some small chairs and sit there. Now, more than 70% of the tables were vacant at that time, they had absolutely no shortage of tables, then what was the problem in letting us sit at the table? I don't think the manager would be punished and charged for letting the customers use the table. Coming to the food, the chocolate roll was super dry. It transformed itself into powder form as soon as i poked it with my spoon. the cream was so less that it felt like eating raw sweet bread. Ambience was the only thing that was good. Service was awful. Value for money was ok.

Ambience: 3.5/5
Service: 0.5/5
Value for money: 2.5/5
Taste: 2.5/5

Well, this is another much hyped place in Kolkata for breakfast. This place has history, but nothing a true food lover to die for.

We went there in a Sunday Morning with our kid (1 year) around 8am for breakfast. I ordered an western breakfast buffet, and my wife  some chicken sandwich. 

Western breakfast came with just toast, omlet, and few chicken peices.  Also, a potato fry and Smashed tomato to go with. Also, they served water melon juice. Overall, the taste was  just OK, but the quantity was pretty less compared to the price being put up. 

My wife liked her sandwich, but it was not hugely over-helming.  This is more like a meeting place in popular Part Street area.

Not for food lover, rather a chit-chat place !

This place is history, that one place which is like trademark kolkata. All of my friends across the country associates kolkata with flury's. My mom never forgets to bring back 'chicken patties' if she's anywhere close to this place. My grandfather has always loved this place and I see the spark in his eyes when he shares all the history of this place, the various changes and how this joint is iconic to park street and the city of joy!!!!
Now coming to two recent experiences:
The service has gone sour, seriously gone down, the waiters aren't aware of the menu and what's available and what not. 
The chicken patties was heated a tad too much giving it a bit burnt taste: I felt bad, really, seriously a Sunday spoiler...
Omelette: requested to cook a bit gooey inside but again it was not done.
The chicken sandwich: that's available all day for take away, was awesome as usual
Tea: Awesome!!!
Manager: was initially not taking any responsibility, but after argument did agreed and finally didn't charged for the omelettes. But it actually ruined the Sunday morning.
Pocket Pinch: medium 

Overall: Flury's has changed a lot especially in the recent few years in the sit downs otherwise all the take away confections are superb as usual. I can never forget the baba cake and tea. Thank you flury's for the wonderful memories but seriously buckle up in staff attitude and  service.

This place screams grandeur , charm, and you feel a sense of royalty walking in here. Truly, you feel a part of something huge and which is why I chose Flury's  for some sweet treats and some coffee on my b'day ! 
 The decor, needless to say is fantastic, massive space with posh upholstery and warm lighting. I love the black and white pictures depicting its journey through the years on the wall towards the end. Located centrally, this place gives you a taste of the hustle bustle at park street through it's long french windows. 
 FOOD :=
We ordered lots of "sweet treats" :P 
1. Chocolate Truffle Pastries - Simply rich, gooey, chocolate heaven. and my friends got me a chocolate truffle cake too ! One of the best cakes I have had in kolkata , truly :) 
2.  Lemon Tart- simple, tangy, with the perfect crust and I loved the touch of chocolate work on the tart :)
3.   French vanilla donut shaped pastry thing. (I forgot the name :P ) - This was something unique. We thought it was a cronut or something ( cross between a doughnut and a croissant) because it looked like it but it was something else. Nonetheless, it had this vanilla cream filling and a sweet pastry which was amazing. 
4. Chocolate pot - This was another interesting thing I spotted there. It was a tiny glass jar filled with layers of well chocolate dessert, topped off with chocolate chips. I got it for my mom and she simply loved it ! The jar is pretty damn cute too :D
5. Coffee - We ordered cappuccino's and it was really good. Nothing outstanding though.
 The staff was courteous, polite, they even offered click pictures of us and even provided a separate chair for my balloon ( long story :P ) 
This place is really good for having some coffee, and some pastries as they do make some of the best in town :) 
Most of all, as I was sitting in the comfortable chair in one of the most iconic places in Kolkata , I was happy because it was a perfect ending to my birthday.

Such a legendary place with so much history. This place still has an old world charm. The cakes are the best here and my personal favorite is the rum ball here. The sandwiches are really good here and so are the omlettes. Every one who wants to experience a bit of the victorian era has to go experience this place.

Nothing much to say about this place as the name itself is the biggest qualifier for this eatery. Most of the calcuttans know this place more as a confectionary but Flurys' s serves awesome main course dishes as well. My personal favourites are english breakfast, spaghetti, pasta, etc. From the confectionary part I like the cheese cake, probabaly the best one I have had in the city, paties and definitely the Rich Plum Cake ( Only during the christmas season).

As usual a brilliant experience, when you go this restaurant you expect and get nothing but the best. The English breakfast is possibly one of the best breakfasts you will ever have! The pastry counter is something I look forward to for each visit, as they change it every time. While not my favorite restaurant, definitely one to visit when you have a walletfull.

I sparsely visited Flury's when I lived in Calcutta. But now, after 9 years away from the city, it has become quite a ritual that I ought to visit this place whenever I am home. Because I miss it. 
I miss the fluffy croissants and the sandwiches. They are the most authentic ones one might find in the city. You night want to try the quiches as well, along with a freshly brewed cup of Flury's special tea!

Flury's is the most important part of Calcuttas history(not just food history) .Started in 1920s this particular outlet spoke of a different charm and calcuttuns would feel proud by just the mention of this place.The park street flurys is huge accomodating many. The glass windows gives you a peek into the mesmerising beauty that is flurys.
The breakfast here is very good,many a times have visited this place for just breakfast.Yes, calcutta now boasts of many breakfast joints,all day breakfasts and even brunch themed restaurants,but flurys stands out!Those hashbrowns,crossiants,eggs, i can go on :)
Also the bakery boasts of many favourites like the pyramid,cream rolls,blackforests, and whats christmas without a beautiful fruit rum cake from here( also another cake from nahoums:) )
Flurys has opened many other outlets and also displays in malls like city center2,where i had tried a pastry which was stale.Yes i was disappointed,very,but il ignore that, because its the park street outlet that woos me away always.

Everyone is well acquainted with flury's pastries and their vast dessert range.
I had lunch today for the first time there.
We ordered crispy honey chilli prawns as starters and grilled fish from the entrée selection.
The prawns were a little too deep fried and had the stench of oil.
The grilled fish served with fries and sautéed veggies however was served piping hot and was extremely delicious .
The food was accompanied with fresh lime soda an we finished the meal with ice cream (mango).
Given the chance I would probably visit again to try something else off their menu but I will admit that the food does not live up to one's expectations mostly due to the hype surrounding the place.

On a Sunday morning if you are feeling to have something special for breakfast this is the place to be....I usually go there for breakfast and after standing in a queue of thirty got a table...this place completely reeks of class ....I ordered chicken and mustard sandwich and my friends they ordered chicken and cheese sandwiches , I went for a Viennese coffee which is completely made with cream and has a dollop of cream on the top which again slowly melts into it and gives a taste which u might have never had before...the bread so soft and that mustard inside together is  best sandwich you can get in Kolkata .....the food is of the highest quality...I also couldn't resist myself from ordering their chicken corn soup which is my favorite.... And for desert lemon tart....I also tasted a bit of hot chocolate bt I'm not much of a hot chocolate lover.......next time I'm planning to order their English breakfast which has fried eggs, bacon ,sausage's all of my favorite stuff....this place is quite costly as a breakfast for two can set you back by 1200 bucks....but as always good things come at a price....

Over rated is what Flury's is. Flury's enjoyed a lot of fame and pride as one of the most sophisticated and elegant cafe/deli at a time when Kolkata had none others to give it tough competition. But now, there are numerous cafes which are much better than Flury's. My review might give off the impression of me having something against Flury's, but its not that. I do not really like to give undue credit to anything or anyone. The cakes of Flury's are quite ordinary and the snacky finger food that they have does not appeal to me at all. Also I have had breakfast in Flury's and the spread was nothing extra ordinary. I would not like to pay over 1 and a half grands for toast, tea and a little strip of bacon. Flury's is a good place to go if you are in the mood of splurging. But if you really want to have some tasty and delicious pastries and other stuff that Flury's offers, there are several other options.

I along with one of my buddy, felt like having some afternoon snacks and bumped into Flurys. I came here before and as an avid pastry lover, I look for having a Rumball or two for sure. We ordered two cheese sandwiches, two iced coffee and couple of Rumballs. There were flies everywhere and they were as stubborn as far their reputation goes! Why on earth there will be so much flies that someone has to peek-a-boo with the dishes, in a place damn upright price wise? [let's not deny it]

We informed one of the waiters about the problem and of course what he can do about it !?
The food we had was good and I suppose we ordered nothing extravagant to be critical. The toast was crispy, the coffee was right and the Rumballs were magnificent like always with occasional peek-a-boo,  of course !

Later I went to the confectionery section to get some Rumballs for the family. It was labelled Rs 52 per piece and when I ordered 3, it came up with Rs 180 instead of Rs 156 for tax. I've already paid the taxes while having the snacks. now they are charging again for the take home too. I've nothing against taxes but I seriously think Flurys should add the taxes first with the MRP and then label everything before they sell anything. Otherwise it feels like we are paying Rs 60 for a Rs 52 product.

I feel badly pissed off and I do think the management, service sector and public relations [ if they manage to have some] should think about their overall selling strategy.....weak: hygienewise, overpriced and welcomes only certain kind of people....that's what I find about Flurys.

Though it's more of a place for breakfast , the lunch and dinner are great as well. Please please please try the mushroom on toast in the breakfast menu and the chocolate croissant!! Also, the fresh fruit juices are enough to rejuvenate you for the day ahead. Lunch and dinner as such are fine. Coming to the confectionary, please try the pastries( the strawberry, the banana and the rum ball). You know what? Try all the pastries because they're the best in the city alongwith kookie jar. It's a frequent hangout place and I know that you will love it

Today just thought of writing a different kinda review of this eatery. We are well familiar with the cakes available here and its outstanding taste, so let's not repeat he same stuff all over again. I am going to put forward a different side of Flury's that few have mentioned till now - it is their continental dishes which are these days available in several outlets all over the city like in Epicuisine (Spencer's Hyper). I generally get these dishes from Epicuisine, Axis Mall Spencer's which is near my residence. Many are skeptical about such packed dishes, but I am generally open to try all these, and thanks to that trait I discovered these dishes which many would rather not try from Epicuisine. Out of the dishes I have tried here, the baked fish with herb rice was really terrific and deserves special mention though I should suggest packing should improve since the herb rice was slipping through the package. The other dish which I tried out here was grilled chicken with mashed potato, the grilled chicken came along with broccoli, beans, carrot, green peas, etc and the grilled chicken itself really tasted good, but the mashed potato was not that well prepared, it was very dry and some inferior quality potato was used to prepare the stuff which was having some unpleasant odor, something totally unexpected from Flury's. Hope this will be rectified. The overall rating of 3.5/5 given here is based on my overall experience at Flury's over all these years and NOT based on my tryst with Flury's dishes at Epicuisine, had that been the case the rating would have been something below or close to 3!

Been there for their brunch. A good, olad and famous place. If you are in Kolkata you would need to tick this place. Known for its confectionary and bakery items it sure is one more of the best. The service can be much better and warm for a place that servers sweet. I love their pasta which is creamy and perhaps one of the best pastas I have tasted in this part of the country.

Visited Flury's for lunch on a hot Sunday afternoon. We tried the vegetable club sandwich and the grilled chicken steak. I suppose there wasn't much one could do to mess up the sandwich so that turned out ok. The chicken steak was quite nice, especially with the crushed tomatoes and grilled vegetables! Rounded off the meal with coffee and pastries to complete the quintessential Flury's experience.

A little too overhyped and overpriced, Flurys still makes Calcuttans like us go weak in the knees, but thats more because of nostalgia than food based parameters. The ambience is absolutely brilliant; English and classy to the core. The teas and desserts (esp the almond ring and lemon tart) that they serve are delectable. Worth a visit. Try the English breakfast if you're visiting the city, else there are better breakfast options for Calcuttans.

Flurys is one of Cals institutions. You may get better pastries at Kookie Jar but the overall experience of Flurys is the flavour of Cal and Park Street.Having survived the spate of closures Flurys continues to serve delecious stuff. The Rumballs,and assortment of chocolate pastries especially are good and have been so for the past 4 decades that I have haunted it !!!The patties are tasty particularily the mini chicken ones.
Go for breakfast or visit it after a day at the races--order a fluffy Spanish Omlette,with hot buttered toast and yes try the Viennese coffee. If you are a chaiwala they have fresh Assams from their own estates too. The cold shakes and coffee with ice cream are sumptuous and true to taste.
Come XMAS and the Plum pudding,Xmas Cakes,mints,cheese straws still have the good old taste.
Its not a place for a quick meal---R E L A X and savour the coffee and cakes and watch the world go by on park street. Hard core Calcuttans ofcourse still patronise the place BUT it should be on your itenerary if you are a casual visitor to cal. Take a Window seat too >

"Review of Flury's" would be a wrong phrase to use. Firstly, it is an institution and defies review. Secondly, the opinions keep changing from time to time. So let us just say that these are "my views on Flury's" based on my latest visit 5 days back.

Yes, it was for breakfast and with the summer acting up, stepping in to the place itself seemed like stepping into heaven. There is something about the waiters that always suggests that they recall you as a valuable patron and were counting days when you would step in again - a gentle ego massage though I doubt that they have any reason for remembering me :) . 

Settling down, ordered for the English Breakfast with all the works and a cup of Darjeeling to wash it down. The waiter continuing in the same vein served up the day's newspaper - another fine touch of personal service. 

Just as I was turning to the Sports pages, the breakfast arrived and for a mind as gluttonous as mine, wasting one more second on the Indian team's exploits against Pakistan was nigh impossible. It was all there - golden brown toasts, fried eggs smiling, sausages, bacon rashers, hash browns and the condiments. I have never been a fan of the grilled tomato and promptly discarded the same on to the side plate. Doing that, started the delicate task of picking an choosing the next forkful from the delicacies at my disposal. There is a particular balance to it that comes with practice  - a bite of the toast and then some sausage followed by the hash brown, back to the toast and top it with the fried egg and and then a bite of the bacon and then you start all over again. The tastes melt and mix in your mouth and leave you with a feeling of ecstasy (the legal kind). Good things of course come to an end before they are supposed to and soon the plates were being cleared and I was sipping on the Darjeeling and reading about MSD's team selection for the T20 world cup finals. 

Then comes the part that I do not like at Flury's - the bill which always tends to be bit of a bomb. The waiters of course wait and wait patiently and never rush it on you. They allow you enough time to completely enjoy the food and beverage then some more time to attain the nirvana like stage that is a necessary after effect of a good breakfast and finally when you have steeled yourself enough and waved at them, they will bring in the piece of paper in a most matter of fact way. You whip out your credit card in an equally matter of fact way, anxious not to betray your internal rumblings to the patrons seated on nearby tables. Once the payment is done (in this case it was around Rs.650/-) however you come to terms with it pretty quickly. You understand how important it is to spoil yourself once in a while and the glow in your heart creeps back. As you are stepping out on Park Street, you are thinking of, and only of, the delightful gastronomical adventure you have just had had. 

With a breakfast at Flury's your day cant go too wrong. 

PS - Rating would be 5 otherwise but just for the Value For Money bit, 4.5 would be okay I suppose.

Another weekday morning visit, waiting for my daughter to finish her first day at school.

Ordered a non-veg club sandwich. I found it to be rather clumsy and unwieldy to eat. They should perhaps cut it into four pieces. It also had too much of tomato and cucumber. The ham seemed better than my last visit. There was a picked gherkin that was very overpowering and killed of every other flavour. The pineapple was dry and not up to the mark. Very filling though, would say.

The Viennese coffee was nice but I wish it wad like the one that used to be served at the erstwhile T3. The serving was tiny.... Just a shot of espresso and cream. It tends to get cold and finishes off too quick. Maybe that is how it should be, but then again, why?

The prices have gone up since my last visit. A shame. Cannot justify the rates. The chef did mention they were reworking the menu and would come up with lower prices soon.

Let's hope for the best.

It has been my long standing wish to visit Flury's, which came true two days before last year's Christmas. It was beautifully decorated with a Christmas tree and beautiful ceiling hangings. We were seated comfortably and there was a huge crowd following in the cake & pastry section. 

My friend wanted to have some pastry and I ordered the Chicken Mayonnaise Sandwich and a Cold Coffee. The service was quite timid and my friend was struggling to get the attention at the pastry section. She came after a good 30 mins, but after getting herself a Black Forest Pastry, a Pineapple Pastry and a Brownie. Everything looked superb. 

Now we shared everything we got ourselves. The Chicken Mayonnaise Sandwich was at its best. It was absolutely lip smacking and the chicken mayo filling was a cracker. The Black Forest was nice too, just the way it should be. But for me the Pineapple Pastry was the winner, it was so refreshing and so tasty. In fact within a very short time the pineapple pastry has emulated the chocolate one as my favorite. However the Brownie was a bit dry and didn't appeal to us much. The experience was memorable, one I would cherish for a long time.

Flury's is located bang on Park Street where all the happening people seem to throng. The place is probably the most talked about eatery in Kolkata with references in Bollywood movies like Parineeta etc

I went to the place in MArch 2014 courtesy a friend who kidnapped me and took me there - all because I was a reluctant to go out in the Kolktata sun. We reached the place at 10:30 and to my surprise the place was full and we had to wait our turn.

Once inside, the ambiance has a sense of a bustling modern cafe and the chitter chatter of a full house. The menu has a host of breakfast items - sandwiches, croissants, eggs et al. I ordered the English break fast which was very well presented with 2 fried eggs, 2 hash browns, 2 sausages, 2 pieces of bacon, roast tomato and toast. The food was nice and fresh. the staff is nice and courteous. In general, people tend to come out happy from this restaurant.

The biggest plus about the place is the ambiance. It is lively and young and the place is frequented by tourists from abroad. 

Overall, I really liked the place. I will try to go there again if i happen to be in Kolkata

Heritage , culture and tradition are three things that one will definitely hear and read whilst mentioning or researching Flurys!

However, these alone are sometimes not always sufficient when searching out for an ideal dining experience!

I have been to Flurys many times in my childhood and while I certainly admit that its a great place to chill and hang out and have some super pastries, I am pretty convinced that the Breakfast experience is highly overrated ! I took my parents there and ordered the Full English spread and many other dishes. But I must express my utter disappointment in stating that the taste is far removed from reality! I have stayed 2 years in the UK and the full English breakfast whether in England or Scotland or Wales, is unparalleled. The  hash browns are to be savoured to be believed and alas Flurys did not provide me with a similar experience!

All the food is bland and resonantly tasteless and really the price is unbelievably high!

Go there for the culture trip bit, but to expect to be entirely satisfied with the food, is to believe in a lie!

Flury's is definetly a heritage of Kolkata and for a long time it used to be the only restaurant apart from T3 (which closed down a couple of years ago) to serve all - english breakfast.

Located in park street, the restaurant is large and very comfortable. The decor is very elegant and the huge glass panes add to it. The waiters are well mannered but with an attitude. The prices are pretty high and i dont find that premium justified, so what if it is owned by the Apeejay Group !!! 

Coming to the food, i have frequented the place, but only for breakfasts for in-house dinings otherwise to take away their confectionery offerings, so cannot comment on their lunch/ dinner main course items. The breakfast orders generally include lots of baked beans, creamed corn on toast alongwith their club sandwiches which are the favored items amongst the vegetarians during breakfast. I love the creamed corn on toast which i feel is amazing. Cold coffee with ice-cream is very well made and customized to  perfection as per your requests. 

Overall, having a breakfast here is an awesome and grand feeling. We know that every luxury comes at a price but in my opinion the price tag here is a bit overshot !!!!

Flury's it is at the end of the day...so it must be good is what people say...

Flury's has a clear competitive advantage with its confectioners. It is a focussed player and has carved its own niche and is cosily sitting there. 

But the drawbacks of the same becomes evident when you bring competitors in or around the same niche. With Au Bon Pain opening right adjacent to Flury's (where there used to a Music World) one can argue that the rush in Flury's might go down over time. With its enormous range and "happening" ambience, ABP does seem to attract Gen Y more than Flury's, which still banks predominantly on WOM for its marketing. 

Apart from the myriad of choices that ABP offers, it also offers something which alone is enough to attract Gen Y - FREE WIFI! So how does Flury's tackle this threat? Well it too offers free WiFi...well at a cost...which is a shame...

Given the market segment that flocks Flury's right now comprises of either tourists/foreigners, or business men with their families (with their BB devices) or people from the previous generations who want to reminisce of the years gone by with their partners. The segment does not look for WiFi connection. And the monitoring and administrative costs associated with maintaining a paid or a free over a certain expense WiFi connection actually puts Flury's at a competitive disadvantage with respect to ABP.

My recommendation: Flury's plays in a niche segment. Do not go for a half-hearted goose chase- ABP has a competitive advantage there. While it will not be able to attract loyal customers of Flury's, Flury's too cannot attract Gen Y or Millennials by simply offering a paid WiFi service. 

Food for thought: Foreigners might be tempted to visit ABP rather than Flury's because of the global image. And word-of-mouth might not be enough to lure them in. Which areas should you really focus on? Paid WiFi is definitely not of of those.

My rating for flurys is only 3 on the basis of just their breakfast and a pastry I had during my last visit.

The omlette ordered with cheese and chicken was just about ok  cheese which they used didn't have a lot of flavor and chicken was just boiled and stuffed in the omlette. not sure if it was a 3 egg or a 2 egg omlette, and the bread served with it was also average.
the staff is friendly the atmosphere is really nice and I am sure the food also must be good 

Chocolate pastry I had was also decent nothing which I would say was different or wonderful ....it had 3 layers of sponge and chocolate which seemed like our regular chocolate. 

Overall I would def go back to try out some more stuff at flurys. 

I rate it 3.0  all the best ....

A great place to hangout with friends or family. Plus, Flury's is not a new name for the foodies in the city. The ambience,food quality and surroundings make this place really a special one. You can always rely on their pastries,cuppachinos or expresso. But other bites are equally good. For instance try the mutton puff,I dare to say that you won't find a better one here in Calcutta! All Breakfast munches are equally good. The service staff is helpful,and you will really have a good time here and surely go back for more..

Flury's !!! The legendary tea-room in Park Street. The one place Kolkata has been frequenting for over five generations.

Most people are praises about it. But I think present day Flury's is frankly over-hyped, over-rated and definitely over-priced.

Flury's is mostly know for their cakes and pastries. They also have an assortment of handmade chocolates.
Their other rage is the All Day English Breakfast. And of-course their Tea. Till very recently Flury's used to be my go to place for a cup of Earl Grey tea. When I wanted to feel all classy and elegant I would put on a fancy dress and walk in Flury's and order their Earl Grey tea and special Flury's sandwiches(which are hand cut tiny sandwiches). But recently the breads feel stale and the tea feels bland. Last time the chicken mustard sandwich was too salty to the point of being almost inedible. I also loved their sausage rolls. But that too sadly has disappointed me  lately. But what disappointed me the most was their Christmas Dundee Cake. I was heartbroken. It was dry and left a not so good aftertaste.

The servers inside Flury's and even the gatekeeper have this air of being high and mighty. I think that adds to the general ambiance of the place. 

I do love the modified version of Flury's ambiance wise but I miss the older Flury's  as much as for the ambiance as for the food.

But nothing beats sitting beside the giant glass walls inside Flury's and watching Park Street pass by.

When Marie Antoinette said, "Let them eat cake,” in the onset of the French revolution she was oblivious of the conditions of the peasants in her country. But when you look at a cake, you become oblivious of the world around you. A cake has the power to make you forget your worries for while; it can bring a big, wide smile on a sad face; it can pamper your taste buds and it can fill your hungry gut. 
 
I think the best place where you can find a good cake is at Flury's. Flury's has many outlets in Kolkata, but I'm talking about the one at Park Street.  Flury's is a most popular cake shop in Kolkata. Whether it is for birthdays parties or other occasions or for Christmas, cake lover prefer their cakes from Flury's. The softness and the freshness of the cakes make them hot favourites among many. I prefer my Christmas cakes from Flury's. 

I like the taste of fermented raisins used for preparing the fruit cakes. The sponge cakes and the marble cakes, too, are very delicious and simply make your day. Apart from cakes and pastries, Flury's has other bakes to offer.  Hungry after a heavy work out session, you can drop in at Flury's to enjoy  a lavish jogger's breakfast that consist of two rashers of crispy rindless bacon, two lean chicken sausages, egg white omlette, one baked vegetable hash brown with two slices of multigrain high fibre toast served with cucumber & spinach juice or carrot & orange juice and green tea. The calorie content of this jogger's breakfast is 446 (approximately).  If you are not so worried about a few calorie intakes, then you can go for a lavish English breakfast that consist of two rashers of crispy bacon, two grilled chicken sausages, one fried egg, one grilled tomato and one hash brown with either two slices of bread and butter or toast and butter with your choice of juice and tea or coffee. 

Apart from a lavish breakfast spread, you can dig into lip smacking puffs and patties. Wholesome Flury's original chicken and chicken and mixed capsicum envelope are simply awesome.  A few quiches or a wholesome chicken and cheese sandwich will satiate your craving for a filling breakfast.  If you want to bring a little change in your daily routine, you can also try special sandwiches or croissant sandwiches at Flury's.  I just love the sundaes served here. A double chocolate sundae, served with generous amount of chocolate sauce does not fail to tantalize my taste buds. 
 
To try a whole array of snacks, cakes, puffs and appetizers, you need to step in once and have your fill. The plush eatery has comfortable seating arrangement for customers. Find yourself a comfortable seat and enjoy your fill.

The small, yet bubbly place overlooking the busy park street, has been a host to people of all kinds, and ages. Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch, High tea or supper....it has it all. May not be too many things on the menu, but what they have, they do well. Its like a monumental place in Kolkata. Good to go, sit down and catch up with some old friends and savor some great eats.

Have been there few times. The place is hailed as one of the most iconic places of park st, even Kolkata. Gorgeously decorated, well lit & well furnished place,with high ceiling... you will instantly fall in love with this place in first look. But in my opinion, if there was any specialty or uniqueness in their food, its long gone! First of all, service is not that good. Have tried their famed Jogger's breakfast, various sandwiches, cupcakes, pasties' & juices. Everytime we had to wait for long to get the order served. And the food, they are not bad, but not extraordinary either. Some of the cakes and pasties are really great though. Specially the cheesecakes & pineapple pasty.... the aroma stays with you. But very very overpriced. You can get far better quality & quantity of sandwiches elsewhere in kolkata at this price! Overall recommended for the desserts, but not for the rest!

I my opinion:
Food quality - Desserts 4.5/5, Rest 3/5
Ambience - 4/5
Service - 2.5/5
Value for money - 2/5

Overall - Decent

We ordered the cordon bleu and the fish with parsley . The former is quite decent. The fish was soft and very very tasty. It made for a nice dish with the steamed vegetables and the French fries.

The pastry range is slightly disappointing. If you come expecting cheesecakes and tiramisu then that would leave you dry. We did have the chocolate truffle which was quite nice.

The waiter was nice enough to suggest the fish, for which we were grateful.

The trip to kolkata would never have been complete without visiting this iconic bakery. It looked quite inviting too with the pink signboard, high ceiling and warm colored ambiance. Since we went there during lunchtime, we had the option of lunch menu but decided to stick to the quick bites. 

To begin with we called for a toasted sandwich- roast chicken with mayonnaise, cucumber tomato and lettuce, a tomato mozarella panini, italian veg panini and a pear melba.  The melba came in quickly but the panini took a lot more time. Sandwich was nice buttery , much like a mexican torta. Italian veg panini was decent but the classic tomato mozarella was tastier. Loved the pear melba with poached pears, ice-cream and whipped cream. Sinful !. Then we went on to the pastry section- rows of pastries lined up wanting to be picked. We selected 2- cappucino and a pineapple cube.  Cappuccino was decent, nothing to rave about and the pineapple one, though like a regular butter-cream pastry was yummy.

On the whole, it was a good experience even though it didn't live up to the hype. But i did like the concept of an English bakery serving breakfast, brunch and high-tea items and one which has stuck on for so long. Waiting for it to open in Mumbai.

A forgettable experience. Flury's, u made me feel like a BEGGAR.

I bought groupon Coupon worth rs 1010 which is supposed to give a basket of things. Visited Flury's on 15th Jan to redeem the coupon only to be told to come on sunday, as they didn't have it. Called on Sunday to check before visting only to be redirected with a host of instructions like mailing at a particular email id booking the offer. Did so. Was asked to collect it today, i.e., 21st Jan 2014. Again called up around 7pm to confirm if the order is ready. Visied around 9pm and was told "Sorry sir, we don't have it, please come tomorrow".

If this is the way a customer is treated more so probably because as i had already paid the money before hand, it's a shame.
It's a shame that this is the treatment one had to get from the fabled Flury's.
I am never visiting this place again and i advice people, before going just by the name, pause and think for a moment.
I rest me case.

The one reason why I used to always visit Flurys whenever I was in Park Street was because of their fabulous Cheese Puffs. Since the time that got discontinued (or maybe they are always stocked out), I kind of lost interest in the place.
As for the food that they serve in general, I find it too expensive for the quantity that they serve and the quality of the food. For the well heeled traveler, it is evident that Flurys has lost its old cooks/chefs and along with them the authentic recipes. I rarely if at all find new introductions to their menu – that is also static. Today perhaps what the proprietor is happy doing is simply milking the consumer sentiments attached with the brand equity of the once famous Flury’s.

Finally...My wish of visiting Flury's around Christmas time was fulfilled this year ! :) The place was beautifully decorated with a Christmas tree and hangings and all....actually it looks pretty awesome all throughout the year. Although I don't particularly have any memories with this place, I can see why people get nostalgic when they talk about Flury's ! It just has that effect I guess...

We ordered the Chicken Mayonnaise Sandwich and a Cold Coffee. Service was fast enough. There was quite a line in front of the pastry counter and it was tough trying to catch the attention of the server. Well, it being Christmas time, I guess this can be excused. I ordered the Black Forest Pastry, Pineapple Pastry and a Brownie. Everything looked super tempting ! :)

Coming to the taste...the Sandwich was really yummy ! The chicken mayo filling was oh-so-delicious. The cold coffee was strictly okay though. The Black Forest was really nice and moist.....just the way I like it. The brownie looked better than it tasted, honestly. I felt it was a bit dry and didn't appeal much to us. Surprisingly, I found the Pineapple one to be the best....surprising because I am a lover of all things Chocolate ! But this was refreshing and yummy.
Overall, had a memorable time....the decor, the food, the legacy....Loved it. :)

This was a very bad dining experience for me. The service was awful and the less said about the food, the better.

I was in Kolkata for three months due to work and decided to visit Flury's with my wife. We went to have breakfast. On arriving there, the guard stopped us and made us wait for about a minute while he checked whether sitting was available. On entering we found a load of tables empty.

Lets start with the food. The omelette was very ordinary, dry and not at all tasty. The chicken sausages were okay but nothing special. The chicken sandwich was awful. It was completely dry and it seemed as if  a 0 point brush had been used to add sauce to it. Our tea and coffee simply didn't arrive in spite of repeated request. The bill took 15 minutes to arrive. And to top it all off, when I decided to use the bathroom while waiting for the bill, I was shocked. I am not fussy about these things and don't have much problem in even using public toilets. But this was beyond words. The smell was simply unbearable, not to mention the stains. And for all this my bill was about 1000!

I've given it 1.5 instead of 1 because maybe its pastries are a bit better and the view is quite good as you can view the street clearly.

Whatever the history and the charm of this place is, I did not get it. The desserts were passable - the rum cake was too sweet and ordinary at best. The tea (Darjeeling tea, eventually billed as Flurys special tea, i think) was not fresh nor reminiscent of the good variety of tea from Darjeeling. Oh, and its overpriced.

It is a sophisticated place with a lot of heritage right on Park Street. It has amazing food and good ambiance. It is not pocket friendly at all but it is not supposed to be either: you are looking at Kolkata's flagship bakery starting from the time when I had not even seen light of day. Then why do I give it a mere 3.5? Well I do not find Flury's to be very cozy and I am not at all fond of the cakes. What I am fond of, however, is the open sandwich full of eggs, bacon, chicken and mayonnaise sauce. Flurys is definitely recommended from my side and whether you visit again or not is your decision, but I have a hunch that you will end up visiting again!

Have visited Flurys several times before but never thought of reviewing it. Today I along with few colleagues, visited Flurys for some desserts. All of us zeroed in on the Blueberry Cheesecake. Priced at Rs90 per slice, the cheesecake is pretty good to taste which is fluffy and fresh with a caramel base. Neither does it taste out of the world nor is it below average. It is pretty decent and worth the price. 
On previous occasions, I have tried their 3 generation sandwich which tasted good enough. 
They have stocked up with fruit cakes and plum cakes due to the festive season and a normal fruit cake costs Rs400. I feel that the place is a bit over rated and there are better confectioners in and around Kolkata which can match up and surpass the quality and taste of Flurys. 
For me flurys would be a good enough confectioner unless I come across something that really surprises me (actually I am waiting for that moment :) ) 
Would be back to taste the other signature items on the menu, till then a 3.5 for Flurys

From my childhood days, I remember Flury's as a place for cakes, patties and pastries. Only much later did I realize that it is a equally great place for tea of the best kind. The sandwiches are special and deliciously filling; particularly the Chicken and Club Sandwich. The Darjeeling tea is beautiful and perfectly made. The pastries and cakes are great too but I must admit here that there has been a couple of poor experiences in the last 3/4 years. I was surprised to find the pastries a bit stale and brittle once a couple of years back. I also had another poor experience with a simple cake and was pretty crestfallen that another of old Kolkata places have gone to the dogs.  I hear that the situation has improved a lot and things are back to good if not great now. Will check it out one of these days as Christmas and New Year is approaching and Park Street is the place to be..... Cheers!!

A lot is written about the place. if you are in Kolkata you must make a visit. What to eat? Try one of these for sure - Eggs / Mushroom / Corn on toast. Have the pastries - Black Forest & the Chocolate Short Bread are favorites. Drink a cold coffee and enjoy the feel good atmosphere of this lovely old tearoom place. Their cheese quiche is nice and on a busy day they might not even have enough of it. 

Oh, you must try some of their home-made mustard sauce. Fresh and a strong aroma makes you want to take some home. 

Besides the light fare of eatables they even have some pastas and sandwiches if you are super hungry and want to feed yourself well.

Flury's is the very essence of Kolkata's British legacy. From the pastry to their breakfast offerings to sandwiches with the soup of the day, sitting down in one of the window side tables at Flury's promises to be a gastronomic treat.
Back when my only introduction to European baking was Flury's and Kookie Jar, I met a French man who raved about Flury's.
Years later, after living for a while in Europe, I know this to be true. Flury's is a world class confectionary any day. 
However, it is important to mention here that the quality of the outlet at Park Street is not matched by the Flury's outlet in Spencer's, South City.

Nothing beats the legacy of Flury's !
Flurys is a legendary tearoom which was founded in 1927 by Mr. and Mrs. J Flurys.
That legacy is continuing till today. The interiors very elegant and royal. One cannot just help but notice Flury's when in Park Street.  A beautifully decorated confectionery sprawling over a big space.

Coming to the food, it was my birthday and I had picked up a cake from Flurys because a birthday cake from Flurys would make it really special!
Now, it was an eggless cappuccino cake priced at 560 which with taxes came upto 600/-
The cakes was very good. The taste of cappuccino could be detected easily and the rich cream and the amazing layers of chocolate just made my day (though it was anyway my day)

It was too good. The cake was a huge hit among my folks and I can happily recommend people to buy their pasties and cakes for special occasions from here! :)

Happy eating guys,
Cheers! :)

Flury's is an all time favorite place in Kolkata to have a wonderful English breakfast if you are somewhere in Park Street.
I've been to this outlet many many times. They have things like sandwiches/toast, puffs, patties, omelet, sausages, croissant and anything you could think of for a nice and cozy breakfast. 
It attracts a lot of visitors in the famous Park Street area.
Ambiance wise no complains about the place as the interiors look very aesthetically pleasing, tables and chairs are of premium quality and there is a giant aquarium as well. Overall a rich feel has been given to the whole restaurant.
To be honest, the prices are little high side, however the place is a heritage and the reason of such prices are simply because of their goodwill. If you sum up the taste of food and overall ambiance of the place you may find prices worth it
Though never tried from there I definitely recommended to all foodies.

Flury's stirs up a lot of memories. Memories from childhood. Whenever I go to the pastries counter in the morning or afternoon I am spoilt for choice and whenever I end up reaching a bit late in the evening I am disappointed. Why so one may ask. It is because all the fresh stock arrives from their bakery in the morning and at best lasts till evening. When I used to pursue my graduation in one of the nearby colleges I was almost a regular there. I still go there as often as I possibly can. All their traditional choices like the trademark boat cake, the chocolate, vanilla, pineapple and strawberry cubes are my favourites. Their hot cross buns during easter are the best in town. The croissants, danishes and quiches are par excellence. Wake up a little early and break your fast there. Bacon and eggs with baked beans on toast. You will be blown off your feet.  Drop in for lunch some time. The traditional sandwiches that they serve, which are not on the menu, are almost as good as fresh home made sandwiches. Never give that a miss. Other than that they have stuffed croissants, pastas, club sandwiches and a lot of other stuff which are perhaps not as good as other stuff available but good nevertheless. One may also have the lunch menu for dinner and finish off with one of their pastries, if any are left till that time and wash it all down with some pretty decent coffee. The decor is really classy and has that feel good factor to it. Get a table near the huge French windows and watch life on Park Street go by. Or get a romantic and cozy table hidden away in one of the corners. The service may take a little time if the place is too crowded otherwise it is as good =as any good restaurant or cafe in town.
The thing with Flury's is whether you eat their or not whether you get a place to sit or not but you can never go back home empty handed, unless your are really determined to do so. One just can't give their goodies a miss, especially people with a sweet tooth like me. Here's to Flury's. Cheers.

Once upon a time there was a confectionery giant called Flurys. But now its just an average cafe. Expensive food, unhygienic food and stale pastries are the few of my experiences. 
Food is very expensive. We tried chicken bolognese pasta and cheese cake. Pasta took ages to be serviced and when served was cold. We found traces of hair in the dish and insisted to return it. Served the same cold dish in fresh plate after taking out the hair. Utter unhygienic and lacks professionalism.
The cheese cake was tougher than rock and hardly have taste of cheese. Frozen cakes/pastries from hypermarket tastes much better than them.
The reason they deserve 2 star from me instead of 1 star because of their famous location reminds me of any European bistro.

..Not here to review the breakfast or tea offered in the restaurant but the Birthday Cake of my daughter..I have been buying the Birthday Cake of my daughter from Flury for last 5 years-- I believe Flury's seriously need to give a thought on this section.. as the catalogue still includes the decade old designs. I offered the image of a nice cake in consultation of chef (Mr. Mishra) & the manager (Mr. Arghyadipta)..the product which was delivered was pathetic as far as the design is concerned(the figures were distorted & even broken). Aesthetic value for the Rs.1000+ cake(2 lbs) was absolutely poor.

There are absolutely no problems with the quality of food. Its awesome as always. But the service is below average. They are absolute snobs because of their reputation. They treat their customers inferiorly. Me and my friend were totally irritated with the way they treated us.

It's heritage, it's nostalgia...or simply put, it's Flury's!
The Nostalgia: I first went to Flury's when I was just a kid, with my baba and he bought me this amazing Chicken and Mushroom patty and a cube pastry. Then one Christmas morning came this delicious Yule Log from Flury's. And my bond with Flury's was sealed from thereon...
Ambience: The Apeejay Group acquired Flury's and reopened it in the December of 2004 and when it did we saw major overhaul, both in the decor, which became more contemporary and flamboyant, and also in its gourmet offerings, which now ranged from the tearoom classics to a more modern lunch and dinner menus. Personally, I love the current decor with its muted warm lighting, chequered flooring and matching roof-height pillars, the huge glass wall overlooking the very colourful Park Street, spacious seating arrangement with contemporary yet classic wooden furnitures, huge ceilings adorned with massive chandeliers and cream walls covered with gilded mirrors and framed sepia photographs and the massive display area with all sorts of delicious baked assortment ready to seduce all your senses.
Service: Impeccable. Period.
Food: Be it the pastries or the pasta, Flury maintains strict quality control for all the food items. Result: everything tastes heavenly. I love the adorable and classic crusted cube pastries and quiches and the patties and their toasted Chicken and Cheese sandwich (orgasmic! I surely am going tomorrow!!). But there are a lot to choose from their continental spread. So several visits is what I would prescribe. And mind the price because you are sure to feel the pinch but cannot really complain, this is a star cafe afterall (managed by The Park). 
Recommendation: Do try their toasted sandwiches, all buttery and delicious and make sure you jog home afterwards!

Flurys is one of the most famous and oldest places in Kolkata which was started by swiss gentlemen during the independence era. It is located on the crowded Park Street and the place has its own charm giving you a vintage feel. Though it is a tea-coffee restaurant you can go at anytime of the day for a quick bite. The inexhaustible menu has everything from english style breakfast to exotic desserts and cake varieties. There are sandwiches, grills, pastas and salads of your choice. The chocolates and pastries are to die for. 

Although, it is an authentic restaurant reminiscent of 30s but my only quibble is that the place should be wifi enabled and they should be open till late. 
The quality has deteriorated over the years, prices have been revised  and is not really worth it…Don’t expect value for money meal...

After hearing so much good thing about this place we went there and tried some pastries.....taste was decent enough but not out of the world, I tried Almond cube and tasted some other pastries from my friends, but you can get the same taste from some other normal shop and at lower price. I liked the ambiance though, it was pretty good. So if you want to spend some quality time after shopping in park street, you can go there and relax but not for the taste.

I visited Flury's with huge expectations only to be disappointed. I and my friend ordered chocolate milkshakes which didn't taste good and were more like Bournvita stirred in milk. We also ordered Hash Browns which turned out to be packaged frozen food available from local markets. Moreover, they were not fried properly and were uncooked the first time and had to be returned for a fresh batch which was promptly done.

You go to Flury's for the atmosphere. In an era of the millions of multi chain coffee and pastry shops which are small in size, Flury's is big, it is grand and it is a lovely place to experience. 

As Flury's has existed for a long time, you see all kinds of people at Flury's. You see the old couple, you see a foreigner, you see a group of friends and you see two drably dressed professionals. 

The coffee and tea are excellent. The pastries are not that great with the butter cream instead of fresh cream. The sandwiches are excellent. The menu is limited, as it should be in a coffee/pastry shop which is not a dinner or lunch place. The price was a bit steep but that's fine for a place where you are going to experience the place more than dine. 

A must visit once while in Kolkata.

We have tried different cakes, chocolates and Continental dish. Cakes are pretty good. But Chocolates are not very special. We found their continental dishes are superb but over priced with lesser quantity not sufficient for one person while price of food is roughly in between 500 to 800. We have  tried their grilled fish with fries, steamed vegetables and parsley butter sauce. I must say taste is awesome. If you have a budget of 2000+ (For continental Main Course) for 2 then they are awesome. Purely English. Sometimes I feel their price is just like 5 star hotel.

So far I have abstained from whining about Flurys (fearing a reprimand from one of my Bengali pals) but even after having given multiple shots to this place, it has still managed not to live up to its name. 

I have dropped by like 5 times to have a quick pastry at this place, every time a bigger disappointment. For some people, these might bring back childhood memories of their loving uncle bringing back home the savory sweet delights, but I find them no better with the pastries available at college canteens and bus stands (at 10th of the price). 

Still, because of the hype, I came by one fine morning for breakfast (as there are not many breakfast options available in this area).  We ordered all the famous items on the menu: Veg patty, Beans on toast, Almond croissant, Hash browns, Omelette, Iced tea. My reviews respectively:   ok no big deal, what was that, well it is just another croissant, too oily, oilier then the previous one, good. 

The staff is pretty complacent given the repute of this place and expectedly, service was lethargic. Sometimes the staff at the pastry counter does not even look at you while you are there, let alone smile and help you make good choices. Prices are high. 

It is difficult to ignore Flurys, given the fine location right at the heart of Park Street. I guess that is why I see a lot of foreigners visiting this place, hoping to relive the British era (although I can’t guess how successful they might be in their endeavor)

memories . thats why i m writing this review. strictly based on memories, nothing to do with the recent day deteriorated flurys.
 long back my father used to take me to his clinic at park street on every saturday.   my attraction were 
the journey by car all the way from barrackpore, hanging here and there at park street and lastly but most important of all was the pastry and patties of flurys.  
even i remember the bread they used to sell were so so soft that it really i repeat it really used to melt in mouth. those hot patties were so perfectly tasted with soft chicken inside and i am literally drooling while writing this review.  there used to be so so courteous staff and the price was not even very high. 
it was place of class and standard with real quality bakery.

but now all has changed, the new management is more into making business with all the old name and fame flurys had. the patties are not that hot, the breads are not that soft, the pastry s lost its magic. the a la carte  served here are so so over priced that every classy foodie would avoid that , more because you get better quality and quantity of same food in a 1 min walk. the only thing that flurys have is her name itself.  
my last experience was really horrible. i went for some patties to have it there and one of the waiter asked me to sit on tools that were separately placed for  "patties ,pastry eaters" . we were munching a bit slow and at that time someone came inside with so called hi fi profile and another man simply asked us to get up and sit any where else .

i would request the management to bring in some polite staff with decent behaviour and also to keep in mind that most of the bongs have a sentiment to park street flurys.
again, this 2.5 is for all the sweet golden memories i had with this place and not for the present state where i cant even relate.

If you are in Kokata, you eventually end up at Flurys. I wish I could say that this was because they have the most exquisite baked goods there. Unfortunately, that would be a lie. 
The only reason one goes to this place now is nostalgia. The dry pastries are nothing to write home about and the cold coffee with ice cream has steadily deteriorated both in taste and serving size. 
The management seems to be clueless and apathetic. The waiters are indifferent and robotic. 
On the plus side, the new dinner menu is quite good but inconsistent.
The place is bright and cheery and if that was the sole criteria I would rate it 5.
My rating for this place would have been 1.5 but nostalgia and the memory of what this place used to be forced me to add an extra point.

Flury's hardly needs an introduction as anyone visiting Park Street would know about Flury's. It is so famous that even if you get off the airport and ask any cab to take you to Flury's without telling him the location, he will take you there without bothering you for directions. Flury's is basically a bakery cum cafe which stands in Park Street since the colonial era.

Flury's is the perfect name for breakfasts if you are somewhere in Park Street. They have things like sandwiches/toast, puffs, patties, omelet, sausages, croissant and anything you could think of for a nice and cozy breakfast. That's not all, you also have preparations for lunch and dinner as well. As far as the recommendation goes, I would go with the English breakfast, however Jogger's breakfast is also good. Also roasted sandwiches are what you will enjoy a nice and authentic breakfast.

The bakery section of Flury's is something for which you will see crowds everyday. Their pastries are delicious and you will fall short of words to describe them. Cakes are also something which will not disappoint you. Chocolate based pastries are my recommendation. For Christmas you should try their plum cake (If you are lucky to get one).

To be honest, the prices are tremendously high, however the place is a heritage and the reason of such prices are simply because of their goodwill. If you sum up the taste of food and overall ambiance of the place you may find prices worth it.

Ambiance wise no complains about the place as the interiors look very aesthetically pleasing, tables and chairs are of premium quality and there is a giant aquarium as well. Overall a rich feel has been given to the whole restaurant.

The restaurant has descent number of tables but considering the rush you will often find yourself waiting for a table to be free. Also with limited space, there is no scope of expansion. On festive occasions consider a takeaway if you see too much rush. On Christmas/New Year's Day or Eve you will struggle to find proper standing place inside the restaurant.

Service is somewhat sluggish and an absolute bizarre on Christmas or New Year Eve (or similar days). Overall crowd management is poor despite the fact that they have ample number of employees, however can't blame them for that. Festive occasion will mean stocks not lasting too much.

To my final conclusion, many people have started grumbling about Flury's services and even on Zomato, it is not difficult to find a negative review. To some extent they are correct, keeping in mind their sluggish service and pocket pinching prices, but I feel that the management of Flury's are trying to improve their services up to some extent by increasing number of employees. To prevent the festive season rush, they could come up with a few other outlets of Flury's (they have done so but those are too small to handle crowd). For prices, they can keep it as far as they provide good services and food.

Time to go back in time, roll the reel and relive this place/// and mind you its all before the great fire and stuff..

So Mom came to calcutta and i had just 1 morning to spend time and show her goos food.
So Flurrys it was.

We loved the English breakfast... its the small things that matter.

The freshly ground coffee... the brown sausages... well dried salami.... your choice of freshly squeezed orange juice( you feel so pampered).... the corissant... and topped with the simple beans and sunny side up...

love the place , more than the food. The cakes and chocolate were a tat wee dry...

Would recommend it to anyone though. Will go back there anytime we are in Cal. ITS A LANDMARK

As the well known iconic cafeteria in kolkata, I was bit disappointed with their performance. At our small get together, we just ordered grilled steak chicken , honey mustard chicken, chicken wings  & some double chocolate sundae over our dinner  , but it was little embarrassing that such kind of restaurant carrying their grilled machine in disorder position, for this reason we had to change our first two ordering item, then we shifted to chicken cordon blue & fried fish. Although the chicken wings were very delicious sticky with BBQ and deeply concentrated sauce. Chicken cordon which was pounded thin and wrapped around a slice of chicken, but the inner portion of the white meat are with a thin slice of a soft, but not easily melted cheese that bit different from others, and not too much tasty. Fried Fish was as usual in good position. At last a bit overcome from my disappointment through double chocolate sundae. Seriously it was completely awesome, vanilla and chocolate stacked layer by layer and slightly sprinkling of chocolate sauce with whipped cream. Last of all I think that Flury's name and fame are carried out by some such kind dessert. I hope that the fault should never resume again. Best of luck Flury's, we will meet soon again with nothing bitter complement .

Wow. A lazy morning breakfast with eggs beacon sausages and crosswich or a wholesome Sunday brunch, be my daughter's birthday blackforest or a christmas turkey or parmesan crusted baked sea bass dinner. This is the place where you can savour your stomach with the best authentic english and continental food. I have no right to review them, rather to praise them for still nourishing the city. A gentle and humble wish to the management: please let kolkatans have the Equal opportunity to enjoy your food, we are not living in British rule so that the doorman can open the door for an European behind me while pushing me off the door on front of my nose, it happened, many a times and is very objectionable. In today's equal rights world please insist on your food recipes and not on old British morals. 1.5 off for continuous misbehaviour of your doormen. Otherwise you definitely deserve 6/5. You rule

A joint of this stature hardly needs a review. Went along for breakfast with my family on a rainy morning and it turned out to be quite a treat. I ordered a coronation chicken croissant and sausages. Both the preparations were quite good and rich in taste and content. Topped it up with a walnut cake and some coffee.Had a great experience. Prices are on a steep side though. Otherwise a great place to hang out occasionally

Flury confectionary is also not bad but certainly it is lesser rated than the kookie jar and cakes. Earlier the pastries use to be really good but these days it has gone down drastically. The boat shape cakes at one time use to be the best, and i loved the chicken patties one of them and your tummy gets really full. But this time when i visited fluries i found the prices were all jacked up... the deco has certainly been spruced up for sure and the ambience is good and all, but the mgt needs to do something about the quality of the pastries and the patties. When i had the chicken patties their was more maida in the patties and less chicken earlier the patties were full with chicken shreds.

Flury's is an all time favorite place in Kolkata to have a wonderful breakfast or their yummy cakes.
I've been to this outlet many times. I've tried their pancakes,sandwiches with coffee and juice.
It attracts a lot of visitors in the famous Park Street area. Since it was very near to my college,it was a very regular hangout for me. I love their black forest cake which I ordered on various occasions.This is the only place where you can get great breakfast options like English breakfast,etc. Flurys is certainly one of my favorite breakfast places in Kolkata.
Such lovely memories :)
Recommended to all foodies.

Try to get a good seat in the restaurant and you will get an lovely glance of the Park Street area.  Other great attraction around it is a man playing flute outside is just awesome and a book store at the footpath helps you pass the time when you are in the queue.

Flury's, of late, has been disappointing. It doesn't taste bad at all - the patisserie and the breakfast spreads are fairly decent.But with an establishment of its stature, one would expect much more than a generic chocolate pastry that its competition can do much better! The management needs to sit down and reinvent its menu, and bring the focus back on quality. Also, it could do with an expansion of space (if possible) as the waiting times are ridiculous!

One of my favourite restaurant since childhood, Flury's has been an iconic place in our city. One of the best places to have sandwiches & continental food, and, of course, fabulous cakes. I haven't given it a perfect score due to their decline in service which is sad for such a place.

If you wish to visit an English/ European cafe without leaving Kolkata, this is the place to be. For an average Calcuttan, the prices may seem a bit on the expensive side, but the good things do not come for free. I have stayed in UK for close to two years and I will vouch for the fact that Flury’s serves authentic European cuisine.
This place offers an all-day English breakfast and I recommend this to all my friends and family. Order a breakfast or sandwiches and tea and chat away with your friends. Do not forget to take some pastries and bakes for your family while leaving.
Once again, like most places on Park Street, the time to get a table inside can be pretty long. So keep some time in hand.
Good food, great ambience and a wonderful experience overall.

A heritage from the time of British Calcutta, this place serves some of the best cakes and pastries. The location is an added advantage; one can just sit there by the glass windows and savour the energy of a busy Park Street. 

Now, to the CONS. Everything here is tremendously overpriced, especially if you consider the quality of other options you get in today's Calcutta for 40% or less of what they charge at Flury's. Also, it's ABSOLUTELY NOT WORTH IT if you wanna go in there for a coffee and light snacks. A CCD or the likes can be a far better option in this regard.

So, if you don't mind the hole in the pocket, Flury's is a must visit, particularly for the cakes & pastries.

Well, Flury's is a huge name in itself, and honestly that's only because of its past glory! 

Its an age old coffee-pastry-snacks-breakfast shop (I don't think they serve complete meals) in the heart of the city of joy. The best part of Flury's is the location. If you are a occasional/one-time visitor to Calcutta or coming back to the city after a long time##, you'll just love sitting by the glass wall in a lazy afternoon, looking at the crowd passing by and get the feel of the city. 

Coming to the food, tea, coffee and snacks are average. Some of the cakes and pastries are good, but highly over priced!  For a cup of coffee, you have better choices around Park Street!

##N.B. the extension is not exactly a review for Flury's. If you just wanted a review for Flury's, you are done.

##As part of your day-plan to conquer Esplanade and Park Street area, get a taxi/metro (both are awesome in their own ways. Probably you can go in metro, and come back in a taxi enjoying the night beauty of the city) to Esplanade, and start walking on the crowded over-used footpath. Follow the crowd, but don't be in hurry. Stop at random street-side stalls, examine thoroughly any article you find interesting, and bargain well. (consider that as a memento and enjoy the fun of street shopping, rather than buying something for heavy serious use. If you need something of that sort, hit the proper shops.) Buy an used book, but do check all its pages are intact. 

If you are not prone to stomach problems, try the pull-kart-with-hand-pump lemon water. Else, have a steaming hot ever boiling tea in earthen pot. Go past the Indian Museum, stop and look at the Maidan. Keep walking and stopping to check out the old shops, with high ceiling, wooden doors and and an old man with specs. Already hungry? Have a couple of samosa or kachori with tamarind chutney, or grab a chicken hot kati roll (ask any passer by for direction, its just around the corner), and keep walking. Take a right onto Lindsey street, and be welcomed by the big stalls of bags, belts, sunglasses, watches, and what not. 

Go on and enter the New Market. Don't know what to buy? Doesn't matter, just roam around and probably you'll find something fancy. Visit Sriram Arcade if you have enough time. Assuming that you don't want to buy cheap jeans, go back and head towards Park Street. Its good time to have your afternoon tea at Flury's with a puff/pastry. Place your order, relax and enjoy the view of the busy street. Continuous stream of people coming from both the sides and disappearing on the other, different moods, different clothes, different speeds - like continuous but rhythmic flow of blood through the heart. Hawkers, office goers, students, beggars, couples and every living and material things add to the beauty of the place. 

If your legs are not already paining, ask someone for direction to Xavier's college. Again, feel the charm of one of the most famous, youthful, energetic, talked-about colleges of the city. They won't allow you in, probably, but that's just fine. Roam around, and call your friend to fix the time for dinner. Now enter any big shop of your taste and browse through the items you like. If you like something but not sure if you want to buy, don't think too much, just get it. 

Peter Cat or Mocambo, the choice is yours. Neither will disappoint you.  Enjoy the dinner with your friend. Have some good cocktail to sooth your body after the days tiredness. Have a traditional beetle-leaf-with-sweeteners-and-spices. Feel it while it melts in your mouth. Get a taxi and forgive the driver who asks for 20 rupees extra on meter, with a smile. Ask him to show the Shahid Minar and Victoria Memorial on your way back home.

One of my favourite! I suppose every Caluttan knows about this place by now. I used to come here several times for breakfast. Now I come frequently, as I have a choice of many cafes in the area. But when it comes to cakes, I still prefer Flurys. Needless to mention, its located in a very posh area, Park Street and has served as a great landmark for all of us alongside the former Music World. Reportedly it has unable to maintain its standards. I witnessed it myself, when I came for dinner on a Sunday & I was told that they had temporarily stopped serving dinner for certain reasons. So we had some snacks and went to 'One Step Up' next door for dinner. I still wont regret going there in the future, atleast for the sake of its ambience. After all its Flury's!

This is a heritage place considered a must visit by tourists because of its history.I had been to this place recently.The bakery items are nice.The cakes are good.But the prices are very high.While the cakes may justify the price tag,the food items are not worth the price.The quantity is not sufficient.The staff are not helpful either.The ambience is a bit different and some people find it aristocratic.But I for one certainly wont visit a restaurant more for the ambience than the food.But still considering the heritage and history of the place the bakery items are worth a try,at least for once.

I don't know how the quality of this place could go down so much in just one year. I visited Flurys last year and found it to be really yum and the prices were quite reasonable. Today when I went there, the taste of both the patties and the pastries have gone down tremendously and prices have nearly doubled in a year. Worth a skip now

Flury's, a heritage place, so ambiance wise its top notch. Tourists actually consider the place a must visit, cant blame them, it does have a history.

Have been to this place numerous times basically for their bakery items but this time decided to try something new so opted for their all day english breakfast. I know what a patent english breakfast contains so if we are to draw a comparison, i must say i wasn't that satisfied. For a girl of average appetite the quantity can be considered good but for men its waste of money. So basically they call it english only for the items served on the plate, otherwise its a basic dish with a high price. Coming to their pastries,  I personally dont like their pastries anymore and the cost is quiet high, there are better places i feel. The staffs too aren't very active or overtly busy one can say because no matter what this place draws huge consumers.

Basically a place for those who likes the aristocrat feeling, bit lame though, otherwise average in my view.

To be true I wouldnt have given it even 1 if hadnt tasted its sandwiches but I'd say its waaaay over priced.
And the most disappointing part is the quality of pastries they serve...Kookie Jar or Cakes is 100 times better than this.
Just because you are reputed doesn't mean you have the authority to sell stale and sometimes rotten pastries.
And no its not the first time. it happened thrice and now I never want to return to that place.
I stay far away so couldn't just go and throw those stinking and gummy(it was so stale that the frosting was gummy and kind of split)pastries at their arrogant staff's face.
One simply doesn't pay around 60 bucks for a pastry for this kind of crap

Amazing ambience (in fact the best in the city I can say). It is just near my college and being a regular there, I would say that prices are the only disadvantages. And yes, one thing I would definitely comment that the quality of cakes (birthday cakes and Christmas specialities) is inferior to Kookie Jar. It was much better before. Also the non-veg snack items are "bad". If someone tries the chicken envelope of Kookie Jar he will definitely hate Flurys for theirs. But if you want great hospitality and ambience, this is unmatched.

It is located near the music world which is gonna close soon. I had visited here few months ago and had ordered pastries. it was very average. Flury's now is just a name for which it is running. 

Coming to the pros and cons now:-
Pros:-
1) pretty huge heights
2) good ambience
3) huge seating area

Cons:-
1) staffs are busy in their own work god know what business they do.
2) no one to look after customers
3) pastries were very average I could make better pastries at home or try at any coffee shop
4) it is just a hype nothing else
5) costly food not worth quality.

Overall a bad experience.

Flury's is considered to be one of the oldest bakeries in the City. As i was reading the history of Gourmet of Kolkata i learnt one thing interesting, i guess you did not know that Mrs Flury eloped  with Mr. Fox ( Blue Fox founder) back in the days well that is as far as the History of Flury's goes. 

The Flury's breakfast use to be really yummy but of late it has gone down. Lucky for me  Flury's have an outlet at the Saturday Club on Wood Street and so even if i do not visit flury's Park Street but certainly I get a taste of the confectionary items at the club bakery. 

Recently devoured into some amazing mango based biscuit cake and mango cheese cake which was awesome. The Chicken patties content inside needs a proper overhauling, i feel there is something wrong with the fillings, more so the crust of the patties is not being made properly, earlier the patties at Flury's had a particular aromo but these days that typical Flury's aroma is lacking drastically and the patties does not taste like Flury's anymore 
well i guess with the passing of time you do get new confectionary chefs well its all in the game nevertheless I feel the Chef needs to have the correct combinations of chicken shreds, onions and the masalas.   

The Price of the bakery items is also competitive. But what i am really impressed with is the deco of the Park Street Fluries it has give Flury's a complete face lift these days.

I have been a patron of this tea room for as long as I remember and have defended it on numerous occasions when people from the older generations have criticized its deteriorating quality of products. It is true that previously its quality would fluctuate at times and I myself had gotten cream based products which were not particularly fresh but then again I have always given them the benefit of the doubt and have not been disappointed in my further visits. What I would hold dear was the extremely courteous servers who make you feel very special each time you enter the premises. I must say and wish that they pull up their socks.

Flurys is definitely not worth the hype that has been created. For starters, its "speciality", Baked Beans on Toast, is a complete disaster (irony?). My mom makes a better baked beans on toast preparation for breakfasts - that too for much less than the cost of eating out at Flurys!

However, few things that are really good are its cheese garlic mushroom on toast (they could avoid liquidizing the whole preparation by adding sooo much of milk) and the hash brownies. The coffees are really mediocre. The omlettes are good especially the cheese omlette.

The chocolates are worth a try and the rum balls are really really good!! Also, for those who buy bread loafs, try their masala bread, multigrain breads and croissants - you won't be disappointed!

I have been there three to four times and I didn't find any special taste in their cakes and pastries which looks kinda home made stuff. I heard a lot about their morning breakfast but never had a chance to have it coz it's too far from my location. Talking about the ambiance, yes indeed it has a historical feeling to it, with high ceiling, big glass windows and checkered flooring everything looks so nice. I would really like to have their famous breakfast and try other dishes too. It's a thumbs up from me.

The one place that helps any Calcuttan associate with the city. Emotionally a 5 to this place, practically no eatery can have a cent percent rating, hence the 4.5
Seen this place grow as Ive grown up. Be it their thick icing pineapple cakes or be it their sugar coated sweet buns, everything you find here is just awesome.
Miss their loaf breads though, which were formerly available at the Apeejay house, next to the maple restaurant.
Though not regular with this place anymore, Flurys will always rule the hearts of one and all. 
Just Brilliant..! Needless to say A MUST VISIT.

a Calcutta landmark which had been refurbished into some jazzy outlet which sells overpriced food in presumed luxury. be warned that if you want to have a pastry... again randomly overpriced.... then the staff may not allow you to sit.... hospitality is at a low ... and I do not think they care
breakfast is the only thing I will recommend but the old magic is a thing of the past.... now it's a pricier luxurious coffee/tea shop--- bakery mix....

Flury's ... Great decor and ambiance . . I have heard a lot about the breakfast at Flury's, but could not make it up for bfast time when I was in kolkata... So after so many days of planning, I visited the place for evening tea. One of my friend had recommended about the chicken patties at flury's and he also told me that it is the best available in india. 

So with great expectation, I ordered for a tea with chicken patties. It was good to taste but obviously not the best I have had. I then tried some pastry items and found them good. 

The waiters over here offer great hospitality. Anyone who visits kolkata should visit flury's for its variety in menu . .

The classic English cafe, Flurys brings back memories of Calcutta's rich heritage and history. From the minute you enter this place, you travel back in time and the experience is truly memorable. The ambience and the decor of the place is just fantastic. Flury's All Day Breakfast is probably one of the things a lot of us have tried and isn't it just heavenly on a fine Sunday morning with your loved ones ? Moving to other items, those marked "Heritage" are truly the finest. The Beans on Toast and the Coffee Sprungli deserve special mention in this regard. Or just the cup of tea. I only have good memories of this place. I remember when I was small, my father used to take me to Flury's specifically for the Beans on Toast and it is still a favourite, although the ones I make at home never compare to the one I have here. Another one was watching a frantic day of cricket at the Eden Gardens and coming to Flury's really hungry to an amazing Spaghetti Bolognaise, the best I have ever tasted. Moving on to other stuff, their cakes are ones to die for. 
Although I understand that Flury's is moderately expensive, but you do understand that they never compromise on quality and that probably explains everything. You can go around the country and I doubt how many proper English-styled cafes you will find.
Thumbs up, highly recommended. If you haven't been here, you don't belong to Kolkata, Sir !

Breakfast at Flurys

Flurys is famous as an eatery from the British era, one which has maintained its Anglo-Indian charm. I have hardly been there while growing up in Kolkata. I had heard a lot about it, passed by it every time I crossed Park Street and even been there once or twice. My personal opinion was the place is more about the charm and heritage and the spread of the menu rather than the actual taste of the food. But this visit of mine even made me a fan. I may not be craving for the food, but I would love to go back again and again, just for the charm of the place.

Service was excellent too. The staff courteous and attentive.

If you enjoy eating, DO NOT come here. Visit only if you want to impress your companion. But, if your companion is a foodie, you are done for.

I have spent a fortune in this shop. Reason: its location and undeniable charm. Other than these two, there is nothing to recommend. The food served is stale and tasteless compared to its competitors.

A land mark destination which I very much was looking forward to, and so on a recent visit we entered Flurys to a packed house at 10 in the morning on a week day.
We were on holiday, but I wondered what everyone else was doing in a tea room in the middle of a working morning.Such is the charm of Flury's that it makes you stand still. I say makes you stand still, because it literally forces you to take in your surrounding.
The service is slow, even though the waiter5s seem perpetually harried. 
Flurys has been the tea house of the British who made tea time fashionable, and you can still feel the echoes of the past in it's walls. The floor to ceiling windows, an antique chandelier, and a wall with sepia tinted pictures of baked delicasies coax you into a bygone era.
Having read previous reviews on the declining food quality we stuck to the classics.
The menu card very help[fully meantions H in front of dishes which have heritage value.
We tried the much recommended Cocolate Sprungli and were a tad dissapointed. No doubt it is a high quality cholotate and coffee milk shake. 
The club sandwich was mega, and absolutely delicious. It is the grandpa of club sandwiches. This place has been doing club sandwiches when India didn't know what that meant, and so I am guessing that the others are copies of this dish.
The surprise element was the pineapple slice in club sandwich, which blended right in with the chicken mayo and the Ham and egg.
For 700 ruppees for a breakfast of a milk shake and sandwich was a bit pricey though...

Took a friend here for coffee at night ,I made the mistake about talking flurys up of being one of the best confectioneries in the city and that it was extremely popular among the locals ( i havnt been here in ages).What a let down ....walked in to the shop there were plenty of tables that were empty ...and dirty ....with the old cups and plates still littering them.!! Staff all grouped up in one corner chatting to each other no one to show us to a clean table. Finally located one with nothing on it sat down there ...the table was not wiped down properly it was still stained with old spilt stuff....anyway waited for 10 minutes for someone to take our order ...no none came ,finally caught someone who looked like a manager and placed my order ,two cups of tea and a brownie ,20 minutes later nothing .....then I ask someone and they say its coming ....10 minutes later a waiter comes to take our order...all over again....!!! At this point we walked out in disgust. So much for being a gem in the heart of the city...! This place could be so much more and it's a shame it's being wasted like this.never going there again or recommending it !

Flury's once my dream shop  has turned into a clear disappointment. The biscuits and pastries, sundaes  which were once my favourites have now become quite tasteless. I hadn't expected this from Flury's. I had a sandwich and it didn't even contain the filling it was just full of cheese. Now, what do you feel like when you are about to eat in Flury's expecting a yummy meal and getting abolutely nothing. If I had known that Flury's was serving food like this I certainly wouldn't have gone there and would have gone to may be monginis if I wanted such floury meals which are absolutely more cheaper . The 2.5 I give is just  for the heritage it has.

Flury's is a disappointment. The hype over it is remarkable given the fact that their core products, the bakery items, are almost always stale. Of late, their chocolate and biscuits taste terrible - milk powder in the fudge and gritty dust in the biscuits.

The decor is very good and the menu looks very promising. A few items - sandwiches, ice-cream sundaes and suchlike - are good, but not enough to make one come back again. A visit to the bakery counter will produce more disappointment on account of the staleness/use of inferior raw material mentioned earlier. The prices of the restaurant items and the bakery products are very high, which adds to the disappointment - a mass-market chain like Kathleen's produces some things that taste better and cost much less.

The only thing that is good about the place is the Dark Chocolate Bar they sell. However, one product is not enough to make one like it or recommend it to others.

Located in the prime location on Park Street in Calcutta, Flury's attract a large number of clients due to its gourmet food and a gamut of deserts. 

Calcuttans recognize Flury's more by its pastries, cakes and variety of desert products.  I have had lunch with Thai food as well as have been trying its excellent pastries.

I recomment wholeheartedly to any food lover to step in here and try out variety of food available here.

Flury's goes back a long, long time for me. An outing in Park Street was never complete unless we went to Flury's for a pastry tray and Viennese coffee served by caring waiters. Things have been changing over the years - management changed, and along with it a lot of things that we were used to changed. Change is not bad - not at all - but when it takes away the intangibles (for it is the intangibles that make a restaurant what it is) and compromises on the food, then it is time for the danger bells to clang. Once, twice, three times we gave ourselves excuses for the badly served food (we had something to compare with you see)...and didn't want to write Flury's off. When T3 happened, I shifted my loyalty there. But then that too closed down.

The worst happened the other day when a friend of mine was visiting Calcutta for the first time, and in her list of to-do's and to-see's was Flury's. I told her it was not the same but her reaction was Cal, and no Flury's? So we went. Since it was close to tea time, we ordered the Viennese coffee they are famous for. We were kept waiting for half and hour--in the meantime we noticed the attitude of the waiters - disturbing to say the least....and finally when the famed Viennese coffee was brought balanced on a waiter's arm, and thumped on the table in front of us, it was half a cup, and lukewarm.....and the bill? Rs 320. 

I didn't say anything to my friend's remonstrations.....we just left....

and thought....NEVER AGAIN

SAD......but never ever again....

Flurys is one of the oldest European Cafe in Kolkata, my dad always shares his memories of breakfast with his friends after morning college classes at Xavier's.

Have been going to this place since I was a kid. Love the place. The pastries, breads and other confectioneries are a beauty in the mouth. The omelet, bean on toast, corn toast, etc. at this place is absolutely amazing.

Although since its refurbishment the prices have almost tripled, but they never compromise on the food or on the services.

Always make sure that a prior reservation is made to avoid delay in services.

Went on a Sunday evening for coffee. The manager or someone was screaming at some waiters for some section not being clean. We called on of the guys wearing a tie and jacket for our order, who very reluctantly took part of the order then called his underling to again take the order. We repeated the order to the waiter twice , which was not very complicated. He and the guy in tie came twice to clarify as they had got the order wrong. We had got carried away and ordered the heritage items. Which were all so so. The tea was nice. But how wrong can you get with tea. Over all a pretty sad experience for

The first thing you'll notice, especially on the weekends, is a long line of mostly foreigners queuing up outside the establishment, one that hasn't lost it's old English charm. With chandeliers and glass-topped tables, Flury's still feels like you have stepped into little England.  

Now, the food. Had the English Breakfast which was of course, lip-smacking-good. The sandwiches (we had the egg salad and the ham) were done beautifully. The hash browns were crispy yet not burnt and the cheese omelet was well, yummy! There was an assortment of juice, tea or coffee to choose from and I had the Earl Grey Tea. The Cheesy Lasagna was good, though a little heavy on the palate. The bacon was fried to perfection and the Cream Chicken Pasta was delicious!

Now the desserts, isn't that what drag us to Flury's anyway? The most succulent, moist and warm Chocolate Brownies I've ever had come from here. And the Almond Pastry was delightful too. The Rum Balls are also one of their signature dishes and live up to the hype. Try the chocolates, they're made by Flury's itself.

Overall, it's expensive and one might not want to visit everyday. But if you're in Park Street and want a place to indulge your sweet tooth, then Flury's it must be!

So maybe the bakery and confectionary section is nice but the breakfast and dine in is just about average. The Ham stuffed croissant had 8 small pieces of ham and was stuffed mostly with onions. The mutton puff though stuffed appropriately was dry. Baked beans tasted like they came out of a can. And of course the service. It's like they are in lala land and forget that you even there. So you have to remind them every 20 minutes or so that you have come there to eat and have placed an order.

If someone is looking for old world charm in a contemporary cafe,then Flury's Park Street should be his/her destination..i often visit there just to enjoy their traditional full English breakfast..yummy..from hash browns and poached tomatoes to crispy bacon strips to baked beans,it oozes flavour and taste.the steaks are juicy,tender and perfectly marinated in red wine..be it a busy monday morning brunch or a lazy mid-week high tea with scones,Flury's always is a mesmerizing place..sipping on earl grey tea and looking at the hustle-bustle outside is such a romantic joy for me!!! also the icings on the strawberry cakes..so sugary yet so tasty..simply amazing..this British styled cafe has been a jewel in the food map of Kolkata for many decades and will continue to be so in the future as well...

Two of the oldest and most popular places at Park Street are Flury's and Trinca's.
There is an interesting story behind this: where Flury's stands today, there used to be a tearoom called "Flury's and Trinca's". And then, Mr. Flury ran away with Mrs. Trinca. The partnership naturally split, and these two have come to be two separate, but established institutions that have come a long way on their own rights.

The decor at this place is mindblowing, maintaining a perfect British era retro look in terms of service as well as ambience. The food quality is unparalleled, and if you haven't had breakfast at Flury's, you're surely missing out on something sorely. Their signature treat consists of bread, eggs, hash browns, sausages, grilled tomatoes, bacon and a choice of beverages.

The sandwiches are just too good, especially the Open Swiss and Club variants. You might explore the Steaks in Wine Sauce, Lamb Lasagna, Cream Chicken Pasta and the Rum Ball.

The icing on the cake is the desserts section. This is something many Calcuttians go ga-ga over, and not for the wrong reasons. They make their own chocolates - something that is somewhat rare in this city - and they do it beautifully. it melts in your mouth, leaving an impression on your taste buds that is surely going to make anything else seem bland for the next few days.

Your tour of the best confectioners in this region remains incomplete without Flury's and it's signature cakes, pastries and chocolates.

Verdict: It is heavy on the pocket, but is surely worth it.

One of the best bakeries in town! Located in the heart of the city (Park Street), this place boasts of amazing service, amazing decor and lovely delicacies to choose from! The last time I visited was during the Durga Pujas and they served authentic bengali dishes, which would give any Bengali cuisine restaurant a run for its money.

One of my favorites!

Through my stay in Kolkata last year, Flury's made a very special place for itself in my heart. I haven't been there anytime before so I cant compare it with how they used to be. But as of today, if you're in Kolkata, Flury's is a must visit.

To begin with, the place has a very retro British feel to it, and I especially liked the fans so much that I wanted to take one home! Food wise, they have a huge variety of deserts and bakery items. I'm not a big fan of their rum balls and mushroom patties, but everything else is mind blowing. In my opinion, every desert here is special and the recipes have been passed down by generations and you wont taste the same thing anywhere else. They also make their own chocolates, and the Dark Chocolate Bar priced at 150 INR is a must try. Its the best dark chocolate I've ever tasted!

Flury's is a hot spot for breakfast, and if you're lucky enough to be able to to get a table, you must go for their signature breakfast which basically consists of Toast, Fried Egg, Hash Browns, Grilled Tomato, Sausages, a portion of Bacon, Juice and Tea or Coffee. Their Club Sandwich and Open Swiss Sandwich are also worth trying, and can only be described as gorgeous.

But, THE one thing you have to try here is their Creamy Chicken Pasta which is in white sauce with a delectable chicken topping. You must also try their Penne Lamb Bolognese and Chicken and Mushroom Quiche. I wouldn't recommend their lasagna though, its way too cheesy and bland.

A little pricey for Kolkata but definitely RECOMMENDED!!

I have been a regular at Flury's and this place has been one of my gastronomic pilgrimage since my college days. I have always missed this place since I have moved out of Calcutta.So I was very excited to go for a breakfast this morning with loads of nostalgia.

But the experience was not good this time. 
1. For a INR 540/- English breakfast, the portion size was lesser than what we expected as we had the same breakfast 3 yrs back for around 250/-. Probably we underestimated the inflation. Also the food was just about warm and not hot.
2. We were served fruit juice and after 5 mins another waiter came and took the glasses saying they were not for us as our order was tea. The point is in no restaurant I have seen something which has been served has been taken back from the table. I agree they have served us fruit juice by mistake but as a courtesy no eatery would take away the food/drink after sometime without even apologizing. 
3. Waiters were almost talking at a pitch which we call shouting.
4. One waiter suddenly came and tried to clear our plate which still had food on it. At that point we really had to raise our voice as were getting irritated with the things happening.

Since the eatery is managed by the Park Hotels, such things were not expected especially when the legacy of Flury's has been very different.

This place is famous.Stop any self respecting odious Calcuttan,and the quest for expensive confectionaries would lead you to the Doorstep Of Flury's,park street.But,personally I feel that this place is too hyped.Prices are high.Many items are pretty good..but there are items which fail to deliver.The only section that I feel lives upto the legendary image of Flury's is the desserts section.A shocking aspect is the rudeness of the impeccably turned out waiters. They often behave in a manner which is not pleasing.The managemment tried to recreate the old colonial era of the distinguished gentry,but lost their way somewhere in between.Prices are high.The last time I visited the place,5 of us clocked a bill of 2500 rupees.The math follows. :-) This is a heritage place,but it merits only a couple of visits;not more.

Visited yet again after a long time, and really enjoyed the meal. The food and drinks were served on time and of excellent quality. Someone mentioned an issue with the service but I kind of disagree busy places do have busy staff as long as they take orders courteously and serve well I dont think the service would be considered an issue.

Flury's, reminds you of the traditional bakeries in Kolkata. Situated in the Middleton row and Park street corner, this bakery serves you with the best cakes of the city. The royal chandeliers provides the perfect ambience to the bakery. Courteous staff, lovely cakes and good food marks this place. I especially enjoy the vanilla cake which has the perfect icing on it. The creamy lasagne tastes perfect yet light on your stomach. I particularly enjoy the juicy honey mustard chicken for a crisp lunch. On a whole, I would recommend all foodies to visit Flury's not just for its famous English breakfast but also a good lunch.  

Pocket pinch 1200 (for two persons)

Flury's. One of the oldest  confectioneries of Calcutta, located on Park Street, its very hard to miss! They have been serving traditional confection items for almost 90 years and have grown to be one of the most popular eateries over the years. The old European Cafe has now been renovated to give a contemporary look yet it retains its charm and timelessness.

After a long time, I met up with a few friends over lunch at Flury's. In the past I have had an all time favourite which is their All day Breakfast. It consists of rashers of crispy bacon, grilled chicken sausages, fried egg, grilled tomato and hash brown served with toasts and juice or tea/coffee. You may alternatively try their joggers breakfast if you re on a diet! This apart I would recommend the open sandwiches, club sandwiches and the creamy chicken & mushroom on toast. The flavors of most their dishes are spot on!

The other day we ordered a meaty lamb lasagne. The lasagne was creamy, heavy and    
full of flavour. It had a good mix of tomato and generous amounts of cheese to balance the taste. Good portions and a makes a heavy dish. Best when shared with another side order.

This apart we ordered a grilled fish served with fries, vegetables and a parsley butter sauce. The fish was a well marinated one, cooked to perfection. The outer coat was crispy and was soft on the inside. I must add that quality of fish they serve is one of the best I ve had. The vegetables were well tossed and crunchy. 

We also tried a grilled chicken steak in red wine sauce. This one too was a cracker. Soft and well marinated, the steak went really well with the sauce. What i liked about the presentation was that they diced the pieces instead of serving a slab of meat.

For dessert we ordered, a creamy chocolate shortbread brownie, a chocolate pista   
circle and a vanilla cube. The pastries cant really be described. You need to taste it to understand the unique cakes. The sweetness of the cake and right freshness of the cream and icing was a perfect end to a wonderful meal. Also, worth trying are their rum balls.

Overall great meal. Would love to visit again!

Pocket pinch per person: 700 Rupees (drink, main dish and dessert)

Rating - 4/5

Always Glamorous, happening, awesome & full-of live place is the Flury's. Specialty is of various Dessert. Sandwiches are also too tasty. But quite costly. It can be weighty for your wallet. But if you want to taste some real good food & want to enjoy a comfortable-cozy ambiance, you should go for it.

Flury's at Park Street is the most over-rated joint. The cakes and pastries are awful. Imagine taking a birthday cake for your loved ones and that turining out to be salty....the icing hard and unpalatable.

I had tremendous expectations from Flury's...only thing good was the black forest cake and pastry.

And people feel proud of this awful place.........I would not recommend this place to anyone.

I truly miss the old Flurys !!! There is no doubt that this one is far more glitzy and glamorous but somehow it does not feel like the Flury's of my childhood ...  the Flurys I knew and loved !!! However from time to time nostalgia drags me there to sample the chicken patties and the rumball ... and drink it down with a cuppa of Darjeeling tea! I also pick up a loaf of milk bread to carry home. What I miss the most are the old waiters who called us "baba" because they saw us from the time we were born and the tea sandwiches made of chicken or ham loaded with mustard the taste of which I still long for. Now the chicken sandwiches have mayo and the ham is processed not hand cured and you come away wishing you could turn back the clock !!!!

You go to Flury's for the pastries, you can have everything else everywhere in Park St. If you drop in and you must, you should try the pineapple fresh cream, the lemon tart, almost any pastry you can see there will amaze you in terms of quality. The staff gets a little hectic in times of rush, but they are quite friendly when the rush is off. And as a token for your family members do carry the caramel chocolate toffees that are absolutely delicious. 

I do know that this place is overpriced, but you just don't get to eat arguably the best pastries in town if you don't pay good enough!

I would say a bit oberpriced, but what the hell, it is still the best and it has definitely maintained its quality and tradition since my first visit as a kid. One of the best gourmet restaurant in kolkata ofcourse. A must visit for everyone I suggest.

Flury's.. Located in Park Street and is one of the most known confectioneries of Calcutta. When you go to a place like Flury's.. you expect good food and amazing service. What you end up getting is mediocre food and pathetic service! There might be some dishes there which are really good and famous but with the kind of service they dish out, I'm very unlikely to try them out anytime soon. It is overpriced for food that's neither presentable nor palatable and mostly stale. Even the baked beans on toast was extremely sweet for my palette, considering it is supposed to be a savory dish. The coffee served here too, is aweful. In one word it is just - Over-hyped. One star.

Rum Ball or the Shahi Tukra - I always wondered if such names would ever come in my mind, cause I felt i was weak at framing new names.
Flury's is one such unexampled place that has its own rare unbeatable taste. 
Each dessert keeps up is style of look and taste. The place is clean, which might always have you feel a rich experience of the food you are ordering. This might give you the experience of an exquisite dining I would say, But yes the the motive of having a sweet sweet dish will be definitely fulfilled here.

Flury's  is just situated in the heart of Park Street and is one of my favourite cake shops. One month before I went for a Breakfast,I had omelets with shredded chicken inside in it  and cappuccino. Never had such lovely breakfast anywhere than flury's. Top notch ambiance and well mannered staffs makes the place nice. Their cakes and pastries are just fantastic. Breakfast is also palatable. On sunday i went at 8am. Park Street at that morning was uncrowded and was maintaining silence. My heart was refreshed after having breakfast in clean atmosphere. Folks,you can try having breakfast here on sundays,but try to go there before 10 am because the place will be filled with people as time passes. This place deserves 4 stars.

I still dont know what the hype about flury's is .. 

i simply dont like going there.. The food is mediocre, the coffee is ordinary, and the staff is the snootiest in the city. i even got snarled at by an old steward for asking water over n over again... not my fault if the sandwich was so dry that i needed to swallow it with water. 

the confectionery items havent changed since 1920, with pastry shops all across the city serving state of the art sweets, i dont think flurys is anywhere near tolerable . The whole hype about the colonial past and it being a part of kolkata history, well,,, its pretty historic in its ways ... 

the chocolate boat is something tasty here and so are the chicken wings. i hate the cappuccino here..

My God!!! So many reviews...n most madly in love with flurys! I guess it comes to people who've been born n brought up in Calcutta....considering that Flurys has been there since 1927! 
The first time I went to Flurys I fell completely in love with the quaint ambiance..overlooking the busy Park Street. Sadly it vanished as soon as the food arrives. The Chicken Croissant was stale and rubbery. The coffee was average... I ordered a hot chocolate which was lukewarm and had a mosquito in it! Honestly I make better hot chocolate at home. The only thing that somehow saved the day were the desserts...though v selected items are good. Try the black forest, its quite good...definitely avoidable is the lemon tart. The only saving grace for flurys would be their sunday brunch which can be tried once. 

Flurys has too many cons to be overlooked, the slow service, the snooty waiters, overpriced for food that's neither presentable nor palatable!! Go there for the experience if you are new to Calcutta... though don't expect it to be too memorable!

A crap bakery. The only Black Forest in the city I used to agree to eat is now almost always stale and disgusting. The other cake slices and puffs and snacks is not something I would ever buy again. The teas and coffees are decent but nothing special. Only the ambience is great - a coffee by the window watching Park Street on a rainy September evening is matched by very few other sights and sounds. But the food is extremely overpriced for the quality and the quantity. A nice little tea room for a cosy evening out but I wouldn't go there to eat.

Flurys evokes in me a feeling of happy spring mornings,very cozy and comfortable place,delightful ambiance and polite service. The place has a pleasing charm. The  breads are excellent,stuffed Omlettes are too good,and the Darjeeling Tea, lovely.Very few places in Kolkata serve food and beverages with the requisite cutlery,but this place does always. Perfection indeed!
I am not a huge fan of the desserts here, the Rum Balls and Chocolate Pastries didn't suit my taste, but they are much better than most of the places around. Not just for the food, this place is a must-go for the experience as well.

Since I'm new to Kolkata I was quite eager to sample food from the local joints. Seeing the reviews here, I was quite tempted to go to this well famous, transgenerational establishment.

In all fairness, and to try to provide a background behind the rating, I was expecting something along the lines of "Cafe Goodluck" in Pune, which does have a "quaint" atmosphere and has its "unique" (and quite good) food, especially some that it's quite well known for. I also went at night, so maybe that too affects the whole intended effect of being there. I also didn't try the pastries, but after reading the review to follow, maybe you'll forgive me, and maybe even understand and sympathize.

I ordered a pretty standard meal - spaghetti bolognaise and a mocha. I am still amazed, two hours after the fiasco that was presented before me, as to how a chef can butcher the pasta SO badly, leave alone the ragu I love and hold so dear to my heart. No carrots, a most peculiar pungent smell of vinegar, and just the slightest hint of wine, which one could barely discern over the embarrassingly large quantity of salt. This wasn't a dish made with love, this was one made out of spite and disgust, and the reaction from this unwitting recipient was the same. The two complementary buns provided with the dish served quite well as a towel for my tongue after that brutal salt scrub (the buns may have been good, but due to the holocaust on my taste buds, there were too few surviving members to gauge their propriety). It claimed to have lamb, but it was almost certainly boiled mutton. For something that requires 2 hours or so of careful preparation, with even more careful spicing to get it right (due to the wine and meat), I didn't expect something to blow my mind .. not here anyway. That being said, I have had the "chicken bolognaise" variety in several places, have had the "original" abroad, and have made the "authentic" version a couple of times. But this was seriously atrocious in comparison to anything claiming to be a bolognaise I've tried anywhere. Charging Rs.400 was adding insult to injury. I would have said they added salt to my wounds, but I think they exhausted their salt in my "bolognaise". 

And the coffee... where on Earth do I begin. I dare call myself a coffee connoisseur for a few reasons, two of which are quite relevant - a)I've tried nearly all the "milk" coffees, hot and cold, in this country and abroad... as well as different brews and strengths, for 12 out of my 25 years of existence, and b) I can distinguish flavours quite well usually, that is to say I have successfully been able to tell whether a person just dumped the ground beans in boiling water, or extracted them using a french press or an espresso machine. The beans and their roasts also have different flavours, and experiencing these is one of the few sinful joys of my earthly existence. For someone like me, going into flurry's and experiencing their coffee was like being castrated by Adolf Hitler in front of my cackling ex-girlfriend. I am more puzzled than amazed as to how they extracted their coffee at all. I could swear it had chicory in it, but the coffee had no presence. The coffee itself had no crema. The crema is that frothy golden thing, which is basically the oils in the beans. Virtually anything involving mixing hot water with coffee beans is going to give you this. What does get affected most is what I'd call the "tartness" of the coffee, but you get what is arguably coffee with a certain "body" to it. This was the first time in my entire life that I've ever had a cup of coffee which didn't have the body of a proper coffee extraction. Maybe they extracted it and then added a lot of water to save cash or something. Whatever they did, it robbed me of the little bit of joy I could have had with my Flury's experience, and this was a lot more disappointing to me personally than the bolognaise. To call what they served up a mocha was also a joke. A mocha has a certain proportion of foam, milk and coffee. what you get is a smidgen of foamed milk with a large cup of watered down coffee, with admittedly chocolate in it. I could tell the chocolate, which many going there may not .. but it was there, again, in all fairness. It's just the coffee that was hugely disappointing to me (the proportions and the thing as a whole was slightly less disappointing). It could be that the salt of the bolognaise affected my taste, but salt should have heightened the taste of coffee, which it does, as opposed to suppressing it. This just makes the coffee doubly damned.

So I coughed up the Rs.530, and I couldn't stomach giving them a tip. Not after that. I felt dirty, cheap and used... not something one should usually feel after a meal to say the least. I am pretty hard to disgust food wise, and this is truly one of the rare occasions where expectations and reality ended up being so vastly different, to culminate in a thoroughly disappointing outing. The proof of my disappointment is the review itself. I normally don't bother, but I had to set the record straight on a site where Arsalan has a lower review than this joint! The length of this post is also an indication of my feelings, again, something I don't bother going so extensively over on any website.
I couldn't bear to give their pastries a shot, and maybe that was wrong of me. Maybe they do have a signature dish, and the teas are worth having, but I wasn't going to be a guinea pig for that after what I experienced - forgive me. Post experience, this place is all pomp and no glory, a facade of what should have been, and is not. A mockery of a cafe, at least, by any standard of what one should be. I have given it a 2 star rating because it does have a certain ambience and air to it, and their pastries may indeed be excellent (I've given it the benefit of doubt and assumed that they are very good). But for what I tried, it's a zero (and good coffee IS something they should have), and so in all honesty, I cannot rate it higher. Neither filled with students, nor intellectuals, Flury's might have a tough time lasting on for future generations if all they have to go by is their legacy, which falls seriously short for this reviewer in light of reality.

Legend of sorts.Try the old-fashioned English Tea Sandwiches or a typical Flurys Breakfast with Ham and Cheese-stuffed Omelette and Beans on Toast. And don't miss their Chicken Patties!Chef's Special menu has highlights like soups, Caesar Salad, sandwich meals, grills and pastas of your choice. Ask for the dessert tray: it's an assortment of Rum Balls, Fresh Butter Pastries and the Flurys famous Dry Pastries. And if you are a visitor to the city, do pick up some cookies, nougatine chocolates, Almond Horse Shoe, Baba Cakes and Chocolate Boats for folks back home.Ideal place to hangout during the christmas or new year!!!

The Times foodie award winner, a relic of the colonial past of Kolkata, a labour of love by eminent journalist Bachi Karkaria - a book in its honor. What can be said about this pillar of Park Street. Here's my breakdown:

Cons:
1. The restaurant underwent some management changes 5 years back and the menu seems to have become more Indian and shed its colonial ways
2. In tandem with Kolkata english, beware, 'grilled' means deep deep deep fried, soaking and dripping in trans fat oil
3. The italian and 'western' sandwiches are cooked indian style with caramelised indian fried onions, ginger garlic paste, garam masala, turmeric, and the whole hog
4. Therefore I stay away from the 'western' menu and stick with the bakery goods only
5. The highly priced fruit juices are all canned, and not a single juice is fresh

Pros:
1. Good tea / coffee service
2. Best cakes and breads
3. Great ambience

There are more than just a few reasons why Flury's is an iconic tea house in the city. Not only that it has literally been serving this foodie community with fine confection and a hearty English Breakfast for five generations now; but it has been doing it with great sophistication and quality. 
Right from the fish tank, the chandeliers and the enormous cakes they always have on display...to their Viennese Coffee, Chocolate boats and club sandwiches; Flury's has never failed to charm its patrons. 
With a perfect laid-back setting, their wholesome meals and a view of the busy Park Street, step into Flury's for that typical"Babu" experience.

Staying just down the road, was a favorite on sundays, when lazily get up, wander down the road, pickup magazines & then settle down in the flury's (was not as plush as the renovated one) but lovely omlettes, thick slices of bread; shakes, coffee, & on the way out pick up some veg pattice; cakes....

And some day when it was raining, just sit & watch park street going by!!! Ah those were the days.

It is almost impossible to miss this eatery on Park Street with its tall glass windows through which you can see the entire restaurant. While the interiors have undergone a facelift, their pastries and teas thankfully remain the same. Their All-Day Breakfast is still a hot favourite. They have teatime snacks, cakes and sandwiches galore, which is why the place is always teeming with people. There's a lunch menu available too, with a delicious mix of Indian and Continental fare, where each item is a full meal in itself. If you need something sweet after your meal, you know you're in the right place!It has got some really nice pastas on offer. I personally love their Lasagna. Service is usually a little slow but the food usually makes up for it. Don't leave once your done with your meal. Go to the pastry counter and try their wide selection of pastries. They are the ones you have heard of but really tasty. You can pack some too to take back home.
