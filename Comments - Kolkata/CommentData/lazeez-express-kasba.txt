The restaurant is quite good the chicken rashmi butter masala was really good even though it was different in taste. I loved the taste it was not like the other places. We ordered paratha also it was good. The prices were quite reasonable. If you wanna visit the restaurant with your own car then you might face parking problem as the restaurant is just beside a signal.

Had ordered Mutton Rogan Josh and Peas Pulao online, a while back. 
Had asked for napkins and a spoon and a fork, which went unheard.
The gravy had sploshed around quite a bit because of which it spilt out of the container and coated the inside of the plastic bag and due to this, the pulao packet got soaked. 
Opening the Mutton container, the first thing I noticed was the amount of oil! I could literally have cooked a second dish with the amount of excess oil that was floating in the container. So unhealthy! Received 2 pieces of mutton, which were alright, although one boneless piece was very chewy. The dish was ok, nothing too great.
The peas pulao was given in ample quantity, no complaints there. But taste wise it was a disappointment. It felt like they just tossed in some handful of peas with rice and oil. Didn't like it at all. There was a raw coriander garnishing, which totally destroyed the taste. Refrain from adding coriander garnishing unnecessarily.  
Food is decent, decent pricing. Okay experience. You can give it a try.

Food here is reasonably priced. The ambience is warm and really like any other good restaurant, not including the posh ones. The decor is simple but on point. On to some foods that deserve mention, positively or otherwise.
Chicken tikka butter masala - Very satisfying. Gravy is tasty, chicken cooked and marinated well. Recommended.
Keema naan- Hardly any keema. Literally. We thought the'd delivered a wrong item until we found some granules of what was supposed to be 'keema'
biriyani - Rice is a bit tough, not enough spice to bring out that colour or that aroma. Not something I'll have again.
Lazeez special chicken cheese kebab- Recommended. 
Eat here for their various chicken curries. Most of them will have you coming back for more.

1. Delivery took nearly 2 hours.
2. Mutton was not cooked properly, moreover, the gravy turned into a semi solid form in room temperature after 15 mins. Clearly not made of refined oil or ghee.
3. Biriyani tasted excessively salty.
Not recommended and not worth the money.

Visited this particular Lazeez outlet on the night of Ashthami this year when it was steeming with people. Ordered a chicken biryani for myself and butter naan with tandoori chicken and kawsha mutton to go with. Biryani was a little above the average one we have as per taste. Quantity was less in comparison to its price , please note that there was no egg and the singular chicken piece didn't seem as succulent and fresh as it should have been. The naan was alright. Quality was greatly compromised, I felt, with the mutton. It was nowhere near the authentic mutton curry the Bengalis are so fond of and used to having. As plain and bland as it could be. Tandoori chicken was a takeaway. The waiter specified that the green chutney and salad is given along with it. After opening the parcel, I find there is no chutney and by salad, they had given onions only (giving out smells) and a piece of lemon. The tandoori chicken was just about okay and nothing beyond the average one. Packaging was okay and the staff well-behaved.

Went during the pujas for lunch. Service time was long may be for that reason. Ordered butter nun, chicken tikka butter masala and mutton pasinda. All the dishes were really yummy. Then we thought of ordering mutton biriyani and surprisingly the mutton was stale. On raising the issue, they changed it and gave chicken biriyani instead. That was the only sad point about our visit. We ended up with firni, which was also good in taste. Quite reasonably price and staff was well behaved.

An online order was placed on this restaurant on 20th August. The order comprised of Reshmi Kabab and Chicken Tangdi. The Chicken Tangdi was shockingly smelling of ROTTEN chicken. This chicken was invariably stale and would not have passed the food quality standards of the Government. 
1. It was stale

2. It was smelling with the utmost stench of rotten chicken

3. It has to be either a rotten chicken or unwashed rotten blood which have emanated that stench

It is unfortunate that I am served with food which in any way would not have passed the food quality standards of the Government. The odd part, they market Chicken Tangdi as their best seller on some other food aggregator web sites !!!

If you ever visit this outlet and try to have biriyani check it properly as while having a chicken biriyani today i have seen a long woman's hair well cooked with the chicken. When i asked the waiter to show it to the manager he came back and gave back the plate by removing the hair from the chicken.. this kind of service was not expected from a restaurant like lazeez.the manager explained to me that as chicken and mutton was cooked together the hair of mutton got stuck with chciken and spole in a way as it is a normal thing...
I hope the management takes a close look... but i doubt if at all the management pays any heed to such posts..

Worst experience ever. From zomato i got one complementary item , but during delivery that was not there.  Also fish kabab contains grevy, which was tough to realize and eat. Also the butter nun, its pre baked, 40% of each butter nun got wasted. The chicken bharta was so.so, but my recomendation, never order this bharta from lazeez, because its kind a shit with lots of gaRam masala and nothing  without lots of grevy and big chicken piece. Our luch was turned in to a mess and waste of money because of lazzez. We are fasting because of this, thanks.

This place primarily serves North Indian food. 
We had ordered 1 plate of butter chicken
1 plate of Mutton Rogan Josh and 2 butter naan. 
The chicken was similar to any other joint in town (at this price range). The peices were cooked perfectly and the gravy did have a nice taste. 
The Rogan Josh was average. The base/gravy was nothing special. I've had better.
The naan was a bit thick but the good thing was it was laden with butter. 
Overall a nice experience. Maybe worth a visit( though I could suggest other places which charge almost the same price, maybe a little more)
Happy dining

It was a spontaneous decision to go to this restaurant for dinner. We were four. The place is very close to my home so we walked down and reached the restaurant bit early than the usual dinner time. The restaurant was almost empty. 
We took the sofa arrangement and place is not very big but looks spacious and clean. Lighting is also adequate. Sitting was comfortable, 
Even being part of the Shiraz group the restaurant offers limited choice in Mughlai cuisine. 
We ordered Chicken Tangri Kabab 4 piece costed RS 220. The pieces were moderately large and the tandoor was done with perfection. The salad provided was fresh and the chicken was well spiced. The mint chutney was however runny but tasted nice. 
Next we ordered Tandoori Roti and Mutton keema. Tandoori Roti costs 15 Per piece and Mutton keema RS 120 Per plate, Mutton biriyani with egg costed 170+10 RS 10 for the egg. 
The briyani not not like you have in Shiraz. It's bit inferior in quality and taste. The Mutton piece was moderately large. The briyani did not have that classic aroma but the flavour was good and light on the stamach. The rice was not greasy. The Tandoori rotis were fluffy and hot large in size and tasted wonderful on their own. The Mutton keema was excellent too. The combination of keema and Tandoori Roti was brilliant. 

The total bill was RS 1115 out of which rs 190 was tax. Overall it was a nice meal and it is a place to have good if not great Mughlai food in a good environment with loved ones. It's a must try if you live live close by and want family eating out.

I have eaten atleast a dozen times in this restaurant. It's a shame how it has deteriorated in its overall service. Taste is ok for some dishes like vegetables jhalfrazi, paneer butter masala, firni, but as for most others it's just sad. I loved it's mutton Boti kebab , and chicken tikka butter masala before, and now yesterday I had these dishes for the second time in last 3 months and the taste and quantity forced me to write this review. Well the chicken was simply stale, and portion is just enough for one person. They must must do something about their cook or else we will not find this restaurant in kasba in the future. There are atleast 20 restaurants in this locality who are providing better service.

Located near the triparno bus stand.  
Lazeez is one of the places with good biryani. 

It has many joints all over the city.
The particular joint i had the chicken biryani,  which was good but not upto the quality.  
Chicken was stiff and not tender. 

I like the food of the place but recently the food is not something to have a regular visit specially having options nearby.

The menu primarily consisted of North Indian and Mughlai delicacies. We went with Mughlai and ordered for mutton biryani, chicken reshmi kebab, and chicken bharta. Mutton biryani simply didn’t have the taste and flavor you would expect from it! The size of the potato in the biryani was also quite negligible. On the other hand, the chicken bharta was too spicy to our liking, and the pieces of chicken reshmi kebab were too dry and hard to digest at the same time. They took a lot of time to serve these items as well. So, overall, it was quite a bitter experience! Not recommended

There is no doubt / 2nd choice about enjoying Biriyani except in Lazeez Express. Be it kebabs / mutton Biriyani/ kulcha; Lazeez is the name comes to my mind. I have visited this place multiple times and get my favorite Biriyani here.

Staffs are very cordial ,they give suggestion upon your choice as well..
Home delivery service is good too. Foods are delivered fast and well packed 

Enjoy here if you people have not experienced it yet

The ambience is beautiful and noteworthy. The restaurant has earned a name for it considering it’s a brand from Shiraz.

The staff are well behaved and helpful.

It's a decent place for kebabs. Biryani and side dishes aren't that good considering the name it has earned in people0's mind. The biryani was pretty average considering what I had heard from people I believed it to be special.

Loss of money and even couldn't have dinner. This restaurant should be sued and that's exactly what I'm planning to do. Absolute cheats who took the money but didn't deliver the food. Please avoid any sort of service from this chain of restaurant.

disappointing experience
1. The waiters in the restaurants behaves as if they r the owners n they r doing a great favour on us by serving us the food. The waiters were not dressed properly or rather should i say they were dressed up like the tea stall owners. Their uniforms were dirty and they were execively rude. When i entered the restaurant the a.c was not on..my friend politely requested one of the waiter to turn the ac on...at first we were completely ignored. Then i asked them again for the same and one of the waiters said or rather should i say shouted at us by saying " its early of december and no one asks for an ac"....
Hearing this  my friend and i left the place immediately. And the waiters were completely okay with it and the person sitting on the counter (might b the accountant) was busy with his phone all the time.
I would advice people never to visit the place.

ordered chicken biryani & mutton shami kebab. To begin with biryani , i don't know what was wrong , but it did not reach upto  expectations , the very flavour which makes biryani a mouth watering dish was absent , devoid of 'spices' which is so very essential for it to taste good ; & to add to it , they forgot to include the potato in one of the packets -_-
coming to the shami kebab , again i don't know what went wrong , it tasted like they burnt it completely & a bit sour , for which they claimed the quantity of curd used was bit more than the usual ( might be ).
If you want to order from here , best of luck , who knows the quality might improve! :p

During Pujas eating out in odd hours becomes inseparable from one's habit.
Satisfying the hunger and taste buds is a habit of a good cook.
Lazeez seems to be in midway.
The menu got reduced to only Biryani, Chicken Kadhai & Veg Salad when we asked for something else. That's pretty awful when you want to try something different than these 'staple diet of festivities'. Unfortunately, that didn't happen.
Got to try on regular days. The food was just up to the standard, but not exceptional. Can't say money's worth, yet.

Ordered food online through zomato itself but it takes around 1and half hour to be delivered at a distance of 1-2 km. So a little thumb down for zomato and lazeez both. Now considering food quality i will give it a double thumbs down coz they are detariorating their fame by delivering such bad food. Biriyani for which they are famous for is not too good compared to aminia and alibaba. Overall not a satisfactory one.

Not a fan of Biryani but Lazeez changed my mind. Gave order for home delivery and got it within 20 mins hot & fresh. Their Biryani doesn't have strong aroma which make the taste of biriyani far better then others. Will recommend everyone to have Biryani from Lazeez which kept the name of Shiraz high. Looking forward to have Biryani again from there.

Did not physically visit the place, but ordered biriyani last sunday from this place around 9 pm and got delivered by 10. Delivery was quick, we ordered 2 chicken and 2 mutton biryani for 4 of us.
The quantity of rice was good for one person, the potato quite big enough and to my surprise the chicken was soft too. My friends having the mutton pieces also said that it was soft.
It was good experience, would be looking forward to visit this place soon.

The most third graded experience with Lazeez express. Ordered 5 tandoori roti in dinner for two people at home however received 5 romali roti. When called the restaurant get to know the billing person did a mistake. As a result me and wife had to struggle with half food for tonight. They were saying they will be replacing the food/adding 5 roties extra, which mean I had fight with hunger for another 30 minutes to 60 minutes. 
Also the quality of mutton kassa was worst. Total wastage of money.
expecting more responsibility from Lazeez express.

Lazeez is a frequent choice whenever I order food from outside. They make really tasty kebabs. Chicken Achari Kebab, Chicken Kasturi kebab, Chicken Tikka Kebab, Lazeez Special Chicken Cheese Kebab... These are my favourites from Lazeez Express. Being a kebab lover I would love to say nobody in this area can compete with them in this field. My next choice from Lazzez is their Peas Polao. It really tastes good. I don't like the Birriyani that much though. They are very prompt about Home Delivery. Serves really fast. 

Apart from these THANK YOU Lazeez for being the best way out in my mood swings. Thank You for coming up with your wonderful kebabs at my times of distress. :D

1. Ambience & Decor:
Its a mid sized restaurant nice for casual dining. Fast food are also available. Not much of a thing to comment about! average (2.5/5)

2. Service & Conduct :
Service is good but not the best could improve a lot ! At least waiters can be groomed to serve with a smile. ;-)  Why so serious??? (2.5/5)

3. Delicacy :
Food is up to the mark or a bit more up the mark than the place looks. Even though a bit rich still you would love the mouth watering kebabs. The biriyani was over whelming. A perfect Mughalian delight. The firni was with a lot of finesse just the right amount of  sweetness to call it a perfect desert. All's "Delicious" that's ends with "Sweetness" - (3.0/5).

4. Value to Cost ratio :
Not at all expensive. Meets the standards in a low cost budget. Very hygienic too! (4.0/5) 

5. Over All :
3.0/5 - just the average ! Lots of scopes to improve.
I will definitely recommend this place!Try it out ... ! Happie dining!

Have ordered food from here on multiple occasions. I do not like to experiment a lot while ordering from here and basically stick to the tried and "tasted". My favourite dishes are the Chicken and Mutton Biriyanis they offer, the mutton and chicken chanp. Am a big fan of their Reshmi kebabs and the Achari kebabs. One perennial favourite, which we always ( and I mean ALWAYS) order is the Lazeez special Chicken Cheese kebabs......juicy and delectable and too good to resist. Amongst the sweet dishes....I have tasted their Zafrani firnis and they indeed are excellent.
Price of the dishes, considering the quality and quantity served, seems very reasonable.... especially again when compared to the other competing big names in the market.
Never been to the place in person so will not be able to throw light on the in house service....but the home delivery service is prompt and the food is delivered on time.
Reliable place to fall back on whenever in need of some good food.

Well, I have been a frequent visitor at this place not because of its awesome food but because of its locational advantage. Situated right next to my house in the upscale locality of Tribarna, overall I would say this place to be okay! I have had numerous experiences here! I would say the best things to order are Biriyanis and Murgh Musallam! Though the biriyani is nice, but the quantity has decreased over the years! You need to order prior to have a Murgh Musallam! So if you plan to have one, call up Lazeez in the morning and inform them about your evening visit! Try it, it's nice! Happy Eating!

I had heard a lot about the biriyani of Lazeez, but I decided to go down a slightly different route. Using Zomato, I ordered mutton haleem to take advantage of the festive season, along with tandoor rotis and palang paneer. A few minutes after placing the order, I received a call to inform that palang was was unavailable, so I went with paneer batter masala. The items arrived right exactly at the time I was promised. The paneer was quite good, though my family members all had a different opinion on it, because of the tough of sweetness. I do not like sweet in my dishes, and yet, I thought it was well balanced. But we all agreed that it was delicious. The problem was that it was too less in quantity. The haleem had a huge quality of gravy, but there were only a few small pieces of meat. I am glad that I had ordered two plates of the haleem. The gravy was also thick and covered the meat pieces perfectly,with a great balance of flavors and seasoning. The occasional bites into tiny pieces of green chilli made the dosh even more special, without making it dangerously spicy. The rotis were a big disappointment. The were hard and leathery, especially in the centre, where the bread had to be literally broken like a pappad instead of being torn. Since I ordered in, there isn't anything I can say about the ambience or interiors, even though the decor has always impressed me from the outside. The dinner was easy on the pockets and heavy on the stomach. I'll like to eat here again, and hope things will be a little better.

One of my friends took us out for lunch on his birthday to this outlet of Lazeez. It is located at Kasba, falls on the right hand side when you are going from Ruby to Gariahat. It is a small place, cannot accommodate a big crowd. However it is very neatly done ( the walls are painted red) and well lit. The seats are cushioned and comfortable. My friend had previously made reservations so we had no issues getting a table. We were a group of 12 people. When we reached apart from us there was just another table that was occupied. Now coming to the staff, I have never in my life witnessed any place where the staff was this clueless. They had no idea about the specialities, what was available etc and kept going inside the pantry for confirmation before giving us a reply. The service was SLOW. Took them 45 minutes to serve starters alone. The food tasted fine but the service was so slow that by the time one would order an extra Naan and it would arrive, one would have had finished the side dish by then. The kababs here are really good though. The biryani , chicken butter masala, paneer butter masala, dal makhni, tandoori chicken...taste wise was decent. No complaints there. One of my friends had a heated exchange of words with the manager as he was extremely rude to him for no reason whatsoever. The management is haywire in this place, had that been in control the place would have done much better.

Ambience is a big plus for this Lazeez outlet. The experts of Mughlai dishes. Visited here quite a few times with friends and family and was never disappointed.

#Location: Tribarna Bus Stand, E M Bypass

#Decor: A mid-sized restaurant, minimalistic interiors with neatly placed red colored furniture. .Only problem is kitchen is semi-open and I feel all the dust from the road and the moving vehicles may contaminate the food. 

#Service: Staff are always welcoming and helpful. Food takes average time to come to the table 

#Food : 
Their roll counter is outside, for take away. While slightly over priced  they definitely make better rolls than their competitions at tribarna.
Their also provide home delivery using online apps, or on their own.
They excel in punjabi dishes. Their kababs are nice. I love their chicken side dishes - bharta, lababdar, butter masala, bhoona. Biryani is also mediocre. Since this restaurant is walking distance from my place, combining dine in and delivery, I have had most of the items on their menu.

This branch of the Lazeez Express is located right opposite to the Zoom Studio at Triborno Bus Stand. This outlet generally plays our go to place for rolls. We have stumbled over occasional Biriyanis, but it has not been able to live up to our expectations, any which way. The keora and rose water is little too strong for my liking and that puts a stop to my Biriyani gorging at this outlet. The rolls on the other hand are impressive. My usual order is the chicken roll.

We ordered for home delivery here...chicken biriyani,nan,chicken tikka kabab and one paneer item we had. 😊 Their service was real quick..and friendly behaviour of the staffs pleased us. As for the food..I just loved their kababs, the biriyani was good..less oily and flavourful. The paneer dsah was yummy and delicious..loved every bit of it. Price was also reasonable. So overall a thumbs up. 👍

We did a home delivery and regretted it from the first bite...We ordered Special chicken biriyani, the only thing special was an extra piece of chicken ,taste wise it was simply ordinary nothing great,yes quantity wise it was good along with Dal tadka fauladi,Naan rotis and Chicken bharta. The dal tadka fauladi has nothing fauladi in it,instead it had too much salt ,rotis were basic. The Chicken bharta didnt have shredded chicken which is a normal procedure and the tasted very much like chicken curry overdone and not bharta at all The saving grace was the firni which was good otherwise hated every part of the meal and regretted ordering from here.Would suggest only order when in dire need

Located at a 5mins distance from Acropolis mall. This lazeez has sitting arrangement unlike some others, and is a good place for foodies. We went in a group of 8, and everyone appreciated the food which was quite tasty. We ordered lazeez lababdar, chicken biriyani, kadai chicken, lacha paratha, butter roti, and everything tasted really gd, if u compare the biriyani with some veteran biriyani stores thn it might be a tad less gd, but its fine, but the chicken dishes are good.Only con I found is that the chicken portions are small, and the pieces are better in other mughlai hotels with similar prices. We received a 15% discount due to solaitire club card, and would recommend other people to give it a visit for frnds get together. They also a serve a combo dish of rs250 having 1 chicken biriyani, 1 chicken side dish, 1 firni/cold drink, salad.

Since it's near my school, I used to have food from it quite frequently. The food combos there are worth its price. Biryani quality is good. The side dish was Chicken Indian Kassa which was also good but lacked the spicy taste. It's a good place to have Biryani when your budget is low. Kebabs were okayish. The disappointment for me was the Firni. It did not actually taste like a Firni to me, rather tasted like Mishti Doi.

My first venture with Lazeez was at Koramangla, Bangalore and ever since then I had been a real admirer to this brand. Although their quality has degraded substantially, some of their products are still worth trying. Dropped in here one day and ordered for a Cheese Kebab to have a quick bite.

The Kebabs were filling. Decently sized Reshmi Kebabs, grilled to perfection and with cheese on top. A sheer treat to the tastebuds. The pricing wasn't exorbitantly high and proved to be a value for money.

It was a one time experience I had with this place and I swear to never again order food from here. The place and the staff is absolutely careless, with regard to their delivery time, professionalism, and behavior. The food that was supposed to arrive within 45 min (as mentioned in their zomato profile), came as late as two hours in a form which doesn't really appeal to u! And when one tries to talk to their staff regarding this,  bad behavior and nasty attitude is what you get in return with people saying things like, " Its your responsibility if you ordered food from us, it was your choice to order food at such a time. Not our fault." 
An otherwise regular user of zomato, I'd advice people against thinking twice before ordering from this particular joint. 
And Lazeez Express, good name and reputation comes with a price for maintaining it. Dont let it go down the drain because of some untrained irresponsible staff.

DO NOT EVER TAKE DELIVERY FROM LAZEEZ EXPRESS. I REPEAT. NOT EVER.

I'd ordered lunch at 12:33 today. It's now 3:00. I have not received it yet. I've spoken to the cashier at the restaurant, the manager, as well as zomato. Everybody tells me that they're checking up with the others, of course, to no avail. And then very helpfully Zomato offers to cancel the order, and here I am with no food at home. 

Edit: Received the food, finally, at 3:10pm. It was decent, like it usually is, only rather cold from all of its travels across the city. They'd also sent firni to make up for the delay.

Updated review [8.03.2016].
After a tiring trip to Science city 6 of us hurried to Lazeez since we were quite hungry and Sanjha Chulha seemed to be too crowded. We entered Lazeez at around 1:00pm and found only 2 tables occupied. The ambience is calm and quiet with red sofas which I found to be uncomfortable because its way too much wobbly but, that chairs are of the right height and quite comfortable. The lighting has been done serenely and the colours red and bright golden from the lights complement each other well.

The servers were nice and the restaurant manager was prompt with whatever we asked.

We started of with the follows;

1)Chicken Cheese Kebab or Lazeez special kebab @Rs.260 (4.5/5)(1 portion) : When we decided about having our lunch at Lazeez, I knew what I wanted to have for sure! The chicken cheese kebab served here is one the best in the city and yes, it beats the one served at Arsalan. 6 pieces of soft reshmi kebabs topped with well tandoor-ed and melted cheese. The texture is mouth melting and, the cheese is delicious. People not being able to tolerate cheese must stay away from this dish.

2)Fish tikka @Rs.215.00 (3/5), (1 portion) : We were served with 4 pieces of well charred and beautiful fish kebabs. The spices were right on spot but I was disappointed with the quality of fish. I dont think we were served with kebabs made of bhetki. According to me, it was bhola bhetki inside but I might be wrong.

The also served green chutneys along with this. Green chutney is a concoction of curd, coriander, chillies and mint. The chutney was oh-so-good! Tasted excellent.

Next, we moved on to the main course.

3)Chicken Biryani @Rs.160 (3.7/5), (2 portions) : The thing I love about Lazeez is that, the biryani they make contains less oil as compared to the other biryani serving places. The chicken pieces were decent in size and were well cooked, hence pretty soft. The potatoes were not cooked properly and it was difficult to cut them through with a fork. The potatoes, also had no flavour in them and that made me almost cry. However, you cannot really compare this one with Arsalan. Biryanis from Arsalan is love!

4) Mutton Biryani @Rs.175 (2.8/5), 3 portions : The rice was flavourful with independent grains of rice (same as the chicken biryani). The potatoes were again, not cooked properly. Now the worst part of the biryani was the mutton. It was tough and we literally had to tear it with our teeth. On complaining about it to the restaurant manager he said he would look into the matter. However, the mutton biryani I had asked them to parcel at the beginning had the same problem with the mutton. Disappointed again.-0.5 for this.

5)Chicken tikka butter masala @Rs.215.00 (3.75/5), Oredered- 1 full portion : The chicken tikka butter masala was excellent with 6 well charred chicken kebabs/tikkas doused in succulent, spicy and amazing gravy! Too oily but then what is 'Chicken tikka butter masala' without butter, cream and oil?

6) Chicken Bharta @Rs.170.00, (3.0/5), Oredered - 1 full portion: Tasted average. The gravy was sweetish with a little hint of spicyness. Shredded chicken pieces were ample in quantity. Topped with half a portion of boiled egg.

7) Butter Naan @Rs.45 per piece, (4/5), Oredered - 2 portions : The naan was soft and generously brushed with butter and obviously went amazingly well with the chicken tikka butter masala.

8) Zafrani Frini @Rs.60/portion, (4.5/5), Oredered : 5 portions :
Now, who misses on a firni or a shahi tukda at a mughlai restaurant? But alas, Shahi tukda was not available.
So we went for the firni. I was a bit skeptical about ordering it because I am a dedicated fan of the firni served at Arsalan, any given day. But, man! Was I impressed! It was at par with the one at Arsalan. Loved it too bits. We started with one portion but ended up oredering 5 of them.

All of the above food items were washed down with 2 bottles of Coca Cola (600ml bottles) @Rs.50.00.

The total bill came to Rs.2361.00 after adding a service tax for 5.8% (I.e. Rs.130).
They made a small mistake in the bill which they changed happily! For each person, the bill came upto Rs.393.50 which is quite reasonable, too.
I am happy with their service and they have indeed improved the food quality over time. :)

Recommended for any casual dinner. :)
Happy eating.✌🏻

Visited this restaurant on 28th February 2016 with my friends. We were 6 in no .
Ambiance was quite nice and the restaurant was spic and span. The staff were courteous and well mannered.
Coming to the main course, we ordered 3 Mutton Biriyani .2 chicken biriyani ,2 butter nun,1 chicken tikka  butter masala .Coming to the starters , We ordered chicken cheese tikka kebab and fish tikka kebab.
The quality of biriyani was excellent and the amount enough to fill one's appetite. The taste was fine too and less oily. Only the mutton piece was not up to the mark .The mutton pieces were not cooked properly .However overall it was good.
Coming to the desert ,we ordered 4 zafrani firni  .Lastly we ordered 2 soft drinks.
Overall a fine dining experience.

Last Sunday, my friends and I visited this place for having lunch. The restaurant was a bit small in space, but clean and the seats were quite cosy. The staff attended us nicely. The dishes ordered by us as appetisers were :

1. Chicken cheese kebab - was'nt sure about the dish but it's authentic taste totally changed my mind. 6 pieces of chicken tenderly prepared in the oven with a cheesy crust. Simply amazing. I would give it a 4.3.

2. Fish tikka - well not as tasty as the chicken. The fish fillet had an odd odour which we realised while eating. But they were still well cooked with balanced level of spices. I would give it not more than 3.5 just for the smell.

The main course included :

1. Chicken biriyani - tasted this dish in many places but this one was quite satisfactory. It had a pleasant aroma, great texture and was'nt overfilled with spices. This one also had adequate quantity. I would give it 4.0.

2. Chicken tikka butter masala - my most favourite dish and it fulfilled my satisfaction. Big chunks of tender chicken with rich smoky tandoori gravy. Nothing to say about it. Not less than 4.5 to me.

3. Mutton biriyani - the most disappointing dish. I had doubt whether it was mutton or any other meat. It had a queer taste, smell and the meat piece was not properly cooked. Hope this would be improved. A poor 2.8.

4. Chicken bharta - good in taste, having moderate spices this was a good dish. The shredded chicken pieces were well mixed with spices. 👍. A 3.6 rating to me.

5. Butter nan - each had 2 pieces well brushed with butter and was served hot. I would give it 3.8.

The desserts included -

1. Firni - hadn' t eaten it for a long time. It was totally good. Cold malai desert served in an earthen plate, it finished my appetite sweetly. I would give it 4.0.

Beware of the delivery boys of this place. They are out to cheat people. Our home delivery bill was 510/- . I had stepped out of home for some work, my mother was there to take the delivery. She gave the delivery boy 500/- and went inside to bring the remaining change. Coming back she was in for a shock!! The delivery boy denied about receiving any money. They had an argument, finally my mother gave in. So we had to pay 1010/- for a bill of 510/-.. I called up the restaurant and reported the incident. They said they will get back to us. We are still awaiting for their response (which am sure will never come)

One of the most stupid and cheeky attepmts at identity theft attempted by Shiraz. The original lazeez at elgin chowringhee crossing serves so much better food. Lazeez express on the other hand belongs to the shiraz group and they wanted to utilize the goodwill of the original one. However they have failed miserably in their attempt. Sub standard food with a poor waiting staff. Shame on you Shiraz.

Just Now bought a mutton Biriyani ( take Away). As Lazeez is just 2 min from my home. Opened the pack to find a rotten smell coming out. The food was stale. Please avoid food from this restaurant as this is not the first time.

Home delivery or take away would be a better option. The Chicken Biryani was cooked fine but tasted a bit blunt. Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala was delicious, that is a must if you ever plan to visit.

The most worst biriyani i ever had on 25th december 2015. I have paid 170 rupees for special masala biriyani but its taste like normal biriyani. I even call the outlet about the masala biriyani but they informed that its taste like simple only. I would rather say the local street biriyani are most tasty than lazeez biriyani.

I liked their food. Specially that normal chicken biryani. And definitely mutton kima was good too.

But what is wrong is. When I ordered first that special chicken biryani dish. That time one of the waiters says, don't go for this it test bad compare to the normal. I mean wtf! ... Then I place the normal chicken biryani in order list. And it was good.

My experience at Lazeez was not at all good. We went there at 9.30 in order to have dinner. On entering, the decor impressed us and the sitting arrangement as well. However, when it came to ordering the food, most of the items were finished and they gave us the choice of few items that were still left. We ordered Mutton Rezala, Chicken Bharta and Butter Nan. The meat dishes tasted very bland and the pieces of meat were sub-standard. It was obvious that we were served whatever bones were left in the kitchen. The Nan tasted decent enough. This was not the end, we had packed a mutton dish for home and on reaching home we found that the two pieces of mutton were nothing but fat and bone and we had to throw it away. The restaurant has disappointed us big time with their awful quality. If you do not have serviceable food in the kitchen then it should be told to the diner and they should not duped like Lazeez had done. A bad dining experience and a place I will never visit again.

Staff members say there is Chicken Biryani and the next moment sorry sir only Mutton Biryani.
Ordered Chicken Cheese Kebab it was cold and tasted totally stale types. Mutton Biryani was a disaster even roadside Biryani stalls are better than this type of unhygienic food.

Visited this restaurant during Durga Puja on Shasthi Evening with friends.
Ambiance was quite nice and the restaurant was spic and span. The staff were courteous and well mannered.
Coming to the food we ordered Mutton Biriyani and Mutton Kasa.
The quality of biriyani was excellent and the amount enough to fill one's appetite. The taste was fine too and less oily. Only the mutton pieces was not up to my satisfaction. I have found far better mutton pieces in several well known food joints in Kolkata. However overall it was good.
Now coming to the Mutton kasa it was absolutely yummy. It tasted delicious and one of the best I had ever tasted.
Overall a fine dining experience.

Biryani is decent and not very oily. Ambience is nice. Price is reasonable. The cheese kebab is excellent! The fish tikka kebab is also very good. Kebabs should be tried here. The side dishes are too oily. Sometimes they do serve biryani thats not very fresh (happened with me on two occasions) so they should take care of this.

I usually order food from there but recently I have a bad experience with their food. On laxmi puja day I order butter naan, navratna korma, paneer butter masala nd firni. The food is not hot and the korma is horrible.. the cook should learn how to make navratna korma and the paneer in butter masala r jus like a rubber... so bad food I never expected.. for me.. its totally a full stop...

Lazeez is a Shiraz sub brand which many of the people don't know.. This outlet is at kasba located on the main road itself... Quite spacious with decent capacity to sit inside unlike other Lazeez outlets.. Decor and ambience is good ... I went there for a quick lunch..
Food quality and taste is very good.. I liked it...
In the kebab section the chicken of cheese kebab was a bit hard but its OK.. The other items we ordered was very tasty ... Most importantly they served as very fresh dishes which is indeed a plus for them from my side... I would say they need to more professional in terms of service .. Behavior of the man said serving us was good but the approach was a little casual as many of the customer might not take easily..

This particular branch has exceptionally  oily food and bad service. It is not recommended to deviate too far from the Mughalai staples of biriyani and certain preparations of chicken/mutton. This is not the place you experiment, believe me.
The mutton boti kebab I once had the misfortune of ordering was slightly raw and had a strange stench. We couldn't eat it after  a bite or two.
The firni here was okay. But then one isn't really much picky about sweet things.

Expect heartburn though. :P

To our surprise, when we opened the same at friend place, it was stinking like hell. We could not 'taste' even a single piece and had to through the full order to dustbin. Not at all expected from a chain restaurant of such repute. I will never go back and will not recommend my friends as well. Great job Lazeez!! You have successfully lost a customer.

This place offers online ordering, online payment and home delivery to our place. Interestingly the Lazeez outlet nearby to our place is the Jadavpur one. However that outlet does not entertain online ordering. Now coming to the food and service of the Lazeez Express - Kasba. There was no problem faced in the entire process from ordering online to delivery. Turnover time was pretty prompt too. Coming to the food, we tried, butter naan, tandoori chicken, chicken chanp, mutton pasinda. No complain about the food either.

But I would reaaly suggest the restaurant authorities to bring up the quality of the food.

Been here on a rainy day..and parked my two wheeler beside their delivery vehicles right in front of the restaurant. 4 wheeler parking is a concern here.
The staff is quite friendly though quite blatantly ignorant about quite a few of their menu item preparation.
The service is as the usual mughlai restaurant.
The decor is an orangish one, I liked. The furnishing is comfortable and soothing, based on other mughlai restaurants.
Food is quite nice here. But I bet their better half Shiraz is far more nicer. I ordered stuffs like a Mutton Biriyani, Chicken Butter Masala, Tandoori roti, firni. They were adequately filling and sufficed my tastebuds.

Yesterday we had chicken reshmi kabab, chicken tikka butter masala with lacha paratha and chicken roll. I must say all the kabab item was really tasty and was very delicious. the interior decoration, ambiance and service was good. Now coming to price range its a bit high but no doubt the taste of the food will fulfill that. If you want to taste tandoor item then you must visit LAZEEZ. The thing that attracts me most is that the charcoal essence and i got it here.

The restaurant is located at a very convenient location. The only drawback is the parking facility. The food is really good specially their tandoori items and biriyani are really good.
But they should work a bit on there mutton chap as there is no flesh at all only bones. But on the other hand it should be a combination of both bones and flesh.

The ambience was preety good and prices were reasonable.. went there for dinner twice.. The kababs were good and tasty specially tandoori chicken and chicken tikka. For the main course we ordered Mutton biriyani and chicken bharta. The quantity of the biriyani is very good and its difficult for one person to have a entire plate. Foods were served on time. Overall good experience.

Once home-delivered, we found that the quality of food was terrible. The biriyani was cold, the chicken in it and in the chap was of inferior quality. The mutton roganjosh tasted awful and stale. I was shocked to find that the quality of food has fallen to such levels.

This decent eatery from the shiraz group is just opposite my house. Though i visit it quite often, it is more bcoz of the accessibility than anything else.  They always maintain good quality and serves fresh meat.  Prices are just about right.  The only thing which bothers me is the over indulgence of the staff.  They keep loitering near you and makes u feel like an examinee, they being the guarding examiners.

The interiors are in bright red/orange and black. I quite liked the bright decor with tinge of wood here and there. The service is a little slow though.

We ordered coke, chicken reshmi kebab, special mutton biriyani and  chicken bharta. For some weird reason, they brought us the starters and the main course together. Kebabs were nice and soft, no complains. The Biriyani was okay-ish but the chicken bharta had a little too much of oil.

However, quite an okay-ish place and you can visit if you are in or around Kasba. The service is sweet but slow nonetheless.

Had been there to enjoy the Sunday lunch. The place was good and can be easily located . Not so spacious but sufficient. A special note goes to Staff - They are very well Behaved. Now on the menu that we ordered -* Chicken Kasturi Kebab --- Will it was delicious !!! Tender and soft , just too good.* Mutton Biryani ( Normal Special) - Well there was nothing as such special about the Biryani, just normal. Taste was OK but served Lukewarm which killed its taste. And the big uncooked potato finished it all.*Chicken Kadai - Did not look like a normal Chicken Kadai but any ways the taste was too good. The Butter Nan was really good and looked fresh. The Zafrani Firni was good but not the best. Overall Satisfying !!!!!!!!

Fish Tandoori and Chicken Tandoori. 
Fish tandoori just awesome. 4 standard size pcs. But price little bit high around Rs. 220/- 
Chicken Tandoori little bit burn but taste sounds good, out of those burn portion.

Lazeez Express, from the house of Shiraz definitely speaks up to it's name.
Have been ordering for quite some time now and I have become a big fan of this place. Awesome food, reasonable rates, and the friendly nature of the staff has made me a big fan of this restaurant. Hence I would definitely recommend Lazeez Express to all the users.

Had been here on 11th Feb,2015. It was my Parent's Anniversary.
You can locate this place with ur gps and the map shown in Zomato.
It is a beautiful joints, not so spacious but sufficient. The staff are well behaved but reacted before understanding or paying proper attention to the full instructions. Thus, hard labor for them.
Very good ambience but the tables were too high even for a 5'11" boy(me) due to the soft and low seaters.
Ordered
Chicken Tengri Kebab(4pcs)
2 plates of Spl Mutton Biriyani
Mutton Tikka masala
Hyderabadi Chicken
One Spl Mutton Biriyani was packed and a firni along with 3pcs of the Hyderabadi Chicken we could not finish...
The chicken tengri kebab was delicious for me, but average for mom, because she did not like the sour flavour
The Biriyani was above satisfaction in taste but it was lukewarm which wasn't attractive. The mutton was soft and well cooked.
The Mutton pieces in the Tikka Masala was kind of roasted, which gave that bitter burnt taste and hard but was good.
Chicken Hyderabadi was awesome, the chicken was moist and soft inside out.
Firni was good but not the best, i've had better but the quantity was not satisfying. Total came upto Rs 1550...
Yes Khana Lazeez tha, reduction in scores due to carelessness of the staff.

DO FOLLOW ME IF YOU LIKE MY REVIEWS, I PROMISE NOT TO DISAPPOINT INTENTIONALLY. BUT AGAIN, DIFFERENT BEINGS HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS, PLEASE GO THROUGH DIFFERENT OPINIONS BEFORE COMING TO A CONCLUSION

Kolkata! 14.5% VAT! What is wrong with you? And Lazeez charging extra VAT brings the taste down by a notch. Now let me get to the point. I ordered 4 Chicken Special Biryanis and 1 Assorted Kebab Platter (10 piece). The kebabs were succulent and well marinaded except the mutton kebab, which was chewy. And the biryani. Where do I even begin. Too much hydrogenated fat (dalda or palm oil or whatever) just spoilt my apetite. It also reduced the fluffiness of the biryani. All in all, pretty horrible. And for all this, I paid Rs 1,317.

Recommended? Not one bit.

Place is a little small. Service is decent at best. Food is thankfully their best feature which is what all Calcuttans care about at the end of the day.
Try it out if you are bored of the same old Arsalans and Shirazes.

I have given a 3 rating because they serve good food, open till 11 PM (11 30 PM on occasions) and take away is really fast! Their behaviour is nice and the price is also pocket friendly. 
I like their Biriyani and Nan. I won't say they are great or serve amazing food, but they are not bad either. If you are in a hurry, just take some food on the go and eat at home. It's much better than some other take away joints near by. 

I would suggest, try chicken items with Nan or the simple biriyani. You won't be disappointed.

Lazeez Express at Tribarna Sangha, is a nice and cosy restaurant with comfortable seating arrangements. Service is good and the cuisine is moderate to good. The kababs, butter naan, chicken bharta, firni are ones I have really liked. The location of the restaurant is in my locality and I have been there many times with my family (my dad really enjoys their food). They have home delivery and take away counter from where they serve rolls (most probably those are prepared using ghee, because the flavour is very different). All in all a good restaurant to try out.

Before taking a dig at this restaurant for the obvious primal reason of 'not- upto-the- mark-food', I would like to add that I have this feeling; this train of thoughts that says that maybe I entered this outlet at the wrong time and this restaurant can offer a lot more.
Now you see, it was the evening of a not so spectacular day; I hadn't had any food and I was standing right next to this outlet. The next thing I knew, I was ordering a chicken biryani and a zafrani firni. The place was almost empty and the cutesy ambience felt good. Unfortunately, the goodness didn't touch the food. The biryani was dry and tasteless, the chicken in it uncooked and, to add to that, the potato tasted awful. Though again, I'd say that I was probably there at a wrong time.
The saviour,well was the firni. Smooth texture, right taste and nice presentation. Thoroughly enjoyed that.
If by chance you visit this one, try the kebabs or rolls. Not the biryani.
Enjoy!

Today,I had parceled one chicken biriyani and one chicken chaap from lazeez express,dhakuria.
I must say the food is not at all satisfactory.
There was Rotten smell from the biriyani and the food was not at all fresh..
I wish zomato had a negative rating star so that it could be properly rated.
Very unhappy with their service.

A decent place around the corner.
The service is not professional.
The Biriyani is very light on fats but is flavourful. I have had better, but I wouldnt really throw this biriyani way. Did I enjoy it....maybe. Value for money.....likely.

Coming to Kababs. Really a good choice. The Tangri kababs are juicy and succulent. The Kabab platter they make is quite good. 

One of the best items would be the masala kulcha. I loved the Kulchas with their chicken bharta.

Always tried takeaways here, and been disappointed, almost always. People reading my reviews already know I'm a biriyani connoisseur, tried here thrice. In all the instances, the biriyani was nowhere up to the mark. Quantity is too less in takeaways for one person, no idea about dining in. During Durga puja, the potato in biriyani was stale, almost rotten. We've found the mutton pieces undercooked twice, the rice undercooked and bland all the time. Flavour didn't remind us of biriyani anyhow. 

Tried Tandoori Chicken twice too. Though it wasn't as bad as the biriyani, not too superior either. The chicken wasn't grilled properly with raw marinade on top. 

Will try other dishes (probably!) and come back. Not expected from a 'Shiraz Hotels Limited' restaurant.

I went to Lazeez with a couple of friends with high hopes about the quality of food since it is run by the same people who run Shiraz.
I was extremely diappointed with the quality of food. The food prices are overpriced considering the quantity as well as the quality of food.
We were served a plate of salad even though we never ordered one.
The staff kept the main door open whilst the AC was on ,even after repeated requests from our side.
Never gonna give it another try.

Lazeez is a good restaurant with good ambiance inside, staffs are polite. Apart from this they serve tasty foods. We mainly ordered biryani  and we loved the amount and taste they served. Once i tried mutton rogan josh and lachha paratha. I really enjoyed the paratha it was very soft and not oily. Rogan Josh is ok ok type. This place is suitable for quick lunch or home delivery...

Better avoid!! I ordered from Lazeez Express and was highly disappointed with the quality of food. Firni was stale and it had a smell like being kept in the fridge for days. The Lazzez Express Special Cheese Chicken Kebab was the only good thing which we liked. Heard about the fish tikka but that wasnt available, for the main course we ordered biriyani and chicken bharta, bharta seemed chicken drowning in a tub of oil and to make the experience worst they brought it at 3:30 when the scheduled delivery time was 2.. Ordered using GetMyFood.com.. Overall a pathetic experience, getmyfood allowed me to order for fish tikkas and also pay for it, when i talked to the getmyfood agent for an order confirmation then they said that fish was not available and I have to order something else, I changed itr and they forced me to pay a balance of 30Rs again online and were not ready to accept a cash on delivery of 30Rs when I had already paid around 950Rs for the original order

The Biriyani was amazing, their chicken tikka butter masala was to die for and I loved the Chicken bara kabab too. They didn't have some of the items available though but it didn't matter much as everything we had there was very tasty. The best meal I had in Kolkata indeed ???? considering that I didn't have much time to explore the restaurants in the city!

This review is for the Lazeez Express branch that opened up in Behala .

First of all it was my first experience with Lazeez Express. Its more of a fast food center than a restaurant. There is not place to sit . 

We ordered 2 packets/parcel of Biriyani for take away . It was one of the worst biriyani I had ever tested. And top of it the rice was half cooked. We could not eat the whole thing. It was a horrible experience.

All the dishes were very tasty but Chicken Bara Kabab disappointed us as it gave a stale smell & taste. Overall, since we didn't had anything till 5 pm as were engaged in Pandal Hopping, we neglected the defect in one item and ate other dishes with achieving satisfaction at the end :)

Pathetic service!
Went to dine today..only a couple of tables had guests. 
Ordered a Kabab Platter as starter and 2 Tandoori Roti and a Chicken Do Pyaza for main course together.
The kabab was served within 10 minutes, tasted delicious, I was impressed.
But what followed was horrible. Once we were done, we sat patiently waiting for the main course to be served.
5minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes..still it was not served. 
Asked a couple of waiters as to how long would it take.
The causal reply was 2 minutes..which never came. 
A pizza gets delivered in 30 minutes, they could not deliver the main course in 45 minutes.
Had to pay and leave in frustration and the food had still not been delivered.
As I left disappointed, the manager apologized and said "it is not about the money"
As I came out, a guy came running outside with the food packed!
A dine in had become take away!
Very very disappointed with the service!
They were so busy taking orders for home delivery that they ignored guests sitting for food!
Never again!

Visited Lazeez for a friend's birthday treat. And let's talk about how I felt about it.
The ambience is great, well lighted. Clean and tidy.  We placed an order for starter and we were served within 5 minutes, mutton kathi kebab. The mutton tasted good and it was cooked really well, it didn't have any bad meat smell. The laccha was great, so was the chicken bharta, perfectly cooked. And we finished our awesome meal with firni. They even got hand washing bowl for us which had water and a slice of lemon. Such a brilliant service.  I would definitely recommend this place to everyone I come across. (I forgot the name of the mutton dish, sharing the picture. )

A perfect birthday treat.

This is an overall great place to visit if you got time in hand. The interiors are lovely, ambience is soothing and it's a nice quiet place. The waiters are polite, service is nice, but pretty slow though. The taste, however, is absolutely brilliant, making up well for the waiting time. Recently the prices were hiked, but the food is worth it. 

We visited this place again, leading to the increase in stars. The good just got better! They didn't make us wait for food. At all. And the quality was awesome as always. Tell me the truth lazeez people ( lol that came out wrong), do you keep a close eye on zomato? ? Hmm?? You see me don't you :O Well look real hard at this: I'll definitely revisit when I can :-) btw people, I still couldn't make my mind up about which particular dish to recommend, they all taste mind blowing!
Ps: It's better if you call them before visiting as they often do not really open at 11 a.m.

As we stay in Kasba this Lazeez outlet is very close to our apartment. Almost every month we go there once to have dinner and some time order food via phone. 

The food is so delicious. I admit that due to space crunch the interior is not that great. But for 3-4 people this place is very good. Even though they have several mouthwatering dishes in their menu, I would like to recommend "Chicken Kasturi Kebab", "Murgh Saffron Kebab" & "Chicken Tikka Kebab" as part of starters. We never missed to order "Chicken Tandoori" as that is our most favourite item at Lazeez Express. Biriyani Taste is at per with other big restaurants like "Arsalan", "Only Alibaba". In main course, sometimes we order "Lacha Paratha with Mutton Kosha" as that is also very good. Bill will not hit you hard as it cost around Rs. 700-900, per couple for a heavy dinner.

Food is really tasty. There is hardly any good Mughlai food restaurant in Kasba. Well, Lazeez fills that void.

Food is great, Quantity is good. I once ordered a chicken tikka butter masala and 2 nans. Believe me, i could finish it on my own.

I always prefer a take away for this restaurant because the place is too small to sit and eat.

Price is reasonable.

I did not like the Kababs over here at Starters, cuz i have had better.

Gravy dishes are the best.

On 12 July, a group of 10 mothers and 4 teenage daughters went to Lazeez for lunch. I had tentatively pre-ordered some of the items, saying some we would order real-time. We had ordered 4 plate Chicken Tandoori (4 piece in each plate), 5 plate Chicken Reshmi Kabab (5 pieces in each plate), 6 plate Special Chicken Biriyani (2 pieces of chicken, 1 egg, 1 potato in ecah plate), 4 plate Mutton Pasinda (shredded meat), Raita, Salad. There were two vegeterians with us who had ordered Tandoori Roti, Paneer Tikka, Peas Pulao, Veg Jalfrezi. We also had requested for ice-creams and though they do not keep them, they got them for us. And of couse some rounds of fresh lime soda and pepsi to drown the food. The pocket pinch was about Rs 7,000. 
All of these items met our high expectations, but the Mutton Pasinda and Veg Jalfrezi exceeded our expectations.
The food was very good and warm, it was served on time, the quantity was more than sufficient, the waiters were very courteous, the sitting arrangement good and spacious and separated from others and ambience quite pleasant. We were there from 2:00 PM - 5:30 PM and were quite loud, and they did not rush us out. One of us also broke a plate, and we were not charged for that. Some of us had brought some sweets and cakes and the waiters served them for us without any fuss - we were a bit surprised that they did not object to outside food. I would very highly recommend the place for small get-togethers and if you want to enjoy good food in a friendly ambience.

Had bery good food from Lazeez at a friend's place some months ago but the experience wasn't nearly as good now.  Fairly average biriyani, kebabs etc with little to distinguish it in terms of taste, aroma, flavour etc. Also the 'Cost for two = Rs 500' is highly misleading, much more likely to be at least around Rs 800/-.

Home delivery was supposed to be delivered at 2100. Came close to 2200 instead, after multiple phone calls. And all the wait for really less than average quality. Could not understand why on earth the delivery guy did not come to home directly and instead chose to wait at the Ballygunge Railway Station ticket counter!!! Disappointing and ridiculous.

The biggest USP of this place is of course the food. Biriyani is awesome - both veg and non-veg. The quantity is sufficient. Delivery is prompt and the cost is in accordance to the city - very affordable.

All in all - a good place to order food from.

A well lit interior makes even small regular eateries a very soothing to be.throw in comfy couches,wide passages,swarming waiters on the toe and you have a very hospitable establishment.lazeez can boast of this candour.
Food
Chicken tangri kebab- very well garnished.not overtly scorched and not the overbearingly spiceless deadmeat that’s the curse of tandoor joints in the city lately.the spices weave a distinct flavour of its own and you start off your meal with a glee
Tandoori roti/plain nun/butter nun- they serve it in bread baskets.no complains here either
Navratan korma-the best serve of the evening.from gravy fine cut of vegetables,it was a triumph of fine cooking and and got most of our attention and marvel.

Chicken bharta-in absence of other boneless dishes,we chose it over mutton keema.its spiced up and not very oily.if not too pompous,its atleast gullible and harmnonious with our digestive sysytem.
Special Cheese kebab-5 pieces at 230,it’s a very good choice.essentially chicken kebab with cheese topping,this one gets  your chompers eager for more. 

The one problem with the place was it’s slow service.even with 10 people in the entire restaurant,they took 40 mins to serve us the main dishes,while the starter had taken around 20 mins.anyways,a bit of proactivity on your part might curtail this waiting session.

I had gone to Lazeez with my fiance. To start with ordered for a special mutton biriyani which comes with couple of meat, one egg and potato and is sufficient for two people. The place we sat was full of flies so we thought of changing it. Wasnt a good idea coz flies were everywhere. Somehow ignored. At my utmost suprise saw a rat pass by on the floor. Biriyani was served I will call it yellow pulao rice with meat. There was no smell atall. Very dissapointed overall. Spending money to meet flies and rats inside an air conditioned resturant and to add up pathetic biriyani.

A copy of the well known Arsalan. Even the items are similar. The famous Special Arsalan Kebab, which is cheese wrapped chicken kebabs, one of the delicacies of Arsalan is replicated here as Special Lazeez Kebab... The biriyani tastes more or less same.... the mutton keema too.... There is no problem with the taste, but since it seems a copy of Arsalan with little innovation of Lazeez, the authentication of one brand is lost.

Ahhhh...one of my favourite hangout of late... Lazeez is a spin off from the very popular restaurant chain Shiraz... So you can very well expect excellent food quality and you would not be disappointed. In a very short period of time Lazeez had become one of the most popular restaurants along the RB Connector. An excellent ambience and you will always be served with a smile..
One notable thing about their Biriyani is that its very light, yet tasty nonetheless, not what we generally associate with Mughlai cuisine. Also would suggest everyone to try out Lazeez Chicken Cheese Kebab- man those are good!!!!

Yesterday we went to lazeez express as most of the other outlet was closed due to election day. We first ordered chicken reshmi kabaab, chicken biryani and chicken tikka butter masala. The reshmi kebaab was not cooked very well and we could't able to get the charcoal (tandoor) smell. Its seems its fried in normal oven and the spices inside was not tasty at all. Totally dissapointed by the quality. But chicken biryani and chicken tikka butter masala was really good but one thing the chicken kebaab in tikka butter masala was comparatively way smaller. But overall nice experience there.

I had chicken biryani and motton roghan josh--food quality and quantity was satisfactory.
the rice was good, served hot and mutton gravy had the taste of roghan josh, not just curry like most restaurants do.
They could not serve Kabab to me on that day due to huge crowd. Hope will have it next time.
The staffs were not that much cooperative regarding serving of food or other amenities,had to ask repeatedly for forks or spoons. Even had to ask them thrice to bring the bill.

Whenever I try mughlai cuisine I start with Biriyani. Lazeez was not different to that approach. Biriyani taste was good and atlast I found an alternative to Arselan or Only Alibaba. However its drenched with dalda. Live Kebab section in the take-away counter will increase your appetite further. Tandoori chicken was tasty but if go for take way will become bit hard. Always best fresh out of tandoor. Chicken Bharta went nicely with the biriyani. 
Will recommend this outlet only for take-way or home delivery. You might not like the ambiance inside is its very small and bit stuffy.
When we visited it was newly open and quiet busy. Location is very strategic on the busy Ruby connector and its a cost-effective option too.

Lazeez is located very conveniently right by the  em bypass connector eliminating all chances for anyone to miss it. Since we asked for a home delivery, i cannot comment much on the decor and ambience of this comparatively new branch but it looks somewhat cosy from the outside. Good things first. Rates are very reasonable. 400 bucks can feed two. We had mutton biryani and chicken kasha of which the chicken kasha was very less on quantity but tasted good. Biryani was good, 6.5 on 10. Nothing out of the world but tasty enough. I don't like it much when the egg in my plate of biryani is missing, and i didn't find the egg in the lazeez biryani. On the sloppy side, of the two plates of biryani that we had ordered, one was slightly slate. Nothing inedible 'cause we had finished it off within minutes but a person with a very refined sense of smell could tell them apart.

Excellent Mughlai food. Biryani is true blue Kolkata style, complete with the omnipresent potato. The mutton chop written as 'chaanp' was bit too greasy but sinfully agreeable and the kebabs were normally good. A certain boon for those who are within the home delivery zone.

was in the mood for some quick lunch and my brother was with me, hes come back to town after a few years and wanted to try some new place for Indian food . We were going back home from gariahaat and stumbled upon Lazeez express. The orange and chocolate board looked very inviting .  

We entered and ordered main course straight away and we were really hungry. The waiter said the food will be available in 10 mins and we sat down whetting our appetite. 

Our order was as follows: 

Tandoori Roti : thin , simple , crisp and delicious 
Masala kulcha : again not too heavy on the flour but thin and evenly stuffed . very light and taste 

The Vegetable Jhal frezi was delicious , I loved the fact that the beans and capsicum and green peas were still green but perfectly cooked . Impressive 

The chicken Bharta was superb too . A little too heavy but delicious , the rich creamy  gravy with the boiled egg topping was opulence in a bowl 

The Daal tadka faluladi : first of all ... BRILLIANT NAME ! It was a yello dal tadka but unlike most places it wasn't arhar dal or chana dal but moong. and each grain was perfectly cooked and not over cooked at all . with a beautiful tempering of coriander and jeera and chili. that Dal and a butter naan can take me a long way 

overall with two cold drinks our total was 570 and i think that is pretty reasonable . 

KUDOS !

With reference to bill number 25 and 26 dated 16/01/2014 at 6.22.32 P.M. On going through the home delivery menu found on zomato, I decided to order 2 portions of mutton shahi stew. On calling, I was informed that there is a misprint about the number of pieces mentioned in the menu. Surprisingly the person added that 4 pcs of mutton are served at the table for Rs. 160 whereas 2pcs of mutton are delivered for Rs.150. Much to my amazement, He said he will charge me Rs.160 for 4pcs and deliver the food. When the food arrived, they had charged me Rs. 382 and given me 2pcs of mutton per plate. On confronting the delivery man, he promised me to be back with the rest of the mutton shahi stew. Why are you cheating people like this ? Being a part of such a renonwed chain of restaurants, this was not expected of you.

Went to dine with family during July 13, food served almost 90 minutes later. As against order of 2 plates of side dish they served only one & insisted to convince us that it contains 2 plates together. Finally the chicken count saved us to proof that it was a manipulation. Horrible experience with my 2 little kids. Dining time almost 135 min.

Second incidence: Ordered home delivery, during Nov-13, combination of chicken & mutton biriyani. What got finally delivered was absolutely a wrong mix. It was regularized by them one intimated. 

Third instance Jan-14, Ordered again home delivery. Food delivered was rotten. Biriyani was having a mix of previous days left over stock. It was smelling bad. In a single call the entire lot was replaced with fresh food.

To summarise : Poor management with customer being not left a single chance to be fooled. So CAVEAT EMPTOR "Let the Buyer Beware"

Lazeez Express serves up good kebabs and rolls and I was happy to see this place open up in Kasba. Try the Mutton Shami Kebab Roll its nice and a bit different from the other rolls. I find almost all the kebabs pretty good so I usually end up ordering the Lazeez Special Assorted Kebab Platter as it gives you the variety. I have sampled and enjoyed the Mutton Stew , Mutton Chap , Mutton Passinda , Chicken Chaap and Chicken Bharta all of which are yummy. Pair it with either the Tandoori or Roomali Roti or the Mutton or Chicken Biryani for a delicious meal. The firni is a decent option for dessert. This is a sister concern of Shiraz so the food is quite good. Only remember its heavy food if you prefer a light meal stick to a kebab and tandoori or roomali roti.

This place has a very bright and lively ambiance that goes well with north Indian cuisine. The food is pretty good, but considering the very moderate pricing I would say that it would be unjust to not recommend this place. The kebabs are perfectly cooked and the charring is also appropriate. However, I have found that their main dishes lack consistency and some days turn out to be way below average. But that can definitely happen. Considering their pricing I would give this place a 4 on 5.

This restaurant is different from the other Moghlai restaurants.  Firstly I must say the kebab platter of Lazeez is really good, though a bit low on mutton side.....8 pieces of chicken and only 2 pieces of mutton.  I understand that mutton is costly than chicken but at least there should be 4 pieces if I go by conservative assumption that 4 people will share a platter....other chicken items can be shared but with only 2 mutton kebabs what you will eat and what will you share.  Pricing of the foods is normal....quality of food good....keema nan I had for the first time here, but it was just delicious.

Service part is bit slow with the stewards and QT clerks not like other professional restaurants they will give you sufficient time to select your menu (even they will go to kitchen and inquire if a particular dish could be made out).  

Need to mention about the manager of this restaurant, young guy, but he is very attentive and some issues were there with my menu and he stayed for the full duration of my dinner and made sure that everything was in order.  I really appreciate his gesture and managing the situation very tactfully and wish him success in his job profile.  

Some items are missing from the menu like burhani (ghol) which goes very well with moghlai dishes to help digest the fat in these items.  Hope this item will be available the next time I visit this place and also lack of fish dishes in the main menu.  At least one or two fish items could be incorporated so that people who are not so fond of chicken or mutton can have an alternative available.

Overall a good place for a family to have dinner and thanx to Shiraz for choosing Kasba to open an outlet which surely provides good quality moghlai food at reasonable charges.

Moreover they have now started to charge VAT on takeaway but surprisingly the bill has no VAT number, on being they were unable to provide the VAT no., this means they are fooling us or rather cheating on us. Sorry cant accept this.

Woh lovely food. The biriyani tested awesome and if you look for quantity, you wont be disappointed. The briyani was not too heavy like that of the others. Chicken reshmi butter masala was also good and the chicken was so soft, just loved it. The blend of spices and oil and other staffs were good. 
Value for money.
Just missed the egg of Biriyani rest, rest LAZAWAB.

I am not sure if anybody takes this into consideration but the table height was much above what it should be resulting in an uneasy posture while eating. Food was ok but I have had much better. Ambience was ok; service was good; bit overpriced. I am not looking forward to it anymore.

This Indian restaurant is competition for all nearby other Indian restaurants like azad hind dhaba,dhaba@kolkata and many more.Their mutton biriyani is heavenly made and finger licking taste.Though their tandoori chicken might be small as compared to other tandoori chicken but don't underestimate its taste. Their quantity of food are little less and prices are reasonable. I have  ordered their food so i don't know how does it look inside the restaurants but seeing the look from outside i think its good to go as it is always crowded . My only opinion would be to increase their quantity so that their food tastes beautiful with great quantity

The most accurate location to describe this restaurant is the bus stop of Tribarna Sangha at Kasba. Bang to the left of the bus stand is this restaurant from the institution that gave us Shiraz. I visited this place yesterday evening, and when I entered, was surprised to see that there was not a single customer there!! We inquired if they were open, and made our way inside. Though it was 9pm on a Monday evening, we had not expected to be the only ones there. However, as time passed, several customers did arrive, and the place was quite full when we left.

From the reviews on Zomato, it seemed that the Assorted Kabab Platter was the one to go for, and so we ordered that, along with Chicken Kadhai, Chicken Bharta, Laccha Paratha, Masala Kulcha, and Plain Naan. We had asked for the kababs to be served first, and they arrived within 15 minutes. The assorted platter contains 10 pieces of kabab, of 4 varieties, 2 chicken tangri kababs, 2 mutton tikka kababs, 3 chicken reshmi kababs, and 3 chicken kababs (I forgot the name), served on a bed of onion and cilantro, with green mint sauce on the side(See pictures). After being served, we dug into the wondery goodness of meat in front of us. Here I must say, that all the kababs were very tasty, had the characterestic smoky flavor and had a few burnt bits, just as I like. However, the most pleasant surprise was the Mutton Tikka Kabab, it was literally MELT IN YOUR MOUTH!! You did not even have to chew it a bit. It was a strange irony that the chefs got the mutton to be so soft when in fact, it was the chicken that appeared to be tougher than the mutton! I honestly have no explanation for this, but if this is how mutton kababs are here, I would not even think of ordering chicken and concentrate only on the mutton.

Now, the main course. The Kadhai Chicken has four pieces of chicken, in a thick gravy, and contains almost raw capsicum and tomato pieces. Tough the gravy was tasty, it is the capsicum that prevented me from thoroughly enjoying this dish. Personally I found the taste of the raw capsicum in the sauce a bit weird, even though my companion seemed to like it. Not to mention that the chicken also had bones in it. I enjoyed the Chicken Bharta much much more, shredded chicken, cooked to perfection in a sauce, with a hard boiled egg on top, and yes, bone-less!! 

The masala kulcha was the preferred bread, it was among the best I have had. And one cannot fault the laccha paratha, or the naan, because, where can you go wrong with them??

Service was the best I have experienced in any restaurant so far. The servers were very polite, very attentive and very helpful. I must also mention the person who took the order, who checked up on us from time to time, refilled our water and was prompt when we called him.

Two things I must mention here without which this review would not be complete. First, there is no washroom, or washbasin. But when I expressed the desire to wash my hands before the meal, I was given a bowl of warm water with lemon in it. I really appreciated the extra effort. Secondly, the tax!! On your bill there will be an extra 5% tax for service, and 14.5% VAT. On large bills, this can surely be a pinch on your pockets.

I had and enjoyable experience and would like to visit again, this time for the cheese kebabs. With a few minor fixes, this place could pose some serious competition to other joints like Vesselka, Kim Woh, Naushijaan etc, which are just in the vicinity.

Well well well, see what we've got another Indian cuisine restaurant in Kasba area. The restaurant adds competition to the existing Indian cuisine restaurants in the area along with AHD, Dhaba@Kolkata and more. Seeing the menu, I gave a try by ordering home delivery order so here goes my review. Also it is worth to mention that Lazeez is owned by Siraz chain of restaurants.

The food available here is no exception to the typical Indian food such as Biryani, Kebabs, Naans etc. The food is good my favorite kebab Chicken Malai Tikka Kebab is not available. Also Roomali Roti is not available in the restaurant. Nevertheless other food items such as Chicken Tandoori and Chicken Tikka Kebab are up to par with other restaurants in the area. The quality of food has not been compromised over the price and it keeps the name of Siraz.

The restaurant is somewhat budget friendly and a lot cheaper to AHD but cheats you on the quantity of the food. The quantity Biryani brought tears to my eyes. Also quantity of kebabs were 5 per plate whereas the competition offers 6 per plate in most restaurants.

Talking about the first impression, I ordered the food on a rainy day and the delivery boy was confused about my location but managed to deliver the food in 1 hr of delivery. The food was cold however. While verifying, I found that Chicken Bharta (2 plate) which I ordered were missing, but were included in the bill. I called up Lazeez in front of the delivery boy and they told that they forgot to prepare and it would be convenient for them if I would cancel that item and pay only for the delivered items. But I protested and asked them to bring the Bhartas and then only I will pay. The delivery boy brought the Bhartas after about 30 minutes.

I have not been to the restaurant for a dine-in so cant tell about the decoration and aesthetics of the restaurants but looking from outside, it looks good to go. Looking from outside however gives me an impression that the restaurant is not that large hence sitting space might be low. I really hope that the restaurant improves on quantity keeping prices near to what they have.

The food was very very good but it took them almost 40 minutes to serve the main course after the starters. Staff is friendly and the restaurant is not too expensive. Just like others said the taste and quality of the food easily compensated for the wait. Don't forget to order the assorted platter ..... Loved it !!!

Came across lazeez express searching for food on eid . The place was full and we luckily found a seat. We ordered for a mutton biriyani and shahi mutton stew. Most of the kebabs were out of stock so we ordered what the waiter suggested, some chicken kebabs. Must warn you that the service here is not  up to the mark. The order took almost 40 min to arrive and the waiters seemed clueless about the cutlery. However to compensate it the food was delicious. The mutton biryani was succulent and nice and so were the kebabs and the stew. The bill is also quite reasonable here. Overall if the service is improved itwll be a food eating joint, till then will prefer getting tge food packed like most customers.

While I really liked the food here, what really disappointed me was the kind of service. One guy who was serving our table was outright rude. Some of them really need to learn how to talk. Eventually another guy did apologise on his behalf but it did leave us with a rather bad impression. The food it impressive, the people there are not. Maybe I am generalising, but that is what we got when we were there.

I have been here today with my friend. It's a nice little biriyani joint. Kababs are very good. Specially chicken cheese kababs. Biriyanis are good too. Only the mutton pieces in biriyani are not good to eat. My recommendation is to order egg biriyani and kababs along with it. Also there are mosquitoes in the restaurant.  So try to sit at the table near a mosquito repellent system. One more thing,  carry along enough cash ....as they don't accept card yet. 
Happy eating :-)

My experiene with Lazeez food was bad. I took home Mutton Biriyani and Mutton pasinda Kabab. We consumed the food within 2 hours of delivery and found the Biriyani to be stale and the foul smell spoiled the dinner. The Pasinda was edible, nothing special about the taste. It was a disappointment for us and our guests. I don't think I will visit them agian or recommend them to any of my friends.

I visited this place tonight with my family and was immensely surprised with the quality of food and service. The place is not very large but sufficient for group visits. Though it had some items (like fish, beverages and deserts) missing because they have just started up in this location, the palate served to us was very tasty. We started with mixed non veg platter which had a mix of chicken and mutton variations. All of them specially the mutton bara kabab were amazing. The quantity of 2 servings was sufficient for 7 people. 

The personnel serving us were very attentive and asked for feedback multiple times. In the main course we opted for a variety of breads,chicken butter masala and mutton pasinda. The side dishes were slightly oily and can be reduced. But the taste was really good complementing the starters very well.

Firni was the only option in desert but was worth the while. The owners should consider incorporating all items on the menu as soon as possible. Overall it was a pleasent experience and hoping that the behavior of the staff and quality of food remains good over time. Recommend a visit.

This new restaurant is very close to my house so went there for a visit in an evening, this restaurant is in the place where bengali restaurant Gupi baghaa used to be. There are lots of tables so getting one wont be a problem even in peak hours..Ambience is good, nothing special but the food is extremely good..we ordered lazeez special chicken cheese kabab-its reshmi kabab coated with melted cheese,it was good, fish tandoori was also very good, masala kulchas were big soft full of stuffings, chicken tikka masala was great. service was reasonably quick and price range is very pocket friendly..overall had a very good experience there.. Because of their delicious food its becoming very popular among local people also..

This eatery is the latest to come up in Kasba. I visited for lunch, hungry, and curious! It was empty save the staff members. The place is done up nicely, and I imagine it will look better at night with the lights on! The seating is numerous and comfortable. They serve Indian food, with a nicely done up menu. Some of the items though were not available.
 To begin with, we ordered for Chicken Bara Kabab. For the main course we ordered for Chicken and Mutton Biriyani with Kashmiri Chicken. Obviously we wanted the Kababs first before the main course. However we were given the biriyani first, since the Kababs were taking time to cook! So we waited a bit and ate all together. I should not complain at all, since I absolutely LOVED the Chicken Bara Kabab! The meat was tender, perfect amount of spices! The green chutney, that came with it, was impressive too! Not too spicy, not too bland! The biriyanis were nicely made, though the piece of Mutton was just bones and fat! The Kashmiri chicken was suppose to be less spicy, but we felt it was way too bland with no distinct flavour at all! Then for dessert we ordered for Firni! The Firni was again pretty impressive taste-wise! Could have been texturally better!
 Service is not slow, though not quick either! Value for money would be 4 out of 5! They also have a delivery counter called Lazeez express! I would like to try it out soon! 
 Over all a satisfactory experience! Do visit! Enjoy! :)
