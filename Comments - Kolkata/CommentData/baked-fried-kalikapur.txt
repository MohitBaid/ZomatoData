Went there for a sudden evening craving. The joint is not very big but clean with a glass wall. It was mostly unoccupied when we arrived. We ordered Chicken burger meal, which included a burger, a 300ml thumbs up and a big piece of crispy fried chicken. Overall the meal is fulfilling and not too costly. The fried chicken was extremely well prepared. The burger tasted a little different because we don't usually put mustard instead of mayo in burgers. But it wasn't bad. In total a good place for a filling meal at low price.

The outlet in Rajarhat for Baked and fried is probably the best ans this one's probably the worst. I have ordered through Swiggy from this outlet. The size of the wrap was surprisingly small and in no way matched with the one I have had at Rajarhat. The nuggets were even smaller than ever and the quantity was less. Had a very bad experience!

Near to my place . Usually I take snacks from here while returning home from office. They have mango smoothies . Very tasty that is. Price wise I must say they are reasonable.  Quality is average.  You will find crispy fried chicken along with sub and burger . They have home delivery also.

It's near to my home and I have visited the place only once. Most of the time I order food from this joint. The meals that they offer are a pretty good and affordable. I like their crispy chicken Better 
than the kfc's . I ordered a spicy chicken wrap which was got delivered by a swiggy guy who came on time. Wraps can get little messy while eating so it's better to get it delivered at home . Quite satisfied with the quality n price.

They make some good chicken burger. We opted for home delivery service. Service was fast. If u are a fan of cheese and mayo do order extra. They taste heavenly when hot. And one burger makes u full, it's really that big.
Hoping to try other items too.

Coming to food ..they are good actually if u wana a hv American cuisine in a pocket friendly manner.
Ample in quantity..1 burger or wrap can satiate u
Taste is good ..I mean good..not great
In a nutshell this is poor man's Mac Donald n KFC😉,or rather pretty close to those

Burger wasn't available today,only thing which I love here. Chicken nuggets are not tasty at all. Very hard,and needed too much ketchup. Chicken tikka sub sandwich had less chicken when I had it. The chicken burger is awesome which sadly wasn't there when we went around 2.30 pm.

I went here today with a few of my friends and we ordered Chicken Wraps, Chicken Burgers and Chicken Nuggets.
We waited for so long that it felt like they had gone off to find the chicken, kill it, butcher it and then cook it and serve it.
The wraps were well made but with very cold and dry cabbage dressing inside though, the spiced mayonnaise and well cooked chicken pieces saved the day. The burger was big with a cheese slice and a crispy chicken patty and a decent dressing. It was good but the buns were very dry and heavy and thus the burger overall was heavy and two of my friends were unable to finish them.
Over now to the nuggets. They looked appetizing and were shaped in triangles but were very dry on the inside. So dry that we spent about one sachet of tomato ketchup on each nugget. There was an attempted spice seasoning inside but the dryness of the chicken failed the nuggets miserably. Either the nuggets were overcooked or stale though the balanced crispy outside suggested that they may not have been overcooked but stale.
The meal was filling, but more accurately it made our stomachs very heavy. The food quality should be improved, otherwise it's fruitless for anyone to visit here.

Horrible experience. Today,the 19th of April we went to this restaurant for a late afternoon lunch. The time was around 2:45pm. We had ordered two combo meals. One with chicken and the other with french fries. On arrival I found the chicken was soaked in oil. The burger patty also served the same story. The worst of all were the french fries. The chef had fried it with the fungus that had happily grown on the ill stored french fries. On confrontation the personnel said "sir,we do not manufacture this product. So we have no idea on what has been served". Something that made me stare at him for almost five minutes.

We are frequent visitors to this place. 
It is basically a cheaper version of KFC, Subway and Mc Donalds.
Their Chicken Tikka Sub Sandwich is a must try! 
We had also tried the Chicken Burger and Spicy Chicken Wrap. The wrap had too much sauce which I didn't like but the Burger is quite nice. Our favourite is the Burger Tikka Meal which serves a Chicken Burger, Chicken Tikka Sub-Sandwich and a 600ml Thumbs up at just 200 only. 
The quantity and quality of food they offer is really good in comparison to their price. 
The ambience is clean and bright and staff's behaviour is very nice. You can sit there for hours. 
So if you are searching for a pocket friendly fast food joint, do visit this place!

I do not see anything negative with BAKED & FRIED. It is actually a cheaper version of KFC and much less known. I am a frequent to this kalikapur outlet which has a spacious ac seating arrangement. Neat and clean. Coming to the food-  basically chicken burger, chicken wrap, chicken sandwich, chicken nuggets and spicy n crispy chicken are available. All the products are similar to dat of KFC. The prices are quite cheap. All the items are quite good both quality and quantity wise. So I will definitely opt for B&F over KFC. A person can have a hearty lunch at 200rs max. Taxes are quite reasonable too. But what they need to do is increase their no of outlets and they need to advertise the brand. Definitely worth many visits for all fast food chicken lovers.

Visited this outlet a few days back. It's a small food joint which packs a punch when it comes to food. They serve delicious burgers, sandwiches and fries. Very simple themed but is clean and has an elegant feel to it. 
We ordered one spicy and crispy chicken,  chicken nuggets and a burger tikka meal. The tikka sub sandwich was really nice. The burger too was delicious. Crispy chicken was also good. Everything we were served was up to the mark and the ambiance was decent. The place is easy on the pocket so that makes it even better.  So it was a good experience. I'd love to comeback here.

A small joint with approx 20 seating arrangements ...the glass panels make a direct view of the Prince anwar shah connector..many options of sandwich burgers and wraps..mainly the sandwiches are really good. They make squash of different flavors which are quite good.
Chily chicken and mayonnaise sub sandwich..is too good..I simply loved it
Grilled Chicken Margarita sub sandwich was full of mayonnaise and cheese hence too heavy to consume after few bites..the chicken was tough with bit of smell..not a fresh one it seemed.
We had chicken nuggets..pretty big pieces..well fried and crispy..
French fries..good one..quite a good quantity.
They don't give dishes..paper boxes only..that too all items were clubbed in one box..not quite comfortable for sharing between 2 people. Self service and the order has to be placed and served by your own..otherwise a nice place for evening snacks.

I don't know why am even writing this review, perhaps helping unsuspecting souls from being disappointed.

A small fast food joint on the likes of KFC, unfortunately no where near to then in taste. A case in point, in stark contrast, is Mary Brown a south Indian venture which has an Indian maseladar touch to the KFC fare.

The ambience is good, the staff friendly. But sob sob, the food is insipid be it the burger or the fried chicken (more so the chicken!)

Folks visit this place at your own risk.

This joint is comparitively more pocket friendly than the ones we are more used to and have heard of more. I ordered a takeaway of their Chicken Burger and Chicken Sub Sandwich and a 600ml bottle of Thums Up a few weeks ago.

It's easy to locate, a 5 minute walk towards Prince Anwar Shah Road on the Byepass and crossing at Kalikapur. It is quite spaced out and comfortable for a small eatery. Both the burger and sandwich were pretty heavy on the stomach. So size-wise, they are doing a good job. As for taste, there was nothing special about the burger patty, but it was cooked well and tasted decent. Unfortunately, they had so much cheese and mustard and dressing on it, it drowned out the taste of the patty and was actually a little sickening. The sandwich on the other hand was quite tasty and much much better than the burger.

Their burgers are surprisingly amazing. They are the best thing that they have got. Unfortunately, unlike kfc I have to use ketchup to eat the chicken.  It's not bad with the ketchup. You can eat it.  Value for money ? Yeah, kind of, because of the burgers. The chicken just falls in the category of good, it is definitely not great. The place could do with an oil cleansing, tables were really oily. They are WAY cheaper than KFC though. I would recommend them over KFC if you don't have that much money to spare

I'm a fan of their chicken nuggets. I have picked them up from here numerous times along with a chicken burger or a sub. Their crispy chicken is good, please don't have KFC on your mind. Their meals look delicious, however almost always it is not available. We could make more frequent trips if they were.

I wasn't expecting much when I walked in, for whatever reason, but it turned out to be a better experience than I had thought. The place is well-decorated and fairly spacious, and good for hanging out with friends and yet have private conversations. The glass walls facing the Anwar Shah Connector Road makes it even better. There's something cozy and youthful about the place.
I ordered the chicken tikka wrap meal, and had the bbq sub sandwich replaced with chicken steak sub. I also added a lemon slushy. The steak sub was really good; the chicken steak and a lovely smoky crisp to it on the outside, the kind you get from grilling chicken. Its taste was great, too,but the texture felt slightly dry. The wrap was quite delicious, with some unique combinations of flavours working perfectly with the mayonnaise. The only thing I have a complain about is the slushy. The drink tasted so sour and synthetic that it was like drinking straight out of a bottle of lemon concentrate, in dire need of some dilution and sweetening. My teeth and throat started to feel weird after some time. Other than that, I was mostly satisfied. The staff was a little unsure of what to do. But service was pretty fast. The counter could do with a little more cleaning - if they have kept food on display, the glass needs to be clean enough for customers to see the items and find their freshness appetising. All in all, it was satisfactory, and I'll go back when I want a quick bite.

Now the food is great the price is nice but the last time I visited, I saw that they were frying the veg and non veg items in the same oil, which is a big big put off. 
Sorry to say, but the very reason I gave you 2.5.

I ordered from this place one late evening to satiate the hungry-burger-carver within myself. Though it's located at kalikapu, delivery to kasba was quite swift.I was starving when I had ordered, so when the delivery boy arrived sooner than I expected, it definitely earned then a few extra brownie points.
I ordered a chicken burger. The burger has a mid-sized chicken patty which was plain delicious. The bread was soft and fresh. The combination of the chicken patty with a layer of mayo, topped with a cheese slice and some fresh veggies was plain perfect. I was expecting the burger to be mediocre because it was quite cheap but with the first bite itself the burger got all my attention - It was yummilicious to the core. I'm happy I ordered from this place and hope to try some of the other items soon!

I'm a fan of their chicken nuggets. I have picked them up from here numerous times along with a chicken burger or a sub. Their crispy chicken is good, please don't have KFC on your mind. Their meals look delicious, however almost always it is not available. We could make more frequent trips if they were.

I wasn't expecting much when I walked in, for whatever reason, but it turned out to be a better experience than I had thought. The place is well-decorated and fairly spacious, and good for hanging out with friends and yet have private conversations. The glass walls facing the Anwar Shah Connector Road makes it even better. There's something cozy and youthful about the place.
I ordered the chicken tikka wrap meal, and had the bbq sub sandwich replaced with chicken steak sub. I also added a lemon slushy. The steak sub was really good; the chicken steak and a lovely smoky crisp to it on the outside, the kind you get from grilling chicken. Its taste was great, too,but the texture felt slightly dry. The wrap was quite delicious, with some unique combinations of flavours working perfectly with the mayonnaise. The only thing I have a complain about is the slushy. The drink tasted so sour and synthetic that it was like drinking straight out of a bottle of lemon concentrate, in dire need of some dilution and sweetening. My teeth and throat started to feel weird after some time. Other than that, I was mostly satisfied. The staff was a little unsure of what to do. But service was pretty fast. The counter could do with a little more cleaning - if they have kept food on display, the glass needs to be clean enough for customers to see the items and find their freshness appetising. All in all, it was satisfactory, and I'll go back when I want a quick bite.

This is located near spencer which in turn is located on KALIKAPUR crossing. 
Now the food is great the price is nice but the last time I visited, I saw that they were frying the veg and non veg items in the same oil, which is a big big put off. 
Sorry to say, but the very reason I gave you 2.5. 
Wake up people wake up! 
Happy dining.

Located on kalikapur just beside Avishikta gate...Opened last year and been there a few times as it's on my way to home...

Love their Chicken Burgers and Wraps though the Crispy Chicken is better made by KFC...

Best part is you can customize your orders and instruct them as per your taste buds and preferences...

This outlet is situated at kalikapur, near State Bank of India bus stop....One day we went there for a lunch....Interior was good.... Staffs were friendly but not trained....We have ordered 1. Burger Chicken Meal.... 2. French Fries.... All fried items are over burnt and had oily smell.... that's why tasted very bad....Cost of food was acceptable....

This place is a mix of good and not so goods. The fries and snacks are reasonably priced and very filling. Their nuggets are way bigger than the nuggets we normally get and yummier. However they need to spice the subs up and little more blend the tastes together.

This place has it's pros and cons. 
Starting with the Pros-
1. The food is worth the price and very tasty. However, they need to use a little more spices when it comes to the fried chicken. 
2. The staff is really friendly.
3. We didn't have to wait to long for the food. 

Now moving on to the cons (restricted to the Kalikapur Branch only)
1. The place was a little small for my liking. 
2. This place did not have a washroom. Which in my opinion is a huge bummer. 

Regardless, it is a great place to chill AMD have fun with friends. :D

Kalikapur is the lane for unique restaurants, this is one of them. If you are bored with KFC, give this place a visit. Perfect for some snacks and even a light lunch. The service is not the best and a little slow, but the food makes up for it. 

The combo burger meals were mostly unavailable, so we had to resort to the second best option. We tried out the Chicken steak sub sandwich, Chicken burger and Spicy and Crispy chicken.  The food was pretty good, justifies the price.

Don't know why this place has such a low rating, I loved their food. Went their yesterday, this outlet is really huge and spacious. This place is like a faraway cousin of Kfc and Mc donald. Their meal menus were quite flattering but wasn't that hungry to had one, so we ordered chicken steak and chicken tomatilla sub sandwich. Both the sandwiches tasted delicious with full of flavours and was very filling. The only flaw I noticed that the bread wasn't that good and a little over done. We also had orange slush which was very refreshing. 
If they fix up their tenny tiny drawbacks they surely gonna give a nice competition to others. Lastly, their food is very very reasonably priced, so a big thumbs up for that !!

Get on the Jadavpur Thana and Bypass connector, and you will find this outlet, nestled right next to Abhishikta Housing Complex. I and my friends discovered this place last year, and have been paying visits ever since. 

What works for the place?

1. The freshly cooked food
2. Cheap prices
3. Chicken fried to order
4. Flavors

The chicken tikka, chicken margerita and the chilli chicken sub sandwiches are without a doubt the most ordered items from the sandwich section. They are flavorsome, have just the right amount of spice and also abundant. Apart from the subs the main attraction lies with the crispy fried chicken. Unlike KFC (now), they will fry your chicken to order. Never till date have I found them serving over fried chicken. It is crispy on the outside and the juices run clear when you bite into one. The chicken is marinated in a combination of unique spices, you can absolutely taste the lemon juice/lemon zest in it. Quite a welcoming addition. The only thing that I stay away from is the nuggets. 

Also, the combos are really attractive. Meal for four can be easily adjusted in a mere 400-500 Rs radius, if you choose the right stuff.

Passed by this outlet but never had the opportunity to check it out.
Yesterday was determined to visit it. The outlet is large, divided into ac and non ac section. It was built in the model of kfc and McDonald. But the menu card disappointed me because the variety is not much. There are meals but not suitable for me. So I chose spicy and crispy chicken of four to be parcelled. The staff was very polite and asked me to wait for 5 minutes in the ac section, but I preferred to sit in the non ac section. Within three minutes it was ready, beautifully parcelled in a brown paper bag and then a thick polythene carry bag. I loved it.
After having reached home, I found the pieces parcelled in a cardboard box to keep the food warm, and enough of sauces and tissue paper.
And the food. The pieces are large and fat, crispy and soft and tasty. It was very delicious. In fact, better than what I had last time at kfc.
So I have decided to come here time and again to parcel some food for home.

I was very skeptical at first about eating out at this fast food joint. But since I ran out of options, I had to go in. 
The inside looks very similar to kfc but the 30% less rates will instantly make you feel at ease. 
I ordered a Chicken Tikka sub-sandwich. 
Now having plenty of subs frm subway and other places,  I wasn't expecting anything great.
  The sub-sandwich they served was just fantastic.  Plenty portions of chicken grilled. Filled with mustard mayo and all the veg goodies like lettuce, onion, etc. And on top of that the sandwich was grilled. I Loved it. The bread was very fresh. 
I'll surely go here again to try their other preparations. Keep it up guys. Maintain this quality and you'll give a tough competition to kfc and the likes.

They tasted a bit sour but was not bad. This outlet I believe has the potential and will give big houses a tough competition. French fries were good too.....

The first time I went, we ordered chicken nuggets, lime slush and orange slush.
The lime slush tasted of Glucon-D almost medicinal. 
The orange slush was way too sweet. 
We had expectations from the nuggets but as they arrived, they were not crispy and smelled of fish. 
We had to throw our entire order and walk out.

A cheaper version of KFC, in short. It's quite near my house and not many restaurants are open during lunchtime (within walking distance), so there's no other option usually. But as a place to enjoy your meals, you might want to reconsider. Quality of food is 2/5. Service is 1/5. Ambience is 3/5. If not the food, but the service SHOULD be improved. I don't think it should take 15 minutes to make two pieces of Fried Chicken. And its unappealing that they provide the food in parts (1 burger and then fries 10 minutes later). Can improve.

There isn't much to say about this joint, except that it's pointless coming here. The stuff they serve is just a cheaper, far inferior version of KFC's menu. This should speak volumes considering KFC themselves are quite terrible.

Service is fine, and the staff are efficient enough. However, they serve parts of a meal individually -- which is unusual, and unappealing. Probably not going to come back here.

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made.

we went there to have an evening snack. we were two people.

we ordered chicken burgers and fried chicken.

it took them 20 minutes to serve our orders and two other persons who had ordered after us, got their food way before we did.

coming to the food... well both the burgers and the fried chicken were tasty but they were more on the saltier side. as my boyfriend had eaten from there earlier, he told me earlier it tasted okay. this might be a one day glitch.

the seating space is cool. the triangular shapes and looking at the road and eating, seems fun.

the staff is kind of unprofessional. they don't take the orders in the way they should, later on forget one of the things we ordered (we ordered a mineral water, it was on the bill, they saw and ignored it till we had to ask for it).

I might come back here the next time because the food's tasty, and I hope they reduce the salt in them, but never again am I gonna sit there to eat. I will just do a take away. they do the take away orders really fast.

Cheap alternative of KFC but far behind in terms of taste....
There are availability of sandwiches and slush as well. But none of them are really up to the mark. There is no availability of cold beverages except slush.
Need to improve more

The food is not bad, way better than kfc. But the choices are too few. Sitting area is nice. Parking space is not a problem. The only concern in this outlet is the behavior of the staff. The guy taking our orders was particularly rude and had serious attitude problem. We were really disgusted with him. If they are not trained to deal with customers, it'll be better to shut down the shop. The owners must understand that customers do not pay money to deal with rude and illiterate staffs.

This newly opened place in Kalikapur may not have too much in their kitty.. But whatever they have...that's decent. I mean, their burgers r quite delicious... Fresh, made with much care !!! French fries are fresh too!!! I didn't try the fried chicken and other subs but whatever little I had I was quite satisfied. My suggestion would be do not try to experiment with fancy orders.. Just go for the simple ones. It's totally pocket friendly. Great place for evening snacks.

OK..I was really skeptical about going to this place after reading the reviews..but I must say this outlet is really good. It's not extraordinary and out of the world but it is good. We had chicken Burger which I really liked. A burger of that sort for a mere 70 bucks is really cheap and the Patty tastes really good. It is very filling also. We ordered for French fries also and the quantity was really sufficient. Overall we had a nice experience here at Baked & Fried.

We were really hungry and i saw this place while coming back from south city, I didn't look up on the zomato before going in and ordering, anyway i ordered chicken nuggets, margarita sub and chicken burger. The burger was really good, i mean for 70 + tax if you cant expect more, the bun was soft filled with mayonnaise and white sauce, it was lovely. Took a nugget to taste from Dad it didn't disappoint me either, it was well fried the taste was good and coming to the sub, I really expected more, comparing it to Subway will be harsh but i would really expect more.
The staffs weren't that friendly, i went inside and asked the guy to explain me the sub but he was busy texting, i stood there gazing at him. He kept me waited as it was important for him to reply rather than looking after his customer, that was really rude, but as I took away the food it didn't bother me that much.

For the lovebirds its a perfect spot. The ambience is nice, and it doesn't come that hard on the pocket either.
I was really shocked after opening their page in zomato they aren't that bad.

Simply awful. I asked for a steak and got a sandwich instead. Trying to copy KFC, made a blunder. Nothing more than a little joint with very little options. Even the staffs dont have an idea of what the hell they are serving.

8 total tables, 25 seats maximum. Very precise menu, staff behavior not so hospitable. Definitely cheaper than KFC (have to be). Though the chicken nuggets are quite tasty, so are the slushes. Steak sandwich is a must try. Nice place for a quick bite.

Tastes better than kfc, at low price.ample parking space on road.not much talked about, till now.....so getting a place is easy. This is a place of "pick n move" or just a potato for a quick bike.....nothing special

This place is located just in front of my house. So deserved a visit. The menu is very much limited. I have tried quite a few items though like chicken nuggets, fried chicken, chicken tikka, margarita, burger, etc. Good place for a small bite and hangout.

Average to the power infinity. Service is slow and I only had fried chicken which was below average. Location and parking facilities are good . Lots to improve upon.
