Iconic, Authentic, Mouth-Watering Food, Great Location and Pocket-Friendly - and we have summarised Jyoti Vihar. It serves great dosas, and I try to visit it every time I am in Kolkata. The place hasn‚Äôt lost its taste or service even a bit in all these years. Its a definitely go-to place if one is craving for great South-Indian food. üòã

Jyoti Vihar serves authentic South Indian food and that‚Äôs probably why they dont sell various variations of dosa. For example, cheese one. 
Nonetheless, both paper butter dosa and butter masala dosa are good. They excel in their coffee making. The service is prompt & the place is light on pockets. Perfect for college goers.

Craving South Indian food? This should be your go to place. Jyoti Vihar is an excellent place to indulge in dosas, idli, vada. Every item you order here is worth it. The sambar and chutney is well made. Usually I take away but the service in house is good. Don't go for the ambiance just go for the food. It is worth it.

Visited this place for lunch on a Saturday afternoon! Its a small restaurant in terms of floor area but well managed which reduces the waiting time! 
Ordered sambar idli, ghee butter sada dhosa, onion chutney and filter coffee !
The sambar idli were great , but the dhosa could have been better! The sambar and chutney were perfect! The filter coffee tasted just as it should, so no complaints!
The place is affordable and a decent stop if you are in the mood for a South Indian lunch!

I found it to be an average south Indian joint. Decent seating arrangement and ac works just fine. Price is ok as per south Indian cuisine. But the dosa is not at all filling as per the price it's very lite. Sambhar and chutney is v.tasty. There are other south Indian joints which at the same price give dosas which are quite filling. So it's ok if you are nearby you can visit.

A popular joint at Ho-Chi-Minh Sarani serving South Indian food at affordable prices . It is located near the Ho-Chi-Minh Sarani & Little Russell Street crossing opposite to the Police Kiosk .The ground floor is for takeaway option while the sitting arrangement is on the first floor .Interior decoration is minimal yet the sitting area is quite comfortable . Service is prompt & the quality of food is really praiseworthy . Be it Dosa , Idli or Vada - all are mouthwatering & at their prices it's value for money . One thing to be kept in mind - they do not accept cards & payment is by cash only.

My dad took me here since he got nostalgic seing the place when we were crossing on a work day. He entered and it was like a time machine for him as he said he was taken back in time as it looked the same as it did 10-15 years back.

What we ordered:

-Idli : super soft and light. Even eating 3-4 and still you'd feel light

-Vada : So well made. Not too over fried and still light

-Ghee Butter Dosa :good taste of ghee and enough masala. Loved how they put homemade white butter.

The chutneys and sambhar is terrific. Especially the latter

The service is brilliant and the prices are the best you can see. We had all that and a coke for lesser than 400 bucks

I'm a fan of their Onion Utappam! Can't say anymore!
Vada is also superb! If you love South Indian Dishes, this place will top your favorites list for sure. üòÅ

For the lovers of South Indian Cuisine this place is the best . Located on the lane of the British Embassy . The place opens at around 10am and closes around 5.30pm .

Simply the best dosa I have ever had.. Visited this place at around 6pm when it was about to close.. Hence it was totally empty and also the staffs were rounding up.. We ordered for ghee butter masala dosa and butter paper masala dosa.. The ghee butter masala dosa was awesome.. The accompanying coconut chutney n sambar dal was not even needed, although those were also very tasty.. U will like it from the first bite and just when you get used to the taste you will find a spoonful of white butter right in the middle of the dosa making it all the more ecstatic.. No decor as such n just chair table for eating but the entire focus is on the Food they serve n they are doing it brilliantly.. Our visit was just a casual one to satisfy hunger but our experience was very good..

Cheese dosa and kulfi - these are missing from menu card so, that's bit surprising. Waiters are quite fast and polite. It's a pocket friendly place for people.

This authentic south Indian restuarant situated in camac street serves one of the best dosa's in town.
They have variaties of chutneys with their dosa which makes it something different from the other dosa joints in kolkata.
The only drawback is that they stick to the authentic recipes and don't serve variaties like cheese dosa and other new variations in dosas.
But yes! They are really good at what they do. 
Must visit for south indian.
The ambience isn't too great it is a simple family restaurant.

That one thing which has been a constant from my childhood till now, is Jyoti Vihar. The oldest, most authentic and organised South Indian restaurant. Even our friends and families from outside Calcutta love this place and want to come back whenever they are in the city. The reaction I give to people who haven't heard of or been to Jyoti Vihar is the same as a non-vegetarian would give on being served a vegetarian biryani. 

Over the years, it went through basic changes in terms of electronics, furniture, interiors. But the quality of food and service, the efficiency of the staff remains the same. In the last 15 years, not even once have I had any complaints regarding their food or service.

From the consistency of the Idlis to the super crisp and light Paper Dosas, Jyoti Vihar is something no food lover can miss. The taste of the chutney and sambhar also has been exactly the same since a decade if I can remember.¬†

The only thing they could possibly improve in, is hygiene! Overall a top place for good food!

This a very good place for south indian food lovers. Located in Ho chi min sarani, Camac street. 

Pure vegetarian restaurant. Ambiance is nice with comfortable seating arrangements. Place is spacious. In the ground floor they have the take away counter and the dining facility available on the first floor.  Most of the time remains crowded, so you have to wait if you want to dine in. Tried dahi vada and onion utapam both were delicious. Prices are reasonable as per quality they offer.

They make nice filtered coffee too. The sambhar drenched vada is also a must try here. U will get nothing in the name of ambience here but the service is fast and good. Some food items are a bit overpriced but rest of all are worth every penny.

After trying out numerous chinese & north indian places, I finally decided to shift to south for a change of scenario. So this month's first food try out started from the renowned jyoti vihar near metro plaza opposite of Gabbar's.

The place has spacious dining facility on 1st floor with the ground floor being a takeaway section. A south indian would definitely like the place because of the simplicity being maintained with the servers being dressed up in typical south indian attire.

On a weekend during lunch it is difficult to get a place & one might have to wait for sometime to get a table. After waiting for 5-6mins we were finally seated. We quickly ordered the following:-

1. Onion utthapam - Big round moderately thick utthapam prepared in mildly sour curd with generous amounts of sprinkled onion. The taste lived up & certainly made us happy. Coconut chutney & sambar dal were provided as condiments. The coconut chutney was sublime & the dal was good to drink.

2. Onion masala dosa - The size of the dosa was huge. The stuffing also was very generous. I would have preferred the stuffing to be a bit spicy but it was rather mild in taste. It was good to eat.

3. Paper butter masala dosa

4. Filtered coffee - Typical strong south indian coffee but the balance maintained between the strong coffee taste & sweetness was commendable. This certainly impressed us.

The place is very economical on the pockets. It cost us roughly 200 per head. The service deserves special mention. Very prompt & the servers would offer you extra chutney/dal whenever you require it. Overall we had a satisfying experience.

Though basic in terms of sitting arrangement. They literally serve the best South Indian  in town. Purely veg though but the soft idlis and lovely sambhar will make u dig in even though u may not be a veg or a South Indian fan. Dosas are well made and so are uttapam and pulao. Special chutneys are a must try as well. But the winner is definitely the well drenched Idli in a plate of sambhar.

This place is just for the foodies. Nothing to talk about with regard to the ambience and the seating. However there is a lot to talk about when it comes to food. In Fact you can go on and on. Serving South Indian food for ages and tucked in a corner close to Metro Plaza shopping plaza. This has to be amongst the best South Indian food served in the city of joy. The taste just never disappoints. Go there on a weekend and you are bound to see long queues and average waiting time of 30-40 mins. It is very pocket friendly and frequented by office goers, students and families as well. This place is iconic and a must visit!

Revisited this place after atleast 5 years today, although it is located in my neighbourhood, I somehow either never found the time or wasn't in the mood for South Indian food. I must confess, I'm not a big fan of this cuisine. It took some pestering for the fam to convince me, ofcourse.
Coming to the point, the staffs are South Indians and that hasn't changed in all these years. It also lends a genuinity to the eatery. We had to wait for about 10 minutes before we were assigned a table for the 4 of us, given that it is a Saturday and also during the lunch hours. Compared to other restaurants which fall into the same category being not very big or fancy, this place has always been very clean and hygienic.
I ordered a plate of idli and shared a butter masala dosa. The idlis were steaming hot and served with complimentary chutney and sambhar dal. I did not particularly like the masala with the dosa. The service was swift, no complains there.
Would recommend this if you're vegetarian, but for meat-eaters like myself, it's a one-time visit.

Went to this place on a Saturday noon with office colleagues for lunch. This place is always buzzing with people. Seating area, ambience, decor is not something you should expect from this place. Only mouth watering South Indian food. Their idlis are extremely soft which just melts in your mouth. Their upmas, dosas, uttapams are one of the best In the town. Service is quick. Must visit for quick lunch if you are in that area.

Cooking is generally associated with highly expertised people in kitchen.. Yes our mothers are the ones who cooks with power! Those fast swift wielding hands that moves the spoons to and fro just to feed us with our favourites! I still remember that whenever i  just tumbled into her kitchen i would be fascinated! My tummy and sensory organs could sense/smell the aroma of Sambhar tadkas, the splutter of Curry leaves and mustard seeds and the Idlis.. Sums up to the awesome South Indian! There's always a reason why i share stories.. Now i dont coax my mom to cook and i take her to Jyoti Vihar instead which serves that homely South Indian and we have a mini outing with family! So lets get started with Gupshup
The Ambience is very basic.. not like that of a cafe kinds. Seating is small congested area n basic chairs n tables! First impression: not good ambience wise!
But the Food is the USP and that it serves with utmost good quality and quantity! The Idlis are very soft and huge! The Idlis and Vadas are huge and super delicious.. must must try!
Crispy Paper Butter & ghee Dosa is very crisp and itl make one crave for yet another one! 
The Staff are the oldest and very loyal.. serves quick and its very reasonable when it comes to your pocket! The only flaw is that this place needs to be tidied up and clean.. coz it feels more like a messy canteen area to me! Please post your thoughts on this one! Thanks!

Jyoti Vihar is quite a famous place cause of it's South Indian food.

To be honest, I didn't really find the food here happening at all. It's not authentic. It isn't delicious. They don't have much varieties for a South Indian Cuisine. Just a few options on the menu.

I can go here only if I am starving and low on money and I have no where else to go to if I'm around Camac.

Interiors are nothing great. But sometimes such interiors feel comfortable.

My favourite destination for south indian food for a long time has lost its charm now. I would assume the staff has become careless and the management hasn't noticed. Last couple of times, I no more got piping hot sambhar. The plates and spoons used to be clean which is why I could really enjoy the food, not anymore. When I saw another customer complaining about the waiter serving him a used bowl of chutney, I ignored thinking he was just probably paranoid. But then I saw it too. How easily the waiter picked up a bowl of chutney he had earlier cleared from another table and brought it to mine. It was disgusting. I am certainly not going back here. Time to look for another south indian place. Any suggestions?

A legendary restaurant which used to serve the best South Indian food in central Calcutta. But now the quality has really gone down, especially of the chutney and sambhar. Sambhar is jus boiled water with the lots of red chillies.. No taste. With so many options now available, they should really Buck up and not be so reliant on only the name and not maintain quality.

This is the place you come for filling south Indian breakfast. Not to expect authentic south Indian or experimental south Indian but proper regular south Indian, to crave your morning hunger.

Mendu bada and butter masala dosa(a lumb of white makhan in the dosa) is recommended.

Nothing fancy about the ambiance. You will see people que up to take a seat or even to pack it. It has long waiting lines but service is fast to clear the lines.
Perfect for Sunday's after your Morning jog.

Though I don't like South Indian cuisine a whole lot, but I guess once a while I really enjoy it. 
And this place is a vintage I assume. Satisfying and pleasing dishes. Nothing to write much. Things are served as you have in mind. Dosa. Idli. Vada. Curd Rice. Everything leaves a savoring effect on taste buds. 
Surely I can drop in by any day. :)

Authentic south indian place.
The set up has hardly changed since years.
And the dosas are very light and amazing.
They serve sambhar and other side dishes as per Jains too. 
I really like the plain dosa here.
Even the sambhar (which I don't drink anywhere else) is yum!

Jyoti Vihar is a small south Indian joint located in Ho Chi Min Sarani. It's really old and I've been coming here since I was a kid which makes the place even more special for me. 

The idlies here are so good that they just melt into your mouth. The taste of that special chutney and sambar has been the same since forever !! 
My order here is fixed. A plate of that delicious idly (try it with a little butter and sprinkle some chilli powder) 
Masala Dosa (either paper or normal) and of course the famous filter coffee. 
I recently tried the medu vada must say it was great. 

The staff is courteous and I guess the ambience is what makes it feel like home since forever. Jyoti Vihar is my hunger saviour !!

I don't like the quality of the dosas. Too oily. Idli was fine
The onion chutney ia good but can be better.
Found nothing special about the sambhar chutney either, in totality wasn't upto my expectations, as I had heard so much about it. I'm a lover of South Indian food and I will definitely not want to visit this place again.

When we think of south indian, the name synonym to it is Jyoti Vihar, good old eatery with where people don't mind even being waiting for an hour too on a sunday!!.. after a long wait I ordered for steaming soft idli's and vada dipped in sambar....the sambar quality in over the years have gone down. But the quality and taste idli and vada was same.. then i ordered ghee masala dosa and it was one of the best dosa's they have, taste heavenly but heavy on stomach..

To end the meal you ought to have "South Indian Filter Coffee" ..... amazing is an understatement.. over all i enjoyed the place.. only challenge would be maintaining the staff quality and food quality. There is lot of competition and one has to be on their toes...!!!

I would rate it 4/5

One of the oldest south indian joints in Kolkata. No wonder you won't get a spot on weekdays for lunch! Their sambhar is brilliant. Idli dipped in sambhar is my favourite here! Masala/mix uttapam is very crispy and not oily. They don't serve cheese dosa (sorry cheese lovers) or fresh lime soda which are quite demanded items. But it'll always remain an all time fav for those looking for a quick healthy meal!

The best south Indian food u will get in kolkata. Probably the best in india. 
The idly and vada and plain chutney are the best items here, especially the idli. The coconut chutney is always awesome. 

The sambhar though is a hit or a miss. Its either good or ok but never bad. 

Also tried the plain masala dosa. Which was superb as expected. The quantity of the masala could have been more. It finished too fast. 

If i ever have to eat south indian food from a restaurant ill eat it only from jyoti vihar and no where else if im in kolkata. 

Would have given 5 if the sambhar was as perfect as everything else.

Purely based on the food, I would perhaps rate this place 4/5. Their service is prompt. They probably have the best idlis in town and their chutneys and uthappams also deserve mention. The dosas could be a little less oily though.
Weak points - they open a little late for a South Indian joint (10am), and on top of that you have to wait a fair bit to get a table. Also, you only have soft drinks to choose from in the beverages. However the food and service make up for it.
Weird trivia - they don't give tissue papers and the waiters roam around barefoot!
Overall, it's quite a popular place in a good location, and I'll go with 3 out of 5

I have been to this place since I was born. Believe me this still serves the same quality food. Delicious. Its located inside a building and there is no decor as such. Always stays crowded and one has to wait but waiting is worth it. Their dosas, idli, uttapam...all are mind blowing. The best item they serve is the chutney. Its the best south Indian chutney in the city...and unlike other south Indian small joints they serve the chutney whole heartedly and not miserly. The south Indian filter coffee is equally good. The staff is quick...prompt and well aware of what's available what not. Overall had a great experience every time I visited this place.

This outlet is the Baap of South Indian Food.
Hit this place for South Indian food minus everything else.
Located just opposite Gabbar in Ho Chi Minh Sarani, You will be able to locate it by seeing a huge crowd (lol)

Ambience:
Dirty, through a very narrow staircase, in a crowded seating arrangement where you might have to wait for any amount of time. But as I told Food minus everything!!

Food:
Ghee Sada paper Dosa- the best you can have here. The onion chutney is a must, sambhar yum, chutney yum..
Onion Uttapam-again too good.
Masala dosa , onion dosa all all all variants are good.
I haven't tried the milk Upma or the coffe tea. Next visit m gonna do so.

Service: is decent keeping in mind the crowd. Washroom very bad. It's a little unhygienic place but for the great South Indian dishes, sacrifices!!

Pocket pinch: suitable for the taste!

LOCATION:

Little Russell Street right next to the American Consulate.¬†

OVERVIEW & INTERIORS:

One of the legendary names for South Indian food in Kolkata. Many swear by the South Indian flare here and the place is awfully full even for weekday lunches. Interiors are quite basic. But then taking into consideration that the owner claims that all the proceeds from the restaurant go to charitable purposes, one has to look over it.

WINE & DINE:

I found the idly's to be superb. They were soft, moist and melt in your mouth stuff. It was complemented well with coconut chutney and sambhar.

The Dosa was also good. I found the mashed south indian potatoes served with the dosa to be bland but then I guess they cannot make food as per individual flavor preferences.¬†

The South Indian Coffee I ordered at the end was amazing. It was strong, rich and not over sweet.¬†

Prices are affordable and very worth the food they serve.

FEEDBACK FOR IMPROVEMENT:

The toilets need to be cleaner. They were dirty and unusable upon my last visit. The staircase leading to the restaurant floor needs cushioning as the height is not much and may result in major injuries.

VERDICT:

Go for authentic South Indian food minus the glitz and glamour. You wont be disappointed.

Still my fave for South Indian namely idli, vada, dosas, because (1) excellent batter producing fluffy idlis, crispy outside fluffy inside vadas, and super thin paper dosas (my favourite kind of dosa); (2) really good chutneys and the sambar is also pretty darn tasty; (3) swift service...er, more or less; (4) consistent quality of food; (5) really well churned, homemade butter. It's a no frills, just eat and go type of place. I agree that for this kind of eatery it is kinda pricey. But since I prefer this to all the other notable dosa hotspots, I  feel the price is justifiable.

Location : Very near metro shopping plaza, just opposite newly opened gabbars

Decor : Simple

Service : Prompt

Food ordered :
Sambhar vada
Onion Masala Dosa
Onion Chutney
Fresh Lime Soda

Description : An informal meet with an old friend of mine and we both were not that hungry, so we decided to try south Indian as it being light in comparison to north Indian. When we went there, the restaurant was full. But we got table in 10min. We ordered above items. Sambhar tasted awesome. I can say it is the best sambhar I have ever tasted. Sambhar vada n Dosa were awesome. Onion Chutney is a must try. Fast service adds to it.
A must try place. If someone goes once, the person will go here again n again.

I wish there was a 0/5 option.
Be as popular a restaurant as you could be, serve the best quality food, but if you CAN NOT TREAT YOUR CUSTOMER WELL, eventually you'll lose business.
I am sitting here right now, thanks to the argument I had to do, to get my seat.
It is crowded with people waiting to get their seat. I entered before someone else, and that person on the gate who writes down the waiting numbers, gave them the seat before me. To asking him that, he misbehaved saying "I know better who entered and who did not". 
That was one thing. The second being, there was a man waiting before us but he gave away his line to his friend and her father, that does not mean you still count him before me in the allotment of seat. (That girl and her father had come after me)This happened too.
I had to argue with that man to get my seat. 
Dear management, if you can not keep polite and sincere workers, it's going to cost you hard. And if you really exist, do not let any other customer face this problem. Take that man into your custody and teach him the ethics of business, if possible?
Sat here just for my friend, not going to come back ever!
Well done, Jyoti Vihar!

Its the best South Indian Restaurant all over Kolkata... No comparison at all.........
Service is very fast and food is DELICIOUS........
Everything from Idli, Vada,Dosa, Masala Vada, Uttapam and specially the taste of Sambhar is awsm....... Even in week days they give curd rice, pulao and other such dishes which are also really tasty........
South Indian lovers must not miss to have here....... And in weekends one must remember to wait in a que during lunch time bcz of the rush..........

This place had been bookmarked and was waiting to be ticked for long time.

Finally got a chance today, reached there around 2 with my Friends. We had to wait for 13 tables to complete their part of feasting on the yummy crispy dosas.

But it was completely worth it.
I tried Ghee Paper Masala Dosa. It was a crisp dosa soaked in right amount of ghee and Mashed Aloo Onion Masala. Chutney had good consistency. It was one of the best Dosas I have ever had in Kolkata.

Also Tried Masala wada. Vada made with soaked lentils, onion & green chilly. Fried as it should be. I don't expect it to be better than this. Nothing less than any of them I have had on my trips to Southern Part of our Country.

Along with this we ordered Onion chutney in extra. It was good chutney paste made from Onion and some other ingredients. Order it if you want to add a Tangy taste to your meal.

Service -ok, they were serving a full house.

Ambience- come on, the place is for food, not to pass time.

They had a good system of manag

It is a legendary restaurant in south Indian cuisine.  The idli is to die for...just melts ...the best coconut chutney I have had and always fresh. Order anything from the dosa to the crispy vada. ..One is sure to visit this place again. Keep it up for serving quality food at affordable rates still.

The best idli and Dosa in the country! Through the years this place has maintained consistent quality and taste. Only wish they were open for longer than now. Why they are not using the ground floor defies logic when there's always folks waiting to be seated.

I visited the place at 11 in the morning. We had ordered masala vada, idli, paper butter masala dosa and masala dosa. The plates were not clean and there was a strand of hair too which was gross. We noticed this towards the end. Butter in the dosa was cold and not spread, it was one cube kept in the center. This meant one has to spread it himself. I have had very good experiences in the past but this time it was very disappointing.

Here goes my ode to the hidden gem of Kolkata. Countless lunches at this place - just go there to satiate your appetite for anything South Indian. Love the idli-Wada dip, with the perfect home made sambhar and special chutney (you need to order that separately). And the best part is to finish it all with the good ol filter coffee. 

Delicious fare without pinching the pocket and very efficient service. But beware! Expect long queues during lunch time and it's closed on Mondays.

So much hullabaloo about Jyoti Vihar being the best at south Indian food in Kolkata so I went with my mother for a casual sunday lunch. I entered the Ho Chi Minh Sarani and looked left and right but could not find any board or building that said Jyoti Vihar. But I saw a crowd of people in front of a building and one guy screaming out numbers so I guessed this was it. Yes! This place doesnt have a board carrying its name. Anyway, I was kind of impressed also and thought it is kind of stupid also. I told him my name and he told me my number in line is 25, the last number to go in was 7. I understood it will take me a good time to enter the place. But we waited and got a table 45 minutes later. We sat and the waiter asked us what we wanted, I asked for the menu card and he gave me a stare as if I asked for one of his kidneys. He gave me one after 5 minutes since he was too busy serving the crowd. The place was noisy and filled with families. Anyway, ordered for dosas and idlis and vadas and two mazaas, had our food. Honestly, the food was standard south Indian food and my servant at home makes better dosas and idlis and sambhar at home. After I was done, I asked him for tissues and he pointed in the direction of the wash basin.
1 point for food and 1 point for hygiene. Rest is big zero, so that is all this place gets 2 out of 5.

Situated in one of the most isolated locales of central Kolkata, this place is literally a hidden gem. Keeping a GPS map handy is strongly recommended. But once u enter the place n have their food, all ur complaints will b at rest. The masala dosa is just finely cooked with a tangy n spicy potato filling. The Vadas are crispy and mouth watering so are the sambhar n coconut chatni. M definitely going back for more items.

On Sundays the restaurant is crowded, you may have to wait for some time. But its worth. You will definitely enjoy with your family and friends. The rates are also reasonable. Overall I am competely satisfied.

Jyoti Vihar makes me nostalgic...reminding me of the innumerable times I used to go there during my college days. Many,many,many seasons have passed since those days but this place seems to have frozen in time. It still seems to be the same...with one or two staff also same albeit definitely older like me. They've retained their high food standard as well. Whatever you have here I've always found it to be very good. I specially love their sada dosa and feel that it's the best of all the South Indian joints I've tried. Idlis are extremely soft and go well with chutney &sambar. Their filter coffee served in the old style of steel glass and katora is aromatic and just great. The place is crowded most of the times and one has to generally wait but the tasty food you get after waiting makes up for the inconvenience. It's the must go to place for south indian food if you are in the vicinity.

Its one my favourite restaurants when it comes to eat great South Indian food. The place is literally hidden and one has to find it on Ho Chi Minh Sarani. Its purely a South Indian restaurant offering varieties of Dosa and filtered coffee. The best thing about this place is they give double Sambar and double Chutney when they serve the dosa. If you are tired of having dosa then go for idli and uttapam. But my all time favourite is paper ghee masala dosa which is enough to satisfy my appetite for delicious dosa.

Location: Near US Consulate in Ho-Chi - Minh Sarani, ever the building. The stairs on the left,take you to Jyoti Vihar .

Ambience: We went for breakfast. Mostly college going crowd. Nothing fancy about the place. 


FOOD: ordered a plate of Idli, Paper Sada Dosa , Masala Dosa and Pepsi. 

Paper Sada Dosa was beyond excellance. Wafer thin and amazingly Crispy. Loved it. 

Idli was one of the best I've had here , in Kolkata. Buttery,soft,melt in mouth. Very very good. 

Slightly disappointed with the Masala Dosa. It wasn't crispy at all. Was a little soggy. Masala was okayish. 

NEVER have the so called "Special Chutney" they have in their menu. It's the same Coconut chutney with extra "toppings". Please don't fall for names.

A word for Management : Please keep a check on your staffs so that they don't ask for tips as soon as you enter the eatery. It's irritating. Else, All good. Keep it up!

Located near the metro plaza shopping complex, it always the best attraction to shop and have food at jyoti Vihar. However you will definitely have to wait for 10-15 mins min. But trust me the wait is worth it. Must visit. Awesome south Indian food. Ambience is not quite like a restra however it's a decent and a family place to dine in.

Food: here it gets real exciting. The food is of top quality. Paper dosas are really thin n crispy. Infinite amount of sambar n chatni on offer. Loved their special chutney, specially the texture it offers. Dahi vada is garnished with chilli n curry leaves. Price on the heavier side but its worth every penny.
A huge thumbs up with no complains whatsoever. A real hidden gem.

One of the best places in town for lip smacking South Indian food at reasonable prices.

The location is convenient: next to the American Embassy on Ho Chi Minh Saraini opposite the newly opened Gabbar but there's no parking. I had once parked my bike outside and had the most irritating time arguing in Hindi with people hell bent on speaking Bengali. You also need to wait for a minimum of 20 mins on weekdays, given the sheer number of offices in the locality.

That aside, the food is a delight. Medu vadas or milk upma in particular sets you up nicely to gobble down the amazing Dosas, whatever you order. A must visit!

Tip: they have a special chutney, strictly on rrequest. Its mind blowing. Also, if you can speak Tamizh, you're golden.

Low in budget but great in taste it appeals and caters to people of all walks of life. Its ambience is simple and cutlery cheap but the food they serve shall make it a must go for south indian cuisine in kolkata.

Have been going to this place since i was like 10yrs old and i fail to understand how do they maintain the same quality & taste all thru these years. The best place for a lazy sunday lunch. But the only draw back of this place is that it shuts @6pm due to the american embassy near it. But highly recommended for everyone who likes south indian food.

Located at Ho Chi Minh Sarani, can be a little problem for you to find a place to park your car, but suggest you to use the Metro shopping if it's convenient for you to walk some 200m. With the softest and best idlis, and lip smacking South Indian dishes, am sure you will just not want to leave the table till every little part of you is satisfied that you ate here. 

It's not like modern standards, it's the old joint types, yet people also wait for upto an hour or more to get tables. If you are in a big group, God save you from dying of hunger., you have to be patient. Opens late on Sunday's so you can cue up early if you are game for it.

I have no clue as to why it's so overrated. 
Its famous for its idli, I have no idea why, because I find idli actually tasteless. 
The dosa is okay. 
The prices are EXTREMELY high for South Indian food. 
The good part is, the sambhar has a lot of veggies and the chutney isn't watery. 
Honestly, no need to visit it unless you can find taste in idli. 
Also, it closes at 5pm. So watch your time too.

I have never had such amazing dosa in the city. The taste is so much out of the world ! Also, the service is sober and fast. The onion chutni, the desi butter and ghee inside the crispy dosa,the masala that they serve separately, the sambar and the coconut chutni, OHMYGOD.. I can eat there forever. This place looks unimpressive but has some pull theory. It makes sure you dont just visit this place once ! The coffee takes you to a different world. The uttapam, the idli, its mouthwatering. This is one of my favorite south indian food corners.

Not a single dish disappointed us. Onion uttapam, idli, vada and authentic south indian kaffee. I had an extra bowl of sambar simply loved it.Four of us were there and bill was only Rs 477 .Bole toh pura paisa vasool ;) 
If you wish to try the special dish thats available only on weekdays.

Nothing great about this place. I had heard a lot about this dosa place and hence decided to check it out. Unlike others, my experience wasn't great.

You will have to wait a little for getting a table. Fine. We can do that for good food.
Service was decent. Waiters were quick.
But food wasn't up to the mark. It was a pretty ordinary onion masala dosa with half of it stuck to the plate. Ordinary masala loaded with loads and loads of onion (my bad I ordered it. But trust me it was too much).
As I was sitting close to the reception, people lined up behind me for getting a table. It made me uncomfortable. No one likes people peaking at their plate from behind.

I might go again to try something else and sit somewhere else. But I am not hopeful.

A time tested, south indian restaurant which didn't change a lot over time. If you're a interior-ambiance person, you'll be dissappointed. The place is simple and aims at quality food, friendly staff & quick service. Next time you go shopping at Metro Plaza, play guest to this nearby restaurant.

Without a doubt, the finest South Indian fare upwards of the Vindhyas!
I have been visiting this place for over 25 years now - since my college days; and practically nothing has changed - be it their unmatched taste, most of their super-efficient staff... or even my craving to be back!
I am yet to have an experience there that is not memorable, however rushed I may have been. And each time I go there, apart from being one of their most recognised patrons, they sure know how to comfort me - their staff are always as cheerful as the birds!
The dosas are crisp, light and out-of-this world. The masala inside cannot be compared with any other. With a generous chunk of molten white butter, they can transport you to another world. And their endless helpings of sambhar and chutney are simply orgasmic! You can keep asking for more and they happily replenish those tiny bowls!Incidentally, their sambhar has fixed several sore throats of mine and killed many flu'ish fevers, so I also believe it is food from the Gods and pray they don't ever change it!
The upma is to die for - with just the right 'khela' of a shred of ginger or tiny slice of green chilli appearing just when you think of them! Their freshly-fried sada vadas have both in almost every bite, like a bonus! The masala vadas are incomparably crisp and even their dahi vadas have a generous smattering of tiny pieces of fried chillies and ginger; P.S. Always have them with a sprinkling of red chilli (Psst! For the uninitiated, it is the better half of the salt-shaker).
I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that this is not just comfort food that I could have at any time of the day, but Jyoti Vihar is one of the proud reasons I chose to live on in Calcutta!

Good Udupi restaurant. We had two meals here - evening snack on 1st May and Breakfast on 3rd May. Seemed very popular with the number of people around. The sambar was "different" than a Typical Udupi - Higher Dal component than tomatoes. But good food and good service.

If you are visiting Kolkata and you ever get a craving for South Indian Snacks then you must definitely drop by this place.

Jyoti Vihar as a whole personifies the fundamentals of KISS (Keep it Simple Silly) and elegance in one go. One will not find any extravagance in its ambience but yet Jyoti Vihar will make you visit it again and again and all credit goes its food that it caters.

A look at the menu will explain that its short and simple. They will serve you 3 classes of items that defines South India completely in the North: Idly, Vada and Dosa. 
The Vada is served Hot and Crispy. 
The Dosa is as thin as it gets. 
The Idly is soft.

Things to Definitely Try:
- Masala Vada (Crispy Dal Vadas) - A speciality of this place
- Special Coconut Chutney
- Tomato Chutney

Do top it off with a traditional filter coffee.

Food - 9/10
Service - 8/10
Ambience - 8/10
Value for Money - 9/10
Recommend to someone - Definitely Yes.
DoV - 2nd May. 2015

I will be visiting this place whenever I drop by to Kolkata.

Located near the American Embassy, this place serves you really good South Indian food at reasonable prices. There's no signboard so it's kinda hard to find. But once you're near Ho Chi Minh sarani, you can ask your way to the place quite easily. 
If you like your dosas and your sambar vadas you should definitely make your way down here. It's a legendary place here in Kolkata and for good reason.

I really couldn't understand what the fuss was about regarding this place. Maybe I had gone with a lot of expectations!  Anyways,  all in all, am not going back there again given other  different  options nearby!

Being a kid all I heard from my Dad who was an ex student of Xavier's Kolkata was that this is indeed one of the only places serving most authentic and superb South Indian Food.

To this I always had it bookmarked on my tobe visited places. 

The day I walked in to this place I was expecting a lot out of it. And to be honest a father is already aware of what a son would like and dislike. 

It was bang on and it was a place worth visiting. Amazing idli wada and the dosas were simply amazing.

I loved the way I was served as well and the people serving were generous too. I would love to visit the place over and over again the times I visit Kolkata.

Very tricky place to find, me and my friends literally got confused of it's location. Small place but clean and service is really fast, which I kind of like. We ordered Paper Masala Dosa (which was crunchy enough) and Masala Dosa, it has a typical south Indian flavor with delicious Sambar and potato filling was decent but little sticky (not in a bad way though). The menu contain most of the south Indian dishes which I will sure give a try in my next visit. And yes, do have a Coffee here, it is surprisingly good and you will love to have more. I already been here twice because of the taste and their service, which is awfully good. Based on my experience here, I will give it 3.5 in my rating. It is one of the fewer places where you can get south Indian filter coffee, served in a small metal glass in small metal cup.

Jyoti Vihar is an extremely popular place serving traditional Southern fare. Its situated next to the US Consulate so parking becomes a problem but that shouldnt deter you.I would say one of the Best little places for Dosas,Idlis Vadas etc. The atmosphere is like a Beehive--really BIZZZZZZZYY. Fantastic service- the attendants virtually read your mind and the crisp vadas,snowhite soft idlis arrive in a jiffy. Superb taste--absolutely like Ammas would make at home in Chennai or Madurai !! The South Thali is super and go fo it if feeling hungry--make sure you finish with dahisadam and Mysore Pak.If fond of such food donot hesitate to go there inspite of a little wait and the slightly small space--but spotlessly clean and fly free.

Jyoti Vihar is a great place to have south Indian. It is located in Ho Chi Minn sarani opposite Amigos and is very popular for the south indian that they serve here. Although it was a little difficult to locate since the entrance consist of a small door and no signboard, but once you eat the food, it doesn't even matter. And when you arrive at this place in the afternoon, you have to wait in a queue before you get a seat. 
Food: The food is awesome. My favorite is masala dosa which I always add up with their special onion chutney. It's delicious. The idli is soft and spongy and delicious. And then, their is filter coffee. I make sure I have the coffee everytime I go to this place. 
Ambiance: If you are looking for a good ambiance, well this is not the place for you. 
Hygiene: Though small, this place is hygienic as the tables are clean and so are their floors.
 Jyoti vihar promise you good food and lives up to it. :)

One of the best South Indian food restaurants in Kolkata. Always full of customers, sometimes you have to wait in queue to get your table. The ambience is nothing great to talk about. But the test is awesome! Idli is soft & other must to have options are Medu Wada, Masala Wada, Crispy Paper Dosa, Uttappum etc. They serve sambhar & coconut chutney in number of small bowls. Their special chutney is must to have with whatever food you are having. It's different & delicious. Cost wise, it's reasonable!

The place is tucked away in an old building and surprisingly lacked any signage outside to indicate the restaurant. Hi-five if you missed and crossed the hotel! :D I remember how we guys ran our lungs out to get to this place before they close out. The kitchen closes early (6.30-7.00 pm) which is absolutely ridiculous.

It's a South Indian tiffin centre. Which means ambiance should be the last thing on your mind. You should expect a brightly lit place, metal chairs and wooden tables, a lot of chatter around, waiters regrouping often to talk plus the smell of sambar/dosa wafting in the air.

Coming to the business end of the review as Dhoni would put it, the food was good. Dosas were crisp (2 thumbs up), Vadas were crunchy outside and soft inside and the idlis were soft and nice. The sambar wasn't the best in Kolkata (I feel Banana Leaf serves better ones but this varies from person to person). 

The service was swift and like any other tiffin centre. But the fact that a restaurant closes at 6.30pm is absolutely unacceptable! 

Worth giving a try. Who knows you might like their Sambar unlike me!

When you're craving for South Indian food and you're just wondering which hotel to walk in to, consider this 'shack', because it's too small and clustered to be a proper hotel. It's the BEST south Indian you can have in Calcutta. Probably better than South itself!  Try it once. It will probably become your Sunday brunch adda!

Went there at lunch time on 5th December. We were 2 people. First we were made to sit on a table where one person was already having lunch. We ordered south indian food. The chutney was watery, tasted so so. The Vada was hard as if it was fried for a second time. Meanwhile, the other person on our table finished his lunch, and while we were still eating the cleaner started cleaning half of the table. This was shocking as we still did not complete eating. We told him to stop cleaning but he didn't listen. Pathetic.

Great place for authentic siuth indian food. I went there few years back and liked it. This time i again decided to go but did not even remember the exact location or even the name of the restaurant. I asked a shopowner and he guided me to the place.

No change there. All the same as it was few years back including decor (actually no decor), no menu card, limited items which the person serving you wd tell you, 20-30 mins waiting downstairs etc etc.

But all this is fine for food, great food and quick service.

I go here once in 15 days with friends..great south indian joint...the prices are very very reasonable...u will most probably have to wait on every weekday during lunch hours to find a seat...it still serves the traditional sout indian dishes...so if anybody is looking for fancy items like dhaniya dosa or cheese dosas will not find those here..but its simple items are so well made that once you have them you will not regret that you came here...its food is very light compared to other famous south indian joints in kolkata..dont forget to order the red chutney which you dont get in many places in kolkata....

Jyoti Vihar used to be my favourite veg food joint during college days when i used to visit British Library often. I loved their masala dosa which was served with the yummy coconut chatni, the delicious sambhar and gun powder and garic chatni. This place gives you a feel of typical South Indian tiffin joints where you go to have dosa, idli, vada and coffee. I love the authentic ¬†tadka they put in the coconut chatni. The mustard seeds and the fenugreek seeds adds to the eseence of the South Indian food here. The pricing goes well with the food and you will not regret a bit.

I have been having food from Jyoti Vihar for the last 6 years now.Its one of my favourite South Indian food joint..Their paper sada/masala dosa is absolutely amazing and the coconut chutney is very yum..I find the chutney so great that I can eat it on its own..Apart from this the mixed uttapam, dahi vada and the urad vadas are also very good.Jyoti vihar serves as one of the best lunch options for me as my office is close by.On most such days we end up ordering from here as the food is delicious , healthy , and complete value for money..

Prices- making pocket happy.

Ideal for situations when you're really hungry & do not care about the interiors or ambience. A fresh south indian breakfast will definately be a good start for your day! 
I would love to see more variety in dosas here, as my favourite mysore masala was missing. Apart from that, perfect to go with your group of friends and not be bothered about making too much noise! :D

Discovered this place on zomato and I'm glad¬†I did!! For I have a place for my south Indian food cravings!!Two hungry souls who skipped their lunch barged into this place and came out happily satisfied. It is easily locatable on the Ho Chi Minch road and the seating is on the first floor with AC, we quickly settled down and ordered for Vada-Sambar, and butter masala dosas.We chose for vada dipped in sambar and not vada and sambar separate, an i must say i had heaven on my plate. Then arrived their butter masala dosas with a large dump of butter, tasted crisp and nice. And to finish off our happy meal we took filter coffee, perfect blend and perfect aroma!Dont look for ambience in here, it is for hungry souls with pocket friendly menu and great taste!I definitely see myself barging in here often, Being a south Indian¬†I give a thumbs up to this place!

Jyoti Vihar is one of the legendary famous places in Kolkata. It has good and decent food but the service is ordinary. The ambience is below average. The location is crowded with no parking or other basic needs. I would Iike to ignore ambience and service if the food was out of world. But the food is off course better than most South Indian places in Kolkata but not extra ordinary. This place on the list of the great known places of past which needs to wake up and not live only on old laurels..

Location: Ho Chi Minh Sarani 

This place needs no introduction. 
Is famous for it's south Indian cuisine! 
All South Indian lovers if you haven't visited this place, you've surely missed on something.
Visit highly recommended. 

Coming to the point, 

- Plain Dosa 
Soft or crisp, whichever way you want you'll be served. 
Made to choice. 
Great. 

- Masala Dosa 
The filling is tasty and the potatoes well mashed and saut√©d. 

- Paper Plain Dosa
Not that thin, yet crisp and non greasy.

- Onion Masala Dosa
The usual masala topped with raw thinly sliced onion filled inside the dosa. Delicious.

- Idli & Vada 
Melt-in-the-mouth (soft) and crunch-in-the-mouth (crisp) respectively. 
Great. 

- Filter Coffee
Strong & Aromatic! Simply Love it.

- Onion chutney 
Spicy and perfectly grinded. 

- Chutney and Sambhar 
One the best I have ever had in a south Indian joint. 

Prices are friendly to the pocket. 

The staff is prompt, efficient and courteous. 

A little snag on the hygiene level tab.
Needs little improvement. Tables should be cleaned in a manner that no marks of dropped food is left. Noticed this ona few tables out of the lot.

Overall a good experience. :-)

Small entrance which you will surely miss if you arent from Kolkata. And if you are from Kolkata you surely would know Jyoti Vihar. Anytime you go you will have a long waiting line. Food is good and fresh and you will surely love the wide variety of Dosas it has to offer. Do try the Dhaniya Masala Dosa. Ambience is so so and nothing special, Costing is fairly low and light on the pocket. So if you are around the Camac Street and Maidan and want a good cheap place to have your meal drop by at Jyoti Vihar

Sharing the road with American embassy, Situated on Ho chi Minn Sarani, Jyoti Vihar stands tall , in all it's simplicity providing one of the most famous and widely eaten Indian cuisine- South Indian. As you enter the premise and ascend to the dining area , your senses are enticed by the smell of ghee, which is the core element of the cuisine. The ambience is basic but absolutely complementary to the overall experience. Be it idly, vada, dosa or pongal, parotha or variety of rice , the food is scrumptious . Your meal is served hot and at a speed faster than you can consume it. At the end of the meal, the diner is left licking their fingers, literally !

I have been to Jyoti Vihar many times, and I felt that I had to finally review it. If you are a true foodie and a sucker for great tasting South Indian food, Jyoti Vihar should definitely be on your list. 

Do not judge the place by looking at the dingy building or even the ambience, because the food definitely makes up for it. 

The service is fast and also efficient.  We ordered a couple of plates of Idli and Vada (1st thing we order every time). The idlis were nice, soft and quite tasty. The Vadas were also really good. The special onion chutney is also really good and you should try it.

Then we ordered Ghee Plain Dosa, Onion Masala Dosa, Onion Uttapam and a plate of their special spicy masala. The food was really good. The Dosa's were nice and soft yet crisp. And you should have seen the amount of Ghee on the super thin Paper dosa. The uttapam was good too. Their masala was too good and we sprinkled it on to almost everything from Dosas to Idlis and the uttapam as well.

The food always had been, and still is really good and if you do not care about the ambience and also don't mind about 10 minutes of waiting you definitely should visit Jyoti Vihar.

Now this is actual south indian food... though this place is not open for dinner and more so going there for lunch is a rarity for me and sundays is just not possible for this place due to the crowd.... but given the choice and the mood. I would love to visit this place again and again.

The Idlis is my high point out here, the idlis are so soft and hot that it melts into your mouth which is again something no one else can give you other than a Jyoti Vihar.... you have to have the samber Idli here to understand the concept of the south and the eating style.... the idli just breaks to pieces in the samber which is just amazing....

the Paper Dosa for me is another highlight... they make it huge and oh soo soo crispy just the way it is supposed to be.... makes a fun eat altogether....

the samber is just amazing and the chutney is really good... for people who like thick chutney this place has the special chutney at an extra charge....

the place is super cheap and they still give amazing quality food and its always always fresh.... this place in all my years has never let me down ever.... 

Try the other kinds of chutney which they offer which are really good. I just wish this place would give something like a rasam as well which would be an icing on the cake... 

Please dont expect a lavish joint as this place is mediocre but the food is just amazing...

Probably the best place to have south indian food according to me. Its so so difficult to find a table on weekends (lunch time, as it closes by 6). Ambience has been the same for years (the Air conditioners have finally been replaced after all these years).
Food is top notch. Try the butter masala dosa. The sambhar they serve is really well prepared with a tinge of sweetness, which I actually like. Order the Onion and Special chutney to go with it (trust me you'll not regret it). Service is quick (as is expected of most South Indian restaurants). 
Overall, I'll highly recommend this place if you want to have authentic south Indian cuisine.

Been here a couple of times before, and went again for lunch today, so finally decided to write down the review!
Reached with a colleague at about 2, and yes waited for about 20 mins to be seated, which is I guess is the most irritating part about this place.
After we were seated the waiter took another 10 minutes to get to our table so again minus points for that!
Once we placed the order, they were served pretty quick.
We tried the curd vada for the first time. It was really good. The vadas were nice & crispy, the curd thick, sweet & sour and the tempering adding the right bit of spice.
Next we ordered the mixed uttapam, which was a bit of a disappointment as the tomatoes used in it were at least a day old and squidgy, so had to pick them out. We had the onion chutney which was quite nice and spicy. 
To alter the after taste of the tomato we ordered a plain dosa which was nice & crisp and of the right thickness. 
The sambhar was great as usual, would have rated it a bit higher if not for the delay in taking order and the tomatoes!

This is the best south indian joint in the city.Period! Nothing has changed about this place over the years and that is  the best part about it. There is this great feeling of nostalgia every time you come here. Whether it was a morning brunch after bunking classes at St.Xaviers or a super quick meal as a kid with your parents after shopping at AC or VARDAAN market. This is still one of those rare joints where the waiting queue at times goes  out all the way to the pavement. All the waiters there are as old as the joint is. The service is brisk and the food is yummy! 

Their Sambhar Idli ( idli dipped in copious quantity of sambhar) is a must have. Other things on the must have list are- 
1. Dal vada
2. Masala dosa with butter ( its homemade white butter) 
3. Mixed utthapam
4. Upma ( the best you can get)
5. filter coffee.
6. Special coconut chutney, Onion and tomato chutney.
7. Dahi vada.

Jyoti vihar is a Kolkata institution. Many of us have grown up on the delectable idly served here. 

I ate in at jyoti vihar today after a long time. The idlys still melt in your mouth and the butter dosa in your hand. They have added an onion chutney which was ok. 

Still a great place to have a good nice Sunday lunch with family or a quick office day lunch.

Just paces off the American Embassy, this south indian joint is nestled in the serenity of the Ho Chi Minh Sarani. We bristled looking for Jyoti Vihar, hoping to see a signboard or at least a hint of it. Being not able to find it, I tried it on GMaps only to be informed that I was at the right place. Baffled & confused, I still couldn't find a sign. Then I went to what looked like a small hotel hoping to ask them of the place, only to be assured that I was standing at the right place.

Well then we curiously went upstairs, and the sight reassured me of us being in the right place. The interior was pretty ordinary. By the ambiance of this place I could make out that the place was packed with regulars, while I started to feel like an outsider. Without wasting any time we put down our order: sada dosa, masala dosa and sada vada. The food arrived in no time and so hungry was I that I broke down to it immediately.

Now coming to the taste the masala of the dosa tasted pretty good, but I would have liked the crust to be a bit softer. The accompaniments of the sambar & chutney were good too. The vada for me was too slippery, which I don't like at all. I like the outer skin to be a bit coarse. All said and done it was nonetheless a pleasant experience. 

But I didn't experience anything extraordinary as mentioned by the other reviewers. And for me Anand is by far a better place both in terms of food quality and ambiance.

visited this joint a couple of days ago with my cousins.. the famed aroma near us embassy guided us to this joint. the sada vada tastes the same as was years ago. ditto for masala dosa. ditto for idly... even the interiors has been left un touched over the years.. however, what has changed , or rather needs to be changed , is the attitude of waiters and cleaners..no sooner the last portion goes into the mouth , the cleaner jumps in to pick up the plate . even the waiters hardly waits to take the order.. it appears they are wearing roller skates. for food, we cannot complain.. yummy. cost of two would be 250.

This is one of my go to places for quick South Indian.
Do not be mistaken by the dingy building and the nondescript features. This a gem of a place. I have tried 
1. Mixed Uttapam
2. Sambar Idli
3. Plain Butter Dosa
4. Ghee masala Dosa
All were quick hot and delicious ! This joint is unpretentious and serves up one of the most authentic and best south Indian food ! The dosas are light and crispy and the Idlis and soft and not very heavy and the Uttapams are just brilliant ! 
The ambiance granted is not great at all but with food this good and so easy on the pocket a true foodie won't mind ! :)

My new year's eve lunch was definitely better than my last visit. After a harrowing time finding a parking spot and finally succeeding, my daughter, wife and I walked across to Jyoti Vihar. There was a long queue, and we had to sit content for almost 30 minutes with the token provided.

The restaurant itself is small and cramped. Tables are on the smaller side, and there is no cosiness or warmth in the place. Everything is crowded, busy and always on the move. The atmosphere made me deduct some points.

We ordered two vadas. They were good, warm, crisp and tasty. The chutney was decent and the sambhar good (I'm no big sambhar fan, but my wife said it was great). We had ordered the special chutney, which made it oh so much better. The drier, crispier chutney, which they charge Rs 30 extra for, is highly recommended.

Then came the dosa, My wife asked for a ghee paper masala while I opted for the ghee butter masala. They were good! Though I personally feel the potato robs much of the taste and makes a dosa soggy (prompting me to dump a sizeable portion of it on my better half's plate:)). The dosa was crip, and tasty, completely without that sour annoying after-taste many places dish out. We asked for the coffee, and I must say it is one of the best I have had. Strong and well flavoured, prompting us both to ask for refills.

Service was quick and efficient. The person serving our table actually got a third plate for my daughter (with a vada from one of the plates on it), which I found to be a very warm gesture.

That is not to say the place does not have its ills. The decor could do with an overhaul. More spaciousness would be great. The steps to the first floor are steep. There are no paper tissues on the table. But then again, Jyoti Vihar focuses on providing good food efficiently and consistently, and they deliver.

Visited this place today for late Sunday breakfast.
Service is prompt and prices are reasonable.
Loved the hot idlis, sada vadas and filter coffee.
Setting is basic but no complaints.

Definitely a place for regular visits to have South Indian fare in a no fuss ambiance.

Had some confusion in locating the place as no sign board was visible  outside the restaurant.
The management should put up a temporary signboard till the replacement is installed.

I swear I should hang my head in shame for not reviewing Jyoti Bihar till now. It has saved me a number of times when I was super hungry and wanted something FAST and freshly made. As this was near my college and later my workplace, I would just enter and order my favorite - ghee masala dosa, and they would get it for me within 5-10 minutes of ordering it, every time. The smell of the ghee is absolutely intoxicating, and the reason why I have actually tried out very few things from their menu is simply because I was totally hooked onto the smell of ghee in my food, and mostly ordered stuff with copious amounts of ghee in it. On a recent venture, I decided to go for something else apart from the ghee masala dosa. However, I could not go past the mixed utthapam, and I was glad I did try it. Both the items were piping hot when they came to our table, and we consumed it within 5 minutes, as we were pretty hungry (yep ... the best sauce). The price is very reasonable, and our meal, along with two coffees and 1 bottle of mineral water was under 200/- which was absolutely perfect.

‚ÄúThe Best South Indian Food Joint in Kolkata?!?‚Äù

3.5 out of 5

A South Indian Restaurant that can easily be compared to YUMMRAJ‚Äôs favorite South Indian Restaurant, Murugan Idly Chennai is Jyoti Vihar, Kolkata. Located at Ho Chi Minh Sarani, near Theatre Road, the place is always full of shoppers, families, office goers and students. The secret to this is the superior quality of South Indian food they serve here.

Jyoti Vihar is a small South Indian restaurant which now is a part of kolkata‚Äôs heritage. The vintage (in the true sense of the word!) interiors of Jyoti Vihar with mosaic flooring, the wood paneling and old style table and chairs will remind you of your childhood days, probably because they are the same chairs you sat on then! This eatery breathes nostalgia, great memories and heritage in its every corner. If you don‚Äôt believe me, ask any regular here and they will tell you.

Well, their service is quite fast and courteous. The restaurant is clean and hygienic. They serve delicious South Indian food at slightly steeper than earlier prices ‚Äì I know as I visit this restaurant every week! During lunch time, at around 1:00 in the afternoon the place full of people, and you WILL have to wait for your turn and get a token.

Their idly with sambhar (that they serve hot) is fresh, soft and beautifully steamed ‚Äì some say it is the best in Calcutta if not the country (I‚Äôve eaten all over the south and believe me, it is not an exaggerated claim at all)! Their wadas are crispy outside and soft inside. The ghee Butter masala Dosa they make will drive you crazy, and is easily the best butter sada dosa one can have this side of town. Jyoti Vihar serves you the most piping hot food - their milk upma and the dahi vada are outstanding!  The coconut chutney is excellent. It is thick and grainy, topped with roasted urad dal. Their paper dosa‚Äôs are crispy and light on your stomach though not their strong point. One special mention here - they also serve no-onion sambhar on request, so if you don‚Äôt like onion you can always ask for their no onion sambhar.

To complete your South Indian meal, they serve some nice filter coffee as well. I would highly recommend Jyoti Vihar to all food lovers. Even if you don‚Äôt like South Indian food, try South Indian food here - you may just fall in love with South Indian cuisine.

Been a fan of this place for decades but somehow on my previous trips just didn't have time for it.

This time I did and so glad!

What we ordered -

Idli
Upma
Masala dosa


Needless to say South Indian fare here is by far one of the best in the city. The coconut chutney is specially delicious! Also try the very interesting onion chutney!

Looking forward to savouring the food here!!

So, we were looking for a place to grab a quick bite near Camac street, when I remembered someone having recommended Jyoti Vihar....so following the address on Zomato, we landed up here. Now, there's no sign board outside the place but when we went up the stairs, and the smell of South Indian goodness hit us, we knew we were in the right place ! :)

The place is very simple and clean enough, but there's no decor as such....but to me, the only thing that matters is good food ! Now, this being my first visit to this place, I can only comment on whatever little we tried. We ordered the Sada Dosa, Masala Dosa and a plate of Sada Vada. The food arrived pretty fast. The Dosa was not as crispy as I would have liked it to be....but overall, tasted nice with the coconut chutney ! My friend informed me that the Masala of the Dosa was really good although the Dosa itself left more to be desired. The Sasa Vada again was quite average and I really didn't like the big pieces of chili in them. 

I also think that the food served was a bit cold....Now, comparisons with other South Indian restaurants are bound to appear, and personally I would any day suggest "Anand" over this place. Overall, this is a good place to get filing food, but nothing much to keep you coming back ! 3 stars from me.

I'm huge fan/admirer of South Indian Restaurants and anything below par does not go down all that well with me. Jyoti Vihar is one of the reasons why the bar is so high. 

Jyoti Vihar, located at Ho Chi Minh Sarani, right beside the American Centre. 
The place might not look all that convincing, and the stairway to the eating area all that comfortable, but we made ourselves into the restaurant and the Ac added to our comfort. At once, the waiters dressed in traditional south indian attire, came to take our order. 
We ordered a Ghee Masala Dosa, and Coffee owing to the wondrous coffee they make down south. To our surprise, the order arrived in an exact 7 mins, instantly exhibiting its charms. The aroma that was coming out of the dosa, for a split second transported me to the southern shores, an eye opener al-right! 
As i took a bite, the dosa was crisp, even though we didn't order a paper dosa, it in a lot of ways looked and tasted like one! The generous two small bowls of sambhar and chutney were rich and very very tasty. the Sambhar was thick, had onnions and that south indian tangy hit that you dont expect. but Jyoti Vihar is right up there!
The quantity of the masala inside, i felt was a little less, though. It was cooked well, and had a steamy flavour with a gingery feel to it, which I enjoyed.

Lastly, the coffee. Oh, the COFFEE! Heavenly, is less a word to describe it. Served in the traditional South Indian manner where  you have to pour the coffee into the bowl and drink it. The flavour was sinful, the taste is still latching itself in my tongue, i haven't had this good a coffee in a long long time now. 

Slightly, on the expensive side, given the fact that its South Indian. But you should not really care to pay a little more, more a little piece of South India that you take with yourself when you walk out of Jyoti Vihar. 
Visit it, again. And again.

I was introduced to Jyoti Vihar by a friend who vouched that this joint perhaps serves the best South Indian in that area ! Camac Street being a very frequent hangout area , Ho Chi Minh Sarani was not too far and one random day an empty and hungry stomach took me there- since then there was no looking back and Jyoti Vihar was soon in my favourite list!

Before going to details about this restaurant- let me mention about this cuisine first! I am an ardent lover of South Indian food because of various reasons and one such reason tops the list ‚Äì Ive never seen a cuisine as humble and as Light as this..! You‚Äôll find South Indian anywhere in India- right from Kashmir to Kanyakumari ..! With such perfectly balanced spices ‚Äì south Indian cuisine is always very light on your stomach . Its filler and the best part is ‚Äì you can have it at any time of the day- Breakfast, Lunch, Supper or Dinner ! More than anything else ‚Äì I belive South Indian cuisine has gone beyond geographical boundaries and unites our culinary delights. 

Coming to Jyoti Vihar now , here‚Äôs my take:

With a very humble ambience , which is not to starry ‚Äì a fleet of stairs lead you to the dining Area. Simple chairs and tables on a mosaic Floor base and mostly crowded at all times ‚Äì you‚Äôll often find too much noise all around. They try thier best to keep it neat and clean at all times , but then too much crowd always doesnt leave scope for that.
You may have to wait to get your place very often but every minute of wait is worth it ! 

The staff have stuck to this place for quite long and hence you can sense the humility on thier faces. They know thier stuff well and are ready to help. 
The Menu is limited to typical South Indian Options with a variety of Dosas, Uttapams, Idlis and Medu Wadas ! They have few other options , but very limited to Curd Rice and other Rice preparations ‚Äì that too on some particular days, so you might not get them at all times !

Service is Fast and efficient ! 

Some of my personal Favourites and popular picks :

>>Ghee Paper Butter Sada Dosa : Life could only get Blissful in a second if you‚Äôre ready to gorge on this high Calorie preperation! The Dosa is thin and Crisp , with a Khakra like texture. Its has the taste of Both the Butter and the Ghee which makes this Dosa Lip Smacking . And let me tell you- thrs no Dosa so fancy that could beat the taste of a sada Dosa ‚Äì and if its crisp + butter + Ghee > It couldnt get better !

>>Ghee Masala Dosa : Im a big fan of thier Ghee preperation- when they write/ mention Ghee its real Ghee business and the aroma of Ghee in any dish is unmatchable and thats what makes me have this time and gain. Thier Masala is perfect. The smell and aroma of Curry Leaves, onions and Mustard tadka is evident from every bite.

>>Idlis : Soft and Fluffy- melts in your mouth ! If dipped in Sambhar- its awesome :)

>>Medu wadas: Thier Medu wadas is testimony to the fact that they are indeed Calcuttas most popular South Indian restaurant . They fry the wadas just to perfection- I mean , the Browness of the Wada is even and uniform , its crisp and perfectly cooked ‚Äì In short : I louve them !

>>Special Chutney : Its a must have ‚Äì aromatic and delicious.

>>Filter Coffee : I believe any south Indian meal is incomplete without the authentic Filter Coffee. Please let them know whether you‚Äôre looking for srtong or Mild, with less or More sugar. At Jvihar , the Coffee is just perfect , be it taste or as an accompaniment to your meal.

>>Onion Uttapam : This is again one of thier best preparations. They are generous when it comes to using Onions , its perfectly cooked with ghee/butter and the base is spongy and Fluffy .

Thier Sambhar needs special mention. Its tangy, spicy , with a hint of sweetness and the perfect amount of Tamarind . Having been to many South Indian Joints by now- I understand how Sambhar plays such an important role in defining the taste and quality standards of a South Indian Eating Joint . At Jyoti Vihar , they are perfect with the Sambhar and Kudos to them for that !

Another thing worth mentioning is that the Food at Jyoti Vihar is always served piping Hot ! Very less time is taken for the order and food is served after a decent wait ,at most times its quick and fast !

Jyoti Vihar has been serving food , much before the time I was even born and it lives up to its culinary heritage ! Ive had lots of memories with Friends and Families and of course a strong connection with thier food ‚Äì which gets me back to this place time and again.

Recommended- Highly..!!

I'm an idli fanatic and I can swear that the idlis here are one of the most satisfying idlis available in town. I've only every had idlis when I go to to Jyoti Vihar (or any south Indian restaurant for that matter) so I wouldn't be able to tell you about the dosas and the other stuff. I am getting cravings for their food even as I'm writing this. The service is so so....it's almost always crowded, by executives during weekdays and shoppers on weekends. Expect to wait a while to get a table. Oh and the vadas are excellent too.

Jyoti vihar is a vintage south indian food joint located in ho chi minh sarani opposite the amigos.  Its got no competition within a  3 km radius except a super snack bar which is relatively new in that area. Everything is the same about the restaurant as it was when i was a child be it the tables, flooring, seating, staff except for the ever increasing rush at the place. 

The staff do not spend much time taking order and do not prefer repeated orders from a single table unless you are a regular, known face.  The idly, vadas, dosas are all very hot, fresh and great. A special mention for their ghee paper masala dosa which is outstanding. Special chutney is a must order.

Ther is good bit of waiting time at peak hours but the wait is well worth a jyoti vihar dosa. There is a disappointment for the people who are fans like me of malkapuri to go alongside your south indian delicacies. But overall, jyoti vihar has been serving very satisfying experiences since i dont know when !!!

Jyoti-Vihar , located on Ho Chi Minh Sarani, near Theatre Road, takes you through an excursion of Pure Vegetarian Delights of Southern India and can easily boast of being the best in the city, with Anand coming only next to it! This is one place which is bound to satisfy your palate and it is needless to say that once you have been here you will remember it forever! It serves delectable Ghee Paper Masala Dosa‚Äôs, nice & fluffy Idlis & the Medu Wada‚Äôs which will leave a lasting impression on you! The coconut Chutney & the Sambar is awesome! It is worth mentioning here that while awaiting your turn to step inside( this restaurant has a small sitting set-up) , the aroma of the freshly prepared & steaming hot Sambar will make you go crazy ,quite similar to the effect one has while stumbling upon a concoction of freshly brewed filter coffee! SIMPLY AWESOME , AWESOME & AWESOME!

P.S:Just in case you haven't been here , please make it a point to be there for a thrilling experience!

Jyoti Vihar serves perfect quality South Indian food. The paper dosas are really crispy and yummy. We had Ghee Butter Cheese Masala Dosa. I prefer to put the potato masala on the side so that dosa stays crisp for long. The Sambhar and chutney along with the dosas are also tasty. The fluffy Idli's, crisp on the outside and soft inside Vada's and Uttapam are also a speciality here.

The ambiance isn't fancy and the services lower down during peak hours. But the service is quick. 

But if you like South Indian food, you should not miss JV and must give a try.

This restaurant serves decent South Indian food, but there is nothing that makes it stand out. I suppose that the need to cater to office-goers has led to lowered standards in order to handle heavy crowds. 

The place could do with some cleaning. Whenever there is a crowd, it becomes very muddy. Tables and chairs are also somewhat rickety.

The food is average. The chutney and sambar that accompany dosas and idlis don't seem very fresh,and the chutney is occasionally ice-cold, which ruins the taste of anything you're having it with. The service is slow and waiters rarely spend too much time taking down an order, leading to the occasional mix-up. All in all, an average place.

A chunk from Kolkata's heitage, this small South Indian restaurant takes you back to your childhood when movies such as Hum Aapke Hain Koun were creating records at the box office. The mosaic floor and the wood panelling and the chairs and the tables haven't changed... Kolkata's best South Indian food joint stays as pristine as ever, when it comes to setting and maintaining the bar. You order anything from the menu and you will be delighted with the quality of food the ever-smiling staff serves. From the other unconventional options, do try the milk upma and the dahi vada - they're outstanding! 

However, you'll find this place forever packed with people. The service is quick, but sometimes the food is cold. 

Otherwise, on maximum occasions, we've never been disappointed with JV; on the contrary, it has always been an extremely satisfying experience!

The ambiance isn't up to the mark, the AC's don't work. If you go by the looks of the place, I'm sure you wouldn't even come near it.
But but but, Dont judge the book by it's cover. This food joint is older than i am and the dosas they serve is amazing. I love the butter paper dosa, it's just so crispy that you can much on it just like that.
The vadas are crispy from outside and soft from the inside, a must have.
Love their onion uttapam too.
The idlis are big and fluffy, they do melt in your mouth.

Also, the coffee they serve is absolutely the type of coffee you get down south.
However, parking is a big problem in this area thanks to the american embassy.

My first visit to this Mecca of south Indian food was in the mid 70's..There are times when I have visited other south Indian joints,but only in the evenings because JV closes early..or on Sundays for breakfast. The idles,vadas and dosas are the tastiest in the country.Service is very quick and prices(given the quality of the food)very reasonable.

The best south indian food in Kolkata. All the Dosas are excellent. Vada is crisp and light.the Idlis are soft and very tasty. Uthapams are the best in Kolkata along with its Sambhar which is the best. No wonder there are long queues on all days for Lunch . It closes early and finishes off everything even earlier. A no fuss eatery so no fancy ambience here but still is full of foodies from all walks of life. Service is casual and quick. Highly recommended !

Being around so long should upgrade a bit , it would be a sign of respect n thanks to the long list of faithful clients who religiously keep going back. And hygiene is a big thumbs down .. C'mon u gotta agree. No towels for washing hands ( and everyone does use their hands to eat the dosa n vada)  No Napkins in this generation it's a must don't u think. Food is 100 per cent on so they get way with the above faults and the sad thing is that they know it , so for me it show disrespect

Vinatge! Nothing has changed in this place since i visited this place first, may be two decades ago, except that the bearers have grown older. The tables chairs, crockery (read utensils) are the same, but more importantly the food is also the same! The only eatery i know off in the planet which doesnt let patrons walk in post 6 pm. These guys are content and not chasing brisk business, but they simply are passionate and proud about the food they make and serve. 
One must try the butter dosa with a dollop of fresh white salted butter right at the core of your dosa. The sight of the butter melt into the crisp hot dosa adds on the to the visual taste buds. 
One cant go wrong with the freshly steamed idlis and vads. For those like me , there is sambhar without onion and garlic! If you are going on a Sunday for lunch be prepared to be patient to find a table. Try and park your car on Camac street or next to metro plaza as the road which houses this eatery is a no car zone (God bless America)!
But all in all JV Rocks!

This is my most favorite South Indian restaurant in town.

I first went there with my mom when I was a little boy, and since then never stopped. 

I love everything about this place, the bestest idly i have ever had, the craziest Ghee Butter Masala Dosa, they do the most perfect Chatni and Sambar and of course the filter coffee is super. This place serves you the freshest and the most piping hot food ever.

This place is nothing fancy its simple, very simple, don't be fooled by its ambience, the food here is to die for. I have seen people queue up outside this place for hours. This food at this place make you fall in love with it.

I would recommend this place to everyone, if you have been here go there first thing tomorrow.

Also the take-away is a very convenient option.

As for me, I will go to this place as long as they stay opened, which im sure they will for ever. :-D

The other name for yummy south indian food in Kolkata is Jyoti Vihar ! The dosas are excellent and perhapps the tastiest in Kolkata ... the vadas crisp on the outside and soft inside and fluffy warm idli's make for a perfect meal ! The sambar is my favorite in Kolkata and the chutney is excellent too. I usually like to ask them to provide the potato masala of my masala dosa on the side so it stays crisp. Their Utthapam is pretty good too ! The only down side is lack of parking but for such a meal one has to make a few sacrifices : )

The restaurant is simply done but is hygienic.. The food is very good - dosas, soft idlys, crisp vadas, uthapams very good filter Coffee. the ingredients are very fresh and all items are well cooked. This place serves one of the best chutneys and sambar I have tasted in Kolkata's south-Indian restaurants. 
Four stars from me.. If only it opened early in the morning for breakfast and had ample parking space it would have been a five!

while writing the review the best part is my mouth is already watering thinking about the excellent quality south indian .. made to perfection.. the butter served is a chunk of white butter which is actually visible till the end of your dosa.. idly with sambhar is a must try here.. traditional shop with excellent food quality not very high on ambiance though..

In a nutshell:

Stood the test of time - excellent south Indian vegetarian food - one of the best I have had in Kolkata so far.

Short Description - In case u r in a hurry:

YUMMRAJ's favourite South Indian Restaurant is Murugan Idly Chennai. So, any good South Indian restaurant gets compared to Murugan. 

If your usual lunch time is 1.00 in the afternoon, please plan to reach 20 - 30 minutes before because that is the waiting time. There is a fruit vendor in front of the restaurant who does good business while u wait, cut in front of u & served. The empty ground floor of the restaurant also serves as a waiting area. I wonder why that empty place is not used for seating people!!!!

The food is very good - dosas, idly, vadas, uthapams etc & very good filter Coffee - I maintain Murugan is still better. But if we do not compare with Murugan, this place is super good. A must try.

Detailed Description - In case u have the time to enjoy reading:

The idly is served freshly made & hot, very soft, lumpy (no pinholes), has a fermented feel to it & thoroughly enjoyable. If Murugan idly is rated 10, the idly here stands at 8.75.

The Medu vada is soft inside, crispy outside but the vada at Banana leaf Kolkata is much crispier & hence better. There is no whole black pepper in the vada as in Murugan & hence is a little short on flavor. If u do not compare, the vada is good on its own.

While choosing the dosa we came across an option called Butter Ghee Masala Dosa. We said 'how can u have 2 in 1'. The waiter said 'Yes sir, there is both'. We decided to try this strange combo & WOW - that was a cool decision. It was a dosa fried in ghee & served with a generous dollop of white butter. The dosa was thick, soft & had a crispy outer layer, it also had a very nice fermented feel to it. The potato filling was excellent & was served separately in little steel bowls. I would rate this 9.25 if I rate the dosa at Murugan to be 10.
With all the above u get a good sambhar & a coconuttee frothy chutney. But if u r willing to shell out an extra Rs. 25, u get the special Chutney - thick, grainy, robust, coconuttee, topped with crispy roasted urad daal that added an unexpected twist - mind blowing - better than the chutney at Murugan.

The filter Coffee is also good.

Overall - Highly recommended.

The madras cafe, Hanuman for Calcutta.

On sundays they used to shut shop by 2-3 depending on availability.

The way to go was, around 10.30 am on sunday morning, park your car(no valet ka zamana) rush upstairs.

Start with the idli vada combine & ask for their array of chutney - sukha, bomb et all.

Then a rava masala/mysore masala; teaming it with their dahi vadas; polishing off the entire meal with hot coffee.....filter of course.

I can still taste their ghee paper butter masala dosas which I maintain are the best in the world. From the kerb the line would snake up the narrow flight of stairs to a small room packed like sardines with a young crowd from neighbouring colleges but so busy eating that silence reigns. The need to satisfy the over-zealous policemen at the checkposts at either end of the road has made the popularity of Jyoti Vihar wane over the years. Pity the American Consulate happens to be there.
