Delicious food at a reasonable price. We ordered one hungry Sam combo which had beef burger, pork chop, french fries and a bottle of coke. Apart from that we had peri peri chicken, though it was not on the menu, they made it on request. All the food tasted really good. But the pork chop had less meat and more fat.

I'm an absolute food lover, and so I frequently search for new, good and reasonable places to eat on zomato, and recently during one of my searches I came across this place. Looking at the good ratings and the yummy pictures of the food, i added it to my bookmark. And today i finally ordered from here. Let me tell you first the people are very sweet. I had called to order and the person spoke to me very sweetly and answered to my questions patiently. I had ordered the You And Me meal, and it was very tasty and fiiling. They charge Rs 50 as delivery charge, but they also give discounts. To be honest i absolutely loved the food and would definitely order again, since it's so near to my house. Oh, they are also opening up near Bijoygarh area from the next month. So looking forward to it.. :)

Got IK's Beef Burger home delivered. Delivery was a little slow, but it was raining so I can let that slide.
The packaging was absolutely amazing. Most places deliver burgers wrapped in aluminium foil which often ruins the shape of it and make it messy. These guys know how to deal with that stuff. They deliver in small plastic containers just the right shape of the burger.
Coming to the burger itself, the patty and the sauce was brilliant, and a treat to the taste buds. The olives were a nice extra touch. But the experience was kinda ruined coz the bread felt stale. I cannot be certain about this, but my friend felt the same. So please look into the matter. Other than this, for the price, one cannot expect anything remotely this good. Will order again if the issue is resolved. They added a complementary bottle of sprite which was a nice gesture.

As foodie Iam, Ishzee's kitchen had been in my bucket list for quite sometime. So I finally decided to try out some burgers from IK. I got the number from their FB page and pinged them. I placed an order for two beef burgers and one IK's fries. No hassle in placing an order however, when my order was out for delivery there was some confusion regarding my address which got solved in no time. Coming to the food, Beef Burger with its soft patty was fresh and excellent in taste.The bun, cheese, veggies and sauces complimented well. One of the best burgers i've ever had. The Ik's fries, perfectly crispy and well seasoned with their secret seasoning was so tasty that i regretted for not ordering more. Overall A nice experience it was. Looking forward to try more items from IK.

Ordered Peri Peri Chicken wings, chicken lollipop, Sausages and French Fries. Food is to die forüòç.
As the tagline says "We don't serve disappointment". I suggest everyone to try Ishee'z cuz truly you won't get disappointed with the food. We are certainly ordering more. And the "token of love" is a really good gesture. And the owner's and service are really good.
Good going Ishee'z. Wish to try more varieties shortly.

Just had a chicken burger which by the way was just awesome.. Ishee'z is the new kid in the block that can take down it's competition for sure.. with a perfect patty and right amount of sauce and cheese .
Next I had Keema pao which is innovative and tastiest I must say..
Anyone craving for burger can look upon Ishee'z kitchen for sure and won't regret..
And the "Token of love" was  sweet surprise :)

This is a newly opened delivery joint in our locality. Ordered food over the phone today from here for dinner. It was one Pork Chop Meal and three Watermelon Slushes. They take order one hour advance and the last order is taken at 8pm. Would love if they extend their timings.
The food came hot and the packaging was really good. Pricing is okay as all of this including packaging and free delivery charged us 530 bucks. Let's now unveil the food in terms of taste and quality.
Watermelon Slush - The juice came really well. What I loved about it was that they didn't use added sugar. But the negative thing is that they didn't deseed the watermelon before crushing the juice out of it. Not a lot of effort was put into crushing the watermelons really well. Chunks remained in the glasses. This part must be checked upon.
Pork Chop Meal - This portion is really huge. The chop was a large one with a greater portion of fat. I would suggest if they balance out the meat and fatty portion in the chop. It came with mashed potatoes and garlic bread. The mashed potato tasted pretty good but the garlic bread was over toasted with butter and almost no hint of garlic. This thing should be improved. The sauce was excellent. Classic brown sauce made perfectly faded out all the complaints we had before.
This is a new place trying out to serve newer kind of food in this locality, which wasn't served here before. Loved their gesture of sending a handkerchief as token of love. Presently, it is a 3.5 from my side as there are several scopes of improvement. I need to try their other items to increase the rating further. I hope the management, who were very courteous over the telephone and during delivery will look into this matter and develop their own path, shine and prosper. Best wishes to the team. Happy Dining! :)

‚Ä¢ Order :
1. Pork chop
2. Chicken burger
3. Pork wrap
4. Mashed potatoes

‚Ä¢ Delivery time :
A bit long but definitely within the time they promised. Better part is, they have this cool option where you can share your exact location through WhatsApp and they keep on updating you on real time about status of the delivery.

‚Ä¢ Packaging :
Awesome. They also did send us a cotton handkerchief packed inside which was addressed as "A token of love", nice gesture that was.

‚Ä¢ Quality :
Great. Very neat and clean. And ofcourse the taste. It is like they ‚Äãknow exactly what we want ! We definitely are ordering from them soon ! If you aren't of that cliche kind who only dine at 5 star Lalits or Tajs, then trust them, they indeed are the best ones taste wise ! They are the ultimate option for regular people like me and my girlfriend or any other foodie. From what I'm blabbering out of the point, you can understand how pleased I'm with the taste and last word would
just be - "MUST TRY THEM OUT IF YOU HAVE A TONGUE".

‚Ä¢ Quantity :
Perfect for 2 people.

‚Ä¢ Suggestions to Ishee'z Kitchen :
Guys, please don't change anything about this even when you get on top of the list on Zomato and elsewhere (which I definitely know would be soon). Many restaurants or take aways lose their quantity or quality or hike their prices and on the process lose their customers. Please don't change, you guys are simply perfect. We have moved on from "once" awesome restaurant and are with you now (I edited the post and removed their name, sorry). We hope you won't change like they did.
Not much otherwise, you guys are awesome (I'm sure you know that) ! Awesome food ! Best in Kolkata as per our tastes.

It's time to be crazy with the burgers served in this Resturant. Extremely juicy patty topped up with cheese olives and a secret sauce makes the burgers mind blowing.The beef burger has stolen my heart...I think all the  local overhyped outlets should learn from them. 
Ishee it's time for u to do more marketing of the outlet and I wish u all the very best üëç

Ishee'z Kitchen, the brainchild of Ishee and Sami, opened it's doors to the food lovers of Kolkata a few months ago. I loved the pork meal and the burgers which I picked up from there.Very wholesome and totally hygienic fare.I found the Menu uncomplicated and easy to choose from. I am sure more items will be gradually added to cater to the foodies of Kolkata. I recommend the place for the clean & nutritious food. Ishee'z Kitchen is behind the Agragami Club in Bijoygargh. I wish Ishee'z Kit exponential growth and smooth sailing !

Isheez Kitchen began a few months ago and I have been there on several occasions. Quality of food is good , fresh ingredients used and the food is delicious. I love the pork chops and recently another favorite has become the beef wrap. The beef is delicious, soft, tender. The ambience is good, beautiful photographs in the shop, the owner is nice and a good host.

do visit them, help them grow in a vigorous way, they are some months old. I explored it today. located in a lane of a 'not so popular' location. Give them a call before visiting they'll guide you. Its impossible to find out by yourself. Being the first customer , i received complementary wrap with beef sandwich. Totally home made well baked non spicy fresh and hygienic not loaded with artificial tastemakers. Hope they include more options in the menu and reveal a little more information about home delivery.

The food here is amazing! I especially love the pork chops, piri-piri fries, winged heaven and chicken burger. They have always served me fresh food and never have I been disappointed. The owner takes into account all your preferences; if there's any and cooks accordingly. Would recommend Ishee'z Kitchen to everyone. Cheers!

Isheez Kitchen offers a range of varieties for everybody. As a vegetarian, I have not found many burgers and sandwiches which are as delicious as those available here. My favourite is the chocolate ravioli. Best thing about Isheez Kitchen is that everything is fresh and made in a very hygenic manner. Don't miss out on the amazing apple-cinnamon drink.
