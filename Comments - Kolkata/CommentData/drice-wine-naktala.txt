Ordered quite a few items different times through Swiggy.

The food is good and cheap. Recommended if you need to order something for yourself or for normal or casual lunch or dinner with friends.

Quantity is good for one.

Worst food I have till date. I have ordered chicken momo but there is simply no chicken in it. Worst food ever. Please improve the quality of your food or else close this outlet.

A small eatery at naktala area, which also delivers food. Had ordered mixed schezwan noodles and dry chili chicken. Quantity of the full plate noodles is really good, can be easily served to two people. Pieces of chili chicken were alright. 
Now coming to taste and proportions, noodles only had chunks of chicken no egg and found two pieces of baby shrimp. Chicken was hard and much oily. It was reasonable to my pocket and filled my stomach, hence three stars. *Not including tongue's appetite*.

Ordered food via home delivery. The food was delivered pathetically after 90 minutes. Mixed fried rice was simply bad. There were no prawns at all. Lemon chicken was just horrible. Small pieces chicken with no taste at all. The gravy had become literally sour. Now I know why the name of the restaurant has the word "Wine" in it. I'm sure, intelligent people will understand the analogy.

And last was the fish finger. You get much better & tastier fish fingers on road side stalls. Total wastage of my money. When called, the owner was rude on phone. It is wise to never ever order food from here.

A small take away located near naktala post office .. Nothing extra ordinary to mention about the food joint. They seem to keep their food items simple and pocket friendly. My order was Chicken Fried Rice and Hot Garlic Chicken. The rice could have been a bit more boiled but it was edible enough.. The chicken pieces were tender and I liked how they kept the side dish less hot which was just to me.
Time taken to prepare the items was less as well.
Food : 4/5
Delivery/Preparation : 4/5

A new food joint which has opened recently at naktala more. Very conveniently placed,this place offers usual chinese items & evening time snacks(rolls,fries & mughlais). So i tried the following items upon my first visit:-

1. Chicken friedrice= Normal friedrice nicely made. The veggies & chicken tasted fresh although the veggies could be a tad finer since the pieces were uneven.

2. Chicken 65= Took half plate of it & this item didnt disappoint me since it was spicy which how this dish is suppose to be. Half a plate contains 4 pieces. The contents of this dish were onions,capsicums,spring onions & a spicy tangy sauce.

Overall the food was satisfying & prices are on the moderate side. All the side dishes have the option of half. Worth a try
