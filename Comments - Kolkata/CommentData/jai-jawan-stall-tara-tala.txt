Great place, average pricing considering GST made some hits, and an average tasting food serving busy stall. You will find places to sit inside but it is so cramped, you'd rather leave it and take it outside. But outside, oh well, it's very dusty. Great place for handy foods like rolls and stuff but you'd have a hard time dealing with noodles or Biriyani. 
Talking about food, the rolls are good. Not the best, but pretty decent for what you're paying for, both chicken and eggrolls. You you're planning to have noodles, don't have Chicken Gravy Chow, don't. It's a disaster. Normal chow is decent, kinda oily but above average. Try to avoid those ketchup and sauces they serve. They taste kinda muddy. Last the chicken steamed momos are cheap but small, way smaller than Wow! Momo and the stuffing was below average. Hygeine is meh, and the time taken to serve rolls and momos are fast but chow took us sometime. Not a great experience but if you're on a hurry, a roll won't hurt.

Located near taratala crossing ,this place is easy to find . If you are looking for tasty food at cheap prices , and you are near taratala ,then this is the place to to go and munch on . We went with a huge group of friends and ordered almost everything available as we were super hungry. 

What I ordered - 

1. CHICKEN BIRIYANI 
2.CHICKEN DOPIAZA
3.CHICKEN KASHA 
4.CHICKEN KORMA 
5.CHICKEN RESHMI KEBAB 
6.CHICKEN SOUP 
7.CHICKEN TANDOORI FULL 
8.CHICKEN WINGS KEBAB 
9.CHINESE THALI 
10.FISH FRY 
11. MIXED CHOWMEIN 
12.MIXED GRAVY CHOW 
13.MIXED RICE 
14.MUGHLAI PARATHA 
15.MUTTON BIRIYANI 
16.EGG CHICKEN ROLL 
17.ROTI THALI 
18.VEG THALI 

Prices are reasonable. The food was fresh . The Biriyani was amazing and the Chicken Korma was too much of a lip smacking dish. The cons of this place is ,there is not much sitting arrangement ,so its better if the food is home delivered.

Very nice place. Food quality is superb. Don't expect a quiet air-conditioned ambience. But the shop is located on the road front. Famous for its Thali's and Rolls. Even the Kebabs are delicious. You can expect a perfect 'Dhaba' type experience in it.

It was my go to place for chicken rolls. I used to have 2 rolls a month. I only had egg and chicken rolls , & they are quite nice. But i have noticed the chicken pieces in the rolls are getting smaller. Easy to locate , oppo Taratala petrol pump. you can sit on the chairs but there's no table. Really pocket friendly. Take-away recommended.

A corner food joint. Delicious kababs and starters. Rolls are also tasty. The place is satisfactory for a stoppage food break, or in-between snacks, brunch, supper etc. 

But totally not recommended for meal. The food is very oily, as well as not so delicious. The main courses are bound to give you a stomach upset the next day. Biriyani is atrocious.

The rolls are amazing. Good evening snacks. Quantity of everything else is pretty decent. However, road side and the amount of dust the place around boils up is something that should be considered before going back here.

Ordered Chinese from this stall through Swiggy. The rates are very cheap, and the quality of the food is not that bad at such low rates. Quantity was also more than sufficient. Just that the Mixed Rice was too spicy, as they added too many green chillies to it, which must be avoided. The Garlic Chicken was okayish. 6 good pieces of chicken, the dish came with. I will order again from this counter, to try some North Indian items. It is a small stall at Taratala crossing. Best if you take away your food, or just have rolls from here. They have arrangement of a couple of chairs outside their stall for people who wish to have a quick bite on the go.

Good food at low price. The restaurant ia located at Taratala Crossing. The place is not ideal for dine in. You can avail their take away option. We ordered Roto Meal and Chicken Chaap.

1. Roti Meal
It contained 1pc Larcha Paratha, 2 pc Rumali Roti, 1 pc Chicken Kasha, Chicken Bharta and Salad. 
Larcha Paratha was too much oily but it was soft. Rumali Roti was good. Chicken kasha was not so good in taste. Chicken Bharta was good. The chicken pieces was softn, fresh and well cooked. 

2. Chicken Chaap 
It was not good in taste and too much spicy. 

All the food was fresh. It is a nice procket friendly place to have lunh or dinner.

A small place right near taratala crossing this place isn't hard to find. If you're looking for tasty food at a low price this is a good choice. I ordered a roti thali which had 2 pcs rumali roti, 1 lacha paratha , 1 pcs chicken curry , chicken bharta and salad. The paratha and bharta was the yummiest of the lot. But others too was heathy. 
But their sitting arrangement is not good with only a few chairs to sit on. But the food is tasty :)

Jai Jawan Stall is one those place who is only bothered about its food. Its mostly a take away joint and a large person of customers order online. This place serves some good food in very reasonable price and thats their attraction. The place serves a great variety of dishes giving the customer to choose.
Its my second order from this place and I am pretty satisfied with the food and the price I had to pay.
The Chicken Roll was not up to the mark.
The Chowmein was decent with a good number of Chicken Chunks in it.
The Roti Thali was great with Chicken Kassa, Chicken Bharta, Roomali Roti, Lachha Paratha and Salad.
The Chicken Biryani was just satisfactory.

The price was very nominal which is one of the reasons of ordering from here.

If you wanna eat something good with less budget, this place fits perfectly.

3.5/5 for this place

Food quality was good when this eateria started. It is shitty now. The manager sitting on the worn out chair is very ill mannered now. When they started business I had food at this place daily for 5 years. Now that the business is running well they are very bad behaved and quality of food also sucks.

Jai Jawan Stall - Didn't think this could also be listed on Zomato. Nostalgia.
=====
Intro + Location:
It is not at all difficult to locate. The road which goes towards santoshpur from taratala crossing, it is located there itself on the crossing. It is not a very hygienic place and does not offer more than 5-10 chairs to sit and a very small place as well.
=====
What i have tried:

• Chicken Roll - Tell the person to add less on oil and the roll tastes good specially the marinated and sauted chicken pieces. However, they use pure dalda which inturn is not healthy. The roll roti is flaky. 

• Chicken Chowmien - Well, the quantity is good and the taste is just fine. It is like usual street food kiosks providing chowmien.
=====
Pros:

• Pocket Friendly.
• Serving speed is fast.
• Taste is fine.

Cons:

• Hygiene is an issue.
• Seating arrangement isn't great.
• Food quality isn't upto the mark due to ingredients used. 
=====
Suggestion: I would suggest to have a takeaway from here rather than eat here as it's not really hygienic. 
=====
Meal for two: 80-200 max
=====
Summary:

Food Quality: 2.8/5
Food Quantity 3.5/5
Hygiene 2.7/5
Hospitality 3.2/5
Ambiance (It is a street stall type. So, nothing to comment on it.)
Value for money 3.4/5 (Pocket Friendly)
=====
Conclusion: Might not come here anymore as there are much better outlets which have opened nearby. Though, if you are really low on pocket, this is a choice to consider. I always tell them to add less of oil on my stuffs. The best part is you get served hot food at pocket friendly price and with quick service. 
=====
Note: Unbiased review based on my visiting experience.

This small fast food stall is situated in taratala just opposite to the Cesc office. The location of this place makes this food stall always busy. They serve a variety of items from Chinese to mughalai and are one of the cheapest. I only tasted their food once, ordered their chicken chowmein which was good. Will visit this place again.

i had recently ordered for their chinese thali which consist of veg chow veg fried rice 2 pieces of chilly chicken salad and sauce  now coming to the quality of food . it was average quality was okay according to the price of food. my openion is that . they give very little amount of rice and an average quantity of chow as well. a slight burnt smell was coming from the chow . the chilly chicken were although well cooked. their presentation of food in one single thali was impressive . they gave only one piece of cucumber and i piece of onion as salad .overall average will try again edit - 1st time i didnt had a good impression about this restaurant but then i found that they are trying to improve day by day so rewriting my review . i must say that their chicken rolls are too good . the rolls were full of chicken worth the price. next i tried their chicken biryani and chicken do peyaja . both were pretty good to taste . they were giving a special combo of both the two at just rs. 120 . certainly a good attempt. so was very impressed . finally i would like to mention that the chicken chow was not again upto the mark . it was below average. please dont try it. there are other better options . go for rolls i would say or even the biryani (if available)

These was one of the joint in Taratala where I still give visit whenever possible... no deco... nothing to say about staffs... no special mention about the service... but I must say they are very systematic... my rating is completely based on there food... I have there chowmin, fried rice, biriyani, chilli chicken, rolls and chicken butter fry... all the preparations are very good... of which the butter chicken is my favorite... although I know all the dishes are pretty unhealthy due to use of dalda... but I still like it... pocket pinch was very friendly...

Dont think of going to the place n eating there as the traffic,pollution n crowd will ruin your food. Although the price is good the food quality and taste are mediocre. If u are at this place and really hungry and out of choice then can have the rolls. Unless pack the food and eat In home if u want to try.

Have dropped by this place twice on my way back from tuitions..to cater to my snack cravings..its just another takeaway outlet.. .I usually go by the safe bet...i.e the plain o'l Egg Roll.
Whats impressive out here is the organized manner in which the orders are taken and served...something not quite expected from a crammed up little roadside stall.As far as the food is concerned, in this case egg roll...its decent..however something which i dislike is the degree of sweetness that accompanies the filling...i guess its the sauce.. momos are good out here..chicken momos especially.
If you are a resident of this area do drop by once...and who knows the place might work up its magic on you.
If I think of the pros...i can only recount about the cleanliness of this place...
The only con i detect here is the lack of proper seating arrangement...you need to rely on the plastic chairs which are placed here haphazardly...

i recently shifted my residence to taratala and was looking for nice joint to get some grub ....so my neighbour suggested me this place.....i wasnt too excited by the get up of the joint but still decided to try out their NonVeg Roti Thali which had Chicken bharta ,Chicken kasa 1pc, 2 rumali roti nd 1 lacha paratha....to my surprise i was served quite a nice quantity and food was really tasty ...and this whole thali was just Rs 100 ...simply awesome.....next day i came back again and ordered their mutton biriyani and chicken wings.....the biriyani was average...but the chicken were a slightly smaller version of tandoori chicken and were damn tasty....since the last few days i have also ordered thier chicken momo(steamed) which was great....and i highly recommend this place for takeaway as there is no proper seating
