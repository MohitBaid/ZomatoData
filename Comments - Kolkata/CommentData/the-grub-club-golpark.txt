We ordered chinese nonveg platter,prawn fried rice,prawn manchurian.
The platter consisted of mixed friedrice,chicken manchurian,chicken wontons fried and darsan along with a topping of vanilla ice-cream.
The fried rice were nice,but the gravy of the chicken and prawn was watery,could have been a lil thick.

I have lot of memories associated with The Grub Club. During my school college days this was the most economical food joint we had. Needless to say for all occasions with friends took place here only. 
Visited this place after so many years. Felt nostalgic. Lot of things have changed ... the look , the set up , the waiters ... and most importantly I didn‚Äôt find any cats this time üòÅ. 
Tried the Thukpa and the Momo. Decent enough .. thukpa portion was good though. Only thing which changed is that it can‚Äôt now be called  the only economical Restaurant in Kolkata.

A simple eating place which provides great combo meals. The Chinese at this place is good and the quantity of the food is totally worth the money. One of the most pocket-friendly places and is therefore a hangout place for college students. Though there is no a.c. at this place still it is quite clean. I love to go there when I'm a bit tight on cash. A great place to eat and chat with your friends.

So i'll be honest here. My review might be a bit partial because i have visited this place innumerable times since college days. And i have never ever been disappointed. Yes you may have to wait for your order to be served. But yeah if you are in the company of some nice people that won't matter. Ambience is really chilled out. Mostly people come here for a quick bite or a date or hanging out with friends. Service is a tad bit slow though. Anyways grub club makes it up with the quality and taste of the food they serve. The pricing is also very reasonable. Coming to the food they are popular for the chinese preparations and also the major attractions are the continental dishes on offer. My favourites from this joint are honey chicken lollipops, chicken lasagna, chicken tetrazzini, chicken augratin, chicken sizzler. All these dishes are really yummy. (hint they go very well with a coke) The food is really good. And also the pocket pinch is real low thats the added bonus.
Keep up the good work guys. Will come back soon enough.

Especially the Pepper Prawns, Konjee Babycorn and Lasagne. 
The only bad thing they served is Virgin mojito. Try Fresh lime soda instead, which is way better.

Visited this place a few days back by chance. Had actually planned to visit another newly opened cafe nearby, but on finding this one first, decided to go here instead. We were provided with three different menu cards, one with various types of ice creams, another with various juices, milkshakes, etc and another with various options of Chinese food. We did not know that they serve Continental also as neither of the menu cards mentioned that..otherwise we would have opted for something from that section. Nevertheless, we settled for Mandarin Chowmein and Chicken Drumsticks.

Chicken Drumsticks-- Six medium sized pieces of chicken served warm, along with shredded salad and lemon. They were crunchy on the outside and juicy inside, and tasted great with a dash of lemon! Recommended. (135Rs per plate)
Mandarin Chowmein-- Gravy noodles with chicken,egg,prawns and lots of veggies. It was mild, not very spicy, but tasted good. Quantity however was not satisfactory. Priced at 160Rs per plate but it was enough for one person only.

Service was decent. The place was decorated for the upcoming Christmas and New Year, but still ambience was drab. There were bad smells coming from the kitchen side. Please refer to the pictures for the updated menu of the Chinese section and also the other menus not provided on Zomato. And one suggestion to the restaurant- Please mention everything that is available, in your menus. Otherwise it's confusing as to what's available and what's not.

Situated near golpark petrol pump, this place is a gem if you're running on a low budget. They have a wide range of food for you to choose from. I've visited this place quite a few times and the experience was satisfactory.

Ambience- it's a non a.c. restaurant but has enough fans to keep you cool in the hot summer days. The place looks quite simple and has nothing fancy decor but overall a pleasant feeling.

Service- you have to pay for your food prior eating it. The service is prompt and everybody in the house is very well behaved and well aware of the menu.

Food- the reason why you would probably wanna visit this place again & again. I've actually tried their starters and desserts, never did the main course. I've tried-
*Chicken Lasagne~> just a regular dish, nothing fancy. I've had better lasagne at other places. But then it's much cheap than other places.

*Pan fried momo~> I found this one quite good as well as my avid momo-lover friend. So a thumbs up to this dish.

*Honey Chicken lollipop~> absolutely lip-smacking. Perfect sweetness and well cooked chicken. Get ready to get your hands dirty with this one.

*Desserts~> they have a wide range of desserts to offer- from aerated drinks to awesome ice creams.
I've tried quite a few ice creams and they were soo good and quite cheap! And I'm talking about hell lotta cheap! I mean three scoops of ice cream with nuts, chocolate sause, wafers and lodsa other stuffs just for 90rs. They also have brownies.

Ultimately it's a wow place to visit that will definitely not burn a hole in your pocket. Also they serve food in nice portion so that you can share. A definite thumbs up from me!

This place is well located at golpark. They have ample space for the guests but as time passes this outlet is getting from good to average and now average to below average. Ambience is not good. Furnitures are very dull. We recently visited this place and was tired so thought to have food quickly at Grub club. As they have good sitting area and nice food (once upon a time)..but sorry to share that food is just below average. Although they have variety of items on their menu and most of them are very much available.
The place first needs a renovation to become adjustable to the modern world. The menu should be more modern. The place provides food with reasonable price but it's not of quality which you would expect. The place although has a very depressing look to it as mentioned earlier. Decide over quality and quantity.
The flavors were again very average or should I say below average. All in all, I just didn't like the aura or the food at all. I would personally not recommend anyone to visit this place. Chicken smoke is everywhere inside the restaurant which is very irritating and definitely not a good environment to sit and eat.
However, what I don't like about this outlet is that their water glasses are not cleaned and that's why water taste become a little bit weird. So if you are visiting this place don't drink their water or go for mineral water but don't use their glasses.
We ordered the following menu:
Cold coffee which was good.
Double chili schzewan noodles- worst. Was too much oily. Quantity is good for two people.
Konjee baby corn- Bad.
Chicken spring roll- good.
Veg rice and manchurian combo- good.
Virgin mojito- waste. Not worth it.
So, if you want to eat food and taste doesn't matter to you then you may visit this restaurant. Quality of food is really bad. I didn't feel happy after eating. Staffs are pretty decent and service is real quick. Parking is a bit tricky so please ask the restaurant where to park safely as the whole road is a clamping zone. Gst is added separately.

Have been coming here since I was kid. The food quality has deterioratedover the years but is still passable. Their chinese section is definitely really good while their continental section does horribly. Had the veg au gratin and spaghetti bolognese, both of them were undercooked and bland. Also had the vegetable gravy chowmein and chilli chicken, both were really good and filling and the chilli chicken was exceptionally good and spicy. Their combo meals are good. Light on the pocket.

Going with brother at last Saturday evening. Restaurant almost empty. Only few people sitting there. After placing order we are waiting for a long time which is appropriately 40-45mins!! In fact, those who came after us they all having their food but we didn't get.!! Ridiculous process..!! Staffs are very much lazy.. Didn't attend customer even. We ordered as a "Starter" Spicy honey chicken nd as a "main course" Chicken fried rice nd sweet garlic chicken. Most interesting thing is they don't even know the meaning of Starter!! They served all food together after 45mins!!! All our hunger gone with that long waiting period. Nd finally we decided not to go there 2nd time. Because we can't wait for 45mins in a casual day with just 1glass of water. Poor service and staff!!

This place is fantastic for cheap, delicious food. Zero points for ambience even though they are spread out over a big area, but no complaints there. Get a table, give your order, hog it all up, pay you cash at the counter and get out of there! Grub Club is a crowd favourite for the youngsters and the old timers. It's not one of your new age spick and span cafes but it has more heart and soul than all those newbies combined. Almost everyone in South Kolkata and beyond would know this almost-legendary no frills eatery. Try their Chicken Chowmein and Chilli Chicken if you are a first timer and don't know what to order, or just about anything on the menu. They might not look the cleanest, but the taste is absolutely there. A must try!

Yesterday, we went to this much heard about restaurant near Golpark. This is not an AC restaurant, but the food would definitely make up for it. This is quite a buzzy restaurant, visited by groups of young people and couples. This restaurant serves Chinese and Continental dishes. We ordered Mixed Schezwan Noodles, Mixed Schezwan Fried Rice, Chilly Fish and Jumbo Chilly Prawn. The noodles and the rice had the right amount of spice in them. The prawns were well cooked and so were the tender pieces of fish. Everything was delicious. Prices were very reasonable and the quantities served were ample. Do visit this place if you have a pocket crunch!

Not a lot of chairs, might have to wait on certain time of the day like Lunch hours, Dinner hours, Evening hours.

Liked the Soup items, Honey dripped Chicken's, Mixed Rice. Beverages are much cheaper considering the surroundings.

Must visit at least once.

A no frills, non AC restro serving exceptionally good food at very reasonable prices for office workers & college students. They prepare North indian, chinese and continental dishes. They also prepare few shakes, Mango shake being the most popular. Dry chilly chiken, Sizzlers, stir fried chiken and chikenwings are highly recommended. Also they serves cheapest virgin mojito in town . Quality has taken a dip over the past two years but it still remains one of the packed restro throughout the week. Perfect for people who want quality food in a tight budget.

Nice place. Congested, a bit. Still... Food is awesome. A bit costly though. Service is good.

Delicacies are lamb, especially dry chilly lamb. Nice place to hangout with friends or family.

Interior shits and most importantly non AC. -.-

Best place for a quick meal. Students corner! Good food at low prices.
Interior:2/5
More like a canteen. It becomes a little suffocating during summer as the place has no ac and huge demand.
Food:4.5/5
They will never fail your expectations. Huge quantity and good taste.
Service:3/5
Should be more fast and apt.

THE ORIGINAL PRICE IS IN SWIGGY.WRITE "GRUB CLUB SWIGGY" IN GOOGLE AND GET EXACT PRICE.HOME DELIVERY ALSO AVAILABLE FROM SWIGGY.PRICE ARE GST INCLUDED

ONE CAN EASILY GO TO GRUB CLUB FOR HAVING A BUDGET MEAL
I ORDERED GRAVY CHOW AND SPICY CHICKEN WINGS(6 PIECES,BIG SIZE)
IT WAS VERY MUCH YUMMY
THEY ACCEPT DEBIT CARDS ALSO

Yesterday visited with my husband and the food we had just made our evening.
Dragon Soup, Chicken gravy manchurian noodles were just amazing. We ordered one chicken dish called sweet garlic chicken was too good. But the sad part is we were about to order the desert, the counter closed!
Please note the order should be placed before 10.30 p.m
Recommended you all to go and taste the food at pocket friendly price.¬†
Ambiance is ok and behavior of stuffs are very friendly.

I wanted to try this one for a long time. Atlaast I did. Located in golpark area this restaurant serves good and tasty food at reasonable prices. I tried their chicken steam momo and chicken cutlet. Both the preparations were too good. I loved the cutlet. Best cutlet I had at such a reasonable price. The size of both momo and cutlet are worth the price. The staffs are helpful. Although it doesn't has an air conditioner you will not feel that hot even if you visit during the afternoon. The place is airy. Service is prompt. Overall had a nice experience.

Situated near nazrul manch. This eatery is usually packed with students and couples who drop in for a quick bite. Serving chinese and continental this is a prepaid restaurant where u get ur order billed and then the food is served. I usually have my lunch at grub club on weekends when i have my coaching classes at nazrul manch. We go for the chinese combo meals. It contains either noodles/rice with chicken chilly or manchurian or you can opt for the fish meal where fish manchurians are served.
The service is quite prompt as i can manage my lunch in a 45mins break. The food is warm nd gravy is light but the chicken is heavily coated with cornstarch.

This doesn't even deserve one star but have to give it since its the lowest rating. The service is awful. No staff knows how to behave with their customers. First in first the food has to be ordered at the counter and then the food takes a lot of time to come. No one comes to apologize also.. in fact the manager also defends and argues with us back that it has just been 17 minutes past. It was jst one fried rice and one chilly chicken that we ordered. Followed by such average food. Big mistake coming here!

The place isn't fancy to look at but what it serves is simple chinese comfort food. The dishes aren't decorous, but the food is perfect for lifting your mood and killing your hunger pang.

For one visit I tried their mixed fried rice and paired it off with thai shredded chicken. The food was pretty good.

On another visit, I had their Chicken Thukpa, which I think was amazing. I hadn't had good experiences with Thukpas before in other restaurants, but the one that Grub Club served was great. One bowl of their Thukpa is going to keep you full and happy for a long time. They are the best for rainy or chilly evenings.

The price for which their dishes come are really reasonable and the quality and taste is good too. Also the quantity they serve is absolutely filling. Totally fit for what they charge.

I prefer the Chinese menu , the mixed chowmin and fried rice , superb in taste and the quantity is sufficient. The soup particularly the corn and chicken options is good . Take the chowmin/ fried rice with the chilly chicken . 
The juice counter is also good and you can try with the varieties .

Apart from these I had noodles, fried rice, garlic chicken and many chicken starters. The food or the taste is average. Not a pocket pincher and student's favourite place. They didn't give much importance to the ambience but clean though.

Well this place has been our place to chill since college days. Ideal place to have tasty food without worrying about the bill. Initially they only served Chinese but now they are serving Indian and continental dishes as well and they are quite tasty. Sasta tikao types but the food will not turn you off and I must say located in Golpark has an advantage of wonderful location.

Grub Club, in my opinion, is the ‚Äògo-to place‚Äô for anyone who wishes to have decent food at reasonable price in South Kolkata. As such, it is hugely popular with students....there being colleges and libraries in the vicinity. I‚Äôve visited it numerous times, both for dine-in and take-outs. The experience has been largely satisfactory, barring one incident when the chicken lasagne that I ordered for home turned out bad....it had a foul smell and had to be thrown away into the bin. This was surprising, for I had previously ordered the same dish once as a parcel, and there was no complaint on that occasion. I rang up to inform them this time, but the money was already gone down the drain.

On the occasion of my dad's birthday I wanted to try out some new restaurant. Since it was a treat on my side so i was searching for a cheap but good restaurant. I was being suggested of Grub Club. Here you have to order at the counter and pay in advance even if you eat there, which is one of the negetive side. It is perfect for college goers for its cheap price and good quantity. Mine was a take away.
I ordered crispy chilli baby corn, chicken drumsticks, mixed fried rice and manchurian chicken. The crispy chilli baby corn was really good and tasty. Chicken drumsticks was average but it had less chicken in it and the outer covering was thick which i didn't like. Mixed fried rice was good and 1 plate was enough for 2 people. Manchurian chicken was not very tasty, it was normal.
Overall the food was good in quantity but average in quality. I want to try out some compo packs which I heard are really money saving. Sawandeep Majhi

This is one of the best hangouts for foodies in Kolkata.It is just a simple resturant nothing great about the ambience of the place.The decor was pretty plane.Even though it is a non-ac resturant it still is one of my favourites in the city.Good food,great quantity and the best part is it does not pinch your pocket.It was my second visit yesterday.I hopped in along with my Friend for a late lunch.We ordered Spicy chicken wings which literally melted in our mouths.It was too delicious.Even the crispy mushrooms were nice but a little bland for my taste.I needed to adjust the taste with some salt and pepper.But the item that won my heart was Chicken Augratin.It was so enticing.The cream on the Augratin was just to die for.The taste was splendid.Just Yummy.Definatly a go to when one is hungry and low on cash....Will definitely recommend this place.The only drawback was the serving staff who were a little laid back hence no 5 stars.....

Weekends are kind of a little crowded over here. We went in for a quick bite, so tried just two items off the menu:

1. Steamed momos (non-veg) - 3‚≠êÔ∏è
[5pcs. in a plate with a bowl of soup and the spicy dip. The soup was a disappointment, the momos themselves had adequate meat in them]

2. Fish finger - 3.5‚≠êÔ∏è
[6pcs. in a plate, a little on the bland side]

It's a prepaid service, so you order at the counter and wait at your table with the receipt. The waiter attending the table will get your stuff according to the receipt. Weekends see a lot of footfall, so getting a table might be an issue. Pretty spacious.

An overall 3.5‚≠êÔ∏è. I wouldn't mind visiting this place again.

This place is a perennial favourite among the youth because of the pocket friendly price. I have pampered myself with pan fried chicken momo, noodles and some Thai delicacies.  Food is yummy but it's high time the owners get concerned about the sitting arrangement. It is often very congested and it resembles a mass feeding place rather than a restaurant.

I really don't like the taste of chicken fried wontons it is waste of money the wontons where extimed fried  there where very less amount of chicken it is tasteless and the chutney which where served with wontons it's very bad to taste it was very much spicy and lot of Chillies over there but I like baby corn konjee. For  that's why I am ranking 3 out of 5 to this restaurant.

The chicken was very tender and there was a perfect chinese flavour to both the dishes.Even the quantity , quality and service was so just perfect. Looking forward to more such visit üòä

A simple place for a quick bite.Momo, noodles, fried rice, other snacks are available.Because of its prime location it attracts many people. They would serve on time and it is value for money.Do not expect any great hospitality.Sit.eat.move.It is an open door place and do not have AC.Little warm during summer.

Located almost at the crossing of golpark...just before the petrol pump station...Very much cheap and quantity of food is just about to fill your tummy...which i guess is great...Non ac...but doesnt matter since southern avenue is one of my favourite places to eat because of it's greenery and cold environment...being situated beside the rabindra sarobar lake...have food & visit the lake...thats the plan to make if u wanna visit this place...awesome continental along with chinese and thai as well with a very low budget...trust me...have a go...u wont regret...if u have a low budget...

We ordered : Spicy chilli wings,chilli chicken dry, chicken tetrazini,chicken sizzler,Baked fish...all of them were good with a bit on the salty side...
Again i would say...best place to eat with friends..if u are not wanting something posh...

about everyone in kolkata¬†knows¬†about this place. so what's left to say! we ordered prawn garlic meinfood¬†and thai chicken. well, for both the dishes, quantity was satisfactory and taste was okayish; not something outstanding. the main thing about this place is low pricing which is quite impressive. and also they have varieties¬†of ice cream flavours within a reasonable range. if you are around golpark¬†or gariahat and you feel hungry, go and have a bite without poking a hole in your pocket.

Located just beside hdfc bank's golpark branch, its an extremely pocket friendly place and hence famous among college goers and office goers. 
We ordered the following dishes-
1. Chicken burger- simply yummy ! Has a crunchy patty which enhances the taste! Highly recommended!
2. Chicken lasagne - a baked dish with pasta chicken and loads and loads of cheese! Go for it if you love your cheese!
The bill for both was 195‚Çπ and they don't charge any tax.. 
I'll definitely visit again!! :)

Went to this place few days back.. Located at golpark crossing opposite Ramkrishna mission library.  
Starting with the decor, there is nothing to attract your eyes, a simple mediocre look. One thing I didn't like that the table arrangement lacks privacy, specially the ones in the middle. 
Service is prompt but you need to get up and place the order at the cash counter and serve your own food. 
Now coming to the food we ordered crispy chilly baby corn for starter, then for main  course  mixed fried rice and chicken schezwan noodles and lamb. The lamb was well cooked and I liked the taste. The   rice and the noodles were good but can't say it was mouth watering or this was one of the best that I have had. The schezwan noodles should have been more spicy.
It's budget friendly. If you are in that area or shopping in Gariahat, feel hungry, give it a shot.

If you wish to have some reasonable, yet quality food, then definitely try at the Grub Club. A perfect place to eat and save your pocket. Mostly‚Äã recommended for Students. Serves quality food, quantity is satisfactory.
What I found bad is that they dont have any washroom, only wash basin. Prompt service and kind staffs.
Menu Price inclusive of taxes.

This place had all the qualities to be rated 5 stars, but due to its unhygienic ambiance some points deserves to be out.However, if you don't have a problem with that, you have a budget crunch and you still want to try great food (not to mention great lamb) , you will surprised to find such delicacy around the heart of the city. And yes, they serve great smoothies too.

Coming down to the food.
The chinese food here is a treat for all the taste buds of kolkata.
The lamb and the chicken dishes are something you just can resist.
Serves as one of the best chinese food hubs of kolkata.
A place you shouldn't miss out.
The rates are very reasonable and pocket friendly.
A great place to for big time chinese lovers and foodies.
Go Grab something in Grub Club.

Is situated right opposite of the golpark Ramakrishna mission. Went there with some of my classmates. As we were on a quick visit we ordered for crispy chilly baby corn, and it didn't disappoint us. Crispy from outside and juicy from inside. This place is always filled with people mainly students. Don't expect an outstanding decor. But I must say that your money will be valued in terms of food quality and quantity.

A combo of the Chicken wanton-chicken rice-chilli chicken-dessert‚Äã.
Chicken Thai Platter(with green curry)
Strawberry Lassi
Blueberry Shake

Now, the food was good, quantity excellent(considering the combo platter) and the dessert deserves a special mention for the innovative and creative endeavour.The staff is well-behaved and the total experience comes off as really nice.The place sure does deserve more visits.

A great pocket friendly joint serving delicious food at affordable prices. Comes very handy while in Golpark vicinity and scouting for decent place to eat. 
They do have options from multiple cuisine within the menu but mine always is the continental preparation. Chicken a la kiew or Grilled fish with Garlic bread. Apart from pasta and lasagna. 

Ambience is minimum and their take always are good too.  A piece of advice, They should really work on their  preparation time.

Simple yet delicious food. You will get multiple cuisine here. I prefer to order continental food more often here. They serve good Chinese also. My favorite dishes are chicken lasagna, chicken pasta, chicken burger from the continental. And one another dish I like here is mixed thupka. It is such a healthy yet delicious dish that u can't miss it if you are planing to go there. The only thing I dislike about this place is, it is a non-ac restaurant which sometimes becomes very tough in summer to eat there.

The Grub Club is one of my favourite hang-out places after college. It's food is good and affordable, and the ambiance is also comfortable. I've had honey chicken lollipops, spicy chicken wings, Fish fry, fried rice and shakes here. The chicken dishes are great. The quantity is really proportional to the amount they charge. The service isn't very slow, and the main road location makes it easily accessible.

This is the famous food attraction for youngsters in Golpark. We see friends going for light snacks and also families going for meals. It has a wide range of Chinese cuisine. 
The age-old crispy chili babycorn, dry chili chicken and other starters are must orders. Do try their lamb dishes. The chicken lasagna is to die for. I have been visiting this place since my school days and it has never failed me even once. The combos, the continental dishes, meifoon and others are all their speciality. The place might not look attractive but the food will make you forget about every other detail. 
The service is commendable, they are always ready at hand. The food is spectacular. The price is very pocket friendly. A must try for all college and school students.

This one is a great pocket-friendly place to hang out, whiIle getting to indulge in the huge variety of menu they provide. Everything has a decent quality and taste and I have been here quite a few times now. 
For starters Chicken wings and chicken honey lollipops are the best bet. I love their continental main courses like Chicken Stroganoff, Chicken tetrazzini. If you are tighter on budget, grab their combo meals which are served really quick and is quite remarkable. Even the thai combo tastes nice for the price they are asking. Don't miss the desserts, they have really amazing chocolate delicacies soaked in ice-creams and chocolate sauce, which is a must try. 
The service and ambiance are okay. Things look clean and fresh. Great worth of money.

So we got our table front of wash room section.  Then we settle down but one plastic chair and other one steel chair but plastic little bit uncomfortable,  so we requested one stuff for change the chair. Unfortunately firstly he didn't respond and ignoring then he was standing front of us and thinking twice of time then he changed the chair.  He didn't have any experiences how to manage their customers. But other hand other  two staffs served our food very carefully and behaviour also good and polite. We're ordered lat me kai chicken and egg chicken chow. For first time visit it was a bad experience.

Pocket friendly is a term I associate with the place.

I need to take a special mention of the Lasagne and burger they serve though, finger licking good!!!!!

Been going at this place since my college days and it never dissatisfies me ever. For the value for money its easily the best place to sit and have some good food. Last week i went in woth my friends and they have never had chopsuey before. As were kind of full amd looking for a light note we ordered a konjee chicken and an american chopsuey. The konjee chicken was  tasty and the portion was just enough for the four of us. Then the american chopsuey arrived. It was tasty although a bit sweet for my taste bud. All in all it was good food and satisfaction for which u don't ever have to burn a hole in your pocket!

A very good place to hangout. They always maintain their quality. I tried chicken sizzler and it was lip-smacking dish and also tried chicken momo. The momo and soup was good but the sauce was too oily. Otherwise other foods were delicious.

Food has always pleased us and there is no love greater than the love for food for Us !
Grub Club is one of the most famous food joints in Golpark and is always filled with college goers and youngsters all day long! So we also landed here on an evening after our college for some quick food!
The ambience is  very lively as the place is always gushing with people!  
Coming to food- We ordered Veg Steamed momos; Veg Chinese Combo and Lasagna! 
Momos were good and perfectly steamed. 
Veg Chinese combo was great deal since they serve a chinese gravy, rice/noodles and spring rolls in it for a really affordable price! The quality and quantity was good enough! 
Lasagna was not good at all and we not recommend it! 
Overall a college goers place and for a quick grab on food!

The Grub Club is an eatery located near Golpark, which mainly serves Chinese & Thai dishes.

Ambience is simple with nice sitting arrangements.

Service is good.

Tried Chicken Schezwan chow & Spicy Chicken wings. Both were well made and were lip smacking. Quantity was enough.

Pocket pinch is reasonable.

It's hard for me to rate this place any lower than 4. Not because it's very posh and the food is to-die-for. No. It's because there's a sense of nostalgia attached with this place. I have been a regular here since my early college days. It's nice to see that, despite additions to the menu and the passage of time (almost 7 years now), the quality of food has not deteriorated. I love the spicy chicken wings, the crispy chicken, the crispy chilli potato and the chicken garlic meifoon. Mind you, the ambiance is not something to write home about. This is actually a good place if you are a college crowd. The bustling environment actually pairs well with the spicy food. A few things to keep in mind, though. Stay away from their continental menu. And stay away from offbeat items. I once ordered tempura chicken with great zest, only to realise that they actually meant Tangerine Chicken when they said Tempura Chicken. But the regular dishes: the drumsticks, the crispy chilli potato, the chicken wings, the chowmein, the meifoon, the fried rice and the staples like chilli chicken, manchurian chicken and schezwan chicken, that's their forte. That's where they shine.

Went to have food at this place after many years. We were so hungry that I forgot to take any photo of our order. BTW, we had steamed momo, dry chilli chicken and chicken sausages. Momos were good enough. They were steaming hot and arrived within three minutes of billing. Dry chilli chicken arrived after some minutes but they were too salty, so we had a replacement as soon as we cancelled it. Then came sausages. I am a huge sausage lover, but i never had it the way they served them. They were cut into pieces which lost the charm. The preparation was good but it took around 20 minutes to arrive. Overall okay type. I want my sausages full, not chopped at all.

The main reason to visit this place was to taste the chicken tetrazini (which was supposed to contain baked chicken with mushroom,corns and noodles and cheese) but unfortunately it disappointed us. Neither the smell nor the appearance and ofcourse not the taste of this dish could able to win our heart. Though the other dishes which we ordered were tasty and worthy. Other than chicken tetrazini we ordered chili honey chicken, honey chicken lollypop, crispy fried corn.. all these starters were too good.and yeah the desserts and ice creams are also heartmelting.. we had choco caramel, choco delight, kesar lassi and cold coffee too. All the photos are attached herewith.

I can't count how many times I've been to this place. Since I was in 9th Grade I've been to this place.

We used to give birthday treats here as it was cheap and pocket friendly.

We still visit this place.

I've nothing to write about this place most of the people living in Kolkata has visited this place.

This place doesn't give you privacy its open to all. Its average restaurant and its cheap good for college goers.

The food here is excellent at cheap price. Sometimes they vary in quantity or quality but you can eat peacefully here.

The dessert here is served in a very well manner better than any other restaurant in kolkata.

I absolutely love this place. Since my college days I've  been a regular here. The variety of food that they offer at such a reasonable price is really amazing. Every winter I make sure to visit this place twice for the delectable pastas and momos. Recently visited again to try the newly added cheesy Alfredo and spaghetti bolognaise. Also tried the tooti frooti sundae. Quality and quantity wise they have never disappointed me and If you ask me how they taste? Oh my! Both pasta and the spaghetti were so yummy that every bite I had simply melted inside my mouth. The correct amount of sauted olives,peppers and corns simply added the extra zing to both the dishes. The tooti frooti was also good. The staff is very courteous and always takes extra care for each and every customer, which is why they earn the extra brownie points for being prompt and quick. 
I'll advice college goers to visit this place once if you really want to have quality food that too at a reasonable price.

Service is extremely poor. I had to wait for around 40 minutes to get a baked fish which they stated would be ready in 15 minutes.
Yes, the price is dirt cheap. But the continental dishes didn't seem to make the cut. The baked fish had a awful smell and I couldn't eat. Chicken augratin is tolerable. Chicken Tetrazzini is just edible.
Ambience and decor had a feel of college canteen.

It's painful how much higher Grub Club could have been rated, yet isn't because they lack execution of the basics. Value for Money isn't easily come across anymore, and Grub Club perseveres in this endeavor.

Their service is downright average. It'll take them forever to serve, and it's not exactly the most pleasant place to wait. The joint isn't air conditioned, which makes for a very pleasant winter meal. The tables, chairs, cutlery and crockery are primarily plastic. The entire restaurant has an aura of providing the bare necessities. While the ambience and service aren't good, it's important to remember that if you're walking into Grub Club, you shouldn't be expecting much in the first place.

The food is where Grub Club manages to redeem itself to an extent. While their portions aren't very good, their prices are. At 150-220 for a single person, you won't find much better. Their food is decent enough, and it isn't very easy to find fault with. Their Tetrazzini however, isn't very good. It felt a little bland, and put together somewhat incoherently. I'd recommend sticking to the Chinese, I recall that being very edible, or ordering a roast of some sort.

Ambience/Interiors: 2/5
Service: 2/5
Food: 3/5
Value for Money: 3.5/5

Thanks for reading and pardon any grammatical errors I may have made.

Recently when they started serving continental I had tried Lasagne, baked fish, pasta, chicken sizzler, chicken alfredo, garlic bread, spraghetti bolognese. However recently I tried roast chicken with bbq sauce and it was indeed good and there array of continental dishesh are really good. Among chinese Lat ma kai and also thai sweet chick wings served with seasame seeds to also worth a mention.

Ambience : Nothing to write home about. There is a tree right through the restaurant, seating is okay and you might even have to share a table with strangers!
            

But the best thing about this place is good food at dirt cheap prices!

Food:

*chicken spring rolls : Crispy crunchy spring rolls witch delicious filling served steaming hot with ketchup. I loved the rolls.

* Hakka noodles with chilli chicken : Hakka noodles was very well done. Chilli chicken was good too. The chicken pieces were good and they provide 8 pieces per plate!

I'd definitely recommend this place if you want a low budget value for money meal!¬†

P.s- they charge 14.5% VAT!

Being a regular customer at Grub Club, was taken by surprise yesterday!
Ordered for a Combo for 150/- and was about to give the Cashier my debit card, when I was informed that unless the bill amount is 300/-, cards will not be accepted!!
Well, there is absolutely no mandate about the amount that one can swipe through card at any place, so basically you are forcing customers to increase your business volume?? You do not accept old currencies, which is totally acceptable, but what about card payments!! It is malpractice and unethical...You cannot possibly force your customers to gulp more food...A combo is fine for me, but I could not have it because I was told to EAT MORE!! Ridiculous, given you have been in this business for so long and I have had good food at your joint so many times! If you want to prepare yourself to upgrade, then do upgrade the attitude and business practice first! One BAD review might not matter to your business, but if you start taking your customers too lightly, then......

It's hard to miss grub club if you are a frequent goer of dhakuria lake. We started going this place at college time. Recently after 6 long years visited this place and loved it again. 
Don't expect nice decor or service here. It don't have ac also so may be it's tough in summer.
Food is quite satisfactory. I liked their dry chili chicken. Earlier we used to like the sausage very much. But this time it disappointed me a little. It's spicy tangy taste killed the original flavour of sausage. Otherwise I liked it.
If you are visiting dhakuria lake or near by give it a try in low pocket pinch. Otherwise it's ideal for take away and home delivery also.

One of the best value for money restaurants I've been to. The quantity is good and the quality is more than enough. We ordered the Chinese combo and spicy chicken wings. In the Chinese combo we ordered fried rice and Chilli paneer. The fried rice was okay, Nothing out of the ordinary but the paneer was just mind blowing. It was luscious and creamy and not at all hard and rubbery like most restaurants serve.However the gravy of the paneer was not up to the mark.
Special mention to the spicy chicken wings. They were awesome!! Crispy and spicy it is definitely one of the best dishes in the restaurant. Must try if you visit this place.

Ordered combo Chineese meal. Opted for Rice & Veg Manchurian (Chilli Paneer / Noodles were also option given). 

Price : 130/-. 

Quantity was more than enough to fill a luncheon appetite. However the manchurian balls were so stiff that I had to really put good enough pressure to cut them into pieces. Usage of black sauce was over I found. Rice quality & taste wise was satisfactory.

One of the older and nostalgic restaurants from my childhood days. The food is quite good, although you can‚Äôt expect top-notch quality as compared to the medium-to-high end restaurants.¬†

Located on Southern Avenue, just a stone's throw away from the Golpark rotary, and with moderately priced and decent quality food, even today it's easily a favourite hangout spot for young people - school, college guys, and young couples in South Kolkata.

The service is average, specially if it's overcrowded, you may have to wait for sometime to be served. It's not an enclosed restaurant, so don't expect to sit in air-conditioned comfort...!! My personal favourite is the Grub Club Special Fried rice. 

Overall, it's a moderately cheap outlet to satisfy your gastric cravings - be it snacks (e.g. rolls, momos) or full-fledged meals (e.g. chinese dishes). A good try if you are on a budget.

Always crowded. And v.famous among college goers. Overall a nice hangout zone. Highly recommended.

One of the older and nostalgic restaurants from my childhood days. The food is quite good, although you can‚Äôt expect top-notch quality as compared to the medium-to-high end restaurants.¬†

Located on Southern Avenue, just a stone's throw away from the Golpark rotary, and with moderately priced and decent quality food, even today it's easily a favourite hangout spot for young people - school, college guys, and young couples in South Kolkata.

The service is average, specially if it's overcrowded, you may have to wait for sometime to be served. It's not an enclosed restaurant, so don't expect to sit in air-conditioned comfort...!! My personal favourite is the Grub Club Special Fried rice. 

Overall, it's a moderately cheap outlet to satisfy your gastric cravings - be it snacks (e.g. rolls, momos) or full-fledged meals (e.g. chinese dishes). A good try if you are on a budget.

Both the items were really tasty. Actually wanted to order grilled chicken sandwich bit it was not available. The fish fry was little bit small in size but tasted great.

This place is pretty easily accessible.  
My ratings of this place are as follows :
Ambience :7/10
Behaviour of staff :6/10
Food :8/10
The prices are reasonable.  
Pan fried momo and Fried Momo, both are good. 
Steamed Wantons are average.
Prawn fries were okayish.  And the blue lagoon drink is soul satisfying.  
Do give this one a try whenever  you get a chance.

The crispy chilli baby corn is also worth a try. So whenever low in cash, but craving spicy juicy chicken, grub club is the place guys.

Lately this joint has raised its standard of food by a lot of means and they serve them at very affordable prices. Located at the prime of golpark, this is an all time favourite joint. Though lacks an ac, the food will attract you over and over again. Also takeaway and home delivery is provided.
The baked dishes are perfection. I am a fan of their meat lasagna!!
Also I have tried the baked fish, and the fish was so so tender it just melted along with the cheese and bechamel sauce ... blissfully yum.
This attracts lot of college going gangs, because of their pocket friendly rates.

Quantity is also great. And the price for everything is pocket friendly for both students and adults. A lovely little place down in South Calcutta and is a must, must place to visit.

However with lots of hatred and anger I would like to high light it that neither we got¬† a call from them nor any¬†other update¬†from them. I think they cannot attract customers by good food indeed they try to pickpocket their balance with a vague reply.

Visited here at saptami night.
The place was a bit crowded. It has a pre paid system, where you have to go to the counter and order, pay the money and take the bill to your table. A waiter will take the bill from your table and will serve accordingly.
Food ordered- we wanted to go safe so ordered a fried rice n chicken combo, a chowmein combo nd a veg chow combo.. there were 4 pieces of chicken in each of the combo.
Quantity- the combo is enough to serve a person of medium appetite.
Quality- the fried rice was ok, low on oil, the chicken pieces were good but the gravy was watery. The chow was oily.
Ambience- a decent place to sit and dine. No fancy. Also no AC.
Price- combo was Rs.150 each. They have vat inclusive menu, hence they do not charge any extra money. The place is quite reasonable.
Overall a good place to dine if you are near golpark and is searching for a decent and pocket friendly eatery.
Next time I would surely try their brownie. It looked magnetic. üòç

Seemed like home coming being a student of Nava Nalanda. This resturant is famous for us Naladites for its cheap varities and space for chit chat. Though the experience was a little sour, or might say too sweet to handle. The price is as usual affordable and the place was bursting with peoples due to Puja season. We ordered American choupsuey. The noodles were great but th gravy was too much of sweet and sour. The Fish Fry was a ok type. The service was as usual good and the ambience,what to say great for all young blood.

This restaurant is located right opposite the main gate of RKM Golpark , and is a popular eatery with a pocket friendly menu . The place has rows of small tables and the billing has to be done before you are served your food. The food is served fairly quick , and the mocktails menu is provided separately . The chicken fried wantons I had here tasted good ,and were served piping hot ! The crispy outer layer containing a chicken filling is a chinese equivalent of good ol' singara , and is perfect for adda on a rainy day . The paneer pan fried momo tasted good , with an onion and garlic sauce , and is slightly spicy for those who do not prefer the heat of chillies . The badam lassi was thick and sweet and a filling end to the meal . The place seemed like a pocket friendly adda zone , and is ever crowded with the young and hungry . Would love to visit again !

My favourite place. I always start with chicken wings after that PAN fried chicken momo. It's my starter here. Then the Chinese food of this restaurant is comparable to all restaurants which charges much more for the same kind of taste and quality. Grub club is pocket friendly and if you want to taste awesome Chinese food within budget . Please visit without wasting anytime as surely you will not repent. I love Grub club from my college days , still now  I love this place.

Went there today after a prolonged shopping session and filled our empty stomachs with some good foods in a pocket friendly price. We chose to eat the Chinese section and ordered Vegetable fried rice along with Sanghai Chicken. This is just a simple and affordable roadside eatery with comfortaUble seating and quite clean ambiance. The food came up after 15 minutes. The quantity of the rice was more than enough for two of us and quality was also upto the mark. The Chicken item was yummy with spicy gravy. Both the quality and quantity was satisfactory. Overall a nice place for eating at affordable price.

In one word if you have not been there make sure you try it out.Great food and value for money.

Re-visiting the good old days .¬†

The Grub Club was one of our fav dining places during the start of professional career. The food is awesome , prices are pocket friendly.¬†Muyst try items, Fish Fry, Any chinese rice or noodle items, Chilly fish , Lasagna, Ice Creams or Shakes. Only one suggestion to the management, if you can arrange few more fans inside. May be that would give some relief to us. :)¬†The rest is just great. Will visit again for the second Round ;)

I ordered chilli garlic pepper chicken through swiggy...
Horrible food,they don't know how to prepare the same & I think they should visit famous Chinese restaurants like golden joy or Beijing in china town to know how the food should be or taste...
Too bad...

friday afternoon around 7.30pm, I went with 3 of my friends for a chit chat with some delicious snacks.
You need to decide the order from the menu, pay the bill and show it to the serving boy then they will serve the order.

Service was quick enough. Quantity was sufficient for four person.

There was also a menu called daily special, written on the black board near billing counter.

We ordered fish fry with Mayonnaise. It was made of real Bhetki, you can smell it also. It was so mouth watering and that I forgot to take photos for the rest :D

Honey Chicken was next. But it was not up to the mark, stiff hard and felt little under cooked and raw from inside.

Hot man-chow show was also tasty.

pan fried fish I didn't like that much, it was made of Basa fish, with no taste of fish at all.

Chili Garlic Pepper Chicken also good. but not great.

This is a non AC restaurant. However the pocket pinch is a lot less. The food is average. For a college student, this is the ideal. Don't expect to be served without any waiting time as this place is always full. The location of Grub place makes it such a popular joint.

The Grub Club is mostly famous & all time crowded among young stars of south Kolkata. Affordable price tag adds another charm to this club. Lets be a member for a day & see what they offer to impress us...

Location : Just beside the Golpark HDFC Bank.

Decorations : Sitting arrangements reminds me of old school canteen over here. A long horizontal sitting is in the middle & others are divided for small groups. Just in front of that the kitchen is located. Walls are painted with vibrant colors. A lot of space inside makes it feel like open environment. An interesting thing is that their dining is constructed by keeping a tree in the middle. They didn't cut that, that's the thing everybody should learn. Other things are very basic. Anyway the restaurant is non AC therefore in summer days it may be uncomfortable for some people.

Staffs & Management : Just like canteen system you need to first pay here & take a token against it. After that showing it you will get your order on table. This makes it easy for them but if you want to order something else then it adds a little hassle to your job. However their service felt slow & you may have to wait for your orders.

Foods : Fast foods to shakes & juice they have covered all the loved items to choose from. We ordered the following...

Egg Chowmein : Unlike some places there Chowmein wasn't sticky. Vegitables were chopped very nicely but was very less. Noodles quantity was very average. It was bit oily & less amount of spices were there. Therefore it tasted very light & a side dish with it is must needed.

Crispy Chilli Potato : The potato sticks were really crispy fried outside & soft from inside. It was mixed with very thin sliced pieces of onion, chillies & capsicum. It was bit oily. But the best part was the balance of spices were mixed with it, that made it taste so wonderful. It was such a new kind of lovely tasty starter that makes it a must try over here.

Chilli Chicken : After a great treat of Chilli Potato, Chilli Chicken disappointed us to the extreme. Chicken pieces were excessive small with a thick layer of cornflower on its body. On the other hand gravy was very lite & tasted like hot garlic soup. It even ruined the taste of main dish when mixed. I don't know why their Chilli Chicken is in Known for list on Zomato but for me its not recommended to anyone.

Pricing : Menu card pricing is designed by keeping in mind of college students pocket. Therefore foods are affordable & value for money. As an added bonus they don't take any taxes with that too.

Conclusion : The Grub Club is a good option for quick bites as well as friends hangout. As it is located near to Lake Garden its a nice joint for daily walkers of that place. However foods could have been much better.

A very cheap priced non ac addazone restaurant. Rather I would say It is more like a conference room with the facility of having food of your choice. Nice place. Ambience is not at all good but One can get good quality food at a very low proce in an area like golpark!!

This a simple dine-in located in Golpark. It has a live pasta, desserts and juice counter. I've eaten here on multiple occasions. The quantity they serve is good. Chinese dishes are more in quantity than continental ones. I was really surprised at how good their lasagne is. Their chicken stroganoff is decent. Chinese dishes don't disappoint. It is one of those places where you know you order and eat to your hearts content and yet will not pinch your pockets much. No wonder its been thriving for so long.

For a restaurant situated in the Golpark area this place sure is easy on the pocket. Very simple d√©cor, good food and a impressive menu they offer. The service is not bad but not impressive either. Quantity is standard except for a few items which leaves much to be desired. The prices of the menu is inclusive of taxes so u know exactly where to spend the dime. Various chicken items are offered here and some of them are very very good. :)

"The place" to go to when you are short in cash but dying to eat some decent chinese food. Popular among the college goers. Whether it's Cantonese rice or hakka noodles or honey lollipop or Singapore chicken..grub club doesn't disappoint when it comes to taste, quality and of course the quantity.Reasonably priced and lots of options to choose from.Their ice cream counter deserves a mention . Suitable for a public gathering.For a private dining experience this place is an absolute no-no.

This continues to be one of the most popular zones for the youth of the city from a long time. Good for snacks and mini-meals. Impressed with their Italian cuisine. The downside is the lack of an AC section even in the unbearable weather of Kolkata.

Well in honesty, anyone who can afford to pay just a bit more for some good food, should definitely avoid this place. I had the misfortune of having dinner here on two occasions, both of which were totally unsatisfactory. They may call themselves a restaurant, but their age old ways of going to the counter and paying for the food always gave me a feeling that I was sitting in some random food court. The lack of AC may be excuses, but only if their service was amicable. The food is definitely not up to mark. I have had Chinese as well as North Indian here. The Chinese tastes like any local roll and chowmein shop - nothing special there. The North Indian is actually worse than that. I visited during the pujas once and was served cold chicken chap with a chicken biryani which had clearly been reheated, as the rice had hardened. All in all - not a satisfactory experience. Maybe its OK for school students, who cannot afford to go to the big places due to limited pocket money, but even they would do better to avoid this place. I do not usually write a negative review, but cannot help it when the food and the service are not up to the mark.

There is no place better in golpark when it comes to pocket-friendly delicious food. The restaurant is non - ac and very simple in terms of decor but non of it matters when you have their spicy chicken wings (a MUST try), any of the ice creams or their chicken noodles and steamed wantons as well as momos. The lasagna is average. Have been a regular visitor throughout my stay in gariahaat, trust me its worth it. :)

I had heard high praises about this place and decided to visit. It was decent, above average. But I did not feel it was mindblowing. Yes, if one is looking for a whole lot of offerings, this is the place to be. They make most of the Chinese preparations that we know of and a whole lot of Continental (mainly Italian) dishes that people are not so familiar with. So it gets a thumbs up for new tasters. However, the continental dishes are not superb if you compare them to other dedicated continental restaurants. But keeping the price in mind, it is more than decent. We had the cream of chicken soup, augratine, tetrazini, chicken sizzler, lasagna and ice cream. The dishes were cooked well, the lasagna was better than the others. Do not compare with genuine continental restaurants, it will fail miserably. Quantity is good enough. Service is decent. In a nutshell, it is a good place to hang out in a convenient price range. Food is more than decent. Worth a try.

My go-to place for Crispy Chilli Babycorn and Gravy noodles!
Compelling pricing meets great taste at this restaurant at Golpark.
Always a fan of the ambience where friends can chill and couples can also have a quick and filling meal.
The delicious offering ensures that me and my folks always rely on their home delivery system to quench pangs of hunger for chinese and now, even for Thai and Continental!
There Thai Chicken Green Curry is a delicious new favourite of mine, as is their Chicken Tetrazzini! The aroma of the thai curry where the lemongrass flirts with coconut-y flavours makes one want to marry the dish! And then it all comes together to entice the tastebuds!!

Their drinks and desserts counter is quite impressive with the quality of drinks they serve. The sweet lime soda has just the right equation of a love triangle with the sweet, tang and fizz!
A great place to eat to your hearts content without malnourishing the pocket! A favourite for some good old comfort food!

A South Calcutta institution, I've been going to Grub Club since the day they opened. They've had quite a ride, and I can't really review this place objectively. My family and I've eaten so many meals under that "shed", and had so many meals delivered in those big white cardboard boxes stuffed to the brim with noodles, accompanied by that light, creamy garlic chicken in white plastic tubs. We've never bothered with the Indian, Italian, Ice creams and whatever else they started serving to cater to the new breed of clients. Us old timers stick to the classics - Fried momos, thukpa, meifoon, garlic chicken, fried rice, chilly fish, Choi sum, and spring rolls. Literally a part of my childhood, and adulthood. Great portions, ridiculously reasonable, consistent taste and quality. Also, thanks to the owners for taking special care of Dadu.

It is a place we have been visiting since our college days. Everything about this place is youthful and fun. A very pocket friendly joint. And a single serving must serve two people. The best thing about this place is no string attached to the bill. No extra taxes, nothing. The starters and the noodles are the main attractionsbof their menu. Also, you should try their variety of ice-creams. Nonetheless, a graet place for college kids and for a quick hunger at the end of the month.

It's pretty easy to locate, Near the golpark petrol pump.

At Golpark towards Lake on the right side is Grub club. A big sitting area with a tree right at the center. Not too flashy, no AC but very subtle and friendly place. Mainly good for snacks but other heavy food are also available. This place is actually for College crowd. Reasonable price good ambiance more like side walk shops in foreign countries. 2 seater, 4 seater and multi seat arrangements. Good food. Actually great food.  White sauce pasta here is superb. Drumsticks are also good. We recently went with Parents. Had Drumsticks and Virgin Mojhito as starters. In the main course we had Burnt Ginger Mixed Chowmein, Mixed fried rice and Chilli Chicken. All were good. No complains. Price? Rs 500 for 4 people. Must try.

The food quality at present is even better than what it used to be a couple of years back. The combos are good, pan fried momos are delicious also the lasagne and other continental items are pretty good. Ambiance is homely and the staff is prompt. Instead of average desserts out here try out the golas available here. :)

Me and my friend went there for lunch. A sudden planning it was though. For being a pocket friendly place and also I didn't explore it before, we came here. Ordered chicken chowmein and chicken with sweet garlic sauce.

After tasting the dishes I have to say that they take their dishes' name way too seriously. The chicken with sweet garlic sauce was too sweet and I assume that they dipped the fried chicken in tomato sauce and served it that way.
Chicken chowmein was served hot and okay it was not bad. Fresh lime soda was also good. Service is ok.

All in all the place is ok when you have to think about your pocket and the quantity as well.

The good old food joint serving at golpark since my childhood, perhaps. Every individual has their own favorite here, mine is their crispy chilli lamb, drums of heaven, baby corn and mixed gravy noodles. Been visiting this place from school days (mostly after tuition meals meant grub club). This is non ac, dimly lit interior, qsr seating arrangement, but located in a prime area. Service sometimes becomes slow in rush hours, but who cares , when its grub club u can be rest assured good quantity and tasty food coming your way.

My go to places during the college days. Reminds me so of old times. This place is definitely for the young crowd. And upon entering, you would see a sea of young people bonding over food. 

This place is best for the long adda sessions. This is a no frills place. Sit, order, pay, eat and leave. Oh yes, they don't charge you VAT. 

Among the standouts are the Honey Lollipop Chicken and the Chicken Pan Fried Momo. Over the years Grub Club has been known for their momo. Although it has deteriorated a bit, but it's still, worth trying. 

For the mains, I love their Chowmein Thai Style(Non Veg). The Pan Fried Noodles is good enough but you would bw disappointed if you expect great things out of it. Most of the chicken dishes are bland enough. That is why, all I stick to is, Garlic/Chilli Chicken. They even serve Mexican as well which I have not tried as of yet.

This place has now replaced my takeaway category more than my dine in category. Worth ordering food from Grub Club.

Located near golpark. Very easy to find out this place . 
It has nice seating arrangements. You can have table for two table for four or group tables 
We had ordered the honey chicken wings, fish fry, chilly chicken, chicken Manchurian, garlic chicken and fried wantons. The food was really nice in respect to their price. It's a must go-to place for college students. It'll not leave a dent in your wallet .
Only thing , their drinks were not upto the mark . Would not recommend it.

One of my all time favorites from school days. I often come here to dine out and even order for to go. Must try the Meifoon here which is most delicious. And also the lamb. The quantity is sufficient and a perfect value for money. The service is all right. And they serve a real good range of  Chinese flavors is quite a affordable rate. And lastly the ice cream counter is a must visit. I like all of them.

This has been such a popular eatery of South Kolkata for such a long time now. That they have stood the test of time is in itself a testimonial to the fact that they do maintain top notch quality. A very popular place amongst college goers and all, I have been visiting as well as ordering food from here for the last 15 years. Keep it simple is the mool mantra for this place. 
Have had various stuff here....the last order being Hong Kong Fried rice, Grub Club Special Chowmein, Chicken Manchurian Chowmein, Fish with Chilli and Lemon Grass, Red Hot Chicken, Tempura Chicken. Have also tasted their Chilli Chicken, Manchurian Chicken etc. Hard to really single out one or two dishes.....all the dishes exude quality. The quantity served is also sufficient. 
Only drawback in my eyes is that this place needs to have an Air Conditioner for those who are dining here.
To go to this place or order from here needs no motivation....just the name is enough.

The go to place for cheap and decent food, the only con is that they don't have an ac and during the summers it is really hot, especially if you are sitting near the kitchen.¬†
Must try are the thukpa and chicken alfredo. The sundaes can be tried as well.

Grub club has a special place in my heart. I'm going there for 12 years now. It's ironic that I could write a review of it after so long. This is the place for college goers. Even at this age of inflation It's still pocket friendly. The ambience is quite nice. It is commendable that how they kept the tree and built around it. Food are quite tasty if u consider the low price. In recent times I haven't have food from grub club. But I still go there for the sundaes.

Pros:
1. Location
2. Pocket friendly.

Cons:
1. Non AC
2. Food is not high standard. But of course u get what u pay for.

Good food at affordable rates thats all i can say about this place. Cant say anything about the ambience coz never visited the restaurant. Ordered a chicken rice, chilli chicken  and chicken wonton combo via swiggy. Packaging well done. Coming to food quantity its more than enough for 1 person. At a sum of only 160 got a good amount of fried rice, chilli chicken(4 pieces) was really good and loved the chicken wontons. Wontons were crispy , not soggy and the filling was too good. Overall a good restaurant :)

The Grub Club is one of the most pocket friendly food hut around the city. As we are off from a music fest at around 10 PM. We need to get something to eat. One of my friend takes us to this hut, it was crowded that night. Best known for their noodles but we wanted to try something different so we ordered American Chopsuey at instant. Experimenting the different taste might become horrible to us for that night. It was harsh and tough to swallow. Though it was a lesson learnt dinner for us that night.üò¢üòÇüò£

So, tried the Fish Fry, the dry Chili Fish and the Choco Delight ice cream today. The food is finger-licking fresh. While the fillet was well marinated with herbs, uniformly coated in batter, properly deep fried and served with mustard sauce, the cubes, sauteed in onions, green chili and capsicum, tasted juicy. All of it were a delight for the mouth. At the end, the ice cream furthered that feeling of joy with its extravagant chocolatey-ness. Overall, a fine experience.

My most frequently visited place. My visit has increased since the past two years. Their quality of food has detoriated since I know this place for 7 years now.¬†Ambiance, service is good.

I LIKE THEIR: Pan fried chicken momo, it's my favourite, I love the sauce (UPDATE: The quality has deteriorated drastically and I have stopped ordering it anymore which is really sad because it used to be my favourite dish here). ¬†Also simply chicken fried momos or wantons. Crispy chicken. Chilli garlic pepper chicken. Mixed thukpa (even though their ingredients keep changing like.. sometimes they put hardly one or two pieces of¬†broccoli¬†and sometimes they don't put at all, or sometimes the salt is really less, and sometimes their baby corns and shrimps are stale and you have to separate them out, but then sometimes it tastes so perfect with all the flavour of the vegetables in the stalk.. you wanna order it again! You gotta rely on your luck for that, may be). Korean fried chicken (they use "gondho lebu paata" in the batter that coats the chicken marinated in lemon and then is deep fried, leaving a very fresh flavour in your mouth, and it is provided with, I suppose, something they tried making similar to Kimchi, with an indianised touch) [UPDATE: The last dish that would pull me to this place and now this one's spoiled too. They don't even have the time to marinate the chicken with "gondholebu" anymore]. Fish fry with mayonnaise and french fries. Crispy chhili baby corn. Mixed fried rice. Hot garlic chicken (gravy). Spicy lamb. Chicken chopsuey. Lassagna. Tutti Fruitti ice cream (it suggests one scoop of vanilla and another scoop of strawberry but once were fooled with both scoops of vanilla and when we complained he said it looked white but is flavoured strawberry since then I always stand and watch while they make it at the ice cream counter). Tropical Black Forest.

I DIDN'T LIKE THEIR: Cold coffee or strawberry shake. Chicken steamed momo (it was too moist and soggy, also, the sauce they provided with it was stale). Mixed Chowmein (I find some street stall chowmein tastier). Konjee Crispy Chicken (because they put tomato sauce all over). Chicken Drumsticks (they are ok-ok). Chicken wings (I think they have made the coating really thick now comparing it to 3 years before). Mixed Schezchuan fried rice. Soups. Chicken asparagus soup was the worst. NEVER TRY IT! Sliced Lamb in green pepper. Chilli chicken (gravy). Fried chicken legs (it was bloody and raw from inside and on complaining, they replaced it). Chicken with broccoli and pepper (I just liked the broccolis :P). Burger. Pasta. Chicken A la king.

Located at the golpark circle end. 

Decent food at low prices. And no additional taxes to that. Garlic chicken, tetrazzini, combos are a must try here. 
Not a place where you can try experimenting with the food. Keep it simple. Helpful staff. All in all, a warm pocket friendly place.

This outlet located at the entrance of the Southern Avenue corridor from Golpark crossing is a hot favorite among the students and quick biters. The outlet does not have an AC and feels more like a open cafe from the middle east. To the irony, it serves Chinese and Thai food ! :)
Coming to the food, my recommendations are Spicy Chicken Wings, Chicken Pan fried momo and Chicken Szechuan Noodles. The price is vey less compared to the good quantity they serve. So, thumps up to the team and I recommend this restaurant for a try out !

The Grub Club is one of the most famous food joints for students. The reason for it is one big factor which is price. The unbelievable price and the quality of food they provide is exquisite. The combos here are all time hits. They have some great combos which will definitely ooze your taste buds. The staffs here will be always nice to you and will treat you well. The only thing which they lack is the time management. They take a little more time than they should take. The ambience is not that great, its just a place to sit and have some food. The one necessity in summers is AC, which they don't have and which is a big drawback as I think. 

What to order?
There are so many things you can order but these are the things you can definitely go for:

#The Chinese Combo: You will get Chicken Fried Rice/Noodles , Chilly Chicken , Chicken Wantons and a dessert.

#Crispy Chilli Babycorn: The Crispy Chilli Babycorn is bit oily but its definitely worth trying

There are many other items I am forgetting but there are several other things you can go for. There is a juice and shake section which is another place to look for.

Last Words:
Cheap and very best. This reason would be enough for you to visit this place.

4/5 for its value for money.

The Grub Club is this pocket friendly restaurant in Golpark.
The decor is simple and it can accommodate upto 30 people minimum. My patent order is the Chicken Fried Rice and the Garlic/ Chilli Chicken. The Tempura Fish is another brilliant item there. I have also tried their Chopsuey. I found it a bit too sweet. The chicken drumaticks are good too.
The service is a little slow. But the price and good quality of the food is worth the wait.

cost- 1200/- for 5 people
ambience- 4/10 ( not recommended for romantic dates at all! Ac should be installed)
location- very easy to find the place near the golpark more
service- 6/10 (a bit difficult as the customer has to go to the counter desk at the entrance of the restro to give orders. nd even he has to pay in advance. Then the waiters will serve the food to your table.)

I Recommend to the college going students as this place is quite pocket friendly!

Oh. What shall I say about this place. There is not a single item that I haven't tried here. Grub Club have passed the main three plus points  required for a high rated restaurant with flying colours. Quality Quantity and price. 95% of the foods are mouth watering. Quantity is more than enough. 2 plate fried rice or noodles is enough for 3 persons easily. Side dishes or starters are sufficient.  Prices are also reasonable. No taxes. One more positive point is its variety of food. Coming to negative point there is no ac. Too problematic to have lunch here at summer morning. Nothing to obstruct sunlight. One more negative is that Grub club doesn't have bathroom.  Delivery time depends on what order I give. All over worthy according to money.

This is a place with which many incidents of my teenhood are associated. Whenever I heard something of The Grub Club I remember those old school days. Being a student of a school of that area, I have went there uncountable times and it was like a place where the food had the perfect taste with not hurting the pocket too much bcoz at that time money was a very important thing. But the best part is I went there a few days back and found that it has that same taste I used to get in my schooldays.

The food is of quiet high quality compared to the price paid.
I always end up ordering more than what i can eat.
Loved their dragon soup,pepper chicken,honey chicken,red hot chicken and munchurian chowmein gravy!
The food is always accompanied by a cold drink or soda or mango float(love it).
Very pocket friendly.
Just pay what the menu says(no extra charges,no tipping the waiters).

One of the most common places to drop in, if you stay near Golpark or you're a frequent dweller in Southern Avenue, Dhakuria Lake. It's one of the go-to restaurants for youth primarily because of its location and then for the reasonable rates for food. These two factors have largely contributed to the business it gets. 
The food over here is quite good and stomach friendly, at the same time nothing extra ordinary. The cooking is very simple and light. They stick to the basics. The gravy of the side dishes are also quite watery. Nothing pleasing, yet not bad either. They even serve all the side dishes in pretty ordinary steel containers. So you cant expect any sort of ambience or sophistication what so ever. Even the service was not prompt, most of the time. Still, amongst all these ordinary things, the Spicy Chicken wings was the only extra ordinary option to go for. 
Overall, a very average Chinese eatery in the heart of South Kolkata, which made the most of its fortune of being situated in a prime location.

The saviour for all those hungry days when you're absolutely broke - The Grub Club. Have visited this joint numerous times, and never have been dismayed. 
On one such hungry evening, when I was too lazy to step out of my house, I decided to order food from this joint via Swiggy. 
‚Ä¢ Crispy chilli babycorn - the quantity was excellent, and so was the taste. 
‚Ä¢ Chicken Tetrazzini - this dish was perfectly made with the perfect amount of creaminess and ample shreds of chicken. Mouthwatering, indeed!
The quality and quantity was spot on!
Pocket pinch - a mere 305 bucks. Absolutely love this place.

One of the most common places to drop in, if you stay near Golpark or you're a frequent dweller in Southern Avenue, Dhakuria Lake. It's one of the go-to restaurants for youth primarily because of its location and then for the reasonable rates for food. These two factors have largely contributed to the business it gets. 
The food over here is quite good and stomach friendly, at the same time nothing extra ordinary. The cooking is very simple and light. They stick to the basics. The gravy of the side dishes are also quite watery. Nothing pleasing, yet not bad either. They even serve all the side dishes in pretty ordinary steel containers. So you cant expect any sort of ambience or sophistication what so ever. Even the service was not prompt, most of the time. Still, amongst all these ordinary things, the Spicy Chicken wings was the only extra ordinary option to go for. 
Overall, a very average Chinese eatery in the heart of South Kolkata, which made the most of its fortune of being situated in a prime location.

I am not dat much impressed by this place. Its a mere fast food hub. Its very popular among the young mass. The food price is reasonable. But they do not charge VAT.
I ordered one sechzwan chicken fried rice and manchurian chicken. The rice was very well prepared but the chicken was tasteless. Quantity is ok compared to the price.
Over all it was ok.

The saviour for all those hungry days when you're absolutely broke - The Grub Club. Have visited this joint numerous times, and never have been dismayed. 
On one such hungry evening, when I was too lazy to step out of my house, I decided to order food from this joint via Swiggy. 
‚Ä¢ Crispy chilli babycorn - the quantity was excellent, and so was the taste. 
‚Ä¢ Chicken Tetrazzini - this dish was perfectly made with the perfect amount of creaminess and ample shreds of chicken. Mouthwatering, indeed!
The quality and quantity was spot on!
Pocket pinch - a mere 305 bucks. Absolutely love this place.

There is a little chance that any person in the south of Kolkata is unaware of Grub Club. This is the place you visit late, after work in your tracks or so called ‚ÄúBarir Jama‚Äù. For people who have had their colleges in and around Gol Park, Grub Club has been an unmistakable part of their college lives and so has it for me. The double chicken roles, the Golas and the pan fried Momos were not only the cheapest of the lot and easiest on ‚ÄúPocket Money‚Äù budget, but also without a doubt some of the tastiest of things the place offered.
Food:
The food is well, average. If you are looking for mindless munching, with palatable flavours, well Grub is the place for you. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. The food is good, but no way above average. 
While most dishes hit the ball out of the park, there are some that should hardly leave the kitchen window. Some of my favourite dishes in the menu are the gravy noodles, dry chilli chicken, spicy chicken wings, chilli garlic pepper chicken and a few more. 
Quantity and cost:
The quantity is apt to suffice two. A meal for two people, including a starter, a main, a side and a couple of cokes should come at around Rs. 400 and no more. That makes it extremely easy on the pocket. 
If you like hot, spicy, tangy, crispy, Chinese goodness, without much caring for the looks of the place and air conditioning, then grub club will surely not disappoint.

There's something special about Grub Club which makes it so popular. Perhaps it's the mildly lively ambience. Perhaps it is the simple decor. I particularly love the tree : it seems the eatery has grown around the tree. What i am not a huge fan of is the food. Trying anything fancy might be a risk. My tempura chicken tasted like it was sugar chicken, while the garlic chicken smelt like the chicken maggi that we all hate so much. But, it is a good eatery if you want a casual meal of the tried and tested recipes like fried rice and chilli chicken. If it's just food, i would much rather go to some of its neighbours. But as a whole, it's a place where you'll be comfortable.

Have been eating here for a real long time. It is budget restaurant. Quantity here is good, but not the best. Hatari and Chinatoiwn nearby serves better quantity wise.

The one item I love here is the Mixed Manchurian Gravy Chowmein. Really awesome. Other items are good too.

Service is ok. One huge minus here is you have to pay first and then eat. At times this system makes you irritated.

We went to grub club near golpark with some of my friends@namrata raha. Riti das. The place z many tyms uttered by frnds, for its "good food at low price" genre. There I ordered lasagne, which didn't really pleased me well, as neither the quantity or quality was pleasing. But the rest ordered food like fish in lemon grass, shanghai chicken was appealing in both quantity n quality. I have also tried, tampura chicken, honey chicken, crispy baby corn, mix Hakka noodles of ths place. N all I got to say is ths place will definitely make u fall with its food with such adorable price. I suggest for students, it's one of the best choices

Just got in expecting the usual thali. But what a surprise! They served different cuisines. The food may Not be 100% authentic, but flavors are very good. I ordered a veg lasagna, although there was only one sheet it tasted good. And it was priced at just Rs100! The Thai curry with rice combo was value for money with good flavours. It came with a desert, honey noodles with ice cream. Very pocket friendly.

If you have lived or studied in or around south Kolkata this might have been your go to place for a meal and an adda on a students budget. This place is no frills to the extent that it has not bowed down to global warming and invested in air conditioning. For this reason alone I prefer the take out or wait till the month of December. 
Excellent continental food with their pastas being as good as some of the self declared  fine dining restaurants in the city . the Chinese and Tibetan is also tasty and of generous quantity.  Great of you are on school or college and treating a big bunch of friends to a meal.

One cool place to hang out with friends and family. The prices are on the cheaper side with generous portions served while maintaining quality at the same time. A three course full meal for two costs less than Rs. 500. The only problem with the place is that patrons need to place the order at the counter and pay the bill prior their meals. This somewhat compromises what could otherwise have been a fine dining experience.

Grub Club at Golpark is one place which looks oddly like a very normal road side restaurant. But truly speaking, it isn't. From great continental food to perfect Chinese and some amazing concept foods as well. 
I personally love the Conzy Lamb that they make. Extra spicy and saucy with lots of pepper. It's simply the perfect finger food I can think of.
They make great ice creams and juices as well.

We ordered a konjee crispy chicken, chicken drumstix, chicken fried rice, chicken meifoon, chicken in sweet garlic sauce. Each was perfectly cooked, though the sweet garlic sauce could have been better.
For dessert we had sizzling brownie, royal blackcurrant ice cream, Choco chips ice cream.

An age old restaurant, almost like an institution. Visited first when I was doing my grads, almost 8-9 years back! Although those memories are a bit faint to recollect. However, the very vibe of young kids flocking the place and the restaurant serving quick bites at cheap price is what I still find kicking on!

Coming to the food, have tasted a variety of items here. Starting from Chicken Lollipop, Wings, Noodles, Stuffed Potato, Roast Chicken, Butter Garlic Prawns etc. etc. etc! Their noodles are pretty decent. Although I tend to go for the Gravy ones. A thick broth filled with chunks of veggies, chicken and egg. Their side dishes are decent, nothing to brag about! Butter Garlic Prawns had a distinctive flavor, although the size of the Prawns(?) were could make even Chlormint cry, as to who looks bigger! The Roast dish was downright awful!

What impressed me amongst their offerings are Stuffed Potatoes and Chicken Honey Lollypop! Especially, I could keep talking about the last one! Chicken beautifully tossed with honey and sprinkled with sugar! Make sure to have it right then and there and not make a mistake to order for take-away! The Crispy, sticky and sweet flavor of honey is bound to tickle your taste buds!

All in all, a nice place to hang in with your buddies if you are looking for cheap options. If you are looking for great ambiance and exquisite food, look elsewhere!

A heaven for people low on money and students,this place offers a rich variety of cuisines. Every time I go to this place i come out completely satisfied. One think I absolutely never miss out on this is their dry chilli pork. That is simply amazing and so are any other dishes of pork. Try their mango magic(hopefully that is the name). One think I did not like is their continental but their chinese more than compensates for it. Try their deserts as well,packs quite a punch in that department as well.

We has ordered food through Swiggy. Hence the rating is solely based on the food we received. The Chicken Momos were the only decent part which is why this rating is not 1. The Hakka Noodles Egg and Chilli Garlic Noodles Veg were really bad. The Hakka Egg was badly packed as well which resulted in most of the noodles getting mashed up in broken pieces which looked and tasted very unappetizing. The Veg Momos lacked seasoning while we could not tell the difference between the Hakka and the Chilli Garlic Noodles as both items looked the same. All in all a bad experience. We had to order in again to finish dinner.

This is the kind of joint that you would be looking for after a tiring day at college or work and towards the month's end when you haven't enough jingles in your pocket but your taste buds are as snobbish as ever! 
The right quantity and the right taste at the right prices! I've been to this place numerous times on my way back from college for some quick bites. Being very conveniently located, the alluring thing about this eatery is that they do not charge any extra taxes and the prices are really cheap without compromising on the quality or quantity.
My personal favourite here is the Chicken Momo,mostly because they serve one of the best momo soups in town! I also like the Fish Finger with Chips which comes at a very reasonable price. The main course is equally good!

Grub Club has always been associated with childhood memories, as we would get chilly chicken/chicken manchurian and fried rice combos from here for almost all our annual founder day feast at school.
Went here again after a long time, with a college friend. Ordered a chicken fried rice and honey chicken. And I go back to my age-old claim 'Grub Club fried rice is THE BEST', the honey chicken was a bit too sweet, but since it IS honey chicken after all I could not blame them.

Went there again for a snack date, but was furious to see that they had not bothered to keep burgers or sandwiches at all that day.

The latest Grub Club venture was an order on Swiggy for a sleepover at a friend's place. We ordered Tempura Fish(the rich red sauce which clung to the succulent and thick fish steaks was bursting with flavours), Garlic Chicken ( generous chunks of boneless chicken in a heart-warmingly familiar chinese gravy) and of course chicken fried rice.
Needless to say, we enjoyed our dinner A LOT.

Please be careful while you have the food here...once we found a steel wire in the thukpa while on another occasion we found a roach leg in it.

Tried their vegetable pan fried momos which were perhaps tastier than chicken momos! The chicken lasagna and chicken tatrazany were also really cheesy creamy and delicious. The service is pretty quick because we reached when they had just opened that day and yet they took less than half an hour to fetch us our food.

Was there a few days back and a had a satisfying and pocket friendly meal of chicken lasagne and chicken tetrazinni. The menu was expansive and I spotted my favorite dessert Darsaan. Fully intending to go back for trying out new stuff. The place looks like a eating hall with many closely arranged chairs and has no air conditioning which I guess would be a problem in summers. But given the price tag and quality of the food this place deserves an excellent rating.

Very close to the RKM Golpark, situated in an excellent location.
The ambiance is moderate, good place to hang out with friends. The service quality is also nothing impressive, we divided the dishes on our own.
But the price and quality of food is excellent. For starters we had Chicken Honey Lollipop and Fried chicken wantons. I liked the chicken honey lollipop very much.
For main course we tried Grub club special Hakka chowmin with Tempura chicken, the quantity & quality was excellent according to price. It was followed by Chicken Mushroom rice & Lamb Manchurian. The lamb was not so impressive, the taste was kind of bland and the gravy was too much.
We had Nolen Gur er ice-cream for dessert and it was really awesome, the real flavor of Nolen Gur was there.

In a nutshell, a pocket friendly place specialized in Chinese cuisine and can be tried with a gang of friends.

The Grub Club is located at Golpark more, just beside the ATM of HDFC bank. I never visited this place during my whole life of schooling at Nava Nalanda. One night after a dance competition at Nazrul Mancha, my sister demanded to eat here. So, we went in. Since then, I am a frequent visitor of this place. I love their chicken honey lollypop. This dish is the best. I have tried their lamb, but it was not good.The taste was bland. I liked the chicken chowmein as well. Their chicken manchurian and fried wantons deserve praise. Their chilli chicken is a bit salty. They need to improve that.Their darsaan is awesome. It is delicious. The ambience is okayish. But the food makes up for it. I am surely visting again.

Their combo meals are worth the money.

The quantity of one dish is good enough for two!!

Ordered a chicken pizza. The pizza base tasted stale. So did the chicken pieces.

Date of Visit: 20/01/2016¬†

The Place :¬†¬† Its very near and visible¬†from Golpark crossing beside Ramkrishna Mission. This place runs on a prepaid basis, first you have to give order in the counter along with the money then just wait at your seat and the food will be served to you. Beautiful environment with clean seating arrangement, a colourful place. Nice place to hangout with relatives and friends and the price of food is reasonable and in budget. ¬†

¬†The Food : I tried three things during my visit to this place:¬†¬†

¬†1. Red Hot Chicken - Its a starter. ¬†It was so well cooked and so crispy that it¬†straightaway grabbed my attention towards it when served. The outer layer of the chicken was so well marinated and the chicken inside was so juicy and tasty.¬†¬†¬†

2. Mixed Fried Rice- There are very few places in Kolkata where I find fried rice is cooked so well. This was one of those places which stole my heart. The rice was so nicely cooked, the quantity of chicken and prawn was good. One single bowl of fried rice was enough for two people easily. Its a must try of you visit.¬†¬†¬†¬†

3. Virgin Mojito- In this item I would say that it disappointed me. Normally they don't serve mojito so bad, but¬†on¬†my visit it was a disaster. The Mojito was very strong in taste the amount of pudina and lemon was used was very sour. Still I hope It will be served in perfection when I visit this place again.

Overall Experience : My satisfaction level was upto 80% after visiting this place. The food was awesome, the place was nice and the quality and quantity was superb. I recommened to try this place if you are near to Golpark area.

I have been visiting this place for ever, I have lost count honestly. An awesum place to have a bit simply because they have decent food at a very pocket-friendly prices. 

Food: The food is not bad at all. Some of you might be worried about the hygene as this place is open door but I can tell you I have never got sick after a bite here in last 10 yrs. I mostly have a tempura chicken, the have a specific taste and I like it! Along with a chow n any souo for starters and momo ofcrseJust do not have the ice creams they are a waste.

Service: Service is more or less prompt but I feel they are a bit understaffed for a buzy evening and the bill first eat later policy hurts if there is a long queue.

Ambiance: The over all atmosphere is of a road side cafe...it gets noisy ona buzy day so not a place to have a conversation. Only come here for a quick bite on budget. It might feel bit claustrophobic as its essentially a modified garage space.

Verdict: If you want a quick bite on a budget after shopping at gariahat this is the place. If you are a school or college goer and need to have a bite go here , it won't hurt your pocket at all. But if you are looking for a overall great fooding experience this is probably not the 1st place I would think about.

One of the favourite food joint in my list.After innumerable visits to Grub Club for the past two years I would like to mention that the Chinese here is served best with quick and prompt service.I would personally recommend to try out the starter-spicy chicken wings and momos for some munches,the taste is really good. Decor is minimalistic.
Pocket friendly,good quality food and great place to hangout with friends specially when the college is so nearüçóüçùüçñüòõ

Well this place is tailor made for people who wants to eat at pocket friendly price.. We ordered a fresh juice, noodles, Manchurian and an ice cream and the total bill was ‚Çπ300. And the standard of food is better than a lot of high end restaurants. The 2 negative feedback would be
 1. The payment has to be made prior to service of food and
2. The place do not have an ac or a so called fine dinning feel.
For students this is "THE PLACE" to visit..

So this was my second visit to Grub Club and it would be unfair to not post a positive review for the same now !

We were a group of 3 and had ordered Crispy Chicken Wings as starters and they were finger licking good ! ;)
Next in main course we ordered Egg Gravy Noodles, Chicken Manchurian Rice and Shredded Hunan Chicken. All a thumbs up except for the cashew nuts in the chicken side dish. 

The quantity is such that you'll feel not even a drop of water will go down the food pipe anymore. However, as they say, you've always room for desserts. So we ordered a Sizzling a brownie, and 3 scoops Chocolate Caramel. The brownie wasn't too satisfying, but the other one was absolutely delicious.

Also, so much food cost us a mere 690 bucks. Totally worth it.

Juicy chicken with a honey glazed sauce. Perfect balance of sweet and savoury. Liked it very much. I do recommend this place.CHEERS!

Today was my first visit to The Grub Club. The food seemed fine. The place doesn't really provide privacy but is ok for a college going crowd. We ordered Crispy Chilli Baby Corn cause it's a safe option and we tried out Lasagne. The lasagne was really good in comparison to its low price. We wanted to order some veg momos but they were done with by 7 in the evening. But I'd like to visit the place again someday.

Most of us are very well acquainted with grub club golpark outlet.It has been there for quite some time now,and it becomes one of those nodal food joints during the puja rush in south kolkata.Recently they started catering via zomato order app,and I took the chance to check out a few of their continental items.

what's good-The non veg lasagna,although less than handful is just as you want it to be-rich on cheese and yet has plenty of sauce and baked to mould with a crispy crust.The chicken fried rice was my my idea of a fail-safe if their continental dishes went haywire.The rice wasn't much special but was enough to satiate two persons of an average appetite.they also don't levy vat and other annoying taxes.

what's bad-chicken alaking should have been served over rice or bread,but they simply provide some diced chicken in cream sauce and veggies.thus it totally resembled their chicken alfredo,which was also basically chicken dipped in cream.alfredo is usually served with broccoli and zucchini.exhibit A,check the images i post here.

Food at affordable price. The location is good. The staff are very well trained to handle huge crowd during festive season. 
We ordered pan fried momo, crispy chicken, egg chickrn noodles, chilli chicken gravy. The pan fried momo and crispy chicken was awesome. But the noodles and chilli chicken was average in taste. The noodles and the chilli chicken should be better.

Just happened to hop in by chance on 1.1.2016
I m amazed by the delicious food!  Ordered just 2 items. Very impressed!!!
Crispy chicken - i found it to be very similar to kfc popcorn chicken . amazing!
Mix gravy chow - chicken+prawn+fish+egg + surprisingly Delicious gravy!
Extremely pocket friendly!
I like that they have a serve your self system! Pay first n Get the bill. Wait at ur table for the food to arrive 
The day i went, there was rush.
I am ok with pay first bill system! But....
There is nobody to manage the crowd. The sitting arrangement is a mess. 
People will stand on ur head untill u finish yfir the chair. Some may even not mind to ask you to share the table. 
Please fix it .
At least have them wait beyond the gate. Not on someone's head, staring as they take each bite. 
Food is amazing. I hope people don't call it a dhaba .

I visited this place today with zero expectations today and was pretty surprised with what I encountered. 
We ordered Thai soup, Chicken Asparagus soup, Crispy Chilli Babycorn, Fish Finger, Chilly Garlic Pepper Chicken, Mixed Cantonese noodles and a Chinese Combo meal (which included : chicken wantons, chilly chicken and chicken rice / noodles).
The restaurant is very young and chirpy. One has to first order and pay at the counter and then wait for the food at their table.
The smelly plastic glass provided to drink water, is a huge turn off.
Coming to the food. I loved the wantons and the chicken asparagus soup the most. The chilly garlic pepper chicken was the next best thing. However did not really enjoy the other dishes as much. 
Overall the experience was good. Would like to go and try their continental someday.

Expected a rush on the Christmas evening and a way too long waiting to be served...no grievances there. But that wasn't definitely chicken drumsticks. Didn't know this place was an opposite of private dining, a place to really grab the grub and run. So I was a way lot disappointed. That 3 out of 5 was that "thikthak" Schezwan rice with Sanghai Chicken and the saviour Mango Float as the dessert. Pocket friendly eating place...can't call it a restaurant.

Located just opposite to Golpark Ramkrishna Mission. This place is famous among the young guys and couples due to their cheap good quality food. Had visited this place and ordered steamed wantons,mixed thukpa,pasta,mixed noodles,steamed momo all the ordered items were very good and fresh. Waiters are good and responsive but need to be more efficient to handle a huge number of crowds during peak hours.

A favourite from school days, this is the perfect place for students. Initially famous for its momos, now it is complete with a live pasta counter and a sundae cart. I went there yesterday and was pleasantly surprised to find that they have introduced pork dishes in their menu too. 
I would personally recommend their chilli honey chicken and the grub club special fried rice/noodles.

This place got a new look recently however, the quality of food has deteriorated. Once upon a time it was a pretty good place to dine at with good food at reasonable price. However on my recent visit to this place, I was so very disappointed. I ordered the chilli chicken, chicken fried rice. Though the rice was really nice, the chicken served as chilli chicken was not fresh. The blue lagoon was good as usual.

After innumerable visits to Grub Club in the past three years, I was wondering why my review wasn't there in Zomato. Without pausing to admit my laziness, here goes. 

Located a few steps from Golpark towards Southern Avenue (opposite the main entrance of Ramkrishna Mission Inst. Of Culture), Grub Club has become the favorite place for students like us who want to savor standard food at minimum prices. After a recent revamp in their interiors, the place looks cool and draws huge crowds throughout the day despite being a non-AC restaurant. 

The process is simple. You order at the counter, pay, and wait at your table until your food is served before you. The Chinese fare gets served super fast.

Decent interiors, huge portions of lipsmacking good food, quick service, and of course, no extra tax - it is paradise despite the absence of airconditioning! 

Coming to the food, if you want something quick and really filling, point to the Chinese fare. A plate of rice/noodles/meifoon with a side dish is almost enough to satisfy two adult appetites. From the simple fried rice to the schezuan or burnt garlic rice - from Kung Pao to Manchurian - all of them are very, very good. I'm glad that the neither the Schezuan Rice nor the Schezuan gravy items are made overly spicy. 

Precede them with a common starter like chicken drumsticks, chicken honey lollipops or baby corn and you're set for an amazing meal.

I also happened to try the Chicken Tetrazzini - loads of chicken and mushroom in spaghetti in cheesy white sauce. Quantity was good enough for one but it takes quite some time to prepare, be wary of that.
It tastes pretty good.

A huge solace during the summer heat is the availability of the icecream and mocktails counter. They have an entire menu for this purpose only. The ice creams are simple but presented nicely. Really friendly for the pocket here again.

This review excludes the entire Thai section and most of the continental dishes recently introduced in the menu. 
The Grub Club surely is one of the biggest haunts of the student community in the Golpark area, and the dine out experiences here have never failed to delight us. 
4.5 stars from me.

This is a great place for fast foods located in Golpark. Honey Chicken Lolipop is mouthwatering and delicious. I have tried that with prawn chowmin, it's fantastic. Chicken lasagna is tantalising.

Visited this joint which is situated in golpark, to  refill our hungry tummies at around 7:30pm. This place offers a variety of cuisines and deserts. Tried chicken chowmein and chicken manchurian thali, which is just 120 bucks. 
Had darshan, which is my personal favourite much to my friend's nagging. !! 
The final choco float, which is chocolate ice cream dipped in cola, was simply heavenly. Planning to visit this place soon. :)

Hi foodies!

So my friend had been egging me for a long time to visit this joint. But even though I've passed this place several times, the ambience never really impressed me. Decor is minimalistic and gives an open dhaba feel.¬†

Today we were in the vicinity and she convinced me to try their ice creams if not sit for a proper lunch. So we tried CHOCO CARAMEL with two scoops. (picture included). For 70 bucks, this was pretty amazing. My friend wanted me to have a brainfreeze; thankfully I didn't. But this was really nice. Kinda reminded me of Hobby Centre.

Will drop in next time to have the other items as quick bites.

-Bon App√©tit.

Hasle free, no testimony sort of restaurant. Perfect place for giving school/college  treats.Good food in affordable ranges without any VAT & service taxes. Enough in quality & quantity. The chilli prawn we had was quite good. It should have been a little more tender & succulent though.Has a feel like college canteens. Homely ambience, not too lavish or extravagant.

Value for Money and  Quick Service are the best part of this place serving awesome food. 

Sometimes the place gets really crowded and uncomfortable.

There are no ACs. And don't expect any fine dining experience. The waiters will serve the food on to the plates only if you ask them to. 

Generally you have to first grab a table, then find the menus (there are more than one menu cards, separate ones for Chinese, other continental, beverages, desserts, etc). Once you have decided what you want walk up to the counter to place your order and pay. Then just sit back with the receipt on your table and wait for the server to see what you have ordered and bring your order to your table.

Over the years they have expanded the menu beyond Chinese. So you can have sizzlers and pasta. The sizzler here didn't come with any noodles/rice/pasta/bread. But the piece of chicken was pretty big. Had a fried egg and french fries and other veggies.

Be careful about home delivery - sometimes they can be very very late and if you try to enquire about the delay in delivery over the phone, they can also be really really rude. This is the only reason for not giving a higher score.

Grub Club has always been a favorite spot for students and friends looking to have a bit while passing the time. Decor is minimalist at best with sturdy chairs and tables and lights well placed. However, when it comes to food, the place scores perfectly. I have been there many times and tried a variety of menu. The Fried Momos served here are heavenly and size wise are quite good. The Crispy Chilli Babycorn and Chilli Chicken was amazing as well. The best thing about the place is the pocket friendly price and quality food served in lieu of it.

Pocket friendly, good taste and adequate portions. This combination makes it a great place especially for students. Though the place is small and crammed, it serves its purpose well, i.e. tasty food. I have some beautiful memories in this place as a student. Would love to go back again n again.

food quality is not so good...place is not so spacious and everytime if you want to order any food you need to go to the cash counter;pay and then your order will be processed....food will not be served by the waiters....they will just bring the food from kitchen to your table...dats it.....self serve!! 
Talking about the restroom...there is no such facility apart from a single hand wash basin... :(..... 
Last but not the least it is pocket fre
iendly... good hang out place for the students....

It is one of the cheapest places in Kolkata  with respect to the quality and quantity of food served here. Even 2 people could not finish one plate of noodles. We ordered Grub club special Gravy Noodle , Dry chili chicken. The food was wholesome,  tasty and cheap. What else anyone can want !

Low cost and high quantity. That's the USP of this food shack. I am a huge Chinese cuisine fan and truly speaking this place serves very not-so-authentic Indianized version of Chinese (which I am a bigger fan of :p). Over all the place is good for a quick get together. Service is not at all prompt and neither are the staff members. Only high point is the easy on pocket food.

The Grub club is located exactly opposite to the the Ram Krishna Mission, Golpark.. The ambience of this restaurant is not worth mentioning.. But its an absolute students delight for its pocket friendly prices.. Its a non-ac restaurant where the seating arrangement is like a school corridor..  Quality and quantity of food is very good considering its moderate price..  They have a large variety of continental foods.. Customer service is not very good to be true which should not be an issue in such an economical restaurant..

Heard about this place a lot of times from my friends.Today on my way back from college I decided to try it...The ambience is good enough,but I think they can fit in some ACs since the prices are not that low.Others than that,I found no other fault.Quantity was good.There were three of us.We tried the chicken in oyster sauce and the Mandarin Chowmein(gravy) for main course,while we had red hot chicken for starter.We had one dish of each item for main course.The chicken was soft and delicious.And the noodles was filling,full of gravy with shrimps,chicken and lots of vegetables.I write about the starter at last,because it was the best.We had one dish at first and we loved it.It was just perfect,full of juicy and spicy chicken.At the end of our meal,we again ordered a second dish of red hot chicken because it was just too yummy to have just one dish! Our total bill amount was 580 bucks, which is justified considering the dishes. Overall my experience was amazing!!!

Visited on recommendation and was thoroughly disappointed. Had chicken drumstick as starter which was RAW. Ordered chicken noodles and chicken chilly alongwith honey lollipop for main course.Everything was below standard and chicken was either stale or it was not cooked properly.

well, i dont remember every detail, its been a week. heard a lot as it is widely popular. what i witnessed like slow service, slow billing nobody wants to face in a restaurant.¬†It attracts people because of its food quality. Long seating area like a high school corridor so that customers do not have to wait outside. every dish is above average. they have 'todays special' section filled with more delicious new dishes not mentioned in menu card. May be they are trying to stick to their chinese dishes we were told they dont serve any north indian dish so far.¬†cherry on the cake is the ice cream counter.¬†p.s- are the foodies satisfied with wall fans?

This is one of those places that I frequent so much that writing a review seems like telling people how the food was at my house. But since it has to be done sooner or later, let's do it now. 
The food here is good, and the price is reasonable. It has an ambience of a hangout place and people living in the Dhakuria, Golpark, Gariahat area should frequent the place. I have tried almost all the dishes here and I can't ask anybody to avoid any particular dish here. Every dish is above average and consistent in taste.

Grub club being my fav .. good food at such reasonable price is unbelievable . An open restro without ac is a hotspot for the young generation. Chinese , contienental and ice-cream - all prepared to best. The fav being the momos and lasagne. Today i went there on maha chaturthi after pandal hopping for a late lunch at 3. We were three persons and our orders were : crispy babycorn, chicken chowmein, chicken fried rice and hongkong chicken. All were good . Hong kong chicken is a tad spicy but went well with simple fried rice. I wanted to have burnt ginger rice and thai dishes but it was unavailable today.. anyway.. we were full and loved everything.

This place is a life saver. Feeling hungry after retail therapy? Grub Club is it.  Sick of having food from the places in college and the ones around college? Grub Club it is. Fairly priced and amazing food with a huuuuuuuuuuuuuge variety of food, this place is a goldmine. If you haven't tried the food as yet then you are just NASTY -_-.  To not eat the food here is a sin. From continental to Chinese to thaai to the good ole ice cream sundaes, this place has it all. They don't take too long with service either and the place is very clean. I've loved my experiences here and will continue going here whenever I get the chance.

If you're extremely ravenous and surmise that you may possibly eat a horse and luckily happen to drive or pass through Golpark, leg it to the direction of The Grub Club. This one is too conspicuous to be missed. Likewise the locales will always show you the ways to reach there.
The dishes available there are pretty much akin to what you come across today at several restaurants in Kolkata. But the defining aspect of this place is the understated cosiness and vivid simplicity.
I had noodles and chicken items there and certain other complementary ones to enhance the experience and quiten the hunger. The bill will be fine.
This place is not meant for fine dining but for quick snacking and other on-the-way quick meals of high sustenance. And be assured that you will be offered quite an ocean of choices to go cherry picking for yourself and your kith and kin.

A place I have been visiting since my childhood. Known for the enormous quantity that they serve, Chinese food is pretty good and reasonable. Delivery service is brilliant. But recently they have begun the continental section which was fine at the beginning but with time, the quality is degrading. It would be best if they would just stick to chinese, which is what they specialize in.

But the food here is pretty damn good. The chicken Lasagna and the Tetrazini were awesome. I could literally feel the cheese and chicken in every mouthful.
Their Chinese food isn't too bad either. 

So if the decor is improved even a little bit this could become one of the best food joints in South Kolkata.

We ordered only 3 things
1. Chicken alfredo - tasted awsome quantity less
2. Gravy chowmin - also tasted gud but quantity too less.....toomuch gravy and the quantity of noodles was like omg...we two ppl couldn't share it......
3. Hakka chowmin - the quantity was thankfully gud but it was plain salty.....
I had no previous experience to compare with but my friend told me food quality use to way better previously

I like to finish the meal off with a dessert which I love the most over here. There's a bit of over crowding and the lack of AC turns out to be a little uncomfortable during summer. But overall a nice place to gorge on good food and quite pocket friendly indeed!

Chicken Steam Momo-It tasted good especially because it was hot and spicy and just the way it should be. The pricing is decent at Rs.70/- per plate.

Hot Garlic Prawn-It was hot and garlicky and had the right balance. However, the quantity should be increased.

Chilli Prwan-It was decent and nothing worth mentioning as such.

There is a section in the menu with a heading named as ‚ÄúSpecial‚Äù and has some interesting options. I am yet to try any of them but will in the future.

The ‚ÄúSoup‚Äù section is also interesting and so are the ‚ÄúStarters‚Äù.

They also have a ‚ÄúContinental‚Äù section in the menu and I have had the Mexican Stuffed Potatoes both Veg/Chicken and they are good.They have a lot of variety in this section but starngely whenever I have been there they seem to be pretty reluctant to serve them. For e.g. the last time we ordered they gave us a wait time of 30 minutes for the Mexican Stuffed Potatoes. 

This place draws a lot of college goers though the prices are not very pocket friendly for them.

This place serves lip-smacking Chinese,continental and Italian dishes at very reasonable prices. It's very hassle free as you need to place your order and pay at the counter and they take very little time in serving the food. I have tried the chicken tetrazini and the spaghetti bologniese among the continental dishes and they are very tasty and not much pricey also! The only drawback is that, this place is non ac and it's uncomfortable to eat at times! No complaints about the food though, it's delicious üòã

But it offers comfort to you and your and pocket. A wide range menu. Fresh and chirpy ambiance.¬†The perfect restaurant to supplement your college canteen.

Food satisfying both in terms of quality and quantity and is pocket friendly too. The absence of air conditioning makes visiting this place difficult in the summers. I loved the Hakka noodles and Chicken preparations which satiated me and my friend completely.

Had heard about this place from most of my friends and that is why I always wanted to see what was so special about this shabby old eating joint! So finally visited this place along with a friend of mine and frankly speaking did not like it that much! We ordered a crispy chilli babycorn,grub club special gravy noodles,chicken noodles hakka and a chicken side dish. Even though quantity was very good, quality was not! Liked the noodles,chicken was not up to the mark and baby corn was average. Other eating joints in the same area provide better food at the same price but still one can visit this place to cool the grumble in their tummy! ;)

This is a perfect pocket friendly joint where u can't expect too much in terms of decor and interiors but the food is decent and palatable.

Our staple from this joint are Chicken Momo & Chicken Lollypop. We've mainly tried the Chinese and that's pretty decent. 

They close down a bit earlier than other diners around 10pm, I believe; so, one needs to be particular abt the time.

Overall decent experience.

Oh yeah..!! This is a place to look for in a tight budget... Eat as much u want, and still you will be surprised seeing the bill... We were 8 of us who went here today... And the bill was just over ‚Çπ1200, and that too by adding extra items, which were not planned to be ordered... The main thing is that, they dont charge any tax or VAT...
Coming to the decor, its nice... There is no AC, but still it was pretty comfortable due to quite a few no. of fans and open ventilation on both sides... The tables were a little small, but still was adjustable...
The food is extraordinary at this price point... We ordered Chicken Pepper, Dry Chilly Chicken as starters; then proceeding to the main course, which includer Plain, Chicken Schezwan, and Chicken Manchurian Fried Rice, and Lemon Chicken, Shanghai Chicken as side dish... And then there was the cold drinks as well... The starters were mouth watering and so was the main course... Each and every item was just amazing...

Would I visit here again?
Yes, ofcourse... As often as I can... Just fell in love with this place...

Yesterday evening I went to grub club with my 2 friends.we are in mood to eat snacks type preparation.we hv ordered chicken honey lollipop and fried fish with mayonnaise. After 5-7 minutes,chicken honey lollipop served.it has heavenly taste.most probably their best dish.after that fried fish with mayonnaise came.its a dish of fish fry with potato fries and mayonnaise. Fish fry was good.but the potato fry is not all good neither the mayonnaise. It's a OK OK.waiters r good,helpful.so I suggest that if u r in a hangout mood with ur frnds u can obviously go there..because the dishes were cheap and totally paisawasool.must try chicken honey lollipop.

This no-frills restaurant located near the Golpark crossing proves that you shouldn't judge a place by it's look only. They serve excellent food & the pricing is very reasonable considering some of the other places around. The service is also decent although the staff can get a bit grumpy under pressure. If you feel uncomfortable inside you can always order takeaway. Their Grilled Fish with Garlic Bread is my favourite.

The first  thing about that draws attention about this place is the huge number of items available here. We ordered Chinese combo. The wantons and noodles was good. About the side dish,we ordered chilli fish. But the thing that was served it didn't check like fish and didn't fully tasted like chicken either. But it didn't tasted bad. So we ate it without asking anything. The dessert was the best thing served. Everything just for 199 bucks. This is totally a value for money place. No fancy decorations,no a.c..just good food.

It was a very hot summer day and we were very hungry but walked past this seeing it isn't air conditioned. Yesterday we decided to to back and boy what an experience it was. It was the cheapest and most satisfying meal I have had in a long time. We ordered chicken burgers which had perfectly toasted bread with considerable crunch besides a very tasty patty. The Lasagne here is one of the best I have had ever and it'e golden baked top is to die for. The chicken tettrazini was perfectly cooked and packed with flavor and the sauce it was cooked in was delicious. All the dishes were served hot. Finally, chocolate cold coffee was very refreshing. 
I am definitely going back there sooner rather than later. I would recommend this place to everyone.

The USP of this place has to be the surprisingly-low prices.And the food is pretty nice too.Quantity is good enough for two people.

Chicken tetrazzini is highly recommended. So is the lasagne,though the crust was a little overburnt.
Spicy honey chicken,a favourite,is crispy and is the right amount of spicy and sweet.
The chilli lamb though was not upto the mark,was overburnt and very less in quantity.
The other items I have had(momos,noodles and a chicken side dish) were quite good.

It's high time they do something about the annoyingly dark and claustrophobic sitting area.

The place is near Golpark in Southern Avenue and it's a non ac place. A place quite reasonable to grab some great food. The chicken steamed momos are good and is served with some tasty clear soup. The chicken fried rice is really nice and is served in good quantity. Pairing the fried rice with chilly chicken is a good option as the mildly spicy chicken surely compliments the taste of the fried rice. The chicken hakka chow is also quite good. 
Other than the Chinese the fish fry with finger chips is a lovely starter. The fish fry is very lite and good to taste. 
The service is also good and does not make you wait long for the food. 
Overall it is nice place to sit and chat with your friends and eat some nice food while seeing the cars passing by.

The Grub Club, situated in the alley right beside RKM in Golpark that leads to Southern Avenue, is the ideal place to visit when the weather's not too hot and your pocket's not in your favour. Located beside the HDFC bank, it looks like a garage converted into an eatery and has no AC.
Though so far I've only tried their entrees, their menu card is quite extensive and you're bound to be spoilt for choice. My absolute favourite is the Spicy Chicken Wings. Everytime I go there, I end up ordering it. 6 pieces of soft, delicious chicken legs saut√©ed in mouth-watering, spicy-as-hell thick sauce! Yum! The Honey Lollipops are also quite good, along with the Pepper Chicken. In fact, the only disappointment for me was the Chicken Pan Fried Momo which was not juicy at all. They were not even fried, merely steamed. I once ordered their Chocolate Cold Coffee, which though was a little thinner than what I would like, was as good as it can get for 50 bucks.
Service has always been more or less prompt and fast. I love their no-fuss paying system. You go to the counter, you order the food and pay up front, they'll give you slip which you're supposed to hold onto till your order is served, the waiters will take a look at your slip and bring you the order.
This is fast becoming my go-to place after a quiet reading session in the RKM library. Can't wait to try out their main courses and continental.

nice joint for chinese food and momos. i have taken home delivery quite a few times but the delivery time is high. since they are located at golpark, they have lot of customers and hence generally takes time to prepare and deliver food to your place. items like chilly garlic pepper chicken, chicken pan fried momos are must try if you want a quick bite. for main course items, you can opt for mixed manchurian fried rice with kung pao/shanghai chicken, both are spicey and have 8 boneless pieces with hot gravy. over the years, the food quality has gone down and serving time has gone up but still, their quantity per serving is good. the items are ok, nothing special to mention. price is not much, so its value for money.

Beware the spicy Chinese chicken delicacies over here. When they say it's spicy, believe me they aren't fooling around. It's really spicy. Go for them only if you have a knack for really hot spicy stuffs.

It used to be a popular place to eat n chill during my school days..the main reason for this was its price.. last time I went here way backed to 2012, November.  My friend gave her bday treat here.we were 4 n we ordered 4 plates of fried rice n two chilli chicken.. we were so hungry that we we finished them at ease..later on we realised we were not in a position to walk.. so I can say 4 fried rice for 4 people is more than enough. .their quality n quantity both were ok.. n the price was just perfect for students..

They will give you a copy if the invoice and then serve the food at the table. I always try the fried momo and the crispy chilly baby corn. Chinese and italian food is very good. Pocket friendly and tasty food,thats a deadly combination. Mainly the collage students come here. Food is great location is great what else do you need. Please tryout this place you wont be disapointed. And they also make icecreams which is also very nice.

I had visited this place before but wanted to checkout their home delivery service. 100 out of 100. Right on time. Good packaging. Great food. Especially mustard fish was awesome. And as always they are within budget. If you are hungry no problem just step in . Or order via phone.

This is a place where you go during the first year of college and eventually get various memories attached with it.. Same goes for me! Obviously.. Out of everything I used to like their Cantonese rice, chilli lamb and steamed momo.. Though the quality is no more that good. Still i won't mind visiting there again :) old is gold!

Have had here quite a lot time. As it is non AC and decor too is not eye catchy but don't get misguided by that. This is one of the best resturant of south Kolkata. Pocket friendly and offers a large range of choices in menu. Have tried both Chinese and continental here. Chinese is okayish, nothing special but continental is superb. In such a low price such tasty continental is unbelievable. Although I didnt like pizza but pasta, burger, lassagne, garlic bread and all are heaven. Must try grilled fish with garlic bread thats a delicacy. And not to forget their wide range of beverages. They shd hv made it AC thats only con I found. All in all a must go food joint for Golpark area.

You will not find a better option to give your treat if you are tight on budget. The restaurant's tagline should be "Paisa vasool". The only lack is that it doesn't have an AC.
Salt and Peper fish is a good way to start but nothing beats the Spicy Chilli Honey Chicken. Once you have had it, you're gonna order it every time you come. On the main course I personally prefer the noodles here as I find it tastier than the Fried Rice. Also when I'm alone and looking for a quick meal, I go for the combo of Noodles with Chilli chicken. The quantity of noodles I feel is more than that of the Rice in the same combo category. And another highpoint is the dessert counter which has separate billing. Anything here tastes nice because it's well within budget and all the prices are inclusive of taxes.

There's something that these guys in particular( and other Chinese restaurants in Kolkata in general) need to understand - Chinese is not boiled noodles covered in oil and excessive chilly. You need to cook the noodles, fry it a bit and then you get chowmein. Just adding hell lot of chilly won't do. For the first time I came out of a Chinese restaurant panting and sweating. Please, improve.

A place that offers really good food at reasonable prices - this is a great place to hang out with friends or to grab a quick bite at. Also, if there's a sudden gathering at home, this is our quick fix! By now, I'm almost a regular at Grub Club - at least in terms of take outs! :p 
Special mention for their Crispy Chilly Baby corn - my All time Favourite!! :) ..and it's much better than a lot of other places! This is something I Don't like to share! :p
For me, the only serious issue would probably be the air conditioning - the lack if which makes lunch here in summers a pretty daunting task. 
However, as an afterthought, maybe they can diversify their menu a little more - even beyond the sizzlers and the few other continental items. 
All in all, if you want value for money, then this is a pretty good place to be at!

For a college student, grub club will always be a place close to the heart, especially in winters. Since the place is non AC, the summer afternoons might not be the best time to visit. However, don't let the dingy appearance put you off. The restaurant is more than hygienic. The pay-before-eat-after concept is convenient leaving no room for ambiguity with regard to tips.
Grub Club is heartwarmingly reasonable, almost bordering on cheap. Pepper prawns for 250 is a total steal. Other recommendations are dry chilli chicken, chilli pork, fried chicken (specify that you want them without bones) , the various sundaes and the fruit juices. They have continental too that I am yet to try. The menu contains pastas, pizzas, burgers, Chinese. The momos are the only things that don't seem worth it. Don't forget to try the sundaes: blind love, choco caramel.

Location is easy to find, its in southern avenue near Golpark. Good place for college students as it offers good food and cheap price. You first pay at the counter and then get your food. Its a small open place, no air conditioning but its good enough to hang out with your friends, but certainly not for private romantic dining!

This place was always there on our bucket list but alwaulys ended up going there for a early sunday break fast and its closed. So one fine evening ..me and my went there to finally check it out.
Ambience is quite good. Dont expect ac or private dining experience. Its more of a cafe ...where you pay your bills before and then get ur food .....

Food : we ordered for a plate of chicken momos ,chicken chowmein and a plate of chilli paneer. The momo was good and would definitely recommend it.The chowmein and pNner was average as i found an over the limit usuage of soya sauce,cornflour.

caution : do not order fruit juice as you will only get avery diluted glass of juice with very little fruit pulp in it ..and its very expensive

Overall a good place to hang out if you want to binge on some good food and really cheap price notwithstanding to the fact that you do not enter the restaurant with an good ambience

Second visit to this popular outlet located just near golpark. The outlet has nothing to talk about its decorum as its a non ac restaurant properly managed, i would say.
I went there for lunch and ordered pan fried chicken momo, veg garlic rice, chicken gravy noodles and chicken manchurian.
The momos tasted too ordinary with no flavours of being pan fried. The gravy also tasted bad. overall it was the worst pan fried momo i had. The rice tasted good and the noodles were average.Chicken manchurian also tasted nothing to talk about.
Being a pocket friendly restaurant i would rate it high but regarding the taste of food, they need to work hard on their spices and sauce.

I've been going to Grub Club since time immemorial. This place has been around for quite a while and it qualifies as a fast food joint with its open seating and cheap prices. I've tried almost everything on the menu here, though I love going back for the Thai platter. Thai is generally a difficult cuisine to manage, but they do it quite well. I also love the Chinese starters and the Biryani here.
You could drop into this place for a casual lunchoen with friends!

The restaurant is located at golpark. So an obvious visit for college couples and nearby i students. This is one of the few pocket friendly restaurant which offers lamb. So I and a fried of mine ordered veg rice, chicken gravy chow and oyster lamb. Chow and rice were good,just like another restaurant, not so much to awe. But the lamb preparation wasn't up to the mark,though it was not left aside as we were hungry like a dragon,but didn't love that much. One shouldn't go for the ambience,it's just a roadside food joint offers dining,okay place to go with family.

Come, place order, pay, eat and leave. Hassel free. The food quality is not great, but for the price they give it at its a great deal. 
Personal favorites are the Chilli Garlic Hakka Chow and Alfredo Pasta. 
One of the best pocket friendly joints to eat at. Don't forget, it's also a good choice for the party people. They do home delivery, and it's easy to have your starters, main course delivered right to your door step!

This restaurant deserves to be in the legendary restaurants category in my opinion.
I have been eating at grub since 2006. There are two constants that I see, good quality food and steady rises in price.
When I started eating at grub, a chicken pasta used to be ‚Çπ70 a plate and today that's ‚Çπ140. But the taste, quantity and quality are constant which is what makes it such a great place to eat. Prices are still decent in my opinion.
Location is solid, menu has variety, only drawback is the lack of an air conditioned seating area. Cash and card both are accepted.
A great fringe free place to eat nice Chinese, Indian or a continental meal.

One of the most visited places when I was in school and all the bday treats used to happen here. I used to savour their food whether it is the fish fingers or soups or crispy chicken or the noodles or rice or the gravy dishes.. everything used to be almost perfect. But nowadays the food has degraded.. I dont like them much. Service is fast and ambience is like a college canteen but not an issue there as the main attraction for a food joint is always the Food.

I was a old customer of Grub Club food joint situated in the heart of south kolkata.
Since my school days this was the only place i always preffered and till now atleast 10 to 16 times a month i enjoyed food here, Be it lunch, party order and dinner.
But today as i was alone at home i parcelled my dinner a mixed Thupka and chicken hot wings.
Aftet finishing my hot wings i was eating this thupka suddenly i saw a baby cockroach floating on the thupka soup.
After vomiting several times i checked the entire soup and found another one.
Horrible experience and i swear never to visit again.
For you guys i am attaching the photographs as proof.
Now i have to sleep empty stomach :(

Well...If you are looking for a joint having posh ambience, accompanied with sumptuous platter then this is just not the place for you. However, if your only matter of concern is palatable chienese dishes and you'r just planning for a casual evening hang out wid your buddies then you should definately try this eatery...Trust me... You gonna thank me at the end.
I have been regular here for last 8 years ... since my college days... Over the years, It has witnessed my transformation from gourmand to gourmet. Any day, I prefer to drop by here and treat myself with the savoury Chilli honey chicken it serves...It has no air-conditioner installed inside but the place is well ventilated. Summer afternoons are not preferable to pay a visit but breeze from nearby Dhakuria lake makes the summer evenings pleasant enough to have dinner or evening snacks here. Pocket pinch is on the lower side. Place is always buzzing with energetic College goers which , in a way makes me nostalgic and takes me back to my college days when we, a group of 4-5 friends used to fight over a single dish ?... your "must try list" should contain:
‚äô Chilli Honey chicken
‚äô Lat me kai
‚äô Spicy chiken wings
‚äô Tempura Chicken
‚äô Fish finger with Mayo
‚äô Pan fried chilli chicken
‚äô Konjee Crispy Lamb
Chicken Fried rice and Haka noodles are quite toothsome...!!!
You may give a try if you are at this part of the city.

Set inside a small garage in a superb location in Golpark, grub club since my school days grub place was the place to "hang out". 
Used to really like their steamed chicken momos, fried momos & of course the much talked about pan fried momo which is high on taste and spices! 
I have never seen this place empty. From time to time I kept visiting grub club and have tried their Chinese dishes like chicken Hakka noodles & Garlic chicken as well. 
Reasonably priced this was the place I could afford with my pocket money. All being very near to where I stay my sister and I used to order for home delivery from there tonnes of times and it usually never disappointed. But as the days passed and the place got busier and noisier with most of the college kids hanging out, I think it lost its touch. The chicken momo had more onion filling than chicken and the staff didn't take too kindly to criticism, also they hiked their prices but didn't do much about their place, it remained the same, inside he garage with table fans. I honestly don't know what they have done right now, but a couple of years back they didn't even have an air conditioner which is not a luxury but a necessity in this heat. 
As new places cropped up with more appealing food and decor somewhere down the line I have completely forgotten about grub club over the years! Until recently my mom and I were passing by and wanted to grab a quick bite, well my mom did atleast and hence we ordered fried prawn balls and fried chicken momo ( take away ) and I thought to myself what a wonderful momo! Haha it was hot and fresh and the filling actually had chicken compared to the chopped onions ...it could really do with some new flavours and seasoning but I guess it's has gained the popularity like coffee house in South Calcutta. 
Would love to visit this place soon and see how they are doing these days!

This place holds many childhood memories for me. It has expanded into mughlai food, but I have always known it as a chinese food joint. Their vegetable munchurian, chili chicken, chicken with chinese greens, chicken momo, and chicken fried rice are some of the items I am crazy about. During lunch hours they have lunch packs with four pieces of chicken and fried rice/noodles at a very reasonable rate. They even have home delivery. It's really a very nice place. They have also improved their seating arrangement. :)

There is nothing much to say about the ambience and it being non-ac a major drawback..The food is awesome and at a very cheap price..I consider the alfredo chicken, american chopsey and the dry chilli pork its best dishes and I can go again and again to this place just to have them..u can also try the spicy hot chicken wings and lasagne. Service is quite prompt and the food comforting after a hectic shopping spree at gariahat ;-)

Ambience:- very basic and  dimmed light. No ac.. pay first n then order system.

Food:- chicken sizzlers
The dish was sizzling hot with smoke all around.. appearance was good..
Chicken was stiff but the gravy along it was tasty..

Pocket pinch :- 300-350 for two

Conclusion:-  the preparation was good but the quality of chicken ruined the show.

Its almost opposite to rkm golpark. I first visited this place on 31st december to grab lunch with my friends. It was amazingly pocket friendly and the food was good. Later i suggested it to few friends of mine and they visited it but their feedback was far from satisfactory. They said that to me and i thought of paying a visit again. And yes they were right. The standard had undergone detorioration from the 1st time. We had noodles and shreded lamb. And i was complled to leave the food on plate. (Though i am quite against food wastage).

The restaurant is very pocket friendly. I've been here more than four times over the last three years and the quality of food is gradually going down the hill. Food used to taste much better the first time I was here. The ambience is okay, but could be better. Food is served more or less quickly.

It's been more than 10 years since I had been aquainted to lovely food at Grub Club. Starting from high school days where we'd pull in money to have pasta and spring rolls to present day casual meetings, lunch with colleagues, to curb a sudden hunger, this place has seen me through! The quality of food has steadily been maintained however through my varied experience I have leart never to order certain food such as Spaghetti Bolognese, momos or any other food made with lamb!
Chinese is the safest bet! Pasta and lasagna ain't bad but leave your taste buds at home if you are an authentic conti lover. And for some reason you gotta beg them for tissue papers ( God knows what's the deal with them! ;-))
The place has come a long way however I still believe there is much scope for improvement in terms of food...

Though TGC is 5 minutes away from my college,but i was not aware of this restro at all :-( ‚Ä¶ then zomato happend to me‚Ä¶and i found it with great reviews‚Ä¶but i couldn't able to make a visit in past 3 years‚Ä¶but never the less finally i made a visit with my friends on the last day of our college‚Ä¶
its a small non ac restaurant with basic decor‚Ä¶no fancy sitting arrangement‚Ä¶it is based on the pay,sit,eat concept‚Ä¶you have to pay the bill first‚Ä¶
our order consits of CHICKEN HOT AND SOUR SOUP-quantity was less as compared the other restaurants of the same price, the chicken was hard‚Ä¶it was not fresh at all‚Ä¶
RED HOT CHICKEN-it was red in colour and not at all hot rather completely cold‚Ä¶as if it was taken out of the fridge n served to us‚Ä¶completely tasteless‚Ä¶
FRIED RICE-it was served in good quantity,though it was just average‚Ä¶
HOT GARLIC CHICKEN-Again we were dissapointed with this too‚Ä¶the gravy was mild‚Ä¶chicken was chewy‚Ä¶

My expirience wasn't good‚Ä¶they served us stale food‚Ä¶which is not all acceptable for me‚Ä¶:-(‚Ä¶may be i would give it a second try ‚Ä¶n hopefully my perceptions will be changed‚Ä¶

Decor : its a cheap restaurant so you should not expect much from the decor. Its got plenty of tables so you can always count on this place for a seat. Except for festivals of course. Gets 2.0 anyway

Service: You have to order on the counter at the entrance. The waiters are just fine. Nothing very friendly , didn't experience any rudeness either. Gets a 2.5

Food: 
Ordered the following dishes : 
Chicken sandwich : They Dont do grilled one perhaps , just a hand made sandwich, very soft, good fillings. Gets a 3.5 

Crispy chilli potato : They were very good. Crispy, spicy potato cooked with a tasty sauce. Gets 4.0

Soda Sikanji : Well, the same kind that you get probably in the Park street footpath but great obviously. Very refreshing. Gets 4.0

Value for money : Obviously 4.0
The crispy chilli potato quantity was great. Could feed two and a half men ;) And I was there all alone trying to catch up on my lunch. Now I can't eat anything for the next 8 hours. I'm full :O
The sandwich was rather a half sandwich. You normally always get two sandwiches in one plate, but it costs 40rs so its good enough. 
My total bill was 150 and I am bloating now :))

Definitely will visit again. My purse seems happy with it. XD

I stay in golpark. I used to visit this place to have momos during my school n college days. Bt nowadays the quality of food has terribly gone down. Day before yesterday me n my husband had dinner there and we both were very disappointed with the quality of food they provided. We have ordered chicken fried rice, egg fried rice(bt unfortunately there were no eggs) n Mandarin chicken. Trust me the food was pathetic. The rice had no salt n was half cooked n the chicken was very sweet n had lots of cabbage slices in it. I will not prefer to visit this place any more. It may be pocket friendly bt still the food quality is not worth paying that much also. Horrible!

Pure nostalgia. Used to frequent this place back in my school days. I remember whenever an eating out was on the cards, this was the place that received unanimous votes. The ambiance is not much to be spoken of, but the food was simply mindblowingly tasty. The ginger chicken breads they used to make were my favourite, as well as the ice creams. Need to revisit the place. Both to tickle the taste buds, as well as to prod the bpockets of memories. Getting nostalgic again.

Good food at a pocket friend price. Yes, Grub club is the place you would want to visit. The staff is friendly and the people who visit here want to have good food at prices which would not burn a whole in there pockets. The Tetrazzini and Lasagna was great. The set menu was worth the money. All over a must visit.
Only if they would have a/c.
Other wise a great place!

When you see this place from outside, you won't be very excited about dining here. But this is one of those places- shabby appearance and great insides! The food is the main attraction here. The place is, to be polite, just about decent. add to that, the service, which is nothing great. But the food is awesome! I've been there quite a few times. It is cheap, and gives good food.¬†

I started coming to Grub Club since the time I had Chicken Drumsticks here. They are really good, trust me! But apparently the quality has gone down over the years. i also tried the Pepper Prawn which is really going to make you happy in this shabby place.¬†

Then, I tried mixed chowmein and Schezwan Chicken and a few others along the same lines. All of these were good!¬†

I also tried the crispy chilly baby corn and honestly, this is the last thing on the menu that you would want to try. they tasted more like raw carrots.¬†

Overall, I am pretty fond ¬†of the place. Its not perfect. But this is a great place to hang out with friends. and pocket-friendly too! :)

It was a sudden hang out with my college friend. She was at golpark to buy a smart phone and she called me up to help her select a good one. And finally we ended up having lunch together at this joint. I have come here innumerable times. A non air conditioned restaurant with a very basic seating arrangements but what makes it favourite among all is its quality of food n pocket friendly price. Fish fry, chicken drumsticks, chicken lollipops, grub club special fried rice, schezwan chicken, kumpao chicken and mandarin chicken have been my all time favourites. This time I tried veg dishes since my friend is very strict to her meat being halaal. We ordered veg pan fried momo, veg lasagna, soda shikanji and cold coffee with chocolate sauce. All of them impressed me a lot. Special mention is veg lasagna. I would have never believed it could taste this awesome. Corn, capsicum,mayonnaise, cheese create a yummy magic. Momo is as usual too good though a bit hot and spicy. Drinks were good too though the cold coffee was less thicker than usual ones. A must visit for all.

I was first introduced to this place by a friend of mine who is a regular customer of Grub Club and always had nice food experiences. So hearing his experience, decided to try out this little place in Golpark on the Southern Avenue stretch.

First of all, this restaurant is quite famous in the area and I was able to reach there without asking for any directions. Reaching there, I found that it is actually a relatively small place, but they have done a good job of space management, utilizing every corner. They also have a roll counter which functions mainly at the evening.

For the food, I ordered Chicken Hakka Chowmein, Crispy Chilli Potato and Chicken Sweet n Sour. The order was a takeaway order. The Chicken Hakka Chowmein was a little oily but still good to have with big pieces of chicken in it. Crispy Chilli Potato was perfect. Potatoes were chopped like French Fries and were very crispy and mild spicy as well. Sweet n Sour Chicken goes well and comes with pineapple, cherry tomatoes and baby corn pieces in it. Also took a cold drink while waiting for the takeaway order :P

Pricing is quite cheap and it is rightly featured in Zomato's pocket friendly collection. Quantity of the food is stomach filling and as far as I can say, every plate of a dish is sufficient for two-three (except for some starters maybe). Service is blazing fast, my order of three dishes were prepared in flat 10 minutes. It is the fastest I have seen. Don't know about the delivery though as they do not deliver in my area. Packing could have been better as they pack even gravy items in a those aluminum type boxes and gravies tend to leak out.

Ambiance of the place is not the best and since space is an issue, the tables are very cramped and close to each other. Good thing though is that there are enough tables to accommodate several guests. They also have chairs outside for those waiting for takeaway orders.

So overall a nice place to have some really good Chinese and it's completely worth a try if you live nearby. Takeaway is recommended but if you are with your friends then it is a good place of gossip as well.

Update 18/3/2015: Today tried out their Crispy Chilli Babycorn and Chicken with Veg and Mushroom along with Chicken Fried Rice. Concluded that Chicken Fried Rice is quite oily but descent in taste though. The Crispy Chilli Babycorn is really crisp and good to go. Chicken with Veg and Mushroom was the best in class with good amount of shredded chicken and big sliced mushroom pieces in it.

First things first the food out here is simply amazing!We were four friends who ended up their on Valentine's day and inspite of huge rush we found a table for four.It's location makes it an easy hang out place.We had ordered Chicken Honey Lollipops,A special combo was there for Valentine's day which comprised of mixed chowmein,chilli chicken and chicken wanton(I don't exactly remember the name!!) and finally Spicy chicken wings.The combos were enough to suffice one!But I would truely recommend the Honey Lollipops to anyone who goes out there.They were the best part.The only thing that's bothering is their service its pretty unsatisfactory.You have to keep reminding their waiters about your order.
It's priced reasonably so I'm coming back here again! :)

Its more of a college hang out zone..the ambience has a loud noise made by birds all around the lake nearby (evening).

There are few places which serve excellent food that you want to go to the place again and again. Food is the ultimate treat in a place like Crub Club. To start with their fish fry with finger chips or fish finger or spring chicken, every item is a champ in its own right. Though I am not a thukpa fan but their sometimes try their Prawn thukpa or veg momo which is tasty like its other counterparts. I simply love prawns so their prawn chowmein inevitably fall in my preference. I am a rice person so, mixed Manchurian fried rice is what I prefer most. Sometimes I prefer prawn fried rice. As they have a massive collection of chicken items I also prefer their chili chicken, Manchurian chicken, lemon chicken, honey chicken, hong kong chicken all these are so good that I love to have them again and again. The restaurant has answered my search for lamb delicacies their Manchurian lamb, oyster lamb, spicy lamb, some of these may be hot making your face look reddish but they are truly awesome. Bengalis fondness for their fish delicacies such as macher jhol, macher jhal, mach vaja etc is a globally known fact, in the restaurant I sometimes like true bengali relish their chilli fish, fish chilli mustard, Manchurian fish and many more.

Ask any school or college student(in South Kolkata) where he goes out to eat with friends and you will hear the name of grub club. We have all been there haven't we?
Really cheap and tasty food. I was pleasantly surprised when Grub Club expanded and included new cuisines to their menu. The quantity is enough to satisfy any hungry school or college kid and the food is priced in such a way that your pocket money will cover your meals.
Their starters are fantastic. Try the chilly pork for sure.¬†
The only downside is that once in a while, especially during the festive season the quality of food might dip, but in general Grub Club has attained a cult status amongst students in South Kolkata.

The Grub Club is a lovely little place for a wonderfully tasty and satisfying meal without burning a hole in your pocket.Located right at Gol park crossing I have been visiting this place since my school days and still it remains one joint that I really like.

The place is basically some garage converted into an eatery.So if you are looking for fine dining this is not the place for you.It is not even air conditioned.But the seating arrangements are quite sufficient.And the best thing about this place is the excellent system of paying at the counter,getting yourself a seat and enjoying your meal.This No Frills attached system is something that I really like and it works incredibly smoothly here.

Coming to the food,the menu has become all the more extensive over the years and today there is biryani,Italian and a few continental items on offer along with obviously the Chinese,with which this place started off and actually made its name.I generally stick to the chinese.The momos are soft and succulent.The pan fried momo is a big hit here.The sauce is hot spicy and tasty.The crispy chicken and chicken lollypops are good too.The main course is nothing exceptional but quite good nonetheless.My all time favourite here is the spicy honey chicken.It is absolutely brilliant.Every bite of that dish is truly fascinating.I end up ordering this every time I visit.

The staff are very helpful.The service is quite swift.The prices are extremely reasonable and the quality they serve up at that price is really appreciable.

All in all if you are looking for a pocket friendly yet filling and tasty meal,there are very few better options than The Grub Club.

To be rightly said-it's a vibrant joint for the chirpy crowd. Simply choose what you would like to have, order and pay at the counter, find yourself a place, eat and go!
My first stint at this place came a few months back. There is ample sitting space and you can almost always manage a seat unless you are in a large group. The people serving here are friendly, ready to help and when sought for, were ready to oblige. I ordered for a platter of tempura chicken and mixed fried rice. Went up to the counter,paid for what i needed and came back,food arrived a little later-fresh and hot. This was what i absolutely liked about the place after having rave encounters at other places where after you come back from the counter people often seem to forget that you had ordered for something!!!! Coming to the quantity and quality of food I must say that they serve good food in good portions at pocket friendly prices, which ensures that it's never a one time visit. The fried rice had liberal amounts of chicken in it and tasted great and coming to the tempura chicken, I absolutely loved it. It had a tangy and sweet taste and had cherries in it. I¬† was at first skeptic about how it would turn out after seeing those cherries on the platter.But wait, I shouldn't have been so because it turned out to be of real good taste keeping the buds craving for more! I absolutely liked this place and am surely going to EAT and repEAT over here!!!

An absolute fan of this joint..I cannot count the innumerable times I have visited here. Its always the food and the casual hangout mood that attracts me towards it. One can even go alone , sit, eat , pay and simply leave. The chinese and thai are mind blowing. Its self order and instant payment at the cash. The staffs are well versed about the menu. A highly recommended dish is the kung pao chicken  and the special grub club gravy noodles. However recently I did try the vegetarian.  The stir fried pepper mushroom as the  starters ar e must for all. Its amazing cooked. What theu do not prepare well is the sweet and sour chicken. Its a big NO NO. In Their italian section, the chicken creamy cheesy pasta can be definitely tried. Its simply superb. After a tedious shopping at gariahat, its grub club that feeds your tummy, saves your foot soles and leta your pocket rest in piece.

The place is okay. The seating is alright. The food is tolerable. Order their standard Indo-Chinese things and you won't be disappointed. The service is good too. But, I was disappointed with their Italian. The chicken pasta we ordered needed more cheese(as so often with places that sell Italian in this city). Otherwise, the place is pocket-friendly. Do try out their chocolate ice creams if you visit this place.

So, where to start? 
It's basically a garage that's been converted into a restaurant. The crowd is mostly young, the service pretty smooth and the place,  just about clean. The prices are pretty cheap and the place is sort of tailor made for the college crowd that perennially short on money. 
Now, for food. Try out the momos,  they're decent. Fried chicken, dry chilli chicken, the usual fare. What I keep going back for though, is the it chili pork and pork in black bean sauce. And the prawn. Large juicy tiger prawns. 
They also sell juices and ice creams (sundaes) which are again, really good. 
So if you're light on the wallet, but want some good food, this is the place to go!

Last time I went there they seemed to have discontinued pork dishes on their "Today's Special" menu. For the life of me I couldn't fathom why, since that was one of the eatery's many USPs.

This is the highest rating i have given to any food joint ever ..why ???? coz is bloody ossum that's why ..anyways i was one of those frequent customer in this joint but until yesterday i was never compelled to write a review for this because i was so stupid not to try their chicken alfredo "  or their "spicy chicken wings" ...sometimes i wonder i am so going to hell for just looking at the chicken after having a bite but trust me but then why will you ..?? Anyways after taking one bite from that spicy chicken wings instead of looking at that chicken my eyes were closed just savoring the flavours of that spicy coating on that delicious piece of chicken, but as soon as i opened my eyes it was all gone ..i tell you friends can be a curse at times...whatever we ordered, for me the flavours were bang on..though the sizzler could have been a little better but "jao maaf kiya " :p .. 

what you should order - chicken spicy wings , chicken alfredo ,chilli chicken dry and other stuffs which I didn‚Äôt order but you can :p

value for money -  if i can go there and not whine about the prices its cheap and if u still whine about the prices .you are a jew 

so go and enjoy ..

p.s - if you go their take my name ....you might get extra napkins ..jst saying

The first time i visited this place was during the summer days. My first reaction when my friend suggested me this restaurant was an immediate NO..since this place lacks air conditioning and during summer times it becomes really a concern. But he forced me literally to try this place out and told me that i would forget about the ac once i grab a bite from this place. How true he was! From that day on..whether it's summer,winter,monsoon or anything..whenever i pass by golpark i make it a point to drop here and grab a quick bite. I have tried only their chinese items and believe me each and every item is unbelievably delicious! They have a wide range of items to choose from. Each item is better than the other..you would not be able to decide which is the best one! I love their desserts..the sundae they make is enough to fill up two people just fine. No complaints regarding their quality as well as quantity. The seating arrangement is also decent. The staff is courteous and is always ready to help. I deducted 0.5 because i don't really like the idea of paying first,taking the bill,handing them over to the waiter and then getting your stuff. Once or twice it's ok but more than that it becomes tedious. But other that that..a really awesome place to hang out with peers and family..and i would recommend this place to everyone who would like to grab a tasty bite without getting pocket pinched!!

probably the cheapest " restaurant " in golpark... has its own pros and cons as well.. cons include the lack of an air conditioner , not a very good seating style ( as per personal opinion ) .. probably a lot better for takeaways... pros include good quality of chinese food... ¬†the oyster lamb and ¬†chilli garlic noodles are my personal favourites... prices are reasonable and quantities are sufficient.. fast service and pocket friendliness make it ideal for dinner plans with friends..

A lot of takeaways had been brought from grub club but they were mostly finger food which tasted decent, rather good as per the rates. Today was the first time I stepped into the eatery to sit and eat. I was extremely happy to see such low prices on the menu card and ordered for a chicken mushroom soup, chicken mushroom fried rice, black pepper garlic fish and chicken sweet n sour. First came in the soup: I don't mind salty food so I found it good but the mushrooms were undercooked and though the chicken was shredded, I didn't find much of it on my bowl. Then came in the rice: the ultimate disappointment of the day. The amount of oil seemed to be more than the rice. Seriously the rice and mushrooms were overcooked with oil oozing out of everything. It didn't look appetising from any angle. The chicken and the fish dishes were good but then again the batter coating was thicker than required. I gave The grub club a 3 because it is really a pocket friendly place and serves good finger food. I am ready to give another try because it might have been a bad day and people have given me good reviews about it.

This is one of our favourite eating joints from college days.. a place which serves good quality Chinese in a moderate price. The grub club special fried rice was a fixed choice whenever I visited this place.. it's awesome! I also liked the pepper chicken nd other side dish items here.. The restaurant is not that big or fancy, but if you love good food, you should definitely ignore these nd give this a try.

P.S: The different ice cream combos here are also worth trying.. :-)

This restaurant¬† is the best place for college goers. Very cheap and good quality food are the key features of this place. I visit here very often and I am never disappointed. They have a long menu card with immense varieties of delicacies and the best part is every food is available throughout the year! My favorites are Chiken Spicy Wings and Lat Me Kai. But the most unique thing which you should try is Lasagne. It tastes heavenly. 
They also have a variety of yummy ice cream sundaes for desert!!
In short this place is the ultimate place for a foody!!

Had walked into this place,last evening with a lot of expectations....as the name of this place resonated in my head,from reminiscing Zomato reviews,and other friends' recommendations...

My day had commenced beautifully and I wanted it to end the same way...and so there I was with my bestie...We walked right In,1:40 pm..and finding near about every seat occupied..we chose to sit at the table nearest to the counter...we ordered Konjee Lamb,Grub Club special Chowmein and Prawn Sweet and Sour....and yes Blue Lagoon...

We had to wait for about 25 mins for our order to be served...the first order that came up to our table was Blue Lagoon and Konjee Lamb...

as I sipped from my glass...i deciphered the lagoon to be a mixture of vanilla ice cream scoop and sprite..it kinda tasted good...it was the first time i was tasting it...

the Lamb dish was obviously spicy, as mentioned on the menu... i popped a piece of lamb in....and the next thing i knew was....i was chewing hard....when i looked at my pal...he too had the same reaction...moreover we could not even cut a piece into two on the plate,using a fork...I have had lamb before...but this dish was far from it in tenderness...it was rather hard and seemed rubbery...overcooked...

When the Grub Club special chow arrived...we could not wait to dig into it...

but just when i had my first mouthful...a strong eggy smell hit my palate....its one of those eggy smells,which refuse to leave even after you wash your hands several times...after dipping your hands into a bowl of beaten egg...the noodles had no traces of chicken.it was overtly oily...i could only see two or five tiny prawns peeping out of the heap...a whole egg,potched (that is where the eggy smell originated) and weirdly enough two whitish papads with a pink border on each..!!!

When the prawn dish arrived we took a piece each from the serving dish...and when i took in a little portion of the gravy....i had my lesson...it was so excessively sweet....and the gravy was similar in taste to the red sauce which roadside roll shops serve inside egg rolls....no herbs...no capsicum,no spring onions..nothing! only a piece of cucumber and also a piece of pineapple! the prawns were under cooked and were almost inedible

and meanwhile when i kept sipping into the blue lagoon,it started giving rise to some inexplicable discomfort,inside....and there was this crestfallen feeling which was gaining ground...never in my foodie journey,have i had such an experience...where each eager anticipation turns out into utter disappointment...

here i would like to state that i have nothing personal against grub club...i had dropped in last evening with happy spirits,a roaring appetite,and an air of accomplishment in choosing the right place to eat.as i have mentioned earlier that i wanted a happy ending to my lovely day...but seriously,this visit became a total spoiler....all i feel now is I was let down...and this is definitely one such place where i shall never drop by again...and shall never recommend it to anyone else who is very particular about food...

Pathetic service & rude behavior

The outlet is not fit for family dining. So, we used to order home delivery. But today the delivery was not only extremely late, when we called them again to enquire about it, they were extremely rude and mislead us even further. They just hung up on us, even before giving a clear answer. We tried to call again but our calls went unanswered.

When the delivery guy finally arrived (much later) by then we had got food from another Chinese joint with much better & prompt service and well-behaved staff. So we simply refused to accept the parcel.

Many of my friends have endorsed this particular outlet for hanging out with friends over some nice food for more than two years . Last saturday we went there at last . The place is good but the interiors are not that you call attractive. But seeing it as a hangout place rather than a restro the interiors look ok. We had heard so much about the momo there that we orderd two plates of the steamed chicken momo.

The momo, priced at 70rs per plate arrived in ten minutes. I expected six momo pieces but saw they gave only five but the sizes were good . But as much as we had heard about the tastes for me the taste was a bit bland and the soup that came along had too much salt in it . The soup had no extra chicken pieces nor had any different taste. The hot sauce was piping hot and was the sole reason why we could finish the dumplings . I would not try the momo there again as i felt the taste was bland. Most of the others there were eating the Chicken Noodles and I guess that is a safe bet if you visit the restaurant .

The ambience is not good. Its basically in someone's Garrage. You don't get value for your money neither in terms of quality nor in terms of quanyity. The big plus is it's location.

The GRUB CLUB was one of my most regular places 2 years back. Situated just opposite to Golpark Ramkrishna Mission, this non-AC ¬†young crowd joint is surely one of the best places for college goers. Owing to its pocket friendly long menu and tasty delights, it is one of the must visits in South Kolkata. My all time favorites were Crispy lamb, Chicken fried rice, Chicken Alfredo, Lollipops. The food will not blow ur mind, but it will satisfy you at least. Unfortunately I fell sick once after having food here, and since then have not visited this place (oh, bad omen :P). There is a tree in betwenn the restro which they decorate with lights, tables are closely spaced, always noisy for people chatting and laughing, it is more of a friendly get together :-)

Been there quite a number of time during my school days. The name itself is very catchy.However this is not a place for fine dining.¬†

Last time i was there i tried Crispy chili baby corn which was not so good. Other than that we had ordered Mixed chowmein(hakka),sweet n sour chicken and chiili fish. All of them were quite good.¬†

The thing i absolutely love about this restro is that the dishes are damn cheap for a restaurant situated at Golpark. N the quantity of food is good. Very pocket friendly kind of a place.¬†

N i just love the different kinds of float they offer. The ice creams are nice too.

Yet to try the thai n italian dishes they offer. Will keep on visiting to try them.:-)

A popular place among the locals...food tastes good enough to sit and have a good time with friends. The sitting space is a lil crampy but its manageable. The service is just fine. A place you can ease yourself without disappointing your taste buds. Pocket pinch is not much.

The reason I love this place its because of its budget and the quality of the food.
This place has always been reasonable,thats y I'm always attracted towards it.
Even the location is great,opp to Ram Krishna Mission building in Golpark.
Whenever I order it for a large no. of people,I call up for home delivery.
It'll be delivered much before the scheduled time.
The only thing which disappoints me,is the non-ac factor,due to which the place becomes quite stuffy.Its very uncomfortable in summer.
And the place is not too big.So if by any chance it is crowded,one have to wait for a long time.

Amazing place..!! I am not fond of chinese food but this place blew my mind...its non air conditioned so its better to go on a rainy day or in the winters.....simple concept.... Just order at the cash counter...and find a seat...and a waiter will come and serve you...its really pocket friendly compared to the quality of the food..the menu has good variety..if you are a spicy food lover then have to try out the chilli garlic noodles...but beware the quantity of the serving is quite good....so avoid over ordering...dont miss the huge tree bark inside the joint......all in all a nice pocket friendly place for Chinese food enthusiast's...

One of my favorite place since my college times.it is one of the restaurent in Kol where you can have most delicious continental foods and pocket will be safe too. Althoug the cost is low but the quality and quantity of food is good. And for that reason this place most popular among college going students.  Only draw back of this place is little dirty. Otherwise ambience is good. My most favorite item in Grub Club is chicken pasta and chicken alakin.

This place is a nice one.

The 1st thing you look in a restaurant is the cleanliness. In that matter though it is neat and clean but there is no proper washroom(which definitely is a drawback).

In food department, they are very good. Tasty and lovely food at a very reasonable price. Never been disappointed.

The service is good too. They take good care of customers.

The place is open enough on other hand. Not recommended for people looking for privacy.

To sum it up, you won't be disappointed here if you are looking for good food, no matter what! And if that's the case go and give it a try! :)

Heard a lot about this place, was excited for a visit, n i surely wasnot disappointed.. 

-------------------------LOCATION----------------------------

This place is situated in Golpark, drop down in Golpark, look for Ram Krishna Mission, n very close to it you can find for HDFC Bank n just beside it you can find Grub Club.. 

--------------------------AMBIENCE--------------------------

Dont go here just for ambience but for the food.. 
This place will look just like any ordinary roadside resturant, but does offer a wide range of dishes along with a finger licking quality.. 
There is no AC n the tables are a bit small along with some uncomfortable chairs.. 

-------------------QUALITY N QUANTITY---------------

We ordered
CHILI. CHICKEN BONELESS DRY - - - - 
The quality was excellent, the pieces were soft n smelt good along with the taste which also felt high quality,you will get 8pieces of chicken in a single plate which is enough for a couple..

CHILI CHICKEN MANCHURIAN FRIED RICE - - 
This was also deliciously cooked n the quantity is enough for a couple, but i felt the rice could be a little soft,but overall it was good

HUNAN CHICKEN - - - - - - - - - 
M really not a fan of those chicken dishes which tastes a bit sour, but here i found an exception, it was beautifully cooked n went great with manchurian fried rice

Chocolate Caramel Ice Cream - - - - - - 
We ordered 3 scoops n did tasted great, nothing too much to say about this. 

------------------BEHAVIOR OF STAFFS-----------------

Polite n friendly, we did ask for them for a couple of times, but they were polite n did help us with a smile

-----------------------------PRICING---------------------------

The pricing is moderate considering the food they were offering.. 
The items found on menu were inclusive of taxes. And we were charged 575rs for our entire meaL. 

-----------------------TO THE OWNERS-------------------

An AC during summer would be a great addition to this place, and i wont mind giving a few bucks more for this addition.. 

So in conclusion Great Food, no ambience, well behaved staffs and i will definitely visit this place again n again, and the wide variety of dishesis really a great point for this place....

We had heard a lot about this place from our family friends so one particular Sunday we decided to check the place out. The whole family went. Since we are vegetarian we ordered for veg steamed momo a hakka and manchurian. The service was ok. The food was good, but we had an issue. Instead of veg soup they had served us chicken soup. We had asked them whether the soupvwas vegetarian and they reassured it was. Fortunately my cousin used to have chicken so he realized it was not veg. We bought the attention to the matter immediately. It was really a careless and irresponsible behaviour on their part. So even though the food was good, I wouldn't go there again.

This is the perfect place for school or college students as it is economic and it fits the pocket money. There is no ambience, it's just a passage or "uthon" in Bengali which has chairs and tables placed. Coming to the food... It's average, though my favorite is momo and chowmein(noodles). 
PS- it's not a place for elders with sophisticated choices...

This has been one of the heritage places of South Kolkata. Situated at Golpark and mostly populated by college crowd from nearby. this place serves as a very good refreshment center. Almost open air small restaurants with a comfortable enough sitting conditions and the food is very good also. The service is a little bit on the downside as the place is always crowded and the order is always high, so it takes a little to come, but the wait is worth it. ¬†The momo, lasagnia is particulalry very tasty and worth trying. The place is not at all expensive and the desert choices are also great and very much tasty. Highly recommended.

So after our exams finally got over, we planned to go for an eating spree and ended up over here. The place was not at all difficult to find. The restaurant occupied a huge space and reminded me of roadside dhaba. We were really hungry and ordered Singapore Meifoon, Hong Kong fried rice and chiken with baby corn. The method of placing order is very convenient. This is the first time I tasted meifoon which was very tasty. Since I m a diehard lover of rice, the Hong Kong fried rice impressed my taste buds. The chicken was also very nice cooked. The USP of this place is the huge quantity of food they offer and that too at such a reasonable price. I m surely going to come back to taste the pazzta and pizzas over here given my love for Italian food.

Grub club comes to my mind every time my pocket is in a poor state yet my stomach and heart shamelessly yearn for a tasty lunch :D I know this place lacks an air condition and the ambiance is nothing worth mentioning but the place never fails to delight your taste buds and wallet together. :)

¬†You need to pay at the counter and wait for your food at your table. They give you a receipt¬† and you are supposed to keep it intact till the food is served. 

Some dishes which I love from here are :

1. Chicken Fried Rice
2. Chicken Meifoon : This is the first place where I tried meifoon and started loving it since then. :D
3. Mandarin Chicken
4. Crispy Chilli Baby corn

The name is eye catching but not the restaurant. It is like some upgraded roadside dhaba. Most irritating part is that u have to choose your dishes first, pay your bill and then u can sit. Afterwards if u feel that u need some more item then again u have to go to the cash counter for the same procedure. It is pocket friendly but food quality is so so..

Went there with my pals yesterday here as i have heard so much about this place from friends newspaper everywhere. But i must tell u that at the end of the day the experience was just pathetic i felt very disappointed with their service. The ambiance the service of the staff everything was horrible. They just stand by at the corner and don't even feel to ask or attend to customers. On top of that just imagine that we have to call them everytime for refilling of water. And the food i.e mixed chowmein and chicken Manchurian and Manchurian rice was so tasteless. the total experience was so disappointing. On a scale of 5 will give it 0.5 and would never ever suggest this place to my family and friends :(

Grub Club has been the place which we used to go to during school life weekends for a "GRAND" lunch with friends.
Today, I go there to reminisce.¬†
It has always amazed me how a restaurant which looks like a garage serves so much good food.¬†
I don't think there's anything left on the menu which I haven't tried at Grub Club. Trust me, I have had it pretty much all.¬†But yes, the taste of Grub Club fluctuates very much. Somedays its excellent, and some days they are just bad.
The Pot Rice is something you cannot miss here. The pan fried momos are quite yummy too.
I remember having an obsession about the Combo Meal they offered. However, that doesn't appeal to me anymore.
I feel this place is okay when you want to grab a quick bite.
However, the service and the taste may disappoint you at times.

To tell you the truth, twice have I been to The Grub Club so far, the first being when we friends decided to celebrate our last day in school and the next being during the Pujas next year (as we unfortunately ran out of alternatives). The experience at this place is of a bitter one. The fried rice dishes were slightly uncooked, and the gravy chowmein dishes were not up to the mark. The soups appeared as if the ingredients were just boiled in water and hence served. Both the Chinese as well as the American chopsueys came with tomato sauces already spread over the dishes. Although missed out on trying the lambs (a dish which has been endorsed by so many here), whatever we tasted, did not appeal to our (probably sensitive) taste buds. Yet, it is a place where you can drop in without feeling any pinch in your wallet later on.

It provides the right ambience to catch up with an old friend after a fairly long time! You can talk on the top of your voice, and nobody will mind. And ofcourse along with that comes tasty food, which does not pinch your pocket. Great in quantity, and also quite tasty. I have been so frequent to Grub Club, that I could now live without it for sometime into future. :)

First of, this place might leave you unimpressed. What one would see the minute he or she walks into the place, is just an arrangement of tables and chairs, a few servers strewn about, no air conditioning, no 'decor' to speak of. 
But the reason it is such a dear name for college-goers and such, because the pocket pinch for a substantial quantity of pretty decent food is almost next to nothing. That is exactly why this non-descript eating joint reigns over Gariahat-Golpark region so successfully, despite lacking a few given prerequisites for other eating holes. 
Set near the Lake, it's good to drop by after a stroll or a swim in the evening to hang out with friends or maybe a quick lunch for the office-goers or a fast takeaway for dinner. 
So come for cheap, good food. Bring many a friend and definitely try their Spicy Chicken Wings. My personal favourite there.

I visit this place every time i am confused about what to eat and a little low on budget..this is a perfect adda place, and you end up bumping on someone you know! 
Now the food, its your sheer luck..you get delicious food for 80% of the times and the rest of the times either the pan fried noodles is saggy or the momos are basically onion momo! But i absolutely get upset if i don't have their personalised ice cream (my personal favourite is their blind love)
I tried out their lemon chicken and it has a tangy flavour and i was delighted, but my all time favourite is their pan fried noodles! I know this place lacks an air condition and the service depends on how safely you keep the payment slip but i am just loyal to this place since ages..

Visited the place just a few days back with a friend of mine. Medium sized place, so you may have to wait a bit if its the rush hour. The place is extremely close to the Ramakrishna Mission Institute and is a great a option if you are a bit low on budget. 

The food is quite good and the ambiance is okay! We ordered amercian chopseuy ( non veg) and crispy chicken. Although the gravy for the chopseuy was quite delicious, the noodles were not quite up to the mark. 

One thing I didnt like was the billing system. One has to get the bill done at the counter itself. Would be better if it was the usual way round. Otherwise, good when you have a great appetite and lower budget.

This is the place where I tasted my first lamb! A decent, pocket friendly and non ac food place that is always full of young people, chatting away to glory. 
Visited here after a long time today, after collecting my result from RKM, during the very heavy rainfall, since it is situated just on the opposite footpath. You need to pay at the counter and wait for your food at your table. They give you the bill (once, I lost my slip and they made a huge hue and cry) and you are supposed to keep the slip intact till the food is served. 
We ordered chicken steam momo and drums of heaven today. The momos were quite the usual, zero on presentation and a little on the colder side though. The drums of heaven were VERY disappointing. The food quality here has deteriorated. I hope they make the thukpas (that I like best here) properly even now.
Lastly we ordered Chocolate sundae with wafer and cashew. It was AMAZING! and made up for the food.
However, Grub Club has always satisfied my taste buds in the past unlike today, so I hope it was just one bad day today and they will continue to serve better, just how they did, in future.

I love Grub Club. Have always. If you appreciate your restaurants decorated and plush, then you better steer clear. This is a fairly big place with very basic decor. You order at the counter, handed a stub and the waiter checks it before bringing your food. Place serves Indian Chinese, some Mexican, some Italian and some continental fares. Most of the time it is packed with people, conversations gurgling from every side. A tree trunk decorated with tiny lights kind of serves as the entryway to the dining area. It always have.
I love Pan fried momo, chili pork, spicy honey chicken, crispy chicken and Pan fried mixed noodles. I keep sticking to these. Ialso liked the pasta in white sauce and fish fry.  The Thupka is filling and comforting in rainy or winter evenings. The portions are good and the service is fast. Prices are very easy on your pocket. Feed your whole gang and the damage is way below the four figure mark. 
A place for the tired gariahat shoppers and college student alike to gorge on yummy Chinese food.

I had gone to drop my relative to gariahat so decided to parcel our dinner from here since there was a realtive who wanted to have chinese. Ambiance wise the place has nothing much to mention about. Serivce was great as I was very thirsty requested them to give me 3 glasses of water on different intervals and they did oblige me by bringing water immediately. My order consisted of

veg manchow soup: was very tasty.. low on ajinomoto .. just the right amount of spice
chicken manchow soup:same as the above
red hot chicken: I m not a chicken lover I love fish more but this prep was really good 
Konjee Babycorn: Amazing is the only word I had to describe it
Chilli Fish: Was very average 1 mark deducted is only for this dish. It really didnt taste of bhetki fish. Could have been much much better
Three treasure veg: Great Preparation
Veg Noodles : Good
veg fried rice:Nice

Order took around 20 mins to reach the table and the bill amounted to 962. A nice experience except the fish.

Had it been 1-2 years back, this joint would have got a 3.5 out of five. It had never been a posh joint but the food used to be excellent and proportions huge when compared to the pricing. It used to be a haven for college goers who are short on the pocket money as also a place for a home delivery for an unplanned party at home. However the quality of food has now deteriorated and the delicate balance of flavours lost in most of their dishes. Now they try to cover up by adding too much of chilli to almost all of their dishes (even sweet and sour chicken!!). I sincerely hope that the management sees into this or else in the near future it will lose its fame....

I love to have chowmein so I generally have chicken chowmein and a side chicken preparation. The give huge quantity of food so it might be possible that u may not be able to eat up everything. There is NO AC. But its quite airy inside. There are many tables as the place is quite big.¬† The place is a little gloomy with low lighting. Service is prompt and good.

I had gone here in past after my dada suggested to try in once.and since then I am fond of this restaurant.situated near golpark mor.if you are a fan of Chinese cuisine,it should be a must go for you.
I loved the most-
1.chowmins and the chiken dishes.specialy their schezwan fried rice and the GARLIC chiken is the dish I am fond of.
2.you can have the best momos in this area here.
The backdrops-
1.this place is always so much crowded that tou have to wait to have a chance inside.
2. The main thing that I hate most about this place,you have to give your order by going to the counter.then they will serve you.and behaviour of the waiters and serving method is not so lovely.

A great place to hang around with friends and enjoy great food.I visited this place nearly 2 months ago.The place was quite packed during afternoon hours.We ordered hakka chow, dry chilli chicken, and a honey.The order came fast but with flaws.They gave us a different dish which someone else ordered,the worst part was that when they realized their mistake they just came and took away the dish without asking or even an apology.Talking about the food, the chow was same as most of the places nothing extraordinary, the dry chilli chicken was great and cooked to the right amount, the honey chicken was  mediocre types.Overall the food was ok but the service must improve..3.5 stars to the place..

I have had the chance to grab a meal at this place a few times and honestly speaking, the experience was nothing that I can't live without. It's not really a restaurant but more of a shack. Every single time you wanted to order something you needed to go to the counter and order, even between meals I believe. The fact that you get to rub shoulders with fellow strangers isn't something that excites  me either. The food is okay and that's about it.

Fan of oily, spicy Chinese food, are you? Then this is your place to be. And if you have been put down by the words oily and spicy, then please read them as lip smackingly tasty. Whenever I go to The Grub Club, I never miss to order the red hot chicken. It makes you fume and you will have tears in your eyes, but you will keep coming back for that taste that will stick to your taste buds for ever. The noodles and hot garlic chicken is good too. The interiors of the restaurant is different in that, that a huge tree trunk goes right through the roof. Also, it is quite cosy and you will feel comfortable at once.  You will have to spend very little money here and will be extremely satisfied.  I would have given it a five star rating had it been air conditioned.

Reasonable priced food at the heart of the city. Grub Club is really a place I have been visiting since last 10years I guess. Soup, Thukpa, Chinese was always there. But recent additions of Italian food, Beverages made it more happening. Try out the new chilli pork, its just awesome. The ambience is also cool hangout option for couples, group of friends.

I have been to this place since my school days. You can get both indian as well as chinese dishes here. Both the taste as well as the price is moderate. Few dishes of pork and lamb are quite tasty. Definitely not a very happening place as this place doesn't have an AC. But if you are looking for a place to have quality food at affordable price then this can be ur option.

Grub Club happens to be one of my favorites among the vast number of eateries around the Golpark-Southern Avenue area.The variety of food available there is really admiring, they sell almost everything...all cuisines. Chinese, Italian must have real god cooks.The best thing is, the price is real cheap, best for trying out anything new.You won't be disappointed.Do drop in whenever you are near that area.

The place is a nice one. Only problem is you have to pay when you order and not at the end of a meal.

The food is quite good and it goes real easy on the pockets. 
I don't know about the Indian cuisines, but the Chinese food is definitly worth a feast.

Do not expect ACs and a posh seating. No. Its the simple next door restaurant which will not leave you unsatisfied.

Ambience: 3/5
Food: 4/5
Value for Money: 4/5

Earlier i used to notice this place almost every other day while coming back home but never had the opportunity to try their food.Finally after hearing a lot of mixed reviews one fine evening i opted for a take away.For starters i hd ordered the chilly garlic pepper chicken.i hd also ordered the manchurian noodles ("mixed") and the schezwan rice ("mixed") and i gues a chicken manchurian or sumtn.The food arrived in no time.Now coming to the food.There s only one way to describe it.below average(a polite way of saying bad)and trust me wen i say bad it really is bad bcuz m not olways very critical wen it comes to food.bt this was jusy not good.the chilly pepper garlic chicken was tough n rubbery.the noodles were bland and not properly salted.the rice.-just bad.noyhing else bad.and i rilly didn understand wat the "mixed" meant especially for the rice.could barely manage to find a few strips of fried egg and a oiece of chicken if lucky.the manchurian or watever that dat.the chiken was coated n a thick layer of cornflour.al u could taste was d coating.and the gravy was absolutely disgusting and bland.so definitely wont be visitin this "club" for a second time.and if ur lucky enough to not have tried it yet.dont.it is pathetic.

Grub Club located in southern avenue serves up good chinese food.Their food has been consistently good which i feel is a good thing,because many restaurants promise to be good in the beginning but lose the consistency in as they continue.The place dosent boast of fancy decors,yet it is always brimming with people. Also this restaurant does a lot of delivery and takeaways so you will  find everyone busy here.But that dosent mean the service is not good.Infact it is good. 
Coming to the food, the konjee crispy babycorn is an absolute favourite,so is the crispy chilli potato, both crisped to perfection and prepared wonderfully.I like the hot and sour soup here which i feel is a must try.Noodles like chilli garlic noodles and schezwan accompanied by honey paneer( you should try this) ,3 treasure vegetables in a dark gravy are lip smacking.
The portions are sufficient for 2 ( by order of 1 dish each) and the prices is what makes this place stand out!Extremely pocket friendly.
Grub Club is a perfect example of great food at good prices.#Paisawasoolkhaana

Well to most of Grub Clubs regular customers, it is one places you ought to go if you are in golpark! No wonder I was at Grub Club atleast 3 times every week!! I have not been there in a while though! Although golpark will not be a golpark without a grub club there, i am liberal with a 3.5 when it comes to rating it.
It is a great place, reflecting the hustle of south kolkata, with all the youth and stuff. Nice outdoor-indoor decor. The tree in the middle of everything is pretty neat.
Talking of the food, I have been eating there for about 7 years. I am saddened to say that the quality of food has been declining. The problem in my opinion is the non standardized cooking. Different chefs have different opinions for simple dishes like the gravy chow. Sometimes its thick(the way i like it), sometimes its watery, sometimes its something in the middle, sometimes you cannot even call it a gravy chowmien.
They had very good lasagna until they started serving it in aluminium foil cups. I do not know if they still do that. 
Momos are good. Talking of indian platter, the biriyani is not to die for. You want biriyani? well grub club is not the place.
The chicken items are pretty good. I love the chicken in oyster sauce. They have really really good thupka. 
All in all it is a nice place to visit if you are  in the locality without digging in way too deep in your pockets. But do not be surprised if you are let down on your first visit. That might be a bad day at the kitchen. Some days, The Grub Club is just amazing.

Although its a non-AC restaurant its the perfect place to hang out with friends. I have been there several times. This place is really nice for Chinease food. Mixed fried rice with chilly chicken or Shezwan Chicken is a must here. They will serve really fast if you order Chinease food. The combination of Service quality,food quality and the price was perfect years ago.
But then I recently visited Grub Club with three of my friends and ordered Chicken Burgers and Spaghetti. The burgers were delivered after 20mins but then we had to wait for 40mins for Chicken Spaghetti !! Now, waiting 40mins for Chicken Spaghetti is not reasonable. The price for burgers were normal but Spaghetti was pretty high compared to the quality and quantity served. The service quality has been really deteriorated. But the quality of ice cream they still serve now is wonderful!!

I used to love this place. Very light on the pockets and beautiful on the the tongue, I would visit here almost every time I went out with friends. But over the years price has increased and food quality as well as customer service has deteriorated to a point where I don't feel like spending on this place anymore. Wish they improve soon. This place used to be very good. The Mexican items and Chinese items were really good. Never tried Indian here though.

Edit: Although I must warn people about one thing. It is a personal bad experience though. Try not to take home delivery from this place. Although the quality and quantity remains unaltered, they tend to mix up dishes a lot. Meifoon becomes chow or chilli chicken becomes Manchurian chicken or they just decide to give chicken chow instead of mixed chow and stuff like that. And when it's home delivery, you cannot do anything about it coz no one really opens the packet to check. They also add unnecessary packaging charge, which they are allowed to, but never mention them when asked about the total bill. So just be careful.

Edit: I tried the place after a long time yesterday. And whereas I am more into chinese, I decided to make the meal completely continental. A chicken burger, a chicken lasagna , a chicken tetrazzini and chicken alfredo. And I was mindblown. It was a treat to the taste buds. Although getting it packed wasn't that good an idea, but it was still amazing. The continental part of this joint is significantly better than the chinese part.

Located near Golpark just a stone's throw away distance from our college, this has been one of our favorite food joint for the last three years. Be it a birthday treat or just a hunger stricken lunch The Grub Club never failed to satisfy me. The system here is prepaid, i.e. one needs to order and pay first and then are served with the food. The interiors are done in a canteen manner and its totally appropriate with the kind of crowd that visits this place, mainly college goers and local office goers. The food at its pocket friendly price is worth appreciation. I absolutely love their Chicken Honey Lollipops. They are must in my each and every visit. They have a variety of cuisine to offer so one becomes spoiled for choice..

Location : Right at Golpark. 

Ambiance : Not worth mentioning . But the staff are very knowledgeable and helpful. Although they aren't the quickest and forget the fact that one needs to offer water first !!

Food : Since it was my first time , took the safe route with Vegetable fried Rice and Chilli Chicken. Besides didn't have much cash :P ! Strangely enough they ask payment even before the food is meted out to you !! The place is more like a hangout joint for college goers. The only thing that impressed me is the waiting time. Within 10 minutes the food was served. Plain dishes, nothing fancy but quite tasty compared to the very economical prices. Both the rice and the chicken were hot , aromatic and delightful. 

Final Conclusion : Not bad at all. No wonder they are still running. At a Cost for 2 of about 350/- this was quite a nice experience. Thumbs up from me

This place always be seen in bit of hustle, but one my friend dragged me through this, so I had no option but to eat. 

I passed my order, a plate of pan fried momo, if you are new to this place, you have to know these people don‚Äôt take orders manually, but you have to take the pledge by placing your order at the counter, and by they will hand over an order slip to you. After that you have to keep a watch on the cooking counter while everyone around you is slipping their food down. 

Finally, after a long food pause, I got to see my food. My plate was looking deliciously good, and when I took a mouthful I was not disappointed, the sauce in which my soft momos were swimming, is superbly well balance. Later on I had a chance to explore their Honey Chicken and with Noodles, no doubt about that this odd flavored combo won my heart. They preserved a great specialty in continental dishes. So I will be exploring more of them. 

About the service department, they are very poor at this; they don‚Äôt ask you for a glass of water and take ages to serve your plate. But if you have a good company, then you are saved from dilemma.

Very convenient place for a quick dinner out. Considering that its located in the heart of South Calcutta, that Grub Club sees high footfalls on almost all days in a week comes as no surprise. Try the Italian and Mexican though I know its the Chinese that people visit the joint for. Their menu of the day, displayed above the cash counter is a must try.

Quality is good but sometimes It get worst in don't know why. If you want cheap and quality food them Grub Club is the best for you.

Great joint and very economic. This golpark eatery offers amazing starters apart from the regular chinese food!!! Their spicy honey chicken is our fav which we order it almost every week. Although they get very good number of customers visiting them, still they manage to deliver the food on time to the doorstep. During pujas guests literally overflow!! Good option wen ur cook is on leave or you dnt feel like cooking.

The Grub Club located just at the Gol Park more,Southern Avenue.

Had my exams over today so thought of having some light lunch. :P
The system is prepaid , that means you need to pay first and wait till the servers provide you food.
We ordered chicken fried rice,mixed rice and a chicken & egg chowmien(hakka). We also had boneless chilly chicken. The bill came within Rs. 500/-(including tax).

The order was put to our table pretty fast and the amount of food was really huge. The mixed rice was so nicely prepared with so much of chicken and prawn (also had egg) and the chilly chicken was a bit less chilly :P I tasted the hakka chow as well and it was full of vegetables and chicken. Overall we had very nice meal.

I checked out many items on the menu, I am really going back there soon to try them out.

Enjoy :)

Memories....so many of them associated with this place...

Grub club has been nothing less than a love ... an eternal partner who helped during my days in college, to dates when I was low on cash ,even now when I just want to drop in and grab a bite. One review isn't enough for me to do justice as I have literally tried everything they have to offer currently.

If your looking to have some real good food & go easy on the pocket ,this is definitely THE PLACE.

Menu wise, they have grown a lot, earlier it only used to cater to a specific T.G but now the new additions are real tempting.

The staff are cordial and always willing to help you out.

Water is generally served within a min of you taking your seat & Food is served within a short span only, thus taking away the problem of waiting for a longtime. Since one has to do their billing beforehand and then sit down to enjoy your meal, it takes away the hazard of ordering & then getting to know that your food isn't available.

Now coming to the food:: 
I would recommend-
1: Momos (Steamed /Fried/Pan Fried) 
The layering is subtle thus one doesn't have to chew too much before you dig into their well stuffed momos, coming to the fried & pan fried the sauce even though on the spicy end is mouth watering and definitely not to forget the hot soup served along with their momos are real nice. Even though the broth isn't thick its always served very warm with greens & carrot slices.

2:  Veg/Non-veg combo pack::

This is a super hit among the office goers. 
You get an option to go for either rice or noodles along with half plate of either chilli chicken or chilli paneer for both variants. 
The rice served is of good quality and the amount is quite filling . The Noodles has a good amount of veggie toppings and a thick gravy.
The chilling chicken provided in the non-veg variant will serve you two pieces with a lot of gravy and don't go attacking it as its going to be pretty spicy. In the veg pack its the same  just that you will be served chilli paneer.

The crowd is very urban as its mostly college-goers & young office goers, so one will always find the place lively and the food will surely fill up your tummy in all the right ways and your pocket pinch will be real light.

to be continued...

Two hungry and depressed souls decided to hit Grub Club tonight around 8.30 pm after a bout of review reading marathon on Zomato. They decided on eating light, with moderate amounts of carb and protein. So, at first, being nice, they ordered a plate of red hot chicken (125/-) and two chicken won ton soups (65/-). The system here is to pay for your food first, and then wait at the table with the slip facing up on the table, so that the servers can check and get the orders for you. 

We sat down on and waited for our food. The other soul at my table pointed out a popular Bengali Television personality sitting and waiting patiently for her food to come. I told her that I had spotted someone way more famous eating here the last time I visited. Quietly giggling, we looked around at the crowd. This place draws crowd from every segment of the society... Four kids came in, clearly out of towners, and pointed their DSLRs at a single plate of steamed momo they had ordered.

Our food took 10 minutes to come. The soups came in first. Springy won tons immersed in a lovely broth and a few thin slices of carrots and greens - it was perfect to warm us through. The chicken followed - eight pieces of soft thigh meat cooked with a good bit of chillies and soy.. perfectly seasoned for us. We had a little fight over the last piece of chicken, which the other hungry soul tried to lift off while I wasn't looking. 

We were still not happy, so ordered a plate of Fried Chicken Momos (70/-) which came within 5 minutes of order. The 5 momos we got were fried to a crisp, with a thin, crisp outer shell, and a soft chicken-laden filling within. It was served with a gorgeous tomato-based chilli sauce which was HOT and very tasty, and a bowl of clear, but tasty stock flavored with a bit of chopped spring onions. We fought over the fifth momo and ended the fork-war by neatly cutting it in half. Our total damage, for the two of us, was 345/- .

A place where I used to go since my college days. Loads of memories that I have over there. A pocket friendly restaurant it is in the heart of Golp[ark. I remember having hogged endless plates of momos and fried rice. Probably the first and only place that could make me fall in love with Gravy noodles. Lately the quality has gone down a bit, they should work on that. Service would a little more good. Apart from that it is an amazing place where one would want to visit again and again.

This restaurant simply surprised me. I had preconceived notions about this place and it pleasantly impressed me. My friends took me here for great Chinese food, and I thought it would be usual. But the food here is finger licking. We had spicy lamb as a started with a chicken chowmein and another Chinese chicken main dish (blame my memory cant remember the name) and the food was one of the best Chinese in the city, The lamb was tender and spicy, tasted great. They also have a variety of ice creams. The restaurant is a non a.c one so can be a pain in the summers but a boon during the winters. The staff are courteous and the service, very fast. Its a great place for a quick snack or even a full meal. So do try :)

This is place for the College Goers. The decor, the ambiance, the crowd - everything is young and chirpy. If you are looking for a quite and private lunch this is certainly not the place!
I am a regular of this restaurant for past 13 - 14 years. Things that stand out in Grub Club - its location and food. 
It is a very good place for an extended Adda session with friends over a vast array of food on the menu. You can smell the food being cooked in the kitchen!!
Pros:
- Good Food 
- Good for home delivery and pick up. 
- Affordable
Cons
- This is not for the sophisticated junta
- At times you will find hygiene questionable
- every time you have to order something, you will have to go to the cash counter to pay and order
- Service is a bit of a question.

A favourite of mine since my early college days...I am still a regular here. Wonder why I have never written about this place before. During my college days this place was more like the extended college canteen where you could enjoy a sumptuous meal for two for as little as 100 bucks. This no frills place, pay and eat joint serves some delicious Chinese and tibetan food. The momos are awesome - you could choose from steam, fried or pan fried.The chilli chicken is just perfect and the crispy conjee lamb has a lot of colours - worth a try. They also have a set menu - opt for the thai red curry and rice which comes for 130 or so. 

They also added Italian and Indian to their menu and I must say that the lazania is extremely good. 

The place promises a very relaxing atmosphere but sometimes its a bit difficult to find a table during late afternoons and early evenings. 

Always tempted to walk in for a quick bite  every time I pass by!

Grub Club has always been the eating joint next door that I always jumped in to treat my friends, order home delivery to spice up boring home cooked bong food or just to spend sometime out with an old acquaintance. I always preferred this place for snacks and tit bits. Don't remember visiting this place for a full three course meal. My recent visit occurred when one of my friend cum colleague dropped into Kolkata from Australia and wanted to spend an afternoon with me. We ordered Hakka veg noodles with gravy chilly potato. The noodles were standard but the chilly potato was funny. There small whole potatoes lightly fried on the outside in cooked in soya sauce and green chillies topped for flavor, something similar to chilli chicken. This was unique l as what I had expected was French fried potatoes served in a light gravy to go with the hakka noodles.
 I had also ordered chicken drumsticks and spring rolls. I have also relished the spring rolls of this place. The drumstick was also substantial and tasty. Why most people hopped in this place was may be because of its low cost in a place like Golpark. Earlier, I remember that when I was in school, Grub Club used to be a very ordinarily dressed open air kind of eatery that was flocked by students and not so high paid workers .Now they have decorated and modified the place to give it a clean and tidy look. The pasta counter was added to give an extra zing. The ice creams served are a must try with fruits, wafers, crushes, nuts toppled with 2-3 scoops of ice creams in various fruity flavors. Many of these sundae type ice creams are priced very high on other joints. 
The service is fast and food is served in sumptuous quantities. The ambience is chirpy and one can understand that this is one of the hotspots of gossip mongers. :):):)

Well  went  to  the  Grub  Club  on  the   3rd  of  January...met  some  friends  for    the  lunch.  Had  heard  lots  of  good  things about  this restaurant.  However  was  a  bit  disappointed   with   the  food  on  my  visit ...we  had all ordered   chop suey  as  some  of  my  friends  wanted  to   taste  it  for  the  first  time  ...what was  offered  was not at  all authentic ... some   noodles  which resembled  fries  more  than   noodles  and  the  gravy   used  in   gravy  noodles  along  with  a   roasted  egg...the  food didn't  taste   bad   but  was  quite  light  and  some  of  us  had  to   order  mixed  chow mein   to satisfy the  growling  stomach  ...the  noodles  again  was   quite  okayish ,  nothing  special  or  great!   Probably  we  had  selected  the  wrong  food   from  the  wrong  place ,  maybe  other  items  would  have  been   much  better...anyway  would   probably  visit  again  some  other  time  and  order    other  items  in  their  menu  ,  which  have  been  recommended  here!

Been to The Grub Club with my friends recently...what a waste of money!!!! served possibly the worst chopsuey...couldn't even eat it. It not looks like a club. Its worse than a dhaba. Even the dessert section is not that good. Serving is carries at a snail pace. All I was disgusted..left the place disheartened..

I last ate in grub club about one and a half years ago when I was dating a girl from that area. The place is non-ac but the price is not very high either. The place is bustling with college kids and it is a fun activity to watch whatever is going on about. 

Coming to the food, I have always liked their chicken lasagna and their Chicken Alfredo. Their pasta in white sauce is also very good. Of course I am talking about Kolkata Italian here but I liked it whenever I had it. 

The Chinese food is good in terms of the chilli chicken (which I end up ordering everywhere i go) but the chicken hakka noodles (another common order) is a tad too oily for my palette.

I would end by saying that you may visit the place if you want to have a huge amnount of food in low budget with friends who are equally ravenous. The non-ac is a problem in winters though.

Situated in a garage converted into a joint every school and college going adores and worships...Its again a place that has come close to my heart. 
    As many of my friends i didn't go on my first date there...but my last day in school, my first crush's birthday,umpteen number of friends' birthday and friendship days,after movie hangout...all was commonly entertained at this place. And i can voice up with maximum Calcatians The Grub Club for us like second home.
     The Mixed Hakka chowmein is my all time favorite . It tinkles the right taste buds every time..... I love their Chili Chicken dry which is chillicious for me...but all time favorite are their pan fried momos and fish balls....In a nut shell without AC, Without Toilet...this place is still the Best Chinese for me...merely because it fits every teenagers pocket..and compared to that the taste is uberlicious.

One of the restaurants from my childhood days.  From a smaller joint serving nice Thukpas, Momo's and spicy Honey chicken, they now offer a 'variety'.   Their ' Italian' section was pretty passable to satisfy sudden cravings for White-sauce laden meat. Today I ordered a Mexican fried rice and Chicken alfredo for lunch.  The food was atrocious.The mexican fried rice was lumpy and  had clots of tomato sauce. While another portion of the same fried rice had clots of Oregano seasoning . It lacked salt too!!  The  chef I guess did  not bother to mix the herbs and 'MEXICAN' DOES NOT MEAN HUGE DOLLOPS OF TOMATO SAUCE MIXED WITH RICE.   It also means chillie which was not there. Next, comes Alfredo, which had no cheese!! The gravy smelt of uncooked white wine and again no garlic.   The chicken was hard to chew. Now  many may argue that  One cannot expect passable  Indian-italian in 130 bucks. But   I have eaten better chicken alfredo in grub-club itself. The chef is a newby and cannot even maneuver the  spatula well. I am disappointed. The restaurant is doing business only because of its location. Otherwise there are better joints like Hungry tide ( for Italian and chinese) in the vicinity itself. Expect Basic CHILLLIEEEEEEE CHICKEN bangali style and Riiiiiiiceeeeeee.  Dont go for anything else.

At Golpark, Grub club can easily boast of having almost every kind of food that a street joint can have. With limited sitting facility, grub club serves a variety of Chicken, Lamb, prawn and pork preparations that are pocket friendly.
The ambience didn't look all that hygienic, but we sat through and ordered anyway.
 
We ordered,  Chilli Chicken(dry), jumbo prawns and Oyster Lamb.
It arrived in 15 minutes, the chilli Chicken had  pieces of medium sized chicken in tossed in a soya based sauce and chopped green pepper, a bit spicy but very nice flavour.
Next was the lamb, the lamb was pasture fresh as it was soft...clad in oyster sauce and hot. The combination bowled me over and i ended up having the largest portion of the lot.
Finally, the prawns, the jumbo prawns were big, like really big. soft and juicy. The sauce in which it had tossed was yum! 

Altogether a decent experience, in spite of not having a "cleen chit" this place caters some really lip smacking food.

There is bad food. There is worse food. Then there is food that can be considered the worst. 

And even below all that is the food at grub club. 

Saying that the food is abysmal doesn't even explain how bad it actually is. The quality of ingredients are poor, preparation shoddy at best. We actually had to add pepper to the pepper chicken to get it to taste anything like the real thing!
However, the worst "thing" was the choco cold coffee that was ordered. The guy that prepared the coffee was probably some sort of a chem lab assistant. It was just plain inedible and shockingly bad! 

There's really not much to say about the ambiance or  decor as they do not matter in these sort of hangout spots. Unfortunately i have ended up there thrice and would rather starve than visit anymore. There is not a single good thing i can write about this place. Especially at a location that offers you far wider and way way better choices. 

AVOID at all costs.    0/10

I wonder why i have not been to this place. Probably sheer geography. To begin with, i was sick and tired of people telling me... you haven't eaten at grub club? are u mad? so i finally put my foot down and went to eat. only to discover what pleasantly surprised me. In the world where people are making faces at restaurants without a.c. this place was non air conditioned, full, and bustling with people. I love it when a restaurant is No Frills Attached. Come, sit, pay at cash counter, eat, and go. There are many places abroad that do PAY AND EAT and I am quite for the notion. I know of people who discourage such practices. None the less we sat we ordered. and we received the food. The ambiance was very relaxed. i wasn't expecting any great service. it was simple and quick . and i was satisfied . Coming to food Chicken mushroom soup was a tad bit too thick but the base stock was delicious. which made me finish the soup in minutes The chili chicken was perfect. For convenience sake, most restaurant use check breast meat, which become very dry. They used leg meat. The chili chicken was so moist and juicy that i was compelled to order seconds. The lamb congee crispy, was not crisp, but very very flavorful. I have my moneys worth in flavor. We finished with masala LIMCA ( YAI !!!) When coming to places like these... one should not come expecting authentic, service, come with a blank mind, and be pleasantly surprised, like i was. That chili chicken i need to order 10 plates of and eat .. eat some more... and more.... coming back soon.

Situated in a prominent place in Golpark it used to be one of my favourite hangouts in college days mostly for its pocket friendly rates.

It offers a variety of cuisines.Thai,Italian,Chinese.Once they started serving Mughlai too.Dont know if its still on the menu!!
But over the years the quality of food and service has deteriorated.

They should improve on their ambience and hygeine as well.

Among the items which I prefer are 
Momos (specially the Pan fried ones)
Crispy chilly babycorn.
Spicky Chicken wings.
Thukpas.
Schezwan Rice

Once i tried the Nachos which was not at all good.

Overall its an average joint for me in the current scenario!!

I'm a pretty regular to The Grub Club since its inception. However, recently they have redone their menu and have included loads of continental items. They're surprisingly good, except the biriyani. The biriyani is too spiceless for my taste, however health-conscious people on diet might appreciate it. The chinese items are quite good, especially Crispy Chicken and Spicy Chicken Wings. The momo and the soups are good too. All these for a pocket-friendly price makes it a place you'll want to visit again.

This place offers a wide variety of food items at budget rates. Not a great place for culinary delight but offers standard tasty items. Its a favourite place for young couples  visiting the Dhakuria Lakes area for a quick bite. However if you are looking for private dining, this is not the place as the tables are closely packed against each other. Its a very good joint for take away items.

I was first acquainted with this name when the original grub club opened many years back on the central avenue. I spent my childhood around that place and it was a great place for takeaways. Later on the southern avenue branch opened. I went to this place(southern avenue) and was disappointed to see that there is no table service and no one will take your order. You will have to get up and run to the counter every time you want something. I mean this seemed more of a office/school mess than any restaurant. Even the food quality and taste has become poor. The ambiance in this place is very sad because it almost feels like an open air thing. No AC to start with therefore unbearable during the summers clubbed up with the spicy food. This place need serious improvements.

I've been to grub club countless number of times but despite the variety of food available here I mostly order Chicken steamed momo and chicken pan fried momo!
I'd say the momos are pretty average,I'd have said it's great if they would go easy on the onion they add in the momo,,,
the last time I'd been there I noticed they have also added Virgin Mojito in the menu,,,I ordered and wasn't let down.
Total value for money!

One thing which they should work on is their service.
Seeing the waiters you'd feel yes they are gonna take your bill now(they would even check your order)but only after seeing the bill 3-4 times they will notice it and give u the stuff you have ordered!

We also had Scechuan fried rice, and it was tasty, with chilli chicken. It was very tasty. I was very happy with this food. Total paisa wasool. We were asked if we were interested in eating sundea and we said no. But will try if I come here again.

The Grub Club is the sort of place where you get a little bit of everything - the variety of dishes available is surprising. Moreover, since most of them are of the snack variety, it is possible to sample different kinds of food at the same time.

It's slightly difficult to get into most of the time because it's very crowded. However, provided you do get  a table, you can order at the counter and the food will be sent to your table. Most of the items there are good - not brilliant, but good.  Spicy Chicken Wings and the Red Hot Chicken can be recommended, as can the steamed momos. The fried momos are too oily, though. The beverages aren't worth the trouble - sticking to water is best.

Service is variable. When it is crowded, food takes more time to be served. Moreover, this is a no-frills place - simple chairs and tables, sometimes packed a little too close for comfort. However, it's a good place for large groups to meet, since tables can be combined to seat larger numbers of people at one spot.

Good for adda and casual eating. Not a family restaurant. No AC so don't go there on a hot day or night. Used to get very crowded during evening, specially due to young crowds from colleges around. Menu is very elaborate and price is comparatively cheap. These are the reasons for being so popular local joint. Food taste is good but not great.

I used to be a regular at this place when still in school. The reasons were simple. It is located very close to my school which is at a prime location in Kolkata, the place is the epitome for VALUE FOR MONEY, and in school life no one cares about ambiance when the food is cheap. There is no air conditioning, and you need to put your butt on plastic chairs. Also the payment needs to be done during ordering which may prove to be discomforting for many people. However at this price you are bound to be satisfied with the good quality of food. Most of their dishes are really top grade, but don't expect them to be garnished and served in classy plates. I love their American chop-suey. One other thing that makes me go gaga over this place is their menu. Somehow it seems to be never ending to me. Its indeed a big deal for an establishment like this to serve so many cuisines. Recommended if you want a satisfying meal at a cheap price.

Location: Grub Club is located at southern avenue Just near gol park. Serves many cuisines including Chinese and Italian. It is a very favourite spot for Bengalis out there.

It is always busy and crowded.

Discussing the pros and cons now:-

Pros
:
1) large seating area
2) decent service speed
3) serves many cuisines
4) very spacious.
5) food is awesome and delicious.
6) located at prime location

Cons:-
1) have plastic chairs and tables
2) they believe In less investment more returns
3)food quality needs to be improved and ambience need renovation.


Must try:- pasta, lasagna , garlic bread and the usual Chinese dishes.

During college days, I was quite fond of this cheap place as it suits our pocket. For the last three times, I tried Steamed Momo over there and it is a total disappointment. Staffs just dont care and I am sure the owner has the same attitude. Yesterday I have ordered 2 plates of steamed momos (chicken) for takeaway. I was shocked to see the colour of the chicken inside - pinkish. You will know that it is not well cooked. I feel Food Hygiene is a big question in this place and will never ever go back or recommend anyone. Honestly officers from Food Safety and Standards should pay a visit as I see quite a huge number of college students throng that place every evening. It is really appalling to see the attitude and sheer disregard for any service standard  which is a common practice of this place now.

Well, Grub Club is nostalgia for me. Value for money over here will shock you! Hakka Noodles, Fried Rice, Garlic Chicken, Pepper Lamb, Honey Chicken, Crispy Chicken, Lasagne, etc are few among the killers. The price and quantity will keep you awed. 

It is located right at the crossing of Southern Ave. and Golpark, bang opposite to Ram Krishna Mission Inst. of Culture, a refuge for all college & school students, and definitely shoppers at gariahat. 

They cater for personal & official parties. Please, I beg you, do not miss their Ice-creams. The looks might be deceptive. If you are looking for comfort and air-conditioning, do not visit. It is a fact, that the place is not so clean and but highly accessible. Perfect for takeaways. Grub Club is more of a hangout corner.

The Grub Club is a fast-food joint near Golpark. It is a very unimpressive place which looks like it's being housed in a garage. It is a fairly popular place mostly for take-aways, and dine-in facilities are very basic, to put it bluntly.

Don't expect a delightful menu - the taste is nothing exceptional. The only reason it has become popular is because of the location.

This place just shocks you with its sheer value for money. The place is open air and definitely not the place if you are looking for the comfort of airconditioning. It is hugely popular among the school students due to its close proximity to some of the schools in Gariahat. The place is jst 2 mins walk from the Golpark crossing. The quality of food is amazing considering the price and is perfect for takeaways . Donot expect service as there is really nothing called service. The waiters are too casual .

Recommended if you are on a budget and looking for decent food. Perfect for takeaways !!!!

I have been regular at Grub Club ever since my high school days. They used to be a make- shift restaurant in a garage and there was a tree that went through the roof. They have expanded now with three rows of chairs but the place still makes me nostalgic. Mostly because it is still a major hot spot for school and college going population.

First the negative points. This is a not a high end eatery. There is no AC and the tables are a little cramped. The waiters are mostly forgetful and will come and look at your order 5 times before they serve you.

But the food over shadows all the negative points. They serve really good food (both quantity and quality wise) at dirt cheap prices. My favourites include obviously the Momos, Thukpas, Chilli Honey Chicken, Lemon Pepper Chicken, Hakka Noddles, Pot Mushroom Rice, Mixed Schezwan Rice, Burnt Ginger Rice and of course the Red Hot Chicken Wings. They are probably the best Chicken Wings served in this city. I have tried almost all the Chinese dishes that they have on their menu. They are far from being authentic but they are undeniably delicious.

The ambience is a bit cluttered without AC but the quality of food more than makes it up for it. The variety is nice Italian, chinese, indian and mexican whoa!! what more can u ask for :). The quality of food had deteriorated in the middle but it's back to normal now a days.. Try out the Chicken pan fried noodles and the pepper chicken here.. It remains a bit crowded, best order from home and enjoy!!

Firstly if one is expecting to have waiters at every beck n call one should not visit here,service is certainly not their strong point. But if you're looking good food at reasonable prices ,then grub club is your place. It is well situated near the shopping hub of gariahat at one end of southern avenue. Their honey chicken is on thing I always order,along that the pan fried fish n pastas are worth mentioning. Also do check the specials board,because they do have some wonderful specials of the day. It does not have AC,so during the day it can feel a bit stuffy,but with good quality food as such prices one does not finds anything to complain about.

When  I entered the waiters were yelling to each other and the place being non ac the situation was actually catastrophic. The tables were unclean and left over food from previous diners were strewn around.A waiter came in a lethargic manner and asked me "Ki chai" ( It means  what do you need . Well what is happening here ? doesn't the waiter have any etiquette?????!!!! ) Still after managing to get the menu card . I ordered  for some Chinese cuisines - The ordinary things Fish Fry, Chowmein , Fried Rice and  Chicken Manchurian . The food was too oily and unhealthy for me.


DO NOT GO !

The food quality has decreased. They should make it air conditioned now. Plus, must have a decent washroom (there is none).

Grub Club has always been a favourite of mine as well as with everyone at my home because of its variety of tasty Chinese Dishes available at very affordable rates , where we go again and again. The locality is also one of the best in Kolkata and having always stayed near Southern Avenue ( close to the other end of Southern Avenue ), it gives a cozy , homely feeling to me.

Its not exactly a fine dining experience you get here. Its more of a hang-out place for the college-students and more often than not you are sharing table with some of them. Its not air-conditioned, so you have to find a place under the fan during the summer. They don't give you tissues or even water if you don't ask. 

But my! what delicious food they serve, what variety!! and at what price!!! I have tried a lot of things there - momo, thupka, italian, mexican, thai, chinese. All of them were great. Every time I go there I check their special board and every time I find something new and interesting to try. 
 
They have two stall just outside the place where you can get fresh fruit juice and golas (I simply adore their kala khatta). They serve them inside The Grub Club if you order, you just need to pay at different places. What more can someone want?

I love their food no matter what others might say. You get a good quantity of tasty food at reasonable price, what else do you want???!!! This one is situated at the end of southern avenue (golpark side), beside highlights beauty parlour. The food is really nice especially their Momos and Hakka Noodles. The ambience is average but isn't even that bad or dirty so it can easily be given 3 out of 5. The staff are inexperienced but I guess it won't really bother you. 
Overall I love this place and I will rate them 4. To be a little more specific the ratings would be:
Ambience-3

Grub Club is a meeting point of the young people in south Calcutta. Located at Golpark, this place is very close to wonderful places like Rabindra Sarovar, Southern Avenue (the only decent boulevard of Calcutta) and Gariahat (for mad shoppers). Food quality is not that good but people love the chatty ambiance here. On any average day, this place is deserted during the day, but from evening till night, you will have to wait to get a table.

Food: 2.5/5

Not only is this eatery an  ideal place for students to hang out when they are on a budget,this place serves some delicious snacks as well. We usually opt for the momos, thupkas or the non-vegetarian starters and it is the ideal accompaniments to a long session of chatting. The momos might not be the best which is on offer in town but they are quite tasty. The chicken drumsticks are spicy and well coated with a spicy batter. This is a modified and groomed version of the roadside food with arrangements for sitting and good quality food. They sell what we call in Bengali 'mukhorochok' (tasty but not always authentic food items) food and going by the footfall is quite  a popular restaurant with college goers. of course the Italians would be mortified with the fried pasta but then people mostly come here to chat and food is an accompaniment to the chit chat.

This place offers you good food at low price. Ideal place to visit with friends for a low budget lunch. Used to love the chicken white pasta, but unfortunately I found the chicken pieces to be under cooked, a few months back. Even though the quantity is fulfilling, the quality is not the same as it used to be. The chicken roll is really good and I hope its still the same. No matter what, this place always gives me a good feeling. Trust the Chinese items over here. Overall, I ¬†would give it a 3. :)

This is my first review on Zomato. :)

This is the place where i had my very first date with my sweetheart. This is also a place where I may have visited numerous times with family so i may be a tad bit partial to it. :) . But seriously speaking, if you are a college student and are in need of good food, this is a more than nice destination. Bang opposite the Ramkrishna Mission Institute of Culture in Golpark, the place has been around for quite some time and serves mainly Chinese ( which is as good a cuisine you'll get in Kolkata if you want to eat with a minimum pocket pinch ). Also the immediate neighborhood has a dearth of eateries which are affordable as well as qualified, so this may be your only option.

The last time, we had ordered one Vegetable Chowmein Schezwan and the same in Hakka. The dishes were well prepared with the proper amount of oil and fresh chopped vegetables. All in all, a standard dish. But i would advise you to stick to basic items viz. noodles. Ordering items at the upper end of the prices in the menu may not be a good idea as the portion and quality is average, ( plus you don't want to eat something extra fancy while sitting in a place like this. ) Though the food is always a bit late, the waiters are well mannered and decent. The setting and ambiance in that budget is more than nice. 

It's a popular haunt for couples and the dating crowd proven by their presence in large numbers. The Dhakuria lake being near is an unrelated but added advantage for a stroll afterwards. ;) But its a good place to take the family as well. The portions served, being quite large-ish you can obviouly share.  Try out the ice creams if you dare.. :D 

Chakraborty tip : The restroom is around a 100 feet away at the end of a slippery corridor around the back of the building. The experience of heading there for lightening up after a hearty meal is enough to ruin any meal. The washbasin tap may or may not work too.

This place has been a comfort zone right from our high school days, through my university days.a birthday treat or a dine out with friends was only possible in this joint with our pocket money. We still keep visiting the place on regular intervals.
While this is no way a fine dining place(and does not claim to be), it does serve food of reasonably good quality and quantity, mostly for its student clientele, and occasional families looking for a quick bite.It does not serve very authentic Chinese, but its taste nicely suits the indian palate
The spicy chicken wings,(can be really hot), crispy konjee lamb(ditto),pepper chicken,and Szechuan fried rice remain a personal favourite. 
Do visit if you are looking for a good ADDA with your gang, with reasonably good food at pocket friendly prices.(Expect to wait for a while for a table, thogh, this place can be quite crowded)

If you want to eat outside and do not want a hole in your pocket,Grub Club is there for you. Going back 3-4 years Grub Club used to serve great food with considerable quantity. But now both the qualities have diminished. The ambiance and location is good but the food nowadays doesn't live up to the expectation. Well, nevertheless, this place used to be a favorite few years back and thus it deserves a 3 from me !

I used to visit there but now i generally do not. Its a good place for a quick bite. Ambience is dull and mediocre. Service is too slow. Prices are moderate. I like their rolls, momos and crispy chilly baby corn,the biriyani is also well done. Some times the chicken leg pieces are stiff. Staff is rude....only the service is needed to be improve. 

 I would rate  3.0 for THE GRUB CLUB.

The Grub Club is a fast-food joint towards the Gariahat Police Station end of Southern Avenue. It is a very unimpressive place which looks like it's being housed in a garage. It is a fairly popular place mostly for take-aways, and dine-in facilities are very basic, to put it bluntly.

Don't expect a delightful menu - the taste is nothing exceptional, but the quantity is quite good. Stick to the basic fare. One advantage is that since it is a fairly popular restaurant, you will not get stale food. The ingredients are mostly fresh, though their quality is definitely debatable.

Verdict: You should not go here to dine out, but it's okay if you decide to drop in if you're hungry, since it's very cheap and affordable.

Well, this is one of the most pocket-friendly restaurants I have ever been to. And the food is really delicious with respect to the price they charge. I especially liked their Shanghai Chicken and Chicken with mushroom and veg. The quantity is ample.

On the downside, the service is not so good, i'd say. There is a heavy crunch of man-power and you have to keep on asking for extra plates or spoons and forks till the waiters will heed to your needs.

The decor is very vibrant and there's so much activity all around. Quite a busy place which will surely cheer you up.

Recommended for college students.

The Grub Club is one of my favorite fooding destination in the city. It is a low budget restaurant located in one of the most posh areas of the city, and serves great food! I mostly go for the continental dishes that they serve- especially, Chicken Alfredo.

Service is okay, and good thing is that they listen to your feedback! Definitely recommended for the fact that the food is worth the money spent!

This is a very basic restaurant serving indian, chinese, italian -almost all types of foods. Dont expect fine dining here, this restaurant is for a quick bite when you are hungry but in the afternoon and evening this remains jam-packed,mainly with young school-colllege students so sometimes you may have to wait for long.. i went at night so it was not totally filled, service was very quick. i tried chinese items like mixed  fried rice which was very ordinary, chilly chicken, seczwan fish, manchurian prawns-these items were good and fresh....overall the experience was not bad...

Grub Club. I have been visiting this place for over 9 years now! The place is located at golpark. Its inside a fairly big garage of sorts. Love their red interiors! The have tables and chairs along the sides and one very long table at the centre which are for big groups or shared by people.
The place is usually crowded by students of nearby colleges of south calcutta and can get quite noisy at times. However, they do have an ambiance which is not bad.

 They have an italian counter and I was a fan of their chicken alfredo. But on my last visit, I realised that the italian cook has changed. Much to my disappointment, so has  the taste of the chicken alfredo. The herby creamy sauce was more milky and diluted. 

What I ve always loved is their spicy honey chicken! Shredded chicken pieces soaked in honey and stir fried with lots of chilli. It has the right punch and lovely balance of sweet and spicy flavours.  Its best to visit this place on a winter evening and try their momos. Steamed chicken momos served with thick soup! The momos have good portions of stuffing and are quite tasty. Most of their Chinese dishes taste good! 

What is necessary to keep in mind while ordering at these pocket friendly food joints is that, something that is popular and sold daily, like a chilli chicken or a honey chicken. Now, if one orders a satay, even if thats on the menu, it could well be that the satay turns out more like fried chicken strips and without any thai flavours. So if you order wisely, Grub club wont disappoint you.

They have a separate dessert counter and menu. The ice creams are not bad! The sundae's are good! 

Suggestion: Put coils/all outs under tables in winter evenings.

Great food, service could be better. Must visit.

I must have eaten here a hundred times during my college days. Friendly on the pocket but don't expect any decent ambiance (It was somebody's garage after all...and no the owners aren't artsy enough to convert that into some kind of cool) Good for a quick bite or just to catch up on, considering the fact that it's in Gariahat, pretty decent.

This is one place in the Gariahat region, where you can drop in anytime for a quick and reasonably priced bite or for any sort of informal "adda" sessions over hot Chinese food. No A/C, no formal decor, no parking, yet it is one hell of a place to go. Food is good, service okayish. Always full of people, and in winter evenings,it has an unusually warm and cosy ambiance. 
This place has always been a favourite and  always shall be..!

Never went back after i found a fly in my thukpa. They did offer to replace the dish, I had to decline as I was busy gagging (I found the fly halfway through), they didn't bill us for it, but I will always be the girl who ate fly soup. I actually loved this place before since it was pocket friendly and the food was more than decent. Unfortunately I avoid it like the plague now because of that incident. Also they don't have a restroom, which is quiet problematic.

Favourite hangouts are bound to get criticism from its fans...so in lieu of that I have a few pointers to mention. Placing the order is fast enough but waiting for the food in perpetual summer months is taxing. Noodles & Rice dishes are too oily, water is served in filthy glasses...among the pluses the chilli honey chicken is absolutely wonderful and the quantity is pretty good.The items are priced very reasonably and AC is not available. Overall, its a hangout that deserves a second glance.

Nice place, usually hunted down by college goers. This place is non A/C but there are enough tables and fans to keep you cool. The snack items and the starters are really good. I had a plate of momo and it tasted better than most of the places I have tried. But the fish fry was a disappointment. This place needs to improve on hygiene and cleanliness. Overall, a place where you can grab a quick bite at a considerably low price.

after my second visit to this place the one thing that i can conclude is that if u are in a hurry then please don't visit because it will take a minimum 20 minutes to place your order!!
apart from this the food was good rather decent!
i would recommend the dry chilli lamb! its an absolute cracking dish!
the noodles were okay okay types!
the momos are also good!
the ambience well .. err.. not bad .. but the kitchen is almost adjacent to the eating place hence u will get ample smell coming from there!
the place remains crowded most of the time!
and during any festival especially durga puja forget about having a quick meal from here! and also the service gets worse during these time..  and some unmannered waiters can take away your plates while still some food exists to be there!!
overall a quite pocket friendly place to have decent food! and those 3 stars are simply because of the dry chilli lamb otherwise it would have been two stars!!

A hungry stomach and a mood for adda coupled with almost empty pockets,and be sure of Grub Club to satisfy all your cravings. Their Chinese is the best bet,starting from the Spring rolls,to the Spicy Honey Chicken,from the Pan Fried fish to the Chilli Chicken dry. If you are a health food fanatic you wont be disappointed either for Grub Club also has Thukpas and Steam Momos on offer. They also have Italian and Indian on offer but its best avoided. And you can end all of these with desserts if your budget permits of course :) The quantity of the food will also satisfy the greatest of gluttons and you would be sure to leave the place well fed with a satisfied smile plastered to your face.

the service is really bad,and order for delivery in general(saves you the frustration of pointless waiting). the food is pretty decent for the price.its a place where if you go with low expectations and a hungry stomach,you would emerge highly satisfied.

A restaurant with which many memories are attached. Don't even know know how many times I visited this place. Nothing great, but sometimes simple things touch your heart for some special reasons. Ambience is quite college-canteen type and especially in the evening many a times you won't even find a place to sit. A very chirpy and vibrant place and food served here is more than decent at an affordable cost. Worth a visit!

This garage converted into a restaurant is ideal for the classic Bengali 'adda' . Besides being very pocket friendly, the Grub Club exudes genuine warmth which is its USP. The service is not top notch and their
system of paying at the counter before the meal can be rather haphazard during rush hour. The food is first rate with cuisines varying from Indian to Chinese to Italian (can be avoided). I personally prefer the
Chinese food and the Sweet and Sour Chicken is truly scrumptious. The ambience is simple and the Grub Club is a favourite hangout among Kolkata's college goers. An eternal favourite combo among these
collegians : Chicken Roll +Coke for Rs. 35 !

HAD heard a lot about the pasta here,but was utterly disappointed.
The service is irritating,as u have first pay at d cash counter n wait till they place your order & then wait for your order. The dishes they use for serving are not clean enough. 
The only thing adaptable is the price,which is easy on the pocket.

If u r up for some spicy food and juicy gossip and want to feel the vibes of youngistan in south kolkata,den grub club is the place to be. It comes to life every evening when the young crowd flock the place.the constant chirp of people, the occasional shouts of the waiters and above all the crispy chilly shredded chicken and fish fries with mayonaise dip makes for an perfect evening out with ur buddies.
guys when in kolkata u should visit dis place to feel the pulse of the city.The smell of the awesome dishes will definitely pull out your tongues before you even get in.once dere do try the items i just mentioned and do not forget to try the icecreams they make.The way they present the food will make you love the place and the ambience all the more.

Awesome place to give treats to friend(especially if there are a large no of them) without going bankrupt. The ambience goes very well with the crowd that frequents this place.
We were celebrating a friends birthday and the whole restaurant was singing "Happy birthday to you" with us  :-)
  Quality of food is good considering the price. I love Spliced Chicken and Thai Chicken. And surprisingly the Chicken Biriyani served here tastes quite good.

I dunno but I like the taste of the foods served there. Service is bad okay, but one can't expect 5 star treatment at such low expense. In very few restaurants in Kolkata can you have a wholesome meal @ INR 100 or just a bit more than it. All in all, it have a college canteen like environment, so if you are looking for a class restaurant, its not quite the place for you. While if you are a student looking for an occasional eat out, this is just the place for you. x)

I have lost count of how many times I have visited The Grub Club. It is a garage-turned-into-restaurant. It is always a busy place.The crowd consists mostly of college students and it is the perfect place to hang out with friends. The ambiance is in sync with the crowd, so are the prices. It is easy on the pocket, though I must say that they have reduced the quantity! The food is great. I have tried all kinds of chowmein available there and my all time favourite is the Grub Club Special Chowmein. The chowmein is prepared with a variety of vegetables, chicken, prawn, pork and covered with an egg poach.The service is not that good and I would really like that to improve.

i have been a regular visitor to this place for over 2 years now...though the service is not that good, yet the quality of food that they serve at a reasonable rate is demandable...its a very good place for teens to hang out with their friends...a lovely chirpy atmosphere makes it a perfect adda-zone too...
