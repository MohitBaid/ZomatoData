I and one friend of mine went to this place to taste some south Indian food. We ordered one Plain dhosa,one plain uttapam,and; one cola and one lime from the regular drinks section. While the dhosa and uttapam were really good, these drinks were hampering a bit in that taste. But yes it is a kind of pocket friendly place for south Indian foods and@ surely wanna try pizzas of this place.

Green Cafe is one of those clean and pocket friendly cafe which serves good food to hungry students like me üòÅ. It's situated near Ashutosh College. I have tried their Masala Dosa and Cinnamon coffee. Taste of both was good. Dosa was crispy and the sambhar wasn't very runny. Good job Green Cafe ‚ò∫

The staff has the absolutely worst attitude. Their food is overpriced but it has improved taste wise over the time. Do try the sandwiches and cheese dosa.

Located opposite to our college. A all time goer I am. Food is moderate. South Indian food mainly. Price is ok..not sooo pocket friendly though. Twice or thrice in a week is ok.

Nothing extraordinary. Near my college, Asutosh.
Had lunch here today. Chole bhature. It was cold and tasted average. The orange slush was good though. The place is hygienic with minimum decor. You can call it pocket friendly. A major turn off was the power cut we had to face for most our time spent here. Service is fast and staff is friendly and helpful.

Located very near to the Ashutosh college this South Indian joint serves some value for money dishes. 
Got some basic dishes as a part of my delivery. Idly and Sambar bada both were freshly made and served at a quick speed. Enjoyed them with very tasty chatni and sambar along. A perfect place for student in budget and quick snacks as well.

This place is a regular place to visit for me and loads of other people from asutosh college. I have tried the dosa,idli and even the pizza. The squashes are made on the spot,and the machine is right out,for everyone to see how things are being made. They all taste lovely and are at a reasonable price. They do charge VAT and service tax though. For people looking for a casual place to sit and tlk,this is a good place for those staying or being near asutosh college/hazra.
