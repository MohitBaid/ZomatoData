Oh dear!
This is what i didn't expect to be here in zomato. It really took me by surprise. This certainly is very amazing to find A Fuchka wala to be on zomato because he is famous at this particular location. And even people didnt knew about it until i found it today.
Run by Mr. Arvind kumar yadav who is a very friendly guy on the street of shakespeare sarani.Â 
Tried the fuchka and it was good, certainly not the best but indeed nice. The cost he charges in 3 for Rs. 10.
Special thanks to arvindji for offering free fuchka too. :-p
