Am highly satisfied with their donuts..I ordered 4 dark chocolate donuts and they were very tasty and 100% vegetarian too! Must have donuts from here..it's basically a home-based donut shop..for delivery purpose only..it is recommended to order prior to the schedule time so that fresh donuts can be available! Must try donuts for all!! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š

Amazing donuts at extremely cheap prices. A new venture which Kolkata lacked and surprisingly at extremely pocket friendly rates. 
A must try for all donut lovers.

Eggless doughnuts....YES! THEY ARE EGGLESS AND YUMMYLICIOUS!!!Great taste, hygenic packing, fresh flavours and well priced!! (Especially if ordered in large quantities). A healthy substitute to the regular desserts.

What Kolkata lacked was a good donut place. The lack has been fulfilled by this venture. On point taste, perfect ingredients and pretty decent presentation. The marmalade and choco filled donuts are to die for. And guess what?
The prices are such that they don't even give you a slight pinch. All in all a wonderful takeaway joint started in the heart of the city. Definitely worth an addiction!

Try out the Live Chocolate. It's delicious.  Right on time delivery.  Will recommend this takeaway for any kind of party, friends gathering, etc.
