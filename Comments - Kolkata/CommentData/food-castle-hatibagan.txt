First of all hard to find the location. Ambience is average. Service is quiet a good. Ordered tangy tomato pasta and mixed cheese pizza. Pasta was like the one you can find in roadside stalls , though was good. Pizza was just horrible .

The food quality is worst.
Here they serve differnt sizller, once if you eat sizller here you will start hating it.
I am serious. 
They have bad ambience as well.
I would never suggest anyone to come here and waste their money.

It's been more than 3 years since I am visiting this hotel on an almost regular basis (once in 2 months most probably).
I would like to say, this restaurant has declined over the years. They have reduced the number of staff and only increasing the price. The service is very poor.

We had to wait for almost 20 mins. to get our food even when there were only 2 families present at that time (6 people total). They did not serve water also.

So, to sum it up, I would like to say that if you want to visit this restaurant for the first time..go for it..the food is extremely delicious though..but the poor service makes you so annoyed that you will not be able to enjoy it though.

VISIT IT ONE TIME AND SEE YOURSELF. YOU WILL SEE THE CHANGE

The restaurant is pretty bad when you look at it from outside, and you are even more disappointed when you step in as the restaurant is completely vegetarian. The owners don't bother to keep much staff here as the restaurant is mostly empty and the costs have risen in the past few months which has even stopped the college crowd and the students in the nearby PG's to come and have a meal. They prefer Fatso which offers more variety or even Blossom which has somewhat the same price but offer varieties.
However, if you are a vegetarian who wants to stay away from non-veg as much as possible, this is the place for you. The Butter Naan with the Palak Paneer was delicious, and I didn't order much, so I don't have much to say about other items. However, I will pay a visit again in some time to try a few other dishes as you never know what suits your mouth.

This is a very old restaurant situated beside balika sikhasadan school

A veg restaurant to try out.
Taste below average.
Still mixed cheese pizza with paneer graded on top with nuts are good.

To be very honest i have been there almost 3 years ago. Taken by a friend for dinner here. At that time it stayed quite empty and vacant. Location is between Girish park and vivekanand crossing. The outer looks very ordinary. SO it looks when you get in, Decent sitting arrangement (As per that time). There was only one staff who was running the entire resto, Who took the order from us and made the food too. We ordered Panir butter masala as well as Tandoori roti. The much i remember that the food did not met the expectations at that time. But after so long time when i passed this place again, i think there is a second and fresh visit is due.

From entrance it was look like a cheap low grade restaurant but when you see this restaurant from inside it was looking very well. Now come to taste. Their cuisines were very tasty specially their north indian cuisine. Service and staff was also good. Recommended to all north Indian food lover.

Had been a frequent visitor during childhood. The ambience of the place is very average but the quality and taste of food is really nice and pocket friendly. The north Indian food especially the malai kofta is a must try and I feel it is one of the best in the city. Mentioning the name itself makes me crave for it. The sizzlers are also yummy. The staff is polite and friendly.

Well,it was a get together with friends and we had little idea about the place.But the staff was really helpful and polite and helped us to zero down on the menu.We had ordered sizzlers which were very tasty and warm(which we wanted in winters) and babycorn which was just amazing.Whosoever visits the place must try its babycorn
We had also ordered capsicum pizza which was below average.Cost is fine.

I live near this Resto and have been visiting it since forever.

Staff is very polite and the place is very inviting. Though, leaving aside my emotional touch it is high time the Resto is renovated. 

Takeaways might be a much better option but hot food served is a much better value for money.

A person looking for good quality reasonable fooding option in Central Kolkata should definitely visit this place. My favorite is Vegetable Sizzler. They serve it hot and the quality is unmatched. The only place I have had better sizzlers would be specialty sizzler restos like Yokos. Other than this Indian food in general is yummy. Go for the mainstream Paneer and Kofta items along with Naans and Masala Kulchas.

You will come out smiling for sure when you see the bill amount in the end.

It is a very old pure vegetarian restaurant located in Vivekananda road. The place is small and compact and the seating not very updated and not so comfortable either. The staff are nice and warm but i would prefer the place for a home delivery or a  takeaway.

They offer you variety in north indian, chinese, south indian fooding options.  But i would prefer the north indian. The prices of the preparations are pretty cheap but they serve you hot, fresh and hygenic food. The dal and koftas are great. I would say the preparations are a bit different from the mainstream Indian restaurants but they are all likeable more so at such prices.

NIce and fresh food at pretty low prices!! I would say good enough at that price.

Please follow me to read my other reviews.

The only plus point about this place is that there are hardly any eateries around this joint...so people around this area are left with no choice. the north indian does not taste good,cant comment much on other cuisines but im sure you wouldnt like to come back for the 2nd time.
