Very very very bad not even liable to be rated 1
Ver very bad service rude owner and staff
Never go very bad place still regretting waste of time and money
Pathetic place very bad owner and son selfish greedy a place where u would go to waste your money instead have tea at home only
If you want to buy stationary go somewhere else 
Mangalam is a good place 
This kafe 6/2B charges high rates even on a normal pencil This shows their hunger and greed for money They will announce schemes like student discount and all sorts of such rubbish things but do not fall in the trap they will increase the bill by 20 percent and then will apparently give a discount of 10percent
In the whole never visit such a terrible place with horrible people inside

একটি ছোট্ট , আদর্শ , মধ্যবিত্ত কাফে । বসার জায়গা কম হলেও তার মধ্যেই নয়নাভিরাম ডেকোরেশন । ফিস ফ্রাই আর চিকেন মোমো খেয়ে ভালই লেগেছে । মোমোর মান বেশ ভালো ।

This place is really close to my house, and I popped over with my mom one day to try out some cold stuff. It's a small cozy place, with really sweet quaint decor, flowers, and soft pretty colours, and plentiful lighting, and pretty picture windows. Being really small, it ensured personal attention from the lady who helped us select our food. We had a Tutti Frutti ice cream sundae, and a cold coffee. Service was pretty fast and both tasted really good. The prices are pretty affordable, considering the great quality of the stuff we tasted. I'll definitely go back for more. It's perfect for an evening outing with a few friends, or as a me-time excursion. A plus point is the huge range of Paperboat products they have!

Been here today. Located very near to lansdowne paddapukur. The cafe is small with seating arrangements for 10 -12 approx. The decor is minimum but eye soothing. A guitar is available for playin ,if anyone wants too. The choice of music played is quite good. Airconditioning is comfortable. Only one staff is maintaining the cafe along with the owner, and they are nice. Price is affordable with variety of snacks and rolls and parathas. Tried cold coffee and chicken momo, and the momo is yummm...too good. Located very near to my house wud like to go there very soon.
