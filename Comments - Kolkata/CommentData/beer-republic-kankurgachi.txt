Expectation was always high when it's Beer Republic at least a Decent brewery with decent options in beer its all what expected but my first visit at this particular outlet wasn't so  great as they have only tuborg strong to offer!!
Although there was only few food items were available from the food menu which is unfortunate too.
Personally I felt they should take some extra care about customer experience and they needs to improve a lot. Even ambience cant fetch more than 2 stars as compared to Beer Republic outlets in other cities like Bangalore as the place was quite dark and digny. 

Overall it was an ok experience with beer republic,hope it will be better next time.

Not at all courteous staff. You should not recruit them randomly and assign to work. Such people will be the reason for your quality deterioration. And when you open a restaurant or club, you should make sure that they are polite and respectful to your customers. I wouldn't recommend this place to others.

Do you want a place to relax under the stars with fairy lights and drinks on the table? 
Or maybe a place to dance the night away? 
Or how bout a place to just catch-up with friends and play crazy board games? 
Mmmm oh planning a coffee date or a drink or two but what if you can have the best of both worlds (oh four actually)..
Do I even have to get started on the delecta food and drinks? 
Just visit the place already!! 
And experience ..... the beer republic  I recommend by every one

The alcohol was great.... We tried their four varieties of beer which was provided with samples to taste from and choose. They were Amber beer, blonde beer, republic beer and brunette beer. We ordered a mug each and got a mug free of the kind as we had visited during the happy hours.
Malt whiskey was also ordered which was good again.
On the food part, the food isn't that great... We tried beer batter chicken nuggets which were overdone with the frying and tasted bland. 
The crispy baby corn was fair enough. 
For the main course we ordered farmhouse chicken pizza which was average. The base of the pizza was tad sweet which didn't go down well with me. 
Chilli chicken gravy was good. We also ordered veg fried rice and veg noodles which were again average in preparation.
The ambience was good. A DJ played good music. Overall the experience was good.

Worst experience ever. Crassy place. Waitors are worse than dhaba servers. I guess the dhaba walas are more welcoming. We ordered Cottage cheese steak which was like a lump of paneer put in the shape of a ball and they added the sauce from the top. Mostly i just ate salted paneer with no flavor or anything not even grilled a little. it calls itself beer republic but beer was not even frizzy. We finished our food and beers and ran out from their, without even trying the hookah for which we chose the place. What if they just gave us coal with no flavor, so not wasting money on that. Definitely a no recommendation.

Wen it comes to booze and hookah..i would surely like to pay a second visit here...
We ordered Republic beer tower..got one free..the beer was good..less strong..but had its own charm..
The paan flavoured hookah in normal base was awesome..tangy refreshing flavour..
The chicken nuggets were good..served a tad bit late though..
The hot garlic chicken was good..so was the schezwan chicken but honestly my taste buds failed to make much difference between the two..
The farmhouse pizza was too good..the crust was thin and the toppings were great..
The chicken fried noodles were average..
Overall an economical place to chill out.

Went on Friday evening. Tasted their home brewed beer collection, though small, they were good. Coffee flavor was unique. The staff was courteous and Mr. Shaukat Ali who took care of us, was very special. The food was good. Above all liked the music. Was a welcome change from routine Hindi and Punjabi mixes that I get to hear in Delhi / NCR. The music was contemporary English hits and the DJ did a good job. Trendy friendly and decent crowd made the place even more attractive. See you guys again !

Really nasty place with waiters who don't know manners, chefs who lie to cover up their bad cooking n very unprofessional atmosphere. I don't think I will ever go back to this joint.
The only reason this place is thriving is the lack of any competition nearby or maybe it is as bad as it's competitors.
Choose wisely my friend!

Been here a couple of times, and as far as the experience in this place goes not too many choices in the craft beer they don't really make anything else other than the 4 on menu. The beer is okay not too great not that bad either. But the food is really suspect here, doesn't deserve the price tag that it comes with.
Really hope they change the Pitchers(jugs) they serve beer in, a good beer deserves a good pitcher. 
Music could be a little better too. 
Only would recomend steping in if you are waiting for your movie to start or if you have no other choice of hanging out, the beer kind of saves the place(being craft and all that that is)

This place is ok, ya...just ok. Can't say that it is impressive, nor it is disappointing. 
They serve only mild beer from their brewery, though other options are available. Beer is again good, because they have several options along with flavoured beer which is little out of the box but that does not necessarily add on to enhance your experience. To visit once to booze and hookah is quite a going idea but taste of their beer is average.
Food is overpriced.

Visited this place this Saturday (02/09/2017) with my old buddies! We didn't understand their rule as for some they had this cover charge thing, for others, none. Bit confusing! Ok, first thing, they don't provide a pukka bill for the hukkah! I mean like really?! What for? They just wrote 885 on my bill and when I asked for a pukka bill, the stuff just declined it and went to serve others! I paid via a card and he took away the bill saying that he needs to present it to the counter. I mean where on earth do u see such things?! Please Beer Republic authority, explain me this! The pool table was never available. We could not have a single game. Bt the ambience, da food ( though quite, n i mean it, QUITE over-priced) , n beer were good! Oh, n beware, once u step outside, the police are standing n may just ask for a alcohol check while u r driving out. I had to camouflage myselfÔøΩ U can hangout bt still it will pinch u.

This place is located right next to the Swabhumi Inox entrance , and has a grand door that makes you feel like you're entering some wonderland! However , the interiors look like a regular pub , with lounge seats in the middle , and an area to the right that has pub tables and bar stools. The futuristic looking beer towers serve their signature brewed beer , which tastes very bland and light. For starters/sides , the schezuan chicken tastes good, and is served with salad. The shisha is served to the table, brain freezer being a personal favourite, but they don't allow you to smoke tobacco, for which they have a separate area. The staff here are courteous, and the service is adequately attentive. The music is a tad too loud for easy conversation. The ambience of this place , however , makes it a must visit for all beer lovers in the city !

Yesterday visited this place with couple of friends. We paid Rs.4000 as cover charge (which was strange) and then we order beer. The place has happy hours till 9PM, we reached at 8:55 PM and quickly ordered a couple of tower to get the benefit of Happy Hours. But to our horror, the waiter told us the we have finish our tower before 9:30 PM orelse they will clear the remaining beer. So now that we had already order 2 towers and we got 2 free, we had to finish all the 4 tower in next 30 mins. We went there to chill after a hectic day at work but we had to drink under the pressure as we had to finish the towers before 9:30 PM.

Beer lover's paradise.

If you are a beer lover then in all probability you would love this place and the love will ooze out more if you are present during the happy hours. Pay for one tower and get the other one for free. Applicable on other items as well (T&C applied).

I tried a couple of flavours -¬†

¬†‚Ä¢ Blondee - I loved this one. Seemed like scottish ale. Light and smooth.¬†

¬†‚Ä¢ Brunette - Coffee based beer, black in colour and has a different zest to it.

It was a great experience visiting this place and experiencing the music and the great beer varieties this place had to offer. I went with a couple of friends a few days back, and I totally loved the Amber beer which I had for the first time. Thankfully, happy hours were going on, hence it was great on getting an extra mug of Amber Beer. Service was smooth, plus great ambiance. Will come back for more. A huge thanks to the staff and management team.

I went there with 2 of my male friends on Wednesday. We were offered 2 packages on entry one is cover charge of ‚Çπ1000, another is unlimited drinks for ‚Çπ1200 (it's mandatory to take either on Wednesdays). For ladies the drinks are offered free of cost on Wednesdays. We were there from 9pm to 1am.

The crowd starts coming around 10pm. The bar counter got so much crowded that you can't even go near the counter after 10:30pm.They told that the Scotch is over after 11pm. The ambiance is just awesome though I was feeling cold for the first few hours because of the AC. The music was loud even before the dj entered the house. We had ordered crispy baby corn and chicken popcorn. The food tastes good especially the crispy baby corn. I felt the hookah was a bit pricey. They had given cheeselings as accompaniment with drinks. If you want to have freshly brewed beer they will give 4 samples to taste first. The service was overall good but not prompt. The dance floor is of good size. Dj starts playing hit dance numbers from 11pm onwards. The smoking room is too small.

I love going to this place. It's because it serves quite a variety of beers. & They're quite different from Ur day to day beers. The ambience is nice too. Moreover, happy hours make the place a must go for beer lovers. I really like their brunette beer . It's got a coffee aftertaste. Quite unusual yet nice. The food was good too. Hope they serve more varieties of beer next time I give it a visit .

Well there are very few places where brewed beer is being served in Kolkata. This is one of those places, ambience I won't say it's great but as per the prices they charge it is fair enough. The beer they offer is good but not that great. And this place is cheap so it's good on your pocket.

Some of the waiters are not courteous enough.They came and stood beside us listening to our talkings and letting go  the privacy.. They came and informed us that we might have to share our place with other customers and finally after some time they informed us that happy hours are coming to an end and so we should leave the place..All these happened when me and my fianc√© were there on a lazy sunday evening and were doing chit chat over glass of drinks,some eateries nd almst average music..

The waiters need to be taught to behave. None of the  brands of beer mentioned in their menu were unavailable other than Kingfisher. In house brewed beers not upto the mark. Good interiors is the only positive i could find.

This is located just next to Inox Swabhumi. An easy to locate, well decorated bar and dining place- I quite liked it. We had to wait for a while to get the table. We ordered Whisky sour, Hookah (Brain freezer and Summer 69), Chicken popcorn and Beer. I loved the chicken popcorn and Hookah. Drinks were okay. Whisky-people would love the Whisky Sour drink. There's a small smoking area available. Service was a bit slow. We went at about 12.30 pm and totally took advantage of the Happy hours offer.

But the chef was right there on the floor when his kitchen was serving shitty fried chicken tikka and fish finger. Service was good gourab was great appreciate his attentiveness... over all my 1st rule don't drink and drive take a uber or ola applies it was happy hour and enjoyed 1 on 1.

I find this place the best for late night party. DJ is good, music is loud and clear enough, big enough dance floor, lots of place to sit, if you wanna stay away from crowd, u have an option to sit upstairs, you get brewed beer here, food is good. Ok, you may have to wait for the waiters, that is acceptable considering the crowd.

There is not much option for brewed beer in Kolkata , and this place out of others is good. We visited on a Saturday evening. It was more or less  filled up but got a couch for ourselves rather than those high bar stools. Ambience was nice, dim lights, good music and beer towers and hookah smoke all around. 

Coming to the beer, we ordered the republic beer, it had a sweet, malty flavour and was pretty good for a change from regular beer, then we tried the brunette beer which was dark iin colour with strong wheatish flavour. Lastly we went for the blonde beer which was very light and lacked the punch. All this was part of their happy hours which buy 1 get 1, so we basically paid half of the total bill amount. We ordered Dry chilli chicken and pan fried fish which were okay. 

However , the pathetic thing is the service here,. U just need to grab hold of any waiter to order as there is no specific waiters assigned to tables and neither are the waiters interested in taking orders as if they are living in their own world. Also, with time going by, the music gets louder and louder and one needs shout at the top of their voice to get heard across the table. So it become irritating for us and Also, if u enter after 7pm , you need to pay a cover charge of 1000rs per head.

Bouncers' behavior is horrible. They are not aware of their duty. They should be trained properly how to behave with the customer.
If Someone from a group is talking with any person from another group, that doesn't mean some kind of chaos is going on. ¬†Bouncer should not interfere there if nothing is going on.
Also staff is not so much cooperative.

Just under swabhumi the place is must visit for any boozer.You have to pay 750 per persn at the entrance which will be cut from your overall bill.  The ambience is fantastic. The have happy hours where they have offer of 1:1 on some of the drinks.. we took a pitcher which was supposed to be in the offer n they said it contained double the amount.. but it didnt seem like that. Nevertheless the food was tasty . But the service wasnt up to the mark. We had to vall for waiters many times before the actually came. The price was reasonable.

I was there last Friday aid friends. Having heard of this brewery from many people my expectation was set high. Let's cut it short we not only myself didn't like this place neither felt satisfied with their service and interiors. The table was not clean and had lots of permanent spots signifying repeated usage with no maintenance. The glass they served had crack, and worst was the way the waiter was responding, as if it was his last day at work. Beer was good and one o one offer made drink quite budget friendly, but food was pathetic, not only by taste but by quantity and decoration too. Overall not met expectation. Good for drinking brewed beer only and nothing else.

Located near swabhumi and inox cinema hall, this is a place with the ambience of a long forgotten bar and a decent music playback. 
They serve draught beer which as per my colleagues is a must try. They often have buy one get one free offers so check them out before you order.
The staff is courteous and well behaved.
The food is UTTERLY DISAPPOINTING. Just drink, and leave. 
One good thing is that they have a smoking zone so non smokers like me can breathe in peacefully.

Ok so here's the much awaited review of beer republic. One great Sunday sudden plan ended up in beer republic. Look of it is really impressive from inside. Huge beer barrels which prepares their own beer. Though we had to wait at least for 20 minutes as it had a huge rush. They were having happy hours. So we ordered 2 litres of beer and got 4 litres. We ordered schezwan chicken and dry chilli chicken. Blonde beer and a strong royal paan seesha suggested by them. So coming down to food it had very less quantity. Taste was good though, chicken was well cooked however the portions were really small. Seesha got burnt very quickly, we changed coal. Second coal hardly lasted for 10 minutes which was a sad part. Then the service of this kinda place is very sad, we had to call at least 4/5 times for each thing. Seating and location wise its a plush place, only few setbacks I'm sure they can surely work on.

India vs Pakistan final match and what could be the best place to enjoy it!!
Loud music,loud ambience made up for the traumatic  defeat to the arch rivals.
We being a group of 8, upon entering were told to wait for 30 mins..however a sweet lady maybe the manager came and somehow managed a big table for us within 10 mins for which we are ever thankful.
The happy hours was the bonus for which we ordered 1litre of Beer republic beer and got extra 1litre free.
The beer republic beer was just too good.
Among food we had..chicken popcorn,kadhai chicken pizza ,chicken demerol, chicken steak.
The food was good no doubt however a little small in amount.
Planning to visit again to taste the next beer and all!!

It is paining to even give a 1 rating to this place. I went there today evening and returned from the gate itself. Let me explain why..
Earlier I had tried the beer here (long time ago) and really liked it and wanted to take my brother there. So few of us went there and at the gate there was this lady and there was this middle-aged man trying to get entry. And he had the nerve to wear SLIPPERS?!!!( I MEAN HOW COULD HE WEAR SLIPPERS? Is that something a human should wear???? Where IS the FASHION police?? How infuriating is it that a brewery is trying to dictate what u wear?)
The desk lady rudely informed him that 'slippers are not allowed here'. However, the lady somehow became all forgiving and miraculously let him get a stag entry (He should thank his stars for Beer Republic's benevolence; allowing him inside with his wretched 'slippers'!).

Seeing this unfold in front of me I realized how lucky I was, that what I wore was approved by Beer Republic!!.
However, I could not stomach how the person in front of me was treated, I definitely didn't want to spend my money in an elitist brewery!
Whatever respect I had for your restaurant and brewery is completely lost. I will never go there again and neither will I recommend it to anyone! How dare you try to dictate another person's attire?Let me make something clear to you people at Beer Republic: You should have stuck to being a brewery! Fashion policing is not your jurisdiction!

This place is located just beside Swabhumi Inox. The location is good easy to locate. I visited this place yesterday and it was full packed. It was a Sunday and we had to wait for 10mins to get a table.

Coming to what I ordered I went for Dry Chilli Chicken, Dry Szchuan Chicken, Crispy Chilli Baby Corn, Pan flavoured Hookah and Beer. All the starters tasted fine.
The quantity was enough for us. The Hookah was really good. It was strong and it lasted long. The Hookah will surely give you a hit. The best part about the place is that they have Happy Hours till 9 pm this offer is on even on weekends which enables you to get Beer at a low price. I'm not a Beer person but their Royal Gold Beer was really good.

Coming to the ambience it was crowded on Sunday. And they have a big Screen were India vs South Africa cricket match was on. After the match the Dj came and he played some groovey English Songs.

The service was good. They served our orders on time. We didn't have to wait long. Just because it was crowded the servers were having some problem while taking the order but it's fine.

All in all a cool place to hangout with friends. They even have a smoking place and a dance floor. Best place to go for a night out.

Hope to visit it again!

Beer republic, at Swabhumi Inox premises is one of the brewery found in Kolkata. Located near the Eastern Metropolitan bypass makes it quite a viable place for weekend visits. Sunday was surely a great place to be there, good food and good beer. Though the food quality should be improved abit, We had ordered a pasta champignons in white sauce and hakka Noddles with chilli Chicken. The pasta was great but the Chinese food didn't reach it's mark. Table service was good regarding the high footfall. Best thing was that we had ample amount of beer and India vs South Africa Champions Trophy 2017 was been screened live. The mood got us all right regardless the carelessness in the bill.
P.S.: HUGE IMPROVEMENT IN THE STAFF BEHAVIOUR THAN BEFORE, kudos for that.

We both didn't like the environment - as we are not fond of drinks and hookah - it seems like a Bar ! There is a smoking area inside it..
The staff is co operative..
It was the first time I was trying the  Beer - both the hookah and beer went waste !
We had half of the chakana :P and the starter - it was really good (I didn't remember the name though).. I really like the presentation and the taste :)

How is it possible that they often give wrong bills ?
Gave wrong bill on all 3 occasions I went there.
Once they wrote an amount with pen instead of printing.
Another time 4 tables complained of wrong bills.

No wonder this place is so low rated. The worst management and service I have seen. This is my 3rd visit. First and 2nd time was okay but the food served was too spicy. They changed it later on. But I was surprised with my 3rd visit. When I entered they made me buy a voucher of Rs 500 per head which will be adjusted during the bill.By this way they are mandating the minimum bill. If i just want to have beer then I cant.I had to order something to utilize the total amount. They even stamped a VIP mark on my hand (dont know what was the purpose). When i went upstair they were forcing me to share a table. It was absurd as I was not gone to any dhaba or road side stall that I have to share table.
At this point I cant even leave as I have already paid 1000 for 2. Then somehow I managed a high table for us at the ground floor.
The DJ seemed like a dead corpse is playing some tracks which was more like noise pollution rather than foot tapping music.
We ordered tandoori which for a change tasted good but the waiter didnt even bother to give us plates, forget about serving.
And if you r planning to visit then be ready to come out with lighter pockets as the food and drinks are too costly with such poor quality of food and service.

Beer republic has it's own micro brewery and is served in glasses and towers - and the beer is really worth a visit to the place! The finger snacks to go witj the drinks are reasonable - and in evening from 6-9pm they have a happy hour 1:1 offer on selected drinks and cocktails. We went on a wednesday evening which is a ladies' evening after 9 - offering few brands of complimentary drinks for ladies! The place appeared to be quite happening with a hip crowd, and the music was matching the mood! Overall a good place for a chilled night out and their home brewed beer a must try!

The worst place i have ever been in my life. I visited this sunday with a friend during ipl in the evening time.. We ordered for sangria by the glass and one starter along with one pasta and a ceser salad. And we packed a pasta too.. But when the bill came to me it was 5,788. Initially i was a bit shocked but i was a bit confused so i paid the whole amount in card... Then there after we left the place my friend realised that the billing is totally wrong and overrated at wine section. We went and talked to the manager he argued with us and dinyed the fact.when we showed them the bill it was actuely near about 4000,, after a along argument they paid us back 1200rs... And did not produce me a fresh bill against that. When i checkd the prices again in zomato here! I found according to the billing plus few extra amount i have added on my own, then also there is a lack of round about 550 rs.. Which was a total loss to us... I feel really shame and disappointed with such pathetic service to the customer... From such known place.. They are absolutely cheat people... I genuinly suggest to all the visitor there please check twice you bill before paying the amount... And i wont ever suggest to visit the place to anyone... Neither its a good place nor a good crowd nor a good loyal service.. Thanks

Was asked to leave because I was wearing a shorts on hot Sunday evening, interestingly the dude so busy arguing with me and my wife, that he ignored the other customers, walking in the same dress code as I was.

Lovely place to drop in....
Great ambience..
Awesome place to hang out with friends..
Good Dj.
It even features in Party place..
The crowd is good.
Even the staff members are very  efficient..

The name suggests it  all. The place is famous for its beer.
But according to me their brewed beers can be better.
Overall, I had a great experience here with beer and starters..
Will surly visit again.

One of the lowest rated place from my side. Will never ever visit this place again. Starting with the staffs and their behavior...if they comes to know that you are a first timer here, you will have to pay the cover charges which covers old monk rum and teachers whiskey...who drinks old monk in a microbrewery? Bartenders will serve you as if people serve beggars food...immediately they will take the money charged for your drinks. 
Now come to the ambience less said the better !!! 
Mostly pick up girls and they get a separate reserved section where the owner or might be the manager himself helping them with their drinks and lots...

Ruined my evening and moved on to the grid later that night...

For a pub or a microbrewery grid or Irish house or even country roads is much much better with great food and courteous staffs...

Quite sound and friendly ambiance. Nice quality of  food and beverages. Cost is moderate and lies between the expensive and cheap line of cost. Carry id proof(21yrs) if you want to taste their beer as earlier the age restriction was not there but bow due to some new rules its a necessity now. Overall a good place to hangout with friends.

Just went yesterday to have a party with my roommates. Found it too crowded and just thought to leave that place as we were not finding sitting space. After 20 mins of wait found sitting place in front of DJ. Had tasted the 4 special beer with chicken stuff. Service found very poor... Overall a good place for spending time.

This place  is heaven for beer lovers.
Average for hookah lover & below average for people who need hospitality and good service.
We visited  on a Wednesday evening, we ordered Beer , Hookah and Babycorn. Beer was quite good but inspite of ordering a dense smoked and strong  hookah they gave us medium strength and low smoked hookah. Babycorn was good but the service was awful. The waiters seems to have been least bothered about our order, I found them not interested in their  work. We had to call them 5-6 times every single  time. Thumbs up for Beer lover. Otherwise an average Place.

We visited Beer Republic on a Monday evening to celebrate a friend's birthday. I was just 6 of us, and we chatted away with food and beer. It was around 11pm we thought of calling it a night and asked the waiters to get us the bill.

While we were paying and infact just about to enter the pin for the credit card, suddenly 4-5 bouncers cane along abd started to shout at us to hurry up and leave?!? I mean we are already paying money and standing up to leave, why behave like this. On being asked what was the reason to push us at only 11.15 when already we are paying and have no intention to stay longer they started misbehaving and talking very very rudely. That told us that the normal procedure?!?!

I think being in the hospitality business you need to learn manners first. Bouncers are kept to tackle drunk visitors or to keep the people on the dance floor in check. Not to ask every customer to leave as soon ad they finish food. We didn't dance, or shout, but merit to ourselves in a corner, having birthday cake n beer.

Their beers are nice, but food isn't good. Every item, nachos, tandoori, kabab, pizza was bland and lacked seasoning. Needs to improve a lot.

I would have rated you better, but after this behaviour I think better of it. I have made it a point not to recommend Beer Republic to any friends or fellow foodies!

If you are looking for a nightout, drink & groove on the dance floor this is the place! Last time I visited with my bunch of out towner friends it was a blast having a chance to party on 'wakhra swag'  coming live from 'navv inder'! Good place overall but with limited sitting area! Dark beer in barrel gives you a smooth high, a must have!

The food here is sheer amazing.. You definitely need to try their pizza as well.. Its top notch.. The brewed beer is light bodied and doesn't get you to choke.. Service is good overall and attention to detail is near perfect. The hookah here gets full marks for the time  it lasts.. More importantly the best part is the happy hours if you are in a bit of a pinch during happy hours you get 1:1 on alcohol (select). A perfect place to booze.. The decor is great and the lighting is easy on the eyes.. If u need to take a selfie u really would need your front flash..

Situated right at the ground floor of Swabhumi mall, this is the perfect place for brewed beer lovers. The pocket pinch for the place is also relatively low. The collection of beer is amazing and when the happy hours is going on...This is just the perfect place to be if you wanna have a great time with your friends. The only drawback that has come across me is the smoke room, it is too small and needs some space. Other than this, beer republic is the best pub to visit in a limited pocket pinch.

Beer Republic being one of the first Micro-Breweries in our City and Eastern India region surely is a very big thing firstly. As a guest , the beer is really good with the offers that are turned out on everyday on the week making it very pocket friendly too for the youth and for everyone else too. Having a diverse Menu in food , there are a lot of really tasty foods available and which I would suggest everyone of you to try which are Golden Fried Prawns , Fish Amritsari , Fish & Chips , Mashed Potato in Sautee Vegetables , Grilled Steak or Chicken and a lot more. With an great ambience around the place also have a Gaming & Pool section , it becomes even a more favourite pastime spot with some good friends. If you haven't tried it yet and if you're a Beer Lover & a music follower , then you're surely missing out on something near you. 

Best Wishes Team Beer Republic.

This watering hole is where 89 cinema's used to be. Best things about this place is the happy hour timings nd the dry chilli chicken. The beer collection is nice but nothing great. The music is good too. The interior is spacious with some seating areas which are too damn dark. Some seats have the loudspeakers right above them so that's another pain . but if you are looking for some good times with a gang of friends this is a place worth giving a shot.

I asked to taste the different kind of beer to make further order. Staff told that they do not have clean small glasses at that moment. Come'on who is gonna buy this excuse. Anyways moving forward, we have ordered republic beer on waiter's suggestion. They gave happy hour till 9 pm, took the opportunity and order 3lt+3lt. In the beginning the taste seems to be awkward. But after  glass it seemed smoother. It does not gives an instant kick, it will sooth your nerves slowly. 

Enjoyed the drink, more than the food and the ambiance.
If you are a beer lover, this place is economically well suited for you despite of the ambiance.

Nice place. Worth a visit. Good food. Decent service. A bit overpriced but there are very few options for fresh brewery in the city. Sooo..
Word of advice : it's a place where you go in a group.. party and hv fun with frnds ... Not where u wanna go after work have a pint or two and retire for the day
Beer : 4 star (wheat beer is good and light and refreshing)
Ambience : 4 star
Food : 1 star.
For kebab platter they have whole potatoes; something in paneer and 3 pieces of oily green peas smudge !! For chilly mushrooms they have under cooked.. over spicy raw pieces of mushroom served with green chutney. And this is the best.. for Onion rings they have round shaped onion pakodas.. !! With tomato sauce. !! 
#hope the non veg menu is better..

The smoking room is too small and you've to struggle to find some space. Only thing that's good about this place is their beer, which tastes really good. And also there's a BOGO offer on drinks.

Not at a Beer Lover, But since its Opening wanted to visit and test Fresh Beer from Kolkata's First Microbrewery. Their Republic Beer and blondee beers are good as per my test. Rs. 350 for a 500ml of Glass is quite reasonable.

Liked their Chicken Malai Kebab - Soft, well cooked and succulent. over all Indian food is good. didn't tried anything else, so can not comment.

Ambiance - Is different

Music - DJ Leone surely take a bow. 

i was looked after well. so, will visit again

Beer Republic is located just beside Swabhumi inox. So after movie just jump in for some drinks at a good price coz they have amazing happy hours going on the whole day almost. Their house brewed beer is a steal during the happy hours. The amber and republic beer are premium smooth lagers. The ambiance too pulled off great with loud music and low lights. Perfect for a weekend party with your gang!!

Beer republic is a known bat cum restaurant near swabhoomi, although it is a known pub, there are many things they should consider to earn a good name, recalling my visit on 31st December they really seem to be zero on there management, i can understand the date of visit was not a day to be considered for review as almost all restaurants / bars are occupied, but still the management has a big role to play and earn popularity even in that situation, at first the reciption guy said that they have available tables and charged us for entry but after entry it was found that all tables were reserved upon raising the concern to the same person he initially didn't show Any interest and found an escape, we waited for him for almost 20 min standing without any info and then they same guy agreed to refund the amount he charged, I question was not about the money but it's a concern of the management of the pub to avail right information to the customers, cos when it comes to business they must follow some protocols. Badly disappointed and finally we moved out in search of other place‚Äã. Big NO to beer republic in future.

It's a good place to visit with friends for grabbing a quick beer or two.The crafted beers are wonderful but let me inform you that they are very light. You have to drink more than a litre to feel anything. The waiters are not so friendly but far from being rude, as some people have suggested. The food was also above average and it's not too costly.

Happy hours(1+1) are added advantage(almost throughout the day+everyday)..execellent food quality, great shishas.. and lastly good super fast service...

Located just near the Inox Swabhumi Box Office, this place is easy to spot.
I visited this place in a late afternoon on a weekday, the place was mostly empty with only a couple of tables occupied.
The ambience is good and quite with light music in the background.
Had ordered the following -
A Teen-Paan hookah which was smooth and good,
A glass of in-house beer which was also good and felt smooth,
And a plate of crispy babycorn, now here's where the things went wrong. The babycorn was too spicy for any normal person to have, so much so that I had to ask the staff for alteration.
The staff was cooperative enough to "re-cook" the left over platter with tomato ketchup and serve it a fresh.
Coming to the pricing, the outlet is moderately priced in-line with the other such outlets in the city.
Overall the place can be visited once just to have a taste of something new, else there's nothing much in it to look forward to.

Whenever I return back to this city..This is a must visit place for me :) The food is average..I visited with friends most of the time and tried Chicken Nuggets mostly...Pretty regular food..but the beer is the most catchy part of this place. The Amber and Blonde you can always try (it won't taste like beer and you wont be high so ladies out there you can try). Hookah is below avarege.
Atmosphere: Pretty awesome. Location is a bit far from South Calcutta but keeping in mind the Ola and Uber services this city has, it's almost nearby for people like me from Santoshpur Jadavpur. 
The music quality is not that great. DJ is good if you visit after 6o clock. The services are good. 2000-2500 for two people will be enough. But you always can visit in happy hours and try beers only to keep your pocket warm.

Happy Hours will make you happy : ) Easy for Pocket.
Beer Quality was High Average.
Parking facility Great.
Toilet Slightly better than Roadside Public Toilet.
Food Ok. Just took starters.
Smoking Zone to be avoided. You would wanna Quit Smoking if you go there twice.
Ambience Shady. Quite crowded even on a Weekday, seems popular due to Happy Hours.
If you're okay with Hukka Smokers you would be okay, I personally can't tolerate that smoke.
Air Conditioning was slightly above requirement, need a light jacket or cover if you wanna stay longer.
People go in crowds, don't expect Royal service, but the service was okay!

Coming to food, ordered Chicken Skewers on the grill and Chicken Farm House pizza with extra cheese. The chicken skewers was very tasty loaded with flavours. Loved it. The food n ambience was over all good. Coming to the service, it was very poor. Waited nearly 45mins for a single dish. They really need to check on this. Can't rate them more considering this aspect.

I was very much interested in the drought beer they make. In terms of taste of beer it was good. And they have cool happy hours offers, could be the best place to treat friends.
Ambience is pretty decent, music is nice. 
Ordered crispy chicken and pasta was really average.

My favourite place! Go there very often. In The happy hours especially. My favourite is beer republic beer and dry chilli chicken. Though the place is usually crowded on Saturday snf Sunday evening, still the best way to hangout.

A huge place with number of sections. They also have tables with tandoon on it. All the things here seems overpriced. The food is not as good as expected. The hookah was fine too.

Have been there today. Nice place to grab a drink n moreover they serve 1:1 on all drinks. Loved the decoration and the place. Had their Republic Beer which was reaaaaaal good n had Teachers too. Coming to food, ordered Chicken Skewers on the grill and Chicken Farm House pizza with extra cheese. The chicken skewers was very tasty loaded with flavours. Loved it. The food n ambience was over all good. Coming to the service, it was very poor. Waited nearly 45mins for a single dish. They really need to check on this. Can't rate them more considering this aspect.

A nice pub near Swabhumi. This place is great because of its pocket friendly drinks menu. A happy hour that lasts till 9 pm, makes it a must go place for any beer lover.
They have an in house brewery and have 4 gourmet draught beers which are very very economical.

I was there with my fiance and a friend and I tried out their Blondee and Amber draught beers . The food is tasty too with my favourites being the Chicken Garlic Pepper . The Hookah is good too but I have had better.

All in all a good place to Party on a budget.

Decor and Ambience is good, but is a but dark. Not complaining as it is quite common with most of the pubs in the city.

It pains me to give this restaurant even a 1 rating, Zomato, can you please come up with something lower?¬†

I went to this place on a weekday night as my friend insisted he wanted to try brewed beer, I used to study in Bangalore and its safe to say I have had my fair share of brewed beers. My friend handed over the responsibility of ordering to me as he considered himself a layman in this matter. I ended up ordering the blonde, which is typically a wheat beer and is a light beer compared to other ones.

What came, cannot even be termed a beer in my opinion, it was basically water, with added flavor. When we notified the staff of this after taking a sip, the reply came this is how the beer is. After more hassling, they got us beer in taster glasses, which had bubbliness to it but it didn't change the fact that what was served to us was not bubbly at all. Then came another manager, trying to teach us what beer is again. Finally, another manager came and tried to explain how wheat beer is a lighter one and hence contained less bubbliness, now the issue with this is, I agree the beer is light, but light in terms of bitterness not in terms of bubbliness.¬†

Horrible experience first with the beer, which I really think was water mixed with flavour and with the staff who will not agree that the thing they served isn't beer. Never, ever will I go to this restaurant again, and I caution you as well to not visit the place.

Oh boy it's worth a go during the happy hours , actually it will make you happy , the place is superb , the music is good , over all the ambience is worth a go. Now coming to the food , the food was good , they provide a lot of cuisines ( which is the best part), choose the one you like , now coming to the drinks , the way the cocktails were presented was perfectly balanced taste wise and look wise. And overall the bill didn't pinch my pocket.

Really shocked to see such poor and improper management who have a shoe criteria for admission into the bar . The previous time i went with the same "non admissible for no reason " slippers was really disappointed with the DJ,he doesn't listen at all to any audience requests . Also ,I don't know if every group of boys are criminals that those people think we would create ruckus after having a beer and not if a girl is present with us ,what kind of logic is that ??!!! Well just because you people have a certain power of rights of admission into the bar doesnt mean you leave your brains and humanity at home and non judiciously rudely turn away your customers . I was in doubt if that woman,the so called manager and other people were really part of the management team . If so and it is unfortunately, humanity and evolution have a long way to go ....

I called them up using the number provided in google to know if they are open that night and came to know the number given in there was a wrong one and the guy was way more disturbed about this for a long tym  than i was about to be that very night and he was planning on suing them. We went in around 6 o clock and sat on one of their dirty tables,we ordered 3litres of the blondie . It tasted great but 2hours and 6litres beer later we had no effect on our senses so obviusly the beer dint have alcohol.by that tym our friends arrived outside the pub after ending their shift at the hospital,2 of them werent wearing shoes and were just wearing sandals because giving labour room duty in shoes is really tough. Suddenly we heard the most ridiculous rule in the world,they do not allow ppl widout shoes!!!! I mean wat is this?? Is this wat humanity has come to?? U will serve ppl based on wat they are using to cover their feet?? On asking why and where the rule was written,they werent able to give us any proper answer. There was this obnoxiously rude little lady who is probably the owner's daughter which i can deduce since noone else wud have hired her to be the public manager or watever she said her post is. Anyways, we asked her that we wanna talk to the manager,she told us widout evn checking wid the manager that the manager has no time for ppl lyk us. Then we learnt another ridiculous rule: they wont allow groups in aftr 8 o clock if there are no women in the group. Another group of ppl were also not allowed to enter,as we started talking abt their bad services the bouncers started to threaten us to leave their premises. So we paid the bill and left widout another word and headed to opium for some real alcohol. Now i know u guys can decide whether u shud serve us or not but i have some thing to say. My two friends whom you dint let enter coz they had no shoes on are 10 times the human being you and your bouncers ever will be. Not because they are doctors and are 10times cerebrally superior than the public manager of a pub that sells cheap beer,but because if the same ppl that kicked us out were sick and went to the hospital even in your worst apparels,we would still treat you and try our very best to serve you ,thats why we are 10 tyms the human beings you ever will be.

I like beer,  specially ale, stout and porter,  so we decided to drop in at Beer Republic. 
Sunday night,  DJ was playing some english numbers from the Y2k period. The beer we ordered was brunette,  which is the dark one. Apparently it was happy hours till 9 and we ordered a tower. 
Well from the taste of it,  it felt as if they had filled half the tower with the real stuff,  and put another tower of water in that to make it look like one plus one. Absolutely no effect on your senses even after being two towers down. 
Food was equally bad. Fish fingers were too salty, beer battered chicken was like vegetable chops with peanuts. I only found the tangdi kebab to be decent. 
These guys have  a dim lit place,  hookahs,  which could have set the mood right,  but for every other thing wrong there, it fails. 
Even the smoking zone is an area under the stairs, with hardly any space for 4ppl. Ppl actually wait for turns so that they can go in. 
Overall a very dismal experience.

Located right beside 89 cinemas box office counter,,  am not sure y i didn't like the place. The food didn't taste good. The Chinese we ordered had too much of Indian spice in it. The Italian had same Indian masalas in it. You might just go for the freshly brewed beer, which is the only thing i liked. The whole place seemed very dead to me. May be the timing was wrong, when no music playing etc, but all this does matter

The outlook of the place is really good, but once you enter, it falls apart. The tables are really dirty. The food, although tastes good, is very costly. They brew their own beer, and that is the only usp of this place per se. The beer is pretty good. The orange flavored hookah we had was pretty light. So, in my verdict, a one time visit place.

Locating this place was fairly easy. As my first visit experience it was good. I had been here for a Launch Party of a Clothing Brand named - Kollab Lifestyle. Tried few drinks which were really fresh and felt very much hygienic. The one thing I will remember this place for its quality of the drinks. One thing I didn't like is the Dance Floor which is really small. There is No Slab in the Gent's Toilet. The washroom should be renovated. A bit hassle faced because the Card Swiping Machine wasn't working. Overall, it was a good experience.

On a lazy Sunday evening I visited this place with high expectations as I heard about it a lot. Quirky interiors and fresh vibrant music made up for one lovely atmosphere. It was too crowded so had to wait for some time to get a table. We ordered for 1 Pitcher of Amber beer and 1 mug of Republic Beer. The happy hours were on so we got the 1:1 offer.  Well they disappointed me a lot over food because tandoor items were unavailable so only a few options were left. Sadly, we ordered Dry Chilli Chicken. The food was average nothing extraordinary. The place is fair enough to chill at especially with friends on weekends with beer.

The place being at a convenient location right beside swabhumi is spacious with am electrifying ambience. I went on a weekday and didn't find the DJ entertaining enough playing mostly english tracks. The dance floor is small although available with lasers. The food is standard but the food delivery service is too late. Good place to enjoy the brewed beer of the place but nothing else. Yes u can have cosy comfortable seating and enjoy the drinks with some music. The place has the amenities to be better than what it is now.

I have been regular to Beer Republic for the past few months,the ambience is good and the DJ's play good music.It is famous for its freshly brewed beer which is really good I have tried all the four types but the best is the republican beer other drinks are also reasonably priced in comparison to other pubs , now coming to the food I have tried their pizza's which are average but their indian tandoori items such as the tangri kabab are good.The only room for improvement for them is in their fooding department.

The brewery on my list for a long time! They serve hookah and allow smoking while sitting in your respective tables! We opted for a tower beer and two plates of chilli chicken! The prices are extremely high! For a group of 8, you can imagine the bill amount.
                    

We visited the place for the second time. The outlet was roaring with amazing ambience, good music, and a good crowd. We also happened to visit the brewery, and learn a little or two about how their beers are brewed. Their four main variants - Blondie, Amber, Brunette, Republic. Republic and Blondie were my personal favorites. The chicken pizza that was served with it, was also loaded with chicken and cheese. Loved it more on our second visit!

Went on a saturday evening, it was a school group kind of reunion. Just right to the entry gate, was our seats... Awaful place to sit though.( the view was blocked )
Anyway, we went in during the happy hours, which indeed made us happy..:-p Not a big beer lover myself, our group of 5 ordered Amber Beer and then Republic beer. Initial impression, not that great...but my my! We were in for a tasty surprise. We loved the Amber beer....It was just too good to drink. You won't feel anything, n then boom, you are in the right mood..Keep drinking...U won't puke or anything. Belive me, that mood was too good to have.
Food was okish, music was good, beer was the best. But the dance floor is too small..

Bring down the prices and you will have more of us. :-)

Heard a lot about this place ... but was utterly disappointed... crafted beer was OK though tasted a bit watery ... may be the happy hour effect.. fish finger was decent..... but the worst part was the pizza ... it's not even up to the mark of a Home made pizza .... the pizza was prepared in a readymade pizza bread ... was expecting something freshly baked in a wooden pizza oven ... may be I was expecting something way more from a microbrewery in Kolkata...

Had heard a lot about this place and had huge expectations. Went for the last Jamsteady night, finally. It is necessary to mention that I am a regular attendee at Jamsteady and do visit many of the performances all alone, because we go there for the music and not the company of friends. Got to know that the band won't be able to perform for some technical issues, therefore stayed back for some food (was literally hungry). Most of the tables were booked so the waiter requested me to seat by the bar. I told him that more than booze I want food. The waiter went ahead and had a word with two guys occupying a table, they agreed to let me share the table. Till now the waiter was friendly and helpful. Now I got myself settled the table and slowly begun to talk with the other two guys of the table. They offered me to share their draught beer as they won't be able to finish it. I requested for a glass to that waiter. This is the point his body language changes. He was eyeing me constantly with a disgusting look. I ordered for kebabs and he said only a few chinese items are available. I settled for hot garlic chicken. The entire time I was talking with those guys at my table, the waiter kept his eyes fixed on me as if: how can she share drinks with strangers (or maybe why isn't she ordering another draught of beer, which is none of his business). I went to the smoking areas with the guys at my table and on returning I asked for my cheque. The waiter brought it and almost leaning on to me he said that he just ran to the streets to catch a person who was leaving without paying. Firstly, why is this information relevant? Just because I was sharing beer with strangers, does that make me a frawd who won't pay her bills? And even if I agree that he had no such thing on his mind, why did he have to lean on me to pass the information? Yes, the music was loud, but I was talking to the guys across the table, therefore that excuse doesn't hold. Does being nice to the decent strangers make me available?

Kindly employ educated people who know how to mind their own business. Not these judgemental, moral policing morons.

P.S.: The beer was good, and the hot garlic chicken was pathetic.

Place is good to chill with friends, beer are really nice but the worst part is service. Waiters are really rude. Paid entry cover charge 2k for 3 of us but waited almost Half hr for table. No one is intrested to allot table finally we found a table and requested the waiter to clean it. Please tell your staff member to respect customers as we paid for the items you are not giving them for free.

Disappointed with the beers at beer republic,on a Sunday night when you are expected to have a huge crowd u guys run out of beer,Breezer,and many branded whisky.
Even the service was pathetic, slow, careless.
It took them half an hour to change a hookah coal.
Prices are on a higher side & no happy hourszüò•
Not visiting again in near future.

You guys promoted a Beer republic card 2months back and its still not active, seems like it was developed with an intention of fooling public.

I've been really looking forward to microbreweries making an entrance in Kolkata, and this was my first chance to visit one. I tried all four of their beers, and all were tasty. It's great to have an alternative to mass-produced beers! But one complaint is that all four beers were somewhat flat. They haven't quite figured out how to put the bubbles in the beer. All four beers had a somewhat narrow flavor profile. This was a good and a bad thing. It meant that they are quite drinkable for people who aren't used to flavorful beers. I don't usually choose wheat beers if I have an alternative but I liked theirs because it was a little less sweet and intense than a typical wheat beer. I'd love to see them make some more flavorful beers in the future. An IPA would be nice.

They come for Rs 500+ tax and have a plethora of options to choose from.
Try the campari too. Red bull comes for Rs 250+ tax and is worth the try. Amazing ambience!

5 o clock on a Saturday evening. This place was packed. We were given a table next to the stage - cramped and no privacy. However, soon the upper floor section opened up and we shifted upstairs. I didn't like the decor or ambience. The seating area upstairs were mostly occupied by couples. Very comfortable sofas, you can relax for a long time. The music was terrible till the dj arrived and played a lot of old english numbers.It was our first time here, so we didn't know that the 1:1 offer wasn't available on bottled beers. We chose the amber beer on tasting the 4 beers they make over there. Their microbrewery is visible behind the bar. So, we ordered 2l od amber beer, a farmhouse chicken pizza and a chicken burger. The food was served cold. The pizza was okay. The burger decent. Fries served with the burger were cold and not good. We ordered another litre of beer later. If you're looking to have beer for the taste, amber beer is great. But, if you want to get drunk, i'll suggest choose some of the stronger drinks. The 1:1 offer is available on other drinks. The happy hours is on till 9pm so gives you a lot of time to order drinks. On the whole, the entire outing turned out to be pricey. Don't think I'll visit again.

They serve a dark coloured coffee flavored beer. I didn't like it but could be worth a try for some others

I would say a good one. They can improve. Specially the staffs. We 4 people entered and there was not a single person to ask us for the table. I then had to call a staff and then they arranged a table.
Except that the beer was good. We order a CCBC and a garlic bread which was good. Hookah was decent.

The place gives you a pub kind of feeling. The decor is good too.

As far as beer is concerned, it's cheap. We got 1+1 free for happy hours. It tastes okayish.

A humongous disappointment. My friend and I had returned to Kolkata after nearly 2 years and were very excited to visit our hometown's first brewery! What a let down...
1. Lacklustre performance by the servers. They had to be prompted to give us a sampler of all. Generally the breweries I have been to in Bangalore suggest the samplers nonetheless. 
2. Nothing was available. Excuses of odd timing didn't fly because I have been to breweries where availability is key. The servers seemed to be actually happy and relieved that 90% of the stuff was unavailable.
Now let's come to the beer. They served watered brewed beer. I mean...who in their right minds would water down brewed beer!!? Have drunk enough to realize my drink is watered.
The samplers were ok...because they were not watered. Good for business but bad when it comes to inculcating the brew culture here in Kolkata.

Final review? Lot to learn...you still have Beer Republic. The bestest of lucks.

Ambience - just decent

Food - overpriced . Just tried a non veg pizza which was thick crust an average one.
Drinks are highly priced . Happy hours lessen the pocket pinch to a great extent. The house beer pitcher Brunette came black in colour with coffee flavour was likeable.

Service : horrible. Worst in recent times. Two of us entered the almost empty place and sat on couch for four. The stewards repeatedly came and asked to shift to a normal table chair setup even after telling them that we had movie time in next 20 mins and ample of four seating was available. The staff seemed uneducated with no knowledge on courtesy and professionalism.

The rating stands only for the happy hours.

Conveniently located beside Swabhumi & diagonally opposite to Hyatt Residency this Pub is one among the few micro breweries active in the city,the decor of the place could have been a lot better,on entering the place it resembles a typical bar of Kolkata with a counter in the front & maroon sofas,the lounge feel & look is missed,the good part of the menu is the inhouse crafted beers reasonably priced,try out the Beer Republic special or Wheat,the happy hours offers one on one for all drinks,the food is just ok and the food menu does not excite,this place is a one time experience for me.

Today's was my fourth visit to the place and initially I had pretty much liked everything about it. But today I took a few friends along with me. The food was terrible. They gave us bland, stale, stone cold pizza to eat. The staff out there is rude. They refused to acknowledge that we disliked the food. When we spoke to the manager, he too refused to replace our pizza. And we had to pay for it even though we sent it back. Both the staff and manager are indifferent. There were guests who were smoking in the open even though there's a dedicated smoking area and the staff was indifferent about it even after we asked them to take care of it. The beer was good though and the chicken Caesar salad was okay.
So today was a bad experience all together. I'm very very disappointed. Would think twice before visiting the place again.

One evening I decided to get out of South Kolkata and try this micro brewery. Unfortunately, is wasn't prepared for the beer republic experience. All the beers tasted like crap. Not to mention they were watered down. Anyone who likes the beer here, clearly hasn't ever seen the inside of an airplane.
The white seats had vomit deposits. Onion rings tasted like pakoras from a cheap liquor bar. The lesser said about the ambience, the better. Needless to say, its better avoided.

Beauty lies in the eyes of the Beer Holder, says a sign right at the entrance... And it is spot on... The ambience is par excellence and it is no rocket science why this place is brimming with youngsters... This place can boast of incredible happy hour offers (12-9) where drinks come at exactly half the rates... Hookah(off the menu, at hugely discounted rates) is an added attraction... Not to forget the music... 
Coming to the beer, being one of the original micro breweries in town, you are guaranteed a fresh and different taste... The Amber and the Republic Draught varieties are great and in the happy hours you can get a couple of litres for 650 which is as cheap as it can get... 
But it would be unfair to just comment on only the beer as the food items, whichever we tried, were brilliant... Be it the Tangri Kababs, the Dry Chilli Chickens or the Pan Fried Fishes... The Pizzas were outstanding too, especially the Kadai Chicken Pizza... 
This place is 500 metres from my home, and it is a pity that this is the first time I actually visited this place... Definitely going back very soon.... A must visit...

I went with my father because he wanted to try their BEER.

Huge space like how the disco's have or even bigger. Service is very novice.¬†
We were poorly welcomed and seated. So we sat and were offered with the MENU. No one offered water. We asked about their BEER and were offered the tasting platter. ¬†

After tasting we decided to order the Brunette and Republic (two of the 4 beers they offer). ¬†The Beer was not bad. Good part of it is that it's fresh.

The food was pathetic. We ordered a Fish Starter and Hot Garlic Chicken (both had the same color and more or less same gravy), it was sweet. Then we order Egg Friend Rice and Chili Chicken Gravy. Very less quantity of Rice and Chili Chicken was just edible.¬†

WE DID NOT ENJOY. ¬†The only good thing was the huge space and the concept and to some extent the BEER.¬†

I did not find the worth of our money.

One of the best pina colada I have ever tasted in Kolkata. Got 1:1 Offer on weekday eve which was a good deal. We entered at 10pm and the place was quite crowded and had a bit difficulty to get a table on weekday too. The crowd was decent, good music  (mostly Bollywood though), nice environment, not so big dance floor. Service should be little better. For food we ordered non veg kebab platter & dahi kebab which tasted good but quantity was less comparing the price. Although price is slightly on higher side, this place is good for pubbing near Saltlake.

The beer tastes refreshing and loved it, just could do it with a little bit of crispness in the beer. Food and ambiance is nice too. For guys, sometimes you need to be accompanied by a lady to get the entry. Many times we went there when there was no lady in our group, but they happily allowed us (with couples cover charge , but that's redeemable inside, so we don't mind). Last night we were denied, the door bitch was absolutely cold in replying that it depends on them when (I repeatedly asked, is there any day in week when stags are not allowed) they would allow entries when not (Its okay when you deny entry for stags, but you should be a little more warm, otherwise you could lose customers). This added a little sour taste in mouth.

Well I'm a straight edge guy so I went for the following items:

All the items were really good except for the salad which was disappointing.

For food,we ordered four different chicken preparation and no doubt it was amazing,but the tandoor items were not upto the mark.
Ambiance is moderate with good music.
The only problem was with the staff, not active at all.

Had been to Beer Republic today, wanted to visit this place for a long time, not that I am a chronic alcoholic but it was just an attraction being the first brewery of Kolkata as I hear. Easy to locate beside the enterence of Inox Swabhumi.
Its dimly lit inside, large space,not very courteous employees, always let set it aside, being Bhai-phota today. I was giving a treat to my sisters. We did get to taste all the four premium beer of theirs and choose the 1st on the menu (sorry forgot the name)  we were in the happy hour so we got 1+1 on the beer a Bacardi Apple Buri was told that Bacardi Apple was not up to the mark in its taste (a regular consumer would know the taste). We also ordered a mocktail which was good. The other things that we ordered were chilli crispy fries which was pathetic,they were soft and no sign of crispiness, the other order was Farmhouse chicken pizza, now this was awesome, after a long time I had such good pizza. Thumbs up to that. Overall experience was average. Bit heavy on the pockets for daily or weekly visit. Once a while is gr8.

Mixed with a smoky and coffee flavor in the brunette beer was mind blowing and i  tasted amber beer specifically "amber sex on the beach"  also tested Republic beer which was also very good to hv with beer batter chicken nugates is fantastic. But they take time to serve the food item. Happy hour made us to have buy 1 and get 1 offer.  So please go within the happy hour.

i like this place a lot ... so it became our personal fvrt hanging out zone. But some days  before when me and my 2 frnds went there the behavior of the waiters stunned us ... cz they were pretty rude ... and was not paying attention to what we ordered .. so i have a suggestion to the management that try to scrutinize ur employees behavior and service.

The place has quite a mood-setting look and feel with low lit sitting areas and cool music. Since my friends and I are complete teetotallers, we tried their Chilli Chicken Pizza and a chocolaty mock-tail. The food was okay, nothing hyped about. The mocktail was just not worth the money! I guess their variations are a bit limited and the prices seemed a bit exorbitant.
Nice place for people to hang around.

This place is bustling with you college crowd. It has. A huge area which can house a lot of people at one time. Beer they brew is good. But staffs are little lost , they have less idea about their food and least interested to serve.

Very rude and non supportive staff. I had a few Nearby coupons and had invited a couple of my senior colleagues. However the waiter first refused to accept the valid vouchers. Only after I made him read the T & Cs he accepted the same. Was a total loss of face for me ad felt humiliated in front of the guests. After food was served he forgot to provide plates and continued his non chalant demeanour. This despite the fact we placed orders other than those mentioned in the vouchers.

This treatment stands in sharp contrast to places like
TGIF where customers are made to feel special. Although food quality is superb the staff attitude is pathetically callous.

To top it all I had left my power bank and when O called them next day they took 3 hrs to inform that it could not be found. Although I don't blame them for this.

Very bad experience...
1.poor customer service.
2. No communication between their staffs
3. Rude behaviour
went @ 7.15pm & got table upstairs ..before asking for anythng the staff asked us we have to vacate the seat before 8 pm as they have party reservation..seriously??? You are letting people in and asking them to leave after a certain time??? Is this called customer handling??? We told the staff there that we were told to go upstairs from the ground floor then rudely get replied that "may b he does not know but you have to vacate the table @8"..Sorry to say your staffs lack communication between them as well as manners. . .
Then we went downstairs and no body acutally cared and asked us to take a seat upstairs and will see what happens after 8..!!!! Hats off guys.!!
Never goin again..!!!

I am not at all a beer person.... no.... but .... hey ... ermmm...... I liked this place... and I liked the beer as well.
I was rather coaxed into this place by a friend who seemed to be a fan of the beers churned out of their microbrewery.
The interiors are large ,simple, well lit with comfortable seats . So the ambience gets a 5/5 from me.
The service was prompt...and after tasting the small pegs of their beers... we went for a tower of Republic  and Brunette... both were great.
The chicken farm pizza was good.
It's nice that they have a smoking area... though I really wish they make it a bit larger.
A nice place to chill out!

Well this place is no doubt a happening one. The offers are good. The food is reasonable and beer is also mind blowing. But what spoils everything is the hospitality of the staff. Each and every staff over there are rude and impolite. You have to call them 3-4 times if you have to place a new order. The people working there are busy watching TV instead of keeping a watch on the customers as to what they want. This place would have been a success but what saddens me is how the blue collar people are spoiling the whole image. In my case I would not even visit the place again even if the place offers a 100% Discount. And it's not only me who they are rude to. Most of the people visiting there have the same problem. Lack of hospitality !

Beer republic is located right next to swabhumi and 89 cinemas. So if one goes to watch movies they can after that go to this place to chill. All kind of drinks hookah and continental chinese foods are available. I stay nearby and frequently visit the place. The ambience is very good and outside the bar their is a place where people can sit and click photos. This is almost my 8 to 9 th visit to this place ! Today we visited for a school buddies get together party !! We made the prior reservations for Drinks n Dinner !! Antiquity Blue, Blender's Pride , Smirnoff , Bacardi Rum and Freshly brewed Beer were served as per our requirements ! Two Non Veg Starter and Two Veg Starter was quiet appropriate as per our taste buds were concern . Schezwan Baby Corn and Paneer Tikka Masala was in veg starter. Dry chilli Fish and Chicken tikka kabbab was in non veg. Personally I ordered a Seesha (Hookah) - BRAIN FREEZER and later on Paan Flavoured !! Fantastic Ambience .. Enchanting Classical music. DJ was playing a whole lot of Hit from 80's. Starter quality was good. Though expected a little fast supply for the starters and more numbers of plates at a time of starters to serve purpose for us 13 heads. We almost carried on 3 hours with Drinks and starter ..then after had some photo session. Music beats was so powerfully hammering us that we could not stop ourselves from going to dance floor and move our body !! Post drinks session we had main course .. kulcha, Navaratna Curry, Daal Paneer Butter Masala, Veg Rice and one more chicken dish (north indian). Veg dishes were more tasty than that chicken one I must say ..After having drinks for so long Daal was seemed to be tasty than other heavy dishes !!
Over all a great Day once again at Beer Republic.

This was my first micro-brewery in Kolkata and well it was just about okay-ish. THe ambience was quite dark and shady with the crowd also not being something that caught my eye. ¬†
We tried all the beers that they had - blonde, amber, republic and brunette.

Brunette was essentially a stout which tasted of dark chocolate and chocolate flavours. This was my favourite.

The blonde was their wheat beer and the republic was their lager beer. Both of these tasted decent. The ale was also okayish in taste.¬†
The good part was the parle cheeselings that they served complimentary and this really helped.

Unfortunately no discounts were given considering the Pujo times - otherwise there was an ICICI card discount of 15% due to the culinary treats offer being applicable here.¬†
Overall the place can do better with a better attitude of the staff as well as improving the lighting and ambience of the place. ¬†
A 3.5 rating for this one.

Beer Republic is probably the best bar cum restaurant I have ever come across in Kolkata...
Ever since I have been to this place,I get a strong feeling that the food taste of Kolkata is slowly changing.And to an extent there has been a growth of many restaurants which have contributed to such change.
Beer Republic definitely falls into them as well.

Talk about the space and ambience of this place,it is very well spaced and the bar area also portrays a wide display.
There is a small area which hosts stage performances as well.

If you step into this place you'll get the feeling of entering a lounge where there is good music all throughout the day.And what keeps you alive is the food and drinks.

This place has got the largest collection of beers.You name it,you have it.The best ones are the Draught Beers which are served here.I would prefer to settle for the Republic Beer-very smooth in taste and during the happy hours there is always a buy one and get one free.

Me and another friend settled for an Apple Mojito which was well prepared and contained the right proportion of alcohol.Chunks of Apple added a different flavour and taste to the Cocktail.

We had a pan flavoured hookah which was also well prepared and some Chicken Nuggets and a Chicken Burger.
This place serves some really good hookah with multiple tastes like the Double Apple,Pan,Rasna etc.and the base range has water,milk and vodka.
The food was good,healthy and very well prepared too.

Price wise the restaurant is very reasonable and I believe this place makes some really good cocktails(have to give them credit for this).

For a stranger,if you are looking for music,good beer and food with your friends,visit this place and watch the time fly.
I'm sure it'll be worth it.

Review: Beer Republic

It is a comprehensive review focusing on main aspects of this new little place.

Location - 4/5
Located at ground floor or Swabhumi Multiplex, very easy to locate, though not situated at any arterial road.

Facilities - 3.5/5
Parking facility is there just at opposite of it, shared by Swabhumi Multiplex, but enough place to park except for weekends & holidays. Not much options to park if it is occupied. Inside you can find Billiards table and comfortable places to sit, according to everyone's taste.

Ambiance - 4/5
Nice place, with lighting that will suit taste of the most. You can find people from many age groups comfortably seating there, with no over the top loud music, actual conversations can start in this place.

Food & Drinks - 4/5
The USP of this place is the Microbrewery, which gives one options to choose from various types of beers. A good place to fall in love with beers again. For the food, not too costly, but tastes good. Best time to visit this place is during the Happy hours, because decent amount of beer and some eatables for 2 people will not cost more than 1.5k. That said, this place is not cheap by any extent, but for the pub with this ambiance, I will not exactly tag it as very costly.

Service - 2.5/5
You will be welcomed with a sample of various kinds of beers from their own microbrewery, to help you find what you want to have. Service people are very courteous when you enter, but in my opinion, a little understaffed to manage the orders in busy hours. The most annoying thing I have found is their hurry to serve the bill even when you are eating, and even half of your plate is not empty.

Overall - 3.5/5
A nice place for the beer lovers and casual evening hangout, but the service itself, one of the most important aspect of a pub, leaves a lot to be desired.

To quote a dear friend who had visit this place with me, "Just because zomato does not allow negative ratings I am forced to give this microbrewery this lowest rating possible."

The rating stands out and the quote actually tells the truth to my experience here on Oshtumi. Beer is very good here but talk about the service even the good brew cannot overshadow the lowly service provided by the staff here. Bad management, ill hospitality and fraudulent service schemes. One of my friend had clearly counted the total amount and paid the waiter, then again he comes back saying it's less and we need to pay 100 rs. When confronted he gets very rude and tells us he cannot let us count the cash again and this was just the last and final straw. I am not even gonna narrate the complete experience. Never going to this place again! Country Roads is a way better microbrewery than this in comparison.

It's a Shady place to start with , we went there on Sunday after hearing a lot about the micro brewery, we were 3 people and we were given a table on the mezzanine floor. We were there for about an hour and the staff came of that place came to us and said we have to share our table with others as there was shortage of space. Can you simply believe that, we weren't sitting in a roadside tea stall that you have to share the bench with others, we were paying 200+ taxes for a glass of beer. The attitude of the staff was so awful,  we said we don't want to share the table and we left the place asap. Never ever will I visit that place again, it's a let down!

Beer Republic perfectly defines a good nightlife bar. It was my first visit to a microbrewery bar. The place serves all sorts of alcohol and variety of Hookah.  Tried two draught beers, Brunette and Republic (liked Brunette more) and prices were pretty standard. Zomato says, Happy hours from 12-9 PM but I couldn't find any such offer. I went at 7 in the evening (So, not really sure about Happy Hours). 
Had to pay a cover charge of 500 which was decent. The cover could be used to buy anything and used as money while paying bill. 
The ambience was good. However, I was a little disappointed by the smoking room. It was situated below the stairs and was quite small. Even four people in the smoking room seemed a lot. 
Anyway, the place is good with ample booths, tables and space at bar. Music was also good with an in-house DJ (A little too loud I guess). 
On an average, the place was worth visiting again.

Definition of nightlife..? Come to beer Republic. Good and loud music, excellent ambiance made our navami night. They were taking 1000 bucks for entry but it will be adjusted on the bill, it was only during this puja. The draught beer doesn't taste much, but the food quality was good and yes quantity was not that much. The staffs were very attentive. Nice experience, surely will visit twice. But guys there is no happy hours in this puja.

Visited it on Astami¬†early evening after hearing about from my friends, but to be true I was really disappointed in the manner the place is run. There was no one to guide us to the table or to ask us to wait. Any half decent place would have a system to queue people who are waiting (the world has already moved to computerised spot booking terminals/tablets which lets the person know his turn and expected waiting time). After waiting for more than 20-30 mins figuring out whom to contact for a table, when I approached the person who seems like the manager, who inturn asked a waiter to figure out a place (but his tone was not at all suitable in the service industry, and seemed like he is doing some great favour). Sadly, I had to push my way in for a table myself. While I understand that there might be some rush, but not planning enough was something unexplainable.Now coming to the ambience, at that point of time they were playing some soft English songs, which were good. But the overall sitting arrangement is cramped, water leaking from ACs, toilet running out of tissue papers. One side of the wall was painted in some pinkish textured paint which outright give a feeling of a shady highway bar. The decor and seating does not zeal with an upscale microbrewery.¬†

The chicken pizza that I ordered seemed to be poorly made (just think of it in the standard of Mio Amore/Kathleen).My 1.5 only for the good beer.

I came to Kolkata during durga Puja after 2 years and needed to hangout in a good place with my best bud. Few of my friends recommended me this place.

Perfect location for a pub. Easy to spot. Happy hour was going on so we got buy one get one free. Pizza was not that good but still. It's affordable and a perfect place to hangout. It contains a smoking room so smokers, have fun.

Highly disappointed with this bar! Ambience is ok. The behaviour of the staff is very bad. We got a seat right below the speakers. It was too loud, and we asked for another seat incase someone leave the bar. They didn't give the seat even though some people left. Alcohol is Overpriced here. Food quality is very bad. Went there with friends but we can't even talk properly. They got the worst DJ in the city and made him play all rubbish English songs.. 
Will never visit this place again..

Honestly was little disappointed! üòû It was way too much crowded and the sitting arrangements are way too congested !  We had to wait for sometime, one of the staff asked us to sit upstairs in the restaurant to which we agreed but then another one declined it ! Ultimately we had to share tables with others !!!  
Service was very slow !!! 
Food was just average ! 
Well, Beer in Beer Republic made it up a bit !! Plus had a 'one plus one' !! üòä üçª 
Thats all Folks !!

Another microbrewery of Kolkata which I came to know very recently. Visited with my school mates yesterday evening. Honestly I cant judge the food as they were not serving the mains in the main sitting place. We had few starters which were ok, not great. Coming to the beer the brunette and the blondee both of them were awesome. I really liked their taste. The ambience: Well the DJ was nailing the songs with a proper mix of all the genre. The ambience was more like a discotheque than a restaurant. 

One thing which bothered me was the smoking zone. Its damn too small and ppl start smoking outside it. Something which could be worked upon when there is a huge crowd.

Beer republic the only place where you can hangout till early morning and that too with booze, the place has got an in house microbrewery so if you are looking for some good beer and great stories then this is the right place.

Amazing place. Great food. Definitely a place to visit in Kolkata. The interior, the ambience and the energy make it different from the other regular places. Must visit for people like me who usually survive their weekdays just to chill in the weekends.

Great ambience, mocktails, cocktails, hookah options and service. Everything summed up. Good music but the food was average. The starters were good but can't say the same about main course. Good variety of food though for both veg n non veg. Moreover you can get indo Chinese, burgers, indianfood options too! All in all good place!

It's probably one of the best destinations in the city for craft beer.They have a sporty interior ,a bar cum microbrewery in front,and a dance floor at the farthest corner.There is a 1:1 offer on all beverages for a good part of the day,which is why going in groups is a good idea.We had a pitcher of their "brunette" craft beer,bailey's irish creme and a sheesha.Before ordering their beer,you get to sample each of them.For food we had pan fried chilli fish,harsha's chicken skew and chilli prawns.The food items is the only thing they have to work on,the rest is simply awesome.

This place serves a huge range of Beers. In different kind of flavors some of be the coffee or blueberry. 
The service is bit slow sometimes still can be negligible. Now the starters the..  Starters were well cooked and served and were quite delicious but in case of Main course..  The food was not as good as the starters. And the ambience is oK and would not suggest for a nightlife hangout. A average night in BR

This place is just below swabhumi. I had ordered for teen paan hookah, a tower of beer , chilli chicken, farmhouse chicken pizza. Pizza wasn't good enough but hookah was really good . the staff was quite efficient and courteous. They also served complimentary peanuts and cheeslings. Ambience of this place gets better with time. This place is a must visit for people who mostly loves booze and hookah. Awesome experience. 
P.S- sorry for pictures I lost them.

Have you ever had to decide between a full blown alchohol riddled rave party and that one friend sworn to never touch alchohol? Well the solution to your problem lies beyond the threshold of beer republic. From entire meal courses to over-the-counter shots Beer Republic has clearly gone the entire mile. And so we were presented with an assortment of drinks, imported quality favourites to choose from while my teetotaler friend nibbled away at pizza. I prefered to order Indian though and washed it down with a satisfying tropical sour cocktail. Jager Bomb shots closely followed. Top-notch throughout. The decor and ambience were all suited to my taste as was the price, which i felt was pretty much reasonable. EDM music and a spacious dance floor added to the party mood. Big ups for the provision of valet parking. I will definitely go in for a second time and recommend a visit to all party hats out there.

A great weekend hangout spot. For all the techie guys, this micro-brewery gives that Bangalore vibe that was missing in Kolkata. Had an amazingly trippy experience the last time I dropped in. A big thumbs up to the ambience. The customized beer varieties were pretty cool and the best part is the long happy hours, which very few places have.

I would advise all of my friends and loved one and my friends who do go through this review to come and personally feel this place and it just would make you feel alive . The Beer is Fantastic with the best deals in the city with spectacular food and to keep up the city's joy the upcoming and past nightlife events that have been taking place and holding our Nightlife Young !

U will get humiliated if you go as a stag. The bouncer n receptionist sucks. No basic manners to interact with customers. Aisa bhaav hai ki uska baap ka maal hai. I feel like firing. But being open forum, I can't. But to be honest , seeing the ambience outside n a glimpse inside I felt the ambience its  absolute stunning. May b the bouncers sucks in hospitality. In case of any personal of beer republic management tends to read this review , kindly make sure nxt time any stag entry perosnal doent get hurt in mere future.

In love with this place. The first basic attraction is the microbrewery. Have tried two draught beers, one is the republic beer and other one is the Blondie. Both are very different from each other when it comes to taste and flavour and both are amazing. The happy hours are like the advantage. I have tried one cocktail too and that is great. Ambience and decor is mind blowing. Service is a little slow. Quality of food is amazing

This is place serves one of the best beer in Kolkata. It's not strong and feels like orange juice once in your mouth. The not so great part of beer republic is it's food. While the first time I went, the food was really delicious, especially the pizzas. Particularly because pizzas at this place have a lot Indian marsala taste into them. However, the second time, they were really bad, farmhouse pizzas was all bitter, base used was like one used at homes.
But I would still recommend the place for all the beer lovers.

Went there with friends as we bought deal through groupon.
Its near swabhumi .
Ambience is good with different seating areas sofas on one side high chairs on the other and first time in kolkata they have inhouse brewing the place was crowded on the weekday afternoon which was surprising for me 
The waiters asked us to taste four kind of beers which was made in house and then choose our beer all were of different flavour 
We ordered for pasta which was good . the guy serving us ali was very helpful he helped us in choosing our food ,hookah and beer 
Had a good experience would be visiting again

It is located right next to swabhumi. As expected it is an awesome place to have some fresh beer. The ambience is superb with hookah and tasty food. We ordered one chicken tikka and one chilly chicken dry. Both of them tasted yummy. The beer they serve is the best in town. Loved this place will visit it some day again.

Now this  place was in Bucket list for really long and I had some superb expectation from it but it's very unfortunate that it turn out to be a complete flop show. We tried the republic beer which was awesome but other then that there hookha to chill chicken to chill baby coin was just not worth it .. The foods are overpriced compare to the quality and the taste..   The seating arrangement is cool and the interior is nice.. Service was fast but they surely need to improve there food quality

Located right next to Swabhumi. This place is really making noise ! 
A two floored micro brewery which serves super fresh beer. 
Tasted their very own blondee , amber and republic beer 
All were very fresh and tasted different
In food we tasted the malai chicken kebab, crispy chilli baby corn chicken sandwich and garlic chicken
I loooved the garlic chicken ! It was too good !
The chilly babycorn was too chilly to gulp in
A good place to hangout with friends over some fresh beer. Music is good. Waiters are very good and couteous. Prosanto, Suvo and Chanchal Keep up the good job. 
The top floor seating arrangements could be better though , tables are a little too high and play stations could be free, maybe :)

Went there with friends as we bought deal through groupon.
Its near swabhumi .
Ambience is good with different seating areas sofas on one side high chairs on the other and first time in kolkata they have inhouse brewing the place was crowded on the weekday afternoon which was surprising for me 
The waiters asked us to taste four kind of beers which was made in house and then choose our beer all were of different flavour 
We ordered for pasta which was good . the guy serving us ali was very helpful he helped us in choosing our food ,hookah and beer 
Had a good experience would be visiting again

If you want to get a taste of a freshly brewed beer, then Beer Republic is one of the best addresses in town.
It has its own Micro-Brewery which brews fresh beers for is patrons.
I had a chance to visit the pub located just beside Swabhumi with 3 of my friends. After tasting the 4 varieties of the fresh beers, we finally selected the Amber variety, whose taste was simply amazing. Light yet with a premium feel. We ordered a pitcher (1 litre) and got another one free during their Happy Hours, which lasts upto 9 pm. We preferred the Blonde variety for the 2nd pitcher.
The Pan Fried Chilli Fish ordered with the beer was too spicy. Pizza was tasty. Crispy Chilli Baby Corn was just ok. Chicken Pop Corn was nothing extra-ordinary.¬†
Kamakazi Shots were good. Mango Colada was more of a healthy Cocktail, with Mango & Banana punches in it.
The star of the pub is certainly the Fresh Brewed Beer. And Amber variety is highly recommended.
Ambience is also good.
After taking 2 pitchers of beers, shots and Cocktails, there was no major tipsy feel.
A must-visit place for beer lovers.

We went with a lot of expectation as microbreweries are not very common in Kolkata. The staff is totally uninterested in service. It took them 10 minutes to get a menu across. All the menus which were given to us looked like they had just been put through a washing machine. they were half torn, crumpled and very shabby.

They have four beers from their brewery - Blondee, brunette, amber and republic. ¬†The beers should satisfy most palates, so that is their only redeeming point. I personally liked the blonde.

As far as food is concerned, this place is the absolute pits. We ordered pan fried chilli fish, mixed fried rice, fish and chips, spaghetti bolognese and grilled bhetki with lemon butter sauce with garlic bread. The pan fried chilli fish was served and then for 30 minutes, nothing else was brought to our table. After that, the dishes were brought one by one in intervals of 10-15 minutes. When we asked them why did you serve the chilli fish so early and the rest of the food is taking ages, their reply was - pan fried chilli fish is a starter!!they did not have a clue as to why we ordered the fried rice then. After we called for the manager, some semblance of sanity prevailed among them and all the food was taken back, warmed up and served.

Now for the food. The fish and chips was nothing but crumb coated and very deep fried fish fry with chips which were just dumped on a plate. The spaghetti bolognese was just chowmein with sliced chicken and no sauce. The grilled bhetki was coated with thick white sauce which we understood was their version of lemon butter sauce.

Overall, a not so memorable experience. if they want people to come back, they need to improve their service.

We went last Sunday evening. On entering, nobody was there to greet or find us a table, we found ourselves one and seated. There was a foul smell all around which was not bearable, so we requested for some freshener to be sprayed and AC to be put on. After some time of AC being put on, it was little better.
On asking for suggestion from the waiters, they were reluctant to give much advice. whatever they served was just placed¬†

The washroom is one strange part there, anybody opens the main gate, you see people standing and p*****, which is one very odd view for anyone, females especially. consider changing the direction of main door.

Food & Beverages serving: The serving was very odd, they brought and simply just placed in one corner everything and went by, not even caring to put things in ¬†front / reach of the customers. For eg, we ordered 2 drinks, ¬†he came and placed both in front of me only and not offering to place the drink to the lady. very careless approach.

Billing: I did not check the bill before paying carefully, but later realized they had not billed the hookah charges in the same and was added it writing in pen and taking the money from me. Not sure if it was correctly done but sheer something is fishy. As it would have attracted the taxes on the billed amount costing me more, but then what was the intention of Beer Republic? or its waiters, keeps me wondering.

Overall not a great experience ill say

I've never been here. I was planning to pay a visit this weekend to any new place to drink. I just came by this here in zomato. I was pretty excited seeing the first micro-brewery of Kolkata. I was reminded of the ecstatic experience I had in Prost, a kind blowing brew pub in Bangalore. But after reading the reviews what I thought, I better not pay a visit here. Nothing comes prior to service and each review complains about the service here. It's pathetic. I want more users drop the place without having an experience.üëéüëéüëé

Food & Drinks- 3.5/5
Ambience- 3/5
Price- 3/5
Service- 0/5

We had ordered crispy chilli babycorn, dry chilli chicken and N/V kebab plate and all the food items were as per expectations. We tried all the in house beers and those were good too.. Blonde (nice beer of medium strength), Brunnete (dark ale with rich undertaste of coffee), Amber (light beer and my personal favourite) and Republic (the normal Lager).

The ambience was pretty ordinary. On a Saturday evening it constituted mostly of middle aged men and scantily dressed women so Irish House still remains my favourite in Kolkata when it comes to crowd quality. Music was decent though- mostly soft rock and classics.

Now let's talk about the service. This place has hands-down the worst service I have seen in my life. The waiters are rude. When we entered the place no one even paid any attention to our seating. We walked up to a waiter and asked for a table for 7. He looked around, shrugged and went back to doing whatever he was doing ignoring us completely. Marvellous!
After a while we escalated the matter to the manager who gave us a table..but in the next 15 mins 3 different waiters made us move places thrice when we finally protested. Eventually they gave us a tiny place in a corner. In about 5 mins another table was emptied and we asked if we could relocate there and the SoB said "but I thought you don't want to move." 
As if his audacity wasn't enough after a while we saw him taking a hookah to a table..and smoking it himself on the way! Guys I urge you to PLEASE USE THE HOOKAH FILTERS for the sake of hygiene because chances are that the service boy has been smoking it before handing it over to you.

Pretty obvious but I ain't going back there again.

This place is pretty big, there are very few bars in Kolkata that are as big n specious as this one. Though the ambience is not anything special, it's just well decorated with comfortable cushions and dimly lit.
Overall this place looks posh n classy; however the crowd here is not too pleasant, rather most of them lack the basic level of civic sense and become appalling from time to time.
I happened to visit in the afternoon and the music was almost inaudible and all we could hear was people shouting n laughing.
They have a smoking room under the staircase that can accommodate more or less 5-6 people at a time and you may have to stand in a queue for your turn to get in there. For a place as spacious as this, they should consider extending the smoking room n make space for more people.

However, let's come to the most important point. This is undoubtedly one of the best places in kolkata to grab a beer. They give too many options to choose from; different kind of beers and almost all of them are amazing.
The fun thing is that you can see the gigantic containers where they brew the draught beers of different flavours n aroma, right behind the bar counter.
From the price list the drinks may seem to be a bit over-priced, but don't worry, they have 'happy hours' almost all the time, from 12 Noon to 9 p.m. So whatever you order, you get double of that.
Foods are kind of average, good enough for drunk people.
Now, coming to the most appalling thing; their service is kind of unorganised and definitely not upto the mark.
The staffs are not very attentive, you have to yell at them in order to seek their attention. Whereas in most of the places, a single person takes care of a single table, here it feels like there's no one to look after your needs; you just have to grab the person passing by your table and tell him if you need anything, and to your surprise he may actually ask someone else who is already engaged to some other table, and to your utter surprise, none of them but a third person would actually bring your drinks or food that you ordered.
And meanwhile you will keep thinking whether your drink or food would actually be brought or not.
This whole thing happens in such an unorganised way that they often fail to keep track of the list of drinks and food you order and may not even add some of them to your bill; and later on come apologising for that.

Anyway, this is undoubtedly a great place for beer lovers; it's definitely worth a visit.
I would love to go there again and taste rest of the beers that I haven't tried yet; and would appreciate if the service improves and the staffs be a bit organised and attentive.

First Things first this place is a tad bit overpriced and if you're visiting this place on a weekend you'll surely find a long queue there. So I'll suggest just be patient cause it'll be worth it.

This place is known for their Fresh and Brewed Beers. I'll probably say One of the finest in the city which is accompanied by good Rock Music. The food is Okayish and you'll find the smoking room quite small and congested.

But even though the service is a bit slow but the ambience is really nice.

So I'd recommend this place if you're a beer-lover and are a avid rock music fan. Then this is the place for you.

If you are looking for happy hours till 9 in the night and that too 7 days a week, then this is the place! Live DJs really get the environment going. Their variety of brewed beers are good, but my personal favourite has been the brunette! Adding to that, they also have nice variety of hookahs to go along. Perfect place to hang out in groups.

Kolkata's first microbrewery. Situated beside inox swabhumi. Parking available.Ambience is good. Games are also there. Staffs are very helpful. They serve four kind of beer blondee, amber, brunette and republic. Two dark and two light. If you can't decide which one to try ask for the tasters. According to my taste republic was best then amber. Nothing to mention about the food its very average. Tried garlic chicken which was okay. Also tried their mojito which was not up to the mark. They play good music and also have a dance floor downstairs. One good part is that they have happy hours. Though they claim to have a wifi but the staffs are very reluctant to give the password. Pocket pinch is high. Must try the beers they are the best part.

Visited with a couple of friends this Saturday evening. First, we were asked for Rs. 1000 cover charges per person which was non-refundable ofcourse. The staff were friendly though.
Secondly, we didn't get a single table after standing and roaming here and there around the pub for approximately half an hour. Finally we decided to stand at the bar counter and enjoy the night. It was 9:30 already.
The food was good, very expensive though. We ordered a lot, cheese garlic bread, onion rings, nachos, paneer tikka, crispy baby corn.
The quantity is too less but he quality is too high. There were no complaints with the food at all. Everything was perfect.
The sight of a microbrewery infront of you while enjoing some of the finest beers in town.
We tried 3 types of beers, the republic beer, blondee beer/wheat beer and the brunette beer. Brunette was the best with superb flavors and aroma. It tasted way too good.
The DJ played amazing music, even a non dancer would tap a feet.

Overall, a great place to enjoy your night. Big pocket pinch but worth it.

Just next to Swabhumi Inox. Valet parking is available which is really good about this place. Its capacious and has a dark themed microbrewery with Great music. However, what really turns me off is their service. Coz of being extra populated,waiters cannot really manage the orders that well. They are always in hurry for us to leave. Food here is average. Nothing great. I would like if they add more on their menu. Their Menu card could also be improved and made a lil more according to their theme.
Just the service is a lil on the low-key side or else the place is really gushing with people's excitement and enthusiasm.

The closest bar to my place and they were serving their own beer was what I told my friends to take them there,but what a mistake!!the tables even after being cleaned and mopped were so sticky,u couldn't keep ur hands on them....the servers are the worst kind I've seen in Kolkata,very rude and not willing to even provide you with basic table requirements like tissues,salt and pepper even after being asked thrice....now coming to their beer,having visited many micro-breweries abroad and in India itself,the quality of the beer is very ordinary,nothing to write home about....the food sucks the most.... don't go for anything non-vegetarian here....the most basic of chicken dishes one can serve are wings....it was giving out a very strong stench and I almost puked after putting on in my mouth....it had totally gone bad....I asked for the manager and asked him to have a taste....he said that it might have gone bad but we had to pay....I said that we will surely pay if he could have a piece in front of us , to which he denied and said he could replace it....I asked for the replacement to be packed,paid the bill and asked him to take the pack home for his kids....DO NOT go here.... only over hyper vegetarian teens who understand nothing about beer will find this place ok....

Been here for a reunion with friends. the ambiance was good and we were looking for a fun evening. But the staff was very rude and impolite in their behavior to a couple of my female friends. Nobody bothered to even say a sorry, rather the manager started arguing with us. Would never recommend this place to anyone just because of the staff.

This being a long weekend we decided to find out how Kolkata was doing in the microbrewery scene. Seems like we made the worst decision of our lives.
The place is dingy and no one cares about whether you seat yourself or roam about the place and leave. Once we entered and after a clueless 5mins we decided to sit ourselves on the high chairs (so much for the pub feel). And we kept ourselves seated without anyone bothering us for a good 10mins before someone decided to appear out of nowhere and ask "Have you ordered anything?". wtf! Then they took another 5mins to find all the different kinds of menu cards - food,sheesha and drinks and placed them in front of us and promptly left! The menu cards could have been a piece of papyrus unearthed from the tomb of Tutankhamun-threatening to crumble into nothing at the slightest touch! We saw the waiters serving samples of the locally brewed beer everywhere around us except us so we had to actually ask for a sample which took so much time to arrive that we had to remind the waiters that hey our sample is due before another one came and decided to take our order (without us having tried the samples) So we had the Republic beer that was pale yellow and light and peanuts to go with it. And in the meantime someone remembered that we had asked for a sample and they hastily put one in front of us! Anyway they had four different kinds of beer on offer- amber(which tasted horrible), blonde (which was yellowish water), brunette (which had a coffee-ish aftertaste) and the Republic beer (which was mild sweet and probably their best beer). We almost finished a pitcher of beer when thhe food finally did manage to make its way to our table- szechwan chicken and chilli chicken dry. And this was their only redeeming quality. The food was really good. We decided to try out the brunette beer next and ordered a plate of non veg spring rolls and another plate of szechwan chicken to go with it. We of course couldn't finish so had to carry it back home with us.
Now comes the bill part. There was 1:1 offer on drinks and imaginary food items added to the bill which of course we hadn't ordered. They were probably counting on us getting too drunk to realise that they had totally messed up the figures. They added some non veg kebab platter and one szechwan chicken worth 250 and another worth 295 to the bill. The waiter of course was questioned as to how the same item could have two different prices to which he gave us a totally blank look. I dunno if waiting at a microbrewery does that to you. My entire day was spoilt and so was the beginning of the long weekend! Am never returning there again and would not even recommend this place to my worst enemy!

Very much up to the mark keeping in mind the cost and the ambience. Truly loved it. The happy hours go on till 9 pm which is sooo rare. The beer from their brewery is very good in taste(we tried the amber one, the brunette was not impressive though).. a must place for beer lovers..

The place is one of the best places to have a beer. especially the custom made beers are a worth to the tongue. The idea of establishing a micro-brewery and serving it is a new and a fruitful idea. The taste, the texture and the smell all are smooth and one of the best that is available at the city.

This being a long weekend we decided to find out how Kolkata was doing in the microbrewery scene. Seems like we made the worst decision of our lives.
The place is dingy and no one cares about whether you seat yourself or roam about the place and leave. Once we entered and after a clueless 5mins we decided to sit ourselves on the high chairs (so much for the pub feel). And we kept ourselves seated without anyone bothering us for a good 10mins before someone decided to appear out of nowhere and ask "Have you ordered anything?". wtf! Then they took another 5mins to find all the different kinds of menu cards - food,sheesha and drinks and placed them in front of us and promptly left! The menu cards could have been a piece of papyrus unearthed from the tomb of Tutankhamun-threatening to crumble into nothing at the slightest touch! We saw the waiters serving samples of the locally brewed beer everywhere around us except us so we had to actually ask for a sample which took so much time to arrive that we had to remind the waiters that hey our sample is due before another one came and decided to take our order (without us having tried the samples) So we had the Republic beer that was pale yellow and light and peanuts to go with it. And in the meantime someone remembered that we had asked for a sample and they hastily put one in front of us! Anyway they had four different kinds of beer on offer- amber(which tasted horrible), blonde (which was yellowish water), brunette (which had a coffee-ish aftertaste) and the Republic beer (which was mild sweet and probably their best beer). We almost finished a pitcher of beer when thhe food finally did manage to make its way to our table- szechwan chicken and chilli chicken dry. And this was their only redeeming quality. The food was really good. We decided to try out the brunette beer next and ordered a plate of non veg spring rolls and another plate of szechwan chicken to go with it. We of course couldn't finish so had to carry it back home with us.
Now comes the bill part. There was 1:1 offer on drinks and imaginary food items added to the bill which of course we hadn't ordered. They were probably counting on us getting too drunk to realise that they had totally messed up the figures.

Located right next to Inox Swabhumi, this is one of THE best places to grab a beer and chill out with your close friends! Quite spacious, with cool background music and the right ambience for a sweet high...this place has their own microbrewery inside, and offers a taste of their various catergories of beer before you finally choose! We opted for Amber Beer..I dont know where else in Kolkata you can find beer such freshly brewed and that tastes so great! The beer cocktails are also highly recommended. The best part is that they have happy hours from 12 noon to 9 pm with a one on one offer..yay!! But unfortunately, their grub is not as remarkable as their drinks. The beer batter chicken nuggets we ordered were proof enough! Also the staff aren't quite friendly either, although the service is more or less okay. Plus the smoking room is really small and cramped up!! But I would come back here again for the one thing that matters, a pint of good ol' beer and the good times that follow!!

This is the first microbrewery in kolkata.We were hoping to have really good quality beers but ¬†were really disappointed.They let you taste their beers and then you can decide which one to go for.We were seated in one of those tall tables but we decided to shift to one of the couches coz it ¬†got vacant.THE STAFF IS SO RUDE !!!! They told us that the couch wouldn't be available since there were only 3 of us,while only two guys were seating there before us.They weren't asked to change seats.But we were.And that too very rudely.The crowd is pathetic.We decided to have a lil something and then leave.We had two glasses of amber.The beer was good.We ordered beer battered chicken nuggets which looked like pati bangla mangsher chop.No batter.Tasted bland.And the sauce that is came with had no taste,had watery consistency.Terrible experience.DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE.They ruined our evening.

Doesn't have that microbrewery feel of the ones in Bangalore or Gurgaon. Just a normal pub. There are couches on either side that are cozy, but also these cheap-looking China Town-ish tables in the centre. The decor looks incomplete, especially the ceiling. Lighting's not very impressive either.

The food was good though. We had crispy chilli baby corn, chilli fish, chicken tangri kebabs, a pizza and some others. All were good. The pizza was a wannabe thin crust.

We had the Republic Beer. Not that good. But you can keep drinking it without worrying. No uneasy sense of being full or anything like that. Had a slightly wheatish flavour, not Hefeweizen wheatish though, just a hint. Overall, Okay. And we went during the happy hours: one on one.

The music gets louder after 9pm. There's a small floor for dancing in front of the DJs, who played really annoying remixes of nice trippy songs. At one point, they played a stupid girly cover of Another Brick in the Wall.

And the waiter refused to share the WiFi password, saying it was down, when clearly, it was working. I'm never stepping into this place again.


Tip: on weekends, enter before 6pm. You won't get a table after that.

The first impression was pretty bad as my visit was on a Sunday evening and had to wait for an hour!!! Got a table finally after a brawl with the manager. A brother suggested this place for it's happy hours and offers on house brewed beers. Got the blonde and brunette combination with LIIT's. Ended the day with 2 round of Camino shots.
1. The beer was the finest I have tasted in Kolkata.
2. Ambiance was good, liked the standalone tables but not the white coloured sofas.
3. Pizza was better than spaghetti with meatballs.
Tip: move in before 6pm to get seats on weekend.

4 flavours of beer r available here. they all taste almost the same, with minor differences. the beer served is also very light. you can't expect more from a microbrewery, with limited period of fermentation. nothing special in the ambience either. tried couple of food items. they don't taste good. not keen in going back. there's a small ice lounge attached to it and chargeable extra on hourly basis, which is a waste. in fact this whole space used to be an ice lounge, which never became popular.

Beer republic has become one of the hotspot for people to hang out. The ambience is quite good   . the brewed beer they are serving is one of the best in d twn. Only let down of this place that i felt is there service is little bit slow.
Other than that it is a good place to hang out with your friends.

Visited this place once alone.had some pegs of scotch there ( which i always do whenever I visit any pub) and some kebab  ( don't remember the name). 
Now,let's focus on the second day i tried to visit this same place.as far as i remember, the date was 17/07/2016,time 12:10am,SUNDAY. As, usual i went to have a drink alone.

Many others other than me,were severely humiliated by one person who i guess happens to be an " employee " but he claimed himself to be " THE MANAGEMENT". his points were as follows,

1. Since some "stags" ( according to him) had created some problems few days back, so NO STAGS ARE ALLOWED.

2. He is in this industry for 15 years , so HE IS THE BOSS

3.Don't question me on MY decision otherwise, this person ( who happens to be a bouncer ),will beat you black and blue right here.

4.REMEMBER MY NAME WHICH IS AS FOLLOWS--- "FAROOQ ___  ___ ".(HE DID MENTION HIS FULL NAME ALONG WITH HIS SURNAME BUT OBVIOUSLY I ACTUALLY DON'T BOTHER TO REMEMBER THE LATTER)

5. Etc Etc.

NOW, MR/MRS BEER REPUBLIC , IT  SHOULDN'T MATTER TO YOU THAT I IMMEDIATELY WENT TO WATER SIDE CAFE ONCE AGAIN ( I HOPE YOU PEOPLE KNOW WHERE IT IS ,OTHERWISE take help from google.co.in ) to spend the remainder of the night having scotch, what matters are as follows:

1. Just because some so called discrete stag created a problem, you ACTUALLY CANNOT CLASSIFY ALL THE STAGS AS POTENTIAL MISCREANTS because according to your logic MR/MRS BEER REPUBLIC , "all politicians are corrupt" , isn't it???

2. WE ALL ARE HUMAN BEINGS AND WE DESERVE TO BE TREATED LIKE HUMAN BEINGS WITH AN ELEMENT OF HUMANE ATTACHED TO IT.MOREOVER, ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT 2 THINGS CAN BE EARNED, 1. RESPECT, 2. MONEY, THINGS WHICH TAKES TIME TO GET ACCUMULATED BUT JUST A MOMENT TO VANISH. 

THERE ARE A LOT OF TOP NOTCH PUBS IN KOLKATA, SO DON'T EVER THINK MR/MRS BEER REPUBLIC , THAT YOU PEOPLE ARE DOING US A FAVOUR.

WHO HAS GIVEN YOU THE AUDACITY TO DISRESPECT PEOPLE? IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO YOU ARE BECAUSE EVEN THE  PRIME MINISTER IN A DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY LIKE INDIA IS ANSWERABLE.

LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST, ALWAYS REMEMBER MR/ MRS BEER REPUBLIC , " A PEN IS MIGHTIER THAN THE SWORD".


GOOD NIGHT!

Very very poor Management.  First of all there was no one at the entrance to tell us that the lounge was full.  They took money before providing us any  seat and to top it of they stated that minimum of rs 1000 was required before we can even enter the bar....

Was kinda overcrowded so had to sit above üò°üò° beer and hookah was 1 on 1 in happy hours so that was cool üòÑüòÑ also you have to take the same beer on 1 on 1 can't take different even though the same price. Just schemes to earn more money. Beer was nice though. Overall good experience.

Swabhumi has been a famous public spot for the citizens of Kolkata for over a decade now. Such publically appealing landmark has given way to a number of dining and entertainment establishments around itself.

One such place is Beer Republic. They pub is in the basement and just beside the Inox entrance. During its initial days, it wasn‚Äôt much popular and the service too was lowly. Recently however, they have found some new fame with much improved food and service. They have taken an initiative and cashing in on being the first ever microbrewery in Kolkata.

We had been there on a Saturday night and the place was jam-packed. The interiors are average with minimal d√©cor. There is a nice arrangement of seats covering most of the floor area, thus, allowing a seating capacity for scores of people. The whole microbrewery setup is visible just behind the bar which adds a classic touch to the ambience. Being at a microbrewery, we were not gonna miss out on the freshly brewed beer. They serve 4 kinds of breweries.

On arrival they serve you samples of these variants, from which you can pick as per your liking. We felt more inclined towards the Amber Beer and went for that, ordering 2 pitchers of it. We were there during the happy hours, thus availed the 1:1 offer. Later on we also ordered some Draught Beer under the same scheme.
For food, we had Cheeze Pizza and Penne Aglio Olio pasta. Both the main courses were really good in taste. The sauce in the pasta had proper flavours. The pizza was very cheesy and absolutely yummy. Thumbs for the food.

The pub has a nice ambience with decent crowd. A photographer is present on all weekends to capture your memorable moments spent in company of some amazing beer. I also liked the food we were served and given the price, I have highly rated this place. With respect to the huge crowd, the service was fluent.

...ok now, if you have been to other cities of India, & visited Micro-Breweries, this one is a NO NO for you. This one looks & feels anything but a Micro-Brewery or a pub for that matter. It looks & feels more like a Dhaba serving alcohol , with tables & chairs scattered in a big room. Extremely uncomfortable bar-counter with a smoking-zone under a stair-case, where anybody a bit around 6 feet is bound to have his or her ¬†head hit by the roof....the DJ is the only good factor here. Though there is no dance-floor. i found people just dancing in an area, which was apparently the Dance Floor!!! Food is nothing extraordinary. The beer served is okay. Nothing that would make you say wow!! :(

This is one of the very few and apparently the first microbrewery in Kolkata. They have four different beer on offer. The good thing is that they will get all the variants and then you can taste them before deciding on any one or two. The beer is good. Loved it. On the food part, it was just about average. Not bad but not that gr8 either. Service was pretty good and quick. Smoking area inside is a positive. Overall ambience is a little disappointing and so is the crowd. Good place to hangout with Frens but would not consider if planning an outing with the family. Overall, just go there for the beer and nothing else will matter after a point of time!

Went to this place some time back. Well it's the 1st and the last time I'll be visiting such a pub.
It's the worst ever pub that I have visited.
The crowd is simply pathetic and it seemed as if the place is filled up only with the call girls.
Fooding is absolutely a disaster, staffs are not at all good and you would consider yourself lucky if they listen you at your 1st call.
This is just not the place for any brother to come with their sister.
Overall, even if all the pubs gets closed and this is the only option I'm left with, even then I'll never come here.
This place isn't even worth reviewing.

Horrible experience for the first time in a place like this. 

Went on a Sunday with frnds, they are asking a minimum value charge of 3k for three people just to have beer??what is this...??its a disc or a zoo to have an entree fee..??NONSENSE...!!! They treated us very bad, as if we are begging them to provide us a seat...

Pls guys try to avoid this place in near future...I will not at all recommend my frnds and family for this place...!!!

To my all Bros who don't drink either with Girlfriends or just want to celebrate with your beloved friends, ThinK before stepping here. One fine day (Sunday) we friends decided to hit the road and after 3 hours of driving we thought why not celebrate our Friendship at "Beer Republic" and that's where we done the mistake. 1st to mention that if you have Chev Spark or any other small cars people who are there to assist you to parking wont help you. You have to go out of car hunt for parking(you wont believe how much congested it is on Sundays) and then if you find one then you have to fight with the staff for the space you have found otherwise space would be given to some other big car. After this ordeal when you are manage to enter there "REPUBLIC" which hate "PubLiC" you will face there staff who is standing there just to sell tickets (cover price) to this place and yes they charge Rs 3000(non-refundable). Oh i forgot to say before coming we called them and asked if they have room for us and do they have happy hours. I asked why do we need to pay and we will have have 3000 bucks bill so he told me if want enter then u have to pay upfront regardless of how much you bill. So we almost decide pay when suddenly a couple enter and they just paid 1000 bucks and ¬† one of my friend tried to ask the man again then he said rudely that "i have already told him can't repeat again" and that's the moment i decided that i don't want be here. and sorry i cant update the photo of the guy as i have never faced any situation like this ever. but any Fellow reviewer been there last Sunday and mistakenly taken the picture of the fellow standing at the gates kindly¬† upload it here.

So me and couple of buddies hit this place yesterday. The usp, to nobody's surprise, is the micro-brewery. We did probably get the worst seats in the house but hey, that wasn't really a big issue.

Moving on to the beer, we ordered the brunette first and after a while amber joined in. Personally, I did not really like brunette, maybe cause I don't like coffee. To all the coffee lovers out there, this might be jackpot. The amber on the other hand had an overwhelming aroma to it.

We ordered a chicken steak, chicken nuggets and pizza. The steak was good, but nothing out of this world. I don't like pizzas so I won't be judging it. The nuggets could have been better.

Coming to the ambience, they played jazz up until 7 and then started playing some upbeat numbers from 7 onwards. The service was okay but when we asked if we could change seats, two of them(waiters) mumbled something and then came up with an excuse that we need to clear the bill on our table before we could move on to a different table. Hmm. Really?

Anyhow, all in all it was a decent experience.

Beer republic is one of the latest addition to the life of Kolkata. Located at swabhumi, this joint provides home brewed beer and have a happy hour stretching till 9 pm. On arrival they present their guest with 4 choices of beer shots so that you can taste and then order. The foods were also good but quantity seemed much less. The ambience is very nice and comfortable and is always crowded enough to get yourself in the party mood.
Pros : drinks, ambience , brewing, costs perfect for drinks
Cons : Quantity less and a bit costly for foods

Beer Republic is the first brewery in Kolkata and offering four different flavors.
The one of its kind is the place for the beer lover like us.
Located just besides Swabhumi. 
The Pub has a huge space for accommodation.. including their special Ice lounge called Frost.

They offers taster's before ordering their unique flavors of brewed beers..Amber,blonde,brunette and republic.
 
I must say every flavors are pretty much different from the others.. but my personal favorite is their beer called Brunette which is a strong in flavor and gives you a coffee kind of taste. 

But Food is very disappointing and there's nothing I would like to suggest in terms of food.There's nothing in their menu which will tantalize your taste buds.

Service is nothing extraordinary.. and lacks is professionalism..Servers sometimes forgets your order and getting their attention is a hard task..lol

Interiors are basic.. doesn't appealed me much.. I didn't find it that great.. the dark lighting is bit substandard.
Even the couches are very mismatched with their interior. 

CONCLUSION - The place is a heaven for beer lovers and worth visiting but the place lacks in fast service and great food over beer.
But if sipping beer is their only call then Beer Republic is the place for them.

It's nice place to chill. The best part is that it has its own brewery which is one of its kind in kolkata. It's a good hangout place when one goes with a huge gang.

Try their "Beer Republic" beer.

I didn't know about this place earlier. Service was not upto the mark. The good thing is Happy hours, which i guess attracts everyone here. Otherwise, the brewed beers are okay, not too good! I would like them to improvise on the quality of the beers and starters.

Nice place to try out different types of beer. And about the expense part yes it's a bit expensive. But then again the quality of the beers specially the brunette and blonde beer are of the charts it's very tasty.
Now for the disliking part yes the kebab platter that we ordered was very dry and chicken was very hard to cut even. Next was the Pan Fried chilli fish. The taste was good even the fish was also nice but the preparation was very hot. By the term hot I mean the chilli content was very very high.
Now about the ambience, it's simply awesome. You just need to visit to understand.
In other words a nice place to try out different types of beers. But food quality is very low.

My dad introduced this only micro-brewery in Kolkata to me. It was happy hours and we ordered a pitcher of the brunette beer and we got a tower. The beer was fantastic. Dark and strong. But my only problem with this place was the food. Absolutely bad. But other than that it's a nice place. One more important reason for the low rating is the music being played. It's just too loud. That's all about it. Maybe tone it down a notch.

This place is supposedly Kolkata's first microbrewery. That is the only reason people go and visit this place I guess. The brewed beers come in 4 variety and none of them are impressive. Since, I am from Bangalore, I would suggest this place to come visit and then improve themselves. The ambience is so so. The staffs are extremely rude and irritating. This place is "bleh".

I think this is probably one of the best pubs in Kolkata... Went on my birthday... Awesome crowd and good ambience... Happy hours made me really happy.. They have 4 brewed beers and they do give u testers before... According to me the best among them is the darkest one (with a coffee smell)... best beer I have tasted... Do check it out during the happy hours...

Given the fact that this is the first micro brewery in Calcutta, this place was the first place I wanted to visit when I returned back to this city and the word disappointment would be an understatement to describe this place, which is an insult to the concept of microbreweries. Me and my friends chose to visit this place in the afternoon and were first overwhelmed by a borderline disgusting aroma. The staff was rude and were more interested in chilling and watching television than ensuring quality service. We ordered chicken wings which for some reason were deep fried and the sauce served with it was average at best. When it comes to the main issue, there were four types of beers which were far from impressive and barely had any alcohol content.

It's my first visit to this place and any microbrewery . ordered brunette draught beer ,amber draught beer, Margarita and beer batter chicken nuggets . As we were in the happy hour time we got buy one get one offer which put the cherry on the top . I personally loved the brunette one which has a rich smokey aroma . And it also serves hookah which is another plus point .Apart from foods and drinks, ambience and d√©cor of that place were convenient and comfortable for hangouts . though we didn't order much food still I feel they need to give more choices to the customers. I will be there again .

This place has been in my wishlist for a really long time.It's the first microbrewery on City of Joy.It's situated right next to the entrance of Inox Cinema(swabhumi).
I came here with a group of college friends to get a taste of amazing beer from this place. We occupied a booth in the corner.They provided us with testers of 4 beers they make in-house.After tasting those we decided to settle on Republic beer because of the flavour of honey coming through the beer and Belgian blonde for the smooth fruity note in the lager.

1st came a tower of Republic beer(1+1=2lit in happy hrs).2 types of snacks(usual badam and yummy cheeselings) were given with many refillls.Beer was smooth..we liked it the best of lot.Later we had a pitcher of belgian blonde too.Since 1:1 offer was given on hookah too we ordered a teen paan and vanilla flavoured hookah.Sheesha  was smooth,flavours were good..really nice.

We also wanted to have lunch here.So while gulping down mugs of beers we ordered few dishes.They were crispy chicken,dry chilli chicken,panfried chilli fish mixed fried rice,chilli prawn.Only 1 of us was a non meat eater(she eats fish) hence she took mixed sauce penne pasta(veg) and 2 of us went for biriyani(chicken and mutton).All of the Chinese dishes were really very good specially the crispy chicken,panfried chilli fish,chilli prawn.The starters were going well with the chilled beer. I had a taste of pasta..It was tangy,cheesy and yummy. Portion was big.
But the biriyani was horrible..so disgusting that it can't be said in words.
It's best to stick to the oriental and continental dishes this place offers.

Ambience was cool and the music played was suitable for the place too.Service was prompt.At happy hrs the place provides good deals.Not much light on pocket but still very much worth it for the sake of the variety of beers this place offers.It's a great place to chill out with buddies over a couple of mugs of super awesome chilled beers.

This place was on my radar for a long time. But every time we wanted to check it out it had a huge wait time. Finally we were able to manage.

This place hits you with a very homely feeling. And the beers they brew will probably give the ones in Bangalore a huge fight for money. We took two kinds the "blonde" and "brunette". The brunette was the typical dark ale, with that smokey after taste, pretty strong and a cherishable aroma. But the real revelation was the Blondie. Oh my god. Uniform texture, beautiful golden colour. Fantastic fizz and a beautiful taste. It's alcohol has been aptly brewed to give that perfectly balanced kick. Blondie has officially floored me.

Foodwise stick mostly to finger foods. We ordered a beer battered chicken with a chicken pizza and a popcorn . These places are never too savvy with the food, so don't go looking for fancy stuffs in a brewery.

I felt the staff was working a bit under capacity the day we went, but probably the weekends are like this. They are friendly, the crowd is impeccably friendly and warm. And their smoking room is to die for. You might just get lucky and create some happy memories.

Kudos to the first microbrewery in Kolkata. Just like many of the firsts in this city, you haven't let us down one bit.

Look forward to visit soon. Cheers!!!!

This place is horrible. The staff is ill mannered . The manager does not listen to complaints and argues instead. I had a very bitter experience going there and I shall never visit again . If you dont have the basic courtesy to behave properly with your guests you should shut the place down. Also the 4 types of beer that they serve are pretty ordinary.

The place has a great ambiance and interior with their own dj, which gives you a party like feel. Coming to food, had blonde beer for our pitcher. The taste was smooth. We had chicken pop corn and crispy chilli baby corn with it. The content of them was very disappointing compared to the price they were charging!

The microbrewery in Kolkata which has more than one variety of beer. We tried the wheat beer and liked it. Nice and spacious ambience. Music is loud but good collection. However, they need to focus more on the food platter. Even though they have a good spread of menu but they don't taste good and the quantity of a portion would not even serve one properly.

This place is situated in the Inox Swabhumi building- you just enter right instead of going straight into the Ino security checking.¬†
The first micro brewery in the city, Beer Republic has four different types of unique flavours of beer on offer- 2 light and 2 dark. The best thing to do here to decide which one you want to take is ask for a taster.¬†
We chose the Blondie beer, which is a mild one and was quite decent. We went in during the happy hours (12-9) and got 2 pitchers for the price of 1.¬†
We were a bit apprehensive about the food, but went for some chicken popcorn and crispy chili baby corn eventually. The crispy baby corn was good. The popcorn chicken was pretty much the worst version of that item I've ever tasted though. It was pretty pricy, the quantity was less and it tasted nothing like it should.¬†
The overall ambiance of the place was pretty good. We went in the afternoon, so it was empty and no live music. So if that's what you're looking for, go in after 6 maybe. The service was good. The pocket pinch substantial. Would I recommend the place? I probably will.

We went to this much hyped first micro brewery in Kolkata on a Saturday evening. First things first this place was crowded and while we were waiting outside for our table the Manager and the assistant manager decide to fight among themselves in front of everyone, for me Not at all a good first impression. We had to wait around half and hour. Cover charges for 4 people- ‚Çπ3000.

Seating-¬† Uncomfortable, Not much space between 2 tables.¬† We were given a table in front of the dj. And yes while one waiter was accompanying us to the table disappeared in the middle and we were all left alone to look for a table. So we found an empty table and sat down, which was not cleaned from the last order. 
Talking about dj, I think he had a break up that day, played the worlds saddest songs that he could find.¬† The waiters have no clue what-so-ever about the menu. 

Food and Drinks- we had arrived during the happy hour and whatever they give during that period is I don‚Äôt know what never tasted such bad drinks. Composition of drinks were!¬† Yes !¬† and service is too late.¬† LATE LATE LATE!! ! The beer arrived 45 mins after we ordered. and the food was served cold and of course late !
Half of the things in the food menu were not available. And the waiters take so much time to bring the menu card for the second time. So, if you are that person who orders after every drink, don‚Äôt. Try to order everything at one go coz you never know when you will see the waiter next! 

We were upset with the place, but had no choice as we were already there and payed 3k so we decided to make the most of it and then as the¬† night went on, they moved few tables to make room for dance floor. By then there was a new dj that had come in and playing some decent songs, everyone was dancing and being crazy. 
¬†AND THE WORST THING HAPPENED ! 
It was around 12 when the when the bouncers dropped in and said NO STAGS on the dance floor. I mean what? All this time where were you guys? No stags? wth?For so long who were dancing were all stags, We went there to have a good time; and then you say no stags ?¬† the experience was kind of bittersweet. all of a sudden the dance floor was empty!¬† There was few people dancing just beside their tables and then the dj announces that NO STAGS! And continued playing his music.¬† I don‚Äôt know if¬† that was a regular thing or it happened only that day. 

whatever it is I am not going back to this place again. one of the worst place for hangout. -_-

Ambience is electrifying.
Our food choice was limited to salads only, so can't comment on the food in general. The salads were good, but not extraordinary...Caesar salad being the best.
We tried Brunette & Republic beer, which were quite to our liking. We'd expected a richer taste, but considering the fact that happy hours runs from 12pm to 9pm, we weren't  complaining!
Service was also nice, no issues there.
Certainly a place you can go time after time & enjoying every bit of it!

As the name goes The beers were nice and republic, but Dj was so pathetically non republic that playing 98.3 fm would had saved lot of management's money. Very poor management of crowd. Unlike other place in main Calcutta this place didn't even had seats at bar counter leave alone the tables which were filled with hookah puffing crowd with virtually no beer in their hand at "beer republic". Pls don't order anything to eat. they gave tomato ketchup with tortilla chips instead of salsa sauce( !! As mentioned in menu!!). If u r going with friends there are certainly better place as of now. However I will give 5 stars to bringing concept of micro brewery to Calcutta.

This is the first microbrewery in Kolkata and although 2 more have opened I chose to visit this one because of the location.
This place is situated at the Info Swabhumi complex in Beliaghata. 
The entrance is massive and is very nicely done with beer quotes and a huge beer bottle to take those nice pictures. 
The place is huge in terms of space but I felt that the seating arrangement could have been better. 
Firstly it is very hard to find a server or helper to get to help you. You have to walk up to them and ask,only then do you get attention.
The place where we sat was comfortable but after 5 minutes we had to change the place courtesy leaking air conditioner! Water was dripping from top and a lot. 
Changed our seats and asked them to give a sample of all the 4 brewed beers they have.
The only decent one was the blonde beer and that is what we opted for. Thank god they have a long happy hour. All the alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks are priced at sky high so the happy hour thankfully takes care of that. 
The food menu on the other hand is something of a sad affair. The dishes are priced way too high with the quantity they give. I am willing to pay more but it has to be proportionate with the thing I am getting. 
Wanted to order calamari but they said they don't serve that but it is on the menu. Had he said they didn't have it for the day I would have got it. 
So we settled for a garlic chicken and chili garlic prawn.
The chicken was good and the pieces were juicy and loaded with fried garlic. Just the way I love. But the prawn was a downer. 6 pieces of prawn cooked in a very bad sauce. And to pay 465 plus taxes! The peanuts served are unsalted and even the basic salt and pepper are not on the table! 
The service is really bad. I had to get up everytime and go and speak to the waiters for attention. 
I do hope the management takes things a bit seriously and work out things for the betterment.

A really nice place to go for drinks, especially in the happy hours. But don't go too early if you want to have continental food ,their continental chef doesn't come early and hence we had to wait around 2 hours for the food. Otherwise nice ambience. You can give it a try, especially beer lovers.

My friend and I landed up at Beer Republic on a weekday evening with the intention of catching up on a year's worth of conversation, and we spent five hours here comfortably. I'll jump straight to the things that I liked and those that I did not like.

Things That I Liked:
(1) The beer! Going in, I had certain misgivings but I was glad to be proved wrong. You are allowed to choose after a tasting round and I liked the taste of most of them. We settled for a pitcher of Republic Beer.
(2) The service wasn't extraordinary but it was decent and the waiter was fairly attentive.
(3) Ambience holds great potential if they do something about the music.
(4) Happy Hours from 12 to 9!

Things That I Did Not Like:
(1) Music! I had read the reviews complaining about the music before going in but I didn't expect it to be as terrible as it was. There are large LED screens everywhere you look tuned to good music channels but for some reason, they are muted, and the music blaring away on the speakers completely nullifies the good vibe the place gives off.
(2) Farm House Chicken Pizza! It was really below average and seemed to be baked by an amateur chef at best. The topping was insufficient and you'd probably need magnifying glasses to look for chicken bits.
(3) Long Island Iced Tea had an overwhelming taste of cola in it instead of - well - TEA!
(4) The place is large and spacious with varied seating options but the tables and bar stools seem really cramped. It's difficult to navigate between them without bumping into someone else's table.

The place fills up as the evening progresses. I'd give it another go in the future simply because there is ample room for improvement. I'd give the place the benefit of doubt because it's still relatively new in the business and a step in the right direction for the bar culture in Kolkata.

Inclusive of tax, the bill for three litres of beer, four rounds of vodka, two LIIT and one pizza cost us neat 2603 rupees.

Trash food and even trashy managers who treat guests like trash compared to regulars... twice we were asked to wait after being given tables and being seated... well it may be crowded but I am sure the crowd will have a few people less.. the person and the allowing tables even qualified to become a doorman... the worst experience ever....

Nice place to have drinks with snacks. The ambiance is pretty good. Service is friendly. They took cover-charge of 500 per person. Pocket pinch: 700-800.

Situated near Swabhumi, this place has nailed it's naming for starters. Have been here just once and I instantly liked the vibe of the place.  The selling point remains it micro brewery which is right behind its well stacked bar. That gives the bar kind of a grand look. The food is good but nothing special. I tasted all 5 available brews. Liked the Amber among them. They need to really work on their liquor pricing. It's priced on the higher side when compared to other better outlets. Overall, it was a good experience.

Quick short review - Worth trying out. You won't regret the experience.¬†

Detailed review - Overall, it's a nice place to try out. Being a micro-brewery, the first in the city, the novelty factor will draw you in and you won't regret it. It's hard to judge the place from the reviews until you try out the beers for yourself (and of course liking or hating them will depend on individual taste). Trying to write up a comprehensive review here so that you can decide easily. But the best judge will be YOU, yourself.

1. Ambience - It's a huge place and the ambience is great. Seats are comfortable, crowd is good and gives a nice cozy pub feeling. If you want to really get into the live music (DJs), you can take a table nearer to the speakers. Live matches are telecast throughout the floor on LCD TVs and a large screen near the DJ console (though the view is blocked unless you take the very first table near it). Didn't try out the frost lounge, they have a ‚Çπ500 entry fee per person at the time of this review.¬†
Ah, you get to have a view of all the beer tanks too :D

Ambience Rating - 4.5/5

2. Beer/other drinks - Now if you are visiting this place, the very first reason will surely be to try out their beers. That's what most people out there do and you'll find large pitchers on tables all around you. This is where personal choice kicks in. I'd describe the beers as very light (both in terms of taste and alcohol content - 5% rated). But the taste is very good (again a very personal comment). There's a fruity smell and I tried 3 out of 4 of them. "Brunette" as described by the waiter is the strongest available option, while it does taste stronger than the rest, in absolute terms, I'd rate it as a light beer too. Throw Toits and such breweries out of your mind and try out with an open mind. Hope you'll like it. Also, it's a good place to introduce your girlfriend/wife to beers (well, that may sound stereotyping, but what I meant was, typically non-beer drinkers will love these beers too).
I'm expecting them to come up with much stronger tasting and more complex beers in future. As per other available choices, the list was huge but I shouldn't comment as I didn't try any of them and I don't know if they were available. But the bar seemed well stocked.

Bar Rating - 5/5 (I'm ignoring non-availability of stronger options due to the novelty factor and taste of the available ones).

3. Food - This is an area where vast improvements are needed. You'd expect a restaurant of this size to serve everything noted in the menu, but Alas! NO! Many of the options are not available. And not only particular options! I was told burgers were not available. At the end, when I asked for desserts, I was told no desserts were available. Not sure if they were genuinely not available or it's a ploy to clear out tables (didn't seem so though as it wasn't full house), either is not acceptable. But the taste of available options is very good, no complains about that. In fact a big thumbs up for that.

Food Rating - 2.5/5 (non-availability is a big turn-off)

4. Service - Just OK. Don't expect them to know a lot about the food or ask them about recommendations (for starters I was recommended dry chilly chicken...how innovative!). You have to search/call out the waiters to gain attention, ask for repeats/order something. Though I don't mind that rather than having someone staring at us and attending when not needed. They do try to help you out and behave very well.

Service Rating - 3.5/5

5. Pricing - Hit the pub within happy hours and you'll love it. Considering happy hours, the beers are very priced very well. Other drinks seemed a little pricey, but I didn't bother looking into them much so shouldn't comment. Food is priced just OK.

Pricing Rating - 4.5/5

Overall - Just what I started with. Try it out. Overall the experience was awesome, the food was lovely and you get to taste beers directly from the brewery in front of you.

As much as I was hoping to like this new microbrewery so near to where I live, I was sorely disappointed and underwhelmed by my experience there. It being a microbrewery, we opted for the craft beer. Though happy hours were on, we were informed that we could only avail of the 1+1 offer on one type of beer and this in my opinion will drive away a number of beer enthusiasts. Though the light an@d dark craft beers were delicious to taste, it's alcohol content is probably very low cause we didn't feel a thing after drinking over a litre of beer per person. Now on to the food. We ordered crispy chilly babycorn and chicken wings. I honestly cannot recall the last time I had chicken wings that were made so poorly. We were served deep fried chicken dripping with oil along with a spicy red sauce. The crispy chilli baby corn was okay. Also, the peanuts that we were served along with our drinks were soggy and rotten. Maybe it had been kept out for too long. It certainly didn't help that the staff were borderline rude and  discourteous.

Let's start with the good part and that was a reasonably good play list with some good numbers. However it's all downhill from there - poorly maintained large place, clueless staff and the beer, ugh!!! Something called the republic that's brewed locally there and must rank amongst the worst I've ever had. Avoid this place.

You made my dayüòç Yesterday it was quite a humid day and I was got damn tired and ended up grabbing a seat in this pub. I had the blonde beer which was really amazing. Rather I would say it was a great thing to see the mini brewery and the most alluring "WHEAT BEER" . I have never ever had wheat beer in Kolkata and I doubt that how may outlets serve that. The food was very tasty and up to the mark we took one fish one chicken  and one salad dish all three were equally admirable. And the service was really great the server was real polite and well behaved. And you get a happy hour till 9p.m isn't that really amazing!!!

Yesterday i visited this place, along with my two other friends. And to our surprise it was much better than our expectations. Heard a lot about this place, this is actually situated right beside the inox near swabhumi. The entrance had a lot of graffiti's on the wall, different interesting quotes. On your left you will find the vast area filled with couches, high stools and bar at the end of the area which also has the microbrewery show room. The crowd started to rise on peak hours. The best part is they have happy hours here till 9pm!
When we took our seats the server brought us the tasters, 4 types of brewed beers, we chose the blonde beer coz it was close to wheat beer in taste. We also got a hookah which was also one on one. We ordered food according to our expert guy/server called shubho. We had chili garlic pepper chicken, pan fried chili fish and warm mushroom chicken salad. We later on had also ordered Johnny walker red label whiskey. The service was prompt and my server was too good. Upstairs they have a games section where we played pool, there's a section of -6 degrees still there in beer republic, where they charge extra 500 bucks for sitting but we did not choose that option. So we were completely full and happy when we left this place, pocket pinch was also reasonable. Would love to visit this place again, kolkata needs such micro breweries!!

Love this place. Since the day I discovered it it has become kind of a regular watering hole for me and mah frens. The bar is extensive,the food is very tasty, the staff warm and professional but under pressure they buckle a bit. But they are catching up as is the place. Food is tasty but the quantity is a bit less. But over all I love it.  One of the DJs plays great numbers. The in-house Beers are really great from the light Amber to the tangy Blondie and strong Republic to the dark ale like roated brew of Brunette. I liked the Mojito (in picture) for the twist in the taste with bits of freshly diced apples and the bottle shaped glass it was served in. I liked the Warm Chicken and mushroom salad (in picture) and the Chicken Satay with Peanut butter Sauce.¬†
I frequent often but sometimes this place can become very very noisy and there are no place to sit. The staff need a bit of training on soft skills too.

Been here couple of times knowing the fact that it is the first micro brewery in the town.

Cons:
The brewed beers were terrible to taste. I have been drinking beers served by microbreweries around the country, and trust me, this got be the worst one i had, It seemed like they mixed water with the beer.

The service was slower than tortoise. The the waiters were not professional at all.

The smoking room was smaller than the room Harry used to stay at his uncle's.

Crowd filtering was no there. Since the location of the place is not that posh, potential-agitators (its just my guess based on their movements) get easy entry.

Pros:
The happy hour timing and discount

This is my third time in here. Price is on a cheaper side. As you can avail happy hours till night. But our concern is waiter behaviour- very unprofessional and not at all sober. My advice to the management is to look upon this with importance.

Nice music, nice beer's especially!!

The music was good, food was good not great. The beer actually grows on you as you go on through the night. People who like strong beer ( myself included ) will not like their beer on the first sip but the aftertaste will make u want to gulp down the whole glass - and to add to all this the beers are super smooth.

They have happy hours till 9pm which is really great. But, there is a catch, when you enter they charge you a cover charge of 1000 bucks each, which is not refundable. So be prepared to waste 100-200 bucks on the final bill as people do not calculate when they eat.

Couldn't not rate it 5 bcoz of the food and for the conversation we had with the manager over the bill at the front desk regarding the cover charge policy.

Since this is the first Microbrewery of Kolkata, i had bookmarked it from sone time, visited it last week in afternoon, the place was quiet empty, with around three tables occupied. 

Ambience: modern, chic but not great
Food: did not order any so cannot say much, but the menu choices were not that great.
Beverage: i liked the craft beer they serve and they also had a happy hour offer going on.
Service: ok, can be better.

Overall i would suggest it for a one time experience.

Amazing place to just hang out with friends. They apparently have their own brewing machines which actually manufacture the beer there. They start off with five different beers for you to taste and then you can actually order the one you like. Always happy !
The service is very good maybe because I've become a sort of regular there. Pricing is very reasonable.
Must visit :)

If you want to have the Best beer in town, head over to Beer republic. Nice decor, soothing ambience, and super awesome in house brewed beer. Amber, blonde, brunette and Republic, taste each one and I bet they will touch your soul. Absolutely love this place. Has become the go-to destination for us pals nowadays.

Ambience & Service: Cozy, comfy but at places, a bit dark. There are a lot of open spaces ill utilized. The smoking room is a tad bit too small. The service is a bit slow and it seems the waiters are not trained well as yet.
Drinks: They have an in-house microbrewery and the house beers are a must try. I tried both the Republic beer and Brunette beer. While republic is a bit sweet (smells of honey), brunette is strong and coffee flavoured. Both are quite good and to be honest, I would prefer these house beers rather than bottled ones any day.
Food: I had Shish touk, Kebab platter and some chicken noodles. All the items were well cooked and perfect to taste. The kebab platter is a must try.

Now this was a tough one! 
I just wanted to rate this place a three because after chugging 4litres of the brewed premium beer we dint feel a bit intoxicated. 
Probably the alcohol percent would be between 3-4% if at all. 
But then I settled for a 3.5 as the beer actually tasted good! 
Me and my colleagues ordered beer battered chicken nuggets and cheese balls for munch and we loved those. 
The ambience is spacious and amiable. 
Will I visit again? With this place just five mins walk from my home. Why not.

First microbrewery of town - and it lives upto the expectations. Located just beside Swabhumi(Knakurgachi) the place is quite spacious and ambience (with dim lights and remix musics) is good. The happy hours start from 12pm. We ordered for "Republic Beer" 1L tower (buy 1 get 1 free) and it was real good.Food was good,tasty and of moderate price.We took "Non-veg kabab platter" and "chicken fried noodles".The kababs were real real juicy and soft.
Parking is free.Overall a nice place to hangout with friends.
Negative aspects : The service needs to be more proactive and well-trained.Smoking room(though I am a non-smoker) is very very small and cannot properly accommodate more than 2-3 persons.

The 1st microbrewery in city. Lots of hopes and hypes and this place conveniently located in the basement of swabhumi lives up to the hype when it comes to the beer. And a bit to the hookah but not so much about the food. The sprawling area provides ample seating arrangements and good music provides nice ambiance for boozing. And they brew it very well, I liked it very much. Tip : Try the Republican if u like strong beer. Serving time is a tad long and the foods are okayish. But one can always go back there only and only for the beer. Anyways a welcoming note for the beer lovers of the city.

We ordered a chilli potato. Served quite cold and didn't seem fresh. Asked them to make it warm, they got it back immediately, still quite cold. Had to ask them to make it warmer the second time. 
Had to ask more than twice for ketchup. 
All in all, you'll find good beer here. But, food and service needs improvement.

Location : Very easy to locate. For a person travelling from South Kolkata, Hyatt is the perfect landmark, right opposite in the lane, next to Swabhumi!

Interior and Service : I had heard a lot about it and very naturally, I had also formed a picture..a perception of the place in my mind! It didn't completely live upto it. A dark place, pretty spacious and ample seating is what you see right as you enter.
Staff was cordial, service was quick but they were slow in understanding/explaining things. A good thing about them was that they well knew their best items. We trusted them while ordering and they didn't let us down!

Beer, Food and Hookah : They have limited number of Hookah flavours. It is prepared in a small base. It was average. 
They offer four of their own beers! I tried the Blonde and the Brunette. The Blonde was rich in taste, I liked the uniqueness of it. The Brunette on the other hand was a dark coffee flavoured beer. I did not like it much. This could be subjective though.
Except the beer, we ordered large pegs of JD and a Black & White.
Coming to food, ordered n number of things. The food overall was delicious. For the starters..Tandoori Aloo, Paneer Tikka, American Corn Salt, and Chilly Cheese Fries! Each of these were amazing in taste. A special mention to the Chilly Cheese Fries, something different and lip smacking.
They also serve proper dinner food! We ordered for Kashmiri Aloo Dum, Malai Kofta, Dal Makhni and Paneer Butter Masala! Each of these were very tasty. Dal Makhni was mouth watering!
For breads, we ordered Butter Nan, Masala Kulcha and Butter Tandoori Roti! Masala Kulcha had great filling which added to the taste of the food.
Food is highly recommended!

Pocket Pinch : Happy Hours that provide one on one is a plus one for this place! Food is moderately  rated. The beer pitcher (1l) costs ‚Çπ650/-, so, technically, you get 2l for ‚Çπ650/- (Happy Hours)! Damn good deal!

You should definitely experience the place with a group of friends by your side and a craving for beer and good food in your heart! Cheers!üçª

Oh my god. ü§ó Finally a microbrewery in the city. Located right beside swabhumi box office this place is easy to locate and extremely spacious. It could easily accommodate a large crowd without any fuss. They have happy hours from 12 in the afternoon (wow üòÇ). You could always ask for tasters before ordering a particular type of beer. The beer is great and the offers are splendid. We had opted for the coffee flavored beer. ( I forgot what it's called. sorry!) The food here is pretty average. We had ordered American chopsuey ( Price wise on the higher end) Now coming to the amazing bit, we were lucky enough to go to part of the pub which is still like minus 6 degrees (the pub which used to exist previously, before beer republic started there) Oh my god! It was insane!üòÇ We were made to wear those heavy coats that one wears in extremely cold temperatures. The interior is lit with green lights and has ice sculptures inside along with couches sculpted out of ice. We had a blast there though in 10 mins we literally couldn't feel our face and exposed bit of our hands and had to come out. üòÇ The staff was extremely cooperative. Special mention to the extremely humble manager who took real good care of us. üòä Would love to visit this place again.

staff-friendly and polite.
ambience-spacious n there is a small second floor type attic is there its very nicely done n a great place for dates.live kitchen is also nice.
food-starters like dry chili chicken n tandoori chicken is quite good but the main course is slightly disappointing risotto is too well cooked n not aldante.n the noodles are blunt.
drinks r not that costly. 
    its a good place to have lunch n little drinks before a movie.

A decent ambience. To beat the hunger ordered only a cheese pizza but ended up disappointed. Never had such pathetic base/crust. The late attendence to every call added to the bad experience.

It's an excellent place to hang out with friends!!

First of all, I would like to rule out some myths about this Pub. 

1.	You need to pay cover charges‚Ä¶.. In reality, they don‚Äôt ask for cover charges

2.	Stags are not allowed‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶  In reality, stags are allowed

We ordered few plates of crispy chili baby corn only, and it was good.

In liquors, we ordered Jameson, J W Red label, Teachers, Balentines, Captain Morgan, BP, Jim Beam, Amber beer, etc. I must admit that they have a vast collection of Liquor.

While entering the store, you will see two big chairs and one big beer bottle. Then turn left, and you will see the place for hangout. Behind the bar counter, you will see the Microbrewery (large tanks). Lots of space is there. Although, we couldn‚Äôt enter into the Ice lounge (I think it was closed then).  In the first floor, you‚Äôll find PS4 and Billiard board. But this pub has a subtle smoking place. 

I know this place is quite expensive, but the experience you‚Äôll get is worth paying the extra bucks. 

P.S- Happy hours discount is only applicable if you get your bill before 9 P.M. (So, please ask for your bill before 9).

Been here a couple of times, once during their happy hours and once just 5mins post 9pm when they strictly turned down any requests of one:one. The beer is good, the Stout which they call Brunette is little mild though. Best of the lot as per our choice is Republic Ale. Finger food is expensive, so go easy on that if on a budget.

Service was slow but decent.Overall impression was good.

Pathetic! Slow service . The "beer" doesnt taste good enough. The food is nothing to die for. The staff behaviour was not even close to be called as decent . The hookah was mild after repeated requests for strong. The Pina colada was served virgin or extremely low on alcohol content during the happy hours. The smoking room is so so so small. You are going to hit your head anytime. The seats weren't comfortable. The music is sad and can depress you.And watch out !The floor has sudden elevations , so you might as well trip n fall.

Located beside Inox Swabhumi this is certainly one of the best bar (cum restaurant) in the city & they also provide you with the experience of a microbrewery. The ambience is nice, very quiet in the early afternoon (I like to enjoy my drink in a quiet place) but buzzing in the evening. The seating arrangements are also spacious but if you want to have food with your drink it's better to get your own table as there's a general tendency to direct a 'Stag' straight to the bar counter & the bar stools are definitely a bit less comfortable. Their service is also good though, typically, you get better service if you become a regular customer. The happy hours are most welcome in a moderately expensive place like this. As expected their beer is the must try item on the menu. From the mild 'Blondee' to the dark & heavy 'Brunette' they each taste amazing & different. I would suggest trying all four varieties atleast once though be careful with how much you want to consume ;-), with the 1+1 offer.

I had been to the place two weeks back with some old friends. Expected the place to be different from others because of its micro brewery something which is new to kolkata . Tried craft beer which was fun. Music was ok. Ambience was not that great. Didn't tried for food so I can't comment on that but the menu variety were quite ordinary .

I was in search of a brewery since I have come back from Bangalore. When I heard the name of Beer Republic and it's location I had became very excited as it is quite near to my house. I have gone there during the happy hours which is of quite a longer duration as compared to others. There were 4 different flavours out of which I preferred Republic beer. They served nicely in a tower. They have barrels to serve as well. My companions ordered 2 litres and we got 2 litres free. Salted nuts and cheese balls were complementary. However I felt the cost of the side dish and main course are bit high and the taste is average. We had Chicken satay and pizza with beer. Not really satisfied with the pizza. However to spend few hours with friends along with chilled beer, it is well recommended.

The concept of Micro Brewery is pretty new in Kolkata and Beer Republic has hit the bulls eye with this concept. The day we visited it was crowded like crazy because Park Street was shut because of the elections. It took us almost an hour to get a seat. The bar tender was good enough to serve us beer till then. We ordered for some starters like pepper garlic chicken and cheese toast. The taste of the food was average and it did take a long time to hit our table. The crowd I believe was more than usual and thus the delay. We ordered for a brain freezer hookah and it was nice. Then we ordered for Beer Republic beer and I must praise the quality of the beer.  It was the first time that I tasted proper draught beer in the city of joy. After a while we got to shift upstairs which was much more pleasant and less crowded. The chicken pasta in white sauce was relishing. The dj floor had a projector where we could watch the IPL match at the same time enjoy the music. There were also people dancing on the dance floor. Overall a nice place to visit with friends if you are in a mood to drink some brewed beer in the city.  We got the Happy hour offer where two litres of beer was served free with the two litres we ordered.  What better offer than this in this sultry heat üòÖ

I had no idea there's a microbrewery in my own city! This place is really spacious which is something I always look forward to and hence a thumbs up from my side. We ordered Pan Fried Chilli Fish which was delicious, the Crispy Chilli Babycorn was okay. From beer cocktails we tried Beer Republic Bomb and loved it :-), next we ordered a glass of  Amber Beer and Republic Beer and since we visited during happy hours it was quite a win win situation for us. The staff was courteous, the only thing is that they should have kept a bit of an eye on cleanliness. Would be visiting this place again for sure.

Ambience is good. It gives you a feel of being at a proper place to hangout with friends. They have 4 types of beer that's being brewed there now. The staff was well behaved and will explain you the details. Also, you can try samples of the brewed beers, which is good. 

But we didn't quite like the food. The American Chopsuey was served with a lot of gravy and the dish was on the sweeter side.

You can also get different choices of hookah in there.

Happy hours 12pm -9pm everyday. ;)

Kolkatas first Microbrewary ,something we have been looking forward to and should be proud of.¬†Located at Swabhumi kakurgachi.,had gone there recently to listen to a live performance and try a few drinks.Decor & Ambiance, wise it looks into all aspects,from small groups, to large,from couples to those who want to sit infront of the stage where the DJ is playing or live performances are enacted. Also a seperate section for family with kids which is well thought of.Then there are those who want a game of pool along with their beer can chill at the pool table aswl alongside those who like being clicked can sit on the king chairs right at the entrance and beer inspired quotes on the wall.Those who like sports can check them out live screening aswl both on the small screen and the projector that screen right on the console which is a damm neat innovation must say.Beer is available in different sized towers and kegs aswl which gives it an authentic look. Service wise they are slowly getting in the groove as they are new and the staff though trained will in time brush up their skills better.Tried the Blondie & Amber beer from their brewery section.The blondie is light with a zippy taste due to the wheat ale present in the ingredient.The Amber though I found more appealing to my choice ,packs a nice punch yet light,which is a sheer delight,it has a much more premium taste. Would recommend also do try their beer cocktails which I plan to on my next visit.I also parceled a plate of mixed schezwan fried rice & chilli chicken which was nice in quantity and quality as well.One thing I really like about this place is it caters to all needs of a nice evening...from karaoke night, to a club to live performances as one sips into the home made brew. Finally kolkata has a place which caters & meets the needs of beer lovers like me.Only thing missing is a wifi,which I think should be definitely addedBill came upto 1265 + taxes for 1 blondie Glass (500ml)+1 amber glass (500 ml) +1 schezwan mixed fried rice + 1 chilli chicken.

The first place in Kolkata to have a functional Microbrewery is good enough for me to give this place a try. One fine evening i ended this wait and visited with a friend. To start with i must say parking is not at all a problem here. They have a huge space just opposite to their gate. As soon as you enter you feel a positive vibe about this place. At the zone of entry they have kept a considerable amount of space free for people to wait during rush hours. The seating area is absolutely huge with a section full of couches and the other section with those high bar stools. The bar is absolutely sprawling and is a treat for those people who enjoy their drinks at the bar counter. They are also a having a small section upstairs. I can say it is an ideal place for sport screening as they have a large projector screen at the DJ Console. Very innovative i must say.

Now coming to their beers, the waiter was courteous enough to gave us testers before we ordered. The Republican and Wheat beer was the best of the lot. Do not go for the dark beer as they have totally messed it up. Management kindly note this. For starters we ordered for a portion of Chicken Wings at first and it was delicious. The chicken pieces was succulent and juicy but the best part was the thin crispy coating on the top. Absolute delight. We also ordered for a portion of Crispy Chilli Corn and it was tasty too. The amount of garlic and chopped onions could be worked upon though. The service can be slow at times but i wont be terming it as disapppointing as the people were very courteous and attending us with a smile everytime we called them. I absolutely enjoyed my time at this outlet and is eagerly looking forward to my next visit. I must congratulate the owners and the management for their fantastic work in making this microbrewery happen.

PS - I could have given this place a full 5 but the absence of a working wifi which compelled me to deduct some point. The management should work upon it asap as this is an absolute turn off.

nice place as per decoration, defcent food. seemed empty . pathetic beers, unfermented and cloudy.i have been tasting beers from all over india served in microbreweries. comes nothing close. generic lager and some half hearted brews. perhaps they have brewers from gurgaon as well handling the place. good choice in liquor though. will be difficult for them to survive with this standard. wish you all the luck

Disaster Dissapointing!!! a big no no!!

Ambience i wouid say was ok. The place on sat nite was packed with live music.

Hookah served was below average.

We ordered for a combo option. According to the combo we could chose anuything frm the drinks, starters and hookah. According to the staff if we chose a drink(all the drinks has to be the same in the combo, so was with the starters). If im taking the combo why would i order the same drink or food again. Isnt it obvious i would try something new if i have the option.

I called the manager to clarify and he was the most rude/arrogant person i have ever come across. According to him that is what the rule is"yeh humara rule hai" and walked off. since it was past midnite and had no option to chose in that area. We stuck to his rules, as we just wanted a couple of drinks and something to eat.

ordered for pasta with extra olives and brocolli. preapartion time was short but the ingredients missing.(not a single piece of brocolli or olives)

need to change the attitude and staff.. there are much bttr places in saltlake and south with courteous staff

This place was on my wish list for quiet some time until i went there this sunday. Kolkata's first microbrewery what an exquisite range of breweries, completely blew my mind off. We savored the amber ale.. it was fruity and tasted spectacular not to mention that it gave us the punch we were looking for. We were there during the happy hours and we drank our hearts out. The food was gorgeous...Especially the moist kebabs. The resident DJ was playing music all through the evening which was decent, suddenly when a pretty lady at around at 8 with her band rendered some melodies and lightened up every one's mood. The whole crowd cheered to her soulful renditions. It simply made our night and was worth every penny. I have seen live bands performing elsewhere but one hardly understands the music as its mostly noisy. This lady, i think her name was Debanjani Lily, was so good with her renditions that one couldn't leave the seats. We all left the place at night in high spirits and looking forward to our next visit soon.

Finally a micro brewery in the city and I am damn happy about it. I entered the place and got introduced to an array of finger food and the kebabs were really good. After experiencing a particular format of dinning options in the city for over years, this place comes as a freshness to enhance your clubbing experience. Music was good but was really looking forward to the dance floor to be open by 10:30 as after the exotic taste of the beer you really feel like grooving to the tunes. My take from the Beer republic is straight communicated to people who are looking to experience fresh brewed beer and come out of the pint cocoon, this place is surely a nextlev option in the city. I am to get back soon.

Food: Fills your tummy, if not your taste bud
Beverage: Ask for the freshly brewed beer samples and choose yours! Recommended if you‚Äôre after something refreshing
Music: Not up to the mark...
Fortunately, live performances are awesome and will make ur day

Does it burn a whole in your pocket? Well the answer is, HAPPY HOURS is till 9 P.M.¬†Njoy :)

A great spot for a pint, mmm...or may be a pitcher, to add some fancy to an otherwise lazy day!

Finally Kolkata has a microbrewery! We were there for almost 3 hours last night and drank ourselves silly on the dark ale (The Brunette). It is a lovely brew. We also tried the Amber ale which was mild and fruity, very tasty though, and good for people who don't want a very strong brew. The dark ale is the sure winner and will definitely go back for it. The place is large but gets full in the late evening. Happy hi hours till 9pm so you can drink a lot. Didn't try much food though apart from some fries. The resident DJ was playing good music in the evening but 8pm onwards there was a terrible band playing cheesy hindi songs which made the whole place feel like a dance bar. I would have given a 4 rating if not for that band. Please get better bands, the city has so many of them.

Service is ridiculously pathetic! It seemed like they were putting in additional efforts to mess up the service. It did not seem like the waiters had ever been trained on how to interact with customers. Most of the times there weren't any acknowledge menu from the waiters once we placed orders. They just walk away! The time taken to serve each order was super-long. The presentation was very very lousy to say the least. We ordered a couple of pizza and the pizza dressings were served on a cracked plate! WHO does that? Then we were on the verge of finishing our pitcher of beer when a waiter came and said he "needed" the empty pitchers so we had to quickly pour the remaining beer into our glasses! Seriously? The service here is a disgrace to the name of hospitality.

There are two good things about this place. The beers. They are good. Specially the smoked and the blonde beers. I live in Bangalore and visit brewpubs there frequently so I more or less know what I'm talking about. The other thing is the price. Maybe it's a Kolkata thing, but with happy hours running till 9pm on Saturday nights the bill came to fraction of what I would spend in Bangalore. But I don't think even the low price would be enough to generate many repeat customers considering the absolutely pathetic service. 

My opinion - the taste of good beer gets overshadowed by the bad taste that the poor service leaves in your mind!

zomato.. i hold great credentials about ur team.. so pl detest from puttin such duped brand in ur list.. first of all.. guys.. its not tht bierre rep.. they just kinda replicated the brand name and trust me.. ppl are gettin in thinkin it to be the bierre and instead its a cheap beer republic.. coming to the review.. worst food.. diluted and stale beer.. pathetic service.. they gor bouncers.. but goodness me they dont know the protocols.. sometimes stags are allowed sometimes they are not.. fluctuating rule book which perhaps they too dnt know..music cant get sick than this.. they dnt knw wat  song dedication is.. the captains if i can at all call them (as its prevalent in hard rock cafe or other reputed pubs and resto)  cdn detail on the crafted beer..the hookah will come with lot of choking sediments.. More Than THAT.. THE SO CALLED IN-CHARGE TONIGHT AT 1 AM MR.  FAROOKH OR SOMETHING.. MAY BE HE IS JUS HAPPY WEARING A SUIT AND TAKING NAMES AT THE COUNTER ADAMANTLY.. THE PROPRIETORS LISTN.. YIU HAVE USED A BIG BRAND FOR UR BENEFIT.. AT LEAST PUT A DECENT TEAM OF PPL AT SERVICE.. GUESS ITS A PUB LOUNGE.. AND NOT JUST A 3RD GRADE DANCE BAR.. WASTED MY TIME.. AND #BIERREREPUBLIC BEWARE..GUESS THEY PLAYING UPTO YOU..

What pathetic service. I'm sitting here, it's been 45 minutes and no beer! First and last time here. Great concept, poor execution. And the waiter is rude!

Food and drinks are good but service is extremely poor. Ordered a plate of French Fries and it was NOT SERVED even after multiple reminders.Finally had to cancel the order. Rest of the food were very good. Ambience is excellent but the service can overshadow all the positive points.

A lot of buzz surrounding this place but sadly it's not at all worth it. Located below Inox Swabhumi(earlier 89cinemas), it's the first microbrewery in Kolkata. I went there with my friend according to whom Beer Republic is a very popular chain in Bangalore. But it was a total disappointment here. We ordered crispy chilli babycorn, corn job grill pizza and a vegetable kebab platter. 
‚Ä¢ Crispy chilli babycorn was neither crispy nor chilly. It was served cold and tasted bland.

‚Ä¢ The pizza was OK. But that too was served cold. The topping was good but the dough not properly baked.

‚Ä¢ The veg platter was probably the only face saver. It had tandoori aaloo (potato), tandoori paneer(cottage cheese) and veg kebab. Tandoori potato was the best of the lot, while kebab was just fine. Paneer I thought was too soft. 
My friend also had beer which was surprisingly not served cold.
Service was mediocre, ambience:dull. Overall a very bad experience.

Pathetic ! Not even a star i'd give for this place. The interior sucks big time, the ambiance is similar to a banquet hall, beer jugs are like water jugs, the staffs have no idea what they serve. Over all bad and cheap vibes. Beer tastes pathetic too.

All the 3 stars are for being the first microbrewery in Calcutta! Otherwise there is a huge scope of improvement! Interior is not that pub-ish! It's more like a family restaurant when you enter. Music is terrible. Well we were informed that good musics will be played after 11. But yeah we couldn't take that risk anyway. Coming to the service.. After 15-20 mins you'll get a feel you are in some local desi bar and you've to walk till the bar counter to place orders. No clue whether the waiters are incapable or reluctant! Well if service is like this, I would be afraid we'll loose the only microbrewery in Calcutta very soon!

Coming to the beers.. Yes they are pretty good. As of now four variances are there. Hope they'll come up with more! Price wise also decent. 700-800 per head would absolutely do! 

And remember they don't have desserts ;)

Beer Republic is located on the ground floor of Inox Swabhumi building. This is a comparatively new place, and is slowly gaining momentum. I came to know about the place only recently and was pretty shocked to know that there was a micro brewery here, on the lines of Toit or Arbour brewery of Banglore. 
The place was deserted when we entered, which was around 2pm. The seating space is huge , which includes a first floor, a family space and high tables too. The overall ambience of the place is cool, with dim lighting and gud music (occasionally, that was screwed up too). 
There was a feeling that the place isn't running smoothly since there was confusion among the staff, most of them not knowing what each item on the menu is, the music stopping occasionally, the volume of the music going up and down, delays in serving the food, etc etc. Maybe they'll get it right over a period of time. 
Now about the food, we ordered a farmhouse chicken pizza, a pepper chicken pizza &  fish n chips. In the beverages section, we took the amber beer and some black dog ( both of which had a buy 1 get 1 free option ;-) )
We had some hookah also to go with, which was also on the offer of buy 1, get 1.
Amber beer : the best part was that they gave a tasting option at the beginning.we chose amber beer after tasting all their options. The amber beer was pretty smooth and tasty and not too sour or sweet. It had a good strong flavour too. 
Hookah: we tried the brain freezer and one kiwi something hookah based on the suggestion of a friend. It was also pretty decent.
Pepper chicken pizza : it was perfect. The right combination of cheese, chicken and veggies. The base was a bit thick thou.
Farmhouse chicken pizza : the staff didn't know what difference was there, neither could we tell. It wasn't as good as the pepper chicken pizza. 
Fish n chips : pretty nice. Well cooked and just the right proportion of batter to fish. Most place had 10% fish and 90% batter.
Pros :
1. A micro brewery is a welcome change from the regular bars/pubs
2. Huge seating space
3. U have a pool table (costly thou),  play stations, etc
4. Food is pretty good
5. Good ambience
6. Sufficient parking space
7. Happy hours !
Cons:
1. Service is not smooth yet. Be ready for a lot of confusion
2. If u r sitting in the first floor, bring some earplugs too. The speakers are right next to the tables and the music volume keeps fluctuating. 
3. Place is not that cheap

Coming from Bangalore, I had huge expectations from the first microbrewery of Kolkata. Honestly, i went back hugely disappointed. 
To begin with, the ambience is good, the seating is comfortable and they play pretty decent music. So no complaints on these fronts.
Now let's move on to food and beverage. The brewed beer they served tasted more like a fruit juice and less like a freshly brewed beer. The veg platter we ordered was also strictly average. There was hardly any surprises in the menu as all they had were the regular dishes which are served everywhere. Plus they take ages to serve them. We received our starters after 35 minutes
Hookah was just fine. I mean there's hardly a way one can go wrong with hookah, so no points for that.
Overall, not a great experience. Just an average affair !!

Finally, a microbrewery in Kolkata. Got my favourite wheat beer in my own city, the tasters provided do not do justice to the actual beer, which ends up tasting far superior. The Wheat beer, marketed as Blonde Beer here, is a must try and for that alone I am giving it 3.5 stars. However, fill up your tummy before arriving, the food is definitely a no-no. Chicken popcorns are served as chicken koftas, 5 big balls basically, even the biriyani tastes like one served outside Sealdah station.

It's a must visit for beer lovers, foodies can pass

Kolkata is definitely coming up with great places to hang out. Loved he ambiance and decor of the place. Also, the first micro brewery ¬†place within Kolkata i visited and i absolutely loved it. This place reminds of one of the major popular hangouts from Bangalore called Toit, it also had a brewery.

So coming on to the food, alcohol and Hukka - the hukka was great, averagely priced, the alcohol was good, we had something from the brewery and it was good but the pricing is on the higher side. The food was decent, not something to talk about. The music was amazing and the screens setup for ¬†the IPL matches added to the USP of the place.

I would say a must visit place with a gang of your friends. Happy Munchin :)

Cheers !

Good place, nice ambience, good music, friendly host...... Now food...I tried few of the dishes.... I would rate it 4.5/5..... Pepper chilly dry is a must try..... Soft chunky chicken....
Beer.... I had visited many microbreweries in Bangalore..... Different variants... Two names that tops my list is 'Brewsky' and 'Toit'. But never mind.... City of Joy too has some of its kind....the Craft beer is unique I would rate it '3/5' I tasted the Republic and the Blonde....Republic was good... But Blonde did not match it's taste..... The fruit extracts seemed more on the higher side.... May be it needed a bit more brewing.... What definitely will attract me is the Hosts and the Happy Hours.....Buy one Get one..... :)

Omg I guess I haven't been to a pub so utterly as this one ever! Such an utter disappointment ! 
First
If you have trunks and trunks of money please be my guest to go and waste them 
Second 
Food .. I would rather prefer food from any nearby chowpatty than here
Third
Alcohol!
O please give me a break
After having visited almost every happening pubs of the city and many other brewery pubs of other cities I can reassure you  all of one important fact that beer republic is one of the worst place ever opened in the city of joy!
Fourth
Con owners and business strategy!
Charging your customers to pay a cover charge of 2k and forcing them to meet the bill amount upto 2k even when they aren't satisfied with anything you serve, won't help you climb the ladder and go any closer to any of the happening pubs in town!
Fifth
Slow claps for the awesome courtesy shown by the manager and owner of the place towards their customer
Really a long slow clap!! I'm amazed as to how could they behave so miserably with their customers who comes to spend their precious money to be wasted in such a miserable place!
If you are a real drinker and loves good environment please do avoid this place as Kolkata has to offer loads of good places.
You would better have a house party with good alcohol than come to this disgusting place!

Finally a nice place to hangout with friends, enjoy an evening over a glass of beer after watching a movie at Swabhumi.. an exciting addition to the dull surroundings given you either need to walk up to Mani Square or some place in Sector 3.. However all that hype seems to die down the longer you spent time inside.. Firstly, they have two separate seating area, one Lounge area and another Open-seating but due to some strange reason they allow guest in the Open only after 7pm.. the inside is well built, big led projections, a DJ playing way too loud music, to the point of being unbearable.. The seatings are good, nice, large comfy couches.. Service needs to improve, a bit lackadaisical and not completely seasoned of their menu..We had:
Sauted Vegetables: A bit too salty, the portion was good and they customised the dish according to our taste but need to improve on the flavours..
Pan Fried Chilli Fish: Better, nice, crisp tangy cubes of fish..sauted with capsicums and onions.. perfect to go with your drinks..
Robustini: Coffee flavoured, mixes vodka, kahlua, coffee and hazelnut syrup.. Loved the blend and the presentation.. might be a bit bitter for some people's palate..
Alongwith it we ordered a peg of Jim Beam White.. Good thing is they have some Combo Offers going on for the Cricket Screenings and HAPPY HOURS is available on the entire Menu..
Definitely will give it a try once more..thing is they need to work on their Food and the Ambiance.. Also the Bouncers at the entrance may shamelessly nag you for extra tips..
Our total cheque comes to Rs.1220/- (all incl) for 2 people..
Food: 2.5/5
Pricing: 3.5/5
Service: 3/5
Ambiance: 3.5/5

This place was an utter disappointment to me not only because of their food but also I found it dull compared to similar joints in south Kolkata!!!

Located beside KK's Fusion and Inox Swabhumi...On entering,one can hear loud peppy music but after being seated for a while,we realized that the place lacked buzz and the bar looked terribly boring...The bartender did not look lively or enthusiatic as one would expect in such a place..There are small TV screens and a giant screen where a match was going on..

We just had a couple of beers followed by a starter...Chicken satay with Peanut butter sauce.It was served after 30 minutes of ordering and was burnt..The peanut butter sauce was extremely thick which doesn't go with the dish at all!!!

They need to really buckle up and re-do the entire place if they want to improve their rating!!!

I would start like this-
I was planing to take my friend to a good place ,rather than simply going to park street..which is unnecessarily too costly and too far from sector- 5,salt lake.

So i have done some research and saw this place on zomato and called them.
The good experience started from their only. I was welcomed on the call very gracefully . We went at 8pm in eve,the crowd,music,service everything was going perfect.
My friends also decided that this is the best place in kolkata in terms of all concerns and soon its gonna beat Roxy club n all :) provide they bring DJ chetas , DJ NYK kind of big names ;) hahaha Thanks BEER REPUBLIC, c y soon..#stayblessed

Just returned.... NO, I'm not high. I'm in my full senses ;) Located at Swabhumi, this new joint needs real upgradation. 50% of the foods described in their menu aren't available. Not even their own brewed beers!! We ordered for a pitcher of 'Brunette Beer', but had to settle for Budweiser lastly :( Prawn tandoori n Chicken satay were undercooked too. Loud meaningless DJ. Children as small as 4-6 yrs were freely roaming within the pub. I mean what the f**k! A bitter experience! Don't go.

The service is good but the dj plays the music loud and sometimes monotonous too. The smoking arena is too stuffy  in real sense. The food is good in taste but drinks are priced for 30ml. The ambience needs to be better too. Would go there once in a while as the ambience matters.

I would start like this-
I was planing to take my friend to a good place ,rather than simply going to park street..which is unnecessarily too costly and too far from sector- 5,salt lake.

So i have done some research and saw this place on zomato and called them.
The good experience started from their only. I was welcomed on the call very gracefully . We went at 8pm in eve,the crowd,music,service everything was going perfect.
My friends also decided that this is the best place in kolkata in terms of all concerns and soon its gonna beat Roxy club n all :) provide they bring DJ chetas , DJ NYK kind of big names ;) hahaha Thanks BEER REPUBLIC, c y soon..#stayblessed

A wonderful place to go to if you need a good night out. The ambience is peppy and very welcoming. The drinks are fabulous and the rates are very reasonable. The ice bar is the place that takes me to another world completely. Need a nice place to party? Just go over there and shake that booty ;)

Just returned.... NO, I'm not high. I'm in my full senses ;) Located at Swabhumi, this new joint needs real upgradation. 50% of the foods described in their menu aren't available. Not even their own brewed beers!! We ordered for a pitcher of 'Brunette Beer', but had to settle for Budweiser lastly :( Prawn tandoori n Chicken satay were undercooked too. Loud meaningless DJ. Children as small as 4-6 yrs were freely roaming within the pub. I mean what the f**k! A bitter experience! Don't go.

Beer Republic a relatively new place in the city...located just beside the Swabhumi Inox,not at all difficult to locate.Went there last sunday for a Valentine's Day special event as it was Valentine's Day the place was obviously well decorated,and the music was awesome.We had hookah and drinks so can't really comment about the food but the ambience was rocking.I just wish they had a bigger smoking zone,it gets really stuffed if 4-5 people gets inside.

If there is a place wherein you want clueless staff come to Beer Republic.I had gone there as part of a promotional campaign that there would be happy hours until 9 o clock.I went there with friends.Ordered few rounds of beer .When the bill arrived there was no happy hour discount.On being told that there was a marketing mailer in the day newspaper they said they weren't aware of it.So we end up paying the total amount.The people that are around there are  a complete  horror story altogether

I went there basically hearing it's name, so could get a brewed beer, but they had not started yet, by asking there employee they didn't knew when it will be starting, just told soon. Outlet is very spacious and cosy. Ambience was good. Staffs were friendly. We had ordered Veg kebab platter, Crispy Chilli Babycorn, and cheese garlic bread in starters. Chilli garlic noodles and crispy Chilli potatoes with American corn( potatoes were not at all crispy) in main course. And in beverages coastal iced tea. Music was very irritating as they were playing the same song again and again. The person who was serving didn't knew how to serve, as food was falling down again and again. They also had a different section for family to have there food.

Went there yesterday , that is on a Monday night . A bad choice maybe , but not that much . 

Located at Inox Swabhumi , ground floor , the name calls out to the beer lovers walking by . 

The first thing you notice is the space , lots of it , the comfy sofas , the space between the tables , the elevated dais for the DJ , the open well designed bar and lots of dancing space just in front of it . 

However , what is such a turn off is that they have not yet started the in house brewed beer even though it is mentioned very well in both the online and offline menus . This is very misleading and also irritating to some extent.

So , after the initial disappointment , we sat down and ordered a tower of Miller beer and pan fried chilli fish. The beer as always was exquisite and a treat to the taste buds. The fish was nothing special . I would go a step further to say it was below average.

What pleasantly surprised me was the in house DJ playing some very cool techno pop music . So went out of my way to say hi to him . The force was strong with him.

So , the place seemed real cool . Monday night , so crowd was minimal . But , on the weekend ,the place could really light up . 

Will look forward to be there on a weekend but only if they stop misleading people with their promises of brewed beer . Remove items from the menu if you have no intention of serving them. That is the only reason for the bad rating . No hard feelings.

Do not fall into the trap of Brewed Beer, it is just an eyewash, they have not started it yet. Kingfisher and Heineken are your only options.
Ambience is noteworthy. Price is slightly on the higher side. Music is regular EDM and Techno. But, surprisingly I found a gentleman playing flute in the evening and he was a very sharp musician. Salud sir, if you happen to read this.
Special Tip:. Target the happy hours from 12-9. Do not order Brain Freezer in the shisha section, it makes you sleepy.

I feel going by the name they should atleast have every beer on the menu available. Though not an issue. Food is really good. Be it pizza or babycorn. Even the north indian had amazing taste. They don't provide bill for hookah which is unusual for me. As u get bill almost in every other lounge. Other than that great place.

Good ambiance. That's it. They got a huge menu but had 2 beers only. They have a menu for freshly brewed beer, but guess what they don't have any. Rates are decent enough. Drinks also have the same condition, huge menu but serves only 8 to 10 brands. Really disappointed.

Firstly,they served the hookah(sheesha) without charging the coal so I had to call that guy to fix that up..
I had ordered for mix-sauce veg pasta,they charged me for non veg pasta with meat balls..
"Teen paan" was mentioned and is used as a single flavour everywhere..they charged it as 3 separate flavours..
They don't give a proper bill for the hookah ..on being questioned,one of their staff was quite rude and shamelessly admitted that this is how they function and its not necessary that you get a bill everywhere .. I mean really??then what is the difference between a roadside eatery and a proper lounge..he also cross-questioned me back asking sir do you want to fight for this small issue ?..that too in an impolite manner.. I mean asking for a legitimate bill from a service provider is a crime???? I never had a problem paying 200-300 bucks extra when it comes to getting good services..infact I offered him to take 100 bucks extra as tips and get me a proper bill..but such kind of attitude from a hospitality outlet is just  not acceptable..and overcharging,mis-information and not giving a proper bill for the services is cheating or fraud which we highly comdemn...

How can a place that's called Beer Republic offer only three brands of beer ? The person who attended us shrugged and said that they have been around only for a week and things will take some time to warm up. What kind of an excuse is that ? Aren't you supposed to work doubly hard to make an impression if you are new?

Beer Republic is the newest addition to the city's resto-pub-lounge-hookah-bar bandwagon. While the spacious area, semi-plush (& stylized) decor & an extensive menu might make this seem like a promising place to visit in the future, currently the vibe and feel it exudes is mostly glitz & not much class.

During our visit no continental food was available, most of the beers mentioned in the menu were not available & whatever was available felt fairly expensive (Carlsberg 330ml is 250INR + Taxes). Service was also a point where a lot of improvements can be done.

Here's hoping that the promised micro brewery is opened soon. Meanwhile the place could do with a lot of improvements.
