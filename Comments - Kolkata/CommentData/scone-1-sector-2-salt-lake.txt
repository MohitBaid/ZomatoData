Though the quantity was good, quality left lot to be desired... At best the quality was equivalent to any road side temporary/ordinary shops specifically noodles and garlic/ginger fish items. Quality wise I will rate it as one on a scale of 5.

Just beside 206 Bus stand. A small outlet mainly for takeaways. You get fast food to dinner in this place. A life saver for the commoners during the evenings.
I generally munch dinner from this every week. The food is very good.
Evening Munching - If you do not hate oil or rich food then you should munch enough from this outlet. The quantity is also quite sufficient for fulfilling the need of you stomach.
The only thing i hate this place is for the price tag that is attached for every dinner item. It is so damn expensive for a single person having dinner. Also the quantity is too much for a person and they don't even serve half plates for some of these items. Excluding the price tag, the outlet is quite good.

One must try their chicken bharta, it is very good. Their chicken roll , gravy chicken chowmein is also very delicious. Though they don't a seating arrangement. U can pack your food and have it at your home... usually crowded during the evenings. Staffs are pretty good in nature , but I would say that their packaging is not good enough. But in terms of food, one must try them. Not much costly. 250 for two if u add non veg .... deducting points because they don't have any seating arrangement and no proper packaging

It's how a general street side joint is, decent price, serves street styled chinese , snacks and rolls. Most of the times I pick a roll or cutlet from here when I'm on the go and they don't disappoint. Their rolls have a tinge of mustard sauce which makes it taste better. 

They provide home delivery as well and serve generous servings of meat, rice and noodles whatsoever.

I came to know about this outlet next to Bus Stop 206 - AJ Block, Salt Lake from one of my friends.

I was a bit reluctant to try but the crowd outside gave me some assurance. And of course Zomato logo at the counter gave ready reckoner.

Quality food for the reasonable price, they offer. The serving time is much less than other comparable outlets. You have ample option to choose from their menu. 

Chicken Tikka Rolls are must try. Rolls have ample stuffing which makes it perfect for relieving hunger pangs. Thus makes their Rolls special .

Price was dirt cheap and quality was high on par compared to similar outlets. 
Only thing for such takeaways, order taking is a complete chaos due to huge rush and servers tend to be confused among the orders. 

Recommended !!

A good place for grabbing a quick bite. Located near the 206 bus stop in AJ block, this place has a elaborate menu and quick service. There is a seating for about 2-3 people so it is Predominantly a take away counter . 

The food is good, I had their Chicken Momo and the Egg Kebab Roll. The roll was not oily at all which is a good thing. The Momos too had generous filling. 

In a nutshell, a good place for a snack or even ordering in .

You are alone at home, feeling lazy to cook or family friends visit you and want a quality food trust me you can blindly order anything from the menu list. I have been staying for 3 years in Salt Lake and ordered food a hundred times from scone and every time it has lived upto my expectations. Yesterday night 25th January 2017 I ordered chicken prawn chowmin with gravy at around 10:20 pm via Zomato and I got a delivery within 20 minutes. As usual packing was fantastic. Pocket pinch most nominal in Salt Lake. Taste wise top notch. 

Few dishes I immensely crave for are chicken lollypop, garlic chicken, crunchy chicken and chicken 65. The chicken roll is amazing too. Perhaps the best home delivery services in Salt Lake vicinity. I love to order food from Scone and even encourage my friends to do the same.

Ordered for the first time. Egg Hakka Noodles and Chilly Chicken Gravy. Mentioned clearly the food should be LESS SPICY. Sigh..!!Â Home delivery service was almost on time. The first thing I noticed.. Cheap paper box and foil packing that's leaking oil and the bill is partially drenched in it. I told the delivery guy that it is market standard to deliver at least in plastic containers. This paper packets and leaking foils are not at all hygienic and acceptable. Obviously he had nothing to say. I immediately unpacked the food and replaced the oil soaked packages. The attached pics clearly reveal how oily Â and spicy the food was. Honestly .. this was my first and the last time order at Scone. Pathetic...!

And now about the Biriyani....Was it mutton biriyani really ????Yaah thanx for the salad,but am not happy with the quality of food..No taste at all.And the mutton Â was only a piece of bone which was covered with spices.It makes the mutton also tasteless.It was my first time and will be the last time also...

Well, got the reference from a colleague when I was actually looking for good food . I ordered quite a few times from Scone and all that I can say is it serves good food. Quantity of Biriyani is a bit less compared to other restaurants but it is less spicy and tasty. I also tasted few dishes of Mushroom they are yummy! When you are hungry and is around Scone, definitely give it a try!!

Well, thanks to Dipyaman (fellow Zomatian) and his review of Scone, I decided to order food for office delivery from this place for the first time today. After much scanning of their menu uploaded to Zomato, I finally decided to go for their Kadhai Paneer as well as Veg Pulao (using Zomato online ordering). My stuff was delivered in an hour or so â€“ free delivery, mind it! 

Packing was fine (again, no extra charges for that) and food looked a beauty, quantity as well as quality being good. Paneer was just too nice â€“ with a decent mix of other vegetables (capsicum, onions etc) and also a pinch of sugar â€“ I really had a difficult time sharing my paneer with others! Veg pulao was again fine, the only drawback that I do not enjoy dry fruits in pulao. I had ordered veg pulao and not the Kashmiri one, so I did not really expect kaju and kishmish in it! Nevertheless, it was fine.

Prices are not high and service is fine, I wish best of luck to this outlet.

I have been a regular customer of this outlet for more than a year now. When it first started, they were able to deliver food within 30 minutes, which later increased to an hour and then to 90 minutes. I took it as a sign of how popular the outlet had become that it was not able to keep up with its quick home delivery. 

It has, however, lost all its goodwill as it failed to deliver the order I had placed yesterday for dinner. I had called them at 9:23 pm and had placed an order for chilli chicken and chicken chowmein. They have delivered food at my doorstep many, many times so the excuse that they couldn't find my address doesn't hold water. In fact, no matter how busy an outlet gets, not fulfilling the delivery of an order that they've accepted is inexcusable. They did not even have the decency to call and apologise for not being able to deliver the food. I'm deeply disappointed with such callousness and the least that they can do now is issue an apology for such a lackadaisical attitude. 

P.S. My home is only 1.2 km from their outlet and it takes me 15 minutes to reach there on foot. I hope this review serves as a reminder to the staff that no customer, no matter how regular he is, should be taken for granted. Please get your act together.

Rolls and Kebabs are good
But when I ordered Chinese food, it was disappointing.

Taste is a let down and the gravies are just full of sauces and no other tastes can be found.
Fried rice and schezwan rice are not up to the mark.
Biriyani doesn't live up to the expectations.

Complete disappointment.

The food is good! In fact, just had my dinner and came back to desk to a write a review (yes, I am in office)! Forgot to take a photo because I was hungry( I always am). Ordered Mutton biriyani and chicken do piyaja. The biriyani rice was too much for a single person and I had got a a piece of fat (read rubbery) piece of mutton. But I liked the cleanliness. Chicken was too good, Onions were heavenly. This is my first order from Zomato. Zomato said the order will be delieverd at 8.18. I got a call from the delivery guy at 8.18. Would love to eat there again!

Scone happens to be the food heaven to local residents here in and around 206 No. Bus Stand, as Ex-Zest, which was earlier located near Kwality Bus Stand was at that location (including likes of me). They are mostly popular for serving delicious oil-free rolls (And I mean oil-free) and some lipsmacking Chinese delicacies.

I have been here twice. The location is simple. If you are coming from Kathgola Island to 206 Bus Stand, cross the terminus and take the turn to the left. Walk a few steps and this should be to your left right at the corner of the lane you took when it again taken another left turn. In short, this is just located straight from the entrance of Zest.

If anyone has his/her reservation towards oily paranthas, he/she should come over here. The Parathas are complete oil free. They are fluffy and is just like how the structure of Lachcha should be. Take the Chicken Kebab Roll if you prefer the Boti Kebabs or take the simple Chicken Roll, which isn't that good. I had also ordered some simple Chinese Items like Noodles and Manchurian, but unfortunately, there packing was a disaster/massacre/absolute catastrophe. I do not live much far away, and by the time I went back home the carry bag was a massacre and half the food item was spoiled. I could taste whatever remained intact, but by then I had lost all my enthusiasm.

The items didn't taste bad but I was in no mood to enjoy my meals. The pricing here is decent and the staffs are also cooperative. They however, do not have any provision of Cold Drinks, which I feel is a must after having a hearty roll. Owing to the popularity, don't see any reason of not to recommend here to try their rolls. As for as take-away goes, be careful!

Their quality varies I must say from day to day.
Someday the chicken is soft and tender, someday its hardened.
One thing is good that they deliver on time and mostly hot food. We generally request office deliveries and they never fail.

Good for a snack time.

This is my favourite food delivery joint in my locality. I live in kestopur barowaritola and this restaurant in 206 bus stand is simply serving my sudden food habits. Thanks to them for no minimum order value delivery policy. I've even ordered as low as a simple egg roll but they happily crossed the foot bridge and delivered me the precious timely food. 
Thanks to scone once again. Keep up the performance.

Don't forget to have chicken kabab roll here. It's really great. Other dishes like chicken kati kabab are good too. Will recommend my friends.

Grew up eating at this place as its in my neighborhood!!! Way back in my school days it used to be a small cart by the AJ park which grew up to the stall it is today. They even provide catering services at weddings nowadays. They did catering for one of my neighbor s wedding. It was very good. The food quality has improved over the years. The chicken roll n veg rolls r my favorite , huge in size... It is always a nostalgic neighborhood shop for me which has always satisfied my evening snacks cravings!!! All the best to scone for further growth in years to come!!

It's very easy to locate, near 206 bus stand... bad news was that there South Indian dishes will be not available any more as there cook left there branch... Nothing to say about deco... service was good... staffs are well behaved too... the place was little unhygienic.... but they are trying there level best to maintain the hygiene... have there rolls and egg devil it's very good... surely will be there for having other items too... pocket pinch was low....

I had ordered a chicken tandoori. I had it delivered at my place. The tandoori was good enough. But they don't provide chutney with it.   Overall the service and food was good enough.

This is one of my favourite place for everything lunch dinner & rolls and all . The most good thing is that this is in my block . The other shop is also near to my house . The amount they serve is pretty good . And they deliver the food in right time.

I was not aware of Scone but while passing by came across the same. Was reluctant to try but looking at crowd outside gave us some assurance. Ofcourse Zomato logo at outside counter gave ready reckoner.
Our major intention was to get some quick bites and starters. We picked up Egg Devil, Fish Fry, Chicken Lollypop, Egg Chicken Kebab Roll, Mixed Fried Rice and Chilli Chicken.

Egg Devil: A cult classic among bong foodies with slice of egg inside and crispy coating.
Fish Fry: Another thing comes as first thing in mind when we bongs think of finger food. Here what I liked the fact they have mentioned both categories using original bhetki and cheaper alternative bhola bhetki in the menu. At many places they claim bhetki by giving cheaper alternative. Tastewise was mind boggling. What was disappointing is the original bhekti option was not available.
Chicken Lollypop: The drumsticks made from chicken wings had right amount of spice and accurate portion of batter for the crispiness. The sauce was mild spicy too.
Egg Chicken Kebab Roll: I must confess this is the best roll I ever had in Kolkata. Huge paratha flaky yet soft stuffed with kebabs.
Mixed Fried Rice: This is no frill fried rice with chicken, prawn and egg with vegetables. 
Chilli Chicken: Succulent boneless pieces of chicken in mild spicy gravy was yummilacious.

Price was dirt cheap and quality was high on par compared to Aahar from we used to get food frequently. Only thing for such takeaways order taking is a complete chaos due to huge rush and servers tend to be confused.Â Good to see they are promoting Zomato too by providing carry bags for packing and takeaways.

A street corner Food Zone right at 206 Bus terminus. Its more of an Takeaway/Home delivery Place. Very well located and very good staff. I have been here to eat in morning as well as at night. The Food is just perfect and price quoted at perfect for daily eat. If you pay 100 bucks at end of long and tiring day to eat something that not only stimulates your taste buds but alsoÂ  kills the hungry mouses in your stomach. 
A good food joint is one where food served is delicious and staff is so courteous which makes you visit them again and again.
I hope this food joint makes great names and grows for best.

I have seen this place come up from a small thela - to a standard size restaurant. I am a regular of the other Scone - which happens to be older , in BJ market. However I am extremely disappointed with this new shop's service. They are generally churlish about the way they interact. I had once ordered for dinner ( 5 dishes) out of which 4 reached my home and of that the chicken Manchurian was stale. I informed the person , who then profusely apologised, however forgot to resend the missed delivery and the Manchurian the next day , as promised by him. Maybe good for a quick roll or kebab - but I discourage others to order dinner . better call up the one in BJ market - they never disappoint .

Best thing I liked about them is customization for things which are not in the menu, as per order like a chili fish roll. Fried Idli with Chilli Chicken, Fried Idli with Chilli Fish. Fried Idli in chinese chilli style. Devilled egg roll.

This is the refurbished outlet of Scone outlet at the same location that used to be a smaller one. Their fast food is quite good and the quality is decent for an outlet like this. Their preparations are oily than normal but it's delicious most of the times and it's very pocket friendly. The kitchen is completely visible to the crowd and is clean and hygienic. With a couple of openly placed tables and some tools, it is a great place for winter evening to have a seat and enjoy their fast food.

Scone is the best place to order from while you are enjoying your time with your buddies at home. Overall, a nice food joint to get used to.

Scone is a small shop near 206 Bus stand famous for it's rolls. I ordered a chicken roll initially but after seeing the Chicken Kebab roll I could not help but change my order and I was not disappointed. The roll was quite filling and tasty. The taste left me and my husband hungry for more food so we ordered Drums of Heaven, Devil Egg and Prawn fried rice. The prawn friend rice was enough for 2 people. Taste wide I would rare it a 4 out of 5.
Devil's egg was alright, nothing to be very elated about. Drums of heaven was quite good and spicy. They serve 6 pieces of these.  I was a little disappointed because 1 of them was not cooked properly and felt like eating raw batter.
Given the quantity and the taste the pricing is decent and won't leave a hole in your pocket.
I would definitely go back to Scone to try the rest of their preparations!

Sadly, I'm forced to lower my rating from 4.5 to 3.5 for this eating joint. For the past 4-5 months this place has kept disappointing me. It was one of the better eateries in saltlake sector 1, 2 area, but recently their quality has dropped a lot. 

Â I remember their once perfectly delicious chicken bhartas, chicken chowmeins and south-indian dishes among many other dishes. Now, they dont make south-indian, take around an hour to deliver food ( though I stay just 10 mins away), and thier indian curries are oddly all similar in taste. For example, the chicken bharta which is supposed to have buttery taste and look is similar to the chicken curry, red and too spicy. With prices at par with the better restaurants, I can't even consider the dwindling quality of the food for 'value for money'. 

I'm still keeping my previous review as it is, though it is irrelevant now:
Â A great place for light snacks and rolls. And affordable chinese food for delivery or take-away. Their new south-indian menu is good too. I specially like their garlic chicken, chicken rolls and butter masala dosa. Though I'd like it more if they were more generous with the cheese in the cheese dosa.

Finally, they are on Zomato.Â 
Well, what to say it's near to my house, and I have been a faithful customer for years. They don't even ask for my home address anymore, even they have it memorized.Â 

Recently, they added south indian in the menu, which I haven't really tried out yet.Â 
But, apart from that, well the basic chinese is good, they make it simple.Â 
But my favourites from them would be the chicken gravy chowmein, and chicken bharta. You ought to try these once.Â 

It's known for it rolls, as the place is haunted by office goers going back home, and to me they first introduced the concept of a veg roll, with a stuffed veg nuffet inside.Â 

With many more years to come, this is undoubtedly the best, friendly eatery, and of course they at least take 60% of my home delivery orders.

Nice place for having some evening snacks but  I wont recomend the place for dinner .. Only drawback is , half plate side items (gravy) like chicken gravy are not available. U need to take a full plate even if u r having it alone. Foods tastes realy nice if u r comparing with road side junk foods.
