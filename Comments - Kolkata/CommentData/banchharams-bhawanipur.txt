Situated at Jadu Babur Bazar, this is a nice place to have quick-time snacks and sweets. Been here a few times. I don't know whether they still make the paneer roll, which was quite delicious.

Radhaballavi of this place is my favourite. The authentic Bengali sweet and spicy taste gets you filled in like just 40 bucks and you can even dig into any one of the gur sandesh.

Banchharam's is one of my favourite sweet shop brands and I definitely stop by their outlets especially for their  mishti doi and jibe goja! I also tried a few other things from here!
❤In this heat, their mishti doi is such a relief to both the toungue and the heart! Out of all the sweet shops I know there's is the creamiest!
❤Their jibe gojas are yummy! They are so thin and the ghee and syrup together with the crispiness of the goja make the entire experience worth endearing!
❤ The thekuas here are best had warmed! They are both hard and crisp and have a great taste!! 
❤ Lastly, I tried their mihidana cake! It's a super soft cake with a mihidana layer! Garnished with almond flakes!Its superb!
Do try these items,you wouldn't be disappointed!

Good thing about this place Banchharam is a traditional sweet corner its brand is running from more than 25 years as per my knowledge. 
I often have Parahmtha and sabzi with misti dahi, which we like the most, many types of sandesh such as chocolate, chena and many more types of sandesh, for diabetic people sugar free sandesh also. They are now coming up with so many types of fusion sweets and most recently they have come up with Nalen Gur in tube version. Really interesting. 
After so many years in Kolkata bancharam is brand now and we love it always.

I have observed a drastic improvement in the quality and variety of sweets and savouries available at banchharam. Added to that, they have introduced price tags, which was missing earlier.. I really like their veg puffs and mihidana pantua slice. If you are at banchharam and want to try only two different items, they should be mihidana pantua slice and baked mihidana.

This is a branch of the famous chain sweet shop in Kolkata. Their samosas and vegetable chop are always fresh and very  bengali in taste. Also fond of their mishti doi and rajbhog, although some of their sandesh's leave a lot to be desired.

Located at Bhawanipore, Bancharam has been quite popular in the last couple of years and has emerged as a big name due to the fact of serving ghee made sweets. Tried a couple of Sandesh here and some fried sweets as well on the go. The quality has gone down a bit, but the sweets still tastes quite good.

No sitting arrangement, no enthusiastic staff, no crowd, average quality, no fun.

I'd prefer local confectioneries over this store anyday. I tried a few sweets there. But even though I am not a Bengali, I know this is not even close to the sweet-standards of this city. My recommendation, stay away from this place.

It was beautiful looking sweet shop quite big but no sitting arrangement only space for stand and eat. Ambitious was very nice and also hospitality was very good. Service was quick and staff were very friendly and helpful. They serves pure bengoli sweets which were made of desi ghee, pure meva and pure chhena. On compare to taste and quantity price of sweets was affordable. Their sweets were very delicious. I liked the most their rossogulla, sandesh and gulabjamun. Rich experience here. Totally loved it. Highly recommended to all.

This my favourite destination for sandesh. It makes many kind of sandesh and sweets. Perfect combination of sugar, softness and freshness make it great. I prefer Abar Khabo Sandesh. All sandesh are delicious and fresh but quite costlier. This shop's has many outlets in Kolkata with a great ambiance.

When you have the guts to open up your outlet right next to one if the biggest confectionarys in town, you have got to be good!
The sweets may cost a little more than the regular shops but the quality of them is unquestionable and also so much variety.
Makes life for sweet-toothed people easier,and Kolkata more Mishti :)

Simplicity can bring Sophistication to Sweetness. And Banchharam is it.
I have tasted almost all the forms of sweetness they choose to offer as I frequent this outlet almost every Tuesday ! Be it Sandesh,Tarts,Mousse,Lyangcha, or any other innovative sweet I unfortunately can't remember to name - Banchharam has NEVER disappointed. I heart their freshness and hospitality of staff.
Great competition to Balaram Mallick located right next to it .

It's one of the famous bengali sweet brand of the city. The store is newly opened in the locality and is giving a good computation to other sweet shops. Talking about the sweets its too good. It always have the correct amount of sugar in all of the sweets. The best part of this store is that all of the items are fresh but keeps very little stock.

In comparison with Nalin Chandra Das & Sons and Girish Chandra Dey and Nakur Chandra Nandy, Banchharam is a new kid on the block. It maybe new but has already spread its wings through 15 outlets in the city. One of these outlets is located opposite Jadu Babur Bajar in Bhowanipore, a few steps from the Netaji Bhawan metro station. There's one more important point to mention otherwise this review would be incomplete. This particular outlet of Banchharam is located right next to the sweet legend Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick which didn't have a good competition around for a long time.

Whether you want a continental dessert or take a ride to down memory lane to the Bengal Renaissance, Banchharam has stocks you can't resist. Amidst a difficult time to stay afloat in business in the middle of a health-conscious generation that doesn't find the quintessential rosogolla or noler gurer sondesh irresistible enough, these are the names that can entice you to step in and let your tastebuds explore. It's a spacious outlet with a bright interior decorated nicely and located in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a vegetable market. Be it their lip-smacking Kacha Golla, crumbly mini-tart shells packed with mihidana topped with condensed milk, Doi Mousse or Chocolate Snap, Banchharam is orgasmic in all aspects. I'm keen to try everything they offer and there's no way I can resist it.

The people behind the counters behave politely with their customers and knows how to talk to them. This is a rare quality which is missing from some of the renowned sweet outlets of the city. Many can't handle finding fame for too long but Banchharam has amply proved that while old continues to be gold, new is clearly the flavour of the generation.

Who is not aware about the fostering legacy of "Banchharam" in the confectionary world of town. With now around 12 outlets all over the town, banchharam is has become a synonymous name to every household and sweet lovers. This considerably newly opened outlet is located in Bhawanipur, nearby netaji bhawan metro station. It is a generously spacious joint, with bright and elegant interiors. The ambience is very vibrant with a squeaky clean environment. They are well stocked with the similar varieties of sweets and savories offered in other outlet of "banchharam" be it the trademark strawberry flavored talsash, then the juicy and gigantic lyangchas, chamchams, baked sweets, laddoos, motipaak etc; then savories like mouth watering veg chops, pander cutlets, Nimki(fried in ghee), paratha+aludam etc; Overall a similar and satisfying experience as you can expect from the house of "Banchharam".

Banchharam is one of the popular brands when it comes to Bengali sweets.This is a relatively new outlet that has opened up in Jadu babur bazaar,only a couple of shops from the iconic Balaram's.
Banchharam serves up a wide variety of sweets ranging from the traditional ones to many different types of fusion sweets which seem to be quite a fashion these days.They do a good job in keeping the traditional sweets traditional and simple and at the same time of good quality.The doi,rosogolla and sandeshes are always very good.Do make sure that the sandeshes specially are consumed fresh on the same day.The gulab jamun is decent,but I have found them to be rather dry and disappointing at times.The fried sweets and also the singaras for that matter are fried in a whole lot of good quality ghee.Among the newer fusion sweets,the mihidana tart is something that is very unique and quite good too.
Like all other popular Bengali sweet brands,the prices are quite high.The interior of this particular outlet is very neat,clean and bright.Overall Banchharam is undoubtedly a popular and quality brand,but I personally would prefer Balaram's a couple of shops down the road.

Firstly, congratlating banchharam on this brand new outlet. This outlet is located right behind the Jadu Babu Bazaar. it was quite a pleasant surprise to see it other day. the bright lights have give a face lift to a rather dingy lane. Like always the Kacha golla was great. but what I loved were the two new things I tried ... firstly the kheer patishapta... thin light patishapta with a khoya stuffing was simply out of this world. I also tried the Mihidana tart and that too was superb . 

Just a suggestion... The lengchas did not look fresh ... if they could do something about it .
