They ask for service charge when they don't even have staff. The food is not hot. They don't even serve cold drinks in glass, then how can they charge Rs 500 while we ourselves have to pour it in small glasses from the bottle. Had to serve them myself as they had requested me to help due to the shortage of Staff(do not help in restaurant, ever. They don't consider help). Overpriced. 
Can you see a jain menu. They charged 175 for Rs 155 sandwich(make it your sandwich without cheese)
And then they say 10%discount on service charge which is optional. I choose not to pay as it was a buffet which was again accepted because of shortage of staff. 
Totally dissatisfied with food and services and pricing.

Terrible .
Well technicaly this is the 2nd time im ordering, though the first order got cancelled after keeping me waiting for 2 hours  
Anyway after reading the good reviews i decided to order again. I ordered a mac and cheese pasta and make your own pizza,with jalapenos,olive,bell pepper and mushroom with extra mozarella(which is another extra 50 bucks) .
It arrived almost on time. But here starts the negatives. On zomato it clearly states 25 rupees delivery below orders of 500( mine was 540). But the person who came for delivery said there was some mistake with zomato and the bill is 565 . I gave him the additional 25 bucks assuming it to be any tax or service charge, but no. It was delivery charge even though my order was well above 500. Such fraud.
Now coming to the food.. IT SUCKS. 
The pizza is pathetic. THERE WAS NO MUSHROOM though i had ordered for it. And there was no trace of cheese( let aside extra cheese)
The pasta was worse  even though it looked nice. It clearly lacked taste, no salt. It just tasted like burnt garlic and onion. 
So overall pathetic  
Never ever ordering again. 
Food sucks and the people cheat Creme Cabana

Located at a walking distance from netaji bhavan metro station, look for it adjacent to a petrol station. 
The ambience is a really cute, happy one.
We ordered
•Belgium chocolate shake- dark chocolate-  it tasted really good. 

•Cheesy garlic loaf- Not much recommended. Though it tasted fine, the bread wasnt of that great quality.

•Custom Pizza with mozerella cheese and 4 toppings of our choice- mushroom, onion,babycorn,jalepenos. Highly Recommended. Amazingly baked with loads of cheese, this will go straight to your heart!

Just keep on walking towards netaji bhavan metro station from homeland..and across the road, to your left is your destination tucked in a petrol pump station.
A little cafe , very pretty, the typical cute place, interior and decoration is amazing!
Perfect location to catch up with your friends over coffee and tasty food.
We ordered for a Belgian chocolate shake (dark chocolate) , cheesy garlic loaf (smeared with cheese) and opted for a customised pizza (that had tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and 4toppings of our choice- mushrooms, babycorns, onions, jalapenos).

The pizza was thin crust, and perfectly crispy and cheesy. The cheesy overload just had my heart.

Pocket pinch:- reasonable (300-350 per head) @

Visited this cute little cafe late last night. There's a really good selection of food and desserts. I liked that there are games for people to play while they wait for their food. We ordered a pink sauce pasta, a spinach and corn crepe and a Belgian chocolate waffle. The food was delicious and it was served really hot and fresh. Service time is average, quality and quantity are above average. We also had a green apple iced tea and it is a perfect drink for the summers. They've got the food on point. Some work on the ambience will elevate the customer experience further.
Would visit again for the good food, music and games.

Creme Cabana is a cafe dressed in modest interiors and the ambience is dominated by an uncharacteristic silence.

We had a Belgian Chocolate Shake which was a bit dark but came in quite handy to overcome the unsatisfactory taste of the Blueberry Pancake.

I'm not an ardent lover of pancakes and evidently nothing changed in an hour or two that I spent at this joint save for a lighter wallet and an unusual liking for boisterous traffic noise!

Creme Cabana is a cosy little nook tucked away in the middle of Kolkata's hustle and bustle. I ordered the spinach and cheese crepe and I was pleasantly surprised at how even a hard core non vegetarian like me was able to appreciate the food. The food is creative and the location is great. The service was prompt but the place has a few minor teething pans like any new restaurant. I think it's a great place for a snack or a saturday afternoon brunch and would highly recommend it to my friends.

Visited Creme Cabana for the third time today. We had the pink sauce pasta, focaccia sandwich, nachos & hazelnut cappuccino. Really like the food here. Particularly liked the fact that all the food is made to order & therefore very fresh. Also, the food can be customized to quite an extent according to your taste since its not pre made. Kudos to the team! Definitely coming back.

Went with a friend, ordered Nachos, Arrabiata Pasta and frappe. Food seemed freshly prepared and tasted really well. Frappe was slightly sweet, do mention amount of sugar required. Serving size was reasonable for the price they charge. Staff was polite and service was quick.
Decor is pretty peaceful and they also keep boardgames and guitar, so I would drop by on weekend with friends to hang-out over a game too.
PS- Brownie Points for really good song playlist on TV.

I keep travelling to Kolkata for work and am always looking for places to eat nearby. Stumbled upon this small cafe on one of my trips and have been going back ever since. I've tried quite a bit from their food and coffee menu. I really like the flavor in their food. They use a lot of quality ingredients which translates into a really nice eating experience for me. I would recommend the spaghetti aglio olio, risotto, focaccia sandwich, all of the savoury crepes and the cold coffees. Going back soon to try some more.

It wss hardly a few days old when we visited that place during Valentine's week.
We ordered items from their Valentine's menu and unfortunately I hated the taste of the food there. Very rarely have I come across such a bland pizza and such a bland crepe.
No doubt the presentation was good but hey food is about the taste bud! Service was inexperienced and slow. We saw a lady standing and instructing the chef it was amusing and distracting at the same time.
The ambience is trying. It's a bit haphazard but dainty enough.

This place is a tour to Fairy land. Colorful quirky decor is bound to mk u happy. I took pics of every possible corner. 
The menu had variety and food was right on point. Since this was my first quick visit, I didn't order much. Just a guava chilli drink and saute veggies. 
There are a few points where they can improve, but it wud b rude to mention that. 
Will revisit soon and check if they improved it. 
It's a great place, specially the decor.

It's situated at the petrol pump near Homeland. I went to the place with my friend after seeing this place almost everyday on my way back home from college. The ambience is amazing with super cute decor and they even keep books for you to read there while you wait for the food, which for me was a plus because I love reading. We ordered a Veggie Paradise Pizza which was very tasty but we felt that the portion was small. We also ordered the Oreo Monster waffles which were heavenly because of the large portion of ice cream and chocolate sauce that was served with it. The owner was sweet and polite. The staff was attentive, polite and quick as well. It's a good place to hang out with friends and I am looking forward to another visit.

Food - we ordered the honey chili fries (recommended by the chef) & chees garlic loaf from the appetizers section. For mains, we had the mushroom burger, aglio olio, pink sauce pasta & Made in Milan wrap. Finally ended with a Nutella crepe, Oreo monster waffle & chocolate macchiato. Since this was mostly recommended by the staff, I guess we had the best of the food. I was very impressed with all of the food to be honest. Personally, I loved all the desserts, the pasta & the burger.

Service - staff is very polite & well informed.

Helloo vegetarians !

Here's another pure vegatarian place for you all to feed your stomaches with!

Yes, you read it right.

A new Italian restaurant has opened its doors by one of my very old friend near ICICI bank , Elgin Road. Its diagnolly oposite Homeland Mall.(Its right next to the peyrol pump)

Its an Italian cafe that serves Vegetarian Italian food , followed by eggless waffles, crepes, shakes and mocktails too.

The cute chirpy interiors wouldn't fail to amaze you .If you are in good numbers, you also have board games for your entertainment there.

Coming to the food menu, its quite detailed and simple and you would get all kind of Italain food that you can generally ask for in an Italian cafe/ restaurant.


So we first ordered for nachos which was good, served with two dips-salsa dip and rajma sauce dip aong with sour cream.


We then called for Garlic loaf, which I found to be better than the Nachos to as was quite cheesy and wholesome!


In the appetizers, Honey Chilli potato fries is also nice and house special too.

In the main course, we could barely just order for just one dish as we were quite full.We ordered for Original Burger which was again a good dish and really filling and delicious.The patries was well cooked and served well with sauce and chips.


As suggested by my friend, the oreo obsession crepe was signature desert dish followed by Berry berry waffle.

We ordered for both the dishes and both were extremelyy delicious and yummy.

My favourite was oreo obsession waffle as it was really chocolatey and crunchy with bits of oreo biscuits coming in your mouth along with the sweetness of nutella and chocolate sauce

Berry Berry waffle was also nice served with strawberry sauce and ice cream and was quite new a dish.

Kudos to the cabana for these two delicacies.

So we also ended up ordering for thick oreo shake and green apple ice tea along with the food and was really nice too.

I had a great time in the cabana cafe and I am sure you all are also going to have a great time here.

So hurry, rush to Creme Cabana, say hello to the sweet owner there and satisfy your buds well there with some new and sweet dishes.

Happy eating and happy feeding .
Please follow the blog for more details .

The perfect "cafe-next-door". I tasted quite a bit of the food as we were 8 of us. For appetizers we had the honey chili potatoes, pita pockets, cheese roesti. Honey chili potatoes were amaaaazing to say the least. We then moved on to spinach corn crepe, mushroom burger & made in milan wrap. Finally we had the asparagus & spinach risotto. All of the food was very good. I liked every dish to be honest. We also tried some shakes & mocktails. The mocktails were okay but the shakes did not disappoint. Particularly Oreo shake which had the perfect consistency & sweetness. For desserts, we had the original pancakes & nutella waffles - both were out of this world. I absolutely loved the food here. Ambience is also nice to hang out with friends & fam

Nice place. Good ambiance and staff are very well behaved. When we went there were no delivery staff but they didn't fail to impress us up as the chef itself delivered us the food. Good taste .Overall very well satisfied

This is definitely one of the best cafe in town. A small place with nice and cozy ambience, really loved it. It's reasonable in pricing as well.

Coming to the food, I ordered corn and spinach crepes, asparagus & spinach risotto, which I would say was one of the best I ever had. 

I am damn impressed and will definitely visit soon to try other food and recommend it to my friends.

Quaint and cozy.. If you're looking to avoid loud music and actually wanna have a quiet relaxed time, this is the place for you! 
The food looks really tempting and is well presented. The Cajun potatoes, pizzas, crepes and waffles are yummm! And for vegetarians like me, the best part is everything on the menu is eggless. 
I'm going back for sure. :)

With amazing food being served and lots of games to choose from, me and my friends spent almost an entire evening at the cafe and I'm sure we are going to visit again very soon.

Crepes and mixed sauce pasta were my favorites. 

It is just the kind of place one would like to visit to spend quality time with friends and food (or let's say food and friends).

A must visit in my opinion.

It's a small place but with a cozy ambience.... however the menu and food quality were surprisingly good!

 I especially liked that the food was  good but at the same time not too expensive. 

Would recommend that you try the focaccia sandwich

Overall: 4.5

I always wanted my first review to be for someone special and now I have found my love. Being a foodie, I try a lot of new cuisines and eateries. In the hunt to satisfy my appetite, I found this cool place in a decent neighbourhood of Kolkata. 

Their ambience is quite refreshing after a day's work. The spread is quite big compared to other cafes in the vicinity. Decent portion size with pocket friendly pricing makes this place a favourite. My take would be to try Asparagus Risotto and Made in Milan wrap. They do have a sizable desert menu which one should surely try.

Their service adds as a cherry on the top. I didn't click any pictures this time but surely going to do it the next. Coming back soon!

New hangout with tonnes of dessert options. Food menu is limited to Italian & some Mexican and Lebanese food, but big thumbs up for keeping the flavors true to the original. I just happened to stumble across this cafe when I was in Cal last week, but I would highly recommend it to all my friends & family back home :)

Very pretty cafe. They have some amazing books & games and the place is full of knick knacks and cushions. There's a guitar too. Best of all, they have super fast free wifi. I stayed there for a couple of hours working on my laptop & just munched on the appetizers. Loved the cheesy potatoes and nachos.

Absolutely loved this "hole in the wall" cafe. Very cute, homely decor with colorful wall art and cushions everywhere. Small but great menu focussing on western/continental/Italian food. The place scores very well on quality & quantity.
Food - 5/5
Ambience/charm - 4/5
Service - 4/5
Value for money - 5/5

Cozy, cute & colorful, Its a great new place with a lot of food options to offer. Located right on the main road, its easy to spot and the experience was quite unique with the chef's custom made preparations. The waffles & crepes are a definite must try. Also tried ordering in and a big thumbs up for the quality & taste.

Found this amazing place, wandering around in the city of joy for a nice, quiet breakfast. Waffles and made-to-order pancakes are literally out of this world. Do check it out!

Cosy little cafe, great ambience ! Do try the waffles and pink sauce pasta while you are here. This place also has to offer a seriously good collection of books, best enjoyed over a hot cup of coffee.
