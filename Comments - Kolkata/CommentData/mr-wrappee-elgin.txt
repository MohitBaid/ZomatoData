I visited the place with a couple of friends today. The place is small, located at Roy Street. We went there for their nitrogen ice cream mainly. We tried the cookies and cream with oreo, melon and rainbow flavours. They were just awesome. We had a great time there playing snakes and ladder. There were other games too. The staff is courteous. We had a gala time and a pocket friendly experience altogether.

This place can be rated only for it's good ambience and not at all for the food..had the kit Kat shake(extra thinned up),cheese garlic bread (which was a bit relief after that and pan fried noodles (this was the worst of that kind I ever had,with extra fried noodles below and a tasteless veg broth topped was worst),only had a single spoonful of it and the rest had to be thrown away.well their nitrogen ice-cream was some sort of soothing after that.had the most disastrous meal here!!

Had visited this place after dinner for a quick bite. It's situated in one of the lanes of Elgin Road. We tried their speciality - cheese balls wraps which was average. The chips with it was nice. They gave a wide range of nitrogen mini melts which was good. We tried most of them. The strawberry and Kulfi were good. The ambience of the place  not good.

The place is quite small yet not too capable of being crowded with a good decor going around it. The music is not too loud and the staff are fast and responsive, so overall it's a nice place to be in.

Coming to Food, whatever we ordered , except the Nachos, were good in taste and pocket friendly as well. The Nachos though, tasted bland so I hope that gets fixed. There are also a ton of MiniMelts to choose from besides Brownies/Waffles. They taste amazing and deserve a special mention.

What we had : -
1. Mixed Sauce Pasta
2. Mexican Wrappee (must try), WaiWai Wrappee, Momo Wrappee
3. Nachos
4. Beverages/Soda - Virgin Mojito, Litchi, Black Currant
5. Shakes - Cold Coffee - must try
6. Brownie with Ice Cream
7. Minimelts

Overall, this is relatively pocket friendly place that serves good food for what it charges and it's definitely recommended for everyone to try out for some nice Wraps and Desserts.

I visited this place back to back on two consecutive days. It was actually discovered after a random walk through the gali's of Elgin. Mr Wrapee is a pure vegetarain restaurant that mainly targets the local youngsters.
It is a small outlet with 6 table outlet with wooden a rustic cabin-house look. One fun thing is that they serve a choice of board and card games along with the food. However the place might seem a little claustrophobic with a full-house.
We had a Mac 'n Cheese, a plate of french fries and a plate of cheese wai wai. The Mac & Cheese came clad in a tortilla and a few nachos. This was the jewel of the show. It had enough cheese sauce to give it the expected mouth fills The fries were decently served. The seasoning on the Wai Wai was over done.
On every 1st of every month Mr Wrapee puts special offer of 49/- for any items, which made was visit the restaurant on the very next day. However, the trimmed down menu made us a little disappointed. Food quality was equally good so it was a win win situation at that price pont.
Service is where Mr Wrapee lost half of a point from me. I would like to have a young waiter / waitress to serve me in such a fast food joint and it needs to be quick. There lies the scope of improvement. 
They have something called 'Mini melts', a unique ice cream that is in granular form. This enhances the flavour and texture of the ice cream. Definitly worth trying.
Worth a retour, however a litte less frequently.
Minimelts are the top recommendation.

We got to know about Mr. Wrappee via a post someone shared where the concept of Minimelts was to be introduced in Kolkata. We haven't had anything else here other than the Minimelts, so the rating is based solely on it. 

A small yet dainty place, Mr. Wrappee is located in the lane opposite of Bhowanipore College. We got going with the Birthday Cake, Cookies and Cream, and Cotton Candy. First, the concept is fresh and the serving was laudable. Secondly, the Birthday Cake tasted more like a standard Vanilla Cake slice, and nowhere special. The cookies and cream more than made up for it while Cotton candy would taste similar to that of Baskin Robbins and that's a good thing. We had the butterscotch flavour as well, although common it was decent. 

The management of Mr. Wrappee have been in touch with us for some time now and would love to visit this place again, and try out other dishes as well. They have also jacked up their Minimelts menu, and the new flavours are intriguing.

A small 8-10 seater joint serving wraps , noodles and shakes , Mr Wrappee is a nice place overall . The place is very small , but I loved the way they have decorated it . There are some cool photo frames explaining our love for food which every Foodie will relate to . They also have a lot of games that you can play including Jenga , Uno or Bridge . 
We just ordered a Chilli Garlic Noodles and a Veg Hakka Noodle , coz we were getting late . It was good but I was disappointed with the quantity . A 3 year old could have gulped down the whole plate . It's a serious problem tbh . 
Though I will visit again soon to try out their shakes and wraps .

Must try for foodies. Other than this the Cold coffee and the mini burgers were good too. Surely need to try many other items. Visiting soon!

I visited this place last week on 27th of September.
Around 3.15 pm.. The place was empty only 3 girls were there. 
This place is located deep in the lane where the crowd is pathetic...
The place "Mr Wrappee" is a small place with no proper Hygiene as Cockroaches were roaming around the table.. And the wraps were horrible.. As well as the cheese nachos and the shake as well as the cold coffee was just not worth the money.
I was highly disappointed with the place.
But while I was leaving.. what made smile in the end was the Mini Melts.. it is a concept no where available in Kolkata.
I tasted a few but out of all I found the Rainbow Flavour the best one of all...
But yet again there was a flaw... The ice cream container was beside the dustbin 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
The Staffs are Horrible.

We ordered:
2 Wraps - Momo Wrap and Mexican Wrap (tasteless).
1 Cheese Nachos... ( which was pathetic, we called the chef and asked him to change it)
1 Kit Kat Shake (consitancy was very thin).
1 Cold Coffee Shake.
1 Small Rainbow Mini Melts (AMAZING)
NO GST CHARGED. NO TAX CHARGED.
Our Bill was Rs.560.
REQUESTING THE MANAGER TO PLEASE TAKE CARE OF THE HYGIENE AND CLEANLINESS. PLEASE. AND THE QUALITY OF FOOD.

Location: Ray Street Bhawanipur, Near Bhawanipur College.

We decided to give it a visit to try out the new minimelts ice cream which is only sold at this outlet,these ice creams are really colourful and resemble ice cream popcorns,the taste tough is like any ice cream.We opted for the Cotton Candy flavour which tasted decent.

There is a small seating area where good music is played in the background so it gives quite a good feeling.Overall a good place if somebody wants to try out the minimelts ice cream or shakes,wraps etc which are also decent here.

Pocket Pinch is not too low nor too high.

Recommended.

I visited this place to try out the minimelts ice cream.
Minimelts is a unique kind of frozen dessert, which also looked like ice cream popcorn. I opted for the cotton candy flavour. Tasted as any other ordinary ice cream.
It is a small joint located near Breakout, Bhawanipur.
Service was good. Staffs were well behaved. The decor is quite interesting with some quotes on the walls. Ambience was cool with some peppy music at the background. Not so spacious. Pocket pinch is on the lower side.
Recommend :)

located in deep down the lane, this place is somehow very much budget friendly, with their occasional offers, coming up every now and then. 
From offering board games, to playing a perfect blend of music, all around the place, their menu, is a perfect trio, offering some really amazing wraps.
A place to watch out for.

This place has many things to offer. We ordered two wraps, the cheese ball wrap and the Exotica wrap both of them were exceptionally good. The size of the wraps very sufficient and the tortilla was also nice. They even serve minimelts which is a new type of ice cream. There were a few ice cream flavors but all of them were tasty and creamy. The ambience was ok they had a small sitting space with music. A great place to hangout and the wraps are the main attraction

We ordered Ahmedabadi wrapee, cheese fries and blue lagoon from the app. And in side ordera other than from the app we had burger platter, kitkat shake and pan mojito.. Each and every item is innovative.. And the pan mojito.. it was mouth watering.. the mints and the taste of pan.. along with a small pan attached in the straw.. seems waaow.. The presentation is too good.. This place has games too.. and the choice of music they played there is far better as compared to any cafe.. Mild music and not loud.. Would love to visit this place again. I had a great time with my friends over there.

I opted for Home Delivery and it was my first ever experience with them. I had ordered a Cheese Ball Wrap & Peri Peri Fries. The portion was perfect for the price charged. The wrap was quite filling in itself. Unlike other similar food joints, they don't pack the food in brown paper. Instead, it's nicely packed in disposable containers.

This review isn't for Mr.wrappee but for their Mini Melts!! 
Glad that this concept that been brought to the city. 
Tried the coffee flavored one and it's a great option. 

You actually consume less ice-cream compared to a normal one. 
It melts slowly which is great!!  Unlike the other nitrogen chilled ice cream so,  this doesn't burn your tongue. 

Great experience!  
Cheers!

I went to this place on the 1st September which offers  some of their food items at just Rs.49 
Offers shouldn't be implied when an eatery has less number of staffs.
We ordered:
Mini melts (strawberry): The only good thing I had that day at this place.
Exotic wrappe: The filling was exotic but the tortilla was the worst I've had, too hard, chewy and dry. Absolutely dry which a fresh tortilla shouldn't be.
Macroni wrappe : Neither the filling nor the tortilla was good
Nachos cheese bhel : was simple packed nachos which had onion, bell peppers sprinkled over it in addition with cheese and a dip over it.

Error handled delicious-ly

I am a regular customer of this outlet. I ordered a Jain wrappe and was expecting a  wrappe without some specific ingredients, but they were their when I received the order. When I called them and complaint about the same they handled the issue very professionally and delivered a fresh piece after their normal delivery time. There all wrappes are always delicious and well stuffed. An extra star just for their dedication towards customer satisfaction.

This is a small joint located in the lane exactly opposite to SSEI(Elgin) near Trimoorti Hotel..
We went with a coupon from Little and took another deal from Cashtag there.
The staff were really enthusiastic and were really co operative.. 2 bhaiyas run this cafe - they are really good. I was really impressed before trying out the menu by their behavior. One when greeted nicely, it makes up their day ! As me and my friend entered the cafe, he greeted us with Hello with a big big smile on the face :)
The ambience is nice :)

Mr. Wrappee is mainly famous for the kind of ice creams they serve..

Here is the list of dishes tried by us :
1. Peri Peri Fries - The ChatAkdAr fries were really good in taste as well as in quantity.
2. Cheese ball Wrap - The best of the wraps here.
3. Exotic Veg Wrap - The wrap filled up with the mix vegetables, was good.
4. Double Chocolate Ice Cream - after trying 2-3 flavors, I liked this one, so we ordered a regular cup of this ! It was good :)

Overall, I would like to visit this place and try more wraps ;)
Recommended to all :)

Pull up a chair. Take a taste. Come join us. Life is so endlessly. That's all Mr. Wrappee suggest Where you can find the conjuncture of Desi tarka and Western taste at the same time.
This cafe is a stone thrown away from Bhawaniporee College and Diocesan School and tether to the other area in the locus of the Chakerberia Road and it's not long away from Netaji Bhawan. It resides in a small alley just opposite to Sumo Dough(Elgin Road) and besides Breakout.

This is small cafe is an absolutely Bliss and great place for hook ups at Affordable price. Mr. Wrappee is a pure vegetarian joint that serves fresh hot delicious handcrafted fast food..!! Yes it's fasttttt food in the small corner of Live Kitchen with 5 staffing who works really well and fast to serve . This cafe has put tremendous effort in reduction in the costs but not into the quality. As they handcraft everything thing on the menu and using freshly handmade ingredients from Pasta to Mayo to Brownie instead of outsourced one has gone to extra mile in helping them to reduce the overall cost from variable to fixed cost of everything in the bill of fare(MENU).
Mr. Wrappee has a fair sitting capacity of 18 to 22 approx. The interior of this cafe is pretty and well crafted. The wall is decorated with sarcasm food quote and few framed art work.
In the menu, I have noticed that the dishes are pretty simple and really have a small range of price for you to enjoy a great rates of offering in the pocket pinch. You will be enjoy the food ranging from 99/- to 150/-

What I had???
Ummmm.....!!

• Wraps- The discovery of a new dish is more precious to human beings than the discovery of a new star and that's what they did with the wraps.
The wrap feels like a very modern sandwich, reducing the stodge and allowing for more creative fillings. Knock up a quick supper with their tortilla wraps, filling of Cheese Ball*, Paneer Tikka, Momo and Mushrooms Croquet** combined with the house prepared dips Cheese Mayo, Tomato Chilli Roasted, Schezwan, and Garlicio Chilli and also some tortilla chips with different dimension. The wraps over here is a compulsion in ones menu and one should try it with Cone Shake. Only the Momo wrap has the generous amount of distinct tasting Mayo, Schezwan and lettuce. All the wraps have different taste and perspective to your taste buds

• Alfredo Pasta- It is actually a white sauce pasta with great amount of veggies in the good quantity and quality they're providing.

• Peri peri fries**- This is a newer version of French fries with some spicy spices (chat-pata masala), which are really crunchy from outside and juicy from the inside. They are serving it with 2 different Mayo and ketchup.

• Mr. Burger Platter- They used to call it "burger shots". This is something new and great idea of to try different flavors at a time. They provide three types of mini not tiny burgers with three different flavors. In this recipe they use fresh bread with herb salad and Doritos and Mayonnaise.

• Cone Coffee***- Ahh !! Yes it makes me feel like that because the way it looks but also for its splendid taste. This beverage was served with in glass bottle with cold coffee and a frozen cone, which is coated with the thick layer of yummy Chocolate. It's looking like coffee being filtered by the cone. I like this concept of serving the beverage and presentation.

• Shakes- I had tried 2 more shake i.e KITKAT SHAKE & BROWNIE SHAKE. Both the shakes aptly prepared. These shakes are like cold coffee either with KitKat or with Brownie.

• Brownie**- It's like normal brownie with the twist of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, caramel and gems. It's pretty innovative receive as they make a fusion of assorted molecular icream pellets with the Brownie and yes there brownie was very soft and tasty.

• Assorted Molecular Ice cream****- It's the speciality of the Cafe as they are monopolist of it in the Eastern India, which is served by Mini Melts. It's imported from USA. They have varieties of flavors but due to high demand, there's pretty shortage of various flavor of Mini Melts. So you should try as much flavor as you can once here. This ice cream surely make your visit perfect.

The cafe is not as spacious as one may expect but the decor of the place gives the comfy feel .  This place is good for quick bites to grab up the food and leave. Situated right on the road so spotting this place is not an issue. It’s a tiny little cafe with cozy ambiance. NEAT is the word , a brilliantly utilized space on the Ray Street near Elgin Road a retro feel , without loud irritating music , a very colorful ambiance that really sets the mood right.
                                                                ...

I am fond of wraps and wanted to pay a visit to this place. This place looks small from outside and I thought there won't be sitting arrangements but there is another room inside for that. We had paneer tikka wrap and cheeseball wrap. The wraps are oil free ofcourse. In every bite you get soft pieces of paneer and tomatoes. The same with the cheeseball wrap, everybite is delicious.

A small pretty place, which could be an easy and affordable place to hang out. The food could have been a little better. Tortilla lovers should definitely give it a try.

The cafe is not as spacious as one may expect but the decor of the place gives the comfy feel .  This place is good for quick bites to grab up the food and leave. Situated right on the road so spotting this place is not an issue. It’s a tiny little cafe with cozy ambiance. NEAT is the word , a brilliantly utilized space on the Ray Street near Elgin Road a retro feel , without loud irritating music , a very colorful ambiance that really sets the mood right.
                                                                ...

I am fond of wraps and wanted to pay a visit to this place. This place looks small from outside and I thought there won't be sitting arrangements but there is another room inside for that. We had paneer tikka wrap and cheeseball wrap. The wraps are oil free ofcourse. In every bite you get soft pieces of paneer and tomatoes. The same with the cheeseball wrap, everybite is delicious. Will come again for sure.

Mr Wrappe which is at a stone throw distance from Bhawanipur college and Diocesan School; and is pretty well connected to other areas in the vicinity of Chakraberiya Road and is not long away from Netaji Bhawan. It dwells in a small alley just opposite to Crossword bookstore (Elgin Road).

I have studied in a Bhawanipur college and throughout my college life, I was pretty much dependent upon the college canteen and Nick N Nack. Though later on a few eateries popped up here and there, none of them was in that kind of a zone that could say that it is affordable for a quick snack. Mr Wrappe is a pure veg joint that serves fresh hot handcrafted fast food at AFFORDABLE prices. They tend to maintain the quality while taking absolute care of the quantity. It is perfect when you feeling Hangry.

Mr Wrappe has put tremendous effort in reducing cost but not the quality. In fact, the eatery is reducing the cost in such a manner that the quality only gets premium. Their idea of handcrafting everything on the menu and using freshly hand-made ingredients (from the mayo to the brownie) instead of outsourced one has gone an extra mile in helping them reduce the overall cost of everything on the menu.

I loved their idea of Wrappees and Mini melts.
This place has a nice ambience and a good playlist too for the background music. There's a limited seating area like most of the cafes of this sort.
We had;
Momo Wrappee.. this was innovation and a good one that.
Aloo tikki Wrappee.. nice, light and fresh.
Assorted Mini Melts. The idea is to just place the pellets in the mouth and let them melt on your tongue and let the flavours burst.. it's Fabulous and worth trying again n again.
Peri Peri Fries. Seriously, try it once instead of ordinary French fries and jazz up your love for this universal junkie.
Service was polite and nice.
They accept Paytm too.

Mr.Wrappee is a new addition in the block of cool funky outlets which are popping up nowadays throughout kolkata. The place is being run & managed by two young entrepreneurs in partnership, Yash Kataria & Nishant Surana!!

We were invited for a tasting event by the team of Mr.Wrappee. This is located inside the narrow lane which is opposite of sumo dough(beside bhawanipur college). Landmark would be hotel trimoorti. The place has a seating capacity of around 15 with the live kitchen outside the seating area. Decor wise it was bright & vibrant which would attract the younger people very much with quirky amusing write ups on the wall and light music being run in the background.

We were offered the following dishes:-

1. Penne pasta in white sauce - A bowlful of soft penne pasta served in super creamy sauce with generous portions of shredded bell peppers garnished with basil leaf. The pastas were cooked to absolute perfection but for me the dish was elevated to another level due to the creamy white sauce. Not too thick or dense but indeed very fine!! The presence of bell peppers gave a good crunch to the dish as well. Recommended dish!!

2. Cheese ball wrap - We were presented with 4 different kinds of wraps based on their house speciality i.e. cheese ball,mushroom,paneer & momo!! We started off with this, the wraps are made of oil free roomali rotis which is a positive from health point of view. Wraps were presented with a bowl of peri peri fries with their house special dips i.e. garlic,tomato,mayo,ketchup & schezwarma. The wraps had a filling of gooey cheese balls,mayonnaise & lettuce. The taste & hit of cheese came upon every bite of the wrap. Along with wraps, side kick of fried tortillas were given which was indeed a very innovative addition. Loved the overall presentation,taste & the concept of the dish. Recommended dish!!

3. Mushroom croquette wrap - Presentation wise & content wise it was the same as above but the only difference being instead of cheese balls, this had stuffed mushroom croquette. This was the best of the 4 wraps which were presented to us. The mushroom croquettes were soft & was cooked to perfection. This was a proper filling dish!! Highly recommended dish!!

4. Paneer tikka wrap - A very light yet very delectable wrap. Soft paneer tikkas coated with mayonnaise was an under-rated winner in my opinion. Loved the taste of it.

5. Momo wrap - This dish defines innovation. Kudos to the owner who came up with this idea. The wraps were stuffed with veg momos, again a filling dish but to savour the whole dish you must have the fried tortillas with schezwarma dip. The schezwarma dip just elevates the whole taste due to its spiciness.

5. Mini Burger platter - 3 mini sliders were presented with dorritos & herb salad. The sliders had a patty of mixed veg but the patty was too dry in my opinion. Presence of something moist like sauce/mayonnaise could help solve that problem. So there is a scope for improvement in this dish!!

6. Brownie shake - After the wraps & mini sliders, we were served with shakes. Firstly, we were provided with a thick cold chocolaty brownie shake. The shake was aptly thick,how a shake should be. There was generous amounts of brownie. Very refreshing & was prepared superbly.

7. Kitkat shake - Typical kitkat shake with full of crushed kitkat. This shake however did not meet the expectations as i was looking for due to the fact that the crushed kitkats were far too large and all the crushed kitkat had deposited in the bottom due to which it became difficult to sip it later on.

8. Cone shake - This is their house speciality & it truly lives up to its reputation. The presentation itself would make you drool & just savour the drink. An ice cream cone which was frozen was placed on the shake jar with tempered chocolate coating & some coffee shake within it which would resemble just exactly like a filter. The cone was superb in taste,perfectly crunchy!! The cold coffee was also decent. Really conceptually innovative drink.

9. Hot brownie with white chocolate & ice cream - 2 hot brownies were presented with layers of white chocolate over it sprinkled with molecular ice cream. Really liked the brownies,very fresh & not dense. White chocolate & the ice cream bits gave a good dimension to the dish.

10. Assorted molecular ice cream - Last but the not least by any terms. The item for which this place has set a big benchmark for its rivals & is winning accolades i.e. their molecular ice creams. A very different yet very unique approach in the world of ice creams. Molecules of different flavoured ice creams was presented to us which consisted of rainbow,kulfi,pina colada etc. Every spoonful of it was orgasmic to say the least. The molecules would crumble slowly & then would just instantly melt in your mouth. They import these ice cream flavours from USA(partnered with mini melts). Their ice creams stay so much in demand that you would be lucky if you get one bowlful of it since they sell like hotcakes. This is the USP of this place. Highly recommended item!!

The pocket pinch is on the reasonable side!! Each & every item is being made with utmost care & attention in the presence of the owners. The reception we received was very welcoming & warm. They are going to introduce more ice cream flavours & breakfast menu next month. Also they will be opening their second branch in new alipore very soon. So i wish all the best & lots of success to the owners in their new ventures. I would gladly recommend this place to my foodie friends & I myself would revisit this place again surely!!

I had my eyes on this place who have recently introduced mini melts to the city of joy since it was first opened. It looks like a small place on entering but has a dedicated seating area for around 10-12 place on the inside. Unfortunately there were very few flavours available on the Saturday evening me and my friends checked into the place, we went for their Kulfi, Rainbow and PinaColada mini melts small cups. All of them tasted blissful, high on flavour, I loved the pina colada the most. The Rainbow one had this fruity flavour being a mixture of a variety of mini melts. They have a lot of other quick munchies and beverages on the menu, hoping to taste some of them pretty soon. The men behind the counter were warm enough, but they didn't accept card payment which should be changed for better in future.

We went to Mr. Wrappee to try out their newly launched menu and also some of the best selling dishes that were already available on the menu.
The new menu has been curated keeping in mind the taste and liking of the newer generations and the current trend.

Moving over to the dishes we tried out there:-

1. The different variety of wraps- All the wraps were delicious and tasted better with the house made dips on offer! Our favorites were the momo wrap, mushroom wrap and cheese corn wrap.

2. French fries- Mr. Wrappee french fries were topped with good quantity of cheese sauce and tasted truly divine.

3. Burgers- The colourful burgers were totally a steal and were eye catchy! The taste was fairly good and the best part was that no artificial colour was used.

4. Brownie with Minimelts- The newly launched brownies were mouth melting and the gooey goodness was served with the Mr.Wrappe special Minimelts ice creams which raised the level of this dessert! 

5. Doughnut Shake- We really liked the concept of this shake.. eat while you sip! One can enjoy a chocolaty drink as well as taste the splendid doughnut on the top of the drink!

6. Cold coffee in a Cone- Surely, this was something totally different for us! Ice cream in a Cone was common, but coffee is totally out of the box!

7. Minimelts Rainbow Bowl- Finally we got our hands on the much talked Minimelts ice cream which is sold only by Mr.Wrappee in the city currently! These are bead sized ice creams, which melts in the mouth with a burst of flavours. We tried a small bowl full of these layered with different flavours in each! A must try out here.

Overall, Mr. Wrappee is a nice place to enjoy some really delicious food on the go with friends or family! A place to chill out in the evening and enjoy the sumptuous offerings! The place is quite pocket friendly and the quantity served is worth it! They have not compromised on the quality of the food, thereby maintaining the standards of food in our culture and society!
Will definitely visit again for more of the wraps and the Minimelts! 

We would also, love to thank the owners of Mr.Wrappee for inviting us over to try the great array of food on offer here! We had a lovely experience dining out here.
Kudos to your team! 😊

This is a very small restaurant in an aisle opposite to BESC in Elgin road.
We ordered rainbow, musk mellon, kulfi and assorted ice creams because nothing else was available.
We ordered a hazlenut milkshake and they gave us a mint one!
Next, about 30mins after placing the order, we were told that KitKat and Oreo milkshakes aren't available!
Sad.
Poor service. However, ice creams were good.

At first when you look at Mr. Wrappee, it seems like a small place. But once you enter, you see a door on the left which leads you to the seating area. The concept is pay, eat and go. They are the one who has brought the ‘Mini Melt’s Ice Cream’ concept to the city of joy. The chairs and tables are chic and the wall is beautifully decorated with good quotations. As it is near the school and college area, it might attract a lot of school and college goers.

Just 2 months old this concept Veg cafe offers alot of good stuff and overall a pleasant experience.  Located near bhawanipur college on Eligin Road and basically a pocket friendly cafe, it's main Crux is Wrap. They offer mainly 4 variants in wraps with at least 12 different Wrappee. You can choose the roll from maida multigrain beetroot and spinach. In Wrap I personally loved Maggi Wrappee and Mac and cheese both were equally filling and they provide seasonings which will go best with them. They have some great shakes likes Brownie, Nutella and KitKat shake which are decent. The best part of this place is mini melts. They have some great flavors in ice melts and they serve with brownie, donuts and muffins as well. P.S :- Do try their brownie with mini melts the best thing you'll remember having in a while.

A hidden gem truly.
They have a unique concept of ice creams.
The ice cream is frozen at -40°C and are like mini droplets.
The idea is that you don't chew them out instantly but instead put them in  your mouth and wait for it to melt and then the magic begins . It tastes wonderful.
Tried Alphonso and rainbow and both were amazing.

Absolutely loved everything about the place. Right from the moment we entered till the minute we left. The welcoming staff who helped our choose our wraps and the side dishes, the WRAPS WERE AMAAAAZING (must try the Cheese Ball  Wrap), the side dishes were good too but what stole the show was the minimelts icecream! We tried a variety of flavours, all were nice. Mango, Bubblegum, Musk Melon, Coffee but RAINBOW was exceptional. Over all the place was good. Nice and cosy. Seating facility with good music. Games for playing. And the best part, all of this without burning a hole in the pocket! Very reasonable prices. Would love to visit once again.

The city is packed with hidden gems, one just needs the eyes to find them.
Wraps and ice creams aren't exactly unpopular in this city but their unconventionality is rare.
Mr.wrappee focuses on bring out unconventionality in clichéd dishes.
Mainly dealing with wraps, this outlet offers a variety of vegetarian wraps with the softest of tortillas.
They focus more on the health factor thus the healthy quotient is quite high in the food they serve.
I was invited to taste items off their new menu prior to the launch.
The new menu includes some amazing wraps like the Manchurian wrap, jalepeno wrap, corn and cheese besides their regular momo wrap ( a complete marvel) and paneer wraps.
They also offer lip smacking colored vegetarian burgers with choice of patty.

Coming to the ice cream now The Mini Melts.
A speciality of the house.
These are small granules frozen at -47 degrees which melt in your mouth giving you the ultimate ice cream experience. Sounds amazing, doesn't it?
They come in a variety of flavors from fruity to chocolatey my personal favorite being the musk melon and coffee. This is a must try!
I am a sucker for milkshakes, nothing makes me happier. Mr.Wrappee happens to offer amazing KitKat and doughnut shaakes to give provide you with sugar rushes.

Affordable, fulfilling and amazing. A huge thumbs up!

Price: 4/5
Food: 4/5
Service: 4.5/5 (asking for a feedback is always a welcome gesture, who doesnt want to share an opinion? 😉 kudos to that!) 

Although i have just tried their Mexicana Wrappee, but have had them on two consecutive days, so yes! That tells a lot. The soya keema is light, perfectly spicy and the mayo is blend with the veggies to give you a very healthy filling. 

Suggestions: Do keep a hand sanitizer at the tables as yours' is a QSR and people on a clock could use some hygiene check.

Walking distance from Bhowanipore college, mr.wrappe offers a unique kind of ice cream which are called mini melts. I had to visit it after seeing a few pictures. I love ice cream and the concept of it being solidified into tiny globules and available in different and new flavours naturally made me visit this place
 There are a variety if flavours of of which i tried the black current and the rainbow. The let me know that rainbow was a favourite of most of their customers. And after having its obvious why. Its colourful and tastes amazing. Recommended. The black current had the usual taste. Will go again and try more flavours more sure.

Mr.Wrappee is the brainchild of it's neophyte founders and they've certainly come up with an interesting take on Wraps and Ice-Cream.
Mr. Wrappee, wrapped up in limited space, has an intriguing menu which offers fascinating twists to rather stereotyped dishes.
We tried the paneer tikka wrap and the cheese ball wrap,both were very fresh and spiced up beautifully with veggies and sauces.
They also have Mini melts aka ice-cream solidified into small granules which come in captivating flavours. We tried Melon,coffee and cone(yes,the ice cream cone) flavours which were equally good.
We also had Coffee in cone, yet another interesting fusion and seems like a must have!
Overall Mr.Wrappee is a hidden gem that serves you it's fresh combinations cooked with enthusiasm at nominal prices.

Located beside hooked up cafe, near Nick nack. Good place to hangout with friends and family. Had ordered for Ahmedabadi wrap, had asked for two more wraps but they didn't had at that point of time. Wraps was decent and healthy enough. They also have an unique ice-cream called Mini melts in form of small granules. It taste the original flavour of the items. Had ordered for coffee and musk melon.  They also offer board games and charging point on tables. Staffs are courteous and energetic.

Was catching up with my old friend and decided to have a quick bite at this place, looks like a takeaway counter from outside but has great sitting arrangements and ambiance. Tried two wraps one with cheese balls and one which was named as panner lambadar, both were decent healthy enough, though not filling apt for a quick bite,  they also have a icecream menu not listed on zomato though, called mini melts, its icecream in form of small granules, tasted many flavours close to all of them and then ordered 2 out of them, coffee and banana which was something unique in that form and tasted as you can make out of the name, I also liked the musk Mellon, tasted like a musk melon straight out of the freezer.

The interiors are very good and apt seating arrangements, can sit there and spend time for hours there. They also offer board games, I saw uno, zenga and some others, also offers charging point​ on tables, another plus point. Staff are courteous and Cherry upon the cake is that they give 10% Cashtags on your visit, make sure you reedem them.

When i first visited this place the food was awesome , all the wraps were delicious , the presentation was appealing when each wrap was served with loads of fries and cheese dips . 
However on my subsequent visit the situation was reverse the wraps were much smaller in size served with some red sauce and suddenly those loads of fries vanished . 
Customer satisfaction is the biggest thing in business and I believe this food joint needs to learn a lot . 
All the best !

Had mexican wrappee
No doubt the wrappee had a very good taste even after considering the mediocre price
To go with the mini melts icecream which are kept under super cooling refrigerators i would suggest to have BIRTHDAY CAKE Flavour our of all flavours without mixing it with any other flavour to go with
Amazing taste
