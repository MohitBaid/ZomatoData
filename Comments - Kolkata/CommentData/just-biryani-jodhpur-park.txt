not upto the mark at all....... please dont buy biriyani from here until they improve drastically....... street biriyani is far better than this.

The worst quality Biryani i ever had.  I would suggest everybody not to buy stale and tasteless food from this outlet. I wonder how this cheap outlets are still in the business market.

Disgusting,Awful,Stale..u dont normally use these terms to describe biryani and perhaps this is the first time i did..ordered via swiggy and this is the last time..too oily and utterly tasteless..i wonder why they dont improve on their quality of food considering the poor reviews going around..a ZERO rating if available is what they deserve..

I ordered via Swiggy for home delivery. I ordered 1 chicken biryani and 3 mutton biryani.

Pros - The amount is more than normal. They also proviDe an Aloo and  a boiled egg.

Cons - The chicken, mutton are undercooked and therefore not palatable. The chicken bone and the inside meat is red. The mutton pieces are very chewy and tends to get stuck in the teeth.

I would avoid ordering with them unless they improve their quality

Stale and dry Biryani. Lacks flavor or any taste whatsoever. Not exactly overpriced, but seemed so, judging by the quality which was offered. Better options do exists in the city to satiate Biryani cravings.

The shop is near Jodhpur Park Market opposite to State Bank of India Gariahat Civic Center. A very small shop and only take away is available no seats available. 
Don't buy Just Biryani from "Just Biryani". I made a mistake by buying Biryani from this shop. The biryani is too dry and doesn't taste good at all. I bought Biryani and Chicken Chap from this shop. The quality they served was not at all good, not at all. But I must say the quantity is much more than many shops. The one who are foodie and loves Biryani very much they might also find it much to complete. 
There are many Biryani house near to this place where you will get much better biryani than this one.

A colleague ordered Biryani from this joint on Swiggy today. He ordered 9 Mutton Biryanis with Egg. A full plate costed 95bucks (with Swiggy discount) with a decent piece of mutton, fairly long grain rice, once egg, one aloo. It was an average biryani with lil excess Kewra water (keora-r jol). But it was eatable. With decent portion of both meat and rice it does justify the price tho.
