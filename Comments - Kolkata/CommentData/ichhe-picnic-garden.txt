nice food!

The nasikari and bamikari rice cost more but they both come with a gravy of their own.The veggies are properly cut and sauted,making the dishes delectable .However it requires an inclination towards  thai food to appreciate the taste. 
Veg in goel sauce had large chunks of babycorn. They also packed some salad with it.
They take no delivery charge or container charge.
enjoy!

Cheap and amazing food. The people out here are very good. Bang for the buck. The lighting out here is good. Give this place a try for sure.
