Adi Sree Hari Mistanna Bhandar is located near Kalighat Kali temple, and is quite famous.

Service is quick with nice staffs .

Tried their Jolbhora sondesh & Radhavallabhi - cholardal.
Radhavallabhi was absolutely lip smacking with the combo of cholardal . Sweet was decent too. 

If one comes to Kali temple for offering puja, one must visit this shop too to satisfy hunger pangs.

কালীঘাট মান্দিরের পাশেই । পুজা দিতে গিয়ে আলাপ হয়েছিল । একরাশ খিদে এবং আসা নিয়ে ধুকেছিলাম , আর দুটোই যথার্থ ভাবে মিটেছে বলে যায় । জলভরা সন্দেশ আর রসগোল্লা খুব ভালো লেগেছিল , বিশেষ করে রাধাবল্লবি যেটা এখন ও মুখে লেগে আছে ।

A popular, renowned and weel known swee tshop located near the Kalighat Kali Mata Temple, the USP here is undoubtedly the Radhaballavis. The stuffing is just a killer one, and hence outshines everything else. Have heard a lot about their Mishti Doi as well. Unfortunately, am yet to taste the same.

Very popular and busy sweet shop located near the Kalighat Kali Temple. They serve some usual authentic Bengali sweets like Lyancha , pantua , rosogolla which are very decently priced and loved the taste too. Also to mention about their Radhaballavi which is a killer snack item to try out.

It was on my mother's demand that I brought some snacks and sweets for my family's breakfast on a Sunday. Radhaballabi, alur dom, langcha and Gulab jamun were the ones I brought. The soft radhaballabi filled with a sweet and spicy stuffing when dipped into the lip-smacking alur dom, what I felt in my mouth was magic ! The sweets were great too. Going back again :D

Very famous sweetshop  in the area. Love the radhaballavis along with aloor dum. The special sweets are chumchum, lyangcha, pantua and the sweet which I adore very much is the milkcake. Very good I must say.

Have been a family shop for me because whenever I visit kolkata, the first sweet that I get to eat is from this shop (my nani's house is just beside this shop). They offer mediocre level sweets, which is available at any other shop in kolkata. Nothing exceptional.

Uf I name a  sweet shop in rash bihari to hazra then than that will be adi sree hari mistanna bhandar..... very nice shop. Quality of the sweet is marvelous.. not soo costly place to have sweets..... kesaria rosomalai, laddo, misti doi, khir kadam,  golab jammun is mind blowing to my opinion... always take sweets for puja from their. and the best part of that shop is their behaviour and lots of smile when they serves... just loved it.. keep it up........

One of the best places to have Sweet Curd (Misti Doi) in Kolkata. It is heard that when film actress Vidya Balan was shooting for 'Kahani', she used to have the Sweet Curd of Adi Shree Hari everyday. 
Other sweets are of good quality, and definitely a try when visiting Kalighat Kali Temple. One of the few clean areas to have vegetarian snacks in the Kali Temple area. 
They also have some CSR activity as they distribute packets of 'Halwa Kachuri' amongst the poor of Kali Temple area every morning.

One of the oldest mishtanno bhandar in kali ghat area... its a must visit after pujo dewa in kali ghat... they make khasta kochuri and halwa as breakfast item for distribution among the beggars of kalighat and was available to public at a cost of 5.... their radhaballabi and cholar dal, luchi and alur dom are must have as breakfast. .. rest sweets are awesome. ... roshogolla, dorbesh, motichur borfi, paradise sondesh, golab jam, notun gurer sankh sondesh are few mouthwatering sweets.... must visit place and a legend too....
