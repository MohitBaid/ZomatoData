It is a place where fish kebab means fish fried in utterly nonsensical coat of don't know what. Don't be lured by their cheap price as whatever little amount you pay will just be a waste of money.

Ordered Chicken Schezwan Dry for ₹155/-.
Though the chicken tasted good and spicy, the quantity of the dish was very less. The description of the dish talked about serving 10 pieces of chicken.
But the pieces served were very tiny.
The 3.0 rating is for the quantity. The eatery could have given less amount, for the same price in a bigger size, that would have been better.

We ordered egg shezuwan fried rice and chilly chicken dry from zomato.It was enough for two people. The fried rice was good but the chicken was too spicy.
All over satisfied with the price in mind.

One of the worst biryani I have ever had. The price is as low as the food quality. The chicken tastes rotten. Please don't waste your time and money on this.

Decent place for cheap and spicy food. Ordered via Swiggy hence can't comment on the place. The food is quite spicy but tasty. It's wholesome in quantity and enough to feed a person. I had a schewan fried rice and dry chilli chicken. Both are pretty decent in terms of roadside food. However the dishes are a bit spicy and oily. Anyway decent place for normal roadside food.

Singapore chicken is very good...but quality of noodles can be better.
Delivery time is very long.
Quantity is more or less ok. 
Cost is low.
I will rate 3.5/5

A new local eatery in baghajatin area. Well i opted for a home delivery via swiggy to try some of their starters.

1. Chicken sweet corn soup - The soup was too sweet in taste which completely ruined the texture of the soup. The chicken bits were barely there to enjoy the soup. This was very similar to any road side momo soup. Thumbs down!!

2. Chicken lollipop(half) - There were 4 lollipops served with kasundi. The chickens were fresh but again were scanty. Could improve further.

Prices are on the lower side but the quality could be improved much more

Tried egg chicken Biriyani.  It cost me rs 100.
I tried through swiggy. 
Try once if you haven't tried it at all. 
It's average. 
Delivery was quick.
