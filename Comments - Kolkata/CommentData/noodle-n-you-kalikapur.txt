This place gave me a very pleasant surprise with the quality of food that they dished out. Had seen this place spring up at Kalikapur some months back and had always desired to order someday from here. And order I did and there was not an iota of disappointment with the food they served. I can definitely say (with a heavy stomach and utmost satisfaction in my heart) that they are dishing out some of the most authentic Chinese food in town. Do give this place a try folks...you will not be disappointed. Tried the Lemon Coriander Soup, Hakka Noodles, Steamed Chicken Wings in BBQ sauce, Mixed Fried Rice, Chicken in Chilli Sauce, Chicken in Kung Pao sauce, Thread Spicy Chicken. Each and every item was excellent....hard to find faults with any one of them. I hope they continue with the fantastic job that they are doing.

So we ordered Grilled chicken in hot basil sauce and Vegetarian Cantonese noodles and both were pretty disappointing.. points listed below:

1. About the starter, it was one hell pot of oil. Shredded pieces of chicken swimming in oil.. very less flavour of basil.. there were basil leaves ofcourse but it did nothing to save the dish!!

2. The quality of noodle not at par.. the gravy was a thick blob of cornflour.. there were veggies but amount was pretty less and the majority was the cornflour mass.. needless to say we did not like it

We generally order chinese from a very well known restaurant near Jora bridge.. thought of trying out the place because the rating is high.. but its so misleading!!

"Noodle n you" is about 2 minutes by walk away from my place. Very easily locatable place. Situated on Prince Anwar Shah Road Connector , exactly a stopage after Purbachal , beside "Florence"- the beauty parlour.

My friends had to be treated. So , I ordered Crispy Chilli Babycorn as a starter ; schewan hakka noodles-egg ; veg hakka noodles as well as Chilli chicken as a part of main cuisine.
Every item tasted well , but I could'nt find any schewan flavour in the Schzewan noodles.
The system of parcelling is good. The noodles were packeted in some sort of aluminium foils covered with paper covers and babycorn and chicken were packeted in plastic lunch boxes. Food were delivered hot and price is also reasonable. But the delivery boy was acting so stupid , in spite of describing the direction of my house over phone call time and again , he failed to figure out . I had to walk a short distance and then collect the food.
Behaviour of the staffs was good though !

i orfered their panko friend chicken and steam fish in oyster sauce.  while the fish was quite good the chicken was excellent.  the breading of the chicken,  itself was so tasty-i could taste lemon grass among other herbs.  the chicken inside was well cooked and served.  

quantiity they serve is pretty good.  looking forward to ordering again.

'Noodle n You' is the perfect place for foodies looking for authentic chinese dishes. Located in kalikapur this    is basically a take away joint and not a restro. The food is quite good in taste and enough in quantity. The packing of the food items in also done in proper hygienic ways.

Coming to food items tasted:-

● Chicken Hot Garlic- The chicken pieces are crispy from outside and juicy from outside. The spice quotient is medium in this dish. Garnishing is done with fried Onion, capsicum and garlic.
● Seven Jewel Fried Rice- It is an exotic veg rice . The seven jewels refer to seven exotic veggies which is mixed with the rice. 
● Fish in Chilli Oyster Sauce- The fish fillets are finely cooked such that it melts as soon you gulp it. It is medium spicy in nature and a special dish for all fish lovers.
● Chicken Drums of Heaven- The chicken leg pieces are authentic in taste. Personal favourite and highly recommended.
● Prawn Sweet and Sour Sauce- It is unique in nature and tangy in taste. The sweet flavour comes from the pineapple slices in the dish. The sour flavour comes from the soya sauce in the dish. The prawn slices are quite good.
● Chicken Cantonese Noodle- It is basically a gravy noodle. The gravy contains chicken, mushroom and different vegetables.

This one is the perfect place to order food when you are too lazy to step out of your house but craving for some absolutely lip smacking dishes.
I have ordered food from many takeaway joints but this place is totally different.Because they serve the best quality food at reasonable price.
Located near kalikapukur,this place offers some of the best Chinese dishes you will ever have.

We ordered the following items for a get together.
1.Drums of heaven-Fried chicken legs tossed with schezwan sauce and veggies,this one proved to be the perfect starter.The dish was not at all dry and perfectly cooked.It had 8 pieces of crunchy chicken legs.

2.Chicken cantonese noodles-This was a very healthy dish with all the nutritious vegetables like broccoli,mushroom,zuchhini,babycorn and bellpepper.The noodles and the gravy was packed in separate containers so that you can add the gravy according to your need.This dish was absolutely yum and healthy too.

3.Hot garlic chicken-This dish actually had minced garlic in it that gave it a nice aroma and flavour.There was 8 big pieces of chicken that is more than enough for 2 people.

4.Seven jewel fried rice-The jewels in this dish were zucchini(both yellow and green),bell pepper,baby corn,carrot,french beans and broccoli.All the vegetables were finely chopped and cooked to perfection.

5.Fish in chili oyster sauce-Tender fish cooked in oyster sauce is the best side dish for mains.The big  fish pieces were crispy from outside and juicy from inside.

6.Sweet and sour prawn-The prawns were cooked in a flavourful sauce that gave a tangy and tingling taste.It also had pineapple in it.The size of the prawn was big enough and all in all this was a great dish.

Noodle 'n you is definitely one of the best chinese takeaway joint in kolkata.
Kudos to the team for serving best quality food at reasonable prices.
Will surely order again to try other delectable dishes.Many more orders coming in your way.

This takeaway joint in Kalikapur,kolkata is a hub for delicious chinese delicacies.

"Take away happiness" is what the tagline of this place suggests and there's nothing falsely about their claim.

Reasonable pricing,good food quality and flavours too authentic that you'll fall in love for but what's the striking feature?

The variety.

Check list :

• Drums of heaven(chicken)
• Fish chilli in oyster sauce
• Hot Garlic Chicken(with Bell peppers)
• Seven jewel fried rice
• Mixed Cantonese noodles
• Prawn sweet & sour

These are the few recipes i got to taste and i must admit,this place holds the potential of being one of the best take away joints in kolkata.

Overview :

The characteristic feature of their food which they offer derives from the use of fresh veggies and not only the freshness is the point of happiness for your tastebuds but the surprising variety of the same.

Bold broccoli to sensational sweet corn 🌽
Majestic mushroom 🍄 to vibrant Zucchini

You name it,they have it in their dishes.

Way to go "Noodle 'n You"

Keep surprising us with the twist of tales to authentic chinese dishes.

There's a huge difference in the food quality of a fine dine restaurant and a take away counter. Take away counters usually serve tummy filling food with less ingredients & more spices for much less price point. So in that way taste varries a lot.

Thankfully this branch of Noodle 'n You at Kalikapur doesn't compromise on the ingredients while making your order. As result you get quality food like a good restaurant delivered to your home. We were 7 people and had followed items...

Drums of Heaven (4/5) :
--------------------------------------------
It's quite a common chicken starter nowdays. Unlike other places they didn't made it completely dry and only fried. Well cooked big sized chicken lollipop pieces was nicely tossed in sweet & sour sauce with onion and capsicum. Soft & juicy chicken tasted & felt really good in mouth. Its a must have starter over here.

Chicken Cantonese Noodles (4/5):
-----------------------------------------------------------
Mixed vegitables gravy with lots of shredded chicken with boiled noddles its a complete dish to fill hunger. In vegitables baby corn & mushroom made this dish much healthier & tasteful. Quantity was more than satisfactory. Its best dish if a single person ordering it for meal.

Seven Jewel Fried Rice (3.5/5) :
--------------------------------------------------------
As per its name, it was mixed with 7 vegitables. Unlike other places they used broccoli & baby corn along with common carrot and french beans. Taste wise it was lite and easily suitable with any side dish. But quantity seemed to be a little less to me.

Hot Garlic Chicken (4.5/5) :
------------------------------------------------
The best side dish that suited well with their fried rice. Chicken pieces were exceptionally good in this dish that after a bite it exploded with mouthful of taste & its juicy filling. Gravy was very well balanced with the flavour of garlic and sweetness of traditional spices.

Fish n Chilli Oyster Sauce (4/5) :
-----------------------------------------------------
Big sized fish pieces mixed & well cooked in dark oyster sauce with vegitables like mushroom in it. This dish was full of rich flavour and was enough in quantity. Fish pieces were extreamly soft that melted in the mouth with decent taste. Good thing was this didn't smelt like fish that few people hate.

Sweet n Sour Prawn :
---------------------------------------
Due to god given allergy, I couldn't try this prawn dish that my group members actually enjoyed eating by showing it to me. But I observed that the prawn pieces were big and the gravy was containing pineapple, onion and bell papers. That seemed to be delicious.

Pricing :
-----------------
All the dishes are well priced & actually value for money considering the ingredients & quantity of the dishes. Our total bill was near to Rs. 2300 for 7 people.

Conclusion :
----------------------------
Noodle 'n You is a perfect take away counter if you are looking for balanced quality food in Kalikapur. Next time I'll surely try their more famous dishes like Thai Noodles.

Had ordered a lemon coriander soup and a plate of steamed chicken momo via swiggy. As the swiggy food festival is on got a 20 % discount. Coming to the food the soup was really good in taste with perfect seasoning and the right zest of lemon & coriander. Truly enjoyable.  The steamed momos come with a soup unlike the broth served everywhere. The momo soup is also delicious with egg dropping and seasonal vegetables. The momos are absolutely the no nonsense category they're sufficiently filled with chicken mince and nothing else like loads of onion chillies spring onions. ..only seasoned flavoursome chicken. .the dimsum wrapping is professional neither thick nor thin . I just slashed the mark for the sauce it tasted like the bottled red chilli sauce and not the fresh red chilli & garlic dip which is pure love. So if that change is made its a perfect score for the food I've had from here. Recommended. Happy chomping 😊

Located at Kalikapur, this food joint delivers you mouthwatering Chinese dishes right at your doorstep at reasonable prices. So, no more going out just to have a fulfilling meal because you can have it right at your home. You can also avail their take away facility if you live too far. 

On our menu was:
√Drums of Heaven: Eight large pieces of Chicken with a slightly spicy undertone and served with onions and capsicums. Loved this one. Rarely have I seen Drums of Heaven being served with onions and capsicums. Highly recommended. 

√Chicken Cantonese Noodles- Delicious Gravy Noodles consisting of large sized chicken pieces along with mushrooms and baby corn. The quantity was great. One bowl of Cantonese Noodles is enough to fill you up for the day. 

√Sweet and sour prawn: Big sized prawns in a unique tangy sauce. There were also mushroom and pineapple present in it. I wanted more of the tanginess after the gravy noodles, nevertheless it tasted brilliant. 

√Fish in Chilli Oyster sauce- This one was one of my favourites. I loved the mild spicy taste of it. The fish was really soft and smooth and dipped in oyster sauce. Recommended. 

√Seven Jewel fried rice- This one really impressed me a lot. There were so many veggies present in it. It's an exotic veg rice consisting of Broccoli, baby corn, green zucchini, yellow zucchini, peas, carrots, beans. A must have for both vegetarians and non vegetarians. 

√Hot Garlic Chicken- Medium spicy dishes with big sized boneless chicken pieces in a Hot Garlic sauce. Minced Garlic was present in the gravy which I loved. This one was one of favourites too. 

This is a go to take away joint for sudden Chinese cravings. One things that's worth mentioning is how generous they were with their portions and the abundance of veggies that were present in each dish. Makes for a healthy meal afterall.

Well the resturant is located at Kalikapur crossing. Its home delivery or take away only. 
The resturant serves some delicious chinese dishes.
Some of the dishes that i recently had from the resturant :

● Seven jewel fried rice (3.5/5) - Rice contains different vegetables in it like broccoli, peas n all other than carrot and beans only which is really surprising.
● Chicken hot garlic (4.5/5) - This is perfect to be shared by 2 or 4. The gravy is thick and has spicy flavours in it. Chicken pieces are big enough. 
● Fish chilli oyster sauce (4/5) - Fresh fish are used. These are fried and they dipped into the oyster sauce gravy.
● Chicken drums of heaven (4/5) - The chicken lollipops are served with fried onions and capsicum. 8 size chickens are served.
● Prawn sweet and sour (3.5/5) - Prawns are of good size. The dish is cooked with different vegetables and pineapple to give unique flavour in it.
● Mixed Cantonese noodles (4/5) - This is something special. Gravy consists of different vegetables with big sliced soft mushrooms and baby corns. 1 plate is enough to be shared by 2 people.

As nowadays its hard to find resturants that use a different varieties of vegetables on their dishes. So its relly great that "Noodle 'n You" uses a varieties of vegetables on their dishes. For this reason they deserves 👍

Good quality and quantity are served. A good resturant to give a try.

This has to be one of the best chinese restro in the south kolkata region serving quality and tasty food, of ample quantity and reasonable price. The panko chicken fry is just top notch and their chicken in oyster sauce is amazing, located near kalikapur, be sure to check them out when you're travelling via the kalikapur connector from Jadavpur Thana, you should not be disappointed :)

Recently tried the below items and my observations follow:

Chicken Drums of Heaven-Tasted good and had the right amount of seasoning.It was priced at INR 200 which I felt was a little higher.

Grilled Chicken in Hot Basil Sauce-Pretty unique items as it shredded chunks of chicken in a nicely tossed sauce which had a good amount of fresh basil which resulted in an unique taste.However,I didn't find the pieces of the shredded chicken as grilled in any way.Also,the overall quantity could have been higher considering the price point of INR 190.

The packaging was decent and it was delivered on time.

This outlet is close to my place and i had to try it out... Well i tried the Moon Fan Rice, the color momo and the Pad Thai Noodle

Despite having a string star anise flavor the fried rice was really tasty and had a different zing to it

The momos are one of the USP s of this place.. They even make colored momos with natural ingrediends... No additives... Which is a great thumbs up.. I tried their Pork Momo.. It was yellow in color and very tasty.. Would have loved some more juice though... But ir was gr8... Also the egg drop soup that came along with it was pure delish

But the star of the show was Pad Thai Noodle..Proper ingredients...lemony freshness.. And topped with peanuts..the dish looked inviting right from the word go


Would love to try out their other dishes gradually....Thanks for the nice gastronomic experience@anirbanbhattacharya

So for Sunday evening snack time, we decided to try out this new kiosk that opened near our home, Noodles 'n You. Since we are three people, 2 Chicken eater and one Veg, we selected 1 Veg Pan Fried Noodles, 1 Chicken Lemon Coriander Soup (heard good reviews on Zomato), and Chicken Fried Wanton! Now talking about the food, the most shocking part was when we opened the container and realized the pan fried Veg noodles not hakka like we thought but fried noodles with Veg gravy. Our Veggie friend doesn't eat her noodles like this! I guess it was mistake on our end to not find out before what the noodles will be like. But keeping this surprise aside, the taste of this Veg Pan fried noodles was not very good. The gravy could have been better. We did like the fact that they didn't make it spicy like we requested them too. The Chicken Lemon Coriander Soup was delightful. I personally liked it a lot. But what we were most excited about were Wantons! This was the first time we were about to have Wantons, and I had great expectations. Talking about the flavours, it was good. Kinda like Chicken Puchka if you ask me. Not sure if that is how Wantons are supposed to taste, or we just thought it's like Puchka because of the crispiness, but it was definitely a lot like Puchkas; tiny crispy happiness you wish had lasted longer! Overall, the food was decent, what can be look into is the price. Our bill was 410 after 10% discount, and we thought after tasting the food and the quantity provided, the price could have been a little cheaper.

Noodles n you is an outlet to have Chinese food in affordable price. Basically it is a take away joint, you can also get home delivery and enjoy delicious asian food at your home. It's menu consist of wide array of Oriental cuisines. They have improvised over recipe of countries of East Asia including Chinese, Thai, Korean, Japanese etc. It provides prompt service with quality hygienic food and at an affordable price range. It has 2 outlets in south Kolkata - Narendrapur and  Kalikapur. We visited the Kalikapur outlet. If you want to enjoy​ delicious pan-asian food without a pocket pinch this is the place to be. Would love to order in someday.

On one rainy day I happened to order food from this particular outlet of Noodle 'n You in Kalikapur and guess what, I wasn't disappointed at all. Though this is a newly opened food joint, the staffs here are extremely professional. I had ordered a combo of Rice and Chicken and the food came accordingly along with two more little containers. One of them had a sauce and the other had chopped chillies just the way they serve at restaurants. So they surely know how to keep their customers happy and content. The food too was very fresh and delicious and the amount was enough as well.
Way to go! Good luck 😊

For the rainy evenings, a bowl of soup is a must to set the mood for a culinary feast. Make your pick from Manchow soup, clear soup or lung fung among others. Having scoured the city hotels and restaurants for quite some time looking for an authentic Chinese feast, I would say this one comes as close as you can get for a memorable family time together over some great food with a very friendly pocket pinch.

A take away joint exclusively for chinese, asian and thai cuisine. A good place where you pack your food on the way to your home or just enjoy food delivery by just sitting at home. This place is small, exactly how the take aways should be. However they excel in their taste.

Got an opportunity to try Seafood Coriander Soup, chicken colour momo, veg colour momo, chicken shyafaley, chilli garlic noodles and tsing hoi chicken.
All the items tasted good, the sauce served with the momos were too spicy and it complemented well with the momos. The tsing hoi chicken tasted well, the chicken pieces were succulent and tender.

Overall a very good option for take away or home delivery. Pocket pinch is also not too high, quite affordable. Much recommendable place.

Best of luck Team Noodle n You !!

Became a veggie recently and I'm delighted to be able to find this new destination! Very very glad that the vegetarian food prepared here is very healthy and as delicious and scrumptious as the non-vegetarian items would be. I was also delighted to know that there are 2 separate storage places(large refrigerators) for veg and non-veg items respectively. This is truly noteworthy! Gonna be a regular visitor definitely!

Today I had a lunch with one of my friend here. OMG the Thai Noodles, Hunan Chicken and the Momo were just excellent and delicious. It was a great value for the price. The chef nailed it perfectly. From preparation to presentation every little thing was just perfectly arranged. The Owner of this brand is a very young and a dynamic guy with a solid knowledge on Food and Hospitality. I strongly recommend everyone to atleast try it once...

This place is So Interesting and Innovative! I had quite an assortment of momos, including 'colored Momos' (Not artificially colored but from various vegetables as innovative base colors) and the fillings were varied and innovative too! Loved the Cilantro momo especially. I also ordered for a chef special egg garlic fried rice and was Amazed at the presentation of the dish in a complete egg wrap box. The food is tasty, much light, and healthy. The owner was very friendly and welcoming, the kitchen staff were helpful too, happy to explain more about the food I was ordering. Altogether, a very home-like, clean, yum, Very Innovative Chinese/Thai delicacies at Quite Affordable price. Best wishes to Noodle n You. :)

This is the newest place at Kalikapur. I always love Noodlenyou. I have ordered previously at their Narendrapur outlet. It was definitely a great news for me staying at Mukundapur. I love this place.
