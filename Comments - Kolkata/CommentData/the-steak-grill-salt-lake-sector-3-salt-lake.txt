The steak and grill is a new steak place in salt lake. The food is pretty much good. 
We ordered one chicken steak, pork sizzler, and one baked chicken. The staffs were good but the pocket pinch is a bit high according to the food quality.

Have been to this place lots of times with friends and family. Most recently I went a couple of weeks back and have been meaning to write about this place. Let me tell you, if you love non veg then this is the place. They have an amazing range of dishes to offer from steaks to sizzlers to ribs. I had ordered the barbeque pork ribs and it was delicious. The sauce was perfectly made and the meat done just right. Amongst my other favourites here are the pot roasted mutton and the tenderloin steak. Although the sitting arrangements here are a little cramped and uncomfortable but the mouth watering dishes make up for that.

I went to this resto for lunch sometime in the early December. The reason behind choosing this resto was solely to have Steak. We ordered for a Pork Steak and it was delicious. The ambience is well lit. The service was good. Not too much expensive.

Popped by this place en route my return from some errands in the Medical Council. The decor has a diner-y feel about it. We ordered bacon wrapped prawns,tenderloin steak,ham steak and a pot roasted mutton. The bacon wrapped prawns were one of the better ones I've had. The steak was done medium rare as per our wishes but was a bit unevenly cooked. The ham steak was so-so. The pot roasted mutton made me very happy indeed.It was delicate hearty mutton with baby potatoes,carrots paired with rice. The aroma and the softness of the mutton was par excellence. I'd definitely recommend this dish to everyone.

We put our lives at Steak!

This place can be a quick option for those who have some purpose of visit at Karunamoyee Central Park. So had we, more so because it was 31st night and hence we chose this quiet, little, warm, cosy eatout joint for having our last supper of 2017. Unfortunately, the non chalant and non bothering attitude of the waiters taking order at the table partially ruined our mood. The pot roasted mutton was succulent and generously proportioned to satisfy my husband's tummy. The ratio of basa fish to spinach in Fish Florentine was however a bit too dissatisfying. The disaster was Chicken Cordon Bliue which lacked the finesse of such exotic and exquisite dish. Moreover due to a casual approach of the waiter who was probably sulking on such a special day, I was not properly guided as to the ham stuffing in the dish that unexpectedly reached my plate but was resisted by my palate. Frankly speaking, that really pissed me off because I am not a ham person. The other factor is that the dish was accompanied with boiled veggies, and French fries that could have been opted out for mashed potatoes. The dish was however replaced by Grilled Chicken, this time with mashed potatoes. The redeeming is the dessert - Apple pie with vanilla ice cream and Ice cream Rolls.
This place is okay for quick bites and cafe feel. But for casual dining, one has to be careful and this place is a strict no - no for fine dining and classy meals.
The service has to be a bit more attentive to make the eating experience more comfortable and hazard free. The table arrangement has to be revised and well equipped with accompaniments like olive oil, Tabasco sauce, salt and pepper.

I visited this place twice. The first experience was smooth, the pork steak felt just perfect for its price. The chicken steak was just like what is served in other places, nothing special. The second time, we decided to give try to the same pork steak and a mutton steak. The mutton, as felt by me, was a little undercooked (not like a rare steak, mind you). The fat was asked to be removed but they didn’t bother to remove it, the steak was like, 50% fat and the other half being actual meat. It wasn’t delicious at all. Giving them 2 star because if their price, decor, and occasional good serving.

Went with my family. A very good experience.
I am going to start with the food we ordered-
1. Chicken finger mozzarella stick- Six pieces of the sticks was served with a sauce. Was expecting cheese oozing out. That didn't happen sadly, but nevertheless tasted good.
2. Factory special ham steak- the ham was tender and cooked perfectly to my liking. It was neither overcooked, nor undercooked. It was served with french fries, boiled veggies and a sauce. The sauce wasn't that good, was too tangy. But delicious meat compensated for it!
3. Factory mixed grill sizzler- a great dish. Mutton, sausages, chicken and prawn cooked in a sauce, and served with boiled veggies and french fries. Other than the fact that the amount of chicken was much more than the other meats, it was a tasty dish!
4. Lamb lasagna- this was my favourite dish of the evening. I liked everything about it. Perfectly cooked, perfectly balanced, I would go back for this dish alone.
5. Belgian waffle- my first time trying waffle. I liked the taste and the texture. I would have liked more chocolate sauce in the dish because I couldn't really taste any chocolate. And now, who doesn't like chocolate!
6. Cheesecake- so the cheesecake was cold. Other than than it was creamy and delicious.
The decor and ambiance was pleasant. Service was very good :)

We also had the Orange Flake Mock-tail and Virgin Mohito. For the main course we had the chicken cordon bleu and ended it with an amazing dessert of cheesecake with raspberry topping. Great food.

The Steak & Grill has been one of the newest additions to the Salt Lake restaurant scene, opening barely a year back. It attempts to usher in continental cuisine options in the Salt Lake locality (apart from Sec V). Naturally, for someone like me whose house is a few steps away, it's all excitement on hearing the inauguration of The Steak & Grill.

The ambience is cool and spacious. The music they play in their lounge is really pleasing almost all the time. Waiters and other staffs are super friendly. Now, coming to the food. We had ordered chicken lasagne, minced mutton steak, cheesy potato n pork casserole and barbecue meat pizza. Cheesy potato n pork casserole tasted mostly like potato with a hint of cheese and sprinkles of pork in it. Barbecue meat pizza's crust felt a bit thinner than i had expected but what irked me a bit was the lack of cheese of proper quantity on it. Chicken lasagne tasted well but was too small for a portion. Only saviour was the mutton steak. It was delicious and was never enough for me! 
Pricing is a bit on the higher side but worth a try I must say. Worthy enough to be recommended by me.

Steak and Grill can be rated as an average steak serving restaurant in city. Choice of Steak is less. We had ordered a chicken steak and Grilled Betki sizzler. Sauce in steak was per average and Sizzler wasn’t much enticing to tickle the taste bud. Plus points for friendly staffs and nice ambience. In dessert Chocolate Monte Carlo was again average. To sum up it’s a joint to curb your immediate Steak hunger but definitely not one to die for..

I had visited numerous number of eateries and I love to say steak and grill is one of the best junction. If you are a meat lover you should definitely drop yourself in this place. The joint is easy to locate.... It's near karunamoyee Bus stand. Coming to the ambience The entrance was so beautiful itself. The ambience made me felt like  European cafés. The ceiling and walls were full of cute little graffiti and framed photos.
As the joint's name starts with "steak" so we decided to have (1) Ham Steak and two plates of (2) Minced Mutton Steak. Both of them were divine in flavour. They were served with smashed potato/French fries and sauted veggies. There is always a room for dessert so we had Chocolate Monte Carlo and Rolled Chocolate Ice Cream.... I suggest to have both of them as they are just Heavenly.
The staffs were very prompt and friendly. Overall my experience was quite good.

Located just opposite to Central Park, this place is very easy to locate. The service road infront this restaurant avails you to park your car or bike. The entrance is enthralling. Trees are decorated with bamboo lamps which looks too pretty when lit on during the evening. Ambience is very good. Interior is Beautiful. Service is quick.This place serves amazing steaks. Ham steaks is to die for. Although there is one item to surprise you - live ice cream counter. Must try natural ice cream roll.Has a small cafe attached to it. Prices are pretty high. Stuffs are friendly and polite. Perfect to visit for breakfast, lunch or dinner .

This little place a tad bit difficult to locate..but overall a lovely evening spent..credit goes to this place..the ambience is vibrant and catchy..oozing positive vibes and promising indeed..
We ordered spicy chilli pork at first..i loved the sauce..the pork was good..less crispy..but well tossed with veggies..loved it.
The chicken mozarella stick..one hell of a starter..extremely well marinated juicy chicken with mozarella worked wonders..undoubtedly one of their best starters..
The chicken sizzler was good indeed..flavourful juicy chicken steak with the amazing sizzle made my day..the veggies were good as well..
The mixed sizzler was pretty good as well..the bacon..the pork everything made the dish praiseworthy​..
The pork chop with cajun sauce..ah well..pork chop being a very fatty stuff..i dint like it much..it was well prepared though..but the sauce was displeasing as well..average dish for me..
The chicken stroganoff with penne pasta was an enriching stuff..well cooked pasta tossed with chicken..loved it.
Choco monte carlo is one of the desserts i will cherish for long..ice cream served with chocolate choco chips and wafers..this combo is deadly..loved every bit of it..
The cheesecake was soft..smooth and flavourful..
The kiwi flavoured live icecream..frolls as they say..loved the idea..but flavourwise average..
The cookie and creamwala froll was similar..
Overall..nice experience..a tad bit overpriced but quantity and qualitywise superior..

Recently visited the Steak& Grill factory at salt lake with great expectations. Loved the ambience. 
Cajun fish fry and fish and chips was the best. Succulent properly spiced and melted in my mouth. I would definitely rate it 4/5
Brownie ice cream is a must try there. Though they lacked chocolate syrup which was added later when almost my dessert was over( courtesy to the attitude and serving skill of the waiters). Would rate 3/5
      The worst experience was the chicken sizzler. It was burnt, horrible taste . As if I am having Indian cuisine with lot of tadka in my keema curry. On top of it the waiter kept on arguing that it tastes like this ONLY.Stopped only when I told that I am a food blogger and know what I am saying. 
I will rate -1 to the behaviour of the waiters. And they should do something to the to retain the continental taste of sizzler 
Last but not the least I would rate 2.5/5 to the chicken steak as it was too chewy and not atall succulent.  Attaching the photos . Sorry for the bad click of the sizzler

Amidst numerous eateries,  The Steak & Grill is easy to spot with it's uptown exteriors and European cafe like decor. 
The restaurant is divided into two sections basis your choice of meal, be it a sumptuous breakfast spread or a delish dinner. With a range of exquisite delicacies to choose from, and an excellent service,  The Steak & Grill stands out among existing restaurants and the perfectly cooked steaks,  a specialty dish,  gives the place an upperhand.
Recommended dishes:
Starter - Prawn popcorn
Main course - Tenderloin steak
Dessert - Cookies & cream ice-cream roll

The cute white fence with the pathway leading to the white doors with glass squares is sure to catch your attraction while walking by and if you are hungry and your pocket is more or less heavy, do step in! They have paid attention to keep the decor cute and simple right from the outside to the inside of the restaurant. The little plant pots by the window will make your day. The walls holding various photo frames as well as the ones with doodles with food names add to the quirky look. The bulbs hanging from the ceiling add to the cuteness. The ceiling makes you feel like there has been a ketchup battle in the place! To sum up, I absolutely loved the decor and the ambience of the place.

We ordered one ham steak and two plates of minced mutton steak. We chose French fries over smashed potatoes. The vegetables along with the French fries and the vegetables tasted just perfect! For dessert we ordered chocolate Monte carlo and live natural ice cream rolls of chocolate flavour. Don't you forget to try out the Monte carlo because it's simply divine!!! The other dessert we ordered also tasted great. The food was highly fulfilling for the three of us. 

The service was quite prompt and the staffs were helpful. What bothered us was the staffs walking around while we were eating. Anyway, this is definitely a great place to visit because the place with its amazing decor and food will surely make your day!

If you are a steak lover then definitely it should be in your bucket-list. Pork ribs is the best one among other steaks. Chicken steaks were also good. But be aware to choose the main courses if you are not acquainted with the taste.

The resturent is good, service is great,  the raspberry cheesecake is just awsome. The tenderloin steak was a little bit overcooked but it tastes good. The price rate is ok . Moreover the quality of food is good.

Worst experience ever... tasteless..bland food.
Not even worth rating 1.
Waste of money and time.
Refrigerated and packaged food...
They can't even fry a fish properly...too poor a place to visit.

The cute white fence with the pathway leading to the white doors with glass squares is sure to catch your attraction while walking by and if you are hungry and your pocket is more or less heavy, do step in! They have paid attention to keep the decor cute and simple right from the outside to the inside of the restaurant. The little plant pots by the window will make your day. The walls holding various photo frames as well as the ones with doodles with food names add to the quirky look. The bulbs hanging from the ceiling add to the cuteness. The ceiling makes you feel like there has been a ketchup battle in the place! To sum up, I absolutely loved the decor and the ambience of the place.

We ordered one ham steak and two plates of minced mutton steak. We chose French fries over smashed potatoes. The vegetables along with the French fries and the vegetables tasted just perfect! For dessert we ordered chocolate Monte carlo and live natural ice cream rolls of chocolate flavour. Don't you forget to try out the Monte carlo because it's simply divine!!! The other dessert we ordered also tasted great. The food was highly fulfilling for the three of us. 

The service was quite prompt and the staffs were helpful. What bothered us was the staffs walking around while we were eating. Anyway, this is definitely a great place to visit because the place with its amazing decor and food will surely make your day!

I have never visited this restaurant although I pass by it almost every day, since it is on the way to work. I have, however, ordered in from it a couple of times, which I think entitles me to write a review, because I mostly review the food and not the ambience or service (unless it's exceptionally good or disastrously bad). Let me start off by saying the price of the food, when compared to its taste or quality, seem to be quite high. Here are a few items I have tasted from this place:

1. Crispy fried calamari: It's really disappointing when you order something "crispy fried", and the food comes all soggy and droopy. The calamari felt squishy in my mouth, and I doubt whether they were even fresh. There was little to no seasoning, and it tasted very bland.

2. Chelow kabab: The Iranian national dish, modified for and popularized in Kolkata by Peter Cat, is a personal favourite of mine. However, the Chelow kabab served by The Steak & Grill, Salt Lake seems to be a bad excuse for this dish. The chicken kabab didn't even taste like a kabab. It was bland and dry (I actually had trouble swallowing the pieces) and tasted like yesterday's leftovers. Since the chicken was dry without it being over-cooked, I am fairly certain that fresh chicken wasn't used. The mutton sheekh kabab, too, was dry, but was not as bland as the chicken, though I can't say the choice of spices was great. The veggies comprised of two slices each of half-burnt, half-raw bell pepper and onions. The rice was under-boiled, and I wouldn't be surprised if it was re-heated. At least they fried the egg properly, but as seems to be the norm with them, there was no salt and pepper seasoning on the egg.

3. Cajun fried fish: In fact, I did not dislike this item as much as the other two. The fish, at least, seemed fresh, and the frying was done properly. The fish felt light, tender and juicy, and left a pronouced hot after-taste of the cayenne pepper which I enjoyed. Sadly, apart from the cayenne pepper, the flavours of the other spices used in Cajun style cooking, like paprika, bell pepper, parsley, green onions, and most importantly, garlic seemed to be missing.

I came to know about the place during puja time. Today we decided to have lunch here and we don't regret at all. Very nice interior made the first impression. Very simple place with simple menus but the food was really good. The steak and mix sizzler are appreciable. The quality and quantity justify the price also.

This place is amazing. Just near central park you will find it. So it is easy to locate. The place is spacious and well decorated. The service was proper. The price was decent enough . We ordered barbecue pork ribs and tenderlion steak with bacon. Oh my my! The steak was amazing soft juicy and beautiful. Very well cooked the meet was soft best steak i ever had. The barbecue pork was great too. The bill was around 850 for two dishes. We thought of ordering more but both the dishes was very heavy.

Located in salt lake... had high expectations from the place but was disappointed. There was power failure and it took long for lights to come. Servers were not upto the mark. 
#long island iced tea had no flavour. 
#aerated drinks had no fizz in it. When requested them to change it wsd sgain the same. 
#crispy fried calamari- too less quantity n no flavour
#mozarella stuffed meat balls- was flavourful
#mutton steak, #pork chop,# grilled fish- 
All 3 were okayish. Quantity was too less. 
Pork chop was good. 

Overall just about ok. 
Lot of scope of improvement

Lovely ambience to begin with, and the food was at par. I called for a tender loin steak medium rare and it absolutely lived up to my expectation. The meat was tender and juicy and not at all over cooked. The bekti sizzler was amazing too. Very courteous staff and extremely cooperative. Overall a marvellous experience.

Was an absolute garbage of a place. We had ordered mojito and becon tenderloin steak. Mojito was good, but the tenderloin was such a disappoinment. It was bland it was raw, it was cold in the middle. I couldn't expect anything worst than a cold steak. Avoid this place.

The look of this place is quite attractive. They have to separate sections, one fine dining and one cafe. The décor is eye pleasing with dim lights, painted walls and retro frames all over the walls.
The staff are quite helpful.
The menu is vast and not very hard on the pocket.
For food we ordered tenderloin steak with bacon, barbecued pork ribs, chicken sizzler, chicken steak, chicken spaghetti pasta. The beef and pork dishes were great, one of the best beef dishes I've tasted in the city. However chicken dishes were a bit turnoff. For beverages we took virgin mojito and hot chocolate which again were turnoffs. The dessert cheesecake with raspberry topping was not at all upto the mark and too costly.
All over an average experience, but would recommend for their beef and pork dishes.

My review might be a little bit confusing. This was my second trying of pork and I finally realised that it wasn't for me. It was not the problem of the restaurant or anything. It's just that I don't like pork. My friends loved the dishes though. The ambiance of the restaurant overall was awesome and the food quality, price and service was amazing. I tried the Pork Chop and the Ham Steak. I didn't like them much. But my friends loved them so you might conclude that the food is great(just I didn't like it much).

The big signboard, door and the bright red walls are first to catch the attention at this place. A 5 mins of walking distance from Karunamoyee, this place is easily accessible.
We went there on an afternoon and were readily tended to. The place is done very nicely and the paintings on the walls and the movie frames are bound to catch the eye.
Coming to food, we had ordered mojito, tenderloin steak and spaghetti carbonara and brownie with ice cream for dessert. I wasn't sure about the carbonara but it was made to perfection. The tenderloin steak was cooked as said and it was delicious too. The gravy and mashed potatoes tasted equally good. I only wish they serve their food in a more neat manner.
The mojito was quite refreshing. It was the brownie that disappointed me a wee bit. It was a tab bit dry than it is supposed to be.
But overall it was a good afternoon with great food.

Hi, couple of days ago, with very high expectation (unfortunately), I visited this outlet.  My order was grilled pork ribs, Pulled pork burger and long iceland ice tea.  The grilled pork ribs was horrible to say the least.  Burnt in some places and the rest bring a mixture of rare, well done and raw.  The long iceland ice tea was lacking in any flavour what so ever.  (I am a fan of the ice tea at Yule Cafe).  What I liked was the Pulled Pork Burger.  Am I going to visit them again - NO NEVER

Great place for steak lovers, awesome bacon (just to my liking) perfectly accentuates the fat oil, and also the tenderloin steak was yummy (Please order Medium Rare to enjoy the soft tender beef tearing itself apart) and juicy. The grilled veggies (saute veggies and healthy), and fries was also awesome and crispy. The food (steak platter and sizzlers) was served piping hot, just the way i like. The quantity was really magnanimous, and more than enough for one person to finish an individual meal.The decor of the place was minimalistic and youthful, funky graphics all around (the paintings of grilled protein, sausages etc.) is really spunky and cute. The ice-cream rolls were really good too, my first time and the experience was really good. I also went on Tritiya, and being a bong was super excited to begin my pujo with a stomach appealing sumptuous meal !!!!

The only thing negative was that the staff could be a tad more friendly (although they are good with their product knowledge and well-oiled machines when it comes to the fast service). They could maybe smile a bit more, that is all. And i was really looking forward to their strawberry flavored ice-cream rolls (as that is why i went after reading a review in Facebook) which was not available, but i hope i get it the next time i visit there. Good job guys, please keep up the standard !!!!Recommend everyone to visit you guys !!!!

A long awaited steak restaurant finally in Saltlake. Its been a year since this place opened. Earlier this was the steak factory now its steak and grill. But must say that their quality & taste of the food has enhanced after the change. I have tried their barbecue pork ribs, chicken ala kiev, fish florentine and chicken steak. All the dishes r equally delicious in its own way, the meat is soft & juicy but the fish florentine was a little watery. Will keep trying other dishes as well. The pocket pinch is also reasonable.

I'd like to mention everything about this mini outlet.. A small but comfortable interior.(I'm being obsessed with interior decorations these days as well.) The ambience is fresh with a perfect dash of soft music. This is certainly a place you'd take your friends out to savor your taste buds.. The pork ribs were heavenly. I will go back to check out the salads and ham steak.. But pork ribs are a must... What I felt about this store is a bit overpriced deserts. The deserts could have been far better.. Hence the deductions.. Else it's a cool place to hang out with your friends. Isn't it

This is my second visit to this place and I must admit to the fact that I love it absolutely and keep coming back. Their Prawn 🍤 wrapped with Bacon is a must must try because the bacon 🥓 that they serve is cooked to perfection. The Caesar Salad 🥗 could have been way better and had nothing but cucumber 🥒 and Lettuce in it. Even the dressing wasn't a typical Caesar Salad dressing. Moving on to Chicken Tetrazzini which was 👌🏻 A cheese sauce based dish to suit all tastebuds.

I have already probably written a review about this place. I love this place. Literally love.
But there is just a small thing I'd like to point out. On my fourth visit to this place, this Durga pujo, the Cream of Chicken Soup served was too bland. It was more like chicken clear soup than cream of chicken.
The original Cream Of Chicken Soup was far better in taste and texture and I am genuinely hoping that the quality of the original one remains unchanged.
There is a similar complain with the Virgin Mojito and the Fresh Lime Soda. The tastes we're too off.
Also, I have been trying to have Chicken Cordon Bleu, but somehow or the other there is always something wrong with the place while serving that. The reason for not being able to take an order for that particular dish was the puja rush being too high. You genuinely cannot stop a customer from ordering the dish because there is rush. Hope it is not repeated.
Hence a slightly low rating.
Apart from these we were very happy with the other things served on the menu.
Thank you.
Keep doing great work!

I had gone here for recently wity my friends to have lunch.
We took chicken cheese mozarella stick and macaroni salad for starter.
The chicken mozarella stick tasted amazing and the minced chicken in mozarella melted in my mouth.
Also the veg macaroni salad was delicious.

For lunch,six of us took a steak each.
I took a Chef recommended fish fillet steak served with veggies and butter rice.They added mashed potato on my request. The fish piece was big and soft and tasted decent.Its less spicy with a tangy touch.For foodies who love spiced up food this is not the one other wise it is good.

My friends took chicken steak,Mixed seafood grilled sizzler,poat roasted mutton steak and veg sizzlers.
All of the steaks tasted really good and were wholesome .
Also the sizzlers are awesome here and recommended.

Prices are reasonable
Service is prompt.
They levy only GST on food.
Pocket pinch-1000/- for two for a good meal and it can vary though.

This place caught our attention right when we were craving for some steak on Ashtami evening. The catchy decor and music was quite a mood setter. Coming to the food, we ordered steak and bacon and virgin mojito. The bacon had too much salt and it was not fried properly. The beef stake was raw in the middle portion. The mushroom gravy was too sour. Mashed potato was bland with no hint of butter. On objecting about the raw steak, they cooked it again, making the meat so hard that it was difficult to chew it. The staffs were not at all friendly and they did not allow us to sit where we wanted in spite of the fact that it was almost their closing time and the place was almost empty.

The Steak and Grill is located in Sector 3,Salt Lake. It is conveniently located by the main road.

The place has awesome decorations. The lighting and soft music created an amazing romantic ambience which stole our hearts.

Coming to the food,we ordered :

|| Mocktails ||

√ Blue Lagoon : The presentation was really great - in a bulb shaped glass.It was a refreshing drink.

|| Starters ||

√ Cajun Fish Fry : They offer 6 pieces of fish which were so soft that they melted in our mouths smoothly. Highly recommended !!

|| Main Course ||

√ Chicken Steak : They provide 2 chicken breasts perfectly cooked along with poached egg , veggies and french fries. It was great !!

√ Ham Steak : It has one large piece of nicely cooked ham with poached egg,veggies and french fries. Again, a highly recommended dish !!

The staff were really courteous. But one thing , I would like to point out. We re ordered another chicken steak after being highly impressed with the chicken steak served in the first round. But, during the same time, they didn't cook it to the same level as it was in the first time.

We couldn't take dessert because Caramel Custard wasn't available.

Overall,it was a decent experience.

Given a chance I won't even give this place 1.
To start With the food - given the fact that I visited this place just after doshomi, I give this place the benefit of doubt . Still the pork chop was cold and hard. On top of that the waiter kept on arguing upon the authenticity of the dish. The garlic bread came at the end and the fish sizzler was cold and had no sign of sizzle. Still the waiter kept on arguing over the authenticity of the dishes making us feel that we have no idea of sizzlers.
Wait, this is not final. We were being forced to order another dish so that they can replace the dish that we have ordered.
The waiter was indecent to the extent that one feels intimidated with thier arguments.
Please authority replace them if you want to maintain your good will, so as your cook.

This review for now is incomplete as we did not try grill chicken or steak here. We will try on our next visit surely. Still, here goes our first experience.

The place is well decorated and looks beautiful at night with lit up surroundings. We ordered chelo kebab and sweet corn soup. Soup was great, chelo was good too but far from the original version.

Place seems nice and worth another visit and hopefully, then I will update this review as well 

Visited the restaurant on 4 September 2017.

We visited the place during Durga puja. We were disappointed to find that most of the things on the menu were not available. They were out of pork and could only serve sizzlers and burgers. We had a Mixed Factory grilled sizzler, which tasted good. We also had some bacon wrapped prawns which was delicious. The Cajun stuffed pork chops served with fries and veggies were okay. The mozzarella chicken fingers could have been better. Most of the desserts on the menu were not available also. We could only get some chocolate brownie with chocolate sauce and vanilla ice cream. The brownie was all gooey and soft and delicious. It's worth a visit if more things on the menu are available.

Had visited the restaurant earlier when it was named 'Steak factory'. However, though the name has changed, the interiors haven't. We ordered Cajun fish and shrimp cocktail as starters both were good. I've tasted chicken steak earlier here but this time chicken cheese steak was even better. But the best was the dessert - chocolate brownie with ice cream. It was heavenly. A must try. I will visit the place again for the brownie surely. Staff is also very mannered.

One of the best place to have some continental dish in around salt lake.It had been on my wish list for long,I finally visited this place on asthami evening.Firstly the decor was really quirky and cute.We got a place easily for 5.For starter we ordered,calamiri and fried squid.It was really delicious.Even all the continental dishes were yummy. Special mention to cheese chicken steak and barbeque pork ribs.The ambience was quite.If you want to eat some good food and enjoy the evening,I highly recommend this restaurant.

LOCATION: Situated among a row of restaurants in fe block it is quite easy to find. The signage is flashy & catchy.
AMBIENCE: It is fully wood panelled giving the restaurant almost a diner like look.
SERVICE: It is quite efficient but sometimes it's a tad bit slow. 
MENU: Only the puja special menu was available which is quite short.
FOOD: The chicken steak served on a bed of French fries, sauteed vegetables & caramelized onions was good though the poach was a little too over cooked. The chicken Tetrazzini was good but could have used a little more salt. The cookies & cream ice cream rolls was good though it was super super cold.

The Steak & Grill is a nice & cozy restaurant located near Central Park in Salt Lake serving delightful meals throughout the day. It's one of the rare places open for breakfast outside of hotels. The pricing is slightly high but the quality & quantity of the food served is more than enough for two people to share. The service is also excellent here. The ambience is simple yet soothing. I'd definitely recommend this place & hope to give them a higher (perfect 5!) rating after trying out some other items.

We bought nearby vouchers.

Club sandwich,  fries,  mock tail. 
Taste wise no complain at all. 

Service was also good they know how to treat customers. 

I heard the make beef steak too good.

Booked a table through zomato table reservations and went for dinner. Staffs were very courteous. Service was at par. A bit slow rather. We had to wait 10-20mins between meals. A very nice simple decor. Coming to food, we ordered virgin mohito, bhekti fry, chicken steak, bacon wrapped tenderloin, pot roasted mutton, rolled ice cream (cookies and cream)
and an apple pie with ice-cream. Now coming to the reviews:
1. The entrées were just FINE. Nothing special about the mohito but the bhekti fry was too flaky and crumbly. So much so you can't pick it up with a fork. Be ready to use your fingers. Nonetheless, it was tasty.
2. Coming to main course, the chicken steak and the pot roasted mutton were absolutely delicious. Succulent.and tender. However the tenderloin was not at all "tender". We ordered "medium" (they do give only two choices of medium and medium rare) but it was way over done. The steak was tough and stringy. They gave a special serrated knife for that. The bacons were not crispy but sloppy and bland. Othan that the mashed potato and the gravy were delicious as usual.

3. Deserts were impeccable. The rolled ice cream was heavenly. The warm apple pie combined with the chilled vanilla ice cream fills your appetite with comfort.

In short, except for the tenderloin steak (which was a let down) everything was as it should be. It is advisable to order medium rare if you order tenderloin. A Big thumbs up for the food nonetheless. Amazing food.

Chocolate brownie with ice cream n hot sauce was the best part. 👑👑👑👑👑
But I felt like getting fooled after having the so called Virgin marry drink. Seemed like tomato sauce was diluted and served as drink. Full 👎.

Ok so today (Sunday) I went to this restaurant and it was totally full..I am a kind of person who is really choosy when it comes to food.
We ordered fresh lime soda ( I loved the glass), jungle juice, chicken steak ( not too spicy yet delicious), spagetti with meatballs (ample number of meatballs and was a treat to the mouth), fish steak ( the gravy was horrible it smelled like navaratna oil) 
The ambience was great and the waiters were really cooperative but plz do something to the fish steak gravy
Recommended strongly !!

I have been in love with this place right from the moment my friend introduced me to their food. They serve up some amazing continental fare and having tasted copious amounts of food throughout the country, the steak and grill still fares quite high on my list. 
I particularly love their mutton pot roast and pulled pork burger. But everything else that I have tried here is pretty great too. They have batter fried french fries which is bound to make all french fries lovers like me, delighted. 
However, their desserts are a different story altogether. They do really great brownies but steer clear of the other stuff. The apple pie that we tried wasn't very great and their cheesecakes are really disappointing. On one such occasion, we ordered a cheesecake and we couldn't spoon up more than one bite. They were really nice about that though and quickly changed our order to brownies when they noticed that we couldn't down the former. They even asked if we wanted to cancel our order for dessert (which we refused since they were super nice about it). 
Go there with time in your hand, they do take considerable amount of time to serve.

AMBIENCE: Wooden Furniture, Glass Door & Window, Hand Painted Styled Wall, Frames that hold Photos of Celebrities/ Food etc, Wooden Styled Floor & Mild Lights made the atmosphere pleasing.

STAFF:  Courteous, at least a single staff was always present to attend customers (though except us, there were a couple of customers). They delivered the food within 10-12 minutes.

FOOD: We ordered FISH TIKKA KABAB & CHICKEN SANDWICH. Both the items were satisfactory, the price is a bit high.

DISAPPOINTMENT: there was a fly inside the room which was sitting on the table, food and on us also besides there was a small piece of hair in the sandwich salad.

So, my question is, if I decide to pay a good amount on food, is it wrong expect hygiene and comfort? I would like to ask them to take a good care of hygiene and prevent this sort of situation to take place again.

I can see very good reviews for this place, however my experience was bit different. No doubt the staff were polite and ambience was good. My friend ordered the tenderloin, it was looking no where near to what steaks should be, it was pale in colour and looked like Foie gras. Mashed potato was lumpy and not that smooth. Finesse was suppose to be medium rare it was more towards well-done. Which made the steak very rubbery. Maybe I expected more than what they can offer.

Went there a month back and had the bacon wrapped tenderloin steak. All steaks are served with mashed potatoes and a sauce which was a delight. What was a greater surprise was that 4/5 of us ordered the same steak and all 4 were ordered medium-rare. They made sure medium-rare and rare/medium didn't get mixed up- the chef knows his steaks. One might think that that's the least expected from a steakhouse, but not everyone knows the difference between a cooked and an undercooked steak. 
Job Well-done on the medium-rare!

Went to this place without any expectations, honestly. What won me over was the staff. They were very courteous and had a good idea about the menu. 
We had Chef's special Chelow Kabab, California fish fillet steak and cream of mushroom soup. The bill came about to approx. 1k.
Food was okay, the kababs were well marinated with spices but unfortunately were very dry. The fish was really soft and nice but a bit bland with seasoning. The soup was okay.

Went there on a Saturday.The place is well decorated and has a western theme(America) type theme. We had mutton balls, chicken steak and lamb lasagna. The food were well served and the steak was very good. It was worth the name.However all the food had a bit of extra salt which stopped the dishes from becoming excellent. We request the chef to look into it as the food was very good but this might stop him from getting all the plaudits. If there are beef fans here,do try the tenderloin steak and kebabs.

Went there to satiate my meat craving. Ordered bacon wrapped tenderloin steak. The steak was good, but the 'wrapping' turned out to be just two strips! Also had apple pie, which was damn good.
Ordered cold coffee too, but the milk had gone bad. The stuff were nice though and offered to get me another coffee. The decor was cool. Like so many other little cafes, they had lots of pop culture pictures around, from Presley to Eastwood. Overall okay experience, will revisit.

If you are fond of pork and beef, then this is the place for you. Ordered 3 main dishes and was more than satisfied with all of them. If you are searching for a place to have not only chicken steak but also pork and beef, then you should definitely visit this place. It is located on the main road, just opposite to Salt Lake, Central Park (Sector 3).
1. In appetizer, we ordered "Bacon wrapped Prawn" (pictures 6 & 7)What can I say, it was my favorite. The smokey and lightly burnt bacon wrapping the juicy prawn and dipped in a sweet sauce tastes heaven.It costs Rs.290/plate.
2. From the Steak menu, we ordered "Bacon wrapped tenderloin steak" (pictures 1 & 3)This has to be the best tenderloin steak you will ever have. It was served along with mashed potato, carrot, bean and corn and fried onions. The tenderloin is so juicy and perfectly cooked and along with the bacon pampers your taste bud to the fullest.Cost - Rs.390/plate
3. And last but not the least, we ordered "Barbecue pork ribs" (pictures 2 & 5)
Wow! What an incredible dish, pork ribs in Barbecue sauce and along with potato fries and veggies. I want to say that the pork pieces are one of the best, it is not only hard meat but a blend of the fat and the meat all coupled with the sweet and sour gravy. The pork melts in the mouth.Cost - Rs.370/plate
4. Along with all these incredible dishes, we ordered mocktails too - Virgin Mojito and Pina Colada (picture 4)All prices mentioned above are exclusive of GST.At the end I can only say that I am going to visit this place again to taste all other varieties and may be repeating some from the previous 😉 The ambience is good, you have wooden tables and chairs with a soft cushion to sit. Overall the food here is Fantabulously Fantastic'😍 Also I want to give the entire credit to my husband

The Steak and grill factory is very close to Karunamoyee in FE block. This place is quite renowned so thought of trying this place out one fine evening. The ambience of the restaurant is pleasurable. We ordered Mac n cheese, Factory special ham steak with cheese, Pork chops, Virgin mojito and blue lagoon. The presentation of the dishes were commendable. The order too arrived earlier than expected. The taste of the food was good though the ham steak was a bit hard. The pork chop was the show stealer. It was delicious. The pocket pinch was a bit on the higher side but it was worth it.

What a pity that I was invited to Steak & Grill by my cousin and his wife much after I was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease!! I couldn't have the beef or lamb dishes, I was forced to choose between the two things I hate...chicken and fish...😠 
Having made my choice (Panfried Bhetki sans salt) I have to say I was served a rather large portion fish (150gm) on a bed of greens which came with fries and a salad comprised of beans, carrots and babycorn. 
Although I am allowed just 50gm of protein a day, the moment I started on the fish, I realised how good it tasted despite my initial resolution to have just a third of it I polished it off...without stopping!! It was that good...Salt Lake is a tad far away from home, otherwise I could easily become a regular...

Fantastic mid week lunch time visit. I enjoyed a thoroughly delightful first visit to the The Steak & Grill, at Saltlake on a recent Rainy Afternoon. This is a lovely little Cafe tucked in neatly along the main road of FE Block. The set menu itself was outstanding value for money and I will most definitely return again. The tables are well spaced, the décor and lighting is very relaxing and inviting and there is lovely mellow music complementing the setting. In terms of main dishes, steaks are king here (although there are some very nice sounding non-steak options). Me as directed by owner opted to indulge my inner carnivore and opted for the various dishes on offer. The starter, I agreed was excellent, the steak incredibly flavoursome and all cooked to perfection, with a wide range of side dishes and sauces; all of which were delicious.
                                                                ...

I decided to go on a long drive with my friends one Sunday morning and after an hour drive we all got really hungry and the presentation of this cafe and restaurant is truly what attracted me to this place finally .

We sat at the cafe area and had ordered our breakfast here .
The interior is very hep and pretty .It's brightly lit but could be little more spacious .
The service here is a turn off as the waiter was very slow at preparing the dishes .

We ordered a breakfast platter and egg chicken with bread platter .We expected them to be a little more presentable .
The quality of food is good and the fruit bowl is just perfect to set your mood right in morning .

Price is more on the higher side !

If you are around this area you may give it a visit.

Today I visited there first time with high hope. But experience is not so good. We ordered Chicken sandwich and Pork chop. Mayo was not at all fresh. Some bad smell. I never knew that pork chop comes with a rib. This is first time I had pork chop with a rib and it was overcooked too. TG I did not take my son there who is a die-hard continental foodie.

The Steak & Grill.... just minutes away is a welcome break for continental lovers. The restaurant has got a lovely location just opposite the green central park on the service road, visible from the main road. The ambience and decor inside gives you a feel & charm of an American Diner, along with a very warm and courteous service staffs. Once inside you will have a refreshing view outside seeing the greenery.
We ordered multiple dishes obviously including their famous steaks , my son is fond of their prawn stuffed pizzas which is a change of taste from the usual ones.
Do try their fresh ice cream rolls which comes in different flavours and is awesome. 
Would definitely recommend everyone to try. 
Ideal for families , only thing is their service should be a little fast. 👍

The place is decent not far from karunamoyee, salt lake. The food is good and tasty . But they should add some more vegetarian dishes in their menu.

This place is. Very close to karunamoyee .. right on the main road of FE block. The place is quite spacious with a separate enclosure for larger group parties. The place is nicely done up. Coming to food, we started with the gondhoraj chicken and cheese garlic bread. The chicken was. Quite flavourful and succulent. For main course we tried the chelo kebab and the chicken steak. Both ... were good but the chelo kebab was marginally better. The dessert was a disappointment... we ordered the cheese cake .. but the crust was soggy and the cheese cake seemed a bit stale. Service was also quite slow. Overall a decent place to have some continental food .

Liked the ambience and the location. Very convenient to locate the restaurant....right on the main street. The food is quite good as well. We tried out the chicken steak and mixed grill platter. The ice-cream rolls were pretty unique to look at and equally good in taste. We tried the mango and oreo cookies flavours! Both were quite delicious. Quick service is the icing on the cake! Sadly the tiramisu wasnt available. Hopefully we'll get it the next time I visit the place...cheers!

Very poor service.. bt decoration is very nice! went there near about 2:15pm... Most of the items were not available at lunch time!! We became very confused and disappointed! Though we ordered chicken finger mozzarella sticks, Tenderloin Steak, Grilled chicken in barbeque sauce, chocolate brownie with ice cream and hot chocolate sauce, caramel custard, jungle juice & blue lagoon! The bill was approx. Rs 1800/- All dishes were awful except Chicken finger and dessert items.. I'm giving this rating for decoration only! Wastage of money!

I lovely place to unwind after a long week. Good ambience and food needs a special mention. Menu is not exhaustive but just right that would appeal to all tastebuds.

My pick were, bacon wrapped prawn and the caramel custard is to drool over.

Might need a bit of work on
 - Rosmary sauce
 - Mashed potatoes
 - Add a bit more theme to the cafe. May be a bit more retro.

Just a couple of suggestions:
1.Since the ice cream is a win, why not look at keeping the cafe section of the eatery open a little longer just during the weekends with a limited services of just a few beverages and ice cream. Should be a clear win for people seeking for a cafe with retro music and a late night dessert to indulge in. I would personally want to visit a place over a weekend with my book or catch up on conversation with friends.

2. This could be a far fetched thought but might want to organise something similar in the lines of having an event like Kommune India where individuals share their story. To know a bit more, try looking up on YouTube.

Really great american style diner in kolkata. Tried bacon wrapped prawn, steak and mixed sizzler. Prawn was perfectly  on point, didn't try to complicate things, very pure taste. Steak was really well cooked, but mushroom sauce and mashed potatoes are not up to the mark. One thing to mention it was not Fillet mignon. It was New York striploin. I know people hardly cares about steak cuts here but they can try to put few different cuts in the menu like ribeye, porterhouse etc . There is no need of false advertising when you are selling it for good price. Sizzler was good but ratio of chicken was way more than other meats. 
Last but not the least i liked the ambience of a cozy small eatery. I shall be back there soon.!!!

It's located just near my house. It made my dream come true. Whenever feeling like having steak,this is just a few steps away. Well,I totally love the tenderloin steak,thin crust pizzas and the grilled chicken. Also, the chicken wings as starter. It won't make you feel that full. But it will definitely fulfill your steak crave. Steak lovers do visit..

Steak factory had been on my list since there was just one outlet in the city. Later when it came up just a walk away from home I visited it with my friends. I loved the interiors, the paintings on the ceiling are really good, the picture frames on the walls could have been a bigger though.
Now coming to the most important point, the food. Everything we ate was superb. For starters we took a chicken Ceaser salad and fried calamari rings. Both were good,the sauce with it was bit dodgy though, one can just leave out the sauce. We took two types of mocktails, long island ice tea (non-alcoholic) and Shirley temple. The later was ok, we had wanted to try his non-alcoholic version of long island ice tea, which turned out just to be coke and maybe some tea (!!???). The glasses were quite small too. Now the complaints end there. For main course we ordered a grilled bhetki sizzler, a tenderloin burger, a lamb ragout and a tenderloin steak. Each of the dishes were really good. The steak just perfect! Lamb ragout juicy. Quantity was also sufficient. Oh and with the burger came french fries. What we liked about these french fries,were that these were cooked and did not come from a frozen french fries packet.
We went on to have a brownie with icecream and a chocolate Monte Carlo for dessert, which was just the perfect ending to a fine satisfying meal! The service could be a little faster, but I am definately coming back to this place!

We have been meaning to go there for quite a while and so finally made it there over the weekend. The decor is cute, though a bit like an upgraded college canteen. It could have been a little more comfortable and baby friendly since it is a family restaurant. A lack of a baby chair was disappointing and as a suggestion keep a small kids menu since individual portions are a bit much for the younger ones. With the negatives out of the way let me focus on the positive...the food ofcourse. We ordered bacon and potato soup to start with, yummm and bacony, my little one lapped it up. For my elder one we ordered a mushroom pizza, it was good! Didn't have the usual base of tomato sauce..it was a white sauce based pizza and a repeat order for us whenever we go back! For maincourse we ordered a bacon wrapped steak and a cheese tenderloin steak. I actually did not expect them to live up to the brief of keeping it medium rare, pink and juicy...but they did. The sauce could have had a little more dimension and depth...tasted like a chicken bullion had been converted into sauce. The steak itself though was a hit...and for those prices...a winner. Oh we also ordered a plate of mixed fries. It has baby corn, potato wedges and onion rings. Yum yum u can't go wrong with it. Though next time I'm just going to stick to ordering onion rings..needed more of that. Skipped dessert ofcourse. Couldn't stuff another bite in us. Went back with happy tummies and happy babies. We shall visit soon to try out their breakfast offerings.

Being a huge steak lover its the most suitable place to go nearby. For starters ordered cheese mozzarella sticks and it was bliss. Golden mushroom somehow was not up to the mark.   Irani fish was very soft and tasty. For main course ordered tenderloin steak my absolute favorite! Meat was cooked well in the right heat but the mushroom sauce accompanying it was v poor! My friends went for lamb lasagna and chicken steak. Nothing so fancy about chicken steak , lasagna was good! For deserts we ordered apple pie with vanilla ice cream! It was great! Pocket pinch was also average! Will visit soon !

Steak factory has sprawled its branches in the prime location of Salt lake and to celebrate we decided to pay them a visit.For a late afternoon lunch we arrived at this little cafe cum dinning.The Steak factory near Karunamoyee is spread across quite a large area beautifully decorated.The cafe is separated from the dining area but since it was quite late they requested us to move to the cafe area.The cafe area is much smaller with a capacity of accommodating 10 people at most.The cafe is painted in whites while the dinning area is in rust.The quirky lights adorning the place is going to catch ur eyes.

Our order for lunch
1.pork chop
2.bacon wrapped prawn
3.baked chicken ala nepolitiana
4.mojito and blue lagoon


Their southern avenue outlet is my go to place whenever I have a craving for steaks.The bacon wrapped prawn as succulent and tasty as before arrived on our table and was immediately polished off the plate.The chicken was creamy loaded with cheese sauce.The pork chop could have been a bit better served with veggies and mashed potato.I have had it previously and this one was a tad on the drier side.The drinks quite refreshing and well prepared.Best of luck to team Steak factory for their new venture

One of the most unprofessional customer handling I experienced in recent time by any restaurant! We, three people, went there at around 8:30 PM this Saturday. The restaurant has very tiny space and fewer seating arrangement and as it was a Saturday, the restaurant was almost full (it seemed to be a bad management as they arranged to seat two persons in a four persons table, however, a couple of two persons tables were empty!). I can understand the rush during Saturday night in a restaurant. So, if they would told us that it will take some time to arrange a three persons seat, I could completely understand it, no offence! However, they tried to capitalise on us and arranged a table for us in a room which was completely empty with no persons seating there. The room was locked before yet having multiple seatings. The first doubt came to my mind! Then We realised that the AC of that room was not working! Moreover, they stored different kitchen stuffs in that room and still they offered us to dine seating there, how unprofessional!!! We still kept calm and asked them if the AC can be set to more cool, they denied. Then we asked if they can arrange any other tables, we will be happy to wait. They denied again. We then come out without ordering anything and they just didn't bothered to say something in courtesy. Unprofessionalism at its best!

This restaurant is located right opposite central park , Salt Lake , and has a separate cafe zone that is right next to the restaurant, though they serve the cafe menu at the restaurant as well ! The interiors are warmly lit , well decorated with interesting posters on the wall , and quirky lighting . The staff here are very courteous and the service is fairly quick. The place is usually quiet , so you can have a conversation without having to strain your ears. The bacon wrapped tenderloin steak was juicy , served with boiled vegetables and mashed potatoes on the side. The chicken and mushroom risotto tasted creamy , with a slightly spicy chicken gravy on top , but the rice used could have been better . The hot chocolate was however , not thick enough , and tasted like chocolate flavoured milk. Overall , a great cafe / restaurant that has a menu that's sure to keep you coming back for more !

I have been to this place twice. The place has a nice ambience and has limited seating. Located at the heart of salt lake city, one can easily avail google maps or cabs to reach this place.The interior is quite nice with efficient staff. Coming to the food --

PORK SIZZLER--The pork sizzler was tasty but the meat was a bit hard. It was served on a sizzler dish with veggies and french fries. The freshness of the food was what attracted me the most. The steamy appearance was the catchy part of the entire presentation of the food.

HAM STEAK--The ham steak was cooked real nice. Again this was served with boiled sautéed veggies and fries. It was cooked fresh and the dish was not spicy at all. Tasted real good and nice.

CHOCOLATE MONTE CARLO--The chocolate monte carlo is pure love. A must try for everyone visiting this place. A perfect desert that can lift any mood. It was basically chocolate mousse spread on a layer of brownie/cake decorated with choco sauce and choco chips.

The place is also budget friendly. Do I want to visit again? Yes absolutely need to try more.
Refer to pictures in my account to get a view of the items I have tried.

Overpriced.
Your average take on steaks and burgers without much flavour.
Seating arrangement could have been better as it practically uses a long hallway.
The chicken sizzler was the only thing good that they could offer.
Will have to think twice before visiting this place again.

We went to this steak factory outlet to have some quick snacks. Ordered gondhoraj chicken and Tenderloin Steak. Gondhoraj Chicken was the worst recommendation I have ever had from a waiter. Tenderloin Steak was good and very well cooked.

Pros: 
+ Location: situated near karunamoyee on the main road opposite of central park.
+ neat and clean. Very well maintained.
+ good place to hang around with friends if you are not that much hungry. 

Cons:
- quality and quantity wise it is a bit costly restaurant.
- waiters are not attentive. They don't even bother to refill my glass with regular water.

Previously, I went to steak factory southern avenue and I must say southern avenue's branch is much better than this.

A small one opposite Central Park in Salt Lake.
Decor is nothing to write home about.

The food. We ordered a Factory Special Cheese Tenderloin Steak, a Bacon Wrapped Tenderloin Steak, a Pot Roasted Mutton, a Lamb Meatballs Pizza and a virgin Mojito.

The steaks were really good living up to the name. The pieces of bacon were so nice and crispy an had a hint of burn, which I really like. Good quantities too.
But, don't order a pizza when you go here. The one we had was so bad. The meatballs were overcooked but stiff, the dough was stale and they didn't give extra cheese. Hated it.

Go here for the steaks. Really tasty and tender. I had them done medium rare though.
Recommended.

Had dinner. Ordered a virgin mojito, mozzarella stuffed meatballs and the minced mutton steak. Mojito was meh. Meatballs and steak were both oversalted and rubbery. Fries and onion rings were the high point of this meal, sadly.
The decor is corny at best, and I don't know why there was some Enrique mixed in a mostly hard rock and metal playlist.
Heard the tenderloins are better, though. Planning to give them a second chance...

I went with my friend and we both ordered a chicken sizzler and a chellow kebab. The food and portion was reasonably good but not outstanding...but what baffled me was the high-handed behaviour of the entire crew...right from the waiters to a person who introduced himself as the owner. Pretentious, rude and uncouth behaviour was meted out to us when we wanted to order more food ! They explained that their motto is ..."the customers need to order all the food at one go". That was ridiculous and when we said we'd like to order more, the misbehaved owner shrugged his shoulders in the most defiant and dismissive and insulting manner! I wouldn't recommend anyone visit this place unless you want to spoil your mood and a nice evening! "Wreck Factory " is what it turned out ...

Finally went to the steak factory which  , the main thing is that the food are delicious and healthy but the prices are too high according to the quantity of the food . Like the we ordered gondhoraj chicken as starter which cost ₹180 which contains only 4 pieces of chicken . Then we ordered chicken salad which costs ₹240 and it contains full of cabbages , some stripped chicken which is very less and some small crispy breads which for which the price is set to ₹240 . But the chicken steak and live ice cream rolls were the best and the price is also ok ok . The ambience is very good with nice decorations and painted walls . So overall it was great pleasure visiting the steak factory and hope to go again soon .

Tastefully decorated interior, although I loved the entrance. Coming to food, we ordered barbeque pork ribs, factory mixed grill sizzler and ice cream rolls! Pork ribs were tender and its sauce was amazing.. Mixed Sizzler was not bad they served what they promised..but I went licking my ice cream roll's spoon...too much tasty!!

Writing this review while still seated at the restaurant. The first experience has been terrible, quite unlike the experience at their New Alipore outlet. And it all boils down to the staff behaviour. There were empty tables so seating was promptly given but then took forever to get the menu, and after they did, never came back to take orders. The person taking our order, Tapas (or Tapan) Giri was outright rude when asked why it took them so long. He even refused to call the manager saying that the place is running without a manager! If that is true, then I don't blame the staff for the mismanagement. If not, then the owners need to do something about their staff behaviour. Because good food can leave a bad aftertaste if not accompanied by courteous behaviour!

This restaurant has been on my wishlist for a  really long time and finally got a chance to visit it on my moms bday. Well it really stood up to my expectations. The interior decorations and ambience is really good and comfortable. A really great place to eat and gossip. The staffs are really great and they gave us really great suggestions on what to eat. The order time is amazingly short and the service is also great.
As for the food , it was super, totally standing up to my expectations. We had order a lot of items.
For the apetizer we had ordered the followings
Cajun fish fry- had this for the first time. Its basa fish marinated in cajun and  roasted. It was really spicy and sweet. A perfect combo since the sweet and spicy flavours were really well balanced.
Gandhoraj chicken- fried chicken marinated in gandhoraj lime. Its was nothing special as such. But the taste was good.
We had also ordered soft drinks which were served in a  really cute jar. It looked really cool.
For the main course we had 
Mutton steak- made of minced mutton and served with fries and vegetables. The taste was good.
Mixed grilled sizzler- consisted of mutton , chicken, prawn and mushroom served with fries and boil3d vegetables. It was also nicely balanced and tasted good.
Pot roasted mutton- mutton slices served with rice and boiled potato slices and onions. Personally i dint like it much as the mutton was really tough and had to put a lot of effort to cut into pieces , aven the taste was nothing special as such.
Finally for the bbq pork ribs- pork ribs barbequed and served with bbq sauce was really awsome and tasted great. It was the best dish among all those we ordered. 
For desert we had order cookie and cream ice cream rolls which was apt for the dessert. We liked it alot.

Overall its a great restaurant if you dont have monetary constrains . The quality of food is really good but it will surely burn a small hole in your pocket.

I have always been a lover of steaks and Steak Factory is the undoubted winner when it comes for steaks! So went to their Saltlake branch. The interior is really nice and spacious in comparison with their southern avenue outlet. The walls and ceilings are painted with catchy lines related with steaks. Nice wall ceiling and lamp shades makes the place more soothing. Perfect for family outing or even for a romantic date.
Now for the foods ordered CHICKEN STEAK and CALIFORNIA FISH FILLET STEAK.
*CHICKEN STEAK is one amongst their signature dishes. Chicken breast filled with generous amount of sauce and cheese topped with a poached egg. It was served with potato wedges and sauted veggies and caramalised onions. Good in taste. The amount was enough for 1. (3.5/5)
*CALIFORNIA FISH FILLET STEAK - This is the first time had tried any fish steak. And it didnot left me dissapointed. Large portion of deep fried basa fish fillet in a bed of sauce served with rice and boiled veggies (baby corn, beans and carrots). Tastes nice. Portion was good for 1. (3.5/5).
The taste of steaks was better in their southern avenue outlet. But neither this outlet left me dissatisfied. We were full to try any dessert.
Our total bill was Rs 747.
So all in total in accordance with the ambience quantity and quality of the food the place is really a good option to go for.

Oh god.. What do i say.. I dont know how many ppl praised the place so much.. That i finally decided to drop in there for lunch..! First of all.. The place is a pocket cutter.. The prices are so hike and the quantity is so lilttle.. We ordered bacon wrapped prawn (they gave six little pieces which was good but nothing wow..).. Gondhoraj chicken (4 pcs of chicken strips which was too basic and ordinary for such a hiked price)  mozarella cheese sticks (totally spices less.. Chewyy.. Tasteless), bacon wrapped tenderloin (most horrible dish i have ever tasted i guess.. The smell was so foul.. I instantly felt like puking.. The beef was hard.. Nd foul smelled..we had to waste the whole dish for which we paid a whopping 390 bucks).. Last but not the least..cookie and cream ice cream rolls (heard a lot of praise about it.. So it was definitely in our list.. But.. Again disappointed.. It was so sweet.. Dat we literally felt the sugar cubes rattling in our mouth)... All in all.. A very average experience.. M never visiting this place again..

A big fan of the Southern Avenue outlet. When this sister unit opened up so close to my accommodation my foodie instincts were the happiest. 
My friends and I were to have a quick lunch so we went to this joint to find out it has two segments, the restaurant and the cafe. The ambiance is gorgeous with a hint of peppy. 

They have very courteous staff who know how to deal with the customers and their choices. We ordered our respective steaks and no appetizers because we were on a rush. We ordered three bacon wrapped tenderloin steak , two factory special chicken cheese steaks. For dessert we had cookies and cream ice cream rolls and virgin mojito. 

We had ordered for medium done tenderloin steaks and it was done to perfection. The insides of the steaks were pinkish in colour and so juicy. The bacon was done well but not crispy. These had herbed mashed potatoes and assorted veggies as sides. 

The chicken steaks had generous amount of cheese and sauce and were topped with a poached egg. Crispy potato wedges, pickled onions and assorted vegetables were served as sides. 

Needless to say, the steaks were lip smacking good. And so we're the ice cream rolls. Each plate has four rolls topped with chocolate wafer sticks and chocolate syrup. It's a must try.

Had high expectations..but none of the food was upto the mark...and way too costly for dishes like that..
beacon wrapped prawns was way too soft
Factory cheese ham steak had no cheese..
And factory mix grill was okaayish..

Been here a month ago, but forgot to write review. The ambiance is good. There was guns n roses playing while we were there. Cocktail sausages and bacon wrapped prawns were really good. We also had pot roasted mutton, tenderloin steak and ribs and all of them tasted nice. The desserts were nothing special. They should look into it. Prices are reasonable. Overall, a good place to have steak.

Near to karunamoyee..salt lake.. Has a beautiful decor.. Its a medium sized cafe serving mouth watering delicacies.  The service is quick.  My recommendation will be the sizzlers as they are really good here.  I have personally tried the mixed sizzler and the pork sizzler.. The pork they serve here doesn't have fat layers.  Lamb Lasagna is good too. This is a pocket friendly cafe so do visit this place with your loved ones as it is highly recommended.

An wonderful place and delicious food! ❣️

This evening I went to this joint. It's near BMS School. This restaurant is very well decorated. The atmosphere is soothing. 

Let's come to the food.

We ordered one Lamb Lasagna, one Pot Roasted Mutton and one Cold Coffee. Lasagna was too good. Mutton was tasty too. I loved their Cold Coffee. 

Overall it's a brilliant place to eat Continental Food. 🙂

I visited this place for lunch yesterday. We ordered the Bacon Wrapped Prawns, Pork Chop, Tenderloin Steak, Chicken Steak, and Cookie and Cream ice cream roll. We went there for a late lunch and had no problem in getting a table. I don't know about how crowded this place is at peak lunch and dinner hours though. 

The ambiance isn't anything great but it isn't bad at all either. They have an old school vibe with lovely iconic framed pictures on the walls and there's a lot of red colour inside which gives a lot of warmth to the place. I liked the music they played as well (no regular trashy Bollywood stuff). 

The service is prompt and good. No complaints in the regard.

I loved the bacon wrapped prawns! The chicken steak wasn't anything great. I've definitely had better. Moreover, the chicken wasn't well cooked at some places. The sauce was good. I really liked the ice cream rolls. One portion was enough for three people! A perfect sweet ending. 

The place isn't heavy on the pocket at all and it's good for a casual lunch. :)

What a place. Suddenly invented the place today morning for breakfast and I was amazed by their preparation. Nice decor with a small but interesting lawn. Ordered toast,ommlette with chicken, grilled club sandwich. Ommlette stuffed with cheesy chicken and properly cooked. Sandwich served with french fries and tomato sauce.
Foods were fantastic with quite reasonable price. 
Highly recommended.
Will come again.

Absolute peach of a place: A must visit for anyone who loves good meat. We had bacon wrapped with tenderloin steak, chicken steak and minced mutton steak, and all three of them were delightful to say the very least. The Bacon was the best of the lot, and I could literally taste the juices flowing in my mouth while eating it. The ambience is delightful, and it is a thoughtfully decorated place. The staff is friendly and it is located in a beautiful locality as well.

Definitely coming back soon.

One of the best places to have exclusive continental food. The staff is very friendly and are always ready to help you out. They even give suggestions of their own which I feel won't be dissatisfactiory. You can even customize your orders. For example, we wanted the chicken steak in 4 pieces as per our request although the dish comes in 3 pieces (amount of chicken was same but cut into 4 pieces). Moreover, we were wished to celebrate a friend's birthday with a brownie. They provided us a candle and a cake stand for us. Also service is quite fast than expected.

As far as the quality of food is concerned, it is unquestionably good. The chicken lasagna is perfectly layered and well baked. Cheese quality is good. Chicken sizzler is equally good. The chicken is very tender. Also, the brownie is muddy and is certainly worth a mouthful. Lastly, do not forget to try out the ice cream rolls. On the whole, this is a place where money can bring you happiness.

Just one suggestion while entering the place you have to choose between restaurant and cafe; they have both.

Went there yesterday night, ordered bacon wrapped steak in which the steak wasn't wrapped as the name specifies, I could let that go but the steak was like poached and not seared and the bacon was raw and boiled. The mushroom sauce that accompanies it was like a slurry, don't know what to do with it 
The pork ribs don't really have ribs. It has huge chunks of inedible fat.
Not a place I would advice people to go for this kind of food but yeah the French fries are great

A place that is named "Steak Factory" makes you expect really good steaks...well that's exactly what you don't get here... totally disappointed by the quality of steak and sizzler...the desert is still good...my advice...if you really want steak...go somewhere​ else...you'll pay as much...but get much better quality..

Very poor service. Since we were only two people at around 5pm they felt it was okay to make us sit in the cafeteria and gave false excuses, as one of the employees said the AC wasn't working in the restaurant area and one said it wasn't clean enough to make people sit. While after some time we saw people coming in pairs and being seated in the restaurant area. It was a humiliating experience. Don't know why and on what basis do they make such judgements. They weren't even apologetic on being questioned. Food was okay. The meat could have been tender of the sizzler. Steak was edible. The caramel custard was horrible, seemed like something gooey was floating.

Taste of food is very so so...mixed grill sizzler had just two prawns in it. Quantity served is good. The New Alipore one is a much much better version, its d best outlet of all. The time taken to serve in this salt lake one is really pathetic. Service of d waiters was also not good. Never going again here. New Alipore: c u soon!

Small place located near central park however the entrance has a small yet beautiful lawn with dangling lights which makes you feel like you are  visiting your granny's place . Heads up for attracting people . We went in 3 and ordered one of their suggestions which was  gandhoraj chicken - it  had succulent pieces of meat and had a tangyness added , a little spiced up to give you that nice feel of chicken . Totally pleasing as a starter and then we ordered fish and chips where the fish was so fresh that i could feel it melting in my mouth just a second after and it was crispy at the same time . For main course we ordered chicken steak which was good as well , the broth with the chicken breast had me blown . Over all the place is just a good food joint for a meat lover and a foodie . Will be going back soon to catch up on ham steak and other sea food dishes , in love with the place . Loved the owner who herself took our orders  . It was so nice and appealing to see a young girl to do a great job , keep it up .

Went there to celebrate my wife's birthday. Ambience resemble that of American style cafe. They will explain every dish and also give suggestions. Hospitality was really nice. Now coming to the food. Started with thier recommendation of  Bacon wrapped prawn which had more flavour of bacon but hardly any smell of prawn although it tasted good but overall couldn't understand the purpose of adding prawn in it. Please​ don't ever think of ordering lemon ice tea as it is horrible so I ordered virgin mogito instead.Also stay away from float cola. Then we tried 
California Fish fillet steak and it comes with rice. Flavour of the sauce did not tasted good.What blew our mind was Factory grill,which is absolutely must try. It is combination of grill of chicken, chicken sausages,mutton roast,prawn, veggies & mushroom. We then had chicken steak,which was good. We would love to visit again but they need to improve on these dishes.Hope next time whatever we will had will be better. Also keep in mind that this place is not that much pocket friendly but also not expensive.

Having very good times whenever visiting this place. Live ice creams are currently on my hit list on this Mango season. Steaks are ok, in the name of Beef Tenderloin, I'm not getting that proper Cut, here they have to improve. All the Burgers are too good and Sizzlers also. One day got disappointed when they over fried pork chops and the replacement was also over fried. Very few staffs are well trained and can understand the expectations, others should learn from the resident staff who really cares about guests. We had recently noticed the Lady from top management and most probably the owner or one of the partners is taking care of valued guests, we appreciate her great hospitality. We like this place and will keep coming..

The food is not at all good. I went there on a thursday evening and i had ordered a margarita pizza. I was quite dissapointed with it,the pizza seemed to be nothing but a white base, on top of which some cheese and tomatoes has been put. It literally did not have any pizza sauce and after eating it i felt like i was just eating the crust and there was no other topping on it. The service is also very poor and slow. I would avoid going to places like these.

Disappointing is the first word which comes to my mind when I think about my visit here.
This place looks awesome the ambience surely didn't disappoint at all. The walls were full of quotes and paintings of popular TV series and characters.
Now coming to the food we ordered chicken ala Kiev , chicken cordonbleu , lamb lasagna , bacon wrapped prawns and brownie.
The food took like 30-40 mins to be served and when it came it was looking very presentable but unfortunately my tounge didn't think of it like that.
It was quite plain and tasteless. I guess my addiction to Indian n Chinese cuisine was the main reason why I didn't enjoy the food.
The bacon wrapped prawns was suggested by the server she claimed it to their speciality but a warning to everyone who tries eat please don't dip the prawns in the sauce which the serve with the prawns it will instantly kill Ur tastebuds n ruin Ur day.
Coming to the chicken items they were like boiled chicken wrapped in some panko coating n served with mashed potatoes , fries  n boiled veggies.
The lasagna was the only thing which was ok but frankly saying I have had way tastier lasagna than this.

I loved the ambiance and the service was commendable. It was a pleasant experience over all. I would definitely suggest that you try their Lamb lasagna, it was fabulous. Their apple pie however was disappointing. But the delicious fudgy brownie with a gooey chocolaty center made up for it.

Had this in my list for a long time. Finally visited it since they had an outlet opened in salt lake being closer than southern avenue. Went on Sunday evening but it was fully packed so we decided for take away. We ordered a factory special fish and a ham steak. Packing was pretty good, boiled vegetables, french fries, fried onions accompanied the steaks. The fish was really well cooked with cheese sauce and had a great taste. The ham steak was also done well  with balanced spices and grilled perfectly. But the only let down was the quantity, with the price being 350bucks a plate, it was really not up to the mark. One steak would definitely not fulfill your hunger. Considering the concept of steak which is generally said to be a wholesome food, this was really disappointing. Unless the quantity is looked upon into, I don't think it's worth visiting again.

I went to Steak Factory yesterday to have dinner with my friend and the best part we didnt had to stand in queue for the table. Food is good.. We ordered Prawn popcorn,Virgin Mojito, Virgin Pina Colada, Chicken steak , Chicken Cordon Bleu .Sitting there few things disappointed me like the inefficient staffs may be there were less in number. They were misplacing the orders and we had to wait a lot for the Chicken Steak and Chicken Cordon Blue so we asked to pack it. Lastly while paying the bill, the staff made a mistake during the transaction and we dint noticed. After that when we were waiting for our cab.. the staff came outside and asked to pay again. Inprofessionalism ruined the first time experience. But the food was great.

Been here on 3rd Jun. We 2 glutton friends had a lot to eat after having suggestions from owner.

Grilled sea food sizzler
Bacon wrapped prawns
BBQ Pork Ribs
Surf + Turk Steak

Ranked in descending order. Last one is beef steak with smashed potatoes and veggies steak was blunt in taste so ranked last. Pork ribs was just above average this was costly as compared to pork and quantity and barbeque sauce tasted more like a tomato ketchup. Bacon wrapped prawn was a good starter I wish bacon wrap was more lengthy. Sea food sizzler had octopus, squid, Basha fish and tiger prawn. This was best among all in taste and quantity.

By the way they accepts cards as well not only cash as mentioned in Zomato.

Ever since The Steak Factory opened in Salt Lake, I was looking forward to visiting​ the same and try out as few dishes. The great reviews had it's effect too. So, here we were... Visiting The Steak Factory for a Friday night dinner.
We went for their house special Bacon Wrapped Prawns. Tasted great. But they should have named it Bacon Wrapped Shrimps because of such small size of the same.
Then we ordered Fish n chips. The batter was crispy and fresh but the basa fillet was almost melting and we had a difficult time eating it with our forks.
We ordered 4 different mains -
1. Risotto - Ordinary basmati rice was used. Was very dry.
2. Chicken Steak - The portion size was too thin and too small. In addition to that, the chicken was not juicy at all.
3. Mix grill - We ate it to fill our stomach. Bits and pieces of lamb, a few shrimps and a couple of sausages in a hastily made mushroom garlic gravy.
4. Chicken Tetrazzini - This was our last order before going for the desserts. Portion size was good. But very less cheese and not baked well.
Finally, we went for their Hand Made Ice Cream Rolls. We ordered a cookie n cream and a mango flavour. Both were good.

The restaurant decor is good. But the air conditioning does not work when they are operating full house with lots of sizzlers being served.

I would like to believe that it was one of those days when things don't go according to your wishes and would surely go back once again to taste the pork chops and tenderloin steak and review them again.

As amazing the food looks, it tastes pretty simple for those who the recipes of cooking barbecue pork and all. They just add the basic things. The chicken steak was - horrible. And the pork ribs were not even ribs! Sorry. All these are also okaay, but the manager is the mood spoiler of all. So rude that two customers actually went up and left. And all the staffs are dead afraid of that man. There's an ambience of fear among them, then how can they make us feel comfortable! Sorry, but really disappointed with this branch. Therefore, I'll suggest to try out the Southern Avenue.

This outlet at Salt Lake is very pleasant and cosy . Seating is adequate for around 20 people and the service is quick . I had visited it with a friend around 6 pm so it was too early or rather to late to eat anything that resembled lunch or dinner . We had a few starters with chicken and lamb and it was perfect . I would like to visit again to taste their extensive menu .

This outlet is located opposite to salt Lake central park. Newly opened outlet after the one in southern Avenue. Half of the items in the menu are not available in this outlet. We ordered crispy fried calamari, factory mixed grill, California fish fillet steak and chicken steak( server with sauteed vegetables and french fries) . Overall an okayish experience.

I 've been to their southern​ avenue outlet before and this outlet at salt lake is great as well. The place was pretty crowded, though it's not unusual for a sunday night. We had Cajun fish fry, pork ribs, lamb ragout, factory special mixed sizzler, fresh lime soda and chocolate Monte Carlo. Each of the dishes were delicious. The lamb ragout stood out among them. 
They are a bit slow with their service, otherwise this place is definitely worth a 5 star rating.

It was a rainy Sunday evening. Had heard of this place. So thought of trying it out. Went around 8:25 and found the place packed. Didn't want to wait, decided a takeaway. Ordered at 8:30. Waited outside at the verandah (no waiting area) with the rain pouring a feet from me. At 8.55 the waiter came with the bill and asked for the mode of payment ! I was like wow !! Such fantastic TAT with a packed restaurant - boy was I impressed ! I paid and happily waited for my order to arrive - 2 mins, 5 mins, 10 mins.. no sign of my takeaway. I go in and ask the maitre d'. To my shock I am told that for all takeaway pre-payment was compulsory. I was like what the hell was I doing half in the rain for 25 mins !!! Seemed now they only take to prepare after you make the payment. For the last 25 mins nothing was happening to my order. Now they are taking the "pre-payment" cause they think I am going to run away after standing and waiting for so long.
Food came at 9:17. I was hungry, kept the package in the backseat and was home in 5. Although had a bad service experience, but was hoping the food to be good basis what little I had read/heard.
First the pizza - the packaging was terrible. They had used a box that had plastic inner coating. It was dripping water from the roof. The pizza itself was all over the box. Lifted a slice, the base was sogged in vapour - tasted like an overdose of cheese on a wet roti. 
Next was the steak - the meat itself was thoroughly boiled and dipped in a very well made mushroom gravy. Appeared the boiled meat was kept soaked for sometime in the gravy. That's about it for the steak. The accompaniments however, were all half done. Especially the onion rings and the veggies. 
All in all a 1.5 rating for some nice mushroom gravy and some new takeaway experience !

I love this place due to the close proximity to my residence. But jokes aside, this brand has won me over with their food and ambience.their rodeo style decor, courteous staff and delicious meat dishes tantalize ur senses. I especially love the large sized steaks that they introduced recently. The best thing about the salt lake branch, the waitors take extra care in case u want ur steaks lean and fat free

There are many Steak Factory outlets in Kolkata.This outlet is located in FE block near Karunamoyee and just opposite to Central Park in Salt lake area.we went there in the Afternoon and the pretty well decorated place was almost empty.
They mainly specializes in various kinds of Steaks(Chicken,Mutton,Pork,Tenderloin) served with sauteed vegetables and mashed potato.

We Ordered : Cream of Chicken Soup, Gondhoraj Chicken, Grilled Chicken and Tenderloin Steak.

# As the name suggested,Gondhoraj chicken was filled with the flavour of 'Gondhoraj Lebu'.
  6 pieces of soft and juicy deep fried chicken strips served with a Mayonnaise Kasundi.
# Cream of chicken soup was very rich and flavourful and served with a Garlic Bread. 
# we were amazed by the portion size of the Grilled Chicken.It was enough for two.
  The chicken was so soft and juicy that the meat literally came out of the bones.It was Delicious.
# The Tenderloin Steak however,was great with flavours,but the meat felt little tough to be cut   properly.(We ordered it as Medium rare).It wasn't as tender as we expected but it was very juicy.The sides were also good.

Staffs were friendly and explained all the dishes nicely to us.Prices were acceptable compare to the portion size of each dishes.They charge only 6% service tax.
Very nice decor with cool ambience.Overall a very good experience. 
Will surely comeback again for other dishes.........

Heard this name for quite sometime but somehow never managed to visit this eatery until 15th May when i dropped in for dinner with a friend. They have around four outlets in Kolkata however i visited the one in Saltlake (FE-12, Sector - 3) opposite Central Park. Adequate parking space (free to use - not owned by the restaurant) available for both two and four wheelers. 

Decor and ambience: What immediately attracted my attention, once i stepped in was the beautiful decor of the restaurant - it was minimal yet aesthetic and most importantly goes with the cuisine they were serving. Well lit, bright colours with attractive wall paints and relevant posters made the ambience feel authentic along with the wooden chairs and table adding to the overall steak house look..

Food and service: I strongly believe no matter how good the decor and ambience might be at any eatery - the real game changer is and will always remain the quality of food and service it provides. The Steak Factory - i have no qualms in admitting is an hands down winner in that respect.. Along with the beautiful decor and an authentic steakhouse ambience, the eatery just wows you with the quality of food and courteous service. We were not in a mood for starters that evening and thus directly went for the kill - ordered SURF & TURF STEAK and PORK CHOP STEAK.. 

1. SURF & TURF STEAK - A catchy name pointing out to a delicious steak comprising of tiger prawns, beef, mashed potato, sauteed vegetables and barbecue sauce. The presentation was great. Tiger prawns were average size wise but tasted great. The generous portion of beef (well made as per request) was the high point of the dish undoubtedly - it was yummy and very easy to bite unlike similar beef steaks at other places. The mashes potato tasted pretty well too. The barbecue sauce added to the flavour and was a worthwhile addition to the dish. If i really have to point out one flaw, it would be the sauteed vegetables served along with the steak - they were almost half cooked - might be an aberration.

2. PORK CHOP STEAK: Yet another delicious steak however this was in the pork territory comprising of a generous portion of pork chop marinated in red sauce, french fries and sauteed vegetables.. The pork chop was again very well made and was a delight to gorge on in terms of taste.. The red sauce marination added to the overall taste.. The french fries were crispy enough and the caramelised onions made the taste buds happy however the only flaw in the dish is similar to the one above - the sauteed vegetables were again half cooked unfortunately..

DESERT: INSTANT HANDMADE MANGO ROLL ICE CREAM - This was certainly like an icing on the cake. The words " Instant " and " Handmade" prompted us to go for this desert in the first place and what a delicious experience that was!! The Mango crepes were super yummy and the taste became better and better as it melted gradually.. The slight sprinkling of strawberry sauce on top of the mango rolls added an unique blend to the overall taste.. Hands down, one of the best desserts that i have tasted in a long time..

The service was prompt and the attendants were courteous  - small but important details like filling the glass on their own with drinking water as and when required without being called upon just left no rooms for complaints. They had thorough knowledge of the items and their ingredients and explained the same as and when requested by us. Over all, they gave us a friendly vibe and even took note of the feedback regarding the food on a very serious note. We were happy to see a check of around eight hundred bucks only which just made us even more happier after an awesome dinner.. The portion  served were more than sufficient and the pocket pinch at the end was certainly economical - what more does one need from a dinner!! Looking forward to my next visit already..

Verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 

P.S: Will be back soon with more reviews.. Stay glued..

This is where I tried steak for the first time so I cannot compare the food with anything else. Went on the recommendation of a friend.
Ordered 2 tenderloin steak, mine being well done, and one lime soda (which my friend had).

This review is based solely on my personal experience of the steak. The sides accompanying the steak were amazing. But, the steak itself​was too tough. And by too tough, I meant TOO TOUGH. Since it was my first time, I have nothing to compare it to. But, it was not a pleasant experience. My friend seemed to enjoy her meal though.
This rating is solely for the amazing decor, the good sides, and the helpful staff. Price is okay.

Pretty impressive. Quaint, efficient service, delicious food. Everything I look for in a food joint. I almost wished for the bacon wrapped shrimp to be bottomless! The mutton in the pot roast was melt-in-your-mouth tender and delicious. The fish was so fresh and cooked with care in what they call the California Fish Fillet Steak. The wine sauce was mildly spicy and bursting with flavors. A particularly pleasant aspect of this place is the portion size of the main course: more of the main course and less of the side as it should be! Also, great music! Good job to everyone who worked to make our experience here so fun!

Firstly i had steaks all 3 types surf and turf steak ( which the waiter said wud be a tenderloin piece on top of 3 shrimps) .I wasnt sure but he insisted so i agreed. I dont know what kind of people have rated steaks here to be good. They r pathetic. People who say that steaks here r good have never tasted a real steak in their lives. Ok lemme elaborate, it wasnt tender nor was it the loin, I asked for medium rare which i doubt they even heard of and made it brown all through anyways. Secondly the ham steak. ohh my god (face palm) it was a boiled piece of pig with barbecue sauce to hide the fact that it wasnt grilled at all. the meat wasnt tender and tasted horrible, i wanted to vomit. I was really excited to go there as i thought that Finally i found a good steak joint near my place. I am deeply disappointed. Plus there isnt a bacon dish. NOT a meat lovers paradise as it wud seem so. (FACE PALM)

Quite liked the ambience of the place  and had heard very good things about it.  Food was however not upto the mark.  For starters,  quite a few items were unavailable.  Quantity vis a vis price has a great degree of variance.  We didn't try their signature steaks,  so will be back for that the next time.

Ambience is good. It's Warm and cozy. Good reception. Great decor. Good service. But Mixed opinion on food. Some dishes were exceptionally well prepared and some were below average.
Special shout out to bacon wrapped prawns. Everyone got to try that one for sure.
Whereas factory mixed grilled steak was way way below average.
All in all not a very bad experience if one can selectively choose and order.

After reading about this place on zomato,, with a speciality in steaks, that too in salt lake.. I needed to check it out. 
Ordered chicken steak, bbq pork ribs chicken sizzler and veg steak. 
While the sauce of the chicken steak was really nice.. The chicken itself could hv been better and the mashed potatoes smoother.. The vegetables were not at all up to the mark.. So i cn say i have had a better chicken steak. 
Pork ribs were really good.. Again the mashed potatoes n veggies were off.. Veg steak was shockingly nice and the sizzler was good too.. Overall a good experience.. But they need to work on the sides!

Just at a stone throw distance tried out this fairly new joint in Saltlake. Location is superb -- just opposite to Central Park/Bonobitan, near city centre and karunamoyee. And the decor is beckoning. 
But be prepared for long queues even in weekdays. But what I wonder is why the queue?! We went for a weekday dinner, hungry as we could be and waited patiently for our table. It got arranged in about 30mins. We ordered nothing fancy, just the regulars -- chicken steak and tenderloin(beef) steak. It took an hour for them to prepare the regulars!! We were famished. In this situation even the most plain items will taste heavenly to one but our surprise it didn't. Seemed like the chicken steak must been made and kept on racks till tenderloin was prepared. Result, chewy, less than warm chicken steak with almost no seasoning resulting in the blandest steak I have had ever. Sauteed veggies included beans, broccoli, carrots and babycorn but like two sticks of each and again no seasoning at all. Then let's come to the mashed potato which could have saved their grace(given I am a bengali in love with Aloo(potato)) but that messed it up for me completely. Cold, unflavored, lumpy so-called mashed potato ruined the dish for me. Coming to Tenderloin Steak - chewy hard and so small in size. After tasting mine, I had no expectations whatsoever. The mushroom sauce was good though but seasoning screw up in veggies again. 
The staff was courteous and even the manager was nice, when he came up to me for review, I was honest and he took it humbly. But still haven't wished for revisiting after the disaster dinner. May be I will if someone whom I trust can convince me otherwise sometime again.

We recently been there, had a great fooding experience. We had no clue what to try except one keyword 'Steak'.
After long and critical discussion we ordered 4 dishes, namely, minced mutton stake, chicken steak, Lamb Ragout, Factory grilled fish. After having all these we were so satisfied that I started writing a review first time ever. My favourite was the fish preparation (Yes I m a bong).

I will recommend you must try this restaurant atleast once, if not more, and make sure you go in groups so that you can share and taste multiple dishes.

And sorry, I forgot to take the photo of grilled fish before 'partition', photo shows my share only ;)

A friend of mine and I went for a dinner at the Steak Factory where we had ordered for Caesar salad, Cheese Garlic bread, Mutton pot roast and chocolate brownie with vanilla ice-cream and hot chocolate sauce. 
The Caesar salad was good. It consisted of cucumber, iceberg lettuce, cabbage, croutons, cheese and grilled chicken. The highlight of the dish was the dressing and the biggest let down was the over-cooked chicken.
The cheese garlic bread was the best dish... It was cheesy, garlic, crunchy yet soft... It was yummy to the core. We loved it so much that we ordered for two more plates.
The mutton pot roast was tasty but it was not what a pot roast is supposed to be. A typical pot roast is meat and vegetables slowly cooked over hours. The mutton was falling off the bones (which was the best), but the vegetables which included potato, carrot and capsicum were not soft as butter (as in a typical pot roast). The stew was tasty though. The buttered herb rice was the second highlight of the dish.
The chocolate brownie was the weakest dish. The brownie tasted more like chocolate cake than a fudgey brownie. It was extremely sweet too. 
We had also ordered for a lemon tea and virgin mojito... The mojito was better of the two.
The restaurant is pocket-friendly... And the cost was approximately Rs. 1200
The decor and ambience is fun and quirky.

Food was good.  We ordered Gondhoraj Chicken for starters.  It was decent.  But the steaks we ordered were very tasty. Minced mutton steak, pork steak, factory special fish steak all of them were awesome. One thing I felt should be improved is their service. Long waiting for food is very much irritating at times.  Hopefully they will work on their service.

They didn't take long time to serve us. We ordered Crispy chilli pork which was very well cooked. Loved the texture of the food, the taste is balanced, neither too spicy nor too bland or wishy-washy. Had Bacon pizza, which is again tasty. Overall a very good experience, shall revisit again.!!

An American ranch style restaurant..Just 5 min walk from FD park..This small restaurant is having two sections one for cafe one for the dinner.. 
Coming to the ambience it's really vintage styled.The walls are designed with graffitis about foods and photo frames of some famous western movies and artists.with some 90's music which is a bliss to the ears.so a 5 out 5 for the ambience.Coming to the service everything is A notched but when it came to the bill payment they had issue with Thier machine which really not acceptable now a days.If I am being provided a printed bill with all the service tax no & all I would prefer to use my card rather than handing out my cash.Also the menu in the Zomato is out dated.so the price also varies from the real menu at the restaurant.so just 1 out 5 that also just cuz they served me like a pro.Next coming to the food.Just cuz of the summer I backed out on the steaks.I opted a light menu, for the appetizers I had French Onion rings & for the main I had Lamb ragout,for cooling all this had a blue lagoon.the rings were really nice paring them with mint & sour mayo.coming to the lagoon it was nicely presented in a bulb.coming to the lamb I really doubt it was the real deal as it was fatty like mutton also it tasted the same.so this was a bit down for me.So a score of 4 out of 5.Hopefully next time they would like to improve far from now.

The Steak Factory has many outlets in Kolkata.
This one's located in Saltlake,it's just about a minute or two from Karunamoyee.

We went quite late in the evening at about 8:30. And the place looked pretty well decorated with lights on the outside, and a very subtle aura inside.

Food mainly specialises in various kinds of steaks of meat(mainly chicken,lamb,pork) served with Veggies and eggs as maybe the case on the side.
It's ought to be a delight for meat lovers.

We ordered a few of their main common favourites.

I got to tell you, their Bacon wrapped prawns is another divine level of food. Complete melt in the mouth,served with a honey sauce.
The Tenderloin Steak however,was good,but the meat felt tough to be cut properly. It wasn't as tender as I expected. The sides were fine.

We also had chicken sausage fries with was served with regular Mayo. Okayish for the price.

The bill came on around late 800's, for these.

Good enough right,must give it a go!
Enjoy!

Located near karunamoyee, opposite to Central park; this restaurant has a really catchy decor and ambience. The service was good and the staff were very polite.
Coming​ to the food, we ordered bacon wrapped prawn, irish broth, ham steak, pork chop, smoked chicken risotto and natural live ice cream for dessert.
They serve really good meat with a great texture and juicy inside. The ham steak is worth mentioning. It was a treat to the mouth.
The live icecream we ordered was kiwi flavoured and it was really refreshing.
This place is worth visiting again!

Tried chicken Tetrazzini, chicken steak in black pepper sauce chicken Roseberry with mashed potatoes, Californian fish steak in cheese sauce with white cream, chicken steak sizzler in black bean sauce.

Pocket friendly. Far less expensive compared to Mocambo although we have experienced similar quality but larger quantity. Decscent ambience. Service is excellent.

Hope they are capable of maintaining similar experience in future as well.

The Steak Factory has a reputation strong enough to warrant a visit as soon as a franchise opens up close to home. Sadly, the franchise did not really compare to the outlet I loved in Southern Avenue.

We ordered traditional Chicken Tetrazzini and Chicken Sizzler. The sizzler was rather good, but the Tetrazzini was too ordinary to be a Steak Factory preparation. The portion size was also rather poor.

We also ordered Apple Pie with Ice Cream for dessert, and this was the big disappointment. The outer pastry was underbaked, the apple filling too sweet and was in general only just eatable.

The decor is great, and the staff are awesome too. Maybe more concentration on the food is warranted?

We ordered bacon wrapped prawns, mixed grilled sizzler, and minced mutton steak.. the bacon wrapped prawns were really good, especially with  honey mustard barbecue sauce.. the mixed grill sizzler was a major downer.. they promised us mutton, prawns chicken and chicken sausages where they were only large shrimp sized 4pcs of prawns and chicken and sausages.. there was no mutton whatsoever.. the sauce seemed more like a pasta sauce and the item wasn't grilled at all; more kind of stir fried.. for an item priced at 390 INR this is not at all value for money nor does it satiate the tastebuds.. the minced mutton steak was worst of the lot! It was raw and the mutton patty was- well full of binders (read bread etc).. the Ac was kinda cool (not pleasantly cold ) for a packed house on a Sunday afternoon.. and the service was really bad, they made us wait for 20 mins for the bill! Not stocked up- they did not even have any crab, squid or octopus (which is okay given the season) but overall a very average experience for foodies who like to cook coz the dishes arnt really up to the mark.. the prawn wrapped bacons were the only reason why I would not rate this place as bad/poor. Steak house- am done and dusted with you!

I went there yesterday thinking that "mm steak factory! awesome, will finally get some steaks to eat".  We ordered 1 chicken steak and 1 mixed grill and 1 orange flaked mocktail. Truely saying.. it's worst. I can cook better steak than them. After eating one bite, nothing happened!!! I kinda thought that the steak in olypub is way way better than this one and one thing I didn't understand. There was way too much sauce in it. 

Now the funny part is, both the dishes tastes same. 

I'm never going again. Though the ambiance is very good, but the food!! OMG!! Rs.370 for that nasty food, Sorry boss!! It's a no go.

Visited the steak factory with my boyfriend. Nicely decorated with lights and painted walls. 

We ordered:
For starters- Chicken Wings, Bacon wrapped prawns.
Bacon wrapped prawns were the most delicious of all. It was the best dish of the day. A must try for everyone!


For main course: California fish fillet and Chicken steak. Chicken steak was not tasty at all, though the French fries were good. On the other hand the fish fillet nailed it with its flavours. 

For dessert: Kiwi ice cream rolls and apple pie with vanilla icecream. Both of them were good. 
 
Over all, not all dishes are good. They need to work on the taste of the dishes as a whole.

Not up to the mark.Foods are not continental as they claim. Quantity of servings are below par. Eventually there were nothing which could satisfy a reasonable taste.

Dont eat here unless you want to drill a big hole in your pocket eating rubbish

You might only choose to eat here when you have a fortune to splurge or you have a mouse's appetite. Portions of chicken steak and stroganoff served is just about half of other renowned continental restaurants in the city. After sending enough (till my budget was out) I had to walk to the roadside tea stall for a could of egg-toasts to eventually feel I have ate something. 

About the taste, the stroganoff was immensely dry with the shredded pieces cooked after a week's refrigeration. The chicken steaks had a mince-packed papad like pieces (and not the traditional shapes of steaks) which mostly tasted like mixed ham patty. We also ordered reshi kabab. Again they were super dry, the meat was hard enough to be torn by human teeth.

Eventually, the bill. Here were were charged 600+ more than what we had eaten adding an un-ordered item. Luckily we read and scrutinized and had to claim the error and was subtracted but they did not subtract the taxed item.

Overall, an un-recommended eat-out joint. Unfortunately you cant eat the gaudy-plasticy interiors they have dished out.

It's a good place to enjoy continental cuisine type lunch. We had ordered Chicken Stroganoff, Chicken Sizzlers , Mixed Sizzlers & Chicken Steak . Fir desserts we had the pleasure of snacking on the icecream Rolls . It's a great concept by this restaurant.
But I felt that the some if the dishes we're a bit off.
Overall a descent place.

Visited The Steak Factory today for dinner with family. The interior decor was very nice. The outer appearance of the restaurant is also catchy and looked quite appealing to the eyes. For starters, we had Cheese Garlic Bread, which was good. Chicken wings, which were above average..could have been better. We also had Chicken tikka kebabs. They were so good that we ordered for another plate of it. To go with that, I had a Virgin Mojito which was very nicely made.Then for the mains we had chicken steak. The steak came with a large portion of chicken along with french fries, poached egg and veggies. And it was the best of all the items. For desserts the others had opted for vanilla and chocolate ice creams while I opted for a chocolate and oreo ice cream. It was made infront of me and they even allowed me to shoot a video of the entire process of making. I wish zomato could allow me to post a video of that! Overall, a nice restaurant filled with mostly GenX people. Fits the pocket as well.

Went for lunch with my bestie!

We ordered-
Cream of Chicken Soup, Chicken Sizzler, Chicken Tikka Pizza, Chicken Fingers Mozzarella Sticks, Factory Special Cheese Steak, Chicken Steak, Fish Carnival and Virgin Mojito..

*TASTE- Everything was very very delicious except the pizza!
The base was very chewy! People who have eaten in pizza hut n all shouldn't order pizzas here!
The steaks we ordered were very soft n juicy and served with french fries!
Quantity served in each plate (for example the fish or sizzler) we ordered is a bit less according to me.
Each plate for each person should be ordered!

*FAST SERVICE AND VERY GOOD HOSPITALITY!
*AMBIENCE- Super cool!

A must visit! @

We visited the place in a weekday lunch time. Still the place was almost full. We got a nice table by the windowside. The staff out there were very courteous and soft spoken. 
 The decor was modern abit pub like. Lots of wall writings and food photos on the walls. 
 Coming to food. For starters we ordered bacon wrapped prawns which were awesome. The sauce was tangy and was accompanied by another sweet one by which the combination became heavenly. In main course we took one pork chop and one tenderloin steak. Both were good. Specially the pork chop though there was lot of fat as in porkribs. For drinks we took one shirley temple which was so so and one lemon ice tea which was horrible. It was very pungent like strong black tea made to freeze. For dessert they suggested their special ice creme rolls which we opted for oreo flavour. It was like home made ice creme and was pretty good.
  Overall a good experience. A good place to hang out with friends and family..

We had to stand outside for a while as there was no vacant tables.
The restaurant is not very spacious.
Prices are reasonable.
There's a live counter for ice cream rolls.
Tried their mango ice cream rolls which was okay types. Chicken steak was good enough. Ceaser salad was not bad. Chicken cream soup was yummy.

Visited the eatery with high hopes and to start the Bengali new year with a treat to the taste buds. But Disappointed. And that is an understatement. Have been to the same eatery at Southern Avenue at least 4-5 times and that actually prompted me to visit their newly opened Salt Lake franchise. The ambience is new though very suffocating - thanks to less than optimum number of air conditioners in this scorching heat. We ordered for Garlic Bread which was rather fine. This was followed by minced mutton steak where the French fries were stale and not fresh. The steak was not at all to their reputation. Next comes tenderloin stake which was equally pathetic. The icing on the cake (read the worse of all) was Mozzarella Cheese stick which was tasteless, salt less and with a very thick and just not edible. Whereas the same dishes are so much sought after at their Southern Avenue outlet. God knows how such a drastic transformation. But surely they need to improve their performance. I am fond of this eatery and do not want them to be a let down. Team Steak Factory please pull up your socks and perform well.

When you think of yummy food, friendly staff, cool ambience and sweetest desserts in town, think of Steak Factory, which is now in Salt Lake. Gone are the days when we, residents of salt lake had to drive for miles to have a good meal. With Steak Factory now opening its doors in salt lake, your meat cravings can be satisfied in a jiffy.
Located right opposite the central park area in Salt Lake, there lies a lot of restaurants that will try to entice you in, but give in to steak factory, hands down. The reason why I'll vouch for this is because the rest of the restaurants may also be offering some great food but only the variety available here at Steak Factory, is one of a kind. 
I was lucky enough​ to be seated quickly on a busy Poila Baishak Saturday for a lunch for three. They had laid out a special menu for the day, which presented their special dishes. We went for a Bacon Wrapped Prawn and Spicy Mutton Meat Balls for starters. While you wait for your order you will be amazed of you look around the decor, they have very interesting graphic novel paintings done all over their wall, and oh don't miss the ceiling art.
The bacon wrapped prawns were amazing to taste, the combination of bacon and prawn is amazing and the sweet after taste of the coated sauce will blow your mind. I have to give a special mention to the spicy mutton meat balls, it's nothing like I have ever had before. For someone like me who enjoys spicy food to the fullest, this dish was a dream. The minced mutton meat ball was reasonably large, no compromises were made on its size the best part was the spicy sauce it was coated with, it was hot and spicy with a tinge of Indianess, if I may add. I could have that everyday, all day.
Next up was time for the main course, we had ordered a portion of Pork Chops, Minced Mutton Steak and a Mutton Sizzler each. The pork chops tasted lovely and I'd give that my vote of confidence first. The minced mutton steak was great too, the large serving is a lot to take for a small eater like me but the great taste will help you finish it faster. The mutton sizzler ​tasted fine as well. All of these came with fries and veggies.
I was surprised to see such fast service from the staff on a very busy day. Thumbs up for the swift service with a warm smile. And to have a happy ending we finished our meal with the very popular live ice cream which were available in exotic flavors like mango, kiwi and banana. We went for the fruit of the season-mango. I won't even comment on how it was, I'll only say that one serving came with 4 big rolls of ice cream and we ordered for 2 portions in total, so you have an idea. 
To end my very long review I'd say go there for the decor, the steaks and the warm smiles. And pocket pinch is not a pinch at all.

Their service is exceptional and they have a menu to satiate any carnivore. I was also amazed by how well the meat was cooked. I ate a 500g pork chop and the meat detached from the bones with gentle swipes of the knife. They need to work on the little things. The lemon ice tea was not chilled and it had barely any ice. The mashed potato served on side of the meat was lumpy. At the end of the day they do live up to their name by serving amazing meat. Would definitely go back.

Nice place to have quality steaks and sizzlers! Need improvement on other items though.

Good ambience, fast service. We ordered spicy chili pork as starter. It was not spicy at all but all the pieces were meat and no fat portion. We ordered mixed bbq sizzler, ham steak and minced mutton steak for main course. Each item was enough for one person. Steaks and sizzler came with french fry and boiled green veggies and i really liked the sauce that came with steaks. Steaks were pure meat and tasty. In desert we ordered brownie and caramel custard. Brownie was okay but the caramel custard was a waste. Overall this place serves quality steaks and sizzlers but need improvement on other dishes.

You will love this new place serving quality steaks at pocket friendly budget. The décor was really impressive and the best part was that it's a spacious restaurant. Do go for chicken cordonbleu. It was my personal favourite. Just opposite the central park in Salt Lake it's close to Karunamoyee crossing. I was not fascinated by the service though coz we got wrong billing amounts and the second order arrived quite late. All together it was a pleasant experience. Would love to come back again some weekend.

Dishes:

Fish and Chips-Yummy
Blue Lagoon-Very refreshing 
Beef Surf and Turf Steak-Simply Wow!! Best steak I ever head! Cooked to perfect Medium Rare. But the prawns were smelly.
Lamb Lasagna-Lip Smacking!
Chelow Kebab-Delicious mutton kebab is worth mentioning.

We had had a good time at the southern Avenue branch of the Steak factory and so when it opened up in Salt Lake we were very excited. It is situated near the karunamoye bus stop and it is just opposite to the central park of salt lake and therefore quite easy to locate.We went in and started with drinks .We took a blue lagoon and a virgin Pina Colada. The presentation of the Blue Lagoon in inverted bulb was quite interesting and unique. Steak factory is known for its take preparations we wanted spicy Chili pork and bbq pork ribs. However we were informed that most of the pork dishes that way good way not available at that time. So we had no other options but to order chicken. The waiter suggested factory mixed grilled sizzler and chicken steak. The food arrived in about 15 minutes. The next sizzler had prawns and various other means and it was quite good. The steak was nicely done also. However when we ordered for dessert we will inform that that was unavailable as well and only the chocolate brownie with ice cream was available at that time, so we order that as we had no other option. The brownie was soft and nicely done and overall was a good dish. In spite of the crowd there was no rush of getting up and the waiters will helpful enough. The decor was decent. The menu though being nice as most of the items were unavailable, the place needs some improvement.

Located near Central park in salt lake sector 3,this place has a cute decor with colourful walls and cozy seating with nice music in the background(mainly rock)..the staff are prompt and helpful...but the area which they need to improve upon is the food,which is the most important thing of all..we ordered crispy chilli chicken,chicken steak and surf and turf steak along with ice lemon tea,shirley temple coolers and chocolate Monte Carlo for dessert...the crispy chilli chicken was not crispy at all,tasting average...the chicken steak had some herb which was not going well with the rest of the dish...the surf and turf steak was decent and tasty which is basically a beef steak served with 3 prawns...the portions were adequate for 1 person...coming to the coolers,they somehow completely messed up the ice lemon tea,as surprising as it may sound...the chocolate Monte Carlo was pretty good...they need to improve their food quality,coz then this place would definitely be the next big thing...

Located in the by-lanes of the FE block a short walking distance away from Karunamoyee Bus Stand, a humble exterior hides the wonders inside. The décor is amazing (with bulbs on the inside kept quite beautifully), especially the wall designs with artwork and photo frames (which did not seem to cover a common theme, but liked the chaotic nature of it). And the playlist (which was primarily PoTF when we were there) was truly music to our ears. Though I’m not sure keeping hungry people occupied with a cooking show on TV was such a good idea 😉

Coming to the food itself, we ordered two starters (Chicken Fajita and Chicken Nuggets) and three main courses (one for each of us). The Chicken Nuggets were okay. And while I didn’t find the Chicken Fajita visually that appealing, the taste was awesome with the tender chicken melting in my mouth. For the main course, I had the Barbecued Pork Ribs. While it was well seasoned and tasty, the quality was a little too less to actually fill your stomach so I went into the sea food side of the menu. I also tasted a bit from my friend’s plate, and found the chicken steak leaving a lot to be desired with a bland taste while the chicken sizzler was quite tasty and looked filling. Coming to my own plate, the bacon wrapped prawns were beautifully cooked and I polished them off in seconds. For desert, we had apple pie with vanilla ice cream, and while not generally a fan of the dish – can say the little I had was encouraging enough for me to try again in the future. The servers were polite, courteous and most importantly honest. The recommended food came before time and they were very open about the more time consuming ones. The prices while a little on the high side were understandable and we left feeling full and contented, and deciding that this was deserving of a repeat visit soon.

Till now pathetic. We ordered Caesar Salad with grilled chicken and then Factory Mixed Sizzler. Salad was pathetic and I had to ask for extra mayo to make it edible. Sizzler was initially served cold and it was not sizzling. On complain, they had to finally change it! The food taste vis-a-vis what they charge is not at par! So think twice before visiting here....

So our first visit here. I wasn't amazed by the food but the whole vibe and interior of the place is quite nice! I think we went in on a busy night so the place was small. The sitting I didn't quite like because it is quite close togther. The menu looked great and although I'm veg I came to a steak place (I hope you see the humor in there that I do). So I had the macaroni and cheese and the garlic bread and I can honestly say I have had better in less fancy places than here. There was no cheese to begin with on either dish and it was so bland that I had to add oregano and chilli flakes to it (seriously to macaroni! I was that desperate for it to taste like something). Neal had the chicken steak which looked nicely done and he said it tasted nice too, although he prefered more sauce on his steak. All in all it was an average meal atleast for me. But pocket-wise, kudos! Because after that mac and cheese and a hole in my boyfriends pocket, it would be too much for one evening. 

I think I could go back and try the steak and then decide how I like their food. So till then, here's hoping!

Decent ambience with good food!

Went there with a friend on a Sunday evening. The place was well lit and not too crowded (although with time, there were a decent number of people stepping in). We ordered bacon wrapped prawns, pork ribs (steak), virgin mohito and the cookies and crème ice cream rolls. The prawns were to die for, succulent and juicy served with a maple/ plum syrup which went as a perfect accompaniment. The pork ribs were good, but fell a bit flat after the prawns. Rest of the food was good. Service is good as well. Overall, a good value for money..will definitely come back to try out the rest of the stuff on their menu.

Recently visited this joint. Went to their southern avenue one but it didn't impress me much. But, here the scenario is on the brighter side. Ambience is cooler, more space and better sitting arrangements. Located at the service road on fe block along series of restaurants. Coming to the food, we ordered bacon wrapped prawns and gandhoraj chicken as starter. The latter turned out to be better. Chicken cordon bleu had a great taste with all ingredients merged beautifully. Chicken steak though seemed a little bland. For dessert, the choco brownie had a melting chocolate filling but the ice cream wasn't cool enough which it shud have been. Loved the place though.

Hmm this place could be so much better with a little more attention to the cooking. We were a group of 6 pigging out after work. I had the pulled pork burger ,delicious but the pork was not pulled rather diced and definitely not slow cooked. Mac and cheese was a mess. The pork chops were great and  very good quantity. The desserts are the game changer with freshly rolled out ice cream with kiwi and strawberry . A lot of thought has gone into the decor and the menu. Just the kitchen needs to be guided better.

We booked a Table for Lunch today. Booking was confirmed. We reached there at 1:30pm. Half of the restaurant was closed. We were asked to sit in the breakfast area and were provided the breakfast menu at 1.30 pm. On asking about the lunch menu we were told that we need to wait till 4pm. So our question is why was the booking confirmed by the restaurant when they were aware that they were not going to serve lunch today. Very poor customer service from their end.

I was here with my friends a week ago and we absolutely loved the ambience. We have been craving for steaks and this is the best destination in Calcutta. The ambience was so fun and good. I adored the classic posters on the walls, especially being a die hard F.R.I.E.N.D.S fan I was literally surprised to find "Joey doesn't share food" on the washroom walls. Coming to the food it was great! We had ordered bacon wrapped prawn which was the best among all, Cheese and chicken steak which was again beautiful and ham and bacon steak which was good since I am not a ham fan as such. The service was good and the price of the dishes included in the menu card has taxes included. It was not a big pocket pinch at all. Would definitely come here again!

I came to this place few months back to try out continentals and my experience was very bad. Service was very poor. Few days back I have been hearing that people going to this place very often. So I revisited this place and my experience was just the opposite.
I ordered chicken steak ,tendorloin steak and both the dishes were mouthwatering.
Service was very prompt and cordial.
We also had oreo based ice cream rolls which was also too good.
Overall a very good place to dine out including their ambience.
Again I went there in April few days back with my family on poila boisakh and ordered the following:

√Grilled bhetki sizzler
√Fresh lime soda
√Chelow Kabab
√Caesar Salad with grilled chicken
√Chicken wings
√Raspberry cheese cake
√Brownie with ice cream
√Oreo based ice cream rolls

Grilled bhetki sizzler was the best of the lot followed by the salad while the chelow kebab was really disappointing. The Chelow Kebab did not have much vegetables and butter and the quantity of rice was really less. The mutton seekh kebab in the dish was really hard to chew. They should really improve this particular dish.
All the dessert items were equally outstanding specially the ice cream rolls.

This new outlet in Salt lake is really great. Everything here, be it the food, service, ambience is great. The food is really value for money. We had a a Chicken steak, Spaghettu With meatballs, Virgin Mojito which were all great. But payment option through card was not yet available, so you should carry cash before visiting here. :)

We booked a Table for Lunch today. Booking was confirmed. We reached there at 1:30pm. Half of the restaurant was closed. We were asked to sit in the breakfast area and were provided the breakfast menu at 1.30 pm. On asking about the lunch menu we were told that we need to wait till 4pm. So our question is why was the booking confirmed by the restaurant when they were aware that they were not going to serve lunch today. Very poor customer service from their end.

I was here with my friends a week ago and we absolutely loved the ambience. We have been craving for steaks and this is the best destination in Calcutta. The ambience was so fun and good. I adored the classic posters on the walls, especially being a die hard F.R.I.E.N.D.S fan I was literally surprised to find "Joey doesn't share food" on the washroom walls. Coming to the food it was great! We had ordered bacon wrapped prawn which was the best among all, Cheese and chicken steak which was again beautiful and ham and bacon steak which was good since I am not a ham fan as such. The service was good and the price of the dishes included in the menu card has taxes included. It was not a big pocket pinch at all. Would definitely come here again!

I ordered chicken steak ,tendorloin steak and both the dishes were mouthwatering.
Service was very prompt and cordial.
We also had oreo based ice cream rolls which was also too good.

Visited the outlet on 24/03/2017 evening. The interior is classic, simple, cosy. Waiters are helpful and polite. Tasted stuffed chicken legs and tenderloin steak. Both of them were really well made, specially the steak was juicy, tender and flavourful. The only thing which troubled me is their menu card. It wasn't organised course wise, some items rate was modified after using a Whitener and way different from the rates of the zomato updated menu, which is misleading. Please work on this.

Great Place. Great Ambience .... Lip smacking food. The place is nicely decorated, lots of pictures hanging around the wall. The staff are very humble. I went with one of my friend. We ordered two dishes. Grilled Chicken, Chicken Stroganoff Pasta. Both the dishes were great. 
Looking forward to visit once again, and try some of their other dishes.

I've already been to this place three times since it opened up in Salt Lake, but never reviewed it. 
Considering I have been such a huge food buff, I found Steak Factory as a place Salt Lake desperately required, in terms of the variety available.
So let me get down straight to the remarks of each sector of the restaurant:

1. Ambiance - 4/5
2. Food - 5/5
3. Service & Customer Management - 2/5

The last one was really a huge disappointment as the waiters were very confused and non- responsive whenever we asked for things such as water , refilling of tissues and cutlery or even clearance of the soiled items. This was the state when the place was at 40% occupancy, hence it should be noted that they should bring up their service standards.
Food is the real reason why my overall ratings for this place is quite high as the dishes ordered were truly outstanding. Be it the starters such as Cajun fish fry or Bacon wrapped Prawns, go the main course of Chicken Tetrazzini, Stroganoff, Spaghetti Carbonara or Tenderloin steak... All of them were a real delight to eat. Availability of good pork and beef dishes is quite rare in the city, and the steak factory have  capitalised on this situation to gain more interest from the meat lovers. A big salute to the chef's for making the food awesome nd to give the guests a wow factor to cherish.

We had been there for breakfast.Though the opening time was mentioned as 7am at 9am someone was sweeping the floor.
Good:
1.A good amount of bacon and sausage was served.
2. Pancakes were yummy

Bad:
1.They themselves decided to make one biiig butter pancake instead of three.When we asked they say it is "3 butter" pancake and not 3 "butter pancake".On further enquiry we hear 3 kind of butter as in butter Mozarella and again cheese is used.this tells the staff have no idea about what is being served.
2.only one cook inside and rest all work to be managed by one person.
3.slow service and not a single dish was served at a time completely
4.In such a small place open kitchen concept is not great.Coffee machine gave headache to us.
5.Hot chocolate was watery

A beautiful cozy outlet seemed right out from a nice romantic Hollywood flick is what comes to mind when one enters this eye soothing outlet. Kicked off with bacon wrapped shrimps with honey mustard sauce. The bacon was soft as silk and the prawns dipped in the honey mustard sauce felt perfect. Amazing feeling on the palette. The virgin coloda was super refreshing on a nice Sunday evening. Moving over to the steaks - first of tenderloin steak, had specially asked for 'well done' repeated it twice to the server, end result medium rare on the plate with the red juice mixing with the portion of mashed potatoes. The veggies were not blanched properly. The portion size of the black pepper sauce was not enough. You would expect the classic steak sauce bottle on the table but that too was missing. However the portion size of the steak was good and it was Juicy. Moving to the chicken steak boneless, the marinating was nice and you could taste the mix in each bite but again the veggies was not blanched well. Service was bang on. Courteous, periodic checks on our table was appreciable. Overall experience was us smiling on our way out. Salt Lake surely needed such a place.

Wanna go to a restaurant with a simple theme and the great food? - then you have to come to the Steak Factory.
I recently paid a visit to their Salt Lake outlet and was satisfied with the experience.
For food, we ordered a Shrimp Cocktail which was too pretty to eat.
Bacon wrapped prawn,if you're a bacon lover then you've to go for this one and also it's my personal favourite.
A Ham steak and a Mixed Grilled Sizzlers. The sizzlers was burned a bit but that definitely didn't ruin the taste.
A perfect pocket friendly place to hang out with your friends.

Ordered in grilled chicken.It came with bones and butter soaked veggies, with a lot of creamy gravy. Overpriced for a mess like that. Suggesting you guys to never go for particularly the grilled chicken.

Also glad that finally a restaurant in the neighborhood serves Chelo Kebab, although the quantity is a little less as compared to other restaurants but still taste wise perfect.

The décor was quaint and charming.
In terms of dishes, the Bacon Wrapped Prawns were really good. Would recommend. 
Had also tried the Bacon Wrapped Steak with Tenderloin (the meat wasn't too soft), and the Factory Mixed Grill. They were quite decent overall.
The mocktails, Jungle Juice and Shirley Temple, were pretty average, but refreshing.
The Raspberry Cheesecake is worth a shot.

Ordered chicken wings which was obviously not fresh . They changed the dish but again the quality of the wings were same, hard and stale.

Then came the sizzlers, it was okayish but too bland, seems the marination and seasoning was not upto the mark. The grilled veggies didn't even have salt. Anyways the quality of chicken, prawn and mutton was ok (not stale like wings) but the sausage was very soft and gooey. Things were going fine but we got a hair in the sizzler, it was stuck on a piece of  nicely roasted chicken, which killed our appetite and we called it a day.  I understand its one of a case, but given the brand name and the price they should take care of such things.We showed it to the waiter and asked for the bill. He came back after 5mi@ns with a complimentary portion of caramel custard, the only saving grace of the meal! They also didn't charge for the chicken wings. 

All good on customer service front, only improvement required is on the quality of food!

I kept delaying my visit to The Steak and Grill because it used to be so far. So finally when it opened its doors in Salt Lake I ran out of excuses.
We ordered the bacon wrapped prawn, chicken steak, chelow kabab and, because both the Tiramisu and the Chocolate Soufflé were unavailable (we weren't even late or anything), a chocolate monte carlo.
The bacon wrapped prawn lived upto my expectations. It was sweet and sour and tender and pretty awesome. The steak was pretty well done, as was the chelow kebab. The monte carlo was okay I guess.
The service was kinda slow though.

Overall, pretty okay I guess.

Edit: The factory mixed grill sizzler is the BOMB! +0.5 to The Steak and Grill!

This place is located on the service road parallel to Fourth Avenue.Look for FE block park as a Landmark.It's fairly easy to Spot.

Salt lake has long lacked restaurants that serve authentic Continental cuisine.This Steak factory is a part of the change that at has come about in recent years in that scene.

The place is divided into two sections.A restaurant and a cafe.This is a sectional review of the restaurant.

Ambience- Has a tasteful new age decor with frames of vintage rock.It is well lit and has a comfortable seating area. Washroom is clean and well maintained.

Food- I ordered chicken a la kiev for myself, Barbecue pork ribs for my husband and a chicken sizzler to share.The Chicken of a la kiev was cooked to perfection with the right amount of butter, and has the right combination of crunch.The mashed potato was seasoned well and the mild rosemary sprinkle in the Steamed veggies nicely elevated the dish.My husband enjoyed the pork thoroughly.It was coming nicely off the bones and was flavourful.Lastly we ordered a chicken sizzler which was well cooked,with fresh ingredients.The portion size was good and it filled us up well.

Service-The waiters were polite and courteous.All our food was served within 15 mins of ordering.Overall had a nice experience.

We have been to the southern avenue branch of the same chain before.And they have never failed us in taste or service.Looking forward to try the other dishes on the menu.

A continental restaurant in Salt Lake was long overdue so we were delighted when Steak Factory opened one of their branches here . Conveniently located near the Central Park the place is very easy to find . Seating & decor is comfortable though the place is not a big one . Coming to the food we had the following : 
Cheese garlic bread : Nicely prepared & served .
Chicken Steak : The dish left us a bit disappointed as we felt that synergy of chicken with sauce was missing . Better cooking is required to bring out the real flavour of the dish .
Chicken A La Kiev : The decoration of the dish was splendid . Taste wise was good too . 
Factory mixed grilled sizzler : This was the best of the lot . With associated boiled vegetables & french fries is tasted heavenly .
Service is on the slower side . We had to wait for a long time for Chicken A La Kiev to be delivered . The decoration of most  of the items look similar , some variations may be introduced to make them more pleasing to the eye & taste buds. One big disappointment was the constant movement of their staff with bags probably filled with kitchen materials . Such movement should ideally be completed before opening or they should be provided a different route altogether.
Overall good place but both service & food need improvement .

The chicken wings were quite good although they had the traditional Barbecue sauce along with added sweetener. Making the whole dish taste unnecessarily sweet. The sizzler on the other hand was a complete waste of money. Had too much sauce. The mutton pieces were not well seasoned. The chicken sausages were soft and gooey in the middle. The French fries were an upside. Based on the food I ordered , the place is pretty average.

This is in salt lake next to balle balle dhaba. Best steaks in Kolkata. Try out barbeque pork ribs and lamb lasagna. Ambience is also good. We ordered chicken steak, chicken sizzler, grill chicken, lamb lasagna and pork ribs. All were good. Delivery is also good. But book a table first... It takes some time to get seats.

We ordered Crispy Fried Calamari for starters, Spaghetti with meatballs, Chicken Steak, Factory Mixed Grilled Sizzler for main course and Cream and Chocolate Ice cream rolls for dessert. Crispy Fried Calamari tasted awesome. It was very well fried and the taste was wonderful. Coming to the main course, the Chicken Steak was outstanding. I personally found the Factory Mixed Grilled Sizzler average. It was cooked with a lot of sauce and the Gravy was not that tasty. Spaghetti with meatballs was also nice. And the live ice cream counter is the eye catcher there! Cream and Chocolate Ice Cream rolls tasted good as well.
The staffs were really cordial and the ambience of the place is also good. Overall it was a good experience and I am definitely looking forward to visit there again! :)

The Steak Factory is a good addition to the food scene in all the sectors of Salt Lake. Enjoyed their burger served on plastic skillets and their fish and chips. The fries here are really good! If u visit here you have to try their live ice creams that come in 5 main flavors (vanilla, banana, kiwi, strawberry, cookies and cream) and can be mixed :). They also have a breakfast cafe which serves from 7-11 am. So if you're looking for a meaty bite or a hearty breakfast and some tailor made ice cream then go to TSF.

I was really looking forward to trying this restaurant as soon as it opened in Salt Lake.This place is near Central Park,along the stretch were many restaurants are situated side by side.Ordered for a tenderloin steak and a factory special pork cheese steak via Swiggy.The time taken by the restaurant to prepare the order was really long I would say but maybe since I ordered just half an hour after opening may be the delay was because of the timing.Coming to the food,both the items arrived very well packaged will all the accompanying sides in small foil packets.The tenderloin was a pure slice of thick meat with no fat at all.For me it was a bit heavily seasoned but went well with the mashed potatoes which was again underseasoned.The pork steak was a good ration of meat and fat,though the rind was completely black due to overbaking.The sauce sereved on the pork was tomato rosemary based while the tenderloin came with a brown mushroom sauce, both were delicious.They use hand made french fries and not the frozen ones which is another plus point.I don't know why they did not give me the grilled onions which I find in most of the photos of the item.I will be trying other items soon from this place.

New branch in Salt Lake and indeed they have justified "Steak". We have been to the place many a times and tried almost all kinds of steak and I specially loved all of them. My recommendation would still be "Spaghetti with meat balls", as it is tasty and pocket friendly too.

To tell in short loved everything!! From the decor to the food to the person in charge to the service. We ordered mixed grill sizzler and it was perfect. If I have to be critical then I would say the chicken pieces were a bit chewy and stiff to my liking. Next up is the ham steak. I had it for dinner last night and I can still feel it melting in my mouth. The French fries accompanying both the dishes were made to perfection. I would love to visit again coz there are many dishes I would love to try out there...Right now on my wishlist is bacon wrapped prawn.

At last a great place for continental food at Salt Lake!!! Honestly this is one of the best eatery I have visited in recent times. Before anything else I would like to write about the quality and taste of the food here. In one word... It's delicious! The bacon wrapped prawn is a must try. The succulent bacon and the prawn within just melts in your mouth and the taste lingers. Pot roasted mutton is something I tried for the first time and the delectable dish is a reason for me to visit The Steak Factory again. The mutton chunks were juicy and cooked perfectly to blend on to your taste buds and make sure you crave for more. The herb rice complements the mutton perfectly to make it a wholesome choice of food. The chicken steak... Aah my mouth is watering at the very thought of it. Loved this dish and all I can say is I kind of hogged. All the three dishes we tried were simply super.
The restaurant has a very Irish feel to it and I simply Loved the simple yet elegant decor. The lawn with the board in it is so picture perfect. The service was excellent and the staff was very prompt and efficient throughout. The pricing is quite good as of now as They have not yet included taxes. Overall it's been a great experience visiting and eating yummy food at the steak factory. A must try for people who love continental food.

Disgusting food! Bad quality. They charge 320/- for a smoked chicken and mushroom risotto. And they give you some sweet bolied rice as you can see in the picture. And I have specially taken the picture of the mushroom which seemed thinner than a piece of paper. Couldn't find any chicken as well.
They are just ruining the reputation of steak factory!

I was jumping in joy to see a steak place opening up in in salt lake finally , and that too a branch of The steak factory , a brand i love for grills and Continental. The decor is the best of all their outlets , very spacious with separate cafe and restaurant sections. But the food was way below the level we expect from the steak factory.
The Cream of chicken soup was done amateurish , heavy , and wasn't much enjoyable with more cornflour than cream .
The Fish carnival was a dish i had at lake place , grilled fish on a bed of spaghetti which i liked , here it was a baked fish dish , again the white sauce wasn't prepared well.
CHICKEN SANGRIA came after a long lag , topped with red wine sauce which we loved but the portions of meat was meagre, only two small chicken pieces for a dsh priced above 320 is not justified.

The cheesecake with raspberry compote was okayish , but no where close to what a cheesecake tastes like , there was no distinct flavour of cream cheese but some berry flavoured hung curd place over a thick layer of crushed cookie base . Couldn't impress us at all.
The service was slow towards the end as well. Took almost half an hour for the dessert to serve , even after repeatedly knocking them.
There is a lot to improve , specially the cooking ,which doesn't reach upto the steak factory standards.

Easy to locate, on the way to Karunamoyee bus stand, situated on main road. Nice decor and cozy ambience, polite and friendly behaviour will attract people. Coming to the food, tried factory fish steak which is quite good, with some desert and coolers. Steak and desert both are tasty and this place is recommended to visit ! Price is ok compared to the quality and quantity. Although quality is good, food is tasty, but a little more quantity people can expect. For 6 people the total bill was around Rs 3700.

So, visited this place randomly without any expectation, but it turned out to be not so bad experience. The ambience is pretty much like a goan food joint, my partner pointed out its set in like a pondicherry restaurant.Now,about the food, tried the bacon wrapped prawns, which was pretty good which was a starter, following on was the main course, bar b que glazed pork chops, which was over done, n not at all what i expected, because the starter was really good, n then came the dessert section which didn't really have anything on the menu, n every dessert was out of stock, except the regular brownie. Little disappointing, after the mind blowing start, hope they improve the dishes little!

Ordered via Swiggy today...  

The chicken wings were juicy and succulent.  Sweet sauce with hints of chili .  They didn't have any batter on them and were skin on.  

I ordered mutton meatballs they were absolutely  delicious .  Soft,  juicy,  and the sauce was yummy too.  Tangy and very robust .  

Will order more stuff soon.  

Cheers!

When I tried this place for the first time I gave them 4.5 stars. It was a new place then and food and prices were good. Since then I have been to this place several times but everytime I visited, I got disappointed by different things. Currently, In short food prices are high now. Quantity of the food became less(small steaks and shitty burgers). Food quality is not like before. I can't visit anymore.

Since I live in salt lake, it was difficult for me to visit their outlets in South Calcutta. But since they opened their outlet at Salt Lake Sector 3, I was planning for a visit to this outlet, and finally today I paid a visit to The Steak Factory with my wife for dinner. 

First of all, I must point out that in spite of the "not so happening" location, they are successful in creating a wonderful ambiance with 60's & 70's classic rock music & decorations. We have ordered Fish n Chips, Stuffed Chicken Tandoori legs with butter rice, Chicken Parmigiana & a mocktail. I must say, taste wise all the items met my expectation. The service of the waiters were very prompt and helpful. I must point out one incident that my wife found out a small piece of hair in one of the piece of fish in the fish n chips. When we pointed it out to one of the waiter, he was polite enough to apologize and replace the dish with a fresh one. This was very courteous from them and should be followed by every good restaurants. 

Overall I am very satisfied and looking forward to visit again to try out their other dishes. Also they are not yet charging vat and service taxes which is a big bonus now a days. keep up the quality of food and service. Cheers!!

Hv been yearning to go this food joint since it had a sole outlet on Southern Avenue,although i couldn't make it to that outlet dropped in the sector 3 outlet(newly opened) for dinner. The restaurant is well done and the ambience is  pretty nice.Coming to the food & service both deserves a thumbs up. We had ordered for the Chicken tikka pizza, Fish carnival & Chicken steak. The Fish carnival & chicken steak was truly appetising & highly recommended. The pizza was ok ok kind. The service was very fast & the staffs were courteous.They are not charging any tax as of now,that makes the pricing very reasonable.

After trying for months to visit the other outlets, finally it opened in salt lake, and I believe I was not too late this time. Awesome ambience with super delicious menu. Had beef steak, chicken steak, onion rings, cheese cake, hot chocolate brownie and all of them were good. I personally though beef steak could have been a bit softer & prices could be a bit lower.

The food is decent. Ambience is nice and cozy. Music again nice and sober. But the only reason for losing all these points is the service. You are treated as if you have done a crime by ordering food. Someone comes on your table to serve you.. they literally throw it on your table and before you can even ask them what it is... theyre nowhere to be found. This was my first time and trust me im never coming back.

We ordered chicken steak and the mixed grill sizzler along with fresh lime soda.
It Was 3pm on a Sunday. The place was moderately crowded. We entered and immediately got a table for two. We ordered within 5 minutes. The menu is reasonably long. As I have read in some other reviews, in my case too it did take a fair amount of time for the food  to arrive. But when we tasted the food we realised that 20 minutes were not wasted and they did use this time efficiently to prepare our meal.  Everything seemed really fresh and made from scratch. The mustard sauce that was spread on the chicken steak was extremely yummy. Am sure a lot of effort went into making that sauce. My sizzler had bite size chunks of chicken and mutton, it had prawn, mushrooms, grilled onion and green bell peppers along with broccoli and veggies and also smoked chicken sausage. Certain bites did remind of the house special sizzler from Peter Cat; though they are different in their own ways but in certain ways similar too for example the smoked sausage in the sizzler. The fresh lime soda did seem a little overpriced. It neither tasted extraordinary nor did it have a huge quantity. Will definitely visit again to try some more dishes because finishing each dish requires a full appetite, so a lot more visits are needed to try other items. So far they are not charging taxes on their food.

Paid a long due visit to this outlet this evening... Superb ambience, vibrant decor, youngish crowd, not so loud music, nice wooden seating arrangements... It's a likeable place both from the outside as well as inside...

Coming to the important part, we ordered Bacon wrapped Prawns which were outstanding to start with... Next up we chose the Garlic Prawn Pizza since it seemed different... And you bet it was... It took some time coming but it was worth the wait... Soft crunchy crust, cheese base with a generous helping of prawns neatly tucked in... This was brilliantly done... Next up were the main courses... First we ordered Baby back ribs in Barbecue sauce... This was the winner hands down... Juicy pork ribs slow cooked and smeared in Barbecue sauce... This was absolutely ethereal... We also ordered the Factory Mixed Grill... This dish had chicken, sausages, prawn and mutton... This was a rather light and healthy option... All steaks come in sizeable portions and with french fries and assorted vegetables... It helped that there were two of us so we could share and taste multiple dishes... The service was prompt enough and the waiters pretty helpful... And just to add all this came at around 1100 so it is quite easy on the pocket too... 

Unfortunately we were too full to try out the desserts... Probably a reason enough for going back... Maybe sometime soon...

Visited this place on 14th feb after hearing a lot from my friends and I must say the place is really good. The ambiance was great, songs of poets of the fall was in the background and the food was great as well. An evening well spent. I would have given 5 stars but they took a lot of time to serve. But I think this can be improved over the time.

The Steak Factory, Salt Lake had been on my list for a while. A sudden plan took me (along with my family) here for dinner yesterday.  Very satisfied with the taste this place offers.

LOCATION: This is bang opposite to Central Park, very easy to locate. You need to take the service lane for entry. Parking will not be a problem for sure! They take orders till 10.30pm. They have a separate cafe section for their much raved live ice creams and freshly brewed coffee.

AMBIENCE and DECOR: Kitschy wall art, neat ceiling paintings, framed retro posters and modern brick walls greeted us. The colour and overall vibe are really warm and cosy. They have a private dining set up too. The tables are well placed but somewhat cramped to accommodate more guests. But it doesn't really matter much.

SERVICE: Waiters are really well versed with the menu. I was ordering a Grilled Chicken Steak when this smiling fellow educated me that it will not be boneless. His suggestions were bang on! Seemed like the owners have trained them well with SOPs.

MAIN COURSE and BEVERAGES: We ordered the main course straightway because we were famished! Started with Factory Mixed Grill - Juicy mixed meat served with fresh veggies. Although it is served with fries (as mentioned in the menu ) it never reached our table! But the taste and the flavour of this dish was so perfect that we didn't really care to alarm the waiter.Next came the classic Chelow Kebab. This dish was a stunner. You got to try the tender sheek kebab to actually believe me. We were a little sceptical because Peter Cat has really raised our expectations of this dish, but we were proved wrong! Even the buttered rice tasted heaven.These were their Factory Specials. Next, we moved to some old school classic steaks.Yet again, although mentioned that these will be served with fries, the Surf + Turf Steak didn't have it!We delved into the juicy - tender classic Chicken Steak. The sauce was mouth-watering, veggies were fresh and the meat was well cooked. Surf + Turf Steak was a surprise delight! We wanted the meat to be well made, and taadaaa what a juicy serving! It is served along with veggies and mashed potatoes.All the dishes were perfect in terms of portion size!For thirst quenchers, we tried their Lemon Ice Tea ( must try ) which had oodles of lemon slices and made perfectly to suit my palate. The Blue Lagoon was served in a quirky glass bulb container. An instant hit for the young crowd.

DESSERTS: Though we were sad on missing out on the starters, their all natural Live Ice Creams well compensated! We ordered the Strawberry Ice Cream first, it was yumm. With every bite, we could well taste the fruit.Since our taste buds were not pleased, we went ahead ordering their Kiwi Ice Cream too.

This place is a must visit (read highly recommended). Guess what, all of this came well within Rs 2000, so total value for money.

This newly opened branch of Steak Factory was on my bucket list for a long time. 
So on the first day of this month I decided to visit it. The place has a very cool and young vibe going on. The decor and the ambiance is funky and cool with old english songs playing in the background.
The servers are cordial and quick in serving their food even if the place is buzzing with people.
We had ordered a calamari which was very tasty and tangy.
The chicken steak was good and had the perfect blend of flavours.
Easy on the pocket this place is surely a reccomendation :)

On a Sunday evening Continental food alwas meant Park St for Calcutta's ppl but I m sure it b changed to Steak Factory, Saltlake ... 
Started off with French Onion rings , Spicy Meat Balls  ( topped with grated cheese) made our hunger twice ... 
Chicken Quisselada is far better than many hyped restaurant in the city ... It had proper portion of meat which soft bread & was quite cheesy ... 
The Buffalo steak with prawns was exactly the taste it should have been & not chewy ... Many places hav set menu for Grilled Chicken steak but I was amazed to see they offer various choices of sauce according to our wish ... The mashed potato was heavenly .... 
This is the 1st restaurant in the city to hav Live Ice cream & it was mind blowing ... All the ingredients was fresh & not too sweet ... 
It was really a great experience to be in Steak Factory .... Good Food ... Nice decor & Get Music ...  Keep it up

I visited this place on 14th February and as expected it was pretty crowded that day. The service was very clumsy because after we finished the appetizers, the waiter just put down my steak on the table instead of clearing the dishes first. On top of that they served my order first and my mother's order five minutes later and I had to wait for her food to arrive.
We ordered chilli pork for appetizers and then we had the tenderloin steak and the steak factory mixed grill. The food was a quite salty and the steak was chewy.
To sum it up, I had higher expectations from this place and was delighted to hear that they've opened up a branch at Salt Lake, but my first visit was not very pleasant.

A really amazing place .... I love the ambience  and loved the steak it was well made as told and the service was amazing tooo ... I truly enjoyed my food... 
 THE TENDERLOIN STEAK : 
Man really well made and was delicious ... The best part is as many other steak houses they do not pour the sauce all over the steak N bring it they bring it in a bowl letting you to make your steak as spicy as your wish I would rate this a 4 out of 5 ... The steak could have been a bit bigger though 

FACTORY GRILLED FISH :
This was not upto the expectation though it was kinda not made the way a fish steak should would go for nothing more than a 2 star 

Chef SALAD 

This was really good I loved the proportion of meat and sauce and everything put in the salad 4 star out of 5

CHICKEN STRAGANOFF: 

Was good though but a STRAGANOFF has a mix of cheesy spicyness and saltiness which it lacked but still I loved the quality they provided in it 

In short I kinda enjoyed my evening looking forward to have some specials they can offer to treat my taste buds a place a guy in saltlake should visit ...
All the best to the team

The Steak Factory is one of the finest continental restaurant that I have been in a while.
This place has an attractive decor, with simple yet amazing doodles all around the walls of the restaurant. I'm also pleased with their service.
Coming to the food, my friends and I had ordered -
1. Bacon wrapped prawns- a great dish to start your course with, soft and tender prawns wrapped with bacon that are amazingly cooked and has a tempting smoky aroma coming out of it.
2. Lamb Lasagna- This is the best lasagna I've ever had. Thes lasagna had right amount of cheese and spice in it. A perfect balance of flavours.
3. Factory Special Chicken Cheese steak - the taste of both the chicken and the sauce were absolutely perfect. A great dish indeed.
4. Ham Steak- honestly, I didn't like the flavour of sauce and also the ham. Taste wise it could have been better.

To sum up my experience here, commendable food, soothing and appealing ambience and great service.
Visit this place, people. You'll love it.

Ambiance and decor is neat, decent, cozy, and kitschy with framed photographs on walls of celebrities, cute graffiti on walls and ceiling etc. coupled with mellow western music in the background.
On an earlier occasion, back when it had opened as The Steak Factory, when we'd entered the eatery in the afternoon it had been empty except for one guest and the two of us.
We'd ordered the chicken wings followed by mozzarella cheese sticks.
The chicken wings had been tasty enough, smeared in sticky sauce, though it hadn't been able to quite cater to my tastebuds. The cheese sticks however had been good, brimming with oozy mozzarella, but had lacked in salt. Dipped in a lovely dip they'd more or less tasted delish.
However I'd found the actions of the attendant who'd served us then, even though gracious and cordial, a little politely offensive, and had hardly given us time to decide and then place the order.
Revisited it again on a sudden unplanned occasion for some afternoon snacks with a relative. They have the cafe and the proper restaurant on either side; the right side one is the cafe while the left door lets one into the eatery. One can enter the eatery through the cafe as well. We'd preferred the cafe but instead chose to sit in the main eatery. The cafe menu is served in the restaurant as well.
This time too it had been quite empty except a couple and us. The service of the attendants this time were swift, courteous and efficient; they kept on refilling our glasses with water from time to time, and gently asked us each time before removing the plates, which many reputed restaurants at times neglect or tend to overlook and hence face complaints from customers.
We ordered the chicken sandwich and Chocolate Monte Carlo. The grilled sandwiches were average, could have been better, tastier and fresher. The dessert item was however good and something worth relishing. Those who love chocolate ice cream like me should at least opt for the Monte Carlo in the menu for dessert.
Despite some of my foodie friends showering praises on this eatery and its food, The Steak & Grill still needs to improve the taste, quality and freshness of some of their offerings, for not all items, besides perhaps their steaks and sizzlers, are highly notable.
For those with a continental inclination and fond of steaks can try out this quaint and cozy cafe-cum-restaurant at Salt Lake.

The newbie on Saltlake's oldest eat street. This is located on the cab road of Nargis Restaurant.
I happened to chance a look at this restaurant when it was still being fitout for service. I spoke to the store owner who mentioned they would open in the new year.
I took my wife out the week it opened.
Ambiance : Glass bulbs hanging from the ceiling and frescos of food and graffiti across the walls. Wooden finish floors make it very attractive.
Food: We had grilled chicken , Fish n chips , beacon wrapped prawns. Simply delicious.
Service: Overall good, they could do better
Price Pinch : 1500 for two

I had heard a lot about this place, and once it opened in Salt Lake, I simply had to try it out.
What strikes one immediately on entering is the warm, homely ambience. Quirky decor and great music (you can't go wrong with Coldplay, Bob Dylan, Nirvana and other legends) provide the perfect setting for a great meal.
Since the place is renowned for its steaks, we went straight to those, ordering a Pork Chop and a Ham Steak. It can safely be said that this is the best steakhouse in Kolkata. Portions were slightly on the smaller side, but the quality of cooking more than made up for it. The pork was delectably juicy and tender, with the meat easily falling off the bone.

Overall, a hugely satisfying experience. I would strongly recommend this place to all meat lovers.

I went for dinner tonight with my son. It was indeed a pleasure , the ambience , well decorated walls with yesteryear celebrities . Regards to the food, well thought out menu , pocket friendly prices.

We ordered Spicy chili pork , tenderloin steak and pork chops. The quality of the meat was really top class.

Spicy Chili pork - Hot and spicy and also the crunch was there.
Pork Chops - The meat was falling of the bone and the red sauce was indeed tasty.
Tenderloin steak - Medium rare - Perfectly cooked , mashed potato was well done. 

Service - Excellent. 

Will definitely go back.

We went to the Steak Factory on a quite Wednesday afternoon. The place was moderately filled with customers happily chatting away in the snug and cozy decor under the watchful eyes of classic rock and pop legends.

We ordered the fresh on the menu Bacon and Mozzarella Stuffed Garlic Bread and the recommended Tenderloin Steak to being with accompanied by a glass each of the Shirley Temple and Virgin Pinacolada. Unfortunately for us, while we were quite hungry one of the restaurant's chefs was not in which took an abnormally long time to prepare the order for each table. When the food did come, starving as we were by that time, both my friend and I dug into it. The Bacon and Mozzarella Stuffed Garlic Bread was mostly bland on the tongue. Now though the vegetables, the mashed potatoes, even the onion in the steak tasted wonderful, the steak itself had too much salt which ruined the flavour after a while.

As we were still hungry we further ordered the BBQed Pork Ribs and while this didn't take nearly as much time to arrive, the ribs were clearly over-cooked and had become too hard to chew through. My friend had to call the chef and the staff quickly admitted their mistake (even that the Ribs were over done) and offered to replace. We chose instead to skip to dessert which was undoubtedly the most satisfying delight of this steakhouse, both visually and gastronomically. We ordered the Steak Factory special live ice cream rolls. For those who haven't already seen the Facebook and YouTube videos, rolled ice cream or ice cream rolls is when ice cream is made by pouring creamy milk or custard with toppings and flavours on an icy cold plate, mixed well, the concoction then flattened on the plate and then scrapped into rolls. The staff offers customers to see the making of the rolls which is a first of its kind experience in Kolkata. We ordered the Oreo flavoured ice cream rolls and on our first bite into the ice cream it was clear that the mixing of the flavours was done brilliantly. The ice cream hit just the right sweet spots and as I said before, was without a doubt the only thing that allowed us to leave the place with a smile on our lips.

P.S. a list of good things about the food - 
1. The Pork Ribs sauce was a beautiful combination of hot and spicy.
2. The staff was gracious enough to accept their lacunae, in the food as well as service and courteous while customers lathered suggestions.
3. The ice cream rolls, definitely worth a visit a second time around, if only for these!

Overall it was a horrific experience. I dont know who recruited such staffs. Food was ok, nothing extraordinary. The one at rabindra sarovar is/was much much better.

We went in a group of 6 for lunch. Nice cozy place with admirable interior. We ordered 1 chicken nuggets and 1 mozarella chicken sticks as starter. Nuggets come in 8 small pieces but 2nd item is worth mentioning since it tastes really good. In main course we ordered 3 chello kebabs, 1 burger, 1 fish carnival and 1 factory grilled fish. Chelo kabab was ordinary. Other items tasted very good although fish was basa. We requested for some butter (for adding to chello kebab which it was originally missing) which took quite some time....otherwise service speed was good. Bill also took some time. Overall it is a very good pocket friendly restaurant to hang out with friends

This branch of Steak Factory is brand new, it opened on the 3rd of Jan this year and so its likely that you will get mixed reviews about the experience there. Some people have complained about the food not being of consistent quality for example. However, for me, I have been consistently impressed, their food, staff, cleanliness, service, decor (which is really the same in all branches), ambience are all great. For those who havent tried Steak Factory i would definitely recomend it. A lot of vegetarians shy away from this restaurant but trust me, do not go by the name. The Mac and cheese here is unparalelled. 

Reco:
Macaroni and cheese
Chicken Mozzarella fingers
Chicken steak
Right now, the pork ribs and chops seem dicey, here although i have always enjoyed it in the other branches. - thats a tip to the branch if you're reading!

Please try this place out!

We left, disgusted, halfway through dinner. 

Tonight was my first evening out this year after a bad motorcycle accident, and we stopped by for dinner on my way home from the hospital. Ordered the tenderloin and a burger. The tenderloin came out with hair in it, so we sent it back (wait staff was great about this). We split the burger and waited for the steak to come back out. 

Unfortunately, while waiting, my friend noticed there was lipstick on her glass. She wasn't wearing lipstick. 

She was too grossed out to eat anything else; we left without waiting for the steak. They said there was no manager or owner there who we could talk to about this. 

I wasn't too impressed with their Southern Avenue outlet when I tried it a couple of years ago, but I had *really* high hopes for a steak place in Salt Lake. Unfortunately, there are highway dhabas and tea stalls that are cleaner than these guys.

Went there with frndz for dinner. had ordered for mutton steak,churrasco steak and chckn creamy broth. Firstly the service at this place is vry bad compared to other steak factory outlets. you have to go there and wait for vry long tym before any service person wl even come to your table.secondly the time it takes to get the food is like way long. it took us more than an hour for our food to reach our table. the mutton steak and the broth was ok. infact mutton steak was bttr than we expected. but for the churraaco it was okish in taste but the dish was not at al warm. it was cold when it was served to us. Overall after going to other steak fac outlets i expected atleast the same service here.

I've been to the other outlets of steak factory before.This one has spacious interiors, nice decor. We had mutton steak and surf turk steak which was decent.The grilled fish was awesome.I liked the Nachos,cocktail sausage and the calamari dish too. But the caramel custard that we had ordered turned out to be extremely bitter in taste and the waiters (who were extremely well behaved) said they cannot do anything about it . Except this thing, i liked the experience overall

Amazing place.
Amazing ambience.
Amazing staff behaviour.
A 5/5 for the hospitality!
I'd have rated this place 5 if only they didn't have a used spoon on the table but that's perfectly fine because the food is delicious just like that of the other two branches.
Must try - The Surf - Turf steak ( it's a portion of tenderloin+pork) and the chelo kebab is worth a try ( good quantity for one person ) . Also, the tiramisu, mozzarella chicken sticks, lamb lasagna, chicken parmiginia, bacon wrapped prawns, and basically everything else is amazing. I would suggest not to try the steakhouse steak as it is of no good and so is the raspberry cheesecake. Most of the other items on the menu are totally worth the money if you're into continental food.
And the best part for a place like this?
Congrats!
The prices are inclusive of all taxes!
Smile smile smile and go hit the place right now.
They don't accept cards at present right now but there's an ATM right beside it.
ENJOY!
Happy Steak-ing!

went with lot of expectation.But it didn't went that well.First salt lake branch is new so it does not accept card.
As we went to ATM, we had some awesome bapi da fish pakoda on our way :p  .So little bit of our appetite was gone.we ordered mozzarella stuffed meat ball(not crispy,less cheese,i wasted one),smoky grilled chicken risotto(ok ok),apple pie(best thing we had) and jungle juice.
mozzarella stuffed meat ball was not served with any dip.
jungle juice was over priced "Maaza".
risotto was comparatively descent.
But apple pie with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce was too yummy.
ambiance is really cool.

This monday went to the steak factory salt lake for dinner with family. Ordered tenderloin steak, pork chops, pork ribs. Before even bragging about the food lemme say this that The steak factory has become a chain of three restaurants now. All of them serve amazing continental food. Coming back to the food as always its ecstatic. I wonder how they manage to work this   magic of all the wonderful flavours right on the platter. Needless to say each and every item was pure pleasure for the taste buds. But the show stopper was the blue berry cheese cake. God!!!! It was the best. Loved the decor and the staff was very warm and welcoming. This would be my place for dinner every weekend now.

This is a brand new addition to our locality. The interiors are larger than the other two outlets of steak factory. The decor is nice and quirky with the ambience enhanced by great music played in the background. Coming to the service, the waiters are amateurish but cordial, polite and soft spoken. They will treat you to their best. The food is average and quantity is moderate. We had ordered French Onion Rings which came with a Tartar type of dip. There were 10 rings per plate which were crunch juicy and delicious. The Mozzarella Cheese Sticks were stringy and Cheesy but lacked seasoning and tasted bland. They served just 6 sticks and charged 180rs per plate which I felt was tad bit overpriced. We wanted to taste the Barbeque Pork Ribs but they were already exhausted. Thus we ordered 2 Pork Chop Steaks. Both came with different sizes of pork chops, different quantities of steamed vegetables and potatoes and the inconsistency was very much visible. Then we ordered an apple pie with vanilla ice cream. The first one came with hair in it. After showing it to the waiter, it was changed. I can handle not-so-good food but just can't handle hair in my food served at a restaurant. That too from a big name in the city and charging around 500rs per head on an average. So I was pretty disappointed.

This is located just opposite central park and beside the other restros like mallika and nargis. The space is quite bigger than the southern avenue one. The ambience is what i liked the most with music being played in background. Here we ordered grilled chicken steak. First of all we were told that it is a boneless chicken dish but were given with bone chicken. The piece was quite big for a person. It had a cheese base with veggies and french fries. However the taste was good. Next we ordered monte carlo. It took a great deal of time to arrive. When it arrived it was set in a small glass. It has vanilla ice cream on top and a layer of frozen chocolate cake again a layer of ice cream and a layer of cake. It tasted okay.

Salt Lake sadly lacks the kind of places I love to eat at.. not anymore! :D

We finally have THIS amazing place.. almost.. like next door! The signage and the ongoing work kept me excited for past few weeks!

So far I have eaten here twice, and both of them have been an excellent experience. Love the quirky interiors and ambiance, the courteous and friendly staff and lip-smacking food. 

So far we have tasted - Golden Fried Babycorn and Mushrooms, Bacon Wrapped Prawns, Chicken Steak, Veg Charcoal Steak, french fries and Mojitos.  Everything is tasty and its evident that fresh ingredients have been used (The Seafood is the biggest indicator!) Steaks were served with yummy gravies, egg and nice-fresh, steamed vegetables. I so want to try their desserts in my consecutive visits. 

Another exciting feature of this place would be a Breakfast Counter, which I am looking forward to!!

Looking at the Saturday night crowd, I am sure this place will be extremely popular in this area and would do well!

A perfect dinner place. We had Barbeque Pork Ribs, Tenderloin Steak, Orange Flake Mocktail & Choco Brownie With Choco Ice Cream. The main course items were simply magnificent. Juicy beef steak & the barbeque sauce was too good on those pork ribs. The Mocktail was average & the desert was again pretty good. The atmosphere was impressive. The problem with this outlet is the size. It can be a bit noisy sometimes. Behavior of the waiters was also commendable.

We visited this outlet on its 3rd day of service, & it was the 1st saturday they were serving. Obviously there were a few hiccups, but the manager & the servers were polite enough. As for the food, we ordered tenderloin steak which was juicy & tasty, pork sizzler which tasted awesome with the sauce, and spaghetti with meatballs which was tasty as well. The tenderloin steak was a tad bit on the chewy side but other than that all the other correct boxes were ticked. For dessert we ordered icecream as at 11.30pm, the only other dessert they had was caramel custard. Over all, good food, a bit slow but polite service. Payment in cash till now.

Quite excited that they opened up in Salt Lake! However, found minor differences in the food served when compared to their Southern Avenue outlet! Tried our favourites- well done tenderloin steak, barbeque pork ribs and tenderloin burger.
The well done was tad a bit too chewy! I liked their new presentation but missed the caramelised onion rings! The barbeque sauce was excellent with that stickiness and sugariness!! 
The burger was average! The beef patty was superb in size! No card payments yet. Decor is really nice!

Re-visited in the month of August.

Opted for their lamb meatball pizza - Hard crust, and very thick. The pizza sauce was not upto the mark. The pizza itself lacked cheese, flavours, somehow not at all satisfying.

Nxt, pork sizzlers  - Still better, but the pork chunks used were almost no meat, and lots of fat. 

Cheese Tenderloin Steak - Cheese could have been more. The meat was soft in the center. The sides were chewy and could not be consumed at all. An utter waste of 1200 rupees or so. Not going back again.

We did not have a pleasant experience at all. We ordered two starters, Bacon wrapped prawn and Meatballs. Bacon wrapped prawn was good and made perfectly, but the meatballs were so spicy and hot that our mouths were numb and we had to drink a lot of water for the sensation to subside. The experience started going downhill from there. The waiter was unable to provide descriptions of items on the menu, and we thought that one of our dishes (a fish item) did not match his description at all. The burger was okay. Chicken a la Kiev was a disaster, the butter was not molten, and it was as dry as a bone. No seasonings either. They replaced it, but it took them another 20-25 minutes for that. This time it was better though. The main courses came out at different times, so that at any given point of time, only two or three of us were eating while the rest were just sitting, waiting for the food. The broccoli that came with the vegetables was not washed properly and clearly had sand and soil in them.
All in all, I would say that I was sorely disappointed. No one even ventured to say "sorry" for all the hiccups that we had. At the very least, we expected the manager to come to our table at the end and apologize for the evidently pathetic experience that we had. I have been to places where the manager would have even taken off a dish or two from the bill for our experience. I am never coming back and will recommend my friends and acquaintances to stay off.

This restaurant built  it's  reputation  through  the other branches that they have in the city of Kolkata.  
Absolutely  delicious  food. This outlet  is no exception in serving  quality  food.  
 The bacon wrapped  prawn is luscious. The Tenderloin  steak is also  pretty  good. The prices in menu are inclusive  of all the taxes and is pretty much affordable. Continental  food at affordable  prices is seldom found in Kolkata.

Just opened a day ago this outlet has almost surpassed the other two outlets of its own kind in terms of the decor. Went there last evening with family. Ordered bacon wrapped prawn, tenderloin steak, chicken steak, spicy chilli pork, caramel custard and brownie. The food needless to say is living up to the quality of 'The Steak Factory'. Delicious and lip smacking as usual with the warmth of the staff everything just added to my wonderful experience over here. Coming to the desserts the taste would give everyone a sweet tooth...yum....must visit for everyone in town.

This well known restaurant for steaks has now opened up in salt lake and I visited it with my girl yesterday on its inaugral operating day...The seating area will unimaginably exceed your expectations developed from seeing the restaurant from the outside..the decor is very charming...the lights,james bond,monroe,other hollywood framed pictures hanging on the inner walls,the steak,bacon and other food graphitis add a different flavour to your experience of seating in there and having you food..their menu is abundant in continental stuff and you have just so many different dishes to choose from..the prices are relatively much lower if you compare it to similar restaurants of almost similar stature and popularity...We had 1)The factory special cheese chicken steak (cost us rs 370 and was served with boiled beans,carrot,cauliflower ; french fries and half fried egg) and i can easily claim that this is the best steak i've ever had...perfectly shaped and sized, every chunk tasted delightful..the quantity was good enough to satiate 2...2)French Onion Rings served with a yummy mayo dip (cost us rs 80 and comprised of round shaped cut onions fried in besan probably)- was really crunchy and tasted good as well..There were more than 10 such rings in a plate of rs 80 and i'm sure 3 people can easily share it for starters..so quantity and quality were both right up there and the price won't bite into your pockets either..staff behaviour is courteous and service is good..serving time was a tad slow but that is probably because it was their first operating day..Il definitely recommend this to all the steak and continental lovers out there and can surely see myself going back there again and again..I see this place soon becoming a very popular destination for all the salt lake lads and ladies....

This place is great. Brilliant steaks and roasts. Loved the pork chops and bacon wrapped prawns. The ambiance is nice too, and staff is courteous and helpful.

The steak & grill has become a big brand and a new sensation now ... and with the opening of the Salt Lake outlet it has created a rage for foodies in salt lake ...  ... love their steaks, pizzas and sizzler ....Live roll ice creams.
