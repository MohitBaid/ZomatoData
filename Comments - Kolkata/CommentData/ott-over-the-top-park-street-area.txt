Great ambience and great food. Tried Nepoletana and Brochette. Nepoltana was tasty and a bit crispy with the right amount of ingredients. The playlist is good and the staffs are friendly. The ambience is perfect for a hang out time with friends. Also the location favours in giving it some browny points. Perfect to spend your winter evenings. ‚≠ê

In the evening time we moved on to OTT at 6 p.m. just after the sunset & the ambience of the roof was adorable with Dj playing the music & cool breeze flowing. We order Garlic Bread & Mix Sauce Pasta, it was good in taste but a bit punching to your pockets. Prices are higher a bit which worth can be provided by increasing the quantity of food. Apart from this everything was good.

Fairly good place. The ambience is nice and the playlist is amazing! The staff is friendly and helpful.
Coming to the food, the Baked Mushroom Caps were amazing! Really, delicious but the quantity is less. Then I ordered the risotto with asparagus which initially didn't have salt but when we sent it back, the taste had improved. The hookah was smooth. However, I found the place to be quite small, but then again it adds to the quaintness of the place. The bill doesn't burn a hole in your pocket. Overall, a good place to hang out.

Christmas is the perfect time to celebrate and to create memories that will last forever. Yesterday, we the group of 4 people headed to park street and the the streets were very crowded and noisy. OTT is one of the best rooftop in Kolkata, it is situated beside KFC in MYX building. But this rooftop is not so big, we checked in there around 7pm and they asked for a cover charge of rs 1500 for 2 people. Then we entered the OTT which was on 6th floor. The seating arrangements were very good, white tables, swing seats, little candle lamps on the table with a little fountain beside a table. The ambiance and the songs were so perfect to chill with your loved ones. The food was good except the falafel was little bit cold. We ordered for beers, breezers, one hookah falafel, french fries, chicken and fish sizzlers and hot chocolate molten cake. The chicken sizzler was delicious but the services were too slow due christmas eve. We liked the place but there are some points you keep in mind before visiting that place. One is they don't allow stag entry and other one is, it's very costly, they charge a plate of french fries at 279/- and yes they also levy service tax.

This happens to be my first review on Zomato and unfortunately enough I am writing this out of a very sorry experience. My friend and myself went to this place on the 19th of this month. We were denied entry stating that single entry is not allowed. Now I have no clue what sort of public place discriminates people based on gender. The biggest shocker being ladies only entry is allowed while men's only entry is restricted. The management ought to be sued legally for this extremely derogatory practice. These are the very reasons why social unrest prevails.

6th floor of the building where Sourav's the food pavilion was located earlier. Downstairs to it is the Myx. Nice open rooftop ambience with a good view of the newly erected 62 floored India's tallest building till date, The 42. Good food, reasonable price for beer and other alcohol. Hookah available. The great location of Park Street is a rewarding one for both the owner(s) and visitors. Had a nice time during my visit here. Thanks!

I say why keep a rooftop when you havent got enough space to accomodate people??
This is what i felt exactly when i visited this place. A lot of people in a small place trying to find a place to sit and relax...i found this place a wastage of money and the dj is mostly busy in hookah himself and focuses less on the music he is playing.

This place is great for evening outings, you can catch up with friends, feel the breeze and also drink a few rounds. Great pizzas - loved the pepperoni. The inside is well lit, the open space has a swanky fountain. The chairs make me fall asleep everytime, very very comfortable. Clean and neat for an outside rooftop bar.

Nice place with rooftop seating arrangement. The speciality of the place is the rooftop ambience. DJ will be there to play the music of your choice. In the evening it is usually a bit overcrowded, particularly on weekends. The food is good but I have to comment on the quality of service it's not at all up to the mark. They took half and hour to serve a pitcher of beer and a starter.

Very average place with overpriced food. We went around 4pm for a late lunch. The main reason we wanted to visit this place was for the rooftop and that was the only saving grace! Though the sitting capacity is quite limited, the ambience is good. Tgw music was too loud though.
We ordered a kebab dish, one thin crust pizza and another Chinese starter and two cocktails. All 3 were highly average and the cocktails were just about okay.
The bill just did not justify the quality or quantity of food. Probably won't visit again.

The area is not so big but the place, ambience , staffs and everything i found was superb , mind blowing....all were so professional in their work ...it can be your everyday evening adda where you can spend lots of time...!! 

I will definitely recommend you guys to come here and see the people around...i love it awesome view ...a place which is amongst one of my favourite place !!

Situated just opposite Peter Cat in Park Street, this roof top offers the balance of calmness and excitement at the same time. I went there with my friend and we order 3 appetizers. One of fish, one of roasted chicken and one lamb. They were delicious. Then we ordered a couple of beers and a pitcher of LIIT. Prices on Zomato differ a tad bit from one which are printed on their menu. Look out for that ! üëç We ordered a Pizza as our main course and a Pana Cotta as dessert. The whole experience was worth every penny. Ideally cost for 2 with decent food and drinks would cost close to 2000.. mine costed me around 3600. Thanks OTT for making my evening special ! üòä

There was a private party going on, but we were given a table for 6 of us. After half an hour we got a waiter to place our order, we ordered a chirpy chill babycorn, we got it after 1 hour 20 minutes. We ordered pizza next, still have not received it, I'm writing this sitting here, it has been around another hour since we ordered. Hopelessly bad service.

Sad music, bad service, poor quality shisha. The only positive about the place is its a rooftop place. But the sad songs just kill all the buzz. Place to sit and drown in sorrow. Nothing more. Left after sitting for about 15-20 minutes and listening to Atif Aslam crying. The crowd wouldn't let the DJ even change the kind of music, so maybe that's why the atmosphere ended up being this way. Bad bad bad!

Take the lane adjacent to Flurys, walk for 2 minutes and you will find the OTT building to your left. Located on the 6th floor, this rooftop bar offers you good food, average cocktails and decent service. Best time to visit would be in Winter after 7:30pm.

This place could be unbearable if you are not too fond of loud music. We could dine in peace only after the Dj left. 

What we liked -

Hanky Panky (cocktail), Crispy Fried Chicken, Chicken Tikka Pizza.

Price is okay.

We went to this place at around 7pm in a group of 4 people including me. The location of the place is a bit tricky but it's not such a problem as The Myx building is quite known there. The restaurant is located on the rooftop of the building, 6th floor. You won't get a view of the city, it's just a rooftop place with a beautiful ambience. The background music keeps you in a good mood always.
Coming to the food, we ordered a Saporita pizza along with some Peri Peri Chicken. Both of them were really tasty and had perfect texture to blend in with the drinks. Coming to the drinks, we ordered a Long Island Iced Tea pitcher which was not as good as the one they serve in Hoppipola! We ordered a Kingfisher draught beer tower but alas, they only serve mild beer so it was a let down. We also had three large shots of Tequila (La Chica Gold) which was served the right way. We also had Blood Bath cocktail pitcher followed by a OTT special five spirit punch cocktail pitcher. Yes I know it's a lot of alcohol but we wanted to get wasted that night so. And as I told you, the awesome music just makes you wanna go wild!
It is a great place to enjoy some drinks and have fun with your friends.

It's a comparatively smaller place than I imagined it to be. Went there with friends and found the place empty initially. But with time it was completely filled up in around an hour. We ordered a pizza and mocktails. Pizza was good but I didn't like any of the mocktails. I found them too be a bit too sour. Once the sun was set, the place turned out to be pretty nice. What was annoying was the music.. the speakers and the music system crashed multiple times.
If you want to visit this place do visit this place after sunset. And do go in a group because it's a place where you can have a really good adda!

I went on a Sunday. Service offered was very bad. Had to wait 40 minutes for 1 Shisha. Had 3 shisha and bill was made of 4. We were told there is no coal change on a Sunday but just beside our table coal change was done. I saw it. Even complained. They made an excuse. Had to wait a very long time for everything including a bottle of water. Not at all expected at such a famous place. It was the first and the last visit. That 1 point is just for the very delicious pizza. Things except pizza were really bad. And the worst were the juices. From my side, if you are very keen to visit then never make it on a Sunday.

Now coming to food quality, it is satisfactory. Beverages are reasonable and not at all overpriced. Food service is also very good as the authority here is very polite and attentive. This place deserves a try if you want to experience rooftop restaurants and for me I would love to come back once again.

One of the most over hyped restaurant with the slowest service and even worse food and to top it they gloriously added a 5% service charge to the bill without asking us and charged us for a shisha,the order for which was never placed. It doesn't end here it is the only NON AC RESTAURANT in Kolkata I suppose where we were charged a GST of 18% on the total bill to which the manager's casual reply was "I don't know about the correct tax rates but we've been informed to charge 18% GST so you've to pay it".

Okay. This place is at the top floor in Myx building. Their ambience is good. Music playing in background. Roof top. White chairs and tables. Perfect for evening time. But the waiters and service here is horrible. They are soo inattentive. They just don't care which guests want what. Now coming to the food. Nothing was available. Whatever we were asking wasnt available. They themselves agreed that except 3-4 items nothing is there. Anyway we ordered an apple mint hukka, fried chicken and 3 beers. Hukka was strong at first but they changed it later on. Food wasnt that good. Quantity was too less. This costed us 1500. Like they charged each bira bottle for 275 rupees. It was disgusting to see that. And when we asked the waiters about it. They were really rude to us. Hence apart from the ambience there is nothing we liked about this place. Totally disappointed.

Compared to other places, the pricing is quite reasonable over here. However, the service could be a bit better if they look into it.

The variety of the liquor and cocktail menu is good but the food menu is quite limited.

OTT is situated just beside the Park Street KFC (opposite Peter Cat). As we went there on Durga Puja Sasthi Night we had to wait for about 10-15 minutes to get a table for the four of us at around 7:30.

The rooftop area isn't much big but i really like their seating arrangements (white furnitures with red cushions, swing seats and the pretty little candle lamps on the tables). Initially they played 90s pop songs (which I heard after a long time and must say it was pretty nostalgic!). The party feeling gradually pumped up with the DJ playing the recent hit tracks.

Coming to the food and drinks, i would rate them 3 out of 5. We ordered Crispy Chilly Baby Corn, Crispy Fried Sesame Chicken, Fizzy Mojito Pitcher and BOTT Pitcher. The Baby Corn was good but not spicy at all as mentioned in the name  of the dish. THE CHICKEN WAS YUMM!! Mojito was good but i didn't like BOTT at all which tasted like some medical syrup! By mistake the staffs served us an extra plate of Sesame Chicken which was someone else's order. Nevermind, we added that to our bill. And yes, they serve Hookahs too. Two of my friends ordered a Hookah but since I'm not a Hookah-person, I can't comment on that.

Overall the place is good for having some finger food and chill out in the open air.

My rating is likely biased towards this place cuz I luuuv Turquoise. And this restaurant has so much turquoise colour all over!
The cocktails were good, the food was just decent. It's a rooftop restaurant, but not with a view. Decent music, there's foosball and stuff to enjoy for a while. The candle light lamps around are super cute. Not a great place, but not bad for a one time visit.

Went here with a group of friends and was absolutely delighted with the place. Tried the pizza and focused more on the beers. The food was good, the service was decent but the ambience took the cake.

Cannot wait to go back to OTT once the winters kick in and enjoy the ambience with some hookah!

Last to last Saturday, a sudden visit at Ott myx.Ideal ambience with excellent music.The first part was with the mid summer rim or the green eyed monster. The second part wouldn't have been better without chicken tikka pizza and sesame chicken. Though the price is costly still worth paying for such delicious fooding. The little lamp on each table would attract anybody, in the background the bold white chairs.

OTT's ambience is at a high par but unfortunately nothing else about the place fulfils expectations. 
The mixed sauce pasta is nice & the mocktails are very basic. Also my friends several number of times made the comment that the Hookah chokes. The music gets over bearing to the ears specially for those whose seats are near to the speakers & they should take care about this issue. 
The place is very pretty & one should go there merely for the ambience. The pricing is on the higher side when compared to quantity they serve. Plus point: their service is pretty fast.

Everything about this place is average. Average food, average ambience, average staff.  The woman at the reception is horribly rude who can only make faces whereas she is supposed to greet with a smile. She kept telling us there's no place whereas there were empty tables without any reservation on them. When confronted she said they were for guests but at the beginning itself she said we don't take reservations ü§îü§îü§î so how did these so called 'guests' book a table from before??? Learn how to lie effectively woman. Only positive it's decently priced. It's just a small ordinary terrace converted into a sitting area with music playing behind.

Can you imagine, when you order beer in a place like OTT and the waiter says "Sorry Sir, not available". On Saturday evening when you are in full mood to enjoy the humidity and light breeze of Kolkata on a roof top restobar with chilled beer, such reply spoils your evening. The opening timings were till 12 midnight and it was only 9:45PM. No draught beer, No Carlsberg, No Heineken, No Budweiser. What should I do? , where should I go? , I was flabbergasted. 

We have waited for 45 minutes outside the reception for entry. After the entry we were amazed to see that many chairs were empty. On enquiry the manager said that the empty chairs are for regular customers. That means he does not want me to become regular. At around 10:30 PM I was searching for another happening place in the surrounding area. 

The only beer which was available there was Bira white. Overly priced and not chilled. We ordered one pint to mitigate the thirst. The blunder and cheating done by restaurant is that they charged 18%GST on üçª and 5% Service charge. I paid Rs. 400/- for a pint of Bira. Thereafter when I went to another restaurant, I came to know that there is no GST on alcohol served in restaurants. Isn't this a malpractice done by restaurant. These guys are extracting money in the name of tax which government has not asked for. I suggest everybody to avoid OTT in future as they are unprofessional, they are cheat and most importantly they are least prepared to serve you. So don't spoil your evening at OTT.

This place was in my list for quite a while until the time i finally went there yesterday on a regular monday evening with a very old friend.A descent lounge with good music ...apart from the fact that the  outer wall of the outer deck is covered in such a way that you  can't have a view of the kolkatta skyline ..which cud have been a thumbs up if it wasn't so..amywaz i quite liked the myx becos of the dance floor is decently spacious and the blue ambient disco lights and a pretty descen@t bar and good selection of songs made it quite likely.Food was on the better side though haven't tasted any exotic dish but the food satisfied our palettes. As far as the outer deck is concerned i really think that the visibilty of the city skyline wud make it much better than what it is now all over a descent place to be.. wouldn't mind going back again.

So we have been to this place yesterday. This place is small compared to what I imagined. It was completely packed on a weekday so I felt little¬†claustrophobic initially.But Music is plus point, especially for Bollywood music lovers.It sets a good mood for the crowd. Food is not bad and not too expensive.The ambiance is good. Few things like they didn't¬†even place tissue paper on the tables they should take care of that. I wish the place would have been more spacious but in case it's not too crowded then it's a good place to hang out and have a good time.

After a long and action filled week, me and my friend decided to unwind over a couple of drinks. We were not looking for anything expensive but just good enough to lift our mood.

On searching thorugh Zomato, we came across this resturant. The resturant is situated opposite Peter Cat. What attracted both of us is the idea of sitting on roof top and enjoying the night view of Park Street  while taking a sipping our drinks. However, the reality was a bit different.

Ambience: üëçüëçüëç out of 5
The place has limited sitting. A small bar counter and a DJ playing music, greets us on reaching the resturant. Big dissapoint for us, the expected roof top view was all covered up with translucent glass. As it was night time with a slow wind, sitting under the open sky was still relaxing. 
To set a calm mood, they kept the lighting low and less. Unfortunately, the lighting was so low that we could hardly read the menu. We had to use our mobile torch to read the menu, which was embarassing. 

Staff and Service : üëçüëç out of 5
The staff was courteous and the service was good. They were helpful while chossing our menu. The service was prompt. All was good when at the end they informed us they have made a mistake on our bill, they ended up charging someone else for our drinks. We had a quite a conversation before the waiter admitted and issued a second bill. 

Food and Drinks: üëçüëç üëçout of 5
They menu had plenty of option to choose from. For drinks we chose one 'Appily Married' and a classic 'Black Russian'. Both of the drinks have vodka as the base. Appily Married has a sweet, and sour flavour, for it has honey and apple juice in the mixture. 
The classic Black Russian does not have chocolate and cream. The White Russian does have whipping cream as ingredient but not chocolate. This one has been changed to have chocolate and cream, making it more sweet and smoother in taste. Both the drinks were ok but too light to start with.

 To satisfy our urge to have a non veg item, we decided for having the crispy fried sesame chicken. The chicken was nice and crispy and tasted good with the chef's special sauce on it.

Overall the experience was average beacuse of the expectation of a roof top view of the city and the cocktails lacking the punch. But it was easy on the pocket and good to hang out for couples and small groupies.

They don't allow kids. I don't know if it's legal to restrict Indians in public places on Indian soil. If it's for safety then how can they assume an adult do not need safety. On the contrary they need to improve their safety measures.

We went there only for the drinks. The price is a little on the higher side. We ordered a pitcher for all of us which was more or less okay in quantity and price. We also had Jim Beam White (Bourbon Whisky) which was very strong and something I'd recommend. The rooftop venue is very pretty with swings and comfy sofas with candlelights on every table. The waiters were very well behaved. There's a foosball table too.

Well well well, where to start from. The place was heard off long back but it was April mid since I could pay a visit in the evening. The rooftop seating arrangement coupled with good food is a great way to celebrate food in kolkata. A typical lounge which has shades of all types of enjoyment. We ordered for the white sauce pasta and it was so yumm. The music being played was grooving. There's also a table football available. Overall a good place!

First of all I would like to make this clear that i have cut 0.5 rating for their managers at the ground floor.  They almost disrespected us and even asked us to leave but we wanted to visit the place so we insisted them to let us go. 

After this,  everything was a cake walk.  Beautiful ambience,  sitting on the roof top and having hookah with mouth watering appetisers along with the quality drink you want. 
All the items we ordered were good and satisfactory. 
Staffs were courteous and Mr.  Ranjan was very kind while serving us. This place surely made our night except the people on the reception,  at least they should have some courtesy and know the value of the place.

Been here couple of weeks back... A rooftop place on the top of the myx building in parkstreet. Not a very big place for big groups..but a good place to hangout with two three people and have a good conversation.  I ordered veg pizza which was good. Crispy baby corn was also quite good. The drinks are priced nominally but when I went they dint had the one I asked for.. So a bit disappointed and had to adjust with something else. Good breeze and overall nice place.

In search of some rooftop ambience?OTT is the place for such of your party mood cravings.The place is good and lovely ambience because everything that we find is under the sky and you are at the 6th floor of the Myx.what i had for the evening was pizza(Saporita),crispy chilly babycorn.I feel the Crispy chilly babycorn should have been better and served more hot and the corn should be felt a bit in mouth.Apart from that the pizza crust was good and tastes good too.Do try out the flavour saporita amongst all other rest pizzas. It literally tastes good!
Service was good and have enough in ur wallet for the evening .
Crispy chilly babycorn - Rs229.
Pizza(Saporita) - Rs 299

I went there on 11th April 2017 in the evening. Service is lousy. You have to keep on calling for someone to take the order. When we ordered for 2nd round of drinks & crispy fried sesame chicken, only the drinks were served. On asking after 20 minutes they said there was some problem with the oven so the chicken is taking time. Still we waited 5 minutes more. Even then when they couldn't deliver the chicken we asked them to cancel it. Still they asked for 2 minutes more. When they failed to deliver in 2 minutes we asked them to cancel the order & give the bill. We were surprised to see that they had billed us for the chicken that they didn't deliver. On asking they first told us to that they will parcel the chicken. We denied. Then they said that they can't make a fresh bill so they edited the printed bill with pen where they had only deducted the price of the dish and not the VAT, service tax & service charge.
On checking the bill further we saw that they had billed a bottle of drinking water (Kinley 500ml) as Rs. 49/- but it was not a special channel counter bottle. The mrp on the bottle was Rs. 10/-.
On enquiring they asked us to talk to the manager if the Myx. They couldn't explain to us and gave all rubbish excuses. There was a man who was talking in bengali in a rude manner although we maintained our decency.
Highly not recommended. They are thieves. If you are not careful be sure to get robbed.

Over the top.
Located on 6th floor 
It ws Actually over the top.
We managed to reach there by 11 pm üôà
We Could just enjoy for 1 hour as it was opened till 12AM.
Sad for us.
Ordered hooka beer wine along with nachos.
The staff was in a hurry to close the lounge as just a day before that they had issues with the police.
music was good .Cannot say regarding the food as we didn't try any food item as such.
The staff also felt sorry for the hurry.
But that's alright.it was a good time
Thankyou

Its a super fun place, the ambience is nice, music is good and they have a foosball table which is my favourite part about this place .
When it comes to food we had :
Nachos- pretty basic, one should skip it
Fries- they were served cold, was such a disappointment
crispy chilli babycorn - quite good
murg angar bedgi - loved it
crispy fried chicken - must try
Chicken pepperoni pizza- didn't like it atall, it just tasted weird
I loved their pasta, it was their best dish, must try

Their long island ice tea is quite good

Over all its a fun place not the best place if you are a foodie , you have many better options on park Street if you want amazing food but this place has a fun vibe

Been there couple of weeks back, just at the rooftop of the myx building, gives a nice feel during late evening. There is a live DJ playing cool tracks, crowd hits the place post 7pm. I ordered for jalapeno cheese poppers, corona, hookah. Food was tasty and the hookah was also perfect, only drawback would be that they don't change coal you have to order a new hookah. The service was prompt, I liked this place a lot among rooftop restaurants in Kolkata. 
One suggestion to the management would be checking of the upholstery and taking care of the furniture which are used for seating the guests.

I need to mention that after coming back from the rooftop pub culture of Hyderabad, I was really missing it in Kolkata. But I was in for a complete pleasant surprise when a friend took me to OTT, Over The Top. The ambience is amazing. Even on a weekday the party was on till 1 in the night, with the DJ spinning mind blowing tracks one after the other. The decor is very chic. The drinks were quite reasonably priced and so was the food. The risotto was fantastically fantabulous. Overall, amazingly awesome place. Would not just love to visit again myself but would recommend it to each and every person who's fond of good music, ambience and value for money. Kudos to the entire team!!!

The food is good, service is slow but my friends and I were there to catch up, so we didn't mind. However, when we were presented with the bill, we got the shock of the night. All beverages/ drinks were marked way higher (approximately 20%) more than the menu that we were shown while ordering. They‚Äã said that the rates have increased and yet they haven't updated their menus or even bothered to inform customers while taking orders. The total bill given to us was approx INR 5100, and after much ado,  the manager offered to reduce the amount by 400, while as per the rates on the menu, the bill should have been INR 4000. 
Besides, in violation of Supreme Court judgements, OTT continues to charge customers (I) much higher than the MRP rates for water and cold drinks, and (II) compulsorily imposes service charge of 5% without any sign board which informs customers of this additional cost.
Sitting in Park Street and fleecing customers cannot really count towards a good review! Dear Zomato readers, you've been warned!

Before OTT came about, I found it hard a place like this would actually work in Kolkata. Considering that it actually does good business means they're doing something right. However OTT isn't a place for everyone. The ambiance and view is great mind you. But the weather plays an even more important role. If it's too hot or humid, and all you want is a drink, places like Irish is way better. It goes without saying that a rooftop bar like OTT won't work during the rain. Coming to the food and the drinks, the menu is that of a typical finger food joint/lounge with hookah and drinks. The quantity they give is good, but the price charge is something that'll pinch, and is something off putting for regular visits. Not a fan of hookah myself, I won't judge the hookah here, but ultimately if you want to go to OTT for music, ambiance, view, drinks and some chill, this is the place to be (provided the weather is good). Else try another place.

Ordered a double apple shisha but it kept choking. They staff changed the coal twice. The music was a bit loud which made it very difficult to have a conversation. Overall it the place was ok and pocket friendly as well.

I will tell you this place doesn't serve regular water and they charges Rs. 49+ Tax of kinley 500ml which MRP - Rs. 10/-. Which is really disgusting.

Dinner seems better, when it‚Äôs served on a rooftop. You feel like you are on top of the world, as the cool breeze gently kisses your face, while you relish the delicious food on your plate. Sitting directly under the starlit sky, watching an unobstructed panoramic view‚Äì doesn‚Äôt that sound absolutely romantic? 

 OTT I think is one of those rooftop lounges where you should visit with your date for a romantic dinner. It's a dimly-lit rooftop lounge perfect for the romantic mood albeit the loud music. Well! The music did add a party mood to it. The sky enlarges the area and you will not feel cramped even if the lounge is full. 

As you know that menu serves more cocktails and mocktails and pitchers but adding to it the food items are equally lip smackingly yummy! 
Though a bit over priced but worth it. 

We had ordered penne pasta and risotto. The photos are uploaded. Must try the risotto, it was impeccable.

I am seriously praying to god that this place continuous for the next 5 years. The management has serious issues with people and crowd management. I went with a friend of mine on a Saturday eve. To be honest the place looks cool. Small cozy. The crowd is filled up college goars and people bunking tutions . We took a place to sit in a corner where there was "Jhula" hanging around. The waiters seems less cared of taking the order or greeting the guest. I had to get up and call the waiter and to my surprise the waiter said to get up as this place was reserved for someone at 5 o clock on a evening. Instead he recommended to take a place which is just in front of the giant speaker where the DJ was plying. I immediately came out from the place. This is so weird. ¬†I will never recommend someone to visit.

It is pretty rooftop bar with great music,beautiful cradles in the corner and candles on table.
The food items are a bit overpriced but the romantic ambience will surely make up for it.
We had a thin crust Saporita pizza,Sunriser mocktail and breezer.
The pizza tasted amazing with good proportion of chicken and mushroom.
The mocktail was nice too. üòä

Visited this place on the 31st evening! The place-OTT-Over the Top really acted correctly as of its name! As I entered into the rooftop, what captivated me was the excellent collection of music that the dj was playing! The cozy atmosphere was another reason to attract me to this place!
We ordered for six bottles of Carlsberg which were pretty chilled but they served us with the 330ml ones instead of the 600mls and when asked the reason, they informed that they had only 330ml bottles to offer us but they didn't charge less for that! Then we ordered for grilled chicken wrap which looked very much inviting and tasted delicious too. 
Overall the place is quite descent.

OTT is situated on the roof of Myx and is an open air/rooftop lounge. I went here with my friends on Christmas. At first the management was unwilling to give a place for 7 people. But after a bit of convincing we took the elevator and entered the lounge. The ambience is pretty good I must say,especially if their is a slightly cool breeze blowing. The seats look comfortable and their is a small fountain which is eye catching. The music is not very loud and the DJ was spinning good tracks. We ordered a Double Apple hookah, some Old Monk and Coke, and a Pitcher of Beer. I just puffed on the hookah. The flavour was good and I liked blowing out the smoke under the open sky with a little breeze taking the smoke away from my face. The lounge was packed but there was no commotion. Service I am glad to say, wasn't lagging. The prices are reasonable keeping in mind the location and structure of the lounge itself. Overall I would say it's a pretty good place to hangout with friends. My Christmas evening sure went well here :-)

been there last evening , the rooftop area is small one can accomodate some approximately 20 pax with seating options available as high tables for three and low tables for four and a couple of bird nest chairs all done in white. For people to chill in windy winter evenings , over some smoke or hookah , bar food and hard drinks this is the spot! the music is loud , dj playing nice english numbers and the attached washroom facility is a bonus. We ordered draught beer pitcher , six large bacardi , lime cordial and a pizza SPICY INDIAN KEEMA which was cheese loaded thin crust just the way we wanted.

Now the negetives , service needs improvement , it was difficult to get attention of any of them in that loud music ,
and secondly many basic options among drinks were not available , like smirnoff , tequilla sauza , in case one wants vodka , he has to pay unnecessarily for grey goose , therefore the bar needs to be well stocked.
The second visit we tried chicken tikka pizza , peri peri chicken , mix sauce pasta , red sauce pasta (very spicy preparation) , chicken caesar salad , chicken kebab , royal pan hookah along with pints of beer , the food was awesome , but took a lot of time to get served. Again, unavailability of draught and some liquor brands was an issue. The birthday cake which we bought here was instantly made and was one of the tastiest and most fresh chocolate cake i had ever.

Lastly,Good servicing and  Well maintained!

The place has a nice feel about things to be honest but the serving and waiters let us a bit down to be honest. The baby corn was good and the beers and the towers made up for one good outing.

I went there along with my friends. It is on the top MYX . The food over there food but cheap as compared to the places in the area. The shisha is also cheap. And the view in the evening is magnificent along with the weather . But the there are some problems over there such as the service over there is very slow and you need to tell them at least twice in order to get it . And the another thing is they do not change the coal. That the along thing I think they should start doing is start changing the coal of the shisha.

An ideal hangout joint for the younger stars who want to have a low budget pub. Amazing ambience. Open air with a funky touch in its furniture. I loved the foosball part. They had a foosball table n I tried a hand their. All was fun only a few OTT people whom i found very inappropriate. Food taste was good. Cocktail was so so but I loved the tequila. Overall they impressed my taste buds wonderfully.

Location right near KFC in park street.
This is located at the top floor of MYX. 
Ambience-open air with club type seating,super music. Good people. Obedient staff. 
Food was so yum. We tried pizza, babycorn, quesadilla,pasta.
Everything was gud. We were around 8 ppl.
We had a gr8 time. The music made the party even better. Hookah was brilliant. We tried vanilaa

I will surely visit this place soon in the upcoming winters. The chill in the air n the hookah smoke will b a brilliant combo. Must visit with friends. Thumbs up to this one. 
PS - quite affordable too.

My special mention would be of two things- the rooftop atmosphere ..and that of the quuenly huge white back low seats- Simply Sexy. Wish to visit it again and soon.

One of the worst and over hyped rooftop place in Kolkata. Called for a Sheesha but does not change the coal either even when the customer is ready to pay for the same. There is no place where coal is not changed if they are serving hookah. Called for a pink sauce pasta. Believe me guys it was one of the worst pasta I ever had.

Do not enter this place if you are a foodie person. But no doubt the ambiance was good.

Paid a visit to this place on a Sunday evening over dinner wd a frnd..
I was fascinated by d name n just wd d sheer fact dat it was an open air rooftop lounge..
Whn we entered around 7,all d tables were almost occupied with couples or groups..
All tables had candles inside d lantern base  basically good fr a candle light dinner but wud expect d candles to b a big bigger so dat they cn b a bit more brighter..
D ambience was nice..Nothing out of d box but definitely good fr a romantic candlelight dinner wd good music.. 
We were placed at a corner table for 2.. D chairs were nice n comfortable nut dats abt it.
D story starts getting negetive frm here.
For d first 20 mins,Noone was dere to attend us even after we cud see 4-5 waiters roaming around. Even after calling out fr dem multiple tyms.dey just cudnt hear to pay attention to wat we had to say.
Gtn irritated my frnd walked up to d manager asking him if v shud leave or smone wud attend us..
D manager was courteous enough to apologize n send a guy to attend us.
We ordered fr a hookah, 2 pints of beer,n starters(crispy sesame chicken fingers) 
It took a good 20 mins fr dem to come out wd d ordered things but to our relief d hookah was good, den v noticed Dr was no sauce or Kethup along wd d crisp fr which we askd fr sweet chili red sauce and fr Nxt 20 mins had to just wait to ask smone to Gt it on d table and by den d food was cold..insted of d sauce d guy got tomato ketchup, aftr informing him dat we had askd fr d othr one, he apologized n came bk wd d sauce instantly.. 
Food was cold like hell but tasted good..
Later we ordered fr another beer and pasta and kebab platter and fr dessert ordered chocolate brownie wd icecream and cheesecake wd gulabjamun..I wanted to have a panacotta but it was unavailable.. 

Anywyas regarding,taste quality and quantity cnt complain bkoz it was great fr which m scoring 3.. 

D worst was whn d bill came which was preety reasonable 2930rs fr 2 of us,
We gave our card fr payment.
Swiped Gt declined and later had to go dwn to withdraw d amt..
Later to realise dat d swiping amt was already debited frm d account. 
Anyhews whn we confronted dem wd d same,d indifferent behavior ws disappointing... 
All in all an ok nothing special place..food z d onky good thng along wd ambience.
Management needs to b really trained well as d take it easy attitude of dem can b harmful fr d business. 

üçª cheers üçª

A perfect place to enjoy hookah over few drinks and the place is not even extravagant. Total value for money.

OTT is a fancy little rooftop cafe in the myx building in Park street. This place is nothing too extravagant.  The place is done up in a cosy and comfortable manner with chairs and small cosy swings. It is a good place for spending some time over hookah. There is a very limited options for alcohol. We had orderded LIT pitcher,which was prepared perfectly. The servers are disorganised and not helpful at all. Care should be taken regarding the hospitality of this place.:)

OTT- Over the Top. The name of the lounge may get you to think something overly extravagant, but in reality it is a fancy looking roof-top place with excellent food and shisha; and a price range that is fairly normal for places of this category.

This place is located a minute away from KFC, Park Street and is on the sixth floor of Myx.

While the staff team is extremely slow, it should be pointed out that the food won't disappoint you. I personally loved their Crispy Chilli Babycorn so much that I remember ordering it twice. The quantity is more than satisfying. Plus when you're done with your tasty babycorns, you'd be left with a well-cooked pastry basket underneath, which always is a bonus. I'd rate this place a four because of its food and definitely the ambiance. However, the authority concerned immediately needs to look into the service pace of this place.

Bad bad bad place!! I'll tell you why but before that, I'll tell you the good points first.
- nice ambiance. 
- hookah was pretty good.

NEGATIVE PART:
- i ordered a chocolate shake. And guess what? The milk was SPOILT. It became very thick and i, being a culinary student, knows how a chocolate shake should be. What if i get diarrhea? What if i get food poisoning? What if i fall sick badly? Will OTT take responsibility? After complaining, he told me to choose anything from mocktails. I asked him which one is good, he recommended me SUNRISE. That one tasted like shit too. Its like, orange juice with black pepper/jal jeera on top. Did i like it? Not at all.
- my friend ordered a long island ice tea and it does not taste strong at all. Apparently this is the only cocktail that is supposed to be strong but it was so so so mild. My friend went to the bar counter and told to make it stronger. The lady at the bar did. Was it stong enough? Enough to make it taste like long Island ice tea? Nope. Total disappointment.
- repeatative songs over and over again.
- slow service
- while coming down, the elevator broke down and we were stranded on the 4th floor for about 1min with "out of service" sign. Was i freaked out? Absolutely. We had to call for help/emergency.

Would we go back here? Not at all. Bad experience.

Small but cosy and you get your privacy! Although its a rooftop lounge but you wont get any view. Service is not good. They take plenty of time to bring your order. Food was good but very limited menu. Alcohol price is reasonable. Hookah was okay but you don't enjoy much if you had to sit under table fan. And if you don't sit under table fan than you tend to feel hot. So, this place is good during pleasant weather only not on summer days.But good place if you want to enjoy hookah nd drinks! Few place inpark street have that option.

Hit this place today with my friends after hearing a lot about it. This lounge opens at 4pm so if you are planning to go to this place for a hangout or whatsoever then plan it a bit late in the afternoon. It is situated at the top most floor (terrace) of the myx building as per as the name 'over the top'. Loved the ambiance but nothing much special to mention about this rooftop lounge. They do offer board games as well. Coming to drinks and food we had beer, scotch, rum, tequila with chicken pizza and crispy chilli baby corn. Looked for draught beer but that wasn't available unfortunately. Pizza was really good but crispy chilli baby corn was the worst. You should never ever order crispy chilli baby corn here. There was only the coating which was crispy and the baby corn couldn't be felt by anyone of us. They do play good music. It's a bit costly place. Service was good.

LOCATION:

Situated right off park street on the lane leading to Loreto House School. For the ignorant, its right opposite Peter Cat restaurant.

OVERVIEW & INTERIORS:

Over The Top is the terrace lounge situated in a building full of restaurants including a night club by the name of Myx. Its medium sized and can accommodate at most 60-70 people at a time. Interiors are ok. The place is done in white with a green turf mat covering the floor which gives you the impression of grass. The place is reasonably well decorated and and well ventilated by effective wall mounted fans which made our experience more comfortable than it would have otherwise been.

WINE & DINE:

We ordered for Falafel Pockets, drinks and hookah. Not much to eat from the menu but enough of an experience I thought to review the place.

The Falafel pockets were nice. The falafels themselves were well cooked and the hummus served with them was really tasty. I Liked the pita bread as well which was very soft and fresh.

The Hookah was average. I don think they did a very good job off making the same. Drinks were usual. Nothing to complain about but we would have appreciated some sort of nuts or crisps with the same especially since we were five of us and ordered 3 rounds of drinks each.

FEEDBACK FOR IMPROVEMENT:

With decent food and a decent environment, this place still scored so low. The reason was the service we received. Access to the place is through a ground floor elevator with bouncers standing at the entrance. At first we were told "The place is full" followed by stags are not allowed. When we actually got upstairs, the place was half empty with 4 out of the 6 occupied tables seating stags.

I was a little confused with the kind of entry we got. It was almost like they were doing us a favor by letting us in. In such a competitive market, I don't know how you would turn down a good table of 5 when your lounge is half empty especially on a Wednesday night.

Service needs to be looked into and improved massively.

VERDICT:

Its a decent place suffering from a superiority complex !

This place is really very over hyped I must say. I don't know why people had given such high ratings. I guess now a days there are no actual foodies as such, they just need a selfie friendly ambience and that's the most satisfying thing for them. I would recommend all to please give ratings and reviews based on food quality. The food didn't taste worth its price. The hookah was also the weirdest hookah I've ever tried. And the juice they serve was also bad, mango juice just tasted like water mixed with slice or mazaa...and cranberry juice tasted like rooh afza or something. Service was too slow and this place was a huge disappointment. Please improve on your hospitality along with the food. Just good interiors won't work for long.

Was roaming around park street looking for a dim lighted place to booze and relax.. Found this in zomato.. walked in.. and it was PERFECT! if I must say, dusk is the best time to visit this place. Service is good.. Food was amazing.. and they have a long list of shisha flavours which is a plus point for people like me :)
only con of this place is it is a little cramped! you have to bother the person sitting next to you in order to hit the washroom! 
A 'perfectly located romatic rooftop launge' is what explains it best! me likey!

If you ask me, this place gives the feel of a joint more for a date and less for buddies gathering around for weekend beer....this place does have class....

Have visited this place a few times and just somehow a review escaped my mind. The rooftop open place is a really cool ambience although I like the street view of the outlets down below....for the awesome location that it is in, the street itself is the missing link...

- Food....just tad bit above avg, a 3.5/5
- Drinks....way priced, if I am looking for easy_on_the_pocket_weekend....down below across the street is my place, a 3/5
- Ambience, the windy rooftop deserves a 4/5
- Overall, a 3.5/5

Having said that, I would still prefer coming here....

Nice place to visit in the evenings. Though gets filled up pretty fast considering that it's not that spacious.

Visited around sunset time. Rooftops makes things better. Food wasn't bad. Ambience was good. Good place to chill with friends over alcohol. The only problem was that there were too many lizards on the glass panes. Other than that it's good.
Food -3.5/5
Ambience -4/5
Staff - Kind of slow service. Took 20 minutes to get beer pitchers and took time for the others too.

A very nice rooftop place, with those little lamps on the table. We ordered a veg platter and few mocktails. Food was decent. Service was also near about decent.

OTT : Over The Top, an rooftop restaurant cum pub ... truly defines itself very clearly ....  it is truly overrated and over hyped !!¬†
Coming here with the expectation of being served in a hospitable manner and that thinking that you can have a great time with your loved ones or family or friends, will come crashing down....  you shall  reach the ultimate depths of disappointment just like an abyss of a galaxy !

We were seven friends on Sunday, 10.07.2016 below is our experience at the OTT.¬†
When we walked in to OTT, the weather was nice and by the time we sat, it was a slight drizzle and we kinda liked it.¬†
Around 9.30, we ordered for food, drinks, and shisha's. By the the time Drinks and Shisha's were served the drizzle turned into rain and we were asked to move to 4th floor. But before moving down, we were asked to clear our bill. Which we did in good faith as we were promised our complete order would be transferred to the 4th floor table. Once we reached the 4th floor, and got seated, we waited for more than 20 mins for
a) A Glass of Water - Literally ONE single was served between 7 people !!
b) Platter served was absolutely cold and tasteless.¬†
c) Pasta served was also cold and we had to ask them to reheat and bring it to us as it was uneatable
d) Upon several and repetitive requests, 3-4 glasses of water was brought for 7 people
e) The Shisha we had ordered for, was nowhere near us and was never bought to us from the above floor, where he had ordered. When asked, they said, the time for shisha is over and the rains have stopped you can upstairs to order for more. Also, it was added to us that we can take shisha for only 30 minutes and not more. But then why were we told to move downstairs and everything on our table would be moved to the below floor???¬†
f) When we protested, OTT floor manager / staff told that you can talk to the manager who is available downstairs.¬†
g) When we went to the Manager, Mr. Abhijeet, we exchanged heated arguments and finally we were told that they would be returning our billed amount. It was as if, he was like doing us a favour by returning our money and that without the billed amount being returned to us, we would be very poor. I was told in particular to keep quite when I gave him a instant feedback on the sham service being offered upstairs. lf Forget about the staff, the Manager himself needs to learn to be courteous first. ¬†
If Mr. Abhijeet, thinks by returning the billed amount to a customer, he can justify the poor service standards, I am sure, he is living in a fools world !! We pay for service and hospitality and to unwind ourselves and not to be treated like the way we have been here !

I am truly in shock myself as to see, how has this place survived to keep itself open for such a long time even after such degraded service where food items are overpriced, quantity served is also dismissive,  and the food is very ordinary; Add to it:  View isn't great at all. ¬†¬†

This would be one of the places in Kolkata, I shall never recommend to anyone !

The perfectly located Roof top lounge at the prime location of Park street,to be precise it's just beside the KFC outlet at Myx Building. OTT- Over The Top is one of the best hangout spot for the young crowd especially on the evening..the view gets the brownie point. 

They're Shisha is some one should try.. 
Finger foods are just as amazing as their Shisha. 
Great ambiance.. Amazing crowd.. Just perfect for chilling with friends over beer and enjoying the cool breeze of the city. 

Service is top notch and very professional.

But pricing is bit on a higher side. 
Although it's a good deal.. What can anyone expect.. As OTT is one of the top lounges of this town. 
I adore this place - kudos

A roof top lounge in the city!!!
Visited this lounge for the first time today evening. The ambience is just amazing. This lounge is situated in parkstreet right next to the kfc outlet in the myx building. The skyline view from this place is picturesque.
It's a cozy little place to chill if you are a sheesha lover. They have cocktails and mocktails to go with it. The have cozy couches and swings in the sitting area. We ordered for 2 cocktails(ice tea pot and cosmopolitan ) n 2 mocktails(spicy sunshine orange and a coffee based one) and a baked mushroom platter. We were awestruck by the presentation of the food. Unfortunately they didn't taste well. I had better cocktails at other places. Coming to the food, it was very less in quality and a little blunt. We didn't have time to order for sheesha. I would love to go back to this place to enjoy the ambience and try some sheesha as i missed this time. Fyi.... the time we were there....they played no music which made the place a bit dull.

The myx building has one problem in common. They are all expensive and out of options in their menu. This was such a great place. Perfect ambience. Seating. Food quality was good even. But cause of less options you always end up unsatisfied. This place has the same problem.

Me and my friends call this place our living room ;) this place is best for its flavoured hookahs and beer. If u enjoy drinking on Fridays or when u r out with friends u ought to try this lounge. It has an awesome ambiance and u get to hear DJ playing ur favourite numbers. u can also try pasta and pizzas but I prefer beer with crispy chicken and red apple hookah.

Okay, so finally am writing this review. Phew! It has been now almost two months when I had visited this place with my gang of friend on a weekend. Trust me we had a gala time. 
We drove to the place in one of our friend's car, and also the place is easily locatable. It is on the rooftop of the Myx in Park Street area, nearby Loreto House, so not at all a difficulty to find.
The ambience of the place, being a rooftop open restaurant was awesome and pleasing to the youngsters like us. The decor is lovely, completely gives the feeling of a rooftop hangout place. There is artificial grass on the floor adding to the feel, an artificially made small waterfall in one corner, a large LCD for live sports or music screening, the bar and the serving area, and the rest of the place is for seating arrangements. There were glass top-covered tables with white colored wooden chairs or rather stools to sit. Also there were few hanging swings at intervals which were also a lovely place to sit and chat and eat.
The waiters were helpful and courteous. The menu was given to us as soon as we settled ourselves. As it was a weekend, there was some rush.
Now coming to the food and drinks that we had ordered, drinks were ordered first. We ordered both mocktails and cocktails and green teas for all of us, namely Basil Iced Tea, Sunny Fizz and Peach & U among mocktails, a Fresh Lime Soda and Long Island Iced Tea and some other drink (i m forgetting the name) among cocktails. Few of my friends had also ordered a hookah. Among food items, we had ordered a Mezz platter, Cilantro Chicken Wrap, a dish of chicken saucages (again am forgetting the particular name), and a Quesadilla. 
The mocktails were all amazing in taste, keeping up the promise of refreshing. Each of them retained their particular flavours thereby each tasting unique on its own. 
The food items were all decent enough. Nothing wow about the food. I did not find any such special touch in the dishes. However, they were all pretty good in taste and flavour. 
Me and my friends had a gala time gossiping, having fun, hovering on food and drinks, clicking a lot of pictures and a bunch of selfies. 
The price of all items are naturally little on the higher side, and nevertheless the taxes levied upon them makes them go up on the hike race even more.
I would definitely consider this place when I have my friends' gang and we are to just to chill out in the lovely ambience in a pleasant late evening. üòä

After a lot of huzz and fuzz I finally made it to this place..easy to locate and not a bad place to hangout.. Not that expensive or that cheap either.. Value of money just one thing that bothered me was the loud music u can Hardly talk and wen we asked to turn it down a little they said not possible.. We ordered the pepperoni pizza which was really awesome then we had two pitcher for margaritas and pasta in White sauce and tacos.. Which was good as well but the Pizza was  really awesome.. It's a must try.Over all the place is good but not sure I will go back again. It's the loudness of the music that really bothered me..

Simply loved the ambience at this place!! The rooftop, open air, the little lamps at our tables, the beautifully lit fountain, the cane chairs, the outdoor swing seats- all these sums up to a perfect laid-back evening with drinks in company of friends. We ordered crispy fried sesame chicken, and chicken pepperoni pizza along with several pints of beer- heineken and long island iced tea. Service was commendable but their food menu is too limited and the music ranged from some good tracks to really disagreeable ones (they need a better dj)!! But all in all, it was a great evening and hoping to visit sometime again!

Totally a great place to spend some quality time with your favourite people. It is located above Myx on the rooftop. Being in park street area this is one of the pocket friendly cafe. The shisha here costs only rs199 but the only con is no 'coal change' which we found very unusual. The drinks here are of very reasonable rates. Other than that they dont have that large varieties of food stuff compared to orher cafes. A good place to enjoy a breezy and cloudy day in summer time.....

Located at Park Street, this place is situated at the roof top of the building beside the KFC outlet. Due to its outdoor seating arrangement, this place is a wonderful choice to hangout in the evening. The space becomes a little cluttered when there's a moderate crowd present. The sisha is reasonable here which makes this place a popular choice amongst the youth. I had tried the baby corn from the food menu which tasted good and and reasonably priced as well. The incredibly pretty lights in the center of the table makes it a beautiful sight. (As poets would say, makes your face glow with excruciating radiance? LOL) Recently, I went to this place on a summer evening (mistake I know) however the windy climate later in the day made up for it. Sipping corona.. watching the line of tall, well lit buildings at a distance and feeling the breeze in your hair... it was a good evening. However prior to getting the table my friend had a heated exchange of words with one of the waiters who was extremely rude to him for no reason. I wish the management keeps a tab of the behavior of its staff with the customers. Otherwise this place is really cool. üòä

Great location, lovely food and nice ambience that is completely let down by the staffs that don't really seem to know what they are doing. You can see they are aspiring for a high quality nightlife experience, but because of the behaviors of some of the staffs they are not quite really hitting the mark.¬†
Loved the tacos, pizza and hookah it was superb. :)

Feel free to check it out for yourself. This place is the best if you are expecting high quality grub.
I'm sure with decent and well mannered staffs this place could be more excellent.

A delightful little rooftop lounge. A nice place to chill, with your chumps  and better half.  The music is generic but groovy. The place and ambiance is inviting. Hookah and alcohol their specialty. 
What I don't get is why would one go to a open air hookah bar, on the 6th floor, that too without a coal change. But anyway a decent place to check out. The mojito was good.

a small open air place located on top of MYX night club has got probably everything right, except the ATTITUDE.¬†
Firstly when i entered, the bouncer stopped us from going up saying its full. We had friends waiting so we asked him to let us go. The place had atleast 4 different tables empty so didn't quiet understand why the bouncer was acting smart. You have to call the waiter atleast 4 times if you want one thing. The hookah wasn't very great and after repeatedly complaining, nothing was done. The food was nice but then the service and attitude was a total turn off.

This is a brilliant place with a nice ambience. If you have a supportive weather and good company, you're sure to have a great time. Their food is at par as well, nothing extraordinary, but completely satisfactory. The only complaint I have with the place is the fact that they insisted us to increase the number of hookahs we ordered. We were 7 people, and since everybody wasn't particularly interested, we ordered one hookah. The waiter then told us that we must order a minimum of two. I could see no logic behind this regulation. Also, they were out of a lot of alcohol. We had to change 2-3 orders before they could actually serve us something. Despite these tiny drawbacks, I feel that this place is a must visit if you're looking for having a good time.

Roof top of myx located near park street KFC.. This place is good to visit at a pleasant weather. The dj rocks all the time here. Talking about the food its mesmerizing. The hookah here is cheap @200 but there is no coal change facilities.. The fans are annoying though which can't be turned off.. Not much of a sitting space it has so if you are not early you may have to wait for it but the wait will be woth it.. All and all a good place to hangout with friends and at the same time for a romantic evening.

Went on Saturday evening and was Lucky to get a place! The ambiance is pretty nice! We had crispy fried sesame chicken and pizza! Both were fine! Wish the option for dips were a bit more with the chicken. the pizza was really good thin crust just the way I like!We had shots, cocktail and scotch. They need to work on the options for Scotch. Not many were there available although was on the menu!
I hated the too loud music! The DJ needs to understand it is not a disc!But extra points for the good Service! The staff were really very helpful!¬†Will definitely love to visit again provided they play some good music this time!

The ambience was okay and i loved the dj.. Some cool beats. We had 3 beers along with crispy babycorn and some mughlai chicken dish(name forgot). The babycorn was too crispy and chicken tasted too salty. Even the servicing was not good. After finishing we called a waiter to bring the bill but he was too busy..overall not so good experience

My friend recommended this place. On a Friday evening I decided to visit this place. To be honest I am in love with this place. For a moment you tend to forget that you are in the middle of park street as you will be completely taken away by the ambience. Well decorated rooftop with fairly priced alcohol. We mostly had draught beer and a couple of cocktails. The Long Island Iced Tea was good. May be not the best of the town but still good enough. 
Im food we ordered finger chips and crispy fried chicken. The food was good as well. But the ambience takes it all.
The service is little slow but you get to enjoy the cool breeze blowing so no complains :)

This place is nice ONLY for the view & that is it.
It's on the rooftop as the name says.
But Gosh the management is badd. The service is too slow. Some of the staffs are uneducated and definitely NOT fit for the job they are getting paid for.
The dj played pathetic songs yesterday(9th of may),For the record taste in music is very important.
Summing it up.
Food-4 (excellent tacos and risotto, the french fries were okay)
Ambience-4
Service-2
Music-2
Drinks- they hardly had ANYTHING that was on the menu,put the blame on the excise duty. Like seriously if you can't serve what's on the menu make sure to apologise and make sure this doesn't happen ever.
The food menu is also limited
Never coming back .

Veryyy important point: NO NORMAL WATER AVAILABLE. ONLY MINERAL WATER.

Hookah and cocktails both were amazing and very reasonable priced !! 

But the good part ends there. The food is horrible. Ordered crispy chilli mushrooms. It was very sweet. The mezze  player was average. The pizza was undercooked and the pasta was again over cooked soggy and very sweet 

This place is best if you want to have a drink and hookah in open. Don't order anything to eat

Rooftop! Loved it! It was an awesome experience, I must say. It was a friends' get together and we went there at around 4 o' clock; and they were pretty much astonished when we chose to sit at the rooftop at that time. You must watch the lights over there once it's evening. And, the music; perfect!
Coming to the point of foods and drink, nothing special about that, foods were okayish. If not anything else, would recommend to go at least once, to have a rooftop experience surrounded by perfect combo of lights and music.

It is located on the 6th floor of Myx, near KFC in mark street. Its a roof top restaurant. I found this place good, the decor and ambience is nice. We ordered a variety of food and drinks, all of which were upto the park. The sheesha here is okay, not that great. The price of Sheesha here is low compared to other cafe's and also there is no coal change. The place is only suitable for evening visits. Also this place gets crowded very fast so you will most probably have to wait for some time before getting a table.

I can sum this place up for you in just a couple words_ pretentious , overpriced along with shit service. 
We made the blunder of choosing ott as the birthday venue for a very dear friend and ended up leaving the place mad.
Let's start with the fact that the whole place has only two menus. Yes you read it right , 2 menus. 

The drinks were made of water and juice. I am a thorough wine lover. I have had sangria at almost every place in Kolkata and what they served me was not it.  I told them how it tastes nothing of wine and they apparently changed and gave me another one. No difference. 
Same happened to the pitcher of mojito my poor friends had to wash down because they refused to change it. 
Next came the second pitcher of beer , which was a whole glass less than the first one. Now that is a deal breaker and should never happen at any bar. 
The worst part is they seemed least but apologetic.
I'd like people to call me a dumb for the rest of my life if I am seen going there ever again.

Amazing place, with an amazing ambience. This is a place for a must visit. It is probably the best place in town, in terms of chilling. Food here is amazing and so are the variety of drinks. In terms of hookah, the smoke is outstanding but the only problem here is that there's no coal change as the hookah is cheap here as compared to other places in town. Overall, amazing place to chill out with friends.

Been there with my oldest companion on a Sunday evening. This is a rooftop place serving some remarkably good Hookah and a huge variety of cocktails and drinks. The place is small but skillfully done with chairs & couches. There is a small lantern placed at each table which intensifies the ambience.

We ordered pin-paan hookah & few hard drinks. We also had pizza which pretty tasted pretty authentic.

However, the music was too loud and the house-DJ was not up to the mark, which I feel was a big turn-off.

This is one of the most over hyped places in kolkata. PATHETIC SERVICE AND WORST STAFF.
I went here with my friends. We were 4 boys and 2 girls. The bouncer down stairs stopped us saying that you are not in couple combination and we dont allow stags. I was so pissed off but my friends wanted to be there. And then he said that their are no seats available. After waiting for half and hour and contacting some person we were allowed to enter. When we reached the rooftop hardly 2 or 3 tables were occupied. This is the hospitality they provide. 

The worst hookah was served to us i guess. And on top of that their was a leak in the pipe. Even after complaining about it 3 to 4 times they were not changing it. We all got pissed off and asked for our check and went out of there.
The only reason i gave 1.5 is because of the ambiance. 
My suggestion : Never go to this place.

in the same building as myx lounge and aaira. The building is in park street right across the road from Peter cat. As the name says, this is a rooftop place serving some really good shisha and a huge variety of cocktails and drinks. I had Jamesons( in a competition with a friend :P), Long island iced tea and shisha there. Really liked all of them. Must visit place for party lovers.quite a dating destination as well. Of course, every place is enjoyable with friends. :)

I have been to this place a few times, and have seen the depreciation in the quality of food and the courtesy of staff! 
After ordering food, we had to wait for about 55 minutes. The staff seemed confused and reluctant to come and even inform us why they were late. The food was okayish, or rather a point below average. The music was not good and lively to the place it is!
Highly dissapointed and I hope they improve there sevices!

A tinne tiny place to hang out wid ur frndz
Ambiance is fairly good
Staff members r not that cooperative
Asked them to change our seats a thousand of times.. Even though the place was getting empty they we not letting us change the seats
V wanted to change since the fan was directly pointed over our hookah stand and not much smoke was coming out
The menu card seems to be years and years old half torned
They dont even give a damn to their maintenance part
Dont think they even want to grow their business

Even they dont have the option for changing hookah coals....


Will i come again or not- well a big NO to that.. Maybe ill go for other rooftop hookah lounges but not here

I heard a lot about this place so I decided to visit it one day and I wasn't impressed. It's lively and open air which are it's plus points, and is generally crowded in the evenings. I had ordered a Watermelon Mojito and it tasted very very artificial. And it's a little cram - jam too given there are a lot of tables and a little space. They have a good options for Hookah base but I personally can't stand the smell of hookah so if that is an issue for anyone they should stay away.

The best part is it is on roof top and you can enjoy cool breeze if the weather is cool. Not too spacious. Seating arrangement is very close. As it was about to rain we were asked to shift to the mezzanine floor which do not have proper seating. Felt bit suffocated. Ac was not balanced. Lastly we were wrongly billed which was rectified on being pointed out by us. Not a preference for next time visit.

Very average experience of the place. Roof top places are very limited when it comes to kolkata so we tried exploring the place. It's quite small set up in roof top. Very closely placed seating is done in various tables. The water water is the best thing on the roof top. 

The mezzanine floor is very incomplete. Seating arrangements not yet in place. Music not very nice. Ac temp not balanced. Very suffocated place. 

Slow service n staff. Not to be visited again. No pull from its end.

Heard much about this place and came back with dissapointment. The service was awful in one word. Most of the things are not available and they don't even bother to tell you when the order is placed. When we repeatedly asked for it they denied having taken that order. Service was equally slow. This place is too overhyped.Price is affordable though. Ambience and inhouse music were the only things to be liked here.

I wish I had the option of minus rating for this place... I had one of my worst restaurant experiences here. NOTHING that I asked for from the menu was available. The waiters were extremely rude and manner less. They kept on arguing with the customers. They had an attitude of 'doing a great favour' by serving their customers. I would never recommend this place to anybody.¬†

P.S.:- Having just a good ambience in a restaurant/cafe doesn't solve all the purpose. Hospitality should also be kept in mind.

A very good friend of mine took me here. The place is lovely...all of it..the ambience,the music, the crowd and everything. We ordered two hookahs and one crispy chilly baby corn. The problem I had was selecting hookah flavours as there were hardly any options. The food and hookah were quickly served and the price was affordable. Would suggest you guys to increase the flavour options bring in something unique. Apart for that I'm definitely visiting again. Cheers!!

The waiters would disturb every 15 mins asking to place another order..... Shit u are a brand and ths is how u treat ur customers... We had placed an order fr 1200 even after that the waiter kept coming n asked us to place another order... Frustated we left... 
Mend ur ways if u want to stand out becoz there are many more options in Calcutta... Nd around park Street... Nd ths is the review I had received from many other people who have visited OTT

Well its my first time here at OTT. 
Nice place is the first thing on your mind as you enter. Foot tapping music adds to the rooftop themed cafe. 
But I am little disappointed with the service as it was very slow. 
We ordered crispy chilli baby corn which wasn't crispy at all.. Next thing we ordered nachos platter, even nachos were very soggy. We tried to replace that with pizza after compalining but to my surprise they can't due to "rules". 
Furthermore I was delighted that sheesha costed mere rs200 but that also with conditions, that you can't change coal, you have to order again a new one to have a good puff .... 
Conclusion: just a good cozy place with good music. Dont expect much.

Being from Kolkata , I was fairly excited to know about a rooftop lounge in Park Street after all this time . However i was more than disappointed. Albeit the small area ¬†which calls for a 20-30 minutes waiting period ,there were 5 of us in single high table. I would say the food was good and so was the hookah , However from the sangria pitcher to cocktails , everything was beyond diluted , might have ordered fruit juices and felt better about it. The shots were ,fair. I left with a considerably lighter wallet (expected) and lower spirits(NOT expected). They need to standardize. Will not visit again.

You can drink, have hookah, try out new items...

But the place is really small
And very less staff to manage... We kept trying to reach to the attender but they're really stuffed with other table. Probably the only reason my rating fell down... Otherwise this place deserve more than 4

We'd pizza it was thin crust and was decent 
Had a couple of hookah and ordered beers.
Tried tacos .. It was good...
Baby corn was just average

Unfortunately they've drought beer on menu but wasn't available... Sad part...

Over the top , has a beautiful setting; right under the sky. But space is limited. When we went it was cramped up and uncomfortable. The service was slow and we had to keep reminding the waiters for our orders. We had jalape√±o cheese poppers and they were good. And we took four rounds of tequila shots and a whisky shot. Liit and mojito were good. The ambience at this place is okay. Hookah is good too. The prices are okay too.

My cousins and I had stopped by OTT to wait till it was time to leave for a movie show. It was quite enjoyable to sit in the open in the cool weather.
But the quality of the drinks and the service was very bad. My Guava Mary wasn't spicy as it always should be. Also we ordered for some french fries which took them a hour and a half to prepare. When it arrived at our table it was cold and it was obvious that it wasn't fresh. Moreover we had already finished with our drinks. We sent it back and we were made to wait for a long time to get fresh fries. We decided to leave and asked for the cheque at the reception. Our server was rude to us and despite us telling him to cancel our fries he went and placed the order on the table. We complained about this and the manager came and sorted the matter out. A very bad experience for us.

Its the rooftop place at Myx. At Reception we had to keep our bags before entering this place as they dont allow any belongings. The place is good and well organised. In drink there is no happy hours at this venue and the beer we wanted was out of stock, Beer Tower & Pitcher were also unavailable so we took Carlsberg Beer followed by Teacher's whiskey on the rocks. In hookah we had ordered Pan Masala which was good and smooth but they don't change the coal. In food we had Chicken Grilled Sandwich which consisted of few french fries, 2 quarter pieces of sandwich and little green salad but quantity wise its less. Smoking is allowed and they also provide astrays on request and availabilty. Overall not a great experience.

This is the place where I was planning to go for last few weeks and finally I managed to visit OTT- it's in the 6th floor of Myx, park street(just beside KFC). ambience is really awesome and perfect for a romantic nightout-but the management needs to look after the lounge's seating arrangement- it needs to be more spacious. The staffs were very courteous.. regarding food- we had quesadilla, crispy fried sesame chicken and crispy chilly babycorn. while the sesame chicken and baby corn was quite good- but the quesadilla was really aweful!! however, the overall experience is really good..worth for a single visit

This place was packed on a Tuesday evening says a lot about the kind of fan following it has gathered since it has opened. Apart from being a roof top, the menu is easy on the pocket.¬†

The one issue that we faced was it did not have any premium beer available though they had those neon advertisements for Stella Artois & Hoegaarden.

It's a small roof but the seatings have been done keeping in mind privacy for patrons.

The place is nicely done with white chairs and tables and swings.. I personally love the seating areas which have swings.. I have heard that thy also place lanterns on each table after sunset which was absent in our case wen we had visited.. It was extremely dark.. Service i found it to be not so good.. However the music and the weather was perfect.. We ordered for a chicken grilled sandwich which was excellent.. And a long island ice tea which was v strong.. My husband had a kingfisher ultra..

ambience n decor: small but cozy although u wont be able to enjoy the view as they have high opaque glass boundary.
price: reasonable for drinks food is on lil higher side.
taste: we had mushroom cap taste was really very good margarita was also good!
service: the main reason behind my 2.5 rating...............disgusting will be an under-statement. 30min after we have ordered our food i went to check y it is not served, then they immediately re-confirmed it, it was evident that they forgot to cook, finally it came 45min after the order, dis was the only food we ordered and as dey dont serve any complementary munching( i dnt knw y?) we had to drink our 1st peg widout any food.
then we repeated our order of drink, then another agonizing wait.........after 15min i asked wt hpnd dey told me dey r out of stock on dat whisky(jim beam) so i hv to change it.
so overall experience was not at all good!
dey have huge locational advantage, they hv good chef, if the make their service btr, dis can be a nice place!

I had a terrible experience this evening at OTT - Over The Top at The Myx and making proper use of social media I will share the word. 

I, along with two of my friends visited the place and inquired about the vacancy at the reception. We made our way to the top after we received a nod from the other end. On visiting the top we were told to wait because the empty tables were and there was no space to sit. (This was okay until now.)

Just then a group left and after inquiring we took over to the vacant space. Right after 5 minutes we were called to the reception. The manager then in charge asked us to leave because the table was "apparently" booked already and they "deliberately" made the previous customer leave. 

Not only there was a lack of coordination between the receptionist and OTT employees but the way they treat customers is absolutely not considerable. When I asked for a visitor's feedback notebook the reply was, "We don't keep one and that is how we work. We can't help it." They denied my request to speak to the senior authorities and ended the conversation saying " We know how we are doing our work and we don't want our customers to teach us anything." On my call to let the people know about this incident, their attitude was very callous, uncultured and all the other synonyms! The Manager was rude, impolite and took no occasion to apologize for the inconvenience caused. 

Highly disappointed! If this is what we get from such reputed and so called sophisticated restaurants ,I request all of you to refrain visiting this place. 

Please share the word and let everyone know about this! 

The Myx Kolkata high time you should look into the matter seriously!

This one's on the roof top as the name speaks situated at Park Street. Over the top is one of those places I would always go to when I visit Kolkata. I recommend this for its ambience and the service.

The terrace at the 6th floor of MYX... The place is beautiful... Not very large but have enough space... The place is nicely done with white chairs tables... Both low and high .. They place lanterns in each table after the sunset... Loved the ambience and the music... Coming to the food I ordered a chicken pepperoni pizza which was really good and very tasty... Frankly I didn't order any food after the pizza as it was pretty large and filling... I ordered two cocktails... Sangria and long island ice tea... Both were nice... And even took a hookah ... That was also good and light... Overall the experience was very good... The prices are very pocket friendly ... A must visit... I'm so going back...

Likes : good music.
Dislikes : you cannot carry your backpack to the top you have to keep it on the ground floor. Food is very expensive keeping in mind the quantity offered. Hookah is cheap. 
When you are at park Street you have many other options. So better avoid this one.

You should rather appoint a bouncer instead of the rude receptionist Swagata.. After confirming over the phone and coming all the way from Salt Lake, we were told there was no space and 4 guys and 2 girls aren't allowed anyway.. Well that was new for a hookah parlour, and especially for a loyal OTT customer.. I have been there 10 times at least but after today's experience, this was my last visit..

My first visit in OTT, and to my surprise they do not change the coal in the hookah.
The lounge being on the roof top with so much breeze tends the hookah coal to lit off quick. When we asked the restaurant guy to change the hookah coal, he simply denied saying management doesn't allow that.

That was actually shocking with such a stupid logic. Even the hookah was not up to the mark. The food were okay and serving speed was too slow.
Overall not a very good experience.

Nice ambiance is the only attraction. Menu is a disaster.

The music was decent,service friendly - just that,its too small...and not very,comfortable - but for a casual evening in the winters,it might just workout well !

This is one of the few rooftop pubs in Kolkata, so it automatically gets some brownie points there. I love the seating area which includes some seats with swings (which I confess I enjoyed a little too much for my age). We had a prawn starter there which was amazing enough for us to order it three times that very night (I don't even remember the name, just asked the waiter to get anything with prawns). The cocktails are pretty rad too. I had whiskey sours which although made without the egg white,  were still pretty good. And you get hookah there too, so an added bonus.

It is located in parkstreet beside kfc and opposite to peter cat under a brand The Myx. Ambience wise it is okay. A good chair must be there as sitting on that was a bit painful after half an hour. Hookah was not up to the mark. They do not have coal change policy. Though hookah is cheaper than others but still making it a good quality one should be a priority for them. But yes if you want to have beer you can go and order one.

The ambience of the place will blow you away... If you're looking for a calm evening to spend with your loved one or a small group of buddies (not more than 3) this place will treat you to the best of ambiences... The trance music and the swing chairs are just too good... Add to that a fountain with steps you can sit on... 

But the downside is the fact that the food apart from the usual tried and tested finger food (crispy chilly baby corn and the likes) is outright deplorable... The staff were okayish in their behaviour... At times a bit rude.. They don't have any beverages on their menu ready and it takes a whole lot of time to get served... Plus the mocktails are a sheer waste...

Go here in a group or 3 or with your partner and enjoy the alcohol and ambience... It won't set you back by much monetarily so yeah... It's a good bargain...

Ott situated in park street on the sixth floor of myx building. It isnt a hard place to locate for people who know park street. It is situated just beside kfc in park street. 

The place has an amazing ambience. As soon as you get out of the elevator u see stairs leading to the place which is ofcourse located on thr roof top . The stairs and decorated with candles and flowers. The whole area is located in the open. The area has a grass ground. It has loud music playing in the background. What more do u expect on a lovely evening with wind blowing and you puffing hookah and enjoying a drink with your friends. Moreover the place is really not at all expensive. Its really very cheap. Where else can you get a hookah at 150 rupess( but mind it they dont change coals). 

Okay now coming to the items we ordered. 
Beer- just the way it should be
Salty dog (cocktail)- beautiful to see , lovely to taste. 
LIT- more of ice less of alcohol. It really didnt taste much like alcohol.
Crispy chilli babycorn- its tasty and they give you a lot of quantity. Its served in bowls like the one you get ice creams in icy fusion. 
Paneer tikka- this is an off the menu item. I really dont like eating paneer but my friends loved the dish.

The thing that i hated most about the place was its service. The waiter was pathetic. On arriving at the place we had to literally ask for the menu 3-4 times after which we given one. On ordering beer we had to wait about 10 mins for each order to arrive. While we were eating the babycorn the waiter comes in the middle and asks us whether he should clean the place, cant he see that we are eating. Finally after getting frustated had to call the manager and told him to change the waiter. After which the manager himself served us . Must say he was a really good guy.

One more thing is most of the items on the menu are not available. Half of the hookah flavours not available. No cold breverages no hot breverages. Tuborg not available kingfisher not available. Some food items also not available. Must say not really expected something from a place at such a posh location. The place doesnt live up to the name .

Sorry it was my friends treat so it was really uneasy to click pictures of food and drinks .

All the filling of the tacos came out before we could pick it up, and the refried beans were cold served with a sour cream which was again not so yummy.
The good thing was the great pictures.

Two unbelievably rude experiences in 7 days.

Day 1: Two of us were asked to keep our backpacks (which had laptops as we were coming straight from the office) downstairs under the counter where there already were more than ten bags strewn around with no one watching over them before going upstairs. What on earth would customers steal from the place???!!!

Day 2: First agreeing to allow one lady and 3 men (one of whom was supposed to join later), the rude manager downstairs disallowed the late joining member later. This was when the rest of the people had started drinking upstairs. The manager on the rooftop called the guy downstairs who answered the phone in front of us and talked even more rudely to his own colleague. All of us then stormed out and had an awesome time at Aqua!

Unbelievably pathetic. Never again. There are super awesome places on Park Street to live with these idiots' arrogance.

Hi..we went to OTT on Sunday , 09th August. The staff were unruly and did not stick to their words in reservations.

Location : Terrace, The Myx.

This hookah lounge opened about a year ago had gathered some hype over its notion of a rooftop caf√© which is a rarity in this town. But all of that has fizzled out as OTT fails to cater to such high expectations. It opens at 4pm. and is near to full within half an hour. The interiors are alluring with distinctive seating arrangements.

The pizza was savory with adequate amount of cheese and veggies. The sheesha however was not up to the mark, lacking in flavor. Per contra the wide incongruity of mocktails and cocktails is surely good. They provide these drinks at avaricious prices compared to other outlets, a plus point.

Kamikaze shots were amazing along with a couple of mocktails. Long Island Tea could have been better.

The staff needs to be a little more well behaved and organized. We were 9 ppl and initially they were unable to provide us with adequate seating. But after a prolonged argument they finally agreed to oblige. The only areas where this place stands out is its rooftop concept and relatively reasonable cocktails.

Over the Top Myx is located on the 6th floor of Myx. It's just diagonally opposite to Peter Cat. Very pocket friendly. Good place for drinks and cocktails. You can see the entire skyline of Park Street. Try out Saprota or Chicken Peperoni pizza. The shots and beers are very reasonable here. In all it's a must visit.

It's beautiful. It's cheap. Shisha and drinks are reasonable at a less expensive rate than other roof top places but the seating arrangement is not so comfortable enough. The good and loud music and the over spaced seats are not for having pensive conversations where the ambiance is more likely to ask for fun-filled friendly conversations! 
The Bruschetta is a must try. :)

It's one if the worst places service and good quality wise.  I found a piece of glass in my mocktail but the staff was least bothered. Even a written complaint made no difference.

It was my luck that I did not swallow that piece of glass though it did cut inside of my cheek.

Best way to describe OTT would be - A cozy place with a great ambience. And the best thing about the place is the fact that it is located at the 6th floor giving us a great view while catching up with friends.

The food and the sheesha at OTT is mind blowing. We ordered a Calzone Pizza, Veg Tacos, Chocolate Liqueur Mock Tail, Queen Punch Mock Tail, Vanilla Rasna Hookah.

We also ordered a few drinks which was slightly on the costlier side in my opinion.

Starting with the sheesha. It was fabulous. I will certainly rate their hookah amongst the best in town. Only setback was the fact that coal change wasn't allowed.

Chocolate liqueur mock tail was yum. It was thick and pretty well presented.

The pizza was amazing. Perfectly baked with the right amount of toppings. The base was crunchy too on the sides.

The tacos was the show stealer for me. The best I have had in Kolkata easily. The fillings were delicious. It was served with a different sauce which tasted pretty nice. And it's presentation was class.

We wanted to try some desserts but couldn't find it on the main menu so had to settle with another mock tail which was pretty good too.

All in a great experience. The service was brisk and the staff was amicable. So if you are looking to hangout with friends on a Saturday evening, OTT is the place to be.

Pricing for the food and sheesha was pretty moderate.

I will rate the place 4.5 because of the lack of desserts.

A rooftop hookah place above myx opened last year in winter . Hookah and drinks both are available here. One evening i went there with my sister and an old school friend for hookah . Their hookah is smooth but not that great . We ordered a chicken salad dish (whose name i could not recollect) well made with pasta and sauce accompanied with a garlic bread .
One can spend an evening here relaxing with a cocktail in hand beside the jacuzzi.

Visited OTT with a few of my friends yesterday. This is one of the few rooftop restaurants in Kolkata situated right in the heart of Park Street opposite to Peter Cat. Ambience is good and the music is also pretty good. The mocktails were good and drinks were cheap too but what disappointed me was the food. They have a pretty quick service too. So if you want to enjoy a few hours with friends in a rooftop ambience without having to shell much from your pockets then you should definitely visit OTT once.
Food-3
Ambience-3.5
Service-3.5
Pricing-3
Overall I would give OTT a 3.5 stars out of 5.

Music is good but sometimes a bit loud. ¬†Price is decent enough. 4 pint beers, 3 pegs of absolute and 2 starters cost us around 3K. Service was brisk too. Though we didn't have hookah, other people who came in did seem to enjoy it :) Over all a lovely place if you like the idea of open terrace pubs! Though some people were disturbed as it was kind of drizzling :) but for me it surely went with the mood. Definitely will visit again. :)

Overall a nice place to hangout. I find this concept of roof top is good especially during early evening hours. The small lantern took my heart, it adds a romantic kinda thing. Shisha nd alcohol lovers must visit, this place is meant for that. The ambience was good. Had a nice time there. 
Recommendation:- varieties of food must be introduced
Must increase the area
Light! Literally I had to switch on my flash light to see the menu.
The coal change facility must be introduced

OTT is an audacious attempt to introduce Kolkata to the concept of roof top restaurants which is a rarity in the city. It is located in the same alley which houses Peter Cat. Pricing is very nice and competitive. All good things about the place end here. Food quality is very average. There were lizards crawling on its walls, when informed the waiters laughed it off. The light to read the menu is very inadequate and when asked how do they expect a customer to go through the menu the answer was with the help of their mobiles. Overall a very disappointing experience.

Located at the social hub of the city, OTT stands in quite a strategic position to attract a handsome group of youngsters. Standing tall beside the sprawling red KFC store, this Gen x joint surfs up high in trend with the "cool" mantra but falls low in few areas. Recently I had visited the place with my friends, and it was summer. I was looking for a place to laze around for a while and cool off, but to my awe there's no ac here as there's no roof. Good part, it was innovative if you really want to enjoy the ambience, bad part, not a place to "chill". I liked the interiors, they have Dj in the house playing cool mixes from time to time, the small fountain specially at night is quite catchy to the eye and specially the small lanterns served up at each table as the sun sets.
Coming down to the food part, the place has kept the charges for hookah pretty much within the budget, BUT you can't just sit with one for an hour or two, a compulsion over there, takes the bill amount soaring high to 770-800 bucks if not more. Pretty variant booze is available if you can be lenient over your pocket pinch.But I personally found out that food was a bit expensive in comparison to the quantity or quality. Like sandwiches are priced at around Rs.275 + taxes. Nevertheless, the presentation is class apart.¬†
The overall ambience of the place is nice, wish it had been bigger or spacious to accommodate more people. You might have to be waiting if your luck is poor, while there being better...
So if you take my words, the bottomline is its great to visit once in a while, but in a good group, wouldn't recommend the place in the monsoon, but hey! you might get a free opportunity for a good rain dance ;)

Well went there yesterday,with a few of my friends,we went there at about 6:30pm and had to wait for approximately ¬†30 mins since all the tables were full.Now if i talk about the ambience,its good,specially the dim lights,and the small lanterns on the tables make it kinda romantic,but since we got a table near the speakers and the music was loud we could hardly hear each other talking.even though they serve non-veg but the food menu lacks variety.We had ordered one pizza,four bottles of beer,three large pegs of absolut,one shots and 2 sheesha and the bill was around 3.3K so the pricing is definately reasonable. :) :) Definately a good place to hangout if you want drinks,open air and sheesha altogether.

Place is good for casual hangouts. 
Hookah is good,and at very reasonable price, without coal changes though, and this place is definitely not for summer(open air summer gifts). Staffs are good,and this place is mostly crowded and very short area of sitting arrangement. Overall, little more than average experience.

Went here today! The place is good, calm and cozy. A nice chill out spot with friends that doesn't burn a hole in the pocket. 
The ambience was good and well set. 
Some items were not available due to some reason.  The mocktails and cocktails were decent. 
Moderate pricing of drinks and cheap for hookah!! 
Can be considered for another visit.

The staff is not cordial. All of them seem to own the place and have done some kind of favour by letting us in.
Small in area, insufficient lights and extra loud music.
Food, Hookah and Cocktails are good.
No coal change available for hookah.
Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

I went to OTT Two days ago just for 45mins and how can I miss writing the review. I had alot of expectations but Blehhhh it was nothing much than just a small roof surrounded by few buildings. Interior was fine and let's start with the sitting arrangements, the center tables are to small, Dirty and not stable at all. We were 5people and it was very uncomfortable to adjust the Drinks, Food and Sheesha on it like so uncomfortable. We ordered 8 bottles of Beer, 3Pegs of Vodka and in starter 2 plates of Crispy Chilli Baby Corn with 2 plates of Garlic Bread. First thing they don't serve anything Complimentary with drink "seriously" atleast wafers we Consumers deserve, No wafers than serve peanuts atleast. Second Crispy Chilli Baby corn was not at all Crispy but Garlic bread attracted our taste bud it was Delishh so the food got balanced here. The music was Fine, waiters were decent and friendly. All round the experience was fine not bad not so good everything was balanced and average.

Situated at the rooftop on one of the most happening places in Kolkata-myx, it's a frequently preferred place. The ambience is great with lanterns at each table giving a treat to one's eyes. The sitting however can't accommodate more than 4 people at once. 
The hookah though not allowed a coal change is priced very inexpensive and is equally lasting and elegantly prepared. The food there lacks "choices". The pizza napolitana was really good and the nachos we had was decent. They can however improve on their jalapeno cheese poppers. 
The place has great music arrangements that can entertain you well for hours.  A good place for catching up on old times with a few drinks.

Over the top that I was when I visited this place. I do not know what others would say but I loved the place absolutely. A roof top with a perfect ambience is a perfect mix of sense of rejuvenation and potrayal of youth culture. You get hookah, booze and food which are somewhat within the range of our pockets. The seating arrangements are nice, the place is more or less candle lit. Apart from alcohol we had ordered for pizza and crispy baby corn. The baby corn was crispy.. Yes!!!! The pizza was not at all like the ones we taste at dominos or pizza hut, but it had its own exotic feel. More like a homemade pizza it was delicious. Over all the place is one of its kind given we are in calcutta!!

As now everyone knows this place, navigation is not being shared...

The place opens at 4 and it gets full by 4.30, since it's an open roof top place in Kolkata which serves hookah, alcohol, good music, smoking allowed and important part: Great food....

The place is quite nicely setup.... It has lot of swings, big bar counter tables and after sunset they lit lantern candle at each table which looks awesomely romantic with the view they provide and the breeze it is...

Now comes the important part the food

Being a vegetarian , i have tried their jalape√±os cheese poppers, pizza mexican wrap, pizza... Every dish they serve was great and loved it specially cheese poppers and wrap..

Have tried their cocktails and its nice....

Hookah - Its smooth and smoky but they have no coal change policy... But with the price they charge i find their policy valid....

Only disadvantage is that: since the place is small (guess50-60 max) people sitting capacity its difficult to get place.. Waiting period is too big and the queue too...

Earlier on tuesday (8.04.2015) the guy at the main entrance misbehaved with his behavior and i left the place without waiting further....¬†

So i would suggest to reach early..

As for the price... Its reasonably moderate with respect to other places in vicinity......¬†

So try out the place once and get disappointed the next time if you don't get the place at one go...

CHEERR........ :) :) :)

To order: 
Crispy chilli baby corn 
Quesadillas 
Mezze platter 
You can try the pizzas too. :) there's live DJ in OTT. Really good place to hang out both on a weekday or weekends over hookah and drinks.

Which actually is I guess ... A place I never that of that Kolkata can have !! Lemme start with the ambience !! Amazing concept... An ambience you won't get in this city !! The view it creates in the evening.. ??
Now if I talk the food ... The way of presenting the dishes are amazing ... It makes you feel like the Judge of Masterchef ?.. But the food is nice .. Won't say too good but yes it is nice ! 
Shisha.. Loved it .. You can't get better in this rate ... Not too expensive place .. Just few suggestion .. Your table is too small and do increase ur service boys .. 

But yes, now it's been an hangout place for me ... If you haven't been.. You are missing something amazing ...

Never trust wat the person say at downstairs ,because the say all the tables are booked but when u go at ott u will see lots of tables are empty , at the phone they  say there is no reserve system for table but when u ask for table to take hookah they say its is reserved 
Kindly improve the management and service

A very well done place with a refreshing roof-top ambience and the candle at the table really is a mood lifter after sunset.The Hookah has a no-coal change policy, but the hookah is made well and not overdone.We ordered Crispy Chilli babycorn which was nice and the taste was not over powering at all.The second dish we ordered was the Red Sauce Penne pasta, a bit too sweet, but it merged well our taste buds.The only put off is the waiting time, which for us on a Sunday was close to 45 mins. That should be improved ASAP.

Arrogant and how. Not once. Not twice. It's like they are doing us a favour. And the place, drinks, music, food isn't even that good. Unfortunately, we don't have too many places in this city. So.

Another visit: I asked them if the place is open and if they serving hookah. I was alone. I went back to get my friend. When I came back they acted all cool and said they'll need to call and check if they have place. First, when I'm asking all these questions that means I might come back. Second, if they have no place we can check ourselves and come back. It's not even close to being an elite place where they have check their reservations. 

Can't wait to write more reviews on this place.

Location: Terrace, The Myx; Beside KFC. 

This place was visited in the evening today before a conference that was due an hour later and must say, this place definitely impressed!
The AMBIANCE out here was calm and soothing with dim lights, artificial grass across the floor, candles on the table, colorful seating arrangements (short chairs, high chairs and swings) to accommodate around fifty heads, fountain and light music in the background.

About the FARE, the well-drafted menu wasn't quite widespread but, also included cocktails and liquor.
Ordered a sheesha along with a plate of Crispy Chilli Babycorn and a beer.

- The Babycorn was well marinated and crisp tossed in the right amount of sauce having the correct spice balance. Topped with chopped spring onions and served. Delicious.

‚Ä¢ The SHEESHA was found to be smoky, but, the downside being the no coal change policy.

The well-informed staff was courteous and served at a moderate speed.
Pricing is slightly inclined towards the moderate end.

Overall was a good experience.
- Yet to try the remaining fare, comments due.

To me, food is as visually simulating as it is to the taste buds and this place scores there. The candlelight, stars above your head, shisha and light music creates a maddening effect. Combine it with chilled beer and bunch of friends and your evening is made.

A quite cozy place tucked away on the roof top. This place makes you feel like you're in another city , and completely relaxes the mind . The ambience makes up for the limited food menu. I would recommend this place for hookah and drinking, rather than eating . Best to visit on a chilly winter evening.

I would like to give -5 to The MYX but don't have an option to give that.

Personally I've always had a good experience here. The ambience is amazing,  especially when you're there around the time of sunset. The ambience is enhanced by the amazing weather that is in kolkata these days. The food is good..not extraordinary. But decent. Though the pizza didn't meet the standard that a lot of kolkata restaurants and cafes have set for thin crust pizzas.. their cocktails are great and hookah is good enough. All in all.. this is a perfect hangout spot.

Very disappointing experience.

Visited on 14th Jan 2015. Got seats easily. Place was empty.

Ordered 2 Absolutes with Soda. We asked for a lime wedge but specified clearly that we do not want any lemon juice in the drinks.¬†

The waiter gave us pre mixed drinks, with the LOT of lemon juice squeezed in BOTH the drinks.¬†

The lemon juice was clearly visible in the drink, the entire drink was very sour.¬†

No problem, mistakes happen, we thought. We asked him to change the drink, and then the situation not worse.¬†

1) He tries for 5 minutes to convince us that there is NO lemon juice in the drink and we have gone crazy.

2) When we physically showed him the lemon juice (It was visible in the drink) thats not lemon, thats the melted ice. (Dirty ice?)

3) Then he finally took the drinks back to the bartender, and we waited for 10 mins +. They ¬†kept talking and ignoring us.¬†

4) I walked to the bar and asked what was the problem. The bartender was told by the waiter to give lemon juice in the drink! He admitted the waiter's mistake and we walked back to our seats.

5) A little later, the SAME drinks were given back to us!

6) On further inquiry the bartender advised us that since the drinks were already made, we should drink them! So what its the waiters fault or its sour!

7) Another 5 minutes of my life wasted, and then we finally got our replacement drinks, which actually seemed watered down. The replacement took over 25 mins.¬†

They ain't getting my business again for sure. They "soured" a perfectly good evening.

Note to MANAGEMENT:

What is the cost of 120 ml Absolute to your establishment? It is so high that its cheaper to loose customers over your own staff's mistakes?

I am in love with this place. Like really, really in love.
I have been to OTT twice since it's opening recently. And had to wait for close to 40 mins to get a seat. Both of the times. 
But honestly, It's all worth it. 
More than the food, OTT is a place where you would go when you really need to let it go. This is one place where you can order a hookah, some great drinks and just CHILL. It's small ( the reason everybody has to wait), cozy and beautiful. 
The place is adorned with beautiful seats. And that is not even the best part. They have got GREAT music playing while you chat away. 
Coming to the food, mock tails needs a lot of improvement. The Pizza was great. And whatever very little knowledge that I have of hookah, it was great too. It didn't give me headaches like all the other I have tried before this. 
So yeah, Good going guys. 
P.S.- If only, you guys could make us wait a little less, that'd be great.

When you step out of the life the place seems small n cozy but the ambience is amazing, specially on a Chilly cold day. Amazing place as in . But the turn down is the limited food menu and spl when the food is not that great to eat. The Hookah pricing and making both are a total switch on. The drinks n cocktails are also very well served. Over all a nice place to hang out when u have a large group.

The staffs are not at all hospitable. They ask you to wait and then do not even bother to call u later. Faced the issue twice. Food and Ambience is not the only credibility factor to rate a Restaurant.Yet to experience either of them. Still waiting at the entrance.....

I went there to give a bday surprise to my friend and i must a say it was a very successful surprise as the staff is here is very courteous and well behaved. Its situated in the 6th floor and its an open roof hukkah parlour which makes it all the more happening. It comes in one of the few open roof hookah parlour. 
We ordered 2 hookah one was double apple which was really good and the other one was orange rasna which was okayish. In food we ordered for crispy chilli babycorn which was good and was crispy as its name suggests and it was accompalimed by salad of beetroot and onions ( not sure), garlic bread which was very good as it was baked to perfection, and margarita pizza which was also good. Overall the experience was nice and the ambience here is amazing with nice music and breeze to put you in a good mood. The price is quite reasonable so overall a total worth of money.
A must go to place.

Located on the rooftop this place is well made, small but cozy and very pleasing to the eye. The interiors are done really well. It is on the top floor of myx. So i had been wanting to go here for quite sometime and finally i managed to chill there last evening. We ordered for vanilla rasna hubbly bubbly which was nice but they dont change coal even for extra charge so thumbs down for that. We ordered for veg tacos which was decent, i really liked the dip though. The service is a bit of an issue and needs to be addressed if they want to make a loyal customer base. The prices are quite affordable and the bill for hookah and tacos was Rs 550 which is quite alright. The overall experience of the place is good enough to warrant a repeat visit.

Food: Nice. We ordered Cheese Garlic Bread.¬†Hookah: Decent.Customer Service: Please go somewhere else.This is by far the best place I've been to for Customer Service. I am in awe of a place that invests all its energy in making an amazing place to hangout without an iota of common sense on how to at the very least, respect its patrons. I would love to recommend your case to the gurus of the food and beverage industry on the topic of "How to get ambience right and screw up your lifeline - customers". The following is based on true events experienced by the reviewer.

This happened on 3rd of January 2015. On entry at 4 pm on a Saturday, we're asked by the "polite" receiptionist "Are you going to OTT? Sorry that's house blocked". Luckily we had friends waiting so we went up. On the way up, a "politer" lady named Afreen enters the elevator with warm questions like "Are you going to Pari's party" "No" "So you just walked inside and no one said anything" "No" "How could you just come up" ~~Nothing to say, cause we're feeling like we're gatecrashing any moment now~~

We reach upstairs and boom. No private party. Different groups of people chilling casually.

We politely asked Ms. Afreen to explain and requested to talk decently to a customer to which  her response "I don't know what's happening here" and she walks off. 

We called the beige-suited gentleman to complain about the episode and boom. 

Mr. Manager is just two months old so please do not expect anything from him. All we ask is for him to call Ms. Afreen (oh and by the way, this management is stuff of legends. They don't know the last names of the managers they are working with and cannot find out as well. Hence, only our very friendly Ms. Afreen). 

Cut to one hour later when we begin to leave and when asked for the bill, we ask for Ms. Afreen. "She is actually gone for a break". Since, we have been meted out such pampering, we decide to return the favour. "Call Ms. Afreen within five minutes or we're leaving without paying the bill". 

Voila! Ms. Afreen presents herself in front of us. "What's the problem" (Recounting the entire episode to Ms. Afreen and telling her that there is certain level of decency with which you treat a customer and you should have shown that) "Actually Sir, I am too busy today" DUDE! 

I don't care if you're busy. You need to treat your customers with some respect and not accost them and question their intention to coming and hanging out at your place. With all due respect, we have not requested for free food or drinks and are paying customers. At least have a little decency. "Sir what do you want from me? You want to me tell you Sorry? Ok. Sorry. Please end it now. Ok" and she walks off with an air about "I have better things to do"

Thus, highly recommended for anyone who wants to be treated like garbage, feel like they're trespassed on private property, and be pampered with staff that 1) Don't really care 2) Don't really care and 3) Don't really care. 

Will definitely try again as I'm sure this place can do better. Eagerly awaiting for the next lesson on "Customers - screw you!"

Overpriced is a word too small and lenient to describe this place.
I ordered their "our special " salad,gave me a bowl with salad enough to fill a cup(as giant as the cup used to serve simply corn at cinemas) with practically nothing but lettuce,charged me 225 bucks for it.
Even though i am oblivious of culinary skills,i can say it would take hardly rs.25 to brew up such nonsense.Its as if you are paying for their rent in such a posh locale and not the food.
Ambience was in truest sense irritating like any other lounge. English music (they do not play hindi since hindi music is uncool these days) being played is so loud you have to shout out to the person next to you for a conversation.
The decor,interiors and the roof top feel were the only silver lining to the otherwise thumbs down place.
Its NOT a value for money place.
You wish to throw money if your pockets have become too heavy,do visit it.

It is located in park street in myx,opposite peter cat restaurant.I Went along with my friends on 25th dec for the first time,and had to wait their in reception for about 45 mins as they dont take any bookings.itz a first come first serve basis!!! Phewww###
     Ambience is quite good n gives a cosy feel in this winter.As its on roof top and open.A 40 seater place with good music n dim lights with swings in corners,waterfal in one end and candel on each table was a nice concept.Interiors is good.
Now coming to the service: it is very slow and they need to improve on it.
We had momo...super duper yumm...finger licking..:-P
Veg:Thin crust pizza,tex mex platter...al tasted quite good.
Chocolate shake was pathetic to the core.no taste ..yet tasteless.
Hookah was ok typz.
Recomemded: A must visit!!!!

Nice ambience.. decent decor.. seating area is not too big.. but sufficient..
The food menu(veg) isn't promising.. the taste of the food is normal.. nothing extraordinary.. could be made better.. we tried crispy fried mushrooms, paneer wrap and veg Margarita pizza..
went there at 11 in the evening, it was cold out there.. but they had no hot beverages available.. the food served hot was getting cold in seconds.. that was a small drawback of being in the open in such a weather..
hookah was good.. we ordered 3pan.. no ice base.. no chill pipe.. no coal change..
friendly service.. prices are kept to fair minimum.. can visit again to explore more..

The worst place you can chill at in Park Street. DO NOT GO HERE.(at least anytime soon)
-they don't serve 'straight liquor' meaning they can make you cocktails n all but not a hard drink of your choice (drink your vodka in a mojito). Remember: NO BEER! 
-worst service. No co-ordination between the bartender, waiters, billing guy. Your orders will get irrationally delayed and probably cancelled. 
-they don't keep drinks with them. Rather they keep getting them from downstairs (myx) which is again a pain in the ass. 
-the place is good looking and conveniently located but that's about it. The place is cheap...quite literally (in price, service and quality)
You'll end up spoiling your mood and wasting that money.

So ....open air, great location, existing name as a great club comes with its own set of expectations. Went with high hopes and they were somewhat met. It's a pretty small place, artificial grass and terrace furniture. Good things - good food, hookah, good music. Did not like  - the non existent view, cramped space, table for three/four insufficient to hold the food and drinks. Ok if somebody else is throwing a party an ago have to attend it in winters but not my first choice if I want a good evening. Maybe a good  place for just chilling with friends and hanging around....

Small but a pretty decent place to chill with friends especially during winters and for those who love to sit outdoors.
Alcohol and hookah is priced very reasonable which I think would be a great attraction for all pre gamers.
Food was great..you all should definitely try out the papaya salad.

A place to be. this new cafe in town brings something that we hardly had- an open roof cafe( yeah i know u must be thinking about afraa) but then this one is different.it's a totally no roof cafe. The name draws crowd in itself. Ambience is amazing. visit after the sunset. that's when they dim the lights and turn to play some good music. hookah is perhaps the cheapest in town, priced around 150( i know "WTF, seriously?"). They also serve alcohol (about to start serving, but they have it in their menu), so another plus point. this place is exactly where sourav's was and where MYX is. chairs and tables are good. you might feel the beats of the disc located below-MYX. food is bit pricy but it's good.
Things not so good:
1) Service is so damn slow that you actually feel like going to the kitchen and preparing the stuff on you own.
2)they do not change the coal of your hookah. if you want more, you'll have to get yourself a new one.
otherwise,
it's a  cracker of a place. kudos to the owner.

The place is really good! The best part is that you get a live DJ and the rooftop ambience is really good! The cocktails and hookah are really good! It's not too pricey. Hookah and cocktails are pocket friendly!
The service is a bit on the downside! 
First I had to call them to take my orders and I had ordered a chilli mushroom which the waiter told me hasn't been ordered. I hope they improve the service a bit. Overall a good experience:)
PS:- You get to pull your shisha only for 30 minutes!(That sucks!?!) No coal change. You need to order a new one.

OTT - Over the top , name itself is so classy , so is the place. The newest rooftop Hookah bar in the heart of Kolkata. It's in the top floor of Myx Building. The ambience and place is very swanky !!
Hanging chairs looks super !! Dj console in the right place. Small Pool , Very elegant overall. The hookah here is very good. The food menu remains the same as of myx. Nothing much to describe about the food . But yes the crispy chilli babycorn - SchEzwan style is crazy !!  Thin Crust pizza ? Try the veg broccoli pizza !! Fabulous !! The prices are exorbitant cheap over here. Definitely below according to the place it is. A must go place. A very good hangout. I would rate it definitely above afraa. ( my previous fav Open air rooftop lounge )
Cheers to the Myx Team !!
