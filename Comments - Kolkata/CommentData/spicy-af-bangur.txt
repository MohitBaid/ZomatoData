I went to kolkata on Christmas eve, I had some official work in Lake Town. Was looking for a good place to eat, roamed around and came across this place. The name was funky so I went in and ordered a veg fried rice and paneer chilli combo. The food was so tasty that I returned there for dinner as well. This time I ordered Xiao Potato and a Veg Chowmein combo and man it was spicy. I didn't expect the food will be so good at such affordable prices. Loved it. Will visit next time I go to Kolkata. Cheers.

A newly opened place in Bangur, visited yesterday on Christmas with friends. They do live up to their name. Food was really good and spicy and they have introduced a wide range of chinese and continental starters, some of which they claim to prepare with their house special suaces. Spicy AF chicken wings is a must try. Plus you get a starter free if you 3. Their behaviour and the service they provided was really good. In a word, it was Awesome AF.  Will visit again during New Year.

These guys are new in town and have really come up with something which one cannot deny to appreciate after tasting. The food which I tasted was really great.
 I have ordered Chinese Food from them twice in a week since its my favourite and both the times they have made sure I come back again.

Day 1 : Ordered Veg Noodles and Chicken Manchurian and Veg Manchurian.
The noodles were Quite substantial in amount with an awesome taste. The chicken Manchurian Balls were soft and juicy. Veg Manuchurian was also quite upto the mark.

Day 2 : Ordered chicken Roll,Egg Fried Rice and Chilli Chicken.
The Roll was unusually great and found the Parantha wrap to be unconventionally soft and crispy at the same time. The stuffing was something that should be a surprise for first timers.

The Fried Rice and Chilli Chicken was a Take away and Made a fine Dinner. The flavour of the fried rice was unique and Made me quite a fan. The chilli Chicken was tender neither too hot not too spicy but had its unique flavour.

Day 3 : These Guys have to my surprise come up with a wide range of unique starters definitely worth a bite. Tasted SpicyAF chicken wings , the spicy sauce with the  crisp and the tenderness was definitely worth every penny. 

To conclude
In all I would really recommend this to my friends anyday ! Best Non Veg Food joint in Bangur!!

Ordered food from Swiggy and first from this joint. It is a newly opened in my area so wanted to try it out. 

I ordered for a fried and chilli paneer, food was hot but I being a pure vegetarian good smell the non veg aroma. It was so strong that it made the food difficult for consumption. Quantity was good, but the aroma was very depressing.
Tasted a little and did not like. This review is not demean the efforts but purely what I felt. 
They really need to improve on taste and try and remove that pungent smell. Maybe the use of msg invited the smell.
