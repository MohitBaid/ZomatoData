Located at Food Court of Lake Mall, Yum Street.
Ordered chole bhature. The bhatura they serve is very soft. The chole is not too spicy & has a sweet-spicy taste. And the chutney served along with the chole, also has a unique taste. üòÅ

Gujarati Zayka is a pure veg kiosk located at the food court of Lake Mall, Lake Market area, Kolkata. It serves Gujrati dishes.
This place has well behaved staffs and service is decent.
Tried Khandvi & Srikhand. Both were nice though nothing fab. Srikhand was better .
Pocket pinch is reasonable.

This is located at Lake Mall food court serving pure vegetarian Gujarati dishes.

Ambience is cool with nice sitting arrangenents.

Swift service and nice staffs.

Tried Chole Bature & Shrikhand. Chole Bhature was mediocre. Shrikhand was creamy and yummy.

Pocket pinch is reasonable.

I've had only the Chola bhatura here, and I can say that I've had better. Out of all the stalls at yum court, it's better to give this a pass. The only saving grace is the ice cream souffle, and that is worth a try.

Authentic Gujrati food at it's best! One can rarely find authentic Gujrati cuisine in Kolkata. Glad such an amazing place has come up! Located at a place like Lake Market, it definitely caters to a crowd of vegetarians. Me being a non-vegetarian was no less satisfied!

Their shrikhand is my personal favourite. Creamy, light, and whisked to perfection. Would definitely recommend it to anyone paying them a visit.

Not very happy with the falooda I ordered. Hopefully next time it turns out to be better. I do not know about the other food items on display. Menu card needs to be updated.

This outlet at the Lake Mall food court was a real disappointment. Seeing that it was being run by Gujarati ladies I had great expectations regarding the food. But it was a bad experience....not tasty at all. Neither was it authentic gujju to taste and didn't seem to be fresh either.

Am changing the rating for this place as I feel that the standard has improved somewhat. It's not that they are really good but now they are better than what they were earlier. They also seem to have introduced new items so more variety available for customers. But their is still scope for tremendous improvement and I hope they improve, otherwise they won't be able to carry on.
