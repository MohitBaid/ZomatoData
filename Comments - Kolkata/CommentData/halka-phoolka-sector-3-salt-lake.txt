Don't know if we are writing the review at the wrong place, because the place where we went had no birthday cakes (as shown in Zomato photos), or maybe we don't know about all the items on their menu.

This small outlet just outside Downtown mall (Carnival cinemas + Big Bazaar) looks really cute with doodles and bright yellow stools and is vegetarian. It is situated along with 3-4 similar food kiosks.
We just had a chocolate shake here after hours of shopping at Downtown mall. The service was slow and the chocolate shake should have been thicker and creamier. Tastewise, nothing close to satisfactory but if you are really tired and exhausted just like we were, maybe you wouldn't complain.

But well, a glass of fresh fruit juice would be lot cheaper and much healthier. We wouldn't recommend their chocolate shake but would try sone other items on their menu next time.
Cheers!

Small kiosk near Big Bazaar,Salt Lake.Serves only vegetarian dishes. Tried the margherita pizza and a paratha. Both tasted great.The pizza came in the form of a taco and was baked.The paratha was stuffed. Good twist on indian dishes.
