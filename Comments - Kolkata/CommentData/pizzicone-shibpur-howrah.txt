I always wanted to get my hands on pizza sold here . The new concept as in pizza in a cone ! I mean that's an innovative thought to gastronomic delights . Pizza in a goddamn cone !!! Avani luckily had this outlet . The only thumbs down here was making the treat card separately and waiting for good 10 minutes to get my hands on the final product . Well well my beautiful pizza cone arrives . Grilled , loaded with cheese and ofcourse chicken . Oh god that was totally foodgasmic. I ordered chicken Caesar pizza in cone . It costed me rs 170 and I found it bit overpriced as it can serve only one tummy that also not to epitome . Otherwise , thumbs up .

The concept was very innovative and appealing to me. I gave it a try. Tried a pizzicone(forgot the name). I liked the taste. And willing to visit this kiosk again.

Loved the innovation. 
Pizzicone brings a fresh lease of life to the age-old concept of Pizza... and the idea is a grand success!!
Very courteous staff.
Reasonably priced.
And absolutely no compromise with the taste.
The only attraction perhaps that will keep forcing me to visit Avani Mall over and over again. *_*
Hope to see more outlets in other parts of the city as well.

Cone pizza a twist in pizza

Nice to carry a pizza like a cone

But it is not well made
As it is pizza cone it should be easily eatable while traveling but it don't do the job
Taste wise it is acceptable for a try but once.

Location-Avani riverside mall.

This place comes with a new concept of serving pizza.Its their first outlet and as the name(Pizzicone) suggests,this place serves pizza in a cone made of the same ingredients as the base of the pizza.They also serve regular pizza and its a venture by the Cream and Fudge factory.

Service-The service at this place is quite fast and reliable.But there is a shortage of staff which sometimes results in a delay.

Food-We were impressed by this new concept but the taste of the pizzicone was not liked by us.The cone comes with a filling of extremely hot cheese and veggies.As you start eating it the filling will start draining out of the cone making it all a mess.We had-
1:Bbq mushroom
2:Paneer tikka

Food-3/5
Service-3.5/5

Not worth recommending.ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ

Tried two pizzicones , this cone form of pizza , from the food court of avani riverside mall , the counter located near the wow momo and bhoot bunglaw corner side. ACHARI KEEMA and SMOKED CHICKEN were my picks. The pizzicones were charged 125 /- each and came with a personal size pizza base , fillings and mozarella toppings. They had decent taste but not enough to excite my taste buds , theres way better preparations for spicy pickled mutton keema than the one used for filling. The chicken one was bland. Also the portion was small considering the pricing.

This counter is a deserted part of the ever full food court of avani mall. This is a venture from the people of the cream fudge factory, the concept of coned pizza is quite appealing and was for long in my go to list, went there on Independence day and got a special offer to get a free cone on purchase of 3 cones.

We ordered 3 cones and a pizza stick. Pizza cones is just 'famous kathi roll's that went to Italy for higher studies', there is nothing pizza in it. The base is oily and fillings are ok with minimal sause that leakes out of the cone till the time you reach the bottom. My rools were burnt from parts as well.

Options we tried:

1. BBQ mushroom: This is spicy filled with mushroom with very less cheese or cream, keep a drink ready with you when you try this.

2. BBQ paneer: This is plain panner with no additional species, served with tomato's and capsicum with melted mozzarella. Some pepper or oregano is recommended to make it tastefull.

3. Hawaiian veg: This had boiled sweet corn, tomatoes and capsicum. People who love raw boiled vegetables will love it. No additional flavour in it made my taste bud feel the freshness of the vegetables served in it. This option will be very bad for other majority of people who love food to be higher on spice.

4. Veg pizza stick: This is just usual bread baked with some capsicum, tomato's and Onion's with a little touch of mozzarella, served with tomato ketchup, the base was burnt from the bottom, it was awful and tasted like plain bread, never recommend even served as free.

Pepper, oregano or some sort of a dip is recommended to be served along with the cones.
