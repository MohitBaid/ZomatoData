Hey Indus Pizza, keep it up. I and spclly all my guests really loved it. Your Brownie, as awful, and American Nuts first I thought its must be a drink or a milkshake and I really surprised to see its a Ice cream. Come to your pizza dough its too soft...with crispy side combination is grt, the use of your cheeses, the sauce and spclly the extra portion is really made my day. Paying 90.00/- in Cheesy Lovers Pizza is paisa waasool. TheVeg Feast (8inchs)- the size of each of them are huge. 
But guys please must do work on chicken stuffed garlic bread, its taste as well as the making process is not good quantity and quality of bread,cheese,chicken were so poor and it made the whole slides bread very soggy.  
Next time I will definitely give you the orders coz its very much pocket frndly. If you reaches that 5rateing pls work on your  chicken stuffed garlic bread.
Bye
Goodluck

We visited PoushParban-Chirstmass Mela at Sribhumi last week and just ordered Veg pizza and BBQ & Spicy Pizza for our pizza crazy gang, I did not expect such a awesome taste at this price and specially during such crowd the service quality was intact. Wish to see you again.

we never expected a pizza can be so tasty, delicious and yummy. Had several times before in many international brand but realizing now they are just for fame. the offers, price size and quality are very impressive. the slogan "price what you see, you pay for" made me relaxing and fearless. Hope to receive the same quality ever.

Not at all impressed by their quality of pizza. Got a take away of Paneer and Chicken tikka pizza both with extra cheese. have to say that cheese was no where to be found even in the extra cheese order. Amount of topping was somewhat satisfactory. But the taste of the toppings is certainly the sector that needs improvement. I would not recommend strongly of the place as of now

We got Two Indus Red Valley Large and Double Bar-B-Q Large Pizza home delivery for celebrating my son's birth day. Delivery was well ahead as agreed and when we opened and looked at the pizza size, it was too big to eat. Crust was very crispy and yummy at the same time. Toppings were used all over the pizza evenly and quantity was overwhelming. Lastly the delivery person and the order receiving person polite and professional behavior made me very happy. ThanQ for making my son's Birthday a special one.

I‚Äôve had good experiences here at Indus Pizza. This is my favorite pizza place ‚Äì I love this from the dough to the topping. Their pizza is always good, fresh and the quality of ingredients speaks up when you eat their pizza. I‚Äôve tried many varieties ‚Äì all amazing and reasonably priced. The slices are huge and sauce had amazing flavor. Next time, I‚Äôll be trying their Indus Red Valley.
Finally, the delivery - I appreciate that they do not charge for delivery and they deliver it ON TIME. The staff has always been very friendly.
I am happy that this nice pizza place is in our neighborhood and I will continue to order from them. I just want all of you to know - please try this place.
