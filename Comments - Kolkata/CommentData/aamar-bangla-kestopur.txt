Ordered all of the 3 thalis ( veg , mutton and fish) and shukto. All the thalis come with 2 veggie prep , dal , steamed rice and  classic tomato chutney and choice of main course like fish or meat .I particularly liked the veg dishes cuz the taste is really good and the fish preps are out of the world. Even though I'm not a fan of fishes, I heart the fish preps that Aamar Bangla provides. Packaging was descent . In a nutshell- thumbs up!

We tried their combo meals :basanti pulao and katla kalia/ mutton kosha.  Packaging was good and prompt delivery. Portion size sufficient for one person.  Basanti pulao tasted just as it is supposed to taste, without excessive oil or aroma.  Katla kalia was absolutely delicious.  Mutton kosha was regular with two pieces of mutton; but the meat needed some more cooking.  Overall good experience. Price reasonable.

My first visit to Amar Bangla was quiet unplanned and impromptu, but it came out to be worth of. It is a descent place,serves really gulpable food,having quality taste and aroma. Proper authentinc bengali dishes they serve. You can try the chicken and fish thali,basanti polau and chicken bhuna.

But the problem is with their marketing and service. Being the only bengali resturant they have a good future if the do the marketing well. And we will be happy too that we will have a good quality of eatout place in our locality. They should give ad in various places,as a hoarding,leaflet etc. should flash out their special offer infront of gate on daily basis. 

And the restaurant workers should be more interactive, enthusiastic and polite towards customers.

This restaurant serves Bengali & Bangladeshi Delicacies. Ordered Shukto, Dal, Paneer Matar, Aloo Fulkofir Roshan, & Mixed Chutney. Well the Shukto was tasty made with veggies like raw banana, papaya, drumsticks, bitter gourd, poppy seeds and grated coconut. The Dal was Moong dal. Paneer Matar had adequate amount of Paneer and fresh green peas. Aloo fulkofir Roshan was nicely made, tasted awesome. Finally the Mixed Chutney umm ta raw mangoes and pineapple cubes was sweet and sour amazing. Overall they put poppy seeds in most of their dishes, other thing noticed is they use less amount of cooking oil as compared to other restaurants who put more.tried these restaurant twice in a week's time not bad at all.

I tried their basanti polao and Chicken bhuna combo. Basanti polao was good but the aroma of it was too strong so it is recommended to reduce the scent. Chicken bhuna was tasty and tasted really good with the basanti polao, the chicken could have been a bit soft. Would love to try the other items soon.

This is a newly opened bengali cum dhakai cuisine restaurant in Kestopur. Simple interiors but air conditioned. Food is quite good actually. You get all kinds of bengali and bangladeshi preparations at a decent price. I had ordered their chicken thali (@ rs 160). Quantity was good given that I was extremely hungry. Chicken curry was excellent.

I do not usually give high ratings. But Amar Bangla deserves it because :

1. Truly Bengali and NON-VEG. Run by Bengalis in an area virtually usurped by 'veggies' Those people have opened various outlets which serve only VEG. 

2. They do home delivery even if you order 1 dish (most fleece you by forcing you to order for a large amount). I usually need a dish or two since it's only 2 people.

3. PRICE :
Very reasonable. And doesn't increase after ordering. Only a minor amount added as delivery charge( Rs. 10)

4. QUALITY :

Pretty good. Chicken kosha is very good. However, Chicken Dakbanglow was a bit of a disappointment.

I never order via Swiggy or any other 3rd party. I always call them directly. (same for any restaurant I order from)
