Ordered 2 Chicken Biriyanies. It was the worst Biriyani I ever had. It was just fried baskati rice with some added color. It was pathetic in taste. Now I realize why they are giving 20% discount. Nobody would buy from them 2nd time. Zomato should blacklist such pathetic restaurant.

Ordered chicken cutlet and egg chicken hakka noodles via Zomato.

Delivery was on time. The staff was polite. Packaging was decent. 

Coming to the food, the cutlet was average, nothing extraordinary. Given the price it came in it was fine. The disappointment was the noodles. It was dry and bland, had no seasonings. Tasted like mere boiled noodles tossed in some salt and oil. Also, not only was the quantity very less but I literally had to dig through for chicken bits.

Won't recommend ordering atleast the noodles unless you're in deep pickle!

I have ordered for egg chicken chow mein which costs around 70/-. When I have received it, it was only egg chow mein with no salt! This is really pathetic to get something which actually does not suffice your money value. Also, they have not given any salad / sauces. I won't suggest this for noodles.

Nd on top of it, the Food ws jst horrible! Plz plz dnt order from this hotel I request you. I ordered handi chicken which contained black mustard in it. This made the food bitter. In fact I couldn't finish it up it ws so poor. I haven't eaten handi chicken that contains mustard in it in my life till now. Worst service ever. 1st nd last time I am ordering from this piece of shit. Don't go by the prices, its vry cheap on paper nd also quality wise too! üòÄ

After reading couple of good reviews about the biryani,I ordered it.
The biryani is 80 rupees only ,which is amazing. And honestly tastes well too. 
The amount of masala in it makes it similar to Hyderabadi one and less like the traditional Kolkata one. 
In a nutshell, decent eatery.could be better.
