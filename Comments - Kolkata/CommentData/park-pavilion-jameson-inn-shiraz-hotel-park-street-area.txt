Situated in the prime location, just opposite to Pak Streert Cemetery. The look is awesome and stunning.
Coming to the dining area, it was well decorated with minimum colors and wooden flooring. There is artistic touch in the table decoration as well.
Coming to the food, we got a coupon from little worth â‚¹599, which was the Chinese combo.
What we had:
1. Manchow soup
2. Schwan fish
3. hot and garlic chicken
4. chicken egg burnt garlic noodles
5. mocktail(which was chef's choice)
6. date pan cake with ice cream
7. brownie
There was nothing special about the Manchow soup but could have been better. The fish which had 6 pieces where cooked properly and nice in taste but somehow lacked being crispy. The noodles were extremely tasty and was full with vegetables. The chicken was good too. The chef's special mocktail was a flavored lassi. The brownie was disheartening but the date pan cake was extremely crispy with a topping of honey <3

To start with,as suggested by other users i did prior reservation as i was carrying a nearbuy coupon.
The management was nice as i had to change the reservation from saturday to sunday which they gladly accepted.
I dnt know whom to praise for the amazing deal that we opted from nearbuy.
For 599 it was too much both interms of quantity and quality. It was a 4 cource meal.
The resturant is located just opposite to the iconic SHIRAZ hotel at Mallik Bazar.
The resturant is nicely lit and well decorated. Now comming to the food.
We had ordered two soups- hot and sour chicken and sweet corn chicken soup.
The earlier was way better.
For starters we had chilly fish which pretty tasty.
For Main course we had chicken-egg singapore noodles and garlic chicken.
Both lacked taste and was pretty lame.
And for desert we were given a date pan cake(i didnot find any significant amount of cake in it) and a brownie( it was like britania thin slice cake with chocolate syrup on top).
Overall for 599 its ok with .

I would have given 0 stars if possible. Extremely rude behaviour of the staff. We had purchased 4 nearbuy vouchers worth 2300Rs, however we didn't reserve a table before. I have had booked various nearbuy vouchers before and gone without booking a table. It was a friend's birthday and we went to celebrate. However they couldn't let us in as for nearbuy a prior reservation is mandatory despite the restraunt being completely empty. We requested them so many times but still they didn't let us in. Rubbish place

Went there today for the first time. We ordered Coke, Chicken sweet corn soup, Manchow Soup, Chilly fish, Schezwan Rice, Garlic Chicken, Brownie & Darsaan . The food quality was average and the quantity was enough for two. The Chilly fish was a bit salty. We were really disappointed because they provided us Plain egg chicken fried rice instead of Schezwan rice. Service was a bit slow.

We ordered chicken clear soup, dry chilli chicken, garlic chicken, egg-chicken fried rice, ice cream and chocolate brownie. 
The food was nice and is ample for two. 
The staffs are really nice and helpful. And special mention to Mr. Kazi Shohid. He knows his work very well and always asked us whether to serve next food item or wait for sometime. 
The decor and ambience is nice. 
Just the background music was boring. ðŸ˜…

This place is now a replacement of the big Shiraz that once stood at the junction of park Street and park circus. This place has a decent interior and quite spacious too. We had ordered food here as per the menu offered in nearbuy coupons. But the food was good. We had the conventional Chinese food encompassing a soup, starter, main course and the dessert. Over all was a pleasurable experience.

Recently, there has been a flurry of restaurants located in hotel establishments which are open for both in-house and outside guests. The main advantage of such a place being the quality and excellence of service one gets, as if we were staying in that such classy hotel.

Park Pavilion is a similar restaurant which is a part of Jameson Inn Shiraz Hotel. It is located right at the Mallik Bazar crossing when we take a turn towards Park Circus. The Jameson Inn Shiraz is the first hotel of â€˜Jameson Innâ€™, a leading American budget hotel brand, in India.

Park Pavilion offers a choice of the finest dishes from multiple cuisines. With a seating capacity of 50, it is ideal for a quick and delicious corporate breakfast, a luscious buffet lunch with old friends, and a 365-day lavish dinner buffet. The interiors are chic and graceful with wooden finish texture all over. The lighting is also suitable.

The service was decent.
My overall experience at Park Pavilion was, I would say, below par.

So folks that was about it from Park Pavilion at Jameson Inn Shiraz Hotel.
Check out my blog for a wholesome experience. Stay tuned and watch this space for more updates about restaurants in Kolkata.

And Be Suavy !! ...

"Awadhi Heaven" is the correct term for this place. Excellent decor and amazing food with very cordial staff, makes this place the perfect place for dining with the family. We tried the galouti kebab, a fish kebab and a chicken kebab. Along with that we tried the chicken biriyani and mutton chaap. The biriyani is very different. It's light on the palate yet very tasty. A must visit for biriyani lovers. We also tried the mango kulfi which was a special item on the menu. A drink made of pineapple was the cherry on top.

Located opposite to the Shiraz hotel, Park Circus, this place offers an excellent decor. The staff is friendly. The food is not too good, though. We ordered chicken chilly, chilly fish as starters. In the starter section, the fish was good, but the chicken was not cooked too well. Jumping on to the main course, we ordered mixed fried rice, Singapore rice and schezwan rice as staples and Chicken hot garlic, chilly fish and chilly chicken as side dishes. The quantity was enough for the six of us, although this time, the fish preparation tasted better. The deserts included brownie and ice-creams. The service is quick. Overall, 3.0/5.0

Purchased Nearbuy coupons for a Non veg Chinese meal and went to the place with great expectations, after all a Shiraz Brand demands a good quality. Whereas on the deal, it was mentioned that you could choose your selection from the menu, we found out that for the deal there was no such menu and instead the server rattled out 2 - 3 options in each category. This was the first setback. The sweet corn chicken soup was so watery that it was devoid of any flavour. Then we had the Chilly fish as starter and mixed fried rice and garlic fish for the main course. Must say the taste was below average, something you will get from one of the local road stalls. It was more Desi than chinese. The dessert selection was also a choice of icecream or a brownie. The brownie was a brittannia cake slice cut in long pieces! I would not go back to this place, not even with a discounted deal.

The decor may be luxurious but the food we had over there on PoilaÂ Boisakh day was not luxurious like the hotel seems to be.
The Chicken clear soup was so clear that there was no taste.The dishes were normal and didn't meet my expectation level.The number of desserts was very small plus the ice cream was already in melting condition.
It was a wastage of bucks for buying their buffet offer !

There's a certain elegance in this restaurant. From the moment we entered the restaurant, we felt like we were the only ones present as the staff payed so much attention to us.

Wonderful staff.. The thing i liked the most is then taking us that our starter or main course is ready and asking if they should bring it or not, rather than just coming with the food directly to us..

The food tastes awesome. Chinese food taste much better here than many other restaurants that i have been to.. Simply awesome

Started my meal with the refreshing 'BarMan Stand' which was yumm.. accompanied by roasted papads!! We had hot & sour chicken soup and sweet corn chicken soup, which were tasty again. Then chilly chicken made its way to the table, which was OK. Then for the mains we opted the plain and simple Egg Chicken Mixed Fried Rice with Schezwan Chicken... Food was a OK but I found the quantity lil less compared to the bucks spent in other restaurants.
The ambience of this place forced out an extra .5 star out of me!

Overall a good time :)

the food here is pretty decent, and the coffee is good. If you get over the initial mental bias against ordering anything but biryani, I have to say, the Spaghetti and the Chicken Satay here is pretty good. Apart from the Biryani, which is nearly double the quantity of normal biryani plates, the tandoori aloo is a great pick, especially for vegetarians. And the herb crusted lobster is topped with loads of lime and butter, which makes seafood lovers quite happy.

The erstwhile Shiraz Golden Restaurant is now The Jameson Inn, a star category hotel, situated at the Park Street-Mallick Bazar Crossing.
Interestingly, it houses two restaurants-Dawaat-e-Shiraz on the ground floor and The Park Pavilion on the 1st floor.
Ambience of Dawaat-e-Shiraz is classy compared to the Park Pavilion.
Food at the Park Pavilion is an average fare and nothing extra ordinary. The same Tandoori rotis, Chicken items and Rice items served elsewhere. Nothing extra-ordinary.
Service is good and ambience is commendable, but not classy as Dawaat-e-Shiraz below.
There is a lot of scope for improvement. Hope the management look into this.
Can be tried at times of hunger-crisis.

If you are expecting to have food which would taste great then it would be asking a bit more than they can deliver. Food is no doubt above average but nothing great. The spread is normal and great value for money. The kebabs as starters were great and the biryani are a few mentionable.

Today we had our lunch in The Park Pavilion. The hotel is located at a convenient location in the heart of the city near Park Street  - Mallick Bazar crossing. The Park Pavilion is a fine dining restaurant that is swathed in warm yellow and beige hues that lend to a comfortable dining experience as you sample a variety of exotic and traditional dishes. Today we opted to try their Chinese cuisine. Armchair travellers don't need a jet plane to go all over the world. Foodies don't either, all they need is an appetite. We had started with â€˜Chicken Manchowâ€™ & â€˜Chicken Hot & Sourâ€™ soups. Both soup taste decent but there was nothing in them to touch my heart. Starters we went for â€˜Crispy Chilly Chickenâ€™ & â€˜Crispy Chilly Fishâ€™. Fresh cooked Crispy Chilly Chicken tastes good but Crispy Chilly Fish tastes far better. Crispy Chilly Fish make my moods for main course. For main course we ordered â€˜Fish in Hot Garlic Sauceâ€™, â€˜Lemon Chickenâ€™, â€˜Veg Fried Riceâ€™, â€˜Burnt Garlic Fried Riceâ€™ & â€˜Szechwan Noodlesâ€™.  Fish in Hot Garlic Sauce was too good, perfectly made. Among rice I just love Burnt Garlic Fried Rice but Veg Fried Rice was very average. Lemon Chicken gave me a shock, it was poorly made and I think chef was thinking of something else while cooking it. We tried it with Szechwan Noodles, somehow Szechwan Noodles was tasty so it makeup the issue. In desserts, â€˜Hot Chocolate Brownieâ€™ was so soft it just melts in our mouth. All in all a nice peaceful place to have your lunch.

I had gone for Dinner Buffet at The Park Pavilion. I had a bad experience. The service was atrocious and the menu was limited. The food was cold and seemed stale. The only good thing about the restaurant was it's interiors. It is the only thing that makes the place good to dine in.

The buffet is awful .  The soup didn't come up well , a single sip was enough , was super spicy . Starters took almost 10 minutes every time they were ordered . The sprouts looked raw and tasted as they were there for decades unconsumed . Though the food , and Indian breads were o.k. as they were served hot . The sweet dishes were not worth tasting , rotten and pathetic .

Park Pavillion is not well known to public but it has a wonderful location and its food are better than many other restaurants running at park street.i have got the opportunity to go to the place many times.As its very close to my office,whenever i feel hungry at the lunch hour i go there with my friends and enjoy the food.The ambiace of Park Pavillion is like any other 5 star hotel in Kolkata.its very peaceful,calm and quite place.the only negative point of the place is that its located on the first floor of Tulip Inn(a well known hotel chain,all over the world.)They do not serve leqor in the restaurant.I will advise to people who does not give importance to bar but preffer good food and ambince to visit the place with family.specialy people who like the food of calcutta famous restauran Siraz (just oppsite to Tulip Inn) but do not like the crowd,as its always crowded,must go to Park Pavillion.
I will give 4 star to the place for service,5 star for food and again 4 star for the ambince.
I wish all the best to the owner who are running such a beautiful restaurant and maintaining the place so well.
