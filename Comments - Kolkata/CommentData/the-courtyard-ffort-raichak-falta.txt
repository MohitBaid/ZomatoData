One of my favourite weekend gateway. A perfect place to enjoy with your friends and loved ones. Food was good, though a bit over priced. Caramel custard was amazing.

Yesterday i visited this place. I was staying in the ganga kuthir, upon knowing that the restaurant there serves north Indian and the restaurant in f fort for chineese and north indian are separate, i landed here which serves both.  
The decor and ambience of the place is soothing and simple nothing great, very normal. 
The service was not upto the mark. We booked the place arund 130pm  and we were said to come at 230 pm. Upon reaching there, no place was empty,  we booked for 20 people. After waiting for around 30 mins we saw the tables getting empty. We were asked to sit where the sofas and the tables were still dirty and the mats uncleaned. It took another 30 mins for the waiters to clean 5 tables and mats. And the food came finally aftr more waiting. 
The starters were served in quater plate (crispy chilli babycorn) which could hardly suffice 2 person as starter. I think the quantity was compromised over the fact that the time of lunch was over.  After asking the waiter he said that that was the quantity offered here. Anyway, noodles were cold and fried just after taking out from fridge, they were sticky. North indian part was comparatively better and edible. 
Not a pleasant experience,  although the staff tries to work hard to provide the best. 
Many scope to improve.

One of the worse restaurant I have ever went. Firstly, you will not find the way to the restaurant as there is not way to show the path. Secondly, the waiters are always confused as what to do as if all of them are on their first day at service also with a lathergatic mood. The food is average.

Fancy walls and decors. That's it the first thing one would notice. Waiters were little confused. Food was alright, some were good. The gosht and fish preparations were good, though.

A long drive on a day with perfect weather made us reach Ffort Raichak for lunch. Had the lunch buffet here on the terrace beside the Ganges. The mutton in the buffet menu was a hit. Rest of the food was just passable. Price was more or less decent. Food wasn't anything memorable, but the ambiance made up for it along with the lovely weather.
May come back here to enjoy the ambiance on a weekend :)

Had to eat here as the orient was shut for the day. What do I say about the restaurant? The walls are the best thing about the restaurant.
Confused waiters who don't know the menu,having to ask for a spoon in the chutney they give you for kebab. And a "grub club" ish presentation of food is what Sums it all up

A small restaurant located in the Ffort suites. The food was good and was served quickly althoughÂ we were the only people having dinner at that time.

We ordered Kadhai paneer, garlic naan and shahi tukda. And everything was to our taste.
